&gt;&gt;the brain to &quot;workout&quot; by doing abstract stuff. And so, how would an<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This got me thinking....I took all the necessary math classes when Iã€€was in<br/>
school because it was expected of me. I got good grades too, and a decent<br/>
math SAT score, because that was expected of me...my parents would have<br/>
kicked my butt otherwise.  I then proceeded to choose a college that would<br/>
not require me to take any more math or science courses, because I simply<br/>
didn&#39;t like it and wasn&#39;t interested. Was any of that advanced math useful?<br/>
I don&#39;t really think so, since I managed to promptly forget it as soon as I<br/>
could. Guess I was tired of meeting peoples&#39; expectations.<br/>
No one taught me how to balance a checkbook, which would have been really<br/>
useful. Had to figure that out on my own much later.<br/>
<br/>
Here in Japan, kids are doing calculus in junior high....is that a good<br/>
thing? For some of them , maybe. For the rest, it is just one more hurdle<br/>
they have to jump over..because it&#39;s expected of them. I have no idea what<br/>
I&#39;ll do if my son turns out to be interested in math because I&#39;m rather<br/>
afraid of it, and still recovering from having it forced down my throat.<br/>
Luckily, Dh is an engineer and will probably be able to handle it.<br/>
