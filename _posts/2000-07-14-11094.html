<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536691831">Following is part of the message I was referring to earlier (thanks, <br/>
Stella &lt;g&gt;)  I&#39;m sure many folk will be sceptical about any kind fo <br/>
&#39;fad-diet&#39; as this could appear to be, yet I see many people <br/>
adhering to perceptions of themselves and other people, according <br/>
to certain &#39;personality types.&#39;  If these categories can be useful, <br/>
then why not blood-grouping?  It&#39;s a physical thing, that will <br/>
certainly be affected by what we eat, so perhaps what we need to <br/>
eat is affected by it.  Just a thought...<br/>

I came across a book written by Dr Peter<br/>
D&#39;Adamo, called &quot;The<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Eat Right Diet&quot; which discusses the different blood types and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; appropriate diets to follow in order to achieve optimum health,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; suggests that we actually have different needs regarding food -<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hence the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; anomaly.<br/>
&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
