LOL!!!! Okay, there&#39;s another one for my book too. I love this thread!!<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s what I&#39;m so afraid of when there are no more little ones in my <br/>
house. Missing all this really cute stuff!<br/>

Thanks Nancy. You made my sad ramblings turn to laughter. That will be <br/>
something nice to look forward to. I just hope I&#39;m not too senile to enjoy <br/>
it!!! I have this thing about getting old!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214440430">Here are some of ours:<br/>
<br/>
lip balm:  go-go-boo (for go-go = green and boo = blue, a color of one of the <br/>
tubes)<br/>
orange:    ah-no<br/>
Granddad:  Doh-da<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they still call each other Nay-nay (Nathan) and Ya-ya (Julia), <br/>
which always makes me smile.  And yesterday Nathan (4) told his dad on the <br/>
phone &quot;I bited my muddah.&quot;  He did actually bite me over a train dispute with <br/>
a two year old.  An improvement over hurting the two year old, in my opinion. <br/>
