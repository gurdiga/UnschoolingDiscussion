<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631962212">I am unsubbing from this list.  I am learning much from the death of my<br/>
aunt.  She got engaged Saturday night and was killed Sunday morning while<br/>
riding on the back of her fiance&#39;s motorcycle.  I can&#39;t continue to spend<br/>
the amount of time on the computer that I have been, and my home business is<br/>
taking enough computer time as it is.  I will likely search for a lower<br/>
volume unschooling list in a few months, but for now I need to curl up with<br/>
my babies and live and play. <br/>
<br/>
I thank you for the ideas and support both in parenting and unschooling, and<br/>
the help with finding words for my cousins&#39; journals.  I&#39;ve learned a lot in<br/>
the few months I&#39;ve been on this  list.  I look forward to meeting many of<br/>
you IRL at the Live and Learn conference this August.  <br/>
<br/>
With care, <br/>
Kristi <br/>
