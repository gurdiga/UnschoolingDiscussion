<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966223613">Hi Nicholina<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do this to myself sometimes too. I set myself high standards and then<br/>
get soooooo disappointed when I fall short. I have come to accept that I<br/>
will never be the perfect parent and this has been so freeing! When I mess<br/>
up, I apologise, still feel disappointed but not devasted and go on.<br/>
Ironically, accepting that I am never going to be the &quot;perfect&quot; parent has<br/>
enabled me to be a better parent!<br/>

&gt; Subject: One Lurker Says Hi<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With all the talk about those who don&#39;t post, I thought I&#39;d introduce<br/>
 </span></blockquote>myself as one of those non-posters, there-by removing myself from that<br/>
catigory.  :)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking for about a month now and enjoy the list, though<br/>
 </span></blockquote>occationally do mass deletes to catch up.  That is the reason for my lack of<br/>
posting.  I feel like I should be reading everything to make an informed<br/>
decision before putting my 2 bits out there, but just don&#39;t always find the<br/>
time to get through them all.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m mom to a 5 year old and have intended not to send her to school nor do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>school at home sense she was about 2 and I discovered unschooling.  I first<br/>
discovered Taking Children Seriously, which, while I think it&#39;s a nice<br/>
ideal, I have some trouble with it.  My problem is if I&#39;m not meeting an<br/>
ideal, I feel like a failure.  Anyway, I try my best to be respectful and<br/>
thoughful toward Davan and try not to beat myself up too much.  Where I was<br/>
trying to go with that was to say, it lead me toward unschooling, which is<br/>
something I can work with and is a great way of life.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to say, though, that lately I&#39;ve been feeling like I am not patient<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and creative enough with problem solving with Davan.  We ended up having<br/>
quite a bad seance at a store today.  I think Davan was hungry, which led to<br/>
some of the difficulties, but it gets me so down when she ends up crying and<br/>
angry and I end up angry and not the nicest of people in return.  Do any of<br/>
you ever feel like you don&#39;t have enough patience for this job?  Sometimes I<br/>
wonder about myself....<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; So, here I am, and I imagine that now I&#39;ve broken the ice with my first<br/>
 </span></blockquote>post, there will be more to follow.  :)<br/>
