<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172065207">As I mentioned before, our homeschool theater group (Theatrix) is presenting our 13th play next month: Mystery at Marlgate Manor (But Why Bump Off Barnaby?), a very funny  myster/farce. Dates and times are:<br/>
<br/>
Thurs., Nov. 8 at 2:00 p.m.<br/>
Friday, Nov. 9 at 7:00 p.m.<br/>
Saturday, Nov. 10 at 7:00 p.m.<br/>
Thurs, Nov. 15 at 7:00 p.m.<br/>
Fri., Nov. 16 at 7:00 p.m.<br/>
Sat., Nov. 17 at 7:00 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
We perform at The Hobart Stage, 46th Street and Blaisdell Avenue South in Minneapolis, MN (3 blocks west of the 46th Street exit off 35W). Tickets are $5.00 for adults and $3.00 for children (group rates available) and will go on sale in a couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Theatrix is non-sectarian and inclusive. Past plays have included Little Women;  A Christmas Carol; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe;  Charlottes Web; Anne of Green Gables;Tales from <br/>
    the Arabian Nights;The Wizard of Oz and It&#39;s a Wonderful Life.<br/>
<br/>
Having this group has been such a wonderful experience. It requires an incredible amount of work and devotion, but the results have been so, so worth it--the best being the lifetime memories that have been created for so many kids and their families. It&#39;s an incredible feeling to present, say, Tales From the Arabian Nights and realize that audiences come from all around to see 38 HOMESCHOOLED kids bringing magic to a stage. Some parents have told me they&#39;ve had friends and relatives come who had never seen a homeschooler and didn&#39;t realize they could lead some rich lives.<br/>
<br/>
It feels a bit weird to be &quot;advertising&quot; our next play right now, &#39;cause at the moment no one has their lines memorized, the stage set hasn&#39;t begun to be built, costumes are just in the discussion stage and the posters and tickets haven&#39;t been designed! Seeing it develop and become a reality is incredibly gratifying.<br/>
<br/>
It would be GREAT to see you, Sandra! Let me know if it&#39;s possible.<br/>
<br/>
Note; this play may not be suitable for younger children--contains loud noises, blackouts, people disappearing, a stabbing, etc. In other words, it&#39;s PG. Our first attempt at this sort of thing!<br/>

I forwarded the schedule to Keith.  It wouldn&#39;t be me, but it might be him!  <br/>
He really liked the plays he&#39;s seen of yours!   He&#39;s on his way home today, <br/>
but I know he&#39;s going out there another couple of times before the end of the <br/>
year.<br/>

He&#39;s a mathematician guy and not very emotional.  He&#39;s fine.  Minneapolis to <br/>
Albuquerque doesn&#39;t pass over many major icons of American culture or <br/>
finance.  A lot of desert and farms.<br/>
<br/>
My kids LOVE to go to theatre productions, but Marty has no interest in being <br/>
in one.  Holly does lots of at-home stuff, and tried out for two musicals but <br/>
didn&#39;t make it.  Someday, maybe.  There are smaller groups in town she could <br/>
get into but she&#39;s ambivalent.  Ambivalence is cheaper, so I&#39;m going to wait <br/>
until she&#39;s adamant and THEN she&#39;s in.  But she still loves going to the <br/>
theatre (for musicals, anyway).<br/>
