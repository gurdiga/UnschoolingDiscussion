You look to see if the moon&#39;s visible curve is on the side that would outline <br/>
a little &quot;d&quot; for diminishing = waning) or a lower-case &quot;b&quot; for getting <br/>
&quot;bigger.&quot; or waxing.<br/>

correct. Does anyone know?<br/>

It makes no sense to me.<br/>
It&#39;s English.  Wan is sickly, waning is getting smaller, when someone&#39;s <br/>
interest is waning, it does NOT mean they want you to tell MORE stories like that <br/>
one (etc.)   <br/>
<br/>
Waxing, if you wax something, would add to it.  But that&#39;s not the origin of <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t quote it here because of the Greek and Anglo Saxon letters, but here:<br/>

It&#39;s related (LONG long ago) to augment, and august:  to increase, and to be <br/>
big/majestic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412578182">Sorry, I wasn&#39;t asking about the origin of the words waxing and <br/>
waning. I was suddenly struck by the thought that the &quot;science&quot; might not be right, <br/>
and I could have passed along a &quot;wrong fact&quot; to my children.<br/>
<br/>
       Didn&#39;t mean to annoy anyone whose interest was waning (or to wane on <br/>
the list&#39;s parade?? &lt;g&gt;)  JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713479422">I&#39;ve never heard that device, but from the post I thought that the point was to tell whether the moon was in the process of getting bigger or smaller (i.e., where in the lunar month you are) -- not what the words &quot;wax&quot; and &quot;wane&quot; mean, which you have to know in order for the memory device (of wax = b) and (wane = d) to work.  <br/>
<br/>
I found this interesting and did a quick search.  Looks like it does work. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/java/MoonPhase.htm">http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/java/MoonPhase.htm</a> <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26240468">I thought this little device was so cool when I first heard it that I <br/>
never questioned it.. I don&#39;t remember the source, but it must have <br/>
been someone I trusted to know, for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
I came upon this trick long after leaving school myself, in casual <br/>
adult conversation, probably standing in someone&#39;s driveway one <br/>
night. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I know for sure is it was definitely not from schooling!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I guess there&#39;s a downside to just hearing something in passing <br/>
like that. I never stopped to think how much knowledge it&#39;s based on, <br/>
like what the words waxing and waning mean, and how and why the moon <br/>
phases change.  It wouldn&#39;t be useful to anyone (unschooling or not)<br/>
who didn&#39;t already know those things and/or who wasn&#39;t interested in <br/>
a handy tool to figure out this particular point.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Cat for checking it out. Thanks too for stating the science <br/>
more clearly than I did.  JJ<br/>
