<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943740997">I participate in one with girls ages 6 to 11, and also an adult group. <br/>
We use a written book guide as a STARTING POINT for discussion.  The<br/>
guides contain information about the author, recipes and/or crafts that<br/>
somehow relate to the story, a short article on a topic relating to the<br/>
story, and a list of questions for discussion.  Besides the discussion,<br/>
we have a snack and the girls do the craft.  (I am not at all a crafts<br/>
person, but my girls enjoy that part.)<br/>
<br/>
We followed this philosophy:<br/>
&quot;What we share is our love of learning and reading.  While we do not<br/>
always agree, controversy breeds interesting discussion and thus, we<br/>
respect all opinions.&quot;<br/>

Here is a site with guides for sale (or to give you ideas):<br/>
