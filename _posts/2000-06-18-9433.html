<div id="ygrps-yiv-34243950"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; Be careful of any baby carrier that keeps the babies legs spread apart.<br/>
&gt; Little ones hips are still soft and forming and these top of carriers, can<br/>
&gt; effect that formation.  They, also add pressure on the bottom the spine.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to add a note here.  My oldest was born with a dislocated hip<br/>
and had to wear a brace for six months, and was seen by a pediatric<br/>
orthopedic specialist for the first year of his life.  Because of the brace<br/>
conventional carriers did not work, and he *had* to be carried in order to<br/>
be happy.  I saw a sling carrier in a magazine and bought it hoping it would<br/>
work.  It did, and I loved it.  I can&#39;t remember the brand, it was one of<br/>
the first ones, with metal rings.  I used it for my three kids, a friend<br/>
used it for her two in between my three, and I passed it on after I was done<br/>
with it.  Very durable!<br/>
<br/>
The orthopedist told me that the sling was very good for babies, as it held<br/>
them in a natural position.  He also said that the umbrella strollers were<br/>
unhealthy for young babies since it forced them to sit up and put too much<br/>
pressure on the spine.  Strollers that allow babies to recline are best for<br/>
babies.  Remember that bones are actually cartilage when babies are born,<br/>
and even at one year old there is still a significant amount of cartilage.</div>
