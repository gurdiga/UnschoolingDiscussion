<div id="ygrps-yiv-210460420">I wanted respond to so many of the posts, because they both really helped me with some useful (and sometimes obvious--doh! shoulda thought of that!--advice) and sparked me to ask more questions  This is so good for me! Life is so busy here, though, it&#39;s almost more than I can do to just read all the posts, much less respond.  So I wanted to say thank you to everyone.  The lightbulb above my head is glowing brighter these days, and I&#39;m having many success and happy moments at home because of what I&#39;m learning here.  <br/>
<br/>
So even though we have been having financial difficulties for at least 2 years and my car has been broken for 3 weeks and I&#39;m on my period  and out of pads and yesterday my 3 year old punctured her knee deeply on a rusty nail outside and I had to take the last running bus at 5:30 to the hospital ER 15 miles away for a tetanus shot, hoping that we&#39;d be able to find a way home that didn&#39;t mind taking a check since I had no cash (how nice that someone from the hospital gave us a ride home!), I&#39;m not a screaming lunatic and we are all feeling more secure and happier as a family.  Really.  Thanks so much for all the insight.<br/>
