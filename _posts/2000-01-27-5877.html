<div id="ygrps-yiv-920766018">Hi Beth, <br/>
<br/>
Sorry I haven&#39;t answered sooner...I&#39;ve been behind in my mail. I&#39;m an unsc= <br/>
hooler in New Hampshire and I&#39;d like to let you know that the only really n= <br/>
egative feedback I&#39;ve gotten from people around here regarding homeschoolin= <br/>
g is because I live in Rye and the elementary school here received the NATI= <br/>
ONAL BLUE RIBBON AWARD. Yadda yadda. They are so proud of that that they = <br/>
even put it on realty signs in front of houses. So instead of a little sig= <br/>
n above that says &quot;3 Bedroom&quot;, etc., it says Blue Ribbon Award. It&#39;s funny= <br/>
because no one who has told me that has known what the criteria for the aw= <br/>
ard is. LOL It really doesn&#39;t impress me. In Michigan we chose to live i= <br/>
n an area that was suppose to be one of the best schools. And it was the = <br/>
worst school experience we ever had...which is why I started researching ho= <br/>
meschooling. Anyway, I&#39;m glad you have a friend in OH because the laws the= <br/>
re are basically the same and I&#39;m sure she&#39;s answered alot of your question= <br/>
s. It&#39;s really a lot easier than it seems to homeschool here. If you need= <br/>
any help feel free to email me. By the way, what part of New Hampshire ar= <br/>
e you in? I have 3 kiddies Stephen 8, Dani 3, and Brie 16 mos (but she thi= <br/>
nks she&#39;s 3 too). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115511457">Hi Heather,<br/>
 I&#39;m up in Conway in the White Mountains. Have you been this way yet? There<br/>
is another hs mom who is going to be in touch in Feb and is moving here too.<br/>
Her son is also 8. My daughter Melissa is going to be 8 and my son Kyle just<br/>
turned 7. I am seriously looking into checking out the art museum in<br/>
Manchester have you gone to the homeschooling fine art classes they look<br/>
terrific and maybe worth the 2 hour drive each way? Would love to know if<br/>
you&#39;ve checked it out. I don&#39;t know where you are is it near Portsmouth<br/>
another cool town. I am considering contacting a certified teacher near<br/>
there to be the one I go to for the evals. she is actually in Maine but does<br/>
them for both states I&#39;ve noticed her bio on the web page for NH.. She only<br/>
charges between $25-$35. Have others interviewed these evaluators and what<br/>
sort of questions do you guys ask them? I&#39;d love to learn more from you feel<br/>
free to email me privately too at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:beth2002@...">beth2002@...</a><br/>
