<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776625765">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
My friend and I have formed a unschooling support group for our area :<br/>
<br/>
Sacramento Unschooling Network<br/>
www.SUNetwork.com<br/>
<br/>
And was wondering if those who have experience with this sort of thing could<br/>
offer some feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Please :-)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Bronwen</div>

What I learned: You&#39;ll meet a lot more unschoolers if you host a conference! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think just the sharing of unschooling is worth the expense and pain of <br/>
having a group.<br/>
<br/>
You are welcome to hit our site (which is unfortunately down at the <br/>
moment)----and I&#39;d be happy to answer any specific questions you might have about our <br/>
group and what we do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439505850">The HUG site has a general essay on starting a group.  There&#39;s also <br/>
info there on getting the word out. <br/>

I really enjoyed doing HUG.  It got to be too big (almost 200 <br/>
families) and diluted (everyone who wasn&#39;t a Christian homeschooler <br/>
ended up there by default) so it&#39;s basically inactive now.  There&#39;s <br/>
only the web site left.  <br/>
<br/>
Now there are few of us radical unschoolers who call ourselves The <br/>
HUG Underground just for fun.  They&#39;re all families I met while <br/>
coordinating HUG and we became friends.  Those families are the <br/>
greatest benefit of doing the group for so long.  Their friendship is <br/>
worth all of the frustrations.<br/>
