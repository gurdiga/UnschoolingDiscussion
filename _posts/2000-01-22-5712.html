<div id="ygrps-yiv-913396517">thanks Lucy in Ca.<br/>
By the way, I have a Lucy, she is seven and was thrilled <br/>
to see a note to Mommy from another  Lucy. Thanks for your<br/>
 wisdom. I tend to get militant when I feel insecure, not<br/>
a very appealing personality trait. I am also learning to<br/>
relax about our unschooling choices and learn from people<br/>
around me with a little more mileage on the journey. I want<br/>
my kids to direct their own learning. What do you do to turn<br/>
down the outside volume so that you can hear your own inner<br/>
voice? I appreciate anyone&#39;s input on not allowing other<br/>
people&#39;s expectations dictate their lives, educational choices<br/>
or philosophies. Thanks so much.<br/>

Teresa,<br/>
     Yes, I know this feeling and reaction, too!  So you have a Lucy...tell <br/>
her hello from another Lucy.  I was named after my grandmother, my mom&#39;s mom.<br/>
     You asked about turning down the outside volume to hear your own <br/>
voice...I believe that we do have a core sense within us of what we truly <br/>
believe.  One way that I keep that voice clear is by writing regularly in my <br/>
journal, as I have done for years.  I also make time to read books and <br/>
articles by people whose opinions I respect and whose beliefs are similar to <br/>
my own.  I also read differing points of view but when you are doing <br/>
something which differs significantly from the mainstream, I think you need <br/>
at least equal time in exposure to those who share your beliefs so that you <br/>
don&#39;t feel isolated from the rest of humanity.  This list has been one of my <br/>
biggest sources for that reassurance and support.<br/>
     When I read things that ring true, that have a certain sound that I <br/>
believe in, it gives me a sense of peace and connection to others.  That <br/>
gives me strength when talking with others who may strongly disagree.<br/>
      <br/>
     Best Wishes on your own journey...<br/>
<br/>

environment when we feel insecure or threatened.  I think it&#39;s instinct.<br/>
