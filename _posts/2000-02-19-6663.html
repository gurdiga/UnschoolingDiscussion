<br/>
My name is Amelia and I live in Memphis, TN.  I was given the information <br/>
about this list by a friend of my sisters.....Justine.  Hi Justine!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am the mom to Ravi Sarath (see his homepage  &lt;A <br/>

0730&quot;&gt;Ravi&#39;s Website&lt;/A&gt; ) and married to a very nice Indian guy named <br/>
Chandra.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to homeschool long before our son came into the picture, but when <br/>
we got to know him, we were sure we wanted to.  He is gifted and we didn&#39;t <br/>
want him in the school system (aka institution).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway we live in Memphis, TN and we would love to hear from any of you!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673798678">Hi Amelia,<br/>
                Just wanted to let you know that there&#39;s another sight you<br/>
might be interested in. It&#39;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Tennhomeschoolers@egroups.com">Tennhomeschoolers@egroups.com</a>. I found out<br/>
about them through my homeschooling group. I live in MA, but the list came<br/>
highly recomended. Ididn&#39;t find all coversations helpful, because many of<br/>
them are TN based, but you may find this extremly helpful.<br/>

<h4>Lara Kimber</h4>
<p><small><time>27 May 2000, at  6:48pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059452993">Hello everyone! My name is Lara Kimber, and I wanted to take a moment <br/>
to introduce myself. First, thank you very much for allowing me to be <br/>
a part of your discussions. I enjoy very much talking with other <br/>
homeschoolers, and know that in my entire lifetime I will never cease <br/>
to learn new things. <br/>
<br/>
I am currently a stay at home mom, married to a supportive and hard <br/>
working husband named Sam, and we have a wonderful 16th month old <br/>
daughter named Abigail. We are also currently living in the Marietta, <br/>
GA. area.  Though Abigail may not be &quot;officially&quot; homeschooling yet, <br/>
I do believe that we learn from birth and homeschooling is just a <br/>
natural progression from there. I knew about 5 years before I had <br/>
Abigail that I would be homeschooling my children. It was actually <br/>
something I had thought of since my childhood and as I grew older I <br/>
knew for a fact that it was what I wanted to do for my children.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading more and more about Unschooling. I currently <br/>
subscribe to Growing Without Schooling magazine, and I have become a <br/>
big fan of John Holt&#39;s books. I&#39;ve also started collecting other <br/>
books on Unschooling. While I cannot say that we will Unschool <br/>
completely (as of yet *wink*), I do know that it will be a large part <br/>
of our lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Almost a year ago I founded a Homeschool Support Group <br/>
called &quot;L.L.G. - Lifetime Learners of Georgia&quot;. Due to my computer <br/>
dying, I have been without the Internet for almost 7 months, but <br/>
other members of the group helped keep it running while I was away. I <br/>
am happy to say that my family now has another computer and I am <br/>
working hard to pick back up where I left off with the support group. <br/>
I am also resubscribing to any discussion lists that I became dropped <br/>
from due to inactivity. So I am sure I will see some familiar names. <br/>
<br/>
The L.L.G. website can be found at: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freeyellow.com/members8/llg/">http://www.freeyellow.com/members8/llg/</a> , and I will be updating it <br/>
this week (as it is very outdated due to my lack of computer). It <br/>
will also be continually updated and if you know anyone in need of a <br/>
support group in Georgia, feel free to give out our web address, so <br/>
they can see if we might be able to help. Anyone can of course drop <br/>
by if they like. I am hoping the site will be of help to all <br/>
homeschoolers, not just the members of L.L.G. We also have an email <br/>
discussion list which can be found at: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.egroups.com/group/LLGlist">http://www.egroups.com/group/LLGlist</a> . Thanks to the storage <br/>
abilities of the Internet, our website and email list (including <br/>
archived posts) are still there. For that I am very greatful.<br/>
<br/>
The L.L.G. support group caters to the diverse society we live in, <br/>
and all homeschooling families are welcome! However, our members <br/>
prefer their religious and political beliefs not be a part of the <br/>
group&#39;s identity and purpose. We are in no way related with the <br/>
Secular Humanists, nor are we anti-Christian, or any other religious <br/>
or political belief, in any way. Our group is an eclectic mix of many <br/>
personal religious and political beliefs. Our main focus is to <br/>
support learning lifestyles. <br/>
<br/>
I am eager to begin speaking and interacting with other homeschoolers <br/>
again. I look forward to learning from you all, and helping any way I <br/>
possibly can. My current email address is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mrslarak@...">mrslarak@...</a>. Please <br/>
feel free to contact me through email if you ever want information <br/>
about the L.L.G. support group, or just to talk.  *smile* <br/>
