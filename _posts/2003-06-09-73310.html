I am wondering what people on this list think of &quot;vision therapy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooler on another list thinks it was very important.  There <br/>
was also the theory &quot;that modern habits that have children sitting <br/>
and fixing their eyes on one distance for prolonged periods is a <br/>
problem--i.e. television and computers. It used to be that people <br/>
were out in the world having to fix their eyes on all different <br/>
distances and heights, but today we&#39;re limiting ourselves. AND one <br/>
PAVE volunteer who now works as a vision therapist once told <br/>
me she thinks children having to read too early is another problem--<br/>
again, fixing their developing vision system on something that is not <br/>
appropriate at that&quot;<br/>
