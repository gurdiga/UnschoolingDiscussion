<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480318356">I have been following this post and I have been sitting her thinking. <br/>
 If each family or parent has different levels of concern or panic how do we <br/>
know at what point we are drawing the line too soon or too late? I mean what <br/>
seems ok to one may not be ok to others.<br/>
For instance my son watches the news when he enters the room and I have it on <br/>
If we have come to a sensitive subject I have explained it to him. During the <br/>
beginning of the war he watched with me during the day. I am prior Marine <br/>
Corps and he is wanting to go in when he is old enough.<br/>
 It actually peeked a sizable interest in other wars and books written on <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
I know for me I have taken the no limits into levels that my husband has <br/>
protested.  When is it too far?<br/>
So for me/us there are areas that need tweaking but others that some feel I <br/>
am too lax on. <br/>

&lt;&lt;I know for me I have taken the no limits into levels that my husband has<br/>
protested.  When is it too far?<br/>
So for me/us there are areas that need tweaking but others that some feel I<br/>
am too lax on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can only speak for myself, but I think knowing our own kids as we do, and<br/>
really watching them and seeing certain signs and listening to them gives us<br/>
all the insight we need as to what they need or want and what they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I mean how do we know when they show interest in learning things? They ask<br/>
us, or start playing all about the subject of interest, or draw pictures of<br/>
that, or ask for books about it, etc. And what they don&#39;t show interest in,<br/>
we don&#39;t push. (Not sure that&#39;s a good word as we don&#39;t push even the<br/>
interested subjects.)<br/>
<br/>
And if one is just showing interest, we don&#39;t go out all gangbusters. When<br/>
my kids show an interest in something, I don&#39;t go and spend tons of money on<br/>
it in case that interest is short lived. We start small and go as they want.<br/>
That way if the interest is satisfied, I don&#39;t feel like we&#39;ve signed up and<br/>
spent great amounts of time with something that has passed.<br/>
<br/>
Same with tv and such. We have a love or horror movies here. Joe and Tara<br/>
and I love them. I didn&#39;t sit my other children down and show them Friday<br/>
the 13th. We started with the old black and white Them. A really corney<br/>
movie about giant ants but the kids loved it. Joseph has a love for the<br/>
*can&#39;t possibly be real* type scary movies. Like Starship Troopers and<br/>
Tremors. But awhile ago there was something we watched that made him tell us<br/>
it scared him and he didn&#39;t like it. I can&#39;t even remember what it was.<br/>
Sierra was fine with it and he wasn&#39;t. He wasn&#39;t traumatized by it, but<br/>
aware that he didn&#39;t like it. So again, it was one step at a time.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how we are able to gauge levels for each kid at different ages. We<br/>
just watch and listen.<br/>

Halloween night, we went to a family party.  The kids had the basement and <br/>
the grownups were upstairs.  They had *Pet Semetary* to watch for the kids. I <br/>
was a bit nervous, as I couldn&#39;t make it thru the book OR the movie ~ too too <br/>
too creepy for me (and I LOVE Stephen King!).  I didn&#39;t transfer any of that to <br/>
my kids, I let them self regulate.  I was just up the stairs and they were <br/>
free to hang out with me or go into another room downstairs and play.  They chose <br/>
to watch the movie and we have been having the most amazing conversations <br/>
since then!  First they neener, neener, neenered me for not seeing the whole <br/>
movie &lt;bg&gt; but then they talked about *why* those things happened, which led to <br/>
talking about sacred land which led to why life is better than death, which is <br/>
better than being undead against your will, etc.  No nightmares, which was my <br/>
fear, but plenty of new respect for anything called sacred.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564939122">My concern isn&#39;t me offering enough freedom I wondered if there was such a <br/>
thing as too much.  My concern was is it possible to allow too much freedom?....<br/>
I know my son and limiting tv, video games, friends, etc., has not been a <br/>
need at all. I think the wants and needs are unlimited for him and for him the <br/>
freedom works. To me its natural to not limit these things and when he was in <br/>
school years ago I didn&#39;t limit much then either. <br/>
<br/>
There are times like his kitty litter box in his room that I get friction <br/>
from my husband. His cat has issues and poops and pees on his floor. I am <br/>
pregnant and I have been picking it up.  I will ask him to and he doesn&#39;t do it so I <br/>
do it. Is this the extent of what I am to do or do I go further and require <br/>
him to do this for my safety? His room smells and so does the bathroom and <br/>
hallway when his door is opened. The cat has a skin condition and no claws so I <br/>
cant find a home right now or offer the kitty to potty outside.  My husband just <br/>
put new laminate floors down a few months ago and the cat has ruined an entire <br/>
corner and the flooring is discontinued.<br/>
The smell is annoying and a topic weekly on trash day. What solution is <br/>
workable to all? <br/>
This is causing me great stress listening to the hubby and has been easier <br/>
for me to go in and take care of it but I am not thrilled with the fact that my <br/>
son knows that I am not to be touching it and he doesn&#39;t appear to care nor <br/>
bothered by the smell while he sleeps. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the cat is an indoor cat, the dangers to you as a pregnant <br/>
woman are almost non-existent -- outdoor cats who hunt are at <br/>
most risk for infection. You can have the cat tested if you want to <br/>
be sure.<br/>
<br/>
This situation is a family situation -- if the cat is destroying the <br/>
house and making life difficult for the humans, the cat needs to <br/>
adjust, be adjusted, or leave. There are a variety of options: the <br/>
cat can be retrained, by confining him to a bathroom with a very <br/>
clean litter box for several weeks while the rest  of the house is <br/>
thoroughly cleaned of odors. The cat can be confined to a pen <br/>
containing his litter box, himself, his food and water, in an easy-<br/>
to-clean area (the garage, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I missed how old your son is, but expecting anyone pre-teen to <br/>
take sole care of a pet is probably an unreasonable expectation. <br/>
Some kids will at earlier ages, but many just are not capable of <br/>
remembering or putting that kind of priority on it.<br/>
<br/>
Pets can be great additions to the family, but they shouldn&#39;t come <br/>
before the people, IMHO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112024987">Having the cat box in the kid&#39;s room or bathroom seems a bad plan.  Can you <br/>
make a door into a utility room or garage?  Where it&#39;s colder the box will <br/>
stink less, and on a concrete or tile floor damage is less. <br/>
<br/>
We use the carboard flats the canned food comes in.  It&#39;s kind of the circle <br/>
of life (of cat input/output) and I just throw the whole box sometimes, and <br/>
sometimes just transfer the cleanest stuff to a new box.  But disposable boxes <br/>
cut down on lots of the work.  They don&#39;t need it deep, just clean.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t scrimp and get crummy cat litter, either.  If you get the clumping <br/>
absorbant odor reducing stuff, that helps.    I&#39;ve seen people buy that litter and <br/>
then get an expensive cat box and then not change it for two or three weeks.  <br/>
That&#39;s pretty crazy.  And it makes the cat crazy too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378243507">Well we have cats here and this situation would definitely need to be<br/>
addressed.  I had to give a cat up once because of such problems. She just<br/>
wasn&#39;t adjusting to the growing family and when she peed on my kitchen<br/>
counter, that was it. We had tried all our other options so she went to a<br/>
new home.<br/>
<br/>
To me, that&#39;s a matter of what&#39;s clean, nice smelling and a comfort level<br/>
for me and others in the house. If it doesn&#39;t bother any of you, then that&#39;s<br/>
different. It seems like it sure does so there would be a solution of some<br/>
kind if it happened here.<br/>
<br/>
First make sure there&#39;s nothing physically wrong with the cat. Sometimes, as<br/>
odd as it sounds, it can be a physical problem. I would then remove the cat<br/>
and box from a bedroom and chose a bathroom, laundry room or garage to<br/>
confine the cat. The cat box has to be kept immaculately clean. Some cats<br/>
are way more serious about this than others. The automatic cleaning boxes<br/>
are great. Try all different kinds of cat litter and also cat boxes. Some<br/>
cats like larger boxes, and some like to be concealed as in a box with a<br/>
hood. And some cats are really picky about the litter they use. Cheap can<br/>
work for some and others won&#39;t have it.<br/>
<br/>
It takes time and money but a solution may very well be found.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Seems to me that there are a couple of issues here, and that it is not<br/>
really about &quot;no limiting&quot; in the same way food restrictions/tv etc is.<br/>
One issue is where should that cat actually live, since there are<br/>
physical problems being caused in the home. Several people have made<br/>
suggestions. The other is should your son be responsible for the cat,<br/>
especially one that is not fully well. The third issue is that you and<br/>
your husband have something interfering with your happy relationship on<br/>
an ongoing basis.<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was that maybe you should just step away from the<br/>
situation. Invite your husband to take the matter up with your son<br/>
directly, and take up the catshit too. This is of course easier said<br/>
than done. My dh was always complaining about mess that Jayn makes, and<br/>
would walk over the doll on the floor ten times, and grumble, rather<br/>
than just pick the thing up. If I ask him to help me, he is always<br/>
willing to. <br/>
<br/>
If your son can&#39;t take care of the cat, it should not be &quot;his&quot; cat. This<br/>
is a living creature, and I don&#39;t think falls into the same category as<br/>
a simply messy room (see archives for lengthy discussions on that topic)<br/>
that can be left alone with the door shut. If it is approached as giving<br/>
him a break from the cat, or helping him out with it, maybe he won&#39;t<br/>
feel punished. Having the cat removed from his space and care sounds<br/>
like a natural consequence to me, rather than an arbitrary one.<br/>
<br/>
When my room mate had a cat that started going all over the place, it<br/>
turned out to have a bladder infection caused by too much dried food in<br/>
the diet. I also remember some room mates years ago that had kittens<br/>
that basically destroyed the carpets of our rental. I think they<br/>
eventually all moved out, but not before I had made some pretty angry<br/>
demands, and cleaned up a lot. The cats were pooping at the doormat of<br/>
the back door frequently - I think they wanted out. <br/>
<br/>
A final thought - what about one of those electronic litter boxes that<br/>
rakes the clumps away? Does anyone have any experience with those<br/>
things?<br/>

in terror. But our cats love it. They love to watch it scooping. Love the<br/>
fact that it&#39;s always clean. And, yes, the more expensive clumping is better<br/>
than cheap clumping, even if the cheap says &quot;premium&quot; cat litter.<br/>

We have one and love it.  They are not cheap (around $90) but worth every penny. I gave dh one for Father&#39;s day &lt;bg&gt;.  He was our designated scooper and he loathed the job.<br/>

If you get one - don&#39;t put too much litter in - that makes the sensors nuts.<br/>

We got one for Tara last Christmas. I find that one box and 3 cats (with one<br/>
on the way) does make it a bit more in need of care then none at all, but<br/>
still well worth it.<br/>
