Well, or barter if you definitely don&#39;t want it.  <br/>
Ya know, an unschooling barter list would come in handy, wouldn&#39;t it?  We <br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry so much about buying stuff the kids don&#39;t end up liking if some <br/>
other kids would use it later......<br/>
<br/>
 Or, that&#39;s what basements are for.  lol  My FIL has tons of stuff down <br/>
there,  he&#39;s gone thru at least 10 hobbies and saves everything.  Good for us, <br/>
we&#39;ve gotten fishtank stuff, woodworking stuff, National Geograpics from 20 years <br/>
ago, etc!  <br/>
