Anyone know of a Pokemon Pokedex site that has a sound feature? Specifically, a pronunciation guide along the lines of Merriam-Webster&#39;s online dictionary?<br/>
<br/>
Any other favorite Pokemon sites you or your kiddos want to share for the budding Pokemon fan?<br/>
<br/>

There are no specific pronunciation sites that she knows of. Pokemon  <br/>
have Japanese and English names, so sometimes you can figure out  <br/>
pronunciation of the English ones by looking at the Japanese. The  <br/>
anime isn&#39;t always reliable as the dubbing can be inconsistent. Senna  <br/>
says &quot;just go with what you think it is&quot; &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
