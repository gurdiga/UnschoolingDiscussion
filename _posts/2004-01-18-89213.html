<div id="ygrps-yiv-895891825">&quot;But electric saws are likewise glorious.   Cordless drill.   That&#39;s a <br/>
miracle. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mmmmm, yes. I feel so totally manly when I&#39;m using the compound miter saw, great tool that one. And I don&#39;t know what on earth I&#39;d do without a cordless drill, I love having a dh that appreciates good tools, blue collar guys are A-Ok with me.<br/>

going in and buing my own wood! I got to the point where I knew the lingo, how <br/>
empowing that was!!! I bought myself a big scroll saw, a belt sander, drill, <br/>
power sander and more. I also built all of our display with my now 20yros&#39;s <br/>
help. (He was about 12-14 when we did this) It was quite elaborate with old <br/>
shutters and ivy and lights and very beautiful.  I think it just feels good to feel <br/>
accomplished at something no matter what it is.<br/>
