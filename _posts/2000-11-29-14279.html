&quot;Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in<br/>
my<br/>
sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a reverie, amidst the pines<br/>
and<br/>
hickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the<br/>
birds<br/>
sing around or flitted noiseless through the house, until by the sun falling<br/>
in at my west window, or the noise of some traveller&#39;s wagon on the distant<br/>
highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time. I grew in those seasons like<br/>
corn in the night, and they were far better than any work of the hands would<br/>
have been. They were not time subtracted from my life, but so much over and<br/>
above my usual allowance.&quot; --Henry David Thoreau<br/>

minute bath uninterrupted, much less sit there rapt in reverie all day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hear, hear...nonetheless it&#39;s a beautiful description of how certain creative <br/>
minds work.     My oldest was the one who most often appeared to be doing <br/>
&quot;nothing.&quot; She&#39;s also the m one with the artistic/dramatic personality. From <br/>
ages 6-12 I was rather mystified by her inclination to spend her time <br/>
reading, watching TV and playing Barbies. I would get glimpses along the way <br/>
of what was going on inside her. Nothing she did looked like school. When she <br/>
was 11 or 12 we were reading an article in the Smithsonian about people who <br/>
dress mannequins and she said, &quot;See, Mom, it&#39;s a real thing, my interest in <br/>
Barbies.&quot; Now she&#39;s almost 20 and is studying drama at the City College of <br/>
San Francisco and dreaming of going to the London Academy of Dramatic Arts in <br/>
a couple of years.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510938842">Kirby used to arrange his Ninja Turtle figures into elaborate battle scenes <br/>
and say &quot;Come an dsee my sculpture!&quot;  He would tell me what each was doing, <br/>
and why each had which weapons and what Splinter was doing and who knew what <br/>
in the scene, and who was being surprised.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t really my kind of thing, but subsequent to that I tried to remember <br/>
to point out to him when I saw battle scenarios in gaming stores, or <br/>
paintings of historic battles, or diagrams in books of troop movements.  He <br/>
was doing a real thing.  It was story telling, and tactics, and <br/>
&quot;documentation&quot;--things that &quot;real&quot; adults do for fun and money.  (If you <br/>
don&#39;t like military topics, think model railroading.)<br/>
<br/>
For Barbies, you can see window dressings of all sorts (sometimes with whole <br/>
rooms created for the mannequin to sit in), store displays, catalog layouts, <br/>
magazine advertising, museum displays, the layout of books such as DK and <br/>
Usborne which have things arranged on the page so that one&#39;s eye is led from <br/>
one part to another.  They&#39;re &quot;just playing&quot; the way some lucky adults just <br/>
play for a living!  Commercial art lives!<br/>
<br/>
Also from Barbie play and drawing people (and dressing the drawings) and <br/>
outlining kids with chalk on sidewalks and dressing those outlines, Holly has <br/>
worked up a large set of color and shape schemes.  She dresses amazingly (and <br/>
did NOT get it from me, that&#39;s for sure) in stuff she finds at thrift stores <br/>
or garage sales, and will use a skirt as a shirt, will see something that <br/>
matches a pair of shoes she has and will build a knockout outfit based on two <br/>
things (down to earrings and hairtie).  That kind of art isn&#39;t to be <br/>
discouraged.<br/>
