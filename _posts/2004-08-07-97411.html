<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950950428">I don&#39;t know if most people experience this, but I get very cranky if <br/>
I&#39;m hungry. Especially if I don&#39;t realize that I&#39;m hungry. So in my <br/>
experience food is inextricably linked to emotional well being and it <br/>
has nothing to do with an eating disorder. My younger sister is the same <br/>
way. When she was little (7?) and I was in my early 20s we went to a <br/>
museum and she was acting very emotional and I wasn&#39;t sure why. Then she <br/>
had a banana and everything smoothed out. She just hadn&#39;t eaten enough <br/>
at lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it is not healthy to eat to deal with any and all emotions. <br/>
Sometimes you have to employ other solutions. Those people who think <br/>
food is the solution to everything have clearly gone too far.<br/>

&gt; Isn&#39;t that kind of connection between food and<br/>
&gt; emotions what causes people with eating disorders to<br/>
&gt; eat in order to feel better.� Food feeds our bodies.<br/>
&gt; I try to avoid certain things because of what I<br/>
&gt; believe (and many others believe) to be unhealthy for<br/>
&gt; my body.� Food does taste good and a lot of people<br/>
&gt; (including me) enjoy food and there is nothing wrong<br/>
&gt; with that, but I don&#39;t equate food with my emotional<br/>
&gt; well being.<br/>
