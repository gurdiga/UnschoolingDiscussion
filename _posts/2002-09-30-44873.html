&gt; go out hunting and then the meat is free. Back home people don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; hunt. I&#39;m not sure if its cos its illegal, or wildlife is protected or that <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; we ain&#39;t allowed guns. (I&#39;m not counting the aristocracy chasing <br/>
&gt; foxes. Thats not hunting, more like torture and slaughter).<br/>

leave England if Fox hunting is banned? ;o) I could have sworn that we went <br/>
pheasant and grouse hunting when I was a kid and we visited friends in <br/>
England and Scotland. But we lived so many places, I could be wrong about the <br/>
place. (?) <br/>

grouse shoots and pheasant shoots. Its all organised and is very <br/>
expensive. The rcih also go fox-hunting.<br/>
It&#39;s not like here where you can just take your gun and go shoot <br/>
something.<br/>
Actually I think some people go and kill rabbits for food but mainly <br/>
farmers.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder where Charles will go if Fox hunting is banned? You lot are <br/>
more than welcome to him and the whole royal family<br/>
