&lt;&lt; i can&#39;t even begin to tell you how mad I AM at your mother-in-law. <br/>
 THE NERVE. she obviously is on a power trip. BEWARE. i don&#39;t think <br/>
 this is the end of it. you and darin should talk about the &quot;what <br/>
 ifs&quot;: what if she gets really power hungry and denounces you and your <br/>
 husband of child neglect? is he ready to go to court and get a <br/>
 restraining order against her? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I totally AGREE!! I would have threatened the woman with a law suit if she <br/>
ever tries anything like that again. I would probably get a restraining order <br/>
on her.<br/>
At the least, make it very, very clear that she is not welcome anywhere near <br/>
your children. EVER.<br/>
Please Nancy. People like this do not get better, they get worse. Think about <br/>
it, she was willing to totally break up your marriage over this. She&#39;s evil <br/>
at best.<br/>
Stay away from this psycho b****. Seeing her at group gatherings is one <br/>
thing....I would not permit her in my house.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do that.  But I would try to make the visits short and infrequent, <br/>
and in the company of other people.<br/>
<br/>
The kids need to see her as they&#39;re getting older so they can judge for <br/>
themselves.  If you just TELL them she&#39;s awful, they might remember their <br/>
fondest parts, and begin to think maybe it&#39;s just personal between the two of <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t much like their grandmothers, either of them.  But if I NEVER <br/>
let them see them, they would have fonder grandmother images and think they <br/>
were missing something.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly offered  yesterday to go with just her dad to his parents&#39; house at <br/>
Thanksgiving, because, she said, I don&#39;t like to go, but that way Keith can <br/>
go, and she wouldn&#39;t mind.  We had already decided to do a whole family <br/>
thing, but ONLY for one overnight.  I can handle that.  And the grandparents <br/>
haven&#39;t seen Kirby for over a year now, and we have an obligation of sorts to <br/>
present him for inspection.  He&#39;s way bigger than they&#39;ll have remembered.  <br/>
He was out of town the last time they came here, and he skipped on a family <br/>
outing at a lake (being at an anime convention).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Please Nancy. People like this do not get better, they get worse. Think <br/>

<br/>
I agree with this. And so my recommendations are more along the lines of <br/>
taking the kids to the zoo to see how big mountains lions really are, and how <br/>
strong rattle snakes and bears really are so they&#39;ll know what to watch out <br/>
for if they&#39;re out hiking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like this, (showing grandma as a caution sign idea) we (Darin and I) have <br/>
decided to only visit her as a family, and that she won&#39;t ever be invited <br/>
here. Now our problem is Moly has been sick to her stomach all day, she feels <br/>
like something wrong has happened (it has) and that it is her fault (it <br/>
isn&#39;t). She said she knew what they did was wrong, I told her she and Jack <br/>
didn&#39;t do anything wrong, their grandma did, but since grandma told them not <br/>
to tell me, that this should all just be their little secret, Moly feels bad. <br/>
I can fix the MIL problem, I am having a hard time fixing Moly&#39;s feelings. <br/>
:o( Grandma&#39;s &quot;lets keep this our little secret&quot; crap is snarky and reminds <br/>
me of what child molesters say to little kids, to keep them quiet. How am I <br/>
going to fix Moly&#39;s feelings of guilt? I guess it is just going to take time, <br/>
and love.<br/>
