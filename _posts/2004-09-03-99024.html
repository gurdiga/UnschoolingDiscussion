<div id="ygrps-yiv-700716835">My 8 year old daughter gets $12  every 2 weeks.  The dollar amount is what I can afford out of our budget.

<br/>
Right now, her allowance is not tied to anything.  I keep hearing that I &quot;should&quot; from family, etc...  I don&#39;t have a reason why it&#39;s not tied to her helping around the house or anything... It&#39;s just the way I started.

It sounds to me, though, that on this list the idea that it should be tied to helping around the house is an awful thing to do.  I was wondering what is so wrong with requiring a certain task or tasks be done in order to &quot;earn&quot; money?  If I don&#39;t work at my job and do the tasks they request/require of me, then I don&#39;t get paid.  Period.  I don&#39;t have money just falling out of the sky at me, or someone handing it to me just because.  I get money by getting up, going to work, doing my job, and then coming home and preparing for the next day.  <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I don&#39;t think tying her allowance to certain responsibilities around the house will make her a better person or teach her some kind of &quot;lesson&quot;.  But, I was just wondering why it would be so awful.  I guess I don&#39;t understand.<br/>

work, doing my job, and then coming home and preparing for the next<br/>
day. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, for us the money that comes in is family money and they are part of<br/>
the family so we share.  I do lots of work around the house, though I am not<br/>
paid for any of it.  If my husband, as the person earning the money, had a<br/>
list of things that I had to get done that week before I could have any<br/>
money to spend at my discretion, I&#39;d be pretty resentful.  I&#39;d look at the<br/>
jobs as painful duties to get done.  It takes away my choice to do those<br/>
tasks of my own volition and for my own motivations ... it would kill the<br/>
joy of participating in the household.<br/>
<br/>
Tying allowance to chores makes the tasks seem icky and something to avoid,<br/>
not as things that help the household run more smoothly.  Maybe the<br/>
bathrooms or the vacuuming can slide for another few days in favour of<br/>
something else.  It helps them see that work around the home can be done<br/>
when a person sees it needs doing and they choose to do it.  Not to do it<br/>
just because it&#39;s Saturday or just because if they don&#39;t then they don&#39;t get<br/>
their allowance.  That&#39;s just not &quot;reality&quot;.  When they have their own apt /<br/>
home they don&#39;t *have to* do the household tasks on Saturday (or whatever<br/>
day).  And nobody is going to pay them to get them done.  I look at my<br/>
motivations for getting stuff done around the house and try to share that<br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
And the money/allowance itself, with no strings attached, gives them the<br/>
opportunity to learn how to make good money decisions.  And by good I don&#39;t<br/>
mean the decisions I would necessarily make, but decisions that are based on<br/>
their own observations and experiences and that work out well for them.  And<br/>
at a time in their lives where we (the parents) are around to share our<br/>
experiences and talk to them about theirs.  It gives them the opportunity to<br/>
get to know themselves ... are they a spender, a saver, something inbetween?<br/>
And the chance to try on all these different &quot;hats&quot;.  Just understanding<br/>
themselves around money will help them to make better decisions as they grow<br/>
older and get more of an independent income.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488270355">Hi all~ I&#39;m new to the list and haven&#39;t intro&#39;d yet.  I&#39;ll get to that<br/>
soon, but I wanted to comment here.  Our 13 yo works for us.  We were<br/>
looking into hiring a cleaning person when I became pregnant so that I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to think about such things.  After a few interviews he<br/>
came to us and proposed that we give him the job.  He had a whole list<br/>
of reasons why he would be better than a stranger.  He now cleans 2<br/>
mornings a week and we pay him 100.00 a month (works out to about 8.50<br/>
an hr depending on how he feels that day).  This is his money.  We pay<br/>
for all his extracurricular stuff, clothing, fun stuff, etc.Though, he<br/>
is going to Italy in March and we&#39;ve asked him to raise the money he<br/>
will need for food and spending.  That is only about 1/3 of the cost of<br/>
the trip, so not totally unrealistic.  We would pay for it all, only we<br/>
can&#39;t really even afford the trip to begin with, so any help he can give<br/>
will make our financial lives easier.  We don&#39;t give our children an<br/>
allowance only because we are very bad at remembering such things.  They<br/>
just get what they need/want (within reason) when it arises.  If he ever<br/>
wants to stop being the cleaning person he is free to do so and I remind<br/>
him of this often, especially when he seems to be dragging his feet and<br/>
not really wanting to do the work.<br/>
Just my .02.  I&#39;ll go back to feeling out the list now and send an intro<br/>
in a few days.<br/>
With care,<br/>
Angel<br/>

&#39;Many would sooner die than think. In fact, they do.&#39;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Why should what kids get for money be compared to a job? You didn&#39;t hire them, you can&#39;t fire them. They&#39;re family, not employees. Would it be fair for a husband to not give his SAH wife spending money because she didn&#39;t wash the floor?<br/>
  Nevermind that it&#39;s not true that performance and wages are so intimately linked. I&#39;ve had jobs where I slacked off for a day but I still got a days wages. <br/>
  Your kids don&#39;t get money just because. They get it because they&#39;re part of the family and that&#39;s one of the perks of being part of the family. <br/>
  I think I don&#39;t like it because it confuses work and family. It also makes a bit of a fetish of money I think, all this doing chores to get the bucks instead of it simply being another tool in a persons toolbox.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, our kids are expected to help out.  I know that flies in the face of<br/>
what a lot of people post on this list.<br/>
<br/>
We really, truly tried the &quot;do it only if you want to, no pressure&quot; way for<br/>
over 2 years.  It worked quite well initially but then the kids started<br/>
slacking off.  There were many other things much more interesting than<br/>
picking up the toys or putting laundry away.  I found myself doing it more<br/>
and more and more.<br/>
<br/>
We have 5 kids, 3 of whom are old enough for activities.  Their activities<br/>
are very time consuming, with daily practices, competitions requiring us to<br/>
be out of town almost every weekend of the year, daily care of many, many<br/>
animals, etc..  In other words, the things they are wanting to do requires<br/>
many hours of my time each day.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is far from clean at any time.  But when I was trying to not have<br/>
the kids do anything they didn&#39;t want to do, I was having to get up before<br/>
dawn and was still working at 9 or 10 at night.  I was exhausted, running<br/>
myself into the ground.  I had things I also wanted to do, like read<br/>
occassionally, study plants, etc. but there was no time.   I would find<br/>
myself occassionally just losing it in crying fits on the kids, just from<br/>
being overwhelmed.  Along with all of this, my dh travels a lot with his job<br/>
so it was just me to try to meet everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
So I decided to take care of myself.  The kids&#39; activities aren&#39;t exactly<br/>
tied to housework.  But I pointed out the number of hours I spend helping<br/>
them meet their goals each day and I pointed out how asking them to spend<br/>
about 15 minutes a day simply picking up after themselves didn&#39;t seem out of<br/>
line.<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t required to do set things but in response to the many things I<br/>
do for them, I ask them to to spend a few minutes helping me out.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that I never pick up their dirty clothes, it doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
I threaten them with lack of activities.....It means that in our house,<br/>
relationships are based on give and take.<br/>

&gt; wage.  I&#39;d LOVE to pay my kids to clean.  But one isn&#39;t interested and the<br/>
&gt; others are too young.  If it is a job that they make a deal to do for<br/>
&gt; money, then great.  But to require it as a requirement for being a part of<br/>
&gt; the family, no.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316952975">How have you handled unschooling and guardianship when doing your wills?<br/>
Other than trying to find the best match for your kids, do you relinquish<br/>
control over how they would be educated, or do you hold discussions with the<br/>
guardian about unschooling and your philosophies?  It&#39;s sometimes hard<br/>
enough just to find a prospective guardian among family and friends, someone<br/>
who shares your general approaches about parenting (perhaps not spanking,<br/>
for example).<br/>
<br/>
It would seem natural and important to talk with the guardian about your<br/>
parenting style and agree that the guardian will try to provide a<br/>
continuity, especially in the beginning when the child is adjusting to the<br/>
loss of the parent.  For example, the guardian might bring a youngster into<br/>
his/her bed if that&#39;s what the child is used to and if the child has that<br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
But how nitty-gritty do you get when it comes to more specific things, such<br/>
as unschooling (though to me unschooling is not simply a way of education<br/>
but an attitude toward life, to someone else not yet involved in it, it may<br/>
seem to be just a specific way of schooling)?<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, I feel strongly about unschooling as well as my other parenting<br/>
paths.  On the other hand I recognize that if something happens and my dh<br/>
and I are killed, the most important thing is that the kids are with loving<br/>
family and friends who will help them through the trauma, even if the most<br/>
loving and supporting family members aren&#39;t the ones who are invested in<br/>
educational philosophies.<br/>
<br/>
And this may be just one more self-imposed roadblock to completing my will<br/>
and guardian information.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
I think if you can find someone who&#39;s already unschooling or who&#39;d be willing <br/>
and able to, that&#39;s a possibility.   But wills only assign things, generally, <br/>
and can&#39;t put restrictions on how people can live their lives.  It could put <br/>
restrictions on how money could be spent, and so maybe if there&#39;s money it <br/>
could be flagged for paying someone to stay with the kids in their own house and <br/>
continuing to unschool.  That could use fat mortgage insurance, too, so the <br/>
house might be paid off by the parents&#39; deaths.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could ask that if the kids were old enough to be home alone that <br/>
they not be required to attend school.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868241375">I have nothing to offer to people to help them with this issue - if you <br/>
saw my house you&#39;d know why. But I understand and identify with what <br/>
Julie wrote. Maybe the house cleaning issue is much more difficult for <br/>
those of us who don&#39;t spend much time at home. I know that when we have <br/>
a few days where we&#39;re going to be home, all of us know that and like <br/>
to get things cleaned up a bit so that we&#39;ll have a more orderly, <br/>
spacious kind of living space. But most of the time we are just SO on <br/>
the go, we use our house as a waystation, really, and it is just run <br/>
in, take a shower, have something to eat, change clothes, grab a little <br/>
computer time, or collapse because we&#39;re worn out from all our <br/>
activities. The house gets the LOWEST priority from all of us and it <br/>
shows.<br/>
<br/>
I have been not requiring any chores from the kids for YEARS. They <br/>
sometimes help unsolicited and sometimes I ask for help as in: &quot;Can you <br/>
unload the dishwasher while I&#39;m in the shower and then you can have a <br/>
shower while I fold some of this pile of laundry?&quot; Or, as I&#39;m running <br/>
out the door, I might ask a kid whose being left home to clear off the <br/>
pile of stuff on the dining table while I&#39;m gone. And - they&#39;ll do it <br/>
when I ask. No complaining - totally cheerfully. But it isn&#39;t close to <br/>
remotely enough help to allow me to do all the driving and going to <br/>
activities that they want to do and still have my own life and grocery <br/>
shop and make meals and all that and STILL have a house that isn&#39;t just <br/>
a big huge awful mess most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Not even close. My kids and I have GREAT relationships - and they&#39;re <br/>
nice, helpful kids. But I am tired of the mess and they are really <br/>
messy. And I am the one tired of it and the one who is getting <br/>
resentful because I am the one who cares, but I can&#39;t keep up and can&#39;t <br/>
clean up enough behind them and still do the other things I want to do. <br/>
Frustrated, I am.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; those of us who don&#39;t spend much time at home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know, we spend most of our time at home and it&#39;s a huge issue <br/>
for us too.  Maybe it&#39;s more of a personality thing?  I think some <br/>
women have more of a &quot;nesting&quot; instinct.  I remember being at a <br/>
Christian women&#39;s conference and they were talking about how women <br/>
have a natural instinct to &quot;nest&quot; by having things &quot;just so&quot; in their <br/>
house, but men just drop thing wherever and don&#39;t care about their <br/>
atmosphere.  That&#39;s a bit of a stereotype but it does seem to have a <br/>
lot of truth to it when I look at irl women I know.  I know LOTS of <br/>
women who just can&#39;t rest or think in a house that&#39;s messy.  But <br/>
somehow I seemed to miss out on some of that &quot;nesting&quot; instinct.  I <br/>
would like it to not be messy, but I&#39;m not willing or able to do the <br/>
amount of work required to keep things neat all the time.  I would <br/>
love to challenge flylady to come to my home and keep up with my <br/>
boys&#39; messes. ;)  But her solution would probably be to constantly <br/>
tell them they can&#39;t make such big messes.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you considered hiring someone?  I&#39;m seriously considering it.  <br/>
Once a week maybe, just to scrub down the kitchen and diningroom <br/>
really well.  Other rooms would be too hard for a cleaning person to <br/>
do, because the problem is stuff--toys and papers and stuff that no <br/>
one outside of the family would know what to do with it all. For <br/>
example, I know that the yellow construction paper that&#39;s been run <br/>
through the shredder is Luke&#39;s &quot;spaghetti&quot;, but a cleaning lady might <br/>
think it&#39;s garbage and throw it away.  But if the kitchen and <br/>
diningroom got done really well once a week, that would be really <br/>
nice and would free up more of my time as well. <br/>
<br/>
My mom recently hired someone to help her clean her house and she&#39;s <br/>
happy with her, so last night I emailed her and asked her for the <br/>
name and number of the person who cleans for her.   I&#39;ve wanted to <br/>
for awhile but didn&#39;t out of guilt, feeling that I should be able to <br/>
handle cleaning and that it&#39;s not showing my kids how to live in the <br/>
real world if they don&#39;t see me doing all the cleaning myself, etc.  <br/>
But now I&#39;m at the point where I figure that my family and I have <br/>
LOTS of strengths.  Cleaning and not being messy just aren&#39;t among <br/>
those strengths.  Some people ARE really good at it, and want to earn <br/>
money doing it, so by hiring them we&#39;re supporting them and helping <br/>
ourselves too.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are really messy too.  So messy that they can make messes in <br/>
1/2 an hour that take me at least 3 hours to clean up.  Seriously.  <br/>
For example, when I was packing the car for the conference I needed <br/>
the stapler to staple my mapquest directions.  It wasn&#39;t on the <br/>
shelf.  So I asked the boys where it was and they said it was in <br/>
their &quot;library&quot;.  They had been playing library and had assorted <br/>
paper, staples, pens, tape, etc. by a bookshelf.  There were at least <br/>
100 kids&#39; books all over the floor in that area and it took me an <br/>
hour to put them back on the shelf, sort garbage paper from paper <br/>
that can still be used, etc. until I made my way far enough into the <br/>
pile to find the stapler.  They probably had been playing library for <br/>
an hour and I spent an hour cleaning up enough to find the stapler <br/>
and never did get it cleaned up before the conference (and STILL <br/>
haven&#39;t gotten it cleaned up and now there&#39;s more mess added to the <br/>
room.)  Now added to that in addition to the usual array of toys, <br/>
papers, magazines etc strewn around the floor, is yarn.  Lots and <br/>
lots of yarn, because they tied the room up in a &quot;spider web&quot; and <br/>
when they were done they cut the spider web apart and left the string <br/>
there.  If I ask them to help me clean the stuff up they usually say <br/>
no, no matter how joyfully I ask them.  So it stays a mess or I stay <br/>
up real late or get up real early to get it done, and I get tired and <br/>
cranky.  Adding a 1 year old lab puppy who joyfully plays with two <br/>
young boys doesn&#39;t help keep things neat either.  The mess my boys <br/>
can make is magnified considerably when they start playing with the <br/>
dog.  It&#39;s unbelievable, because of course when that dog gets excited <br/>
and runs around, just his wagging tail can wipe everything off of the <br/>
coffeetable in 5 seconds! lol Give them half an hour and the room is <br/>
trashed.  I&#39;m just hoping that as they get older they&#39;ll start making <br/>
less messes.  When they&#39;re 15 and 17, maybe they won&#39;t find joy in <br/>
turning styrofoam into snow that covers the whole downstairs. &lt;g&gt;  If <br/>
*I* can last that long!   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that you think your messes are because you&#39;re not at <br/>
home (different kinds of messes I realize, because your kids are of <br/>
different ages and genders and personalities), because for awhile I <br/>
thought my solution would be trying to get them out more where they <br/>
could make messes and it wouldn&#39;t require hours and hours of cleaning <br/>
afterwards.  Like outdoors places to play with rocks and sticks and <br/>
leaves that it didn&#39;t matter where they ended up, or maybe going <br/>
frequently to playgrounds or children&#39;s museums.  But they don&#39;t <br/>
really want much of that--they make themselves pretty clear that they <br/>
just want to be home.  <br/>
<br/>
So my current hope for staying sane is the possibility of hiring <br/>
someone once a week. :) <br/>

<br/>
Yet, I think my kids like it when the house is cleaned up.  They just <br/>
don&#39;t want to be the ones to clean it.  I don&#39;t either for that <br/>
matter, but I suck it up and do it and try really hard not to be <br/>
resentful.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, today my 7 year old spilled ketchup on the carpet while <br/>
I was sitting next to him playing a game with his sister.  He told me <br/>
he needed a napkin.  I told him they were in on the diningroom <br/>
table.  He said, &quot;Why can&#39;t you get it?&quot;  and I said, &quot;Because I&#39;m in <br/>
the middle of a game&quot; and he said, &quot;No, you get it&quot;.  So I stopped <br/>
playing the game for a minute, got up and got him his napkin and <br/>
cleaned it for him.  If I hadn&#39;t, he wouldn&#39;t have either, and we <br/>
would have had a nasty, icky stain on the carpet.  It makes me feel <br/>
like more of a servant than a mom sometimes, but the only other <br/>
solution I can see is either shaming them or yelling or telling <br/>
him, &quot;Either you clean that up or... (punishment).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590505784">I do not think your issue has anything to do with your being a woman, but that in people taking personal responsibility. I personally believe that home schooling in part is about basic home making skills, and that includes cleaning. I make cleaning a viable home school activity in my home. I tell my two teens that these *are* their chores for the day. If they do not do them they lose basic privileges. I have even gone to the extent of making them lose their right to eat if they do not do what they are supposed to. The fact is learning to take care of one&#39;s home is the first step to self responsibility, and I cannot see that it is not an imperative life skill. I think we rob them of the opportunity to be self reliant if we do everything for them, and we teach them that others are there to merely *serve* them. I have used the approach of *you earn what you get* since they were very young, but it is something that requires constant reinforcement. It may seem tiring after a time reinforcing, and you feel like you would just rather do it yourself, but eventually it will pay off. My son did the dishes badly on purpose for several years, figuring it would get him out of doing them. Eventually though he came to realize that it was he that was suffering also in doing so! He now does them quite well, and he really does care. The lack of children caring about their immediate environ is surely indicative that they are feeling a lack of self esteem in themselves, and it is important to really be encouraging and supportive in all that they do right. I have found nagging does not work, only action...immediate action. Do it, or else...and stick to the *or else*. As soon as you give them a way out, they will take it. Eventually they will find it takes more effort to not do what they should be doing, than doing the act it&#39;s self. Children need some measure of discipline, and eventually it will engrain enough into them that it is no longer needed to such a degree. I often utilize a message board, and list the daily chores there. Also, it is important to give a time period that is acceptable to get them done. For example, all chores must be done by 5 p.m., etc.                           Blessings & Namaste!<br/>

It&#39;s cheaper than a counsellor, probably (or the same, but you get a cleaner <br/>

<br/>
Some people can&#39;t carry a tune, some aren&#39;t good cooks, some aren&#39;t gardeners <br/>
(and their houseplants die) and some can&#39;t sew on a button.  Some can&#39;t keep <br/>
house, but they&#39;re really great at inspiring and helping teens to do Girl <br/>
Scouts and 4-H and theatre, and explaining mathematics to people who really want <br/>
to know, and at keeping in-person support groups going for years, and inspiring <br/>
people all around them.  Pam Sorooshian is, anyway.  I&#39;ve seen her house.  I <br/>

&gt; can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; support the line that only the person who cares about cleanliness <br/>
&gt; should <br/>
&gt; &gt; have to clean.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But if the people who don&#39;t care about cleanliness are forced to <br/>
&gt; clean, how is that different than having them be forced to do <br/>
&gt; schoolwork, or eat food they don&#39;t like?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope there&#39;s an answer somewhere in between! My dh cares much, much <br/>
more about the house being clean and picked up than I do. To me, it&#39;s <br/>
nice when it&#39;s clean, but I have other priorities. Like sleep. <br/>
<br/>
I respect that it&#39;s important to him and since I&#39;m kinda fond of him, <br/>
I try to help meet his need for cleanliness. Since I&#39;m home with the <br/>
kids all day while he&#39;s out at work, I do more cleaning up than he <br/>
does. (But I used to get really annoyed when he would pick up his <br/>
stuff and have the attitude of &quot;the rest is your problem.&quot; Ummm, <br/>
that&#39;s not the way to get me into the mood of wanting to help you <br/>
with YOUR need for a clean house, which is your mother&#39;s fault <br/>
because she cared a lot more about the house than about the <br/>
kids...but I digress. We&#39;ve worked this out, mostly.)<br/>
<br/>
We have someone come and clean most of the house (just not the <br/>
bedrooms because we&#39;re never in them except to sleep, so they don&#39;t <br/>
get dirty very quickly). They come every two weeks. The best part <br/>
about it for me is that I&#39;m motivated to pick up the living room and <br/>
kitchen so that they can clean the whole rug, etc.! <br/>
<br/>
Maybe when I grow up I&#39;ll learn to motivate myself, but for now, I&#39;m <br/>
okay with the outside motivation of dh&#39;s wants and the cleaning <br/>
service&#39;s need. Since I stopped even asking ds to clean up with me, <br/>
but mentioned the &quot;clean slate&quot; concept, he&#39;s occasionally really <br/>
helpful and often a bit helpful. Dd seems to have gotten dh&#39;s <br/>
cleaning genes, but maybe she&#39;ll grow out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, all my &quot;things work well here&quot; bs is from before I got <br/>
pregnant. Now (12 weeks and 3 days, but who&#39;s counting) the place is <br/>
so messy I can barely stand it. I do have a need to not step on toys <br/>
all the time. And I agree with the comment about how long it takes to <br/>
clean up. It&#39;s unbelievable.<br/>
<br/>

minutes and not worry about how big a job it is</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191435262">I am an unschooler, and have unschooled my children for their whole lives. Yes they are teens now, but they weren&#39;t always. Unschooling in my opinion is not an excuse to not teach values and responsibility. I refuse to live in a pig pen at the expense of giving my children the freedom to be slobs. *Or else* means... or else you won&#39;t get to play video games, go out and see your friends, eat dinner with the rest of the family, or whatever works in the case of the individual. My children set their own hours, they do what they want for their schooling, they have almost 100% freedom to do as they choose...but they must learn that they are not royalty born with a silver spoon hanging out of their mouth, and that they can&#39;t walk all over their providers. I think that not requiring children to do their part is teaching them that they never have to give if they do not want to. In my opinion this creates very selfish children who care little about the needs of others. I told my son about this debate, he is 14, and he wants to know what makes the parents have to clean? What if we all just decided to screw it, we don&#39;t want to clean...then who in the heck does the cleaning?????? We are not all able to afford maid service, and I certainly think living in filth and chaos is not a viable way of raising children. If my child *ever* told me to go do it myself, when it was sometihng that was *their* responsibility, I would definitely realize there was a serious problem going on that was only going to get worse. Almost all animals in the animal kingdom require some amount of training, and almost all animals are taught to maintain proper hygiene of themselves and their environ. What is to stop such children from soiling other people&#39;s homes when visiting, or throwing trash on the ground in public places? If they do not have to take care of themselves at home, why would they anywhere else? I am done with this discussion, it is really not my business to tell others how to raise their children. I was merely giving my perspective as to how *I* raise my children. It has worked for me, and that is what is important.             Blessings & Namaste!<br/>

&gt; Oh dear. Did I forget to mention that when we ARE at home, that <br/>

&gt; singing at the tops of their voices is number one, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>

&gt; origami, spinning, weaving, knitting, crocheting --- these are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>always <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, say they&#39;re doing origami.  What happens with the paper scraps?  <br/>
With the paper and scissors when they&#39;re done with the project?   If <br/>
they pull a piece of paper off of the shelf and 2 fall off with it <br/>
accidentally and land on the floor, do they pick them up or just <br/>
leave them there?  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what we&#39;re dealing with at our house right now.  This <br/>
conversation is very timely because dh and I have been talking it <br/>
through.  The level of messiness bothers him a lot.  He pointed out <br/>
that when I do a big cleanup of a room I throw a lot away, sometimes <br/>
throwing away as much garbage as I pick up toys.  He wants to go to <br/>
the kids and ask if we could at least just throw away garbage when <br/>
we&#39;re done with it.  Not just them, but all of us, for the purpose of <br/>
the whole household running more smoothly.  *I* sometimes don&#39;t throw <br/>
away a wrapper when I&#39;m done with it right away but wait until a <br/>
cleanup session and clean it all up, but that doesn&#39;t work anymore <br/>
with 5 people leaving stuff behind, because it&#39;s me being the one to <br/>
go behind and do huge cleanup sessions for everyone and it&#39;s just too <br/>
much for one person.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked him what we will do if we remind them and they say, &quot;No, I <br/>
don&#39;t want to throw it away&quot; or &quot;You do it for me&quot;, and he said he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know.  They don&#39;t respond that way to them, at least not very <br/>
often.  They&#39;re more likely to respond that way to me.  He pointed <br/>
out that when he takes them swimming, they all just take the noodles <br/>
and pool equipment out of the pool when they&#39;re done.  When they <br/>
finish riding their bikes, they just automatically bring their bikes <br/>
up onto the sidewalk or at least ask an adult to help them do it. No <br/>
one makes them do those things, no one threatens or yells or sets up <br/>
chore charts or anything to get them to do it, they just do because <br/>
of the matter of fact way he has of &quot;let&#39;s put all the toys from the <br/>
pool up on the deck&quot; way that he has.  So why do they just leave <br/>
garbage all over the place in the house?  Probably my bad example and <br/>
my needing to learn more about not setting myself up as servant.  Not <br/>
that mothers shouldn&#39;t serve their kids, but in my desparate attempts <br/>
to be the perfect mother I somehow managed to portray too much of a <br/>
servant-view of myself to the point where they didn&#39;t know who I was <br/>
or what I was interested in because all I did was serve them and <br/>
ignore my own needs.  But healing and balance is happening, and it&#39;s <br/>
nice to see progress being made. :)  So anyway, I said to dh that it <br/>
might be better if *he* be the one to do most of the reminding about <br/>
throwing trash away for awhile at least, because he&#39;s more natural <br/>
about it.  He understands the reason because we&#39;ve talked it through <br/>
thoroughly and he&#39;s willing to not yell and scream and threaten <br/>
because he sees clearly now where the problem started and what needs <br/>
to be done to get us back on the right track.  What a great guy! :) <br/>

Threats and punishments may get the house clean but I&#39;m more interested in providing tools to solve problems.  I don&#39;t want the tool my kids take away from growing up to be threats and punishment.  I&#39;d much rather them learn to listen and genuinely care about the people around them and learn to live in community with them.  This is what works in my family.  <br/>

---------<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, those aren&#39;t the only two choices.<br/>
<br/>
-=- *Or else* means... or else you won&#39;t get to play video games, go out and <br/>
see your friends, eat dinner with the rest of the family, or whatever works in <br/>
the case of the individual.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Withholding food goes against many principles, not the least of which is <br/>
people can&#39;t feel safe or learn unless their basic physical needs are met.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My children set their own hours, they do what they want for their <br/>
schooling,-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they have &quot;schooling&quot; at all, perhaps your vision of unschooling is not <br/>
what the people on this list have been used to.  It really does help when <br/>
someone comes onto the list if they read for a while to see what the tone of the <br/>
list is.<br/>
<br/>
-=but they must learn that they are not royalty born with a silver spoon <br/>
hanging out of their mouth, and that they can&#39;t walk all over their providers.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This harsh language/indication of thought seems unlikely to create warmth <br/>
within a home.<br/>
Priorities are different in different families, but in any case in which the <br/>
children&#39;s self esteem is a higher priority than cleanliness, the statements <br/>
above will seem foreign and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
There are many families with helpful children, teens who are not &quot;walking all <br/>
over their providers,&quot; where the withholding of food has never been <br/>
considered.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I think that not requiring children to do their part is teaching them <br/>
that . . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
Requiring and teaching neither are necessary for learning.<br/>
If learning is a higher priority than teaching or requirements, the whole <br/>
point of view changes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think that not requiring children to do their part is teaching them that <br/>
they never have to give if they do not want to. In my opinion this creates <br/>
very selfish children who care little about the needs of others.-=-<br/>
<br/>
In your opinion that would create selfish children?<br/>
In my *experience* it does not.<br/>
<br/>
If an environment is created in which children WANT to be helpful and kind <br/>
and generous, then they are not giving what they do not want to give, and yet <br/>
they can still be helpful and kind and generous.<br/>
<br/>
There are people here who spent much of last weekend with my two younger <br/>
children, who are 12 and 15.  As far as I know, they were both helpful and kind <br/>
and generous.  I required nothing of them.  They gave much.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I told my son about this debate, he is 14, and he wants to know what makes <br/>
the parents have to clean? What if we all just decided to screw it, we don&#39;t <br/>
want to clean...then who in the heck does the cleaning??????-=-<br/>
<br/>
Parents clean because they want to.  You do NOT have to clean.  You are <br/>
choosing that over the alternative.  Some parents don&#39;t want to clean, and so they <br/>
try to force their children to do it.  That&#39;s not illegal nor in most people&#39;s <br/>
 minds immoral.  But there are other options.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If my child *ever* told me to go do it myself, when it was sometihng that <br/>
was *their* responsibility, I would definitely realize there was a serious <br/>
problem going on that was only going to get worse. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I see the provision of food and shelter the responsibility of the parent, and <br/>
when I see a parent telling children to do it themselves, I expect (from <br/>
experience) that the problem will get worse.  Some children become resentful or <br/>
sneaky.  Some cannot wait to get out of the house so they can make their own <br/>
rules and make their own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My son did the dishes badly on purpose for several years, figuring it <br/>
would get him out of doing them. Eventually though he came to realize that it was <br/>
he that was suffering also in doing so!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he was too young to do them well.<br/>
If the purpose of clean dishes is the safety of the family from germs, then <br/>
they should be clean, and that is not the responsibility of a child.  If dishes <br/>
are cleaned for the purpose of training children to clean and there is no <br/>
other purpose, then I think people should use paper plates and not torment one <br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What is to stop such children from soiling other people&#39;s homes when <br/>
visiting, or throwing trash on the ground in public places?-=-<br/>
<br/>
My children pick up other people&#39;s trash, and they do not soil other people&#39;s <br/>
homes when visiting.  They tend to leave places cleaner than they found them, <br/>
in subtle ways or large.  Yet I have never withheld food or video games from <br/>
them.  So there is another way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If they do not have to take care of themselves at home, why would they <br/>
anywhere else?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good question, and in the context of principles being more important <br/>
than rules, the answer is obvious.<br/>
