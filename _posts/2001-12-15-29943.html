<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821074201">Exuse This House<br/>
<br/>
Some houses try to hide the fact<br/>
That children shelter there.<br/>
Ours boasts of it quite openly,<br/>
the signs are everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
For smears are on the windows,<br/>
Little smudges on the door...<br/>
I should apologize I guess,<br/>
for toys strewn on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
But, I sat down with the children<br/>
And played and laughed and read...<br/>
And if the doorbell doesn&#39;t shine,<br/>
their eyes will shine instead.<br/>
<br/>
For when at times, I&#39;m forced to <br/>
choose one job or the other,<br/>
It&#39;s good to be a housewife...<br/>
But I&#39;d rather be a MOTHER.<br/>

My neighbor gave me this poem a few days ago. I really<br/>
like it and remember it when I see all the different<br/>
smears in our house. I think of it everytime I open a<br/>
closet door or a dresser drawer in my house because<br/>
every where there is a place to wrap or attach yarn or<br/>
ribbons they are wrapped attached somehow by my 6yo<br/>
dd.<br/>
