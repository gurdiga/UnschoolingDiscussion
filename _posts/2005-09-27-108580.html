<div id="ygrps-yiv-595491193">On my last trip to the library, I grabbed several music CDs in the children&#39;s section.  One is titled: Big Blues - Blues Music For Kids.<br/>
<br/>
It has the song, &quot;Funky Bluesy ABC&#39;s&quot; by Taj Mahal.  Fun!<br/>

Cleaning and cooking can wait for tomorrow,<br/>
For babies grow up, I&#39;ve learned, to my sorrow.<br/>
So quiet down, cobwebs, dust, go to sleep.<br/>
I&#39;m rocking my baby, and babies don&#39;t keep.<br/>
