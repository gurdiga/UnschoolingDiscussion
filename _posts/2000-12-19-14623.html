remember something in Do Not Disturb, I was forewarned <br/>
before I read CC *grin) might have something, I haven&#39;t <br/>
read it through yet.  She spoke at the LLL European <br/>
Conference, about &#39;What Makes a Good Night&#39;s Sleep?&#39; <br/>
and was talking about it, and there was an article <br/>
reprinted from The Montessori Courier in the LLL(GB)&#39;s <br/>
Leader&#39;s and Leader Applicant&#39;s newsletter, Feedback, <br/>
earlier this year after a Leader wrote in about the <br/>
Continuum Concept, which she found &#39;horrible.&#39;  I have <br/>
no idea if you&#39;d be able to find it online!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851712989">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering about anyone&#39;s experience with &quot;Music Together&quot; classes. They<br/>
are being offered in our area for the first time. I&#39;ve long been intrigued<br/>
based on what I&#39;ve read, but before I plunk down my money I&#39;d love to hear<br/>
pros and cons from anyone out there. How much does class success depend on<br/>
the individual teacher? Is there an optimimum class size (ie. too few and<br/>
not enough fun energy, too many and too much chaos)? My kids are five and<br/>
2.3 and I&#39;d want to take them together. Also, we sing and dance around here<br/>
almost constantly -- I&#39;m interested in the class more for the fun of the<br/>
experience together and with other kids than for the music education, though<br/>
if we get some of that that&#39;s great, too.<br/>
<br/>
To broaden the topic a bit, how do you unschoolers feel in general about<br/>
&quot;extracurricular&quot; such as Girls Scouts, 4-H, gymnastics classes, art<br/>
classes, etc. The last thing I want to do is clutter up our schedule, but,<br/>
for us, it seems the occasional class would give us some variety, plus give<br/>
us a chance to be together with some of the other kids in our area and<br/>
develop some friendships. We are very rural and friendship opportunities do<br/>
need to be created; we can&#39;t just go out and play with the neighborhood<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any information,<br/>
<br/>
