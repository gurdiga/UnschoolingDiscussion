Does that mean you never introduce anything new to your kids to see <br/>
wether or not they are interested?  And if so, I really screwed up <br/>
when I bought my kids some books.  After all, when my son was a <br/>
little baby he never asked for a book or to be read to but I bought <br/>
books and read them. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter never asked me to make peanutbutter cookies with her, but <br/>
when I asked her to make them with me she loved it and now asks to <br/>
make them all the time.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter did not ask to play with playdough, she didn&#39;t know what <br/>
it was or that it even existed, but when I bought her some and opened <br/>
it up for her, she loved it and asks to play with it often.  <br/>
<br/>
I could go on but I won&#39;t.  Everyone&#39;s *unschool* is different. My <br/>
family and I went to Kansas City&#39;s Learnapalooza and one of the <br/>
speakers at the conference told me she had a workbook junky.  She is <br/>
an unschooler and wasn&#39;t used to doing workbooks.  She didn&#39;t even <br/>
like to do them.  But somewhere along the line her daughter got a <br/>
hold of one and loves them.  The same has happened in our family. My <br/>
daughter enjoys what we do together.  If she didn&#39;t like doing it or <br/>
if it didn&#39;t interest her then we wouldn&#39;t be doing it.  She hates <br/>
sounding out words, but she has all the skills to do so ~ she learned <br/>
them through doing her workbooks.  I don&#39;t push her to read.  She <br/>
sits with down with a book and makes up her own stories and I love it.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was a year old I taught him how to sign a few words to <br/>
make communicating his needs easier for him.  If that means I am <br/>
unschooling wrong, then I am unschooling wrong.  All I know is that I <br/>
am doing what is right for my family.  <br/>

<br/>
If there are no similarities, no common thread, then there is nothing to <br/>
name.   If by everyone&#39;s unschool is different you mean that everything in the <br/>
world is equally valid and equally unschooling, that doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Many things are NOT unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
-=I have to ask, what is unschooling? -=-<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
There&#39;s what I think it is.<br/>
Here are some other people&#39;s ideas, too:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/definition.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/definition.html</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-Isn&#39;t it child lead learning?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not as I see it.<br/>
Neither is it parent-led learning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s maintaining a lifestyle in which learning flourishes.<br/>
<br/>
-=Does that mean you never introduce anything new to your kids to see <br/>
<br/>
wether or not they are interested? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No one has ever said that here (except people who are new to unschooling and <br/>
being critical or snarky).<br/>
<br/>
-=-And if so, I really screwed up <br/>
<br/>
when I bought my kids some books.  After all, when my son was a <br/>
<br/>
little baby he never asked for a book or to be read to but I bought <br/>
<br/>
books and read them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you honestly think there are people who didn&#39;t buy books for their young <br/>
children here?  Does your sarcasm have a good purpose, or are you just being <br/>
defensive?<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about things that work, with natural learning in mind.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My daughter did not ask to play with playdough, she didn&#39;t know what <br/>
<br/>
it was or that it even existed, but when I bought her some and opened <br/>
<br/>
it up for her, she loved it and asks to play with it often.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I could go on but I won&#39;t.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever bought something for your husband or a friend or a sibling <br/>
because you thought they would enjoy it, and then they did?  Have you ever made <br/>
food for someone because you thought they would like it, and then they did?  <br/>
Probably everyone here has.  That&#39;s not unschooling.  That&#39;s thoughtfulness and <br/>
generosity.  The best unschoolers I&#39;ve ever known were thoughtful and generous <br/>
with their kids and lots of other people, too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When my son was a year old I taught him how to sign a few words to <br/>
<br/>
make communicating his needs easier for him.  If that means I am <br/>
<br/>
unschooling wrong, then I am unschooling wrong.  All I know is that I <br/>
<br/>
am doing what is right for my family.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all fine, but if you&#39;re not interested in unschooling as a philosophy <br/>
and a topic of discussion, why post anything at all?  This list is intended <br/>
for the discussion of unschooling, not for the sharing of whatever on earth is <br/>
right for anyone&#39;s family.   I know some pretty punitive and controlling <br/>
families.  They think what they&#39;re doing is right for their family.  <br/>

<br/>
I guess I&#39;m confused about your seemingly antagonistic (maybe I&#39;m wrong)<br/>
reaction to the idea that you were strewing, one of the usually helpful<br/>
concepts in Unschooling, and basically exactly what you are doing in the<br/>
description above. I would think it ceases to be Unschooling if the parent<br/>
insists on everyone visiting a museum after unwillingness or dislike of the<br/>
plan had happened to be expressed, or if there was some preconceived outcome<br/>
to which the kids were being guided - &quot;write a report about....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I could care less wether or not I am <br/>
labeled a teacher, unschooler, homeschooler or etc.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
However on an Unschooling discussion list it is often helpful to people&#39;s<br/>
journey for practices, language use and ideas which are probably *not*<br/>
leading towards Unschooling to be challenged if they come up. <br/>
<br/>
It might be useful for some people to think about whether it really is OK<br/>
for anyone to consider oneself a &quot;teacher&quot; at any time in their journey. It<br/>
certainly doesn&#39;t work for me right now in my personal ongoing deschooling<br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn&#39;s (5) exposure to the idea of a teacher being the person responsible<br/>
for a student&#39;s learning achievement is minimal. However it has still<br/>
occurred that she has given the credit for her own learning to the teacher<br/>
she has been exposed to previously - it happened really strongly after the<br/>
couple of unproductive swimming lessons she had, despite it being all her<br/>
own work to learn to swim the following summer without any more lessons. The<br/>
idea that a child (particularly) won&#39;t learn without some expert teaching is<br/>
endemic in mainstream culture, so Jayn hears that idea (the &quot;empty vessel&quot;<br/>
model) sometimes. I just don&#39;t want her to hear it from me.<br/>
