to lower the voting age. They were mostly teens, she was probably the<br/>
youngest person who had joined, but the voting age thing really bothered<br/>
her, too. I&#39;m not sure what happened to the group, they were having a lot<br/>
of internal problems with leadership, but I think it&#39;s a good idea..<br/>

think my son would be very interested in something like this.  Thank you <br/>
for the info / idea.  <br/>
