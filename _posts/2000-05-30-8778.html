<div id="ygrps-yiv-997632637">A Wrinkle In Time is an excellent book.  When I was in 5th grade my teacher <br/>
read this book to us every day.  I loved the book so much, that I have since <br/>
read it at least 5 more times and have passed in on to my oldest who loved it <br/>
as well.  Soon I plan on reading it to my 7 yo if I can get him to sit still <br/>
long enough.<br/>
