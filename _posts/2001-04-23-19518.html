<div id="ygrps-yiv-303675500">What&#39;s an ISP?  We have &quot;Umbrella&quot; schools here.  They are private school, as far as the state is concerned, but either offer homeschool programs or are exclusively homeschool.  In most, the family has to complete the schools program and submit the work or grades to the school for records.  Some even require meetings, testing at the school, and other stuff.  Homeschoolers in these umbrella schools are considered private school students by the state.  <br/>
