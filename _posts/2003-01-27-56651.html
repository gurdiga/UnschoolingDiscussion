<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826830262">Hi all,<br/>
I too was drawn to the &#39;learn more World History from stories&#39;<br/>
especially in the timeline format.<br/>
<br/>
I too cringed at the structure, intensity and knew that I would never<br/>
do all of it.(I love to read,hate to write, so how can I make my kids<br/>
do it ). Maybe a more Charlotte Mason style wpuld fit but...<br/>
That &quot;teach kids how to think&quot; never made sense to me either.<br/>
So, because I never had any History except Columbus to The Civil War<br/>
(over and over and over), I will learn about World History. Maybe I<br/>
will train or untrain my mind but it is mine...theirs is theirs. My<br/>
kids do not need to suffer for what I think I missed.<br/>
<br/>
I went to the NC conference.  Jessie scared me.<br/>
I am not sure that I want to go to the MD one unless there will be a<br/>
big comfy hangout area where unschoolers and want to bees can joyfully<br/>
NOT attend the lectures!!<br/>

Who finally went off what little was left of &quot;school at home&quot; and<br/>
never went &quot;back&quot; after Christmas vacation...Yahoo!!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940932004">I know that there will be sessions for unschooling at the Conference (a friend of mine is leading one of them) and our unschooling group (Life is Learning) has an unschooling social section set up upstairs at the Conference for hanging out and discussing unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
