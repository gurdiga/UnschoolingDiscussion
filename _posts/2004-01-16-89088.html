<div id="ygrps-yiv-93035690">From our parent-directed education list, I thought y&#39;all might enjoy <br/>
this, since we&#39;ve been talking about food, and experts, and whether/how the <br/>
future could ever measure the true value of unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      So it seems the Smell and Taste Research Treatment Foundation in <br/>
Chicago is contributing to what Thinking Parents want to know --<br/>
<br/>
       According to Dr. Alan Hirsch, his researchers visited 50 Chicago-area <br/>
families, bringing them a free pasta dinner on two different occasions. One <br/>
dinner included garlic bread and the other did not. The researchers then stayed <br/>
to observe and record the family interactions during the evening.<br/>
<br/>
       The Garlic Bread Effect cannot be overstated!<br/>
<br/>
       When garlic bread was present, they recorded 8 percent more positive <br/>
family interactions and 22 percent fewer negative interactions. Astonishing! <br/>
How have the PTA and the NEA missed this connection?! <br/>
<br/>
       (Maybe Paul Vallas -- formerly Chicago superintendent so he OUGHT to <br/>
know about the Foundation&#39;s scientific findings, one might argue -- should <br/>
start sending out parent report cards grading the home use of garlic bread to <br/>
support the school curriculum.)<br/>
<br/>
       I first tumbled to this research in a piece by New York Daily News <br/>
columnist Lenore Skenaz. Then I found the Foundation&#39;s website at <br/>
www.smellandtaste.org where I read that the irresistible smells of daily life, like warm <br/>
chocolate, spicy peppermint and fresh bread baking, can make our brains and <br/>
memories work measurably better! Dr. Hirsch apparently has written a book about <br/>
this, titled &quot;Life&#39;s a Smelling Success!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
       p.s. the site offers a &quot;snack food personality study&quot; too, if you want <br/>
to have some fun with your family -- after all the garlic bread is gone <br/>
tonight. :)  JJ<br/>
