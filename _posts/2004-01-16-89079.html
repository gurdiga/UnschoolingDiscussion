<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114943712">This came to me through a MOMYS email group I&#39;m on (Mothers With Many Young Siblings). It&#39;s a Christian group, and many of the moms are traditional in their homeschooling and discipline..yet untraditional in other ways. <br/>
 <br/>
The quote comes from an article from the &quot;No Greater Joy&quot; website, which is from the Pearls..again, it&#39;s a very Christian and traditional website. However, I was surprised to see the article there, and thought this quote a good one in regards to unschooling. <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;It takes a greater awareness to give children liberty than it does to withhold it.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
If anyone is interested in the article, which is more of a recounting of one person&#39;s very untraditional upbringing, it&#39;s at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://64.4.10.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=9ace3587f1b4977570bd187ae76389a2&lat=1074263305&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2enogreaterjoy%2eorg%2far011%2ehtm">http://64.4.10.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=9ace3587f1b4977570bd187ae76389a2&lat=1074263305&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2enogreaterjoy%2eorg%2far011%2ehtm</a> under &quot;Give me Liberty&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
If the link doesn&#39;t work and someone was interested in it, please let me know and I&#39;ll see what I can do. <br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>
