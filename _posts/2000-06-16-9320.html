<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275509555">Hi Aimee,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m from Upper Michigan in Menominee, just over the border.   I&#39;d check out Pestigo,  Wisconsin for the Pestigo fire museum.  It happened at the same time as the Chicago Fire but was actually worse.   There are also numerous water falls in the upper eastern part of Wisconsin.  Of course upper Michigan has the Mackinaw bridge and Mackinac Island.  There is also other large falls in upper Michigan as well as moose.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>

&gt;    I&#39;m planning to unschool my one-year-old and I also live in a fairly<br/>
&gt; small, rural Midwestern community. Just joining this list and a couple<br/>
&gt; others has helped me discover that there are a ton of home/unschoolers right<br/>
&gt; near me. I&#39;m sure someone has great book recommendations to help you get<br/>
&gt; started. I have to do that myself.<br/>

&gt; I am considering unschooling my Edison Trait/Hunter 7 year-old son. I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t the faintest clue as to where to start! What is really<br/>
&gt; involved? Can it be realistically be done in a small, rural<br/>
&gt; Midwestern community? Will I stay sane? ;)<br/>

&gt; Yeah, we still have Accalia&#39;s unused crib set up, but we&#39;re planning to tear<br/>
&gt; it down soon. Although, it is a good place to store laundry :).<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello all! We&#39;re going to embark on a new stage of our homeschooling<br/>
&gt; journey! On Feb 1, 2001 our family is going to travel the 48 states<br/>
&gt; in a motor home! Our family includes myself, Aimee 28 yrs. old, my<br/>
&gt; husband Mark, 33 and our 2 daughters, Alexandria (age 7) and Tabitha<br/>
&gt; (1 1/2).<br/>
&gt; Our plan is to spend about a week in each state. The reason I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; writing is we&#39;d love to hear from homeschoolers in other states about<br/>
&gt; what are some &quot;don&#39;t miss&quot; activities in your area/state, also we&#39;d<br/>
&gt; love to hear about what&#39;s unique to your area.<br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers seem to often have great ideas that aren&#39;t listed in<br/>
&gt; &quot;guide books&quot;!<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re not looking for amusement parks, one thing we&#39;re doing for sure<br/>
&gt; are staying with Omish friends in Indiana so that we can really<br/>
&gt; experience their life. I&#39;m looking for any ideas along this line!<br/>
&gt; Thank you so much for your help in this matter! Please contact me at<br/>

&gt; our 1st grandbaby, due mid-Sept, is going to be named Kinsey McLane if she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a she ... this is after my maternal grandparents; the Kinsey fm was from<br/>
&gt; Scotland and McLane fm was from Ireland; whatta mix, Scot~Irish, then along<br/>
&gt; comes my dad who is German, lol ... so I guess this makes me a<br/>
&gt; *thrifty~square~head* and dh is of French decent, so our dch are<br/>
&gt; gentle~thrifty~square~heads (dh always said his side of the fm is GENTLE,<br/>
&gt; haha) ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pris ~&gt; who&#39;z been gone ALL DAY for the past 2 days and now had TONS of e-m<br/>
&gt; to read; back soon ... goodness, ya&#39;ll have been busy :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Our families also come from Ireland.  My maiden name is Cochran and my<br/>
&gt; &gt;  husband&#39;s mother&#39;s maiden name is McCann (which, incidentally is our<br/>
&gt; son&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;  first name)<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bonnie,  We named our daughter McKenna after our highlander name,<br/>
&gt; McKensie.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There was already a MacKenzie in the family on my dh&#39;s side, so we came up<br/>
&gt; &gt; with our own variation.  I am unsure as to where my family come from in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ireland.  My dad&#39;s father&#39;s family are of English descent, and my maiden<br/>
&gt; name<br/>
&gt; &gt; is Tillery.  I am very interested in genealogy, and plan to learn as much<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can.  ~Karen<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are in NJ and here are a few things that we thought of...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Delaware Water Gap (Northern NJ)<br/>
&gt; Statue of Liberty<br/>
&gt; Liberty State Park<br/>
&gt; Garden State Aquarium (Southern NJ)<br/>
&gt; Wildwood/Cape May at the Shore (Cape May also has a zoo) or Barnegat Light<br/>
&gt; (old lighthouse)<br/>
&gt; Washington Crossing Park (not much to write home about, but it is the place<br/>
&gt; on the Delaware River that Washington crossed during the Revolutionary war<br/>
&gt; to defeat the Hessians, there are historical displays across the river in<br/>
&gt; PA)<br/>
&gt; Also, the Philadelphia Zoo (which is in PA) is one of the oldest zoo&#39;s in<br/>
&gt; the country (very nice)<br/>
&gt; Northlandz (the largest toy train layout in the world with a working &quot;mini&quot;<br/>
&gt; steam engine that takes kids around a track, also has a doll museum attached<br/>
&gt; for same admission)  This is in Flemington, NJ Hunterdon County.<br/>
&gt; Hunterdon County itself is a beautiful place with lots of farmland and old<br/>
&gt; houses (the house I grew up in is over 200 years old, as is the elementary<br/>
&gt; school that I went to which is in Stockton, NJ, about 20 minutes from<br/>
&gt; Flemington.  My elementary school is one of the oldest left in the country.<br/>
&gt; We got to visit the Whitehouse in 1977? because of it and present President<br/>
&gt; Carter with a picture of our school)<br/>
&gt; Colligan&#39;s Inn in Stockton which is the restaurant that the song &quot;There was<br/>
&gt; a hotel with a wishing well...&quot; was written for, also very old.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course, Trenton, NJ is the state capital and one of the oldest cities in<br/>
&gt; the country.  Lots of history there.  A beautiful state house, a museum and<br/>
&gt; old revolutionary war barracks all within one block.  We are close to<br/>
&gt; Trenton where we live now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Griffith Morgan house in Pennsauken, NJ is one of the oldest houses in NJ.<br/>
&gt; (may be the oldest house in NJ, kind of hard to find, unless you know where<br/>
&gt; it is.  Of course, my husband does know where it is, so he could give you<br/>
&gt; directions if you are interested)  Also, close to the aquarium and the<br/>
&gt; aquarium in across the river from the Philadelphia Zoo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Princeton, NJ is a really cool town.  (About 20 minutes from Trenton)Albert<br/>
&gt; Einstein lived there.  They shot the film I.Q. there.  You can tour<br/>
&gt; Princeton University campus.  Their library is famous and they have a great<br/>
&gt; art museum which is open to the public.  It is also home to black squirrels<br/>
&gt; which aren&#39;t found anywhere else in the U.S.  They were imported from<br/>
&gt; England because the University was based on Cambridge U and they had black<br/>
&gt; squirrels on campus (they are also very friendly as they are used to being<br/>
&gt; around people).  Also, a lot of history in Princeton (an old grave yard,<br/>
&gt; homes, etc.)  Also home to Princeton Theological Seminary school (right next<br/>
&gt; to the University) The Annex is a must eat at place, it is in a basement,<br/>
&gt; but has been around a very long time and they have pictures on the walls of<br/>
&gt; all of the famous and historical people who have dined there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I know that is a novel and we are still trying to think if there is<br/>
&gt; anything else.  Of course, Philadelphia is filled with historical stops<br/>
&gt; ((Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Elfreth&#39;s Alley (old cobblestone street<br/>
&gt; with original houses, can tour them))  I could probably go on forever, so I<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck and I wish we were going with you.  It sounds like great fun.  If<br/>
&gt; you want to say &quot;Hi&quot; when you get to NJ, just let us know...<br/>

&gt; &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Homeschooling across the United States!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2000 01:34:52 -0000<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hello all! We&#39;re going to embark on a new stage of our homeschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt;journey! On Feb 1, 2001 our family is going to travel the 48 states<br/>
&gt; &gt;in a motor home! Our family includes myself, Aimee 28 yrs. old, my<br/>
&gt; &gt;husband Mark, 33 and our 2 daughters, Alexandria (age 7) and Tabitha<br/>
&gt; &gt;(1 1/2).<br/>
&gt; &gt;Our plan is to spend about a week in each state. The reason I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;writing is we&#39;d love to hear from homeschoolers in other states about<br/>
&gt; &gt;what are some &quot;don&#39;t miss&quot; activities in your area/state, also we&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt;love to hear about what&#39;s unique to your area.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Homeschoolers seem to often have great ideas that aren&#39;t listed in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;guide books&quot;!<br/>
&gt; &gt;We&#39;re not looking for amusement parks, one thing we&#39;re doing for sure<br/>
&gt; &gt;are staying with Omish friends in Indiana so that we can really<br/>
&gt; &gt;experience their life. I&#39;m looking for any ideas along this line!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thank you so much for your help in this matter! Please contact me at<br/>

&gt; &gt;God bless,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, it could take quite a while to just drive from one end of CA to the<br/>
&gt; other but in our litle neck of the &quot;woods,&quot; we literally have the real<br/>
&gt; woods.  If you should decided to head down through CA from the Oregon end,<br/>
&gt; take 101.  A must stop is a wide spot in the road called Orick.  Roosevelt<br/>
&gt; Elk have the right of way on the freeway (well, so it is a nice two lane<br/>
&gt; highway, it is still called a freeway &lt;g&gt;) and they are always grazing by<br/>
&gt; the side of the road.  A right towards the ocean brings you out at Fern<br/>
&gt; Canyon where Lost World was filmed.  About 45 miles south you will come to<br/>
&gt; Trinidad and Patrick&#39;s Point State Park (btw, you can buy a year&#39;s pass and<br/>
&gt; stay in all the state parks free after the initial fee) where there is an<br/>
&gt; authentic Native American village built by Native Americans (not teepees!)<br/>
&gt; and Agate Beach.  Further down the coast you come to Eureka where you will<br/>
&gt; find the Carson Mansion, the most photographed single family residence<br/>
&gt; (castles don&#39;t get into this category) in the world.  The next side trip<br/>
&gt; you want to take is to Ferndale, &quot;The Victorian Village, site of many<br/>
&gt; movies including &quot;Outbreak&quot; and &quot;Salem&#39;s Lot.&quot;  Continue south to the<br/>
&gt; turnoff at Pepperwood which is the old highway.  There are several camping<br/>
&gt; spaces along this 100 mile stretch.  The tallest and oldest trees are found<br/>
&gt; here--Coastal redwoods, many of them over 300&#39; tall.  You drive right<br/>
&gt; between them on a road that was contructed to their needs so it is rather<br/>
&gt; squiggly, as the kidlets put it but not too bad as it is a regular on the<br/>
&gt; motorhome route.  You can see the Grandfather Tree which stands at almost<br/>
&gt; 300&#39;.  It has survived a lightning strike, 64&#39; flood waters, human&#39;s<br/>
&gt; attempting to cut it down and a fire.  In each and every one of the<br/>
&gt; pull-offs and parks in this National Forest if you sit quietly jays and<br/>
&gt; chipmunks will come right up to the kids and you can see river otters and<br/>
&gt; deer within 10 to 20 feet of you.  You could also take a side trip to<br/>
&gt; Shelter Cove, also known as the Lost Coast and home of the black sand<br/>
&gt; beaches.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then onward in a southerly direction through Mendocino County.  You might<br/>
&gt; want to take a side trip to Fort Ross where the Russians had a settlement.<br/>
&gt;  And then into Sonoma County (wineries by the dozens if you like) and in<br/>
&gt; Petaluma is Vallejo&#39;s fort and in the city of Sonoma (a left off of 101 to<br/>
&gt; the east) is Vallejo&#39;s home.  Again, southward bound and in about an hour<br/>
&gt; you are in San Francisco.  Now, you will have to decide just how many days<br/>
&gt; you want to spend in the greater Bay Area with sites such as the usual with<br/>
&gt; the Zoo, Exploratorium, Aquarium, Japanese Gardens, etc. and such sites as<br/>
&gt; the Crookedest Road in the World, the Cliff House and a million and one<br/>
&gt; other things to do in SF, not counting Tilden Park (NOT an amusement park!)<br/>
&gt; in the Berkeley hills, Jack London Square in Oakland, the Oakland Zoo where<br/>
&gt; you can take a sky tram over the different animal areas (feels like they<br/>
&gt; can reach up and touch your feet) and then on to San Jose for the<br/>
&gt; Winchester House.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure there are lots of folks in Central and Southern CA and folks from<br/>
&gt; the Valley that can add even more goodies that aren&#39;t amusement park type<br/>
&gt; things.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone! I&#39;ve been lurking for a while, but thought it was time to introduce myself. I am a full time mom, writer and web designer. We have been learning with our kids at home for 6 years, and started unschooling &quot;officially&quot; last year. So far, we love it, though sometimes I worry. It&#39;s hard to let go and just trust that they will pursue their interests without me leading them each step of the way. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wanted to mention a website that some of you might find interesting. It&#39;s a women&#39;s website, though a lot of men visit there as well. They have lots of great info on just about every topic you can think of, but the best part of the site is the discussion forums. They have several &quot;homeschooling&quot; forums, as well as an unschooling forum.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Links are below:<br/>
