<div id="ygrps-yiv-903222923">I have to share this very, very cool story with you folks.<br/>
<br/>
Julian is taking a college course at Harvard Extension. Cambridge is just far <br/>
enough that it&#39;s not worth going home then coming back to get him, so whoever <br/>
brings him has to kill time in Cambridge. Another unschooling mom (Caroline, <br/>
who was at the SC conference) has a son in a class same time as Julian&#39;s, and <br/>
the first week she invited me to go to a local church that has a Soup Kitchen <br/>
and feed homeless folks. So I&#39;ve been doing that. <br/>
<br/>
Beth (my partner, if you don&#39;t know that) brought Juls this week, and planned <br/>
to do the same.  Now, last Saturday, Beth, who has been wanting to learn to <br/>
drum, got a wonderful drum when we went to the Renaissance Faire. So she <br/>
dropped Juls off at his class, then started to head to the church.<br/>
<br/>
Then a rather large group of people walked by with cool drums, playing as <br/>
they went along. She started talking to them, and they have a drumming group that <br/>
usually meets on Wednesdays, but was changed to Thursday this week. They <br/>
invited her along. She got to try a lot of different drums, got a lesson from this <br/>
cool old woman drummer, and got to play with the large group of <br/>
African-America Harvard men, who were thrilled with her because she was so excited. They <br/>
were disappointed when she said she couldn&#39;t make it the next week.<br/>
<br/>
She ran into Caroline after, who thought it was VERY cool.<br/>
<br/>
Beth came home glowing, and Julian was thrilled for her.<br/>
