<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754861900">Well, with the onset of the holidays, home hunting and extra children at my <br/>
home, I am decreasing my online time. I am going no mail for the duration. I <br/>
do not think it is wise to have two ADHD people in the house with me hiding <br/>
in the classroom. :( <br/>
I am still able to be reached via email   (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Lifeslearn@...">Lifeslearn@...</a>) or ICQ 43428000<br/>
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays Everyone! <br/>
(I just saw my husband do flips in anticipation of serious computer down <br/>
time! LOL)<br/>
See ya&#39;ll after the new year! Good luck with Y2K!<br/>
<br/>
May the love of God surround you this season!<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
