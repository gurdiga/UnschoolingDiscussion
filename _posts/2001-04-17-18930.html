<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449532268">Hello to everyone:  My name is Renee and I homeschool my 4 children.  I have two disabiling<br/>
conditions that prevent me from working.  I have been trying to get Disability for a year now and<br/>
have been turned down twice.  I have finally had to get an attorney and I have a court date on May<br/>
4th.  I ask humbly that all of you who will please cover me in prayer, especially on that day. <br/>
This is such an important thing to our family.  We really need the money.  I thank you for<br/>
allowing this post and for your prayers.<br/>
<br/>

(Blessed Moma to Ryan 16, Austin 13, Carson 11 and Jessica Renee 5 1/2. (Matthew and Ethan already safe in the Arms of Jesus.)<br/>
