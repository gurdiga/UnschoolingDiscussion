<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518933240">Funny, the Wal Marts here and in Texas pay better than minimum wage.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure what you mean by &quot;tolerant of family issues with its workers&quot;.  We<br/>
may have vastly different definitions of &quot;tolerant&quot;.  From what I know of<br/>
Wal Mart&#39;s practices, they are very pro-family, very willing to remove items<br/>
that customers find offensive, and supports the community financially.  If<br/>
you choose not to shop there, fine.  I *like* those things about them.  That<br/>
is why I choose to shop there instead of K-Mart.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-664471388">I&#39;m sorry to say that in supporting *our* community, Wal Mart has helped<br/>
ruin the small town down town, and they pay their workers slightly better<br/>
than minimum wage, but most don&#39;t get benefits.  And many of the single,<br/>
working moms I know who work there have their shifts rotated frequently to<br/>
include late evenings when day care centers aren&#39;t open.  <br/>
<br/>
There are no easy answers to any of this.  I think my working out of the<br/>
home has enriched my children&#39;s lives moreso than my own life.  But I&#39;ve<br/>
never had to institutionalize them to do so.  We also have no family<br/>
close, so we&#39;ve had to create our own &quot;village&quot; to help us raise our<br/>
children and have found extended family there.  I&#39;m already starting to<br/>
recruit a &quot;big sister&quot; to help me out this fall when school starts and<br/>
laying the groundwork with my superiors so they won&#39;t be surprised when I<br/>
show up to teach with a nursing baby in sling....<br/>

<br/>
     Exactly.  People form different opinions and it doesn&#39;t mean that one or <br/>
the other is ignorant, uncaring, whatever.  When I mention the tolerance of <br/>
family issues, I am speaking more of how they treat their workers.  My aunt <br/>
has found them to be very lacking in flexibility or compassion with regard to <br/>
family situations that have occured over the years (needing time off for a <br/>
family funeral, needing time off for a husband&#39;s injury, etc.).  I know they <br/>
pay more than minimum wage in some areas, such as in Minnesota where we lived <br/>
before, and I know that many others don&#39;t pay their workers a living wage, <br/>
either.  I have a problem with any employer that pays adults a wage that they <br/>
could never live on without being in poverty.<br/>
     But my mother shops at Walmart all the time and I am not saying I&#39;ve <br/>
never shopped there.  My point with this is that we can judge an issue <br/>
without judging people who make different choices.<br/>
