People here are good parents - caring parents. Start from that <br/>
assumption. The ideas are radical, maybe radically different than <br/>
anything you&#39;ve heard before? But read carefully, don&#39;t jump to any <br/>
conclusions. Especially read about REAL experiences people have with <br/>
their REAL kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please Dianne - go and reread the list policies, this IS an <br/>
&#39;in-your-face&#39; group, if by that you mean that ideas will be <br/>
challenged. In fact, I&#39;ll post the list policies here, because it might <br/>
be useful for others to be reminded:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion Posting Policies<br/>
<br/>
Please read carefully BEFORE posting on the list.<br/>
<br/>
It is our sincere wish to provide a forum for those seeking to deepen <br/>
their<br/>
understanding of the unschooling philosophy. The primary purpose of this<br/>
list is to encourage the critical examination of ideas, beliefs and<br/>
viewpoints.<br/>
<br/>
Questioning of deeply-held ideas and beliefs can be very uncomfortable <br/>
and<br/>
sometimes responses to that process can stand in the way of people <br/>
getting<br/>
what they need out of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, we offer the following to help our members get the<br/>
most from the list:<br/>
<br/>
1. We suggest that you read for at least a couple of weeks before <br/>
posting. Spend that<br/>
time getting a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members. This will help you <br/>
decide if this list is worth<br/>
  your time or whether some other list might be more useful to you in <br/>
meeting your needs.<br/>
<br/>
2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity <br/>
to<br/>
critically examine your own ideas.<br/>
<br/>
3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to discussing ideas, not the<br/>
person with whom you are disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to <br/>
public<br/>
examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
5. Before you hit &quot;send,&quot; consider whether your post will contribute<br/>
positively to the unschooling discussion.<br/>
<br/>
6. Avoid using loaded terminology. For instance, &quot;If you have no TV<br/>
restrictions why don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?&quot; will get you <br/>
more<br/>
useful responses than, &quot;I don&#39;t see how your kids learn anything if all <br/>
they<br/>
ever do is sit around like zombies watching unlimited TV.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
7. It is not useful to inform the list that you believe someone else is<br/>
being rude or discourteous; please trust the rest of the list to <br/>
recognize<br/>
rudeness for themselves. Saying, &quot;Jane was rude to me,&quot; just bogs down <br/>
the<br/>
list. It is also a waste of everyone&#39;s time when participants attempt to<br/>
correct or improve other list members&#39; manners. It never works and <br/>
always<br/>
disrupts the list. Avoid<br/>
statements such as: &quot;Jane, here is my suggestion of how you could write <br/>
more<br/>
nicely so people wouldn&#39;t think you are being rude.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
8. Our brains automatically supply a &quot;tone&quot; to posts as we read. It can <br/>
be<br/>
helpful to imagine your best friend speaking the words you are reading, <br/>
in<br/>
the gentlest, most well-meaning tone you can imagine. It is <br/>
unacceptable to<br/>
attack the &quot;tone&quot; of the list or to make generalizations about it. &quot;I&#39;ve<br/>
been on many other lists and this one is the rudest I&#39;ve seen,&quot; would be<br/>
unacceptable. Instead, attempt to create a positive, helpful tone with <br/>
your<br/>
own posts by setting the example you hope others will follow.<br/>
<br/>
9. Envision every post and response as a dish at a potluck dinner. You <br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
love every dish at a potluck any more than you will love every poster&#39;s<br/>
style of help. But a dish/post may be exactly what someone else needs. <br/>
If<br/>
you don&#39;t like a certain list member&#39;s offerings, skip them and<br/>
leave them for others.<br/>
<br/>
10. Read and write as clearly as you can. In casual conversation we <br/>
often<br/>
don&#39;t realize how much we rely on others to fill in the gist of our<br/>
conversation based on what they expect us to say. But here, without body<br/>
language or inflection, all we have to go on are your words and they <br/>
should<br/>
say what you mean. If you say, for example, you &quot;never&quot; do something, it<br/>
should not mean &quot;almost never.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is to make the list as useful as possible for those seeking to<br/>
deepen their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. To do that, <br/>
all<br/>
new list members are initially moderated to prevent spamming and catch <br/>
posts<br/>
that could disrupt the list. People will also be moderated if they <br/>
disrupt<br/>
the usefulness of the list. Potentially disruptive posts will be <br/>
returned<br/>
for revision.<br/>
<br/>

                                 -Sometimes the seeming tone of a post comes from the readers and not the writers post. Are you really reading these posts with a clear mind? Frankly, I&#39;ve been sort of puzzled about how you keep interpreting some things as being about food when they were clearly (to me at least) analogies used to illustrate something about control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553381311">**I have not come to any real<br/>
conclusions about this list, just impressions so far<br/>
and it seems my impressions are considered invalid.**<br/>
<br/>
I suggest that when something sounds too sweeping or too black and white <br/>
to you, that you quote it and ask a question about it.   (Or paste it in <br/>
a reply email and don&#39;t sent it until the discussion has unfolded and <br/>
some confusion has cleared up.)  The original poster can clarify her <br/>
intent if the relevant parts of her posts are quoted.  It&#39;s really <br/>
time-consuming to go back and find the relevant part after it&#39;s been <br/>
sent.  (Most likely, no one will do that.)<br/>
<br/>
It is just not possible to back up and understand how a reader reached <br/>
certain conclusions about the impression that the list makes on her <br/>
unless the reader/replier is specific about what parts of what posts she <br/>
wants to discuss.  Without pointing out specific passages, there is no <br/>
way for people see specifically what someone is disagreeing with.  I can <br/>
say to you &quot;I interpret what was posted here last week differently than <br/>
you do&quot;, but I can&#39;t really go any further in discussing this.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone can give a meaningful response to your concerns <br/>
about always letting kids make decisions unsupported (my paraphrase), <br/>
unless you are more specific.  (I can say that it is a common <br/>
misperception.  People sometimes are very polarized in their thinking <br/>
and think that if a parent resists being very controlling that then that <br/>
parent just throws her hands up in the air and doesn&#39;t parent at all.  <br/>
As if &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; were the only choices.  As if you a parent who <br/>
isn&#39;t at the hovering and controlling end of the spectrum is ignoring <br/>
her children totally.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Sandra said &quot;all women who are concerned about food <br/>
quality are shrill and aggravating and need to chill&quot;  (my colorful <br/>
paraphrase).   I think she gave an example trying to show that SOME <br/>
parents who are focused on food issues and political causes sometimes <br/>
put ideology first when making decisions and put their children <br/>
second.   I think she is implying that the child should be more <br/>
important than the ideology.  Having rules that are inflexible, for <br/>
ideological reasons, can make parenting harder and can be harder on kids <br/>
than we have to be.<br/>
<br/>
(But, if I was responding in real time, at the time it was said, I could <br/>
refer back to Sandra&#39;s real words and not be shoving my own <br/>
interpretation into her mouth.  That&#39;s gotta be annoying.)  (Although <br/>
perhaps less annoying if I get pretty close to her intention.)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS   One part of being specific that can be helpful is being specific <br/>
about ages of kids.  Advice that rings true to parents of 13 year olds <br/>
(e.g. let them stay up and play quietly), often sounds inappropriate to <br/>
the parents of 3 year olds.   But one poster can write &quot;my kid likes to <br/>
do _____&quot; and some people reading will visualize a little kid, and some <br/>
a much bigger one.  It can be easy for us to talk past each other that <br/>
way.  And I wish I had a specific example to give, as I think it would <br/>
make my point clearer.</div>
