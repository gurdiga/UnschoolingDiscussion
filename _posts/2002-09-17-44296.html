<div id="ygrps-yiv-312834427">Aloha dear listmates-<br/>
I have a plethora of webpages bookmarked regarding alternatives to the<br/>
usual college route. My son, Sky, is college-aged but not wanting that<br/>
route at this time. If there is any interest, I would be happy to go<br/>
through them and post the website addresses - but unless folks are into it,<br/>
I really don&#39;t want to do that work! <br/>
Let me know . . . there are soooooooo many ways up the mountain for &#39;older&#39;<br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
Love, Lee<br/>

I have a daughter in the same situation as your son, Sky.  College is out <br/>
there, maybe, just not right now.  We would certainly be interested in <br/>
resources to explore if you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing even just a few.  Thanks!<br/>
