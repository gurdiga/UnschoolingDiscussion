<div id="ygrps-yiv-686211406">**Something bothers me about parents who don&#39;t think anything&#39;s wrong with <br/>
their kids  coming home to live after college.  I think it sets up <br/>
unrealistic <br/>
expectations about what adult life is, and can be.   I&#39;m trying to figure out <br/>
what my job is here, isn&#39;t it to raise him so that he can live his own life, <br/>
responsibilities and all? Isn&#39;t it a failure on my part if he comes home, <br/>
unable <br/>
or unwilling to deal with independence? **<br/>
<br/>
I think Americans have an unhealthy reverence for the idea of total <br/>
independence. I think it sets people up to always feel like they&#39;re not quite doing it <br/>
all right, because total independence is a total impossibility. I think <br/>
healthy interdependence is a good goal to work toward, and I think that includes the <br/>
idea that yes, you CAN come home again. Coming home is not necessarily a <br/>
failure or an indication of being unable or unwilling to deal with independence.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this topic a lot lately. I know a LOT of kids who <br/>
are going to college even though they&#39;re not sure what they want or expect out <br/>
of the experience, and a few who are pretty sure they really don&#39;t want college <br/>
but are afraid not to go because that&#39;s the only way their parents are still <br/>
willing to support them. Some are going to study things they aren&#39;t much <br/>
interested in as a &quot;back up&quot; hoping they&#39;ll figure out a way to do what they really <br/>
want to do after college is over. All the adults I know who went that route <br/>
are still doing the &quot;back up&quot; jobs decades later, having never really tried to <br/>
follow their (usually artistic) dreams. My own daughter, I&#39;m supporting by <br/>
saying &quot;Do it now if you want. Try it now if you want. What&#39;s the worst that <br/>
could happen? You give it up in a few years and end up living back with us or some <br/>
other relative for awhile while you dust yourself off and move on? No <br/>
problem.  There are plenty of people who love you all over the country. We&#39;ll be your <br/>
back up&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My current thoughts. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761371077">What of parents that move in w/ us? <br/>
My wonderful aged aunt moved in w/ me to help me raise Brianna. It also (I hope) helped her. After 70 years of working - her social security check was only $479.00 a month.<br/>
Should I have said &quot;No, I have to raise Brianna alone?&quot;<br/>
Let me tell you, I&#39;m grateful I had my aunt there for that time.<br/>
<br/>
Should those of us that are raising our grandchildren not do that?<br/>
<br/>
If I had a large home, I&#39;d love to have my aged aunt (another one) live w/ us.<br/>
 I&#39;d  have no problem putting up my son - he&#39;s 2000 miles away from me.<br/>
<br/>
The very wealthy, I am told, often have multi generational homes. Isn&#39;t Charles living in Elizabeth&#39;s home?<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem w/ kids going back home.<br/>
<br/>
My cousin and his wife put their kids out on their 18th birthday. I think it&#39;s selfish and sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066230053">Amen to that!!!<br/>
<br/>
And I think the family separation thing may have something to do w/ some of the problems kids have.<br/>
<br/>
How can a child have a sense of roots, a sense of belonging if there&#39;s no &#39;space or place&#39; that grounds them?<br/>
How can kids feel safe & protected & cherished w/o family ties?<br/>
<br/>
I stay in East providence because my aunts are here.<br/>
They&#39;re in their 90&#39;s.<br/>
Us leave??? nope.<br/>
<br/>
Brianna has a relationship w/ them that&#39;s wonderful!!<br/>

  &gt;Instead of the child growing and moving away, the parents reached retirement age and left their hometowns and children behind. &lt;snip&gt; It&#39;s not only the YOUNG who have bought into the expected &quot;grow up and move away&quot; but the older folks too.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  This sucks too!  I&#39;ve always been close to my grandparents and looked <br/>
  forward to my children having a close relationship with them too.  9 <br/>
  years ago they moved to FL and we&#39;ve hardly seen them.  Last year they <br/>
  both were having tons of health problems and we were powerless to help <br/>
  them.  None of us could afford to come down there and/or take time off <br/>
  of work or leave our little ones.  My grandma wants to move back here, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543089682">Hi,<br/>
That&#39;s totally different. That&#39;s enabling. I have Brianna because her mom, my daughter, is an addict. (Coming up on two years clean!!)<br/>
I had to put Channa out.<br/>
The last year she was using, her second child was in foster care (I wouldn&#39;t take anymore children); she was homeless. I let her sleep in the mini-van. She had blankets and pillows. It was cold out. I would not let her sleep in my home.<br/>
<br/>
Your parents are not helping your brother. They&#39;re enabling him.<br/>
They need to use tough love.<br/>
<br/>
They need to realize that his choices are his choices. They are no longer responsible for his life.<br/>
<br/>
Have an adult child come home that is getting on his/her feet is one thing. <br/>
Supporting a junkie or a drunk is another. They should put him out.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

for <br/>
not &quot;making&quot; him go to college.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My half brother stole money from my  mom and left, so maybe he&#39;s out of our <br/>
lives now.  <br/>
<br/>
I called her on mother&#39;s day and ended up saying something (lightly) pointed <br/>
about not really wanting to hear that my brother had been letting her down <br/>
since he was 10 (or some young age she named, I forget numbers).   I said &quot;This <br/>
probably isn&#39;t the day to say this, but you were letting him down long before <br/>
that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Not an exact quote and I wish I remember what phrase she used and I used <br/>
back on her.  It was something like, but not exactly &quot;betraying my trust&quot; or s<br/>
omething like that.)<br/>
<br/>
She drank and smoked all the time she was pregnant and when he was a baby and <br/>
she swatted him in the crib for making noise when he woke up or for crying <br/>
and reaching for her when she said &quot;no not now&quot; (or whatever, not really <br/>
believing people who told her that babies can&#39;t understand English; seriously, her <br/>
third  child and she was that ignorant).<br/>
<br/>
So in her case, I sadly think they deserve one another.  That seems cold and <br/>
terrible, but they are at least smart enough to know that not drinking is <br/>
cheaper and smarter than drinking.<br/>
<br/>
I feel for your parents not wanting to leave him along in the house. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing if parents WANT a child there and all&#39;s happy.  I withdraw <br/>
some of the conviction of my earlier post, then, because I wasn&#39;t thinking about <br/>
grown kids claiming a right to stick around and screw up their parent&#39;s lives <br/>
(or their sisters&#39; lives; I had my brother two different time periods when he <br/>
was younger, when he was four and thirteen (and thereabout).<br/>

  **Something bothers me about parents who don&#39;t think anything&#39;s wrong with <br/>
  their kids  coming home to live after college.  I think it sets up <br/>
  unrealistic <br/>
  expectations about what adult life is, and can be.   I&#39;m trying to figure out <br/>
  what my job is here, isn&#39;t it to raise him so that he can live his own life, <br/>
  responsibilities and all? Isn&#39;t it a failure on my part if he comes home, <br/>
  unable <br/>
  or unwilling to deal with independence? **<br/>
<br/>
  I think Americans have an unhealthy reverence for the idea of total <br/>
  independence. I think it sets people up to always feel like they&#39;re not quite doing it <br/>
  all right, because total independence is a total impossibility. I think <br/>
  healthy interdependence is a good goal to work toward, and I think that includes the <br/>
  idea that yes, you CAN come home again. Coming home is not necessarily a <br/>
  failure or an indication of being unable or unwilling to deal with independence.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been thinking about this topic a lot lately. I know a LOT of kids who <br/>
  are going to college even though they&#39;re not sure what they want or expect out <br/>
  of the experience, and a few who are pretty sure they really don&#39;t want college <br/>
  but are afraid not to go because that&#39;s the only way their parents are still <br/>
  willing to support them. Some are going to study things they aren&#39;t much <br/>
  interested in as a &quot;back up&quot; hoping they&#39;ll figure out a way to do what they really <br/>
  want to do after college is over. All the adults I know who went that route <br/>
  are still doing the &quot;back up&quot; jobs decades later, having never really tried to <br/>
  follow their (usually artistic) dreams. My own daughter, I&#39;m supporting by <br/>
  saying &quot;Do it now if you want. Try it now if you want. What&#39;s the worst that <br/>
  could happen? You give it up in a few years and end up living back with us or some <br/>
  other relative for awhile while you dust yourself off and move on? No <br/>
  problem.  There are plenty of people who love you all over the country. We&#39;ll be your <br/>
  back up&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  My current thoughts. :)<br/>

I don&#39;t think that what you&#39;ve said here is cold & terrible at all. You are realistic. One of the hardest things I had to do was realize - deep down inside - that my daughter, my wonderful, beautiful daughter was a junkie and the other hardest thing was understanding & accepting on a gut level that to keep her around - to be around her - was poisoning my wonderful son. <br/>

  &lt;&lt; I have a 31 year old brother who has always <br/>
  lived with my parents. He had drug problems in the past but is clean now (I <br/>
  think) though he is an alcoholic. He has been fired from every job he&#39;s ever <br/>
  had and doesn&#39;t work now...actually, he hasn&#39;t worked in years. He perceives <br/>
  that everything that he does is someone eles&#39;s fault and blames my parents <br/>
  for <br/>
  not &quot;making&quot; him go to college.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  My half brother stole money from my  mom and left, so maybe he&#39;s out of our <br/>
  lives now.  <br/>
<br/>
  I called her on mother&#39;s day and ended up saying something (lightly) pointed <br/>
  about not really wanting to hear that my brother had been letting her down <br/>
  since he was 10 (or some young age she named, I forget numbers).   I said &quot;This <br/>
  probably isn&#39;t the day to say this, but you were letting him down long before <br/>
  that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  (Not an exact quote and I wish I remember what phrase she used and I used <br/>
  back on her.  It was something like, but not exactly &quot;betraying my trust&quot; or s<br/>
  omething like that.)<br/>
<br/>
  She drank and smoked all the time she was pregnant and when he was a baby and <br/>
  she swatted him in the crib for making noise when he woke up or for crying <br/>
  and reaching for her when she said &quot;no not now&quot; (or whatever, not really <br/>
  believing people who told her that babies can&#39;t understand English; seriously, her <br/>
  third  child and she was that ignorant).<br/>
<br/>
  So in her case, I sadly think they deserve one another.  That seems cold and <br/>
  terrible, but they are at least smart enough to know that not drinking is <br/>
  cheaper and smarter than drinking.<br/>
<br/>
  I feel for your parents not wanting to leave him along in the house. <br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s one thing if parents WANT a child there and all&#39;s happy.  I withdraw <br/>
  some of the conviction of my earlier post, then, because I wasn&#39;t thinking about <br/>
  grown kids claiming a right to stick around and screw up their parent&#39;s lives <br/>
  (or their sisters&#39; lives; I had my brother two different time periods when he <br/>
  was younger, when he was four and thirteen (and thereabout).<br/>

You&#39;re absolutely right, healthy interdependence is that middle ground that I <br/>
have been seeking.  For me personally, it was sink or swim, and all that I <br/>
learned from that experience was valuable for me, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have <br/>
to set up that kind of disconcerting experience for my son, like my parents <br/>
did.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Letting him come home&quot; will not necessarily be a failure on my part, but <br/>
will just be another example of him choosing what he needs when he needs it, as a <br/>
part of HIS process of growing up.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Letting him come home&quot;   I think I would feel badly if my children looked on <br/>
it as me &quot;letting&quot; them come home.  This IS their home, they are welcomed <br/>
here, loved and respected, they will/may move on in life and be elsewhere but <br/>
this house, this building filled with their memories (and still their THINGS) <br/>
will always be a part of them and therefore it wouldn&#39;t be up to me to &quot;let&quot; them <br/>
be here.<br/>
<br/>
Now, their father... well, he&#39;s learning, and being more respectful I have to <br/>
say and he&#39;s understanding that sometimes children/young adults don&#39;t have <br/>
all the answers and we cannot give them to them.  It&#39;s a searching process that <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be college or work but maybe some of both or something in between.  <br/>
Eighteen is young for some, old for others but how in the world can we expect <br/>
our children/young adults to KNOW what life holds for them without some <br/>
exploration?<br/>
<br/>
I remember in nursing school they said that they had a practice of ALWAYS <br/>
doing the nursing home rotations first, which is by far the hardest.  The <br/>
reasoning they gave was that they would hate for a student to think nursing was their <br/>
lives work, spend years pursuing it, come down to the end and do the nursing <br/>
home rotation and quit.  It seemed a waste to them.  That was when their <br/>
highest number of students dropped nursing so they put it first and weeded out <br/>
those that were going to leave anyway.<br/>
<br/>
At the time I wasn&#39;t sure how I felt about that.  There is so MUCH more that <br/>
comes after the beginning, so much between geriatrics and growing family, I <br/>
didn&#39;t understand how others could try to influence the decisions of some and <br/>
make them think it was for their benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I see it&#39;s just a part of the way life is really.  Not necessarily a <br/>
wonderful thing at all, but not entirely all bad.  Depends on one&#39;s ability to <br/>
push forward and to really work for what they want, IF they even know they <br/>
really want it.  The BEAUTY of it, is that it&#39;s almost NEVER to late to find a <br/>
passion, a desire, to fulfill a dream that was once out of reach for any number of <br/>
reasons.  Probably a full third of the nurses in my graduating class were <br/>
mothers of children nearly grown and coming back to a passion/dream they held <br/>
long ago, or even just recently discovered.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they were finally able to nurture themselves and give themselves <br/>
permission to follow a dream?  I&#39;m glad the parents here do that for their children <br/>
from the beginning, what beautiful beings the world is in store for as adults!<br/>

  means.  But they will in the end, I know, they will do whatever they <br/>
  choose with or without my knowledge. I just feel the more they can <br/>
  communicate and the more comfortable they feel about themselves, they <br/>
  will have a better frame of mind to make that decision. <br/>

Brianna & I put a basket together for our friends as they reach their moon time.<br/>
Moon Basket.  <br/>
a bag of cramp tea mix (we get this from Kodowl Teas- it is called Moontime Tea <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:-kowdowl@...">-kowdowl@...</a> , a <br/>
teaball, toiletry items; including re-usable pads; incense, oils includiing &quot;Woman&#39;s Blessing&quot; <br/>
also from Kodowl, bath salts - yup from Kodowl!! and of course Chocolate.<br/>
We are awaiting a copy of the Red Stone - it is highly recommended.<br/>
<br/>
We put these things in the basket w/ some fresh seasonal herbs or flowers......<br/>
We include some stories about moontime.<br/>
<br/>
We are look at our moontime as a time of strength and purpose. Who else - other than a woman <br/>
can bleed for a week every month - and not die?<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I can be of any help.<br/>
