<div id="ygrps-yiv-199498005">I just wanted to thank you for some of the remarks at the end of your posts.<br/>
You had one recently about in a given moment, deciding how you want to<br/>
define yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I have been having a really rough time with my newly turned 3yo.  He is<br/>
very, very loud, extremely talkative, very curious and amazingly strong (he<br/>
removed the baseboards in his room to see what was behind there, he broke<br/>
some of the spokes of of a &quot;Jenny Lynd&quot; dressing table because &quot;I was using<br/>
them Mom&quot;).  I had found myself losing my temper and patience with him.<br/>
<br/>
I have lately been asking myself how I want to define myself and it has<br/>
caused such a shift in my attitude and behavior.  Thank you from me....and<br/>
the kids  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Julie. . . . thank you!!!!  I really only write what I need to hear the <br/>
most, and I perfectly understand. Quinton is 2 and a half (well, in January) <br/>
and I have so much to learn from him about patience!! In the exploration of <br/>
his world and how he goes about it, it sometimes, well, oftentimes turns my <br/>
world upside down, and I have re-examine who I want to show up as in this <br/>
situation. He is such a mirror as people usually are for us. Thanks for the <br/>
uplifting words and I am so glad something I wrote had value to you.<br/>
<br/>
lovemary<br/>

I cannot judge my own path and SELF, having the knowledge that I have chosen <br/>
to come here to experience these specific issues and grow, learn, and <br/>
Remember Who I Am.<br/>
