&gt; LADIES (KINDA LONG BUT PLEASE READ),<br/>
&gt;I RECEIVED THIS FROM ONE OF MY SORORS.  PLEASE READ THE INFO ON THIS =<br/>
&gt;DISEASE.<br/>
&gt;SO MANY TIMES WE THINK THAT LITTLE BUMPS, BRUISES, & IRRITATIONS ARE =<br/>
&gt;JUST THAT BUT READ THIS STORY & YOU&#39;LL KNOW DIFFERENTLY.<br/>
&gt;JUST WANNA MAKE MY GIRLS AWARE PEACE!<br/>

&gt;PAGET&quot;S DISEASE OF THE NIPPLE<br/>
&gt;Is a rare form of breast cancer, and is on the outside of<br/>
&gt;the breast, on the nipple and areola, it appears as a rash which later =<br/>
&gt;became a lesion with a crusty outer edge. I would not have ever =<br/>
&gt;suspected it to be breast cancer but it was. My nipple never seems any =<br/>
&gt;different to me, but the rash bothered me so went to my doctors office =<br/>
&gt;for that. Sometimes it itched and was sore but other than that it didn&#39;t =<br/>
<br/>
&gt;really bother me, was just ugly and a nuisance, could not clear it up =<br/>
&gt;with all the creams had been given by doctor and dermatologist for<br/>
&gt; the dermatitis on my eyes I had just prior to this outbreak; I =<br/>
&gt;therefore went in to doctors office for<br/>
&gt;assistance. They seemed a little concerned but did not warn me it could =<br/>
&gt;be cancerous. Now I suspect there are not many women out there who know =<br/>
&gt;a lesion<br/>
&gt;or rash on the nipple or areola can be breast cancer.  What are the =<br/>
&gt;symptoms?<br/>
&gt;Mine started out as a single red pimple on the areola.  One of the =<br/>
&gt;biggest problems with Paget&#39;s disease of the nipple is that the symptoms =<br/>
<br/>
&gt;appear to be harmless. It<br/>
&gt;is frequently thought to be a skin inflammation or infections, leading =<br/>
&gt;to unfortunate delays in detection and care. =20<br/>
&gt;The symptoms include:<br/>
&gt;1.  A persistent redness, oozing, and crusting of your nipple causing it =<br/>
<br/>
&gt;to itch and burn. ( As I stated mine did not itch much or burn, and no =<br/>
&gt;oozing that I was aware of, but it did have a crust along outer edge on =<br/>
&gt;one side.<br/>
&gt;2.  A sore on your nipple that will not heal. (Mine was on the areola =<br/>
&gt;area with a whitess thick looking area in center of nipple.)<br/>
&gt;3. Usually only one nipple is affected. =20<br/>
&gt;How is it diagnosed?<br/>
&gt;Your doctor will do a physical exam, and should suggest having a =<br/>
&gt;mammogram of both breasts done immediately.  Even though the redness, =<br/>
&gt;oozing and crusting closely resemble dermatitia (inflammation of<br/>
&gt;the skin), your doctor should suspect cancer if the sore is only on one =<br/>
&gt;breast.  Your doctor should order a biopsy of your sore to confirm what =<br/>
&gt;is going on. They will take a sample of your breast tissue in that area =<br/>
&gt;to test for cancer.  If the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the =<br/>
&gt;breast, your doctor may recommend just removing the nipple and =<br/>
&gt;surrounding tissue or<br/>
&gt;suggest radiation treatments. Had my doctor caught mine right away, =<br/>
&gt;instead of flaking it off as dermatitis perhaps they could have saved my =<br/>
<br/>
&gt;breast and it  wouldn&#39;t have gone to my lymph  nodes.<br/>
&gt;This message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of your =<br/>
&gt;friends as possible; it could save someone&#39;s life.My breast cancer has =<br/>
&gt;spread and metastsized to my bones, this after receiving mega<br/>
&gt;doses of chemotherapy, 28 treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin.  =<br/>
<br/>
&gt;If this had been diagnosed in the beginning as breast cancer and treated =<br/>
<br/>
&gt;right away<br/>
&gt;perhaps it would not have spread......................<br/>
&gt;I did try to spread the word through Rosie O&#39;Donnell show on breast =<br/>
&gt;cancer awareness but it failed to trigger importance enough to be =<br/>
&gt;announced on her show last year. This is sad  as women are not aware of  =<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Paget&#39;s disease.  If by passing this around on the e-mail we can make =<br/>
&gt;others aware of it and it&#39;s potential danger, we are helping women =<br/>
&gt;everywhere.<br/>
&gt; Thanks, for taking the time to share.<br/>
