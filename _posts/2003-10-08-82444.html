<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186091434">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
sorry to bother you all with a very trivial question. I&#39;m looking for<br/>
the perfect Christmas present for my son (who will then be 5yo). He is<br/>
into everything that has wheels, generally speaking. Last year, he got<br/>
a car and a motorbike from the &quot;Hot Wheels Mechanix&quot; series and was<br/>
fascinated. He loves to work with the screw-driver and other tools,<br/>
takes apart his Playmobil cars, etc. I would love to hear suggestions<br/>
about a toy car that was specifically designed to be put together and<br/>
taken apart again dozens of times, but consisting of more than 10<br/>
simple parts. Is there anything in the US that would fit my<br/>
description? They just stared blank at me in our toy stores here in<br/>
Germany, especially when I pointed at my quite tiny for his age 4yo,<br/>
then having to explain that no, he wouldn&#39;t be interested in those<br/>
wooden toys with big screws to fix onto a bar to train his fine motor<br/>
skills. Any ideas? And please excuse the OT posting.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes from overseas,<br/>

little silver balls...you use them to make all kinds of neat things.<br/>
Nothing with wheels, but a great building toy, nonetheless.<br/>

<br/>
There was a Discovery Toys thing that could be changed from a fire truck to a <br/>
car to a pickup, I think, with different removeable fenders, roof, grill, <br/>
back end and such.  It might be too simple for a five year old, though.  <br/>
<br/>
What about a nice fire truck?  When I was a kid Texaco put out a model <br/>
firetruck about two feet long, with hoses and ladders and all that came apart.  <br/>
Maybe such a thing is still made.<br/>
<br/>
There used to be some kind of racing cars here that could break apart on <br/>
impact (stock-car style cars) and had to be popped back together.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in Germany, though, and can get Darda cars!  That&#39;s not what he likes, <br/>
maybe?  Not racing, but mechanics?<br/>
<br/>
I hope someone has some current ideas.  My kids are big now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296896635">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
thank you all for your ideas concerning the perfect present for my<br/>
son. Sandra, can you believe I had never heard of Darda cars? Are they<br/>
popular in the US? Even though the inventor is German, they don&#39;t seem<br/>
as popular as Hot Wheels and Mattel and SIKU cars over here. I found<br/>
them though and ordered a power lightning track as a Christmas present<br/>
for my son. Hope he&#39;ll enjoy it. I&#39;ll also keep in mind the little<br/>
see-through engine, maybe for next year, and your ideas led me to look<br/>
into the FischerTechnik construction kits which seem to be perfect,<br/>
just a little too advanced at this point. Thanks so much again! You<br/>
are a great bunch! Can&#39;t wait to be part of the unschooling community<br/>
IRL, not only virtually!<br/>
<br/>
Bye,<br/>
Steffi from Germany</div>
