<div id="ygrps-yiv-597638259">I saw a news item tonight on the horse-whisperer guy and the work he&#39;s doing <br/>
with a school in England and now in California, applying his gentle methods to <br/>
children. It sounded a lot like what people talk about here. They mentioned a <br/>
book and I was wondering if he had a book about children (he and his wife <br/>
fostered approx. 42 children and used those gentle methods with those needy <br/>
kids), and if so, if anyone had read it, had any opinions on it and/or knew the <br/>
title ? Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
