<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868157677">I think I started an email monster and I sure did not mean too. <br/>
<br/>
On the unschooling front.... it is cold here, icy and cold. My boys have been <br/>
busy  reading about a certain subject and when they need a break they then <br/>
draw the subjects. (I would rather not say what it is as I may start another <br/>
argument! ) It is neat how when an interest is fired kids will really go with <br/>
it. The girls have been playing their horns (sax and clarinet) and working on <br/>
their various interests. One is learning Japanese ( karate triggered) and the <br/>
other has been working with the microscope. (science geek) Funny how being <br/>
housebound changes things. Last week, when we were enjoying warm weather, <br/>
they were outside working on projects there. (My oldest is determined on <br/>
raising the finest blackberries on earth and she has been working and <br/>
studying on that. The other three have been working with the you know whats.) <br/>
 It was a nice break this evening to get out of the house and take the girls <br/>
to karate. It is a 35 mile drive and it was snowing pretty hard, yet we <br/>
plowed through mud to get to the highway. Weirdest weather. The boys prowled <br/>
through the adult section at the library, they love non-fiction, while the <br/>
girls were in class. Now we are home again and I see my email I wonder what <br/>
has happened. And it is all because my kids bought puppies. <br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone had a fun day too. <br/>
Oh and I forgot, we also played several rousting games of eye-popping bubbu. <br/>
I wish we had a big house like Sandra though, then it would have been much <br/>
more fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395380205">Well I have been absent in recent months due to a series of illnesses.  I know this topic has been discussed before, but I need help.  A good friend is telling me to look into FMS, as she thinks I am a prime candidate for such a diagnosis.  I really am starting to feel like some kind of hypochondriac because I always seem to be sick.  So educate me about FMS, what are key symptoms, and would my family doc even know what it is?  I am really finding that my life is profoundly affected by my consistently poor health, even more so that it always was as a child, since I have kids of my own to care for now and just cannot be sick this much.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my son has multiple allergy issues, as many of you may know, since we have discussed allergies before too.  He just turned four in December and I have been avoiding intrusive allergy tests because I did not want to put a young child through a lot of torture over them.  Now I am thinking, for his own safety, I need to get in to see an allergist and have some comprehensive testing done on him, as well as myself.  Any advice from parents of allergic and special medical needs children?<br/>

<br>No. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>But I will say that it is a nice way for my son and husband to talk.
<br>
<br>They read the sports page together and discuss the big game and watch TV 
<br>sports together and cheer or boo as needed. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>My son is into the stats of the various teams (can you tell I have no clue?

<br>Here, here Teri!
<br>
<br>I have a great experience to share - if anyone care and it is about 
<br>unschooling!
<br>
<br>My ds8 surprised me yesterday by taking out a workbook and doing an entire 
<br>page of division! &nbsp;I didnt even think he understood the way a division 
<br>problem looks never mind that he could actually do it! &nbsp;He told me he just 
<br>wanted to see if he was getting the &quot;multiplication thing&quot; and the &quot;division 
<br>thing&quot; is just the &quot;other part of it&quot;. &nbsp;His words! &nbsp;I was so thrilled!
<br>
<br>Why was I so thrilled - well, because like all of you (except maybe Sandra) I 
<br>have moments of self-doubt and it was very affirming to me that even though I 
<br>know in my heart he is learning and doing so amazing great out of ps - i got 
<br>to see it in black and white.
<br>
<br>I guess that is not a very &quot;unschooling&quot; thing to admit - however, i am being 
<br>truthful! &nbsp;And, it truly helps to affirm my resolve to continue to unschool!
<br>
<br>Thanks for listening - Dawn</b></font></font></html>

<br>The tests are not all that bad. &nbsp;My ds5 had a few months ago all the testing. 
<br>&nbsp;The first round was with tiny little needles 5 in a row on this plastic bar 
<br>dipped in the allergen and he had over 100 in one day and didnt even flinch 
<br>when they were pushed onto his skin. &nbsp;Said it didn&#39;t hurt at all or fell like 
<br>anything more than a push against him.
<br>
<br>The second round was actual tiny syringes of stuff being injected under the 
<br>skin. &nbsp;The allergist gave us a prescription cream called EMLA that we put on 
<br>the areas to be injected (both upper arms) two hours before the appointment. &nbsp;
<br>He did not feel a thing. &nbsp;It completely numbs the area. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I also have a cousin who has gone thru the same testing with her ds at the 
<br>age of two and had the same results. &nbsp;Not a tear shed.

Would you agree that boys have something inside them<br/>
that makes them agressive and rowdy that most girls<br/>
just dont have. I feel very outnumbered in my house<br/>
when the boys(dh included) are very excited by<br/>
something that I see as ridiculous. I sit there and<br/>
think &quot;How on earth can I live with these aliens&quot;. I<br/>
love them for who they are, its just that the<br/>
difference between the way we think is unbelievable. I<br/>
was never close to any boys in my life and now I have<br/>
4 of my own. I feel like I live on a new planet!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522088802">How do those of you that work work out your schedules?  Do you work from<br/>
home? at night? dh stays home?  Lately we have had so much going on in our<br/>
lives other than homeschooling and I am feeling a personal need to join the<br/>
workforce and be productive.  Staying at home is boring me to tears lately<br/>
but daycare is not an option for my son (health problems) and school is not<br/>
an option for my daughter (all that ps socialization crap).  I&#39;m just not<br/>
sure how I can work it out.  Any thoughts?<br/>

&gt; So I understand it in Christian terms, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like to keep on seeing it<br/>
&gt; in homeschooling discussions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wait! What about the eduaction we are getting out of<br/>

&gt; &gt; 1.  What ties us all together as unschoolers?  What is the notivation<br/>
behind<br/>
&gt; &gt; it all for everyone?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My motivation for unschooling is simply that it continues to respect<br/>
Accalia<br/>
&gt; individuality as she grows. That&#39;s why I practice attachment parenting and<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s what drew me to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.  What does everyone do for discipline when it&#39;s needed?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Truthfully we haven&#39;t had to do much &quot;discipline&quot; around here. Accalia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; getting past the point where distraction always works, but so far I&#39;ve<br/>
found<br/>
&gt; that she responds quite well to me explaining my reasoning and helping her<br/>
&gt; to express her feelings of frustration, anger, sadness, etc. I know this<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t be as easy as she gets older, but we&#39;ll take it one day at a time<br/>
:).<br/>
&gt; I guess you could say we use gentle and positive discipline. I take a lot<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; my ideas from The Discipline Book by Sears. I do not use violence in any<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; - no spanking, no yelling. And I&#39;m not too excited about timeouts as so<br/>
many<br/>
&gt; people seem to use them to punish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4.  If there are no uns/hs families around your area, what types of<br/>
people do<br/>
&gt; &gt; you like to hang out with/seek out?  The types of people that you find<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; most rewarding for your family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since Accalia is still so young, I&#39;m not actively seeking out uns/hs<br/>
&gt; families. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be very successful in this area either.  I do<br/>
&gt; have friends with children close in age to Accalia who follow the same<br/>
&gt; parenting principles I do. Those parents are who I spend most of my social<br/>
&gt; time with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What really are the most important goals for us all?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My goals for Accalia is that she will be happy with who she is, never<br/>
afraid<br/>
&gt; to learn more or search for the answers and for her to know that she can<br/>
&gt; always rely on her family.<br/>

&gt; The Consumer&#39;s Guide To Effective Environmental Choices<br/>
&gt; Practical Advice From The Union Of Concerned Scientists<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Author: Michael Brower, Warren Leon<br/>
&gt; Format: Paperback<br/>
&gt; Length: 292 pages<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; From one of the most prestigious nonprofit organizations devoted to<br/>
&gt; environmental issues comes a clear, practical, and rational overview of<br/>
&gt; the relationship between consumers and the environment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Paper or plastic? Bus or car? Old house or new? Cloth diapers or<br/>
&gt; disposable? Some choices have a huge impact on the environment; others<br/>
&gt; are of negligible importance. To those of us who care about our quality<br/>
&gt; of life and what is happening to the earth, this is a vastly important<br/>
&gt; issue. In these pages, the Union of Concerned Scientists help inform<br/>
&gt; consumers about everyday decisions that significantly affect the<br/>
&gt; environment. For example, a few major decisions -- such as the choice of<br/>
&gt; a house or vehicle -- have such a disproportionately large affect on the<br/>
&gt; environment that minor environmental infractions shrink by comparison.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This book identifies the 4 Most Significant Consumer-Related<br/>
&gt; Environmental Problems, the 7 Most Damaging Spending Categories, 11<br/>
&gt; Priority Actions, and 7 Rules for Responsible Consumption. Learn what you<br/>
&gt; can do to have a truly significant impact on our world from the people<br/>
&gt; who are at the forefront of scientific research.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Excerpts:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Consumers are often severely limited in their choices, and the economic<br/>
&gt; market is frequently structured in such a way that makes environmentally<br/>
&gt; sound options unattractive. In other cases, businesses and other<br/>
&gt; institutions, rather than individual consumers, are the key<br/>
&gt; decision-makers. Government can, and should, help expand the choices,<br/>
&gt; make responsible behavior appealing, and influence the behavior of<br/>
&gt; institutions. Good government policies are needed for action on the<br/>
&gt; personal lifestyle level to succeed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Reviews:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Too many people drive their Land Rovers to the grocery store and think<br/>
&gt; that &#39;paper or plastic&#39; is a meaningful choice. The Consumer&#39;s Guide To<br/>
&gt; Effective Environmental Choices will help you distinguish the crucial<br/>
&gt; from the trivial and make choices that are congruent with your values.<br/>

&gt; their wallets for a better environmental future.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: raising dogs &  pro-life<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure that it is known that the laws favor abortion in the U.S.,<br/>
&gt; and that people who believed that abortion should be legal had to<br/>
&gt; push their beliefs onto others or in the public eye to get the laws<br/>
&gt; changed in the first place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m also sure that reasonable people, regardless of your belief on<br/>
&gt; the subject, know that most people who respect life do not protest in<br/>
&gt; a violent manner.  Unfortunately, no matter what cause is being taken<br/>
&gt; up by the people, there are some radicals.  This is true with women&#39;s<br/>
&gt; rights, minority&#39;s rights, government protestors, as well as people<br/>
&gt; on both sides of abortion.  What constitutes violence is obviously an<br/>
&gt; opinion here since photos of tiny feet or movies depicting the<br/>
&gt; reality of what abortion is have to come from somewhere.  In my<br/>
&gt; opinion, a violent act had to take place in order for there to be<br/>
&gt; mutilated body parts.  Do people really want to see these images?  I<br/>
&gt; personally don&#39;t, but that doesn&#39;t hide the fact that these acts are<br/>
&gt; taking place and we call it &quot;abortion&quot; and it&#39;s supposed to be o.k.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since I was responding to a comment made, &quot;...that they can have an<br/>
&gt; entirely horrible life of abuse and deprivation is pooh-poohed by<br/>
&gt; right-wing Christians in comfortable homes who don&#39;t let their<br/>
&gt; children associate with the very people whose reproductive rights<br/>
&gt; they want to control.&quot;, I&#39;m wondering why it is alright to voice this<br/>
&gt; strong and not necessarily accurate view, yet it seems so offensive<br/>
&gt; to some that my view is pro-life.  Did I place judgement or call &quot;pro-<br/>
&gt; choicers&quot; anything but that?  Am I responding to left-wing Atheists?<br/>
&gt; Did I tell anyone that their opinion is &quot;the lamest bunch of nonsense<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen in a long time.&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    &gt;&gt;Do you think that you have some &quot;God Given&quot; right to shove your<br/>
&gt; beliefs down our throats, while we have no rights since we don&#39;t all<br/>
&gt; prescribe to the rules of your god.  This seems totally unfair and<br/>
&gt; hypocrital of you.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And rights?  Someone felt that they had the &quot;right&quot; to label and make<br/>
&gt; clear their &quot;pro-choice&quot; beliefs, whether I wanted to read it or<br/>
&gt; not.  But that&#39;s not shoving something down some of our throats?  I<br/>
&gt; do believe that we all have the &quot;right&quot; to our opinion and free-will,<br/>
&gt; whether you &quot;prescribe to the rules of my God&quot; or not.  Opinion and<br/>
&gt; free-will were expressed in the original post regarding abortion, yet<br/>
&gt; this is not unfair or hypocritical of that person.  I do not<br/>
&gt; understand how that can be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d also like to say that my original intention was not to offend the<br/>
&gt; author or the other users on this site.  I see that some of you have<br/>
&gt; no problem responding to this with the intention to offend.  I also<br/>
&gt; know that your beliefs certainly won&#39;t be changed by my posts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, if my husband and I want to have several children, it&#39;s supposed<br/>
&gt; to be o.k. for everyone to share with us their opinions regarding<br/>
&gt; sterilization, birth control and abortion, yet we are not supposed to<br/>
&gt; share our belief in procreation?  Again, I do not understand how that<br/>
&gt; can be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It does sadden me to see how compassionate people can be toward the<br/>
&gt; animals killed daily in our country, but that same compassion does<br/>
&gt; not seem to spill over to the humans killed daily in our country.<br/>

&gt; &gt; And when WAS the last time we saw &#39;pro-choice&#39; protesters picketing<br/>

&gt; &gt; &#39;pro-choice&#39; upon others?  I&#39;m sorry.. I generally keep my views to<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself, but this is the lamest bunch of nonsense I&#39;ve seen in a long<br/>
&gt; &gt; time.  Deb (Mom to Cory 9 1/2 and Jesse 14 months)<br/>

&gt; That strikes me as<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; She is the one who said &quot;we&quot; to begin with, including herself with the<br/>
&gt; pro-lifers. She cannot say that she is a part of a group and then say that<br/>
&gt; said group doesn&#39;t do things that we all know they do.  No, I don&#39;t know<br/>
her<br/>
&gt; personally, but I do know the deeds of the group that she includes herself<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I believe Jesus Christ was the Son of God and a beautiful example of<br/>

&gt; &gt; Do you<br/>

our<br/>
&gt; &gt;  throats, while we have no rights since we don&#39;t all prescribe to the<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow.  I think the poor woman was saying SHE does not, and unless she<br/>
emailed<br/>
&gt; you and crammed her belief down your throat, you can&#39;t call her<br/>
hypocritical.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You know, I&#39;ve been on here a couple of weeks.. I obviously don&#39;t fit in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; clique.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen a few others that don&#39;t either.  We newbies post an introduction<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; are completely ignored and unwelcomed by everyone..<br/>
&gt; I thought mine didn&#39;t go thru the first time.  I re posted.  I was greeted<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; a &quot;Yes, we saw it&quot; and a belated &quot;hello&quot; from one nice person, and totally<br/>
&gt; ignored again by everyone else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At first, I thought this was neat.. there was actually discussions on<br/>
&gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; going on.  Now there is religion and politics.  And before a bunch jump in<br/>
&gt; here to<br/>
&gt; say that unschooling encompasses all of these subjects.. I agree with<br/>
that.<br/>
&gt; BUT, to ignore the unschooling posts because everyone is in fight mode..<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have time for that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m on digest form, to save time.  This digest was nothing but one long<br/>
&gt; argument.<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t simply delete the &quot;hot&quot; threads, as the message titles don&#39;t<br/>
reflect<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; inside, and they come all together with the good ones.<br/>
&gt; The ol&#39; Delete button doesn&#39;t work so great under these circumstances, I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; scroll past all of this....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I think I will unsub... and that is kind of sad.  I am Christian, but I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; open minded to all beliefs IF that belief calls you to a higher ground.  I<br/>
&gt; respect anyone that has<br/>
&gt; a belief system that changes their behavior for the better.<br/>
&gt; I just am not seeing that here, I&#39;m seeing people trying to drag each<br/>
others<br/>
&gt; beliefs<br/>
&gt; thru the mud.... it&#39;s very sad and against every &quot;religion&quot; or belief<br/>
system<br/>
&gt; of which I am aware.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have a LOT in common.  We love our kids and give up a lot to stay with<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; and make them the best people they can be.  We share a controversial<br/>
method<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; we KNOW works... people think we&#39;re nuts..  ;o)<br/>
&gt; I had hoped that this would be enough to sustain a group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t mean to preach and run.. I just needed to get it off my chest<br/>
instead<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; just disappearing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the best to everyone!<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: Re: raising dogs & pro-life<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just have to respond, and I will probably regret<br/>
&gt; it.  I am a practicing Catholic and many of my closet friends, both<br/>
&gt; spiritually and neighborly are baptists.  Do I support the radical<br/>
pro-life<br/>
&gt; movement that burns clinics and kills people?  Of course not, and I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; hard pressed to name one person in my parish of well over a thousand<br/>
families<br/>
&gt; who would support that kind of violence.  In fact, I&#39;d be hard pressed to<br/>
&gt; find a single person in my parish who would consider any other person of<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; religion &quot;evil.&quot;  In fact, our priests regularly use protestant Christians<br/>
&gt; and members of other faiths as examples of holy life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While I certainly know from personal experience that<br/>
&gt; some people of faith aren&#39;t tolerant, I am quite reluctant to group<br/>
everyone<br/>
&gt; together.   If anyone wants a generalization of Catholicism that works<br/>
&gt; for me, it is that we believe that Christ came to redeem the world--and at<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; point everyone will be redeemed.  Do I understand how that will work?<br/>
&gt; Of course not, and I really don&#39;t want to know.  But do I believe that if<br/>
&gt; Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with every<br/>
single<br/>
&gt; idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?  I think not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are<br/>
&gt; just that--radically unbalanced.  Probably whatever group gave them some<br/>
&gt; acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of<br/>
&gt; allegiance.  I love life, and that will cause me to get involved and help<br/>
&gt; anyone I can to live a full life--old person, sick person, lonely person,<br/>
&gt; condemned person, unborn person.  Yet, I could never take it upon myself<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; judge and condemn another&#39;s actions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But please, don&#39;t take the old shibboleths and give<br/>
&gt; them new life.  I don&#39;t hate anyone, am not a &quot;fundamentalist&quot;, unless you<br/>
&gt; mean I fundamentally believe God loves us all and we should strive to do<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; same.....Susan---wife of one, mother of three, caretaker of multiple four<br/>

&gt; Not right. Duty.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been a fundamentalist Christian, and I honestly understand their<br/>
drive<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; to proselytize and to help prevent sin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Thank you for your response and for helping to make something clear.<br/>
&gt; You are correct in thinking that &quot;we&quot; does mean my husband and me.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d also like to thank you for understanding the nature of the post;<br/>
&gt; there are people who have their beliefs and do their best to lives<br/>
&gt; them out, whether it&#39;s based on spirituality or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll also thank you for seeing that people on the &quot;other side&quot; of the<br/>
&gt; pro-choice issue are attacked and that others believe they should be<br/>
&gt; the ones deciding your life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There was a message posted a little while ago that expressed the<br/>
&gt; point-of-view of some religions or fanatics.  I&#39;m not sure how one<br/>
&gt; person is the spokesperson for these religions or that that one<br/>
&gt; person should be speaking for all those belonging to those<br/>
&gt; religions.  Like all the decisions in our life, yes, they are based<br/>
&gt; on faith, but are also conscienscious, independent and free-thinking<br/>
&gt; decisions, much like our decision to unschool for countless reasons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a heated topic and all who broach it know this.  This topic<br/>
&gt; should not entitle others to vehemently critize each other.  If it<br/>
&gt; was my place, I would apologize to those of you who have been<br/>
&gt; offended, obstructed or treated in a violent way when going to<br/>
&gt; procure an abortion.  Just as, if it was my place, I would apologize<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just had to comment on the above.  The Pro-Life advocates ARE<br/>
&gt; VERY vocal and insistent about their beliefs and surely DO shove them<br/>
&gt; down the throats of others.  By your use of &quot;we&quot; I must assume you<br/>
&gt; are talking about your own family and your personal beliefs, because<br/>
&gt; the Pro-life movement is absolutely merciless.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pro-Life supporters picket clinics and shout obsceneties at<br/>
&gt; pregnant women, without knowing anything about their personal<br/>
&gt; circumstances or what brought them to the excruciating decision to<br/>
&gt; termiante a pregnancy.  The wave signs and banners with slurs and<br/>
&gt; condemnations on them, they block entrance to clinics.  The lunatic<br/>

&gt; indignant that others would find some of the behavior of the Pro-Life<br/>
&gt; movement and their campaigns to be intrusive and abusive.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am sorry that you have had to endure the shameful behavior of<br/>
&gt; others who try to judge your lifestyle.  I believe you when you say<br/>
&gt; you are attacked for your decision to live your lives in a way that<br/>
&gt; upholds your spiritual beliefs.  I get attacked for doing the very<br/>
&gt; same thing.  But remember all the hatred and nastiness that has been<br/>
&gt; flung from both sides of this issue, before you cry out injustice<br/>
&gt; over the accusations made against any one side.  This debate is a<br/>
&gt; heated one wherever it springs up because, like religion, it is a<br/>
&gt; deeply emotional issue for those involved.<br/>

&gt; &gt; No, from their point of view to adopt a &quot;to each his own&quot; attitude would<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My name is Lhiza...I currently live in Washington state...but I am a<br/>
&gt; traveling nurse...so I travel around the US working in different<br/>
&gt; hospitals...My family is in Az and I want to go back there when my oldest<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; 16...I decided to travel when I realised that me and the boys could see<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; united states and I can still get paid for it...so far it is turning out<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be an awesome educational experience...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For question 1.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know how I am tied into every other homeschooler...except that I<br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; very strongly about my beleifs that me to choose homeschooling and<br/>
&gt; subsequently unschooling.  It seems that from all the strong voices I see<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; these posts...everyone here on this list also feel strongly about what<br/>
brings<br/>
&gt; them to thier choices.  Being a single parent and having to have a full<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; job...they spend enough time away from me as it is...I don&#39;t want to send<br/>
&gt; them to PS for another 8 hours.  I also feel that the ps system is<br/>
breaking<br/>
&gt; down...to many parents trust that system to take care of their kids and<br/>
&gt; teachers are not paid enough to go thru what they have to with on a daily<br/>
&gt; basis in ps classrooms...So I am jealous of thier time away from me, I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; trust the environment provided in ps&#39;s, I don&#39;t trust a culture where<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; role models are not adults but other kids...I don&#39;t like the whole-gotta<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; popular or fit into a group mentality that ps breeds in the kids...I<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; believe that their education is my responsibility...and I feel I know more<br/>
&gt; about who they are now than I did before I took them out of ps...I can go<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; and on...for us we are living a wonderful adventure filled life that I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; allow the ills of society to intrude.  They will have plenty of time to<br/>
deal<br/>
&gt; with those ills when they grow up...now is my time with them...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For Question 2...<br/>
&gt; 90% of my discipline is what I call...on the wall...when they get out of<br/>
&gt; line...(and this is anywhere we happen to be when they get out of<br/>
&gt; line)...they have to stand on the wall...sort of like in a corner...but<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; have to keep their hands raised above thier heads...sort of like time-out<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; that they are only &#39;on the wall&#39; for the minutes that equal their number<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; years...once they have spent a minute or so on the wall...I start talking<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; them about what put them on the wall...and they usually end up off the<br/>
wall<br/>
&gt; as soon as they have verbalized why they ended up there and how they can<br/>
stay<br/>
&gt; &#39;off the wall&#39;...my sister always trys to say...You have to be on the wall<br/>
&gt; for 30 minutes and she doesn&#39;t talk to them...so they end up uncomfortable<br/>
&gt; for that long and it is more like punishment...I don&#39;t put a time on<br/>
it...I<br/>
&gt; depend on more if they can learn how to keep off the wall...if they need<br/>
&gt; quiet time...I give them an activity to do...if they are really grumpy and<br/>
&gt; have a hard time getting along...then we all take a break...maybe take a<br/>
&gt; nap...read a book...usually something relaxing...maybe watch some tv...if<br/>
&gt; they are rowdy...then we leave the house...they probably have cabin<br/>
fever...I<br/>
&gt; have rules and expectations...they get fired if they blow off their chores<br/>
&gt; and have to earn thier allowance back...etc etc...it works for us...there<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; alot of respect between the three of us...I have no problems telling them<br/>
&gt; what I need from them and they have no problems helping me out...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Question 4<br/>
&gt; We sought out 4H...and one of my best friends...Carrie...also homeschools<br/>
her<br/>
&gt; three kids and was homeschooled...so she is a great support...I am hoping<br/>
&gt; that as we travel the US...we will get to meet many different hs&#39;ers and<br/>
&gt; uns&#39;ers...and I am working on getting involved with church...that is the<br/>
&gt; hardest cuz I am very eclectic in my spirituality...Christians only want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; know about my experience with Jesus and pagans only want to know what<br/>
&gt; magickal tradition I follow...I feel that all paths have something<br/>
important<br/>
&gt; to teach and I don&#39;t want to be closed to any particular one...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t speak for anyone else...but my goals is to teach my kids that as a<br/>
&gt; family...we are a team...and we are connected...I hope that they will move<br/>
&gt; into adulthood with a sense that they have a responsibility to help our<br/>
world<br/>
&gt; change and grow...and mostly I want us to have fun and a zest for<br/>
life...it<br/>
&gt; seems that too many kids are unhappy with their lot...I hope that our<br/>
family<br/>
&gt; structure keeps unhappiness at bay...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll say it again - thank you, Candice, for interpreting the &quot;we&quot; for<br/>
&gt; what it is.  And no, there isn&#39;t another person on the message board<br/>
&gt; who knows me or my family personally (or least that I know of).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a self-titled &quot;pro-lifer&quot; and there is no denial about what some<br/>
&gt; people in this group do.  Just as I would believe that a &quot;pro-<br/>
&gt; choicer&quot; doesn&#39;t want to be considered a baby-killer just because<br/>
&gt; they believe in choice or what others are paid to do under the<br/>
&gt; title &quot;abortion&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, no, I do not blow up abortion clinics or kill abortionists.  I do<br/>
&gt; not condone that behavior (my logic & heart says that would not be<br/>
&gt; respecting life very much, would it?).  I personally do not believe<br/>
&gt; that every black person who was part of the civil rights movement was<br/>
&gt; a militant activist or that I am either just because I believe in<br/>
&gt; civil rights.  Just as those who have committed unspeakable acts<br/>
&gt; against humanity in the name of their beliefs toward the government<br/>
&gt; are speaking or acting for me in anyway.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just have to respond, and I will probably regret<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  I am a practicing Catholic and many of my closet friends, both<br/>
&gt; &gt; spiritually and neighborly are baptists.  Do I support the radical<br/>
&gt; pro-life<br/>
&gt; &gt; movement that burns clinics and kills people?  Of course not, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard pressed to name one person in my parish of well over a<br/>
&gt; thousand families<br/>
&gt; &gt; who would support that kind of violence.  In fact, I&#39;d be hard<br/>
&gt; pressed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a single person in my parish who would consider any other<br/>
&gt; person of any<br/>
&gt; &gt; religion &quot;evil.&quot;  In fact, our priests regularly use protestant<br/>
&gt; Christians<br/>
&gt; &gt; and members of other faiths as examples of holy life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; While I certainly know from personal experience that<br/>
&gt; &gt; some people of faith aren&#39;t tolerant, I am quite reluctant to group<br/>
&gt; everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; together.   If anyone wants a generalization of Catholicism that<br/>
&gt; works<br/>
&gt; &gt; for me, it is that we believe that Christ came to redeem the world--<br/>
&gt; and at some<br/>
&gt; &gt; point everyone will be redeemed.  Do I understand how that will<br/>
&gt; work?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course not, and I really don&#39;t want to know.  But do I believe<br/>
&gt; that if<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with<br/>
&gt; every single<br/>
&gt; &gt; idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?  I think not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are<br/>
&gt; &gt; just that--radically unbalanced.  Probably whatever group gave them<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of<br/>
&gt; &gt; allegiance.  I love life, and that will cause me to get involved<br/>
&gt; and help<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone I can to live a full life--old person, sick person, lonely<br/>
&gt; person,<br/>
&gt; &gt; condemned person, unborn person.  Yet, I could never take it upon<br/>
&gt; myself to<br/>
&gt; &gt; judge and condemn another&#39;s actions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But please, don&#39;t take the old shibboleths and give<br/>
&gt; &gt; them new life.  I don&#39;t hate anyone, am not a &quot;fundamentalist&quot;,<br/>

&gt; Subject: messy vs. disorganized<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My house is a mess most of the time, which I wouldn&#39;t really care about,<br/>
&gt; except it seems we lose stuff in the mess, and then other stuff becomes<br/>
&gt; useless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For instance, we have lost chess pieces, some playing cards, Mancala<br/>
pieces,<br/>
&gt; parts of Transformers, crucial cards in a board game, dice, etc. Games<br/>
seem<br/>
&gt; to be particular victims of this syndrome. All you have to lose is one or<br/>
&gt; two things out of a game and it becomes a lot less fun, if not impossible,<br/>
&gt; to play. The pieces get scattered around then the games are no good. This<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; the downside of a messy house as far as I&#39;m concerned. (We also lose<br/>
bigger<br/>
&gt; things like books, reading glasses, remote controls and toys, but at least<br/>
&gt; they seem to show up eventually.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps other people are better than I am at getting their kids to put<br/>
away<br/>
&gt; their games when they decide to do something else (&quot;when they are finished<br/>
&gt; with them&quot; would be misleading, since they&#39;re always quitting halfway<br/>
&gt; through and running off without a glance backward). You would think that<br/>
&gt; after having puzzles, games, models and other items with small pieces<br/>
&gt; rendered unusable because parts had been lost, that they&#39;d be more<br/>
&gt; conscientious, but nooooo. They don&#39;t waste much time regretting that<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; games and puzzles are ruined, but I&#39;m sorry about it because I think those<br/>
&gt; things offer valuable learning experiences (plus they cost money, after<br/>
&gt; all).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My boys are 8 and 4.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the way, I have been on this list for a long time, and reading<br/>
&gt; everything, but lurking a lot lately.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not totally correct either.  Not all pro-life views include a ban on birth<br/>

is<br/>
&gt; not a promotion of more humans but the same right to life as those already<br/>

practice<br/>
&gt; birth control, usually those methods which prevent fertilization rather<br/>
than<br/>

&gt; &gt; So, if my husband and I want to have several children, it&#39;s supposed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be o.k. for everyone to share with us their opinions regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt; sterilization, birth control and abortion, yet we are not supposed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; share our belief in procreation?  Again, I do not understand how that<br/>
&gt; &gt; can be.<br/>

&gt; &gt; March!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chris,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally I just think some people are thoughtless, and therefore often<br/>
&gt; offend others, whether they intend to or not.  I don&#39;t think the people<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; question your family size are really coming from a pro-choice stance, I<br/>
&gt; think they&#39;re just obnoxious people who probably think everyone should be<br/>
&gt; just like them.  I face the same criticism, but in reverse, we have one<br/>
&gt; child, and we have no plans for more.  I am always amazed by the nerve of<br/>
&gt; people who tell us how unfair we are, how selfish we are not to provide<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; son with his own little sibling playmate.  I refuse to explain to any of<br/>
&gt; them why we have an only child, there is no way to win this conversation,<br/>
&gt; just as there is no way to win an argument on abortion.  These are issues<br/>
&gt; that people have already made up their minds on, and too often there is no<br/>
&gt; tolerance nor understanding of  anyone who may have a different opinion<br/>
&gt; (usually due to having a different life experience).  So congratulations<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the new baby, and  I wish you & your family continued joy & happiness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cindy L.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW-  I am non-religious, with deeply held spiritual beliefs.  I am<br/>
&gt; adamantly pro-choice.  I use natural family planning.  My pregnancy was<br/>
&gt; unplanned, and seemingly inconvenient- I took it as a profound gift, and I<br/>
&gt; never once considered any other option than giving birth, I never had an<br/>
&gt; ultrasound even though I was in my late 30&#39;s at the time- I have never had<br/>
&gt; such a sense of &#39;faith&#39; as I did with my pregnancy.  I go by my intuition.<br/>
&gt; I understand that other people are guided (or not) by their own intuition,<br/>
&gt; or beliefs.  I try my best not to judge the choices that other people<br/>
&gt; make...... Just to explain where I&#39;m coming from.  (I also understand that<br/>
&gt; many people think I&#39;m just flaky, that&#39;s ok, too.)<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Many people who embrace a pro-life view are in favor of and practice<br/>
&gt; &gt; birth control, usually those methods which prevent fertilization rather<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; &gt; implantation.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kris<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Something I have wondered for years.............what is the &quot;official&quot;<br/>
&gt; pro-life view on how to proceed when a tubal pregnancy is discovered?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I will go ahead and expose myself here......once I had borne a child I<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; not know that I would be capable of choosing abortion for myself even<br/>
under<br/>
&gt; extreme circumstances  (but who can say for sure how one would proceed<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; faced with reality instead of  &quot;if it were  me&quot;).    I am adamantly<br/>
&gt; pro-choice----whether it be choice concerning elective sterilization<br/>
(instead of<br/>
&gt; coerced after 1 healthy child for some races and incomes and denied for<br/>
others<br/>
&gt; who seek it);  choice of practicing reasonably safe means of family<br/>
planning;<br/>
&gt; choice of attending a particular church or no church; choice to conceive a<br/>
child<br/>
&gt; even if life partner is infertile;  choice of means of education for self<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; family;  and  yes, personal choice concerning whether to carry a<br/>
particular<br/>
&gt; pregnancy into viability.       I believe I can only claim to support<br/>
choice if<br/>
&gt; I acknowledge that  my choice might well differ from someone else&#39;s.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think I started an email monster and I sure did not mean too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the unschooling front.... it is cold here, icy and cold. My boys have<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; busy  reading about a certain subject and when they need a break they then<br/>
&gt; draw the subjects. (I would rather not say what it is as I may start<br/>
another<br/>
&gt; argument! ) It is neat how when an interest is fired kids will really go<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; it. The girls have been playing their horns (sax and clarinet) and working<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; their various interests. One is learning Japanese ( karate triggered) and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; other has been working with the microscope. (science geek) Funny how being<br/>
&gt; housebound changes things. Last week, when we were enjoying warm weather,<br/>
&gt; they were outside working on projects there. (My oldest is determined on<br/>
&gt; raising the finest blackberries on earth and she has been working and<br/>
&gt; studying on that. The other three have been working with the you know<br/>
whats.)<br/>
&gt;  It was a nice break this evening to get out of the house and take the<br/>
girls<br/>
&gt; to karate. It is a 35 mile drive and it was snowing pretty hard, yet we<br/>
&gt; plowed through mud to get to the highway. Weirdest weather. The boys<br/>
prowled<br/>
&gt; through the adult section at the library, they love non-fiction, while the<br/>
&gt; girls were in class. Now we are home again and I see my email I wonder<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; has happened. And it is all because my kids bought puppies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope everyone had a fun day too.<br/>
&gt; Oh and I forgot, we also played several rousting games of eye-popping<br/>
bubbu.<br/>
&gt; I wish we had a big house like Sandra though, then it would have been much<br/>
&gt; more fun!<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Why was I so thrilled - well, because like all of you (except maybe <br/>
Sandra) I <br/>
 have moments of self-doubt and it was very affirming to me that even though <br/>
I <br/>
 know in my heart he is learning and doing so amazing great out of ps - i got <br/>
 to see it in black and white.<br/>
 <br/>
 I guess that is not a very &quot;unschooling&quot; thing to admit - however, i am <br/>
being <br/>
 truthful!  And, it truly helps to affirm my resolve to continue to unschool!<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks for listening - Dawn &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do those of you that work work out your schedules?  Do you work from<br/>
&gt;home? at night? dh stays home?  Lately we have had so much going on in our<br/>
&gt;lives other than homeschooling and I am feeling a personal need to join the<br/>
&gt;workforce and be productive.  Staying at home is boring me to tears lately<br/>
&gt;but daycare is not an option for my son (health problems) and school is not<br/>
&gt;an option for my daughter (all that ps socialization crap).  I&#39;m just not<br/>
&gt;sure how I can work it out.  Any thoughts?<br/>

&gt; &gt; So I understand it in Christian terms, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; like to keep on seeing it<br/>
&gt; &gt; in homeschooling discussions.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wait! What about the eduaction we are getting out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; this intellegent discussion on abortion and dog<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I believe Jesus Christ was the Son of God and a beautiful example of <br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Introduction<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Welcome Vic!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m Amy, 24, SAHM to 19-month-old Accalia Grace. We live in snowy South<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dakota (just got 20 inches today).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  What ties us all together as unschoolers?  What is the notivation<br/>
&gt;behind<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it all for everyone?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My motivation for unschooling is simply that it continues to respect<br/>
&gt;Accalia<br/>
&gt; &gt; individuality as she grows. That&#39;s why I practice attachment parenting <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s what drew me to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.  What does everyone do for discipline when it&#39;s needed?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Truthfully we haven&#39;t had to do much &quot;discipline&quot; around here. Accalia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting past the point where distraction always works, but so far I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;found<br/>
&gt; &gt; that she responds quite well to me explaining my reasoning and helping <br/>
&gt;her<br/>
&gt; &gt; to express her feelings of frustration, anger, sadness, etc. I know this<br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t be as easy as she gets older, but we&#39;ll take it one day at a time<br/>
&gt;:).<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess you could say we use gentle and positive discipline. I take a <br/>
&gt;lot<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; my ideas from The Discipline Book by Sears. I do not use violence in any<br/>
&gt;way<br/>
&gt; &gt; - no spanking, no yelling. And I&#39;m not too excited about timeouts as so<br/>
&gt;many<br/>
&gt; &gt; people seem to use them to punish.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.  If there are no uns/hs families around your area, what types of<br/>
&gt;people do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you like to hang out with/seek out?  The types of people that you find<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most rewarding for your family.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since Accalia is still so young, I&#39;m not actively seeking out uns/hs<br/>
&gt; &gt; families. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be very successful in this area either.  I do<br/>
&gt; &gt; have friends with children close in age to Accalia who follow the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; parenting principles I do. Those parents are who I spend most of my <br/>
&gt;social<br/>
&gt; &gt; time with.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What really are the most important goals for us all?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My goals for Accalia is that she will be happy with who she is, never<br/>
&gt;afraid<br/>
&gt; &gt; to learn more or search for the answers and for her to know that she can<br/>
&gt; &gt; always rely on her family.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; The Consumer&#39;s Guide To Effective Environmental Choices<br/>
&gt; &gt; Practical Advice From The Union Of Concerned Scientists<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Author: Michael Brower, Warren Leon<br/>
&gt; &gt; Format: Paperback<br/>
&gt; &gt; Length: 292 pages<br/>
&gt; &gt; Publisher: Three Rivers Press<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Item #: BTCGTEEC<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Price: $15.00<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; From one of the most prestigious nonprofit organizations devoted to<br/>
&gt; &gt; environmental issues comes a clear, practical, and rational overview of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the relationship between consumers and the environment.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paper or plastic? Bus or car? Old house or new? Cloth diapers or<br/>
&gt; &gt; disposable? Some choices have a huge impact on the environment; others<br/>
&gt; &gt; are of negligible importance. To those of us who care about our quality<br/>
&gt; &gt; of life and what is happening to the earth, this is a vastly important<br/>
&gt; &gt; issue. In these pages, the Union of Concerned Scientists help inform<br/>
&gt; &gt; consumers about everyday decisions that significantly affect the<br/>
&gt; &gt; environment. For example, a few major decisions -- such as the choice of<br/>
&gt; &gt; a house or vehicle -- have such a disproportionately large affect on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; environment that minor environmental infractions shrink by comparison.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This book identifies the 4 Most Significant Consumer-Related<br/>
&gt; &gt; Environmental Problems, the 7 Most Damaging Spending Categories, 11<br/>
&gt; &gt; Priority Actions, and 7 Rules for Responsible Consumption. Learn what <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can do to have a truly significant impact on our world from the people<br/>
&gt; &gt; who are at the forefront of scientific research.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Excerpts:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Consumers are often severely limited in their choices, and the economic<br/>
&gt; &gt; market is frequently structured in such a way that makes environmentally<br/>
&gt; &gt; sound options unattractive. In other cases, businesses and other<br/>
&gt; &gt; institutions, rather than individual consumers, are the key<br/>
&gt; &gt; decision-makers. Government can, and should, help expand the choices,<br/>
&gt; &gt; make responsible behavior appealing, and influence the behavior of<br/>
&gt; &gt; institutions. Good government policies are needed for action on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; personal lifestyle level to succeed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Reviews:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Too many people drive their Land Rovers to the grocery store and think<br/>
&gt; &gt; that &#39;paper or plastic&#39; is a meaningful choice. The Consumer&#39;s Guide To<br/>
&gt; &gt; Effective Environmental Choices will help you distinguish the crucial<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the trivial and make choices that are congruent with your values.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: raising dogs &  pro-life<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure that it is known that the laws favor abortion in the U.S.,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and that people who believed that abortion should be legal had to<br/>
&gt; &gt; push their beliefs onto others or in the public eye to get the laws<br/>
&gt; &gt; changed in the first place.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m also sure that reasonable people, regardless of your belief on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the subject, know that most people who respect life do not protest in<br/>
&gt; &gt; a violent manner.  Unfortunately, no matter what cause is being taken<br/>
&gt; &gt; up by the people, there are some radicals.  This is true with women&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; rights, minority&#39;s rights, government protestors, as well as people<br/>
&gt; &gt; on both sides of abortion.  What constitutes violence is obviously an<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinion here since photos of tiny feet or movies depicting the<br/>
&gt; &gt; reality of what abortion is have to come from somewhere.  In my<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinion, a violent act had to take place in order for there to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; mutilated body parts.  Do people really want to see these images?  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; personally don&#39;t, but that doesn&#39;t hide the fact that these acts are<br/>
&gt; &gt; taking place and we call it &quot;abortion&quot; and it&#39;s supposed to be o.k.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since I was responding to a comment made, &quot;...that they can have an<br/>
&gt; &gt; entirely horrible life of abuse and deprivation is pooh-poohed by<br/>
&gt; &gt; right-wing Christians in comfortable homes who don&#39;t let their<br/>
&gt; &gt; children associate with the very people whose reproductive rights<br/>
&gt; &gt; they want to control.&quot;, I&#39;m wondering why it is alright to voice this<br/>
&gt; &gt; strong and not necessarily accurate view, yet it seems so offensive<br/>
&gt; &gt; to some that my view is pro-life.  Did I place judgement or call &quot;pro-<br/>
&gt; &gt; choicers&quot; anything but that?  Am I responding to left-wing Atheists?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Did I tell anyone that their opinion is &quot;the lamest bunch of nonsense<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen in a long time.&quot;?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    &gt;&gt;Do you think that you have some &quot;God Given&quot; right to shove your<br/>
&gt; &gt; beliefs down our throats, while we have no rights since we don&#39;t all<br/>
&gt; &gt; prescribe to the rules of your god.  This seems totally unfair and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hypocrital of you.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And rights?  Someone felt that they had the &quot;right&quot; to label and make<br/>
&gt; &gt; clear their &quot;pro-choice&quot; beliefs, whether I wanted to read it or<br/>
&gt; &gt; not.  But that&#39;s not shoving something down some of our throats?  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; do believe that we all have the &quot;right&quot; to our opinion and free-will,<br/>
&gt; &gt; whether you &quot;prescribe to the rules of my God&quot; or not.  Opinion and<br/>
&gt; &gt; free-will were expressed in the original post regarding abortion, yet<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is not unfair or hypocritical of that person.  I do not<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand how that can be.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d also like to say that my original intention was not to offend the<br/>
&gt; &gt; author or the other users on this site.  I see that some of you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; no problem responding to this with the intention to offend.  I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; know that your beliefs certainly won&#39;t be changed by my posts.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, if my husband and I want to have several children, it&#39;s supposed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be o.k. for everyone to share with us their opinions regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt; sterilization, birth control and abortion, yet we are not supposed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; share our belief in procreation?  Again, I do not understand how that<br/>
&gt; &gt; can be.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It does sadden me to see how compassionate people can be toward the<br/>
&gt; &gt; animals killed daily in our country, but that same compassion does<br/>
&gt; &gt; not seem to spill over to the humans killed daily in our country.<br/>

&gt; &gt; the two previous quotes to him to help him understand how he and his <br/>

&gt; &gt; friends maybe do share some common ground in that way, and he <br/>
&gt;immediately<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a ridgeback rescue?? I have heard of the greyhound rescue but<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think most breeds have rescue programs now.  It for abandoned dogs or<br/>
&gt; &gt; for people who for whatever reason cannot keep their dogs.   I know here<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Northern CA they have arrangements with shelters to take the dogs<br/>
&gt; &gt; Reading about what happens to some of them is heartbreaking!  My FIL<br/>
&gt; &gt; was looking into adopting one but then he decided to get a puppy.  She<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a delight and is really keeping him young and active (he&#39;s 76).  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ridgeback is 5.5; when my son gets a bit older we will get another one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; A 3 year old and a puppy just don&#39;t mix well!  I really love these dogs!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  think that you have some &quot;God Given&quot; right to shove your beliefs down<br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  throats, while we have no rights since we don&#39;t all prescribe to the<br/>
&gt;rules<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  of your god.  This seems totally unfair and hypocrital of you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wow.  I think the poor woman was saying SHE does not, and unless she<br/>
&gt;emailed<br/>
&gt; &gt; you and crammed her belief down your throat, you can&#39;t call her<br/>
&gt;hypocritical.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You know, I&#39;ve been on here a couple of weeks.. I obviously don&#39;t fit in<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; clique.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen a few others that don&#39;t either.  We newbies post an <br/>
&gt;introduction<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; are completely ignored and unwelcomed by everyone..<br/>
&gt; &gt; I thought mine didn&#39;t go thru the first time.  I re posted.  I was <br/>
&gt;greeted<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; a &quot;Yes, we saw it&quot; and a belated &quot;hello&quot; from one nice person, and <br/>
&gt;totally<br/>
&gt; &gt; ignored again by everyone else.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; At first, I thought this was neat.. there was actually discussions on<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; going on.  Now there is religion and politics.  And before a bunch jump <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; here to<br/>
&gt; &gt; say that unschooling encompasses all of these subjects.. I agree with<br/>
&gt;that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; BUT, to ignore the unschooling posts because everyone is in fight mode..<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have time for that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m on digest form, to save time.  This digest was nothing but one long<br/>
&gt; &gt; argument.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t simply delete the &quot;hot&quot; threads, as the message titles don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;reflect<br/>
&gt; &gt; what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; inside, and they come all together with the good ones.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The ol&#39; Delete button doesn&#39;t work so great under these circumstances, I<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; scroll past all of this....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So I think I will unsub... and that is kind of sad.  I am Christian, but <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt; &gt; open minded to all beliefs IF that belief calls you to a higher ground.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; respect anyone that has<br/>
&gt; &gt; a belief system that changes their behavior for the better.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just am not seeing that here, I&#39;m seeing people trying to drag each<br/>
&gt;others<br/>
&gt; &gt; beliefs<br/>
&gt; &gt; thru the mud.... it&#39;s very sad and against every &quot;religion&quot; or belief<br/>
&gt;system<br/>
&gt; &gt; of which I am aware.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We have a LOT in common.  We love our kids and give up a lot to stay <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt; &gt; and make them the best people they can be.  We share a controversial<br/>
&gt;method<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; we KNOW works... people think we&#39;re nuts..  ;o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had hoped that this would be enough to sustain a group.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t mean to preach and run.. I just needed to get it off my chest<br/>
&gt;instead<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; just disappearing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Re: raising dogs & pro-life<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just have to respond, and I will probably regret<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  I am a practicing Catholic and many of my closet friends, both<br/>
&gt; &gt; spiritually and neighborly are baptists.  Do I support the radical<br/>
&gt;pro-life<br/>
&gt; &gt; movement that burns clinics and kills people?  Of course not, and I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard pressed to name one person in my parish of well over a thousand<br/>
&gt;families<br/>
&gt; &gt; who would support that kind of violence.  In fact, I&#39;d be hard pressed <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a single person in my parish who would consider any other person of<br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt; religion &quot;evil.&quot;  In fact, our priests regularly use protestant <br/>
&gt;Christians<br/>
&gt; &gt; and members of other faiths as examples of holy life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; While I certainly know from personal experience that<br/>
&gt; &gt; some people of faith aren&#39;t tolerant, I am quite reluctant to group<br/>
&gt;everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; together.   If anyone wants a generalization of Catholicism that works<br/>
&gt; &gt; for me, it is that we believe that Christ came to redeem the world--and <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt; &gt; point everyone will be redeemed.  Do I understand how that will work?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course not, and I really don&#39;t want to know.  But do I believe that <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with every<br/>
&gt;single<br/>
&gt; &gt; idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?  I think not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are<br/>
&gt; &gt; just that--radically unbalanced.  Probably whatever group gave them some<br/>
&gt; &gt; acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of<br/>
&gt; &gt; allegiance.  I love life, and that will cause me to get involved and <br/>
&gt;help<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone I can to live a full life--old person, sick person, lonely <br/>
&gt;person,<br/>
&gt; &gt; condemned person, unborn person.  Yet, I could never take it upon myself<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; judge and condemn another&#39;s actions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But please, don&#39;t take the old shibboleths and give<br/>
&gt; &gt; them new life.  I don&#39;t hate anyone, am not a &quot;fundamentalist&quot;, unless <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; mean I fundamentally believe God loves us all and we should strive to do<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same.....Susan---wife of one, mother of three, caretaker of multiple <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thank you for your response and for helping to make something clear.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You are correct in thinking that &quot;we&quot; does mean my husband and me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d also like to thank you for understanding the nature of the post;<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are people who have their beliefs and do their best to lives<br/>
&gt; &gt; them out, whether it&#39;s based on spirituality or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll also thank you for seeing that people on the &quot;other side&quot; of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; pro-choice issue are attacked and that others believe they should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; the ones deciding your life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There was a message posted a little while ago that expressed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; point-of-view of some religions or fanatics.  I&#39;m not sure how one<br/>
&gt; &gt; person is the spokesperson for these religions or that that one<br/>
&gt; &gt; person should be speaking for all those belonging to those<br/>
&gt; &gt; religions.  Like all the decisions in our life, yes, they are based<br/>
&gt; &gt; on faith, but are also conscienscious, independent and free-thinking<br/>
&gt; &gt; decisions, much like our decision to unschool for countless reasons.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is a heated topic and all who broach it know this.  This topic<br/>
&gt; &gt; should not entitle others to vehemently critize each other.  If it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was my place, I would apologize to those of you who have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; offended, obstructed or treated in a violent way when going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; procure an abortion.  Just as, if it was my place, I would apologize<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the women who have chosen abortion and have suffered the sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; painful consequences of it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; First of all, congratulations on your impending arrival, my borther<br/>
&gt; &gt; and his wife just had a new baby two weeks ago.  Very exciting for<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone, especially their two daughters.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just had to comment on the above.  The Pro-Life advocates ARE<br/>
&gt; &gt; VERY vocal and insistent about their beliefs and surely DO shove them<br/>
&gt; &gt; down the throats of others.  By your use of &quot;we&quot; I must assume you<br/>
&gt; &gt; are talking about your own family and your personal beliefs, because<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Pro-life movement is absolutely merciless.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pro-Life supporters picket clinics and shout obsceneties at<br/>
&gt; &gt; pregnant women, without knowing anything about their personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; circumstances or what brought them to the excruciating decision to<br/>
&gt; &gt; termiante a pregnancy.  The wave signs and banners with slurs and<br/>
&gt; &gt; condemnations on them, they block entrance to clinics.  The lunatic<br/>
&gt; &gt; fringe of this movement has shot and killed people over<br/>
&gt; &gt; their &quot;Defense of Life.&quot;  I am baffled as to why you would feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; indignant that others would find some of the behavior of the Pro-Life<br/>
&gt; &gt; movement and their campaigns to be intrusive and abusive.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am sorry that you have had to endure the shameful behavior of<br/>
&gt; &gt; others who try to judge your lifestyle.  I believe you when you say<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are attacked for your decision to live your lives in a way that<br/>
&gt; &gt; upholds your spiritual beliefs.  I get attacked for doing the very<br/>
&gt; &gt; same thing.  But remember all the hatred and nastiness that has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; flung from both sides of this issue, before you cry out injustice<br/>
&gt; &gt; over the accusations made against any one side.  This debate is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; heated one wherever it springs up because, like religion, it is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; deeply emotional issue for those involved.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you for your response and for helping to make something clear.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You are correct in thinking that &quot;we&quot; does mean my husband and me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d also like to thank you for understanding the nature of the post;<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are people who have their beliefs and do their best to lives<br/>
&gt; &gt; them out, whether it&#39;s based on spirituality or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll also thank you for seeing that people on the &quot;other side&quot; of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; pro-choice issue are attacked and that others believe they should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; the ones deciding your life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There was a message posted a little while ago that expressed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; point-of-view of some religions or fanatics.  I&#39;m not sure how one<br/>
&gt; &gt; person is the spokesperson for these religions or that that one<br/>
&gt; &gt; person should be speaking for all those belonging to those<br/>
&gt; &gt; religions.  Like all the decisions in our life, yes, they are based<br/>
&gt; &gt; on faith, but are also conscienscious, independent and free-thinking<br/>
&gt; &gt; decisions, much like our decision to unschool for countless reasons.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is a heated topic and all who broach it know this.  This topic<br/>
&gt; &gt; should not entitle others to vehemently critize each other.  If it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was my place, I would apologize to those of you who have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; offended, obstructed or treated in a violent way when going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; procure an abortion.  Just as, if it was my place, I would apologize<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the women who have chosen abortion and have suffered the sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; painful consequences of it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; First of all, congratulations on your impending arrival, my borther<br/>
&gt; &gt; and his wife just had a new baby two weeks ago.  Very exciting for<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone, especially their two daughters.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just had to comment on the above.  The Pro-Life advocates ARE<br/>
&gt; &gt; VERY vocal and insistent about their beliefs and surely DO shove them<br/>
&gt; &gt; down the throats of others.  By your use of &quot;we&quot; I must assume you<br/>
&gt; &gt; are talking about your own family and your personal beliefs, because<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Pro-life movement is absolutely merciless.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pro-Life supporters picket clinics and shout obsceneties at<br/>
&gt; &gt; pregnant women, without knowing anything about their personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; circumstances or what brought them to the excruciating decision to<br/>
&gt; &gt; termiante a pregnancy.  The wave signs and banners with slurs and<br/>
&gt; &gt; condemnations on them, they block entrance to clinics.  The lunatic<br/>
&gt; &gt; fringe of this movement has shot and killed people over<br/>
&gt; &gt; their &quot;Defense of Life.&quot;  I am baffled as to why you would feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; indignant that others would find some of the behavior of the Pro-Life<br/>
&gt; &gt; movement and their campaigns to be intrusive and abusive.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am sorry that you have had to endure the shameful behavior of<br/>
&gt; &gt; others who try to judge your lifestyle.  I believe you when you say<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are attacked for your decision to live your lives in a way that<br/>
&gt; &gt; upholds your spiritual beliefs.  I get attacked for doing the very<br/>
&gt; &gt; same thing.  But remember all the hatred and nastiness that has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; flung from both sides of this issue, before you cry out injustice<br/>
&gt; &gt; over the accusations made against any one side.  This debate is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; heated one wherever it springs up because, like religion, it is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; deeply emotional issue for those involved.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nanci K.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just wanted to point out what I thought was a mistaken statement,<br/>
&gt; &gt; not debating or starting a fight.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, from their point of view to adopt a &quot;to each his own&quot; attitude <br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  to condemn non-believers to hell.  They NEED to try to convert <br/>
&gt;others.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jesus<br/>

&gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t make such a generalization.  I&#39;m Christian and I think for<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you hit an overbearing, over zealot lot of Christians, I&#39;m sorry.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: Answering Vic&#39;c intro...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My name is Lhiza...I currently live in Washington state...but I am a<br/>
&gt; &gt; traveling nurse...so I travel around the US working in different<br/>
&gt; &gt; hospitals...My family is in Az and I want to go back there when my <br/>
&gt;oldest<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; 16...I decided to travel when I realised that me and the boys could see<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; united states and I can still get paid for it...so far it is turning out<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be an awesome educational experience...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For question 1.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know how I am tied into every other homeschooler...except that I<br/>
&gt;feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; very strongly about my beleifs that me to choose homeschooling and<br/>
&gt; &gt; subsequently unschooling.  It seems that from all the strong voices I <br/>
&gt;see<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; these posts...everyone here on this list also feel strongly about what<br/>
&gt;brings<br/>
&gt; &gt; them to thier choices.  Being a single parent and having to have a full<br/>
&gt;time<br/>
&gt; &gt; job...they spend enough time away from me as it is...I don&#39;t want to <br/>
&gt;send<br/>
&gt; &gt; them to PS for another 8 hours.  I also feel that the ps system is<br/>
&gt;breaking<br/>
&gt; &gt; down...to many parents trust that system to take care of their kids and<br/>
&gt; &gt; teachers are not paid enough to go thru what they have to with on a <br/>
&gt;daily<br/>
&gt; &gt; basis in ps classrooms...So I am jealous of thier time away from me, I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; trust the environment provided in ps&#39;s, I don&#39;t trust a culture where<br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt; &gt; role models are not adults but other kids...I don&#39;t like the whole-gotta<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; popular or fit into a group mentality that ps breeds in the kids...I<br/>
&gt;really<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe that their education is my responsibility...and I feel I know <br/>
&gt;more<br/>
&gt; &gt; about who they are now than I did before I took them out of ps...I can <br/>
&gt;go<br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt; &gt; and on...for us we are living a wonderful adventure filled life that I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; allow the ills of society to intrude.  They will have plenty of time to<br/>
&gt;deal<br/>
&gt; &gt; with those ills when they grow up...now is my time with them...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For Question 2...<br/>
&gt; &gt; 90% of my discipline is what I call...on the wall...when they get out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; line...(and this is anywhere we happen to be when they get out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; line)...they have to stand on the wall...sort of like in a corner...but<br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to keep their hands raised above thier heads...sort of like <br/>
&gt;time-out<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they are only &#39;on the wall&#39; for the minutes that equal their number<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; years...once they have spent a minute or so on the wall...I start <br/>
&gt;talking<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; them about what put them on the wall...and they usually end up off the<br/>
&gt;wall<br/>
&gt; &gt; as soon as they have verbalized why they ended up there and how they can<br/>
&gt;stay<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;off the wall&#39;...my sister always trys to say...You have to be on the <br/>
&gt;wall<br/>
&gt; &gt; for 30 minutes and she doesn&#39;t talk to them...so they end up <br/>
&gt;uncomfortable<br/>
&gt; &gt; for that long and it is more like punishment...I don&#39;t put a time on<br/>
&gt;it...I<br/>
&gt; &gt; depend on more if they can learn how to keep off the wall...if they need<br/>
&gt; &gt; quiet time...I give them an activity to do...if they are really grumpy <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a hard time getting along...then we all take a break...maybe take a<br/>
&gt; &gt; nap...read a book...usually something relaxing...maybe watch some <br/>
&gt;tv...if<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are rowdy...then we leave the house...they probably have cabin<br/>
&gt;fever...I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have rules and expectations...they get fired if they blow off their <br/>
&gt;chores<br/>
&gt; &gt; and have to earn thier allowance back...etc etc...it works for <br/>
&gt;us...there<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; alot of respect between the three of us...I have no problems telling <br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt; &gt; what I need from them and they have no problems helping me out...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Question 4<br/>
&gt; &gt; We sought out 4H...and one of my best friends...Carrie...also <br/>
&gt;homeschools<br/>
&gt;her<br/>
&gt; &gt; three kids and was homeschooled...so she is a great support...I am <br/>
&gt;hoping<br/>
&gt; &gt; that as we travel the US...we will get to meet many different hs&#39;ers and<br/>
&gt; &gt; uns&#39;ers...and I am working on getting involved with church...that is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hardest cuz I am very eclectic in my spirituality...Christians only want<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; know about my experience with Jesus and pagans only want to know what<br/>
&gt; &gt; magickal tradition I follow...I feel that all paths have something<br/>
&gt;important<br/>
&gt; &gt; to teach and I don&#39;t want to be closed to any particular one...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t speak for anyone else...but my goals is to teach my kids that as <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; family...we are a team...and we are connected...I hope that they will <br/>
&gt;move<br/>
&gt; &gt; into adulthood with a sense that they have a responsibility to help our<br/>
&gt;world<br/>
&gt; &gt; change and grow...and mostly I want us to have fun and a zest for<br/>
&gt;life...it<br/>
&gt; &gt; seems that too many kids are unhappy with their lot...I hope that our<br/>
&gt;family<br/>
&gt; &gt; structure keeps unhappiness at bay...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll say it again - thank you, Candice, for interpreting the &quot;we&quot; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; what it is.  And no, there isn&#39;t another person on the message board<br/>
&gt; &gt; who knows me or my family personally (or least that I know of).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am a self-titled &quot;pro-lifer&quot; and there is no denial about what some<br/>
&gt; &gt; people in this group do.  Just as I would believe that a &quot;pro-<br/>
&gt; &gt; choicer&quot; doesn&#39;t want to be considered a baby-killer just because<br/>
&gt; &gt; they believe in choice or what others are paid to do under the<br/>
&gt; &gt; title &quot;abortion&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, no, I do not blow up abortion clinics or kill abortionists.  I do<br/>
&gt; &gt; not condone that behavior (my logic & heart says that would not be<br/>
&gt; &gt; respecting life very much, would it?).  I personally do not believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; that every black person who was part of the civil rights movement was<br/>
&gt; &gt; a militant activist or that I am either just because I believe in<br/>
&gt; &gt; civil rights.  Just as those who have committed unspeakable acts<br/>
&gt; &gt; against humanity in the name of their beliefs toward the government<br/>
&gt; &gt; are speaking or acting for me in anyway.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; movement that burns clinics and kills people?  Of course not, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard pressed to name one person in my parish of well over a<br/>
&gt; &gt; thousand families<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who would support that kind of violence.  In fact, I&#39;d be hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; pressed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; find a single person in my parish who would consider any other<br/>
&gt; &gt; person of any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; religion &quot;evil.&quot;  In fact, our priests regularly use protestant<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christians<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and members of other faiths as examples of holy life.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; While I certainly know from personal experience that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; some people of faith aren&#39;t tolerant, I am quite reluctant to group<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; together.   If anyone wants a generalization of Catholicism that<br/>
&gt; &gt; works<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for me, it is that we believe that Christ came to redeem the world--<br/>
&gt; &gt; and at some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; point everyone will be redeemed.  Do I understand how that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; work?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course not, and I really don&#39;t want to know.  But do I believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; that if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with<br/>
&gt; &gt; every single<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?  I think not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just that--radically unbalanced.  Probably whatever group gave them<br/>
&gt; &gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; allegiance.  I love life, and that will cause me to get involved<br/>
&gt; &gt; and help<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone I can to live a full life--old person, sick person, lonely<br/>
&gt; &gt; person,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; condemned person, unborn person.  Yet, I could never take it upon<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; judge and condemn another&#39;s actions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But please, don&#39;t take the old shibboleths and give<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them new life.  I don&#39;t hate anyone, am not a &quot;fundamentalist&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &gt; unless you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean I fundamentally believe God loves us all and we should strive<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; same.....Susan---wife of one, mother of three, caretaker of<br/>
&gt; &gt; multiple four legged<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: messy vs. disorganized<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My house is a mess most of the time, which I wouldn&#39;t really care about,<br/>
&gt; &gt; except it seems we lose stuff in the mess, and then other stuff becomes<br/>
&gt; &gt; useless.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For instance, we have lost chess pieces, some playing cards, Mancala<br/>
&gt;pieces,<br/>
&gt; &gt; parts of Transformers, crucial cards in a board game, dice, etc. Games<br/>
&gt;seem<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be particular victims of this syndrome. All you have to lose is one <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt; &gt; two things out of a game and it becomes a lot less fun, if not <br/>
&gt;impossible,<br/>
&gt; &gt; to play. The pieces get scattered around then the games are no good. <br/>
&gt;This<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; the downside of a messy house as far as I&#39;m concerned. (We also lose<br/>
&gt;bigger<br/>
&gt; &gt; things like books, reading glasses, remote controls and toys, but at <br/>
&gt;least<br/>
&gt; &gt; they seem to show up eventually.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps other people are better than I am at getting their kids to put<br/>
&gt;away<br/>
&gt; &gt; their games when they decide to do something else (&quot;when they are <br/>
&gt;finished<br/>
&gt; &gt; with them&quot; would be misleading, since they&#39;re always quitting halfway<br/>
&gt; &gt; through and running off without a glance backward). You would think that<br/>
&gt; &gt; after having puzzles, games, models and other items with small pieces<br/>
&gt; &gt; rendered unusable because parts had been lost, that they&#39;d be more<br/>
&gt; &gt; conscientious, but nooooo. They don&#39;t waste much time regretting that<br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt; &gt; games and puzzles are ruined, but I&#39;m sorry about it because I think <br/>
&gt;those<br/>
&gt; &gt; things offer valuable learning experiences (plus they cost money, after<br/>
&gt; &gt; all).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My boys are 8 and 4.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; By the way, I have been on this list for a long time, and reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything, but lurking a lot lately.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I was also serious when I expressed amusement that in the very same<br/>

&gt; &gt;  birth control clinics are condemned but dog breeding is condemned too.<br/>
&gt;NO<br/>
&gt; &gt;  more dogs; LOTS more people.  But it wasn&#39;t logic, it was religion, and <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;  forgot that for a second. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not totally correct either.  Not all pro-life views include a ban on <br/>
&gt;birth<br/>
&gt; &gt; control.  The belief is that the unborn is already fully human and thus <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not a promotion of more humans but the same right to life as those <br/>
&gt;already<br/>
&gt; &gt; born.  Many people who embrace a pro-life view are in favor of and<br/>
&gt;practice<br/>
&gt; &gt; birth control, usually those methods which prevent fertilization rather<br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt; &gt; implantation.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if my husband and I want to have several children, it&#39;s supposed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be o.k. for everyone to share with us their opinions regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sterilization, birth control and abortion, yet we are not supposed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; share our belief in procreation?  Again, I do not understand how that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mommy to Jason (8), Angela (6-1/2), Daniel (3-1/2) and baby due in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; March!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Chris,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Personally I just think some people are thoughtless, and therefore often<br/>
&gt; &gt; offend others, whether they intend to or not.  I don&#39;t think the people<br/>
&gt;who<br/>
&gt; &gt; question your family size are really coming from a pro-choice stance, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think they&#39;re just obnoxious people who probably think everyone should <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; just like them.  I face the same criticism, but in reverse, we have one<br/>
&gt; &gt; child, and we have no plans for more.  I am always amazed by the nerve <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who tell us how unfair we are, how selfish we are not to provide<br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt; &gt; son with his own little sibling playmate.  I refuse to explain to any of<br/>
&gt; &gt; them why we have an only child, there is no way to win this <br/>
&gt;conversation,<br/>
&gt; &gt; just as there is no way to win an argument on abortion.  These are <br/>
&gt;issues<br/>
&gt; &gt; that people have already made up their minds on, and too often there is <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt; &gt; tolerance nor understanding of  anyone who may have a different opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; (usually due to having a different life experience).  So congratulations<br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the new baby, and  I wish you & your family continued joy & happiness.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cindy L.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW-  I am non-religious, with deeply held spiritual beliefs.  I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; adamantly pro-choice.  I use natural family planning.  My pregnancy was<br/>
&gt; &gt; unplanned, and seemingly inconvenient- I took it as a profound gift, and <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; never once considered any other option than giving birth, I never had an<br/>
&gt; &gt; ultrasound even though I was in my late 30&#39;s at the time- I have never <br/>
&gt;had<br/>
&gt; &gt; such a sense of &#39;faith&#39; as I did with my pregnancy.  I go by my <br/>
&gt;intuition.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I understand that other people are guided (or not) by their own <br/>
&gt;intuition,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or beliefs.  I try my best not to judge the choices that other people<br/>
&gt; &gt; make...... Just to explain where I&#39;m coming from.  (I also understand <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; many people think I&#39;m just flaky, that&#39;s ok, too.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Something I have wondered for years.............what is the &quot;official&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; pro-life view on how to proceed when a tubal pregnancy is discovered?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And I will go ahead and expose myself here......once I had borne a child <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;do<br/>
&gt; &gt; not know that I would be capable of choosing abortion for myself even<br/>
&gt;under<br/>
&gt; &gt; extreme circumstances  (but who can say for sure how one would proceed<br/>
&gt;when<br/>
&gt; &gt; faced with reality instead of  &quot;if it were  me&quot;).    I am adamantly<br/>
&gt; &gt; pro-choice----whether it be choice concerning elective sterilization<br/>
&gt;(instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; coerced after 1 healthy child for some races and incomes and denied for<br/>
&gt;others<br/>
&gt; &gt; who seek it);  choice of practicing reasonably safe means of family<br/>
&gt;planning;<br/>
&gt; &gt; choice of attending a particular church or no church; choice to conceive <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;child<br/>
&gt; &gt; even if life partner is infertile;  choice of means of education for <br/>
&gt;self<br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt; &gt; family;  and  yes, personal choice concerning whether to carry a<br/>
&gt;particular<br/>
&gt; &gt; pregnancy into viability.       I believe I can only claim to support<br/>
&gt;choice if<br/>
&gt; &gt; I acknowledge that  my choice might well differ from someone else&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think I started an email monster and I sure did not mean too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; On the unschooling front.... it is cold here, icy and cold. My boys have<br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt; &gt; busy  reading about a certain subject and when they need a break they <br/>
&gt;then<br/>
&gt; &gt; draw the subjects. (I would rather not say what it is as I may start<br/>
&gt;another<br/>
&gt; &gt; argument! ) It is neat how when an interest is fired kids will really go<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt; &gt; it. The girls have been playing their horns (sax and clarinet) and <br/>
&gt;working<br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt; &gt; their various interests. One is learning Japanese ( karate triggered) <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other has been working with the microscope. (science geek) Funny how <br/>
&gt;being<br/>
&gt; &gt; housebound changes things. Last week, when we were enjoying warm <br/>
&gt;weather,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they were outside working on projects there. (My oldest is determined on<br/>
&gt; &gt; raising the finest blackberries on earth and she has been working and<br/>
&gt; &gt; studying on that. The other three have been working with the you know<br/>
&gt;whats.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;  It was a nice break this evening to get out of the house and take the<br/>
&gt;girls<br/>
&gt; &gt; to karate. It is a 35 mile drive and it was snowing pretty hard, yet we<br/>
&gt; &gt; plowed through mud to get to the highway. Weirdest weather. The boys<br/>
&gt;prowled<br/>
&gt; &gt; through the adult section at the library, they love non-fiction, while <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; girls were in class. Now we are home again and I see my email I wonder<br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt; &gt; has happened. And it is all because my kids bought puppies.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I hope everyone had a fun day too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh and I forgot, we also played several rousting games of eye-popping<br/>
&gt;bubbu.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wish we had a big house like Sandra though, then it would have been <br/>
&gt;much<br/>
&gt; &gt; more fun!<br/>
&gt; &gt; :)<br/>

We also live for hockey all year long. My dh and 2<br/>

addicted to it so much that I have had to search out<br/>
hockey everything, including math lessons!(which<br/>
really arent lessons, but cool hockey/math facts.<br/>

So sorry to hear about your ill health. This has probably been answered in<br/>
one of the many posts I have yet to read, but what is FMS? Have you or your<br/>
son tried elimination diets? This is probably something you&#39;ve already done<br/>
- I&#39;m relatively new to the list so don&#39;t know much about your past - but<br/>
it&#39;s the first thought that popped to mind.<br/>

Hi Janet,<br/>
<br/>
 I work from home on my computer, with my dd, and just move from one thing to <br/>
another as needed. We have no set hours for anything.  Is this an option for <br/>
you?  Or maybe one of those cooperative work places that you can bring your <br/>
kids to?<br/>
<br/>
And I must share with everyone that my dd is currently taping toilet paper to <br/>
her fingers with masking tape and making little finger puppets!  It started <br/>
off that she was playing Dr. with me while I&#39;m typing, and her pretend <br/>
bandage for me was tp- well she drew a face on it, and decided it was really <br/>
cool!  Too cute.  She has quite the imagination!  But don&#39;t they all?!  <br/>

work at night.  I work at Barnes & Noble because they are open until 11 pm.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Anyway, I would like to raise my daughters to be physically active.  How<br/>
&gt;can I break this pattern?  I like to walk and hike, so as far as<br/>
&gt;modeling, that is about my limit!  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids are naturally physically active, all we have to do is provide the<br/>
opportunities. Have you thought about cycling? Or rollerskates/blades?<br/>
Scooters? These are things that are good activities families can enjoy<br/>
together. They can also be great alternatives to energy-consumptive<br/>
transportation. I&#39;m not a huge fan of organized sports, especially for<br/>
young kids. We try to provide an active lifestyle in our family instead,<br/>
and engage in activities that are fun and physically challenging.<br/>
Both my DH and I do amateur athletics (DH ran a marathon a couple years<br/>
back, I do triathlons and Master&#39;s swimming, we both skydive) I think it&#39;s<br/>
great for kids to see their parents engaging in active pursuits, whether<br/>
competitively or non-competitively. My son and I had a great discussion one<br/>
day on the theme of &quot;Why do you do races mom if you&#39;re not going to win?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Physically active things we do:<br/>
<br/>
Bicycling: We do every day as our transportation. I&#39;m about to bump my son<br/>
out of the trailer and onto a kid&#39;s tandem attachment to my bicycle. He&#39;s<br/>
excited about becoming &quot;the stoker&quot;. We also take the kids small bikes down<br/>
to the bike path or have them ride around the garage/driveway<br/>
Rollerskating: Our local rink has a homeschool hour once a week - you might<br/>
call your rink and ask if they have something similar, or try to start one.<br/>
In the summer, rollerblading on bike paths or sidewalks can be fun<br/>
Swimming: Many pools now have waterslides or wavepools that can be really<br/>
fun for all ages<br/>
Playing at the park/playground, especially with other kids where they make<br/>
up games and run around<br/>
Outdoor games like hopskotch, games with big rubber balls, basketball,<br/>
croquet<br/>
Walking - as exercise or transportation. If we have an errand that&#39;s 1/2<br/>
mile or less, we usually try to walk<br/>
Hiking on local trails<br/>
Innertubing/sledding on snow in the winter<br/>
Skiing/snowboarding/cross-country skiing<br/>
Go to the river/lake/pond and build a dam out of rocks or just<br/>
skip/collect/throw rocks<br/>
Backpacking - even if you only hike in a mile or so, it&#39;s great fun for kids<br/>
to camp in the outdoors!<br/>
Gardening - this can be great exercise, especially the big stuff like<br/>
weeding, raking leaves, hoeing, shoveling<br/>
Horseback riding<br/>
Dancing/folk dancing<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas!!<br/>

Hi, Eye popping Bubba is the cutest thing. Do you know what a Bubba bear is? <br/>
(Very witty southern talking teddy bear. My youngest loves them) In this form <br/>
Bubba is like a hot potato. You throw him back and forth while he talks away. <br/>
Finally he &quot;goes off&quot; and his eyes pop out, sometimes he yells LOSER. Sounds <br/>
crazy in print but it really is cute. Hard to believe that I can get 3 teens <br/>
and their younger brother to play but I can. ;)   I really love all the Bubba <br/>
Bears. (Did you see the Bubba for President)<br/>
