they could drive, I would ask if I could go too.  If they said no, I <br/>
would commence to praying and ask everyone I know ( who would be <br/>
willing to pray) to offer their prayers too.  I would talk and talk <br/>
and talk to the kid to find out WHY they want to go.  I would try to <br/>
make completely sure they know what REALLY goes on there and caution <br/>
and warn them.  I would say, I love you very much, and it breaks my <br/>
heart to see this kind of hate in you.  What can I do to make you <br/>
feel differently? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697840524">Just to clarify...before this veers *too* far off track.<br/>
<br/>
Our issue has nothing to do with a skin head rally :o).<br/>
It has more to do with peer pressure that goes beyond what I&#39;m comfortable with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143945131">&lt;&gt;I can honestly say.. I don&#39;t know what I would do if my child <br/>
wanted to go to one of these [skinhead rally].&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I give, what&#39;s a skinhead rally?  I really don&#39;t have any idea <br/>
what would be going at one of these.  When I think skinheads I think <br/>
kind of media generalization protraying all skinheads as racists or <br/>
white supremicists, but I could be wrong.  Is it something to do with <br/>
white supremacy?  Or what?  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I would have a hard time being too restrictive about most <br/>
things when I think back to all the stuff my generation did:  <br/>
Woodstock, Philly Folk Festival, Mariposa Folk Festival, Duck Creek, <br/>
and lots more.  But then we were &quot;flower children,&quot; not &quot;skinheads.&quot;  <br/>
Is there a significant differance?  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of things going on at all those concerts, to be sure.  Drugs, <br/>
alcohol, sex.  Not that I ever indulged in any of those.....ahem.  <br/>
But they were going on.  I survived.  So did all seven of my younger <br/>
siblings who all indulged in varying degrees of 60s into 70s stuff.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know what I would have done if my parents had found out and <br/>
forbade me from going, either.  But I left for college at 16 and was <br/>
basically on my own when the age of flower children hit the world.  <br/>
Mom and Dad did not necessarily know what I was doing.  Well, except <br/>
when I got arrested for some other 60s activities (war protests and <br/>
anti-segregation protests, mostly).  But they left me to swim on my <br/>
own through all that.  And I made it, much the wiser, to be sure.   <br/>
<br/>
So tell me what happens at &quot;skinhead rallies.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380259251">This isn&#39;t about unschooling.<br/>
I wish we weren&#39;t even talking about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But then we were &quot;flower children,&quot; not &quot;skinheads.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Is there a significant differance?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So tell me what happens at &quot;skinhead rallies.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;m the one who threw the term out (second time in a week I&#39;ve used a <br/>
phrase in passing and it&#39;s turned inexplicably into a Big Deal), I was <br/>
intending it as a racist rally in general generic terms.   I doubt there&#39;s a <br/>
website announcing where the tour of skinhead rallies is this week. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What happens when any political hate-group gets together?  Somebody makes a <br/>
speech about how the others are ruining the glorious fantasy potential of the <br/>
&quot;right&quot; group&#39;s life, how it&#39;s &quot;their&quot; fault &quot;we&quot; don&#39;t have nicer cars and <br/>
better jobs, and then they all drink beer and fantasize about killing all <br/>
&quot;them&quot; so that life will be all happy.<br/>

I found sites talking about similar groups in Germany and Australia.  Bummer. <br/>
 I hoped it was only stupid Americans.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Years ago Russell Crowe was in a movie called Romper Stomper. It&#39;s an<br/>
Australian movie about a gang of skinheads, very violent and very bleak but<br/>
worth watching just to have your eyes opened to what is happening out there.<br/>
Not to mention Crowe&#39;s performance is brilliant. Chillingly believable.<br/>
