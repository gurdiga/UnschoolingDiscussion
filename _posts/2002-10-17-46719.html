<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915944547">&lt;,The conclusion was that (and this is summarised somewhat) the <br/>
body views drugs as a dangerous substance and produces <br/>
chemicals in the liver to detox as quickly as possible. Having the <br/>
same procedure is a bit like Pavlov&#39;s dogs so the body produces <br/>
chemicals in anticipation of the drug. As the week goes on it <br/>
becomes more efffcienct so more drug is needed to get the same <br/>
effects. Group C did not develop a Pavlov response as they never <br/>
knew when the drug would be adminsitered.<br/>
It was the procedure that led to the habituation, like a classical <br/>
conditioning response, not the drug itself.<br/>
Cancer patients (and drug users) tended to go through the same <br/>
procedure daily. ie. Nurse would wheel in cart at 10am, injections <br/>
prepared and then adminsitered.<br/>
After that study many hospitals varied their drug routine and found <br/>
less habituation and addiction to the mophine.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is so cool.  A friend of mine said she talked to a woman who used to<br/>
take tylenol everyday for a headache, she decided that the headache was<br/>
in response to the daily routine of taking the tylenol and stopped. <br/>
Evidently the headaches stopped within a few days.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the body can create symptoms in response to the medication<br/>
as well?  Or is this just a case of mind over matter?<br/>
