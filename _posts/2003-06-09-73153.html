<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When we lived in Morocco, I did make our own bread. They mix <br/>
&gt; the ingredients &quot;backwards.&quot; They start with the dry and use cake <br/>
&gt; yeast. They don&#39;t measure anything. It&#39;s all by &quot;touch.&quot; You slowly <br/>
&gt; add warm water from a tea kettle as you knead the dough. I loved <br/>
&gt; the squish, squish of the flour as the water would soak into the <br/>
&gt; flour. It was like playing! Once the proper texture was achieved <br/>
&gt; (only known by experience), it was shaped into circular loaves <br/>
&gt; and left to rest on a bread board with a tea towel over it. The <br/>
&gt; hands-on experience was everything in bread making.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would then carry this board to the local ferhran (public oven) <br/>
&gt; and there it would be baked in a wood burning oven with dozens <br/>
&gt; of other loaves. You could smell the bread baking down the <br/>
&gt; street.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later in the morning, I&#39;d return to pick up the two loaves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Such memories. I&#39;ll bet if you could walk in the sweet sunshine <br/>
&gt; of Morocco to a public oven, you&#39;d enjoy bread making more. I <br/>
&gt; know I did.<br/>
