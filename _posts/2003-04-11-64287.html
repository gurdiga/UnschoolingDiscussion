 I am sick and tired of defending myself. It is either that you truly do not <br/>
understand - in which case it is a shame, or you just don&#39;t WANT to <br/>
understand in which case it is a shame. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone understands perfectly well Yoki.<br/>
I used to spank also.<br/>
My swats were not just a light tap to the hand, I regretted it every time I <br/>
did it. It&#39;s STILL something I battle...it&#39;s my foul temper and the way I was <br/>
raised rearing it&#39;s ugly head every so often. Very hard to undo.<br/>
BUT, at this list, you aren&#39;t going to find support for disrespect of <br/>
children on ANY level.<br/>
Just the way we speak can be disrespectful.<br/>
A light swat on the hands, while not nearly the type of physical harm that <br/>
we&#39;ve talked about, is totally disrespectful to the child.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make anyone a lousy parent.<br/>
I would bet you are a better parent than I am in MANY ways.<br/>
I have a hot temper.....it&#39;s tough to deal with myself some days.<br/>
But there can be no defense of anything disrespecting children....that would <br/>
be hypocritical.<br/>
It&#39;s not a pissing contest to one up each other.<br/>
We&#39;re all better or worse at different things and one thing I know quite <br/>
confidently, that every mother here (or father) is DEEPLY interested in their <br/>
childrens well being and a loving parent.<br/>
Closing your mind off to learning new ideas is dangerous. Disagree all you <br/>
want, but the families here have found ways to live happily with children <br/>
without hitting them. Aren&#39;t you even curious about that?<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
