<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now, Jme wants to try middle school again, in March,<br/>
&gt; after she goes down to visits friends in February, flying back and forth<br/>
&gt; unaccompanied! Help! There has been so much change this year-we moved 1000<br/>
&gt; miles in April, she&#39;s in dance, 4h, the yearbook committee, 2 youth in<br/>
&gt; philanthropy projects, and she baby-sits and works for an elderly neighbor.<br/>
&gt; I think she has a cool life with out adding #@$%&*! school to it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t spare 5 days?  Her track record on school isn&#39;t so great, maybe<br/>
she&#39;ll be back sooner this time!<br/>
<br/>
Really, though, I don&#39;t know about school.  Mine has decided that when he<br/>
turns 8 he&#39;s going to boarding school in London.  He wants to go to St.<br/>
Paul&#39;s boy choir school.  He has the voice for it, too; I can&#39;t lie to the<br/>
child.  But I&#39;m torn between telling him over my dead body, and attempting<br/>
to be supportive.  <br/>
