there are Christians that would not even consider us Christians.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that evolution and creation are mutually exclusive, I do not <br/>
believe in the virgin birth, do not believe in original sin, and there are <br/>
other things.  I believe the Bible was written by man and take that into <br/>
consideration when reading it.  Etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sort of get what I am getting at.  That is how unschooling can work here.  <br/>

with Christian family members and friends who are trying to <br/>
understand unschooling.  When Christians ask me about original sin <br/>
and how can we &quot;deal&quot; with this is children, I tell them that I saw <br/>
Desmond Tutu speak, and he reminded the audience that though we are <br/>
capable of sin, what we often forget is that we are made in the image <br/>
of God, and we are also capable of great good, amazing good.  I tell <br/>
them that bringing out that good, in all its different forms, may be <br/>
possible only from creating an environment of free choices and <br/>
respect.<br/>
<br/>
This is more a beginning to a conversation than an end, but it can <br/>
help put the discussion on the right foot.<br/>

unschooling in light of original sin is to remind them that sin <br/>

Kelly<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will admit to a fairly &quot;strict&quot; interpretation of the Bible as it pertains <br/>
to my faith.  I interpret it clearly to say that it is by FAITH not works that <br/>
one is saved.  I can do NOTHING to make my children be &quot;saved&quot;.  I also read <br/>
that my God is a loving God and wants the best for his &quot;children&quot;.  I want the <br/>
best for my children.  I read that my God gives us freewill to choose.  I <br/>
give my children freewill to choose.<br/>
<br/>
I do read the part in Revelations about the last days and the coming of <br/>
Christ, and I do believe it.  I also believe in a literal heaven and hell.  I also <br/>
have faith that my children will find their way to a loving God on many paths, <br/>
or maybe in the solitude of their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
I know it is not my &quot;job&quot; to give my children eternal salvation, that is only <br/>
through their own personal experience and their own relationship with God <br/>
that it can be found.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very parallel walk with unschooling in my mind.  I model behaviours <br/>
for my children, that is what they see/hear/know.  They have freewill to make <br/>
their own choice about EVERYTHING in life.  Does it mean I will be THRILLED with <br/>
every decision they make?  Not at all, but it also do not mean I will cast <br/>
them out of my life for things I personally do not believe or agree with.<br/>
<br/>
Really aren&#39;t both things we are discussing, religion and unschooling about <br/>
FAITH?  Faith that our children will learn what they need to learn, when they <br/>
need to learn it.  Faith that our children will find the path to journey <br/>
through life that is right for THEM.<br/>
<br/>
I see it as very similar, not at all opposites, one seems to naturally <br/>
compliment the other, in my life anyway.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of what is &quot;thought&quot; to be in the name of one religion or another is <br/>
just someone&#39;s fanatical skewed views of something. <br/>
<br/>
Take these terrorist acts in the name of a jihad. True believers and <br/>
worshippers of Muslim will say they are against violence and these acts are wrong.  <br/>
Yet they are very visible and very public so it gives the impression of that <br/>
religion being like we see it on our T.V&#39;s which isn&#39;t necessarily a true <br/>
representation of the Muslim religion.<br/>

I acknowledge *their belief* in the capacity for sin and the <br/>

these things myself.<br/>

I&#39;m not trying to be challenging, I&#39;m honestly asking about something I<br/>
don&#39;t understand.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My very own personal experience with &quot;original sin&quot; is just that none among <br/>
us are perfect.  No one is without the capacity to sin in this world.  No one <br/>
can get to the Father except through the Son and a personal relationship with <br/>
God.  No amount of works or &quot;being good&quot; will get you there.<br/>
<br/>
Also no amount of any sin will keep you out once you&#39;ve been saved, but other <br/>
religions reject that idea too of course.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it just like no amount of cajoling or forcing or any amount of sitting <br/>
in a classroom can guarantee real learning?   Everyone (almost) has the <br/>
capacity to learn, but it can&#39;t be forced and result in a joy filled life long <br/>
learning environment.   It needs to be on a person&#39;s own personal terms, just like <br/>
with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Is the real question, if you feel your child must be SAVED to go to Heaven is <br/>
true then how can you NOT be constantly concerned about their eternity at the <br/>
expense of allowing them the freedom of living and learning?  <br/>
<br/>
I believe that salvation is essential to seeing Heaven.  I also have faith <br/>
that my children will find this on their own, in their own way, not necessarily <br/>
MY way.  Just as I have faith they will learn what they need to learn in life, <br/>
when they need to or are ready to learn it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that is a response to what you were asking.<br/>
