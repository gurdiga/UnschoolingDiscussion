<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942561591">How many digital photos can you get on a CD?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have Nero Burning Rom and know how to transfer the pictures to the CD?  I can&#39;t seem to get mine to work, but I hardly ever use it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-294023125">It depends on the size of the digital photos (higher resolution takes<br/>
up more space), but in general, you should be able to fit close to 500<br/>
(the number my local camera store will put on 1 CD for $10).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833784983">I use Nero all the time, you can email me if you like.  The number of pics that will fit on a CD depends on the file size and resolution.  But you can fit quite a few, usually.  <br/>
<br/>
If you email me, put something in the subject line so I won&#39;t miss it.  <br/>
