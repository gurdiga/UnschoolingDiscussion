<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477643678">I have to agree, Bonnie.  The whole &quot;it takes a village&quot; thing has been<br/>
perverted and turned around.  It originally was used to mean the<br/>
old-fashioned town where everyone knew everyone, you had an extended family<br/>
close at hand and you didn&#39;t have to worry about your kids because even if<br/>
you weren&#39;t there right at the moment that they needed you, you knew<br/>
someone else would be.<br/>
<br/>
It is very much the traditional Native American way of looking at children<br/>
also.  And that sure isn&#39;t packing them off to brain-washing school each<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Politics, yuck, they ruin everything they touch or come near!<br/>

ourselves in front of the entire community.  Worked for kids and adults.<br/>
