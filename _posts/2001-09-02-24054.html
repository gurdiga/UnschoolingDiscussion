<div id="ygrps-yiv-731025767">May I calmly suggest that in many cases--at least where I live--shouting is <br/>
cultural/ethnic? My husband is half Italian, half Sicilian. Everything is always <br/>
loud--whether it is arguing or laughing and loving. They are passionate about <br/>
everything. And I find the same in the Puerto Ricans that live around here (and <br/>
there are many), though not so much in some of the other cultural groups, like <br/>
the Mexican and the Jewish. I grew up in a quiet household, of mixed European <br/>
descent, primarily, and that&#39;s just way things were. When I had my first <br/>
introduction to the Italian neighborhood in a business transaction, my boss and <br/>
his client, who are close friends, stood there shouting at each other, red in <br/>
the face, and ended with hugs and laughs. My husband can&#39;t understand how I stay <br/>
calm in an argument, and not raise my voice. It frustrates him. And I&#39;ve learned <br/>
that his yelling just the way of many of his people.<br/>
<br/>
I realize there certainly are plenty of people who don&#39;t fit this <br/>
description, but to blanketly assume that all people who shout are not in <br/>
control of themselves would be a gross generalization, and certainly not <br/>
true.<br/>

We are students of words; we are shut up in schools, and colleges, and <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
recitation rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a thing. <br/>
<br/>
--Ralph Waldo Emerson <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is in fact nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of <br/>
<br/>
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in <br/>
need <br/>
<br/>
of freedom; without this it goes to wrack and ruin without fail.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
--Albert Einstein <br/>

anger. Oh, we yell with the best of &#39;em to be heard over noise or<br/>
whatever, but anger...well, we get quiet, and EXTREMELY polite. My son<br/>
reflects this too. Yesterday I stepped on his Voltron toy, breaking part<br/>
of it and he looks at me, flushed, eyes snapping and in a tiny, quiet<br/>
little voice &quot;Mother, I would realy prefer you don&#39;t step on my toys and<br/>
break tem please. Do you think you could replace my green lion?&quot; He<br/>
sounded just LIKE me. So we went shopping for a new Voltron today and<br/>
had a lovely unschooling lesson in comparative pricing and monetary<br/>
values.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277651359">Oh, that brings back memories!  My nanny was from Georgia and her son use to<br/>
say she had the loudest silences in the world!  That was soooo true!!!  I<br/>
just thought it was her and now I&#39;ve learned it may be a southern thingy &lt;g&gt;<br/>
