<div id="ygrps-yiv-798750076">I apologize if my correction of the spelling for<br/>
&quot;grammar&quot; offended anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
I have thought about this question of what&#39;s important<br/>
to teach.  Personally, I feel the only important thing<br/>
to teach is that love is the law of life, that things<br/>
go better for the individual and everyone around<br/>
him/her if love is practiced on a practical level as<br/>
helpfulness and forgiveness, that gratitude brings<br/>
inner peace, and that patience is built from<br/>
forgiveness and persistence.  <br/>
<br/>
That said, I find that being in the world seems to<br/>
require some concession or adaptation to physical<br/>
survival and cultural systems.  Even if your choice is<br/>
mostly avoidance, that still is adaptation and<br/>
concession to the existence of matter and culture. <br/>
One of the concessions I make to our culture is<br/>
imparting knowledge to my children, and some of the<br/>
educational choices I make are based solely on my<br/>
desire to help them feel they can converse<br/>
intelligently with all kinds of people.  That would<br/>
include knowing what to call a noun and a verb, and<br/>
being able to obtain a GED. My younger daughter, who<br/>
has tended to be very good at math but totally<br/>
disinterested, feels at times that she is ignorant in<br/>
comparison to some others around her age, and those<br/>
are the times I put together new math workbooks or<br/>
find new math websites so she has the opportunity to<br/>
keep up with her age group as painlessly as possible. <br/>
Just recently I presented her with &quot;All the Math<br/>
You&#39;ll Ever Need&quot;, a self-guided text which presents<br/>
math in all its practical applications.  I also <br/>
spiral-bound a &quot;workbook&quot; of blank pages, with the<br/>
title of the math book and her name on the front, so<br/>
she can work on it at her own pace and have a tidy<br/>
journal for her practice problems.  She rolled her<br/>
eyes and curled her lip, but she&#39;s using it and<br/>
letting me know when she wants help. I did point out a<br/>
couple of hightlights, like pi, which she had seen<br/>
reference to in another book, and how to use algebra<br/>
because &quot;x&quot; as an unknown came up in a movie we<br/>
watched.   <br/>
