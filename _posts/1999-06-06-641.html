 </span></blockquote>I also happen to think that it is not the be-all end-all goal of parenting<br/>
to eject your children from the household as soon as they turn into<br/>
&quot;responsible adults.&quot;  What ever happened to multi-generational households<br/>
and all the benefits that come with them?  Of course, this works best if<br/>
you have more than one house on a single property, and in that way can get<br/>
your space when you need it.  Then when you talk about the &quot;village&quot;<br/>
raising the child, it is the child&#39;s extended family you are talking about,<br/>
which is how it is supposed to be anyway, right?<br/>
