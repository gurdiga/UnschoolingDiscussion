<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588296056">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
My son has learned to write letters on plain unlined paper and has<br/>
better structured letters than the children who have learned on the<br/>
special line paper.  He developed his own spacial awareness of how<br/>
letters work.  Sometimes he will make each letter progressively larger<br/>
because it&#39;s suppose to be said more loudly.<br/>
