where a guy sets out to try all the Harry Pottter spells that <br/>
Christians reckon kids could *do* from the books. The pictures are <br/>
hilarious and, rather obviously, however much you shout bad latin and <br/>
wave a stick, nothing happens.<br/>
Nice if it did sometimes, I&#39;d have the dishes doing themselves ;-)<br/>

Darn, I was gonna try to learn that &quot;Accio ________&quot; spell for when I lose<br/>
my keys.<br/>
I don&#39;t have a proper wand.  Do you think a lemon tree branch would do?<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I do remember my friend and I staring intently at objects after<br/>
reading about someone who claimed to be telekinetic.  We were sure it would<br/>
work if we tried hard enough.  I also remember trying to walk on the surface<br/>
of the swimming pool like Jesus and Peter but this was more fantasy play<br/>
than actual religious thinking.  Must have been about 10years old at the<br/>
time.   Later we saw how they did it in the movies (clear plastic platform<br/>
just under the surface of the water.  Cool.)  It&#39;s funny, that, even though<br/>
I learned telekinesis is a sham, and actors in movies can&#39;t really walk on<br/>
water, my faith in Jesus (or Peter for that matter) didn&#39;t suffer as a<br/>
result.  I think kids are able to learn and process things in lots of<br/>
different ways.  When we try to put everything into &quot;real&quot; and &quot;not real&quot; we<br/>
spoil some of the fun and sometimes rob them of the *real* magic that is<br/>
found in myths, allegories and fictional stories.  By this I mean<br/>
understanding and enjoyment that can only come your way when you are willing<br/>
to suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours.<br/>
