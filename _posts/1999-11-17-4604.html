<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156739819">I&#39;ve recently started reading some fiction again after years of only<br/>
non-fiction.  I attend a monthly book club where we discuss the book in<br/>
the context of our lives and personal views.  It is very enjoyable.  Here<br/>

I prefer books because you can crawl into bed with them.  Plus,  reading<br/>
off<br/>
the screen is uncomfortable to me for more than a short period.  I can<br/>
read<br/>
a book for hours.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK, OK, I admit it!!  (raising hands in surrender)  Although I spend a<br/>
great deal of time and energy gleaning from the internet lately, I too<br/>
enjoy crawling into bed with a good book and reading into the night.  I<br/>
have always been a fiction person, but have not had much time for that<br/>
escape lately with all the other things I am involved with and trying to<br/>
learn about.  Lately all the books I am reading are non-fiction (or toddler<br/>
books for my kids! ;-)) and I do not find them as warm companions in bed at<br/>
night.  My adoption homestudy requires that I read books about special<br/>
needs adoption, child bonding and other issues, which can be very dry and<br/>
clinical.  I am also reading some books about homeschooling and religious<br/>
and spiritual books, so none of these spin the yarns that really while away<br/>
the hours.  They can be exhausting to plod through.<br/>
