<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876723044">Sorry about that last post!<br/>
<br/>
My MIL has always known that I planned to hs my children. When I didn&#39;t send <br/>
them to preschool she was upset, but blew it off with comments like &quot;Well in <br/>
a few years you will see! You will get tired of doing nothing all day and <br/>
having them underfoot all the time...&quot; When Moly turned 5 and didn&#39;t go she <br/>
said I would learn... When Moly turned 7 and it was time to &quot;legally&quot; declare <br/>
our intent she almost died. Last fall when Jack went off to kindergarten I <br/>
thought she was going to throw a party! When I explained that this was just <br/>
for this year and things would go back to normal after this, she said what I <br/>
do to the kids certainly isn&#39;t normal and I would change my mind by this time <br/>
and next fall both kids would be in school where they belong. I have learned <br/>
in the ten years I have been with my husband to tune her out and not let her <br/>
very personal remarks get to me. But the other day she called with a <br/>
suggestion and it *almost* sounded good to me. I know her ulterior motives <br/>
are that she thinks the kids need all the help they can get since their Mom <br/>
is utterly wacky! She told me she was going to send a box (that the kids can <br/>
decorate! &lt;her words&gt;) filled with note cards. On the cards she is going to <br/>
write little phrases and words and the kids can take one out, write about it <br/>
and send it to her. <br/>
Now I don&#39;t think this is unschooling, and doubt it will go over too well <br/>
with either of the kids, although Jack (who enjoys writing) might turn it <br/>
into some kind of game. If one of them were to come to me and say &quot;I want you <br/>
to give me some suggestions of things to write about.&quot; I might sit down and <br/>
help them brainstorm, but wouldn&#39;t write out a bunch of cards. Am I wrong <br/>
here? <br/>
I am thinking that now maybe the time for me to really explain what we do. It <br/>
is getting hard for all of us to deal with her questions and comments. I <br/>
think she thinks we use some sort of curriculum, she questions the kids on <br/>
individual subjects, and asks me all sorts of questions about their &quot;school <br/>
books&quot; and where do we get them. The problem with this isn&#39;t how I deal with <br/>
her, I am just vague, the kids OTOH haven&#39;t learned that art yet. Do I call <br/>
her up and say &quot;Hey, thanks for the writing box suggestion, but we don&#39;t <br/>
believe in forced learning. BTW, the kids don&#39;t use a curriculum, we do <br/>
what&#39;s called unschooling or child-led learning, we let them pick and choose <br/>
freely from all the world and this just doesn&#39;t fit our ideal. How about I <br/>
give you a book on unschooling?&quot; (wouldn&#39;t she just flip then?)  I just don&#39;t <br/>
know how to broach this subject with this woman! I would write a letter to a <br/>
school principal and let it all out, but don&#39;t know which way to turn when it <br/>
comes to my MIL! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy to lay it out straight for someone you don&#39;t need to deal with<br/>
face to face ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now I don&#39;t think this is unschooling<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you require it, it isn&#39;t unschooling. But if you show them to the kids<br/>
and tell them what you MIL said and they can do it or not as the mood<br/>
strikes them, then it can be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps think of it as a birthday present that (supposedly!) has no strings<br/>
attached and shove it in the back of the closet as you would with any other<br/>
gift that doesn&#39;t get used.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am thinking that now maybe the time for me to really explain what we do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what I would do is say that you understand she doesn&#39;t agree with<br/>
homeschooling the kids and you&#39;d be glad to discuss it if she&#39;d like to read<br/>
some books since you&#39;ve done a great deal of research on the subject. And<br/>
give her a stack of books and articles and stuff printed off the internet.<br/>
<br/>
(There are some articles at http://www.home-ed-magazine.com,<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com, http://www.sandradodd.com to get you started.<br/>
The first 2 also have book suggestions. (Make sure you have some John Holt<br/>
and The Unschooling Handbook. If Frank Smith&#39;s The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting isn&#39;t on the lists, throw that in too.) You might be able to find<br/>
some of them used on http://www.half.com You might also try the place I just<br/>
suggested for used books http://www.addall.com that searches a lot of used<br/>
book lists and makes a nice comparison chart.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she questions the kids on<br/>
&gt; individual subjects<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some have suggested helping the kids come up with counter questions (and<br/>
answers!) For each question she asks them, have them ask one of her. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You could also talk to her and suggest that if she went to a friend&#39;s house<br/>
she probably wouldn&#39;t appreciate it if the friend gave her pop quizes. And<br/>
what does she think it would do to their friendship. You can say you<br/>
understand she&#39;s asking because she&#39;s concerned about their education but<br/>
that her concern is making her grandkids not want to be around her or<br/>
uncomfortable around her (or whatever the truth is.) Tell her since they are<br/>
your kids that you&#39;re even more concerned than she is and then do the above<br/>
suggestion with the books.<br/>

   About your MIL,  isn&#39;t it funny how we --I do this ,too--   don&#39;t<br/>
really want to step on others toes but she has no problem butting into<br/>
YOUR lifestyle.  I think Joyce has a great way to go about this when she<br/>
suggested your MIL read some books on unschooling.  Or maybe she should<br/>
just take up some extensive hobby!&lt;G&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606833461">I would let her send the box and not argue with her.  The kids might have fun <br/>
with it and likely make up some game.  Maybe if you pull one out and read it, <br/>
the game could just be to see how many days or hours before there&#39;s some <br/>
reference to it in the real world and maybe you as mom could note those on <br/>
the card and put them back in the box.  That could be proof for you AND your <br/>
mom someday that whatever she can devise also exists in the real world!<br/>
