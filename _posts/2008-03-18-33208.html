<div id="ygrps-yiv-552112737">Here&#39;s an article that someone posted on a local list.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea that kids ARE writing, it&#39;s just that some don&#39;t<br/>
recognize it or appreciate the value of it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s that part of the article:<br/>
<br/>
Kids today -- we&#39;re telling you! -- don&#39;t read, don&#39;t write, don&#39;t care<br/>
about anything farther in front of them than their iPods. The Internet,<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dir.salon.com/topics/internet/">http://dir.salon.com/topics/internet/</a>&gt;  according to 88-year-old<br/>
Lessing (whose specialty is sturdy typewriters, or perhaps pens), has<br/>
&quot;seduced a whole generation into its inanities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or is it the older generation that the Internet has seduced -- into the<br/>
inanities of leveling charges based on fear, ignorance and old-media,<br/>
multiple-choice testing? So much so that we can&#39;t see that the Internet<br/>
is only a means of communication, and one that has created a generation,<br/>
perhaps the first, of writers, activists, storytellers?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020506399">That article is cool.  I brought some  more over here:<br/>
<br/>
-=-We&#39;re talking about 33 million Americans who are fluent in  <br/>
texting, e-mailing, blogging, IM&#39;ing and constantly amending their  <br/>
profiles on social network sites -- which, on average, 30 of their  <br/>
friends will visit every day, hanging out and writing for 20 minutes  <br/>
or so each. They&#39;re connected, they&#39;re collaborative, they&#39;re used to  <br/>
writing about themselves. In fact, they choose to write about  <br/>
themselves, on their own time, rather than its being a forced labor  <br/>
when a paper&#39;s due in school. Regularly, often late at night, they&#39;re  <br/>
generating a body of intimate written work. They appreciate the value  <br/>
of a good story and the power of a speech that moves: Ninety-seven  <br/>
percent of the teenagers in the Common Core survey connected &quot;I have  <br/>
a dream&quot; with its speaker -- they can watch Dr. King deliver it on  <br/>
demand -- and eight in 10 knew what &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is about.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is, of course, the kind of knowledge we should be  <br/>
encouraging. The Internet has turned teenagers into honest  <br/>
documentarians of their own lives -- reporters embedded in their  <br/>
homes, their schools, their own heads.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids are all on MySpace and are whizzes with YouTube.  Holly and  <br/>
Marty are great with Photoshop and digital cameras.  (Kirby&#39;s too  <br/>
old, maybe. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be wonderful for them to do a comparison of kids who  <br/>
have internet access and those who are forbidden to use the internet  <br/>
and see who&#39;s doing better.  But it might just show a genetic  <br/>
slowness in those whose parents want to keep their kids in 1962.<br/>
