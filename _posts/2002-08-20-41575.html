<div id="ygrps-yiv-555806598"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My question: if they pass the thing in their sophmore year shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; they be allowed to graduate?  Watch that one be shot down by the<br/>
&gt; board.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never understood that, either.  If you can pass it on the first day of<br/>
school, why go back?  They&#39;re only going to teach you what you need for the<br/>
test, right?  Stay home -- learn more!<br/>
