the Bible is literally true but I don&#39;t want to admit it to myself <br/>
yet. ;)<br/>

Well, if it makes you feel any better, the world is a lot less scary and better from this side!:)  I understand the fear associated with letting go of lifelong belief systems, but once you start questioning things it&#39;s so durn hard to stop eh? Pretty cool.<br/>
I am so much more happy and fulfilled since I let go of religion and embraced my spirituality. Not living from a place of fear has allowed me to love more fully, live more joyfully and truly be a life long learner.  <br/>
There is so much to see when you get out from behind a narrow view...so much truth and beauty and real life stuff. Don&#39;t be afraid to explore it, freedom is a wonderful thing.<br/>
