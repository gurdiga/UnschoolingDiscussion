Little kids watch TV; alert the media!<br/>
Jacob Sullum<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         And for our PDE website, we linked books and articles both pro and <br/>
con about what tv and computer use might do to change brain function. (Yes, <br/>
there are pros as well as cons -- be sure you get all sides of the &quot;research!&quot;) <br/>
<br/>
High Tech Debate: Does It Develop or Destroy Young Minds?<br/>
Dr. Jane Healy&#39;s work is linked there, as the best known opponent of <br/>
electronic media for young children. I remember that her books included the Japanese <br/>
studies that perhaps Teresa was seeking. At the same time,  others are <br/>
documenting gains in processing multiple inputs simultaneously from abstract data, in <br/>
military and similar technical applications for instance &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
         These are linked as part of PDE&#39;s Thinking Parent resource at:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I know a group of people who think allowing your kids unlimited access to <br/>
&gt; TV and video games is abusive to young children as it changes their thought <br/>
&gt; patterns and brain development.  It also contributes to overweight kids, poor <br/>
&gt; eye sight, ability to concentrate, and I can&#39;t remember what else.  I will <br/>
&gt; stress these are not my beliefs but things I have picked up from reading, <br/>
&gt; emails , and talking with NO TV proponents.  I had copies of some of the different <br/>
&gt; studies done in Japan about screen time and brain function.  (I&#39;ll note here <br/>
&gt; that they were the actual study reports not some persons idea of what those <br/>
&gt; reports had to say)  Unfortunately my pc blasted off into pop-up spamdem <br/>
&gt; trogen hell and the files along with all else on my pc were lost.  I&#39;ve hunted <br/>
&gt; for them and found two but they were the Japanese version and the translation <br/>
&gt; was not very accurate.  From what I did read there is evidence that yes it <br/>
&gt; does use parts of the brain differently or different part of the brain in <br/>
&gt; combination, than any other activity. <br/>

COOL!  I want to link that.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, on TV the other day, I meant to mention, an author was on a talk show <br/>
saying that 75% of American children under two years old have watched TV!!!  She <br/>
seemed SHOCKED!!  And she went on about how the news was a terrible thing for <br/>
little kids to know about, and some children watch TV for TWO HOURS in a day, <br/>
and they just shouldn &#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It just amused me, that her boogey man was the news, and I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s <br/>
just never around any two year olds.  <br/>
<br/>
She had not one interesting or new argument, just retread of the same old <br/>
stuff but she had great blonde hair and she spoke well, so she was on TV!  <br/>
Tra-la!  (Maybe I&#39;m being unfair in my assessment of her experience, but definitely <br/>
she was being unfair in her expressed opinion about TV evil.)<br/>
<br/>
Too many people will say what others want to hear.  &quot;Doesn&#39;t the emperor have <br/>
lovely new clothes!?&quot;  (GOSH, some think:  If someone that pretty and well <br/>
spoken sees them, I&#39;m going to say &quot;YES, beautiful clothes,&quot; and I hope I see <br/>
them soon.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776493062">&quot;In case parents need more reassurance on this score, Kaiser&#39;s survey found <br/>
no evidence that TV watching displaces other activities among children 3 and <br/>
younger. It also found that &quot;the portrayal of television watching among young <br/>
children as a highly solitary activity is not accurate,&quot; and that parents were <br/>
&quot;more likely to see positive than negative behaviors being copied&quot; from TV.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Press coverage of the study ignored or played down these and other upbeat <br/>
findings, instead emphasizing results that could be cited as cause for concern.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(For people who have a hard time getting to websites, I quoted my favorite <br/>
part.)<br/>
