<div id="ygrps-yiv-638520395">My 11 yr old son sat down yesterday and wrote a letter to a little boy that <br/>
we where giving a bike to.  After I read it I felt like a looser Mom.<br/>
<br/>
He had caps in places that they didn&#39;t belong, no commas etc.. How do I help <br/>
him with this, he has avoided any &quot;grammar teachings&quot; and this am when I went <br/>
over it with him I don&#39;t even think he herd me?<br/>
I my self am not very good and this was indeed my worst subject in school. He <br/>
was tested at school in 2nd grade and they responded by placing him in the <br/>
resource room and included a speech label also which I never understood? &lt;<br/>
sigh&gt; I had huge issues with this and he was teased daily until we took him <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
He has been tested at Sylvan Learning centers. His Vocabulary knowledge is <br/>
advanced (maybe cuz he was home with Me)? His reading comprehension to <br/>
himself is advanced but once he reads aloud his numbers dipped to at least 2 <br/>
years behind and couldn&#39;t remember what he read. I guess I attribute this to <br/>
being teased in school, I don&#39;t know?<br/>
Gosh, I almost feel like I am taking credit on the good stuff and blaming the <br/>
school for the bad. Shame on me!<br/>
<br/>
The beginning of this year I was testing his spelling it was a huge stress <br/>
all the way around so I stopped. When I went back 2 months later he knew how <br/>
to spell the words without the practice or book work.<br/>
<br/>
His writing is almost unreadable. When I offer to sit with him and work on <br/>
these he runs and says ahh, I just remembered I need to go rake the leaves or <br/>
something to the effect. Too funny! You know its not him either its me and my <br/>
panics over how he will favor in years to come.<br/>
<br/>
His other areas are great. He knows some HTML, web pages, how to sell, <br/>
customer service, he is polite to others, loves history, shoots archery and <br/>
guns with precision. He loves surfing,xbox,trampoline jumping with Mom (too <br/>
funny cuz im out of shape after baby) He likes to build, incubated chicks <br/>
last year, cared for someone chickens for a year and is now training our <br/>
Brittany.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, in an Unschooling life how do I help him? Do I do <br/>
anything, will it come on its own?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wish I had some advice, but I do know how you feel.  Like some how we <br/>
should expose our children to this so they at least have a concept that there <br/>
is a standard way of writing that includes things like capital letters, <br/>
punctuations and such.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been finding myself holding back sharing things with my daughter because <br/>
I want to be &quot;true&quot; to unschooling but at the same time torn because if I <br/>
don&#39;t bring it up or somehow expose her, she has no idea it even exists, let <br/>
alone want to incorporate it into her being.<br/>
<br/>
Like unschooling, I didn&#39;t even know it existed so how could I possibly have <br/>
known I wanted it for my children?<br/>
<br/>
So what to do?  Quietly &quot;correct&quot; the letter?  Hmmm seems wrong.  Point out <br/>
the capitalizations and punctuations in a non judgemental way?  Probably <br/>
wrong too.  Send off the letter with the poor grammer and let someone else <br/>
wonder what in the world this child could possibly be learning?  Probably the <br/>
only solution...<br/>
<br/>
I guess we have to give up on those preconcieved notions that we want our <br/>
children to appear to be learned and articulate and social and wonderful and <br/>
all of that and just let them be.<br/>
<br/>
But then my ever burning question about HOW do they find this if they are not <br/>
exposed?  Do we ever point out how books have certain punctuations?  Do we <br/>
just let them one day ask about it and think it&#39;s only for books?<br/>
<br/>
Oh Lord, I see the eyes rolling right now... Glena is ASKING QUESTIONS AGAIN!<br/>
<br/>
But hey, I&#39;m leaving for a romantic weekend in the mountains in a few hours <br/>
so I won&#39;t be asking and following up and trying to LEARN a new unschooling <br/>
task this weekend.  I will look forward to the responses when I return!<br/>

  Laura<br/>
<br/>
  My experience here is that it will come on its own. My 11 year old likes to write letters to his uncle who is in jail. He has always spelled with the sounds like system. When I i,n our early years at home, would suggest helping etc.. he too would lose interest. I shut up real quick and just explained to his uncle in my own letter that I would interpret later if he needed but that Kieran spelled this way and just read it as it sounds. He got it easily and did not need me to interpret.<br/>
  I was never criticised and even if I had been I did not care because my son was loving the relationship with his uncle and that could easily have been destroyed by my worrying what others thought of me. Now he has become interested in spelling and will occassionally ask for help. <br/>
  My older children who are 12 almost 13 and 14 almost 15 still are working on spelling. My almost 15 year old is all of the sudden spelling with great clarity and speed so it will happen.<br/>

I&#39;m really not sure why you think unschooling means holding back and <br/>
not sharing things with children.  I share everything with my kids.  <br/>
If they&#39;re interested, I&#39;ll help them find what they need to learn <br/>
more.  If they aren&#39;t interested, they can wander off and do <br/>
whatever.  Everytime I sit down with a book, my son comes over to ask <br/>
what I&#39;m reading.  Most of the time, he wanders away.  Occasionally, <br/>
he asks me to read it to him.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean that I hide <br/>
in the coat closet and read with a flashlight and hope he discovers <br/>
books on his own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not so much the basics like books that I would not share, it&#39;s the <br/>
DETAILS maybe is a better word.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been reading LOTS Of poetry the last couple of weeks and sharing back <br/>
and forth and talking about different authors and different times and what we <br/>
liked and what we thought was weird or strange or whatever.  Those kinds of <br/>
things are fine and are shared always.<br/>
<br/>
BUT things like the punctuations, the grammer things, Cait is pretty good at <br/>
writing but it&#39;s obvious that she&#39;s not real clear on when to capitalize and <br/>
when to not.  The use of commas and such could be cleared up as well.<br/>
<br/>
So like I said before I would feel like I was being &quot;pushy&quot; if I pointed <br/>
these things out yet I wonder how she will ever come to them if no one shows <br/>
her?  There are other things too but mostly it&#39;s in the details.<br/>
<br/>
I guess after the math response I&#39;m a little nervous about introducing her to <br/>
ANYTHING she hasn&#39;t explicitly asked about.  But it does leave me wondering <br/>
how she will be exposed to something she might end up loving but she didn&#39;t <br/>
know about to tell me she was interested.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like a sorta catch 22 situation maybe.  Obviously I&#39;m still trying to <br/>
find my own path and a good balance that will not have me worrying about the <br/>
details of it all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe when she&#39;s writing something she&#39;s planning to &quot;publish&quot; (as in send<br/>
it to someone or something) you could talk to her about copy editing.<br/>
Magazine and book publishers have someone go over the material to catch<br/>
spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors.  (Too bad newspapers no longer<br/>
do.  What a poor example of writing some of them are.)  You could ask her if<br/>
she&#39;d like some help with copy-editing her work.  If she says yes, you could<br/>
maybe pick one or two of the most glaring errors and point them out to her,<br/>
telling her how it would be done in published writing.<br/>
<br/>
The point is not to interfere with the writing process itself.  One of the<br/>
most common pieces of writing advice is to separate the editing process from<br/>
the actual writing process.<br/>

Sometimes they say yes, and often no.<br/>
<br/>
I will sometimes point out one or two things, but I&#39;ve never &quot;corrected&quot; a <br/>
whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
In the case you mentioned, I would probably have read it aloud and said <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s put periods so they can tell how you mean it to be read.&quot;   That&#39;s one <br/>
thing, and not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Or I might have said &quot;Do you want to type it up and print it out so we can <br/>
use a cute font and put a picture of a bicycle?&quot;  (And my kids would probably <br/>
say &quot;no&quot; but it&#39;s another idea for a way to get a second pass at it, and <br/>
maybe show them a spellchecker exists).<br/>

There is a vast world between telling them nothing and telling them <br/>

He&#39;s 11, it&#39;s not a priority.<br/>
The above sentence you wrote has several mistakes. Is it hugely important? We <br/>
understand what you wrote, I guess it&#39;s ok. :)<br/>
So maybe &quot;teaching&quot; is the problem all around. Both at home and at school.<br/>
<br/>
Exposing him to a world that is full of opportunities to write is far better <br/>
in my opinion.<br/>
Unschooling means trusting that when the skill becomes important, the person <br/>
will learn it with ease.<br/>
Trust him. Trust that it just isn&#39;t important right now. When he sees a need <br/>
for the skill he WILL figure it out, and you&#39;ll be there to help.<br/>
Until then, relax about writing, enjoy your child and have fun together. <br/>
Really.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a catch 22.  I think it&#39;s hard to grasp if you are <br/>
looking at it one-sided.  There is nothing wrong with exposing her to new <br/>
things...you SHOULD!  Key word being *exposing*.  Ex:  Hey!  I just read the <br/>
coolest book about reptiles.  They were talking about... and then they <br/>
showed...&quot;  That type of thing.  If she&#39;s interested, she&#39;ll probe for more. <br/>
  If not, she&#39;ll say so, either verbally or physically.<br/>
<br/>
As for the math response you recieved, I think you still aren&#39;t <br/>
understanding that those responses were because she explicitly expressed a <br/>
disinterest in math and you were buying CD&#39;s to encourage her to have *fun* <br/>
with it, as opposed to it being strictly educational for her.  See, had you <br/>
bought the math cd BEFORE she expressed a disinterest, THAT would be <br/>
exposing her to it.  If she wanted to walk away and never touch it and you <br/>
were ok with that...THAT would be trusting that your child just isn&#39;t ready <br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s offering something after your child has expressed NO desire in that <br/>
everyone had a problem with.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!<br/>

him how to spell words, and he writes them down. I say &quot;new word&quot; so that he <br/>
leaves a space. He knows what periods and commas and question marks and <br/>
exclamation marks are---not necessarily when to use them! But he knows what <br/>
they look like and what they mean. He uses only upper case letter, so that&#39;s <br/>
not an issue yet. But the &quot;rule&quot; is fairly simple, so I doubt it&#39;ll be hard <br/>
to remember. He follows along in the books I read him, so he SEES that they <br/>
begin sentences and names---and all caps are yelling/loud.<br/>
<br/>
If he were to write a letter, I&#39;d offer to read it back. If it didn&#39;t &quot;sound&quot; <br/>
right to HIM (by inflection of my voice), I&#39;d offer solutions---which he may <br/>
accept or not. It&#39;s HIS letter. I figure that, eventually, he&#39;ll want it <br/>
close to perfect, so he&#39;ll ask; I&#39;ll answer; and he&#39;ll get better and better.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;sink or swim&quot;. It&#39;s a process. Baby steps. Most people WANT to be <br/>
understood.<br/>

making sure your kids will learn these things. You&#39;re still stuck in the<br/>
thinking that these things are artificial. That they don&#39;t serve a purpose<br/>
in a child&#39;s real life so they need to be taught. And the answers you<br/>
received were about that academic mode of thinking, e.g., back off.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re extrapolating the answer into life -- even though you&#39;re *still*<br/>
asking about academics -- and seeing only two choices: pushing and not<br/>
introducing. Those aren&#39;t really the choices at all. Would you see those as<br/>
your only choices if we were talking about Egypt or video games or horse<br/>
backriding? Would you be concerned about &quot;pushing&quot; Egypt on them? What would<br/>
that look like? It would look like you thought there were important things<br/>
they needed to know and you didn&#39;t trust that life was enough to give it to<br/>
them. Would you be concerned about not introducing Egypt to them? Well, you<br/>
*should* be! *You* should be stumbling across Egypt (and other stuff) and<br/>
pointing out some cool things to them.<br/>
<br/>
Your son *does* see writing with punctuation. It&#39;s there all around him.<br/>
Unless you are deliberately keeping books from him. How could he not be<br/>
exposed to it?<br/>
<br/>
The idea of offering to be his copy editor is good but I wouldn&#39;t express it<br/>
as a concern but as a useful idea. I&#39;ve suggested to my daughter that if she<br/>
wants *other people* to be able to understand the story she&#39;s telling that<br/>
standard spelling and punctuation will help them do that. Creative spelling<br/>
could make them miss the point she&#39;s trying to make.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think of math and writing as any different than Egypt. Point out cool<br/>
stuff to your kids. If they think it&#39;s interesting or useful then they&#39;ll be<br/>
interested and ask questions. Make sure your life is such that interesting<br/>
things about lots of stuff is running through their lives so they know stuff<br/>
exist and they could pick something up and run with it if they wanted to.<br/>

math that I personally think is fun and my child might very well enjoy and I <br/>
buy it, lay it around downstairs for her to use or NOT use, that could be <br/>
construed as meaning I am being too &quot;pushy&quot; about math, BUT if I find <br/>
something very interesting to do, like umm... maybe a new recipe to try out <br/>
and I lay it around and by the ingredients and ask her if she&#39;d like to make <br/>
it, that might be a GOOD thing?<br/>
<br/>
Or if I&#39;m reading a book about poetry for example, it&#39;s very OK to ask her if <br/>
she&#39;d like to read it or to lay it around for her to pick up or not and then <br/>
to discuss and investigate further with her?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably just making this way too complicated.  I really don&#39;t accept any <br/>
part of the &quot;schooling&quot; stuff.  Everything in life is a learning experience <br/>
and I truly believe children should learn about what interests them most but <br/>
I recognize there are other things that one must assimilate into one&#39;s brain <br/>
at some point in order to fit into society.  Language, math skills, writing, <br/>
reading, are all things that one must obtain at some point I recognize this, <br/>
and I also recognize that there is no hurry for any one bit of information, <br/>
the child will ask for it when they feel the need/desire for it.<br/>

disinterest.  It was that she had shown NO interest, big difference.  She <br/>
also hasn&#39;t expressed any interest in rebuilding a car engine but hey, who <br/>
knows I might get a book about that.<br/>
<br/>
I was worried that I, personally, ME wasn&#39;t doing enough to expose her to the <br/>
&quot;fun&quot; side of math.  That was the big question.  I had read a lot of posts <br/>
about how some of the children represented on this list LOVE math.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
see Cait seeking out ANY mathy FUN type activities and was worried I was <br/>
somehow cheating her by not exposing her to enough, not nurturing that &quot;love <br/>
of math&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t like she had told me at any point she disliked math, didn&#39;t want to do <br/>
math or had no interest.  I had just never seen her attempt any activity that <br/>
might involve math at any higher level and of course with the HS principals <br/>
comment to me that math is built in layers and that she really should be <br/>
exposed to more so it wasn&#39;t so difficult for her later echoing in my ears, I <br/>
wondered if a computer game laying on a shelf was enough.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s enough and I got lots of good responses that should me about ways to <br/>
incorporate math everyday and to feel assured that she will find her way to <br/>
the &quot;advanced&quot; stuff when the time is right and that I am NOT cheating her by <br/>
just doing nothing about it.<br/>

It wasn&#39;t a math incident.<br/>

It was an incident where people reflected to you your apparent attitudes and <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re still telling us (and sarcastically) what you think we said as though <br/>
it is what WAS said.  It wasn&#39;t about the game or where you set the disk.  It <br/>
was about what you told us about the need for math and what you showed us <br/>
about your beliefs concerning all that.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of telling us what we said, or trying to decide what your daughter <br/>
needs or thinks, just live a busy, happy, talkative life.  If you can&#39;t <br/>
decide what to do about a recipe or a punctuation problem, think of what you <br/>
would say if it were an adult friend of yours instead of &quot;just a child.&quot;  Try <br/>
to respond and react as you would to people<br/>
instead of trying to figure out what others thing should be the response to <br/>
an unschooled child.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eeks.  These all seem wrong to me.  There are a thousand or more<br/>
solutions in between the extremes that you are suggesting.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter e-mails friends and family and various website (especially<br/>
ZOOM a lot currently).  She sends a lot of notes off without me seeing<br/>
them.  Once in a while I will see something that she wrote and if there<br/>
is a glaring misspelling or grammatical error, I usually say something<br/>
along the lines of:  &quot;The person you are sending that to might think<br/>
that you mean &quot;x&quot;.  Is that what you meant, or did you mean &quot;y&quot;<br/>
instead?&quot;  I wait for her answer, and she either doesn&#39;t care (about 1/3<br/>
the time) or she wonders why they would think &quot;x&quot; and I point out that<br/>
most people spell goat g-o-a-t instead of g-o-t (this is a very old<br/>
example).  [Sometimes she even says that while most of the world might<br/>
spell something a certain way, her way is better and then she leaves<br/>
it.]<br/>
<br/>
I never intrude and force her to change her style, but I or my husband<br/>
is ALWAYS available to help her if she wants help (and we stop if she<br/>
wants no more help).  Sometimes she just gets tired of writing or typing<br/>
and she dictates the rest while one of us types (then she corrects our<br/>
typos).  :)  It goes both ways, she sees that whenever I send something<br/>
super important off, I almost always put it through a spell check and<br/>
have DH read it (or sometimes her recently).  I certainly would never<br/>
red check mark her work all up, but I will offer suggestions on how to<br/>
make things more easily readable to the audience that she wants to read<br/>
it.<br/>

remember correctly but the math, I believe, was because you thought she <br/>
needed math to get into college and then into med school and you were worried <br/>
that she was not preparing enough for that now.  And wanted to know what you <br/>
could buy or do to help her become interested in math.  The why in that <br/>
scenario was the part that was not unschooling and was pushy.<br/>

at<br/>
&gt; writing but it&#39;s obvious that she&#39;s not real clear on when to capitalize<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; when to not.  The use of commas and such could be cleared up as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of that kind of thing comes with just reading a bunch of different<br/>
stuff and after awhile the things that are wrong stand out more to your<br/>
eye.. But some of it is just memorization of rules (most of them terribly<br/>
inconsistent). Even people who make writing their *career* have professional<br/>
editors to fix bad punctuation and grammar and spell checkers to fix the<br/>
spelling. And in any given message on this list, you can find scads of<br/>
grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors (probably including this sentence,<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re supposed to start with &quot;And&quot;). When my writing counts,<br/>
I use the spell checker and even pull out Strunk for grammar.<br/>

writing, I totally lose my flow and the story comes to a screeching halt.<br/>
One of the things I learned in reading a whole bunch of books on writing is<br/>
that most authors have (what they consider) terrible first drafts. Even<br/>
famous authors like Hemingway (who I think originated the quote &quot;The first<br/>
draft is always sh*t&quot;) often revised their text as many as 20 or 30 times.<br/>
I&#39;m on about the 8th draft of my novel right now and hoping this one is the<br/>
last! One thing that really helped my son is that he sat with me as I read<br/>
aloud and edited my own chapters. He loved hearing me read my writing out<br/>
loud, but even more importantly it freed him to just start writing his own<br/>
stuff without worry so much about it being perfect (he tends to be a<br/>
perfectionist). He would ask me why I was crossing out and changing so many<br/>
things, and I explained about the revision process. After doing that with<br/>
me, his own writing just took off.<br/>
<br/>
Any new thing looks really, really hard when you first start out. And if you<br/>
see people who are already doing it well, it can seem like it just came<br/>
easily to them. I think it&#39;s really helpful for kids to see adults learning<br/>
new things, struggling, making mistakes, starting over, failing, falling<br/>
down and getting back up. It lets them know that things don&#39;t come easily<br/>
for either, even though we are big and may seem more competent at<br/>
everything.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do that already, my children are human beings, I do not treat them <br/>
different from adults in my life.  However, I AM responsible for these <br/>
wonderful creatures that have been intrusted to my care, I&#39;m not at all <br/>
responsible if an adult in my neighborhood does something that turns out <br/>
drastically because I did or didn&#39;t do something.<br/>
<br/>
There is WAY more at stake with my precious child than with any other adult I <br/>
will ever encounter in my life.  I HAVE to get it right.  Therefore, I will <br/>
probably always worry that I am doing it right and being all I can be and <br/>
encouraging and guiding and being the mother that my children deserve.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t all that you described at all, maybe you are making it way more <br/>
involved than it is... it was the simple question in life, &quot;am I doing <br/>
enough&quot; for my child.  That particular day it was about math.  I wanted her <br/>
to have the LOVE of math that others children had.  I didn&#39;t want her to NOT <br/>
know that joy, I just didn&#39;t know how to find it, nurture it, show her that <br/>
joy, I don&#39;t have it in MY life, but was willing to find new ways if others <br/>
were offered.  Others were offered I explored them, it&#39;s great.<br/>
<br/>
I was NOT being sarcastic in the post I made at all.  I don&#39;t understand <br/>
where YOU get so defensive about MY posts.  They are not meant as anything <br/>
other than the words you read there.  I don&#39;t have the cunning wit for <br/>
sarcasm nor the personality for it.  I&#39;m straight forward and I use the words <br/>
that mean exactly what I say.<br/>
<br/>
I do question something backwards and forwards and I want to know exactly how <br/>
this should work or the outcome of &quot;that&quot; particular thing.  That is just my <br/>
learning style, my nature, my being.  It is not meant to make anyone question <br/>
their own lives, values or anything else, it is NOT meant as sarcasm.  In <br/>
fact I really don&#39;t know exactly what you were referring to as being <br/>
sarcastic, that&#39;s how far off you are with that post.<br/>
<br/>
Seems you are trying edge towards a discussion of the value of my posts yet <br/>
again.  I&#39;m not going to debate that issue with you.  It&#39;s a discussion <br/>
group, we post, we ask questions, we answer, we discuss.  I do too.<br/>

&gt; were trying to show her how fun it can be.  Do you honestly not see <br/>
&gt; the difference? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure she&#39;s heard the term but she&#39;s never been introduced to it formally <br/>
or in any way that I&#39;m aware of.  She&#39;s not locked in a basement but we don&#39;t <br/>
have school books lying around and maybe I should.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure.  I know modeling is a big thing.  I also know that I don&#39;t sit <br/>
around and enjoyably do anything closely resembling algebra or even close to <br/>
it.  So my concern was where did your children develop this love of math.  <br/>
What activity did they see you modeling that provoked their minds to want to <br/>
know more.<br/>
<br/>
I recognize that some people are just more naturally inclined towards math or <br/>
whatever but at some point they had to be given the words for this <br/>
inclination.  How they were introduced, what forms did it take?<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;my&quot; obsession with her learning math.  Yep, that week it was a big <br/>
deal to me, I just had a trusted friend, who the principal of the local high <br/>
school tell me what a disservice I was doing for Cait by not exposing her to <br/>
math right now.  That it was a layers thing and had to built on layer by <br/>
layer and not all learned at once.  I panicked, it happens.  I KNEW I surely <br/>
wasn&#39;t exposing her to ANY math.  Of course she WOULD need it at some point.  <br/>
So I asked the &quot;experts&quot; that I knew who&#39;ve been on this journey longer than <br/>
I.  I got lots of answers and it helped.  The best ones were the ones that <br/>
told me there was plenty of time for math.  That it CAN be learned at once, <br/>
when one is ready.  That I am NOT being an irresponsible mother because my <br/>
child has not professed an undying love of math at age 14.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about it anymore in the math context.  I do question everything <br/>
I do almost to make sure that I am not &quot;offering&quot; something she is not <br/>
interested in and questioning that I am &quot;offering&quot; enough to pique her <br/>
interests in all things, enough to expose her to something brand new that she <br/>
might just fall in love with, but not offer it  in a way that would make her <br/>
feel it was MY choice and not hers.<br/>
<br/>
We only get one shot at being the very best parent we can be for each child. <br/>
I want to know I got it right by doing the very best that I knew how at the <br/>
time I was parenting my child.<br/>
<br/>
I guess if I really didn&#39;t care it would be a lot easier, send her to school <br/>
and let them figure it out, but I do care and now I KNOW better, so there is <br/>
no excuse other than for me to do this the right way, the best that I can do <br/>
for her.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a balancing act for sure... at least early on... to me <br/>
anyway...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834991014">Hi glena<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If I may just jump in here. Your comments and concerns sound a lot <br/>
like mine. In feeling it out, this unschooling method, I&#39;ve done some <br/>
reading in the past few months, and spent some time at a website <br/>
where the Sudbury school is explored. <br/>
<br/>
I first read about Sudbury via John Gatto&#39;s writings, and found them <br/>
through a google search. On that page is a Discuss Sudbury Model <br/>
email list, not very active on a daily basis, but lots and lots of <br/>
good stuff about the unschooling idea. There&#39;s also a link somewhere <br/>
in there under free texts, where an alumnus of Sudbury tells of his <br/>
experience at the school. Mind you, this is a place where there is <br/>
ZERO formal instruction. Kids are free to spend their time just <br/>
exactly as they see fit: a lake on the property, helping adults <br/>
refurbish a barn or cook lunch, or doing those independent of adult <br/>
interaction, playing video games all day. Nothing is &quot;taught&quot; there <br/>
as a subject.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the article that I&#39;m thinking of describes how a boy got <br/>
interested in Algebra. this is the link to those alumni articles <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sudval.org/texts/kingdom.html">http://www.sudval.org/texts/kingdom.html</a> <br/>
<br/>
It is the first article, number 11, and I found it fascinating and <br/>
hope engendering: the kid got an interest in nuclear science by some <br/>
reading, and found he couldn&#39;t understand most of what he read, <br/>
because he didn&#39;t know algebra. And so...he taught it to himself.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend reading the stuff at the Sudbury page. Articles by <br/>
the students, by the teachers. They have a lengthy track record of <br/>
turning out literate, numerate, confident individuals, without any <br/>
external pressure of any sort. Kids just doing what they want to do <br/>
with their time, every day of the school year. <br/>
<br/>
peace, HeidiC</div>

THANK YOU, that is EXACTLY what I was asking/hoping/looking for.  I do NOT <br/>
intend for my questions to be confrontational but I DO want to find every bit <br/>
of information I can to be the very best that I can be for my children.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU that is VERY helpful!!!<br/>
