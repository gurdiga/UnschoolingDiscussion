<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072440439">Hi, all!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to introduce myself and family.  I&#39;ve been receiving the digest for a few days now, and boy, I feel like I&#39;ve found a new home!  We just started unschooling this year...the previous two years Evan (8 3/4) was in a charter school.  I *forgot* about trusting my instincts once he was school age!  I knew that school seemed so bizarre to me, just the concept of it, but I envisioned homeschooling as us just butting heads as I tried to &quot;teach&quot; him.  Silly me...I didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; him to nurse, walk, talk, laugh, and be, why couldn&#39;t I see I didn&#39;t need to &quot;teach&quot; him to have a good life?  Anyway, with experience after experience at school teaching him to not trust his feelings or his own interests, I did some investigating and found unschooling.  Ahhhhhhhhhhh.......<br/>
He&#39;s enjoying things so far...the first few days (after spending the day in the woods exploring who/what lived there, learning how to look up words in the dictionary, looking up why bees are the color they are, etc., etc.), he kept saying, &quot;Mama, we forgot to homeschool today!&quot;  I think of that as a success.<br/>
I&#39;m at home (which means we&#39;re almost never at home!) with Evan and his brother, Seth (2 1/2).  I&#39;m currently watching another 2 1/2 y.o. named AJ.  My husband, John, is a programmer to make a living and a musician to feed his soul.  At one point, I was (and still may be) interested in becoming a Waldorf teacher, but my stuff is on hold for the time being.  I mean, my stuff besides life lived just for today!<br/>
We live in Charlotte, NC -- where I&#39;ve lived my whole life.  <br/>
I&#39;m so glad I found this list and that you guys are out there!  Is there a list somewhere on the archives that lists members/where you&#39;re from?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700565891">Hi Caren<br/>
Welcome!<br/>
You sound a lot like I did.  I was just explaining to another hs mom <br/>
today, why we started in the first place.  I said that I never had <br/>
considered homeschooling because the idea of doing school at home and <br/>
what I knew that would do to our(mine and the kids) relationship, did <br/>
not appeal to me at all.  Then I discovered it didn&#39;t HAVE to be that <br/>
way, and away we went!<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087917768">Hi-  I have been lurking here for quite a few weeks now and I finally <br/>
decided to join in.  Quite a bit of what I have seen has been inspiring and <br/>
quite eduactional.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters are 4.5 and 2.  While I was pregnant with the first, dh and I <br/>
decided that homeschooling was the way to go.  As the stay at home parent, I <br/>
have made most of the decisions and phone calls involving each kid&#39;s <br/>
activities.  Not that he was out of the loop, he just wasn&#39;t able to do most <br/>
of the calls and was tired at night when he got in from work.  I would bring <br/>
up things I have seen and done, left library books (mine and the girls&#39;) <br/>
around so that he would be aware of what our interests are and try to make <br/>
him feel as involved as he so desperately wanted to be, but couldn&#39;t from <br/>
having to go off to the &quot;mines&quot; every day.<br/>
<br/>
Lately (over the past year or so), he has been getting quite a few questions <br/>
from people at his work abour when and where we are going to put the kids <br/>
into school.  One day, not too long ago, he told me that when people ask he <br/>
tells them that &quot;we are thinking seriously about looking into the <br/>
possibility of homeschooling...&quot;  HUH?  this started a HUGE discussion <br/>
between us.  Turns out that while I tought we were on the same page, he was <br/>
under the impression that my unschooling approach was really &quot;just dragging <br/>
my feet until the time we need to register the kids with the local <br/>
authorities and get our asses in gear.&quot;  He seems to think there was going <br/>
to be some kind of curriculum involved and we were going to have school at <br/>
home!  All of a sudden, I am made aware that he can&#39;t really get behind <br/>
unschooling because he doesn&#39;t think it will work long term.<br/>
<br/>
I do know my own limitations (I am a control freak) and I know that at some <br/>
point we will probably fall off the unschooling wagon because I just <br/>
couldn&#39;t let things be.  I know this and am ok with the thought of coping <br/>
with that later.  However, this approach has been unbelievable so far and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t imagine a better way of exploring the world with my girls right <br/>
now.  My question is this- has anyone had a similar issue withh a spouse and <br/>
what ways did you approach it so as to not hurt feelings?  My husband wants <br/>
to be involved but he has doubts about this philosophy.  Seeing is believing <br/>
won&#39;t work because he barely sees th kids while they are awake some days!<br/>
<br/>
I know that there is a lot of discussion about how to deal with people who <br/>
just don&#39;t get it (I have had some experience with that already- 99% of both <br/>
of our families are very worried for our kids)  Most of the time, I say my <br/>
piece and then agree to disagree.  I just cannot do this with dh...<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kay<br/>

<br/>
What&#39;s the compulsory school age in your state?   If you&#39;re lucky it<br/>
won&#39;t be until age seven and then you can agree with you&#39;re husband that <br/>
the girls will learn at home with you and school can be worried about<br/>
when the time comes.  <br/>
You&#39;d have a lot of time then to enlighten your husband about unschooling<br/>
and he&#39;d have more time to think things over.   When he&#39;s with them help<br/>
him notice what they&#39;re doing.    <br/>
<br/>
It IS hard to convince someone.    Your family members and  friends may<br/>
never come around but if you can rally support from your husband those<br/>
others won&#39;t matter much.   Listen to his concerns and do what you can to<br/>
address them.   Has he talked to you about specific concern?   Bring them<br/>
here and get some ideas.   Would he read about unschooling?   Is he open<br/>
to hearing about it, at least?  <br/>

seriously. But he also needs to respect that since you&#39;re doing the research<br/>
and the doing, that your knowledge of how children learn is growing by leaps<br/>

<br/>
Is it 2 years each for a Masters and a Doctorate? Well you&#39;ve had 4.5 years<br/>
;-) If you got a doctorate in English Literature, wouldn&#39;t he defer to you<br/>
greater knowledge of Chaucer?<br/>
<br/>
What you need to do is gain his confidence that you are gaining knowledge<br/>
that is similar in scope. Confidence helps. Quoting things helps. Will he<br/>
read? You could send him emails or leave books open or articles you&#39;ve<br/>
printed out in the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t necessarily get him up to the speed that you are because you have<br/>
a lot more time to spend so he&#39;s going to have to trade off that knowledge<br/>
for confidence in you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a husband who &quot;got it&quot; fairly quickly---but still, there was a time <br/>
when I was leaps and bounds ahead of him on this too. <br/>
<br/>
Ben was out of town for two weeks when I did all my research on <br/>
homeschooling. I had this HUGE spiel---marked books and articles and a <br/>
rehearsed speech! I was PREPARED! He&#39;d no sooner walked in the door when I <br/>
said, &quot;Ben, we need to talk about homeschooling the boys.&quot; He said, &quot;OK. <br/>
Sounds good.&quot; I kept insisting that I needed to explain how and why and who <br/>
and everything. <br/>
<br/>
He finally said, &quot;Look: I TRUST you. I can SEE you&#39;ve done all this research. <br/>
And I know you would NEVER do anything to harm the children. If YOU didn&#39;t <br/>
think this was right for them and us, you wouldn&#39;t be trying to convince me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, it was NICE that he trusted me---but I really wanted to use my speech! &lt;<br/>
G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Like Joyce said, there&#39;s got to be a level of TRUST because this is your <br/>
field of &quot;expertise&quot;---YOU&#39;re the one seeing them every day and seeing the <br/>
learning taking place.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Confidence helps. Quoting things helps. Will he read?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Confidence is BIG! Quotes from here and John Holt&#39;s books and the message <br/>
boards are helpful. I print out stuff all the time: I have a Book of Joyce, <br/>
of Sandra, of Zenmomma (Mary), of Anne, of Pam, of Deb  that I can pull out <br/>
whenever I need a quote---not necessarily for Ben, although he likes to read <br/>
them, but for others---and for myself for inspiration. Sometimes they make it <br/>
to the refrigerator door or the bathroom mirror for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Writing down what the kids did each day might help too. <br/>
<br/>
Ben had his &quot;enlightened moment&quot; reading Mary Griffith&#39;s The Unschooling <br/>
Handbook (It&#39;s a &quot;snappy&quot; read; men tend to like it a lot). That&#39;s when he <br/>
&quot;GOT&quot; unschooling. He called me from out of town and said, &quot;Quit making him <br/>
do ____! That&#39;s NOT UNschooling!&quot;    I had been trying to make BEN happy by <br/>
having Cam do something &quot;schoolish&quot; every now and then while we tried to <br/>
unschool. I said, &quot;I was just DOing it to make YOU happy.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, <br/>
STOP! I get it now!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Patience helps, too! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And when he *finally* gets it, you&#39;ll both wonder why/when he never DID! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

whole idea was just read aloud certain parts of the books I was reading.  <br/>
Just little bits.  I think I started out reading The Unschooling Handbook <br/>
when we were on a road trip somewhere and occasionally when I would get to a <br/>
really good quote I would just say listen to this.  So it wasn&#39;t about me <br/>
convincing him or arguing with him it was just me reading.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Kay and welcome.<br/>
<br/>
My first thought is that since your oldest is only 4.5 you still have a <br/>
while to talk up and demonstrate unschooling to your dh before academics in <br/>
school would kick in. Try finding a preschool/kindergarten scope and <br/>
sequence. &lt;shudder&gt; Without even knowing you or your children, I can say <br/>
fairly certainly that you&#39;ve already &quot;covered&quot; all the academics they push <br/>
on kids at 4 and 5. Most of those years are spent learning how to be in <br/>
school. How to line up and quiet down and perform when they ask.<br/>
<br/>
You could also start gently showing him some articles and books on <br/>
unschooling. Lots of moms print out replies from this list or the message <br/>
boards at unschooling.com to share.  Where do you live? Maybe there&#39;s a good <br/>
conference coming to a town near you.<br/>
<br/>
It will be an ongoing process as you gently show him this new path and he <br/>
(hopefully) sees his kids mature and learn and blossom.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Deb L, glad you de-lurked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe that the compulsory age is 6 around here.  However, I just figured <br/>
that I would get any ducks I needed to get in a row as time got closer.  It <br/>
was never a high priority for me to make the state happy- just my kids :)  I <br/>
do know that my school district is very pro homeschool compared to others <br/>
and so I never thought I would have to really plead my case in huge details <br/>
to anyone, let  alone dh!<br/>
<br/>
To make it clear: he is not against homeschooling at all. He is actually a <br/>
certified teacher and has done some subbing in public schools duing tighter <br/>
times.  He knows first hand how damaging the system can be to kids and <br/>
supports alternatives to public school whole heartedly.  I think that if we <br/>
had the $$$ lying around, he might have given more of a &quot;fight&quot; in favor to <br/>
some private school somewhere.  Since this wasn&#39;t an option, it was either <br/>
public or home.  That was the easy part of the journey in the early years!!<br/>
<br/>
I never labeled my methods as unschooling (I personally don&#39;t like the term, <br/>
I do prefer something along the lines of &quot;child led learning&quot;).  I just <br/>
found that my older daughter was a natural self educator. She has an <br/>
extremely long attention span for a kid her age, and always has.  She gets <br/>
excited to explore so many things and I find myself as deeply involved in er <br/>
&quot;obsessions&quot; (as we call them around here) as she is. My younger one as <br/>
started getting involved- giving 110% of her small attention and effort to <br/>
keeping up.  When dh is home and awake he does get into whatever chaos is <br/>
happening:)  I think he issue maybe that he does not see this as learning.  <br/>
Or, if it is, how can it possibly satisfy some state requirements down the <br/>
line? OR, yes the girls seem to be picking up all sorts of information now, <br/>
but as their brains develop and crave more complex info, how can we provide <br/>
this stuff without some kind of plan?  AND, don&#39;t we need some kind of <br/>
predetermined plan layed out to make sure that we don&#39;t miss anything?<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to patiently explain how all these things are completely <br/>
irrelevant, especially right now.  He got me so worked up at one point, I <br/>
told him that if he was so darn sure we needed a curriculim, he could go <br/>
ahead a write one! Not one of my prouder moments.  He tried and then <br/>
realized that it was useless- not only could he pin down what he thought a <br/>
4-5 yr old might need, but he knew that the paper would get buried under <br/>
some pile somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I have been leaving all sorts of lit around the house for years.  I bring up <br/>
interesting points I have read and heard.  I have even brought up some of <br/>
the things I have seen on this post. He is certainly not opposed to learning <br/>
about anyting that may involve the kids!  He just has some ideas that are <br/>
very entrenched in his brain... I try not to nag.  The last thing I want is <br/>
bully him.  I would SO love for him to come to the realization that this has <br/>
and can work on his own with the minimal amount of nagging. One of his major <br/>
fears about unschooling is the ability for kids to learn self regulating.  <br/>
Another of it is how does a parent &quot;make sure&quot; that their kid is prepared <br/>
for all subjects when thet kid may decide to never explore long division <br/>
while living at home, or some other subject that society deems necessary for <br/>
someone to master by the time they are 18.  MY biggest concern is also about <br/>

Well I would suggest reading the archives and printing out some posts on <br/>
such things that you and your husband are concerned with. Not &quot;all&quot; of us <br/>
can be wrong! Get some books. Read some parts to him if he&#39;s not finding the <br/>
time to read himself. Fill him with all the information you can about all <br/>
the other people who have this work wonderfully for them and their families. <br/>
I&#39;m sure doing the research for him will also put your mind at ease to when <br/>
you see how great this can be for the children, not just when they are small <br/>
but for always. How really great it can be for the family. It&#39;s worth the <br/>
effort.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; now.  My question is this- has anyone had a similar issue withh a spouse and<br/>
&gt; what ways did you approach it so as to not hurt feelings?  My husband wants<br/>
&gt; to be involved but he has doubts about this philosophy.  Seeing is believing<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t work because he barely sees th kids while they are awake some days!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome, Kay.<br/>
<br/>
My husband isn&#39;t doubting what I do, but I can definitely relate to the<br/>
barely-around sort.  My dh is in the army, and it&#39;s not unusual for him to<br/>
be gone for weeks at a stretch.<br/>
<br/>
I interpreted what you wrote to indicate that your husband is alright with<br/>
what you&#39;re doing right now, but has serious concerns in the long run.  But<br/>
do you really need to try to change his mind about &quot;the long run&quot; right now,<br/>
or can you just work with today?  Your children are 4.5 and 2.  They&#39;re not<br/>
even official school age yet.<br/>
<br/>
Do you let your husband know what happens at your house each day, while he&#39;s<br/>
gone?  When mine is in the field, I send a daily email with just chatty news<br/>
of what&#39;s happening at home.  It&#39;s reassuring to him to know what Tim (6<br/>
yrs) is up to, interested in, etc.  That&#39;s also where I share with him some<br/>
of the great insights I&#39;ve gotten here.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband may not be gone overnight and may not have email, but maybe you<br/>
can just journal some notes to share great moments with him that you&#39;d<br/>
otherwise forget. <br/>
<br/>
But my best advice would be to show him how great your kids are doing today,<br/>
and let tomorrow worry about itself.  And the answer to everyone else can<br/>
be, &quot;Things are going great right now; if we need help, we&#39;ll be sure to let<br/>
you know!&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; AND, don&#39;t we need some kind of <br/>
predetermined plan layed out to make sure that we don&#39;t miss anything?<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to patiently explain how all these things are completely <br/>
irrelevant, especially right now.  He got me so worked up at one point, I <br/>
told him that if he was so darn sure we needed a curriculim, he could go <br/>
ahead a write one! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this link below will work, but a live link came over a yahoo <br/>
group to me this morning, so I&#39;m trying it.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to &quot;use a curriculum&quot; and he doesn&#39;t have to write one.  You <br/>
could just start off with a checklist.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to have the K-2 Albuquerque Public Schools Expected Competencies.  <br/>
It&#39;s a list of the things kids need to know to pass a grade, and things the <br/>
teachers should manage to include at some point over the year.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was five, I used to check it every week or so, then every month, <br/>
and then I forgot all about it for a long time.  But I would mark the things <br/>
he knew.  He never knew about the list, but it made me more confident.  <br/>
Pretty soon I knew I didn&#39;t need to check the list.<br/>
<br/>
I also got the Hirsch books &quot;What your 1st Grader Needs to Know&quot; and we just <br/>
used them like any other books, sometimes reading a story or looking at <br/>
something.  Holly likes the history and politics stuff, about presidents, and <br/>
about the Greek senate.  But we&#39;ve never used them as &quot;text books,&quot; any more <br/>
than coloring books or word-search or I Spy or Garfield or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Online there is Worldbook&#39;s general curriculum.  This was designed originally <br/>
as an aid to people who bought the encyclopedias, and you got it when you <br/>
bought a set.  Now it&#39;s available to anyone, and if you shared that with your <br/>
husband, the two of you could aim toward exposure to those kinds of topics <br/>
without being schoolish about it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2.worldbook.com/parents/course_study_curr0.asp&quot;">http://www2.worldbook.com/parents/course_study_curr0.asp&quot;</a>&gt;| W o r l <br/>
d  B o o k |&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend approaching the situation in a temporary fashion.  &quot;Let&#39;s <br/>
try unschooling until it&#39;s not working.&quot;<br/>

just told dh that I didn&#39;t think Lars should go that year.  He wouldn&#39;t even<br/>
have been 5 during the first month and a half of school.  Rod agreed with<br/>
that.  I just carried on unschooling (as I understood it then) as if we were<br/>
always going to be doing that.  I figured if he wanted to bring it up he<br/>
could.  He didn&#39;t.  One thing he did object to were negative stories about<br/>
schools and teachers.  His school experiences were mostly positive.  So I<br/>
just concentrated on the positives of homeschooling for a long time.  I<br/>
think it was probably 4 or 5 years before he became a convinced unschooling<br/>
supporter.  Around that time he told me that he thought Lars would have<br/>
ended up being a bully in school.  (He&#39;s always been big and strong for his<br/>
age, and he had some trouble controlling his use of his strength for a<br/>
while.)  We haven&#39;t looked back.<br/>

&gt;certified teacher and has done some subbing in public schools duing tighter<br/>
&gt;times.  He knows first hand how damaging the system can be to kids and<br/>
&gt;supports alternatives to public school whole heartedly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This might make the transition to unschooling a little harder for him. He <br/>
sees the damage of a &quot;public&quot; school education. Not necessarily of school in <br/>
general. If he&#39;ll stick it out for awhile, he&#39;ll start noticing how your <br/>
kids are retaining their sense of joyful inquiry while schooled kids are <br/>
burning out and getting bored and discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think he issue maybe that he does not see this as learning.&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt;line?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What requirements does your state actually have?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;OR, yes the girls seem to be picking up all sorts of information now, but <br/>
&gt;&gt;as their brains develop and crave more complex info, how can we provide <br/>
&gt;&gt;this stuff without some kind of plan?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seems to me that as they crave it, you can plan it. :o) There&#39;s no way to <br/>
know now what they&#39;ll need at 16.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;AND, don&#39;t we need some kind of predetermined plan layed out to make sure <br/>
&gt;&gt;that we don&#39;t miss anything?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everyone misses something. The schools, the curriculum users, the unit study <br/>
practitioners, the unschoolers. It&#39;s not possible to know everything about <br/>
everything. Especially when everything keeps changing and evolving. <br/>
BUT...the difference with unschoolers is that we don&#39;t tell our kids that <br/>
learning starts &quot;now&quot; and ends &quot;then.&quot; The learning never starts and the <br/>
learning never ends. There are no limits to asking another question. There <br/>
is no shame in not knowing an answer YET. It&#39;s really a beautifully thought <br/>
out open ended system.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He got me so worked up at one point, I told him that if he was so darn <br/>

able to create the studies and show you how to implement them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He tried and then realized that it was useless- not only could he pin down <br/>
&gt;&gt;what he thought a 4-5 yr old might need, but he knew that the paper would <br/>
&gt;&gt;get buried under some pile somewhere.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See? It worked. It allowed him the time to really think about what he was <br/>
asking of you and the kids. Of course he couldn&#39;t pin down what *every* 4-5 <br/>
year old should know. Each one is different and their abilities and <br/>
interests are all over the place. How wonderful of him to realize that. <br/>
Seems like he even realized that the paper would get buried as far more <br/>
interesting learning opportunities come up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;One of his major fears about unschooling is the ability for kids to learn <br/>

&gt;&gt;for someone to master by the time they are 18.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does anyone need to master long division by age 18? If they don&#39;t need <br/>
it in real life, then they don&#39;t need it. If they decide to get a job or <br/>
take a course that requires it, then they&#39;ll have 18 years of practice at <br/>
learning what they need and want to know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I worry about being able to let go of my own hang ups so that the kids can <br/>
&gt;&gt;learn it!&gt;&gt;<br/>

regualting&quot; (still not sure what that refers to) as each issue arises.<br/>

Mary&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
If he says &quot;we might miss something,&quot; just say &quot;Like what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s something he can think of, tadaaa!  He just has to bring it up <br/>
sometimes at a good moment.  Years from now. &lt;g&gt;  You don&#39;t have any kids who <br/>
are in imminent danger of forever missing algebra or outlining or report <br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
And if anyone has kids who want to write reports, you can review books for <br/>
Amazon.  That is REAL reporting.  Or you can review DVDS after you send them <br/>
back to Netflix.  Then real people will actually read the reports and they&#39;ll <br/>
be honest real-world writing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Why does anyone need to master long division by age 18? If they don&#39;t need <br/>
it in real life, then they don&#39;t need it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids can divide in their heads.  I couldn&#39;t possibly have taught them how; <br/>
they figured it out.  I have to use paper.  I&#39;m paper-trained. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Calculators cost $5 now.  Learning to use a calculator is more useful than <br/>
paper-training to long division.  Why teach our kids stuff they would have <br/>
needed to know in 1962?  It&#39;s the 21st century, and if we&#39;ve learned anything <br/>
in our own lifetimes, it should be that WE DO NOT KNOW what facts or skills <br/>
our kids might need to know fifteen years from now.   2018.  We know Zip.<br/>
<br/>
If our kids know how to learn on their own THAT will prepare them for <br/>
whatever&#39;s happening when we&#39;re dead and gone.  Or old and retired, whichever <br/>
comes first.<br/>

Hi, Sandra --<br/>
<br/>
I know you are good at expressing ideas in &quot;educationese&quot; when needed,<br/>
so, since Keith is an engineer, can you speak &quot;engineer-ese&quot; if you have to?<br/>
<br/>
I got frustrated with my brother, the programmer, last year.  He really<br/>
seems to think that learning is something that you program into kids in<br/>
a linear fashion, one item on the checklist at a time, regardless of<br/>
interest or aptitude.  Do you suppose there&#39;s an unquestioned paradigm<br/>
like this one at the bottom of this man&#39;s thinking?<br/>
<br/>
If communication between the two parents is working, then they may be<br/>
able to work this out.  But if it isn&#39;t, then I think getting someone<br/>
non-threatening (like your husband?) to *listen* to this man&#39;s point of<br/>
view for an hour or two would be very helpful.   (Particularly helpful<br/>
in framing good counter-arguments and good compromises and maybe even<br/>
good win-win solutions.)<br/>
<br/>
If unpaid, volunteer diplomats can&#39;t negotiate a truce then a paid<br/>
professional counselor might be worth using.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it works out.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh oh oh --- I think I hear my cue!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told you all before how Roxana learned to do long division -- she <br/>
wanted to go to New York (we live in California) and was trying to <br/>
figure out how long it would take us to drive there. She asked me how <br/>
far away it was (about 3,000 miles) and how many miles we could drive <br/>
in a day (around 350) and she began subtracting 350 from 3,000 and then <br/>
350 from that and so on. She got frustrated because she realized she&#39;d <br/>
made a mistake early on and, as I walked by I said, &quot;There is an easier <br/>
way to do that.&quot; She wanted to know how and I told her she&#39;d have to <br/>
let me show her in a view steps. She said, &quot;Okay.&quot; So - I showed her 6 <br/>
divided by 2 and then 60 divided by 2 and then 64 divided by 2 and then <br/>
60 divided by 20 and so on - showed her what to do with remainders and <br/>
then said she was ready to do 3,000 divided by 350. So she did it.  <br/>
THEN - she said: &quot;WHY did you not ever show me this before? It is so <br/>
cool.&quot; I said, &quot;It is called &#39;long division,&#39;&quot; and she just couldn&#39;t <br/>
believe it: &quot;Everybody HATES long division but THIS is too cool.&quot; She <br/>
asked me to give her some more problems to work and I did. This entire <br/>
process took about 30 minutes, max. That was it - she knew how to do it <br/>
- I&#39;ve seen her use it many times since then (she&#39;s 15).<br/>
<br/>
So - a few days ago Rosie (12) said she was bored. I said, &quot;Well - what <br/>
do you want to do?&quot; &quot;Hmmm- I want to learn something new like some new <br/>
math thing or something.&quot; &quot;Like what?&quot; I asked. &quot;Like - you know that <br/>
division thing where you write all the numbers down in a list or <br/>
something?&quot; &quot;Like long division?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; So - I showed her a few <br/>
problems, starting with simple ones. She asked me to give her more <br/>
problems to work. She was interested in the remainders - in <br/>
understanding what they meant. So we looked at them as leftovers and as <br/>
fractions of groups and then I showed her how to deal with remainders <br/>
using decimals. Again - the whole thing lasted about 30 minutes. It was <br/>
fun for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
So - all three of my girls have learned long division. Check that off! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, long division is taught when kids are 9 to 10 years old, <br/>
in school. But my girls naturally seemed to want to learn it at about <br/>
12. They learned lots of other things before that - lots of statistics <br/>
ideas, for example. Also a lot about decimals and fractions. To be <br/>
honest, even though I&#39;m really interested in how kids learn math, I <br/>
can&#39;t say that I really know how or when they learned most of it.<br/>

Just <br/>
wondering. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes and she just found out Friday that she&#39;s been selected as one of three <br/>
national winners in a story-telling competition, of sorts.  Kids submitted <br/>
videotapes, and each state chose some, and Tam&#39;s one of the top three, who <br/>
will perform at a storytelling convention in northern California (I think) <br/>
later this year.<br/>
<br/>
One of her brothers said happily &quot;This wouldn&#39;t have happened if she hadn&#39;t <br/>
been a homeschooler!&quot; and her dad said quickly &quot;That&#39;s not true.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s SO resistent, it&#39;s heartbreaking for me.  Those kids are great, but all <br/>
he sees is their lack of &quot;education&quot; and grades and credits.<br/>

afraid of voicing their opinions right along with the adults. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was five, a weekly playgroup we had already been in for a few <br/>
years started evolving into a homeschooling group, as some families&#39; kids <br/>
went to school and others didn&#39;t.   Until just a couple of years ago (2.5?), <br/>
we met every week with unschoolers and interested parties.   New moms often <br/>
wanted to talk to the other moms.  I would try to get them to hang out with <br/>
the kids instead.  Some got it, some didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Some adults just ignore kids and don&#39;t want kids around, and so the idea of <br/>
kids not being articulate with adults isn&#39;t always the kids&#39; fault.  School <br/>
discourages direct and real conversations between teachers and kids after a <br/>
while, it seems.  And many families do it too.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling families where parents listen to their kids and have REAL <br/>
discussions with them regularly are creating a model that I&#39;d never seen <br/>
before, of kids who do not see themselves as separate or smaller or <br/>
secondary.  <br/>
<br/>
So I know exactly what Marjorie&#39;s talking about.<br/>
<br/>
A homeschooling group here plays Harry Potter once a week (collectible card <br/>
game tournaments) at a shop really (coincidently) close to our house.   <br/>
Holly&#39;s been going for months, and Kirby started going lately.<br/>
<br/>
A little boy of nine of ten was saying something about how he learned to read <br/>
from the games, and Kirby said &quot;You know how I learned?  Nintendo Power.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The boy&#39;s mom said, &quot;The reason we homeschool is because I read an article <br/>
about how you learned to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly told me this story. I could get closer quotes from her, maybe.  She&#39;s <br/>
got a great memory.  But Holly says Kirby said &quot;Really?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The mom was reassuring him that really, it was reading something I had <br/>
written that caused their family not only to homeschool, but to be <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby said &quot;I didn&#39;t know we did that for people!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That makes me think Kirby hasn&#39;t been paying any attention for many years. <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
More likely, he&#39;s unaware of how different his life is.  Of his friends, half <br/>
are homeschooled.  There are other kids his age who&#39;ve never been to school, <br/>
who never did school at home.  He&#39;s unaware of just how small a percentage of <br/>
the world he&#39;s in!<br/>

fact, Casey just asked if we can go to CA to see her at the conference, so <br/>
keep us posted.<br/>
<br/>
Tam made a big impression on Casey (and me!). During our ride home from your <br/>
house, Casey&#39;s sketch book filled up with detailed underwater scenes <br/>
