<div id="ygrps-yiv-425577297">Hi, just wanted to give a brief introduction. My name is Terri. I&#39;m 34, married to Mike and we have three children--Jordan is 13, Jessica is 11 and Jenna is almost 2. Originally from South Louisiana, we now live in Kansas (hence the name &quot;kscajuns&quot;). This is our first year homeschooling and what a tough one it has been! I quickly discovered that curriculum wasn&#39;t for us, so we&#39;ve been &quot;winging it&quot; ever since. (Don&#39;t know who was more burnt out in the first two months--them or me!) I&#39;ve heard the term unschooling, but it wasn&#39;t until I got onto Unschooling.com, that I realized that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve been doing since tossing the gradebook out the window. So, here I am.......I&#39;ll probably lurk for a little bit before jumping right into the conversation, so as to give me a chance to see the topics and get to know everyone a little bit. Got to say---it&#39;s nice to know that I&#39;m not alone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-441008849">Hello, Mary! You, my friend, know then that a true cajun comes from Lafayette, not New Orleans, like the popular misconception! <br/>
<br/>
My husband is from Metairie, but I spent the better part of my life in Lafayette. (1976-1991) My parents still live there and the kids and I are going down in about a week to visit them. Unlike you, though, the only thing I miss about La. is the *food*! Kansas just doesn&#39;t know a thing about spicy! Other than that, my husband and I both agree that Kansas is the best. He works for Union Pacific (before that Southern Pacific) and we&#39;ve moved quite a bit. Eight towns and four states later, we feel like we&#39;ve finally made it *home*. <br/>
<br/>
And I sure don&#39;t miss the humidity down there! People here in Kansas actually complain when the humidity here gets to 40%!! Can you imagine??<br/>
<br/>

My first &quot;date&quot; with my (now) DH, was taking his son to Taco Bell..and then<br/>
Chuckie Cheese...(we had to go back to Taco Bell, because I left my purse on a<br/>
chair....LOL....<br/>
It was awful!!!  I hated it!!<br/>
&quot;Our kids&quot; have no idea what a Chuckie Cheese is...and I think this is a<br/>
positive aspect of my parenting!  LOL<br/>
No disrespect to those that do know.....  :)<br/>
Just had to share my first date!   Ahhhh....<br/>
I know you are all jealous of mine.....   Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha<br/>
