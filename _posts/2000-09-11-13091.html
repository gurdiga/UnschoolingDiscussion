<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035506194">Hi Michelle,<br/>
     Just had to write and say that what you wrote really struck a chord with <br/>
me.  It IS crazy that we, according to our societal norms, are supposed to be <br/>
so separated in our families, not just when the kids go off to college but <br/>
starting from such a young age.  So many of the &quot;experts&quot; keep telling us <br/>
what is normal and healthy, yet our society becomes more abnormal and <br/>
unhealthy even as they go in the prescribed directions.<br/>
     It is good that many of us are finding our own better ways, healing <br/>
ourselves little by little and hopefully raising kids who are freer from the <br/>
unhealthy influences of the rat race modern world.  Maybe the example of <br/>
saner lifestyles will make more and more people question the &quot;experts&quot; and <br/>
begin to make their own lives more sane.<br/>
