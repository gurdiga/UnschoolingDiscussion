<div id="ygrps-yiv-13161189">Hey everyone, I wanted to share an article I just stumbled across.<br/>
<br/>
It brought to mind something from my childhood.<br/>
<br/>
I dropped out of highschool, because teachers thought I was a <br/>
troublemaker, when in fact I didn&#39;t want to cause trouble, I just <br/>
wanted someone to understand me.  In 8th grade I had a teacher, that <br/>
wasn&#39;t strict but kind and understanding.  When I got into a fight in <br/>
her classroom, she didn&#39;t send me to in house suspention.  She made <br/>
me spend my lunch time watching romeo and juliet in her room.  When I <br/>
told my algebra teacher to shut up, she sent me to my english <br/>
teacher, because word was she was the only one that &quot;knew how to <br/>
handle me&quot;.  My teacher made me read Moby Dick the rest of the day.<br/>
<br/>
She introduced to me a love of reading that has stayed with me to <br/>
this day, and I WOULD NEVER smart mouth or be rude to my english <br/>
teacher because she was the only kind teacher I had.  That love of <br/>
reading helped me pass my GED with flying colors (3rd best score that <br/>
year out of 516 students) and has also helped me to teach myself <br/>
various skills where I can work form home.<br/>

<br/>
that article reminded me of my old english teacher.  Mirial isn&#39;t <br/>
bad,she just needs to be intorduced to somethign that she will love <br/>
as much as I did reading.  <br/>
<br/>
And she&#39;s NOT DUMB!!!<br/>
<br/>
This is form the article:<br/>
<br/>
The highly creative individual has the ability to take dissimilar <br/>
pieces of information and join them in completely new ways. Artists <br/>
of all kinds, musicians, writers, entrepreneurs, scientists, <br/>
mathematicians, engineers, troubleshooters, and inventors all depend <br/>
on creativity. Many parents of Hunter or Edison-trait children are <br/>
quite aware that there is a large overlap between what we call ADD <br/>
and creativity, even if their children have never taken a test for <br/>
creativity. It&#39;s that obvious. <br/>
<br/>
Traits of Gifted/Creative Kids (From the National Foundation for the <br/>
Gifted and Creative) <br/>
<br/>
* High sensitivity  <br/>
<br/>
* Excessive amounts of energy. <br/>
<br/>
* Bores easily and may appear to have a short attention span. <br/>
<br/>
* Requires emotionally stable and secure adults around him/her. <br/>
<br/>
* Will resist authority if it not democratically oriented. <br/>
<br/>
* Have preferred ways of learning; particularly in reading and <br/>
mathematics. <br/>
<br/>
* May become easily frustrated because of his/her big ideas and not <br/>
having the resources or people to assist him/her in carrying these <br/>
tasks to fruition. <br/>
<br/>
* Learns from an exploratory level and resists rote memory and just <br/>
being a listener. <br/>
<br/>
* Cannot sit still unless absorbed in something of his/her own <br/>
interest. <br/>
<br/>
* Very compassionate and has many fears such as death and loss of <br/>
loved ones. <br/>
<br/>
* If they experience failure early, may give up and develop permanent <br/>
learning blocks. <br/>
<br/>
Mirial fits all those to a T!!!  <br/>
<br/>
 think I&#39;m going to be spending the rest of this week, and most of <br/>
next week, not teachign the children, but teaching me.  I need to <br/>
learn how to let them teach me how to teach them best!!!<br/>
<br/>
It just hit me, Kind of like out of the blue.  They can learn, they <br/>
will learn, but it needs to be THEM doing the learning and not me <br/>
forcing some stupid guidelines I got from the dept of education on <br/>
them. (no not require by law, just some I got form the website)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the one that needs the brain adjustment, NOT THEM.  Sorry, I know <br/>
I have read alot, but it just hit me.  Nothing is wrong with my <br/>
babies AT ALL.  What&#39;s wrong is teacher&#39;s and myself included, trying <br/>
to force something on them they aren&#39;t ready for, that they can learn <br/>
in thier own time with my guidance!!!  That&#39;s kind of like forcing <br/>
liver on them, when they would rather have chicken.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I wanted to share this wonderful article, and the light just <br/>
flickered on.  I think I finally understand what unschooling is all <br/>
about.  I was looking at it as fun teaching, when that&#39;s not all it&#39;s <br/>
about.  it&#39;s about fun teaching that the CHILDREN choose what they <br/>
want to learn, based on what they want to do at that given time!!!<br/>
<br/>
Me thinks I&#39;ll go tear down those phonics sheets now, I wasn&#39;t taught <br/>
using phonics so I don&#39;t undertsand them properly anyway.  They <br/>
confused the snot out of me, and I was trying to usethe teacher <br/>
guidelines which didn&#39;t make any sense too me, because I was like OK <br/>
this is the rule to teach today, but golly that rule doesn&#39;t apply to <br/>
alot of the bigger words they will need later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772502059">Maria,  It sounds like you are on the right track.  My son was the same way but I thought he had ADD.  My doctor said no,  he doesn&#39;t have ADD, he can focus on things.  And when he does look out!  And on the other hand if I suggest something I think he might like, NO WAY!  It really has to be his idea or nothing.  That is why unschooling worked for us.  He fits your description in the last e-mail,  he&#39;s amazing in math, computer but also can play an instrument like this(snap of finger).  <br/>
I think all of us that are just starting this process really need to just relax, relax, relax, and relax!    And not let anyone else change our thinking.  They&#39;ll all be great kids.  They&#39;ll have themselves figured out alot quicker than I did.  I know it has taken me almost 35 years!  <br/>
Take Care Maria!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, actually unschooling isn&#39;t about teaching at all. Unschooling is about <br/>
living life. It is about being in the here and now. Many start out thinking <br/>
that if they unschool their children that someday the kids will say something <br/>
like *Hey, I want to learn about algebra (or pick a school-like subject) <br/>
today* and that isn&#39;t what happens. <br/>
There are no subjects in unschooling. An average day at our house can look <br/>
like just about anything, but here are some things my kids do. Others here <br/>
can tell you about things their kids do, and they will all be different.<br/>
My son Jack spends hours on the Playstation2. That is how he learned to read <br/>
this year. He loves his gaming magazines and he would get tired of asking <br/>
someone to read it to him all the time. My dd, Moly spends hours watching <br/>
birds, she and I take early morning walks to the river so we can watch *our* <br/>
cranes. She loves Harry Potter too. She spends hours playing with her trading <br/>
cards. We play games, (tons of games) read books, the kids play on the <br/>
computer, both love to help me cook, (and I am getting over my *no one else <br/>
in the kitchen but me*  &lt;g&gt;) both kids love to ride their bikes and we have <br/>
great walking/biking trails around here. Jack does have one *lesson* he goes <br/>
to Karate three mornings a week. Both are active in scouting. Moly&#39;s Junior <br/>
Girl Scouts will start their meetings next week and she is so excited to see <br/>
all her friends. Moly has some penpalls she likes to exchange letters with. <br/>
Our days are filled with things the kids want to do and play. I have my <br/>
hobbies and interests too. Unschooling for us is our lives, everyday.<br/>

Understands that the sun, moon and stars appear in the east and set <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700617028">The so-called laws of the state are lies.  They want you to think this so you are still under their control.  There is actually nothing they can do and there are no tests that need to be taken.  Good news, huh?  :-)  aaahhhhh, the truth that freedom brings..................<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599105764">OK the GA code says I have to have an assessment report each year.  <br/>
So what I did was went to the dept of eds site, and typed up all the <br/>
things they are supposed to know and made a lil booklet for <br/>
kindergarten, first and secnod grades (I did kindergarten too because <br/>
they don&#39;t know some of those skills either).<br/>
<br/>
The way i set it up, was each skill will have a date on it when they <br/>
learned it.  If they already know it, then I put the date I checked <br/>
to see if they knew it.<br/>
<br/>
Those are my assessment reports.<br/>
<br/>
As for the test, I have to get them tested at the end of 3rd grade.  <br/>
There&#39;s no way around it, it&#39;s a required GA Code.  I would be <br/>
breaking the law if i didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I even had a social worker that came to my home to look at <br/>
my &quot;Curricullum&quot; a few weeks back.  She flat out told me I was not <br/>
qualified to teach my children.  I told her that the Board of <br/>
education says all I need is a GED and that GA law says I am and that <br/>
I graduated in the 300 club when I took my GED and was 3rd highest <br/>
score for that year out of over 500 people who took the test.  <br/>
<br/>
She then said that she would feel better if I would put Mirial in <br/>
crossroads (the &quot;Special&quot; school, where most of the children there <br/>
can&#39;t even talk) and I told her I feel better about making sure my <br/>
daughter realizes that she&#39;s not dumb, or stupid as she herself <br/>
thought she was, and that she didn&#39;t know my daughter, had never met <br/>
my daughter, so how could she tell me what&#39;s best for her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She then tells me that I&#39;m not trained to teach properly and that I <br/>
needed to either put them back in public school, or at least put <br/>
Mirial in Crossroads.  That&#39;s when I blew up and told her &quot;Lady you <br/>
KNOW NOTHING about my family.&quot;  My husband went to college to be a <br/>
teacher, He almost finished, he did all his courses and only needs <br/>
his internship to graduate.  He&#39;s more qualified to teach than the <br/>
teacher&#39;s in the system are, and he helps with the lessons as well.<br/>
<br/>
She then asked why he dropped out of college, as if it were a bad <br/>
thing, and I told her it was because his dad was put in hospice, and <br/>
later died, and that family was more important to him at the time <br/>
than college.  <br/>
<br/>
She then said, Oh that&#39;s a shame, well that&#39;s all I need to know, and <br/>
then she left.  She didn&#39;t say again I had to put Mirial in <br/>
Crossroads,  but I&#39;m living in a town where homeschooling IS NOT <br/>
acceptable.  My own family don&#39;t even support me.  My husband didn&#39;t <br/>
support me when I pulled them out of school, but He does now because <br/>
he sees they are doing much better, and are much happier, with me <br/>
teachign them.<br/>
<br/>
I brought up the unschooling issue with him earlier, this time he <br/>
didn&#39;t argue, he said he trusted my judgement, and that as long as <br/>
the children continued to improve he woul dback me all the way.<br/>
<br/>
I am just SO SICK and tired of my Mariah crying because she can&#39;t get <br/>
her lessons done right (And right now she&#39;s on first grade lessons) <br/>
and my Mirial getting frustrated because she has to sit to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I am DESPERATE here to do what&#39;s right with my children, and <br/>
unschooling is the ONLY answer I can find, but the laws here will <br/>
make it so difficult.  I even called another school in another <br/>
county, because I have heard that the teachers are terrific with ADHD <br/>
children, but they didn&#39;t have room for my girls.  <br/>
<br/>
And I told my husband this morning, that I was going to search for <br/>
another alternative, tutor or whatever it takes, before I would put <br/>
my baby in that school.  Unschooling is the only alternative I see <br/>
that I have, I just don&#39;t see how I can still adhere to the <br/>
legalities of everything with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently readin the www.unschooling.com posts, and am <br/>
understanding what unschooling is all about alot better, and seeing <br/>
so many success stories has put my mind at ease, but I can&#39;t take the <br/>
chance of them failing those tests, and being forced back into public <br/>
schools, or worse yet, Mirial being forced to go to that Crossroads.<br/>
<br/>
My Mariah, she was so withdrawn due to public schools.  Kids picking <br/>
on her, and teachers sayign she wasn&#39;t smart in front of her.<br/>
<br/>
And Mirial, worse, she had to go through a ton of evaluations I was <br/>
led to believe were in her best interest. <br/>
<br/>
I have just now gotten my girls back, where they are happy go lucky <br/>
and free again.  <br/>
<br/>
The way I saw it then, and the way I see it now, is that our school <br/>
was turnign my children into ZOMBIES.<br/>
<br/>
Now as for my oldest, she&#39;s never had that problem.  teachers adore <br/>
her, and she pretty much gets to do whatever she wants anyway, and <br/>
she loves school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, this post is turnign into a book, I&#39;m goingback to <br/>
unschooling.com and see if I can find some more info about GA rules. <br/>
I see there are some people from GA that post there, so I want to <br/>
know how they are doing it legally.<br/>
<br/>
I have decided that unschooling is just what we need.<br/>

My eldest son in a resident of Ga and was homeschooled there for a few<br/>
years. He&#39;s back in PS but his younger sibs are all homeschooled.<br/>
I strongly suggest you get in touch with an inclusive (!)homeschool group so<br/>
you can get more info on the real laws of the state rather than the ideas<br/>
you curently have. I&#39;m guessing you asked the school system about the HS<br/>
requirements of the state?<br/>
An attendance sheet needs to be sent in each quarter and in certain grade<br/>
(3, 7, 9?) they are to be tested and the results sent to you where you can<br/>
keep them locked in a drawer and never show them to anyone.<br/>
Please check again with those laws so you can stop panicking!<br/>

She then said that she would feel better if I would put Mirial in <br/>
crossroads (the &quot;Special&quot; school, where most of the children there <br/>
can&#39;t even talk) and I told her I feel better about making sure my <br/>
daughter realizes that she&#39;s not dumb, or stupid as she herself <br/>
thought she was, and that she didn&#39;t know my daughter, had never met <br/>
my daughter, so how could she tell me what&#39;s best for her.**<br/>
<br/>
Oh, man -- I do NOT think she has your daughter&#39;s best interest at<br/>
heart.  She can flap her gums at you all she wants, but you don&#39;t have<br/>
to take her advice.  I&#39;m glad she didn&#39;t intimidate you.<br/>

<br/>
OK, I understand that you have to do a 3rd Grade test in GA, but is<br/>
there any penalty for scoring badly?  In some states, like WA, test<br/>
scores are only sent to the parents, the government doesn&#39;t interefere<br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
Going to the NHEN website at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org">http://www.nhen.org</a> is one way to track<br/>
down information about your state laws.<br/>
<br/>
Some homeschooling parents, in states that have testing laws with &quot;bite&quot;<br/>
hold their kids back a year.  I know it isn&#39;t the most attractive<br/>
sounding idea, but you could register your daughter as a second grader<br/>
for two years in a row without making a big deal about it to her.  Then<br/>
she would have extra time to get ready for the &quot;third grade&quot; testing.<br/>
(Some parents would do &quot;second grade&quot; twice and then skip the kid into<br/>
&quot;fourth grade&quot;, but that&#39;s kind of an aggressive strategy, and I know<br/>
you might not be comfortable with it.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853827612">Hi, I&#39;m in Georgia.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got 2 windows open, reading here and at unschooling.com while <br/>
the family is at the park, to give me some study time so i can learn <br/>
all I can about this unschooling in quite.<br/>
<br/>
I have to go over this stuff with my husband after we put the <br/>
children to bed, because he wants to know what I&#39;m into.  He said <br/>
something about free form teaching, before he left, and he said if <br/>
unschooling is anything like that he&#39;s very happy I&#39;m looking into <br/>
it, because he always wanted to teach the children that way but was <br/>
afraid I&#39;d say no.  <br/>
<br/>
So he wants to read things and see what it&#39;s all about.  He was kind <br/>
of stunned when I said &quot;No lessons tomorrow, we&#39;re going to dosset <br/>
trails.&quot; and the children are VERY excited about that.  It&#39;s like a <br/>
mini wildlife preserve.<br/>
<br/>
OK I&#39;ll shut up, no long post this time...lol  I&#39;ll just keep reading <br/>
and trying to understand how pokeman can help a chid read...lol<br/>

My oldest boy is 7, (I suppose 2nd grade but we try not to keep up with grades) and everyone is wanting me to go get him evaluated - we&#39;re pretty sure he has ODD and possibly ADHD. We moved here almost two years ago and went through the panic mode about laws and how we could possibly unschool with them, believe me, there is always a way!!! One thing that may help you to find others in GA is go to yahoogroups and do a search on unschooling..... there are almost 300 mailing lists, and I know at least one of them is for GA people only. You can get some good help there about getting around the laws. Good luck!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435771733">My state requires these yearly meetings with the school district superintendent if you homeschool through the first option under the law. We did this last year because it was the only free option. I took in a typed list of all books looked at/read, a list of all &quot;educational&quot; movies/tv shows watched, a list of &quot;educational&quot; computer games played, a list titled &quot;unit studies&quot; of everything we&#39;d talked about/seen, a list titled &quot;field trips&quot; to places we&#39;d been, a book of mazes and word search puzzles they had completed, some small projects they had completed, and some pictures of them working on other projects. The man was VERY impressed, and said that PS students didn&#39;t cover even half that in two years! He signed off on their yearly reports and even gave them some wonderful comments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733279382">***As for the test, I have to get them tested at the end of 3rd grade.<br/>
There&#39;s no way around it, it&#39;s a required GA Code.  I would be<br/>

Just out of curiosity, what happens if your kids fail the test?  What<br/>
happens if kids in public school fail the test?  And why can&#39;t, when<br/>
she&#39;s ready for 3rd grade, why can&#39;t you hold her back a year and then<br/>
promote her to 4th grade the following year?  Skipping 3rd grade<br/>
altogether?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573859874">I am personally in a state that is the most relaxed (TX).  I don&#39;t know exactly how to handle certain situations in other states, but I do know that even in Texas I have been lied to constantly about what I can and can&#39;t do in regards to homeschooling and unschooling.  I know whatever anyone does, they need to look at the actual laws and see what they say for the state they live in.  I can guarantee that it will not be what they have been led to believe.  <br/>

  Although we&#39;re in a state that leaves us alone (MO), I&#39;ve heard from people <br/>
  on other homeschooling lists say, &quot;I *can&#39;t* unschool because of all the <br/>
  laws in my state&quot;. Question though, some states require yearly meetings <br/>
  with the superintendents (or other official) of the school district, to <br/>
  &quot;evaluate&quot; that years learning. How would someone get around that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022996005">I was wondering if anyone has run into this in state laws, where it says,&#39;it recommends testing yearly&#39;  well I know what I do with recommended!  It is out the door!!   Maybe you can e-mail your state homeschooling network.  Don&#39;t go by what the schools tell you,  they will tell you the strictest interpretation.  I found this out from other homeschoolers in our state.  <br/>
Even if you don&#39;t have homeschoolers in your town, I would think that there are some in the bigger cities that would help you.  Our state has Minnesota Homeschoolers Alliance.  Maybe they have one in Georgia?    <br/>
I know I was also very concerned about laws at first but the more I talked with other people I really felt better.  <br/>
It sounds like you are doing a great thing for your children and IMO that is what&#39;s important!  Don&#39;t let other people influence your decision, think with your heart and you&#39;ll do what&#39;s best for your daughters.<br/>
Good luck, <br/>

can still be around children their on age.<br/>

I&#39;m guessing you asked the school system about the HS<br/>

if it came off that way but I&#39;m so tired.  It&#39;s been a long battle <br/>
for Mirial, from refusing ritalin, to having a counselor visit our <br/>
home 3 times a week, and daycare 2 times a week (this is before <br/>
Mirial was in school), to the neighbors calling social workers on me <br/>
because they see my children at home all the time, to the teachers <br/>
calling social workers on me because I refused to give permission for <br/>
Mariah to be evaluated (I have my own child psychologist to eavluate <br/>
if needed)to my family telling me I&#39;m harming the kids by taking them <br/>
out of school.  When Iknow deep down in my gut, I am doing the right <br/>
thing for them both.<br/>
<br/>
And I know it would be easier if I only had Mariah to teach, I have <br/>
even had friends tell me to put mirial in crossroads so I could focus <br/>
on the &quot;Smart&quot; child when i teach.  I refuse to do that.  That&#39;s like <br/>
admitting defeat and giving up on my baby.  I just can&#39;t do that. <br/>
<br/>
OK back to my studies on Georgia legal issues.<br/>

things that they *think* the law says. The best thing to do is read your <br/>
specific state law yourself and contact a state support group if you have <br/>
questions. I don&#39;t know what state Maria lives in. So that would be the first <br/>
step. As for testing, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. How many school kids fail <br/>
those tests? What does the school do to those kids? Nothing. What can they do <br/>
to your kids? Depends on the state. But I think most, if your child doesn&#39;t <br/>
do well, they retake it the next year or something like that. So it all boils <br/>
down to what state, or country you live in.<br/>

Hi. My name is Beth and I also live in GA. I belong to an inclusive homeschooling group in the Marietta area called Lifelong Learners of GA (LLG), as does at least one other member of this list (hi Cherry!). Anyway, although we are the only unschoolers I know the homeschool laws are the same....file your intent, montly attendance forms, and every other year testing which you are by NO means required to submit to the Govt!! That&#39;s it...oh, supposedly you are to &quot;school&quot; 4.5 hours a day 180 days a year (I believe that many days). As unschoolers we are doing &quot;school&quot; (read learning) alll day long!! So don&#39;t sweat GA laws. They are actually pretty relaxed compared to many states-especially the Northeastern ones!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>crossroads (the &quot;Special&quot; school, where most of the children there<br/>
can&#39;t even talk) and I told her I feel better about making sure my<br/>
daughter realizes that she&#39;s not dumb, or stupid as she herself<br/>
thought she was, and that she didn&#39;t know my daughter, had never met<br/>
my daughter, so how could she tell me what&#39;s best for her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh this sounds sooooo familiar. I had a very similar conversation with the <br/>
school principal and Special Ed teacher on what turned out to be Conor&#39;s <br/>
very last day of school. They too wanted to put him in a special class. I <br/>
asked them if they truly thought he fit the profile of the kids put in that <br/>
class. They said no, but at least it&#39;ll be a small, quiet classroom. Right. <br/>
Where the other kids are biting and soiling themselves for attention. <br/>
:-P~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I actually asked them what their goals for him were. Were their goals to see <br/>
him reach maturity with a certain body of knowledge and a fair amount of <br/>
general skills, able to become a productive member of society? Or were their <br/>
goals to get him to sit in his seat, listen to directions, and do what he <br/>
was told when he was told? The principal actually took a breath and thought <br/>
a long time before telling me he had to do both. I told them we had <br/>
different goals for my son and left, never to return.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 13 and fine now. It was the BEST decision I have ever made.<br/>

concerns my daughters cousin. He failed every subject last year. Mostly <br/>
because he never showed up for class. He was in the 9th grade. He was <br/>
getting into trouble and finished off the year flunking and having to repeat <br/>
the year. His parents put him into some kind of juvenile detention place for <br/>
kids who get in trouble. Supposedly he came out changed for the better. When <br/>
he went to school this year, he went to sign up for 9th grade and they <br/>
didn&#39;t have him registered. His mom had to go to the school and guess <br/>
what??? They moved him on into the 10th grade anyway so he could have a <br/>
whole new start and try again to make it all right. Isn&#39;t that just the <br/>
nicest thing???<br/>

<br/>
So the real answer is, the tests don&#39;t mean anything?  If they are<br/>
promoting kids who fail the test to the next grade (I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s<br/>
what happens), then why would it matter if your child fails?  You could<br/>
still promote them!  Or, still better, I think, is to skip that grade<br/>
altogether (but I&#39;ve already said that).  Maybe I&#39;m being naive,<br/>
thinking that what applies to kids in public schools also applies to<br/>
homeschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
ARRGGHH.  I should know better, I&#39;m in California.  Pretty obvious here<br/>
that what applies to one doesn&#39;t to another.<br/>

<br/>
Conor said this to me recently after we were talking about the difference <br/>
between arithmetic and higher math thinking. He said algebra sounds like fun <br/>
and he&#39;d like to try it. I&#39;ll probably get some &quot;Key To&quot; books. The real <br/>
unschooling trick, though, is to not care if he ever opens them.<br/>
