<div id="ygrps-yiv-649757272">Well, I was almost done with this email when my power went out. I<br/>
guess God thought I wasn&#39;t frustrated enough.....he decided to throw<br/>
that into the mix. :)<br/>
<br/>
My DH and I had a sort of fight tonight and I need some help on how to<br/>
speak to him about homeschooling. He says that he is all for<br/>
homeschooling Karen and that he does not want her to go to public<br/>
school. But, I think that if I told him tomorrow that I wanted her to<br/>
go to public school, he would say that was fine as well. His biggest<br/>
problem with homeschooling has always been that he doesn&#39;t think she<br/>
will get to socialize enough with other kids. So (not only for him<br/>
but, for me and my dd as well) I joined a local homeschooling group<br/>
that meets once a week.<br/>
<br/>
Any time I mention getting together at parties or field trips that<br/>
they go on, he backs out. For example....there is a camp out in July<br/>
that is only about 1/2 hour from us (sounded like fun to me). I told<br/>
him tonight that I would like to go (even though DD is only 2) so that<br/>
we can start to get to know the local homeschoolers and he does not<br/>
want to go. His reasoning (if you can call if that) is that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go because he doesn&#39;t know anyone! I asked him how he<br/>
thought we were going to get to know anyone if we never went to these<br/>
things to get to know people?! He didn&#39;t really have an answer except<br/>
that he has only ever camped with family.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m hoping you all might be able to help me. If nothing else,<br/>
let me know that I&#39;m not the only one with a spouse who isn&#39;t as open<br/>
minded as he says he is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
Melissa</div>

<br/>
You&#39;re not the only one. :(  I swear sometimes my husband just likes to <br/>
watch my blood boiling through my skin.  If he doesn&#39;t go, I go without him. <br/>
  Sometimes, he&#39;ll finally decide to join or continue to be his anti-social <br/>
self and stay home.  He grunts and groans about unschooling, but refuses to <br/>
read or listen so I&#39;m dragging him to SC and letting him figure out  <br/>
unschooling without my help.  (I told him it was a &quot;homeschooling thing&quot;.  <br/>
Bad me. &lt;bg&gt;)  I&#39;m tired of fighting and sadly, he doesn&#39;t appear to be <br/>
interested in it unless it has griping-gas.  I just gove him a match and let <br/>
him blow off steam while I nod lovingly as if I agree.  Don&#39;t know what else <br/>
to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889539833">Melissa, <br/>
Are you sure you can&#39;t get your dh to go to the conference for just one day?  Is he in a position to take a day off for it?  One of the best things about the conference is seeing all the happy, smiling, homeschooling faces there.  It is truly amazing to see all the kids and parents.  He might feel better just seeing what it&#39;s like to have a huge group of kids that get along so well together.  That said, I also have had a hard time getting my dh to read about homeschooling.  In the beginning he did read some of the back issues of Growing Without Schooling, but since then has relied on me to make most of these decisions.  My dh has never gone to the conference either, but if yours is willing it would be a great thing.  Good Luck!  Kristin<br/>

things, and that&#39;s about it.  He never goes on field trips, to festivals, <br/>
parties, etc.  It&#39;s just not in his personality, and I don&#39;t bug him about <br/>
it.  Maybe you are mistaking his dislike for social events for a dislike of <br/>
homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first mentioned homeschooling to my husband many moons ago, (about 13 <br/>
years) his first reaction was &quot;No way, Huh-uh, never.&quot;  I gently ;o) <br/>
persuaded him into an &quot;OK, we&#39;ll try it&quot; but was happy with that, and never <br/>
pushed any more on him.  He now is very vocal about his feelings that public <br/>
school is nothing but a mill to turn out brainwashed mis-taught children.  <br/>
LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, in all the places we&#39;ve lived, in all the homeschool groups, there <br/>
has only been a few times a husband/father showed up, and they felt so out of <br/>
place with all those moms they usually didn&#39;t come back.  Just get a yes, and <br/>
go from there.  <br/>

I think that I am going to see if he might be able to take some time<br/>
off.  It&#39;s not until Aug so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem if he requests<br/>
it early enough.  I would really like him to see that there are a LOT<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  Actually, he went through intense therapy for this.  As a child, if he <br/>
was playing outside and a car DROVE by, he would run and hide so no one <br/>
would see him and stay in that position for hours at a time.  He&#39;s come a <br/>
long way.  If he has to interact with people in a business situation, he <br/>
does ok but in personal interactions, such as meeting people in a friendly <br/>
situation, he has a very hard time dealing with it.  This even extended into <br/>
his relationship with our children and he is only now feeling comfortable <br/>
when they want to hug him.  For a long time, when they tried to hug him, he <br/>
would pat them on the back and stiffen up.  I think having the kids has <br/>
brought him out more than anything.<br/>
<br/>
He is really uncomfortable about going to the SC conference because he feels <br/>
&quot;fake&quot; when he has to meet and greet.  Over the years, we&#39;ve tried small <br/>
gatherings of a few people but for some reason, the larger crowds tend to be <br/>
better for him.  We were told that in the larger crowds, he feels less of a <br/>
need to interact in a personal or emotional way.  Basically, he can meet <br/>
hundreds of people that he knows he will never see again and he is able to <br/>
deal with that.  It actually makes sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part is I am extremely outgoing and gregarious.  I talk to <br/>
anyone and everyone.  Drives him crazy! LOL  I really have to like his <br/>
therapist though...he hasn&#39;t gone since just after we were married...because <br/>
he told Chris that having me for a wife would cure him before any therapy <br/>
session.<br/>
<br/>
(Just got off the phone with him to see if he minded me writing all this <br/>
about him to people he might actually meet someday. &lt;g&gt;)  His comment on my <br/>
last sentence....&#39;because he told Chris that having me for a wife would cure <br/>
him before any therapy session&#39;......was, &quot;yeah, isn&#39;t THAT the truth!&quot;  LOL <br/>
  Not sure how heartfelt that one was. &lt;bg&gt;  We got a good laugh out of it <br/>
though!<br/>
