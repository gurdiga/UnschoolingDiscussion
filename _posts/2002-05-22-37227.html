&gt; when a new baby will have a physical need for my attention for a<br/>
&gt; while.  This post is about wanting positive ideas to help us both in<br/>

I&#39;m only perhaps slightly helpful to you, in that I have an only child, and<br/>
he plays great by himself these days.  Can I ask you to think about this,<br/>
though: what&#39;s wrong with him being bored?  He will learn, eventually, that<br/>
the baby *has* to have attention, and often cannot wait.  If you ignore his<br/>
boredom (when necessary!  not constantly, of course.), he will either learn<br/>
to ammuse himself or learn patience waiting for you to have time to play<br/>
with him.  I wouldn&#39;t consider either of those bad things!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the whining will probably be iritating at times, but if *you* decide<br/>
it&#39;s not going to bug you while you are busy with the baby, that might help.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned in an earlier post that he has all this stuff, and doesn&#39;t<br/>
play with any of it.  Have you tried moving it to different rooms?  Mine<br/>
will completely forget something exists in his room, and is thrilled to<br/>
rediscover it in a corner of the living room.  It gets constant attention<br/>
for awhile, and then ignored.  So I move it back and put something else in<br/>
the living room.  Also, have you ever tried putting some of the stuff away<br/>
in a closet for awhile?  Personally, I get overwhelmed by too much stuff and<br/>
don&#39;t deal with any of it.  Maybe your child is the same way.  I keep about<br/>
half my stuff (and my son&#39;s!) put away at any given time, and pull something<br/>
out and put something else away about once a week.  It helps limit the<br/>
clutter, too.  And you might check whether he has anything he&#39;s ready to<br/>
donate to the baby&#39;s future needs, that he no longer wants.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, when Tim whines that he&#39;s bored, I generally figure that boredom<br/>
breeds creativity, and it&#39;s probably healthy that he be bored sometimes!<br/>
That helps me deal with the &quot;gotta find him something to do&quot; feeling, and<br/>
absolves some of my guilt about ignoring the whine for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
for what it&#39;s worth...<br/>

But when we pulled just the legos out of his room and put them in the <br/>
living room, he started playing with them.  That seemed to have been a <br/>
key move, because now he will go and pull something from his room <br/>
himself and play with it.  (of course, he never puts it back unless <br/>
reminded to.)<br/>
