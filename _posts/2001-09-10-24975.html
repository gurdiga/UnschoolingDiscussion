<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176603922">Hello.  I wrote last week on Tuesday night (actually Wed, <br/>
because it was well past midnight) under the subject &quot;New to <br/>
unschooling...HELP.&quot;   I discussed my oldest son (9yrs) and his <br/>
adjustment to unschooling.  He was angry that I was not &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>
him and seemed to be vegging in front of the TV festering in his <br/>
frustrations.  Well, for the most part I let him...offered to play <br/>
games with him, took the family on a bus trip (my car is broken down) <br/>
to go bowling, visited the library, etc... Friday we spent the day <br/>
mostly at home and he barely turned the TV on at all.  He set up the <br/>
living room as a store and played with his sister for hours. Making <br/>
change with play money and all.  Do I feel good right now? Heck <br/>
yeah!!  Do I expect this to occur everyday....well, one must be <br/>
realistic.  <br/>
       Someone wrote that if everytime your child were to sit in <br/>
front of the TV you were to constantly interrupt with invitations for <br/>
him to cook with you, go for a walk, or do a craft, it is probable <br/>
that the child would see right through your motivations. My oldest <br/>
son would. My other two are the type that would jump up to join me. <br/>
All children are different. <br/>
       I don&#39;t really agree with some of your feelings that a <br/>
unschooling moms role is to constantly involve her children in <br/>
countless excursions and fun activities.  Children need to be left <br/>
alone as well. They need to use their own abilities to entertain <br/>
themselves.  Distractions and entertainment come in many forms. While <br/>
a mother who keeps her kids busy with activity is using a more <br/>
sensory approach then TV or video games it is ultimately steering <br/>
children in the mothers chosen direction.  I am definitely not saying <br/>
that you should sit around the house all day but I also don&#39;t think <br/>
that running all over the place trying to keep kids &quot;busy&quot; is the <br/>
answer.  There are a LOT of homeschooling/unschooling moms who do <br/>
this and I just don&#39;t agree...<br/>

<br/>
I agree.  Kids need time just to &quot;be&quot; and think of stuff to do.  We <br/>
do lots of things together, but they definitely spend lots of time <br/>
together doing stuff, be it TV, computer, cars, legos, playmobil, <br/>
playing pet store or pizza place, sandbox, etc etc.<br/>
