 </span></blockquote>Yup! Love your name by the way :-) We joke that we can&#39;t have any more<br/>
children. Bridget is the one and only name (of either gender) that we<br/>
both loved. We were still undecided on boy&#39;s names when I was in labor!<br/>
We went thru numerous name books and there&#39;s not a single other name we<br/>
both agree on. I guess it will be &quot;Girl #2&quot; and &quot;The Boy&quot; if we have any<br/>
more, lol! <br/>
