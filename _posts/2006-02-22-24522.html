laughing...it means tickle time for Sorscha.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Be careful with tickling.  Some people don&#39;t like it, but will endure<br/>
it to keep peace, or to have the physical touch.  She might sometimes<br/>
prefer just softer touching but not want to admit it, or not fully<br/>
realize it.  Even though it makes people laugh, tickling can be<br/>
invasive and sometimes painful.  And sometimes there IS something<br/>
that needs to be said after that deep breath or two, it just needs to<br/>
be in a gentle form.  Tickling instead of saying something might be<br/>
like changing the subject, sometimes.<br/>
++++++++++++++<br/>
Oh no, not me.....I am the (not so fond of tickling type person), When<br/>
Sorscha sees me laughing she is the one to come after me.  heehee  She is<br/>
big into wrestling and tickling.<br/>
<br/>
Good point!  I think my not liking the tickling thing comes from my sister<br/>
tickling me when we were kids.  She was bigger and would hold me down.  She<br/>
would put her knees on my elbows and my underarms were exposed.  It did not<br/>
tickle, but hurt.  Eventually, being the limber one and quite tall, I<br/>
realized that I could throw my legs up over, around her back and around the<br/>
front part of her neck.  I would take her down and almost knock the wind out<br/>
of her, giving me time to get away.  Thankfully, Dave is the wrestler in the<br/>
family and many nights the two of them (dd and daddy) have matches.  I<br/>
cannot watch, they totally freak me out.<br/>

&gt; This page is beautiful.<br/>
&gt; It was in the sigline of an e-mail from Carelia@gmail, and I like it<br/>
&gt; when I have time look at what people have in their siglines.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aw shucks. Thanks. :)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone finds dead links, can you let me know? LOL And btw the<br/>
&quot;family&quot; link goes to my family&#39;s main page and the kids have pages<br/>
linked from there (tho they are heavy on graphics and low on actual<br/>
content), and my husband has his blog, which at one time contained<br/>
quite a few unschooly posts (things the kids did or his random<br/>
observations). He edits it frequently (he&#39;s a geek boy engineer so he<br/>
loves tweaking the code and such) so I am not sure if it&#39;s working<br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m glad people are making their own sites.  These must be some of<br/>
&gt; the greatest things to show relatives who wonder if you really know<br/>
&gt; what you&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why we started making the pages. We lived in CO for 7 years<br/>
and the grandparents were in MO and CA. Then it became a hobby to do<br/>
it, regardless if anyone else looked at it! I don&#39;t do scrapbbooking<br/>
so this is my &quot;scrapbook&quot;. I love the dynamic nature of the pages,<br/>
and when I get bored with a layout, I can easily change it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the &quot;plug&quot;, Sandra! :)<br/>

We are faced with almost identical situation with our 6 year old<br/>
son.  Before trying traditional speech therapy, we are going to try<br/>
Neurofeedback: www.eegspectrum.com.  I will post later on this yahoo!<br/>
group to share the results.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi Maggie,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Newbie lurker here (and another Melissa).  Just wanted to jump in,<br/>
as I also<br/>
&gt; have a six year old son with speech/language difficulties.  You<br/>
said you<br/>
&gt; have had conversations with the boy &lt; so the problem is with his<br/>
&gt; pronunciations, not with his ability to converse or retrieve<br/>
words?  If<br/>
&gt; there is any need to help him converse and relate to people, I know<br/>
of a<br/>
&gt; wonderful home program.  Otherwise, there are Scottish Rite clinics<br/>
all over<br/>
&gt; the country that provide free or sliding-scale therapy that could<br/>
help with<br/>
&gt; speech impediments.  That way, she wouldn¹t have to deal with the<br/>
school<br/>
&gt; system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me know if you would like more info.!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I recently met a single mom who is unschooling her 6 yo son.  She<br/>
mentioned<br/>
&gt; &gt; today that she has to go through the school board for the first<br/>
year (she just<br/>
&gt; &gt; moved to Florida from Chicago) because she wants to get him<br/>
evaluated for<br/>
&gt; &gt; speech at no cost to her.  I know someone else (now also an<br/>
unschooler) who<br/>
&gt; &gt; did this and had therapy recommended for 2 of her kids.  They<br/>
hated the<br/>
&gt; &gt; therapy and she hated the therapy so they quit after a short<br/>
time.  Her kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; got over their speech issues without the therapy.  This single<br/>
mom is basing<br/>
&gt; &gt; her son&#39;s need for evaluation on two separate occasions where it<br/>
was suggested<br/>
&gt; &gt; by other people (not professionals).  I&#39;m just wondering if<br/>
anyone knows where<br/>
&gt; &gt; she can get some info/support online before she has him<br/>
evaluated.  I&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; &gt; conversations with her son and he sounds just fine to me.  I<br/>
would love to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to offer her an alternative to going through the school<br/>
board.  Thanks in<br/>
&gt; &gt; advance.<br/>

&gt;  Interestingly enough I have noticed that my DS has<br/>
&gt; recently stopped telling people he is homeschooling when they ask if<br/>
&gt; he is in kindergarten or first grade, he just says kindergarten<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has gone from saying &quot;we homeschool&quot; to saying &quot;I don&#39;t go<br/>
to school.&quot;  It usually stops other questions from coming!  If people<br/>
are receptive I explain, if it is some man chatting with us in the<br/>
frozen foods section I just smile big and change the subject!<br/>

big into wrestling and  tickling.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were much smaller, we played &quot;tickle doctor.&quot;  They would  lay <br/>
on their back or front, and I&#39;d play the part of the doctor and  <br/>
say...&quot;Hmmmmm...does this tickle?&quot; and I&#39;d tickle something like the top of  their head, or <br/>
a shoulder, or places that are not ticklish.  Part of the  &quot;game&quot; is the last <br/>
place to check, would be the most ticklish.  Then we&#39;d  start all over again.<br/>
 <br/>
I know it didn&#39;t bother my kids because they&#39;d beg to play it then we&#39;d  have <br/>
to play it over and over and over again.  My now 18 yo son loved it  the <br/>
most...and when we&#39;d play it he&#39;d have such anticipation of being tickled  that I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even get near him with out him giggling to pieces.   Thinking about <br/>
it almost brings tears to my eyes, he was so cute.  *sniffle*<br/>
