Symptoms of Inner Peace<br/>
<br/>
1.  A tendency to think and act spontaneously rather than from<br/>
fears based on past experiences.<br/>
2. An unmistakable ability to enjoy each moment.<br/>
3.  A loss of interest in judging self.<br/>
4.  A loss of interest in judging others.<br/>
5.  A loss of interest in conflict.<br/>
6.  A loss of interest in interpreting the actions of others.<br/>
7.  A loss of ability to worry.<br/>
8.  Frequent, overwhelming episodes of appreciation.<br/>
9.  Contented feelings of connectedness with others and nature.<br/>
10.  Frequent attacks of smiling through the eyes of the heart.<br/>
11.  Increasing susceptibility to love extended by others as well<br/>
as the urge to extend it.<br/>
12.  An increasing tendency to let things happen.<br/>

This provided an interesting interlude, LoveMary. More perspective...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s probably what I&#39;m doing now. Going with the flow, so to speak. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

&gt;5.  A loss of interest in conflict.<br/>
&gt;6.  A loss of interest in interpreting the actions of others.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These last three are probably what got us into this mess. I tend to <br/>
be one who sits out things like personality clashes online, waiting <br/>
for them to blow over so we can get back to whatever we were doing <br/>
before the whole mess started.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>These three (8, 9, & 10) are right on the mark. Most of you are <br/>
probably aware that my Dad suffered a paralyzing stroke the day after <br/>
the terrorist attacks, and life as our family has known it hasn&#39;t <br/>
been the same since. I&#39;ve found myself finding plenty of reasons to <br/>
rejoice through it all, though. Small things, which I probably <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have even slowed down for a year ago, or even six months <br/>
ago. I seem to be seeing many things differently these days, and it <br/>
relates to this list as a realization that I don&#39;t have time - don&#39;t <br/>
want to take the time - to plow through the agony of posts like those <br/>
we&#39;ve seen in the past few weeks. So in that respect I guess the <br/>
decision is based on my own personal selfish interests, isn&#39;t it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;12.  An increasing tendency to let things happen.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm. Depends on the things. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Thanks again for sharing that, LoveMary!<br/>
