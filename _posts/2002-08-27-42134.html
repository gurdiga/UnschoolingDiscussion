&gt; this with other forms of literature.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think there is some truth in this - but not entirely. The attitude with <br/>
which you &quot;engage&quot; matters. I&#39;m just constantly amazed at my almost 18 yo <br/>
daughter&#39;s assessment of the lyrics of songs. She&#39;s not just absorbing, hers <br/>
is not an empty head that is being filled with junk, she&#39;s listening very <br/>
critically and thinking all the time about WHY a songwriter says the things <br/>
he/she does and what does it mean about his/her life and so on. <br/>

recently. Come on over the NHEN-Legislative list --- that&#39;s where we talked <br/>
about it. That&#39;s where we talk about better and worse laws and that&#39;s where <br/>
we try to figure out how we can maintain or create homeschooling freedoms for <br/>
our children&#39;s children. Different lists for different purposes.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now THERE is a good unschooling question. I like it.<br/>
<br/>
One answer, for me, is that moral behavior isn&#39;t learned by listening to <br/>
moral music or reading only moral books, etc. I think it is learned by having <br/>
a look at immoral behavior and its consequences - in other people, in <br/>
ourselves, in books and music and movies. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT suggesting pornography or graphic violence for young kids. But, even <br/>
fairy tales are filled with evil -- I happen to think that exposure and <br/>
examining and discussing this kind of thing is an important part of moral <br/>
development. Perhaps some popular music fits that same category for some <br/>
teens and young adults. It seems to be the case for my oldest daughter.<br/>

about a song lyric that directly pertained to the unschooling discussion. <br/>

&gt; other people&#39;s kids third-rate education is ok?  Like if you don&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I LOVE to discuss the politics of unschooling/homeschooling and EVEN <br/>
schooling. I&#39;ve always been interested. In fact I do a lot of such discussion <br/>
over on the NHEN-legislative list as do a number of other people here. I <br/>
think it is fascinating and critically important to our children&#39;s children&#39;s <br/>
freedom to homeschool/unschool. <br/>
<br/>
So - please don&#39;t think that not wanting to do it here means hiding our heads <br/>
in the sand. I&#39;ve spent the last 3 years of my life extremely involved in <br/>
helping to found the National Home Education Network and one of our major <br/>
tasks has been specifically to create places for homeschoolers to get hsing <br/>
politics information and provide places to discuss and debate and network.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t think THIS is the best place for it. The list owner and the list <br/>
moderators and a number of long-time active listmembers have consistently <br/>
asked people to try to understand what this list is really for and try to <br/>
support that and not hinder it. A little off-topic chit-chat is one thing, <br/>
but consistently turning topics into anti-public school tirades is, at best, <br/>
a list-culture faux pas.<br/>
<br/>
Those who care a lot and who have very strong political opinions sometimes <br/>
seem to have a problem catching on to where and how much to go on about their <br/>
pet topic. They often think that it is their ideas that people are offended <br/>
by, when, in fact, people are offended by their going on too much and seeming <br/>
to turn every topic into the opportunity for yet another rant on their own <br/>
favorite subject. What surprises me is that they keep doing it even after it <br/>
is obvious they are either boring people or offending them -- neither of <br/>
those is going to win converts to their cause.<br/>

Ned, <br/>
<br/>
Tell is clearly about this homeschooler in Utah who was shot dead by police <br/>
just for homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Or else shut up entirely.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But what it boiled down to was exactly that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, it didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Thanks again, Mary, for your research. The story speaks for itself..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The fact that MARY did the research proves you were unwilling or unable.<br/>
<br/>
The story speaks to you having been WRONG about the cause of shooting.<br/>
