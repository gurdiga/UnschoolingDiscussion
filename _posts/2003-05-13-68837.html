&gt; of the week, he asked, &quot;what day is it?&quot;   I said, &quot;Sunday.&quot;   He said,<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;m a son.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He gave me a little gift on Mother&#39;s day and I gave him one for Son day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He tells me mom&#39;s have it rough, only one day a year, but son&#39;s do<br/>
&gt; alright with one every week.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He doesn&#39;t get a gift every week, but he gets a &quot;happy Sonday&quot;, and we<br/>
&gt; all get to smile and remember.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Father&#39;s Day, and in our family, a Beffy-Boo Day. He asked when Children&#39;s <br/>
Day was.<br/>
<br/>
Remember the response YOU got when YOU asked? I do. <br/>
<br/>
So we invented Julian Day. It&#39;s a bit different from a birthday, and that it <br/>
celebrates who he IS, rather than just his birth (existence). He usually gets <br/>
a gift that reflects him (for example, one year he got the kayak he&#39;d been <br/>
wanting and saving for), and we do something special.<br/>
