Good for you!  And I think I may be similar to you in that I may possibly<br/>
&#39;belong&#39; only on the Island of Misfit Toys.....and it&#39;s ok...really.  I am<br/>
secure in my decisions and proud of the family life dh and I have.  And SO<br/>
glad not to be so caught up in the school life!<br/>
