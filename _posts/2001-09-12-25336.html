<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think I would say something that doesn&#39;t attack the parent.  I think I <br/>
&gt; would say something like &quot;Do you know about homeschooling?  We really love <br/>
&gt; it. &quot;  Then follow up with more info if there was any interest.  In a way <br/>
&gt; that reassures the parent that there are several other options without <br/>
&gt; finding fault with the parent -- and probably just making them defensive <br/>
&gt; anyway.  I would try to offer hope and encouragement without a pinch of <br/>
&gt; judgement and superiority.  Some folks think they have found the answer -- <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s terrific.  But it&#39;s not the answer for everyone.  The only &quot;answer&quot; <br/>
&gt; for everyone, imo, is to figure it out for yourself, one situation, one <br/>
&gt; family, one child at a time.  The only &quot;movement&quot; I hope to see developing <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; one where every parent knows what all their choices are and feels confident <br/>
&gt; enough to make a conscious decision.  Whether they end up hsing or not.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

parents, whom I like and respect very much, were never really willing to <br/>
consider homeschooling...until this summer. We were talking and they said <br/>
they&#39;d be open to it. Ultimately Emily decided she&#39;d miss too much her last <br/>
couple of years of friends and acquaintances, but she really appreciated <br/>
making that decision knowing she had options.<br/>

ooze from some messages though.<br/>
