&lt;&lt; Hi,<br/>
   Writing in mirror image is very common among children, so don&#39;t worry<br/>
 about it. My daughter did this, and at some point over the past three years,<br/>
 she corrected it. She is 8 and occasionally writes backwards, but she<br/>
 recognizes it now, before she couldn&#39;t see it.<br/>
