I was reading some teen novel I picked up at my friend&#39;s house and the <br/>
character mentions that her walls are covered in her own artwork directly on the <br/>
walls...graffiti-like. Started when she was 2 and got ahold of a crayon when she <br/>
was supposed to be napping. Her parents kept it up on the wall, and allowed <br/>
her to move on from there. <br/>
<br/>
It struck me...how cool is that?! I think there was a similar article not too <br/>
long ago in HEM about parents who let their child paint on his walls, and it <br/>
was about the same graffiti-ish look...it also caught my attention. Twice here <br/>
lately...<br/>
***************************<br/>
If you go visit Orchard House, home of Louisa May Alcott, you get to see her <br/>
sister May&#39;s room. She was the model for Amy in the books, and was actually a <br/>
very successful artist.<br/>
<br/>
When she was growing up, she asked her parents&#39; permission to draw on the <br/>
walls. They said she could, as long as she did a good job. The drawings are still <br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not exactly unschooling, as they had requirements...but given the times, <br/>
pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, Bronson Alcott, crazy as he was, had lots of cool ideas about <br/>
parenting and kids. He believed kids should play, that they learned from playing, <br/>
and that girls should be educated as much as boys.<br/>

  <br/>
   And painting in closets is a wonderful idea...especially if the colors <br/>
would contrast too much with the house &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;. I read somewhere if you are <br/>
passionate about a color, to paint that color inside a cabinet or a heavily used <br/>
closet..that way it can brighten your day without compromising your home&#39;s color <br/>
scheme &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
  I had to compromise with my 7ds a bit, who wanted to paint all the wooden <br/>
walls in his bedroom , even the log wall! (gasp!), BLACK and paint stars in <br/>
flourescent glow-in-the-dark paint. <br/>
I do admire his creativity though :)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not allowed to paint the walls in our apartment, and we have <br/>
inspections and you get written up if the children have drawn on them.  So my children <br/>
have become very creative in decorating.  Emily has all the walls in her room <br/>
including the door and the closet doors covered with posters and pictures from <br/>
magazines.  You can&#39;t see any wall at all.  It took her about a year to get it <br/>
done (she&#39;s very picky about what pictures she uses.)  She still frequently <br/>
buys new posters + magazines and carefully chooses some of the pictures to hand <br/>
down to her siblings.<br/>
<br/>
Lia, JoAnn, and Paige have magazine pictures hung up on 2 walls in their <br/>
room, as well as one wall covered with old flowered sheets (all different) and <br/>
another wall done in a mosaic with construction paper.  My kids think it&#39;s really <br/>
cool that they have *designer* bedrooms for very little money.  <br/>
<br/>
Antonio  moved into the downstairs bedroom on New Year&#39;s Eve.  He decided <br/>
that 11 is too old to sleep with his 3 little sisters.  He hasn&#39;t done much <br/>
decorating yet, but I&#39;m curious to see what it&#39;ll look like in a few months.  <br/>

Ilike it because I know he will want a change after awhile.  Fabric would <br/>
allow him to change it at will. He could even hang a heavy canvas fabric and <br/>
splatter paint on..another idea he had &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>

   My dd at age 14 had wall to wall full of magazine pics and posters. Now at <br/>
16+ she has more collages of photos (of friends and family) in frames and <br/>
basketball paraphernalia and quotes. You can hardly see what color her walls are <br/>
still...there are so many.<br/>
  <br/>
  My son, years ago, made a sports collage ( basketball I think) on a very <br/>
large piece of heavy cardboard. It covered almost one width of a wall in his <br/>
small room. Now he&#39;s 21 ,and knowing we are moving soon, he asked where his <br/>
sports collage is. He wants to save it. I was a bit surprised but it IS cool and <br/>
has players that have since retired from the game.<br/>
Luckily I don&#39;t throw much out. ( a good and bad thing).&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;<br/>

helped me with all the big stuff while I did most of the detail work. The <br/>
girls have a castle mural in their bedroom, and downstairs we have a huge <br/>
ancient map of the world on one wall, complete with sea monsters and the <br/>
north wind, and then in the dress-up corner we have two floor to ceiling <br/>
theater posters, one for Swan Lake and one for the Nutcracker, with theater <br/>
lights above it (bathroom vanity lights). They&#39;re a whole lot of fun!<br/>
<br/>
We live in a split foyer, and our downstairs is one big family room. I <br/>
never thought I would love living in a split foyer, but it works really <br/>
great with kids. When they get a little older, I want to get a big fusball <br/>
table and a home theater system down there!<br/>

<br/>
This is SO important I think, that our children&#39;s rooms be THEIRS, to reflect who they are. I at one point drove my mother nuts with posters of F14 Tomcats all over the walls. Surprisingly, while she wasn&#39;t thrilled about it, nor of my goal to be a fighter pilot, she got a print from a photographer friend of hers of F14s flying by the pyramids in Egypt that he&#39;d taken from another jet. It was a really cool photo, one of the F14s looked like it was headed straight into the pyramid....ANYWAY, her giving me that, especially when overall she is highly critical of me, really meant alot. <br/>
 <br/>
When I was told by a recruiter that while women were finally being allowed to fly the F14s, my vision was a problem and laser surgery correction was not going to be accepted even if it did bring me to 20/20...my mom didn&#39;t say a word the day I threw out all my posters. <br/>

whether that&#39;s still an available thing.  It was soft wall-board stuff, the <br/>
size of a piece of drywall/sheetrock, but you could easily stick thumbtacks in <br/>
it.  It didn&#39;t smell great at first, so if you do that maybe put it up when <br/>
you&#39;re going away for a few days, or air out the room somehow for a while.   It <br/>
might have another name and it might be a defunct bit of construction material.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oh!!!  But nowadays they have same-sized sheets of insulating foam that&#39;s <br/>
white and probably doesn&#39;t stink.  They put it under roofs sometimes, so where is <br/>
Lyle?  He&#39;ll know its name.     <br/>
<br/>
Both those are about 3/4&quot; or an inch thick thick and bigger than a twin bed <br/>
mattress.  <br/>

My youngest painted her room a dark bluish purplish color called night sky.  <br/>
It&#39;s almost black when you look at it some times.  She painted stars, the <br/>
constellations, on her walls, she used the glow in the dark paint from target and <br/>
then added some glitter paint from there as well.  I remember there was some <br/>
trick as to putting the glow in the dark paint on first, or the glitter first <br/>
maybe?  But it does look cool.  The ceiling is painted the same dark color.  On <br/>
the ceiling there are the white twinkling Christmas lights, the net kind that <br/>
come on a grid type wiring. She has billowy yellow sheer curtains over them, <br/>
sometimes she has nothing over them.  She also has different glittery swirls <br/>
that you can only see when the lights are out.  Some names are on the wall <br/>
too...  a really cool bedroom. <br/>
<br/>
Of course I haven&#39;t see the FLOOR of that bedroom in YEARS but I understand <br/>
under all those clothes and special STUFF there are blue and yellow star and <br/>
moon shaped rugs and even CARPET!!!  One wouldn&#39;t know this without being told, <br/>
however.<br/>
