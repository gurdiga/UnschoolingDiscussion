<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736713865">I just had to share this, Jaiden is so excited.<br/>
<br/>
Last night when Jason was out back he found a box full of pokemon <br/>
cards on top of the dumpster and under that a bag full of Yu Gi Oh <br/>
cards. Some one was just throwing them away, they&#39;re in great <br/>
condition and Jaiden is in heaven.<br/>
