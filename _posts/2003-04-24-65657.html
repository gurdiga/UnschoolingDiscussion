<div id="ygrps-yiv-831632723">HELP!  I need some fresh ideas.  Six months ago, we moved into a new-to-us <br/>
neighborhood.  We are blessed to live right next door to my <br/>
great-grandparents, which has been wonderful for me and the kids.  However, <br/>
from what I see, there aren&#39;t many young families here.  I&#39;ve only seen a <br/>
handful of children as I&#39;m driving to and from home but have never seen any <br/>
while actually out of the car, in my lawn.  So, needless to say, my children <br/>
don&#39;t have any neighborhood friends.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always lived in this general area, so we have tried out all the area <br/>
support groups but my oldest daughter has had trouble making friends, simply <br/>
because we&#39;ve only met about 4 or 5 kids near her age and she doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
like she has &#39;clicked&#39; with any of them.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t go to church, so that avenue is out.  She has tried the rec centers <br/>
for classes and to meet new people, but generally, there aren&#39;t kids her age <br/>
in those classes either.  (Even a two year age difference can be huge at <br/>
this age..12.)  She has met a few kids her age with similar interests, but <br/>
we seem to have a hard time getting them together as they don&#39;t live nearby.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling helpless but I know there has to be something I&#39;m missing here.  <br/>
So I&#39;m wondering where your children meet friends.  Maybe it&#39;s just this <br/>
area, but it seems like everyone around here has very young children!  Have <br/>
any of you experienced this and how did/do you deal with it?  We have been <br/>
transportation-less for a while and I know that doesn&#39;t help, but we&#39;re <br/>
working on the van and that should change soon.  In the meantime, I&#39;d like <br/>
to explore other ways for my kids to meet other kids.  It sounds so simple <br/>
but it has really been a struggle for us.<br/>
<br/>
We recently discovered a neighborhood park and we plan to go a few times a <br/>
week, at different times, to see if we meet anyone that way, but otherwise <br/>
I&#39;m at a loss, so I&#39;m all ears!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you were involved with a support group maybe you could start something <br/>
that she likes to do.  Maybe a book club if she likes to read or different <br/>
craft type things if that is what she is into, I know some of the craft store <br/>
will help set up things to do like on a monthly basis.  Maybe if you started <br/>
something you could build up a network of a few friends for her.  It is more <br/>
effort.  <br/>
<br/>
I only say if you are connected with a support group because I know here the <br/>
support group is large and not everyone comes to all things, so if you start <br/>
something and post to one or two local group you may get people you never <br/>
knew about before.  Just a thought and I know it is hard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279236214">art classes, sports, summer programs like zoo sessions for kids or ecology <br/>
clubs, scouts<br/>
<br/>
Can she find a babysitting job?  Meeting people and having something to look <br/>
forward to shouldn&#39;t need to be limited to just people her age.  That will <br/>
come, but if she looks ONLY in her age range, she&#39;ll be missing most of the <br/>
people and opportunities around her.<br/>
<br/>
When she does find friends, maybe arrange overnighters more than you <br/>
ordinarly think of them. Having a kid over for two or three hours makes <br/>
driving prohibitive, but having a kid from further away over for a day or two <br/>
isn&#39;t as bad.  And my kids NEED way longer play sessions than school kids <br/>
ever get.  They have a chance to build up some long make-believe, or watch a <br/>
movie, or play a video game, or walk to the park and play, without any of <br/>
those being the ONLY thing they got to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-729396005">----- snip----- &gt; So I&#39;m wondering where your children meet friends.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Having lots of children in your neighborhood doesn&#39;t guarantee that they<br/>
will be freinds or even the type of kids you and your kids want to hang out<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the myth that kids need to go to school for socialization comes<br/>
the idea that kids need to spend LOTS of time with other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Help your kids focus on WHAT they want to do, and having friends will<br/>
probably come out of that naturally.  Plus, the friends will be people who<br/>
share interests, rather than just being the same age or living nearby.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>we seem to have a hard time getting them together as they don&#39;t live<br/>
nearby.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she does want to spend time with these people, part of your job is to<br/>
help that happen.  I don&#39;t know how you define &quot;nearby&quot;, but I assume that<br/>
you would help her get to activities that she really wanted to do.  Help her<br/>
get together with these people if she wants to spend more time with them,<br/>
either at your house or their houses or at common meeting places.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887556845">We are enrolling her in a summer skateboarding camp, and she is SO excited!  <br/>
There is a camp in California that she is aching to attend this summer, but <br/>
we feel like it is just too far away to send her at this age.  (We&#39;re in <br/>
Texas and she&#39;s 12.)<br/>
<br/>
She is really seeking out friends her age right now.  She loves being at <br/>
home, loves unschooling, but she is beginning to express a desire for ps <br/>
just to meet kids her age, which I should have added to my original post.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also become very image-oriented lately.  I really thought, dumbly, <br/>
that not being in ps would help with the clique thing but not here.  She&#39;s <br/>
very picky about who she wants to be friends with by what their <br/>
interests/looks are.  We are talking a LOT about this right now and it IS <br/>
getting better, but it is frustating for both of us.  A lot of the problem <br/>
is she is so mature for her age and many of the kids she meets that are her <br/>
age are still into &#39;baby stuff&#39; as she puts it.<br/>
<br/>
I did write this morning to one of the leaders in our support group, <br/>
requesting that she be able to attend the teen groups on a trial basis and <br/>
they have no problem with that.  (The groups are for 13 and up, so she&#39;s a <br/>
year away.)  That should make a huge difference since she was often the <br/>
oldest kid in all the activities we go to.<br/>
<br/>
She liked the idea of a game night, so we are discussing setting up a game <br/>
night here in our home since our driving ability is limited right now.  I <br/>
even got my husband to agree to take her to the skate park weekly.  She and <br/>
I both think this is an ideal situation considering everyone there has the <br/>
same interest...skateboarding!!!  She&#39;s pretty thrilled with that idea.<br/>
<br/>
We also talked about setting up a reading group at Barnes and Noble for <br/>
pre-teens/young teens.  (I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t rememeber who suggested it right <br/>
off hand, but Thanks for that idea!!)  She&#39;s reading the Harry Potter series <br/>
and SHE suggested we start the group when the new book comes out.  She&#39;s <br/>
already been on the computer to pre-order the book so she&#39;ll be prepared!<br/>
<br/>
This is GREAT!  THanks so much, everyone!<br/>

At least she doesn&#39;t have other cliques of girls telling her who she can and <br/>
can&#39;t be friends with as she would have at school.<br/>

I know it is hard, even for us adults to meet new people.  There is <br/>
something truely inspiring about watching my 4 year old walk up and <br/>
just start chatting with other kids, any other kids or adults for <br/>
that matter.  I would definitely do the park.  I found many of my own <br/>
friends there &lt;g&gt;.  It might help if you try to meet other adults who <br/>
have children that age. Family or play dates for everyone  may help <br/>
ease the tension of meeting someone new.  If there is a support group <br/>
in your area, I am sure she could find others her age.  Even, if you <br/>
could post on a local support group website in search of families <br/>
with other children her age who might be in a reasonable distance, I <br/>
am sure you would get some responses. Honestly, I just think it gets <br/>
so much harder to make friends as you get older.  Me and my <br/>
girlfriend are always joking around that it is like asking for a <br/>
date.  All the same issues: will I get rejected?  Do they already <br/>
have a full load of friends?  Etc.  Good luck and I guess it just <br/>
takes alot of time to find people that you really want to get to know <br/>
better!  Hopefully, it will be worth the wait!<br/>
