My son is &quot;highly spirited&quot; multiplied by 3. :) I love<br/>
him to death, but sometimes I wonder if he actually<br/>
could just run around in circles for 3 or 4 dayz<br/>
without stopping once. He also seems to ...be more<br/>
&quot;spirited&quot;... when he gets embarrassed about<br/>
something...like if someone notices, for example, how<br/>
&quot;much energy he has!!!&quot; or if someone gets annoyed<br/>
with him for literally bouncing off the walls, he just<br/>
does it even moreso. Not to spite, but out of<br/>
embarrassment and he &quot;can&#39;t handle it&quot; (my words) and<br/>
just acts bonkers. He gets an insomniatic (my very own<br/>
word) hair from me, and I give him &quot;sleepytime&quot; tea<br/>
(Celestial Seasonings makes it) with lots of honey,<br/>
and now he loves it and actually asks for it,<br/>
especially when he&#39;s sick. Also I got one time at the<br/>
health food store here a &quot;bar&quot; (like a candy bar..or<br/>
to him anyway) that is called &quot;Pedi-Active&quot; or<br/>
something like that, and there were little<br/>
&quot;Pedi-Active&quot; chewable pills too, that we tried. They<br/>
seemed to help somewhat, but not as much as the bar.<br/>
Who knows why. Maybe the bar had more EFA&#39;s in it.<br/>
Also my most favorite thing in the whole world (aside<br/>
from Rescue Remedy, of course, which we share) is<br/>
called &quot;Humphrey&#39;s 3&quot;...and they are &quot;teething/colic&quot;<br/>
homeopathic tablets and I gave them to ds when he<br/>
first started teething and to dd when she was a very<br/>
gas-filled cranky baby and now when they have tummy<br/>
aches or are getting restless (oh, it&#39;s also for<br/>
&quot;wakefulness&quot;), and sometimes 30 minutes before bed.<br/>
ds takes 5 now (he&#39;s a very skinny almost 6yo), and dd<br/>
still takes 3, she doesn&#39;t need more. I have taken<br/>
them sometimes, for a stomach ache and I took 7...(I<br/>
weighed about 115 at the time, to give you some idea<br/>
of dosage for you dd) and they worked immediately.<br/>
The ingredients are:<br/>
chamomila coffee belladonna and sugar.<br/>
they dissolve on the tongue and taste ...like sugar.<br/>
I get them at wal-mart or any pharmacy open...you have<br/>
to ask for them at the counter. It&#39;s about 3-5 dollars<br/>
for a bottle of 135 pellets.<br/>
Hope that helps a little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849534184">I don&#39;t think I said what I meant in my post. I agree with you. Hoeopathy is <br/>
a legitimate practice and can work wonderfully. If you do your homework <br/>
and/or use a reputable homeopath. I worry about going to a drug store and <br/>
taking something on faith just because it is &quot;natural.&quot; I&#39;m not accusing the <br/>
orignal poster of doing this, I just wanted to make the point that people <br/>
should be aware of what they are taking and what the source is.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m at work, and don&#39;t want to get caught on-line, so I often toss off <br/>
quick posts without making sure that my point is clear (or sometimes, that I <br/>
even know what my point is).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009931858">Yes, I&#39;ve looked into it, cuz I knew it was from the<br/>
nightshade family...same one as opium, actually. But<br/>
alot of homeopathic medicine is based on using a<br/>
substance in very small precise amounts that would<br/>
normally CAUSE symptoms, in order to treat them. (I<br/>
know I worded that in the most confusing way possible,<br/>
but hey, what can you do? Hopefully someone else will<br/>
get what I&#39;m saying and interpret.) One time I<br/>
accidentally gave dd more when she was little little<br/>
(accidentally meaning she was crying and crying from<br/>
teething, tired and just all out crankiness in the car<br/>
and we pulled over at a park and she got all mad and<br/>
fussy and knocked my hand when I was trying to pour<br/>
three into the other hand. Well, it was dark and I<br/>
thought I counted two of them (they&#39;re really small)<br/>
and gave them to her, and then gave her another and<br/>
she spit it out, though I couldn&#39;t find it&#39;s<br/>
gooey-ness just yet. So I gave her a new one, in my<br/>
mind totalling 3. Well, the first &quot;two&quot; were actually<br/>
3 (two of them were stuck together) and she actually<br/>
licked the spit out one back in when I gave her the<br/>
new one.)  Well, needless to say it was too many for<br/>
her little baby self at that age and it just made her<br/>
crying worse, cuz she was panicky. So I definitely<br/>
DON&#39;T recommend giving the little ones these while in<br/>
a dark van in a dark park with a screaming baby whose<br/>
arms and legs are flailing. :)In homeopathic medicine<br/>
the medicines aren&#39;t administered like herbals where<br/>
you take such and such mgs or tablets...it is very<br/>
very precise, because some of them-like belladonna are<br/>
otherwise dangerous...I don&#39;t think twice about giving<br/>
my kids humphreys, and I would choose it (and do) in a<br/>
hearbeat over giving them all the chemicals and<br/>
manmade medicines that make the pharmacutical<br/>
companies rich, and have actually been shown to be<br/>
harmful in the long run thru studies due to overuse,<br/>
etc. I don&#39;t mean to sound defensive, but I have just<br/>
heard an awful lot from M.D&#39;s and people choosing<br/>
&quot;conventional&quot; routes of health care about<br/>
&quot;endangering&quot; my children and herbs/homeopathics being<br/>
bad for them, almost constituting neglect, etc, etc,<br/>
so many times that it just automatically comes off as<br/>
defensive-ness when I explain myself. <br/>
Thankyou for posting this actually, though, cuz I<br/>
didn&#39;t specify in my post about it being precise and<br/>
just buying the already bottled and made up<br/>
&quot;humphreys&quot;, but I listed the ingredients, (but not<br/>
the dosages) and someone may have thought &quot;I&#39;ll just<br/>
make my own&quot; sort of thing and ended up with very bad<br/>
results. K, I&#39;m done. Bubye.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My son is &quot;highly spirited&quot; multiplied by 3. :) I<br/>
&gt; love<br/>
&gt; &gt; him to death, but sometimes I wonder if he<br/>
&gt; actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; could just run around in circles for 3 or 4 dayz<br/>
&gt; &gt; without stopping once. He also seems to ...be more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;spirited&quot;... when he gets embarrassed about<br/>
&gt; &gt; something...like if someone notices, for example,<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;much energy he has!!!&quot; or if someone gets annoyed<br/>
&gt; &gt; with him for literally bouncing off the walls, he<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; does it even moreso. Not to spite, but out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; embarrassment and he &quot;can&#39;t handle it&quot; (my words)<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; just acts bonkers. He gets an insomniatic (my very<br/>
&gt; own<br/>
&gt; &gt; word) hair from me, and I give him &quot;sleepytime&quot;<br/>
&gt; tea<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Celestial Seasonings makes it) with lots of<br/>
&gt; honey,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and now he loves it and actually asks for it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; especially when he&#39;s sick. Also I got one time at<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; health food store here a &quot;bar&quot; (like a candy<br/>
&gt; bar..or<br/>
&gt; &gt; to him anyway) that is called &quot;Pedi-Active&quot; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; something like that, and there were little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Pedi-Active&quot; chewable pills too, that we tried.<br/>
&gt; They<br/>
&gt; &gt; seemed to help somewhat, but not as much as the<br/>
&gt; bar.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Who knows why. Maybe the bar had more EFA&#39;s in it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also my most favorite thing in the whole world<br/>
&gt; (aside<br/>
&gt; &gt; from Rescue Remedy, of course, which we share) is<br/>
&gt; &gt; called &quot;Humphrey&#39;s 3&quot;...and they are<br/>
&gt; &quot;teething/colic&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeopathic tablets and I gave them to ds when he<br/>
&gt; &gt; first started teething and to dd when she was a<br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt; &gt; gas-filled cranky baby and now when they have<br/>
&gt; tummy<br/>
&gt; &gt; aches or are getting restless (oh, it&#39;s also for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;wakefulness&quot;), and sometimes 30 minutes before<br/>
&gt; bed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; ds takes 5 now (he&#39;s a very skinny almost 6yo),<br/>
&gt; and dd<br/>
&gt; &gt; still takes 3, she doesn&#39;t need more. I have taken<br/>
&gt; &gt; them sometimes, for a stomach ache and I took<br/>
&gt; 7...(I<br/>
&gt; &gt; weighed about 115 at the time, to give you some<br/>
&gt; idea<br/>
&gt; &gt; of dosage for you dd) and they worked immediately.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The ingredients are:<br/>
&gt; &gt; chamomila coffee belladonna and sugar.<br/>
&gt; &gt; they dissolve on the tongue and taste ...like<br/>
&gt; sugar.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I get them at wal-mart or any pharmacy open...you<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to ask for them at the counter. It&#39;s about 3-5<br/>
&gt; dollars<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a bottle of 135 pellets.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope that helps a little.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  &gt; &lt;&lt;  Dh and I did try an herbal supplement for<br/>

&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;  &gt;     May I ask what this herbal supplement was?<br/>
&gt; I do<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; not label my dd except to<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; say she is a highly spirited individual.<br/>
&gt; (that&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; understatement lol)  .<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Our concern is her inability to chill out. If<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; freaks over something she<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; cannot unlock and it escalates. We are moving<br/>
&gt; to a<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; condo from a ranch and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; am already tried of asking her to lower her<br/>
&gt; voice or<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; walk instead of skip.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Dh is going to be beside himself the first<br/>
&gt; night her<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; nose is bugging her and<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; she &quot;can&#39;t handle it&quot; &lt;------ her words and<br/>
&gt; screams.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; I use Rescue Remedy for<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; some things but not a lot. Also we tried<br/>
&gt; Valerian<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; for sleep troubles but it<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; didn&#39;t seem to help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526168374">Homeopathy is very different than conventional <br/>
medicine and uses <br/>
miniscule doeses of substances that, in their full <br/>
strength, would actually <br/>
give the person the symptoms he/she is trying to <br/>
alleviate. It&#39;s been around <br/>
for much longer than the medical approach commonly used <br/>
today in the U.S. and <br/>
is quite safe. Even those doctors who don&#39;t believe in <br/>
it don&#39;t consider the <br/>
doses dangerous, just too diluted to be effective. We <br/>
have had excellent <br/>
results with some of the homeopathic remedies and feel <br/>
much safer with these <br/>
than with the drugs in most over the counter medicine. <br/>

help you get over the illness/problem rather than just <br/>
masking symptoms.<br/>

I thought homeopathy had been &#39;invented&#39; or perhaps that&#39;s <br/>
rediscovered some time in the 19thC by some german doctor?  <br/>
Not sure about &#39;modern medicine&#39; but I think the developments <br/>
could be parallel.  Anyone any wiser?  (I know there are lots of <br/>
people wiser than me, but you know what I mean :-) )<br/>

explain myself, I swear. :) Thankyou for putting the<br/>
right words to my thoughts. I swear my mind is going<br/>
mushy. Is it possible to get all the affects of a<br/>
stoner without being stoned?<br/>
hm. <br/>
Anyone else swear by color therapy, aromatherapy<br/>
(aside from manure&lt;g&gt;), reiki, infant massage?<br/>
It would be an interesting topic to hear about, and<br/>
how you teach it to your kids....<br/>

I don&#39;t &#39;swear by&#39; anything much, but I do know that <br/>
when I make an effort to &#39;do something&#39; about any kind <br/>
of ill health, I do feel better.  I quite often use a <br/>
&#39;Louise-Hay-style&#39; affermation mantra of self-love, <br/>
this does help me get through stuff, and quicker than <br/>
other folk in the house, it seems...  I find most <br/>
&#39;alternative&#39; holistic therapies have a general benefit <br/>
simply because they&#39;re holistic.  <br/>
<br/>
I do have First Degree Reiki (though I know a Reiki <br/>
Master who doesn&#39;t separate the stages, everyone she <br/>
deals with is a Master) but haven&#39;t used it much, at <br/>
least consciously...<br/>

the original substance left, you&#39;re taking drops of pure water&quot;.  Pretty safe.<br/>

The accusation of neglect comes not from worries about safety of homeopathy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361770623">precisely. The same way the accusation of neglect<br/>
comes when you tell someone you unschool. Not trusting<br/>
that as a parent you&#39;ve made an informed choice, and<br/>
believing you once you&#39;ve explained your<br/>
self-education on the subject. Concern is nice. It&#39;s<br/>
loving as another human. But we all can&#39;t agree on<br/>
everything. From education to whether it&#39;s worth it to<br/>
buy filtered water, to whether we should vaccinate or<br/>
not...all we can do is accept which &quot;risks&quot; are the<br/>
ones worth taking. I prefer the risk of giving the<br/>
kids pure water. Seems to work, whatever it is. :)<br/>
