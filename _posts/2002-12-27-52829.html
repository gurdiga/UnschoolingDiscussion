<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131150146">I remember when I was pregnant with baby #2, I worked in a downtown drug <br/>
store.  A local Drs wife came in to pick up some RXs.  She was talking to me <br/>
about having a new baby.  The pharmacist ( a lady) said, Mrs, Riley, you have <br/>
4 children, how did you manage, maybe you have some advice.   Mrs Riley <br/>
shrugged and said, &quot;One child takes up all your time, its not like you have <br/>
more time with fewer children&quot;  I have never forgotten that comment.  And its <br/>
sooo true.  Thats why parents with fewer children can not understand how <br/>
larger families manage.  Because thier one ( or two) children take up all of <br/>
thier time, they cant imagine having more because they would have no time for <br/>
them.  They dont understand that you just fit all of your children in the <br/>
same time, and you find more creative ways to manage your time.   <br/>
<br/>
Another wise comment I have never forgotten was made by my Grandma, a mother <br/>
of 7.   She said a lot of folks would ask how they managed financially with <br/>
such a large family, it must be awful to have to feed that many children.  <br/>
Grandma observed that in her chicken pen, the hen with one or two chicks was <br/>
&quot;scratching just as hard&quot; for food as the hen with a dozen chicks.    <br/>
