<br/>
I tried to reconsider, given the &quot;for kids old enough to cook&quot; stipulation.<br/>
&quot;Old enough to cook&quot; comes at different ages for different kids.  I sometimes <br/>
offer to cook for Kirby if he&#39;s got to go to work and the situation in the <br/>
past halfday or so before that was not food-filled.  He&#39;s 17, but I&#39;d rather him <br/>
go to work feeling fed and loved than to go feelng like he&#39;s old enough to <br/>
cook but has a mother who&#39;s not a short-order cook.   So yes, if the kids are <br/>
perfectly capable and not in a hurry to go anywhere, requests for elaborate <br/>
breakfasts don&#39;t seem totally reasonable, but an offer to make bacon (on my part) <br/>
is ony a favor for Marty, because neither Kirby nor Holly likes it.  And  <br/>
Holly and Marty like oatmeal, but Kirby and Keith don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather make oatmeal and bacon and eggs and let people eat what they want <br/>
than make one of them and tell the rest to go hungry or make their own.<br/>
<br/>
And the older they get the  more often they offer to make me something, or to <br/>
help, and it&#39;s good that way.<br/>

<br/>
I have one very sweet memory of being sick for a few days.  When I felt <br/>
better, I hadn&#39;t eaten in a few days and my dad asked me what he could <br/>
make for me.  All I wanted was chili with cheese and onions.  My dad <br/>
said we didn&#39;t have any but he was on the way to the store to get me <br/>
what I wanted.  He came back with five or six different types of chili, <br/>
which one did I want specifically? <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I guess by some people&#39;s standards, 3 of my kids are old enough to get<br/>
their own breakfast. They are 18, 9, 8 and 3. The 18 year old isn&#39;t really<br/>
here to eat and she does make a lunch for herself if she&#39;s at school or work<br/>
and cooks herself something to eat most times before work. But, when she is<br/>
home and wants pancakes, I gladly make them for her. And if I see the time<br/>
before work to fix something for her, I do that too.<br/>
<br/>
The other 3 hardly ever eat the same thing for breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br/>
(I mean from each other) I almost always make them what they want to eat.<br/>
That sometimes means 3 separate (thanks Sandra) meals plus what my husband<br/>
and I eat. It&#39;s not a big deal. I see now how fast Tara has grown and gone<br/>
along her own way, even if she&#39;s still in this house. The other ones will be<br/>
there soon enough. I want them to remember the special things I do for them.<br/>
They don&#39;t take advantage and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m waiting on them. It<br/>
feels like nurturing to me. It feels like what I like and want to do. It<br/>
feels like love.<br/>

There are phrases that go with ideas and justifications and thoughts, and the <br/>

<br/>
This has been suggested already by myself and others, but I just wanted to<br/>
throw it out there again because this conversation seems to be reducing to<br/>
an either/ or kind of thing. Both/and is a much better goal than either/or<br/>
in my opinion, so fwiw...<br/>
<br/>
It really is very easy to double a recipe of waffles/ pancakes/ grits/ etc.<br/>
to have on hand to heat up or to take a little bit of time one day to make<br/>
up a huge batch to be able to pull out. This way mom doesn&#39;t have to make<br/>
several meals from scratch and the kids still get what they are hungry for<br/>
at that particular meal or at least a couple of different choices. This is<br/>
what saves our meals--breakfast and dinner. I started doing this for dinner<br/>
as well so that I always have a batch of rice and pasta to heat up for those<br/>
who don&#39;t feel like eating what I made that night--much more peace and peace<br/>
of mind for all of us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-162394902">This made me think of the way housework had been getting done in my house <br/>
recently.  I never gave my ds chores, but when I tell him that the clutter is <br/>
making me unhappy and ask if he can help me with it he often cheerfully pitches <br/>
in to tame the mess.  I have almost always cooked him separte meals from what <br/>
me husband and I eat.  Give and take.  Making someone you love happy because it <br/>
makes tham happy (and you too).  <br/>

<br/>
I tend to be more at the Joylyn end of the continuum.  I do lots and lots of<br/>
things to help my kids and to make them happy.  But cooking 7 different<br/>
meals isn&#39;t one of them.<br/>
<br/>
I try to have at least one thing that I know each person likes at the meals.<br/>
Other than that you are welcome to make a sandwich or something.....but I&#39;m<br/>
not doing it for you on a regular basis.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I have a nine year old and a five year old.  Unless I really wanted to<br/>
&gt; be a short order cook, I wouldn&#39;t make three different breakfasts every<br/>
&gt; day for kids old enough to cook.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well I guess by some people&#39;s standards, 3 of my kids are old enough to<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; their own breakfast. They are 18, 9, 8 and 3. The 18 year old isn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; here to eat and she does make a lunch for herself if she&#39;s at school or<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; and cooks herself something to eat most times before work. But, when she<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; home and wants pancakes, I gladly make them for her. And if I see the time<br/>
&gt; before work to fix something for her, I do that too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other 3 hardly ever eat the same thing for breakfast, lunch and<br/>
dinner.<br/>
&gt; (I mean from each other) I almost always make them what they want to eat.<br/>
&gt; That sometimes means 3 separate (thanks Sandra) meals plus what my husband<br/>
&gt; and I eat. It&#39;s not a big deal. I see now how fast Tara has grown and gone<br/>
&gt; along her own way, even if she&#39;s still in this house. The other ones will<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; there soon enough. I want them to remember the special things I do for<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; They don&#39;t take advantage and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m waiting on them. It<br/>
&gt; feels like nurturing to me. It feels like what I like and want to do. It<br/>
&gt; feels like love.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Neither is &quot;100 different breakfasts.&quot; &lt;G&gt; Two kids - the adults can <br/>
eat what at least one of the kids wants, so you&#39;re talking about only <br/>
two different possible choices. If one wants eggs and the other wants <br/>
oatmeal, that&#39;s not such a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re short of time because of your schedule, so it seems fair to me <br/>
to say that directly and openly to the kids, &quot;I&#39;d rather spend my <br/>
limited time with you doing other things than fixing each person <br/>
different foods.&quot; And they probably get that already and without you <br/>
even having to specifically say it. AND your kids probably really get <br/>
satisfaction out of fixing their own foods - they like that feeling of <br/>
competence and capability.<br/>
<br/>
But that is really different than the &quot;I&#39;m not a short-order cook,&quot; <br/>
attitude that Sandra is talking about - that is a resentful attitude <br/>
that conveys the message to the kids that they are just a bunch of work <br/>
and trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m like Joylyn in that fixing food just isn&#39;t high on my list of fun <br/>
ways to spend my time - I try really hard to remember that it is a way <br/>
of showing my love for my family, but .... I&#39;m always fighting my <br/>
natural inclination to want to just throw a loaf of bread and a jar of <br/>
peanut butter on the table and say, &quot;Have at it!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We keep lots of frozen foods around - Stouffers Mac and Cheese, pot <br/>
pies, lasagna, frozen pizzas, hot pockets, and stuff like that. We have <br/>
string cheese and crackers. Cereal. Popcorn. We have lunch meats and <br/>
sliced cheese and bagels and cream cheese and celery and peanut butter. <br/>
Lots of left-overs.  Lots of fruit. Everybody pretty much eats whatever <br/>
they fix for themselves throughout the day - somebody usually manages <br/>
to fix something to share with everybody else for dinner. I don&#39;t take <br/>
full responsibility even for dinner, anymore, because I&#39;m too busy with <br/>
kids getting to and from activities and I teach college in the evening <br/>
and so on. I shop but then leave instructions with somebody else to get <br/>
something made - spaghetti, etc. I marinate meat of some kind and then <br/>
my husband barbeques it while I&#39;m gone and we eat in shifts. We eat at <br/>
Subway a lot, because it is relatively inexpensive and healthy. We eat <br/>
at Souplantation (Sweet Tomatoes) and Fresh Choice (much better prices <br/>
for kids).<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 19, 16, and 13, so it is way harder to all eat at the same <br/>
time anymore. I&#39;m glad we do eat together a couple of times a week and <br/>
will try, during this coming summer, to make that happen more often <br/>
since it could be the last summer before my oldest moves out - who <br/>
knows if it&#39;ll be permanent or not - but could be.<br/>
