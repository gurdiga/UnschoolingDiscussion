<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125364435">&lt;&lt;Seeing the name of your dd Tacy reminded me of the Tacy from the &quot;Betsy, Tacy, Tib&quot; children&#39;s book series by Maud Hart Lovelace.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bar none, these were my favorite books to read to my daughters when they were little. They truly capture what it is (was?) like to be a child and my girls sat mesmerized as we read. Someday I&#39;ll get to read them to my grandchildren....  <br/>
<br/>
It makes me ache to think how different society is today than it was then. <br/>
