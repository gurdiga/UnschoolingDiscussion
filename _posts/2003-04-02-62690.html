&lt;&lt; Then there was a part on constructing funeral pyres <br/>
effectively like in ancient times &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
An elderly friend of mine died a couple of years ago.  She was cremated on <br/>
her own land, near Boulder, by friends who researched and built an open <br/>
funeral pyre.   I wasn&#39;t there, but I&#39;ve been told stories.   I might have <br/>
something in writing, so when the time comes if you haven&#39;t found enough <br/>
information, write to me on the side.<br/>
<br/>
They had a permit and advisement.  <br/>
<br/>
I live where we&#39;re not supposed to burn trash, but I grew up where we WERE <br/>
supposed to burn trash and just take the ashes to the dump, so we had a trash <br/>
barrel and it was my job to do that.  Fire has always been fun and <br/>
fascinating for me, so I would arrange elaborate trash-sculptures with <br/>
cardboard-tube vents and the wet exciting stuff or chemical stuff down low in <br/>
the middle, and light it just so.  <br/>
<br/>
Once, kinda without thinking, after I lived in Albuquerque, I lit a 55 gallon <br/>
trash barrel thinking it would just burn quickly and I wouldn&#39;t get in <br/>
trouble.  <br/>
<br/>
Very bad.  <br/>
<br/>
Where I grew up on 2.5 acres and farming/rural, dogs went to crap <br/>
wherever---at the ditch, in the neighbor&#39;s orchard, on an already existing <br/>
pile of horse shit.   Nobody picked that stuff up.  It was part of the <br/>
ground.   In Albuquerque we pick it up and we don&#39;t burn it.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
This BARREL with various things including probably at least a cubic foot of <br/>
dog poo, started to smoulder.  Not flame, just kind of cook.  And it made <br/>
horrid smoke which was blowing RIGHT into my neighbor&#39;s back yard, where my <br/>
neighbor who is in her 60&#39;s and not very fun was working.  AND she has had <br/>
two house fires in her life and so doesn&#39;t even like the fact that we have <br/>
and use a fireplace next door to her.   <br/>
<br/>
Very bad.  <br/>
<br/>
I kinda casually put dirt in the barrel until the fire went out.<br/>
<br/>
So when my husband finally took that to the dump, it was dirt and baked <br/>
doodoo.<br/>
<br/>
And so if you do cremate your cat, consider where the aroma of burning fur  <br/>
might waft.<br/>
<br/>
We have a cat graveyard at our house, and a friend has brought two of her <br/>
cats because she lives in an apartment.<br/>

prevailing winds. This whole thread makes me giggle!!!!!!!<br/>
