Kelly, I am irascibly Irish, and I LOVE a chance to get back at people<br/>
who try to treat me condescendingly.  Now, granted, I DON&#39;T recommend<br/>
doing what I do.  I just DO it!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have had very few encounters with anyone judgemental.  Texas is a very<br/>
friendly state toward homeschoolers.  But I usually take the offensive,<br/>
smile condescendingly, and say to them, &quot;Oh, homeschooling isn&#39;t like<br/>
THAT.  Children are free to focus more on learning, not just some simple<br/>
regimented schedule.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-260709017">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am have been homeschooling my 2 kids(ages 6 & 8), for almost 2 years<br/>
now.  We are unschooling, actually.  We took my ds&#39;s best friend(who is<br/>
also my SO&#39;s son, being raised by his mother-so he is family), shopping<br/>
for school supplies today, as he was at our home visiting for his last 2<br/>
days of summer vacation, and starts school tommorrow, I offered to take<br/>
him to get supplies.  He starts 3rd grade tommorrow.  So, I am at the<br/>
store shopping with the 3 kids and I run into an acquaintance.  Well,<br/>
this woman, who&#39;s children are all grown and live in another state, and<br/>
is here studying at the local university to become a grade school<br/>
teacher, comes over to say hello and asks us if we are getting ready to<br/>
start school.  I&#39;ve told her we are hs, before, but she must&#39;ve forgot,<br/>
but I just casually said &quot;we are homeschooling we are here buying<br/>
_______ his school supplies.&quot;  She then says to me, &quot;who is<br/>
homeschooling your kids?&quot;  I literally did not understand her question,<br/>
and for a second thought maybe she didn&#39;t know what hs is(obviously<br/>
not).  She asked me again, and says &quot;who&#39;s hs your kids, you?&quot;, as if<br/>
this is such a surprise, I tell her yes, and she says &quot;oh, you are very<br/>
brave&quot; or some such comment.  She then asks, &quot;and what time does school<br/>
start for you tommorrow?&quot;.  This all happened in a matter of a minute or<br/>
so, of course, but I was very confused.  I thought she was asking what<br/>
time, ds&#39;s friend went to school tommorrow, and perhaps she had assumed<br/>
he lived with us????  But, no, she meant what time to we get up and<br/>
begin hs everyday!?  I was so caught off guard and confused by her line<br/>
of questioning and it really annoys me.  THis happened over an hour ago,<br/>
but I am just really irritated by this and was wondering how some of you<br/>
others out there feel about these sorts of encounters, if it happens to<br/>
you, and how you deal with other people&#39;s ignorance and judgemental<br/>
attitudes?  <br/>
	My answer to her was(with a smile - she had no idea I was insulted and<br/>
uncomfortable with noisiness and intrusive line of questioning; only<br/>
sort of confused), &quot;oh, we hs everyday of the year, all day, every<br/>
day&quot;.  That one shut her right up, although I must say she did look<br/>
baffled, haha!<br/>
	I am feeling sort of alone right now as I don&#39;t know any other hs&#39;ers,<br/>
locally.  <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

LOL! This is the best answer you could&#39;ve come up with , Kelley!  I hope that <br/>
I have the precense of mind to remember it the next time I&#39;m in that <br/>

Hi and welcome.  It sounds to me like you handled that like a pro!  Any <br/>
questions I get, I assume are because people are interested, I answer in that <br/>
vein, if I discover that the questions are sarcastic or trying to be ugly, <br/>
and I have to say I have only come across one of those, everyone else is very <br/>
interested, I just stop talking and walk away.  Those people are only trying <br/>
to cause trouble, not really interested, so I say I really don&#39;t have time to <br/>
go into all the many facets of homeschooling, but there is a great website <br/>
for homeschooling and there is the local support group that has a great deal <br/>
of info.  Then walk .  I am not defending myself, or trying to change <br/>
anyone&#39;s mind, but I am willing to answer any one who is interested.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>            I can relate to this sort of encounter.I live in a small town<br/>
where there are few hs&#39;ers.Many people know me and know I hs my 2 children<br/>
(8 & 10) They either &#39;forget&#39; or choose not to bring up the<br/>
subject.Sometimes I&#39;m not sure. I try not to let it get to me, but sometimes<br/>
it just seems so dis honest. The other thing is; I know a few parents from<br/>
our ex school who now completely ignore me, even though my son plays hockey<br/>
for their school team! Yes it is amazing ,mostly I laugh but sometimes it<br/>
hurts. You are not alone Also I would like to have the quick and clever<br/>
response to &#39;those &#39; questions. Always Learning!</div>

<br/>
it is really terrible when people start questioning about school. worse is<br/>
when they start testing your kid. but for some reason isaac really likes<br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
I just tell them that there are other ways of learning besides school. but<br/>
these people do throw us off target. so try to relax and not let her get to<br/>
you<br/>

in some states parents are required to have &quot;qualifications&quot; to hs--ged, <br/>
college degree, not sure what else...<br/>
anyway it&#39;s all crap!  we have our kids&#39; best interests... we know how our <br/>
kids&#39; learn... what excites them...how to raise AND teach them..and that&#39;s <br/>
enough qualification for me!<br/>
