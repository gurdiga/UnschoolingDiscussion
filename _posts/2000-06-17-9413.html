<div id="ygrps-yiv-915400469">Just a quick note -  Thank you everyone for the websites on the slings.  I am <br/>
on my way to put little ones down for a nap, but I can&#39;t wait to check out <br/>
the sites.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to do the chariety sling donations to local hosiptals.  I think <br/>
that is such a great idea.  Sorry to keep harping on it, but I am sooooo <br/>
excited at the idea!<br/>
