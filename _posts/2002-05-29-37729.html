&lt;&lt; I found one nearby, A link fairy sent one to my inbox.<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to go! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions for drive-in movies from someone who has been to many:<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the time of year, <br/>
mosquito repellant<br/>
fly swatter<br/>
water<br/>
paper towels for spills<br/>
toilet paper for... you might not like theirs or everyone else might have <br/>
liked theirs too much<br/>
<br/>
blankets<br/>
Pillow for kids to sit on if they&#39;re too short to see<br/>
<br/>
Windex because even if you just washed your car, birds and bats won&#39;t care.  <br/>
In our town, Drive-ins attracted bats.  There&#39;s food and people attracting <br/>
bugs, and there are hidey places.<br/>
<br/>
You might not have the mosquito problem, but ours was right by the Rio <br/>
Grande, and they would start the movie just as it got dark, so it was prime <br/>
place and time for mosquitos.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you first get there, you end up parking on a little hill.  Check twice <br/>
whether you can see the whole screen from all points in the car.  And make <br/>
sure your speaker works.  And if it&#39;s winter and you have a heater on the <br/>
pole, see if that works.  Never in the history of mankind has any theatre  <br/>
had ALL those things work at once past the opening night, because drivers <br/>
forget and pull out with one in the window and it messes the wiring (or <br/>
completely disconnects it).<br/>
<br/>
If you bring your own pizza and popcorn, you won&#39;t have to go to the <br/>
concession stand.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t park too close to drunks.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all my best advice. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of weeks ago I was telling Holly where the drive-ins used to be <br/>
here.  Of the three lots in which I&#39;ve been to drive-ins in Albuquerque, one <br/>
is a Walmart, one is trailer-house sales, and the other is a sports stadium.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yours still use the speakers??? Wow.  Ours are all radio broadcast <br/>
now.  Some of them still have the speakers and a few of the speakers <br/>
still work, but no one uses them, or at least not very often, because <br/>
the sound quality is crap!  I personally recommend a trip to Radio <br/>
Shack for a good quality battery operated receiver.  Ours both have <br/>
all the shortwave bands too, which is an experience in and of itself <br/>
but they also have the FM band which is what the drive-ins use and <br/>
they have reasonably decent speakers.<br/>

No, we don&#39;t have any drive-ins anymore.<br/>
<br/>
A church here uses radio for its nativity drive-by.<br/>
<br/>
I thought she was going to go to an old-time drive in!<br/>

So you ARE a radio geek!  <br/>
