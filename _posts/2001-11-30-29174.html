<div id="ygrps-yiv-999725935">&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t see anyone FORCING a therapist&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say it was actually being done, I said it was being discussed.  It<br/>
was a suggestion from someone, I don&#39;t remember who.  To paraphrase...if it<br/>
was a medical problem I would make the kid go to the doctor, why is it<br/>
different with a therapist?<br/>
<br/>
That is what I was referring to.<br/>
