&lt;&lt; All things are not glorious in America but it&#39;s sure better than any other <br/>

not.  And if it is true, isn;&#39;t it my job to start the difference now?  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I have to Amen this one.  I do love America, and think that it is the best <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder why people need to see their own country as *the best*.  I can <br/>
understand being proud of the country you live in, if you truly are.  I&#39;m <br/>
proud of my adopted country, even with all its warts, but I really don&#39;t <br/>
need it to be *the best*.  It kind of reminds me of the old school spirit <br/>
nonsense.  If they could get us to have lots of school spirit, maybe we <br/>
would forget about all the cr*p we had to deal with there.  Needless to <br/>
say, it didn&#39;t work with me, even the year I played in the marching band.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help but see the connection between the huge fights that  sometimes <br/>
take place between students at neighbouring high schools, and the wars <br/>
between nations that each think theirs is *the best* country.<br/>
<br/>
And I really hope you don&#39;t think your vote is going to make your country <br/>
perfect.  Could be yours will be one of the ones that doesn&#39;t get counted <br/>
when someone wants to buy an election.  Sorry to be so cynical, but I grew <br/>
up there.<br/>
