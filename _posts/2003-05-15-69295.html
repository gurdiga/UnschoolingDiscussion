<div id="ygrps-yiv-673673831">Sandra~You made some good points here that hit so close to my heart.  I agonize over every abusive news story and just get sooo sick.  But I finally came to the point too that I have to provide a safe, happy, peaceful environment for my own children.  My sister is a speech path in the public school system for at risk preschoolers.  The things she has to deal with just make us cry.  At first we talked about how we would bring this one home or call DCFS on that one but eventually she just learned to do what she could when she was with each one.  On Monday mornings they don&#39;t do too much therapy because they are running around trying to feed these little ones.  Many do NOT eat from Friday lunch until they get to school on Monday morn.  Parents are too out of it to deal with major things like dinner for the 4 year old.  They have children there that deal with much worse than a few missed meals...<br/>
So we try to live a better way and our children can BE a better way.<br/>
Guess there is no answer...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Has anyone told a story on this list this week of a current injustice?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;There are enough child abuse cases in the news THIS WEEK to make us all sick <br/>
&gt;and suicidal.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If we all immerse ourselves in that awareness and outrage and injustice and <br/>
resolve to DO something to save all those children right now, today, will we <br/>
solve it?  Will we change their parent&#39;s attitudes?  Would we even get them <br/>
all out of their homes?  And if we did, would that be a improvement?  What <br/>
foster homes would they end up in?  What damage would the violent parents do <br/>
to each other or other children and blame it on us for disrupting their <br/>
homes?  How many of us would be so sickened with the details that we would <br/>
ourselves drink or become suicidal?<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, who would be home being warm and kind to OUR children?<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t believe that I can stop all child abuse, does that mean I don&#39;t <br/>
care about it at all?<br/>
It means I KNOW (not think) that it has gone on in all ages and will probably <br/>
go on to some degree among the frustrated and ignorant and abused-themselves <br/>
for all time.  I can&#39;t stop it.  Nobody here can stop it.<br/>
<br/>
Can we give our OWN children a peaceful, safe place?  <br/>
<br/>
Not if we dedicate the totality of our time and energy to child abuse issues, <br/>
we can&#39;t.  Then we just bring child abuse into our homes daily and <br/>
perpetually.<br/>
<br/>
IS there a better way?<br/>
Isn&#39;t living a better way BEING a better way?<br/>
<br/>
If a family is not racist or sexist is their home a better place than the <br/>
racism and sexism outside?  How many hours a day can they discuss racism and <br/>
sexism without just living in its shadow, and bringing hopelessness and <br/>
damage into their own souls?<br/>
<br/>
What is peace good for if nobody HAS any?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196785731">I wrote a response earlier to a post by Sandra before I read the one below.  I don&#39;t think Sandra meant, and I certainly did not, that we should just hide in our homeschools and not do anything.  But I did agree that if we bring ALL of the world&#39;s evils into our homes, then OUR children will not have a chance to live in a happy, healthy environment.  This is not to say that we don&#39;t do our share of public service...donations, Christmas baskets, supporting programs, etc.  My sister works in the heart of the sadness every day and she makes calls to DCFS and hears things like &quot;we are too busy, don&#39;t call us unless it is more serious.&quot;  Children not eating all weekend (and worse) aren&#39;t serious enough. And I agree with you, it&#39;s not black and white and if we help one or two or more than it will help the world in general.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I understand what you are saying, that if we immerse ourselves in negativity, that it could take something away &gt;from our own peacefulness and take peacefulness away from our children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also know that I can&#39;t save everyone.  I can&#39;t help everyone.  We can&#39;t rid ourselves of child abuse.  It won&#39;t happen.  <br/>
<br/>
Does that mean we shouldn&#39;t *try*???  Does that mean we shouldn&#39;t just help even one person?  What about the handful of children that *do* have better lives because someone did something?<br/>
<br/>
Surely there has to be a balance, even as imperfect as our results might be.<br/>

<br/>
 &gt;But if we all sit happy fat and sassy in our own private &gt;unschooling worlds <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s sure to continue and to more than likely become more rampant.  At some <br/>
point our precious children will enter this &quot;real&quot; world whether it&#39;s to go <br/>
to the corner store, or to go to college or to just get a job.  Wonder how we <br/>
would feel if some sicko person did something dreadful to one of our <br/>
children?  Said sicko had some marvelous neighbors, neighbors KNEW said <br/>
person was really really sick but it really wasn&#39;t their business and they <br/>
couldn&#39;t solve the worlds ills so they just shut their blinds and went about <br/>
their business, what then?<br/>
<br/>
We can help one child at a time, one person at a time.  We can be loving <br/>
parents and give our children a wonderful upbringing and STILL have time to <br/>
help those who need help along the way.<br/>
<br/>
If only one child is spared the suffering the is oft times described in the <br/>
news media isn&#39;t it worth that one child&#39;s life to CARE?<br/>
<br/>
We cannot sit in our peaceful little worlds and ignore the pain and suffering <br/>
happening right outside our doorsteps.  Nor do we have to turn our backs on <br/>
our children and families to make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not one or the other, it&#39;s not black or white, BOTH can coexist at the <br/>
same time.  Perfectly peaceful unschooling families that care about others <br/>
and their plight or situation or other humans in the world.<br/>
<br/>
We do what we can, what we do comes back three fold, I believe that, turn a <br/>
blind eye and you loose sight of all humanity.<br/>

all at once but maybe one less child will go to bed hungry or one less child <br/>

The thing is, I don&#39;t really keep track.  It&#39;s just who I am and it&#39;s how<br/>
our family operates.  We step in and help because we like people and can&#39;t<br/>
help but see ourselves in the need of others.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve taken people in, helped stressed parents find kinder ways of dealing<br/>
with their children, advocated for folks with social services, protested and<br/>
so on.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot think of one event that wasn&#39;t best handled with kindness, patience<br/>
and sometimes humor.  I&#39;m better motivated by compassion than fury.  I think<br/>
the biggest changes come from individuals laying it on the line when they<br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
No one is naive enough to say racism doesn&#39;t exist, it does, it always has,<br/>
it probably always will. As long as people are running the show the same<br/>
problems will manifest themselves.  The best I can do for my kids is show<br/>
them how it should be.<br/>

<br/>
That is wonderful and if lots more people in the world did this it would help <br/>
even more (and I&#39;m not talking about the &quot;people&quot; here, just people in <br/>
general in the world).<br/>
<br/>
Just doing what we can, when we can.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are many lives you don&#39;t even realize that you&#39;ve helped with <br/>
your kindnesses and I believe our children see that and will continue that in <br/>
their lives.<br/>
