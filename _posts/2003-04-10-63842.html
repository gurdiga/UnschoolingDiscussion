&lt;&lt;I am wondering if anyone has some creative ideas on things to do while<br/>
travelling (by car) with two 6 yr olds. We are going from Ohio to Florida,<br/>
stopping half way in Atlanta.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Will you be in a car or a van? When we travelled we would put the back seat<br/>
down on the conversion van once we hit the highway and just let the kids<br/>
play with regular toys the brought along. Like their little people and such.<br/>
If not, how about etcha sketch, magna doodle, word search books, puzzle<br/>
books, crayons, markers, paper, game boy, car bingo, rubiks cube, travel<br/>
games like connect four or trouble, those little puzzles of pictures that<br/>
you unscramble  and put back together, (you know where the tiles slide and<br/>
don&#39;t come off) stickers books. I think I&#39;m done.<br/>
Have a safe trip.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122137090">We have two homemade tapes made just for long trips, but they became family <br/>
favorites.  We just took stuff from various other albums and tapes.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I have played bits of tunes on recorder and people try to identify <br/>
the song.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were littler, we would do skip-counting in turn, which is <br/>
pretty hard when you&#39;re going fast.  Each next kid in order says the next <br/>
number.<br/>
<br/>
And when they were older, one would make a pattern and we&#39;d have to figure <br/>
out what number came next.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174156147">Hi Amy, My dh and I took our kids to Florida from Boston this summer. I picked out some good inexpensive books and cassette tapes and kept them stashed away so that I could pull these things out intermittently through out the trip. For my ten year old books on tape were great. For the younger ones, crayons, arts and crafts and games and songs were funner. we stopped a lot along the way and got out to stretch and eat. This is such a great learning experience for them though. My kids learned more about goegraphy and our country this way then they have in any &quot;lesson.&quot; Have fun! Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-863663494">We make up all kinds of word games as we go.  We go through the alphabet in turn naming animals, foods, toys, articles of clothing, boys names, girls names, etc.  Another one is to start a story using one word each the first round, then go to two words, then to three, etc.  The kids love doing these.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210652818">&quot;stopping  halfway&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If there is one thing I would recommend, it is to lose that idea.<br/>
Get out your map or go online and find a spot to stop every 100<br/>
miles or so.  You need not stop at each place, but when natural<br/>
energy meets profound boredom on a car trip, being able to say<br/>
&quot;in 30 minutes we will be in Greenville USA where they have an<br/>
Acme Playground/Historic site/dairy farm&quot; is a huge help.<br/>
They&#39;re kids - they just can&#39;t sit for hours quietly and<br/>
pleasantly, no matter how hard they try.<br/>
<br/>
Most of our happiest car trips over the past 24 years with kids<br/>
have been just that kind of prolonged journey.  Instead of 2<br/>
weeks at the beach, we may have 1 week there and one week in<br/>
transit, but I guarantee that stopping at 3 in the afternoon to<br/>
let them swim off the energy will make a better vacation than an<br/>
extra day of ocean swimming.  And the slightly off the beaten<br/>
path hike to find a waterfall and splash in it is more remembered<br/>
than the days at Epcot.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, some trips just have to be fast and all of the pass<br/>
times mentioned are good for those trips.</div>

It&#39;s about a 10 hr. book on tape. The Library has a ton of great stuff. The<br/>
Hobbit. I checked and Freddy goes to Florida by Walter R. Brooks is on tape<br/>
and CD. Freddy books are fun and entertaining. Wikki Stix is fun. It sticks<br/>
to windows too.;-) Take a cookie sheet and take your magnet letters and<br/>
such. We just made a backseat activities pack like this. It&#39;s in the FUN<br/>
Magazine. Use the Cookie sheet, add a white wipe off sheet (try Michaels<br/>
crafts and such for this) Put a magnet piece on side of wipe off marker so<br/>
they sticks. Use magnet tape to a folder with a flip top velcro closure so<br/>
it sticks to the back of the cookie sheet. Put the tape on the  top anda<br/>
bottom, long ways. It sicks and stay better. we ran off some game sheets to<br/>
put in page protectors to. The marker work great. Oh yes a small piece of<br/>
felt to wipe it off to go in the folder. Magnet buttons for playing pieces.<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

A friend just showed us a game where you look for letters to complete the <br/>
alphabet while travelling. So you would look for something outside the car <br/>
that has the letter &quot;A&quot; on it. A sign, a license plate, a logo on a passing <br/>
truck...Once you find &quot;A&quot; you go on to B, C, D, etc. When we get to Z we <br/>
sometimes do the alphabet backwards.<br/>

&lt;&lt; A friend just showed us a game where you look for letters to complete the <br/>
alphabet while travelling. So you would look for something outside the car <br/>
that has the letter &quot;A&quot; on it. A sign, a license plate, a logo on a passing <br/>
truck...Once you find &quot;A&quot; you go on to B, C, D, etc. When we get to Z we <br/>
sometimes do the alphabet backwards. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once we tried that with numbers.  We figured we&#39;d just stop when we got to <br/>
triple digits, but it kept working!  Business addresses, license plates, <br/>
phone numbers... It was eerie!<br/>
