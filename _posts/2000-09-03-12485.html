<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I hope this clears up any disagreement over &quot;what 
defines abuse&quot; Here is the law in black and white. It applies to all 50 
states.</font></p><br><br>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#00ff40" size="+3">&quot;CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT 
ACT&quot;</font><br><font size="+2">The Public Law 100-294</font></b></p></center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Defines child abuse and neglect as being any physical or 
mental injury, act of sexual abuse or exploitation, negligent treatment, or 
maltreatment of any child under the age of 18, unless the child protection law 
of the State in, which the child resides specifies a younger age for cases not 
involving sexual abuse, by a person, including any employee of a residential 
facility or any staff person providing out-of- home care, who is responsible for 
the child&#39;s welfare under circumstances, which indicate that the child&#39;s health 
or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">The Act defines sexual abuse as: the use, employment, 
persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of any child to engage in, or 
assist any other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct (or any 
simulation of such conduct) for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of 
such conduct, or rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual 
exploitation of children, or incest with children.</font></b></p><br><br>
<p>
<center><b><font color="#00ff40" size="+3">1984 Child Abuse Amendments of (P.L. 
98-457)</font></b></center>
<p></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">As a result of the above amendment to the Child Abuse Act, 
the act now also includes the withholding of medically indicated treatment for 
an infant&#39;s life-threatening conditions as child abuse.</font></b></p>
<p>
<center><b><font color="#00ff40" size="+3">WHAT IS MALTREATMENT 
?</font></b></center>
<p></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">The following categories basically all fit under the heading 
Maltreatment:</font></b></p>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">PHYSICAL ABUSE</font></b></p></center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Physical abuse is defined by inflicting any type of physical 
injury by punching, slapping, hitting, beating, kicking, biting, arm twisting, 
hair pulling, burning, or otherwise harming a child. The parent or care giver 
may not have intended to hurt the child and injury may have resulted from 
over-discipline or physical punishment that is inappropriate to the child&#39;s age. 
However, it is still abuse. Any physical act causing harm to a child is abuse 
whether it was intended or not.</font></b></p>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">CHILD NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Child neglect is defined by failure on the parents or care 
givers part to provide for the child&#39;s basic needs, food, water, shelter, 
clothing and so on. Child neglect can be a combination of the following: 
physical, educational, or emotional or can be just one alone.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">The latest national incidence study defines these three 
types of neglect as follows.</font></b></p>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">PHYSICAL NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Physical neglect includes refusal of or delay in seeking 
health care or emergency medical services, abandonment, kicking an under aged 
child out of the home. Not allowing a runaway to return home. Inadequate 
supervision, leaving the child unattended for long periods of time. Leaving an 
under aged child home alone to be responsible for younger 
siblings.</font></b></p>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Educational neglect includes allowing your school aged child 
to commit the act of chronic truancy, failure to enroll a child of mandatory 
school age, every child has the right to education and should be in school 
according to your states guidelines. Inattention to a special educational need, 
such as knowing your child is in need of special education classes and doing 
nothing about it.</font></b></p>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">EMOTIONAL NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Emotional neglect includes such actions as chronic or 
extreme spouse abuse in the child&#39;s presence. Knowledge of drug or alcohol use 
by the child, or permission. Refusal of or failure to allow or provide needed 
psychological care.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">It is extremely important to distinguish between willful 
neglect and a parent&#39;s or caretaker&#39;s failure to provide necessities of life 
because of poverty or cultural norms. Say for example, willful neglect is acts 
that call for Child Protective Services intervention. Whereas, if a parent who 
is unable to provide the necessities of life due to poverty may, instead, seek 
assistance from the governmental agencies charged with providing financial 
assistance, health services, housing, or other basic services.</font></b></p>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">EMOTIONAL ABUSE</font></b></p></center>
<p><b><font size="+1">Emotional abuse includes but is not limited to: Screaming, 
yelling, belittling, name calling, emotional detachment, lack of love and 
affection, scapegoating, such as blaming the child for the adults problems or 
financial state.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">As you&#39;ve seen there are many forms of child maltreatment 
more often than not we find them occurring in combinations. 
Emotional/psychological will most likely always be present as well. Emotional 
abuse and neglect includes acts or omissions by the parents, guardians or any 
other person responsible for the child&#39;s care that have caused, or could 
possibly cause, serious behavioral, emotional, or mental 
disorders.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="+1">In some cases of emotional/psychological abuse the acts of 
parents or other caretakers alone, without any harm evident in the child&#39;s 
behavior or condition, such as parents, guardian or care givers use excessive, 
extreme even sometimes bizarre forms of punishment, such as torture, or locking 
a child in a dark closet. These also are sufficient to warrant the intervention 
of Child Protective Services.</font></b></p>
