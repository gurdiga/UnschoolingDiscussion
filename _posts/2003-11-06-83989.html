<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048672738">&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t the DaVinci Code a work of fiction?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes it is, as I posted when I brought it up.  But it does have some basis in<br/>
fact.  Just like M*A*S*H was fiction but there really were Mash units, there<br/>
really was a Korean War and there really were American Soldiers there.<br/>

of course this is correct.  They are eating the candy like crazy.  But I<br/>
plan on buying more to refill the candy bowl, and keep doing it.  I know<br/>
they are hoarding it because they think it will soon be gone.  Same things<br/>
happen with popsicles, cake, brownies, cookies, everything. LOL  I may go<br/>
broke doing this!  Stepheny<br/>

  &lt;&lt; I have a feeling that if people try the &quot;full candy bowl&quot;  as an<br/>
  &quot;experiment &quot; and the kids pick up on the idea that this is just a<br/>
temporary thing- the<br/>
  -&quot;eat it now or it will be gone again&quot; process might kick in and no one<br/>
will<br/>
  have any idea if  it is possible for their family -not the parents and<br/>
  certainly not the kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>

----------------------<br/>
<br/>
They do what they like and get out into the community and volunteer and<br/>
eventually are offered or get a lead on a job.<br/>
<br/>
They apply for some beginnig kind of college class at a junior college or<br/>
community college and see if they like it, sometimes. After they take a few<br/>
classes, they can say &quot;some college&quot; on applications, and if they did okay<br/>
on those<br/>
clases, they can use that when they apply to college full time.<br/>

*************<br/>
How does anyone go to college or get a job? Not saying college is or isn&#39;t<br/>
important, but many many people never went or dropped out. And lots of folks<br/>
have jobs. My DH has one, there are a few others here who either have<br/>
spouses<br/>
that work or they work themselves. Some of the kids have jobs too. Moly has<br/>
a<br/>
small lawn mowing business; complete with fliers, cards, bills, and<br/>
receipts, she<br/>
is almost ten. She doesn&#39;t go to school or college.<br/>

&gt;*************<br/>
&gt;How does anyone go to college or get a job? Not saying college is or isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;important, but many many people never went or dropped out. And lots of<br/>
folks<br/>
&gt;have jobs. My DH has one, there are a few others here who either have<br/>

&gt;receipts, she<br/>
&gt;is almost ten. She doesn&#39;t go to school or college.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that home-schoolers tend to be more entrepreneurial,<br/>
generally, than the general population. Their children will, I think, tend<br/>
to be even more oriented towards creating their own businesses than<br/>
&quot;getting a job.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the job market -- and for the most part college as well -- is just as<br/>
accessible to home-schooled youngsters as the government-schooled. Nearly<br/>
every state offers a &quot;general education degree&quot; type certificate one<br/>
obtains by passing written exams, which functions as the equivalent of a<br/>
high-school diploma. And increasingly, both employers and colleges are<br/>
looking at a lot of things _besides_ a high-school sheepskin to gauge<br/>
applicants, as said sheepskins have plummeted in value.<br/>

Like everyone else does -- an application process, or a testing<br/>

Some don&#39;t go to college (just like schooled people) and some<br/>
make their own jobs (just like schooled people).<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t rely on the DaVinci Code for historical data&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nor would I.  I stated that it was fiction and a good starting point if one<br/>
is interested in researching this kind of thing.  I was raised Christian and<br/>
had never even considered some of the things the book brought up, so I<br/>
researched them on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there are quite a few historians who do believe that the Christian<br/>
festivals are based on the Pagan festivals, not just the DaVinci author.  In<br/>
fact, I watched a documentary on Christianity on the Discovery chanel not<br/>
too long ago, within the last year, that went into it in depth.  I believe<br/>
that it is fairly widely believed that Constantine usurped the Pagan<br/>
holidays with the Christian overlay when he decided everyone needed to be<br/>
Christian.  Of course, I believe that he was Pagan until his deathbed, but<br/>
he used Christianity as a ruse to cement his power.<br/>
<br/>
Probably one of those things with competing theories.<br/>

It is my understanding from my Bible school days that Jesus wasn&#39;t<br/>
considered God by all.  The council of Nicea voted on it.  Is that not<br/>
correct?<br/>

Lets remember its not just candy. Candy is only part of it.<br/>
I know when I was little my step father would freak over the use of A-1<br/>
sauce<br/>
on his expensive steak or the amount of ketchup used.<br/>
<br/>
In our home my sons big thing was soda. Why? Cuz my husband used to nag him<br/>
about how fast he drank it and tell him that when it was gone that was it.<br/>
It<br/>
wasn&#39;t the last time I bought it but my son drank it like it was.<br/>
Over several months I pointed out to my husband that he uses a lot creamer,<br/>
Pepsi and requires special peanut butter and only Jam plus others. I told<br/>
him<br/>
that it was fine with me but that it wasn&#39;t right if the rest of us use<br/>
generic<br/>
or are not allowed to purchase special stuff at all. I told him that our son<br/>
is home and not limited on the soda amounts. That when he (my husband) was<br/>
home on the weekends he often drank a 2 liter a day and that when he is at<br/>
work<br/>
his breaks are limited so that was the difference.<br/>
<br/>
We now buy 2-2 liters a week for Dustin rather than 1 and as I sit here they<br/>
are both unopened and purchased last Thursday.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have a feeling that if people try the &quot;full candy bowl&quot;  as an<br/>
&quot;experiment &quot; and the kids pick up on the idea that this is just a temporary<br/>
thing- the<br/>
-&quot;eat it now or it will be gone again&quot; process might kick in and no one will<br/>
have any idea if  it is possible for their family -not the parents and<br/>
certainly not the kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s true of unschooling and of video game playing and such too.<br/>
If the attitude of the parent is bristly suspicious hostility and an honest<br/>
HOPE that their &quot;experiment&quot; fails so that they can be proven &quot;right,&quot; it<br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are told &quot;We&#39;ll try unschooling for a month or two to see how it<br/>
works&quot; will have parents who say &quot;We used to unschool, and my kids never<br/>
showed<br/>
any burning interest, never started any big projects, and didn&#39;t do any<br/>
academic work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A temporary offer of freedom in a life of limits won&#39;t be handled calmly and<br/>
maturely.  It&#39;s smarter to treat it with the wild abandon it requires, if<br/>
that<br/>
door is closing soon.<br/>

Lets think of this in an economical way. IF you only get candy that no one<br/>
likes and it sits there, then what a waste of money, but the experiment<br/>
worked.<br/>
Right? IF you get candy that everyone likes and they eat it all up, which<br/>
they<br/>
will, at least for a few days or weeks, then the experiment failed. Right?<br/>
Oh<br/>
wait! That is only two doors! I choose the third, get candy everyone likes,<br/>
they eat it all right off, you keep the bowl filled, they start to realize<br/>
their favorite(s) will always be available, gradually the bowl stays full<br/>
most of<br/>
the time and the experiment works. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Subject: Halloween<br/>
<br/>
 If Hallowe&#39;en is evil, then Christians shouldn&#39;t have anything to do<br/>
with it at all. No dressing up; no begging for candy; no handing out<br/>
candy (or anything else) If it isn&#39;t, then why make up some<br/>
big &quot;baptized&quot; version of it? sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
I agree; if Christians are going to define Halloween as evil, they shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have anything to do with it at all.  Doing so &quot;compromises&quot; your belief<br/>
system, in my opinion.  However, so many Christians believe so many<br/>
different<br/>
things, such as total immersion baptism or sprinkling of water - what about<br/>
babies<br/>
being baptized?  There&#39;s a hot topic with Christians.  Oh, here&#39; s a really<br/>
hot<br/>
topic-once saved always saved???  I think God looks at our hearts and the<br/>
intent we have when we commit an act.  The Bible is too conflicting in its&#39;<br/>
statements.  You can support each idea by searching through Scriptures and<br/>
taking<br/>
them out of context-sometimes even in context.  I personally don&#39;t look at<br/>
Halloween as evil.  To my family, it is just a fun time to dress up and go<br/>
trick-or-treating.  And I even let my kids be whatever they want to be,<br/>
whether it is<br/>
a witch, a demon, a ghost-whatever.  For this reason, we don&#39;t go to church<br/>
fall festivals.  If you want to welcome people I don&#39;t believe you can put<br/>
stipulations on the welcome mat.  At least not at church.  In my own home,<br/>
I&#39;ll<br/>
decide what parameters I want.  As I write that it sounds like a double<br/>
standard, but I reason it with &quot;but I&#39;m not God.  I&#39;m not all forgiving and<br/>
all loving<br/>
and all accepting.  I&#39;m not willing to die on the cross for the entire<br/>
world.&quot;  Does that make sense, or am I making excuses?<br/>

Subject: Re: Digest Number 4161<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t rely on The DaVinci Code for historical data. He cites The<br/>
Gnostic Gospels with as much veracity as valid historical documents,<br/>
when the earliest copies of the Gnostic Gospels are dated in the 4th<br/>
century or later. The author claims that early Christians didn&#39;t<br/>
consider the Lord to be God, when early Christians most certainly DID<br/>
consider Him to be just that. I enjoyed reading The DaVinci Code, but<br/>
it isn&#39;t an historical treatise by anyone&#39;s measure, and it really<br/>
isn&#39;t all that well written.<br/>
<br/>
As for all these Christian holidays coming out of Paganism...<br/>
actually, I have read a book that refutes this notion. (and can&#39;t<br/>
remember the title. It is a scholarly, historian thing. Like, a PhD<br/>
thesis or something. 500 pages + ) The Reformers wanted Christians to<br/>
make a clean break from R Catholicism; therefore, they stigmatized<br/>
various Catholic practices by saying they came from paganism.<br/>
According to this essay, archaeological data indicates that many of<br/>
these traditions didn&#39;t come into practice until after Christianity<br/>
got into an area. I&#39;ll try and remember specifics. The Yule Log was<br/>
one of the &quot;pagan practices&quot; debunked in the book. sheesh. can&#39;t<br/>
remember, but Christian feast days coming from paganism or not, isn&#39;t<br/>
my main point.<br/>
<br/>
IF Christian traditions come from paganism, my question just takes on<br/>
more weight. Why is Halloween evil (and it IS considered evil by many<br/>
Christians. Take my word on that one. One of my best friends won&#39;t do<br/>
trick or treating, and another one completely ignores the day...) Why<br/>
is All Hallow&#39;s Eve considered evil, and to be shunned, when<br/>
Christmas and Easter are embraced? IF they come from pagan practices,<br/>
we should shun all of it. And in fact, the Reformers and their<br/>
followers DID. Christmas was illegal in Puritan America. The<br/>
book &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was written by the Puritan Daniel Defoe. He<br/>
makes a point of ignoring Dec. 25. by having the main character mark<br/>
off days on his calendar and pointedly having Dec. 25 be just another<br/>
day, nothing special.<br/>
<br/>
The Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. Sunday being<br/>
named after the Sun, Monday after the Moon, and so forth. Can&#39;t have<br/>
THAT.<br/>
<br/>
If Hallowe&#39;en is evil, having come from paganism, then we must follow<br/>
through on our logic and ban other Christian high holy days. But<br/>
today&#39;s Christians don&#39;t follow through. They just consider<br/>
Hallowe&#39;en evil, but only certain parts of it, like trick or<br/>
treating. They allow the dressing up and the candy, but ban the trick<br/>
or treating...or, just put it in the church basement or parking lot.<br/>
And they never think twice about Christmas and Easter or the origin<br/>
of any other tradition.<br/>

&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Right! Most of the Christian traditions are CHRISTIAN in origin.<br/>
That&#39;s what the treatise that I mention elsewhere was about. Fact is,<br/>
Catholicism was outright rejected, therefore all the feast days had<br/>
to be rejected, too...Christmas, Easter, Halloween, All Saint&#39;s Day,<br/>
all of them...are celebrations of the Lord&#39;s life or the Church&#39;s<br/>
life and not pagan at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear about the banning of the word Medieval! and<br/>
laughing my head off...sad and funny at the same time. What idiots.<br/>

<br/>
If this announcement is appropriate for your unschooling site, do you have<br/>
an<br/>
email loop and/or message board that this announcement could be sent to?  I’<br/>
d<br/>
like to give as many homeschoolers as possible a chance to submit their<br/>
writing/artwork for publication.  I homeschooled our two boys and now live<br/>
on the<br/>
coast of New Jersey with my husband in an empty nest! I have had an idea for<br/>
a<br/>
book for years and am finally pulling it all together!  The book will be a<br/>
beautiful one; I have found nothing similar in my search of books already<br/>
published.  It will show everyone just how incredibly creative and talented<br/>
our<br/>
homeschoolers are.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks<br/>
very<br/>
much.  Kate Jennings<br/>
<br/>
Announcement –<br/>
My name is Kate Jennings, and I homeschooled our two sons for eight years,<br/>
not  counting  the  years  from  birth  to  age  six!   I am compiling<br/>
writings<br/>
by homeschoolers that will show the world just how talented we are!  I am<br/>
accepting (very) short stories, essays/paragraphs (creative or instructive),<br/>
diary<br/>
entries, poems, letters to and from family or friends, etc.   Photos and<br/>
drawings that tie in with the writing would be great -- really, really<br/>
great. The<br/>
book will be a showcase of the talents that homeschooled students possess.<br/>
Anything written by students would be appropriate, whether it is<br/>
descriptive,<br/>
instructive or creative.  Please keep in mind my plea for accompanying<br/>
artwork<br/>
-- photos or sketches that relate to the written submission.  The<br/>
presentation<br/>
of the writing in the book is very, very important to me, and accompanying<br/>
artwork is very important to the presentation!   One of my favorite<br/>
submissions<br/>
is from a boy whose family built their own home.  A photo and a sketch were<br/>
included in the submission.  This entry will be most effective!  Please<br/>

&lt;snip&gt; Its really easy to find<br/>
&gt; fun, interesting things to do without a lot of money or planning.<br/>
You can<br/>
&gt; throw together great learning activities for young children. When<br/>
they get a<br/>
&gt; little older, the co-op can do so much more that is difficult to<br/>
do without<br/>
&gt; more structure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have had some wonderful classes that involve speakers and field<br/>
experts<br/>
&gt; that would be difficult to schedule. We have access to materials<br/>
that are<br/>
&gt; available to schools, but not always to homeschoolers just because<br/>
they will<br/>
&gt; reach more children. We have gotten grants to pay for some classes<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; materials. We have a permanant meeting place so long term<br/>
commitments can be<br/>
&gt; made. One of my latest thoughts is to try to get appoval to start<br/>
drivers ed<br/>
&gt; classes at the center-in Ohio the kids have to attend a course<br/>
through<br/>
&gt; school or a private driving school, so why not have a school<br/>
program at the<br/>
&gt; center so we don&#39;t all have to pay $300 to the local driving<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
We paid over $200 for an insurance-sponsored, profit-driven &quot;driving<br/>
school&quot; in Louisiana -- typical, conventional week&#39;s worth of wasted<br/>
time.  They insisted that our son should be able to drive on the<br/>
road after six hours of instruction to some arbitrary standard (with<br/>
no other &quot;official&quot; road hours under his belt) -before- issuing a<br/>
learner&#39;s permit (you know, the one you get so you can learn how to<br/>
drive on the road?) and when he &quot;failed&quot; to meet their so-called<br/>
standard, they had the legal right (as a for-profit company offering<br/>
a state-mandated service) to require us to fork over ex-tra bucks<br/>
for ex-tra hours from their ex-pert driving instructor.  What a scam!<br/>
<br/>
Next time around -- No driver&#39;s ed course required in SC --<br/>
autodidacts simply pass the written test, which includes some of the<br/>
drug & alcohol awareness info, and receive a learner&#39;s permit --<br/>
then, proceed to learn to drive on the road under an adult, licensed<br/>
driver&#39;s supervision (you know, like the old days when your parents<br/>
sat by your side and took part in the process as a matter of course -<br/>
- white knuckles notwithstanding.)  Common sense and a lot of love<br/>
kept them in the passenger&#39;s seat till they were confident in our<br/>
ability to steer clear of trouble.  Those were the days, my friend...<br/>
<br/>
Here we are in FL -- mandated Traffic Law & Substance Abuse course,<br/>
reasonable priced (under $50) and even available in a convenient<br/>
online version.  Major problem -- the course content on substance<br/>
abuse is highly objectionable (nightmarish to those who have gone<br/>
through the trauma of losing loved ones to DUI) and in conflict with<br/>
our sincerely-held religious beliefs and educational philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Have contacted the HSMV and State Representatives for information on<br/>
a waiver (for the objectionable part of the course, if not all), but<br/>
no go.  Our Senator&#39;s legislative assistant is still looking into<br/>
the matter... maybe.  Once we exhausted the obvious legal<br/>
alternatives, we decided to check out CompuHigh&#39;s offerings and drop<br/>
a line to Pat Montgomery at Clonlara.  Haven&#39;t received a response<br/>
in the past few weeks since our first inquiry, so plan to follow-up<br/>
in a week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Will have to see if any of the umbrella schools/co-ops here in FL<br/>
have tackled this one already -- perhaps it&#39;s our turn to take the<br/>
wheel and formalize our relationship to the un/homeschooling<br/>
community by gearing driver&#39;s ed to individual needs.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, driving should never be tied into grades, attendance, or<br/>
anything else as a matter of privilege -- it should be recognized as<br/>
a marketable skill, and in some cases, an absolute necessity.  We<br/>
want all who are able to take the initiative to gain this skill<br/>
without compromising their values or welfare in the process.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it is alot easier for new homeschoolers to find the<br/>
support they<br/>
&gt; need when you have a co-op like this too. They can jump right in<br/>
to a<br/>
&gt; thriving community of homeschoolers instead of winging it on their<br/>
own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Center that we use is quite far from us, so we often do not<br/>
get to<br/>
&gt; participate in many of the activities that interest us. I wish we<br/>
could have<br/>
&gt; them in every community so that more of the wonderful<br/>
opportunities were<br/>
&gt; available to every one who want to learn for life. Not just the<br/>
hsers or<br/>
&gt; even just the kids.<br/>

Good point, Laura.<br/>
It&#39;s not about candy itself, it&#39;s about nagging and judgmentalism about<br/>
food.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to keep my cousin from having more than one glass of milk with a<br/>
meal.  It was hateful.  She really wanted more milk, that was all.  If she<br/>
ate<br/>
all her other food she MIGHT be allowed to have more milk.  But not without<br/>
her feeling nine kinds of unworthy.<br/>

You&#39;re doing the right thing, even if the transition may be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure of your situation but it might be worthwhile, during the last<br/>
couple of days at the school, for your son to collect phone numbers and<br/>
contact info for his favorite friends there. Unless distance is an issue<br/>
there&#39;s no reason to cut your son off completely from his school friends.<br/>
They can still socialize on weekends, in late afternoons, etc. as the<br/>
situation permits.<br/>

What&#39;s being discussed here as Christian holidays and pagan holidays is<br/>
dealing just with England/English/American stuff.   The Catholic church has<br/>
been<br/>
really good about adapting local custom and giving it a religous overlay.<br/>
So<br/>
local observances were maintained but given Christian meanings. It happened<br/>
in<br/>
Rome and Greece, all over Europe.  It&#39;s still done now.  At the Pueblos on<br/>
the<br/>
northern Rio Grande they have traditional dances which have come to be<br/>
associated with Christmas and danced on Christmas eve, with the dancers<br/>
starting in<br/>
the church (or ending there).  Other dances which haven&#39;t been attached to<br/>
Christian holidays start and end in the kiva.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think that&#39;s true of unschooling and of video game playing and such too.<br/>
&gt;If the attitude of the parent is bristly suspicious hostility and an honest<br/>
&gt;HOPE that their &quot;experiment&quot; fails so that they can be proven &quot;right,&quot; it<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;work.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the parents are sincere in trying it, their unconscious attitudes<br/>
could easily be picked up by the kids. I don&#39;t think they necessarily have<br/>

**********************<br/>
This is how I have always understood All Souls (Saints) Day.  As the<br/>
Catholic<br/>
Church expanded, they moved into countries that had Pagan celebrations at<br/>
various times of the year.  As locals (especially peasants) came to accept<br/>
the<br/>
Church (yes, I&#39;m sure it was forced on many) they began to mesh their own<br/>
Pagan<br/>
beliefs with Catholic beliefs.  Rather than have an all out rebellion, the<br/>
Church said, &quot;OK, you celebrate death and the dead this time of year, you<br/>
believe<br/>
dead souls come back to earth at this time, let&#39;s just call it &#39;All Souls&#39;<br/>
(November 1st) and we&#39;ll honor all the saints and dead that have come before<br/>
us,<br/>
pray for them, and ask them to pray for us.&quot;  Halloween = All Hallow&#39;s<br/>
(saint&#39;s) Eve = Hallow&#39;s eve = Hallow &#39;een.  Things Pagan remained on the<br/>
night<br/>
before, (carved and lighted turnips - pumpkins now), dead coming back to<br/>
roam,<br/>
etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Yes, about celebrating the resurrection.<br/>
No on &quot;Easter&quot; being of Christian origin.  When they stuck it on that<br/>
weekend, they kept the old name (in England--I don&#39;t know what they call it<br/>

*******************************************<br/>
I think Easter came from the name &quot;Ostre&quot; who was a fertility goddess.<br/>
Hence, the eggs (fertility), rabbits (fertility), etc.  Another case of<br/>
pagan and<br/>
Christian mixing.<br/>
<br/>
Almost every &quot;Christian&quot; holiday was meshed with pagan beliefs.<br/>
Christmas..Christ was not born in the winter, but pagans had a huge<br/>
&quot;winterfest&quot; (Yule)<br/>
which celebrated the winter equinox (I think?).  They burned part of the<br/>
yule<br/>
log from the year before, they held holly as a sign of eternal life (doesn&#39;t<br/>
die<br/>
in the winter),...I think even mistletoe began as a pagan tradition!  Again,<br/>
the Church basically said, &quot;OK, keep your festival, but can we instead &#39;say&#39;<br/>
we&#39;re celebrating Christ&#39;s birth?  That&#39;ll make it OK.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heck, even Birthday cakes started as a gift to idols and &quot;gods&quot; originally.<br/>
Not sure what a burning cake represented, but it started pagan!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Actually, there are quite a few historians who do believe that the<br/>
Christian<br/>
<br/>
festivals are based on the Pagan festivals, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When there was a chance to commandeer an existing tradition they did so.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean things like All Saint&#39;s Day and All Hallow&#39;s Eve aren&#39;t<br/>
Christian holidays.  They are.  But if there was an existing tradition, they<br/>
got kind<br/>
of blended together.<br/>
<br/>
The eggs and bunnies stuff is sometimes used to represent Christian symbols,<br/>
when really they&#39;re from a whole separate thing originally.<br/>

There is an interactive geoboard here along with many other things.  My kids<br/>
liked the mastermind type thingys.  I was sitting here playing wih it and<br/>
pretty soon they were all here wanting to do it.  There went my computer<br/>
time even though they all have their own. It&#39;s kinda like sleeping in my<br/>
bed,  it&#39;s more fun on my computer.   Probably cause I have a laptop and<br/>
they can run me off of the chair!  lol.<br/>

&gt; Fundamental<br/>
&gt; Christians do NOT have any type of &quot;Halloween&quot; celebration.  They do NOT<br/>

<br/>
Some do.<br/>
<br/>
Every year we had the Halloween debate in the debate folder of the<br/>
homeschooling area of AOL. Every year a Christian fundamentalist would ask<br/>
what &quot;people&quot; (apparently assuming we were all fundamentalist Christians)<br/>
were doing about Halloween. Usually they had been celebrating it but had<br/>
been picking up hints that it wasn&#39;t a good thing to do. Of course they<br/>
didn&#39;t just get a fundamentalist viewpoint! So we&#39;d have the Annual<br/>
Halloween Debate.<br/>
<br/>
Some fundamentalists were conflicted. Some fundamentalists were passionately<br/>
against Halloween -- and we&#39;d have the Annual Witches Worship Satan Debate.<br/>
Some fundamentalists didn&#39;t see a problem celebrating Halloween, though I<br/>
don&#39;t remember any fundamentalists who were passionatly supportive of it.<br/>
<br/>
It probably depends on who&#39;s drawing the line on who is a fundamentalist or<br/>
&quot;true Christian&quot; and who isn&#39;t. Probably those passionately against<br/>
Halloween would feel those who didn&#39;t see a problem with Halloween weren&#39;t<br/>
&quot;true Christians.&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m not saying you would forget, just pointing out that an important part of<br/>
the experiment is choice. One of the appeals of &quot;junk&quot; food is that it&#39;s<br/>
convenient. It&#39;s easier to grab a candy bar or a bag of chips than to make a<br/>
sandwich. So when they reach their saturation point, they need other easy to<br/>
grab choices.<br/>

&gt; I know I react differently because I keep eating even when it doesn&#39;t<br/>

Me too. I find my will power drops significantly after I have the first<br/>
candy bar and I can keep eating even after I don&#39;t want any more.<br/>
<br/>
*But* my behavior was worse when I didn&#39;t give myself permission to have as<br/>
much as I wanted. One year I bought 3 bags of Halloween candy to hand out<br/>
and ate them all before Halloween. That&#39;s because pretty much the only candy<br/>
I had each year was at Halloween. I went through 3 big bags of almond M%Ms<br/>
before I stopped craving them everytime I&#39;d see them in the store.<br/>
<br/>
This may not be an experiment you&#39;d be willing to try -- but you can&#39;t know<br/>
until you do try it! -- but I bet if you bought 5 bags of your favorite<br/>
candy and promised yourself that as you ate them you&#39;d replenish your<br/>
supply, that you&#39;d pig out for a while -- maybe for many bags -- but then<br/>
grow tired of it.<br/>

of course this is correct.  They are eating the candy like crazy.  But I<br/>
plan on buying more to refill the candy bowl, and keep doing it.  I know<br/>
they are hoarding it because they think it will soon be gone.  Same things<br/>
happen with popsicles, cake, brownies, cookies, everything. LOL  I may go<br/>

  &lt;&lt; I have a feeling that if people try the &quot;full candy bowl&quot;  as an<br/>
  &quot;experiment &quot; and the kids pick up on the idea that this is just a<br/>
temporary thing- the<br/>
  -&quot;eat it now or it will be gone again&quot; process might kick in and no one<br/>
will<br/>
  have any idea if  it is possible for their family -not the parents and<br/>
  certainly not the kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
They do what they like and get out into the community and volunteer and<br/>
eventually are offered or get a lead on a job.<br/>
<br/>
They apply for some beginnig kind of college class at a junior college or<br/>
community college and see if they like it, sometimes. After they take a few<br/>
classes, they can say &quot;some college&quot; on applications, and if they did okay<br/>
on those<br/>
clases, they can use that when they apply to college full time.<br/>

How does anyone go to college or get a job? Not saying college is or isn&#39;t<br/>
important, but many many people never went or dropped out. And lots of folks<br/>
have jobs. My DH has one, there are a few others here who either have<br/>
spouses<br/>
that work or they work themselves. Some of the kids have jobs too. Moly has<br/>

I have noticed that home-schoolers tend to be more entrepreneurial,<br/>
generally, than the general population. Their children will, I think, tend<br/>
to be even more oriented towards creating their own businesses than<br/>
&quot;getting a job.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the job market -- and for the most part college as well -- is just as<br/>
accessible to home-schooled youngsters as the government-schooled. Nearly<br/>
every state offers a &quot;general education degree&quot; type certificate one<br/>
obtains by passing written exams, which functions as the equivalent of a<br/>
high-school diploma. And increasingly, both employers and colleges are<br/>
looking at a lot of things _besides_ a high-school sheepskin to gauge<br/>
applicants, as said sheepskins have plummeted in value.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t rely on the DaVinci Code for historical data&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nor would I.  I stated that it was fiction and a good starting point if one<br/>
is interested in researching this kind of thing.  I was raised Christian and<br/>
had never even considered some of the things the book brought up, so I<br/>
researched them on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there are quite a few historians who do believe that the Christian<br/>
festivals are based on the Pagan festivals, not just the DaVinci author.  In<br/>
fact, I watched a documentary on Christianity on the Discovery chanel not<br/>
too long ago, within the last year, that went into it in depth.  I believe<br/>
that it is fairly widely believed that Constantine usurped the Pagan<br/>
holidays with the Christian overlay when he decided everyone needed to be<br/>
Christian.  Of course, I believe that he was Pagan until his deathbed, but<br/>
he used Christianity as a ruse to cement his power.<br/>
<br/>
Probably one of those things with competing theories.<br/>

It is my understanding from my Bible school days that Jesus wasn&#39;t<br/>

Lets remember its not just candy. Candy is only part of it.<br/>
I know when I was little my step father would freak over the use of A-1<br/>
sauce<br/>
on his expensive steak or the amount of ketchup used.<br/>
<br/>
In our home my sons big thing was soda. Why? Cuz my husband used to nag him<br/>
about how fast he drank it and tell him that when it was gone that was it.<br/>
It<br/>
wasn&#39;t the last time I bought it but my son drank it like it was.<br/>
Over several months I pointed out to my husband that he uses a lot creamer,<br/>
Pepsi and requires special peanut butter and only Jam plus others. I told<br/>
him<br/>
that it was fine with me but that it wasn&#39;t right if the rest of us use<br/>
generic<br/>
or are not allowed to purchase special stuff at all. I told him that our son<br/>
is home and not limited on the soda amounts. That when he (my husband) was<br/>
home on the weekends he often drank a 2 liter a day and that when he is at<br/>
work<br/>
his breaks are limited so that was the difference.<br/>
<br/>
We now buy 2-2 liters a week for Dustin rather than 1 and as I sit here they<br/>
are both unopened and purchased last Thursday.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have a feeling that if people try the &quot;full candy bowl&quot;  as an<br/>
&quot;experiment &quot; and the kids pick up on the idea that this is just a temporary<br/>
thing- the<br/>
-&quot;eat it now or it will be gone again&quot; process might kick in and no one will<br/>
have any idea if  it is possible for their family -not the parents and<br/>
certainly not the kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s true of unschooling and of video game playing and such too.<br/>
If the attitude of the parent is bristly suspicious hostility and an honest<br/>
HOPE that their &quot;experiment&quot; fails so that they can be proven &quot;right,&quot; it<br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are told &quot;We&#39;ll try unschooling for a month or two to see how it<br/>
works&quot; will have parents who say &quot;We used to unschool, and my kids never<br/>
showed<br/>
any burning interest, never started any big projects, and didn&#39;t do any<br/>
academic work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A temporary offer of freedom in a life of limits won&#39;t be handled calmly and<br/>
maturely.  It&#39;s smarter to treat it with the wild abandon it requires, if<br/>
that<br/>
door is closing soon.<br/>

I also thought about something else.  What if you get say, M&M&#39;s and<br/>
everyone<br/>
goes nuts for them, then some hard candy, and it sits for a long time, but<br/>
you<br/>
get something else good again and everyone devours it again?  Would it be<br/>
best to get lots of different kinds?<br/>

BTW, I went to WAlmart to get leftover Halloween candy and it was ALL<br/>
GONE!!!<br/>
I&#39;ll pick some up at the bulk grocery store instead.<br/>

Lets think of this in an economical way. IF you only get candy that no one<br/>
likes and it sits there, then what a waste of money, but the experiment<br/>
worked.<br/>
Right? IF you get candy that everyone likes and they eat it all up, which<br/>
they<br/>
will, at least for a few days or weeks, then the experiment failed. Right?<br/>
Oh<br/>
wait! That is only two doors! I choose the third, get candy everyone likes,<br/>
they eat it all right off, you keep the bowl filled, they start to realize<br/>
their favorite(s) will always be available, gradually the bowl stays full<br/>
most of<br/>
the time and the experiment works. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Subject: Halloween<br/>
<br/>
 If Hallowe&#39;en is evil, then Christians shouldn&#39;t have anything to do<br/>
with it at all. No dressing up; no begging for candy; no handing out<br/>
candy (or anything else) If it isn&#39;t, then why make up some<br/>
big &quot;baptized&quot; version of it? sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
I agree; if Christians are going to define Halloween as evil, they shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have anything to do with it at all.  Doing so &quot;compromises&quot; your belief<br/>
system, in my opinion.  However, so many Christians believe so many<br/>
different<br/>
things, such as total immersion baptism or sprinkling of water - what about<br/>
babies<br/>
being baptized?  There&#39;s a hot topic with Christians.  Oh, here&#39; s a really<br/>
hot<br/>
topic-once saved always saved???  I think God looks at our hearts and the<br/>
intent we have when we commit an act.  The Bible is too conflicting in its&#39;<br/>
statements.  You can support each idea by searching through Scriptures and<br/>
taking<br/>
them out of context-sometimes even in context.  I personally don&#39;t look at<br/>
Halloween as evil.  To my family, it is just a fun time to dress up and go<br/>
trick-or-treating.  And I even let my kids be whatever they want to be,<br/>
whether it is<br/>
a witch, a demon, a ghost-whatever.  For this reason, we don&#39;t go to church<br/>
fall festivals.  If you want to welcome people I don&#39;t believe you can put<br/>
stipulations on the welcome mat.  At least not at church.  In my own home,<br/>
I&#39;ll<br/>
decide what parameters I want.  As I write that it sounds like a double<br/>
standard, but I reason it with &quot;but I&#39;m not God.  I&#39;m not all forgiving and<br/>
all loving<br/>
and all accepting.  I&#39;m not willing to die on the cross for the entire<br/>
world.&quot;  Does that make sense, or am I making excuses?<br/>

Subject: Re: Digest Number 4161<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t rely on The DaVinci Code for historical data. He cites The<br/>
Gnostic Gospels with as much veracity as valid historical documents,<br/>
when the earliest copies of the Gnostic Gospels are dated in the 4th<br/>
century or later. The author claims that early Christians didn&#39;t<br/>
consider the Lord to be God, when early Christians most certainly DID<br/>
consider Him to be just that. I enjoyed reading The DaVinci Code, but<br/>
it isn&#39;t an historical treatise by anyone&#39;s measure, and it really<br/>
isn&#39;t all that well written.<br/>
<br/>
As for all these Christian holidays coming out of Paganism...<br/>
actually, I have read a book that refutes this notion. (and can&#39;t<br/>
remember the title. It is a scholarly, historian thing. Like, a PhD<br/>
thesis or something. 500 pages + ) The Reformers wanted Christians to<br/>
make a clean break from R Catholicism; therefore, they stigmatized<br/>
various Catholic practices by saying they came from paganism.<br/>
According to this essay, archaeological data indicates that many of<br/>
these traditions didn&#39;t come into practice until after Christianity<br/>
got into an area. I&#39;ll try and remember specifics. The Yule Log was<br/>
one of the &quot;pagan practices&quot; debunked in the book. sheesh. can&#39;t<br/>
remember, but Christian feast days coming from paganism or not, isn&#39;t<br/>
my main point.<br/>
<br/>
IF Christian traditions come from paganism, my question just takes on<br/>
more weight. Why is Halloween evil (and it IS considered evil by many<br/>
Christians. Take my word on that one. One of my best friends won&#39;t do<br/>
trick or treating, and another one completely ignores the day...) Why<br/>
is All Hallow&#39;s Eve considered evil, and to be shunned, when<br/>
Christmas and Easter are embraced? IF they come from pagan practices,<br/>
we should shun all of it. And in fact, the Reformers and their<br/>
followers DID. Christmas was illegal in Puritan America. The<br/>
book &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was written by the Puritan Daniel Defoe. He<br/>
makes a point of ignoring Dec. 25. by having the main character mark<br/>
off days on his calendar and pointedly having Dec. 25 be just another<br/>
day, nothing special.<br/>
<br/>
The Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. Sunday being<br/>
named after the Sun, Monday after the Moon, and so forth. Can&#39;t have<br/>
THAT.<br/>
<br/>
If Hallowe&#39;en is evil, having come from paganism, then we must follow<br/>
through on our logic and ban other Christian high holy days. But<br/>
today&#39;s Christians don&#39;t follow through. They just consider<br/>
Hallowe&#39;en evil, but only certain parts of it, like trick or<br/>
treating. They allow the dressing up and the candy, but ban the trick<br/>
or treating...or, just put it in the church basement or parking lot.<br/>
And they never think twice about Christmas and Easter or the origin<br/>
of any other tradition.<br/>

Christmas is<br/>

Day or Day<br/>

&gt;<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s Christian in origin, only it&#39;s Catholic in origin, and so it<br/>

<br/>
Right! Most of the Christian traditions are CHRISTIAN in origin.<br/>
That&#39;s what the treatise that I mention elsewhere was about. Fact is,<br/>
Catholicism was outright rejected, therefore all the feast days had<br/>
to be rejected, too...Christmas, Easter, Halloween, All Saint&#39;s Day,<br/>
all of them...are celebrations of the Lord&#39;s life or the Church&#39;s<br/>
life and not pagan at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear about the banning of the word Medieval! and<br/>
laughing my head off...sad and funny at the same time. What idiots.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that there are such idiots representing Christianity out in<br/>
the world.<br/>

Hi Amy,<br/>

Unfaithful was originally a French movie and I&#39;ve been told that the ending<br/>
was much more conclusive.<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of the American version is that we can pretty much decide what we<br/>
think they did and debate over it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s why the American film makers did that but who knows.<br/>

ps. I didn&#39;t put the French version ending here because maybe some people<br/>

It&#39;ll be much easier to find info. on the movie imo knowing that it&#39;s<br/>
supposedly a classic French movie originally.<br/>

Subject: homeschooled kids--call for writings<br/>
<br/>
If this announcement is appropriate for your unschooling site, do you have<br/>
an<br/>
email loop and/or message board that this announcement could be sent to?  I’<br/>
d<br/>
like to give as many homeschoolers as possible a chance to submit their<br/>
writing/artwork for publication.  I homeschooled our two boys and now live<br/>
on the<br/>
coast of New Jersey with my husband in an empty nest! I have had an idea for<br/>
a<br/>
book for years and am finally pulling it all together!  The book will be a<br/>
beautiful one; I have found nothing similar in my search of books already<br/>
published.  It will show everyone just how incredibly creative and talented<br/>
our<br/>
homeschoolers are.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks<br/>
very<br/>
much.  Kate Jennings<br/>
<br/>
Announcement –<br/>
My name is Kate Jennings, and I homeschooled our two sons for eight years,<br/>
not  counting  the  years  from  birth  to  age  six!   I am compiling<br/>
writings<br/>
by homeschoolers that will show the world just how talented we are!  I am<br/>
accepting (very) short stories, essays/paragraphs (creative or instructive),<br/>
diary<br/>
entries, poems, letters to and from family or friends, etc.   Photos and<br/>
drawings that tie in with the writing would be great -- really, really<br/>
great. The<br/>
book will be a showcase of the talents that homeschooled students possess.<br/>
Anything written by students would be appropriate, whether it is<br/>
descriptive,<br/>
instructive or creative.  Please keep in mind my plea for accompanying<br/>
artwork<br/>
-- photos or sketches that relate to the written submission.  The<br/>
presentation<br/>
of the writing in the book is very, very important to me, and accompanying<br/>
artwork is very important to the presentation!   One of my favorite<br/>
submissions<br/>
is from a boy whose family built their own home.  A photo and a sketch were<br/>
included in the submission.  This entry will be most effective!  Please<br/>
email me<br/>

&lt;snip&gt; Its really easy to find<br/>
&gt; fun, interesting things to do without a lot of money or planning.<br/>
You can<br/>
&gt; throw together great learning activities for young children. When<br/>
they get a<br/>
&gt; little older, the co-op can do so much more that is difficult to<br/>
do without<br/>
&gt; more structure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have had some wonderful classes that involve speakers and field<br/>
experts<br/>
&gt; that would be difficult to schedule. We have access to materials<br/>
that are<br/>
&gt; available to schools, but not always to homeschoolers just because<br/>
they will<br/>
&gt; reach more children. We have gotten grants to pay for some classes<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; materials. We have a permanant meeting place so long term<br/>
commitments can be<br/>
&gt; made. One of my latest thoughts is to try to get appoval to start<br/>
drivers ed<br/>
&gt; classes at the center-in Ohio the kids have to attend a course<br/>
through<br/>
&gt; school or a private driving school, so why not have a school<br/>
program at the<br/>
&gt; center so we don&#39;t all have to pay $300 to the local driving<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
We paid over $200 for an insurance-sponsored, profit-driven &quot;driving<br/>
school&quot; in Louisiana -- typical, conventional week&#39;s worth of wasted<br/>
time.  They insisted that our son should be able to drive on the<br/>
road after six hours of instruction to some arbitrary standard (with<br/>
no other &quot;official&quot; road hours under his belt) -before- issuing a<br/>
learner&#39;s permit (you know, the one you get so you can learn how to<br/>
drive on the road?) and when he &quot;failed&quot; to meet their so-called<br/>
standard, they had the legal right (as a for-profit company offering<br/>
a state-mandated service) to require us to fork over ex-tra bucks<br/>
for ex-tra hours from their ex-pert driving instructor.  What a scam!<br/>
<br/>
Next time around -- No driver&#39;s ed course required in SC --<br/>
autodidacts simply pass the written test, which includes some of the<br/>
drug & alcohol awareness info, and receive a learner&#39;s permit --<br/>
then, proceed to learn to drive on the road under an adult, licensed<br/>
driver&#39;s supervision (you know, like the old days when your parents<br/>
sat by your side and took part in the process as a matter of course -<br/>
- white knuckles notwithstanding.)  Common sense and a lot of love<br/>
kept them in the passenger&#39;s seat till they were confident in our<br/>
ability to steer clear of trouble.  Those were the days, my friend...<br/>
<br/>
Here we are in FL -- mandated Traffic Law & Substance Abuse course,<br/>
reasonable priced (under $50) and even available in a convenient<br/>
online version.  Major problem -- the course content on substance<br/>
abuse is highly objectionable (nightmarish to those who have gone<br/>
through the trauma of losing loved ones to DUI) and in conflict with<br/>
our sincerely-held religious beliefs and educational philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Have contacted the HSMV and State Representatives for information on<br/>
a waiver (for the objectionable part of the course, if not all), but<br/>
no go.  Our Senator&#39;s legislative assistant is still looking into<br/>
the matter... maybe.  Once we exhausted the obvious legal<br/>
alternatives, we decided to check out CompuHigh&#39;s offerings and drop<br/>
a line to Pat Montgomery at Clonlara.  Haven&#39;t received a response<br/>
in the past few weeks since our first inquiry, so plan to follow-up<br/>
in a week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Will have to see if any of the umbrella schools/co-ops here in FL<br/>
have tackled this one already -- perhaps it&#39;s our turn to take the<br/>
wheel and formalize our relationship to the un/homeschooling<br/>
community by gearing driver&#39;s ed to individual needs.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, driving should never be tied into grades, attendance, or<br/>
anything else as a matter of privilege -- it should be recognized as<br/>
a marketable skill, and in some cases, an absolute necessity.  We<br/>
want all who are able to take the initiative to gain this skill<br/>
without compromising their values or welfare in the process.<br/>
<br/>
Advice & suggestions welcome & encouraged!  Hasta luego, Amigos...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it is alot easier for new homeschoolers to find the<br/>
support they<br/>
&gt; need when you have a co-op like this too. They can jump right in<br/>
to a<br/>
&gt; thriving community of homeschoolers instead of winging it on their<br/>
own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Center that we use is quite far from us, so we often do not<br/>
get to<br/>
&gt; participate in many of the activities that interest us. I wish we<br/>
could have<br/>
&gt; them in every community so that more of the wonderful<br/>
opportunities were<br/>
&gt; available to every one who want to learn for life. Not just the<br/>
hsers or<br/>
&gt; even just the kids.<br/>

Good point, Laura.<br/>
It&#39;s not about candy itself, it&#39;s about nagging and judgmentalism about<br/>
food.<br/>

My mom used to keep my cousin from having more than one glass of milk with a<br/>
meal.  It was hateful.  She really wanted more milk, that was all.  If she<br/>
ate<br/>
all her other food she MIGHT be allowed to have more milk.  But not without<br/>
her feeling nine kinds of unworthy.<br/>

You&#39;re doing the right thing, even if the transition may be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure of your situation but it might be worthwhile, during the last<br/>
couple of days at the school, for your son to collect phone numbers and<br/>
contact info for his favorite friends there. Unless distance is an issue<br/>
there&#39;s no reason to cut your son off completely from his school friends.<br/>
They can still socialize on weekends, in late afternoons, etc. as the<br/>
situation permits.<br/>

Why do you respect a PhD thesis (dissertation, written by someone with a<br/>
master&#39;s degree) more than the research done for a novel?  I&#39;m not defending<br/>
a<br/>
particular novel, just pointing out what is an interesting prejudice for an<br/>
unschooler to be showing here.<br/>
<br/>

THAT.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Hadn&#39;t heard that!  Do you have a reference?<br/>
<br/>
The other weekdays are names for Norse and Roman gods--at least the Sun and<br/>
the Moon are in the Bible! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What were the proposed replacement days?<br/>

today&#39;s Christians don&#39;t follow through. -=-<br/>
<br/>
We know fundamentalists who won&#39;t celebrate anything but Easter, and that<br/>
one<br/>
is only a Church-going day, no eggs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s being discussed here as Christian holidays and pagan holidays is<br/>
dealing just with England/English/American stuff.   The Catholic church has<br/>
been<br/>
really good about adapting local custom and giving it a religous overlay.<br/>
So<br/>
local observances were maintained but given Christian meanings. It happened<br/>
in<br/>
Rome and Greece, all over Europe.  It&#39;s still done now.  At the Pueblos on<br/>
the<br/>
northern Rio Grande they have traditional dances which have come to be<br/>
associated with Christmas and danced on Christmas eve, with the dancers<br/>
starting in<br/>
the church (or ending there).  Other dances which haven&#39;t been attached to<br/>
Christian holidays start and end in the kiva.<br/>

Right! Most of the Christian traditions are CHRISTIAN in origin.<br/>
That&#39;s what the treatise that I mention elsewhere was about. Fact is,<br/>
Catholicism was outright rejected, therefore all the feast days had<br/>
to be rejected, too...Christmas, Easter, Halloween, All Saint&#39;s Day,<br/>
all of them...are celebrations of the Lord&#39;s life or the Church&#39;s<br/>

The &#39;right&#39; was aimed at something I said, and although I agree with some of<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; I have a feeling that if people try the &quot;full candy bowl&quot;  as an<br/>
&gt;&quot;experiment &quot; and the kids pick up on the idea that this is just a<br/>
&gt;temporary thing- the<br/>
&gt;-&quot;eat it now or it will be gone again&quot; process might kick in and no one<br/>
will<br/>
&gt;have any idea if  it is possible for their family -not the parents and<br/>
&gt;certainly not the kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think that&#39;s true of unschooling and of video game playing and such too.<br/>
&gt;If the attitude of the parent is bristly suspicious hostility and an honest<br/>
&gt;HOPE that their &quot;experiment&quot; fails so that they can be proven &quot;right,&quot; it<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;work.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the parents are sincere in trying it, their unconscious attitudes<br/>
could easily be picked up by the kids. I don&#39;t think they necessarily have<br/>
to be suspicious and hostile and hoping that it won&#39;t work.<br/>

**********************<br/>
This is how I have always understood All Souls (Saints) Day.  As the<br/>
Catholic<br/>
Church expanded, they moved into countries that had Pagan celebrations at<br/>
various times of the year.  As locals (especially peasants) came to accept<br/>
the<br/>
Church (yes, I&#39;m sure it was forced on many) they began to mesh their own<br/>
Pagan<br/>
beliefs with Catholic beliefs.  Rather than have an all out rebellion, the<br/>
Church said, &quot;OK, you celebrate death and the dead this time of year, you<br/>
believe<br/>
dead souls come back to earth at this time, let&#39;s just call it &#39;All Souls&#39;<br/>
(November 1st) and we&#39;ll honor all the saints and dead that have come before<br/>
us,<br/>
pray for them, and ask them to pray for us.&quot;  Halloween = All Hallow&#39;s<br/>
(saint&#39;s) Eve = Hallow&#39;s eve = Hallow &#39;een.  Things Pagan remained on the<br/>
night<br/>
before, (carved and lighted turnips - pumpkins now), dead coming back to<br/>
roam,<br/>
etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Yes, about celebrating the resurrection.<br/>
No on &quot;Easter&quot; being of Christian origin.  When they stuck it on that<br/>
weekend, they kept the old name (in England--I don&#39;t know what they call it<br/>
in other<br/>
languages).&lt;&lt;<br/>
*******************************************<br/>
I think Easter came from the name &quot;Ostre&quot; who was a fertility goddess.<br/>
Hence, the eggs (fertility), rabbits (fertility), etc.  Another case of<br/>
pagan and<br/>
Christian mixing.<br/>
<br/>
Almost every &quot;Christian&quot; holiday was meshed with pagan beliefs.<br/>
Christmas..Christ was not born in the winter, but pagans had a huge<br/>
&quot;winterfest&quot; (Yule)<br/>
which celebrated the winter equinox (I think?).  They burned part of the<br/>
yule<br/>
log from the year before, they held holly as a sign of eternal life (doesn&#39;t<br/>
die<br/>
in the winter),...I think even mistletoe began as a pagan tradition!  Again,<br/>
the Church basically said, &quot;OK, keep your festival, but can we instead &#39;say&#39;<br/>
we&#39;re celebrating Christ&#39;s birth?  That&#39;ll make it OK.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heck, even Birthday cakes started as a gift to idols and &quot;gods&quot; originally.<br/>
Not sure what a burning cake represented, but it started pagan!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Actually, there are quite a few historians who do believe that the<br/>
Christian<br/>
<br/>
festivals are based on the Pagan festivals, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When there was a chance to commandeer an existing tradition they did so.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean things like All Saint&#39;s Day and All Hallow&#39;s Eve aren&#39;t<br/>
Christian holidays.  They are.  But if there was an existing tradition, they<br/>
got kind<br/>
of blended together.<br/>
<br/>
The eggs and bunnies stuff is sometimes used to represent Christian symbols,<br/>
when really they&#39;re from a whole separate thing originally.<br/>

<br/>
Some do.<br/>
<br/>
Every year we had the Halloween debate in the debate folder of the<br/>
homeschooling area of AOL. Every year a Christian fundamentalist would ask<br/>
what &quot;people&quot; (apparently assuming we were all fundamentalist Christians)<br/>
were doing about Halloween. Usually they had been celebrating it but had<br/>
been picking up hints that it wasn&#39;t a good thing to do. Of course they<br/>
didn&#39;t just get a fundamentalist viewpoint! So we&#39;d have the Annual<br/>
Halloween Debate.<br/>
<br/>
Some fundamentalists were conflicted. Some fundamentalists were passionately<br/>
against Halloween -- and we&#39;d have the Annual Witches Worship Satan Debate.<br/>
Some fundamentalists didn&#39;t see a problem celebrating Halloween, though I<br/>
don&#39;t remember any fundamentalists who were passionatly supportive of it.<br/>
<br/>
It probably depends on who&#39;s drawing the line on who is a fundamentalist or<br/>
&quot;true Christian&quot; and who isn&#39;t. Probably those passionately against<br/>
Halloween would feel those who didn&#39;t see a problem with Halloween weren&#39;t<br/>
&quot;true Christians.&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m not saying you would forget, just pointing out that an important part of<br/>
the experiment is choice. One of the appeals of &quot;junk&quot; food is that it&#39;s<br/>
convenient. It&#39;s easier to grab a candy bar or a bag of chips than to make a<br/>
sandwich. So when they reach their saturation point, they need other easy to<br/>

<br/>
*But* my behavior was worse when I didn&#39;t give myself permission to have as<br/>
much as I wanted. One year I bought 3 bags of Halloween candy to hand out<br/>
and ate them all before Halloween. That&#39;s because pretty much the only candy<br/>
I had each year was at Halloween. I went through 3 big bags of almond M%Ms<br/>
before I stopped craving them everytime I&#39;d see them in the store.<br/>
<br/>
This may not be an experiment you&#39;d be willing to try -- but you can&#39;t know<br/>
until you do try it! -- but I bet if you bought 5 bags of your favorite<br/>
candy and promised yourself that as you ate them you&#39;d replenish your<br/>
supply, that you&#39;d pig out for a while -- maybe for many bags -- but then<br/>
grow tired of it.<br/>
