Hello Homeschool Community!<br/>
<br/>
Spread the news!  Apple Computer, Inc. has opened it&#39;s Education<br/>
Store to Homeschools...<br/>
<br/>
Apple is now offering homeschoolers full access to it&#39;s educational<br/>
products and solutions.  As you may know Apple has provided<br/>
solutions to the education market for over two decades offering a<br/>
full range of computer hardware, peripherals, and educational<br/>
software solutions. This new offering marks the first availability<br/>
(for homeschoolers), to Apple&#39;s unique education solutions: Apple<br/>
Education Series (AES), educational software solutions; and Apple<br/>
Learning Interchange (ALI),  Apple&#39;s online resource for teaching,<br/>
learning, research, and collaboration.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers who provide Apple verification of their homeschool may<br/>
purchase directly through the Apple Store for Education<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/education/store)">http://www.apple.com/education/store)</a>.  To qualify homeschools must<br/>
provide information of their membership in a homeschool organization<br/>
who in turn will provide independent verification to Apple.<br/>
Alternatively, the homeschool may provide a confirming letter of<br/>
verification from a curriculum supplier or a local public or private<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
