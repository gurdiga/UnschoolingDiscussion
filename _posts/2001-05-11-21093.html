<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599739181">Hypoglycemia often comes about as a result of other related conditions - that is to say it is part of a complex of symptoms/conditions - it is common in any condition with which food allergies are often associated.  There is that can be done to help your son from an alternative medicine standpoint., whether he has hyperinsulinemia or not.  While M.D.&#39;s like Dr. Rapp or allergists with an alternative bent are helpful, they are not as able to address the &quot;whole&quot; person as an integrative practice with naturopaths, chiropractors, M.D.&#39;s, reflexologists, dentists, massage therapists, etc.  There are non-invasive tests that can pinpoint with amazing accuracy specific organs or areas of the body that are imbalanced - and then corrected with dietary measures or Bach flower essences or other holistic methods.  I know of a woman at one of these clinics who was able to stop antidepressants after 12 years of use.  I have found the N. D. (naturopath) much better able to address our quest for health than any M.D.<br/>
<br/>
The symptoms you describe of your son&#39;s recent behavior sounds just like the way my daughters and I act when we have low blood sugar.  Easy to cry, throw things, do not accept simple solutions/suggestions.  Try taking a food diary again - for at least a month - even if you&#39;ve done it before.  If it has been a few hours since a good solid meal (not a junky or sugary one) or if the behavior follows the ingestion of fruit, juice, or other sugars, you may have a hypoglycemic response.  <br/>
