<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But if I put her on a leash and let her sniff any <br/>
&gt; another dog, she gets to growling and nipping and won&#39;t let the other dog <br/>
&gt; sniff her.  (She weighs only 12 pounds and stands about 10 inches at the <br/>
&gt; shoulders, so she&#39;s almost always dwarfed by other dogs, so I understand <br/>
&gt; feeling intimidated.)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what can I do to make her feel comfortable around other dogs while on <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; leash?  She&#39;s 4 now and it&#39;s time for her to know better.  Sometimes I pick <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; her up and that makes her feel superior and stop growling...but the other <br/>
&gt; dog <br/>
&gt; cannot come near me, because, of course, she&#39;s trapped and protective and <br/>
&gt; goes nuts.  So, I usually pick her up and carry her away from the other <br/>
&gt; dog, <br/>
&gt; but that doesn&#39;t help her learn to accept them.  Short of obedience class, <br/>
&gt; and I shudder to think about all those other dogs there, what to do?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Height is a big deal to dogs. That&#39;s one of the reasons you&#39;ll see the <br/>
hackles go up on her neck and back---she&#39;s trying to look bigger. This is <br/>
also accomplished when she&#39;s in your arms.<br/>
<br/>
When she&#39;s on a leash and you&#39;re pulling on the lead (even just slightly), <br/>
you&#39;re making her look smaller (she&#39;s pulling and leaning, so she can&#39;t get <br/>
to her fullest height)---on her toes, shoulders raised, and hackles up---so <br/>
she becomes more.....macho....by growling and picking fights.<br/>
<br/>
How about putting a long (15-20 feet) lead on her and leaving it on the <br/>
ground---loose, very loose. If she&#39;s OK with this, you can slowly, gradually <br/>
take up on the lead until it&#39;s shorter, but still loose. Don&#39;t pull against <br/>
her; it makes her look and feel smaller.<br/>
<br/>
MOST dogs when left alone (without interfernece from humans) will establish a <br/>
pecking order with no bloodshed (there are exceptions).  <br/>

The BEST thing about classes is the presence of the other dogs! My favorite <br/>
part is to really WATCH the dogs (and humans) the first night of class and <br/>
then come back 6-8-10 weeks later and look at all of them again! Everyone&#39;s <br/>
(well, almost!) more confident and comfortable.<br/>

leash--I always leave the stretchy leash on her, lock it out all the way and <br/>
let her drag it.  (She&#39;s slower and easier to catch that way--otherwise <br/>
she&#39;ll be off and running for an hour and I usually don&#39;t want to stay that <br/>
long.)  So maybe I could try to keep up with her there while she meets other <br/>
dogs--she might feel like she&#39;s still on the leash, yet not trapped.<br/>

Seriously, it would not be pretty.  All those untrained dogs!  She would be <br/>
nuts.  I wouldn&#39;t even be able to walk into the room.  At the vet I have to <br/>
hold her in my arms and try not to let any other dogs near her.  And I&#39;m <br/>
always afraid how the other dogs will react to her.  And then there are the <br/>
idiot owners of huge dogs who are too busy talking to the staff to see that <br/>
their dog has me cornered with a snarling dog in my arms!  lol.<br/>
<br/>
I might look into the classes, but I&#39;m not hopeful.<br/>

going to go by a looooonngg leash today, and later we&#39;ll go walk by the<br/>

Oh I have to agree with this one. When we got our two pups we have now, we <br/>
knew from classes before with other dogs just what we had to do. But it was <br/>
the (dare I say the S word?) socialization that we knew was real important. <br/>
It definitely makes a difference no matter what age the dog is. Our dogs <br/>
little friend, Heidi the Boxer down the street is a typical little lady when <br/>
you see her walking. But when she sees another dog coming, she&#39;s a total <br/>
maniac! Never to been to class and we strongly suggest it everytime we see <br/>
her!!!<br/>

You have to make sure to get a good trainer. Ask around a lot and make sure <br/>
you get personal experience from people who have gone to the trainer before. <br/>
Don&#39;t do any Petsmart or pet store training. A good trainer will whip the <br/>
bad owners into shape in no time and you will find well mannered pets <br/>
because of it. The first couple of lessons will be crazy but you will see <br/>
such a difference as the weeks go by. Be prepared to be yelled at though but <br/>
have an open mind. A good trainer does know what they are talking about. One <br/>
just has to be willing to do it his way. My poor husband went through 5 <br/>
classes before he made it through one when he wasn&#39;t reprimanded!!!<br/>
