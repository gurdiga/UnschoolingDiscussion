<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602991080">Not that we are &quot;one upping&quot; each other, but when I was in school (in<br/>
England) and was 13 years old, I hated it so much I took an overdose of<br/>
asprin to get to stay home.  (I took them at school and no one saw me do<br/>
it)  I was lucky because I threw most of them up while still at school,<br/>
but was finally sent home.  I got to spend 2 days in bed and stay away<br/>
from that place but eventually had to go back.<br/>
