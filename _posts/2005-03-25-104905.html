I had a  paper one dissolve after a few days in the stuff...does that  <br/>
count?<br/>

<br/>
Dissolved the whole cup or just caused the bottom to go mushy and  leak?  <br/>
Because water will do that, in a paper cup.<br/>
 <br/>
I want to see it dissolve a tin cup, or silver, or pewter.  Pewter&#39;s  pretty <br/>
soft.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
OH.  Turkey.  Turkey does a number on silver-plate.  Turns  it dark where the <br/>
turkey sat.  Don&#39;t put turkey on silver, or not for  long.<br/>
 <br/>
I wonder if I could dissolve a nail in a turkey?<br/>
A silver nail?  SILVER BULLET!  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Curse of the Undead&quot; is a vampire movie set in the old west.  It was<br/>
made in 1968 and it&#39;s fairly hokey but it meets your qualifications. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Billy The Kid vs. Dracula&quot; from 1966 is really terrible but is *full* of<br/>
famous people, John Caradine, Harry Carey, Jr., Roy Barcroft.   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jessie James Meets Frankenstein&#39;s Daughter&quot;  also from 1966, also really<br/>
awful.  Not exactly what you wanted but thought I&#39;d mention it as an old<br/>
west monster movie.<br/>
<br/>
I think there was a Buffy episode with cowboy vampires called &quot;Bad Eggs&quot;<br/>
but if Dana Hoffman is on this list she can tell you for sure.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 ***Ben says google Quentin tarantino, George Clooney , & Samuel L <br/>
Jackson---all together. Can&#39;t remember the name.***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; not an old west movie but there&#39;s a western theme,<br/>
sort of.  There is a second and maybe a third one but I didn&#39;t see those.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not thinking of any western werewolf movies but I&#39;ll ask Dylan. <br/>

From the blurb:<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
&quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 3&quot; goes all the way back to the Old West via the<br/>
trend-of-the-decade -- a prequel.<br/>
<br/>
From Dusk Till Dawn 3 takes place in Mexico, where dashing outlaw Johnny<br/>
Madrid (Marco Leonardi) is about to be hang for his crimes when he&#39;s<br/>
suddenly rescued by an American outlaw-wannabe name Reece, who turns out<br/>
to be a girl. Before he escapes, Madrid snatches up Esmeralda (Ara Celi),<br/>
the daughter of the Hangman himself. After meeting up with his band of<br/>
merry outlaws, Madrid, Reese, and Esmeralda robs a stagecoach that has<br/>
noted American writer, and now expatriate, Ambrose Bierce inside, along<br/>
with prudish bible thumper Mary (Rebecca Gayheart) and her husband John.<br/>
After the robbery, Madrid and his men find themselves at an<br/>
out-of-the-way drinking pub/hotel, which is also the same place Ambrose<br/>
and the bible thumpers, as well as the Hangman and a small army of<br/>
Mexican Federalis on the hunt for Madrid, also end up. Before the<br/>
proverbial s--- gets a chance to hit the fan, the establishment&#39;s dancers<br/>
and owners turn out to be vampires, and it&#39;s dinnertime!<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Now I have to see it.<br/>

Not exactly, but the Kathryn Bigelow flick &quot;Near Dark&quot; (Bill Paxton amongst<br/>
others) from 1987 has been called &quot;High noon at midnight&quot;. I heard that<br/>
Bigelow wanted to make a Western but was unable to get funding at the time<br/>
so turned her attention to a vampire movie with the feel of a western. It&#39;s<br/>
quite a cool movie, despite some awkward moments with the very young boy<br/>
vampire.<br/>

I suspect he is thinking of &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; (1996) - although no Sam<br/>
Jackson. Very graphic, and one of the characters is a psycho rapist<br/>
(Tarantino) even before becoming a vampire. Also a lot of foul language -<br/>
but very funny in parts.<br/>
<br/>
Also from www.imdb.com :<br/>
<br/>
Curse of the Undead (1959)<br/>
B-grade western with a twist: mysterious gunslinger-for-hire Drake Robey is<br/>
really a vampire, and it&#39;s up to Preacher Dan to save the town and<br/>
girlfriend Dolores Carter. The cinema&#39;s first vampire Western! Young women<br/>
in a small Western town are dying one by one of an unknown ....<br/>

You are correct, Deb dear ;)  This episode includes<br/>
two wild west vampire brothers. (Just FYI, the<br/>
brother&#39;s names, Lyle and Tector Gorch, are the names<br/>
of two characters in The Wild Bunch, the 1969 western<br/>
movie directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Ernest<br/>
Borgnine and William Holden, along with Warren Oates<br/>
and Ben Johnson as Lyle and Tector Gorch (two<br/>
gunslinging brothers), respectively. It was the first<br/>
film to feature excessive movie violence as we know it<br/>
today.)<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s seen that one, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
This is the one I saw, in the 70&#39;s, and remembered.  <br/>
&quot;Billy The Kid vs. Dracula&quot; from 1966 is really terrible but is *full* of<br/>
famous people, John Caradine, Harry Carey, Jr., Roy Barcroft.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll get him that and just the regular old Werewolf movie they used <br/>
to show on TV on Saturday afternoons a couple of times a year.  I remember he <br/>
attacks gypsies at one point.  It was awful, in a kid-wonderful kind of <br/>
horrible way.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

OH!<br/>
I think I saw this one as a kid.  If there was a whorehouse that opened to <br/>
the back up side stairs...   (Oh wait; there&#39;s always a whorehouse up side <br/>
stairs...)<br/>
No really, I had a vision of the set and of one of the girls with bite marks.<br/>
