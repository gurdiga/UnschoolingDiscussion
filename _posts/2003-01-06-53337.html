 </span></blockquote>Depends on what the state requiremnts are. Here in VA we must provide results from a test every August. Tere are several ways round that for the creative mind. Parents can buy and administer the test<br/>
then send it too the company to be marked. All the state wants is a piece of paper with results on above the 23rd Stanine. They get that bit of paper but I don&#39;t test my kids.<br/>
We can also put our kids in whichever &#39;grade&#39; we feel is appropriate and test accordingly. Mine are always in Grade 1 and last year we had a blast filling in the grade one tests, maing a pattern with<br/>
the circles. Each test had a different pattern on the score chart yet each test scored in the 60th centile. Not bad :-)<br/>

Where are you?<br/>
<br/>
Some states have no such requirements.<br/>
In those with requirements there are sometimes options, and there are ALWAYS <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
If you tell us where you are, someone will be able to direct you to <br/>
information for your state.<br/>
<br/>
Some people just don&#39;t register.  Some people never register a child in a <br/>
test-requiring grade (third grade twice, then fifth, or whatever).   <br/>
<br/>
And if you DO live with annual testing requirements, here are some ideas:<br/>

<br/>
and if you&#39;re where they want a curriculum, here&#39;s what Carol Narigon (and <br/>
others since) used:<br/>

<br/>
Amazing. Perhaps we ought to pass that info along to schools <br/>
where children are failing--just make a noticeable pattern on the <br/>
answer key and improve your schools performance!<br/>
