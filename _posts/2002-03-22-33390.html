Q: How does a home schooler change a light bulb?<br/>
<br/>
A: First, mom checks three books on electricity<br/>
out of the library, then the kids make models of<br/>
light bulbs, read a biography of Thomas Edison and<br/>
do a skit based on his life. Next, everyone<br/>
studies the history of lighting methods, wrapping<br/>
up with dipping their own candles. Next, everyone<br/>
takes a trip to the store where they compare types<br/>
of light bulbs as well as prices and figure out<br/>
how much change they&#39;ll get if they buy two bulbs<br/>
for $1.99 and pay with a five dollar bill. On the<br/>
way home, a discussion develops over the history<br/>
of money and also Abraham Lincoln, as his picture<br/>
is on the five dollar bill.  Finally, after<br/>
building a homemade ladder out of branches dragged<br/>
from the woods, the light bulb is installed. And<br/>
there is light.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion:<br/>
<br/>
How does an unschooler change a light bulb?<br/>
<br/>
Mom buys a lightbulb and leaves it sitting around.  Eventually the <br/>
kid gets<br/>
tired of sitting in the dark and changes it.  :-)</div>

unschooling mom wanted the lightbulb to be changed, wouldn&#39;t she buy <br/>
the lightbulb and just change it herself, unless one of her kids <br/>
specifically asked to do it himself? <br/>
