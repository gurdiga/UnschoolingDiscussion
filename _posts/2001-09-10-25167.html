<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137801860">No. what I said was they we have a mutually agreed upon amount of writing<br/>
in the guidelines.  But since the guidelines are only loosely followed it<br/>
is not like if Rachel only write 499 words, I&#39;ll ground her.  Now, if<br/>
Rachel doesn&#39;t do ANYTHING, housework, cleaning or production (another<br/>
story) then she may get her world jiggled.  She will slip into some<br/>
unhealthy depression patterns and sometimes needs a little push to get<br/>
readjusted.  Hell, so do I but Ron knows how to jumpstart me.<br/>
<br/>
 And what you said was &quot;in one post you said you dictate what they do as<br/>
far as writing each  week&quot;  &quot;What&quot; is not the same as &quot;how much&quot;.   I<br/>
don&#39;t care WHAT they write about but I did tell Rachel that if she wants<br/>
to go to college this spreing she better get used to writing at least<br/>
that much a week.  I also told her she needs to work on getting either<br/>
her cursive or her printing legible.  DOesn&#39;t matter which but needs to<br/>
be readable by more than me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346558482">You have a depressed child and a child picking at himself and watching TV, <br/>
and still you reject all suggestions here to get them  happier, get them out <br/>
and do things with them?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I also told her she needs to work on getting either<br/>
her cursive or her printing legible.  DOesn&#39;t matter which but needs to<br/>

I would be depressed too.<br/>
<br/>
Your writing here isn&#39;t indicating any attention to your kids, and other than <br/>
depriving them and medicating them, you haven&#39;t shown or told us how you&#39;re <br/>
helping them feel light and happy.  <br/>
<br/>
Questions about why you&#39;re on this list are going unanswered.  I&#39;m concerned <br/>
that you&#39;re using it as a way to justify your methods of parenting while, at <br/>
each moment you&#39;re here writing, NOT parenting, not being with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
If you want our help, it&#39;s here, it has been before, and it will be in the <br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
If you neither want nor need any help, and since your descriptions are not <br/>
unschooling-compatible, of what use is this list to you?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So who says we don&#39;t go out and do things?  Who says I am sitting around<br/>
doing nothing about any of it?<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve told you all that we are hosting an exchange<br/>
student.  We go out frequently.  We have a houseful of interesting stuff,<br/>
 8 Acres to explore and play with.  A zooful of aminal to care for and<br/>
four in house drivers to take us to the zoo, museums, parks, etc.  Not to<br/>
mention the friends we go hang with.  But then I haven&#39;t heard YOU say<br/>
you go out either so should I just ASSUME you don&#39;t like you assumed of<br/>
me?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
ps - I&#39;m done for the day.  I have a student to pick up from school and<br/>
he is a bit freaked out to be halfway across the planet from his home in<br/>
a country that for all intents and purposes in under attack.<br/>
