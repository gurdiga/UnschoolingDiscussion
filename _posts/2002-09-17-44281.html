Even though the authorities say you have to be approved first, YOU DON&#39;T!!!! Join an accountablility association, you can get approval with one I know of within 48-72 hrs, it costs $25, and you can pull him out of school IMMEDIATELY!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034139522">Hi Virginia, <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to reluctantly follow their rules.  You just have to <br/>
make them &quot;Think&quot; that you are.<br/>
<br/>
If you want more information, I&#39;ll share some tips I learned from <br/>
another list here at Yahoo.  There are ways to make them think they <br/>
are in control, when actually you&#39;re the one calling the shots.  <br/>
<br/>
Like today, I got another visit from &quot;Caseworker&quot; who at first tried <br/>
to say they both had to go to public school.<br/>
<br/>
I then hit her with our counties statitics for the report cards and <br/>
other statistics she knew nothing about. By time she left she finally <br/>
agreed that &quot;Homeschooling&quot; seemed best for Mirial (YiPee!!! one <br/>
obstacle down, my main concern), and she wants to see what <br/>
unschooling is all about before deciding on Mariah.<br/>
<br/>
So she left with a totally changed attitude, not the kind I was <br/>
hoping for completely, but getting there.<br/>
<br/>
So now I am working on a 100 page book I plan to print out tonight, <br/>
and bind up professionally looking, for her to get educated herself <br/>
about the benefits of unschooling.  By time she finish&#39;s reading all <br/>
the info I&#39;m copying from the internet about the benefits of <br/>
homeschooling and unschooling, she&#39;ll be ready to homeschool her own <br/>
children (If she has any).<br/>
<br/>
The key is too have more knowledge than they do, and keep yourself <br/>
ahead of the game, so that when they leave they will be going &quot;Huh&quot; <br/>
what the hey was she talking about&quot; and also wondering just what laws <br/>
they may be treading on if they decide to try and push the issue.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll accomplish 1 of 2 things.  You&#39;ll either get an overworked <br/>
person too tired to research the subject temselves, and will basicaly <br/>
give up after you keep pushing more and more &quot;Knowledge&quot; that they <br/>
have to research on them. Or you&#39;ll get a caseworker that is <br/>
genuinely concerned about what&#39;s in the best interest of the <br/>
children, who will take the time to research, and if you&#39;re fighting <br/>
something you know is best, she&#39;ll admit you were right all along <br/>
<br/>
My caseworker today didn&#39;t even know my county is ranked as one of <br/>
the worst in the country.   Knowledge is power, and the more <br/>
knowledge you get, the better off you&#39;ll be.<br/>
<br/>
Oh I could share so much more, but it would take to long.  I even <br/>
confused a judge once, about a case law I brought up in court once <br/>
concerning my children, that he didn&#39;t even know existed (I won my <br/>
case).<br/>
<br/>
If you ever want to talk, just hollar :)<br/>
