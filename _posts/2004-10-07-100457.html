<div id="ygrps-yiv-107121767">Enrolling them in a Sudbury school.  Of course that would not be cheap.  Unschooling need not occur between the hours of 7:15 and 2:45.  Your child could stay with a trusted friend or relative while you&#39;re at work.  Depending on your job, and the child&#39;s age, s/he could accompany you to work.  <br/>
<br/>
If this were my situation, and my child did not want to go to school, I would find a way that she could stay out of school.  There&#39;s always a way.  It may be more difficult, but solutions are out there.<br/>

  How would you go about preparing children if they were to need to attend public school after being homeschooled or unschooled?  If something such as the mom having to return to work because of financial reasons or divorce?  What would be the least traumatic way to do this if there were no other way?<br/>

He&#39;s five and has never been away from me for very long, never for more than a few hours.  Just a possibility.  I&#39;ve been careful about the anti-school talk, and tried to be a little more positive about it.  I was a teacher and may go back to that if need be.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but it may happen at some point.  I would try other things first.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

The he&#39;s the age most kids would be going into school and it shouldn&#39;t <br/>
require any special preparation at all!<br/>
<br/>
But the point that you could find him a babysitter for the daytimes and still <br/>
homeschool are true.  There are a lot of hours in the week.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104458166">I am on the babysitter end of this. I baby-sit a 7 year old little girl. Mom<br/>
is a single mom, she is committed to homeschooling. She&#39;s not quite as<br/>
&#39;unschoolish&#39; as we are, but her daughter is part of the family while she is<br/>
here. Her mom works about 25-30 hours a week. Just enough to live on with<br/>
child support.  She doesn&#39;t have a high standard of living, but she is home<br/>
with her daughter. I earn a little extra money and get to play with a little<br/>
girl again.  We&#39;ve had her for over two years now. She gets to be involved<br/>
in more activities as she joins us in ours and she has a homeschool friendly<br/>
environment.  I&#39;ve done this in the past with another family as well until<br/>
Mom could earn enough from home to not need an outside job.  It&#39;s not easy,<br/>
but it can be done.<br/>
