<div id="ygrps-yiv-203516906">We&#39;re heading to South Carolina tonight.<br/>
<br/>
We had bad news yesterday. My mom, who has been fighting cancer for almost <br/>
six years, and doing very well, has been in the hospital for several weeks. <br/>
The cancer had spread to her brain, and she has lost most of the use of her <br/>
left side. Unfortunately, the radiation is not working, and she may be too <br/>
weak for the chemo that&#39;s been keeping her alive.<br/>
<br/>
She has decided (as of now) to cease treatment, leave the hospital, and begin <br/>
hospice. We will head down to Florida, where she will be at my sister&#39;s <br/>
house, after the conference.<br/>
<br/>
I will probably be staying, although Julian and Beth will head back north at <br/>
the end of the week. I think I will stay to help as long as I am needed. The <br/>
idea of being away from my family, and especially Julian, for a long time is <br/>
excruciating, but it feels like the right thing to do. I have already <br/>
arranged with my work (at a Unitarian Universalist church) to be away as long <br/>
as I need to.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to meeting a bunch of you this weekend.<br/>
