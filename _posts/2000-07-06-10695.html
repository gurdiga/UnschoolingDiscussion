<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170923725">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Got some good news and some bad news here concerning homelearning <br/>
developments in Japan....<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that a new, national-level homeschooling &quot;support <br/>
association&quot; has been formed recently in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is that homelearners on the whole in Japan are not exactly <br/>
out dancing in the streets in celebration of this new organization.<br/>
<br/>
Why not? Well, while it is true that the new Homeschool Support <br/>
Association of Japan, or HoSA, which is located (in Japanese) at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschool.ne.jp/">http://www.homeschool.ne.jp/</a><br/>
<br/>
is indeed a nonprofit organization targeting homelearners, it is also <br/>
true that this new association was essentially &quot;created&quot; by a private, <br/>
for-profit corporation.<br/>
<br/>
This private, for-profit corporation is the Atmark Inter-Highschool, <br/>
located....<br/>

<br/>
(Interestingly enough, Atmark prominently advertises and offers a direct <br/>
link to this new Homeschool Support Association on the company&#39;s <br/>
Japanese-language website link above -- but not on its above <br/>
English-language website.)<br/>
<br/>
The Atmark company, as some of you may have heard, is a relative newcomer <br/>
on the business scene in Japan. It was formed in spring of this year. <br/>
Atmark, under its leader -- a Japanese businessman named Mr. Kozo Hino  <br/>
-- is marketing itself as offering an American-style education and a <br/>
US-recognized diploma once Japanese students finish their courses (which <br/>
are conducted primarily on the Internet).<br/>
<br/>
Atmark can promote itself as such because it has made a tie-up with the <br/>
Alger Learning Center & Independence High School, based in Washington <br/>
state, USA. Alger&#39;s website is located at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.independent-learning.com/">http://www.independent-learning.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Alger advertises itself in major homeschooling magazines in the US as a <br/>
&quot;Washington State Approved Private School K-12&quot; and, indeed, appears to <br/>
be an officially recognized institution of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Alger&#39;s Japanese partner, Atmark, however, enjoys no such status in <br/>
Japan. Atmark definitely *is not* recognized academically in Japan by the <br/>
Ministry of Education or any other educational body in this country. The <br/>
diploma that Japanese high school students receive from Atmark may be <br/>
certifiably recognized in Washington state in the US, but it is not <br/>
recognized anywhere in Japan. <br/>
<br/>
To put it bluntly, Atmark is nothing more than a private business in <br/>
Japan, and like all other private businesses anywhere, it is bound only <br/>
by the limitations of the free market. This type of business-education <br/>
&quot;marriage&quot; of Atmark and Alger is common -- and has been common for many <br/>
years now -- among so-called educational joint ventures between the US <br/>
and Japan. Sometimes with disastrous results.<br/>
<br/>
And that is why homelearners in Japan on the whole seem to be so <br/>
suspicious and mistrustful now of Atmark&#39;s very quick moves to create <br/>
this national Homeschooling Support Association here in Japan. It is <br/>
obvious that profit is the guiding motivation here, not moral concern for <br/>
the plight of those who desire to learn at home. And in return, there <br/>
appears to be little, if any, meaningful support among the grassroots <br/>
homelearning community in Japan for Atmark&#39;s new creation, the Homeschool <br/>
Support Association of Japan.<br/>
<br/>
One cannot help but seriously wonder, at this stage, if the new <br/>
Homeschool Support Association of Japan is, in fact, anything more than a <br/>
nonprofit PR organ for the Atmark corporation itself.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of PR: This new &quot;support association&quot; in Japan has only been <br/>
in existence a matter of weeks, and yet it already has allied itself with <br/>
some very controversial and powerful friends: On 29 July 2000, Atmark&#39;s <br/>
new Homeschool Support Association of Japan will celebrate its auspicious <br/>
debut by holding a symposium in Tokyo and inviting Mr. Christopher <br/>
Klicka, senior counsel of the US-based Home School Legal Defense <br/>
Association (HSLDA), as a special guest. <br/>
<br/>
For more details on Atmark, this new &quot;support association&quot; and the <br/>
Japanese educational market, take a look at a critical review by Aileen <br/>
Kawagoe, a homelearning parent in Japan and editor of a newsletter on the <br/>
&quot;Homeschooling in Japan&quot; website. The URL to Aileen&#39;s very thorough <br/>
write-up is:<br/>

<br/>
I will try to keep you posted regularly on future developments with this <br/>
new &quot;support association&quot; here in Japan. Aileen&#39;s review is a very good <br/>
place to start in the meantime.<br/>
