<div id="ygrps-yiv-889124393">Hi Everyone<br/>
We added a few drops of food coloring to make this more exciting - might be<br/>
a bit much in the toilet bowl though!  However the best volcano was when we<br/>
added a couple drops of dishwashing liquid.  Foamed up big time! It also<br/>
lasted longer.  Goes beyond chemical reactions - but was a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
New to this list - interesting topics  Cody (7 1/2 yo) doesn&#39;t read yet and<br/>
is not at all interested in learning.  Phonics don&#39;t get it for him - just<br/>
confuse him more.  I&#39;ve read enough about late reading that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
bother me - and I make a point to let others know - he&#39;s homeschooled,<br/>
doesn&#39;t read yet, and not to expect him to - whenever he&#39;s in a situation<br/>
where it might make him feel uncomfortable (like Bible School, Library<br/>
Activities, etc)  Sometimes he will get irritated and remind us &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
know how to read, you know!&quot; if we ask him what something says, etc.  I just<br/>
point out to him that reading takes practice just like everything else and<br/>
that if his attitude as a baby had been<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t walk, you know&quot; he would still be just sittin&#39; there and if he ever<br/>
wants help learning to let me know.  So far, he would rather be read to -<br/>
probably because his interests are way beyond what his early reading would<br/>
support.<br/>
His older brother and sister were late readers too, in spite of all that<br/>
&quot;intervention&quot; in public school.  My niece was reading at a 5th grade<br/>
&quot;level&quot; in 1st grade - but she&#39;s not reading at a Graduate school &quot;level&quot; in<br/>
7th grade, so I believe all these things balance out in the end.<br/>
Sorry about the novella!  Hope you all like to read!<br/>
Relax and enjoy your child&#39;s discovery of the world!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Becky,<br/>
  Welcome to the list.  It&#39;s nice to know that phonics confuses someone<br/>
else. My mil thinks I must be wrong when I say that phonics makes no sense<br/>
to my now 9 year old. :)  I also have a 7. 5 year old who has no interest in<br/>
reading either.  Now, taking things apart, that he can do for hours and<br/>
hours, not to mention playing video games.<br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome!<br/>

Where are you in OH?<br/>
I appreciate the comments about your children- - it helps me get it all back<br/>
in perspective.  I, too,  have used the &#39;learn to walk&#39; comparison.<br/>
And we all love to read in our house!!<br/>

the red food coloring but never thought about the dishwashing liquid! <br/>
thanks for the fun idea!<br/>
