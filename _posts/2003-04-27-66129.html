<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242454534">I have a question for you MA unschoolers.  I have been curious about <br/>
how you do your ed plans and what sort of evaluation do you check <br/>
off.  I hear you need to chose one method.  I am a little concerned  <br/>
because my son has PDD (mild autism).  He is way behind what would be <br/>
considered normal for his age and I don&#39;t want to get on the radar <br/>
screens of the school officials (ie. he is 8.5 and still doesn&#39;t <br/>
count accurately over 5).  Do you have any suggestions on how to go <br/>
about this without giving too much information?  Do you know anyone <br/>
unschooling special needs kids in MA?  We are still in HI, but are <br/>
hoping to move to MA by this fall.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been a while since I looked over the information but I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
the wording of the case law mentions they want to see progress not meeting a<br/>
specific standard.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s also wording about providing an equivalent education, meaning<br/>
you have to cover the same subjects. They don&#39;t say how and learning from<br/>
life is acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
Check with Mass Home Learners Association (http://www.mhla.org). If they<br/>
don&#39;t have anything specifically about special needs, they sponsor two email<br/>
lists where you can ask. You might want to mention you&#39;re unschooling since<br/>
the list is a mixture of methods.<br/>

Thanks for your help.  I&#39;m already on the MHLA list.  What is the other one you are talking about?  I already have Carol&#39;s letter and am planning to tweak it a bit for our purposes.  I&#39;m feeling better about this already, knowing there are others like me out there! :)  Kristin<br/>

 </span></blockquote>MHLA used to have 2 lists. Maybe they dropped one since the second isn&#39;t<br/>
necessary any more. It was split in 2 when the Bryants -- I don&#39;t know if<br/>
you&#39;ve heard of them -- were going through their court battles. The case<br/>
kind of took over the list so it split off into 2 so the case (and other<br/>
legal issues) could be on one and homeschooling could be on the other..<br/>

I joined that list last week, but there didn&#39;t seem to be much activity.  I was wondering if that list had anything different about it.  Would it be a good idea to subscribe again?  What do you think?  Kristin<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068729728">It&#39;s never very busy, but sometimes more than others.  I don&#39;t really<br/>
pay attention to which of the two lists I&#39;m getting messages from, so I<br/>
couldn&#39;t tell you if one&#39;s better than the other.  Being on both doesn&#39;t<br/>

interesting comes up.  ~Rue<br/>
