  One of my favorite hobbies is cutting perfectly good fabric into little<br/>
  pieces and then sewing it back together again in geometric patterns.  It<br/>
  sounds pretty silly when I describe it like that.  And I&#39;m not doing it<br/>
  to keep anyone warm at night.<br/>

Oh, I may have expressed it badly, and I was being strange in my<br/>
description.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking about piecing quilts.  I don&#39;t often get past that step<br/>
and make a finished quilt.  And I make small ones.   (In theory because<br/>
I can finish them faster, maybe before I lose interest.)<br/>
