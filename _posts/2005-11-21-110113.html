<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388874471">&quot;Indigo is a documentary from this year&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s the &quot;Indigo&quot; I watched, it&#39;s not a documentary at all. Just a <br/>
low budget, fictional story about a child with Indigo qualities. OH, <br/>
except she has the ability to heal (like instantly), see the future <br/>
and other such unscientific gifts.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a sweet story, but NOT a documentary by any stretch...unless <br/>
there&#39;s another one I don&#39;t know about.<br/>
It&#39;s certainly not a high quality film either.<br/>
<br/>
I always thought the Indigo stuff was good, because maybe it would <br/>
help parents to start seeing their children in a positive light and <br/>
helping them treat these children with respect.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recommended the book....it has great potential. There&#39;s a lot of <br/>
parts that make me go &quot;hmmmmm&quot; though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t they do that without an overlay of weird beliefs, though?   Can&#39;t a <br/>
person be respected without the belief that she&#39;s come from another plane <br/>
mystically to heal the world?   <br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t a parent simply treat her child respectfully without &quot;a reason&quot;?   <br/>
<br/>
This morning&#39;s news show didn&#39;t mention homeschooling; I was relieved.<br/>
Apparently the one family interviewed has kids in school.   The oldest of <br/>
three, a girl, was asked how her friends at school treated her.   She said &quot;My <br/>
friends don&#39;t act like I&#39;m higher, and I don&#39;t act like they&#39;re lower.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Apparently she&#39;s been told she IS &quot;higher,&quot; though.   I can&#39;t imagine that <br/>
that won&#39;t affect her negatively.   It seems a problem in this:   Either she can <br/>
believe what her parents are investing so much time and energy in, and <br/>
believe she&#39;s a higher form of life, or she can settle on being &quot;just&quot; a normal <br/>
person, and have to judge her parents as having been wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The youngest girl has said she used to be her mom&#39;s mom, so they believe her <br/>
to be the reincarnation of her grandmother.   She knows details (&quot;Facts,&quot; the <br/>
mom said) that she couldn&#39;t have known if it were true--facts of the death and <br/>
the way the body was treated after, and also facts of between that death and <br/>
her rebirth.    So... she knows &quot;facts&quot; of before she was born.    Okay.   If <br/>
the mom hasn&#39;t been there and the daughter is considered by the mom to be a <br/>
higher being, then what the daughter has reported is considered &quot;fact&quot;?   And <br/>
the daughter reminded her mom that she/daughter knows facts about God, from that <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
I just think it&#39;s a waste of the parents&#39; time and energy, and too much weird <br/>
pressure on the kids.   They could live a   happy life together and nurture <br/>
and encourage without labelling them new-and-different, special, saviors of <br/>
mankind.   <br/>
<br/>
If I had a kid remembering a past life, I&#39;d take notes for her, maybe take <br/>
her visiting to the places she was describing if possible, and store up what she <br/>
said in case it faded.   Isn&#39;t that enough?   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924591136">On principle, this goes well beyond Indigo to other perspectives one <br/>
could bring children up with, such as sports, academics, fame, fortune,<br/>
<br/>
social standing and so on, all of which can be just as unrealistic in <br/>
their own way as Indigo.  Many parents try to dream up the life they <br/>
wish they&#39;d had in their children&#39;s lives.  All it takes is <br/>
unthoughtfulness in key areas to block the genuine flow of parent/child<br/>
<br/>
love, and any ideal can overlay children&#39;s lives with a filter of <br/>
expectations.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing: the love that&#39;s there is no longer without condition. <br/>
Most children are &quot;Indigo&quot; or high enough to understand that in order<br/>
to <br/>
live with parents&#39; delusions they must do a certain amount of propping <br/>
and acting or lose the regard their parents *are* offering.<br/>
<br/>
If parents could find it in themselves to avoid the trap of encouraging<br/>
<br/>
their kids to &quot;earn&quot; respect through good behavior / who they become / <br/>
what they accomplish or attain, their kids would, first of all, have a <br/>
much easier time liking themselves without doing unwise things to <br/>
&quot;prove&quot; self worth.  Shoot, I have a huge school debt (unwise thing I <br/>
racked up) trying to prove my worth but no degree because that&#39;s not <br/>
what I wanted.  Insisting that children earn respect might result in <br/>
completely unnecessary hardships.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate how Sandra put it --simply treating your child<br/>
respectfully <br/>
without needing a reason to.  One of the greatest things in the world<br/>
is <br/>
being totally adored for no reason at all.  Wonderful gift; everybody <br/>
benefits.<br/>

<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought of that!<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;indigo children&quot; have to keep on being spiritually impressive or  <br/>
their parents will probably find causes for their falling from indigo  <br/>
grace or something.<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger I was really fascinated by reincarnation stories-- <br/>
not the kind that psychics and hypnotists foist on people, but those  <br/>
told by very young girls.  Always girls. &lt;g&gt;  (I didn&#39;t read about  <br/>
any boys having those memories.)  And in some cases, especially in  <br/>
India where it wasn&#39;t heretical to suggest it, parents sometimes  <br/>
helped the child find the place she was remembering.   There was a  <br/>
story in Canada of a woman who described a life and a house and a  <br/>
farm, and people helped her find it.  Found the house&#39;s ruins just as  <br/>
she had described the layout, where the well was, etc.   I liked  <br/>
those stories, but there was nothing to change my life about, and it  <br/>
didn&#39;t make me feel inferior that I didn&#39;t have vivid past-life  <br/>
memories of my own, because they also seemed to come along after  <br/>
violent or unhappy deaths.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I remember, though, was the stories fading after the kids  <br/>
were a little older, and them not remembering any more if the parents  <br/>
asked them about it when they were seven or ten.  All gone.<br/>
<br/>
Might happen with &quot;indigos&quot; too, that they&#39;re so identified because  <br/>
the parents are surprised to see some extra-sensory leanings in very  <br/>
young children, and then as might be absolutely natural, they move  <br/>
more into the regular normally-sensed world at large.   For them to  <br/>
possibly be marked then &quot;former indigos&quot; or &quot;ruined indigos&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;indigos who didn&#39;t concentrate and live up to their potential&quot; is  <br/>
sad.  One more opportunity to fail.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t it ok to be highly sensitive or incredibly aware without it<br/>
having <br/>
to be spiritual or &quot;overliness?&quot;  Why couldn&#39;t it just be considered <br/>
high on a normal spectrum of ordinary life?<br/>
<br/>
As far as that goes, I would much rather be a fairy than an Indigo or <br/>
somebody&#39;s idea of an entity.  Isn&#39;t Indigo just another way of saying<br/>
a <br/>
being that might not really exist, that hasn&#39;t been proven to exist? <br/>
And aren&#39;t the people who sense things like goblins, ghosts, fairies, <br/>
and other ethereal beings supposed to be rather special themselves? <br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the real point.  The parents are special.<br/>

Cameron did this a LOT. Duncan too, but to a much lesser degree. I could have labeled them &quot;Indigo&quot; if I wanted to. Up to age five or so, we heard these *elaborate* stories of past lives and &quot;pre-lives&quot; from him.<br/>
 <br/>
Mostly we just enjoyed them---they were fantastic. I should have written them down.<br/>

We were at a new-agey Christmas party last year (probably a Holiday party, actually). Very busy. Lots of people. I was approached to help get the Indigo movie shown at the local independent theatre because Ben & Cameron volunteer there and we know the folks there.<br/>
 <br/>
But while in the kitchen, one of the host&#39;s sons (nine-ish? ten-ish?) came up and started telling his mom a long detailed story---out of the blue of a past or future something he&#39;d &quot;seen&quot;----she stopped everything to listen to him. THAT was cool to me. That she stopped everything to listen to him. But it was (to me) as if he were forcing this story out---that it would MAKE her stop and pay attention to him. That *maybe* that was the only time she DID pay attention. <br/>
 <br/>
I hope not.<br/>
 <br/>
And I hope he can live up to his potential.<br/>
