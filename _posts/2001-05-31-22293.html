<div id="ygrps-yiv-517279801">Thought folks might get a kick out of being part of big business.  We are<br/>
looking at property to buy, &quot;in the boonies&quot; as we have had it with city<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
In my meanderings around the net looking at property with acreage, I&#39;ve<br/>
learned lots about the real estate game.  &quot;Cute&quot; means small, &quot;unique&quot; means<br/>
bizarre or built without any seeming logic, &quot;small&quot; means tiny and quite<br/>
frequently &quot;fixer&quot; means bulldoze and start over.  I now know that<br/>
&quot;Serendipitious Tranquility&quot; means hours away from anything that vaguely<br/>
resembles civilization:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;AND THAT&#39;S NOT ALL............ There are so many possibilities with this<br/>
property. Let me list a few for you to consider.<br/>
1. Artists abode<br/>
2. Writer&#39;s retreat<br/>
3. Winter wonderland<br/>
4. Summer sancturary<br/>
5. Retirement ranchette<br/>
6. Woodworkers whittle<br/>
7. Photographers fantasy<br/>
8. Ultimate urban unwind<br/>
9. Organic gardeners graze<br/>
10. Homeschooling habitat for a new family&quot;<br/>
<br/>
See, now homeschooling is a way to sell real estate &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183498332">Northern CA, Southern Oregon.  Places with *real* trees &lt;g&gt;  Not too far<br/>
from the coast and close to a lake of some nature.  We&#39;re going looking next<br/>
week and have a few places lined up to look at.  My fav has 160 acres,<br/>
hubby&#39;s fav has 40 acres and the kidlets want the one that has only 7.5<br/>
acres but has a house plus two cabins.  They figure they will get the<br/>
cabins.  Personally, I&#39;m thinking one of the cabins would be real nice for<br/>
all my craft stuff and hubby&#39;s music &lt;g&gt;<br/>

as many cabins as you want... eventually.  (Provided at least a smidge of<br/>
the land is reasonably flat and dry.)<br/>
