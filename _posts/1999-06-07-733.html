&gt;&lt;&lt;  My mother is having a fit about me hsing my<br/>
&gt; 5 year old daughter. I don&#39;t see how she can do that, when she homeschooled<br/>
<br/>
&gt; my little sister who just graduated at the WHO ceremony on May 23rd.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt;Tanya,<br/>
&gt;If you dont mind me asking....how does she explain her reasoning that she <br/>
<br/>
&gt;homeschooled your sister but you can&#39;t homeschool your daughter?  <br/>

 I have no clue! I guess she thinks I am not capable of &#39;teaching&#39; my daughter.<br/>
She didn&#39;t take the time to actually &#39;teach&#39; my sister, she went through WHO,<br/>
and had a certified woman give her assignments, etc.<br/>
 I&#39;m not sure if I explained this earlier, but nothing I do is good enough for<br/>
my family. My husband and I had a rocky first 4 years. Now that we are &quot;fully&quot;<br/>
back together, they cannot accept that. Just to give you a clue how bad my Dad<br/>
is, we had a surprise party for my husband last month, my Dad sat in the car<br/>
the whole time, while my mother and sister came in to wish him a happy birthday!<br/>
Sweet, huh?! Anyways, I&#39;m done babbling.<br/>
