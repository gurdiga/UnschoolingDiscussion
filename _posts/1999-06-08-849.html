 </span></blockquote>Well put, Mary Ellen.  I wrote up a &quot;learning plan&quot; for Nicholas<br/>
last year after our holiday to the Rockies.  This was not<br/>
required but it was a fun exercise.  I put down things the kids<br/>
had spontaneously done already - before, during and after the<br/>
holiday - which I thought could be presented in the kind of form<br/>
which would, as you say, &quot;look good&quot;.  Every once in awhile I do<br/>
this and stash it in a folder in case some disgruntled neighbour<br/>
thinks we&#39;re not providing a suitable educational program. I&#39;ve<br/>
done this writing up excercise when the kids were deeply involved<br/>
in their &quot;Redwall&quot; phase, during our Shakespearean productions,<br/>
during baseball season, etc. I&#39;ll paste the trip example below<br/>
because it&#39;s shortest.  <br/>
<br/>
(Please note that if we had actually written this up before the<br/>
trip and asked the kids to do these things, they probably never<br/>
would have covered half of this stuff.)  <br/>

-------------------------------------<br/>
BC Travel Unit STudy Plan<br/>
<br/>
Before the Trip:  <br/>
<br/>
-Map routes and estimate travel time; mileage; gas expense<br/>
-Read up on attractions and seasonal things to do <br/>
-Prioritize wish list for itinerary<br/>
<br/>
(Involves reading for information, math, geography, personal<br/>
planning)<br/>
<br/>
On the Road:<br/>
<br/>
-Note terrain in relation to roads<br/>
-Note where routes follow course of rivers<br/>
-Note wildlife sightings and what type of habitat where spotted<br/>
-Note changes in vegetation<br/>
-Play the &quot;licence plate game&quot; to keep track of where people came<br/>
from to get to where we are<br/>
<br/>
After the Trip:<br/>
<br/>
-Check travel times, mileage and cost of travel against estimates<br/>
-Look up location of license plates spotted on the map.  <br/>
-Which cars were from farthest away in each direction?  <br/>
-Did we see cars from more places than we did on our trip to<br/>
Oregon last year?  <br/>
-Follow up on any interests sparked during the trip <br/>
-Look up answers to any questions not answered while on the road <br/>
-Organize, notate and mount photographs in an album<br/>
<br/>

Things to Follow Up on inspired by the trip:<br/>
<br/>
-&quot;Overlanders&quot; - who were they?  <br/>
-Why so many references to Overlanders on the Yellowhead Hwy<br/>
north of Kamloops?<br/>
-Thompson and Fraser - the people and the rivers named after them<br/>
-Further investigation of icefields and glaciers<br/>
-How did Rogers ever find the pass?  -How did he chart his<br/>
course?<br/>
-Read Pierre Burton&#39;s &quot;Last Spike&quot; as a family read aloud<br/>
-Research the mating habits of Elk<br/>

takes place all the time, even when we don&#39;t set out to learn something.<br/>
