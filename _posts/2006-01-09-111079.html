<div id="ygrps-yiv-593723323">My 6 yo daughter recently (last week) was on a walk with my dh and <br/>
his mom and she picked up a hypodermic needle off the street and in <br/>
the process poked herself.  I never thought to tell my kids not to <br/>
touch needles.  I have syringes with out needles in the house for <br/>
measuring liquid medications and so my kids have been around these <br/>
all their lives.  She never even considered that it would hurt her <br/>
to touch it I am sure.  <br/>
<br/>
Many comments have been made by family and others (dr.s, nurses <br/>
etc.) since then like &quot;I hope she learned her lesson&quot;.  I am at a <br/>
loss as to what to say about this and these comments.  I don&#39;t in <br/>
anyway feel at 6 years old that she is to blame for what happened <br/>
and if there is any blame to go around maybe it is mine for never <br/>
telling her not to touch.  <br/>

My kids are very inquisitive and are always picking up something.  I <br/>
don&#39;t want my kids to be hands off to everything, nor do I want to <br/>
scare them to death with all the things that could &quot;possibly&quot; <br/>
happen.  How do ya&#39;ll handle it with the things you say to your <br/>
children about things that may harm them.  I don&#39;t want to tell them <br/>
things that are untrue dangers either.  I hope that this made <br/>
sense.  Any advice is welcome.  My kids are 11, 10, 8, 6, 5<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128077416">That&#39;s a toughie because it&#39;s one of those in-a-moment things where <br/>
your DH and his mom would probably have stopped it if they had seen <br/>
it coming but it was over by the time a reaction could occur.<br/>
<br/>
Our general rule o&#39; thumb is &#39;pointy stuff&#39; should be evaluated <br/>
before picking it up - whether it&#39;s glass, pins, needles, scissors, <br/>
knives, etc. In some cases, like scissors, he&#39;s able to handle them <br/>
by himself and has for a while. But, if we spot broken glass <br/>
someplace (your DD sounds like my DS - they want to clean up stuff <br/>
that has been littered around), he gets our attention to it first <br/>
and we check it out together and determine if we can pick it up and <br/>
take it to the trash without harm to ourselves. Away from the <br/>
situation, in general conversations, we&#39;ve talked about germs and <br/>
cuts and things as situations come up (typically it&#39;s when he&#39;s <br/>
fallen and scuffed himself and we&#39;re patching things together). A <br/>
general &#39;be safe&#39; concept and &#39;call us if you aren&#39;t sure&#39; tied <br/>
together seems to work. This might be a time when you discuss the <br/>
idea of bio-hazards with the kids, maybe using something like colds -<br/>
 you wash hands and don&#39;t use someone else&#39;s cup or re-use their <br/>
Kleenex if they&#39;re sick, that sort of thing. Then expand it to the <br/>
idea of &#39;you don&#39;t know where it&#39;s been and whether the person who <br/>
used it was sick&#39; (and generalize sick rather than get into the <br/>
scary stuff which immediately jumps to a grownups mind).<br/>

<br/>
I guess I should have included that.  I already took her to the E.R. <br/>
for blood work and to be evaluated the day of the stick.  She is on <br/>
meds for HIV and Hepatitis.  She will have to be on it for 28 days <br/>
or until we can get the owner (which we know now who that is) <br/>
tested.  The lady is not in much of a hurry to get tested and I am <br/>
none to happy about that, cause the longer she waits the longer my <br/>
daughter has to take these meds that have pretty severe side <br/>
effects.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176981630">If you know who the needle belonged to  you might consider local or state<br/>
statutes regarding safe disposal and her liability for failing to dispose<br/>
properly.   Worry about liability might nudge her cooperation!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That said..my opinion would be that you encourage your children to look<br/>
carefully before handling whether it be needles or pieces of wood or broken<br/>
glass or rocks/logs that might be harboring biting/stinging beasties.    Age<br/>
6 also   probably not too young to address the issue of treating all blood<br/>
as potentially dangerous......the days of children becoming &quot;blood brothers&quot;<br/>
or helping each others boo-boos with spit  or even proving their mettle by<br/>
picking off scabs need to become a thing of the past.     No way for that to<br/>
happen without providing information.    <br/>

safe ways to explore working with combustibles instead of just saying &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
touch&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t pick up&quot;,  &quot;don&#39;t, don&#39;t, don&#39;t&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705974929">Vicky;  your right about the disposal of sharps.  Whenever a <br/>
pharmacists gives out needles for a diabetic or other needs, they must <br/>
give them a red sharps container.  That container must be sealed with <br/>
duct tape once full.<br/>
<br/>
She can be held accountable for not disposing of the needles <br/>

You can place some pressure on her that you could report her to the <br/>

Well initially she was pretty nonchalant about the whole thing and <br/>
didn&#39;t even apologize.  I did report her and the sheriff&#39;s office <br/>
sent an officer to her house to inquire about the tests.  She said <br/>
she would have them done.  I called her last night and she said she <br/>
did the tests on Fri and would call me today with the results.  <br/>
However I am requesting the the results be sent to my daughters <br/>
doctor so that we know for sure.  I am not willing to just take her <br/>
word for it.<br/>
<br/>
I have already talked a little to my daughter, but I think the <br/>
advice I recieved is right.  I am gonna explain to them the possible <br/>
dangers that germs and diseases pose.  I am going to readdress the <br/>
not handling things that are dirty in that way and that if they are <br/>
unsure about then they need to ask me or their dad.  They are still <br/>
young enough that I don&#39;t feel that this is unreasonable.  When they <br/>
get older they will hopefully be better at making the judgment as to <br/>
whether something is safe to handle or not.  In the mean time I need <br/>
to help them so that we can cut down on accidents that could have <br/>
been prevented.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all so much for your thoughts on this situation.  Ya&#39;ll <br/>
are so great at putting things in a different perspective for me.  I <br/>
am learning not to panic as often and to think things through a <br/>
little more logically and level headed.<br/>
