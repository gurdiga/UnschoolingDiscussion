<div id="ygrps-yiv-454629044">&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t expect a 3 yo to understand that at all.  I&#39;d  scoop up the  <br/>
baby <br/>
and distract him for a little while, then, when no  one was using the TV,  <br/>
I&#39;d <br/>
take him in there and let him press the  button as many times as he  wished.  <br/>
I <br/>
might ask my 3 yo to ask  me to come get the baby instead of  holding his <br/>
hand <br/>
over the button,  though.<br/>
<br/>
If the baby was so intent on pressing that button that he  screamed and  <br/>
cried <br/>
when I scooped him up, I&#39;d find him another TV or  other button to push  that <br/>
had similar  excitement.<br/>

I typed a response to this but it got deleted when my 5 yr old signed onto  <br/>
another program.<br/>
The short and skinny of what i wrote was...<br/>
I don&#39;t *expect my 3 yo to understand, he does understand. The tv clicking  <br/>
was a game he and the 16 mo have played for a couple weeks. Cameron (16 mo)  is <br/>
getting that Nicholas isn&#39;t laughing as much and he is getting that it isn&#39;t  <br/>
as much fun..<br/>
 <br/>
Being that Cameron is #4 and that this is a growth step the last three  took, <br/>
I know it will pass. Scooping him up (in this situation) would IMO be  <br/>
putting more focus on the situation then need be. Nor would it be something  Cameron <br/>
understood why mommy dealt with it in such a way. So i wouldn&#39;t  scoop in <br/>
this situation I would however distract and get in between the tv and  Cameron. <br/>
Cameron and Nicholas both know it was a game they  enjoyed and Cameron gets <br/>
that Nicholas isn&#39;t laughing so the situation has  dropped down to yesterday <br/>
being a 30 second situation. So far this am it hasn&#39;t  been an issue. Had I <br/>
scooped him yesterday it would be something he would be  doing today while grinning <br/>
at me. <br/>
 <br/>
My (deleted) post contained more info regarding Cameron and walking which  is <br/>
part of the family enjoyment of him growing because so many others expressed  <br/>
concern over him not walking since 1 yr- 15 mo. So to sum it all up between  <br/>
Nicholas and Cams tv game and Cameron&#39;s proud walk to the tv it&#39;s all  <br/>
good..really  <br/>
 <br/>
I think consistently being a parent to 4 children each needs to grow,  <br/>
explore (I don&#39;t mean hurt each other)and realize that each one will go  through <br/>
their stages. Not all react to situations the same. Therefor a  parent needs to <br/>
know the child enough to know the motive. For this  situation there was no ill <br/>
intent simply two brothers learning about each others  personal boundaries. <br/>
