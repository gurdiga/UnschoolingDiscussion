 </span></blockquote>Tracy:<br/>
I have a diabetic older male cat who&#39;s doing extremely well on a raw food<br/>
diet.  After he became diabetic, I looked at what he had been eating all<br/>
his life (canned food or dry food) and thought, how would I do on a diet<br/>
of only canned or dry food? (Answer -- I&#39;d be sick, too!)  I found a book<br/>
by Anitra Frazier &quot;The New Natural Cat&quot; and she has recipes for a good cat<br/>
diet, plus recipes for your cat if he or she has certain illnesses.  The<br/>
diets usually involve throwing raw meat with rice or oatmeal and broccoli<br/>
into a blender a few times a week, but for us, its been worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
