<div id="ygrps-yiv-288079315">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m just jumping in here as I am new to this list.  We&#39;ve built the<br/>
sunflower/morning glory house several times...it is always beautiful!  We<br/>
love Sharon Lovejoy&#39;s books and have found some wonderful garden ideas in<br/>
her books.  A couple of other good books are A Garden for Children by<br/>
Felicity Bryan  and Magical Gardens (Myth,Mulch and Marigolds) by Patricia<br/>
Monaghan.  When we built the sunflower house I had found a sunflower teapot<br/>
with cups to go with it and we would have tea or juice in our teapot...I<br/>
even had a tablecloth to spread on the ground from sunflower fabric...Dd<br/>
thought it was quite magical.<br/>
Another must have book is Cultivating Sacred Space: Gardening for the Soul<br/>
by Elizabeth Murray...this book is beautiful and filled with lovely pictures<br/>
of gardens, some with children. Murray talks about transforming our own<br/>
private gardens into places that satisfy our need for the sacred, for play,<br/>
for meditation and for connecting with the earth.<br/>
<br/>
We are an unschooling family of a single daughter aged 12.  She has always<br/>
unschooled except for a brief stint in a waldorf kindergarden.  It was her<br/>
choice to unschool.  She is involved in all sorts of things: she studies<br/>
violin with a woman that is also in a rock band called Band of Humans, rides<br/>
horses, snowboards, takes pottery class, watercolor paints with a magical<br/>
woman, and is on a youth competitive team for kungfu with her master being a<br/>
2x chinese all around gongfu champion.  She competed in the internation<br/>
competition for kungfu this past August and won two gold medals.  Before she<br/>
studied martial arts she was enrolled in a pre-professional ballet school in<br/>
Hartford, CT for 4 years.  Her ballet training has really helped with her<br/>
martial arts ability.<br/>
<br/>
We live in CT on the edge of a 24,000 acre forest.  We keep a few chickens,<br/>
have a psychotic Border Collie and a very uppity cat.  We love sustainable<br/>
living, biodynamic gardening, alternative house structures (espec. cob<br/>
houses), folk music and contradancing, camping, drumming, bonfires and  the<br/>
idea of creating community.  I am a licensed RN, Massage Therapist, Reiki<br/>
Master, Herbalist, and flower essence practitioner.  Dh is a master<br/>
woodworker/carpenter and would discuss history with anyone who has a minute.<br/>
We would love to find a way to create an eco-village with folks that have a<br/>
similar interest!<br/>
Looking forward to meeting others here in this forum.<br/>

&gt; I would also love to build a sunflower/morning glory house.  You plant<br/>
&gt; sunflower seeds around the perimeter of the house.  Then you plant<br/>
&gt; morning glory seeds around each sunflower (6 or so).  The morning<br/>
&gt; glories will climb up the sunflowers and you can weave them, if you<br/>
&gt; want a more solid wall.  Then when it gets tall enough, you put<br/>
&gt; string between the sunflowers to make a support for the roof (which<br/>
&gt; is more morning glories).  I just wish I had room for all this!!<br/>
