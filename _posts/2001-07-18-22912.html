 P.S.  (But, to be fair, I have 7 charming nieces and nephews who went to<br/>
 public school and they are all lovely people, so I should cut back on the<br/>
 sweeping stereotypes.  One of these days...   &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

kind and considerate self. Proves to me she is too impressionable of a <br/>
personality to go to school. Plus my nephews are rude and snappy 2 w/ each <br/>
sister in law and in different parts of the state. Blech!<br/>
<br/>
   Time will heal this I know. Unfortunately yesterday was a yucky day for <br/>
us. Today is another go at it.<br/>
