<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092410368">Boy I wish I could move there.  My children have to have 900 hours of <br/>
&quot;schooling&quot;.  We do so much deschooling and unschooling and the way they <br/>
learn 24-7 I am sure that they are getting the hours that they need.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102925546">Does anyone know of any group rates for health insurance for single parents <br/>
that homeschool?  I will be giving up my job and the insurance is a big <br/>
concern of mine.  It will cost me $400 month to have health insurance with my <br/>
present company.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693911969">Where I live I am lucky my children and I are still eligable for a medicard <br/>
from the department of human services.  I know there are alot of different <br/>
programs that do cover children for free.  Call the human services place and <br/>
see.  Just an idea to get the kids coverage.  I hope I didn&#39;t offend anyone.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944209346">My kids are on medicaid because they are adopted and special needs.  I just <br/>
need coverage for myself.  I can contnue my coverage for 12 months, <br/>
supposedly at a reduced rate, but that is $400/month.  I can&#39;t afford that.  <br/>
I am 52 and am afraid to try to go without health insurance for myself.<br/>
