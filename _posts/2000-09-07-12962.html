&gt; be precise) I have *never* seen a productive discussion on the topic<br/>
&gt; of spanking.  Never once has someone who is against spanking decided<br/>
&gt; that it was okay for *anyone* to spank their child.  I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
&gt; anyone who is for spanking decide that perhaps their method of<br/>
&gt; discipline needed changing.  Instead what I have seen is what<br/>
&gt; happened here, the original poster felt misunderstood, and usually<br/>
&gt; gets defensive.  Others get angry at the thought of a child being<br/>
&gt; hurt or at the thought of someone judging their parenting techniques.<br/>
&gt; Emotions run high on both sides of the issue.  When it all dies down,<br/>
&gt; people are hurt, their feelings of trust in each other has been<br/>
&gt; eroded. Some people leave the list in hurt and/or anger.  Others<br/>
&gt; decide it is best if they become lurkers.  The end result is the<br/>
&gt; wisdom that each of us can gain from this list is diminished.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is why Lynda and others were hesitant to continue this<br/>
&gt; discussion.<br/>
