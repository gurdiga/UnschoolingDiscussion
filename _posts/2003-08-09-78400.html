&gt; <br/>
&gt; How to be less clique-ish? I don&#39;t have all the answers I am just pointing<br/>
&gt; out something I see and others have seen. I also see the very people who are<br/>
&gt; the most insular (since the word clique is offensive to many) as being the<br/>
&gt; most defensive about it. One of the hallmarks of this group is that people<br/>
&gt; ask new people to question everything. If we are supposed to question our<br/>
&gt; motives, thoughts, feelings and actions why are people getting so defensive<br/>
&gt; about new members pointing out something they see??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing I have noticed for many years is that every group or organization I <br/>
have ever been associated with has, at one time or another, been accused of <br/>
being cliqueish. This includes feminist groups, churches, lists, etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hard to plunge into a new place, and that it&#39;s easy to feel like <br/>
an outsider. Similarly, when you&#39;ve been around a place a while, it&#39;s easy to <br/>
get caught up with people who have become friends, sometimes accidentally <br/>
excluding new people. New people in any group don&#39;t know the old stories or the <br/>
old jokes or acroynms. <br/>
<br/>
I often feel like an outsider because some of the demographics of my life are <br/>
very different from others on this list. Probably everyone else feels that <br/>
way too. Doesn&#39;t mean that I &gt;am&lt; an outsider, or that anyone here has ever <br/>
tried in any way to exclude me. <br/>
<br/>
Nancy, what I hear you saying is that some responses to people feel harsh. <br/>
Sometimes (but I think very rarely) that might be true. Remember...ain&#39;t no <br/>
perfect people here. Mostly what I think really happens, though, is that <br/>
particularly people who&#39;ve been unschooling for a while feel VERY protective of it, and <br/>
are very directive in their responses to people who question it.<br/>
<br/>
But if not here, where? This list is for unschooling. For me, if someone came <br/>
in and said &quot;We&#39;re unschooling except for math,&quot; but got it when we explained <br/>
it doesn&#39;t work that way I&#39;d feel much more patient. We might be able to <br/>
point out all the learning their kids do and help them, if they wanted to, to <br/>
become real unschoolers. If they didn&#39;t want to, but still were interested in <br/>
hanging out to learn how to be a gentler parent, or how to support learning in <br/>
general, they&#39;d probably get a lot out of it.<br/>
<br/>
But if they keep arguing that using math books is the only way, then <br/>
continued to insist that they&#39;re still unschoolers, then people will get annoyed, and <br/>
will stop being patient. Intentions mean a lot.<br/>
<br/>
So, Nancy, I want to ask you: can you think of ways that we can make people <br/>
who are new who genuinely want to talk and learn about unschooling feel <br/>
welcome? Not by watering down the philosophy of the list, which is a given, but <br/>
something else?<br/>
<br/>
We can always do better. But the point of the list has to be respected.<br/>
<br/>

Insulting the people who are doing the work isn&#39;t the best way to be accepted.<br/>
<br/>
We have an SCA family again in the limelight here.  They will go a little <br/>

a tirade about how they would LIKE to be helpful and involved, but people <br/>
won&#39;t LET them and WHAT do people have to do to be ACCEPTED!?<br/>
<br/>
The short answer is not to throw those little fits.  It&#39;s like one step <br/>
forward and three steps back for them. <br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s not an answer a clique voted on, that&#39;s just how it is.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not getting along with one of my neighbors.  Now another neighbor came to <br/>
discuss it with me, WHOLLY on my side.  If that neighbor doesn&#39;t get softer <br/>
and nicer soon, he&#39;s likely to have several families taking some kind of group <br/>
action.   <br/>
<br/>
If he were honestly nicer for weeks and months, we&#39;d forget all about it and <br/>
things would be better for everybody involved.   <br/>
<br/>
If, though, he takes a moment along in there to tell me that he knows people <br/>
are talking about him when he&#39;s not there and that we SUCK, it would dissolve <br/>
much progress.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody here can change that reality.  It&#39;s older than unschooling and bigger <br/>
than the internet.<br/>

&quot;LOL! Sandra, tell me about your medieval finger-food. Is it &quot;Satin&#39;s&quot;<br/>

finger-food?. The misspelling of Satin is deliberate. . . Do you guys <br/>

The evils of Halloween, and of worshipping Satin.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Okay, maybe only six or seven years ago.  But old.  And those who got the <br/>
joke were amused and those who weren&#39;t had it explained.  Someone intent on <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s important feedback for people to have in a general way, not<br/>
just for here. It is good to know how our behavior affects others.<br/>
<br/>
But in a bigger picture way, which applies to everything we interact with,<br/>
it&#39;s helpful to recognize what we can change and what we can&#39;t. It&#39;s<br/>
frustrating to view the world -- or just a small piece of the world like<br/>
this list -- and want the world to act the way we think it should.<br/>
<br/>
But if we can recognize what is in our power to change and what isn&#39;t, it<br/>
can have a profound effect on our happiness. We can let go of the<br/>
frustration that the world isn&#39;t giving us what we need and we can create<br/>
what we need for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that isn&#39;t in our power to change is how people behave. We can<br/>
tell them something bothers us but they get to choose whether to change<br/>
based on their needs.<br/>
<br/>
And just because people don&#39;t change doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re mean. It means<br/>
they see the world differently, have differnt goals and different needs.<br/>
Changing might mean they&#39;d loose something important to them. And we may be<br/>
asking them to give us something that we don&#39;t have a right to ask of them.<br/>
For instance we shouldn&#39;t rely on the behavior of others to provide us with<br/>
emotional harmony.<br/>
<br/>
If their behavior is hurtful to us we can distance ourselves from them. (Or<br/>
get the law involved if it&#39;s criminal.)<br/>
<br/>
People will act in the ways that are natural to them. And it&#39;s natural for<br/>
people to joke around with each other. It&#39;s filling a need they have. We can<br/>
say, look the way you&#39;re meeting your needs isn&#39;t meeting my needs. But it<br/>
isn&#39;t right or in our power to make them change to suit our needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I think that  it seems clique-ish  and annoying for others IF<br/>
&gt; DONE OFTEN.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That seems so sensible. But try imagining putting that into practice.<br/>
Everyone would need to agree on what &quot;too often&quot; means. Is one inside joke a<br/>
day too much? Or one a week? Is friendly banter not as irritating so maybe<br/>
we can have 3 jokes a day? And will we all agree on what a joke is? And what<br/>
if someone outside the &quot;clique&quot; jokes with someone inside? Does that count<br/>
as making people feel excluded? So that means everyone will need to read all<br/>
the posts in their inbox so they can count up the jokes (with the guidelines<br/>
we&#39;ve all agreed on to decide what is and isn&#39;t a joke) to see if the days<br/>
limit has been reached before they can make a joke.<br/>
<br/>
I know you think I&#39;m making fun, but I&#39;m not. I&#39;m serious. It seems sensible<br/>
that someoene could just make the suggestion and everyone would know what it<br/>
means and do it. But in practice, with so many different ways of viewing the<br/>
world, different tolerances, no one is going to imagine the same scenario as<br/>
anyone else. Actually putting it into practice would turn bizarre like<br/>
above. It&#39;s why committees are so inefficient. Visions, goals, priorities<br/>
are all different. And trying to get them all working together on a single<br/>
goal is hard to do.<br/>
<br/>
And this list isn&#39;t even a committee working towards a single goal. It&#39;s<br/>
1200+ people all with individual goals, trying to get what they need from<br/>
the list.<br/>

<br/>
I run a number of lists and I&#39;m really interested in the future of this <br/>
kind of communication. I&#39;ve got lists that are run very differently <br/>
from each other - announcement only, full moderation, moderating only <br/>
new members, free-for-all discussions, and others. I&#39;m sincerely <br/>
interested in ideas about lists and how they work - but need specifics <br/>
to be able to really understand what people are really looking at and <br/>
responding to.<br/>

What would be the justifiable goals and needs of people whose purpose seems <br/>
to be disruption?  <br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t seem to need to discuss unschooling at all, but rather seem <br/>
to need to prevent others from discussing it.  If that IS so important to <br/>
them that they can&#39;t change, should others be made to receive their words all the <br/>
time?<br/>
<br/>
I guess there honestly IS a clique here, and it&#39;s a small group who <br/>
communicate offsides with the purpose of disruption.  They would LIKE for their clique <br/>
to be larger, but it&#39;s easier to gain admirers with a loftier intent than <br/>
disruption.  Still, every post that suggests that this group won&#39;t &quot;respect&quot; bad <br/>
arguments against unschooling seems a bid for sympathy and camaraderie.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have had an experience recently where I posted something in &quot;my&quot; <br/>
style of posting and it was not received well by the &quot;group&quot; I was <br/>
posting in.  They tried to imply that my posting style was <br/>
somehow &quot;less&quot; than theirs.  I don&#39;t see anything wrong with my style <br/>
and I have no desire to change it.  **BUT** I also realized that if I <br/>
were going to continue to post in that group I would need to either <br/>
adjust my style of posting, or *expect* backlash from my posts.  As a <br/>
grown up, I have chosen to mostly be quiet on that group and wait to <br/>
see if it is worth my while.  And as a grown up, I also wouldn&#39;t go <br/>
to that group and complain that they should change their <br/>
overall &quot;style&quot; to suit me. It works for them.  Great.  Good for them.<br/>
<br/>
I also see this as closely related to the &quot;inside joke&quot; issue.  I <br/>
don&#39;t really think it is so much about &quot;inside jokes&quot; as it is styles <br/>
of humor.  This group has more of a twisted, dry, sarcastic sense of <br/>
humor than your average group.  That style does not appeal to <br/>
everyone, and some people don&#39;t &quot;get it.&quot;  Nothing wrong with that.  <br/>
This world would be bland if we were all the same.  But no one is <br/>
trying to make others feel left out just because humor of a certain <br/>
style is used.  Some get it, some don&#39;t.  But if I didn&#39;t get a joke, <br/>
or even a series of jokes, I certainly wouldn&#39;t get insecure about <br/>
it.  <br/>

Sandra, in the dusty desert<br/>
<br/>
SERIOUSLY---I carried a running garden hose around the corner of my house the <br/>
other day, and where it hit the bare ground, DUST came up.  The force of the <br/>
water made dust clouds.  That&#39;s not natural!!<br/>
(And what&#39;s most unnatural about it was the water hose, being on, in a desert <br/>
like that.)<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m starting to pack to go to South Carolina, where even paper can be <br/>
kinda damp, and there are no dust-devils and bread doesn&#39;t dry up in five minutes.<br/>
