<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378428674">do any of you belong to a food co-op???   if so, how do ya&#39;ll have yours set<br/>
up, what do you pay in fees, any caveats to share???    a friend and I are<br/>
in the *planning* stages of starting our h-s co-op in a few wks and since<br/>
ya&#39;ll are always a wealth of info, I thought I&#39;d glean from your *expertise*<br/>
:}<br/>
<br/>
thanks ...<br/>
