Not just Barney!  There are a lot more than Barney<br/>
touting school in the popular media.  It&#39;s a massive<br/>
concerted effort to get kids to think School is Cool<br/>
(in fact, that is a campaign name too.)  As far as<br/>
kid&#39;s shows. there is Arthur and Franklin, where much<br/>
of the action takes place in or around school.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also the ads, both on tv, and in print,<br/>
showing happy children in schools, usually involved in<br/>
social activities (talking and laughing in the halls,<br/>
sitting around outside, eating casually around a bench<br/>
or picnic table, that kind of thing.)  They are<br/>
usually back to school wardrobe or school supplies<br/>
ads.  <br/>
<br/>
I get just nauseated by this huge effort maintained<br/>
(like the Adult consipracy of Xanth) to try and<br/>
convince children that School is fun!  School is a<br/>
wonderful place where you want to be!  School is<br/>
neato-keen and full of lively and interesting<br/>
activity!  They expect children to be brainwashed to<br/>
the degree that they don&#39;t even believe what their own<br/>
senses are telling them about school, or kids think<br/>
there must be some thing wrong with them to not see<br/>
and feel the way everyone else does about school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-211100812">There are some great exceptions. The Wild Thornberrys are homeschooled. <br/>
There is a MAGNIFICENT episode of Little Bear (the TV cartoon, I don&#39;t know<br/>
if this scene ever played out in Minarik&#39;s books) where Lucy and Little Bear<br/>
set up a school for a bunch of otters, with hilarious results and Lucy and<br/>
Little Bear sensibly blame the classroom, not the otters. Otters are<br/>
apparently the original unschoolers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It makes &quot;sense&quot; (and I use the term lightly only because I can&#39;t think of a<br/>
better one &lt;g&gt;) to have pro-school programming on TV if you&#39;re on the other<br/>
side of the fence: those propagandist shows comfort both children and<br/>
parents who are school-bound (cold comfort, as most of them will discover<br/>
soon enough, but comfort none-the-less).<br/>

second spot showing millions of kids that getting on the shiny yellow bus is <br/>
fun! All the school supply stuff is all jazzed up, preteen girls in what I <br/>
call Brittany clothes, pulling the kids in to make them and their parents buy <br/>
buy buy! And the movies glamorize school too. All the pretty campuses with <br/>
teens having lunch on the commons. All this and Barney too! ~*Go to school*~ <br/>
~*School is fun*~ ~*you will be beautiful and popular*~  &quot;We&#39;re a great big <br/>
happy fam-A-lee!&quot; riiiggghht! <br/>

Sponge Bob Squarepants and other snarky cable cartoons (but those are for<br/>
the Already Jaded Students, who KNOW what school is like; they&#39;re beyond<br/>
brainwashing).<br/>
