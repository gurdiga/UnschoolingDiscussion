<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543168130">Hi -<br/>
I called the local County Board of Education (Sacramento, CA) to <br/>
request the R-4 private school affadavit that will allow us to <br/>
legally (as my research indicates) unschool without being enrolled at <br/>
a charter/independent school.  The first person I spoke with <br/>
didn&#39;t ask any questions and said she would send the forms out.  Then <br/>
an hour or so later I get a voice mail message from another person at <br/>
that office saying that she wants to talk to me to be sure I am aware <br/>
of the LEGAL options before I tried homeschooling via the R-4.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t even say anything about home schooling when I requested the <br/>
forms!  Does this sound like intimidation or am I just being paranoid?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could just ignore her message (she said the forms would be <br/>
sent out), but it kind of chaps my hide that she was so assumptious <br/>
(word?) and intimidating.  I&#39;d kind of like to call her back and let <br/>
her know that I know my legal rights!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333581847">I wouldn&#39;t recommend it in Sac.  The BOE is tight with the state boys and<br/>
girls in Sac and there are one or two in the state office of ed that are<br/>
real anal retentive type folks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just get the forms and ignore the message.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362910990">Advice...<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t call anyone.  Put things in writing and if the board calls you ask them <br/>
to do the same.  Trust what you learn yourself about the law and not them <br/>
because they don&#39;t know as much.  But, don&#39;t communicate by phone.  I have <br/>
experience with this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102010375">Hi - Carla again -<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should clarify - I said BOARD of Ed - it was actually the <br/>
Sacramento County OFFICE of ED.  Not that it really makes a <br/>
difference.  Kind of interesting that the office that is responsible <br/>
for handling the R-4&#39;s is &quot;Attendance and Child Welfare.&quot;  Who was <br/>
looking out for my son&#39;s welfare when he was being harassed daily at <br/>
the public middle school?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice.  I also read some posts on the <br/>
unschooling.com&#39;s message boards that indicate some other counties in <br/>
CA that offer intimidation up with new requests for and renewals of R-<br/>
4s.  I&#39;ll heed the advice to not handle it through phone <br/>
conversations (put it in writing if things become difficult) and to <br/>
advise HSC&#39;s legal chair of my experience.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.  This group is such a great resource - both <br/>
practical and spiritual (in the non-denominational sense, of <br/>
course!). <br/>
<br/>
