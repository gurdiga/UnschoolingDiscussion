&gt; I&#39;ve chosen to stay because a few OTHER people have said things to make<br/>
&gt; me think perhaps you are one of only a few here who are willing to bash a<br/>
&gt; newcomer before you have any idea about their philosophy, family life or<br/>
&gt; educational style.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>:::Pam pauses with far-away look in eyes, tries to picture Sandra poised<br/>
over keyboard, going days without food or drink if necessary, just waiting<br/>
for a newcomer to drop by and say, &quot;Hi! I&#39;m new and I&#39;m here to talk about<br/>
unschooling!&quot; so she (Sandra) can bash them. Perhaps she even has a nice big<br/>
hammer sitting at the side of her keyboard to give her inspiration? No, no,<br/>
that would be over-the-top.:::<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, it&#39;s not washing, even as fiction.<br/>
<br/>
The list had its ideas about your philosophy, family life and educational<br/>
styles that you gave us. People were working on ideas-as-presented, not on<br/>
no-ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Pam<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Oh! I almost forgot: bashing ideas is different than bashing people.<br/>
You could say, &quot;Pam, to think thus and such is a boogerheaded notion&quot; and<br/>
that&#39;s bashing an idea. You could also say, &quot;Pam, you are one giant freakin&#39;<br/>
boogerhead&quot; and that&#39;s bashing a person.  Sincerely, Your Mailing List<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So you are saying that I am imaginingit all.  I was not told this is not<br/>
the list for me, that I am not unschooling (even after I went and read<br/>
the website), that I was not called authoritarian?  Oh and by the way I<br/>
did not say Sondra said all that - others participated too.<br/>
I am merely hoping to get you to see how inhospitable this list has been<br/>
to me since day one, before I even mentioned what we have for family<br/>
dynamics.  And it is not so much for myself - I don&#39;t particularly care<br/>
what you think of me - I just would hate to see you scare off someone who<br/>
really could use the reassurance that less is better in education<br/>
micro-management.<br/>
