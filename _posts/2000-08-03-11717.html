<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144103843">I&#39;ve been in &quot;lurk&quot; mode, and even &quot;web only&quot; for a while, but have<br/>
recently gone back to digest mode. I have a difficult transition to face.<br/>
	I spent the last &quot;school&quot; year driving my children to their weekly clubs<br/>
and classes: Play & Learn, Fun With Real Math Club, Spanish Club, Drama<br/>
Club, riding lessons and dance classes. They had a blast, and are<br/>
interested in doing virtually all of these again this year. However, I<br/>
strongly feel that our home/family life has suffered; we&#39;ve hardly ever<br/>
been home! <br/>
	I&#39;m reassessing our lives, and leaning heavily toward making this year a<br/>
time to focus on things close to home. Maybe using &quot;The 7 Habits of<br/>
Highly Effective Families&quot; as our text. Thinking hardline; giving up the<br/>
regular external activities. I&#39;m not stopping all going out, just the<br/>
weekly scheduled endeavors--except probably math club, because both kids<br/>
really need it. It&#39;s very low-key, too. Unlike many of the other<br/>
activities, which require much involvement outside of the meeting<br/>
time-such as helping to provide props and scenery and such for the Drama<br/>
Club and dance recitals; 80 minutes of driving for each riding lesson;<br/>
hosting the Play & Learn group every month (and coming up w/activities,<br/>
books, snacks, etc.).<br/>
	The more I think about it, the better it feels in my guts. I think we<br/>
really just need to focus more on our family, and less on externally<br/>
structured activities. I believe it will be a positive experience for all<br/>
of us, and improve the health of our family relationships.<br/>
	We really need to work on cooperation, family team spirit and such.<br/>
That&#39;s why I&#39;m thinking of using The 7 Habits as our &quot;curriculum&quot; for at<br/>
least several months. Otherwise, I might just hop on that plane to<br/>
Bermuda. <br/>
	In addition, last year&#39;s activities required spending several hundred<br/>
dollars, and we&#39;ve had some bad luck with health and injuries this year,<br/>
which has created a financial problem for us. And, we have a whole room<br/>
full of (paid for) art & craft supplies waiting to be used--if we&#39;re ever<br/>
home long enough. It seems wise to cut back on expenses and utilize the<br/>
resources immediately at hand.<br/>
	However, my children are upset with this decision; they want to continue<br/>
as before. My question: Am I unschooling if I refuse to give my kids the<br/>
classes and clubs they want? Has anyone else faced similar situations?<br/>
Any suggestions for making the transition easier?<br/>
<br/>

I think a big part of unschooling is treating kids with respect and as an<br/>
important part of the family. That means letting them have input in family<br/>
decisions and knowing why things are being done, it does not mean that they<br/>
get to make all of the decisions and that you are to be at their beck and<br/>
call.<br/>
<br/>
For many years, we did very little in the way of any scheduled activities<br/>
outside of the home. About two years ago we got involved in more, Brownies,<br/>
acting classes, swimming lessons, ice skating. It was fun but was also<br/>
beginning to put stress on us financially and time wise. Since we work from<br/>
home, it was very hard to have to in the middle of a project to rush off to<br/>
some scheduled event.<br/>
<br/>
We started cutting back. The kids were good about understanding that we<br/>
couldn&#39;t do everything they might want to do, and we let them be involved in<br/>
picking what was most important to them. (I tend to prefer activities that I<br/>
can also participate in, so ice skating stayed on the list ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Another good way to let them decide is to set a budget. Let them know how<br/>
much is available to spend and how much the different activities cost. The<br/>
budget doesn&#39;t have to be money, you could set a number of hours or days per<br/>
week for outside activities.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes less is more, and the kids can really benefit from being less busy<br/>
(and having a parent who is less worn out from shuttling them all over the<br/>
place). Involve them in the process and they may surprise you at how well<br/>
they survive cutting back on activities!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Shay,<br/>
<br/>
I believe that you are still unschooling even if you don&#39;t give your <br/>
children everything they want, these activities were consuming your <br/>
time and money at a rate that you didn&#39;t care to keep up.   <br/>
<br/>
You are the parent and the descision is yours, they just have to <br/>
accept that they may have to misss out on some things that they <br/>
enjoyed in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>
<br/>

&quot;One had to cram all this stuff into one&#39;s mind for the examinations, <br/>
whether one liked it or not.  This coercion had such a deterring <br/>
effect on me that, after I had passed the final examination, I found <br/>
the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an <br/>
entire year.&quot; ~~ Albert Einstein ~~</div>

<br/>
We got beyond this by telling each chid that they could do 1 activity. DD #1<br/>
picked skating an DD #2 picked dance. Luckily #3 is still too young for all<br/>
of this.<br/>

<br/>
As for making the transition easier...fake it &#39;til it works.  LOL  <br/>
<br/>
If you feel good about it, just approach it an upbeat way.  Let the kids know <br/>
this is how it&#39;s gonna be and go from there.  Make adjustments as needed as <br/>
you go.  Remember that mom needs to be okay about &#39;school&#39;, too.  It&#39;s not <br/>
only the children that are affected by these decisions, but the whole family!<br/>

a thumbs-up for those who said to involve them, and a point that <br/>
the thing for me about home-ed is that it has to work for <br/>
everyone, not just kids.  And perhaps it&#39;s one of those things of <br/>
not letting kids play on the motorway, though they may want to, <br/>
because it&#39;s not gonna be good for &#39;em...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039970343">Thanks to all for the insightful and supportive responses to my dilemma.<br/>
Your responses  helped to affirm what I feel is the right thing to do. <br/>
<br/>
Sue, the quote you included:  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;One had to cram all this stuff into one&#39;s mind for the examinations,<br/>
whether one liked it or not.  This coercion had such a deterring effect<br/>
on me that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the<br/>
consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire<br/>
year.&quot; ~~ Albert Einstein ~~&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	made me laugh! Change the words a bit, and I&#39;m there! <br/>
	Billy, I like the budget idea and will probably work that in--after<br/>
we&#39;ve had a complete break for a while. I am offering to let them choose<br/>
from a particular pallette: which crafts and non-routine activities would<br/>
they like to do?<br/>
	Interestingly, we already found the shift to be beneficial. Yesterday we<br/>
finally had time to inspect two crumbling old cemeteries near the<br/>
megamall. We&#39;d been interested in finding the site of the graves of one<br/>
of the prominent historical families in the area, but hadn&#39;t made time. <br/>
	The cemeteries were of other families, but the kids found our<br/>
exploration &quot;a lot more interesting than we thought it would be.&quot; We<br/>
talked about burial customs, the forces that degrade the stones, why a<br/>
modern family would spend money on replacing the most degraded markers,<br/>
why the mall had to be built around the cemeteries, why the wealthiest<br/>
and most important have the biggest, fanciest markers, why there were<br/>
graves for babies, etc. Now they want to visit other cemeteries. <br/>
	The kids seem to be a lot less angry about the idea of change. I think<br/>
it was the initial shock that upset them, and they&#39;re realizing it&#39;s<br/>
going to be different, but OK.<br/>
	Maybe it helped that I let them know it isn&#39;t a punishment or<br/>
withdrawal, but as much about redrawing my personal boundaries as<br/>
anything else. <br/>
	Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>

I don&#39;t know if anyone would care to define what you propose as &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
or not.<br/>
<br/>
But  . . . I think it sounds like good parenting.   Good budgeting.  Good <br/>
family planning.  Not all things are readily apparent to children -- all the <br/>
nuances that go into a decision like this.  And most of us have trouble with <br/>
any sort of change.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe later on (months, years from now?) you and the kids will think to add <br/>
an outside activity or 2 that will be really meaningful to you.  But until <br/>
then . . .<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you fun at home!!<br/>
