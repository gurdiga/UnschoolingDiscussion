as her mother said, &quot;You eat, don&#39;t you? Then you can help clear the<br/>
table/clean up the dishes.&quot;` -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how culture is passed on.   By older women (all older relatives and <br/>
neighbors and teachers and social workers and whoever all) telling younger <br/>
people to just do it the way THEY did it and stop trying to be creative. <br/>
<br/>
My mother said, as her mother said, &quot;Stop that crying or I&#39;ll give you <br/>
something to cry about.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I decided not ever, ever to say any such thing to my children, I stepped <br/>
off the cultural path.<br/>
When I decided Kirby didn&#39;t have to go to school if he didn&#39;t want to, I <br/>
stepped off the cultural path.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t want to throw the cultural forest away entirely, I just want to <br/>
meander and help my kids enjoy the good parts.<br/>
