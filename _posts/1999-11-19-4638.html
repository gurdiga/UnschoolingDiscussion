&lt;&lt;   Not once he <br/>
 sees that prison life is so much better than home life.  Cable TV, <br/>
 health clubs, free education, the works. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I know this is a popular conception of prison life but it leaves out a <br/>
few of the harsher realities, two major ones being beatings by other <br/>
prisoners or sometimes guards and rapes.  Should these also be the <br/>
punishment?  This is the reality of our justice system.  If any of us think <br/>
about any of our own children or ourselves for that matter, being sent to <br/>
prison, I believe THOSE things are the fears that scare us most.<br/>
    Also, if a child&#39;s life in prison really is so much better than his home <br/>
life, isn&#39;t part of the answer to see what can be done to change the home <br/>
life?  I haven&#39;t met a kid yet who would rather be in prison for the cable TV <br/>
or the &quot;health clubs.&quot; <br/>
    I believe the U.S. responds too emotionally to these issues and doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to look at what it would take to truly solve the problems.  I guess <br/>
that&#39;s why we have such a huge percentage of our people locked up.  <br/>
    I am just as capable as anyone else of responding with anger and a desire <br/>
for revenge when I hear about horrible things done to people.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
what I would really do if someone hurt or killed someone I love.  I know <br/>
there is a part of me that would probably want to kill the person myself.  <br/>
Yet our current laws do not allow that as much as we all might feel that way <br/>
to some extent because we recognize that it would make our society more <br/>
violent, not less violent.  In the same way, I believe that many of the <br/>
&quot;solutions&quot; the U.S. has now also make our society more violent.  <br/>
    Here is another thing I think about a lot:  people talk so much about how <br/>
these kids should be made to take responsibility for what they do wrong.  But <br/>
these kids didn&#39;t just land here from outer space.  When is our sick society <br/>
going to take responsibility for creating an environment which produces the <br/>
kids they&#39;re complaining so much about?   The previous generations, for all <br/>
of their own problems and injustices, did not have kids who did these kinds <br/>
of things.  <br/>
    Some like to believe that it&#39;s because they beat their kids more and <br/>
&quot;didn&#39;t put up with this nonsense.&quot;  However, I remember my own grandmothers <br/>
and neither one were harsh at all.  They were very loving, warm people who <br/>
were always willing to talk, to enjoy kids, to help others, to extend mercy, <br/>
to help their kids with prolblems that the kids didn&#39;t know how to solve.<br/>
    Too many kids today are left in situations which they have no IDEA how to <br/>
solve.  Sure, there are some who do well DESPITE their horrible childhoods.  <br/>
But don&#39;t we want to create an environment in which the tendency is to do <br/>
well rather than have it be the exception?  Whenever I read about things like <br/>
the young boys who pushed the younger boy out of the window because he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t steal for them, the thing comes to my mind is how strange it is that <br/>
just a few years back when I was living in...wherever....or doing...whatever <br/>
it was...these kids were just little boys and I wonder what in the world <br/>
happened to make them become this way.  If we don&#39;t start figuring out the <br/>
answers to that, we won&#39;t ever solve the problem.<br/>
