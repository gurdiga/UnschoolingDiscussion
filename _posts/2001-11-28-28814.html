<div id="ygrps-yiv-429654673">I&#39;ve been feeling guilty because we have a ton of Christmas prep to <br/>
do and if we&#39;re going to get it all finished, I&#39;ve got to spend an <br/>

the kids might not understand, like cleaning and organizing.  For <br/>
example, I had to spend a big chunk of the day organizing stuff in <br/>
the living room to make room for the tree platform and cleaning out <br/>
the attic to make room for furniture that we have to store there <br/>
during Christmas.  Other stuff is stuff they want to do but they&#39;re <br/>
big projects which take prep time on my part (Christmas gift crafts <br/>
they want to make for their grandparents, sewing bedding for dd&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039505832">Yes, I know what you mean.  I feel the same way.  But with me, it seems <br/>
like I am like this all year long.  I always feel like I have things I <br/>
need to do around the house.  Believe me, I&#39;m not a neat freak.  Our <br/>
house is always a mess.  I have to do some things, once in a while, <br/>
before it turns into a complete dump.<br/>
<br/>
I keep telling myself that this is a part of unschooling.  Certain <br/>
mundane chores must be done daily, or at least once in a while.  My boys <br/>
see me doing this and they are learning that this is just a necessary <br/>
part of life.  One day they will do these things too.  Actually, they <br/>
are already doing some of these things on their own.  It&#39;s totally <br/>
voluntary.  This doesn&#39;t happen every day, but once in a while they&#39;ll <br/>
choose to help me to fold the clothes, clean the bathroom and they just <br/>
love to mop the floor.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of times when they complain that I&#39;m not available <br/>
because I&#39;m doing something.  And, of course, I feel guilty.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know how to get rid of the guilt, even though I know it&#39;s not bad for <br/>
them to go through this.  They, after all, have to learn how to <br/>
entertain themselves.  This is one of the beauties of unschooling, I <br/>
think.  Kids learn how to entertain themselves.  For some, it comes <br/>
easier than others.  I have twin boys.  They are very different.  One <br/>
requires so much more attention and entertaining than the other.  I try <br/>
my best to keep everyone happy, including myself.<br/>

like to read X book, ds is splashing in the pool, the computer is off, the <br/>
heck with the housework . . . and they change their minds and go inside and <br/>
watch Pokemon or play a game together or something . . . just abandoning me <br/>
in my &quot;together time&quot; moment . . . which is OK most of the time because then <br/>
I get MY book and read outside which is nice . . . never mind . . .<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one for you -- I got to feel smug yesterday!  Doesn&#39;t happen often and <br/>
I didn&#39;t even feel that way until after.  I was talking with a Mom and she <br/>
was going a hundred miles an hour about schedules and &quot;activities&quot; and blah <br/>
blah blah and for once I felt actually mellow, compared to her!  It hit me on <br/>
the drive home that the &quot;activity&quot; we were at was part of a very rushed day <br/>
for her -- but not for us!  <br/>

Maybe it&#39;s because my kids are older (8 & 10) that THEY are the ones pushing ME to get all this stuff done for Christmas.<br/>
They are so totally psyched about it. We are already completely decked out at our house. It was their constant pushing and insisting that made dh & I get off our butts and dig out Christmas stuff out of the attic, last Sat.<br/>
We were dragging our feet a little but they did not give up for a second.<br/>
There is a little more to do around here and I am still hearing the nagging to get it all done!<br/>
My kids have pretty much always been like this.<br/>
They help with all the rearranging and cleaning. They are so excited to Christmasize our house!<br/>
I know it would be harder to get things done with a 2 yo around, though.<br/>
Do your kids understand the reason why you have to divide your time a little, because it&#39;s Christmas time?<br/>
Maybe you could look at the calendar and promise them you will do ______ on this date, and try to stick to it.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

Do you really HAVE to do those things for Christmas? <br/>
<br/>
Explaining the choices that your children have will let them decide what <br/>
to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I had planned to get Christmas stuff out so we won&#39;t have a naked house <br/>
for the holidays! <br/>
*oh my stars!!!*. We can do tha together or we can go with your <br/>
suggestion. Its your choice.<br/>
<br/>
The 8 and 4 should understand enough to make an informed choice. The 2 <br/>
will have to go with the democracy on this one.<br/>
<br/>
If the Christmas decs are because YOU want them up there, <br/>
then get them out on YOUR time *cough* *smirk* *smile*<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about if you tell them &quot;This is what I have planned for today.&quot; Then<br/>
explain and ask &quot;How does that fit in with your plans?&quot; Then work out a<br/>
schedule of how you can both get your wants met. So, rather than setting<br/>
your children aside in order to get all the stuff done, make sure that<br/>
together time is built into the schedule. I think too often we tend to enter<br/>
projects with the attitude that it will take as long as it needs to take and<br/>
to kids that might as well be forever since they aren&#39;t getting any<br/>
confidence that there&#39;s a forseeable end point.<br/>
<br/>
That won&#39;t be magical and they&#39;ll stop demanding you stop what you&#39;re doing<br/>
and do something with them, but it might help get a glimmer of the idea of<br/>
how to schedule time when there&#39;s an involved project.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve got to spend an<br/>
&gt; awful lot of time on some necessary work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And perhaps stop thinking of it in terms of &quot;got to&quot;. You don&#39;t *have* to do<br/>
any of it. This is something you *want* to do to create the type of<br/>
Christmas that you are envisioning.<br/>
<br/>
But if the creation of Christmas is putting a strain on your relationship<br/>
with your family, then perhaps you can rethink some things that you want to<br/>
do. You may want a warm and cozy atmosphere for Christmas, but if getting to<br/>
it is an emotional hassle, then what pattern and memories is that<br/>
establishing for the kids?<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you ask *them* how they&#39;d like things to be for Christmas? Maybe<br/>
the things you think they&#39;ll find precious aren&#39;t all that important to<br/>
them. So putting in the effort to make it happen for them might be better<br/>
spent on playing a game. Perhaps you can do in the future when there older<br/>
and more capable of helping or entertaining themselves for long periods of<br/>
time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321594296">We baked gingerbread last night.....hope to make royal icing tomorrow and<br/>
let the young &#39;uns build a gingerbread village!<br/>
I&#39;m really trying to include the children in ornament making,<br/>
decorating...letting go of *my* desires to do what I want in some areas and<br/>
letting them enjoy what they come up with...<br/>
Susan,  who may decide I need a few days off-line to accomodate family<br/>
activities!<br/>

stressful holidays with my own family. Everyone was too rushed and stressed<br/>
out to really enjoy the holiday. And by the time everyone could relax, the<br/>
holiday was over. We always missed the &#39;enjoying it&#39; part.<br/>

again yet it does. We must come up with the resolve to *not* get caught up<br/>
in the cr*ppy part any longer or before we know it, our kids will be grown<br/>
and gone!!!<br/>
My youngest wants to build a Gingerbread house this year and has wanted to<br/>
for several years now. I think I&#39;d better get my act together and *do* it<br/>
rather than worry about some other things that really aren&#39;t so impt.<br/>
