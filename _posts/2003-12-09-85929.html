<div id="ygrps-yiv-569418311">I know the 19yo in CA isn&#39;t having sex because of what he is doing <br/>
out there. He is with another fellow 24/7 and they have a job to do <br/>
and that&#39;s what they are doing. If they don&#39;t follow the &quot;rules&quot; they <br/>
get sent home. They CHOOSE to do this with open eyes, so I&#39;m not at <br/>
all worried that he is out there doing anything other than what he is <br/>
supposed to be. And I&#39;m 100% sure sex isn&#39;t involved.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sex can happen between two fellas too, ya know.... 24/7, thats a lot of time <br/>
together, that other fella might start looking good to him..  Unless you are <br/>
also with him 24/7, there is no way you can know &quot;100%&quot; what he is doing.    <br/>
I&#39;m not saying he IS having sex, but it is impossible for you to insist that you <br/>
know he is not.<br/>
