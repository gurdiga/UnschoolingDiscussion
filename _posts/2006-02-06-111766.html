<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006803749">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;(i think i can handle just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; about anything, but there are certain issues i dont *want* to deal<br/>
&gt; with, and so wish to avoid them.)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I felt the same way when we went into foster care with plans to adopt. I<br/>
knew that I didn&#39;t want a child with a life-threatening illness, because I<br/>
had lost my only biological child to illness. That was my only caveat. My dh<br/>
knew that he didn&#39;t want to have a child with limited intelligence,<br/>
especially one who would never be able to live an independent life. To make<br/>
a very long story as short as possible, that&#39;s not what happened. Our second<br/>
son has chronic, sometimes severe asthma and almost died from a lung abcess<br/>
when he was three. He and I spent many months in the hospital, here and in<br/>
Boston, which was a hardship for my husband and oldest son, physically and<br/>
emotionally. As he grew older, it became evident that he had many more<br/>
issues than just asthma. He has Tourette Disorder, horrible mood swings with<br/>
crying jags that last for hours, hypothyroidism, an IQ of 82, is very<br/>
anxious and sometimes suicidal. He&#39;s very prone to pneumonia and needs<br/>
nebulizer treatments every three to four hours most of the time. It&#39;s<br/>
unlikely that he&#39;ll ever be able to live independently and my dh and I are<br/>
59 and 54, so we won&#39;t be able to take care of him forever. OTOH, he&#39;s a<br/>
warm, loving, social boy, who is very proud of his accomplishments, which<br/>
are many, and as stable and comfortable as he can be within our family and<br/>
in our small community. He also has a wonderful Black Lab, who is untrained,<br/>
but a therapy dog nonetheless. Anyhow, we wouldn&#39;t have chosen to be Mike&#39;s<br/>
parents, because there&#39;s a real possibility that he won&#39;t live a long life.<br/>
However, shortly after we got him, he had bonded to us and we had bonded to<br/>
him and moving him to another foster home would have devastated him and us.<br/>
So, knowing what you can handle, telling social workers that, and trusting<br/>
them to find a child who isn&#39;t out of your comfort zone, is a gamble. Of<br/>
course, having birth children is a gamble too, but that wasn&#39;t an option for<br/>
us. Just my 2 cents and, of course, I can only speak for myself.<br/>
