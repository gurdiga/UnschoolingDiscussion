<div id="ygrps-yiv-153533363">Something struck me while reading the posts about is it unschooling or not (again!)<br/>
<br/>
I call my self a buddhist.  A lot of people call themselves Christian.  But do you live up to all the ideals?  No, you struggle and hope your getting it right.  But I&#39;m certainly not as good at it as Buddha, and I&#39;m sure the Christians on this list aren&#39;t as good at it as Jesus was.  <br/>
<br/>
Yet we call ourselves whatever, because we believe in the end goal.  We believe in the words.  But that doesn&#39;t mean were perfect!  We never will be perfect buddhists or christians, or whatever.  So why do we have this need to be *perfect* unschoolers.  As long as we agree on the goal and the method - can&#39;t we be human?<br/>

<br/>
The goal and the method aren&#39;t the belief.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re Buddhist because something in the philosophy resonated with you, <br/>
because you believe something strongly enough to be associated with it.<br/>
<br/>
There are people whose goal is for their children to grow up functional and <br/>
self-sufficient (that&#39;s just about all people, I suppose, excepting a few <br/>
possible lunatics of some sort I&#39;d just as soon never meet).  And there are <br/>
people who want to have that happen on it&#39;s own, somehow.  <br/>
<br/>
But unless they believe it really can happen and they take steps to assure <br/>
that it has a chance of happening, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re unschooling.  Maybe <br/>
our &quot;methods&quot; without the philosophy and action will be neglect, in some <br/>
cases.<br/>
