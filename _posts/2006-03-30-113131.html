<div id="ygrps-yiv-940144373">My nephew (who shoulda been unschooled) is a film school grad and<br/>
lives in LA. He gave us a subscription to Animation Magazine<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.animationmagazine.net/)">http://www.animationmagazine.net/)</a>, which is just great.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the mag is full of ads for colleges offering<br/>
innovative-sounding programs in film, animation, arts, etc.<br/>
