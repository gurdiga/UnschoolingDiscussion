<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339335220">Well, I guess this is a blonde moment.  (I get to say that because my sister<br/>
has made me an honorary blonde)  I&#39;ve had other folks read the whole thread<br/>
and they understood what I was saying.  Some folks don&#39;t, and I guess, since<br/>
I hold the title of CAM, that unless you can come over for a cup of green<br/>
tea with lemon grass and sit around the table, there isn&#39;t really any way I<br/>
can explain what I meant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475988661">Well, that seems to be a cop out. I am willing to listen to your reasoning, <br/>
etc. I thought that was how communication went on a list. You get an <br/>
opportunity to present  your ideas in a clear manner over and over until <br/>
people understand. I am saddened you won&#39;t  take the opportunity. Clearly, I <br/>
am not the only one who has a challenge understanding your motives on this. I <br/>
have no idea what the title of CAM is . . .really I thought we were all just <br/>
unschool moms getting some support and trying to understand how others <br/>
meander through their lives. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424848065">Ya know, I think what folks need to do is go back and read the whole thread.<br/>
Then read exactly what came before the post that got everyone&#39;s bloomers in<br/>
a bunch.  Maybe do a cut and paste into a word processing program and then<br/>
read the thread as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
And, while you may choose to decide that my reason for letting it go is a<br/>
cop out, that doesn&#39;t make it so.  Since I have been bitched at for taking<br/>
up too much band width here and been told that to continue to try to explain<br/>
is the next thing to being a stalker (heaven forbid that one should call<br/>
anyone on that type of psychotic thinking), I felt it was best to let the<br/>
thread die a natural, or unnatural death, whichever the list desired.<br/>
<br/>
Now, shall we let it go or shall we continue?  If you wish to continue,<br/>
maybe we should change the subject line so that those who want to make<br/>
Twinki remarks can use their delete key!  Or if you are really interested,<br/>
we can take it off-list.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  CAM means &quot;Clear As Mud&quot; which is frequently what happens on a list as<br/>
all the components of communication are not available.<br/>
