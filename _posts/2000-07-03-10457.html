 </span></blockquote>Yeah, same here.  My son is 3 and a 1/2 and shows no interest whatsoever.  We keep the potty chair available in the bathroom and ask him if he would like to use it on occassion, but do not press.  He has never had any problem with bowel movements or rashes, etc.  But he does hate to have his diaper changed and that is often a struggle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16524381">Here is a great site for potty training  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lee-bee.com/&quot;">http://www.lee-bee.com/&quot;</a>&gt;Lee<br/>
-Bee potty training and chore charts - an effective way of toilet training <br/>
and getting kids to do chores! Childrens, TOIL&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I used the potty training chart with my daughter. she is 2 1/2 yrs old and <br/>
she has been completely potty trained now for 3 1/2 months. I had her trained <br/>
in 5 days. but for about a month I had to wake her up once around midnight to <br/>
make her sit on the potty so she wouldn&#39;t wet the bed. But she is now doing <br/>
great with no accidents. <br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649719612">Some childrens little bladders are just not ready to be controlled as early <br/>
as 2, 3 or even 4.  I think pushing it is just harder on everyone.  We tried <br/>
that for a week and about drove ALL of us crazy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659208111">I have a 3 year old-sometimes she goes to the potty, sometimes a diaper, and <br/>
I could care less when she gives up the diapers. I know she will eventually, <br/>
and when the time is right, she will do it.<br/>
