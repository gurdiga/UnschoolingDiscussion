<div id="ygrps-yiv-908608839">This is so cool! My basic philosophy on life is exactly what homeschooling <br/>
professes.  Obviously, I have always been *different* and *wrong*.  Thank <br/>
goodness I&#39;m too stubborn to give in.  I started homeschooling/unschooling my <br/>
13 year old son in January.  Public school sucks. I&#39;m a home instructor for <br/>
various school districts, and they&#39;re all alike: horrible.  I&#39;m so glad I <br/>
wandered onto this list.  It sometimes gets lonely being the only right <br/>
person.    : )<br/>
