<div id="ygrps-yiv-131876332">HI All!<br/>
I am trying to transition us to a much more unschooling approach. I<br/>
have the unschooling handbook and John Holt&#39;s &quot;Teach you own&quot;. Both<br/>
are inspiring. My oldest children are 7.5 and 6.5 and they have used<br/>
Calvert Gr. k and 1, and now they are using Calvert Gr.3. I am<br/>
definitely teaching to the books, and it is obvious that I don&#39;t like<br/>
it and they don&#39;t. I mean, they do just fine, and enjoy some of the<br/>
stories, but it is so textbook. It is stifling. Calvert isn&#39;t cheap<br/>
and I hate to waste, but I really want to let it go. Do you feel so<br/>
much freedom when you finally deschool yourself and just trust in your<br/>
children? I plan to still use the Calvert Math, but cut back the work<br/>
sheets. I will still use the books, some are fun to just read. But I<br/>
want to let the schedule go. We have a star chart for each lesson<br/>
finished, they could not care less about those stars! They are bright<br/>
and creative and I fear sticking to a strict curriuclum will stifle<br/>
that! I think I want to be an &quot;eclectic&quot; homeschooler: some structure,<br/>
but using unit studies/letting the children choose projects/some<br/>
waldorf aspects that really lend themselves to homeschooling. I look<br/>
forward to any advice/input. Thanks! Becky</div>

If you buy a dozen donuts for $4 and you don&#39;t really like the donuts, will <br/>
you eat them to keep from wasting money?<br/>
<br/>
If you had some poison and you paid $20 for it, would you drink it just <br/>
because you had already paid for it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised you took &quot;unschoolmama&quot; as a screenname.  That does seem to <br/>
show an intent to move to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We can help you get to unschooling, but I don&#39;t think this list is a good <br/>
place for you to get encouragement to keep teaching math.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do you feel so much freedom when you finally deschool yourself and just <br/>
trust in your<br/>
<br/>
children?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you trust how learning works, you don&#39;t have to trust your children as <br/>
individuals to be human.  If you move toward understanding how YOU learned things <br/>
you wanted to know, and seeing what hindered that, you can trust yourSELF as <br/>
a learning human.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book called &quot;Whole Child/Whole Parent&quot; you might want to at least <br/>
skim through.  I think it would help you.  The author speaks of children as <br/>
&quot;seeing beings.&quot;  Though it&#39;s mostly about very young children, it changed the <br/>
way I saw being a parent.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re dirt cheap used online, and not so expensive new.   The author is <br/>
Polly Berrien Berends.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They are bright and creative and I fear sticking to a strict curriuclum <br/>
will stifle<br/>
<br/>
that! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Any amount of curriculum could stifle that.<br/>
<br/>
The less you trust them, the less trusted they are.<br/>
The less you respect them, the less respected they are.  <br/>
Those are absolutes.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something on that:<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
My advice is that unschooling is better than structure and units and projects <br/>
and waldorf.<br/>
<br/>
If I didn&#39;t think it was better, I would be doing structure and units and <br/>
projects and waldorf.<br/>

Did anyone already direct you to Alfie Kohn&#39;s &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; ?<br/>
Here&#39;s his website with excerpts:<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They are bright<br/>

<br/>
This is an Unschooling list. The advice here will always be towards moving<br/>
to Unschooling. We can&#39;t help you create unit studies, talk about &quot;projects&quot;<br/>
outside of living real life, or talk about Waldorf except fairly critically.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is not merely any curriculum that stifles creativity and a child&#39;s<br/>
authentic nature and personality. You are talking a lot about what *you*<br/>
want to be. Unschoolers are interested in facilitating their children being<br/>
who they are.<br/>
<br/>
Try www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling<br/>
<br/>
My first advice is &quot;just stop&quot;. Enjoy playing with your kids as if it were<br/>
summer vacation that never ends. Stop looking for the &quot;educational value&quot; in<br/>
any activity. The learning connections happen automatically.<br/>

the book worth reading to me... please let me know. I&#39;m currently <br/>
reading &quot;Being One&quot; by the same guy who wrote the book &quot;The Happy <br/>
