PUPILS TO BE REQUIRED TO VOLUNTEER: PANEL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An education advisory panel to the prime minister on Friday submitted an <br/>
interim report calling for drastic changes in the current education <br/>
system that would nurture volunteer spirit among students by requiring <br/>
them to do community service.<br/>
<br/>
The report also emphasized the importance of fostering a sense of <br/>
self-reliance and originality in individual children by discarding the <br/>
conventional idea of a standardized education.                           <br/>
<br/>
This is apparently an attempt to develop more capable future generations <br/>
in an increasingly competitive world and at a time when Japan&#39;s economic <br/>
power is on the decline.<br/>
                                                                      .<br/>
The proposals are among 17 suggestions the National Commission on <br/>
Educational Reform outlined in its interim report to Prime Minister <br/>
Yoshiro Mori.<br/>
<br/>
The 26-member panel, which is headed by Nobel Physics laureate Reona <br/>
(Leo) Esaki, will draft a final report by the end of the year, after <br/>
conducting public hearings based on the interim report.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;School curricula should be changed to give students diversified <br/>
educational opportunities to help develop their individual abilities,&quot; <br/>
Esaki said, adding that panel members hope the proposals will provoke <br/>
public debate.<br/>
<br/>
The proposal to require students between elementary and high school to <br/>
participate in extracurricular activities reflected the members&#39; anxiety <br/>
about conventional education, which focuses too narrowly on classroom <br/>
studies.<br/>
<br/>
In the report, the panel underlines the pressing need to reform the <br/>
nation&#39;s education system, which it says stands at a crossroads and will <br/>
be useless unless something is done.<br/>
<br/>
The panel cited serious problems such as bullying, truancy and violence <br/>
among young people and proposed that elementary and junior high school <br/>
students spend two weeks performing community service, while high school <br/>
students spend one month.<br/>
<br/>
The panel did not specify what kind of services the students should be <br/>
required to perform.<br/>
<br/>
If enacted, the report says the proposal would change the conventional <br/>
idea of education, which mainly focuses on classroom studies, and will <br/>
give students &quot;opportunities to widen their views on society while <br/>
working for others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The report also says that in the future, the nation should consider <br/>
mandatory community service of one year for everyone aged 18. It lists <br/>
caring for the aged as one of the mandatory social activities.<br/>
<br/>
Other proposals include abolishing the age limit that prevents people <br/>
from entering universities or colleges before they turn 18 and creating <br/>
professional schools, such as law schools and business schools, to train <br/>
experts.<br/>
<br/>
The report also suggests merging about half of the national junior high <br/>
and high schools so single six-year secondary educations can be offered. <br/>
The reform would help ease the current &quot;examination hell&quot; and would <br/>
provide students with a more diversified secondary education, it says.<br/>
<br/>
The panel also said academic years at Japanese universities and colleges, <br/>
which usually begin in April, should instead begin in September.<br/>
<br/>
The report says that while many of the panel&#39;s members felt the need to <br/>
revise the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education to suit present needs, the <br/>
panel has not reached any decisions on how to revise it. The report <br/>
nonetheless says discussions should start toward revising the law.<br/>
<br/>
Mori is keen to revise the law, which has served as the basis of all <br/>
subsequent education laws and ordinances, to include clauses emphasizing <br/>
the importance of Japan&#39;s traditional values and culture.<br/>
<br/>
The prime minister has already expressed his government&#39;s intention to <br/>
draft bills to achieve education reforms based on the panel&#39;s discussions <br/>
and in his policy speech before the Diet the day before he said education <br/>
reform will be a key theme during next year&#39;s regular legislative session.<br/>
<br/>
The panel also includes school teachers and representatives from various <br/>
circles, such as business and the arts.<br/>
