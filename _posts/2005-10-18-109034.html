(after  our game) however, when it came to putting 5/9ths <br/>
into a percent I didn&#39;t  say anything because I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
speak that without being  confusing.  &quot;I&quot; only know how to do it on <br/>
paper to break it  down.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Was she asking?  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s nice to have a little info to share about a subject if you have it,  but <br/>
if you don&#39;t know, say so.  If you don&#39;t know, and she&#39;s not asking,  stop <br/>
talking.  If you don&#39;t know and she&#39;s sorta interested, wonder aloud  about how <br/>
to do it.  She might know already, and have something to  add.  <br/>
 <br/>
For the future, if you want to know how to do something, learn it.   But not <br/>
so you can pass it on....but because the learning is what interested  you.  <br/>
Then, if you get another chance to show her what you&#39;ve learned,  lucky you!  It <br/>
probably won&#39;t happen, though.  <br/>
