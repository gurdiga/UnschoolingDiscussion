<div id="ygrps-yiv-199953193">Kelly  wow, how hard that is when you go to talk about one thing and get<br/>
harassed about something else, I had this from my OB when I was having dd#2,<br/>
went in expecting to talk about antibody levels and came out having been<br/>
done over for contemplating home-birth.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, she&#39;s a college &#39;educated&#39; &#39;expert,&#39; and can&#39;t see past the<br/>
end of her own nose that some people just don&#39;t do it the way she would.  I<br/>
understand that you can&#39;t change doctors, since she&#39;s the only one in your<br/>
area, so this needs a different approach.  How about writing to her, telling<br/>
her what you had expected, what you got and what you felt about it.  If you<br/>
can include info about unschooling and some of the recent stuff posted about<br/>
living without qualifications, that will help &#39;educate&#39; her so you and<br/>
others don&#39;t come up against this crap from her, and if she&#39;s career-minded,<br/>
she might even decide to do a paper on it!  You&#39;re mad as hell right now, so<br/>
maybe you can use some of that mad to let her know just how damaging her<br/>
assumptions are.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, btw, where in WA are you, I have a friend over there...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; What, if anything, should I do about this?  Is this sort of thing to be<br/>
&gt; expected from a psychiatrist?  I am just so shocked.  Maybe I am living<br/>
&gt; in a bubble and this is common discrimination.  Do the rest of you deal<br/>
&gt; with this sort of nonsense?  If so, how do you deal with it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to all who read this whole thing, and thanks in advance to all<br/>
&gt; who respond.  This has really upset me and I feel so alone right now.<br/>
