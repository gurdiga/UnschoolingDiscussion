<div id="ygrps-yiv-11610192">Hi all,<br/>
Okay I have a question for everyone with children over three.  If you <br/>
remember, what was a typical day in your house with children around this age?<br/>
<br/>
While we have not yet done an intent to homeschool, (we still have a little <br/>
while, yet)  some days I get concerned we are just not doing enough (other <br/>
than everyday living).  Ali does knows her ABC, counts to 10 or so, knows <br/>
color and basic shapes, is starting to recognize some letters of the alphabet <br/>
(like A for her name, D for Daddy and M for Mommy).  While I am wanting to <br/>
&quot;trust the process&quot;, I also want to make sure she is learning something while <br/>
we are not emphasizing anything.......any thoughts would be <br/>
appreciated.....thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865318560">3 is just barely not a baby.  3 is for talking and running and playing and<br/>
singing and dancing and kissing and hugging and eating and squealing and<br/>
crying and sleeping and drumming and going and coming.  All lof those are<br/>
*doing verbs*.  How could you not learn when you are so busy doing things?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to do a good job of this, as yesterday was a very long day and<br/>
my husband&#39;s stupid alarm clock woke me up....not him, but me.  He&#39;s still<br/>
asleep over there. So forgive me if I make little sense.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3 year olds are absolutely stunning in the learning department. They are<br/>
watching the entire world, storing away bits and pieces of information.<br/>
Things like when it rains the gutters down my Mrs. B&#39;s house fill up and are<br/>
so much fun to splah in..  now why won&#39;t our gutters fill up???  And when we<br/>
have to go shopping mom spends an inordinate amount of time getting ready?<br/>
Why?  and what is this stuff called money?  and what can&#39;t I have that toy<br/>
in the window, I want it for goodness sakes.  The TV being too loud makes<br/>
Daddy cranky.  These people seem to always want me to be picking stuff up.<br/>
What&#39;s wrong with letting it stay right where  it is??<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s making all of these kinds of connections, and you want her to be able<br/>
to parrot back the ABC&#39;s?  Which by the way make no logical sense .. they<br/>
are just squiggly lines with names.-  Instead she spends  her time thinking<br/>
about the entire world and her place in it.  She needs to know how things<br/>
work and she&#39;s going to ask you a million questions. It&#39;s &quot;inside&quot; those<br/>
million questions where you can see learning is taking place.  And true<br/>
learning has nothing to do with parroting back factoids.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say you don&#39;t sing the ABC song or talk about which letter<br/>
starts mommy. One of my fondest memories is going to the drug store in VA.<br/>
Sara was not quite 3 at the time, and potty trained.  She kept saying P ...<br/>
P... P... and I kept saying okay, we&#39;ll find a potty.... she kept saying<br/>
No... P..... FINALLY,  I realized we were in People&#39;s Drug store and she was<br/>
calling out every &#39;P&#39; she was seeing, which was quite a few. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you spend time living a full and wonderful life, then the experiences<br/>
given your children will be the canvas from which they learn. You will be<br/>
able to trust the process of learning, because you will trust the process of<br/>
living your own life and of sharing it with your children.<br/>
<br/>
And Julie, she&#39;s 3.<br/>

<br/>
English (or native language): <br/>
   Verbal: Talk to your child. Ask questions. Discuss things. Allow child to <br/>
tell you what he or she built/made/is being.<br/>
   Written: Allow your child to draw and color with a variety of things: <br/>
crayon, marker, pen, pencil, paintbrush, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Science: <br/>
  Physics: Bounce things. Throw things. Build tall towers. Mix stuff together <br/>
and see what happens. Let it dry and see what happens.<br/>
   Nature: Go for walks. Go to forest/nature preserve nearby. Discuss small <br/>
animals including domestic animals and how they like/need to be treated. <br/>
Discuss local dangerous animals and proper precautions.<br/>
   Biology: If you know any pregnant, talk about that. If you know any baby <br/>
humans or animals, talk about that. Care for pets if you have any.<br/>
<br/>
Art:  Allow your child to draw and color with a variety of things: crayon, <br/>
marker, pen, pencil, paintbrush, etc. Try water painting on sidewalk. Chalk <br/>
on sidewalk. Watercolors allow exploration of color mixing as they&#39;re painted <br/>

The point? If you label the stuff your child is already doing with <br/>
educational labels, you see there&#39;s a LOT there!<br/>

&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;Okay I have a question for everyone with children over three.  If you<br/>
&gt;remember, what was a typical day in your house with children around &gt;this <br/>
&gt;age?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do have one 3 year old-my bonus baby. My others are way past it. I can <br/>
tell you that when they were all little was the best time of my life. I <br/>
remember Mikey jumping off the counter when he was 3-over and over and over. <br/>
I think that would be learning about gravity. I remember making <br/>
cookies-isn&#39;t that chemistry? Lets see, we planted flowers-earth science, <br/>
found worms-biology. We read books and talked-language arts. We watched <br/>
Sesame Street on satelite from Canada so all my kids thought the last letter <br/>
of the alphabet was zed-foreign language. They counted plates around the <br/>
dinner table-math, once when there were 3 of us around the table someone <br/>
pointed out that we were a C of people-creative thinking. We went to the <br/>
grocery store and learned to push little carts without running in to <br/>
people-force, and social skills. Learning to operate the VCR and the TV-life <br/>
skills?! Oh, the crayons and the scissors-art and fine motor skills. Large <br/>
motor skills too-guess that takes me back to jumping off the counter! And <br/>
none of that even hints on health and nutrition and budgets-I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve <br/>
all heard some about that when they want to go to McDonalds!<br/>
<br/>
Relax, okay? These little people are learning more and learning faster than <br/>
they ever will again. If you want to make sure anyone is learning now, let <br/>
it be living joyously. The kids usually have that one down from birth-its us <br/>
who need the lessons from them.  My last one is a great joy teacher. I learn <br/>
from her all the time. Remember that this is a wondrous and precious time in <br/>
the life of your family. Cherish it and enjoy it, don&#39;t sweat the ABC&#39;s or <br/>
the counting. They will come in their own time. Just have fun with your <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Love<br/>
Cathie<br/>

Do I have your premission to show this post to others? I got into a very<br/>
heated discussion with two school at home moms yesterday. They were<br/>
practically rolling there eyes when I said that we unschool. I could almost<br/>
hear them thinking &quot;so you do nothing all day and your kids don&#39;t learn<br/>
anything&quot;. It was soooo frustrating. I was trying to explain that things<br/>
like discussing the great depression during lunch or doing math fact in the<br/>
car is not doing nothing, but they didn&#39;t get it. I said point blank &quot;My<br/>
child learns better when I don&#39;t shove stuff down her throat&quot;. I mean she<br/>
would not have been interested in learning about the great depression if I<br/>
told her to read about it in some bok. She was interested in it, because we<br/>
were stuffing our faces full of French Fries at Wendy&#39;s and we got talking<br/>
about the movie Annie, which of course, takes place during the depression.<br/>
Sorry to spout off here. I&#39;m still very upset. How dare they imply my kid<br/>
doesn&#39;t learn anything. I bet my kid is smarter than her kid :) (just<br/>
teasing.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064495926">Amy, of course you can use one of my posts-but which one are you talking <br/>
about?! The 3 year old thing?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that that one would convince anyone of anything-we were only <br/>
talking about babies-that one about Daves daughter was really impressive to <br/>
me. Actually I don&#39;t know that you can convince anyone of anything anyway, <br/>
unless they spend some time with your kids and see how interesting and <br/>
intelligent they are.<br/>
<br/>
But of course we know just what you are talking about. Those conversations <br/>
are gold. When you can see something on TV, or a song, or a story, and it <br/>
starts those &#39;lessons&#39;. We have called ourselves carschoolers for a long <br/>
time! Our favorite for the car is trivia-we have had lots of trivia cards <br/>
that we keep in the van, and we found a great Asimov book at Half Price <br/>
Books full of interesting facts that has sparked alot of learning. We read <br/>
stories in the van, sometimes we play spelling games or math facts. When the <br/>
things come up so naturally from your activities and your real life, the <br/>
lessons have so much more meaning than if they are just facts to memorize <br/>
for a while and then forget.<br/>
<br/>
I will have to admit that my boys do not have very good handwriting-but they <br/>
didn&#39;t write neatly when they went to school either, so maybe that is just <br/>
genetic-they can type pretty well, though! Diagramming sentences doesn&#39;t <br/>
come up to often in my real life either, so maybe a ps-er or a <br/>
school-at-homer would be better at that than we are, but guess what-I don&#39;t <br/>
care!!<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t the whole thing just crack you up? I find it pretty funny that <br/>
people really take these things so seriously. Is it really worth all the <br/>
grief to make sure your kid knows all the things that some mysterious <br/>
experts have decided that they must learn by the time they are 6 or 10 or <br/>
16? My Nick-11-hates to do anything remotely schooly, but today he took the <br/>
door apart on the van and fixed the window that was off the track, and <br/>
figured out how to put on new wiper blades and did that. Isn&#39;t that <br/>
something that you do in high school? So, I guess hes ahead of grade level <br/>
there! And I am really proud of him for his ability to see how things work <br/>
and his courage to just jump in there and fix the things that are broken.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for going on and on and on-I really love talking to you all about <br/>
unschooling. Its so good to have others who understand how we do things, and <br/>
don&#39;t look down at you because you see education a little differently than <br/>
most.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, this may not be the kind of reassurance you are looking for, but I do not feel that I am processing my children and feel no need to validate my parenting skills, nor their learning abilities.  My boys are two and three and are bright, happy, funny, sassy little guys.  I enjoy them (when they are not driving me crazy) and am focusing on teaching them social skills and graces at the moment, like the elusive use of siverware and toilets.  <br/>
<br/>
Their main &quot;lessons&quot; are coming from observation and they spend most of their time playing, etc.  When they begin to show an interest in scholastic subjects, I will make them more available than they already are.  Barring that, we have no worries in that dept.<br/>

also forced me to count to ten for him over and over again when he was just over<br/>

remembered them too. We didn&#39;t know she knew numbers til one day at the <br/>
grocery when she started pointing them out on the credit card machine and <br/>
saying them! Same with lower case letters-all of a sudden she was just <br/>
pointing them out and saying them too.<br/>
<br/>
Of course at 2 she didn&#39;t have the fine motor skills to write the letters, <br/>
so we just put her at the computer to type them. Now, at 3, she has finally <br/>
figured out how the mouse works, so she can play the regular toddler games. <br/>
She likes the Living Books-we have a Dr Suess ABC and an Arthur, and one <br/>
called Leap Ahead Preschool that she enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
See, this is why I don&#39;t worry too much about teaching-it just happens from <br/>
the things we do every day. And even though she has learned the letters and <br/>
numbers with such ease, it may be late before she rides a bike or reads a <br/>
book on her own, but I know it will come in its time. It is so peaceful to <br/>
allow it all to unfold naturally. And believe me when I say that in this <br/>
house of the 7 crazies we can use all the peace we can find!!<br/>
