&lt;&lt; I&#39;d like to see a version of the certificate written for the child&#39;s<br/>
perspective.  Maybe this could solve the other concern too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did make one for a particular child, at the mom&#39;s request.  I think they <br/>
had planned to use it a birthday gift, kind of in lieu of a diploma.  But it was <br/>
a particular thing and I&#39;m hesitant to share it out.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could make your own, and just address it to the kid, rephrase where <br/>
applicable, and say mushy things yourself.<br/>
