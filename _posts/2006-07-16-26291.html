<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215150695">Hi everyone,<br/>
I am trying to make plans to be able to attend the conference, and I <br/>
have a few questions. First, do Dads usually attend? I am just <br/>
wondering how things work out when I want to do one thing, and the <br/>
kids will want to do something different? Will I need someone there to <br/>
help with so that I can listen to speakers, etc? I am just not sure <br/>
yet whether dh can come with me. Do most people already know each <br/>
other IRL? Just curious!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

   Hi everyone,<br/>
I am trying to make plans to be able to attend the conference, and I<br/>
have a few questions. First, do Dads usually attend?<br/>
<br/>

You could probably get better answers on the <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:www.liveandlearnconference@yahoogroups.com">www.liveandlearnconference@yahoogroups.com</a> site.<br/>
<br/>
Quickly, here:<br/>
<br/>
Yes, many dads attend. I don&#39;t have the count in my hand right now, but <br/>
I&#39;ll guess we&#39;re at 65 or so right now. Plenty of moms come without the <br/>
dads though. One dad came last year withOUT his wife or child! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am just<br/>
wondering how things work out when I want to do one thing, and the<br/>
kids will want to do something different?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Depends on your kids&#39; ages. If the children are old enough, they can <br/>
just go from funshop to funshop while you do your thing. Some parents <br/>
&quot;tag team&quot; with  littler ones. Some people bring family sitters. There <br/>
are ofte teens willing to strike a deal with you for babysitting during <br/>
the conference. Some people give up on ever hearing a speaker and just <br/>
buy the recordings! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Will I need someone there to<br/>
help with so that I can listen to speakers, etc?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Again, depends on your kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I am just not sure yet whether dh can come with me. Do most people <br/>
already know each<br/>
other IRL? Just curious!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No one knew anyone else IRL before the first conference except maybe <br/>
Sandra Dodd and Lisa Bugg. But the conference has allowed many of us to <br/>
get to know each other IRL and to hang with each other at least once a <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Now many of us are best buds! &lt;G&gt; But if you don&#39;t come, you won&#39;t get <br/>
any closer to knowing us! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, you might want to log onto the conference yahoogroup and ask a <br/>
bunch of questions there.<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875147769">-=-No one knew anyone else IRL before the first conference except maybe<br/>
Sandra Dodd and Lisa Bugg.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I knew Lisa because we liked each other online and met up with some  <br/>
other unschooling families in Indiana once, long ago, for a weekend  <br/>
of hanging out.  We had the downtime of a conference without a hotel  <br/>
or speakers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I knew Joyce because we liked each other online and she and Kathryn  <br/>
came to visit.<br/>
<br/>
There were others I met at that first conference for the first time,  <br/>
but I knew them from writings and sometimes from seeing photographs.   <br/>
Anyone who wants to see photos of what the conference looks like,  <br/>
there are lots of people&#39;s online photos linked at the bottom here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/abq">http://sandradodd.com/abq</a><br/>
<br/>
For some people it helps to just see candid shots of what kinds of  <br/>
things happen.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the unschoolers I have met, I met first online.  That&#39;s been  <br/>
going on for a long, long time, since I was on *Prodigy and a few who  <br/>
wrote on that came to a little state conference in New Mexico so we  <br/>
could meet each other�Karl Bunday, Jim Jackson (now deceased), Cafi  <br/>
Cohen (who had lived in New Mexico before, so had more excuses)...<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian&#39;s family and mine have been friends for a long time  <br/>
now, ten years or nearly so I think.  (Numbers escape me.)   We liked  <br/>
each others&#39; writings, we both had three children at about the same  <br/>
age spread (her set is slightly older than my set, but there was  <br/>
still intertwining of ages), and she offered to pick us up from the  <br/>
airport to take us to the conference because she wouldn&#39;t get to go  <br/>
to the conference, so we got to know each other in her van, and at a  <br/>
lunch stop, and it put an overlay of voices and faces on the words we  <br/>
had exchanged before, and after, and still.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of ways to see some unschoolers in real life, look at  <br/>
their kids when their kids aren&#39;t looking at you, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
There are some local groups and ideas about finding others here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/local">http://sandradodd.com/local</a><br/>
<br/>
And now the internet is MUCH more colorful and full of faces and  <br/>
voices!  You can see photos of kids in action and hear real people&#39;s  <br/>
voices.  There are links here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>
<br/>
So while conferences are fun, those who have no chance of attending  <br/>
are still way ahead of where people were when their only access was,  <br/>
say, Growing Without Schooling magazine, or just a newsgroup of mixed  <br/>
homeschoolers of all sorts.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Okay, then.<br/>
<br/>
Take all the conference talk to the Live and Learn list.  Anyone  <br/>
who&#39;s going to the conference or thinking about the conference, talk  <br/>
about it there instead of here.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want this list to be the cause of unhappiness for people who  <br/>
are too far or too poor or too otherwise-engaged to go to the  <br/>
conference.    People can unschool without conferences.  Let&#39;s talk  <br/>
about other things!<br/>
<br/>
Marty won a grocery bagging contest yesterday.  Got a certificate, a  <br/>
pin, $100 and gets to go to state.  Hmmm... maybe I already told you  <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s brother is coming for three days, with his girlfriend.   <br/>
They&#39;re 60ish, but youngish and funnish.  Ish.<br/>
His way of being, though, although amusing to me, is also  <br/>
exhausting.  He tells us how everything should be done differently,  <br/>
and asks why we do this or that, why we chose one doorknob or DVD  <br/>
player instead of another, and asks the kids irritating questions.   <br/>
They give him zinging smart-ass answers.  Amusing, but tiring.<br/>
<br/>
The girlfriend, I&#39;ve met twice and she&#39;s not easy to guess.  I&#39;m  <br/>
afraid we&#39;ll offer to do too much or too little, but really I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to do anything, because I don&#39;t know her at all, and other than  <br/>
that she likes to go to professional sports things and I don&#39;t, we  <br/>
have nothing in common. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

We have a family coming from Australia this year! Maybe you could jump <br/>
in their luggage. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, Cally! I&#39;d love for you to come too.<br/>

That&#39;s why I was trying to move the discussion over to the L&L group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323994425">I don&#39;t really mind that other people are going to L & L :-)   <br/>
<br/>
But today here it is a cold, rainy, windy, grey, bleak day. The dog <br/>
doesn&#39;t understand why I don&#39;t want to go outside and play in the <br/>
puddles (lakes more like!) and mud. The chooks (NZ speak for hens, <br/>
chickens) glared at me when I went to feed them and collect eggs, even <br/>
the cow seems to think I am personally responsible for her discomfort! <br/>
So hearing about you guys all planning something exciting <br/>
seems....hmmmm....well, it felt a bit bleaker here. But Jeff (16) and I <br/>
are off to start a night class in computing shortly - new things to <br/>
learn, new people to meet - so I&#39;m feeling a bit better - though getting <br/>
from car to classroom might be a soggy experience! Still, it will be <br/>
fun, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
