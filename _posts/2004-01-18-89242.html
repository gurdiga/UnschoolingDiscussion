Hi, have any of you heard of books on CD?  I would like to get some <br/>
childrens books for my daughter to listen to in the car but we only <br/>
have a CD player.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
All the Harry Potter books are available on CD. Jim Weiss sells MANY on CD. <br/>
Check out the library. As for &quot;on the road&quot;----The Cracker Barrel has its own <br/>
library and theyy can be dropped off at any Cracker Barrel.<br/>
