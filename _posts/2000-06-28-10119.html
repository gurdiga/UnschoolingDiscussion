<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420902383"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, to be exact, I&#39;ve never called my kids worthless little mf&#39;ers.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is just one incident, there are many, many more that have been documented<br/>
&gt; but I didn&#39;t think I needed to write a book, I just included one of her<br/>
&gt; nastier moments that happened to get caught on tape.  And, if I had my<br/>
&gt; children at work, I certainly wouldn&#39;t berate them in front of all my<br/>
&gt; employees, either&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since I have never heard the tape, and probably never will, I won&#39;t say that<br/>
she never said that.  You do need to be careful about listening to patial<br/>
tape recordings, especially when produced by people who don&#39;t like the one<br/>
&quot;caught&quot; on tape.  I will say that the comment sounds highly out of<br/>
character for Dr. Laura.<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to jump to her defense here, I don&#39;t like all that she says<br/>
or believes in either, but it sounds t me like some of you are tarring and<br/>
feathering her because you don&#39;t like her views.  What happened to &quot;don&#39;t be<br/>
judgemental&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Laura is an observant Jew, so it stands to reason that she would call<br/>
homosexuality a sin.  She believes in the Old Testament, and homosexuality<br/>
is called a sin there.  I have never heard her condemn homosexuals, just the<br/>
behavior.  I have heard her support adoption rights for homosexual couples,<br/>
so I have difficulty believing that she hates all homosexuals.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you have condemned her for &quot;not living what she preaches&quot; because<br/>
she is not at home with her son, and instead works.  Her son goes to school,<br/>
and she works during the hours he is in school only.  Her husband is a full<br/>
time parent for their son.  Why on earth would you condemn her for this?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She&#39;s also a religous bigot.  Oh, and did I mention an expert on all<br/>
&gt; religions that she has never heard of.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have never heard her be a religious bigot.  She is open about her own<br/>
religious choice, and the journey that brought her there, but I haven&#39;t<br/>
heard her demean any other religion.  Have you?</div>
