<div><font color="#008080" size="4">I have had a few really intense conversations 
with my 14 yo son this week. He is the one who chose to be in public school this 
year. He expressed the fear of not being able to motivate himself if he were 
unschooling. He thought he needed the school to tell him what to do. We 
discussed what a college environment is really like.&nbsp;You don&#39;t get 
detention for not doing your homework. He was shocked to realise&nbsp;that. I 
explained to him he could persue whatever he wanted to learn about. It is better 
to learn how to motivate yourself at fourteen than in your first year of 
college. Professors don&#39;t hold your hand.You succeed if you put the effort 
forth. He decided he wants to learn about the FBI and law enforcement. He begged 
me to take him out tomorrow! He wants to go to the library to do research.  I 
have had a rather difficult year with this child and this is a major victory!
