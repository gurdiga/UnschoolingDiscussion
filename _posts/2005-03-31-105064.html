<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497681543">Hi, Tracie,<br/>
<br/>
My 14 yo son John sounds a lot like your daughter - same interests and <br/>
definitely a night owl.   He was born that way, needing little sleep, not <br/>
napping, and now for the past two years staying up all night most nights. <br/>
In that time he has taught himself (with the help of on-line friends) 2-3 <br/>
computer languages and is learning more, writes game reviews, is creating a <br/>
computer game, is webmaster of a site (off and on - I&#39;m not sure right now), <br/>
and plays games on-line or alone.   He reads, enjoys sci-fi and anime, <br/>
watches TV and movies, builds with legos, and enjoys arranging his star wars <br/>
collection.  He also is into theater and works on his lines at night alone <br/>
or with his 12 yo brother (it&#39;s no longer cool for mom to help much).  If <br/>
John has something going on early in the day, he&#39;ll (try to) go to sleep <br/>
early the night before (early being between midnight and 2).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think he&#39;s blossoming with unschooling (as we are Roses, I <br/>
think all my children blossom&lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I agree with others who say please let your daughter do what is natural for <br/>
her.  Just because the world says that children should live on a school&#39;s <br/>
timetable, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right or good for every child.   Ben Franklin <br/>
may have ben right about some things, but I don&#39;t believe that &quot;early to bed <br/>
and early to rise make[ a person] healthy, wealthy and wise!&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS - It sounds like you&#39;re doing great for just starting out!  Best wishes <br/>
as you continue.</div>

He seems not to have practiced  what he preached, that party boy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
