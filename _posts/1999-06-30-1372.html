Who knows Lyn - maybe yours will.  I think it depends on the child.  <br/>
Right now,  my 19 year old is more demanding of my time than my 13 <br/>
year old.  Go figure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880955290">Thanks everyone for your great responses to my question- I&#39;m beginning to<br/>
see the incredible oportunity for me to follow my own interests and be a<br/>
true example of unschooling myself.<br/>
<br/>
Helen- &lt;&lt;What makes the schooled side of you think they&#39;re not already<br/>
learning plenty?&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I was the &quot;good&quot; student- on the honor roll, strict British school<br/>
system- grades and tests were everything. I can see that my children are<br/>
learning a lot, but not necessarily the things that society says they are<br/>
supposed to. In my heart I know that times tables are not essential to my<br/>
nine-year old&#39;s being right now, but my head is still nervous about it:).<br/>
It&#39;s very hard to move away from that mindset. Zoe has incredible gifts in<br/>
areas I consider more important than academics, but next to her public<br/>
school friends, she is not reading on her own, her math skills are not as<br/>
strong, we haven&#39;t even begun on foreign languages, on and on. And<br/>
sometimes, knowing that she is wonderful with animals and gifted in<br/>
drawing, doesn&#39;t quell my fears that I need to be teaching her more.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with your comment about making oneself available during certain<br/>
hours- not for me either. I guess I don&#39;t really have a problem knowing<br/>
what to do with myself- I just feel guilty about it! When I look at those<br/>
around me- always stressed out to get their kids somewhere- I just smile<br/>
and think how I&#39;ve got it made. We have an amazingly peaceful life. But I<br/>
do feel guilty because my husband is out working a not so wonderful job so<br/>
that I can be here with the girls. I have to work on that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again for the discussion- you are all so inspiring:).<br/>
<br/>

PS Thanks Diane for blowing my theory that they will need me more as they<br/>
get older!!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Diane&#39;s a friend of mine, but we don&#39;t always agree on this one!  I often tell<br/>
people that I think teens take a lot more time than younger kids do.  Or maybe<br/>
it&#39;s just a different kind of time that takes a lot more out of me?  It&#39;s less<br/>
showing and explaining the &quot;facts&quot; and a lot more agonizing over the whys and<br/>
wherefores.  I can&#39;t begin to add of the number of hours we&#39;ve spent talking<br/>
and talking over things.  And it takes a lot more of my thinking time, both<br/>
during and after the conversations.  Lots of questions for the younger years<br/>
were &quot;two minute flybys&quot;; these questions are more like two hour - or two day<br/>
- in depth, soul searching things.<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe your theory isn&#39;t totally blown &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
