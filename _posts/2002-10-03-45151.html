<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790687232">Tomorrow I&#39;m leaving town for three and a half days.  I&#39;m going to Houston, <br/>
or at least Dallas, I guess, depending on how Southwest feels about flying <br/>
toward hurricanes.<br/>
<br/>
The plan, though is Saturday, in Houston, me:<br/>
<br/>
Saturday 8:30- 9:30- Learning (or Remembering) How to Learn Sandra Dodd<br/>
Keynote Saturday 12:30- How Unschooling Will Change the World <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the #2 keynote.  The main slot is David Albert.<br/>
<br/>
The website, for anyone who might be in that area and need to evacuate <br/>
anyway, come on up to the Sheraton Brookhollow.<br/>
