This is really helpful for me.  I think that this kind of thinking will help me say yes more often.  Thank-you!  At other times of uncertainty, I have journalled (kind of like a food diary) and taken note of whatever it is I&#39;m having a hard time trusting.  So, in this case, without the kids noticing, I could journal through a few days or week of theirs (and my) food choices when there were no limits, and probably find at the end of a week that things nutritionally were fine.  And, of course, as mentioned numerous times, the kids would be great because they&#39;re being trusted.    <br/>
