In response (or defense) to &quot;teachers like me&quot;<br/>
I am not like the rest!!!!<br/>
You assumed I am due to my statement about &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; <br/>
Come on...<br/>
You aren&#39;t aware that I often have the mean child play with the other kid, <br/>
with me there.. eat lunch together... work mediation.. not simply an &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry&quot; and the problem is fixed and I turned my back and go on with my <br/>
business.<br/>
That is how most of my collegues are; I am NOT one of those.<br/>
So, there are some exceptions to the stereotypical classing of teachers.<br/>
In my classroom are a few of the following things:<br/>
* half room with no lighting<br/>
* a rug mat for kids to remove shoes<br/>
* refrigerator for kids who choose to bring snacks (that need refrigeration)<br/>
<br/>
You might observe in my classroom:<br/>
* Kids laying on the floor-- under tables...<br/>
* Kids twirling when reading<br/>
* Buddy help<br/>
* Spelling testing NOT done of paper but given orally to me or buddy..<br/>
<br/>
Just a small window into &quot;my teaching world&quot; in public school.<br/>
You&#39;d have to really know me, and I believe then you wouldn&#39;t have lumped me <br/>
with the rest.<br/>
But I understand your stereotyping.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, we unschool our kids too!  :-)<br/>

role? How do you do it? The reason I ask is I know many moms hs their kids <br/>
and work outside the home as well, they just work more unconventional hours. <br/>
I have often wondered how people who work the more conventional 9 to 5 type <br/>
job do it. The question isn&#39;t a reflection on that you are a teacher, just on <br/>
how you work hsing in with more conventional work hours. <br/>

Dear BJ,<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry for being so harsh in response to your well intended words. I <br/>
still have a great deal of bitterness about the cruelty that my son was <br/>
subjected to. <br/>
<br/>
Since you are a school teacher, and I have your ear, I&#39;d like to tell you <br/>
some of what I think might help the situation in schools today. First problem <br/>
I believe is that we seem to be living in a time when it is somehow <br/>
politically not correct to place blame. If you look into the reality of <br/>
bullying, it is quite different from a typical squabble between playmates. A <br/>
squabble generally erupts because of a temporary misunderstanding between a <br/>
couple of friends. If the adult intervenes, mediates and helps the children <br/>
to figure out where they went wrong, the problem is usually quickly resolved <br/>
and everyone resumes playing. <br/>
<br/>
In the case of bullying, you have usually a child with poor social skills and <br/>
usually &quot;different&quot; in some way. The difference in my son&#39;s case is that he <br/>
is more advanced intellectually than his age mates, and behind in emotional <br/>
maturity, and thinks way outside of the box. Everything he says is considered <br/>
weird and therefore held in contempt. The &quot;difference&quot; can be just about <br/>
anything though--race, religion, clothing, culture, body size, you name it. <br/>
The bully on the other hand is usually someone who may at first feel inferior <br/>
for whatever reason. He/She  needs to find someone even lower in the pecking <br/>
order so that he/she can think &quot;Well I may be a loser, but at least I&#39;m not <br/>
Weird, black, Hindu, unfashionable, listen to stupid music, fat/puny, you <br/>
name it and therefore I am one step up from the bottom of the heap&quot; &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
better.&quot; Pretty soon the bully realizes that picking on the &quot;different&quot; one, <br/>
is not only useful as a tool for self social promotion but it gives one a <br/>
heady feeling of POWER! We all know how addictive power is. The bully has now <br/>
made the mental transition from &quot;I&#39;m inferior&quot; to &quot;I&#39;m superior.&quot; We are now <br/>
far from the realm of misunderstandings where a little heart to heart and <br/>
play session will solve anything. Unfortunately the adults who could actually <br/>
intervene and put a stop to all of this are frequently clueless as to what is <br/>
really going on because they either believe that all youthful disagreements <br/>
are innocent misunderstandings, are not paying attention to the situation <br/>
and/or don&#39;t give a damn. Kids really can be extremely mean, just because <br/>
they derive pleasure from feeling superior. This is bad and evil behavior, <br/>
and should be called such, at whatever age. You need to truly identify a <br/>
problem before you can deal with it. Sadistic adults, thugs, wife beaters, <br/>
and unethical CEOs don&#39;t just appear out of nowhere. They are raised and <br/>
groomed by well meaning clueless or careless adults.<br/>
<br/>
How to deal with all of this... First, adults must have many many discussions <br/>
about the fact that just because the majority thinks or acts a certain way, <br/>
does not mean they are somehow superior, or correct. A great method in <br/>
schools would be regular circle discussions involving all of the kids.( <br/>
Bullying usually occurs in front of an audience of other kids, and frequently <br/>
as a way to impress them) led by an adult who knows the score and who <br/>
introduces provocative subjects such as &quot;What would you say or do if you saw <br/>
a kid kick another kid? What if the kid who had been kicked was somebody who <br/>
is considered a nerd? What if the nerd had said something nasty or stupid, <br/>
would he deserve it then? Why do you think the nerd might have said something <br/>
nasty? Do you think it might have been because he might have seen the other <br/>
kid mimicking him?&quot;  Other examples of subjects could cover basic right vs. <br/>
wrong issues such as &quot;If someone took $20.00 out of someone&#39;s backpack, would <br/>
you consider that stealing? If someone took a pencil out of someone&#39;s <br/>
backpack, would that be considered stealing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Next, adults have to actually pay attention. Lastly, once there is a general <br/>
consensus about what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is <br/>
bad, then there must be some reliable rewards and punishments/consequences. <br/>
Most people in power unfortunately will never relinquish power unless forced, <br/>
 even though they may know that they are abusing that power. A bully must be <br/>
put into a position where he/she only stands to lose when they bully. That is <br/>
the way to get them off of their power trip. The other kids and adults are <br/>
really critical, because they can boo, applaud or silently give their consent <br/>
to the bully. They can&#39;t boo the bad behavior and have a positive influence <br/>
if they can&#39;t see bad and evil behavior for what it really is. Evil requires <br/>
an atmosphere of ignorance and apathy to flourish. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208270273">First, you&#39;re telling a teacher something teachers know, about the difference <br/>
between squables and bullying.<br/>
<br/>
You expect teachers to deal with, prevent or cure bullying?  Bosses don&#39;t. <br/>
The military doesn&#39;t.  The police can&#39;t.  Why do you think teachers can?<br/>
<br/>
And this is not as correct or as simple as it seems to you:<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
 Sadistic adults, thugs, wife beaters, <br/>
and unethical CEOs don&#39;t just appear out of nowhere. They are raised and <br/>
groomed by well meaning clueless or careless adults.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes by well-meaning and malicious adults.<br/>
Or sometimes the child gets a genetic package from sadistic unethical parents <br/>
and grandparents, and a bad example of behavior (and encouragement to follow <br/>
right along) from a violent thug of a parent (or two), and are ENCOURAGED to <br/>
get into college and a job by whatever means, and to ruthlessly obtain and <br/>
keep money.  In the United States that is considered by  most people to be <br/>
&quot;success.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like it, but I can&#39;t fix it.<br/>
<br/>
The best I can do is help my children be prepared to be happy whether they&#39;re <br/>
rich or not.  And I can stand up to people I think are being unethical, <br/>
whether it&#39;s in clubs or social groups, or on bulletin boards or e-mail loops.<br/>
<br/>
And what happens when someone says &quot;I don&#39;t think that behavior is right&quot;?  <br/>
They are ostracized, insulted and ridiculed.  Even if they&#39;re teachers.<br/>
