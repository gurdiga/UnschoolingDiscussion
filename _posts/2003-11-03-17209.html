** I am a<br/>
&gt; homeopath and**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another OT,<br/>
<br/>
I see Norma is a homeopath and am wondering about others experiences with<br/>
homeopathy.<br/>
<br/>
We just got a dog.  I love animals and so do the kids,  but I have dog<br/>
allergies and my ds does too.<br/>
<br/>
I know,  stupid to get one,  but we saw her at the human society&#39;s adopt<br/>
clinic and we were going to keep it outside, heated garage,  blah, blah,<br/>
blah.   Well,  I/we couldn&#39;t keep her out there,  she looked lonely,  so<br/>
she&#39;s in the house now.<br/>
<br/>
We love her to death,  kids have been so happy with her.   But my allergies<br/>
are kicking in and so are my ds and even dh&#39;s, I think, (we didn&#39;t know he<br/>
was allergic to dogs)<br/>
<br/>
Any of you use homeopathic remedies for this,  on a continual basis?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I picked up Animal Hair and Dander Refief from a Natural Food place.  Seems<br/>
to kind-of work.  Little scared to use it with my son,  did give him a small<br/>
dose.    There was some warning about asthma sufferers and he and I have a<br/>
touch of asthma.<br/>
<br/>
Norma, if you don&#39;t mind,  could I e-mail you off list too?<br/>

&gt; Lots of experience with ankle and other injuries here.  I am a<br/>
&gt; homeopath and my daughter is a 16-year-old competitive figure<br/>
&gt; skater.  She falls dozens of times every day, at high speed, and<br/>
&gt; hard.  A month or so ago she dislocated her shoulder.  Last week she<br/>
&gt; had a huge swollen bruise on her thigh.  It is always something in<br/>
&gt; high level figure skating.<br/>

This is precisely the type of question that I answer on my homeopathy <br/>
list.  Sign in and ask away there.  Others are welcome to join, too.  <br/>
That way this list can stay on topic.  <br/>
