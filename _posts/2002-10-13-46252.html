 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know where or how the term *Radical Unschooler* came about, most of <br/>
us here are either unschoolers, or in search of unschooling. I would guess <br/>
that a radical unschooler is one that extends unschooling into a way of life. <br/>
One that sees unschooling as more than just a way to educate but as a way of <br/>
life, a philosophy. (anyone who has a better explanation....) One thing I <br/>
have never, ever heard an unschooler, radical or not, say is that they *let* <br/>
their children be destructive in the name of unschooling because it is &quot;what <br/>
the child needs to do.&quot; I do know of a family who has a very artistic <br/>
daughter. She has decorated her room in her own way. The walls are painted by <br/>
her, in an ever-changing mural. Her Mom has said on many occasions that, if <br/>
need be, she can just paint it all over, its good that her dd can express <br/>
herself and they encourage it. In my own home, the attic accesses are in my <br/>
kids rooms. They are little doors close to the floor. I have painted those <br/>
with blackboard paint, and my kids color away on those little doors. Coloring <br/>
on the walls in the name of doing what you want to do because you need to do <br/>
it isn&#39;t unschooling. Giving your children the freedom to express themselves <br/>
in their own space isn&#39;t a bad thing. Is this contradictory? I don&#39;t think <br/>
so, but some might.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524156539">Sounds like TCS, which taken out of context can be seen as &quot;out of control&quot; to<br/>
outsiders. Those who want to explore the TCS viewpoint should check out their<br/>
website. Debating it without understanding where they are coming from is<br/>
pretty senseless. It does seem pretty extreme to those who think they have a<br/>
right to tell their children how to live their lives. [ I am not TCS and am<br/>
not affiliate with the site. ;) ]<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschoolers are *us*. On other lists the term is used to distinguish<br/>
those who unschool from those relaxed homeschoolers who follow some kind of<br/>
prescribed curriculum guides, like math or english of some sort on a regular<br/>
schedule. Guess it is just so much fun to call oneself an unschooler than<br/>
everyone wants to whether they do or not. Letting go of control seems<br/>
important. <br/>

<br/>
Actually Nancy, to me it is clear. I was just wondering about it and was <br/>
only relaying the thought as it was conveyed to me. I was the one that <br/>
mentioned radical unschoolers only because my friend said they had a name <br/>
for their beliefs. Radical was the only term I had heard of but not used as <br/>
she mentioned. I was on a radical unschoolers list years ago and didn&#39;t see <br/>
mention of letting kids destroy things. It was a just a word I thought maybe <br/>
she was thinking of. I have no problem with kids decorating their own rooms. <br/>
You should see my kids walls!!!!! The oldest just recently pulled off her <br/>
naked Abercrombie and Fitch models to substitute Eminem. I like the naked <br/>
guys better!!<br/>
<br/>
But again my friend said this particular group would actually let the kids <br/>
draw where they wanted with no thought as to paint the walls with blackboard <br/>
paint or even hang paper up. Just let them at it wherever.<br/>
Again, not sure how accurate her account of all this is.<br/>
