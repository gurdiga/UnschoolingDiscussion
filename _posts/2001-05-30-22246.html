&gt; &lt;&lt;  I learned the hard way about what was best for me, how<br/>
&gt; I learn best, what my own goals were. I could have avoided all of that had I<br/>
&gt; been &quot;allowed&quot; out of school at a much younger age. I am positive of this. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I loved school.  I look back now and see things I wish could have been<br/>
&gt; different<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Giving my kids the choice of going to school is the only thing left, I<br/>
think, that I have any real angst over in our homeschooling decision.<br/>
Luckily it has not been much of an issue. Brit said, once, that she&#39;d like<br/>
to go to school. I asked why, and she said, &quot;I think they paint more there.&quot;<br/>
&lt;g&gt; I told her she was welcome to paint as much as she liked at home, and<br/>
would that do? It would.<br/>
<br/>
But if it *really* came up, it&#39;s my cold sweat issue. On the one hand, I<br/>
totally believe that choice is where it&#39;s at. On the other hand, I totally<br/>
believe that for 90% or more of kids, schooling is really, really bad (and<br/>
some of the really, really bad happens without them even knowing it, much<br/>
less knowing to ask to get out of it -- some of the really, really bad is<br/>
stuff that happens to kids in school-at-home situations, for that matter).<br/>
<br/>
So, here I fence-sit. &lt;g&gt; Knowing me, it is probable that if they really,<br/>
really, REALLY (have I said &quot;really&quot; enough in this post? Really!) wanted to<br/>
go, I&#39;d find the best possible school scenario, be ready with subversive<br/>
counterpoint &lt;g&gt;, and let them. &quot;You can&#39;t&quot; isn&#39;t a phrase I use much, or<br/>
want to.<br/>

have never understood the people who hated school defending it and then<br/>
sending their own kids!<br/>

<br/>
When I&#39;ve asked others that question, the response I&#39;ve gotten is usually<br/>
along the lines that if they themselves<br/>
had had the advantages that they now provide for their kids, they would have<br/>
loved school.<br/>
I felt like that at one time, and spent my later school years thinking &quot;If I<br/>
have kids, they are going to have the lessons and<br/>
the tutors and the cheering mom on the sidelines.&quot; &quot;They are going to be too<br/>
busy to get into *trouble.*&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most of the schooling parents I know and talk to at lessons or<br/>
whatever, are implementing the plan that I had at 17, of &quot;making their kids<br/>
competitive,&quot; to make up for what<br/>
they didn&#39;t do, in some cases. Not all. I try not to think in terms of &quot;all<br/>
schooling parents...&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the schooling parents I like the most, are just not able to<br/>
homeschool, they feel. They are protesting Fcats and<br/>
telling their kids that they are not their grade. I&#39;m cheering them from the<br/>
sidelines.<br/>
