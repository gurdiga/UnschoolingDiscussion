<div id="ygrps-yiv-742158329">Okay, I have been absorbing all of your advice regarding my daughter <br/>
and her attitude.  I have been realizing that your words are ringing <br/>
true, and what I&#39;m doing isn&#39;t working.  I didn&#39;t know better, my <br/>
father was controlling.  It&#39;s what I know, or should I say, KNEW.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, what now?  Do I have a heart to heart with my <br/>
daughter, and tell her there will be no punishments from me any <br/>
longer?  She no longer needs to brush her teeth, or clean her room?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, what about when she does slam that playstation out of <br/>
frustration.  Just sit and wait - if she breaks it, she pays for it?  <br/>
(She and her brother share it).  If she slams her violin in <br/>
frustration, how shall I handle it?  There need to be basic, <br/>
considerate rules, for instance she can&#39;t throw things at the big <br/>
screen tv, and can&#39;t color on the walls...  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, Sandra, I caught a posting the other day where you had asked <br/>
the boys to stay inside (am I getting it right?) - what if they <br/>
hadn&#39;t listened to you, and had gone outside anyway, and were loud <br/>
and disruptive?  How would you have handled that?  <br/>
<br/>
Please excuse the ignorant questions, this concept is so new to me!  <br/>
I would have punished with priviledges lost, or no allowance in the <br/>
past.  Give me the tools, please!</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d suggest a book called &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline&quot;. <br/>
I&#39;m not crazy about the title, and I hate the picture on the cover of <br/>
the book (I suspect these came from the marketing department), but <br/>
the book itself is a gold mine of information on how to go from <br/>
punitive parenting into a child-respecting mode, without just <br/>
becoming a doormat for your kids to walk on. It is very eye-opening. <br/>
All other parenting books I&#39;ve read have had some excellent parts to <br/>
them, but this is the foundation of information that they all stand <br/>
on that I felt was missing. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do I have a heart to heart with my <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you can tell her there will be no more punishments. Does that <br/>
mean she no longer needs to brush her teeth? My own personal answer <br/>
would be no. Stepping away from punitive parenting doesn&#39;t mean you <br/>
have to become a completely permissive parent and allow your kids to <br/>
do anything. Teeth brushing is one of those things that is mandatory <br/>
in our house. Then again, I have a very sensory-avoidant first child <br/>
for whom teeth brushing is extremely difficult - it used to be on the <br/>
order of being tortured with hot irons - so I let it go for 2 years. <br/>
$2,000 of dental work for him under general anesthesia later, I <br/>
decided it was mandatory and we found ways to get past the sensory <br/>
issues. Live and learn!<br/>
<br/>
We brush our teeth in the morning, and it must be done before we <br/>
leave the house. We brush our teeth at night, and it must be done <br/>
before I read stories. Sometimes it takes longer, sometimes shorter, <br/>
I help the kids when they want help, but it always gets done. <br/>
Sometimes they just do it, sometimes they request silly songs or <br/>
tooth brushing games. I think one important part of stepping away <br/>
from punitive parenting is removing anger as a response. This is <br/>
really, really tough! Being kind, patient, but firm is not something <br/>
most of us have in our parenting tool box, so we have to acquire it <br/>
somehow, and practice it daily. It&#39;s really easy to descend into <br/>
anger when you expect them to do something, like brush their teeth in <br/>
the next 5 minutes, and it doesn&#39;t get done. The anger itself is <br/>
punitive, though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, what about when she does slam that playstation out of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>it?  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (She and her brother share it). <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the rule in our house is that you can slam, throw, or hit soft <br/>
objects (foam balls, pillows), but that if hard objects get slammed <br/>
around or thrown, they go up until they can be used respectfully. <br/>
Usually that&#39;s just a few minutes until the person calms down. This <br/>
is a safety issue for me, and non-negotiable.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I reiterate with my kids constantly is the <br/>
following &quot;Mom jobs&quot;. I tell them:<br/>
<br/>
My first job is to love you<br/>
My second job is to keep you safe<br/>
My third job is to keep you healthy<br/>
My fourth job is to help you find happiness<br/>
<br/>
So if my child is doing something dangerous (throwing a hard object), <br/>
it&#39;s my job to make sure they can&#39;t hurt themselves, things in our <br/>
house, or others with that object. Reminding them of my jobs first, <br/>
keeps it first in our hearts that I love them, and that I&#39;m trying to <br/>
keep them safe and healthy. It lets them know that I&#39;m trying to work <br/>
with them, not against them. Often, I ask them for creative ways that <br/>
we can solve a particular problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If she slams her violin in <br/>
&gt; frustration, how shall I handle it? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess that depends on how/why this is happening. Maybe she isn&#39;t <br/>
ready to be playing a delicate instrument if she is still in the <br/>
phase where she is slamming things around. Maybe you could have a <br/>
talk with her about the instrument, why it is valuable, other ways <br/>
she can take out her frustrations. Maybe have an alternative punching <br/>
bag sitting next to her while she practices that she knows she can <br/>
hit? A basket of nerf balls she can throw? Or find ways to reduce the <br/>
frustration she&#39;s feeling while playing? Does she feel a lot of <br/>
pressure to play it well (either coming from herself or her teacher <br/>
or others)? Are there ways to mitigate that pressure?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There need to be basic, <br/>
&gt; considerate rules, for instance she can&#39;t throw things at the big <br/>
&gt; screen tv, and can&#39;t color on the walls...  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Abandoning punitive parenting doesn&#39;t mean you have to go into <br/>
permissive parenting and just have a free-for-all anything-goes kind <br/>
of atmosphere. I found that it takes a paradigm shift. You have to <br/>
get more creative, think of yourself as someone who is helping your <br/>
kids learn the skills necessary to get along with other people, find <br/>
solutions to problems, find creative ways to vent anger, etc. This is <br/>
what I personally mean by &quot;positive parenting&quot;, and we&#39;ve found it <br/>
does work well in our family. My kids know that I&#39;m on their side, <br/>
but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I&#39;m going to guarantee their <br/>
happiness. If they break something, they need to find a way to help <br/>
fix it. I will help them problem-solve, assist them in any way they <br/>
can, but they take responsibility for their actions.<br/>

to Discipline&quot;. I felt that more than any other book, this one <br/>
was &quot;the toolbox&quot;. Of course, it depends on what you are striving <br/>
for. I found this book to be about positive parenting in a way that <br/>
didn&#39;t descend into permissiveness, which was exactly what I was <br/>
looking for.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I saw things like &quot;Whoa! What&#39;s going on?&quot;.And then I listen. If she<br/>
seems up for it, I might go over and give the playstation a &#39;voice&#39; -<br/>
&quot;No, no, please don&#39;t beat me, I&#39;ll never cheat agaiiiinnnn!&quot; or maybe<br/>
we&#39;ll shout &quot;THIS GAME SUCKS!&quot; really loud... or whatever. The message is<br/>
that I&#39;m here, I can see that you&#39;re frustrated, and I&#39;m on your side.<br/>
During a calmer moment, I might talk about breakage possibilities, maybe<br/>
mention my old nintendo that had one wire pulled loose and it was never<br/>
really well-fixed, that part always kept breaking... but it seems to me<br/>
that the newer machines are sturdier.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to start in the middle, so to speak. When kids have lived for 9<br/>
years like this, without punishments, they just act differently. You&#39;re<br/>
having to undue old patterns while creating new ones, and during the<br/>
process, things may get broken. Your &quot;test&quot; will be to respond without<br/>
punishment - to be honest about how you feel, to talk about the results<br/>
of those actions, but to work towards making things better.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My question is, what now?  Do I have a heart to heart with my <br/>
daughter, and tell her there will be no punishments from me any <br/>
longer?  She no longer needs to brush her teeth, or clean her room?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would go into it gradually.  I would ask her more questions so there was <br/>
more communication from you to her, in the way of useful, loving, patient <br/>
communication rather than telling her how she screwed up.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of saying &quot;You don&#39;t need to clean up your room ever&quot; (which isn&#39;t <br/>
right or true), maybe &quot;I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ve been worrying too much about how <br/>
your room looks and not enough about how you feel, or how much we&#39;re <br/>
together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe go do something with her without cleaning the kitchen first, and say <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s just leave the messes and clean up later.&quot;  That would be a clue to <br/>
her too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, what about when she does slam that playstation out of <br/>
frustration. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Kirby had that problem.  Broke a couple of controllers just dashing them on <br/>
the ground. <br/>
<br/>
Two things helped:  Him getting older, and us getting carpet.<br/>
<br/>
(I bought another controller and said &quot;THIS IS MINE, not yours, and I don&#39;t <br/>
want it broken.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If she slams her violin in <br/>
frustration, how shall I handle it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
Tell her she needs to make a $400 deposit before she slams that around.  Just <br/>
say it like it will be okay for her to slam it once her deposit is in the <br/>
bank on it.  Say it like a joke, but mean it about &#39;no slamming.&#39;   <br/>
<br/>
And if she really can&#39;t play without that much frustration, just wait a year <br/>
or three and see if she wants to take up the violin again.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There need to be basic, <br/>
considerate rules, for instance she can&#39;t throw things at the big <br/>
screen tv, and can&#39;t color on the walls...  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think when the overall tone of the relationship changes, much of the <br/>
frustration level will be lower and you won&#39;t have all those problems.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, Sandra, I caught a posting the other day where you had asked <br/>
the boys to stay inside (am I getting it right?) - what if they <br/>
hadn&#39;t listened to you, and had gone outside anyway, and were loud <br/>
and disruptive?  How would you have handled that?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since I had a broken leg and was stuck on the couch, it wouldn&#39;t have been <br/>
easy.<br/>
<br/>
I would have called Logan&#39;s mom (I always collect and save every possible <br/>
phone number, home work and cell on every human my kids might be with) and <br/>
tell her to come over.  I would have told her the problems I had the last <br/>
time Logan had been here, and asked her to take him home and talk to him <br/>
about being better  here or not being here at all.<br/>
<br/>
I would have just told Jeremy to go to sleep.  He&#39;s more sensitive, and his <br/>
mom would have punished him too much.  Probably grounding for two weeks and <br/>
extra chores.  And since Marty likes to play with Jeremy, it would have ended <br/>
up punishing Marty too.  <br/>
<br/>
And I would have had Marty get me some food and drink, feed the dogs and <br/>
cats, turn off extra lights--useful actually needed stuff with me stuck on <br/>
the couch, but which also would have gotten some of his adrenaline out, and <br/>
me time to breathe.  And then I would have talked to him  calmly about WHY I <br/>
didn&#39;t want them out, and tell him if he didn&#39;t really believe in CPS, that I <br/>
do.  And we don&#39;t need the neighbors grumpy at us.  And I need to know where <br/>
they are, and if either of the boys&#39; moms had called at midnight I did NOT <br/>
want my answer to be &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; but &quot;He&#39;s right here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the next time Marty asked if Logan could come over I would ask Marty if <br/>
he felt like he could control Logan a little better, and without an <br/>
affirmative answer, I would have said &quot;yes, but not to spend the night.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Parts of all of that have happened before, and I know both of the moms pretty <br/>
well.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t.  I&#39;d let her figure it out gradually.  You could say you&#39;re <br/>
unhappy that you punished her so much and so often and you wish you hadn&#39;t.  <br/>
You could ask her for ideas about what to do in cases in which you would once <br/>
have punished.  Probably for a while she will suggest things stronger than <br/>
you actually want to do.  And you could go with that, saying &quot;I think <br/>
grounded for a week is too much.  What you did only took a second, and you <br/>
already seem sorry about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gradually moving from one mode to another might make her feel more secure and <br/>
you too.<br/>

<br/>
I wonder if the cover of the book disturbed you more than the statement above <br/>
might disturb many of the parents on this list who are neither punitive nor <br/>
doormats.<br/>
<br/>
The fear that ceasing punishments is the same as becoming a doormat is what <br/>
causes lots of people to justify being mean and vindictive parents.  Because <br/>
they don&#39;t have another model of a healthy family (or that they have NO <br/>
models of happy families with cooperative kids who aren&#39;t being grounded or <br/>
spanked).<br/>
<br/>
Being a doormat is a whole &#39;nother thing.  It happens, but not to parents who <br/>
are really involved and concerned.  It happens with women who are beat down <br/>
and told for years that their ideas aren&#39;t worth much because they&#39;re just <br/>
housewives, or whatever, and they learn not to express themselves, and <br/>
eventually just stop thinking as much as they can.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think they justify the meanness because they fear their kids will turn out<br/>
bad. I don&#39;t think they fear they will become doormats if they give up<br/>
punishments. I think they fear their kids will run wild and taking away<br/>
punishments is tying their hands and preventing them from using the only<br/>
tool parents have available.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just, as you say, they don&#39;t have another model. They don&#39;t realize<br/>
there other tools available. Or they don&#39;t trust the other tools because the<br/>
tools, like unschooling, don&#39;t work in an atmosphere of control.<br/>
<br/>
So I think what Robin was speaking to was that conclusion most people jump<br/>
to when they hear about no punishments.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I think that you&#39;re seeing two choices: either you make her do the right<br/>
thing or you let her do what she wants. And since what she wants may be the<br/>
wrong thing, then what.<br/>
<br/>
Try being her partner instead. Maybe, in this regard, think of her as a<br/>
friend to help you see the difference between molding her and helping her.<br/>
<br/>
Presumably she doesn&#39;t want cavities. But she doesn&#39;t want to brush either.<br/>
So what is it that&#39;s getting in her way of brushing? Does she object because<br/>
it&#39;s another one of those things that&#39;s always been forced? I know as a<br/>
child I remember brushing teeth taking a good half hour all by myself while<br/>
there were way more interesting things I could have been doing. Obviously it<br/>
only took 60 seconds of course ;-) but it seemed like half an hour! So I&#39;ve<br/>
always brushed my teeth with my daughter. She&#39;s old enough now to that it&#39;s<br/>
pretty much an automatic thing so she doesn&#39;t have to devote much<br/>
consciousness to it, but doing it together got her past the years when she<br/>
was hyperconscious of the tediousness of it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, what about when she does slam that playstation out of<br/>
&gt; frustration.  Just sit and wait - if she breaks it, she pays for it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, presumably, she doesn&#39;t want to break the Playstation so, say that to<br/>
her. Say &quot;I&#39;m concerned that taking out your frustration on the Playstation<br/>
may break it one day. Is there something we can think of that you might bang<br/>
or throw or do to release the frustration? Something we can keep right next<br/>
to the Playstation?&quot; (And talk again to see how it working and whether<br/>
something might work better.) And then when she does bang the Playstation,<br/>
humor helps as someone said. Saying &quot;The Playstation says Ouch!&quot; and then<br/>
hand her something else to punch. Talk to her when she&#39;s not in the midst of<br/>
playing about what her feelings are before she gets to the<br/>
need-to-slam-the-Playstation feeling so she can become more aware of the<br/>
buildup and redirect it before it gets to that point.<br/>
<br/>
Assume she will unthinkingly slam the Playstation until she&#39;s able to insert<br/>
a moment of thought in there. It&#39;s a retraining as well as developmentaly<br/>
issue. And you&#39;ll have to accept that she&#39;s going to do it wrong until you<br/>
and she can figure out a way that works.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There need to be basic,<br/>
&gt; considerate rules, for instance she can&#39;t throw things at the big<br/>
&gt; screen tv, and can&#39;t color on the walls...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, what&#39;s leading up to it? Help her become more conscious of what she&#39;s<br/>
feeling and find new releases.<br/>
<br/>
Why is she drawing on the walls? What about a big sheet of paper? What about<br/>
a wall she *can* color on?<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t rules in our house. We&#39;re just guided by what makes sense. If<br/>
your daughter is feeling controlled by the rules, it&#39;s possible she&#39;ll<br/>
choose unsensible things because she&#39;s fighting the inability to make the<br/>
choice for herself and not because she wants to do something ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
There are some communities that have rules about what colors you can paint<br/>
your house and whether you can have plastic pink flamingoes in your yard.<br/>
Being rather conservative, our house has conservative colors and no pink<br/>
flamingos. But if for some reason it turned into one of those controlled<br/>
communities, I&#39;d have great desire for purple woodwork and plastic pink<br/>
flamingos ;-)<br/>

I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m not going to fit in,  OK, so I guess I&#39;m not thinking it, I&#39;m knowing it!<br/>

&lt;&lt; There are some communities that have rules about what colors you can paint<br/>
your house and whether you can have plastic pink flamingoes in your yard.<br/>
Being rather conservative, our house has conservative colors and no pink<br/>
flamingos. But if for some reason it turned into one of those controlled<br/>
communities, I&#39;d have great desire for purple woodwork and plastic pink<br/>
flamingos ;-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Burke Breathed lived in Albuquerque for a while while his wife/partner was in <br/>
nursing school.  He had pink flamingos in his yard, but the covenants for his <br/>
neighborhood said &quot;no,&quot; and so he had them coated with brown stucco.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what happened next.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably they were swiped by fans.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; the book itself is a gold mine of information on how to go from <br/>
&gt; punitive parenting into a child-respecting mode, without just <br/>
&gt; becoming a doormat for your kids to walk on &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wonder if the cover of the book disturbed you more than the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>statement above <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; might disturb many of the parents on this list who are neither <br/>
 </span></blockquote>punitive nor <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; doormats.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure where this came from. My whole point was that not being <br/>
punitive *does not* equal being a doormat. That there is a way to <br/>
parent non-punitively without becoming a doormat. I can&#39;t imagine why <br/>
that would be disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The fear that ceasing punishments is the same as becoming a doormat <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is what <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; causes lots of people to justify being mean and vindictive <br/>
 </span></blockquote>parents.  Because <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they don&#39;t have another model of a healthy family (or that they <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have NO <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; models of happy families with cooperative kids who aren&#39;t being <br/>
 </span></blockquote>grounded or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; spanked).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly. Which is why I was recommending this excellent, child-<br/>
respecting book that has many models of healthy ways to interact with <br/>
children in cooperative ways.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Being a doormat is a whole &#39;nother thing.  It happens, but not to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>parents who <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are really involved and concerned.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, but it&#39;s possible to be involved and concerned but just not <br/>
know *how* a non-punitive, positive-parenting family looks. To not <br/>
know the non-punitive tools that you might need to work with. I was <br/>
just suggesting one good source of information on what a non-punitive <br/>
way to parent might look like. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  It happens with women who are beat down <br/>
&gt; and told for years that their ideas aren&#39;t worth much because <br/>
 </span></blockquote>they&#39;re just <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; housewives, or whatever, and they learn not to express themselves, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; eventually just stop thinking as much as they can.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this is apropos of what? No-one on this list is doing so. The <br/>
book I recommended isn&#39;t doing so. The person posting on this list <br/>
asked for help on becoming non-punitive. This book is one good source <br/>
of information on that subject, which I feel is very child-respecting <br/>
and parent-respecting as well.<br/>
