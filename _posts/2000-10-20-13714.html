<div id="ygrps-yiv-203924010">One of my heroes is Eric Hoffer (1902-1983).  His penchant for simple<br/>
living; his indifference toward acquiring material things; his lifelong<br/>
dedication to learning; his blue collar employment; and his non-mainstream<br/>
philosophies--all have had a significant impact on my worldview.<br/>
<br/>
Hoffer&#39;s widely-acclaimed book, &quot;The True Believer&quot; appeared in 1951.<br/>
Essentially, it is a critique of mass movements.  His message is timeless.<br/>
Here are a few favorite quotes from that book:<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
&quot;People in a hurry will imitate more readily than people at leisure.<br/>
Hustling thus tends to produce uniformity.&quot;<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
&quot;Men of thought seldom work well together, whereas between men of action<br/>
there is usually an easy camaraderie.  Teamwork is rare in intellectual or<br/>
artistic undertakings, but common and almost indispensable among men of<br/>
action.&quot;<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
 &quot;The creative man of words is ill at ease in the atmosphere of an active<br/>
movement.  He feels that its whirl and passion sap his creative energies.<br/>
So long as he is conscious of the creative flow within him, he will not find<br/>
fulfillment in leading millions and in winning victories.  The result is<br/>
that, once the movement starts rolling, he either retires voluntarily or is<br/>
pushed aside.  Moreover, since the genuine man of words can never<br/>
wholeheartedly and for long suppress his critical faculty, he is inevitably<br/>
cast in the role of the heretic.&quot;<br/>
