&gt;Thank you, Sharon. That was a very nice thing to say! BTW, I wanted to <br/>
&gt;thank you off-list but I don&#39;t know how - I&#39;ve heard people talking about <br/>
&gt;&quot;taking it off-list&quot; - do they have to exchange private email addresses to <br/>
&gt;do this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
&gt;Diana Tashjian<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251982984">Dear Tami<br/>
<br/>
I remember son #2 asking me to not cheer for him at a<br/>
ball game becuase people might look at me. I wasn&#39;t<br/>
cool. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how flattered I am.  A younge person<br/>
calling me &quot;cool&quot;!!  I think I&#39;ll do a little dance.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks   Sharon<br/>
<br/>
ps I know I won&#39;t be able to always &quot;keep my cool&quot;<br/>
though! Ha! <br/>

Of course you can keep your cool !!! Nobody can take it away, its in the way <br/>
that you deal with people and people can sense it. They are drawn to it. <br/>
BYW its very hard to be cool for your own kids. I bet all of his friends <br/>
thought you were cool!!<br/>
<br/>
LOL!! Go figure<br/>
