<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everything produced in the European Union these days is supposed to be<br/>
labelled in the languages of all the EU countries.  This is a huge blessing<br/>
for me, because England is EU so I can now actually read the labels on<br/>
stuff!  (It started in January, after I&#39;d been here over a year struggling<br/>
along in German.)<br/>
<br/>
Some labelling people go crazy and include all European languages, which<br/>
gets pretty interesting, especially on something like a chocolate bar<br/>
wrapper!<br/>

p.s. the topic label on this thread is kinda &quot;duh&quot; on an unschooling list,<br/>
dontcha think?  :)</div>
