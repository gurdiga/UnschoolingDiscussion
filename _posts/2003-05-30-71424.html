<div id="ygrps-yiv-932586478">My eight year old girl and I are, and I&#39;m thinking quite <br/>
schoolishly &quot;ah, she&#39;ll be adding and figuring and doing numbers <br/>
here. Veddy good&quot; thinking, you know, adding things to make 15 and <br/>
having to put points on the board, etc. Didn&#39;t say these things, mind <br/>
you. Thought em though!<br/>
<br/>
And she says &quot;Two plus five is six...seven, right?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot; I said. She fumbled around in the carrot bag (oh. We were <br/>
munching baby peeled carrots while we played cribbage)<br/>
<br/>
She said &quot;I have enough carrots here for everyone in the family to <br/>
have two more&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
and I said &quot;you do?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
and she said &quot;Yeah, you know how I figured it out?&quot; and went into <br/>
this WAAAAY complex, convoluted explanation of how she figured that <br/>
one more than five was six, but four more than six was 10, and since <br/>
we had three people in the room, and seven doesn&#39;t divide by three... <br/>
ehem...<br/>
<br/>
well, however she got there, by the time she got done explaining it <br/>
to me, she had laid out ten carrots in groups of two. and that if she <br/>
put them in groups of five, she&#39;d have two piles of five. And I <br/>
said &quot;Yup. Two times five is ten. Five times two is ten.&quot; and she <br/>
said &quot;I KNOW, mom. That&#39;s what I just explained to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOL<br/>
