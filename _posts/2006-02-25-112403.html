<div id="ygrps-yiv-746052913">Here is another question on my mind.<br/>
<br/>
If my child wants something that my husband and I truly feel that we<br/>
cannot afford (after much thinking and talking about it together)--<br/>
such as an expensive class and time commitment to drive her to a<br/>
certain class two times a week plus waiting time of several hours --<br/>
is it against the principles of unschooling to make this decision<br/>
without her and for her? <br/>
<br/>
I mean, we have already made the decision that it will not work for us<br/>
financially or timewise. We would certainly try to explain and show<br/>
her our thinking process, our financial situation, our priorities as<br/>
to what fits into our schedule and what doesn&#39;t. We sympathize with<br/>
her wish and we have always made all efforts to fulfill her wishes.<br/>
She has attended a wide variety of classes over the years. We usually<br/>
give her the choice of what we can handle (financilly and timewise) so<br/>
that she can prioritize her interests in different classes and choose<br/>
the ones she prefers. This time though we feel that this particular<br/>
class is beyond our means and abilities to manage other time commitments. <br/>
<br/>
I am looking for advice on how to handle the fact that we cannot<br/>
afford it at the moment, not advice on how to figure out a way to<br/>
afford it or how to manage our time better, if this makes sense. <br/>
<br/>
I am pretty good with brainstorming and looking at many different<br/>
options. I take my time and ask for advice. I visualize different<br/>
possibilites and sit with them. I talk with my husband and kids,<br/>
friends, and I look for new ideas constantly. I am not afraid to<br/>
change my desisions if things are not working well. <br/>
<br/>
This time I am, right or wrong, sure that we cannot afford this class<br/>
without negative results to our finances and enjoyment of life due to<br/>
  a time crunch. Is it against unschooling principles to look at my<br/>
life, decide that I cannot afford this class, and make this decision<br/>
for myself and therefore for my daughter? <br/>
<br/>
If out of fear to upset her or disappoint her, I disregard my best (at<br/>
the moment) judgment and go ahead with the class, I would most likely<br/>
end up feeling resentful of the financial situation this would put us<br/>
in and the stress it would put on us due to the time crunch it would<br/>
result in. I wish it would not be so. The reality is that I would most<br/>
likely feel resentment. I am not the most &quot;together&quot; adult. I am<br/>
learning to handle difficult emotions better and to see my children&#39;s<br/>
feelings and wishes just as important as mine. I am learning to see<br/>
them as individuals worthy of respect. But it does not come to me<br/>
naturally. I know that in this situation I would feel resentment and<br/>
have a hard time hiding it. she would feel guilty for creating this<br/>
situation no matter how hard I would try to reassure her that it&#39;s not<br/>
her fault, that I am just working on some difficult emotions and that<br/>
 it is my job, not hers, to deal with my feelings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am learning a lot here. Thank you for letting me ask questions here.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe if you post the specifics of the class there is another option you<br/>
haven&#39;t considered.  Could she go the class and offer to be of assistance to<br/>
the teacher in order to learn about the subject?  Could she go to one class<br/>
and see if someone lives nearby that could offer her a ride?  Sometimes it<br/>
can be difficult to reach out and ask for help or to ask for something<br/>
different than the norm, but I&#39;ve found it is worth it.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple years ago I was pretty certain we could not afford a horse.  Plus I<br/>
also felt I didn&#39;t know enough about them to care for them properly.  I went<br/>
outside my comfort zone and asked the girls riding instructor if she&#39;d<br/>
barter board for my help around the place and she willingly agreed.  Not<br/>
only did it make it much ore affordable but I learned more about horses than<br/>
I ever could have without the direct experience helping out at the farm.  <br/>
<br/>
Nine months after getting the first horse we realized how much joy horses<br/>
brought to our lives and we found a way to add a second horse to our family<br/>
by selling items we no longer used much and by keeping our older vehicles<br/>
when they were paid off.<br/>
<br/>
I would urge you to brain storm even more ideas and find a way to make it<br/>
work for your daughter if at all possible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t an unschooling answer to this since it isn&#39;t about not  <br/>
schooling but there are respectful and less respectful ways of  <br/>
handling it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming this is a class your daughter already is interested  in?<br/>
<br/>
What if there were a class you were interested in and your husband  <br/>
thought it through on his own and came back with the decision you  <br/>
couldn&#39;t take it?<br/>
<br/>
Your approach of making a decision and then figuring out how to tell  <br/>
your daughter is turning your daughter into the problem. You could go  <br/>
through the money issue with her. Perhaps she might come up with a  <br/>
creative solution. You could talk about the time commitment. You  <br/>
could research other options for classes with her.<br/>
<br/>
Approach it more as &quot;Here&#39;s the problems that I have with it that I  <br/>
can&#39;t find a way around,&quot; rather than &quot;Here&#39;s why it won&#39;t work and I  <br/>
need to convince you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The more she trusts that you&#39;re on her side trying to help her get  <br/>
what she wants, the easier it will be for her to accept when there  <br/>
are times when she won&#39;t be able to have everything. If she trusts  <br/>
you, you might not need to go through the money issue as you might  <br/>
not need your husband to spell it all out for you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does this extend to parenting? Should I get my daughter&#39;s permission<br/>
&gt; before I write about her on message boards?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t hurt to ask her! Are you afraid she might tell you no? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If I were a kid and my mom told me she was trying to be a better mom  <br/>
and wanted to ask some advice on better ways to handle something I&#39;d  <br/>
want to help her out by saying yes :-)<br/>
<br/>
But if I knew my mothere was trying to rally the troops to support  <br/>
her position against me, I wouldn&#39;t much like it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When you&#39;re looking at two similar things and trying to figure out  <br/>
the logic, sometimes it helps to make two extreme examples instead.   <br/>
If she wanted to go to the convenience store that&#39;s walking distance  <br/>
from you, or if she wanted to go to Africa.  NOW ask yourself whether  <br/>
it fits your unschooling principles to say no.<br/>
<br/>
People can&#39;t say yes to everything.  Some families seem to find  <br/>
virtue in saying NO, even at times when Yes would&#39;ve been five ways  <br/>
better.<br/>

<br/>
It makes sense in English, but it&#39;s not a reasonable thing to ask on  <br/>
this list, because though you might really get some good advice on  <br/>
how to handle your assertion and decision that you can&#39;t afford it  <br/>
(&quot;facts&quot; don&#39;t come from declarations), the discussions here are not  <br/>
supposed to be for the benefit or in the direction of single  <br/>
individuals, but out on the table for the benefit of anyone who reads  <br/>
it, now or in a  year or two.<br/>
<br/>
A family moving toward a more generous and respectful relationship  <br/>
with children sometimes goes too far.  If a family once decided  <br/>
simply by what was convenient for the parents, they might feel guilty  <br/>
and give the kids their way ALL the time, kind of in penance.<br/>
If each decision is made with regard to everyone involved, though,  <br/>
and the kids know that&#39;s they way decisions are being made, they&#39;ll  <br/>
understand.  If they can&#39;t tell yet how you&#39;re deciding and it seems  <br/>
arbitrary they will likely ask for more, just to get less.  That &quot;ask  <br/>
for twice as much as you really want&quot; negotiating tool doesn&#39;t happen  <br/>
at our house, but I&#39;ve seen it in effect in many others.<br/>

I think the list will probably offer up both kinds of suggestions.  I <br/>
believe it is worthwhile to consider the whole range of approaches.  <br/>
Some might not comfortably fit your style or circumstances.  Some may be <br/>
worth stretching for.  But even the ideas that are just wrong for you <br/>
are likely to be *right for someone else* dealing with a similar <br/>
situation.  So it&#39;s worth looking at a whole range of ways to tackle a <br/>
problem, as the challenge you are dealing with does occur for many <br/>
unschooling families. <br/>
<br/>
I was talking to a friend who takes her older child to a long gymnastics <br/>
lesson that&#39;s more than a thirty minute drive from her house.  My <br/>
impression is that this wasn&#39;t much fun for her when the younger child <br/>
had to come as well.  But once they were able to set their lives up with <br/>
dad working at home and the younger child able to be at home, it was fun <br/>
for the mom to go to a cafe with her laptop during the lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, not everyone has totally flexibility with work and childcare <br/>
arrangements and probably most of us don&#39;t have laptops.  (I don&#39;t.)  <br/>
But looking for ways to enjoy being where we are is always beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
Probably there were many other ways to make the class time fun for the <br/>
rest of the family, especially if the older child didn&#39;t need a parent <br/>
to stay.  But I&#39;m offering this as just one example of juggling things <br/>
around to make the hanging around time more enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
I also think carpooling is a great approach for classes that would be <br/>
tiresome for a parent to wait through.<br/>
