 </span></blockquote>&quot;Truancy&quot; applies only to children who are enrolled in a school and are<br/>
&quot;absent&quot; from that school for a certain number of days.<br/>
<br/>
In CT, our organizations have written to the members that &quot;truancy&quot; does not<br/>
apply to homeschoolers, because there are no absences from a homeschool, by<br/>
definition. Kimber&#39;s intuition is correct, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
The state does not own anyone&#39;s children. It has no right to act as though<br/>
it owns them. Therefore it cannot control children who are not under its<br/>
&quot;care&quot; by contract with the parents.<br/>
<br/>
The state (the education establishment -- unions)  will continue to harass<br/>
and intimidate homeschoolers until a family challenges these vague and<br/>
dishonest regulations. When they are challenged and their true intent of<br/>
control is revealed, they will be removed, and homeschooling will be better<br/>
for everyone. All testing should be under the control of the people in<br/>
charge of the child, no one else.<br/>
<br/>
What gives a &quot;state&quot; the right to test children who have opted out of its<br/>
schools, especially since their reason for homeschooling was that the<br/>
schools are inadequate and the tests are meaningless and dishonest?<br/>
<br/>
The tests have nothing to do with education. They are used as a mechanism to<br/>
control people and money.<br/>
