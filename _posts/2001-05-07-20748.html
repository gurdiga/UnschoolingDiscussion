&gt; You used the<br/>
&gt; phrase &quot;people may be wise in one area but not<br/>
&gt; another&quot; so I&#39;m curious what your perception is of<br/>
&gt; those that do spank their kids.  I find it interesting<br/>
&gt; when people start putting down another group because<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t agree with their stand on an issue, instead<br/>
&gt; of just letting them have a different view.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When a person strongly believes that spanking harms children, she can&#39;t just<br/>
accept it as &quot;a different view&quot;. It&#39;s not me saying peas are better than<br/>
carrots and you disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, when a person strongly believes that the Bible is mandating that<br/>
she use a rod, strike, hit, spank or whatever her children, she can&#39;t just<br/>
accept me saying I don&#39;t spank my children. If she thinks the Bible leaves<br/>
the choice, she can accept my statement, but if she is of the opinion that<br/>
it&#39;s ordained, she holds the opinion that I harm my children by NOT<br/>
spanking.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are the shades of gray -- &quot;spanking is okay if it&#39;s a danger<br/>
thing&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, in a spanking debate (as in an abortion debate, a religion<br/>
debate, etc.) few minds will be changed, but it&#39;s those few minds that are<br/>
important to anyone who has strongly held beliefs, on either side of the<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s wrong to spank children. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever right, for any<br/>
reason. I think there is always a better way. So, IMHO, the woman who wrote<br/>
about wisdom in one area or another is right.<br/>
<br/>
Care should be taken with the language, though. You write &quot;unwise parents&quot;<br/>
as though that is what the original poster said. Just as a child who does<br/>
one stupid thing is not a stupid child, a parent who does one unwise thing<br/>
is not an unwise parent. It takes an accumulation, I suppose.<br/>
