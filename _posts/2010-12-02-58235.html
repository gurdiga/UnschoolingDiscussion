<div id="ygrps-yiv-555508941">I&#39;ve recently let go of control of my kids meals. For years I followed the<br/>
advice, &quot;If they don&#39;t eat what you give them make them wait for the next meal.<br/>

they wanted of what I gave them and went many meals without food. It didn&#39;t make<br/>
them balanced eaters. Now I&#39;ve gone completely the other way and allowed my two<br/>
girls, 6 & 4, free choice starting with their input at the store. They loved it<br/>
at first , but now my 6 yr. old has taken to wanting just flour, or just<br/>
ketchup. This is REALLY hard for me because I started milking dairy goats 2<br/>
years ago, raise and process our own chickens, make my own sourdough bread,<br/>
yogurt, cheese, bone broth soups, etc. because I see the value in knowing where<br/>
my food came from and how it;s processed. Now my kids are pretty much boycotting<br/>
all of my food, most fruits and all veges and most proteins! Has anyone had this<br/>
situation? Will they really start making good choices?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944387748">What you yourself eat and value will have the most impact of their adult lives and diets.  Keep making your bread and raising your chickens and enjoy it.  In the meantime support their choices too and let them find value their own way.<br/>
<br/>
My parents were very keen on food, my father especially keen on Indian food but I hated it as a child- the textures and sauces rather than the heat.  There was one particular dish (Marsala Fried Potatoes) that my father made every week as a special treat for them to eat in front of their favourite TV show, and every week he made me scrambled eggs and chips instead, bless him.  Now, as a adult, Marsala Fried Potatoes is my favourite dish (it has to be made by my dad, or it just isn&#39;t the same), and I always choose it for special meals when I get the chance.  I don&#39;t think that would be true if I had been forced to eat it every week as a child.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to avoid turning into your parents! Let them enjoy their own explorations before starting work on their sourdough starters and allotments.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe they&#39;ll go a completely different route- but if that&#39;s the case then far better for you to support them than alienate them.<br/>

balanced for them.<br/>
<br/>
Balance doesn&#39;t happen at every meal for most kids. One of the things  <br/>
I learned at La Leche League was that children will get the nutrients  <br/>
they need over, say, a week.<br/>

of the problem. Saying yes to requests and gradually making changes to  <br/>
how you do things is less confusing for children.<br/>

<br/>
Most importantly, it&#39;s how you change your attitude that will make the  <br/>
difference. *You* think about these things first, without making  <br/>
wholesale changes to your lives. &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a  <br/>
while, watch&quot; is excellent advice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe she&#39;s exploring texture and taste. If she hasn&#39;t been allowed to  <br/>
before, this might be a necessary step. And she might be afraid that  <br/>
you&#39;ve gone crazy, so she&#39;d better do this now while she can, before  <br/>
you put the controls back on.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried monkey platters? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter</a><br/>

You can put flour and ketchup on it, too &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293160805">&quot;Why (and how!?) would a child eat flour?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rowan, 4.5yo, will eat flour and water any chance she gets, which is usually <br/>
when we are baking, making pizza dough, or she is playing with these ingredients <br/>
while I cook. I don&#39;t think it is because she is actually hungry for it, though; <br/>
it seems that more often than not she is pretending that it is something else. <br/>
Nevertheless, my child eats the flour.<br/>

some. So, thank you who have. I&#39;m just trying my best and my child happens to be extreme. She always has been. When she was three she decided to wear nothing but princess dresses with hats and feathers in the hat. Night and day and we let her. Then exactly one year later she declared she didn&#39;t want to wear dresses, but at that time I had no jeans!! Anyway, she hated homeschooling and as I mentioned she made no bones about telling anyone how much she hated it. So I looked into unschooling and believed that was the best way for her. Since I read more and decided to give up more control I saw a spring effect. And maybe I didn&#39;t need to post this because I know who she is and that she is and always had been extreme. But I just thought I&#39;d get encouragement not criticism.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll make a success of life because I believe this will give her the confidence and security she needs. Plus we are trying our hardest to being loving, supportive parents. I enjoy hearing other peoples experiences and had hoped I would find someone who went through the same thing and I guess unrealistically hoped someone would say this will all straighten out soon. Anyway, I&#39;ll do my best. Thanks. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-351657543">Thank you for your response and I apologize for being too easily offended. I read your links and appreciate them. <br/>
When I said my child is extreme it&#39;s because she has huge emotions and responses to things. I never met any other child who would only wear frilly, Disney, itchy dresses even to bed for a solid year, then one day very suddenly swings in the opposite direction to wanting only jeans and t-shirts. Her emotions are very much that way too. Very angry to very lovey in an instant. Sometimes I&#39;m exhausted! Hope no one is offended by these comments. I&#39;m a little uncertain about my words.<br/>
Last night as I was writing my response Liv, my daughter, asked what I was doing. I said *Remember when we decided not to do phonics and math u see anymore? And how you could eat more of the things you like?* She smiled big and jumped in my lap to show her glee! *Well, I&#39;m writing to people who also have done that and have had experiences that might help me* So, that was enough to allow me to finish. Then when I was tucking her into bed she said *About that eating thing... I think I would like to eat your chicken soup at the end of each day*!<br/>
Earlier in the day she came up to me and said, *I know that when I ask you for maple syrup you are going to have a hard feeling and that makes me sad*  I simply said * I&#39;m sorry that makes you sad. Thank you for telling me how you feel* And she leaped into my arms and gave me a bear hug.<br/>

<br/>
My daughter wore either a dog or cat costume for well over a year, even to bed.  After the suits became too small, even with the addition of gussets, and she wasn&#39;t pleased with the newer, larger sized ones we found, she graduated to wearing a tail that hung on a piece of elastic around her waist.<br/>
<br/>

Another way to expand on ketchup: you could experiment with making other kinds of purees (think homemade baby food--or buy some baby food at the store).  I imagine you could make a beautiful layout of colorful ketchup-textured foods.<br/>

I think it is more that dough, with raw eggs, can be dangerous.  If you&#39;re using fresh eggs, from your own chickens, probably not as much to worry about.<br/>

We used to make edible peanut butter playdough (no eggs)...that was fun! Here are a few recipes:<br/>

<br/>
Tasting flour doesn&#39;t strike me as &quot;eating flour.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Eat&quot; sounds to me like making a meal of it, and wanting some more another time.<br/>
<br/>
If flour is the best choice a child can think of, I figured there must need to be some more alluring foods available that smell good and look good.  I worried whether maybe the mom had left a child to her own devices, in response to the child not liking the mom&#39;s health food (or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
I *always* wanted some of the cutaway parts of biscuits, at my granny&#39;s house--while she cut the circles with a metal can, they left bits between.  She couldn&#39;t understand why I liked that, but I did.  And still, sometimes, if I&#39;m using canned biscuits or rolls, I taste a bit and think of my granny.  But I didn&#39;t &quot;eat raw biscuits.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When my mom cut up potatoes, I always asked for a taste or two of it raw.  But I didn&#39;t &quot;eat raw potatoes.&quot;<br/>

Almonds ground in a food processor might make a fun dip for something like carrot sticks.  <br/>

Ketchup mixed with other things could be fun.  <br/>
Ketchup and brown sugar is halfway to barbecue sauce.<br/>

<br/>
Please think about self control and self regulation, as concepts.   Making choices might be a better way to go, with anger.  People get angry, but then  they don&#39;t need to think about &quot;controlling&quot; it so much as deciding what to do when anger comes--other ways to think about it, and personal tools, tricks or plans of action (depending on the situation).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076197746">&quot;I&#39;m sorry you are making fun of me because my child is eating a cup of flour <br/>
with a spoon. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think Sandra was asking for clarification. Wanting to eat flour could mean <br/>
that she only wants foods made with flour, but it could also mean as you <br/>
clarified that she actually eats flour.  That probably seems confusing to some.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m just trying my best and my child happens to be extreme. She always  has <br/>
been. When she was three she decided to wear nothing but princess  dresses with <br/>
hats and feathers in the hat. Night and day and we let her.  Then exactly one <br/>
year later she declared she didn&#39;t want to wear  dresses, but at that time I had <br/>
no jeans!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My Rowan, 4.5yo, is a lot like this as well, but I used to be/can be also, so I <br/>
work very hard to have compassion for how challenging it is to be her at times <br/>
(to want/need to wear a particular piece of clothing *so* badly that if not <br/>
found *immediately* it sends her into an angry, disappointed rage of sorts) as <br/>
well as understand her and how to be with, live with, work with her, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As far as food is concerned, I am not going to answer your query directly <br/>
because Rowan does not eat what most people would consider to be a &quot;balanced&quot; <br/>
diet.  She LOVES sugar, and will ask specifically for something &quot;sugary&quot; or <br/>
&quot;sweet&quot; throughout the day.  But &quot;sweet&quot; has a range, so we keep lots of fruit <br/>
available, organic yogurt, high quality dark chocolate, etc. We also <br/>
consistently offer/put out other faves like pastas, pizza, hot dogs, hummus and <br/>
crackers, cheese and crackers, etc. (all which taste a little sweet). Some times <br/>
she eats nothing but the &quot;sweet&quot; foods, some times a little sweet and a little <br/>
of the other foods, and some times a lot of a range. I used to be concerned, and <br/>
some days I feel like she is not consuming enough protein or &quot;colors&quot;, but then <br/>
she usually makes up for it another day by eating 3 chicken hot dogs, a plate of <br/>
cheese, and a turkey sandwich.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I struggled with food and my body image growing up, so before her birth, I <br/>
made a promise to myself and to Rowan that I would not make food a big deal (not <br/>
push for her to eat what she doesn&#39;t want to or doesn&#39;t like; not push for meals <br/>
to be at a specific time of day; not push for eating all that you are <br/>
given/take, etc.). I believe that this has given room for food to be whatever it <br/>
is for Rowan rather than what I or her dad think it should be for her (note: dad <br/>
is still really struggling with this, esp. because he works in restaurants with <br/>
food and hospitality and loves it). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, I would say, trust your daughter that she will eat more than flour at some <br/>
point, and likely soon. In the mean time, you could offer her foods that are <br/>
simple and simple to eat (flour is rather tasteless without other ingredients, <br/>
so maybe she&#39;s seeking simplicity). Maybe you could ask if she&#39;d like pasta <br/>
since it is basically flour and water. You could make a game of it with her- how <br/>
many foods contain flour, from most basic to more complex. When I turn things <br/>
positive and fun rather than getting caught up in how difficult I think my <br/>
daughter is being, it is so much more interesting, fun, relaxed, and Rowan tends <br/>
to desire and be open to more connection then too (as long as she doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
like I am being condescending or making fun of her-- this is key for us).<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. And, more importantly, keep doing all the things that you love <br/>
where food is concerned. <br/>
<br/>

Ramen or egg noodles, maybe?<br/>

Holly often made ramen without using the flavor packet, but only put salt and butter on strained noodles.<br/>

Both of us like buttered, salted egg noodles.<br/>
Rice, too, with nothing but salt and butter is one of my favorite comfort foods.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe to put this in perspective -<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter, for more than a year, wore the same dress every day. It<br/>
was pink and white check with a poof skirt and crinolines. I think she was 4<br/>
or 5 years old. She wore cat ears with the dress, and insisted that everyone<br/>
call her Miss Kitty. Sometimes she wore a tail too.<br/>
<br/>
I bought two more of the dresses (they were from JC Penney&#39;s) so that we<br/>
weren&#39;t dependent on just that one. I have a picture of her dancing in the<br/>
backyard in the dress and ears. That outfit made her really happy.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s now almost 15 year old. I saved one of her dresses and love looking at<br/>
it when I&#39;m getting things out of our old-clothes-and-costumes closet.<br/>
<br/>
My second daughter (now 12 years old) did the same thing with a Minnie Mouse<br/>
dress. I found a couple more of the dresses on ebay so that she could wear<br/>
them all the time. She had a stuffed puppy dog that she carried with her,<br/>
usually in a small basket - it was part of the outfit. I saved one of her<br/>
Minnie Mouse dresses, and it&#39;s also in the closet.<br/>
<br/>
Those are some of my favorite memories.<br/>

Minnie Mouse dresses, and it&#39;s also in the closet.<br/>
<br/>
Those are some of my favorite memories.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara B<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290055401">I wore a dress from the 1950s that belonged to my mom when she was a girl<br/>
the summer I turned 10... all summer long. I wore the thing night and day.<br/>
It really isn&#39;t unusual. A friend who has moved to New York state now has a<br/>
daughter who was 8 when she lived here in SC. That child never wore anything<br/>
but playclothes, different ones changed out all the time. Karl wears<br/>
playclothes to bed sometimes and has times when he wears them during the day<br/>
for a while. It&#39;s really cute when he&#39;s asleep and I untie his cape<br/>
(blanket) from his neck to keep him breathing freely.<br/>

&gt; I think it is not at all unusual for kids to want to do this kind of<br/>
&gt; thing. Most kids can&#39;t actually do it because their parents won&#39;t let<br/>
&gt; them. All three of my girls went through time periods of wearing certain<br/>
&gt; costumes nonstop - nearly 24 hours per day, week after week.  I also<br/>
&gt; have a sister who is 7 years younger than I am and I remember that<br/>
&gt; before she was school-age she had certain clothes she wanted to wear all<br/>
&gt; the time AND she didn&#39;t want them washed. HER daughter (my niece) didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; wear clothing at all, in the house, for a few years. She&#39;d shed her<br/>
&gt; clothing at the front door when she came inside and put it on when she<br/>
&gt; went outside.<br/>

&gt; Ketchup mixed with other things could be fun.  <br/>
&gt; Ketchup and brown sugar is halfway to barbecue sauce.<br/>
&gt; Ketchup and mayonnaise would be a good dip or sandwich spread.<br/>
&gt; Ketchup and ground almonds might be good with a corn dog.  (Costco&#39;s corn dogs are organic chicken.)<br/>
