The  tooth was still there, but was all rotted and black and  icky.<br/>

Did you try to clean it off?  Was the &quot;black and icky&quot; just  coke-sludge?<br/>
<br/>

Marty got some teeth pulled last week.  Maybe he&#39;d be willing to  donate one. <br/>
 Teeth (removed, outside of people or animals) kinda gross me  out, <br/>
personally.   Hair and fingernails too.  Any  people-parts.   My granny had a book of <br/>
hair of relatives and  ancestors.  It was like graveyard-in-a-drawer for me <br/>
when I was  little.  I don&#39;t know who ended up with it, but it was gross.  The  <br/>
thought that someday I could clone all my ancestors does NOT cheer me up at  <br/>
all.  That was my mom&#39;s family and should stay in the drawer for  sure.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think coke will dissolve hair, either.<br/>
