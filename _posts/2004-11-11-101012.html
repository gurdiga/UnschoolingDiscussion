 </span></blockquote>This made me laugh.  Being Unitarian, I wouldn&#39;t have worded the <br/>
question any differently.  We always use the words &quot;faith community&quot; <br/>
when asking or discussing religions, because it is so much more <br/>
universal.  I never thought about someone not relating to the term <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... just when you think you are being SO inclusive...<br/>
<br/>
And, for the record, most of the UU homeschoolers I&#39;ve met are <br/>
unschoolers as well (or at least VERY relaxed homeschoolers).  Maybe <br/>
it&#39;s all the Uns we relate to.  We could be Un Un Uns for short!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW Holly, I thought that was a great article, too.  You know, they <br/>
always have to counter EVERY homeschool article with some less than <br/>
enlightened school administrator - fortunately for the reporters, they <br/>
are very easy to find. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
