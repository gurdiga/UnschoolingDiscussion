<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206884200">For example, we don&#39;t watch the<br/>
Tolkien movies or The Sopranos when he&#39;s  awake. <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
But do they ASK to watch these movies? Would they want<br/>
to? I&#39;ve never <br/>
met a  <br/>
three year old who would spend more than a minute or<br/>
two in front of <br/>
The  <br/>
Sopranos<br/>
*******************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Yes!!  Actually my little son, who&#39;s not even 3 quite<br/>
yet, will suggest we watch the Sopranos, go grab the<br/>
DVD if we happen to have one and if he is not stopped,<br/>
will put it in and start it- he knows how to operate<br/>
the whole TV/stereo system himself!<br/>
<br/>
Last night he said that he &quot;loved The Rings&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps he sees how excited we are over these movies<br/>
and that&#39;s where he gets interested.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if we did let him watch it he may lose<br/>
interest after 2 or 3 minutes, but my hunch is that<br/>
he&#39;d probably watch the whole thing.  So, is it<br/>
appropriate/responsible for me to give him this<br/>
opportunity at the risk of him getting &quot;freaked out&quot;<br/>
by an Orc&#39;s head being cut off or Tony Soprano having<br/>
sex with some chic? This is were I am conflicted.  I<br/>
guess it would be better to give him the opportunity<br/>
and be glad if he turns away after a couple minutes,<br/>
but what if he likes it?  I don&#39;t know how comfortable<br/>
I feel about exposing my child to those images and I&#39;m<br/>
not sure how much I buy into, &quot;if I don&#39;t let him,<br/>
he&#39;ll only be drawn to it more&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t know if he can separate &quot;pretend&quot; from<br/>
reality yet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really torn here, and any insight would be<br/>
helpful.<br/>

doing/watching rather than actually interested in the subject matter.<br/>
With a toddler in the house I wouldn&#39;t watch the Sopranos or <br/>
anything like it unless he was sleeping.  I even try to put off <br/>
reading aloud to my older boys (9 and 11) anything that I think is <br/>
too violent or otherwise racy for my 5yo to overhear.<br/>
We save certain movies (The Patriot comes to mind) for the <br/>
occasional night when the youngest falls asleep earlier than usual.<br/>

is pretty much out of mind and that it&#39;s very easy to find something <br/>
else they&#39;d prefer to watch or do, so mabye just put the DVDs away.<br/>
I also think it would be a good idea to stop talking about it <br/>
excitedly in front of him.<br/>
An older child actually interested in the subject matter is an <br/>
entirely different story, but a 2yo?  I think there are other <br/>
solutions.<br/>

&gt; My kids have seen all three movies in this trilogy. <br/>
&gt; The first one we <br/>
&gt; watched at home (without the kids) but they kept<br/>
&gt; coming in and wanting <br/>
&gt; to watch it and then would wonder off then come<br/>
&gt; back.  When it was over <br/>
&gt; they asked to watch it from the beginning because<br/>
&gt; they didn&#39;t see it <br/>
&gt; all.  They were 4 and 2 at the time.  I sat with<br/>
&gt; them and we watched it <br/>
&gt; again.  They asked questions, but they didn&#39;t act<br/>
&gt; scared.  They have <br/>
&gt; since seen the other 2 at the theater with us.  <br/>
&gt; Besides the LOTR <br/>
&gt; trilogy they like the Harry Potter films, the Matrix<br/>
&gt; trilogy, Star Wars <br/>
&gt; saga, etc.   And they still enjoy Ferngully, Blues<br/>
&gt; Clues and Sesame <br/>
&gt; Street too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; [Perhaps he sees how excited we are over these<br/>
&gt; movies and that&#39;s where <br/>
&gt; &gt; he gets interested.]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or maybe he thinks they look like great, adventurous<br/>
&gt; movies and he&#39;d <br/>
&gt; like to check them out too.<br/>

&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; he&#39;d probably watch the whole thing.]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s only one way to find out.  LOL  Pop on a<br/>
&gt; LOTR movie for <br/>
&gt; yourself and see if he joins you.  If he has<br/>
&gt; questions or seems like <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s disturbing him you&#39;ll already be right there<br/>
&gt; for him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; [Also, I don&#39;t know if he can separate &quot;pretend&quot;<br/>
&gt; from reality yet.]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Show him the &quot;extras&quot; on the DVDs where they show<br/>
&gt; how they do make-up <br/>
&gt; and special effects.  My 3yo DD understands that<br/>
&gt; movies are &quot;movies&quot; <br/>
&gt; and that the actors didn&#39;t *really* cut off a real<br/>
&gt; person&#39;s head.  When <br/>
&gt; we watch movies they like me to point out actors<br/>
&gt; from other films that <br/>
&gt; they&#39;d recognize -- even if it&#39;s voice talent. <br/>
&gt; Like, &quot;Hey, kids!  See <br/>
&gt; that guy right there with the dark, curly hair?  His<br/>
&gt; name is Tom Hanks <br/>
&gt; and he does the voice for Woody on &#39;Toy Story&#39;!&quot; <br/>
&gt; They love to make the <br/>
&gt; connections and see that these actors get paid to<br/>
&gt; pretend and tell us a <br/>
&gt; story.  Maybe your son would enjoy that too?  Just<br/>
&gt; throwing stuff out <br/>
&gt; there.  :)<br/>

they wouldn&#39;t even know about it at 3 years old. That sounds like you <br/>
made a big deal out of it and he thinks it is going to be good for him, <br/>
too. WHY on earth would a 3 yo watch it after the first couple of <br/>
minutes? That doesn&#39;t even make sense - there is nothing in it that <br/>
would be of interest to a 3 year old.<br/>
<br/>
LOR is pretty gory and scary - but if a kid wanted to watch it I&#39;d put <br/>
it on and sit close and be sensitive to turning it off if they were too <br/>
scared.<br/>

point is not assuming that a NUMBER (their age) is the determiner for <br/>
readiness.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never watched the Sopranos, don&#39;t have HBO.  Have watched any number <br/>
of shoot &#39;em up movies, with language issues, etc. in front of or  WITH my <br/>
little ones.  I am with them, if they are bothered, we find something <br/>
else.  I&#39;ve even offered to watch something else only to have the 3 year <br/>
old say no.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it&#39;s unfair to judge a program by a few scenes.  Information <br/>
taken out of context can be much more upsetting.  Many fairy tales are WAY <br/>
more horrific than your average cop movie, but they have the moral at the <br/>
end--the resolution, which can make all the difference.  Order is restored, <br/>
the world is safe again.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; readiness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course it&#39;s not about a number.  There are adults (myself <br/>
included) who will never be &quot;ready.&quot; That&#39;s probably not even the <br/>
best word to use since it implies that &quot;readiness&quot; will certainly <br/>
come at some point in the future, and it won&#39;t necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t pick the age 2 arbitrarily.  There is gray area, and then <br/>
there is common sense.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a 2yo being interested in the Sopranos any more than <br/>
I can imagine a 2yo requesting Debbie Does Dallas from the video <br/>
store or a pack of cigarettes from 7-11.<br/>
<br/>
My point to the original poster was that it isn&#39;t likely that the <br/>
2yo had a genuine interest in the show, and it&#39;s very likely that <br/>
the 2yo was imitating the exitement over the program modelled by the <br/>
adults around him.  Since she was looking for a solution I gave what <br/>
I thought was a perfectly sensible one.  And I gave it as a person <br/>
who&#39;s raised several 2yos, has hundreds of direct tv channels, and <br/>
believes wholeheartedly in tv freedom.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have too.  The Sopranos, IMO, is above and beyond the average <br/>
shoot &#39;em up movie as far as being relevant to a toddler, and also <br/>
goes well beyond mere language issues.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s unfair to judge my judgement that a program isn&#39;t <br/>
likely to be of interest to toddlers without having seen the program <br/>
yourself.<br/>
I wonder if you watched a couple of episodes whether you&#39;d introduce <br/>
them to *your* young child- watch them when he&#39;s around, place them <br/>
within his access, talk them up to him, etc.  My guess is not.  (How <br/>
old are your children by the way?)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also think it&#39;s unfair to judge a program by a few scenes.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Information <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; taken out of context can be much more upsetting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who is it unfair to?  <br/>
Why would I make myself continue to watch something that&#39;s <br/>
disturbing to me just so that I can judge it in its entirety?  <br/>
When I rented The Mummy for my interested-in-mummies (and not very <br/>
easily disturbed by fantasy) child, and after a few minutes he knew <br/>
intuitively that it would scare him too much, I thought him wise, <br/>
not unfair.<br/>
<br/>
I do the same thing with books.   I&#39;ve started many novels only to <br/>
decide a short way into them that they&#39;re not (to me) worth <br/>
finishing.  Should I force myself to read the entire book so that I <br/>
can judge it fairly as a whole?  Mabye that would be really nice of <br/>
me, but I have better things to do with my time.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>All three of my children love the Lord of the Rings movies, although <br/>
my youngest will wisely leave the room during scenes he finds <br/>
disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really curious now... does anyone who *is* familiar with the <br/>
Sopranos think it&#39;s appropriate to strew in front of a 2yo, and, <br/>
having done that, that the 2yo would have a genuine desire to keep <br/>
watching it?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You haven&#39;t offered up any reasons why your son seeing those movies would be bad other then you being uncomfortable which I think has nothing to do with why he shouldn&#39;t watch them and that he might freak out. I was terrified of the Brady Bunch for years because of one episode where one of the kids disapeared from inside a magic box. Many kids have freaked out at the flying monkey scenes in, &quot;the Wizard of Oz&#39;. &quot;Time Bandits&#39;, another kid flick, could turn my stomach but I still loved watching action and horror movies and had nary a nightmare. <br/>
Why would those movies be something to keep from him?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t know if he can separate &quot;pretend&quot; from<br/>
reality yet.<br/>

Frankly, I don&#39;t see her being scared by monsters and violent scenes. It&#39;s going to be the ones with spooky atmospheres and ideas that don&#39;t leave your head after the movie ends that will get to her I bet. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885400145">When I rented The Mummy for my interested-in-mummies (and not very <br/>
easily disturbed by fantasy) child, and after a few minutes he knew <br/>
intuitively that it would scare him too much, I thought him wise, <br/>
not unfair.<br/>
=======<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;For what it&#39;s worth, Warner Brothers had a whole cartoon series called <br/>
The Mummy, which my kids love. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s on anymore, but <br/>
there&#39;s a feature length movie called Secrets of the Lost Scrolls, which <br/>
is how we discovered it. Very cool without the horror scary kind of <br/>
stuff. Imhotep is still the bad guy though, which for the life of me, I <br/>
can&#39;t figure out why they villified him. He was a very powerful scribe, <br/>
architect and doctor--I didn&#39;t find anything negative about him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187258902">LOR is pretty gory and scary - but if a kid wanted to watch it I&#39;d put it on<br/>

<br/>
************************************************************<br/>
When Dh and I saw the first LOTR movie I was scared.  My kids all wanted to<br/>
see it, especially the older two, and I told them not until they were much<br/>
older.  After reading about other people&#39;s experiences in letting their kids<br/>
self-regulate, I decided to let them see it, but at home on DVD so we could<br/>
stop or pause it if it was too much for them.  I was hoping that my<br/>
six-year-old wouldn&#39;t be interested and we could go off and play, but she<br/>
wanted to see what the big deal was.  When we got to the first scary part<br/>
(at least to me) when the Hobbits were all hiding off the road under the<br/>
tree roots and the black horse things were looking for them (sorry I don&#39;t<br/>
remember what they&#39;re called), I paused the movie and asked if everyone was<br/>
O.K..  They were.  I asked my daughter if this was too scary for her.  She<br/>
looked at me in disbelief, and said, in a very patronizing tone, as if I<br/>
were simple:  &quot;Mom, IT&#39;S PRETEND.&quot;  And it is.  So we continued.  <br/>
We all saw the other two at the Theaters.  When Return of the King came out<br/>
we went to the late show on opening night in a college area.  All of the<br/>
college kids chatting with us as we waited in line were asking how come they<br/>
were out so late on a school night, etc.  I think they got a little extra<br/>
education that night. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think this works much better than my nieces who couldn&#39;t wait to see their<br/>
first Pg movie, then their first Pg-13 movie.  Now they all can&#39;t wait to<br/>
see their first rated R movie.  They&#39;ve made it such a big deal!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

~~~<br/>
Will and I watched it for the first time on cable just the other day.   We <br/>
both had to avert our eyes at lots of the war scenes.  He didn&#39;t find  the Orcs <br/>
as scary as he would have when he was just a little younger  when it first <br/>
came out.  I saw it at the theater, and  all lots of our kid friend were seeing <br/>
it then, but he and I both knew it  was too much.  I innocently put in Kill <br/>
Bill Vol. 1 thinking it would be  just standard gory, but it was horrible, messy, <br/>
comic book gory, and I wish I  hadn&#39;t watched it.  Will was not home and I&#39;m <br/>
grateful for that, but I  think he would have gotten up and left the room.  <br/>
 <br/>
The other day I was flipping through the channels, looking for something to  <br/>
put on while I cleaned the room.  In a sad bit of coincidence, the channel  <br/>
stopped on a B-movie of a woman as her eyes exploded out of her head.  In  my <br/>
haste to change the channel I lost control of the remote and the image was  <br/>
seared into my brain.  The last words I heard before I got the channel  changed <br/>
were an announcer saying something about the movie...so it wasn&#39;t the  actual <br/>
movie being shown, but a show about B movies or something.  <br/>
 <br/>
I told Will about it later.  He said he was grossed out just thinking  about <br/>
it, and that he was glad it wasn&#39;t him.  He laughed at the visual  image of me <br/>
not being able to change the channel quickly enough.  They&#39;re  showing <br/>
commercials for the Excorist sequel/prequel? on Nick At Night!   We&#39;re both creeped <br/>
out when it comes on.  Who wants to be subjected to that  during the Cosby <br/>
Show?  <br/>
 <br/>
I guess I&#39;m being longwinded to say that as a 10 yo he still knows his  <br/>
limits.  I&#39;m 42 and mine haven&#39;t changed much since Abbot and Costello Meet  <br/>
Dracula and Frankenstein.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903152246"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have too.  The Sopranos, IMO, is above and beyond the average<br/>
&gt;shoot &#39;em up movie as far as being relevant to a toddler, and also<br/>
&gt;goes well beyond mere language issues.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Toddlers are remarkably sensitive to relationships and a sense of <br/>
justice.  I can imagine a small child getting caught up in the &quot;soap opera&quot; <br/>
part.<br/>
<br/>
The point is--we are not in our child&#39;s mind.  I&#39;m not so much arguing the <br/>
relative merit of the Sopranos, because, as we&#39;ve discussed, I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
it.  I&#39;m wondering why the dismissal of &quot;a 2 year old wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
interested&quot; and not &quot;Talk to your child about the program, see if you can <br/>
figure out what it is that interests him, if it&#39;s just your interest that <br/>
will become clear, if it is something else, perhaps you can redirect him to <br/>
something with the same appeal and no scary bits.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all.  That&#39;s my point.  To not dismiss the child&#39;s interest as just <br/>
being a reflection of the parent&#39;s interest but to consider going deeper.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I also think it&#39;s unfair to judge a program by a few scenes.<br/>
&gt;Information<br/>
&gt; &gt; taken out of context can be much more upsetting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think it&#39;s unfair to judge my judgement that a program isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;likely to be of interest to toddlers without having seen the program<br/>
&gt;yourself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t.  I have no concrete opinion on the show.  Haven&#39;t seen it.  I <br/>
CAN imagine reasons, other than parent&#39;s interest, why a child would be <br/>
interested in mature subjects.  Not in a scary, probably abused, <br/>
inappropriate way, but in a genuine interest in, for example, personal <br/>
interaction.  Kids pick up on that stuff really well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wonder if you watched a couple of episodes whether you&#39;d introduce<br/>
&gt;them to *your* young child- watch them when he&#39;s around, place them<br/>
&gt;within his access, talk them up to him, etc.  My guess is not.  (How<br/>
&gt;old are your children by the way?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What difference does it make what age my kids are?  (I&#39;ve already said in <br/>
this thread, btw.)  I HAVE introduced some very adult shows to my kids.  I <br/>
watch all kinds of things.  My eldest didn&#39;t like X-files at about the age <br/>
we are talking about and so I missed a couple seasons in first run.  Now I <br/>
get to show them to him and he thinks they are cool.  He made it VERY clear <br/>
(and he wasn&#39;t very verbal at 2) that he didn&#39;t like it.  Ok, fair enough.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I ask my husband not to watch the Dave Chappelle show around the <br/>
kids.  First off, it&#39;s personal--I hate it and I&#39;m uncomfortable so <br/>
I  don&#39;t get family time if it&#39;s on.  Second, I do think it&#39;s a bit icky to <br/>
have the kids listen to (lots of racial stereotypes, sex jokes, <br/>
etc.)  Third, the kids clearly don&#39;t get it and also have that sense of it <br/>
not being family time.  If they asked for it to be put back on, I&#39;d have to <br/>
look at why, try to figure it out.  Parental interest is ONE reason.  But I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t jump to the assumption that was the only reason.  (Though, God&#39;s, <br/>
I&#39;d hope so, I hate it!!! -smile-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I also think it&#39;s unfair to judge a program by a few scenes.<br/>
&gt;Information<br/>
&gt; &gt; taken out of context can be much more upsetting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Who is it unfair to?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IN THIS SETTING, the child.  You are assuming his/her interest is only <br/>
because of the parent&#39;s interest.  With less than the whole show to go <br/>
on.  I&#39;m making no assumptions about the reasons, because I have no info <br/>
directly on the show.  I am speculation another reason.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Why would I make myself continue to watch something that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;disturbing to me just so that I can judge it in its entirety?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you are making the decision just for you, no reason.  If you are a <br/>
parent assessing a program in order to guide your child,  perhaps your child.<br/>
<br/>
But you might miss something interesting to you by not being willing to <br/>
work outside your comfort level.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m really curious now... does anyone who *is* familiar with the<br/>
&gt;Sopranos think it&#39;s appropriate to strew in front of a 2yo, and,<br/>

&gt;watching it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Patti<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;m curious why it isn&#39;t clear that the point isn&#39;t the Sopranos.  It&#39;s <br/>
any program that we are making a judgement about.  Our judgment may be <br/>
correct.  I wouldn&#39;t doubt that yours WAS in that setting.  I still think <br/>
that assuming the reason a child would be interested in a more mature <br/>
program is only the parents interest is underestimating a child.  And if <br/>
you do it when they are two, you might do it when they are 10.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about the idea, not the Sopranos and not that two year old.<br/>

mealtime, and not having to clean their whole plates.<br/>

violence, it is mostly adults talking, very boring for a young <br/>
child.  He usually plays a computer game when it is on since the <br/>

&gt; &gt; because of the parent&#39;s interest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One way to find out would be to put the DVDs away at a time when the<br/>
&gt;child was occupied with something else, stop talking about them<br/>
&gt;around him, and see if he continues to ask for them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, that&#39;s a way to test it.  But you didn&#39;t suggest that to originally, <br/>
did you?  You just stated that a 2 year old wouldn&#39;t be interested.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; But you might miss something interesting to you by not being<br/>
&gt;willing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; work outside your comfort level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are you missing something interesting to you by asking you husband<br/>
&gt;not to put on the show with the racist remarks you mentioned?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I might be.  And I&#39;m willing to risk that.  My choice.  But it&#39;s made with <br/>
the knowledge that I MIGHT miss something.  I respect my husband.  That <br/>
means I assume he is getting something from watching that program.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know what, &#39;cause I can&#39;t stand it.  Don&#39;t like South Park much either.  I <br/>
think I&#39;ve watched one I even found remotely funny.  Lots of people I <br/>
respect like it.  Love it.  Yuck.  Maybe if I gave it more time, watched it <br/>
with him, talked about it, I would get something from it.  Not worth it to me.<br/>
<br/>
But assuming that because I don&#39;t like it that it can&#39;t have value to him, <br/>
on his own, would be wrong.  Assuming that about a child--not matter their <br/>
age, no matter the content--is wrong, too.  It&#39;s just bad practice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;There are enough alternatives out there for me that I don&#39;t need to<br/>
&gt;desensitive myself to something I find repulsive just in case I<br/>
&gt;might find a redeeming quality somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nor do I.  My point wasn&#39;t that you should.  My point was that by looking <br/>
at a portion of what was going on--violent content, you are not looking at <br/>
the other parts of the program.  Now, you are fully in your rights to do <br/>
that.  But when you declare that another person won&#39;t see anything more <br/>
than that, that&#39;s when I had a problem with it.  I have a problem with it <br/>
in PRINCIPLE.  Not in application to your children or to the original <br/>
poster&#39;s children.  But because it sets up a situation where you could be <br/>
dismissing a valid interest because you are assuming it does not exist.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &gt; I still think<br/>
&gt; &gt; that assuming the reason a child would be interested in a more<br/>
&gt;mature<br/>
&gt; &gt; program is only the parents interest is underestimating a child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I disagree.<br/>
&gt;2yo&#39;s often imitate their parents.  My toddlers would open a book I<br/>
&gt;was reading and pretend to read it, turning the pages, etc.<br/>
&gt;My oldest used to, at age 2, pretend to nurse a doll when I nursed<br/>
&gt;his brother.  Is &quot;assuming&quot; that they were imitating me<br/>
&gt;underestimating them in some way?  I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So because children imitate their parents at that age it is the only reason <br/>
that they are interested in things at that age?  This is what I hear you <br/>
saying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; And if<br/>
&gt; &gt; you do it when they are two, you might do it when they are 10.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a child past ten.<br/>
&gt;He no longer pretends to nurse dolls or imitates the adults around<br/>
&gt;him like he did at 2.  There wouldn&#39;t *be* a reason for me to<br/>
&gt;imagine that when he wants to watch something he&#39;s just imitating me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So at 10 your children no longer look to you for things to emulate?  I <br/>
doubt that.  I still look to my parents and even my grandparents for advice <br/>
and guidance on what is interesting, what is fun, what is safe, etc.  I&#39;m 37.<br/>
<br/>
I NEVER said that children don&#39;t emulate their parents.  I never said the <br/>
original poster&#39;s child wasn&#39;t emulating his parents.  I certainly think <br/>
that we should watch what we do around our kids because they DO emulate <br/>
us.  BUT.....I do not assume that is the only reason my kids do something.<br/>

the idea of the child just wanting to imitate the parent seemed <br/>
obvious to me.<br/>
She said something about &quot;if&quot; she let him watch it he might not get <br/>
further than 2 or 3 minutes into it.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; part. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids couldn&#39;t even follow the plot of Dumbo.  They just really liked the <br/>
songs and the music, and the colorful funniest parts.<br/>
<br/>
Toddlers don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patoot about adults talking in shows.<br/>
<br/>
My kids used to watch Rocky Horror Picture Show, but by &quot;watch&quot; I mean be in <br/>
and out of the room when it was on, or playing with Ninja Turtles, or <br/>
whatever.    I had told them the premise of the story (aliens whose main knowledge of <br/>
earth culture was what they had seen of old B&W monster movies broadcast on TV <br/>
before the mid-1960s).   <br/>
<br/>
Holly figured out this year (she&#39;s 12) that Frankenfurter was a man dressed <br/>
as a woman (kind of).  It never mattered.  She was too young to pay attention <br/>
to what wasn&#39;t interesting to her.  (And now she&#39;s too mature to pay attention <br/>
to what&#39;s not interesting. LOL)   <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, one of her friends was forbidden to see ANY of that video until <br/>
she was 12.  &quot;Wait &#39;til you&#39;re 12.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so for all those years, Holly was humming some of the tunes, knowing who <br/>
Susan Sarandon and Tim Curry were, paying more attention to Meatloaf when <br/>
music or movies of his came around, and she and Marty once did a very cool <br/>
comparison of Rocky Horror and some other movie involving aliens.   <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t make them watch it, nor even encourage it.  I don&#39;t know whether <br/>
Kirby or Marty has even watched it all the way through in one pass.  Holly has, <br/>
and has seen the stage play, because she&#39;s like that about musicals.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend who waited to be twelve finally watched it and was doing nothing <br/>
but looking for the nasty bits she had been sheltered from.<br/>
<br/>
Holly never saw it as &quot;nasty&quot; or tantalizing or sexy.  Her friend sees it as <br/>
nothing BUT that, and she waited for years, so it BETTER have some racy stuff. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The movie has had a much bigger affect on the one who was forbidden to see it <br/>
than on the one who could watch it or not, over the years.   Not a big deal, <br/>
for Holly.  BIGdeal deal for other kid.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, I looked it up.  To imitate something is to mimic the actions of.  To <br/>
emulate something is to &quot;strive to equal or match especially by <br/>
imitating.&quot;  So imitating is the behavior, emulation is the goal.  So if <br/>
our 2 year olds, or 10 year olds are imitating us, it is in hopes of <br/>
emulating us.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all part of the same thing.  Why else would a child imitate if not to <br/>
emulate.  When they get older we call it sharing interests, but it&#39;s the <br/>
same impulse.  It is a valid reason for any child to do something that a <br/>
parent does.  It is NOT the only reason.<br/>

it&#39;s parents, I propose that there are a multitude of reasons a child might <br/>
watch a program with adult/mature/questionable content which have to do <br/>
with the child and not the parents.  You presented an answer to THAT <br/>
situation, I presented an answer to that TYPE of situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;ve twisted anything.  In the specific you may well have <br/>
been correct.  In the general I think there was more to say.  I said it.<br/>
