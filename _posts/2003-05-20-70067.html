 </span></blockquote>What the heck, hey maybe it&#39;s just me here... BUT it kinda bugs me that you<br/>
asked this question at 8:17 this morning, and plenty of people (myself<br/>
included) took time and effort to post to your questions and concerns. Three<br/>
hours later, you &quot;have just found out&quot; that the local colleges &quot;encourage<br/>
studetns to be 16 or older&quot;, and half a day later, you come back with &quot;since<br/>
they don&#39;t accept students under 16, it&#39;s no longer an issue..&quot;<br/>
Then *why the heck* did you post about it? I have to wonder if this was some<br/>
kind of troll post, just to see what you would get back from the list. To<br/>
me, it feels like a waste of everyone&#39;s valuable time (hmmm.... this sounds<br/>
familiar). I somehow can&#39;t totally buy that between 8:17 and 11:45 (or<br/>
whatever the equivalents in your local time), you called every one of the<br/>
local colleges (you used the plural there) and found that all of them<br/>
&quot;encourage&quot; students to be 16. Then by 3:56 *the same day*, none of them are<br/>
now &quot;accepting&quot; 16 year old students at all so it&#39;s &quot;no longer an issue&quot;<br/>
I hate to say it, but I really do wish you would go away and stop wasting<br/>
everyone&#39;s time here. There are lots of people who post here who are new to<br/>
unschooling and many have questions I have heard over and over through the<br/>
years that I&#39;ve been on this list, but most of them post in good faith. I&#39;m<br/>
not sure that I can say the same for you, and I find that disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I&#39;m sure they do actually accept students under the age of 16. When I<br/>
started college, &quot;they&quot; (the University) &quot;did not accept&quot; 16 year old<br/>
students, let alone ones without a high school diploma (I rose out of high<br/>
school instead of finishing). Fortunately, &quot;they&quot; were convinced otherwise<br/>
by a persistent kid (me). If it&#39;s actually true that your daughter really<br/>
did want to go to college, I&#39;m sure she could get past the 16-year-old<br/>
thing. Plenty of kids do. Heck, I worked with someone at Microsoft that<br/>
*graduated* from *MIT* at the age of 16. And MIT is not exactly easy to get<br/>
into. I&#39;m willing to bet that a local community college could be persuaded<br/>
to take a younger kid.<br/>
<br/>
So all things considered, this whole thread smells like a dead herring. Or<br/>
is that a red herring... either way it stinks.<br/>
