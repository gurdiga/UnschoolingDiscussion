&lt;&lt;        Okay.  I&#39;m ready for that encouragement now!  Thanks for listening <br/>
to <br/>
 me rant a bit, or more that a bit :o)...<br/>

Hi Wendy,<br/>
It sounds like you already understand how damaging school is, even to the <br/>
kids that do seemingly well.<br/>
You also seem to understand how well people learn outside of that system when <br/>
they&#39;re motivated...so, I don&#39;t know that there are any magical words we can <br/>
give you that will take the fear away.<br/>
Maybe knowing that there are loads of unschooled kids here doing well and <br/>
learning every day will be of some comfort, or maybe reading about <br/>
unschoolers that are all grown up and leading the lives of their choosing?<br/>
I think time is what you need right now.<br/>
Pretend you are on summer vacation, spring break, whatever.....and live each <br/>
day as though your goal is to have as much fun as possible with your son.<br/>
As you do this and watch the learning happen, it will ease your fears.<br/>
I wrote an article in Home Education Magazine (March/April issue) that <br/>
addresses the issue of fear.<br/>
Maybe you can get a sample copy, it&#39;s a great magazine to subscribe to!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
