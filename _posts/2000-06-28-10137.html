 </span></blockquote>I am not just one of my children&#39;s friends, I am their mother and it is my<br/>
job to train them and teach them.  I do not need the permission of my<br/>
children to administer correction.  Do you seriously ask permission from<br/>
your children before you correct them?<br/>
<br/>
And no, I do not think anytime someone touches another without permission it<br/>
is abuse.  I have been bumped into, had my feet stepped on, and hugged<br/>
without my permission, and would in no way consider those abuse.  People<br/>
accidentally bump into, step on, and even knock others over on a regular<br/>
basis.  It doesn&#39;t mean they are abusers.  Lighten up!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835871465">&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;You are abusing your child if you aren&#39;t parenting exactly like<br/>
me.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>was <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;abusive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I was told that we are dysfunctional and co-dependent.  I was<br/>
told I am not unschooling before any of you had anything but an inkling<br/>
of how my household runs.  I&#39;ve seen enough to turn that back on every<br/>
one of the people who said it. but I haven&#39;t done it.  What I have<br/>
realized is that many of the very people who were accusing me of being<br/>
too rigid with my children are actually MORE rigid than I am and seem to<br/>
respect their children less.  At least that is what could be taken from<br/>
several posts I&#39;ve read since then.  But, I haven&#39;t generalized or made<br/>
assumptions about the people posting because I understand that I am just<br/>
seeing a little sliver of their lives.  I may comment on what they have<br/>
said but I don&#39;t extrapolate from the fact that one does not allow her<br/>
child to ride a bike alone that she also forces her to sit and write<br/>
sentences against her will all day long.  That would be as unfair as<br/>
assuming that because my family has a job list, I must have coerced them<br/>
into it.<br/>
<br/>
And Sandra, here is what you said:<br/>
<br/>
#26320<br/>
And some of them are NOT doing the best they can do, they have a<br/>
veneer-thin overlay <br/>
of justification for child abuse, or they themselves are so hard-hearted<br/>
and <br/>
cold that they don&#39;t see that their children are being harmed to the<br/>
point <br/>
that they, those children, could become a danger to all of OUR children<br/>
in <br/>
their frustration.<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
In light of recent conversations, and the fact that you insisted on<br/>
telling me that my children must be depressed because of me, I can only<br/>
assume you lump me into that category too.<br/>
<br/>
At least one person on this list still insists on painting me as an<br/>
abusive mother of a dysfunctional family and, yeah, I resent that.  And<br/>
yet not a single person has asked if my children are HAPPY before<br/>
condemning me.<br/>

men and women say this to their children. &quot;If you had mowed that lawn right <br/>
the first time, I wouldn&#39;t have had to hit you.&quot; (in this case it was a dog <br/>
chain laying on a table in the yard.) &quot;If you had dusted that shelf with the <br/>
grain of the wood like I have told you to do before, you wouldn&#39;t have missed <br/>
that small speck, (that probably fell after said dusting was done, but it <br/>
really didn&#39;t matter anyway) I wouldn&#39;t have to spank you with the belt right <br/>
now.&quot; &quot;If you had ordered what I wanted you to order, and not that crap you <br/>
thought you wanted, but found out you really didn&#39;t like it after all, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be beating the shit out of you all the way home, and your Mother <br/>
could be in the front seat instead of in the back with your sister and <br/>
brother, so you are getting 10 extra when we get home for that too.&quot; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>A small child has NO idea how things work &quot;on the outside&quot;---outside his own <br/>
small world of home and family. It&#39;s not until he&#39;s of an age to leave home <br/>
for short (or longer) periods that he sees what else is available---or that <br/>
hitting is NOT OK.  That time is often first grade---when he starts spending <br/>
nights away from home---and he SEES how it is in other families.<br/>
<br/>
A child who may overhear from a stranger that spanking is NOT OK, may <br/>
eventually come to realize that it&#39;s not how every family operates. HE may <br/>
change. HE may eventually insist that he be treated differently. HE may not <br/>
spank HIS kids! What a revolution!<br/>
<br/>
Or we could just keep it all in the closet and say that &quot;yeah, if you believe <br/>
it to be a fine way to rear children, please go ahead. Spanking&#39;s not <br/>
illegal. I don&#39;t know any better than you how to BEST treat kids. Besides, <br/>
it&#39;s not THAT hard, and they&#39;ll forget anyway.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
I was spanked. Everyone I knew was spanked (as far as I know!). It wasn&#39;t <br/>
until I met someone who was never spanked (!) (that was Fiona, by the way <br/>
when we were 10!), that I was  WOWed into realizing that there was another <br/>
way to discipline a child.<br/>
<br/>
Novel!<br/>

  LOL, actually, believe it or not, no! I was just stating my opinion that forceful interference can do more harm than good, and that sincere, non-judgemental offers of help could do much more good. Plus trying to make the point that not all parents have the same child-rearing philosophies and that doesn&#39;t mean they should be attacked for it. Lord knows I never wanted in on a spanking debate! Or to discuss beaten wives or drunks in allies. Oh well. <br/>
