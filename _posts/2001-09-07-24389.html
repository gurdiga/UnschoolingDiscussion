<div id="ygrps-yiv-246015211">When my dad was bed ridden we used a product by Aveeno -- a waterless<br/>
body cleanser.  <br/>
It was pleasant smelling and didn&#39;t  need rinsing,  just wash with a wash<br/>
cloth.  We used it on his hair and it worked great.  I think there are<br/>
other brands available at health food stores too.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283292979">Thanks so much for all the suggestion. I think he just has this head wet <br/>
aversion, he loves games and colored soaps and such, has no aversion to <br/>
washing or baths.  But some of the ideas were really neat....we&#39;ll try them!<br/>
