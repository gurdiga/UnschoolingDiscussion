<br/>
&lt;&lt; My question -- do most of you have no <br/>
restrictions as far as age-appropriateness and/or time spent watching TV? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just speaking for myself, not most of the list.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable, so some people pooh-pooh my personal answer, but we <br/>
don&#39;t restrict.<br/>
<br/>
Kids pretty well self-restrict.  They don&#39;t like to watch stuff they think is <br/>
boring or scary, and they&#39;re all busy kids.  When they were littler lots of <br/>
stuff was boring.  Too much talking or romance, and they had no interest.  <br/>
<br/>
They can watch all they want.  We find that&#39;s not so much as most people <br/>
would guess.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s watching The Simpsons (waiting for it to start, rather, after the <br/>
game, and after the news).  Kirby and Marty are playing video games with guests.  <br/>
Keith&#39;s probably watching the weather and will turn it off at 10:20 and go to <br/>
sleep.  I watched half an episode of That 70&#39;s Show, with Holly, but that was <br/>
my personal total today.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And <br/>
do you have concerns about the corporate/advertising influence on your kids <br/>
-- &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  They&#39;re smart and analytical.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think I can work toward trusting him, <br/>
knowing he will choose content that he finds compelling and therefore is not <br/>
&quot;trash&quot; (even Power Rangers -- that&#39;s a new one for us and my ex-teacher self <br/>
is <br/>
silently struggling with that), but are there any pitfalls with that attitude <br/>
that I need to be aware of? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The pitfall is the possibility of your thinking that you&#39;ll know what&#39;s <br/>
&quot;trash,&quot; or thinking there are &quot;trash&quot; things from which your child would learn <br/>
nothing at all.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and Marty both sometimes watch a kind of odious late-night game show <br/>
called Street Smarts.  I told them I thought it was awful, that they are betting <br/>
on who will be more stupid.  They both fell over the other explaining to me <br/>
what was cool about it, and they were right!  Everything they said made sense.  <br/>
I got it.<br/>
<br/>
They both sometimes watch Jerry Springer.  It embarrasses me because I have <br/>
many poor southern relatives and I hate to think of the similarities.  But <br/>
that&#39;s my personal problem. &lt;g&gt;   They see it in several different ways, and have <br/>
discussed why people would be the way they are.  They don&#39;t think those people <br/>
are typical or sensible.  We&#39;ve talked about how lacking some people are in <br/>
the most basic of social skills and awarenesses, and what might help them be <br/>
better and that show is one of the most fascinating labs for what lack of <br/>
interpersonal intelligence can lead to.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t personally like courtroom shows, but years ago, when I was a kid, I <br/>
really did.<br/>
When I was little I remember watching Queen for a Day.  They would give  <br/>
refrigerator or a washing machine to the contestant with the most pitiable story <br/>
of poverty and loss.  The rest maybe went home with a home game or some <br/>
Rice-a-Roni, I don&#39;t remember.<br/>
<br/>
I used to watch The Price is Right all through my childhood, and it didn&#39;t <br/>
scar me at all.  I learned what cars and boats and nice furniture cost.  I <br/>
started learning odds and strategies for the various math games they had.<br/>
<br/>
My Gilligan&#39;s Island stream of consciousness is here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>
<br/>
so I&#39;m guessing Amy saw it already.<br/>
<br/>
My kids know NOW what they like about shows and what they&#39;re good for.  I had <br/>
to think for years to get it.<br/>
<br/>
TV&#39;s nobody&#39;s main hobby here.  It&#39;s just one of many things.<br/>

I had an interesting experience today.  It&#39;s taken me a lot to get <br/>
comfortable with TV, and this list has helped me turn my thinking about it <br/>
completely around.  So today, a kid comes around with a pledge sheet <br/>
wanting me to help his class with their Turn Off The TV for a Week <br/>
deal.  At the time I didn&#39;t even think about *why* they would need help or <br/>
what they might be pledging.  I just said, &quot;No, I think TV is a good <br/>
thing.&quot;  Surprised myself all to hell.  &lt;g&gt;  Afterwards I wished I had told <br/>
him that he probably learns more watching TV than he does in school.  &lt;evil <br/>

a week. Maybe the kids learned something :-) The strange thing was that <br/>
during the summer most kids are in planned activities but that week there <br/>
weren&#39;t any so they were free to play. Unfortunately many were free to roam <br/>
and make mischief, being unparented.<br/>
<br/>
We were fine and lost none of our ten trees, just some branches and a <br/>
couple of lilacs. We also had our electricity back in 36 hours while some <br/>
people are still waiting. There are some pictures here if you are <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844585570">TV, video games and computer are not restricted in our house.  I am the TV<br/>
lover, like to have it on for the noise mostly, both kids ask if they can<br/>
shut it off.  LOL  Lanora loves the computer, she chats, writes stories and<br/>
searches the internet, mostly for anime, manga and fan fiction.  Jonathan<br/>
loves video games, we have Nintendo 64 and Playstation 2, with plans to get<br/>
Xbox and GameCube somewhere down the road.  He goes in spurts, right now<br/>
he&#39;s in the &quot;games when I wake up and play until I can&#39;t stay awake anymore&quot;<br/>
mode.  It passes and then he&#39;s more interested in outside activities and<br/>
other play.<br/>
<br/>
There are very few conflicts over who gets to use what and everyone is<br/>
pretty happy with what they are doing.  I use the computer in the morning<br/>
and am usually done before either of them wants to take over.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve observed about Lanora is that her passion for writing has<br/>
taken off since she began to be active on the computer.  I think the<br/>
combination of chatting and writing has been a good stimulus for her.<br/>
<br/>
I know that limiting any of these things would result in unhappiness and<br/>
resentment, I would feel that way if someone was telling me that what I<br/>
really loved wasn&#39;t valuable enough to invest so must of time.<br/>

True.  The context, though, was that having the opporunity to watch <br/>
to their heart&#39;s content, crap or not, they came to sift through <br/>
the &quot;crap&quot; to find what they thought was &quot;not crap.&quot;  Which to them <br/>
was Liberace. :-)<br/>
 I think that not &quot;becoming slavishly devoted to television&quot; like <br/>
the rest of their generation meant that they had the freedom to sift <br/>
through themselves rather than just rapturously watch whatever was <br/>
on during their prescribed hour.<br/>
