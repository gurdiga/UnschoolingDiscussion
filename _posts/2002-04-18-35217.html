<div id="ygrps-yiv-890603706">Hello Pam,<br/>
<br/>
I was labeled math excelled in K and left my happy teacher and room with 1 <br/>
other smart guy to be drilled with 2-3 grade math. I missed story time and <br/>
free play. Got back to the room for recess and nap. For the whole year. Sad. <br/>
I knew my math facts because I snuck into my big brother and sister&#39;s books <br/>
and played math and school when I was 3-4 years old. I have a photographic <br/>
memory, so I looked smart to the Kindergarden teacher and voila, my path was <br/>
set for me. I have since always fely uncomfortable with language arts. I was <br/>
math smart, right? They even thought I was reading delayed in 1st grade and <br/>
tested me. Hello, I missed reading in K, make any sense. So, for the rest of <br/>
my ps career, I felt dumb and brilliant. Weird for self-esteem. I got by <br/>
doing minimum always. I was AP math and finished community college calculus <br/>
my senior year of HS. I had to redo english again and again. I&#39;m still <br/>
affected I think, from this early label of math smart.<br/>
<br/>
In college I found plants and my passion. I picked a career in horticulture. <br/>
I&#39;m finally comfortable because I know my strengths. I&#39;m great at what I do <br/>
and I love it too, though since kids I really do not work for money. I <br/>
usually just get asked all kinds of plant/gardening questions from my <br/>
friends and their spouses and anyone else, because I love to talk plants and <br/>
anyone who asks is going to get me going.<br/>

Caillou is a about a little guy and his family. Very sweet drawings. Caillou <br/>
has little hair and a baby sister named Rosie. Sagwa is the name of the show <br/>
Holly likes, which mine adore. We need to figure out how to tape on the new <br/>
VCR, since Ashley has swimming everyday when Sagwa is on.<br/>
