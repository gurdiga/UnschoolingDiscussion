Fifteen hours on a plane? Yikes. I&#39;m assuming, then, that it&#39;s an<br/>
international flight, and those are really even safer...<br/>
<br/>
I travel alone with my 8 yr old, who is actually much easier to travel<br/>
with nowadays... she&#39;s been on lots of long plane trips, though, she&#39;s a<br/>
pretty seasoned flyer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have an incredibly sensitive child, and it&#39;s been a real learning<br/>
experience for me. Five was a hard year for her, as was six... but one<br/>
thing I realized was that my expectations often had a lot to do with her<br/>
responses. When I believed that after some shock she would never do X<br/>
again, it seemed to hold true, but when I could start to believe that<br/>
after some sort of trauma she would be quite upset and would need time<br/>
and space and support, but that she was also a tough little cookie and<br/>
would get through it and do what needed to be done... that&#39;s what<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday she got bit in the face by my parents&#39; previously traumatized<br/>
dog, for no reason that we can figure - he&#39;s done this before, although<br/>
not for a long time, he fear-bites and we haven&#39;t figured out the<br/>
trigger. It was pretty scary, for a good 20 minutes she just sat there in<br/>
shock with my arms around her, then finally she relaxed enough to lean<br/>
back onto me, and it took over an hour before she really came around. But<br/>
two hours after it happened, she called the dog over and patted his head<br/>
and forgave him - she does love this dog, and he does love him.<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, most  people might think they should get rid of this dog, but<br/>
it&#39;s not gonna happen...<br/>

grocery store, but stuff happens everywhere..<br/>
