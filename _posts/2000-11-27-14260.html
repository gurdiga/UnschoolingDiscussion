<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806894118">Did you know that the majority of the clothes made by Nike, The <br/>
Gap (which includes Old Navy and Banana Republic), Guess, and <br/>
Oshkosh are made in overseas sweatshops that treat, often <br/>
underaged, workers miserably?  When we buy clothes, toys, <br/>
housewares, gadgets, etc. that are made in China, Malaysia, <br/>
Vietnam, etc., etc., we are very often buying items made by workers <br/>
who are payed less in a month than we pay for a single Gap t-shirt <br/>
here?  Workers are made to work incredibly long hours, often <br/>
seven days a week, in terrible conditions, and then can afford only <br/>
to go home to their rat-infested shantytown without running water or <br/>
electricity? The Gap, for one, says they are doing something about <br/>
this, but a little research (try Coop Americas site for a start -- <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.coopamerica.org/)">http://www.coopamerica.org/)</a> shows that what they are saying is <br/>
mostly doublespeak.  Often even items that say they are made in <br/>
USA (and the Gap is a prime offender here) are made in Saipan, <br/>
which is under US rule, but still is home to many sweatshops.  <br/>
<br/>
And what happens to all the things we buy cheap in order to save <br/>
money? What happens to all the cheap plastic toys that break or <br/>
clothes that fall apart are too grungy after the kids have outgrown <br/>
them to pass on?  What happens to all the plastic shopping bags <br/>
that we bring things home in and all the plastic that pretty new things <br/>
are wrapped in?  We toss it all, and it adds to landfill and pollution.  <br/>
<br/>
And where does all this plastic come from?  And where does the <br/>
energy come from to run the factories these things are made in?  <br/>
Most often from our waning petroleum stores.  And what about <br/>
wood toys and paper bags? Only a small percentage of that is <br/>
being taken from sustainably managed forests.  The rest comes <br/>
from old forests that are being chopped down so that we can have <br/>
things cheap.  <br/>
<br/>
And why do we need all this stuff to begin with?  Often because we <br/>
are told we need it.  Commercials, advertisements, prominent <br/>
logos, peer pressure, etc. etc. all make us feel there is something <br/>
lacking in our lives if we dont have the latest this or enough that.  <br/>
Our children are hit especially hard by this, and it wreaks havoc on <br/>
their self-esteem.  <br/>
<br/>
When we make do without or buy things used or buy products <br/>
made with sustainably managed materials and support companies <br/>
that treat their workers well, we are doing our part to support human <br/>
rights and a clean environment and a better world (a world at all) for <br/>
our children and our grandchildren to grow up in.  <br/>
<br/>
Buy Nothing Day reminds us of these things. If enough people <br/>
refuse to be coerced into buying new things on that day, it can send <br/>
a message to the big corporations that we dont want sweatshops <br/>
or child labor or so much waste and that we dont want them to <br/>
coopt our children.  But even if only one person participates in Buy <br/>
Nothing Day, it can remind that person that there are things we can <br/>
do on a personal level to remove ourselves from the cruelties being <br/>
inflicted on other human beings and our planet.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693002244">Old Navy and The Gap are owned by one of the worst offenders of clear<br/>
cutting and poor forest management practices.  They bought up L-P land last<br/>
year and subbed it to Palco and went in with one of those cute machines that<br/>
appear in the kiddy movie &quot;Fern Gully&quot; (yes, those things are real, not<br/>
imaginary, although they don&#39;t quite look the same &lt;g&gt;) and clear cut and<br/>
destroyed several 1000 square miles of land.  And then laid off or just<br/>
plain fired hundreds of employees.<br/>
