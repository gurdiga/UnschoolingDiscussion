<div id="ygrps-yiv-996850549">As Kirby was just standing at the door to leave for a gaming tournament <br/>
across town, he was telling me about the house where spent the night last weekend,  <br/>
when he fell asleep and didn&#39;t make it home.   He said it was like a castle <br/>
of a house, and he was only in the basement and the kitchen, but the basement <br/>
was a huge rumpus room, and a bedroom, and two bathrooms, and the house had an <br/>
elevator, but it was broken, and. . .  <br/>
<br/>
He was acting that all out with his arms and making big eyes, and I said, <br/>
&quot;Why are his parents rich enough to have a house like that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I expected him to say they owned land or a car dealership, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
Doctors. <br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;Maybe they invented Toaster Strudle.  Who knows?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I laughed and told him to have a good time, but I wondered after he left <br/>
whether &quot;Toaster Strudle&quot; came up because that&#39;s what he ate in their castle-like <br/>
kitchen. &lt;g&gt;  We&#39;ve never had it here.<br/>
<br/>
Life is funny, and Kirby&#39;s funny.<br/>
