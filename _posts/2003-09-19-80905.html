<br/>
and I&#39;ve had about four sips of our &quot;grog&quot; (which is the dandelion <br/>
wine we put up in April) and wow! hee hee Not being much of a <br/>
drinker, this stuff is going to my head like anything! I&#39;ve already <br/>
got the giggles hee hee<br/>
<br/>
the stuff is STRONG...sweet, and very alcoholic! LOL I wonder how you <br/>
test the proof of a homemade wine ROFLOL arrrr<br/>

we were all going to have some...but the little kids better stay <br/>
away, methinks. <br/>
