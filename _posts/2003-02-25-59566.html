I just had to laugh at the irony of you reading this great stuff about<br/>
really spending time with your kids, while your kids (and dh) stood around<br/>
waiting for you to spend time with them.  Too funny!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you have a fun trip.<br/>

I&#39;m still learning!    And unfortunately the only way I learn those things is reading.  But I have been spending less time on the computer,   more time with the kids.  Notice--less posts from me!       <br/>
 <br/>
I am going to post a few this morning tho&#39;.    Kids are still sleeping.<br/>
