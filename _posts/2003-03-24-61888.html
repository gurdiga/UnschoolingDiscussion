&lt;&lt; Does anyone have any brilliant ideas on <br/>
 how I can keep this energetic child happy while I recover? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Shaving cream in the bathtub, a bin full of rice for her to scoop and pour <br/>
with, mganets (just keep her away from the computer!!), movies, playdough, <br/>
fill a sink with water and give her a bunch of scooping and pouring gadgets, <br/>
make her own recipes (put out cheap ingredients like sugar/flour/water), <br/>
scissors and paper, fill a small plastic pool with popcorn, use the same pool <br/>
for a warm bathtime right in the kitchen....<br/>
If you have an air popper, put it in the middle of the pool without the lid <br/>
on and watch the popcorn fly EVERY where! Great fun but make sure you stand <br/>
back a bit as it&#39;s very hot when it comes out.<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

What will a magnet do to a computer?  Just wondering, because a <br/>
month or so ago ds had our big magnet and was changing the colors on <br/>
his computer screen with it.  Dh told him that it might not be a <br/>
good idea,  and he hasn&#39;t done it since, but now I&#39;m wondering what <br/>
he could have done to it. ;)<br/>

It can mess up your screen. But I think it can also mess up the innards. My <br/>
Grandma got some magnets near our computer once and I started having some <br/>
serious problems with it.<br/>
