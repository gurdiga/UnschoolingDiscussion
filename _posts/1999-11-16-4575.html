<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852341994">Just wondering if anyone can give me some video titles which reflect political<br/>
ideologies.<br/>
(fascism, communism, etc.)(movies that might include Hitler or Mussolini)<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52545341">Hmm..This will be a fun list to watch build up...sticking to fascism and<br/>
communism:<br/>
<br/>
First of course, the one the only Leni Riefenstahl&#39;s &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;<br/>
(commissioned by Hitler, but more like fascist propaganda pretty much)<br/>
<br/>
Bertolucci&#39;s &quot;1900&quot; (one major storyline is the growth of the Italian<br/>
Fascist party--fascinating film)<br/>
<br/>
Visconti&#39;s &quot;The Damned&quot;--about a German family in the 30s<br/>
<br/>
from my husband:  Deutschland Bleiche Mutti (Germany, Pale Mother [or more<br/>
like Mommy]):  from the 70s; fascism and everyday life.  Heartwrenching.<br/>
&quot;Put a knife in your stomach and turn it would be a more pleasant<br/>
experience&quot; (a quote from my husband)<br/>
<br/>
A play comes to mind, too:  Heiner Muller&#39;s &quot;The Slaughter&quot; (very<br/>
complicated)<br/>
<br/>
Another play (even more complicated):  Fassbinder&#39;s &quot;Garbage, Death, and the<br/>
City&quot;<br/>
<br/>
An beautiful, thought-provoking short story: Peter Handke&#39;s story about his<br/>
mother and her blossoming during fascism<br/>
<br/>
My mind is clogging--so many others... Interesting kind of Trivial Pursuit<br/>
question! (in its own sick way:))<br/>
<br/>
Now if you really want to get into it, *every* work of art &quot;reflects&quot; a<br/>
political ideology, explicitly or implicitly...a la _Ways of Seeing_...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538103381">For a look at colonialism and capitalism I suggest &quot;Battle of Algiers&quot;.  It is<br/>
in French with English subtitles.  It was very effective in examining the French<br/>
involvement in North Africa.  Not for kids though imo though older or mature<br/>
teens might handle it okay.<br/>
<br/>
I think all films are propaganda to a certain extent which is an interesting<br/>
aspect to remember and is part of the viewing of them.  Does this film confirm<br/>
my prejudices or does it challenge them?  Whose interest does this film serve?<br/>
Who makes money off of this film?  Was it financially successful at the time it<br/>
was made.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of films which never make it in North America because they are<br/>
too radical in one way or another.  They challenge people around issues of<br/>
sexuality, morality, class issues.<br/>
<br/>
Most people do not like to have their bias perturbed. I think this is an<br/>
especially big problem for Americans.  Americans generally have no idea<br/>
whatsoever how insular, provincial, and parochial they are unless they travel or<br/>
are very widely read.<br/>
<br/>
There is a great book from a few years ago called the &quot;Closing of the American<br/>
Mind&quot;.  People in other countries have often been living cheek by jowl with such<br/>
a mix of people for so long that they are just generally more broad in their<br/>
views.  Of course there striking exceptions to this.<br/>
<br/>
Read the &quot;Enormous Room&quot; by e e cummings.  I am wandering off topic.  bye<br/>
