<div id="ygrps-yiv-629972406">I used to think that standardized meant those computer-graded tests with<br/>
your choice of the four little circles to be filled in with a no. 2 pencil.<br/>
<br/>
But I think it really just refers to the tests being given to a large<br/>
sample of test-takers, so that scores can be reported in terms of<br/>
percentiles. (Correct me if Im wrong.) Here in NYC, the new standardized<br/>
tests used in the public schools include writing short answers and essays.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We gave Wyndham the 1st grade Iowa when he was 7.  He could not read <br/>
much at all then, maybe sound out a three letter word occassionally <br/>
and he could just barely write his first name.  He still scored a <br/>
composite 27 - which here in Ohio is sufficient to use for the <br/>
assessment.  So for the early Iowa tests, I don&#39;t think it is a given <br/>
that a poor reader will &#39;fail&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
On another subject about the testing . . .<br/>
. . . I think people misuse or abuse them.  Some think they are a <br/>
true assessment of intelligence.  (I KNOW none of YOU would think <br/>
that!)  They aren&#39;t.  And to make matters worse, the way the schools <br/>
use them and administer them makes them even worse.  I remember in <br/>
grade school, I would always finish first or second in my class.  I <br/>
always tried to be really quiet and keep turning the pages every once <br/>
in a while because I didn&#39;t want the rest of the class to know I was <br/>
done.  But the other girl who was fast, used to make it very obvious <br/>
and act all condescending about it.  I remember even then, thinking <br/>
that it had to make the others nervous to know she was done and they <br/>
weren&#39;t.  I knew even then that some kids didn&#39;t test well, even <br/>
though they knew the material well.  My mom was tutoring a boy in my <br/>
class and he would know all the stuff in my house and when we got to <br/>
school he just could not produce it.  He nearly failed several <br/>
grades.  He owns a furniture store now and is very successful.<br/>
<br/>
My mom still tests mine every year.  But they think it is fun and <br/>
kind of a game.  They also know we aren&#39;t going to love them less if <br/>
they don&#39;t score well.  Rachel has even learned to look at how she <br/>
scored in different areas and use that to find what she wants to <br/>
study.  I don&#39;t think she picked up algebra from thin air!<br/>

Writing is heavily emphasized on all portions of the test. Even in <br/>
the math section the kids not only have to answer the question <br/>
correctly but then with many of the problems,explain how they got the <br/>
answer. From what other parents have told me, not only do they have <br/>
to be able to answer those kinds of questions in an acceptable form <br/>
(not every way of getting the math answers is acceptable, I&#39;ve been <br/>
told) but they have to answer them in cursive. From third grade on. <br/>
For sample test questions for the third grade look at:<br/>

The ones that say blueprint questions are the ones that have writing <br/>
as part of the answer. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406664414">Here in CA, certain grade&#39;s tests include a written essay where they are scored on several things, one of them being level of writing.  For example, if they are in 7th grade, was the writing at the &#39;level&#39; of a 7th grader? I never understood how they determined what the &#39;level&#39; of a 7th grader was supposed to be. Three scores are given, by administrators, and averaged out. If there are seriously differentiating scores, the child&#39;s score can really be skewed.<br/>
