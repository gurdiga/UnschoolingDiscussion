<div id="ygrps-yiv-81985681">No, Tia,  I didn&#39;t think Pam was saying that.  I have a neighbor who has<br/>
constipation problems that seem mostly related to control issues....however,<br/>
the food choices he is provided and an inclination toward constipation that<br/>
may be medical are part of it.<br/>
<br/>
I believe most medical conditions can be exacerbated by poor mental health<br/>
practices and/or excessive stress.<br/>
<br/>
And I try to avoid ALL,  ALWAYS,  and NEVER statements if I can......I<br/>
noticed Pam did, too.<br/>
<br/>
Constipation in children who were force potty trained is a common one --<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;often quite bad constipation, sometimes requiring (at that point) medical<br/>
&gt; &gt;intervention.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bladder infections in children in school denied the right to use the<br/>
&gt; &gt;bathroom as often as they need to.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Those are two that spring immediately to mind.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Pam<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;PLEASE NOTE that constipation and bladder infections are often precluded<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;medical conditions.....while attempting parental controls would certainly<br/>
&gt; &gt;aggravate this;  often the cause is medically related.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope you didn&#39;t think that Pam was saying that *all* childhood<br/>
&gt; constipation is caused by control, only that overly strict toilet training<br/>
&gt; *can* cause serious constipation.  Obviously there are a lot of reasons<br/>
