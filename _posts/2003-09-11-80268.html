Hi Shannon!<br/>
<br/>
 I went and looked at your photo album pictures and they turned out great! I<br/>
love all your added little captions, too. Then I saw the picture you took of<br/>
me and Bryan - I didn&#39;t even know you took that! I was too busy feeding my<br/>
face, but I guess Bryan noticed and even smiled for the pic. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing those pictures! Can&#39;t believe that was only a week ago.<br/>
It seems like it was at least a month ago, for some reason.<br/>

Glad you liked the pictures, Karin.  I was just trying to get impromptu<br/>
pictures at the park.  I was glad that Bryan smiled for me, tho.  I kwym<br/>
about the conference seeming so long ago.  I so wish Dave and Connor could<br/>
ve gone.  I end up saying that A LOT to Dave and he is getting really tired<br/>
of hearing it.  Lol  Maybe itll make him try a little harder next year to<br/>
go with me.  ;o)<br/>
