<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207909541">Whenever we&#39;re at a peaceful place with little noise, I always mention how it <br/>
must have seemed to the natives here before the Europeans brought guns and <br/>
such. St. Louis has Cahokia which is a magical place---and so beautiful. I&#39;ve <br/>
sat at the top of the biggest mound and just imagined what it could have <br/>
possibly been like to have NO cars or machinery or radios and such (easy to <br/>
do there!). How wonderful. And how terribly frightening to have suddenly had <br/>
horses and guns barreling down at you.<br/>
<br/>
How peaceful NOT to have clocks, but just the sun and the weather and the <br/>
seasons to dictate what gets done and when. Well, and I guess some powerful <br/>
leader! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love places like that. We stay at a tiny cabin in the mountains like <br/>
that---VERY rustic and peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
And y&#39;all can drop by here for afternoon tea ANYday! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the thing with the concept of &quot;time&quot; as we think of it. It&#39;s a <br/>
man-made construct. We can pay attention to it or not. In our house, my dh <br/>
is the one who has to respond to clock-time the most. The rest of us tend to <br/>
go on body rhythms, weather, health, etc. Except of course when Dragonball-Z <br/>
or Hamtarro is on. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
