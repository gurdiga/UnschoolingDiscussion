<br/>
I have some family members I just don&#39;t get.  I love them dearly but <br/>
they do really horrible things to thier kids.  My sister had her <br/>
first child, Chelsea when she was 14 years old.  My husband and I now <br/>
have custody of Chelsea and will soon adopt her.  My sister had her <br/>
second child Hannah 5 months ago.  They smoke in the house and Hannah <br/>
has had ear infections.  And this is better than what she did for <br/>
Chelsea.  My sister got soooo drunk when she still had custody of <br/>
Chelsea that she passed out and wouldn&#39;t wake up.  The only reason <br/>
why anyone knew that Chelsea (1 year old at the time) was alone <br/>
because she was screaming her head off..   she was trying to wake her <br/>
mommy up and she wouldn&#39;t!  On a softer note,  Chelsea is safely <br/>
tucked into bed in the next room. <br/>
<br/>
My mother in law is another family member that bugs me.  She has <br/>
offered to pay for preschool several times!  She wants me to have a <br/>
break.  I let them clearly know that we are unschoolers and she still <br/>
offers.   Where&#39;s the support...?<br/>
<br/>
It is soooo hard dealing with family members when it comes to the way <br/>
they treat thier kids.  YOu just want to snatch up thier babies and <br/>
take them home, but you can&#39;t.  We are a family of 4 on an income of <br/>
45 a year and yet my sister in law who&#39;s husband is a lawyer has to <br/>
plan her pregnancy around her work schedule........... work would <br/>
just kill her if she missed the busy season!  Needless to say they <br/>
don&#39;t plan on having kids any time soon.  We should be thankful.<br/>
<br/>
I was a public schooled child and daycared.  My mom and dad where <br/>
horribly neglectful so leaving them often was a good thing.  The <br/>
negative experiences have helped me to be a better mother.  Maybe her <br/>
kids will beable to turn the table around for themselves as well.<br/>

What if you told her how much you appreciate her wanting to help you and suggest something she could buy that your family would like to have?  Health club membership or netflix subscription or...<br/>
