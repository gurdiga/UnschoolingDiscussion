all the rest....with enough energy to keep it up? You<br/>
are amazing!<br/>

It seems to me, that with karate&#39;, though, it is its<br/>

it! Sort of like everything else :)<br/>

&gt; What do people here think about rewards systems for chores?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think rewards are a fine idea in training cats, and a bad idea in rearing<br/>
small human beings.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; We have a sort of two-tiered system. First is the &quot;work before play&quot;<br/>
&gt; system, in which a certain minimum amount of work is required before the<br/>
&gt; boys are allowed to play computer or video games. The second thing is that<br/>
&gt; we pay them for working -- we have a weekly &quot;chores chart&quot; that we tote up<br/>
&gt; at the end of each week -- the more work performed the more money they get.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I grew up under this system. It taught me to do the least amount of work I<br/>
could possibly get away with, no more, and never to voluntarily clean<br/>
ANYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; We do this not only to &quot;coerce&quot; them into working but to show them that<br/>
&gt; there is a relationship between doing work and enjoying the benefits of<br/>
&gt; having worked.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People who live with free choice and good examples tend to freely choose to<br/>
follow those good examples. People who are forced to submit to benign<br/>
dictatorship, by the withholding of Nintendo or the promise of<br/>
SpongeBobSquarePants, are acquiring life skills I&#39;d rather my children not<br/>
develop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-268989860">*       &lt;&lt;We have a sort of two-tiered system. First is the &quot;work before<br/>
play&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; system, in which a certain minimum amount of work is required before the<br/>
&gt; boys are allowed to play computer or video games. The second thing is that<br/>

&gt; at the end of each week -- the more work performed the more money they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>get.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever this system is, be sure that is certainly not Unschooling.<br/>
Unschooling does not seek to make a division between work and play - surely<br/>
you have heard the phrase &quot;play is the work of childhood&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would not describe this as two-tiered, but two different and possibly<br/>
competing ideas. For example what happens is your kids say &quot;We&#39;ll forgo the<br/>
extra money this week - how much time can we buy with those dollars on the<br/>
computer?&quot;  Do you then change the rules by refusing to allow them to do<br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
With system 1, you are training your children to live the way so many adults<br/>
have to live - work is &quot;negative&quot; boring, hard, tedious, to be escaped from<br/>
asap; play is &quot;positive&quot; fun, enjoyable, real challenges - separate and<br/>
definitely not equal. The good stuff is all in the future sometime. People<br/>
who have embraced unschooling are helping their children find their<br/>
passions, enjoy them today, and relish challenges as part of a full life.<br/>
There are so many lengthy threads about the value of &quot;de-limiting&quot; computer<br/>
and video game time that you could spend many hours reading and learning -<br/>
as long as someone doesn&#39;t come along and tell you that it is time you did<br/>
some work first! Most of us do not entertain the idea that these things are<br/>
a privilege, any more than warm clothes, a place to sleep, and enough food<br/>
are privileges.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
With system 2 - well the issue is still coercion. If you have some tasks<br/>
that you are responsible for, but really don&#39;t like, why not offer the kids<br/>
the opportunity to earn extra money by doing them? You could just as well be<br/>
offering the job to a neighbor&#39;s teen, or it would be as if your kids were<br/>
offered a job by someone outside of the immediate family. The key here is<br/>
the right of refusal. I would never tie refusing these job opportunities to<br/>
any kind of punishment - including wandering around with a resentment in<br/>
your heart and on your face.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We do this not only to &quot;coerce&quot; them into working but to show them that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there is a relationship between doing work and enjoying the benefits of<br/>
&gt; having worked.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why use quotation marks? This is not euphemistically coercion, this is the<br/>
real thing. Unschooling does not set up artificial situations with arbitrary<br/>
limitations, in order to demonstrate some principle or other. Unschooling<br/>
allows people to discover their best selves - and lets life take care of the<br/>
life-lessons. The first time your toddler struggled to complete a block<br/>
tower that stayed up, he learned about the joy of doing work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-364868597">I agree with the idea that rewards take away from the joy of a<br/>
job well done.  On the other hand, in my experience at least,<br/>
having a chart of available tasks that are worth money is not a<br/>
bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
I remember with fondness - and am told by the child now raised<br/>
he had a similar reaction to - the fact that the fridge had<br/>
pending infrequent chores that were worth money.  I always loved<br/>
cleaning the chandeliers in the house I grew up in.  I truly<br/>
loved doing it.  It was worth 3 dollars too - 6 weeks allowance<br/>
in 1962.  I loved it for itself and would do it whether or not<br/>
it was on the list as pending, but the minute it got up there, I<br/>
was a rich child.  Other tasks have been ones that might never<br/>
have occurred otherwise.  I had alphabetizing the biographies in<br/>
the library for $10 up for several weeks before $10 stood<br/>
between our son and some desired item.  He was free to earn that<br/>
money rather at home rather than try to find a way to earn it or<br/>
await birthday money (he could have just asked for the item, but<br/>
it was one that meant too much to him not to &quot;own it, including<br/>
the cost of it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between payment for honest work and reward for<br/>
doing the &quot;pretty much required&quot; makes the difference to me in<br/>
whether you are undermining the person&#39;s joy in their labor -<br/>
and it is worth looking at form both perspectives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Out of the ordinary money-making opportunities seem perfectly <br/>
reasonable to me. We have a home business, and both girls <br/>
know they can earn money by helping with shipping and some <br/>
other tasks. It&#39;s entirely up to them. They also receive a weekly <br/>
allowance (as do we all, adults included) just for being alive and <br/>
members of the household.<br/>
<br/>
Tying money earning into required chores feels icky to me.<br/>
<br/>
Tying money earning into commonplace household chores (10 <br/>
cents for wiping the table) is telling the child that simply <br/>
spontaneously helping out Mom and Dad in keeping up the <br/>
house makes little sense when they could get paid for it instead.<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning a chandelier? Not on the same page as vaccuuming <br/>
the living room, in my book. ;)<br/>
