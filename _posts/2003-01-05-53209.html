<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t *get it*. After reading these various books I thought  I<br/>
&gt; *got it*. But reading this list has me convinced that I don&#39;t. I<br/>
&gt; understood &quot;unschooling&quot; to be child-led, not child-controlled. I thought<br/>
&gt; that unschooling was a way to do away with the mainstream&#39;s way of<br/>
&gt; pigeonholing children into a particular set of standards and learning<br/>
&gt; methods, only to find out that there are the militant unschoolers that<br/>
&gt; say there is only one way of unschooling.  I thought unschooling involved<br/>
&gt; giving your children all the resources they need to accomplish what they<br/>
&gt; want, whether it be textbooks, videos, pots and pans, whatever. I guess<br/>
&gt; my question is, can bits and pieces of mainstream educational methods be<br/>
&gt; used, if at the leading of the child or the suggestion of the parent, and<br/>
&gt; this still come under the definition of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wende,<br/>
<br/>
First, welcome to the list.  I hope that you&#39;ll hang out for awhile; every<br/>
list has its off-days and this one&#39;s been tense lately, but there&#39;s still<br/>
good stuff here.  Lots of it.  Just delete, or scan fast on digest mode.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my opinion on unschooling your girls right now: you don&#39;t have to get<br/>
it.  You already have the patience to be a good unschooler -- you&#39;ve<br/>
confessed to a &quot;sporadic lifestyle&quot;.  I love that description!  You&#39;ve<br/>
probably been unschooling your children anyway -- letting them play,<br/>
explore, create, invent, and all that.  Taking trips, going on picnics (even<br/>
if they&#39;re only in the living room because it&#39;s too cold outside!), visiting<br/>
the library, reading books, watching videos, and enjoying each other.<br/>
<br/>
I think that everyone here agrees that each of our unschooling lives looks<br/>
different.  Even within families, different children are unschooling<br/>
differently.  Perhaps what comes across as only one way to unschool is the<br/>
point that the only way to unschool is by letting your children have the<br/>
control over their education ALL the time.  They&#39;re saying that you can&#39;t<br/>
unschool *except* for math, or just during vacations; you can&#39;t unschool<br/>
after the lessons are done, or on even-numbered days or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s what originally came across as radical to me, but later fell into<br/>
place.  After you&#39;ve been giving your children control over their education,<br/>
which is really control over how they spend their time, perhaps you&#39;ll start<br/>
looking at the other places you exert control in their lives.  I grew from<br/>
wanting to unschool with a math curriculum (not really possible to do, but I<br/>
was trying!) to letting go of the whole curriculum idea, to letting go of<br/>
restrictions on tv/video time, restrictions on foods, etc.  But it takes<br/>
TIME to get there for a lot of us.  (And you may strongly defend some<br/>
cherished ideas on the way.  I&#39;m still slightly chargrinned over some of my<br/>
posts 8 or 9 months ago before I let go of more control areas!)<br/>
<br/>
Do I use textbooks, workbooks, chalkboards, and the other acoutrements of<br/>
school in my unschooling?  Yep.  I myself got a lot out of a very nice math<br/>
education textbook last year.  Very interesting.  My son has a couple of<br/>
workbooks he used last month a few times, I think.  And boy, we love<br/>
chalkboards.  Great for coloring on when the sidewalks are all wet.  My<br/>
point is that anything is fair game, it&#39;s just about being willing to see it<br/>
used in any way.  And not requiring anyone to use it in one particular way<br/>
or at any particular time.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help?  I really think &quot;getting it&quot; has the most to do with &quot;living<br/>
it&quot; than &quot;thinking it&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399468254">Wow! Thanks everyone for your input. As as I said in my intro, we live a<br/>
sporadic lifestyle, which sometimes includes not getting a chance to<br/>
retrieve mail until 3:00am. <br/>
There is a lot here to read and digest. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more questions<br/>
in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again,<br/>

&lt;&lt;  But I have to admit, I do<br/>
 cringe when my 3yo takes a brand new workbook and colors pictures all<br/>
 over it. I literally have to turn my back, but I don&#39;t stop her. But I<br/>
 can&#39;t stop from feeling it&#39;s a waste, and not &quot;proper use&quot;. Is there any<br/>
 hope for me??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HOPE?? HOPE??<br/>
Oh my gosh YES!! I think you are ultra fabulous for being able to have those <br/>
feelings and turn your back to let her use it in her own way.<br/>
Good job.<br/>
