<div id="ygrps-yiv-974325373">The intent is to get people to reconsider their priorities.  It&#39;s not<br/>
against shopping, stores, or gifts.  It&#39;s against overconsumption.  It&#39;s<br/>
against spending too much time in material pursuits and not enough with<br/>
children or other loved ones.  It&#39;s against losing sight of deeper values as<br/>
a result of too much energy spent chasing after the ephemeral.<br/>
<br/>
As it says on the World Buy Nothing Day website<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ecoplan.org/ibnd/ib_index.htm)">http://www.ecoplan.org/ibnd/ib_index.htm)</a>, it&#39;s &quot;the one day a year we turn<br/>
off the economy and talk about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all.<br/>

&gt; In a message dated 00-11-25 15:01:50 EST, you write:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; but I feel it might be more of a crusade to protest something of<br/>
&gt; value instead of one shopping day a year:-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That fateful biggest-shopping-day, I bought cloth for Holly&#39;s girlscout<br/>
&gt; uniform, and I went to a Salvation Army thriftstore which was having a<br/>
&gt; $1-per-garment sale.   Both sales were on because it was the Thursday<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving.  Had I needed or wanted to go to one of the malls in which<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been shopping since I was a teenager (and that was the 1960&#39;s/70&#39;s) I<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; have been pretty miffed if I&#39;d had to face people yelling at me about<br/>
&gt; ANYTHING.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Christmas gift-giving is one of my best things.  My siblings and cousins<br/>
used<br/>
&gt; to call me &quot;Sandra Claus&quot; even when we were kids because I could do<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; cool without a bunch of money.  It&#39;s one of my few creative talents.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; fallen down some with being older and having other things to think about,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; shopping sales is a very good thing to do.  It would be &quot;better&quot; (not good<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; all) to protest those who wait until December 23 or 24, but some of them<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; so because they have no days off earlier, or no money earlier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yesterday I split little matching (matching length) cedar sticks to dip in<br/>
&gt; wax to bundle to give to friends as fire-starters.  I&#39;ll pack them in<br/>
little<br/>
&gt; baskets (thrift store, garage sale, things gifts were given to me<br/>
in--they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; all out in the garage, and I&#39;ll just dig through for some good sizes) and<br/>
&gt; stick a bow on them and maybe put a little bag of cookies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I did go shopping Thursday, and I&#39;m not evil nor stupidly mesmerized<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; advertising.<br/>
