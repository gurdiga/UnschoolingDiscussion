<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537633338">Thanks Jennifer!  Your trip sounds like it was a blast, makes me wish I&#39;d<br/>
have gone with you!  I suppose we should start planning as if we are going<br/>
by ourselves and hubby can tag along if he&#39;s able.  :)  Like the mini desks<br/>
idea..<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Thank you Barb, my biggest thing is that I&#39;m just plain scared to drive <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;4 kids all by myself<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well if it makes you feel any better...I&#39;ve travelled all over the place <br/>
with<br/>
just the kids and I.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to add that traveling with the kids can be so much fun if <br/>
planned right.  The kids and I, I had 5 at the time) drove from Texas to <br/>
Alaska and we had a ball!  We had lots of drawing and coloring supplies with<br/>
<br/>
small lap desks for each of the kids.  I packed loads of easy, not too <br/>
messy, snacks and drinks, small toys, etc.  We sang a lot, made lots of <br/>
pitstops at parks and interesting places.  Probably the best thing I had was<br/>
<br/>
the TV and VR.  Ours is built into our conversion van but you can buy cables<br/>
<br/>
to convert the power and hook up a small one from home.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, plan lots of extra goof time.  Getting out and walking around <br/>
made the trip a pleasure.  I made sure to point out lots of scenery, natural<br/>
<br/>
and otherwise, to the kids so we had lots of great talks on the way there.<br/>
<br/>
You can do it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
