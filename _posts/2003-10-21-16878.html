<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803076964">Just a vent here.<br/>
<br/>
Today I was helping students out, walking around.  Behind one of my <br/>
favorite students was a small gun.  It looked real.  But it was on a <br/>
keychain and was, I think, too small to be real.  I picked it up and <br/>
asked him about it.  Our school has a policy, kids get expelled with <br/>
even fake or toy guns.  I had just reached this kid.  He has a high <br/>
reading level, high school (this is 6th grade), but I can tell he&#39;s <br/>
always been a trouble maker... Finally in my class and in other classes <br/>
he&#39;s been doing well.  This started about two weeks ago when I told him <br/>
he had the highest reading score in both my classes (true) andthat he <br/>
was college material (also true) but that he needed to stop playing <br/>
silly games and get to work.  He did.  FOr the last two weeks he has <br/>
turned all his homework in, gotten &quot;A&#39;s on his tests, etc.  And now <br/>
this, a gun.  He told me it was a cap gun, which is even worse than just <br/>
a toy gun.  It was likely he would be expelled.  This was not going to <br/>
be pretty.<br/>
<br/>
I called the guy in charge of this and he sent one of his people over, <br/>
Earl, whom I really like. I  spoke with him in detail, explaining how <br/>
this kid really needed a chance.  He decided to let me handle it, after <br/>
he scared the hell out of this kid.  So the kid gets off with just a <br/>
really stern warning, he is so grateful to me, it&#39;s almost sad.  But <br/>
really  I think this will be the final kick in the seat thiskid needs.  <br/>
I used to think anyone could homeschool.  I don&#39;t believe that anymore.  <br/>
Most (not all,only most) of the parents of the kids I have cannot <br/>
homeschool. I think it&#39;s sad, but true.<br/>
<br/>
The other day in staff meeting we were looking at some expert&#39;s 9 relms <br/>
of education, with the last one being responsibility or something, where <br/>
the kid is responsible for their own education, for life long learning.  <br/>
I somehow ended up &quot;defining&quot; that part of education and man was it <br/>
easy.  Students not only can be but should be responsible for their own <br/>
education, for their own learning, and that they can assess themselves <br/>
for their level of understanding, and that the primary responsibility <br/>
for education should fall upon the students and not the teachers or <br/>
parents, and that all goals should reach toward life long learning.  No <br/>
brainer for folks here, but I doubt anyone in the room got it, as they <br/>
areso into the idea that kids have to be TAUGHT. <br/>
ok, vent over...<br/>
<br/>
I do love teaching, I love the kids and I think for some I am making a <br/>
difference, however slight.  There are these boys who have always gotten <br/>
away with being cute and shuffling and not doing anything, and I&#39;m <br/>
pushing them to figure out how to play the system, becuase ultimately <br/>
that is their way out. <br/>
<br/>
The other day I had a thought...I&#39;m not teaching these kids for them, <br/>
I&#39;m teaching these kids for their children.  If I can instill a love of <br/>
learning and a desire to go to college and get out of the ghetto then <br/>
maybe these children will homeschool their own children.  maybe?<br/>
