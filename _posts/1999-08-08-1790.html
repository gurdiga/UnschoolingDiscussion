&gt; Hi, Michele.  :-)  That was the one search engine I didn&#39;t use. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  there&#39;s so many of them out there anymore it gets overwhelming.  I <br/>
seem to keep coming back to northernlight.  I never can find anything <br/>
i&#39;m looking for at the big &quot;Y&quot; anymore.  I really like the way <br/>
northernlight organizes the results and their power search is awesome <br/>
for narrowing your search.<br/>
<br/>
  i recently found a great kid&#39;s search engine too.  I use it a lot <br/>
when i&#39;m looking for kid&#39;s stuff cuz i don&#39;t get all the irrelevant <br/>
results i would normally get in regular search engines.  it is <br/>

&gt;  have you tried the search engine <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northernlight.com">http://www.northernlight.com</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   i did a quick search for keywords homeschooling guam and the top<br/>
&gt; result is a site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heptune.com">http://www.heptune.com</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   their homeschooling FAQ page is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heptune.com/school.html">http://www.heptune.com/school.html</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   which also leads to their email address:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:heptune@...">heptune@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a start but they might have a list of support groups or other<br/>
&gt; contacts to share!  you might want to poke around some more at<br/>
&gt; northernlights too.  good luck!<br/>
