<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033263223">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sherri and I home educate my 10 y/o dd.  She has never been to a <br/>
ps and has never expressed the desire to give it a try.  Thank heaven.  I have a <br/>
15y/o ds who happens to attend ps because he lives with his Dad.  I wish I could<br/>
change that but his Dad is dead set against &quot;homeschooling&quot; because it will not<br/>
give a child the education that ps does.  HA HA!!!<br/>
 I recently quit my job to be at home full time.  This is a scary experience.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure that we can financially survive on just one income.  I have been searching on the net<br/>
for a legitimate work from home opportunity but I&#39;m leary of most everything I find.<br/>
Does anyone out there know of something that I could check out?  Any suggestions<br/>
would be greatly appreciated.  By the way, I live in Louisville, Ky.<br/>

There are many companies that you can work for independantly. I am a distrubutor for Pampered Chef and Longaberger. I am able to work from home - but do home parties about once a week - and an occasional fair. Check out this website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thewahmconnection.com/">http://www.thewahmconnection.com/</a> - it gives different ideas about work at home opporuntities. Whatever you do, there is no easy get rich quick way :) Mostly it is finding something you are good at - and finding a way to market yourself...<br/>
