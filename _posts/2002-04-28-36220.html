I would say that unschoolers are more likely to be less coercive than<br/>
non-unschoolers and many discussion revolve around ways to approach specific<br/>
kid situations that come up without or with less coercion, but the only<br/>
noncoercion that is part of unschooling is not coercing academic learning.<br/>

<br/>
I disagree. Unschooling is about living life. Many unschoolers will say, &quot;it&#39;s a way of life&quot;. There should be not be coercion at all, because then you stifle learning.<br/>

children are learning at all times.  They spend all their time solving<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oh?  What happened?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We could never really get past the idea that coercion was &quot;damaging&quot; to<br/>
children. And what exactly constituted damage.<br/>
<br/>
There was another term the TCSers were using that was a lightbulb moment for<br/>
me that they had redifined certain words and weren&#39;t using them in the<br/>
standard way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t differentiate between &quot;academic&quot; and other learning; all<br/>
&gt; types are equally important.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither do I. I don&#39;t believe I need to force my daughter to be polite or do<br/>
chores (just to name a few) in order to learn those skills. She will learn<br/>
those from life and adults modeling the behavior. She will learn respect by<br/>
me respecting her (and me respecting me too!)<br/>
<br/>
I try to treat her in situations that seem to call for coercion in the same<br/>
way I would an adult. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve damaged (in the standard or TCS<br/>
definition) my husband or our relationship the few times I&#39;ve had to give up<br/>
on explanations and just say, &quot;Look, let&#39;s just do it my way and then you&#39;ll<br/>
see what I mean.&quot; (That&#39;s a huge responsibility and I&#39;m putting his trust in<br/>
me at stake so I&#39;d better be right! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t see how a parent could do a very good job of letting a<br/>
&gt; child learn when ey routinely uses force to enforce eir whims on child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think it will be *very* *VERY* helpful before you begin debating this<br/>
to wait for a while to see how some of us express our ideas on coercion in<br/>
discussions we have with more coercive parents. *Don&#39;t* make assumptions.<br/>
(And it helps to keep the discussion civil if we inflamatory language like<br/>
&quot;enforce their whims on a child&quot;. If you want to talk about one person<br/>
forcing their agenda on another, let&#39;s. But if you call them whims I suspect<br/>
you&#39;ll get more rancor than enlightenment.) I think you will find that the<br/>
way of thinking some of us suggest is pretty indistinguishable from TCS. (I<br/>
can do a darn good argument why it isn&#39;t right to force chores on kids.)<br/>
<br/>
(That doesn&#39;t, of course, apply to all unschoolers. More coercive<br/>
unschoolers may even be the majority. Who knows? But few will bring up ways<br/>
of coercing kids to do nonacademic things because it will always lead to a<br/>
debate about why coercion isn&#39;t necessary. So you may not be able to start<br/>
up a coercion vs noncoercion debate, just a less coercion vs noncoercion<br/>
debate.)<br/>
<br/>
I think the difference will be in the extent to which those of us who argue<br/>
less coercive methods avoid coercion. Though I keep noncoercion as my goal<br/>
in my dealings with my daughter, I don&#39;t believe that everytime I&#39;ve ended<br/>
up coercing her because I wasn&#39;t clever enough or didn&#39;t plan enough that<br/>
I&#39;ve damaged her.<br/>

Force and unschooling seem like opposites to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They can be.  Force and coercion aren&#39;t equal.  And the TCS <br/>
particular-definition of &quot;coercion&quot; goes beyond what it is generally believed <br/>
to be, and purposely so, for rhetorical purposes.  So the debate is close to <br/>
the surface. <br/>
<br/>
One seeming-central aspect of the TCS belief is not telling stories about <br/>
exactly what happens and how it works, so occasionally someone used to come <br/>
to AOL or www.unschooling.com and say those who talked about their children <br/>
were being disrespectful of them. And if you asked the TCS proponent(s) to <br/>
explain more closely how it actually works at their house, the request was <br/>
denied.  All the stories were theory without examples.<br/>

<br/>
Once someone accepts that academics can be learned without being forced,<br/>
then for some the obvious next question is can&#39;t they learn everything<br/>
without being forced to?<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s an extension of unschooling. For some it&#39;s integral. But for the<br/>
purposes of this list, it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t discuss why someone feels it&#39;s necessary to<br/>
enforce chores and politeness and sticking out agreements to be on a team! I<br/>
think it&#39;s a natural and healthy mind stretch for those thinking about<br/>
unschooling. (If they want to participate.) But it isn&#39;t part of the<br/>
definition of unschooling.<br/>

about Cacie and mention her by name (and this was when everyone else<br/>
would tell actual stories about their kids, but use a different name, and<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the name... Fred? something like that). I had asked her<br/>
if it was okay, and she said it was, and that was that. Everything seemed<br/>
a lot more *real* back then, I knew who the people were, and who their<br/>
kids were, and who didn&#39;t have kids... it was a lot of fun, and I still<br/>
think the underlying theory, as a philosophical theory, is sound. Some of<br/>
the main posters were, of course, nuts, and at the big TCS get-together a<br/>
few years back it became pretty clear which those were...<br/>
<br/>
I resubbed a couple of years ago and my first post was censored because<br/>
the moderator thought I was not disguising my child&#39;s identity enough...<br/>
they had changed the FAQ to disallow the use of children&#39;s names even<br/>
when the children had given permission. The funny thing was that the post<br/>
wasn&#39;t even about my child at all, but about another child.<br/>

be &quot;taught&quot; &quot;lessons&quot; about respecting others, treating others well, and just <br/>
being generally all-around good chaps and chappettes.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the answer is yes.<br/>
<br/>
It appears to me, based upon the way &quot;Olivia&quot; is supposed to rear &quot;Ben,&quot; that <br/>
&quot;Olivia&quot; might disagree with me.  (Which is, of course, somewhat bizarre in <br/>
the light of the fact that Olivia does not even exist!!).<br/>

<br/>
TCS isn&#39;t &quot;hands off&quot; parenting Ren. A TCS parent is a trusted advisor. Just like when you offer ideas for fun things to do during the day, you would offer things for any situation.  <br/>

<br/>
Do you teach math? Do you teach history? science? etc... then what do you do? You offer your best theories but in the end it is up to that person to decide.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have to teach math, history, whatever why do you have to teach anything else? Would you just continue along the lines of offering your best theories?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What?  TCS advocates parents as advisors not enforcers.  The solution to<br/>
most problems it to communicate more information to the child.  We&#39;re<br/>
constantly criticised because &quot;children can&#39;t understand advice&quot; and now we<br/>
get the reverse?  Reminds me of when someone called me a communist.<br/>

should give advice, but let child decide if ey agrees or not.  Teaching<br/>
means parents has a specific concept of how children should be, and forces<br/>
it on the child, instead of letting child decide how to be.</div>

won&#39;t *learn*.  And there are many ways to learn something beisdes<br/>
actually doing a rude, dangerous, unkind, or otherwise inadvised thing. <br/>
Children can learn through watching other people (social learning is the<br/>
technical term), through reading, through asking questions, through<br/>
watching tv, through figuring out for themselves what would be best... a<br/>
million ways!<br/>
<br/>
And, the part of TCS theory which always seems to be ignored is the<br/>
&quot;sharing your best theories&quot; piece. If I see that my child is, say<br/>
refusing to share her sand toys with a group of kids at the park, and I<br/>
believe that this behavior is not going to get her the results that she<br/>
really wants (i.e., friends), then according to TCS, I *must* explain to<br/>
her what I&#39;m seeing, and what I think the result will be,and why, and I<br/>
must continue to dialogue with her about this until one of us rationally<br/>
convinces the other (or until she doesn&#39;t want to talk about it anymore,<br/>
in which case the TCS parent would shut up but remain nearby).She may<br/>
convince me (&quot;I want to play by myself anyway, and these kids borrowed<br/>
someone else&#39;s sand toys last week and threw them over the fence.&quot; ) or I<br/>
may convince her, or we may come up with one of the famous Mutually<br/>
Agreeable Solutions, like offering some not-very-valuable sand toys for<br/>
open play, which not sharing the prized Dragon Shovel Set.<br/>

How about talking to Ben about nutrition, maybe pointing out how he feels<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, please forgive me if I laugh.  This subject just seems to tickle me in <br/>
all the right places.<br/>
<br/>
Second, let&#39;s look at this post (and by parsing the statements in the post, I <br/>
mean no disrespect to the poster emself (or is that erself) -- I really don&#39;t <br/>
know).<br/>
<br/>
A statement is made that &quot;Parenting is controlling child&#39;s ice cream intake, <br/>
making choices for the child, on the false assumption that parent is <br/>
infallible.&quot;  Partly true, but mostly false.  I know that I, for one, do not <br/>
believe that I, or any parent, is infallible.  Nor do I believe a child is <br/>
infallible.  I agree, however, that the parenting decision in this situation <br/>
does, indeed, control the child&#39;s ice cream intake and &quot;make choices for the <br/>
child.&quot;  I am comfortable with that fact.  I am 34.  Ben is 3.  I might not <br/>
be infallible, but my guess is that, when it comes to making nutrition and <br/>
dietary calls, I am less fallible than is he.<br/>
<br/>
A question is asked &quot;Do you really want to have to tell your child NO all the <br/>
time?&quot;  Um, no.  I believe I clearly stated in the original post that only <br/>
sometimes do I say no to this bit of impulsiveness on Ben&#39;s &lt;g&gt; part.  <br/>
However, if Ben wanted to go out and kill the neighbor&#39;s puppies every day &lt;<br/>
egads&gt; then yes, I would really want to have to tell him NO each and every <br/>
time he wanted to do that.  (And I would also want to get him some serious <br/>
outside counseling . . . but, fortunately, my little Ben doesn&#39;t want to kill <br/>
the neighbors&#39; puppies . . . . or, at least, he doesn&#39;t that I know of.)<br/>
<br/>
The statement is made &quot;If Olivia lets Ben have ice cream whenever he wants, <br/>
the novelty will soon wear off, and Olivia will find that Ben eats pretty <br/>
much normally and healthily by choice.&quot;  LOL.  Personally, my little Ben <br/>
doesn&#39;t want ice cream for the novelty of it.  He wants it because it&#39;s just <br/>
so darn yummy.  (I know this, because he told me so.)  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Finally, and just for the record, I do not &quot;systematically&quot; deny little <br/>
Benjamin &lt;g&gt; the ice cream he so desires.  It&#39;s just that sometimes, and for <br/>
my own reasons (whether they be fallible, infallible, rational, or not) I&#39;d <br/>
prefer that the family eat pancakes for breakfast.  (And, yes, sometimes <br/>
little Ben gets his with a side of ice cream, and sometimes he does not.)<br/>

<br/>
First, Ben is 3.  He yells and screams even when people don&#39;t tell him what <br/>
to do.  Heck, he yells and screams even when he *gets* to eat the ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
Second, do you *really* yell and scream when people tell you what to do?  I <br/>
do sometimes, but judges tend not to like lawyers who do that habitually, so <br/>
I try to curb the screaming part.  <br/>
<br/>
Third, Ben is drinking a Dr. Pepper right now, and &quot;Sue&quot; is eating a <br/>
cardboard Dora dominoe.  Nutrition does not seem to be the driving force in <br/>
this house at this particular time.  Maybe *I* should look more into the <br/>
subject of nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I cannot believe I am engaging in conversation on this subject.  I <br/>
thought very seriously about deleting this entire post before sending it, but <br/>
then decided that it was worth sending, if for no other purpose then for its <br/>
entertainment value.  (Forgive me, please, if you are not entertained.  I was <br/>
very much entertained by the writing of it.)  And, again, I mean no <br/>
disrespect whatsoever to any of the individual posters on this subject.  I <br/>
just happen to find the subject itself a most absurd little bird.<br/>
