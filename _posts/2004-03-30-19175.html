<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965666783">This is from a mom on the message boards. I know there is a mom here who also <br/>
lost a husband recently ---about a year ago?---with two small children, a boy <br/>
and a girl. I&#39;m SO sorry I can&#39;t remember your name or e-mail. But I thought <br/>
I&#39;d post her plea here. I also suggested that she come here. You can click on <br/>
her name on the message boards: <br/>

My husband died one month ago, and I go to work in two weeks. Basically, I&#39;m <br/>
feeling pretty miserable, and it&#39;s only natural-but it&#39;s not just my dh&#39;s <br/>
death that is wearing on me. It&#39;s the fact that my family&#39;s way of life is being <br/>
threatened. Family-they love me-but they have no faith in me whatsoever it <br/>
seems like. Only if I say that dh and I had made such and such decision before he <br/>
died is my opinion respected. I&#39;m really starting to get pissed off about it. <br/>
<br/>
I think you will all be pleased and maybe even proud to know I&#39;m standing <br/>
firm on the unschooling/homeschooling choice we made years ago. I gave my parents <br/>
a piece of my mind when they began to push too hard. There are other family <br/>
members who are watching closely and speculating openly. I wish they&#39;d shut the <br/>
hell up. <br/>
<br/>
I know single parents homeschool, I just don&#39;t know any who do. Are you out <br/>
there? This a new path I&#39;m treading, a new role-widow, single, career mom and I <br/>
don&#39;t want to lose that old, comfy role of homeschooler. References, <br/>
resources, anecdotes, opinions...all are welcome. <br/>
