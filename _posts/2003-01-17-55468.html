<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This brings a thought to my mind. I have noticed that the teachers I<br/>
&gt; know, both personally and casually, who defend the public school system<br/>
&gt; to what seems their death, all send their children to private schools.<br/>
&gt; What they claim is appropriate for the general populous, just isn&#39;t right<br/>
&gt; for their own children. Their loyalty to the school system always ends<br/>
&gt; with their own children. Are they just lying to themselves trying to<br/>
&gt; justify their positions? Just an observation and me pondering again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One item of thought here is that  PS teachers have invested<br/>
a lot of time and money to get their education, and have a hard<br/>
time understanding the concept of parents wanting to homeschool<br/>
their children without any teaching degree&#39;s. Especially myself, <br/>
homeschooling an LD student. The unsaid word I have come <br/>
to know very well is un-qualified.<br/>
<br/>
How is it than that we have alot fo teachers on the unschooling<br/>
list , how did they get here? I would be interested to hear their<br/>
thoughts, and what would their responses would be to being<br/>
questioned about homeschooing.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if there are any or many currently-employed-as-teachers people <br/>
here.  Might be some.<br/>
<br/>
It was fairly common where I grew up for teachers to have their kids in the <br/>
parochial school.  A very Catholic town, it was.  But that ended after 8th <br/>
grade.    <br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine was in private school, but when his dad wanted to be <br/>
superintendent, he put him in the regular school.  Cool for me, because we&#39;re <br/>
still friends about fifty or a hundred years later.  But his best friends at <br/>
the time were going to McCurdy (a protestant mission school in Santa Cruz, <br/>
New Mexico) and he couldn&#39;t go there because the school board wouldn&#39;t think <br/>
his dad was being supportive of the public schools.<br/>
