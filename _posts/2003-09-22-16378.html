<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777482227">Holly wasn&#39;t watching the Emmy awards, she was reorganizing Barbieland with <br/>
her friend Kristie.   I was watching, though, and in the tribute to those <br/>
who&#39;ve passed away in the past year, three people who&#39;ve figured in Holly&#39;s <br/>
TV/movie-viewing life were named:<br/>
<br/>
Lynne Thigpen, of Godspell and  Carmen Sandiego <br/>
<br/>
Michael Jeter, Mr. Noodle&#39;s brother, a naked draftee on Hair, and The Green <br/>
Mile<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Rogers<br/>
<br/>
I know the first two did lots more things, but those are what Holly <br/>
associates them with.<br/>
Victor Garber was one of the presenters.  He played Jesus in the movie of <br/>
Godspell, too.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wasn&#39;t watching it, but a lot of it was reminding me of Holly and all <br/>
the joy, ideas, songs and discussions that have come from her interest in those <br/>
programs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207592943">Lynne Thigpen is dead?! This is such a loss.  (She did a soap opera, <br/>
I think, and some Broadway work and wasn&#39;t she the voice for Luna on <br/>
Bear in the Big Blue House?)<br/>

*******<br/>
I was shocked to see Lynne Thigpen in that group....I had no idea she had died.<br/>
<br/>
And didn&#39;t Michael Jeter actually play Mr. Noodle...for at least a couple of years?  We (my boys and I) would always yell &quot;Mr. Noodle!&quot; whenever we would see him in anything else....Jurassic Park, Green Mile, Patch Adams, etc.   Mr. Noodle was actually the only part of SS that my kids liked..lol.<br/>
<br/>
So sad to see so many wonderful people gone...but what amazing contributions they made while they were here!<br/>

I didn&#39;t know that either had passed away!  Godspell was a huge part of my<br/>
early adulthood, knew the soundtrack by heart and saw the film so many times<br/>
that I lost count.  My introduction to Michael Jeter was &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, he<br/>
was the reason I watched the show at all.<br/>

Absolutely horrified.  I could not imagine if I had been a small child <br/>
or even medium child who LOVED Mr. Noodle and then to watch him be <br/>
killed in such a way, it was not a good thing.  He never should have <br/>
been allowed to play such a part, he should only be Mr. Noodle.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I realize this is unreasonable, but.  ;-)  :-/<br/>
