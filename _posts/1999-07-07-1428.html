<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883690834">Raising Individuals in a Team Player Society<br/>
By John O. Andersen<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	As a parent, I&#39;m concerned about our society&#39;s unqualified acceptance of<br/>
the team player ethos.  Yes, I support the need for cooperation, and<br/>
recognize  that team play can be a good thing.  However, if carried too far<br/>
(as I believe our culture is doing), the team player mentality can damage<br/>
individualism--the basis of a meaningful life.  So in raising our two<br/>
children, my spouse and I are taking steps to protect them from the barrage<br/>
of team player messages which seem to come from every direction.<br/>
<br/>
	It would be easy to make the case that in spite of claims to the contrary,<br/>
our culture is becoming increasingly homogeneous.  Too many people are<br/>
following the same life script: get the dream house, take surf &#39;n&#39; sand or<br/>
amusement park vacations, send the kiddies to college, learn &quot;new&quot; ideas<br/>
from bestseller self-help books, or daytime talk shows, etc., etc.  It&#39;s<br/>
not that those things are bad.  Rather, it&#39;s the zombie-like way so many<br/>
people are marching through life on intellectual autopilot apparently<br/>
content that all of the important thinking has already been done for them.<br/>
<br/>
	Human beings are capable of far more than just a life of jumping from one<br/>
bandwagon to the next.  Achieving personal authenticity is critical in<br/>
human development.  Choosing to follow a one-size-fits-all lifestyle does<br/>
not lead to authenticity.  It leads to blandness and boredom.<br/>
<br/>
	To help our two children grow up to be real people rather than carbon-copy<br/>
team players, we try to demonstrate the joy of thinking and acting<br/>
independently, and expose them to as much diversity as possible.  We hope<br/>
this will help them develop eclectic tastes, and subsequently give them the<br/>
strength to not spend their lives as unimaginative conformists. <br/>
Specifically, here are some of the countercultural ideas we are teaching<br/>
them:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Questioning of competition<br/>
<br/>
	While competition can be fun, we as a family have found many other<br/>
pastimes which are more satisfying.  Whether it be building play forts,<br/>
finger-painting, sculpting, cartoon drawing, genealogical research, museum<br/>
visits, family camping trips, or just writing, we all have hobbies which<br/>
fully engage us and have little or no link to competition.<br/>
<br/>
	Competition has a place in a market-driven economy, but we dispute that it<br/>
has any constructive purpose in our personal and family life.  We believe<br/>
our &quot;duty&quot; to compete is limited to the small carpet cleaning company which<br/>
I own and operate.  I compete by offering a professional service at a<br/>
reasonable price.  Beyond that,  we feel that competition is more often<br/>
than not, a distraction from the more satisfying things we like to do.  So,<br/>
we avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	<br/>
Goal setting not necessary<br/>
<br/>
	We teach our children to listen to their heart when choosing their<br/>
interests.  The objective is to align their lives with the activities for<br/>
which they have a passion and love.  This doesn&#39;t mean to run away from<br/>
unpleasant or difficult tasks, but rather to shun those things which induce<br/>
them to put on a phony face, or otherwise behave inauthentically.<br/>
<br/>
	Too often, people use goal setting as a way to rationalize greed or<br/>
dishonesty.  For instance, a salesperson who wants to earn enough money in<br/>
order to afford a dream home, may use that goal to distract his mind from<br/>
the twinges of guilt he feels when he manipulates customer behavior through<br/>
half-truths or flattery.   <br/>
<br/>
	We hope to show our children that they don&#39;t need to compromise their<br/>
ethics, or use goals as hallucinogenic drugs, to get them to do or say<br/>
things which contradict their personal ethics.  Rather, we teach them that<br/>
if they align their choices with their heart and passion, they will have<br/>
very little need for goals.   Their passion for life will be all they need<br/>
to drive them on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Living at high speed is living on the cheap<br/>
<br/>
	We believe that always being &quot;on the go&quot; stifles individualism and<br/>
creativity.  True, such a life can be exciting, but it takes a heavy toll<br/>
on those quiet moments so necessary for thinking, and mental regrouping.<br/>
<br/>
	During one 18 month period I lived in a 200+ year old cottage in a small<br/>
village in rural Oxfordshire, England.  My favorite pastime back then was<br/>
to spend evenings and weekends strolling through the village and across the<br/>
surrounding farms to the neighboring villages.  There was an ancient Roman<br/>
villa in the area which had an unusually well-preserved mosaic tile floor. <br/>
There were old barns still functional after centuries of use.  There were<br/>
small shops and picturesque village greens.  <br/>
<br/>
	Leisurely country walks to such places filled many of my hours.  Those<br/>
walks helped me to learn about rural England and gave me many hours to just<br/>
think about life in general.  Had I spent my leisure time with fellow<br/>
Americans on the base, attending meetings, sporting events, shopping for<br/>
knickknacks, or just hanging out at the Base Exchange (the closest<br/>
equivalent to the mall), I would have had fewer of those walks.<br/>
<br/>
	These days, we as a family carefully scrutinize our outside time<br/>
commitments.  We&#39;ve already figured out what brings us the greatest joy:<br/>
time together, time for creativity, time for unstructured play.  So we are<br/>
vigilant against anything which may subtract from that most precious time.<br/>
<br/>
	Our hope is that we&#39;re instilling in our children a love of solitude, of<br/>
space between activities, of preserving a not insignificant chunk of each<br/>
day for relaxation.  Hopefully this love will stay with them as they grow<br/>
up and be more important to them than being part of the crowd which is<br/>
chronically busy. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Money is just one of many types of wealth<br/>
<br/>
	There&#39;s no escaping the fact that we must concern ourselves with money. <br/>
However, we hope to convey to our children that money is just one form of<br/>
wealth and in many ways inferior to the other forms they might pursue.  <br/>
<br/>
	We see wealth opportunities all around us.   A person, for instance, could<br/>
devote a lot energy to cultivating her brain to the point where it is<br/>
overflowing with original ideas.  Others would recognize this and consider<br/>
it a privilege just to talk with such a person.  <br/>
<br/>
	Is knowing the names of all of the plants in your region, recognizing<br/>
subtle weather phenomena, or understanding animal behavior another type of<br/>
wealth?  I like to think so.  Brain wealth is the sort which travels well,<br/>
opens doors to interesting encounters, and promises a lifetime of richly<br/>
satisfying and often unexpected learning pleasure.<br/>
. 	<br/>
	Another type of wealth is a life filled with diverse experiences.  Some<br/>
gifted and often misunderstood people seek such wealth in the context of<br/>
their career path.  For instance, a man could start as an engineer, then<br/>
become a painter, then a janitor, then a plumber--whatever strikes his<br/>
fancy.  Though such people may have trouble in the conventional job market,<br/>
they are among the most fascinating and multi-talented people around. <br/>
Certainly they possess incalculable wealth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: Waging the battle against tyrannical team play<br/>
<br/>
	It&#39;s time we as a culture fought back against the team player ethos which<br/>
is carrying out a mass slaughter of individualism.  It&#39;s time we reclaimed<br/>
our lives and scripted them with the unique ideas which all of our brains<br/>
and hearts are capable of producing.  The way to start this fight is to<br/>
foster in children a love of individualism, the time to develop it, and the<br/>
courage to make it more valuable to them than peer acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
	In raising our two children, my spouse and I hope that we can show them by<br/>
our example that it&#39;s possible to live as a happy and thriving individual<br/>
even in a world seemingly dominated by team players.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058997936">John, from an Australian point of view, and allowing for differences in<br/>
accent, I&#39;d say you were spot on, and I was encouraged by your &#39;article&#39; -<br/>
it was &#39;hitting the mark&#39; for me as a parent and as a person.<br/>
We run our own small window cleaning company and my philosophy regarding<br/>
&#39;competition&#39; is the same. Actually, when &#39;challenged&#39; with &quot;I&#39;ve got<br/>
another quote -will that help you reconsider yours?&quot; I tell them that they<br/>
should take the cheapest one and run with it. I&#39;m just not interested in<br/>
getting onto the mindset that is consumed by competition.<br/>
Personally, I want to escape window cleaning and get into &#39;heart&#39;s<br/>
desire&#39;stuff - science journalism, song writing, kid&#39;s stories and Sci-fi TV<br/>
scripts. But its hard to get into this realm of vocation, and I&#39;ve just got<br/>
to do what I&#39;ve got to do - at 48 with 4 kids under 9, and a lovely wife -<br/>
over 9 - just to keep the wolf from the door.<br/>
We&#39;ve been homeschooling - if you can cll it that - for 30months - so we are<br/>
farily new - and still call it &#39;our experiment&#39;.<br/>
As the editor of our local Home-Based Learning Network, I&#39;m always on the<br/>
lookout for encouraging material to use on our official newsletter -<br/>
&quot;Learning Matters&quot; - and I was wondering if I could have your permission to<br/>
reprint your article in our Sept edition? Please!!!!<br/>
We live in Perth -the end of the Earth - most isolated city in the world -<br/>
and closer to Singapore than we are to Sydney, way over on the other side of<br/>
our country.<br/>

&gt;with the article so readers can write me if they so desire.<br/>
