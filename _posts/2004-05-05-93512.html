<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366639225">Hello.<br/>
I have been no-mail for ages but am curious to see how other <br/>
unschooling families deal with bed time and wake-up time.<br/>
We have four children, ranging in age from 11mos to 14 yrs.  When <br/>
left to their own, my children seem to want to stay up late and <br/>
sleep in.  That would normally be ok with me, as I&#39;m usually a night <br/>
owl but since the birth of my newest baby, I seem to be on a <br/>
different sleep schedule.  I&#39;m also finding that I want my house at <br/>
night, without little people running around and getting in my <br/>
face.   LOL!<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m just wondering what limits or routines others may use when <br/>
dealing with bed/rise time.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;So I&#39;m just wondering what limits or routines others may use when<br/>
dealing with bed/rise time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 18, 9, 8 and 3. So I don&#39;t have the scheduling thing like you do<br/>
with such young ones. BUT, when I or my husband need some quiet time or time<br/>
alone, and someone wants to stay up, we compromise. They  stay up if they<br/>
stay in the playroom or their bedrooms. Generally at that time of evening,<br/>
(later than 11:30) they aren&#39;t being loud. Usually they stay in their rooms<br/>
and we tuck them in and say goodnight. They stay up until they want to and<br/>
we have our alone time as well.<br/>
<br/>
As far as getting up, we only schedule that if there&#39;s something going on we<br/>
really want to do the next day early. Like a trip with our hs group. Next<br/>
week we have 2 early for us things to do on Mon. and Tues. So starting on<br/>
Sat.we will get up a little earlier so that by Mon. we are prepared!!!<br/>
Waking up early that day with no preparation has us all rather cranky. Trial<br/>
runs for a few days has us much happier and not tiring out the day of the<br/>
trip.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First, the bad news: it&#39;s their house, too, and your decision to bring in<br/>
another little sleep-deprivation-bundle was yours and your husband&#39;s, not<br/>
the &quot;little people&quot; whose sleeping preferences are suddenly inconvenient<br/>
through no fault of their own.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the good news: it&#39;s your house, too, and the bottom line in our house<br/>
is that we have a history of trying to help each other with needs and wants.<br/>
So open a dialog, explain what you&#39;re concerned about and what you&#39;d like,<br/>
ask them to do the same. The more people in a family, the more needs and<br/>
desires to juggle, but I think it&#39;s worth the effort. There is a difference<br/>
between a true need (Dad must be up for work at 6 a.m., or Jimmy is down<br/>
with the flu and requires peace) and a want.<br/>
<br/>
I try to remember that the assembling of this family I&#39;m in was the idea of<br/>
the two adults in it, not the children who were brought in without their<br/>
prior consent to our quirks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059538684">Have your alone time in the morning, instead! That<br/>
worked really well for me.  It did take some getting<br/>
used to, tho.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our kids natural bed times change with the seasons. This time of year <br/>
they seem to be up later because the sun is still out and they like <br/>
enjoying the evening hours. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote a poem about <br/>
this, called &quot;Bed in Summer&quot;, it always sounded so sad to me:<br/>
<br/>
In winter I get up at night<br/>
And dress by yellow candle-light.<br/>
In summer quite the other way,<br/>
I have to go to bed by day.<br/>
<br/>
I have to go to bed and see<br/>
The birds still hopping on the tree,<br/>
Or hear the grown-up people&#39;s feet<br/>
Still going past me in the street.<br/>
<br/>
And does it not seem hard to you,<br/>
When all the sky is clear and blue,<br/>
And I should like so much to play,<br/>
To have to go to bed by day?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it&#39;s pretty understandable for kids to want to still be <br/>
up when exciting things are going on. If there&#39;s something I need or <br/>
want to do by myself in the mighttime hours, I just tell the kids <br/>
they&#39;ll need to play on their own, read, or whatever. I can get out a <br/>
game or puzzle or something else for them to do if they&#39;re not <br/>
occupied.<br/>
<br/>
This time of year, my alone time is usually in the morning, before <br/>
they wake up. But because my kids inherited DH&#39;s non-sleeping gene <br/>
(he only sleeps 5 - 6 hours a night), I need just about as much sleep <br/>
as they do, so I don&#39;t get a lot of time without them awake, to be <br/>
honest.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, DH is out of town and they&#39;re both going for a sleepover. I <br/>
haven&#39;t slept in an empty house in years and year. Wondering if I&#39;ll <br/>
even sleep tonight! <br/>
