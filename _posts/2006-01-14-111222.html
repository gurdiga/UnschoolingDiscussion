<div id="ygrps-yiv-325456253">VERY BRIEFLY:<br/>
<br/>
There has just been a discussion on another list about how no one  <br/>
should try to depend on one homeschooling or unschooling or parenting  <br/>
list for ALL a family&#39;s needs, and I was reminded of that when I  <br/>
rejected a pending post for being too political.<br/>
<br/>
So if people do want political homeschooling news, where should they go?<br/>
Just without much comment, please throw out here the name of a list  <br/>
or site you use to get a political fix if you need one (&quot;you&quot; being  <br/>
any reader) and then let&#39;s let it go again.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
The page being quoted in the post I rejected is here, in case  <br/>
anyone&#39;s curious, but this list is not a place for such discussions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a yahoo group called Free Thinking Home Educators at   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FreeThinking-HomeEducators/?yguid=77070457">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FreeThinking-HomeEducators/?yguid=77070457</a>  <br/>
where there are very frequent &quot;political&quot; discussions. It is not specifically <br/>
an unschooling group, but it is a very laid back, open to all beliefs and <br/>
types of homeschooling group. The owner asked that anyone that wants to join in <br/>
please read the description page &quot;very carefully before getting into debate&quot;. <br/>
Which I don&#39;t really see so much as debate, but as in-depth, intelligent <br/>
discussions. I believe my space is up ;~) Hope to see some of you folks there!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
