<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527595329">I never got trapped into the flashcarding baby movement. It is not my thing and I detest it. The one thing we did though with both our children was to teach them baby signs to communicate. That would be unnatural in the sense that we do not use that in the normal conversation, but we did it not too make them smarter, but rather help them communicate. I loved it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that my very verbal almost 2/12 old year old daughter only just start asking about colours - she sort of learning them all at once - not one at a time, but a friend&#39;s daughter knew her colours before she was two.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491165822">If unschooling is a lifestyle choice that means avoiding the notion <br/>
that we have to teach children things in order for them to learn <br/>
them, then it makes sense to believe in unschooling from birth. <br/>
There&#39;s a huge push toward early &quot;education&quot; in the form of <br/>
preschools, baby Mozart videos, flashcards, etc. that is the <br/>
precursor to compulsory schooling &quot;education&quot;. If one chooses a <br/>
different belief system, it can influence everything down the line. <br/>
And choosing not to be undermined in such a different belief choice <br/>
can be very difficult for many people. For lots of folks, the <br/>
pressure to put kids in school from grandparents, friends, etc. <br/>
doesn&#39;t start at 5 or 6, but starts at the preschool age.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to give my family a label at all, it would have to be <br/>
unschoolers from birth. We&#39;ve always believed that our children will <br/>
learn everything they need to know naturally and organically, in <br/>
their own time. But there is a difference once my son hit school age. <br/>
His friends went off to school, and that was a big change for him, <br/>
not having them around the neighborhood all the time. Also, when we <br/>
are out and about around the city during the day, it&#39;s obvious to <br/>
others that we&#39;re homeschoolers and we do get the occasional question <br/>
about it. Not huge differences, small ones, but they&#39;re there. <br/>
Mostly, we just get on with the same things we&#39;ve always done, <br/>
following our interests, wherever they might lead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944817758">I&#39;m probably behind on this but, I think for alot of people I know,  they think that the life they are leading before school isn&#39;t enough. <br/>
Maybe some parents don&#39;t take active parts in their childrens lives, I don&#39;t know, but I know many families who have such wonderful summers and vacations that I know if they knew their lives would be enough for their children they could then keep their kids home.  There lives during school turn sooooo unhappy, but they believe this is the only way they can live.  They live unschooled lives at those times, and don&#39;t even see it and then they bring their children to school with alot of kids that are not living their lives that way.  It really wreaks havoc on a childs inner self, very conflicting!<br/>
I&#39;m hoping with me living the way I am they can see how wonderful unschooling your whole life can be.  And that their kids will reap so many benefits from it.<br/>
Trying to think hopefully,<br/>
