Dear Jim,<br/>
<br/>
I am faced with a situation where I would like some input, before I decide<br/>
to jump in; something I very much want to, since it involves my<br/>
eight-year-old nephew and his mother, my half-sister.<br/>
<br/>
James (that is my nephew) was taken away from his mom (Maya) by social<br/>
services during the first week of November of 2000. The events leading up to<br/>
this were as follows (according to my sister): they had just moved to a<br/>
different district (New York area) and James had just gone to school for<br/>
three days. On the fourth day, a Friday, James (and his whole school) was<br/>
dismissed early; something his mother was not made aware of; she is a single<br/>
working mom. When nobody was present to receive James from the school bus<br/>
that day (because he wasn&#39;t expected until an hour later), the bus driver<br/>
took him back to school, the principal called social services, social<br/>
services checked their records and found that my sister had been involved<br/>
with them on previous occasion in 1997. Therefore social services called the<br/>
police to show up at my sister&#39;s house, while they took James and placed him<br/>
in foster care. Social Services claims that James is not well enough<br/>
supervised while in Maya&#39;s care; he is not being abused, she doesn&#39;t do<br/>
drugs or anything of that nature. The only thing they have against her is<br/>
that in their (social services) opinion, Maya is not supervising James<br/>
enough. Maya was &quot;forced&quot; to attend counselling with a psychiatrist chosen<br/>
by social services. After three hours spread out over several sessions,<br/>
costing Maya $ 25 a session, this psychiatrist determined that Maya &quot;does<br/>
not have the ability to know when her son might be in danger&quot;. As a result<br/>
of this testimony, the judge ruled against Maya getting James back. He has<br/>
been through two foster homes and three different schools in less than three<br/>
months. Maya has seen once or twice, talks to him on the phone whenever she<br/>
can. James cries to her every time she calls; he wants to be with her,<br/>
misses her terribly and she him. Maya says that one way that she could get<br/>
him back would be for a family member to apply for temporary guardianship of<br/>
James; if accepted James would be released into the guardian&#39;s care and then<br/>
Maya could take it from there, i.e. get James back from the guardian and get<br/>
on with their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Maya is a Canadian citizen, James has dual citizenship<br/>
US/Canadian (born in the US). Maya has been in trouble in the past, a result<br/>
of having been abandoned herself by her own mother at age 9 (given up for<br/>
adoption), moving through several foster homes, group homes, etc. Since she<br/>
has had James, however, I have witnessed her making a great effort to turn<br/>
her life around. She has raised this child for eight years on her own.<br/>
<br/>
I am a German citizen with Canadian landed immigrant status, my husband is a<br/>
US citizen with Canadian landed immigrant status. We both love James very<br/>
much, have had him stay with us several times; and we want to help Maya and<br/>
James get re-united. Maya wants to get James out of where he is now, and<br/>
move back to Canada and start over. Besides myself she only has an elderly<br/>
grandmother and another sister who is single and running a business of her<br/>
own. I am really the only suitable candidate to apply for this guardianship<br/>
of James and I want to very much, just to get him out of the situation he is<br/>
in and to make sure he sees his mom.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the bare bones of the situation and I would imagine you need more<br/>
to give any real suggestions or advice or feedback; and I would be more than<br/>
happy to provide more info, once I get more. I am going to talk to Maya&#39;s<br/>
lawyer today to find out more.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything at all you could offer at this point?<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
~Nicoletta<br/>

Dear Nicoletta,<br/>
<br/>
I am indeed sorry to hear about the separation of your nephew from<br/>
his mother and from what you have described is totally unwarranted.<br/>
You do need to consult with her attorney on how best to proceed and<br/>
your suggestion to obtain guardianship is a good one.<br/>
<br/>
You should have Maya contact the Canadian Embassy immediately for any<br/>
help that they can provide, as she and her son are Canadian citizens.<br/>
<br/>
Contact The New York Times with your story and for help. A person to<br/>
email your story to: Laurel Graeber	Columnist, Family Fare<br/>
	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:graeber@...">graeber@...</a><br/>
<br/>
If she cannot be of help, ask her who on the NYT would be willing to<br/>
take up Maya&#39;s struggle to have her son returned to her, as there is<br/>
no evidence of abuse and neglect nor harm or injury inflicted upon<br/>
the child. Single moms are being continually punished by various<br/>
elements of our society including the Social Services Administration,<br/>
which is exploiting a situation created by the Public School system,<br/>
as I understand the facts and which is inflicting serious emotional<br/>
harm on the child by wrongfully removing him from his mother.  Such<br/>
removal of child from mother, under these circumstances, constitutes<br/>
&quot;child emotional endangerment&quot; by the SSA, which is supposed to<br/>
protect children not harm them.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what happens and I wish that I could be of more help to<br/>
you. You might want to reference some of my studies posted at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.violence.de">http://www.violence.de</a> which documents the harmful effects of<br/>
mother-infant/child separation upon the child, particularly the film<br/>
documentary at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.violence.de/tv/rockabye.html">http://www.violence.de/tv/rockabye.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Michael Mendizza of Touch the Future might also be of help and I am<br/>
copying this email to him.<br/>
<br/>
Keep fighting--<br/>

Dear Jim,<br/>
<br/>
thank you very much for your support. Below is an article that came to me<br/>
just two days after I found out about what happened to my sister and her<br/>
son. Isn&#39;t THAT ironic!! I will send this and whatever info I have to the<br/>
person you suggested at the New York Times. And I will keep you up to date<br/>
on what happens.<br/>

 Treasure Chest of Misery<br/>
<br/>
  by Doug Quirmbach<br/>
<br/>
 State child protective agencies are increasingly removing children<br/>
 from their homes to take advantage of federal funding programs,<br/>
 according to nationally recognized child welfare experts.<br/>
<br/>
 Recent studies conducted by child advocacy organizations and<br/>
 governmental agencies disclose that caseworkers are opting to<br/>
 forcibly take children from their parents rather than providing<br/>
 family preservation services.  The Center on Child Abuse Prevention<br/>
 Research (1998) reported that &quot;the number of children who<br/>
 received<br/>
 services at home declined from 1,244,400 in 1977 to 493,100 in<br/>
 1994&quot;<br/>
 (p. 6).  During the same period, the amount of children taken out of<br/>
 their homes skyrocketed -- 502,000 children were in foster care<br/>
 placement in 1994.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;While 30% of the children served by the system in 1977 were<br/>
 placed<br/>
 in foster care, that percentage has risen to 50% today,&quot; the<br/>
 researchers reported. &quot;Despite the good intentions of reformers,<br/>
 this<br/>
 service system (CPS) is increasingly relying upon foster care<br/>
 placement . . . .&quot; (Center on Child Abuse Prevention Research,<br/>
 1998:6).<br/>
<br/>
 Parents face increasing risk of losing their children because of the<br/>
 way federal funds are categorized and funneled to the states.  Each<br/>
 entitlement category is earmarked for specific purposes.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Without clear direction, states provided those services that were<br/>
 most &#39;fungible,&#39; that is, generated the most matching revenue from<br/>
 the federal Government,&quot; explain child welfare experts Lela B.<br/>
 Costin, Howard Jacob Karger and David Stoesz (1996:152).<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Because most of the funding for child abuse and neglect is derived<br/>
 from Title IV-B and Title XX, both of which are capped, states must<br/>
 rely on other child welfare components in order to mount child<br/>
 protection efforts,&quot; Costin and her co-authors write (1996:152).<br/>
 Therefore, the experts say, foster care has &quot;become the ex post facto<br/>
 response to child abuse.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Limitless funds are available to the states through Title IV-E,<br/>
 earmarked for out-of-home placement.  State agencies increase their<br/>
 overall revenue by removing children from their homes since money<br/>
 from Title IV-E is channeled to the states in direct proportion to<br/>
 how many children they incarcerate into the system.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;In either case, federal funding [for Title IV-E] is open-ended; once<br/>
 the state appropriates revenues for child welfare, the federal match<br/>
 is essentially demand-driven and therefore guaranteed (Costin, et<br/>
 al., 1996). &quot;This arrangement, of course, creates an enormous<br/>
 incentive for states to maximize the amount of money that can be<br/>
 extracted from the federal government.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 The Children&#39;s Defense fund (1988) reports that 77% of combined<br/>
 funding for child welfare prevention services went for foster care<br/>
 and adoption services (CDF, 1988). The percentage has since<br/>
 increased.  Kathleen Faller told Congress last year that 9 out of 10<br/>
 federal child welfare dollars flow to the states through foster care<br/>
 entitlements.<br/>
<br/>
 Federal and state taxpayer funds are just the tip of the treasure<br/>
 chest available to agencies once they remove a child.<br/>
<br/>
 After federal and state funds have been collected for foster care,<br/>
 the agency then &quot;double dips&quot; by charging the parents for the same<br/>
 care. Once the child is in state custody, the agency can then claim<br/>
 the child&#39;s SDI benefits, effectively robbing from the child&#39;s<br/>
 future. &quot;Victim Compensation&quot; funds are collected by the child&#39;s new<br/>
 caretaker -- the state -- along with other entitlements.<br/>
<br/>
 Training expenses under IV-E is open-ended and pays a return of<br/>
 75%. &quot;Independent Learning&quot; programs for those unfortunate children<br/>
 who have struggled under state custody is reimbursed at 100% with no<br/>
 state participation at all (Green Book, 1993). Adoption assistance<br/>
 for foster kids under Title IV-E is open-ended and the contribution<br/>
 is limited only to Medicaid rates (Green Book, 1993).<br/>
<br/>
 Over 3.2 million reports of child abuse and neglect were made to<br/>
 child protective hot lines in 1996.  Two-thirds of the reports, often<br/>
 made anonymously by disgruntled neighbors or parties involved in<br/>
 custody disputes, were unfounded (NCANDS, 1998).  While only 3 to 5%<br/>
 of the reports that are substantiated by child protective services<br/>
 involve serious child maltreatment, CCAPR discovered that children<br/>
 were removed from their homes in 50% of the cases.<br/>
<br/>
 The San Diego Grand Jury determined that funding arrangements<br/>
 contributed to overzealous CPS caseworkers wrongfully yanking<br/>
 children from their parents.  The Los Angeles County Board of<br/>
 Supervisors investigated foster care practices in that county and<br/>
 issued a scathing report. Mr. Digre, who departed as director after<br/>
 the investigation, seemed to scapegoat the federal grant programs as<br/>
 contributing to DSS&#39;s horrendous treatment of its tiny wards.<br/>
<br/>
 Yet California is not at all unique. State agencies throughout the<br/>
 country incarcerate children because it pays to do so.<br/>
<br/>
 Agencies get considerably more federal and state funds for removing a<br/>
 child from his home than they do in making reasonable efforts to<br/>
 preserve the family. For the child welfare agency, the choice is<br/>
 obvious. Any bureaucracy can be expected to consider first continuing<br/>
 its own interests.<br/>
<br/>
 But what about the interests of our tinniest, most vulnerable of<br/>
 citizens?<br/>
<br/>
 Certainly, the tragic personal costs to a child wrongfully removed<br/>
 from her loving home overwhelms any dollar amount we can ever<br/>
 determine. The damage done to a child through institutional child<br/>
 abuse is irreparable.<br/>
<br/>
 Children and their families desperately need advocates willing to<br/>
 voice their opposition to the wholesale, governmental kidnapping of<br/>
 this nation&#39;s kids.  But children and their families are not<br/>
 given a<br/>
 voice because, of course, it doesn&#39;t pay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112030623">Hello, Nicoletta,<br/>
<br/>
With the program I use to work with (ICWA), we immediately asked the court<br/>
to appoint CASA or an attorney for the child.  The child should have an<br/>
attorney or advocacy group of his own, independent of SS (ever wonder if the<br/>
initials are a freudian slip?) and be sure that the family be given a number<br/>
to choose between so that you can be sure the attorney has not been a SS<br/>
advocate in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Almost all states require this but it is rarely followed through on because<br/>
the families don&#39;t know that the law has an option for this.  You can also<br/>
get the court to order an independent psych to do an eval as SS&#39;s are<br/>
biased.  You also want an independent psych eval for your nephew.<br/>
<br/>
If you can set something up in Canada (work, house/apartment, etc.) for the<br/>
mother in advance, that is also another plus.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have any contact with Social Services at all.  Deal directly with<br/>
the court because anything you say/do with SS is usually twisted to meet<br/>
their perverted needs.<br/>

&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.violence.de">http://www.violence.de</a> which documents the harmful effects of<br/>
&gt; mother-infant/child separation upon the child, particularly the film<br/>

&gt; Dear Jim,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thank you very much for your support. Below is an article that came to me<br/>
&gt; just two days after I found out about what happened to my sister and her<br/>
&gt; son. Isn&#39;t THAT ironic!! I will send this and whatever info I have to the<br/>
&gt; person you suggested at the New York Times. And I will keep you up to date<br/>
&gt; on what happens.<br/>

&gt;  Treasure Chest of Misery<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   by Doug Quirmbach<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  State child protective agencies are increasingly removing children<br/>
&gt;  from their homes to take advantage of federal funding programs,<br/>
&gt;  according to nationally recognized child welfare experts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Recent studies conducted by child advocacy organizations and<br/>
&gt;  governmental agencies disclose that caseworkers are opting to<br/>
&gt;  forcibly take children from their parents rather than providing<br/>
&gt;  family preservation services.  The Center on Child Abuse Prevention<br/>
&gt;  Research (1998) reported that &quot;the number of children who<br/>
&gt;  received<br/>
&gt;  services at home declined from 1,244,400 in 1977 to 493,100 in<br/>
&gt;  1994&quot;<br/>
&gt;  (p. 6).  During the same period, the amount of children taken out of<br/>
&gt;  their homes skyrocketed -- 502,000 children were in foster care<br/>
&gt;  placement in 1994.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;While 30% of the children served by the system in 1977 were<br/>
&gt;  placed<br/>
&gt;  in foster care, that percentage has risen to 50% today,&quot; the<br/>
&gt;  researchers reported. &quot;Despite the good intentions of reformers,<br/>
&gt;  this<br/>
&gt;  service system (CPS) is increasingly relying upon foster care<br/>
&gt;  placement . . . .&quot; (Center on Child Abuse Prevention Research,<br/>
&gt;  1998:6).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Parents face increasing risk of losing their children because of the<br/>
&gt;  way federal funds are categorized and funneled to the states.  Each<br/>
&gt;  entitlement category is earmarked for specific purposes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;Without clear direction, states provided those services that were<br/>
&gt;  most &#39;fungible,&#39; that is, generated the most matching revenue from<br/>
&gt;  the federal Government,&quot; explain child welfare experts Lela B.<br/>
&gt;  Costin, Howard Jacob Karger and David Stoesz (1996:152).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;Because most of the funding for child abuse and neglect is derived<br/>
&gt;  from Title IV-B and Title XX, both of which are capped, states must<br/>
&gt;  rely on other child welfare components in order to mount child<br/>
&gt;  protection efforts,&quot; Costin and her co-authors write (1996:152).<br/>
&gt;  Therefore, the experts say, foster care has &quot;become the ex post facto<br/>
&gt;  response to child abuse.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Limitless funds are available to the states through Title IV-E,<br/>
&gt;  earmarked for out-of-home placement.  State agencies increase their<br/>
&gt;  overall revenue by removing children from their homes since money<br/>
&gt;  from Title IV-E is channeled to the states in direct proportion to<br/>
&gt;  how many children they incarcerate into the system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;In either case, federal funding [for Title IV-E] is open-ended; once<br/>
&gt;  the state appropriates revenues for child welfare, the federal match<br/>
&gt;  is essentially demand-driven and therefore guaranteed (Costin, et<br/>
&gt;  al., 1996). &quot;This arrangement, of course, creates an enormous<br/>
&gt;  incentive for states to maximize the amount of money that can be<br/>
&gt;  extracted from the federal government.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The Children&#39;s Defense fund (1988) reports that 77% of combined<br/>
&gt;  funding for child welfare prevention services went for foster care<br/>
&gt;  and adoption services (CDF, 1988). The percentage has since<br/>
&gt;  increased.  Kathleen Faller told Congress last year that 9 out of 10<br/>
&gt;  federal child welfare dollars flow to the states through foster care<br/>
&gt;  entitlements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Federal and state taxpayer funds are just the tip of the treasure<br/>
&gt;  chest available to agencies once they remove a child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  After federal and state funds have been collected for foster care,<br/>
&gt;  the agency then &quot;double dips&quot; by charging the parents for the same<br/>
&gt;  care. Once the child is in state custody, the agency can then claim<br/>
&gt;  the child&#39;s SDI benefits, effectively robbing from the child&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  future. &quot;Victim Compensation&quot; funds are collected by the child&#39;s new<br/>
&gt;  caretaker -- the state -- along with other entitlements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Training expenses under IV-E is open-ended and pays a return of<br/>
&gt;  75%. &quot;Independent Learning&quot; programs for those unfortunate children<br/>
&gt;  who have struggled under state custody is reimbursed at 100% with no<br/>
&gt;  state participation at all (Green Book, 1993). Adoption assistance<br/>
&gt;  for foster kids under Title IV-E is open-ended and the contribution<br/>
&gt;  is limited only to Medicaid rates (Green Book, 1993).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Over 3.2 million reports of child abuse and neglect were made to<br/>
&gt;  child protective hot lines in 1996.  Two-thirds of the reports, often<br/>
&gt;  made anonymously by disgruntled neighbors or parties involved in<br/>
&gt;  custody disputes, were unfounded (NCANDS, 1998).  While only 3 to 5%<br/>
&gt;  of the reports that are substantiated by child protective services<br/>
&gt;  involve serious child maltreatment, CCAPR discovered that children<br/>
&gt;  were removed from their homes in 50% of the cases.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The San Diego Grand Jury determined that funding arrangements<br/>
&gt;  contributed to overzealous CPS caseworkers wrongfully yanking<br/>
&gt;  children from their parents.  The Los Angeles County Board of<br/>
&gt;  Supervisors investigated foster care practices in that county and<br/>
&gt;  issued a scathing report. Mr. Digre, who departed as director after<br/>
&gt;  the investigation, seemed to scapegoat the federal grant programs as<br/>
&gt;  contributing to DSS&#39;s horrendous treatment of its tiny wards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Yet California is not at all unique. State agencies throughout the<br/>
&gt;  country incarcerate children because it pays to do so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Agencies get considerably more federal and state funds for removing a<br/>
&gt;  child from his home than they do in making reasonable efforts to<br/>
&gt;  preserve the family. For the child welfare agency, the choice is<br/>
&gt;  obvious. Any bureaucracy can be expected to consider first continuing<br/>
&gt;  its own interests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  But what about the interests of our tinniest, most vulnerable of<br/>
&gt;  citizens?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Certainly, the tragic personal costs to a child wrongfully removed<br/>
&gt;  from her loving home overwhelms any dollar amount we can ever<br/>
&gt;  determine. The damage done to a child through institutional child<br/>
&gt;  abuse is irreparable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Children and their families desperately need advocates willing to<br/>
&gt;  voice their opposition to the wholesale, governmental kidnapping of<br/>
&gt;  this nation&#39;s kids.  But children and their families are not<br/>
&gt;  given a<br/>
&gt;  voice because, of course, it doesn&#39;t pay.<br/>
