<div id="ygrps-yiv-693001747">&quot;We had two au pairs. One from Germany, and one from Denmark. They are NOT <br/>
part-time. They are considered part of the family and live in your home for one <br/>
<br/>
year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A neighbor of mine worked from home. She had an Aupair that came to their house three full days a week and did not live with them. I&#39;m sure there are differences in agencies and areas. I knew the Aupair personally, because we invited her to the neighbor &quot;moms groups&quot; we started. She had been looking specifically for part time, so maybe that made the difference. She was also relocating over here, don&#39;t know how that affected it all. Maybe the term &quot;nanny&quot; would have fit her better, but she referred to herself as an Aupair, as did her employer.??<br/>
