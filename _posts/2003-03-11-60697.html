<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275984482">I posted this once before a while ago but thought maybe some time would help <br/>
for answers.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Sierra. She cries a lot over what seems to be nothing at all. Now I try <br/>
to put myself in her position to understand, but to be honest, most of the <br/>
time I just don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve tried talking to her when she gets like this <br/>
and it makes things so much worse. I can&#39;t even begin to talk to her about <br/>
why she&#39;s crying until much later. If I even try a half hour later, she&#39;ll <br/>
start crying all over again. I&#39;ve tried holding her and she just keeps <br/>
crying and crying. It seems like leaving her alone works best for her to get <br/>
over it. As much as it works, I hate doing it. Just leaving her to cry.<br/>
<br/>
Examples: The other night, Joe was getting her into the shower. She wanted <br/>
to take a bath. So Joe got the shower ready for her to do her hair first and <br/>
then run the bath for her to play. Well I had in another time, given her a <br/>
bath first and conditioned her hair, let her play and then rinse her hair <br/>
out after. Joe didn&#39;t know and she didn&#39;t ask or say anything. She just <br/>
started to cry. Finding out later that she wanted to bath first and then <br/>
shower her hair.<br/>
<br/>
Joe and I are making a very thoughtful effort to explain things and ask more <br/>
so she understands and we do too. But it&#39;s not always things like this.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight she was starting to feel worse again. With everyone else getting <br/>
better, she&#39;ll get everyone else sick again. I was trying to get her to take <br/>
some meds so she wouldn&#39;t get a lot worse. I gave her two choices and she <br/>
didn&#39;t want either one. She went and got into bed before anyone else, I <br/>
rubbed her down with Vicks and she was fine. When Joe went to put Alyssa to <br/>
bed, Sierra was crying like crazy. No one had a clue as to what was wrong. <br/>
Turns out she just started to cry because she couldn&#39;t breath. I got her <br/>
calmed down and then she wanted to take a Sudafed. She comes out to do that, <br/>
she&#39;s drinking water and I&#39;m doing dishes and she just starts to cry again. <br/>
This time because she dropped her pill on the floor. It wasn&#39;t that she <br/>
couldn&#39;t find it cause she didn&#39;t even look. She just started to cry because <br/>
she dropped it. Joe got her settled and found the pill and she took it and <br/>
then went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Now before anyone thinks it&#39;s just because she&#39;s sick, that isn&#39;t the case. <br/>
These are just the latest examples that I can think of. Even when she&#39;s <br/>
perfectly fine, these types of things still bring her to crying.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes she&#39;ll start to cry just because she can&#39;t finish something to <br/>
eat. Now she never gets yelled at for any of these types of things from any <br/>
of us. The kids are never punished. That&#39;s what makes this all so hard to <br/>
get. I can&#39;t see where she would be afraid of anything. No one is making fun <br/>
or anything close to that. Now sometimes it is her brother pushing her <br/>
buttons. That I get. But a lot of the time it&#39;s nothing of the sort.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas??<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
LOL!!!! I&#39;ve actually thought about that. I&#39;ve even asked her if she wanted <br/>
to join an acting class but she&#39;s not interested. (it&#39;s for homeschoolers)<br/>
<br/>
My mom came me to one day and asked if I knew Sierra could make herself cry <br/>
on command. Now my mom has a tendency to be a &quot;Oh that didn&#39;t hurt you&#39;re <br/>
not really crying&quot; kind of person. So I really can&#39;t be sure if she is <br/>
right. Whenever I&#39;ve seen it happen, this kid is really crying. Now she can <br/>
prolong it once she gets going. That&#39;s why holding her doesn&#39;t help. She <br/>
really gets it going when someone is around.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s rather reassuring to know someone else was pretty much the same way and <br/>
was able to overcome it later on. Not comforting that it was terrible for <br/>
you. I guess one reason why I&#39;m so concerned is I remember a friend from <br/>
grade school. Poor Jamie sat in front of me and had bright red hair and very <br/>
pale skin. She wore her hair always in two braided pig tails. If the teacher <br/>
called on her and she didn&#39;t know what to say, her ears would turn bright <br/>
red and I knew she was going to cry. She cried for everything, even with us <br/>
kids only. Very sensitive. I remember later on kids making fun of her. It <br/>
certainly wasn&#39;t anything she seemed to enjoy. I left that school in 5th <br/>
grade so I never found out how Jamie dealt with it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the outlook of how hard it may be for Sierra to deal with too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135005169">Mary, <br/>
 <br/>
I think you were describing me as a kid.  Man, I used to cry over<br/>
*everything*.  Any little feeling of any emotion seemed to come welling<br/>
out as tears.  It was embarrassing but I just couldn&#39;t stop doing it.<br/>
Even as a teenager, I had this boyfriend who thought women only cried to<br/>
manipulate men, and he used to yell at me all the time for crying and I<br/>
tried so hard to stop, but I couldn&#39;t.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a lot better now (I&#39;m 27) but there was one time just last year that<br/>
I was eating lunch with my husband and kids in a restaurant and I wanted<br/>
to go to Barnes and Noble afterwards and my husband said he was sick of<br/>
Barnes and Noble (we&#39;d been going almost every weekend because it was<br/>
close and the kids like the play area).  Well, I just started crying and<br/>
couldn&#39;t stop.  I know that sounds stupid.  All he said was that he was<br/>
bored going their every week, but I *wasn&#39;t* bored of going there, so I<br/>
thought he was saying that I was a boring person for wanting to do the<br/>
same thing all the time.  I thought for the rest of my marriage we&#39;d<br/>
never go to a bookstore together again because he was so bored with it.<br/>
I know that sounds really stupid *now*, but sitting in the restaurant<br/>
that day, it seemed perfectly rational and I cried through the whole<br/>
meal.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s no surprise, then, that my first son should be sensitive.  He cries<br/>
all the time and it&#39;s hard to understand why sometimes.  Yesterday he<br/>
wanted to have a picnic on the living room floor and I was sitting on a<br/>
blanket with his brother, when he came in carrying about 12 forks.  I<br/>
said, &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll need the forks for our sandwiches and milk.&quot;<br/>
Well, he started crying and threw himself into my arms sobbing and when<br/>
he stopped he said, &quot;You hurt my feelings and now we can&#39;t have a<br/>
picnic.&quot;  Hours later he was thinking about it and said, &quot;Was that<br/>
silly?&quot;  I said sometimes things seem silly to us later, but if his<br/>
feelings were really hurt at the time then it wasn&#39;t silly when it<br/>
happened.<br/>
 <br/>
When my son cries over every little thing, I just remind myself of my<br/>
brother, who cried over every little thing the whole time we were<br/>
growing up (even things that wouldn&#39;t have made me cry).  He&#39;s 22 now,<br/>
and a Marine, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s cried at all since he was about 15.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess that&#39;s not really advice, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s helpful at<br/>
all.  But I assure you, people who cry easily aren&#39;t trying to<br/>
manipulate people, and telling them it&#39;s irrational to be crying is only<br/>
going to make them cry harder.  I think emotional control comes with<br/>
age.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622945957">How old is she? My dd is also a crier and I have just grown to accept that part of her. I actually love her openness and willingness to express, as opposed to my ten year old who I feel like I have to pull everything out of and who I always worry is trying to hold her feelings in. My husband (who is 35) is a huge crier. He cries over everything! We always laugh about this but it is the best quality about him. Kelli<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any ideas?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My first ideas might be lame, but maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
Rocking?  Does rocking help?  Do you have a rocking chair you can use while <br/>
you&#39;re comforting her?  Do you have swings in the yard and can you go out <br/>
with her and get her to swing while she&#39;s crying?<br/>
<br/>
Is there music she likes that you could leave on lots?  Holly likes to have a <br/>
CD on when she&#39;s in the bathtub.  Cyndi Lauper, lately.  Different things <br/>
over the years, and not always needed.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you breathe with her and try to get her to use deep breaths to calm down?  <br/>
Crying creates oxygen deprivation, which can feel pretty good IF you want to <br/>
maintain your adrenaline jag, and sometimes that&#39;s useful--to cry really hard <br/>
until the adrenaline&#39;s gone.  But its not until the really hard crying (which <br/>
comes with some deep breathing) that it goes.   So if it&#39;s casual, habitual <br/>
crying, trying to get her to breathe as deeply as possible, wait a second or <br/>
two before breathing in again, holding it in when she breathes as deeply as <br/>
she can, breathing out, then huffing the last little part out and waiting a <br/>
second or two... that will slow her pulse and help her calm  herself.  But <br/>
you&#39;ll probably have to talk her through it the first many times.<br/>

So  he shows up with twelve forks.  You could have made a design in the <br/>
middle with them.  You could have set them around the perimeter to keep ants <br/>
away.  You could have given each person four forks to outline their spot.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he just wanted to do something different and was discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
From an unschooling point of view, there are a lot of things to do with <br/>
twelve forks besides just not eat sandwiches with them.<br/>

&gt; then <br/>
&gt; I knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before the tears would start. I really, really <br/>
&gt; hated it. I finally (at 25 or so!) just MADE myself STOP. I&#39;d think about <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I have gotten worse.  When i was pregnant It started, hormones, but <br/>
it has continued.  Cry at the drop of a hat.  LOL.  I think some people are <br/>
more sensitive to any change in their environment.  And being sick just seems <br/>
to make it worse.  I know with Phillip I try to ask as many questions as <br/>
possible to get things right.  You have a fever...do you want anything <br/>
Tylenol, Motrin, a bath?  Do you want to chew the Tylenol or crush it?  Crush <br/>
it in juice or water?  What kind of juice?  <br/>
<br/>
He gets very mad if I don&#39;t ask.  Like I am taking his choice away.  Even <br/>
everyday stuff.  Do you want those breakfast patties cold or hot?  Cut or not <br/>
cut?  Cut into chunks or strips?  Do you want any ketchup with them?<br/>
<br/>
Jackson doesn&#39;t do that and then Phillip gets upset. I try to explain to <br/>
Jackson that Phil wants things his way not ours, he wants to make even little <br/>
decisions. I think it is the least I can do to help the situation along and <br/>
we all get what we want.  Sometimes he gets what he wants himself and <br/>
sometimes he just wants me to do it.  I don&#39;t mind.<br/>

You could could tell your son they eat sandwiches with forks in <br/>

So the next time you have sandwiches break out the knives and forks.  <br/>

&gt; going to make them cry harder.  I think emotional control comes with<br/>

anything could make me cry.  I was the school crybaby from the time in<br/>
kindergarten that the kids figured out they could make me cry.  My parents<br/>
never told me I was wrong to cry, but I remember my grandmother telling me<br/>
not to cry, that whatever it was wasn&#39;t that bad.  She even said that the<br/>
time a hornet stung me on my lower lip.  (I was pouting.)  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; The homeopathic remedy Pulsatilla can be really helpful for weepy kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m glad you mentioned this Carol, I couldn&#39;t remember if Pulsatilla was good <br/>
for the weepy stuff, or just the clingy and weepy child.<br/>
If holding helps a child, then Pulsatilla is usually the right remedy. But <br/>
Mary said that Sierra gets worse with holding, so would that still be the <br/>
remedy?<br/>

wants.  Just one dose and within minutes, she&#39;s ready to be held and <br/>
comforted.<br/>

<br/>
I have an idea. She sounds like me as a child - I got frustrated easily <br/>
and didn&#39;t find it easy to express myself - to express my needs. I&#39;m <br/>
sure I looked pretty irrational to my parents who would walk in and <br/>
find me crying, just like you described, out of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
I would have been helped by being given &quot;scripts&quot; - things to say and <br/>
exact words to use.<br/>
<br/>
There are such things in Myrna Shure&#39;s book, &quot;I Can Problem Solve.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If somebody said to me, &quot;When you feel like you might start crying, <br/>
come to me and say these words: &#39;I am sad,&quot; that would have been a huge <br/>
milestone for me.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds kind of silly, but it is true.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know. I was VERY easy to cry as a child. I hated it, but I just<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t stop. The slightest thing would make a knot in my <br/>
&gt; throat---and then<br/>
&gt; I knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before the tears would start. I really, <br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; hated it. I finally (at 25 or so!) just MADE myself STOP. I&#39;d think <br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; ANYTHING just to keep from crying. I&#39;m OK now (I&#39;m 42!).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sweet Sierra. She sounds intense and sensitive and unable to communicate as <br/>
well as she would like to right now. I was a crier too. And I cried A LOT. <br/>
Just like Sierra. My kids do it too to some extent. Other times they will <br/>
skip the crying part and just shut down into silence.<br/>
<br/>
Frustrating isn&#39;t it?!<br/>
<br/>
I think that talking about it when they&#39;re not upset helps. Talking about <br/>
other ways to express frustration. It sounds like Sierra is perhaps very <br/>
orderly or precise in her own mind about how she likes things done. Not in a <br/>
bad way. But for her the order of a bathtime routine is obviously <br/>
comforting. Change is upsetting. Casey is like that. I try to aware of <br/>
transitions and routines. If we&#39;re going to deviate at all, I try to give <br/>
her a choice or lots of warning ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some others here will have other ideas. I&#39;m all ears. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

&lt;&lt;How old is she? My dd is also a crier and I have just grown to <br/>
accept that part of her. I actually love her openness and willingness <br/>
to express, as opposed to my ten year old who I feel like I have to <br/>
pull everything out of and who I always worry is trying to hold her <br/>
feelings in&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh I forgot that part. Sierra is 7. And she really isn&#39;t open. She <br/>
has a tendency to clam up. I think it&#39;s because she may not be real <br/>
good at communicating what&#39;s wrong that she cries. Oooh, big <br/>
lightbulb moment. I guess too that she just doesn&#39;t know how to <br/>
express maybe frustration that might a problem too. Not sure.  Maybe <br/>
I should ask how to go about getting her to understand and talk about <br/>
what&#39;s bothering and what she&#39;s feeling. <br/>

Kirby went through varying phases when he was little.  He would go for a <br/>
while being very expressive, and then he&#39;s come to a frustration stage.  We <br/>
(think) we figured out that his emotional perceptions and his verbal skills <br/>
weren&#39;t always growing at the same rate.  Sometimes he was frustrated about <br/>
something he didn&#39;t have any words for.  Then he would have more words, and <br/>
be fine for a while.<br/>
<br/>
And it turned out one of his best skills is the interpersonal/intrapersonal <br/>
thing, so that fit our original theory.<br/>
<br/>
Other back-and-forth growth patterns we saw in our kids were/are talling up, <br/>
then plumping up (back and forth) and having the desire to do something, and <br/>
eveloping the physical ability.  Obvious, maybe, especially the last one.  <br/>
But I think it happens with emotional expression too.<br/>
