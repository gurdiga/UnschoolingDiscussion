&gt;       Breast-Feeding May Protect Vs. Cancer<br/>
&gt;       Thu Jul 18, 7:13 PM ET<br/>
&gt;       By EMMA ROSS, AP Medical Writer<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       The number of children women have and the length of time they<br/>
&gt;breast-feed them are the most important factors influencing their chance of<br/>
&gt;developing breast cancer ( news - web sites) � even more important than<br/>
&gt;genetic factors, major new research shows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       The landmark study, published this week in The Lancet medical <br/>
&gt;journal,<br/>
&gt;found that if women in the industrialized world breast-fed each of their<br/>
&gt;children six months longer, they could reduce their chance of breast cancer<br/>
&gt;by 5 percent, even if they have a strong family history of the disease.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       Experts said the findings help explain the mysterious rise in breast<br/>
&gt;cancer rates over the last century.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       &quot;In the developed world there have been enormous changes over the <br/>
&gt;last<br/>
&gt;100 years in childbearing patterns and this illustrates that those changes<br/>
&gt;can explain a great deal of the increase in breast cancer rates,&quot; said<br/>
&gt;Eugina Calle, director of analytic epidemiology at the American Cancer<br/>
&gt;Society ( news - web sites).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       The study involved 200 researchers across the globe examining more<br/>
&gt;than 47 studies that investigated a total of 150,000 women worldwide. The<br/>
&gt;analysis of the pooled information was conducted by epidemiologists at<br/>
&gt;Oxford University in England.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       The idea that childbearing is linked to breast cancer dates to 1743,<br/>
&gt;when an Italian researcher called the disease an occupational hazard of<br/>
&gt;nuns, attributing their relatively high rate of breast cancer to their<br/>
&gt;childlessness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       Breast cancer rates really started to climb at the end of the 19th<br/>
&gt;century, and by the 1950s, it was well established that the number of<br/>
&gt;children a woman had was a major factor in breast cancer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       In 1970, a study found that the age at which a woman had her first<br/>
&gt;child was key, but that neither the number of children she had nor her<br/>
&gt;breast-feeding habits mattered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       &quot;Since that time, almost every study on breast cancer has confirmed<br/>
&gt;that finding on age at first birth, but there&#39;s been a lot of confusion<br/>
&gt;about whether the number of children and breast-feeding had an effect on<br/>
&gt;breast cancer,&quot; said the new study&#39;s leader, Valerie Beral, head of the<br/>
&gt;Oxford epidemiology unit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       Confusion has remained, particularly about the role of <br/>
&gt;breast-feeding,<br/>
&gt;because individual studies have been too small to provide answers, she <br/>
&gt;said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       The Oxford group started by looking at 20,000 women who had only one<br/>
&gt;child and who had never breast-fed, and compared them with women who did <br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;breast-feed but continued to have children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       &quot;The risks go down the more children you have. Even if they&#39;d never<br/>
&gt;breast-fed, the risk of breast cancer went down by 7 percent for every<br/>
&gt;additional child,&quot; Beral said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       The researchers also found that, regardless of the number of <br/>
&gt;children,<br/>
&gt;the risk of breast cancer dropped by 4.3 percent for every year the women<br/>
&gt;breast-fed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       The magnitude of protection was the same in all women, regardless of<br/>
&gt;other characteristics, such as ethnic origin, drinking habits and age at<br/>
&gt;menopause.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       In the developed world, women have on average two or three children<br/>
&gt;and breast-feed each for about two or three months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       A century ago � before oral contraception, infant formula, improved<br/>
&gt;infant survival and career opportunities for women � Western women used to<br/>
&gt;have six or seven children and breast-feed each for about two years � a<br/>
&gt;pattern still dominant in many parts of the developing world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       Today, women in the industrialized world have a 6.3 percent chance <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;getting breast cancer by age 70, compared with a 2.7 percent chance for<br/>
&gt;their counterparts in poor countries.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       Part of the reason is that women in poor countries have children<br/>
&gt;earlier, at about 18 or 19, compared with 23 or 24 in the developed world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       But that couldn&#39;t explain all the difference in the breast cancer<br/>
&gt;rates.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       &quot;People have been struggling to fill that gap. Things like diet,<br/>
&gt;alcohol ... all these things have come up in an attempt to explain the<br/>
&gt;difference,&quot; Beral said. &quot;But, it&#39;s prolonging breast-feeding and having<br/>
&gt;lots of children that really pushes breast cancer rates down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       &quot;There are obviously other determinants, but they are much smaller.<br/>
&gt;Those two factors account for much of the difference in breast cancer rates<br/>
&gt;between developed and developing countries,&quot; Beral said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       The study found that if women in developed countries had six or <br/>
&gt;seven<br/>
&gt;children instead of two or three, their risk of breast cancer would <br/>
&gt;decrease<br/>
&gt;from 6.3 percent to 4.7 percent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       &quot;If you add to that two years of breast-feeding per child � which is<br/>
&gt;typical for women in rural areas of the developing world � you get a <br/>
&gt;further<br/>
&gt;40 percent reduction down to 2.7 percent,&quot; Beral said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       Changing those two factors alone would more than halve the risk of<br/>
&gt;breast cancer in the developed world, the study found.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       The researchers also calculated what would happen to breast cancer<br/>
&gt;risk if women still had only two or three children but breast-fed each for<br/>
&gt;six months longer than the norm of two or three months. That would <br/>
&gt;translate<br/>
&gt;to a maximum breast-feeding time of nine months per baby.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;       They found that the chances of breast cancer would decrease from 6.3<br/>
&gt;percent to 6 percent, a 5 percent drop.<br/>
