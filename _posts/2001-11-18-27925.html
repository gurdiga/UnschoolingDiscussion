<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408083997">I hope this cut and paste reply is not too hard to<br/>
follow. I am the K, and Sandra is the S.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K-&quot;&lt;&lt;  If they are<br/>
not addictive, then why is it so hard to give them up?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>S- &quot;But you could say that about water and sleep and<br/>
being with other <br/>
people.<br/>
It would be hard for me to give up being with my<br/>
kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K- Those things are not giving you health problems, so<br/>
they are not related to the discussion. <br/>
<br/>
Try to find any example of a food that you crave even<br/>
though it makes you sick. If you have no experience<br/>
with that, then I am happy for you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K-&quot;&lt;&lt;Is<br/>
alcoholism just a habit? Is smoking only something the<br/>
smoker enjoys but feels no real physical cravings<br/>
for?&gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;Nobody at my house smokes.  I bought cheap bourbon<br/>
yesterday to make a <br/>
fruit <br/>
cake.  I had a margarita last month.  No addictions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
K- Again I am glad that these items are not addictions<br/>
for you personally. For many people they are a real<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;Beans and tortillas are super-common here.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think people are <br/>
addicted <br/>
to them, I just think they&#39;re cheap and common local<br/>
comfort foods.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
K- If you are not having any health problems from<br/>
these foods, then they are not related to the<br/>
discussion. Again I am glad they are not a problem for<br/>
you personally.   <br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;All humans eat some kind of bread.  Have we been<br/>
bread addicts for a <br/>
thousands of years?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
K- Maybe many of us are. Breads are commonly referred<br/>
to as &quot;comfort foods&quot;, mood altering, calming, and<br/>
soothing. Personally wheat makes me feel drugged, but<br/>
I don&#39;t even notice it until I avoided it for quite a<br/>
long time. Trying it again was like being high. There<br/>
are many other life sustaining grains out there. Why<br/>
is wheat so important? Maybe it is a calming food. <br/>
<br/>
Just because something has always been done or is<br/>
&quot;just the way things are&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that it will be<br/>
healthy for everyone. It just makes it harder for<br/>
anyone to believe there could be any problem.<br/>
<br/>
Smoking is an example of something that has been done<br/>
for thousands of years. Anyone who said it was<br/>
addictive or unhealthy would have been laughed at. Yet<br/>
now the popular scientific opinion has changed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;Maybe addiction is too strong a word to use for<br/>
every single thing <br/>
people <br/>
like and need.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&quot;<br/>
<br/>
K-Of course it is too strong a word for every single<br/>
thing people like or need. I did not use it that way.<br/>
I used it to describe certain foods that some people<br/>
crave and keep eating, even though that food makes<br/>
them ill. <br/>
<br/>
I am not claiming that everyone is in denial if they<br/>
think they have no food allergies. I think that lack<br/>
of personal experience with it doesn&#39;t make it true or<br/>
false. I expect everyone will do their own experiments<br/>
and research, and see for themselves whether or not it<br/>
is true for them. Many people I know have been<br/>
surprised.  <br/>
<br/>
I am proposing this idea as an open question to anyone<br/>
who may have (or be caring for someone who has)<br/>
chronic health problems like obesity, exhaustion,<br/>
inability to concentrate, asthma, digestive troubles<br/>
and basically anything that really bothers you that<br/>
you have no other known cause for. I am asking you to<br/>
ask your own questions about the relationship of what<br/>
you eat to how you feel. There is a real chemical<br/>
connection. <br/>
<br/>
This list is full of people who ask their own<br/>
questions and find answers that work for them. We do<br/>
not believe that everything society says is true is<br/>
always healthy for every person. We are happy to share<br/>
experiences and ideas without dismissing them. Our own<br/>
lack of personal experience with something doesn&#39;t<br/>
make us claim it doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
There are almost 600 people on this list. What do you<br/>
all think about this idea?<br/>

I think you are exactly right about allergies.  People who don&#39;t have<br/>
them and haven&#39;t had to live with them, sometimes just don&#39;t understand. <br/>
I think the same holds true with many other things. OCD, depression, etc.<br/>
- - I wish I had a dime for every person who has told me to just cheer up<br/>
and go do stuff and I&#39;d feel better.  When I&#39;m down, that&#39;s the last<br/>
thing I need - to force myself out in public which ALWAYS makes my downs<br/>
worse.  It&#39;s the same with my daughter.  When she is down, she has to get<br/>
her meds adjusted and work it out her way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying someone who has never experienced something can&#39;t come up<br/>
with a suggestion or two but when the person living it says, &quot;no that<br/>
won&#39;t work because . . .&quot; then the advice giver needs to accept that as<br/>
truth - not say it&#39;s a denial of reality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202830693">Hi Bridget, Kathy, and everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list.  This is my first post.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget, I agree with what you wrote:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying someone who has never experienced something can&#39;t come up<br/>
<br/>
with a suggestion or two but when the person living it says, &quot;no that<br/>
won&#39;t work because . . .&quot; then the advice giver needs to accept that as<br/>
truth - not say it&#39;s a denial of reality.<br/>
<br/>
I have suffered from severe clinical depression my entire life.  For<br/>
years I tried many non-medical ways to counter this condition (when I<br/>
finally realized what I was suffering from).  Excercise (until recently,<br/>
I was always very athletic and active), diet (years of being on a vegan<br/>
and then a macrobiotic diet, etc.).  I tried many different things.  I<br/>
finally resorted to medication.  Prozac was my answer.  It has made a<br/>
tremendous difference in my life.  I swear by it.  It is right for me.<br/>
I wish I had found it many years before I finally did.  Obviously, I<br/>
make no secret of my need for this medication.  I&#39;m not embarrassed by<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, people start questioning me about, &quot;well did you try changing<br/>
your diet?  Or, do you excercise, etc.?&quot;  I have recently found myself<br/>
resenting the fact I have to go through my whole history (which is very<br/>
extensive - there are many factors invloved, which goes back 3<br/>
generations) to explain why I have found that I need to medicate<br/>
myself.  Maybe I&#39;m just too sensitive.  After all, aren&#39;t these people<br/>
just trying to help me?  People need to realize how different we all are<br/>
and respect their choices just as I try to respect my childrens&#39;<br/>
choices, which I think is a big factor in unschooling.  I hope I am<br/>
making sense.<br/>

intelligent and not taken personally and out of<br/>
context! What a refreshing read. Thank you.<br/>

P.S. Does anyone know of a website or online group<br/>
along Pat Montgomery&#39;s line of<br/>

similar style to mine was very impressed with her talk<br/>
