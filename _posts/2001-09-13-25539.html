<div id="ygrps-yiv-494763191">&lt;&lt;Marx called religion the &quot;opium of the masses&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I would agree.  I just think there is a tremendous difference between religion (the church) and Christianity (the teachings of Christ).<br/>
<br/>
As far as Christianity and capitalism go, how can one be a pure capitalist (supply and demand, etc.) and be merciful to those less fortunate who are unable to provide for themselves.  You have to turn to some kind of socialism which is where the U.S. appears to be moving.<br/>
