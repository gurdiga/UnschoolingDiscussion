<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fabulous! Casey and I actually changed rooms for her last week. We needed <br/>
something to take our minds off our bunny&#39;s sudden death, so we decided to <br/>
trade Casey&#39;s room with the larger guest room. We accomplished most of it <br/>
within 2 days too and on much less than a 500 pound budget. We painted the <br/>
new room purple, made curtains and pillows, put a bead trim around an old <br/>
light shade, organized, sorted and (like you said so wonderfully) remembered <br/>
our way through her stuff. We set up her old room as the new guest room and <br/>
even re-set up her museum. It was fun!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Everyone is happy and smiling, talking and singing.  All it took from me <br/>

joy of yes at work.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The other good one is Trading Spaces. Carly and I love watching this <br/>
show.Though, I think I&#39;d scream if someone pput moss or hay on my walls. <br/>
Don&#39;t they realize that these are great bug habitats?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also addicted to Whose Line is is Anyway. There&#39;s a British and an <br/>
American version. Hilarious and creative.<br/>
Carly introduced her grandmother to the show the other day. Typical response, <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s silly and stupid&quot;. I was so proud of my husband&#39;s response, &quot;Doesn&#39;t <br/>
she realize how much Carly loves this show; couldn&#39;t she have come up with a <br/>
more positive response instead of a put-down?&quot; My daughter handled it well. <br/>
&quot;I expect this from Grandma, but I love her anyway&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Carly and Eric are visiting their grandparents in CT this past week. A huge <br/>
leap of faith for us -- my husband&#39;s mother has definite ideas on <br/>
child-rearing. Can be very controlling but is married to a very mellow man. <br/>
They&#39;re having fun, but I know that Carly can&#39;t wait to have us around. <br/>
Discussion/talks without criticism for her ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s hear it for the fluff in our lives. Makes life fun.<br/>
