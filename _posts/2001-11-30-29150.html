(Before I have to leave i&#39;net access on Monday for a few weeks).<br/>
<br/>
Its extremely important for an unschooling environment to be nurturing. <br/>
After all, we all get enough flak from outside sources.<br/>
<br/>
But what happens when that flak is from an inside source. From a source <br/>
that prolly  has had some pretty deep rooted unfavourable experiences in <br/>
childhood - hence the issues now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lets go on the assumption that it would take just as long to help this <br/>
person see a glimmer of light as it would to get the kid(s) onto to <br/>
higher education or a career.<br/>
<br/>
How does one deal with the negative input?<br/>
