<div id="ygrps-yiv-796440860">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that the Subject accurately describes the contents, but here it goes.....Davan&#39;s lately had some problems with a friend of hers, Willa.  They are both 5, have known each other about a year and primarily see each other at a weekly play group.  In the last couple months, though, there have been issues.<br/>
<br/>
Davan is the sort of kid who yells when upset.  So, when something goes wrong at play group, she yells at the other kids.  The other kids, meanwhile, either get quiet and retreat or come to their mom&#39;s when they get upset, so Davan&#39;s pretty different in that.  Willa told her mom, just as the trouble between her and Davan started, that she was upset about Davan&#39;s yelling and just doesn&#39;t know what to do.  Willa&#39;s mom relayed this to me, to which I said that I knew the yelling was a problem and we do try to work on it and I pretty much didn&#39;t know what to tell her.  Her mom said, &quot;We value your friendships and we aren&#39;t going anywhere, but it&#39;s a problem.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Sense this conversation, Willa has ignored Davan or outright told her that she wanted to play with Ellie (another girl at play group) and not Davan.  Davan will ask her a question and Willa will just turn away.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s desirable behavior, either, but Davan and I seem to be the only ones it bothers, where as Davan&#39;s yelling is obviously a problem to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Davan and I have taken a bit of a break from the playgroup due to a trip out of town and Memorial Day happening.  So, it had been 3 weeks sense we were last at playgroup and the dynamic had been Davan being left out of the Davan/Ellie/Willa group at the last two playgroups prior to our break.  Davan had had a bit of a hard time with this, but did okay with just playing with me.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was out first day back and things came to a head for me.  Davan and Ellie were playing very well together and Willa was feeling left out, even though Davan and Ellie had invited her to play with them.  It was fairly obvious that Willa wanted Ellie to play with her alone without Davan.  Eventually, the three of them, plus Griffon (Willa&#39;s 3 year old brother) were playing upstairs while the adults were all downstairs with the babies.  We heard someone crying - it sounded like a baby and we all looked around to make sure non of them had gone up the stairs, but they were all with us.  Willa&#39;s mom thought it was Griffon, at that point and took off up the stairs.  <br/>
<br/>
It was Willa.  Willa told her mom that &quot;they&quot; had put something around her neck and were pulling, strangling her.  Willa&#39;s mom told the kids that was totally unacceptable and brought the crying and very distressed looking/sounding Willa downstairs with her.  The feeling was, obviously, that Willa was telling the complete truth and that Davan was responsible.  I even bought into it, much to my shame!  Even Ellie was saying, &quot;It was Davan&#39;s plan!  It was Davan&#39;s plan!&quot; over and over.  I accused Davan of putting her robe tie (which she&#39;d been wearing around her waste, but was then off) around Willa&#39;s neck, which Davan denied.  Davan told me, &quot;I don&#39;t even want to talk to someone as silly as you!&quot; and turned away.  While I wish she&#39;d just told me outright what had happened, I can&#39;t blame her for this, as I was unjustly accusing her.<br/>
<br/>
She ended up telling me (and this was later collaborated by Ellie and Willa, both) that Willa was pretending to sleep on the couch and Ellie and Davan were trying to wake her up.  This escalated to them trying to pull her off the couch by her shirt.  The interesting thing here is that Davan was not touching Willa at all.  It had, apparently, been Davan&#39;s plan to pull Willa off the couch (thus Ellie&#39;s mantra), but it was most definitely Ellie pulling on Willa.  I guess that the shirt being pulling was tight around her neck.  However, no one ever put anything around Willa&#39;s neck and Davan never hurt her.<br/>
<br/>
After Ellie apologized and I was still talking to Davan about what had happened, Ellie and Willa went off to play together.  When Davan showed up, saying she was sorry to Willa (which she chose to do because Willa was so upset).  Willa again just ignored Davan.  Ellie invited Davan to join in their play and Davan agreed.  Willa then told Davan, &quot;My nose was bleeding from being strangled!&quot;  Which was simply untrue.  The other moms showed up where the girls were playing in time to hear Ellie&#39;s version (identical to Davan&#39;s) about what had happened and Willa then said that they hadn&#39;t put anything around her neck, after all.<br/>
<br/>
Willa&#39;s mom then said, as if to find something to blame Davan for, &quot;It sounds like they didn&#39;t put anything around Willa&#39;s neck.  When I was bringing Willa downstairs, though, Davan said, &#39;Yeah!  Take her away!  We don&#39;t want to play with a crybaby!&quot;  Now, this isn&#39;t a nice thing to say, but in light of what was an attention getting move on Willa&#39;s part, maybe wasn&#39;t that off base.  We are working on not using hurtful names, just like the yelling.  Davan does forget in the heat of the moment, though.<br/>
<br/>
Whew!  This has turned out much longer than I expected!  I was just going to say that Davan had trouble with a friend, causing both the friend&#39;s mom and myself to often assume Davan was the one &quot;doing wrong&quot;.  I decided after yesterday, after this last incident, that this isn&#39;t a good situation for Davan to be in and we were not going to go to playgroup anymore because of this situation.  When I told Ellie&#39;s mom of this, but that we would like to see Ellie another time during the week, she was supportive if I felt I needed to do it for Davan&#39;s sake.  <br/>
<br/>
However, she then started talking about homeschool moms keeping their kid&#39;s sheltered from kids that they have trouble with.  That maybe one thing that was good about public school is that kids have to work things out with kids they don&#39;t get along with and that prepares them for getting along with co-workers they don&#39;t like later.  What do you think about this?  I&#39;m thinking that it might be easier to learn to get along with unpleasant co-workers if you have a solid foundation of acceptance in childhood, but maybe I&#39;m thinking faultily.  I also feel like this isn&#39;t just a problem with not getting along, but of Davan being in a situation where she&#39;s the &quot;bad one&quot; in the eyes of the other kid&#39;s parent and sometimes even mine when I&#39;m with them.  This can&#39;t be good for her.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve poured this all out.  Thanks for making it this far and I&#39;d appreciate some feedback.  Does it seem like I&#39;m off-base taking Davan out of this situation?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
I think school doesn&#39;t help these kinds of situations. Not many teachers<br/>
take the time, or have the time to talk to the children and resolve the<br/>
problems. So the kids either pick on other kids and become bullies, or<br/>
ignore them completely and turn the kids into &quot;nerds.&quot;  Meaning someone<br/>
uncool that they won&#39;t hang with. Or sometimes the left out child will<br/>
become bothered enough by being left out and do what she has to become cool<br/>
and included. Not great either.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see where children at 5 have the skills they need to handle<br/>
situations like this all on their own like an adult would in a working<br/>
situation.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re off-base. There seems to be a problem with the <br/>
three girl dynamic right now. There&#39;s nothng wrong with the girls <br/>
playing one on one for awhile. Groups, especially groups of three, <br/>
can be hard.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we need to keep our kids in stressful situations to <br/>
help them learn. Your daughter may very well need the time away from <br/>
the group to process what happened.<br/>
<br/>
As far as getting along when she&#39;s older and working...I know that <br/>
I&#39;d leave a job if the people were impossible to deal with. Life&#39;s to <br/>
short to suffer fools.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re off base.  I took my 4.5 year old son out of a play <br/>
situation on our block for a while because one friend was being too mean.  The <br/>
hitting didn&#39;t bother me as much as the whispering of religious stuff in his ear. <br/>
 Yesterday three of the neighborhood boys were playing together for a while, <br/>
my son was one of them.  The other two were making him chase them and then <br/>
pretending to shoot him.  After a long while he came over to me, his sister and a <br/>
three year old next door (moving topsoil in a wheelbarrow, great fun!) and <br/>
told me that he didn&#39;t want to play with them anymore because they were being <br/>
mean.  When the other boys showed up a few minutes later asking for Nathan I <br/>
told them that he had gone inside for lemonaide and didn&#39;t want to play with them <br/>
because he thought they were being mean to him.  They went off and then came <br/>
back and decided to apologize.<br/>
<br/>
I think 5 is young to figure out how to get along in a group.  Groups of <br/>
three are always rough.  She needs your help and protection.  As far as the <br/>
comment about homeschooling mom&#39;s protecting their kids too much, I have to wonder <br/>
why anyone would find this a bad thing!  Protecting them, helping them find <br/>
their way, giving them the opportunity to live without the stress of forced <br/>
interpersonal relationships, that&#39;s my job!<br/>

I think you are 100% right for leaving the group.<br/>
If you are in a group and the parents think your child is a &quot;bad one&quot; your <br/>
child will never get a break.<br/>
<br/>
School doesn&#39;t prepare one to deal with much of anything other than an attack <br/>
back.  I have a sister who attended Private catholic schools all her <br/>
schooling years. She is now 19 and cannot deal with anything.  She cannot hold a job, <br/>
complains about no one helping her and attacks me at every turn.  I even took <br/>
her in twice and she stayed a month turned our home and family up side down <br/>
and left. She says the F word to anyone and everyone she has no clue.  <br/>
<br/>
Public schools dont work anything out and they do not see everything. Did you <br/>
ever see the John Stosel /20/20(sp) show about Bullies? <br/>
<br/>
I also think that once you add a third child to the mix there is often <br/>
issues. <br/>

child and was not in a situation where I was enjoying myself I would leave.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think it is at all bad to not be with this person Willa.  As adults we are <br/>
around friends that we get along with.  We don&#39;t put ourselves, voluntarily, <br/>
with people we don&#39;t &quot;like&quot; (for lack of a better work).  I don&#39;t consider it <br/>
sheltering.  I considering it respecting a child&#39;s wishes.  My boys choose if <br/>
they want to go to playgroup or not.  I go for them.  But if I wanted adult <br/>
conversation I always have other options.  <br/>
<br/>
If I were working outside the home I would not be working with people I did <br/>
not like.  I have left a job in the past because of a stressful work <br/>
environment.  I think we are so programmed that you have to put up with stressful <br/>
coworkers and we accept it.<br/>
<br/>
When we have playgroup it is always at a place where the children are in <br/>
view.  Of course my boys are still young.  That helps.  If I saw a situation <br/>
starting it is easy to step in and redirect things.  They are young.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of thoughts.<br/>

<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>
<time> 3 Jun 2003, at  8:29pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642185932">Along these same lines, I want to interject that there is hope.  This is a little long, so I apologize in advance.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old daughter and her neighbor friend (who is 10) grew up together and are both very competitive.  Over the years I knew this child was lying about a lot of things, often in an effort to either control my daughter or to control how my daughter&#39;s other friends perceive my daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
During these times I gave my daughter strategies for handling the situations and often reminded her that she does not have to put up with this stuff, but she might not want to burn any bridges.  After all, at this age, friends grow together, apart, and together again.  Sometimes my daughter would &quot;take a break&quot; for awhile, but they always reunited.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, fortunately, her mother and I have a very good friendship.  Awhile ago, as the girls were getting older, we decided that we would stay out of the girls&#39; problems getting along.  We would be there to listen to each of them complain, and we would offer support and suggestions for how to solve the problem.  But we would not intervene. We&#39;ve been doing this for about 2? years now. This seems to be working pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Just this week, they have been fighting again, more nasty lies, etc.  These two are supposed to go to resident camp together in a few weeks.  This could be a REAL problem.  (They signed up as &quot;buddies&quot;).  So, my daughter and I talked about this.  She came up with a few ideas for solutions.  Then she went to her friend and mentioned to her that she wasn&#39;t sure they should go together to camp since they will probably fight the whole time, to which the other girl agreed that was a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
After they had talked a bit about it, I called the mom.  She was already aware that the two had been fighting a lot, and I think she must have been aware that my daughter was thinking about canceling the camping thing.  In fact, her daughter had asked *her* to call *me* but she wanted to wait until I called her.  I take it as a compliment that she trusted me to call her...and didn&#39;t feel the need to jump on the phone and get upset.<br/>
<br/>
She and I discussed it and she was perfectly ok with whatever my daughter decided, agreeing that it could be a bad thing if they go together.  I discussed my daughter&#39;s ideas with her and asked her what she thought.  We decided to let the girls discuss it on their own some more and try to come up with their own solution.<br/>
<br/>
The girls have since decided they will go together as buddies, but *they* will tell the counselors ahead of time that if they start fighting, the counselors should separate them.<br/>
<br/>
I thought that was a pretty mature way to handle it and try to keep everyone happy...on both their parts.  In fact, the friend&#39;s response was &quot;I think we should work our problem out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
BUT, it definitely requires parents who are on the same page and who can support each other even when their kids are hurting each other.  We have to put our mother bear instincts on the back burner long enough to help our kids work their own problems out...and granted, our kids are a little older than the kids in the original situation.<br/>
<br/>
SOOOO, in spite of the difficulties, and the many things we differ on, she is a rare gem of a friend to me.   (She always has her best face on, and refuses to hand wash dishes, while I&#39;m raishing a pig and chickens in my back yard (she got a big kick out of telling her family about that LOL).<br/>
<br/>
We both hope our friendship is an example to our girls that its ok to be different with different values, and still be really good friends.<br/>

  around friends that we get along with.  We don&#39;t put ourselves, voluntarily, <br/>
  with people we don&#39;t &quot;like&quot; (for lack of a better work).  I don&#39;t consider it <br/>
  sheltering.  I considering it respecting a child&#39;s wishes.  My boys choose if <br/>
  they want to go to playgroup or not.  I go for them.  But if I wanted adult <br/>
  conversation I always have other options.  <br/>
<br/>
  If I were working outside the home I would not be working with people I did <br/>
  not like.  I have left a job in the past because of a stressful work <br/>
  environment.  I think we are so programmed that you have to put up with stressful <br/>
  coworkers and we accept it.<br/>
<br/>
  When we have playgroup it is always at a place where the children are in <br/>
  view.  Of course my boys are still young.  That helps.  If I saw a situation <br/>
  starting it is easy to step in and redirect things.  They are young.<br/>
<br/>
  Just a couple of thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-359268332">Thanks to everyone who responded to my playgroup problem.  I appreciate the support for my decision to protect Davan from this dynamic and this suggestion:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can you think of a 4th child that&#39;d like to join the group? :o)  You could <br/>
&gt;even provide transportation if the parent can&#39;t make it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is actually, a fourth child right in the same age group as the three girls, as well as the younger brother and the babies, all who are regulars plus others who come on occasion.  These three are just always at the center of things.  They&#39;ve had times where that worked out okay, but not anymore!  <br/>
<br/>
I spoke with the other mom (Willa&#39;s mom, for those who might remember her name) this afternoon and she had also decided to pull out of playgroup to protect her child.  As I&#39;d already made other arrangements with the host mom, she&#39;s staying and Davan and I will see Ellie, the third in the triangle on another day of the week.  Davan&#39;s not very close with the other children in that group, so doesn&#39;t mind not seeing them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; That maybe one thing that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was good about public school is that kids have to work things out with kids <br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t get along with and that prepares them for getting along with <br/>
&gt; co-workers they don&#39;t like later.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been to school, I&#39;ve had co-workers I didn&#39;t like.<br/>
I have a kid who hasn&#39;t been to school.  He has had co-workers he didn&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
I think he handles it better than I did for a deep and real-life reason:  I <br/>
had a &quot;this is just for one year&quot;  mentality (school-learned), while he has a <br/>
&quot;this is normal real life, and I need to figure out how to make things as <br/>
smooth as I can make them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In school it&#39;s not really a kid&#39;s job to make his life smooth.  Every time he <br/>
turns around he is pulled OUT of some comfortable situation to be put in a <br/>
new and strange set of people with new rules.   Kids change teachers and classes <br/>
more often than my 16 year old son has changed jobs and co-workers.   <br/>
Schoolkids don&#39;t NEED a longrange view.  They can piss in their own pool and then go <br/>
off to college.  And after college, go off to wherever.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby doesn&#39;t seem to have that mentality.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I was in a small town.  I still know people I grew up with. <br/>
<br/>
I thought Albuquerque wouldn&#39;t be that way, for my kids, but they DO keep <br/>
socializing with people they&#39;ve known since they were little, partly because of <br/>
homeschooling or other commonalities, but partly because it turns out that for <br/>
those who are open and accepting of it, the world isn&#39;t so six-billion-people <br/>
as it is those we have made connections with, and the connections branching <br/>
off from that, and curling back around into it.  Each individual life has themes <br/>
and patterns, and people can be drawn to that energy and those interests and <br/>
commitments and it IS possible to live as though you aren&#39;t going to move <br/>
again in a year and abandon all you&#39;ve known.<br/>
<br/>
Around the end of July or early August, I think, Kirby will have had the same <br/>
job for three years.  I know adults who&#39;ve never had the same job for three <br/>
years.  <br/>
<br/>
There are doubtless lots of factors, but a to the school-honored theory that <br/>
school will train people to get along on the job, I think that&#39;s just frosting <br/>
on a cake going bad.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You are right about this Sandra.  In the case of my daughter&#39;s friend, I had them talk to each other because that is what my daughter wanted.  I talked to her mom because in this particular situation I knew I could.<br/>
<br/>
But with other kids who have been here, I have confronted kids and told them they need to go home unless or until they can stop x behavior.  <br/>
<br/>
What I find happens so much of the time here though is that many of the friends deny any wrong doing, or my own kids don&#39;t really want the friend to leave so I feel as though my hands are tied.  Sometimes my kids put up with it simply because there is nobody else to play with and its a trade off.<br/>
<br/>
Other times, these are the kids my kids PREFER to play with!<br/>
<br/>
What I cannot understand, and I truly mean this, is why the vast majority of my kids&#39; friends have so many issues.  Its like we are a magnet for this stuff.  Of all the &quot;friends&quot; they have, very few are simply &quot;nice kids&quot; that don&#39;t have a ton of baggage attatched.  The vast majority all have behavior or discipline problems of one kind or another, and its not just the schools that are the cause.<br/>
<br/>
And the older ones are getting harder to persuade in a kind way to behave appropriately.  Some of them think everything is a big joke when I try to talk to them in a nice way.  I don&#39;t like the idea that these kids don&#39;t take *any* authority figure seriously.  I don&#39;t think of myself as an &quot;authority figure&quot;, but this is *our* home and I definitely feel taken advantage of lately.<br/>
<br/>
Its getting to the point where I&#39;m feeling the need to limit friendships in order to save my own kids from being dragged down with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585662751">I just wanted to share our experience yesterday about a group of almost five <br/>
year old boys and the play dynamics.  I took Sandra&#39;s advice about talking <br/>
directly to the kids to heart and it seemed to really help.<br/>
<br/>
The boy we&#39;ve had trouble with has had a babysitter every afternoon for weeks <br/>
now and it brings his behavior to an unacceptable point.  Nathan went outside <br/>
while I was getting Julia&#39;s shoes on, so I followed him to a yard two doors <br/>
down.  He had already made it back but when I got there I heard the neighbor <br/>
boy, Luke, telling another &quot;Let&#39;s chase Nathan and scare him.&quot;  I told Luke that <br/>
Nathan really liked playing with him, but that he needed to be nicer to him <br/>
or he would decide not to play.  I said that being mean and hitting and <br/>
pinching were not allowed in our family and that if he wanted to play with us, he <br/>
needed to leave that at home.  I then found Nathan at a different backyard and <br/>
told him what Luke and I had talked about.<br/>
<br/>
The kids played together for a while, but Nathan wanted to joust and none of <br/>
the other kids really were interested.  So he and Julia jousted a bit (running <br/>
on hobby horses towards each other and then falling on the ground) and then <br/>
tried to play with the other kids.  <br/>
<br/>
We worked it out.  They played together when they wanted to, didn&#39;t when they <br/>
weren&#39;t interested.  The meanness was minimized because Luke kept looking to <br/>
see if I was noticing what he was doing.  And Nathan felt like I was <br/>
understanding him and standing up for him.<br/>
<br/>
Later I learned that this poor Luke actually has a latch up high on the <br/>
outside of his bedroom door so that he cannot leave during nap our bed time.  <br/>
Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had some rainy weather here for a while and before that we had a huge <br/>
dirt pile in our driveway (now we have a mudslick), so playing with this <br/>
particular neighbor hasn&#39;t been an option for a couple of weeks.  His parents don&#39;t <br/>
let him get dirty.  The distance helped, and now the intervention will <br/>
hopefully model for Nathan how to express his needs on his own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372244697">I had some luck too yesterday, with the younger set.  I ended up sending one friend home.  <br/>
<br/>
The incident involved both the friend *and* my youngest daughter so I told them that if they want to play together they are *both* going to have to behave.  I sent the friend home to make it clear that inappropriate behavior from *either* of them would not be allowed.  THey got to play together later in the day though...and all was fine.<br/>
<br/>
As for the older set, the friends haven&#39;t been here in a couple of days, maybe because I had to be stern the other day.  Thats fine with me.<br/>

hopefully model for Nathan how to express his needs on his own.<br/>

outside of his bedroom door so that he cannot leave during nap our bed time.  <br/>
Yikes. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That should be illegal.<br/>
<br/>
Some people I know secondarily were going through a divorce.  She was living <br/>
with a childless male friend of mine who knew ZIP about kids and cared less.  <br/>
Not a good house for the kids to be in, really.  He/husband was living with <br/>
another woman who did want kids but didn&#39;t have any yet.  That&#39;s where the two <br/>
little kids&#39; rooms were.  <br/>
<br/>
I found out he had turned the doorknobs around so they could lock them from <br/>
the outside but the kids couldn&#39;t lock them from the inside.<br/>
<br/>
Though I was pretty disgusted with everyone involved.  Oh.  The husband was <br/>
also fooling with the girlfriend of yet another friend of mine, in threesome <br/>
fashion one way or another, so I knew every person in the story.  Soap opera in <br/>
my own back yard (as usual).<br/>
<br/>
I sent the message through the middle friend that if I ever heard they had <br/>
locked those kids in their room I would just call social services and they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have custody problems any more.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing there IS a law against it, at least in some places, because if <br/>
the house got on fire the kid couldn&#39;t get out.  Or even if something just <br/>
happened to the parent, stroke or sudden incapacitation of some sort.<br/>

Poor little guy! What if he has to make peepee? Or gets sick, or has a<br/>
bad dream. Do they use it all the time, or is it a punishment thing? I<br/>
bet it feels like punishment to him. He must feel untrusted and<br/>
untrustworthy. Poor little guy.<br/>

If it isn&#39;t against the law, it should be.  I remember the mom telling me <br/>
when the kid was out of the crib that she considered tying him to the bed, that&#39;s <br/>
what her husband&#39;s mother did.  I gave her some sort of &quot;oh, you can&#39;t be <br/>
serious&quot; answer and forgot about it.  But when I heard about the latch yesterday, <br/>
I felt awful for correcting the kid on anything!  He needs so much, he just <br/>
needs.  I can&#39;t imagine a night when my almost 5 year old doesn&#39;t climb in bed <br/>
with us.<br/>

department in CA, we were not even allowed to lock juvenile jail cells!  So I doubt <br/>
it&#39;s OK for any children.  <br/>
