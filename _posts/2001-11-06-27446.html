&gt; magic wands, boas, all the fantasy stuff is in the<br/>
&gt; &quot;girl&#39;s&quot; isles......all the UGLY monsters and drooling<br/>
&gt; dinosaurs and neutered (well, they are) fighting<br/>
&gt; &quot;action&quot; figures, tanks, and all in sizes that you<br/>
&gt; have to sit down to play with.  Very few real<br/>
&gt; play-with-move-your-body-around-fun-things...so<br/>
&gt; nothing that is really attractive to anybody.  A child<br/>
&gt; that appreciates beauty at all is forced to go to the<br/>
&gt; &quot;girls&quot; toys isles.  At least in Walmart...the only<br/>
&gt; &quot;toy&quot; store within 50 miles of our home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Skate board, bicycles, kayaks, tents, hot-air<br/>
&gt; balloons, gliders, kites, other really fun stuff come<br/>
&gt; in ALL colors.<br/>

department...things like tee shirts and some pants. That was because the <br/>
girls&#39; clothes came in lots of colors, but the boys&#39; things only came in dull <br/>
colors, or had either sports or military themes.<br/>
