&lt;&lt; I think people should spend at least as much time with their kids as the <br/>

I have a question about this.  Maybe I have become an island, not sure.  But <br/>
I&#39;m wondering how I would fill 6 hours/day?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What I mostly mean is that I hate it when people think they can just furnish <br/>
their kids a house and some books and then ignore them while they/kids <br/>
&quot;unschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If parents think it will take less effort and involvement than <br/>
school-at-home, then it makes me want to tell them to put their kids back in <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Your description of your day sounds plenty involved!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I mean, my kids like to be on the computer chatting, or playing games...for <br/>
hours.  But that doesn&#39;t include me, other than I ask them how its going and <br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And they are involved in outside activities, but again, that doesn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily include me other than I support them and cheer for them and drive <br/>
them and pay for it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And they like to watch movies, and I watch with them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot.  You&#39;re there, and they&#39;re doing lots of things with you <br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is this what you  mean when you say the above?  Our lives sound very <br/>
&quot;passively&quot; involved though.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe passive in that you didn&#39;t direct their activities yourself, but not <br/>
&quot;uninvolved&quot; as some parents seem to think unschooling parents can be.<br/>
<br/>
The longer people go the deeper the parental involvement/knowledge/connection <br/>
becomes even when the kids aren&#39;t even physically present.  It&#39;s hard to <br/>
describe.  Maybe some of us should try!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll think about it and come back to this.<br/>
<br/>
Because when I write &quot;six hours&quot; I really think inside &quot;24 hours&quot; but that <br/>
scares the peeweedles out of some newer unschoolers who maybe used to spend <br/>
four hours &quot;doing school&quot; at the table. (Or on the couch if they were really <br/>
liberal. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We do talk a lot and share  lots of information together too.<br/>

I know we do get in ruts sometimes though and I want to perk things up some <br/>

I also think it isn&#39;t 6 hours of hands on interaction with your child doing <br/>
things with them.  It is more of time available.  Where you are physically <br/>
near and mentally open to your child.  You would stop what you are doing and <br/>
answer questions or take your child to the library if that is what they <br/>
needed.  <br/>

<br/>
I meant to respond to this and I deleted it by accident.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the clarification on this.  It makes much more sense I think.  I hope you do come back to it.  I&#39;d like to hear more about what you have to think about this (and anyone else too).<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t help feeling like I&#39;m not doing &quot;enough&quot;.  Do you ever feel like you&#39;re slacking off, even if your kids seem happy?  Or maybe I&#39;m just feeling guilty for not &quot;teaching&quot;.  (One of my avid joys is teaching others &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
For example, my kids sometimes say that they are bored and thats why they are on the computer so much.  Yet, when there ARE friends here, they are STILL on the computer playing the same games.  I have to suggest to them that they have visitors and perhaps they should either share the game or go do something else.<br/>
<br/>
So, I take it from that that they are not *really* bored or that boredom is not the reason they are playing those games.  But what they say and what they do send confusing messages to me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an avid reader.  I love to read.  I explore most of my own interests through reading, online, in books, or on TV.  I&#39;m online a lot, or I used to be before 3 kids took it over &lt;grin&gt;.  I used to feel guilty about enjoying tv movies, and online chat, but not anymore.  I LOVE a good story.<br/>
<br/>
The computer is my doorway to the whole wide world and I find it so exciting.  When my kids are online chatting and calling friends from other states, etc...sometimes I worry that my example is hurting them.  Are they spending *too* much time online...etc.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow I feel like I&#39;m not broadening their horizons enough.  I&#39;m very interested in the SCA, but I can&#39;t seem to get started...its a lot of information at once, or it seems like it is.  (I think I need to contact the right person..I forget who it is but I&#39;ll double check).  Maybe if I had one person who could walk me through the process....(sigh).  I know my kids would probably love the SCA, at least my girls would.   We have a Renaissance Fair here every year...and we&#39;ve never been there. I hope to get there this year.  They recently went to see the play Camelot with my mother.<br/>
<br/>
And we are very involved in Girl Scouts which has helped a lot for my girls, but that doesn&#39;t help my son.   He&#39;s into wiring, technical theater etc...I&#39;m just not quite sure how to make the contacts and then the days get away from me and it seems like it slips away.  Major guilt trip on mom here.   Does that happen to you guys?<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a tough balance to introduce new things and also to step back and wait for what they might show an interest in.  Its also tought to &quot;get on it&quot; in the midst of an already busy life.  How do you do it and maintain that healthy balance?<br/>

&lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My problem is a little different.  I was way too hands-off when Lars was<br/>
younger.  I thought you just set up a house with interesting stuff and the<br/>
kid eventually picked it up.  Trouble is, I set up the house to be the<br/>
perfect unschooling house . . . for me.  Lars never picked up any of those<br/>
books I left around.  That&#39;s not how he learns.  (I had still thought that<br/>
he would learn from books once he learned to read . . .not.)<br/>
<br/>
So now it&#39;s much harder to &quot;insert&quot; myself back into his life.  Being 15,<br/>
he&#39;s not all that keen for me to do that.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; So, I take it from that that they are not *really* bored or that boredom<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is not the reason they are playing those games.  But what they say and what<br/>
they do send confusing messages to me.<br/>
<br/>
This is one that&#39;s familiar to me.  Lars talks about wanting to do more<br/>
academic stuff, but I realize now that&#39;s his friends and society talking,<br/>
not him.  He had said he wanted to go for a diploma through the program he&#39;s<br/>
registered with.  I agreed to help him even though I don&#39;t think he needs<br/>
(or really wants) a diploma.  Just the other day he finally admitted that<br/>
he&#39;d like a diploma but doesn&#39;t want to sit down and do the work involved.<br/>
So now we&#39;re concentrating more on the kinds of things he might like to do<br/>
as he gets older and what the minimum requirements might be.  For instance,<br/>
a lot of vocational programs at the community college here only have<br/>
requirements for certain courses, like a certain math level.  I&#39;m sure we<br/>
can find a way to document what he knows in those areas without his actually<br/>
taking a course in them.  So we&#39;re making some progress.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&quot;get on it&quot; in the midst of an already busy life.  How do you do it and<br/>
maintain that healthy balance?<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I have a hard time with is getting used to lots of time to<br/>
do my thing when he doesn&#39;t want my involvement, then making the switch to<br/>
helping him when I&#39;m in the middle of something of my own.  When he wants to<br/>
do something, he wants to do it now.  I&#39;ve put him off till later enough<br/>
times to know that he&#39;ll just lose interest in whatever it was by the time I<br/>
get around to it.  So I have been working on getting around to it sooner.<br/>
It&#39;s not an easy balance for me.  I do best at getting my own stuff<br/>
(writing, housework, etc.) done when it&#39;s part of a routine.  When my<br/>
routine gets interrupted, it&#39;s hard for me to get back to it.  But that&#39;s my<br/>
stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89229611">Just thought I would write a little about myself and<br/>
my kids, since I have been reading the messeges for<br/>
about a week now.  I have two kids, ages 5 and 2.  I<br/>
started homeschooling the oldest last year.  He went<br/>
through the Kingergarden curriculum in a flash.  (Some<br/>
of you might know or remember me from the messege<br/>
boards)  When I tried to start some harder stuff with<br/>
him, he ended up hating the school activies.  And part<br/>
of it was my fault of course.  I probably pushed him<br/>
too hard and expected too much from him.  So I have<br/>
dropped the school work for the rest of the year and<br/>
summer at least.  I guess I will decide after that<br/>
what to do.  I was planning on doing this virtual<br/>
charter school with him next year, but we will wait<br/>
and see.  I do not know why I feel such a need to<br/>
&#39;teach him&#39;.  It is not like he has any problems<br/>
learning on his own.  He has pretty much taught<br/>
himself how to read.  I bought the hooked on phonics<br/>
program, but that seemed to bore him and it wasn&#39;t<br/>
long before he was reading words not even on that at<br/>
his level.  So lately I have been letting them both do<br/>
pretty much what they want.  I do sometimes initiate<br/>
activities, but I never make either of them do<br/>
anything anymore.  I hardest part for me has been me<br/>
not feeling bad because I feel like I am not doing<br/>
enough.  Also, sometimes it is hard for me to get<br/>
involved in what they are doing.  So I have been<br/>
trying to do one thing with them a day.  Like play a<br/>
game or watch a movie or something like that.  And<br/>
sometimes it is hard for me to pay attention to<br/>
everything the oldest is saying to me.  He talks non<br/>
stop sometimes, but I am getting much better at<br/>
stopping what I am doing and looking at him and<br/>
responding to him.  Anyway, I guess this has gotten<br/>
long enough.  My main point being that this has been<br/>
as much of a learning experience to me as it has been<br/>
for them.  And I think I am stating to relate better<br/>
with my oldest son.<br/>

Hi, Tia -<br/>
<br/>
The HSC Home=Education Conference is smack in the middle of August,<br/>
starting the evening of Friday the 15th and continuing until about 5pm<br/>
on Sunday the 17th.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t actively ill-wish your son&#39;s sports team (honest!), but it would<br/>
be GREAT if you could come.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you crazy enough to want to drive all the way south from BC to <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the<br/>

writers conference in the fall.  And my car just blew a head gasket.  It&#39;s<br/>
going to cost $1100 to fix that.  Somehow I can&#39;t see any extra money being<br/>
available.  But maybe I&#39;ll buy a lottery ticket or two.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
