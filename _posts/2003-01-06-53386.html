&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;From what I remember of the Ned debate, people weren&#39;t responding to his<br/>
&gt;opinions and thinking about them.  Those tons of responses were mostly<br/>
&gt;telling him to go take his agenda elsewhere, where there would be a positive<br/>
&gt;reception.  His posts felt like spam to me.  So Yol, would you be happy if<br/>
&gt;the list were also opened to spammers?<br/>
&gt;We have lots of religious discussions, but as far as I know, people aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;allowed to come on here and start trying to convert others to their<br/>
&gt;religion.  That&#39;s what a lot of Ned&#39;s posts sounded like to me.  Should we<br/>
&gt;open the list to religious proselytizing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excuse me, but the post you are referring to was not mine. I haven&#39;t <br/>
expressed any opinion about it either.<br/>
