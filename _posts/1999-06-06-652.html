<div id="ygrps-yiv-406950180">Hi, well... I&#39;ve got my 5 1/2 year old and a 3 1/2 year old.  My oldest one<br/>
is about to start first grade level stuff... my 3 year old, is<br/>
pre-preschool.. hehe :)  The only way I can deal with homeschooling my older<br/>
one while having my younger one around is I have things for him to do that<br/>
are as similar to his brother as possible.  He has papers that he writes on<br/>
while we do spelling and writing, he does flash cards with his brother (he<br/>
just has to tell me what the color or picture is of, where his older brother<br/>
tells me what letter it starts with or something along that line),I will<br/>
also switch them working on the computer as well... one will play for 30<br/>
mins and then it&#39;s the other&#39;s turn, usually schoolish style of programs.<br/>
<br/>
As for time for myself... well, that&#39;s extremely difficult in this<br/>
household.  I&#39;m a single mom and we live with my mother and older sister.<br/>
There&#39;s not a lot of chances for me to have time to myself.  My mother does<br/>
help out and watches the boys for me as often as she can... but I don&#39;t want<br/>
to take advantage of that either.   It&#39;s a hard thing to do, to find time<br/>
for yourself, time for friends or anything else... but I feel it&#39;s worth the<br/>
little bit of sacrifice now.  They won&#39;t be with me forever, and if I can<br/>
raise two good men for this world... then it will be well worth my LOONG<br/>
vacation after they are on their own... LOL!!  hehehehe... I&#39;m gonna do<br/>
everything in MY power to make sure these two boys are independently<br/>
wealthy!! hehehe, then I&#39;ll go.. ya know I think  you two owe me a<br/>
retirement!  hehehehe  :)<br/>
