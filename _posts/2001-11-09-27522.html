<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950697599">Hi folks. I am unschooling my daughter age 4 yrs. She has so called &#39;special<br/>
educational needs&#39; but in my opinion this label only matters if they are in<br/>
school. I was pretty confident in my philosophy with the fact that because<br/>
of her differences she needs less teaching/structure not more - my instinct<br/>
tells me that I really need to flow with her in what ever she is into and<br/>
let her develop at her own pace. Everyone I speak to about it though<br/>
(family, health professionals) are advising me that because of her &#39;sen&#39; she<br/>
needs more structure and needs to be pushed more. Perhaps I should have<br/>
mentioned that she has &#39;developmental delay&#39; or &#39;learning difficulties&#39;<br/>
which ever you want to call it. Trouble is that we were already involved<br/>
with the pre-school teaching service for sen before we decided to unschool.<br/>
We recently put her in a nursery and was happy to leave her there for a few<br/>
more months as she likes it so much - it consisted of 2 hrs 3 times a week<br/>
of &#39;free play&#39;. Thing is now the pre-school teaching service have got<br/>
involved and have come up with a plan to try and &#39;tame her impulsiveness&#39;<br/>
and get her to &#39;follow routine&#39; and &#39;follow instructions&#39; and to curb her<br/>
&#39;obsessive play with one object&#39;. Now I&#39;m not worried enough to take her out<br/>
at the moment, I&#39;ll see how it goes, because knowing her as I do, she just<br/>
will not comply with their little schemes! I have very little support and<br/>
having a 7 mth old baby I welcome a couple of hours to catch up with myself.<br/>
(Does that sound selfish?) Does anyone unschool their special kids? I could<br/>
really use some assurance that I&#39;m going in the right direction, any<br/>
anecdotes that unschooling is the best way to bring out their true<br/>
potential. I have a feeling that the more they try to tame her the wilder<br/>
she&#39;ll get. I guess I&#39;ll be taking her out of nursery sooner rather than<br/>
later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696633632">find out all you can about your childs special needs. sound like you already<br/>
have instincts on how information is learned.<br/>
I would suggest if you have insurance to have some testing done privately,<br/>
and never rely on schools testing. Please beware that the special needs<br/>
in children can change before you know it, and then....you are stuck<br/>
trying to find help. I suggest to do it now with people you trust and are<br/>
willing to work with.<br/>
I am going through this myself. hindsight is always better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580302154">Hi Liese, sorry it took so long for me to respond, I&#39;m a little behind in my mail.<br/>
<br/>
I just started hsing my 8 year old son, took him out of school at the beginning of October (I also homeschooled him at 4, wish now that I hadn&#39;t put him back in school!)  He has Tourette Syndrome and Sensory Integration Dysfunction, plus has been dx&#39;d with a number of co-morbids to these conditions.  Since taking him home, none of this has much effect on his daily life.  He can discover his body at his own pace (SID can cause &quot;developmental delays&quot; but for my son, and I suspect for many kids, this has meant wildly fluctuating developmental progress, instead of an actual, falling behind delay.  I strongly suspect now that most &quot;delays&quot; where not caused by neural damage, are simply a slower rate of progress, not an absence of progress.)  His fine and gross motor skills have leaped ahead in only one month, because he doesn&#39;t have to spend most of his time at a desk or standing in line.  He needs a huge amount of physical exploration time, and pretty intense physical exploration at that (wrestling, swinging and spinning for hours, throwing himself on the ground, in OT speak this is &quot;vestibular and proprioceptive stimulation.&quot;)  His &quot;social defecits&quot; are not nearly as glaring to me at home as they seemed to be to the school staff as well.  He has opportunities to interact in more natural ways with people of different ages, and I now suspect that some of the social problems he&#39;s had came simply from trying to interact in a situation where nothing that he had learned up to then applied anymore, as well as the school staff attempts to keep children completely dependent on adults to resolve conflict (it was like a mantra in the school, &quot;tell the other child you don&#39;t like that, if they don&#39;t listen, get an adult&quot;, teaching children that if at first you don&#39;t succeed, give up and get somebody more competent than yourself.)<br/>
<br/>
The greatest gift of being at home is being able to redifine our family (I also have TS) as quirky, rather than neurologically disordered.  TS is a genetic disorder, and in my opinion, there are as many positives as negatives involved with having it, TSer&#39;s tend to be very funny, creative, anarchic, and I think the best thing that could happen to both of us is not to have to pretend to be &quot;normal&quot; anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what things are like in the States.  I got the distinct impression that my son&#39;s school was quite happy to get rid of us.  He wasn&#39;t labelled as &quot;developmentally delayed&quot; though.  I don&#39;t know if the school will give you a hard time, but I would suggest not going any further with elementary school after pre-K.  In my experience, once a child has been &quot;identified&quot; as needing service, they will stay on the special ed list, no matter how much progress they make, and staff will look far harder at that child for any sign of deviance from the norm, than they would with a neuro-typical student.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a member of an HS group for parents of special needs kids (mostly kids with diagnosed neurological disorders) through Yahoo groups, called HS-plus.  There are several parents on the list with dev. delayed children.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, <br/>
<br/>
Allison<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741304916">If you had read the entire post, instead of simply looking for something to disagree with, maybe you would have the answer to your own question.<br/>
<br/>
It was a problem for me, how about that.  It was a problem that staff told my son not to try to solve any problem on his own.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that, in your pleasant analogy, the next logical step was not throwing dog shit, but trying to find a different way to approach the problem with the neighbor, before calling the police, mediator, etc.  The problem was telling kids that they are not to try to solve problems on their own, period.  They were told &quot;say no, don&#39;t do anything else, don&#39;t try to reason, don&#39;t try to conciliate, don&#39;t try to compromise, just say no then walk away.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
Kids too often resort to violence and insult and destruction of property.  <br/>
Parents will sue. Or, worst case, kids get hurt or killed.   Children aren&#39;t <br/>
at school to have to deal with bullies on their own.  If you think that&#39;s <br/>
what school&#39;s for, maybe you could find a neighborhood bully for your <br/>
homeschooled child to practice on. <br/>
<br/>
I have always told my kids, who have never been to school, first try talking <br/>
about it.  If that doesn&#39;t help, get a grownup.  Hitting is the last resort, <br/>
NEVER before getting the intervention of an adult or older child.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are other families that tell their children to defend themselves <br/>
and their property physically and the parents will back them up.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833345904">I&#39;ll be taking the advice of others and just ignoring you from now on, because you are way more interested in proving a point than in having a discussion. You have completely missed what I was saying.  I was talking about ANY dispute, at all, not physical disputes (children at this school are not allowed to touch, not even to hug or hold hands.  Children get time outs for holding hands.  Does this sound normal or ok?  I don&#39;t think it sounds normal to any reasonable person.)<br/>
