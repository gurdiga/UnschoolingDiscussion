<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240911917">-=-I pretty much got sick to my stomach reading that post.   If only she <br/>
could see the wonderful things that have come from this unschooling life change.  <br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, the same day I read that we were lazy hedonists, this happened:<br/>
<br/>
The final day, graduation from the Junior Police Academy, they march in like <br/>
soldiers, doing face drills and filing in and pledging allegience (we briefed <br/>
Marty on that this week; he said he knew it from a humorous version in the <br/>
bathroom, just leave out the joke parts)...<br/>
<br/>
Ceremonial this&#39;n&#39;that, certificates, pins, Marty was awarded a certificate <br/>
as &quot;Top Gun&quot; (electronic target practice guns, F.A.T.S. and paintball guns) <br/>
which also came with $15 gift certificate to a sporting goods store.  Seven or <br/>
eight other kids (of 32) got awards like most pushups, most improved, most <br/>
physically fit male.<br/>
<br/>
Of Marty, I thought &quot;All that Nintendo Duck Hunt paid off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then we ate good local barbecue, served up by their instructors, and as <br/>
people were taking pictures and saying goodbye, I went up to one of his instructors <br/>
and sat to thank him.  He said Marty was just a joy to work with.  Chit chat <br/>
you&#39;d expect.<br/>
<br/>
Then he said the big thing.   (Brace yourselves.   And I really like the guy.)<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;You can always tell a kid who comes from a family with discipline, <br/>
with rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said Marty was really well behaved and enthusiastic and cooperative.  (I <br/>
wish I had the exact quotes there; I wish I had VIDEOTAPE.)<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;We hardly have any rules at our house.  We just tell them to always <br/>
make the best choice, to be helpful and not hurt people.&quot;  (That&#39;s maybe 85% <br/>
close to exact words; I need my audio back!)<br/>
<br/>
He said they had talked about a lot of things like that over the week.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to make light again, because it was maybe kinda tacky to counter <br/>
&quot;you can always tell&quot; with &quot;GOTCHA!  Wrong!  CAN&#39;T always tell.&quot;  So I said, <br/>
&quot;Y&#39;know, Monday was really his first day at school of any sort.   It was his first <br/>
day taking notes or anything like that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, right, he&#39;s homeschooled, right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Most of the homeschooled kids I&#39;ve met were not so good at social <br/>
interactions.  Marty&#39;s really confident and outgoing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told him he had gone home and re-written his notes from Monday, and had <br/>
been really focussed on his assignments and getting ready for the next day.  He <br/>
said &quot;Initiative!  Good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Probably there was nobody there who was as eager and excited to be there as <br/>
Marty was.  So we made some more sweet chitchat and that was it.  <br/>
<br/>
I could hardly wait to get into the van and close the doors so I could tell <br/>
Keith, Marty and Holly what he had said about discipline and rules.  We talked <br/>
about that most of the way home.  Holly can hardly believe that some people <br/>
think that rules upon rules will make people &quot;good&quot; away from home.  It just <br/>
makes no sense to her.   <br/>
<br/>
Marty said one of the kids got in bad trouble this afternoon, threatened with <br/>
being sent home, for throwing pieces of rubber at other kids, and for <br/>
throwing paintballs.  One broke on the exercise track.  NOT at the targets, where the <br/>
mess was supposed to be.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty couldn&#39;t fathom why someone would be at such a cool place and act that <br/>
way.  <br/>
<br/>
But Marty had also told me there were two people there who hadn&#39;t even wanted <br/>
to be there.  I didn&#39;t ask (yet) whether this kid was one of those.  Marty <br/>
was exhausted when he got home and went to bed at 10:00.<br/>
<br/>
This evidence is really important, that someone who works with kids a lot <br/>
(Police Athletic League volunteer), someone who&#39;s in law enforcement, sees an <br/>
enthusiastic, well-behaved, cooperative kid, and is confident that he came from a <br/>
house with discipline and rules.<br/>
<br/>
Discipline and rules?   All-fired flaming hedonists?  (Whatever the <br/>
accusation was.)<br/>
<br/>
Neither of the above.<br/>

Kelli,<br/>
If you save it, change that to &quot;a lot of discipline, and rules.&quot;   Marty has <br/>
corrected the quote for me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  This is sooo great!   And what a great job Marty did for not feeling <br/>
well.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He said he felt better as the day went on.  I think it&#39;s a cold, and colds <br/>
tend to do that, but I think adrenaline and distraction were good too.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda, thanks for this:  &quot;Sandra, you have such great kids!!! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the way home we took him by the gaming shop where Kirby was painting <br/>
miniatures, and the employees know Marty well, and four or five of the guys there <br/>
gaming are regular friends of his.  He was still in his academy uniform, and he <br/>
wore his hat in, and we were showing around the photo of all the students and <br/>
teachers posing in front of the police helicopter (already framed and on the <br/>
wall now), and his certificate of completion, and his certificate as Top Gun.  <br/>
 It was fun.  Like a ten minute reception.   I took photos of him there, too.<br/>
<br/>
He got his first &quot;schoolday&quot; and his first graduation ceremony all in one <br/>
week.  <br/>
<br/>
And we were both up and dressed by 7:00 on a Saturday.  NOT ideal, but <br/>
getting up all week determined for him to be there early to avoid pushups might <br/>
stick for another day or two.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Of Marty, I thought &quot;All that Nintendo Duck Hunt paid off.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the first thing I thought, video games, when you mentioned it!!! Good<br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I could hardly wait to get into the van and close the doors so I could<br/>

<br/>
I can just imagine who much you wanted to share that one!! Great story.<br/>
Thanks for sharing and what a great day for Marty.<br/>

<br/>
IF kids were robots, all this &quot;programming&quot; by rule MIGHT work.<br/>

PS  For Holly to believe a stupid rule, someone would have to program it<br/>
into her *before* she had the life experience to contradict it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82512938">This was wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
I really loved reading about Marty&#39;s adventures, and I hope there&#39;s a<br/>
place for your account of it on your website, as inspiration for parents<br/>
to help their kids do the things they want to do. <br/>
<br/>
Has he talked to you about whether he still thinks police work would be<br/>
interesting after his week at the academy?<br/>
