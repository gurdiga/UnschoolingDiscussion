 &quot; I&#39;ve wondered seriously, though, whether the kneading by hand from the<br/>
  beginning might be an important part of making the bread be &quot;right&quot; and<br/>
 good.  The  warmth of human hands to get the yeast going, the positive<br/>
human energy,<br/>
 maybe  the salt off people&#39;s skin, maybe who knows what off skin that we<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
 even  know, that has for thousands of years made bread good and real?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, yes, a thousand times yes! I totally think that bread machine bread is<br/>
a<br/>
 pale substitute for that which has been hand-kneaded (no offense to anyone<br/>
 here who has a bread maker &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ve been making my own bread for several years, and I find everything<br/>
about<br/>
 the process kinda mysterious and seductive (not to mention therapeutic).<br/>
 Family and friends who know I make my own bread have offered to buy me a<br/>
 bread maker in the past but I&#39;ve always said &quot;no way&quot; (well, more tactfully<br/>
 than that &lt;g&gt;). There&#39;s something about that human touch that makes it<br/>
extra<br/>
 special (isn&#39;t that true of everything, though?)<br/>
