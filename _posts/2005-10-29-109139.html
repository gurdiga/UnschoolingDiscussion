<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893475064">I just need to connect with the group.  We are new to unschooling <br/>
and actually feel that the best match for our son and our family <br/>
would be what is now loosely described as radical unschooling.  But <br/>
my dh and I are really detoxing!  I will only speak for myself from <br/>
this point on but I feel like I am on an emotional roller coaster.  <br/>
Ds (5) digss up all the shale from the back path to make a volcano.  <br/>
DH and I both have strong feelings but work it through had allow him <br/>
to proceed without dumping any further judgment on him.  He makes an <br/>
awesome volcano which then the family fills with baking soda and <br/>
vinegar and it erupts.  It was just great.  Another episode, DS is <br/>
now choosing to stay up very late (way past us guessing 3:00 a.m. or <br/>
so) and is sleeping past noon.  When we wake him for his horseback <br/>
riding lesson he is angry that he has been woken.  Now dh and I are <br/>
wondering if we are doing the wrong thing allowing him to choose <br/>
when he is sleeping half the day and so cranky.  Another episode, ds <br/>
goes to store and gets overstimulated (my fault ad choice for him) <br/>
and climbs up the metal staircase for employees and won&#39;t get down.  <br/>
Then when he does runs all over the store as I try to chase him (and <br/>
catch him).  When I catch him his body almost seems to relax.  I <br/>
then carry him out of the store.  I feel frazzled but glad I can <br/>
talk with him calming not get angry.  Another on going challenge ds <br/>
just takes something he does want and throws it on the floor.  (I <br/>
have asked if he could put it in the garbage or give it to me or <br/>
leave it on the table.....)  Another episode, after dinner Ds wants <br/>
me to play tag (again) with he and his friend.  I say (which is <br/>
consistent on my part) that after dinner mommy likes to wind down.  <br/>
I like to read and be quieter and get ready for bed.  I would be <br/>
happy to watch a movie with him.  He then gets angry and tells me <br/>
that Since I don&#39;t do his needs he is not listening to me.  This <br/>
time I wait. He doesn&#39;t throw his food on the floor, he doesn&#39;t run <br/>
out the door, he doesn&#39;t start knocking things over.  But he has <br/>
done all of those things at others times this week.  So I guess I am <br/>
saying that we are transitioning and like giving birth it is <br/>
uncomfortable and hard work at times.  I am not someone who cries <br/>
easily and yet I feel teary.  I am tired. I am sad for the time I <br/>
had put him in school.  I am frustrated that I can&#39;t reach him <br/>
better at times.  I am ashamed that I don&#39;t know more about what to <br/>
do to diffuse the situation.  I offer to come close.  I offer to <br/>
hold him.  I offer to give him space.  I just want someone to know <br/>
that we are hurting.  When you drink too much and discover you are <br/>
an alcoholic, one can chose to detox and then begin to recover one <br/>
day at a time.  Well we lived a way that was unhelpful to ds and <br/>
have discovered that we need to detox from not only school and <br/>
expectations but our own upbringings.  We have a strong desire to <br/>
find a new way for ds and us but it is really hard right now.  I <br/>
just didn&#39;t want to be alone with all of these new feelings.  Sorry <br/>
for the lengthy share.  I just needed to know someone out there <br/>
might be able to offer me some hope.  Joanne</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075896505">I had to read you response several times.  I found myself getting defensive, wanting to explain.  But after the fourth time I realized how controlling I had been.  I was trying to direct him. After they had ran around for hours, I ask he and his friend if they wanted to the library to pick a movie.  The friend did but ds really did not.  But we convinced him.   At the time I thought I &quot;meant&quot; well and that it was a good idea.  Oh my gosh.  I am so embarrassed.  The grooves run so deep!  :(  Thank you for the link for unschooling!   Joanne <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190577808"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Another episode, DS is  now choosing to stay up very late (way past <br/>
&gt;us guessing 3:00 a.m. or  so) and is sleeping past noon.  When we <br/>
&gt;wake him for his horseback  riding lesson he is angry that he has <br/>
&gt;been woken.  Now dh and I are  wondering if we are doing the wrong <br/>
&gt;thing allowing him to choose  when he is sleeping half the day and <br/>
&gt;so cranky. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there is several issues here. I think i&#39;d need more info to <br/>
know what the situation is...what time do you go to bed? Before you <br/>
go to sleep, do you make up a comfy place for your son so he can <br/>
fall asleep when he wants to? Is he watching tv?Playing on the <br/>
computer? Playing quietly in his room? Its hard for me to remember <br/>
the exact ages that my son was doing things (he is 9, today <br/>
actually!)but i think at 5, i might have made him a comfy &quot;bed&quot; on <br/>
the couch or floor in front of the tv, and made sure he had plenty <br/>
of tapes (or cartoon cable channel, if we had it), also made sure he <br/>
had something to drink handy and maybe a snack. He mightve come to <br/>
bed with me later on, or more likely fallen asleep where he was. <br/>
Sometimes, if we had a little tv in our room (cosleeping), i&#39;d go to <br/>
sleep while he was watching a tape. I dont particularly like going <br/>
to sleep with a light on (from nightlight or tv)but am willing to <br/>
sacrifice usually esp when he was younger. Now, when we stay at my <br/>
mom&#39;s (i take care of her a few days out of the week, and stay at <br/>
her house on those days), Seamus usually plays computer quietly <br/>
while i sleep (same room). At our own apt i usually will go to sleep <br/>
on my own (ahhh darkness!)and he comes later. Havent had much luck <br/>
getting to him to sleep in his own room yet though. <br/>
<br/>
My son usually goes to sleep around 2-4am and sleeps til 11am-1pm <br/>
(varies.) So i dont think your son staying up late and sleeping in <br/>
are worrisome alone. Why is he cranky? Because you&#39;re waking him <br/>
earlier than he&#39;d like? Does he *want* to take the riding lesson? <br/>
Can he take a lesson later in the day? Might he prefer to postpone <br/>
them for now and keep his later schedule? Given my son&#39;s preference <br/>
for sleeping in, i wouldnt schedule him for anything before <br/>
afternoon time. Luckily, i prefer a &quot;second shift&quot; schedule as well <br/>
(so do most members of my extended family, i think its genetic!)so i <br/>
don&#39;t have too many judgements that he &quot;should&quot; be up by a certain <br/>
time...it would cause WAY more problems for me if he woke at 6a and <br/>
went to bed at 8p or something. <br/>
<br/>
Is there a more gentle way to wake your son (if that applies), give <br/>
him more time to wake up? Sometimes if i do need to wake my son <br/>
before he&#39;s really ready to wake up, it might take an hour to get <br/>
him fully awake. Also, do you talk with him the night before about <br/>
his commitments the next day? <br/>
<br/>
Has your son been in school? How long has he been unschooling? I <br/>
thought perhaps he hadnt been in school long if he&#39;s only 5, but <br/>
then remembered there is daycare and preschool that might be an <br/>
issue as well. What was your bedtime routine before embracing <br/>
radical unschooling? How did you transition to &quot;no bedtimes&quot;? We&#39;ve <br/>
never really had set bedtimes, so this hasnt been much of an issue <br/>
for our family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll reply to the rest of your post in another post so this won&#39;t <br/>
get too long.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is he otherwise a pretty &quot;high energy&quot; child? If so, then i&#39;d say <br/>
this is pretty typical behavior. I don&#39;t remember if my son was <br/>
still doing it at 5, but i know from the time he could walk, until <br/>
he was at least probably 4, he needed to be strapped down in a cart <br/>
for me to be able to shop. Otherwise he was gone. I usually had to <br/>
carry him through a parking lot, or hold his hand very tightly. <br/>
Before he was born, i really thought that the only kids who darted <br/>
out in the street or didnt stay close to their moms were kids that <br/>
didnt get a chance to explore, kids whose moms relied on strollers <br/>
too much. I didnt count on having such a high energy kid (who <br/>
definantly wouldve been labelled ADHD in school)...in restaurants he <br/>
would climb over the booth if not in a highchair. Sometimes it felt <br/>
like a nightmare, like everything was a struggle. Sometimes i took <br/>
it too personally (like he was punishing me by not letting me shop)<br/>
and ended up in tears. Its good to know that you are handling it <br/>
calmly...i wasnt very good at it then. <br/>
<br/>
If i had to do it over again, i wouldve spent more time being his <br/>
partner, instead of the &quot;mom who has to chase him down and strap him <br/>
into the cart&quot;...i wouldve started earlier, as a toddler, exploring <br/>
the store with him, looking at anything he wanted to, including him <br/>
in the process instead of making shopping something i was doing TO <br/>
him. Its hard to know if it wouldve changed his behavior, but it <br/>
wouldve changed our relationship i think.<br/>
<br/>
As for doing things like climbing on the employee ladders...my son <br/>
still does that, at age 9. He always comes down when i ask now <br/>
though (not without protest)...i think for some kids, its just too <br/>
tempting. Maybe if you see something like that try to distract him, <br/>
dont go down the aisle, maybe really get into talking about it, what <br/>
its used for, talk to him about why he can&#39;t be on it. For me, those <br/>
situations kind of suck, because i feel like i&#39;m forced to enforce <br/>
the store&#39;s rule or get yelled at by some salesperson, when very <br/>
often their fears are unfounded (would your son *really* get hurt by <br/>
climbing up a couple of steps, and then down, with you watching, <br/>
keeping him safe? Probably not, and yet i know i feel like i&#39;m <br/>
letting my son do &quot;bad&quot; if i allow it.) We got yelled at (well, in a <br/>
very singsongy polite way)by the lady at the shoestore in the mall <br/>
the other day. Seamus was trying on shoes, and was running up and <br/>
down the (carpeted, empty,short)aisle we were in, to see if the <br/>
shoes would fall off when he ran (they did). &quot;No running, i dont <br/>
want you to get hurt&quot;...i said &quot;oh he&#39;s just testing out his <br/>
shoes&quot; &quot;I know, but i dont want him to get hurt&quot;...there was zero <br/>
chance of him getting hurt, but yet we were still reprimanded. So i <br/>
can see how a kid might not fully buy into WHY he can&#39;t do <br/>
something, because oftentimes there isnt a real good reason behind <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Another on going challenge ds  just takes something he does want <br/>
&gt;and throws it on the floor.  (I  have asked if he could put it in <br/>
&gt;the garbage or give it to me or  leave it on the table.....) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you mean food wrappers and that sort of thing? Is he doing it on <br/>
purpose (defiantly, like &quot;There YOU pick it up!&quot;), or is he just <br/>
forgetful? My son does this quite often...like sometimes it doesnt <br/>
even *occur* to him that we have these things called garbage cans. <br/>
Just a bit ago, i asked him (i had been in another room), did you <br/>
throw your paper plate in the garbage? &quot;oh i&#39;ll go do it!&quot;...later i <br/>
go in, yes he threw out the plate, but left the ketchup sitting on <br/>
the table. Didnt think &quot;oh on my way to the garbage, i&#39;ll stick this <br/>
in the fridge. &quot; He isnt doing it to be wasteful (i&#39;ve had to throw <br/>
out food that he&#39;s left out overnight), or to be disrespectful, i <br/>
think its just how is mind works...he&#39;s thinking too quickly, and <br/>
once he&#39;s done he&#39;s onto the next thought, which isnt usually &quot;now i <br/>
should clean up.&quot; Not sure if its the &quot;correct&quot; thing to do, but i <br/>
usually just pick it up and throw it away. Sometimes i <br/>
comment &quot;you&#39;ve left wrappers on the floor&quot; and either wait a bit <br/>
for him to clean them up, or do it myself. Its improved as he&#39;s <br/>
gotten older, and i think he&#39;ll get better at it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Another episode, after dinner Ds wants  me to play tag (again) with <br/>

&gt; that Since I don&#39;t do his needs he is not listening to me.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, he has a point i think. You told him what you needed, but not <br/>
much info about how to address *his* needs. That doesnt always mean <br/>
your needs go out the window (although i think the younger the <br/>
child, the less your needs get attention)...playing tag probably <br/>
seemed pretty important to him at the time. Maybe you could have <br/>
said &quot;i&#39;ll play tag for ten minutes but then i need to do something <br/>
less active&quot;...compromised? I think in another post you wrote that <br/>
his friend agreed to the movie and you both were trying to convince <br/>
him....maybe he felt ganged up on, like his friend didnt even have <br/>
his back yknow? Do you think he wouldve accepted compromising? He <br/>
and his friend playing tag while you watch? Is this something <br/>
ongoing (him wanting to do something really active in the evening, <br/>
you wanting to relax), or is it mostly because of a friend being <br/>
there? If it wasnt a regular thing i think i&#39;d have just done what <br/>
he wanted. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This  time I wait. He doesn&#39;t throw his food on the floor, he <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t run  out the door, he doesn&#39;t start knocking things over.  <br/>
&gt;But he has  done all of those things at others times this week. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this something he just started since leaving school, or is it <br/>
typical behavior? My son would have horrible outburts when things <br/>
didnt go as planned, or as he wanted, and theyve gotten much less <br/>
frequent as he&#39;s gotten older (maybe just a few times a year <br/>
now?)...so if its just a part of his personality, and how he deals <br/>
with anger, then thats not really an unschooling issue, its more an <br/>
issue of helping him transition without getting upset. But if its <br/>
new behavior that has started very recently, maybe its his response <br/>
to the big change of leaving school. Maybe he feels like his whole <br/>
world has turned upside down and he doesnt know what to expect. What <br/>
have you told him about unschooling? Did he want to leave school? <br/>
Are there parts about it he misses, that he&#39;s upset at having to <br/>
leave(friends, toys, routine?)<br/>
<br/>
All of what you have described sounds like typical behavior for MY <br/>
kid...but it is very hard sometimes to get through it, i know. Keep <br/>
talking to him, explaining *why*, getting his input, asking for his <br/>
help. I think it will get better with time, at least in my <br/>
experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928032889">I&#39;m not a radical unschooler yet, but just wanted to give my .02 cents <br/>
worth about the stores.  Stores more than likely have rules in place <br/>
because of previous things that have happened resulting in lawsuits <br/>
because of person(s) being injured.  Does radical unschooling mean to <br/>
allow a child to run around the stores, climbing on things,etc. My <br/>
daughter is active in our home and we have had several close calls of <br/>
me spilling coffee on her...that is when I&#39;m prepared.  I myself have <br/>
almost nailed kids who have run out in front of my cart while they are <br/>
running through the aisles, or even tripped over them, not to mention <br/>
the elderly or a salesperson carrying boxes,etc.  That is in the <br/>
store, I&#39;ve had to stop quickly because I didn&#39;t see a car backing out <br/>
of the parking lot and the driver didn&#39;t see me.  What about a child?<br/>
<br/>
To me it is a safety issue and one that needs to be handled, before <br/>
the child or someone else gets hurt.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482453182">My kids and I are climbers.  Recently, we went on a visit to the local fire <br/>
station with a group of friends.  I waited until all the kids were off <br/>
checking something out and asked one of the firefighters if it would be ok <br/>
for me to climb the ladder on the back of the hook & ladder truck -- I was <br/>
curious what the top of the fire truck looked like.  He said, &quot;no&quot; and I was <br/>
quite disappointed.  The little kid part of me wanted so badly to just sneak <br/>
over and climb up.  I really am curious what the top of the fire truck looks <br/>
like because you usually just see the sides and the inside of the cab.<br/>
<br/>
As someone who has always been petite, I&#39;ve often had to resort to using <br/>
stepstools, climbing on counters, etc. to reach things.  My children (given <br/>
that my oldest is 3 and 3 feet tall) do the same :)<br/>
<br/>
The ladders in stores are so enticing to children.  I don&#39;t have the same <br/>
urge to climb up because I&#39;m not really interested in seeing the shelves at <br/>
the store from a different perspective.  My children though would love to <br/>
climb up if they were given the opportunity.  The appeal of being as tall as <br/>
or taller than mom and dad is universal IMO.<br/>
<br/>
I keep my children in the cart when shopping because that is the only way we <br/>
can get anything done.  They are both explorers and are full of energy.  <br/>
They would both run off simply because I was not keeping up with them.  <br/>
They&#39;re also the age where chase is a fun game.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081122826">Oh Katharine, thank you so much!  I was starting to fwonder if perhaps I didn&#39;t fit in with this group. As if everything my son was doing was somehow related to something I as doing wrong.  I know I have a lot to learn but my son has always been like this. It is nothing new.   My son has VERY High energy.  A psychiatrist had  suggested that he be put on medication so that his language issues could better be addressed.  I have MS so I can only run around with him for so long.  I am still not really sure how I am suppose to highlight what you wrote so that can respond but I will try to do it correctly this time.  But now have found that the way I did it doens&#39;t allow me to spell check the resposnes I wrote in the body of your text.  YIKES!!!  <br/>
  ***Do you mean food wrappers and that sort of thing? Is he doing it on <br/>
  purpose***<br/>
<br/>
  I really don&#39;t think so.  It doesn&#39;t seem mean or defiant.  It just seems like he is done with something so he is getting it out of his way.  I continue to ask each time if he could either give it to me or leave it so that mommy doesn&#39;t have to pick it up off the floor.  I explained that then I have more work to do which makes less time I can play with him.  He gets it at the moment but then seems to forget the next time. <br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
  ***Well, he has a point i think. You told him what you needed, but not <br/>
  much info about how to address *his* needs. That doesnt always mean <br/>
  your needs go out the window (although i think the younger the child, the less your needs get attention)...playing tag probably seemed pretty important to him at the time. Maybe you could have <br/>
  said &quot;i&#39;ll play tag for ten minutes but then i need to do something less active&quot;...compromised? ***<br/>
<br/>
  That probably would have been a good idea.  I had played tag with them already before we left to go to the library so that I was just feeling a bit tired.<br/>
<br/>
  ***Do you think he wouldve accepted compromising? He <br/>
  and his friend playing tag while you watch?***  <br/>
<br/>
  My ds seems to get a very specifc idea in his head about what he wants.  He almost gets stuck there.  I have seen it with me and with his freinds.  He seems to have trouble compromising at those times and just keeps saying what he wants over and over again.  If after playing tag or whatever game for quite a while, when I want to stop he gets very upset.  I remind him how many minutes are left so the transition is not a surprise and he still says it is too short.  If we can only do what he wants all of the time I end up feeling a bit like I am being controlled by a five year old.  It doesn&#39;t feel good.<br/>
<br/>
  ***Is this something <br/>
  ongoing (him wanting to do something really active in the evening, <br/>
  you wanting to relax), or is it mostly because of a friend being <br/>
  there?***<br/>
<br/>
  No he usually wants to keep playing actively after dinner.  In the past we have tried to redirect or distract him.  But as I am learning about unschooling I am also learning that I need to really hear his needs and then help support him in creatively finding ways to meet those needs. <br/>
<br/>
  ***Is this something he just started since leaving school, or is it <br/>
  typical behavior?***<br/>
<br/>
  Typical behavior for him. He has difficulty with transitioning from one activity to another even when enjoys the one we are transitioning to<br/>
<br/>
  ***What have you told him about unschooling? Did he want to leave school? Are there parts about it he misses, that he&#39;s upset at having to leave(friends, toys, routine?)***  My ds had not wanted to go to school when he was younger (3-5) but since he has special needs we thought that we were doing the best things for him by sending him to experts that &quot;specialize&quot; in these things.  He is happy to be home.  He wanted to try kindergarten since it was a new school but after a few days didn&#39;t want to go anymore.  We had told him that if he wanted to stop he could stay home. We explained that there were different ways to do school.  We haven&#39;t really clarified for him the difference between home schooling and unshcooling.  <br/>
<br/>
  *** Keep <br/>
  talking to him, explaining *why*, getting his input, asking for his <br/>
  help. I think it will get better with time, at least in my <br/>
  experience.****  <br/>
  Thanks you for the encouragement and the support.  Joanne<br/>

<br/>
I wonder if this is true though. I know people say that &quot;oh they&#39;ll <br/>
get sued&quot; but i think it has to do ALOT with what people expect from <br/>
children...not to climb, not to be in weird places they arent <br/>
supposed to be in (like underneath a cart), not to be boisterous. <br/>
Almost all carts that i&#39;ve seen have a little diagram showing how a <br/>
child is NOT to sit in the cart, just in case a parent is scratching <br/>
their head going &quot;hmmm....where do i put the baby? On that tray <br/>
underneath???&quot; Most of those ladder stair thingys say &quot;employee use <br/>
only&quot;...i would think that these precautions would relieve them of <br/>
responsibility if you choose to ignore the warnings. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, i think walmart doesnt want kids to be hurt in their stores. <br/>
But i also think walmart employees have a huge expanded view of what <br/>
will hurt a child. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

you should let your child run wildly throughout the store. Info i&#39;ve <br/>
tried to give is how to meet your child&#39;s needs to explore the store <br/>
without making him feel bad about it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also experienced enough times, a store employee telling my son <br/>
to stop doing something when IMO it wasnt a safety issue, that i <br/>
think it becomes sort of a discrimination-against-kid-behavior <br/>
issue. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even when it IS a possible safety issue, sometimes employees address  <br/>
it in unnecessarily aggressive anti-kid kinds of ways.<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;they don&#39;t want you to do that here&quot; is a perfectly good  <br/>
reason for a parent to give a kid. We don&#39;t need to really know WHY  <br/>
they don&#39;t want us to do it - it is THEIR property, not ours. If a  <br/>
kid asks why they don&#39;t want him to do it, we can speculate that  <br/>
they&#39;re worried (perhaps needlessly, but still worried) about his  <br/>
safety or that maybe a kid got hurt and they got sued before or that  <br/>
they&#39;ve HEARD that when kids get hurt parents often sue and so on. It  <br/>
could be a worthwhile conversation - but, ultimately, the real answer  <br/>
is that whether or not we agree there is a safety issue and even if  <br/>
we know WE would never sue them, they are the management and if they  <br/>
don&#39;t want us to do that there, we can either go somewhere else or  <br/>
abide by their wishes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t let the neighbor kids get in and out of the pool, when  <br/>
they&#39;re swimming at our house. I don&#39;t let them get out and jump back  <br/>
into the pool - even though I know this is fun. I&#39;m not a big mean  <br/>
controlling parent with rules for no reason who likes to have power  <br/>
kids. And when it is only my own kids in the pool, they can do what  <br/>
they want. But it is MY house and my pool and I&#39;m letting them swim  <br/>
here and I want them to just stay in the pool. It is nerve-wracking  <br/>
for ME when they&#39;re out on the deck and jumping in - I don&#39;t enjoy  <br/>
myself, I get more stressed, this is MY issue but so what? I&#39;m &quot;the  <br/>
management&quot; and if kids want to know why I have this rule, it is hard  <br/>
to explain about MY psychological processes - how do I tell a five- <br/>
year-old that he gets to swim at my house FAR<br/>
<br/>
If you think an employee is enforcing a rule that the store  <br/>
management would NOT agree with, then by all means complain to the  <br/>
store management. But if a kid is climbing a store ladder, I bet the  <br/>
store management is going to say they don&#39;t want him to do that. They  <br/>
might cite safety issues, but it might just be that they just don&#39;t  <br/>
like it. They get to decide - they&#39;re the &quot;management.&quot; If WE think  <br/>
the management of a store is so unfriendly to kids that we don&#39;t want  <br/>
our kids exposed to it, then we can shop without our kids or shop  <br/>
somewhere else. And we can complain to management about employees who  <br/>
behave rudely to our kids, especially if it is in a place where kids  <br/>
are presumably welcome (like a kids&#39; museum, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
At HOME, we get to decide how much freedom our kids will have. People  <br/>
here argue that there are wonderful benefits of giving kids FAR more  <br/>
freedom than typical/conventional parents. And we can find ways to  <br/>
give our kids more freedom outside our homes, too, especially by  <br/>
finding friends who share our parenting philosophies and spending  <br/>
lots of time in kid-friendly places. But there are people who are  <br/>
handicapping their kids by NOT helping them understand that  life  <br/>
will be more difficult for them if they don&#39;t learn to discern when  <br/>
and where to insist on &quot;their way&quot; and when to abide by other  <br/>
peoples&#39; wishes.<br/>
<br/>
These aren&#39;t moral or ethical choices - I mean, there ARE times to  <br/>
stand up to authorities even WHEN they are &quot;in charge&quot; - there are  <br/>
most definitely times to refuse to abide by management&#39;s desires.  <br/>
Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat is a perfect example. In 1966  <br/>
or so, my dad was working on getting financing for a customer of his  <br/>
(my dad owned an industrial building construction company) when he  <br/>
suddenly realized that his bank was engaging in outright  <br/>
discrimination against the customer because of his race. My dad could  <br/>
have said, &quot;Well, it is their bank,&quot; but he didn&#39;t - he asked to  <br/>
speak to the bank manager and closed his multi-million dollar  <br/>
business accounts with that bank, on the spot. And he reported them  <br/>
to various agencies.<br/>
<br/>
So there are times to take a stand and refuse to go along with other  <br/>
people&#39;s desires/rules/etc! But life is smoother and happier when  <br/>
people accept that there are times to respect other peoples&#39; rights  <br/>
to be seemingly arbitrary in their OWN spheres of control. When this  <br/>
doesn&#39;t involve any kind of moral/ethical/right versus wrong/serious  <br/>
compromise of standards - then creating harmony and happiness and  <br/>
peace in the world is ALSO valuable and worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that some who love the whole radical unschooling/ <br/>
respectful parenting approach can really go too far - maybe it is  <br/>
those who felt extremely controlled as a kid, themselves, and are  <br/>
saying, &quot;I&#39;m NOT doing that to my kid and I&#39;m not going to let  <br/>
anybody ELSE do it to my kid, either.&quot; Which is good - I&#39;m glad there  <br/>
are so many of us who are finding ways to give our kids so much more  <br/>
freedom! But I see a &quot;defiance&quot; sometimes - like they&#39;ve not let go  <br/>
of the &quot;rigidity&quot; of the controlling parenting style - but they&#39;re  <br/>
applying that &quot;rigidity&quot; to making sure their kid doesn&#39;t get  <br/>
controlled in any way by anybody. In a way, those parents are still  <br/>
BEING controlled - if they are still reacting &quot;against&quot; the way they  <br/>
were raised. It is possible to move beyond that - to even more  <br/>
mindful parenting which will be less hostile, less defensive, calmer,  <br/>
more peaceful, and allow for sometimes going along with controls and  <br/>
not feeling &quot;bristly&quot; over things like a grocery store employee  <br/>
asking kids not to climb on the store ladder.<br/>
<br/>
I think that also there is a further and higher level of trust in our  <br/>
children that we can reach, as well, if we&#39;ve protected and respected  <br/>
them when they were little and helped them learn how to respond to  <br/>
other people being arbitrary and controlling, then we don&#39;t have to  <br/>
constantly be on guard to create a world/environment around them that  <br/>
is absolutely respectful and courteous and never arbitrary - at  <br/>
least, as they get older, they&#39;ll be able to appropriately respond to  <br/>
it themselves and make their own decisions about going along or not.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if we&#39;re talking about a 3 year old climbing on a store  <br/>
ladder, the parent might hug the child sweetly while removing him  <br/>
from the steps and give him a kiss and say, &quot;They don&#39;t want us to  <br/>
climb their ladder in this store,&quot; and move quickly on to, &quot;Hey do  <br/>
you want to pick out cereal?&quot; If we&#39;re talking about a 5 year old,  <br/>
the parent might say, &quot;I know you&#39;re a safe ladder climber, but they  <br/>
don&#39;t know that here, so that&#39;s why they don&#39;t want you to climb -  <br/>
makes them too nervous. But, hey, when we get home do you want to get  <br/>
our BIG ladder out and climb up it?&quot; If we&#39;re talking to a 9 year  <br/>
old, we might have a more in-depth conversation about arbitrary rules  <br/>
and why stores have them and it might get into lawsuits and how some  <br/>
people will sue for anything and what happens to prices because of  <br/>
that and on and on. If we&#39;re talking about a 13 year old, depending  <br/>
on the kid, the parent might not say a word, just let the kid decide  <br/>
how to respond. If the employee is rude, then I do think it is  <br/>
appropriate for a parent to say, &quot;No need to be rude,&quot; or something  <br/>
like that. When the kids are getting up into their teens, I do think  <br/>
the parents should, at that point, more and more trust their kids to  <br/>
decide if they want to address rudeness or arbitrariness or whatever,  <br/>
not do it &quot;for&quot; them, even if it annoys the parent. This comes up  <br/>
because teens DO quite often get spoken to rudely by people &quot;in  <br/>
authority&quot; and I know I &quot;bristle&quot; - it brings back my own teen years  <br/>
of being treated less than respectfully. But I think my kids have the  <br/>
right to decide if this is a time that they want the rudeness  <br/>
addressed or not - so I will sometimes bite my tongue and let it  <br/>
slide. The kids know my urge to &quot;protect their environment&quot; is still  <br/>
strong and sometimes they&#39;ll even say, quietly, &quot;It is okay, mom,  <br/>
just ignore it.&quot;  BUT, they will also sometimes ask me to step in -  <br/>
as Roya did at the CIty Museum in St. Louis when an employee was very  <br/>
rude to her and some other kids. She knows that if she asks, that I  <br/>
will try to at least lodge a complaint about that employee - assuming  <br/>
that if there are enough complaints that something will be done.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - it is a balance we all have to find and well worth  <br/>
discussing. Interesting how the issue doesn&#39;t really disappear as the  <br/>
kids grow up, it changes form but we continue to deal with it.<br/>

opportunities.   They are now 19, 16 and 13 (for four more days).<br/>
<br/>
Marty is the middle kid, 16.   He has a costume from last year.   It&#39;s a <br/>
super hero he created from parts, called &quot;Above Average Joe.&quot;   He decided last <br/>
night that he would put on the Above Average Joe costume (minus the platform <br/>
shoes, which are very cool but dangerous) and go running around town.   A friend <br/>
of his went to take photos.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted photos in front of landmarks, so they went to Old Town, where he <br/>
was posing here and there (I haven&#39;t seen the photos yet), and because there <br/>
were ghost tours going on around the plaza and Marty was upstaging the tour <br/>
guides, he was (in his words) &quot;thrown out of Old Town.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said a security guard talked to him very nicely, asked who he was with <br/>
(meaning what tour group, he figured) and when he said he was just there with his <br/>
friend, the guard said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m going to have to ask you to leave <br/>
because of the tours&quot; or some such.   <br/>
<br/>
Marty COULD have been lawyerly and argued that they were public streets and <br/>
Albuquerque has no curfew, etc...   but he didn&#39;t.   He said when they were <br/>
passing by one tour group one of the young women squealled &quot;it&#39;s SUPERMAN!&quot; and <br/>
everyone else in the group screamed, and he posed for them all.   He realized <br/>
he was being disruptive, and left peaceably. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They got their photos, he got some attention, and was a nice guy.    <br/>

you&#39;ll think back and understand.&quot;   I try to say yes lots and lots, and when I <br/>
know I&#39;m going to be very uncomfortable, I say so.   Sometimes they amend <br/>
their plan, sometimes they reassure me, sometimes they agree to call when they <br/>
get there, and call every day (or whatever kind of unease it is, they figure out <br/>
something reassuring).<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times I&#39;ve asked them to come down from a high climb or something for <br/>
the reason that I&#39;m getting scared or that I&#39;m afraid.   I&#39;ve stopped things <br/>
lots of times because they were uncomfortable or afraid, and because I was <br/>
willing to do that, they&#39;re willing to do that for me.    <br/>
<br/>
I think parents who do the old traditional pressure and shame (&quot;Just do it, <br/>
don&#39;t be a baby,&quot; or &quot;Buck up and take it--the rest don&#39;t want to quit yet so <br/>
we&#39;re not quitting&quot; or whatever) are just putting resistence in the bank and <br/>
that kid will turn around and say no right back at the parents.<br/>
<br/>
To say yes instead of no, though, isn&#39;t the same as &quot;I don&#39;t care what you <br/>
do.&quot;<br/>
You don&#39;t want your kids to say to you in return &quot;I don&#39;t care what you do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they trust your advice, and learn how to take and give advice from years <br/>
of careful counsel and deep conversation, when you get older and want their <br/>
help or advice, I bet you&#39;re more likely to get it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you refer to yourself as &quot;mommy&quot; when you talk to him?<br/>
<br/>
When people babytalk a child, they&#39;re putting another layer between <br/>
themselves and the child.   It&#39;s a wedge in a relationship not to be whole and real and <br/>
direct.    It&#39;s one thing to babytalk an actual non-speaking infant; older <br/>
kids benefit from adults modelling real, honest, whole communications.<br/>
<br/>

play with him. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Is that REALLY why you don&#39;t want him to learn to use a trashcan?<br/>
Is it really worth that much explaining?<br/>
<br/>
If you die today and can   never play with him again, shouldn&#39;t he still put <br/>
trash in the trash can?<br/>
<br/>
He should do it because it&#39;s the right thing to do.   It makes HIM a better <br/>
person.   For you to &quot;take it out of his check&quot; as it were, and blame him for <br/>
you giving him less attention (even if it&#39;s an empty threat) is not dealing <br/>
directly with the real issue.<br/>
<br/>
Trash doesn&#39;t belong on the floor.   If he&#39;s just really too little, don&#39;t <br/>
let him unwrap his own food or cards or toys or whatever.   You could unwrap <br/>
them and put the trash away and then hand him the unwrapped thing.<br/>

&gt; Yes.  I think that&#39;s what people were saying.  That&#39;s really the key<br/>
&gt; idea here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a really super high energy child (my oldest). I wonder if you  <br/>
really need to get him even MORE exercise during the day - maybe he  <br/>
needs far far more than you do or ever did, more than you can  <br/>
imagine. Some active kids that age can pretty much go full blast with  <br/>
intense physical activity all day long - they desperately need that  <br/>
very intense strenuous active time - not a few hours a day, but  <br/>
almost ALL the time, every day.<br/>
<br/>
It really sounds like he&#39;s not getting worn out enough, physically,  <br/>
throughout the day and so ends up the day with a LOT of pent-up  <br/>
energy. What you want is for him to be physically tired so that he&#39;s  <br/>
READY to have a hot bath, maybe spend some time playing with toys in  <br/>
the bathtub, have a cup of warm cocoa and some graham crackers, brush  <br/>
teeth, get nice clean pajamas on, watch a movie with you while all  <br/>
cuddled up under a blanket. Lower the lights, watch something he&#39;s  <br/>
seen before and liked, nothing too thrilling. (Musicals are good.)  <br/>
The key to all of this is for him to have many HOURS of intense  <br/>
outdoor play time every single day. Get a trampoline - get Dance,  <br/>
Dance Revolution. Go to a karate class every day. Swim as much as  <br/>
possible - consider a swim team so he can swim almost every day.  <br/>
Maybe tap dance, if he&#39;d like that. Ice skating. Gymnastics can be  <br/>
good if there isn&#39;t too much standing around, waiting.  You have to  <br/>
support the REAL child you have - and you have a very physically  <br/>
demanding high energy kid. Other people may not have kids who are so  <br/>
needy of physical outlet and so may not understand how important it  <br/>
is for him to burn off all that energy - how exhausting it can be if  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t get that chance. I don&#39;t think you described his &quot;special  <br/>
needs&quot; - but if it includes lack of focus, lack of attention,  <br/>
hyperactivity, etc., then PLEASE for his sake consider making it a  <br/>
very high priority to provide him with MANY hours of free play  <br/>
physical activity time as well as possibly some more structured  <br/>
intense activity time. If you&#39;re thinking of organized sports,  <br/>
remember that soccer involves much more active play time AND, in  <br/>
general, is more supportive and positive. BUT organized sports is NOT  <br/>
a substitute for free play time, no matter what the sport is.<br/>
<br/>
It does sound like he wears YOU out - and that description of him  <br/>
STILL wanting to play tag after dinner when you are ready and eager  <br/>
and needing to wind down - was very familiar to me, so you have my  <br/>
sympathy and understanding for wanting to just say no way, because  <br/>
you&#39;re at your low-energy time of the day and he&#39;s still energized.<br/>

<br/>
but,  ultimately, the real answer  <br/>
is that whether or not we agree there is  a safety issue and even if  <br/>
we know WE would never sue them, they are  the management and if they  <br/>
don&#39;t want us to do that there, we can  either go somewhere else or  <br/>
abide by their  wishes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Or, you can reason with the management if you have the opportunity and see  <br/>
if you can have an exception granted.  Most of the things we&#39;re talking  about <br/>
are not worth that kind of interaction, but sometimes it is.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, the chances that you will get an exception are determined by a  <br/>
lot of factors, but that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t try.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think if a parent doesn&#39;t have the time to rock the boat with the  <br/>
management to get something for their child (a chance to climb the ladder), then  they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t let their kid climb it without asking, either.  But I don&#39;t  see <br/>
the harm in asking.<br/>

If we&#39;re  talking about a 5 year old,  <br/>
the parent might say, &quot;I know you&#39;re a  safe ladder climber, but they  <br/>
don&#39;t know that here, so that&#39;s why  they don&#39;t want you to climb -  <br/>
makes them too nervous. But, hey,  when we get home do you want to get  <br/>
our BIG ladder out and climb up  it?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I would take this a little less towards the personal and make sure the kid  <br/>
knows they don&#39;t want ANY person on the ladder, other than those who work  <br/>
there.<br/>
 <br/>
If I had said, &quot;You can&#39;t do that&quot; to my kids, they would take it  <br/>
personally.  It would help them understand the principle better if my  language was less <br/>
personally directed.<br/>
 <br/>
I know would probably consider this, Pam, but I wanted to point it  out.<br/>

Me, too.  I stood outside the library for 5 minutes watching a toddler  go in <br/>
and out the automatic door, while her mother was at the counter 100  FEET <br/>
AWAY, distracted by what she was doing.  Only occasionally did she  look up to <br/>
check on the baby, and I kept expecting her to come and get the  child, or her <br/>
older child to, but neither one did.  At least one time she  looked and SAW her <br/>
baby outside library with the door closed, and she still  didn&#39;t come.  I <br/>
hovered near the baby to keep her from going out in the  street.  But what if I <br/>
just wanted to take a baby home?  I could have  had her in my arms and gone in <br/>
no time.<br/>

<br/>
I saw a toddler get her fingers painfully trapped in a library door.  <br/>
(Cupertino library).  It definitely wasn&#39;t the best door design, but <br/>
closer supervision could have made a difference.<br/>
<br/>
I think a child getting lost outside or hit by a car in the parking lot <br/>
are the real dangers leaving the library.  Statistically the kidnapping <br/>
of small children in busy public places is quite rare, and imposing <br/>
constant kidnapper-vigilance on mothers is unreasonable in my book.  <br/>
(Although I reserve the right to quietly worry about avian flu, I&#39;m <br/>
putting killer asteroids in my &quot;shrug it off&quot; file.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077508770">Me too<br/>
       the worst is UK railway stations. The amount of children <br/>
running about so close to the edge of the platform makes me feel feel <br/>
sick with worry. One trip and they&#39;d be on the track or under a train. <br/>
Some trains don&#39;t stop at the station and thunder through at speed.<br/>
<br/>
This may sound awful but after years of &#39;hovering&#39; around other <br/>
peoples&#39; children at railway stations to keep them safe now if I see <br/>
any kids I go far far away from them down the platform. I can&#39;t do it <br/>
anymore it makes me so anxious.<br/>

I always would lay with imp until he fell asleep and then when he woke up in the middle of the night would come into our bed.   After reading the various posts, I think we have come to opening the bed in the family room (where the t.v. is and I lay with him while he watched his movie.  He has other movies and I tell him when I am tired and need to go to sleep.  This has been working well so far.  I am open to it for as long as he needs.  I am able to get enough sleep this way and still allow him to make the choices he feels comfortable with. It is hard to insist a child go to sleep when they are not tired :)  Joanne<br/>
