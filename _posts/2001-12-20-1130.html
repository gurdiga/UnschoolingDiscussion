<div id="ygrps-yiv-924643677">&lt;&lt;its a part of our human sin nature to have faith in ourselves&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it is also important to remember that Jesus said &quot;The Kingdom of God<br/>
is within you.&quot;  The first time I read that, it blew me away.  The kingdom<br/>
of God (as far as I understand it) isn&#39;t some ethereal place up in the<br/>
sky..... It is within me and therefore I can trust in myself.  And when we<br/>
put that together with the fact that we are all made of the same atoms that<br/>
have been on this earth since its beginning and how when we die, our atoms<br/>
disperse and are then brought together with other atoms to form new<br/>
life......makes the things that religions turn into mountains seem very much<br/>
like molehills.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377515180">this is why I think studying various religions/beliefs is wonderful.....we<br/>
often find we&#39;re more alike than we first thought.  I believe I heard<br/>
somewhere that a wise buddhist once wondered why western civilization needs<br/>
buddhism...since we have Christ to emulate.<br/>
