<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901966288">Hello, I have been lurking on and off for months and felt it was time <br/>
I posted an intro.<br/>
<br/>
I live in the UK and have three children, ds (7.5), dd (5.5) and dd <br/>
(3.5) and have been home educating them for nearly two years. The <br/>
eldest two have tried school and are adamant they are never going <br/>
again!<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that I still don&#39;t feel confident or at peace with <br/>
what I&#39;m doing, worry constantly and keep changing my approach. This <br/>
has got to change!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve toyed with Charlotte Mason, Waldorf, unschooling and a more <br/>
structured approach with reading, writing and maths practice every <br/>
morning. My son, who I worry about most, is reluctant to do anything <br/>
he regards as school work but if I let him do exactly what he wants <br/>
he will just watch tv constantly. I know many (all?) of you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have a problem with that but his behaviour worsens, he gets headaches <br/>
(he wears glasses) and isnt&#39;t active or using his imagination when <br/>
he&#39;s stuck in front of the box all the time.<br/>
<br/>
He also plays constantly, mostly with my eldest daughter. Which is <br/>
fine but I worry that he isn&#39;t learning *anything*. He is very behind <br/>
his peers, which I know shouldn&#39;t bother me, but remember 99% of <br/>
children in the UK start formal schooling at four. He is bright, but <br/>
not curious about anything. He never asks questions and is quite <br/>
challenging in his behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post but I need guidance and feel all at sea. Do <br/>
you think parents and children have to be of a certain personality to <br/>
successfully unschool? I feel I&#39;ve made so many mistakes, <br/>
particularly where my son is concerned, and don&#39;t want to make any <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Apologies again for the ramble,<br/>
best wishes,<br/>
Deborah.</div>

<br/>
Not wanting to do school work is smart.<br/>
<br/>
If you let him do exactly what he wants he will NOT just watch TV contantly.  <br/>
He might right at first, and the more you have or continue to show <br/>
disapproval, the more he will watch.   It&#39;s like a direct reaction to limitations and <br/>
tsking.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is my collection of &quot;if I let him, he will...&quot; statements, and nobody <br/>
has ever come back and proven their dire predictions to be true.  On the <br/>
contrary, people come back and say &quot;You were right.  I let him do what he wanted and <br/>
after a while he turned the TV off.  Some days it&#39;s not even on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He can&#39;t turn it off by his own choice if he doesn&#39;t really HAVE an honest <br/>
choice.<br/>
He won&#39;t want to turn it off if he knows you&#39;ll do the happy told-you-so, <br/>
it&#39;s-about-time dance if he does.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re making yourself a factor where you would be better off NOT being a <br/>
factor.<br/>
<br/>
And on the other hand maybe you should spend some time watching WITH him so <br/>
you have more shared experience and things to talk about.  If watching TV is <br/>
his thing and complaining about TV is your thing, you spoiled a chance to have a <br/>
shared thing.<br/>

<br/>
-=-and isnt&#39;t active or using his imagination when <br/>
<br/>
he&#39;s stuck in front of the box all the time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Very judgmental choice of terminology.  If he&#39;s there by choice, he&#39;s not <br/>
&quot;stuck.&quot;  If someone else sticks him there he&#39;s stuck.    &quot;The box&quot;?  It&#39;s not a <br/>
hole to fall into.  It&#39;s an outpouring of music, pictures, stories, voices, <br/>
people.  My kids play and watch, walk and watch, brush the cat and watch, build <br/>
up the fire in the fireplace and watch.  Maybe you could bring his Lego in <br/>
there or get him a little trampoline so he&#39;d have something to do while he <br/>
watches.  Or maybe he&#39;s really engrossed and involved.<br/>
<br/>
You have no idea what imagination he&#39;s using while he&#39;s watching.  If you <br/>
would hang out with him more and talk about the shows, you might get a glimpse.  <br/>
(Not if you say &quot;What do you see in that stupid show anyway?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Once I wrote a candid outpouring of what I used to think as a kid watching <br/>
Gilligan&#39;s Island re-runs.  It&#39;s here:<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;He also plays constantly, mostly with my eldest daughter. Which is <br/>
<br/>
fine but I worry that he isn&#39;t learning *anything*.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He must be living a double life if he&#39;s doing two things constantly.<br/>
<br/>
You must have learned, from all your examination and experimentation with <br/>
different early childhood ed methods, that play is exactly how children learn.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He is bright, but <br/>
<br/>
not curious about anything. He never asks questions and is quite <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Curiosity isn&#39;t something you can see.  It&#39;s like imagination.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
need to be expressed verbally to exist.  It doesn&#39;t have to be acted out or <br/>
acted upon visibly to be happening.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s bored and home and you should get him out more places.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Do <br/>
<br/>
you think parents and children have to be of a certain personality to <br/>
<br/>
successfully unschool?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  They need to be curious.  They need to be imaginative.  They need not <br/>
to be judgmental about other people&#39;s interests, and they need to know that <br/>
children AND adults learn from playing, and learn from just messing around with <br/>
and tinkering with things that interest them.  (a.k.a. &quot;playing&quot;)<br/>

 <br/>
**So many people say that, but I&#39;ve yet to hear of a family where it<br/>
really happened.  My children, who have always been able to watch TV any<br/>
time they want, do not watch constantly.  Your son, if given the freedom<br/>
to watch TV any time he wants, may for a while watch constantly.  He may<br/>
think you&#39;re going to change your mind.  He may just be so excited to be<br/>
able to watch that it takes a while to get his fill.  In any case, if<br/>
the life around him is fun and interesting and/or exciting, he will<br/>
eventually find the balance between TV and other activities that is best<br/>
for him.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;he gets headaches <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(he wears glasses) <br/>
 <br/>
**Maybe he needs a new prescription?  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He also plays constantly, mostly with my eldest daughter. Which is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>fine but I worry that he isn&#39;t learning *anything*.<br/>
 <br/>
**Play is how children learn.  If he&#39;s playing with his sister he&#39;s<br/>
learning and he&#39;s building a relationship with his sister that he&#39;ll<br/>
have for the rest of his life.  All good.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; He is bright, but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>not curious about anything. He never asks questions <br/>
 <br/>
**Questions are not the only way curiousity is manifested.  Who knows<br/>
what is going on inside his head?  He does.  You can trust that he can<br/>
decide how best to spend his time.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do <br/>

**I think parents have to be of a certain personality: interested,<br/>
mindful, curious, open to life.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463170067"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&quot;but if I let him do exactly what he wants he will just watch tv <br/>
&gt;constantly. I know many (all?) of you wouldn&#39;t have a problem with that&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am intrigued with your situation, and want to understand where you are <br/>
coming from more.  Do you ever present activities for your son outside of, <br/>
or inside of the household - painting, a trip to a children&#39;s museum, a <br/>
library trip to find a book or video on a subject that interest him?  How <br/>
does he respond?  Does he enjoy having you read him books?  Literally how <br/>
many hours a day does he spend in front of the TV?  I feel like I am coming <br/>
across accusingly, but I am really just curious as to why some children may <br/>
choose to watch TV literally all day.  My kids do enjoy TV to a point, but <br/>
there are so many other things for them to do that there are about 4 days <br/>
out of the week that it never even gets turned on.  Sometimes I wonder if it <br/>
is because their parents watch a lot of TV and don&#39;t have a lot of other <br/>
activities that they are personally interested in....?  Or maybe kids can <br/>
get &quot;scared&quot; of doing &quot;learning&quot; activities because they were graded <br/>
previously, or critiqued too much...so in turn they find the TV a safe <br/>
outlet?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll let Debbie speak for herself, but my experience has been that asking<br/>
why one kid may choose to watch TV a lot is kind of like asking why one kid<br/>
has a sweet tooth and wants to eat a lot of sugary things a lot as opposed<br/>
to another kid with different taste buds.  I personally do not watch TV at<br/>
all and am always making other alternatives available to my kids (ages 5 and<br/>
3) that correspond to their interests.  They&#39;ve never been schooled and I do<br/>
not pressure them in any way so it&#39;s not related to that.  My 5 year old<br/>
doesn&#39;t generally request TV or videos much unless it&#39;s something new that<br/>
caught her fancy which she watches for a while then gets tired of.  Days go<br/>
by and it can be forgotten.  My 3 year old son on the other hand did get to<br/>
a point where he was watching constantly every day - and it had the domino<br/>
effect of drawing my daughter in to watch when if it hadn&#39;t been on she<br/>
would not have been doing that.  She would then want to watch &quot;the next<br/>
video&quot; so as not to have her brother&#39;s preferences on all day.  And yes, it<br/>
felt like we were starting to watch videos all day and everything else was<br/>
&quot;after the videos, mom&quot;.  So I set a limit on them of a number per day my<br/>
son can watch which he respects like he respects limits to other things<br/>
which his Mom thinks are great in small amounts but not so great if he&#39;s<br/>
doing them all day long.  I don&#39;t prescribe what else he has to do other<br/>
than the video watching, he decides that.<br/>
<br/>
I respect other people&#39;s different experiences and choices - this has been<br/>
ours.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>=================================================<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I went about 10 yrs without TV--no cable and no reception where we<br/>
lived (we always had a vcr). So we don&#39;t do too much tv here; we do mostly<br/>
videos and DVDs. This is partly out of habit, I guess. But that&#39;s what the<br/>
kids have grown up doing as well--pop in a video when they want to watch<br/>
something. They know tv is out there and that there&#39;s fun stuff on it, but<br/>
somehow they associate it more with hotels than home. *g*<br/>
<br/>
Some days are &quot;watching days&quot; around here. Maybe somebody&#39;s sick or it&#39;s<br/>
really cold out. Maybe we&#39;ve just been going full speed for a while and need<br/>
to relax. Point is, this goes in waves or spurts. We might watch lots of<br/>
movies for a while, but then we&#39;re off doing other things, having other<br/>
interests. In our lives, I don&#39;t think any one thing predominates. For a<br/>
week or so, it may seem like all we do is watch movies. For another week,<br/>
we&#39;re really into board games. Lately, we&#39;ve been really into Majesty--a new<br/>
castle sim game that we got for the computer. Felt like we were playing it<br/>
all the time. Sometimes I&#39;d play by myself; I&#39;d play with dh or even 3<br/>
players with our 6 yo over wireless. We were having fun and getting into a<br/>
new game. But that&#39;s slowing down now. (Well, dh is still geeking out,<br/>
reading cheats and walkthroughs on his laptop while playing on the big<br/>
computer. *g*) Next week, I&#39;m guessing we&#39;ll be hunkered down reading Harry<br/>
Potter because we just watched the first two movies, which we borrowed from<br/>
the library.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling&#39;s kind of like the stock market: you have to be in it for the<br/>
long haul and look at the big picture. It&#39;s not all ups and it&#39;s not all<br/>
downs, but from a narrow perspective it may look that way. Pull your<br/>
investment too soon, and you&#39;ve missed the big payoff for focusing only on<br/>
the immediate circumstance. Of course, the analogy falls apart when you<br/>
think about the big crash--unschooling would never do that! ;)<br/>

&lt;&lt; My 3 year old son on the other hand did get to<br/>
<br/>
a point where he was watching constantly every day - and it had the domino<br/>
<br/>
effect of drawing my daughter in to watch when if it hadn&#39;t been on she<br/>
<br/>
would not have been doing that.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you had a child who read a lot of books, and another child was intrigued <br/>
and then began to read a lot of the same books, and they had that common <br/>
experience so that they could discuss them, would you limit books?  Would you think <br/>
the first book-reader had lured the sibling into a world of evil books?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And yes, it felt like we were starting to watch videos all day and <br/>
everything else was<br/>
<br/>
&quot;after the videos, mom&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Videos are gloriously &quot;pausable.&quot;  If there&#39;s something more rewarding for a <br/>
child to do, she&#39;ll probably be thrilled to do it.  If the alternatives are <br/>
not more rewarding, she&#39;s smart to do the thing which seems to her most <br/>
interesting.   That&#39;s where learning is, on the edge of interest.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Unschooling&#39;s kind of like the stock market: you have to be in it for the<br/>
<br/>
long haul and look at the big picture. It&#39;s not all ups and it&#39;s not all<br/>
<br/>
downs, but from a narrow perspective it may look that way. Pull your<br/>
<br/>
investment too soon, and you&#39;ve missed the big payoff for focusing only on<br/>
<br/>
the immediate circumstance. Of course, the analogy falls apart when you<br/>
<br/>
think about the big crash--unschooling would never do that! ;) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like this analogy!  <br/>
<br/>
There could be the big crash of a kid deciding at 16 what he&#39;s really always <br/>
wanted was military school. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There could be something that makes the mom wish she had spent all those <br/>
years being a professional and getting paychecks, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
But the idea that there are lulls is a good one.  Even with school, learning <br/>
curves aren&#39;t real curves.  There are artifical ideal curves on charts that <br/>
districts draw, where one thing is learned, and the next skill builds on that, <br/>
etc., but I&#39;ve never known a single kid to actually follow any of those curves. <br/>
 In real-life situations, someone already knows something before the teacher <br/>
tells it, or is ignoring the teacher because his dog died, and all that.  <br/>
Learning (in school or not) happens in fits and starts, with rest periods between. <br/>
 School rewards kids being quiet, and so they eventually kill the advantage <br/>
of sparkly sudden learning.   If the teachers don&#39;t get angry at a kid for <br/>
jumping up and saying &quot;HEY, I GET IT!  This is SO COOL,&quot; the other kids will laugh <br/>
him back into his seat.<br/>
<br/>
But with unschooling the excited moments are lots of fun, and they don&#39;t <br/>
happen every day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447081564">&lt;&lt;Sorry for the long post but I need guidance and feel<br/>
all at sea. Do <br/>
you think parents and children have to be of a certain<br/>
personality to <br/>
successfully unschool? I feel I&#39;ve made so many<br/>
mistakes, <br/>
particularly where my son is concerned, and don&#39;t want<br/>
to make any <br/>
more.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First things first, BREATHE! lol<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you need to be able to think things<br/>
thru clearly, instead of bouncing around and confusing<br/>
yourself! You know the REM song, &quot; Stand in the place<br/>
where you live.&quot;  Do that! lol<br/>
<br/>
It seems like you&#39;re at a point where you have learned<br/>
a lot about what doesn&#39;t work, and you could look at<br/>
that as a good thing!  I mean, at least now you know,<br/>
right?  <br/>
<br/>
Now you&#39;re putting all your eggs in an unschooling<br/>
basket, and that&#39;s scary because you&#39;re worried that<br/>
this is another mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I still worry about that sometimes, and it&#39;s been<br/>
almost 10 years.  Everytime I worry, I try to connect<br/>
with my son in a different way, or pay attention to<br/>
different aspects of his life, or just simply remind<br/>
myself to spend time with him as much as possible.<br/>
Whenever I worry it&#39;s because I&#39;m living in the<br/>
future, not with him, today.  *Every time.* Try to<br/>
remember that, it might help.<br/>
<br/>
Your son sounds like he&#39;s deschooling now, and that&#39;s<br/>
difficult for a parent who&#39;s used to worksheets and<br/>
curriculums, so read up on it a bit.  ( there are<br/>
plenty of links, do a search on google, or try<br/>
unschooling.com, etc) <br/>
<br/>
   Unschooling can be difficult to acclimate yourself<br/>
to, and people get uncomfortable sometimes when<br/>
challenging all these ideas and beliefs that we&#39;ve had<br/>
for so long. (Playing is not learning, judging what<br/>
kind of learning is good or bad, watching TV is a<br/>
waste of time, etc)  I think that&#39;s normal, and it&#39;s<br/>
also a process that you can&#39;t really rush, just keep<br/>
paying attention to it, and do what you can. <br/>
<br/>
  I do think that some parents are better unschoolers<br/>
than others, but I don&#39;t unschool because it&#39;s best<br/>
for me, we do it because it&#39;s best for our son.  It<br/>
might be harder work for us, because of that, but it&#39;s<br/>
worth it!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a very patient person, nor am a very flexible<br/>
person sometimes, but those things have improved with<br/>
time ( and effort!) while unschooling. My son is<br/>
better off for it, and so am I.  I have never looked<br/>
back and said to myself, oh, it would have been better<br/>
for me and him, if I had just stayed impatient and<br/>
rigid and send him to school! <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget to breathe! Open up to the moments you<br/>
have with your children.  Enjoy.  Try to remember to<br/>
live *in the moment* when you get anxious. <br/>
<br/>
Peace~<br/>

has read/heard of the book &quot;Set Free Childhood&quot; about television and <br/>
how it affects the brain etc. Not comfortable reading and one I <br/>
sometimes wish I hadn&#39;t read.<br/>

&lt;&lt;He also plays constantly, mostly with my eldest daughter. Which is <br/>

&gt; <br/>

&gt;is exactly how children learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, obviously he&#39;s not doing the two things constantly <br/>
simultaneously. I had been limiting the tv but if I hadn&#39;t those <br/>
would be the two things he would be doing but at different times. And <br/>
while I know playing is great I also know that people do need to <br/>
learn to read and write and be numerate and I had thought that at 7 <br/>

got lots of stuff, he has me and his sisters and sees lots of <br/>
friends. We also go to lots of events arranged by our home-ed group. <br/>
No, I honestly don&#39;t think he&#39;s bored. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t explain why it&#39;s so hard for me to embrace unschooling but I <br/>
am trying. Thanks for your input. He has spent all morning playing <br/>
Lord of the Rings on his Gameboy and I haven&#39;t said a word! Progress <br/>
for me! Sorry this is long, I&#39;m rushing because dd1 is keen to get <br/>

boys do......there is really very little that they truly NEED to read or<br/>
write or know numbers.<br/>
<br/>
But as they NEED it, they DO learn it.  When he decides he wants to warm his<br/>
own food in the microwave, he will start to recognize numbers so he can push<br/>
the buttons.<br/>
<br/>
When he decides that it is easier to read the video game instructions<br/>
himself rather than find you to do it, he will start to read.<br/>
<br/>
When he has trouble remembering what he needs to get at the store, he will<br/>
start to write so he can make a list.<br/>

It truly is no more complicated than that.<br/>

It&#39;s easy to confuse the two, but it&#39;s very important to separate them <br/>
out when you&#39;re getting concerned. Keep a record for one week of what&#39;s <br/>
*really* happening. A journal can be good if you&#39;re a writer, but just a <br/>
list: 6 a.m asleep 7 a.m. eating watching TV, 8 a.m. fixing bike, <br/>
whatever like that may help clarify exactly what&#39;s happening. The idea <br/>

won&#39;t *need* anything from him for days. Bring food. see if it&#39;s <br/>
literally true that he can&#39;t walk away. If you see him away from the <br/>
set, or you see it off, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s possible for him to get away.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I got rid of my TV for many years as an adult because I felt <br/>

address it and make my own decisions regarding that after nobody else <br/>
was making those decision *for* me.<br/>

If in five years you hadn&#39;t become more comfortable with tv and gameboy, you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be making the progress you will need to make for unschooling to work.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Yes, but it&#39;s having the nerve, in my case, to sit it out while he <br/>
<br/>
gets his fill. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then it&#39;s not that he would play it all day, you&#39;re saying that if he didn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen that happen. <br/>
<br/>
But by &quot;writing&quot; you probably have something in mind that is very schoolish <br/>
(I&#39;m guessing) and speaking as someone who has &quot;taught writing,&quot; I know that <br/>
the idea of writing is VERY very broad and I don&#39;t know whether you&#39;re thinking <br/>
penmanship or three page essays written just because an adult (a teacher or a <br/>
nervous mother) &quot;assigned&quot; a child to write about something in an unnatural <br/>
fashion.  Practice writing, not real writing.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter right now what you&#39;re thinking of as &quot;writing,&quot; just as <br/>

and adjustment.<br/>

learn anything I will be left with regrets and will have messed up <br/>
<br/>
his future.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
An irritating guy in a real-time scheduled online chat once asked me <br/>
(thinking to trip me up badly) &quot;Are you willing to risk your child&#39;s future on your <br/>
&#39;theory&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had one of those lucky moments of time-stood-still clarity, and returned <br/>
&quot;Yes, and so are you&quot; and went on to point out what I had never thought before <br/>
the moment.  People who put their kids in school on the theory (usually <br/>
unexamined) that it&#39;s the best place for them to become successful.<br/>
<br/>
At least I had really thought my &quot;theory&quot; through and was involved every <br/>
single day of my life, unlike this guy, whose kids were going to be in school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is hard, and it must be frustrating for those of you who have been <br/>
<br/>
unschooling for years, but please bear with me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but for your part could you read with the knowledge that everyone had to <br/>
step away from the school and let a lot of their own upbringing, fears, inner <br/>
voices and &quot;knowledge&quot; go?    <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Once the tv is on he is stuck. The house could be on fire and he <br/>
<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to rouse himself. He is like a total zombie and <br/>
<br/>
cannot talk or hear apparently when the set is on.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, I don&#39;t believe it, and it&#39;s a rude thing to say and to have thought <br/>
about your child, that he could be in a burning house and not respond.  Very <br/>
cold.<br/>
<br/>
There are reasons children will ignore other input.  My younger cousin who <br/>
had been abused and neglected, abandoned, taken away by the state and finally <br/>
came to live with us would get stuck to the TV.  She didn&#39;t hear adults talk to <br/>
her, but she heard other kids.  She had just heard all the adult nonsense she <br/>
could stand and didn&#39;t want to hear any more.  <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s watching something that&#39;s really interesting and you interrupt right <br/>
in the middle of a speech, you were wrong and he was right.  If it&#39;s a video <br/>
or DVD, ask him to pause it.  If it&#39;s a tv show, wait for the commercial.   If <br/>
you have been yelling fire in the theatre just to test him, or treating him as <br/>
though your slightest utterance is more important than his near-hour <br/>
investment in a story, he might be learning to tune out in self defense.    And this <br/>
might NOT apply, but I&#39;m braving such a guess because of the disdainful words <br/>
you choose when discussing this.   <br/>
<br/>
If you only interrupt if it&#39;s really important, I bet he will start paying <br/>
attention to your interruptions.  But otherwise, it would be like someone <br/>
picking up a book you&#39;d been reading for a week, tearing out the last chapter and <br/>
throwing it in the fire.  Or maybe just the one page you&#39;re on.   You can miss <br/>
that page.  If not, books have too much of a hold over you.  You&#39;re a zombie.  <br/>
Books should be banned from your life because when you were reading you were <br/>
ignoring the world around you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Not sure if anyone <br/>
<br/>
has read/heard of the book &quot;Set Free Childhood&quot; about television and <br/>
<br/>
how it affects the brain etc. Not comfortable reading and one I <br/>
<br/>
sometimes wish I hadn&#39;t read.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read three anti-TV books, but not that one.<br/>
They were all nonsense from the same source, it seemed to me.<br/>
Really.  <br/>
Even when I didn&#39;t have kids to be fearful about I read one and it seemed so <br/>
trite and unscientific and based on prejudice that I was embarrassed for him.  <br/>
But when prejudice abounds, people will welcome what seems like support for <br/>
their prejudice.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Well, obviously he&#39;s not doing the two things constantly <br/>
<br/>
simultaneously. I had been limiting the tv but if I hadn&#39;t those <br/>
<br/>
would be the two things he would be doing but at different times.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And neither of those (watching TV and playing) is a bad thing to be doing.   <br/>
And if he&#39;s doing even just TWO things at the same time, you wronged him by <br/>
saying &quot;constantly.&quot;   His life should merit your honest and loving regard.  <br/>
You&#39;re writing of him here in a way that suggests a lack of direct seeing of him, <br/>
himself, as the man he will be after you&#39;re gone.   He&#39;s just the young <br/>
version of his whole self.  He&#39;s real now.  He&#39;s whole now.  He&#39;s not a lump you <br/>
can insult and control and mold.   He can be seen that way, but it won&#39;t create <br/>
a good relationship between you and him.   It won&#39;t help you see that what he <br/>
is learning now is what he will grow up with.  Please try not to have him <br/>
learn that his mom doesn&#39;t think much of him and doesn&#39;t see him clearly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And <br/>
<br/>
while I know playing is great I also know that people do need to <br/>
<br/>
learn to read and write and be numerate and I had thought that at 7 <br/>
<br/>
this desire might kick in. Maybe I expect too much.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re expecting to much and too soon.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s what I don&#39;t think you do know:   <br/>
Reading and writing and mathematics can come from playing video games, <br/>
playing with other children, and watching TV and movies.   They can come from <br/>
playing with Lego and other construction things, especially if you get books and <br/>
magazines with patterns, pictures of other people&#39;s creations with captions.  <br/>
Players&#39; guides for video games.  TV schedules.  Books or magazines with <br/>
information on his favorite movies or TV shows could help, but NOT if you get them and <br/>
try to make him read aloud to you.  If you get them and read them TO him, or <br/>
just let him look at the photos, and then put them aside in a safe place for <br/>
him so he can come back and read them later.<br/>
<br/>
Some families throw out too much stuff.  Kirby has ever issue of Nintendo <br/>
Power he ever got.  We bought him magazine boxes and helped him keep them in <br/>
order.  He bought an index with his own money before he could even read, and would <br/>
ask me to look things up.   Because of that index, he learned the notation <br/>
that is also used in much research, the Bible, Shakespeare, which is that if the <br/>
index said 15:38 it meant issue #15, page 38.  That prevented the need EVER <br/>
for explaining what future notations would mean.  Doesn&#39;t matter, either, that <br/>
Shakespeare notations will use Roman numerals in part, because he learned <br/>
Roman numerals from playing Mega Man.<br/>
<br/>
I could ramble on, and in the course of my life I do. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I know we can help you feel better about natural learning, and I know it&#39;s a <br/>
hard step to take.    If you&#39;re able to, in May, there is a big home education <br/>
camp-out called HesFes in the south of England somewhere and you could look <br/>
it up on the internet, or ask on a local list if you&#39;re hooked up there <br/>
already.  If you went there you would probably meet lots of families of different <br/>
persuasions.<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky, before I even thought of homeschooling, to be in a babysitting <br/>
co-op/playgroup with a +/- a dozen families (once as many as 18) and four <br/>
families homeschooled.  Two used structure and curriculum and rules and one poor gir<br/>
l kept being left home, losing the privilege of coming to the park to play <br/>
because she hadn&#39;t &quot;done her math,&quot; or she would be left in the car where she <br/>
could see the kids playing but couldn&#39;t get out.   Two families were <br/>
unschoolers, and I saw how close the parents were with the children, how when the <br/>
children talked the parents really listened, patiently, and happily, and that the <br/>
children WANTED to be with their parents.  I wanted that for my family, so when <br/>
it became apparent that Kirby and kindergarten weren&#39;t a match, I didn&#39;t even <br/>
consider the structured way.  I didn&#39;t want that animosity, that &quot;us and them,&quot; <br/>
that disdain.<br/>

I have debated long and hard all day about if and what I would reply to your <br/>
email.<br/>
I have lurked long enough to know that you do upset people and the &quot;if you <br/>
want us to tell you what a wonderful mum you are then you&#39;ve come to the wrong <br/>
place&quot; reply gets trotted out if people voice any upset. I didn&#39;t want to be <br/>
told I was wonderful, you don&#39;t know me so how could you? But I didn&#39;t want to <br/>
be told I was crap either, you don&#39;t know me so how could you?<br/>
<br/>
However, I could not let your post go by without a reply.<br/>
I don&#39;t have the luxury of lots of time on the computer, much less to post, <br/>
and anything I do post is written mainly off the cuff.<br/>
I appreciate I should triple check but sometimes I get to a point where I <br/>
would like help and so take the risk that my posts will be given the benefit of <br/>
the doubt. It&#39;s a tough call, seek the advice I need and write it in a hurry <br/>
and hope it&#39;s taken in the spirit it&#39;s meant or to muddle along on my own.<br/>
<br/>
What particularly upset me was your response to my trying to explain how <br/>
involved my son gets when watching tv. Yes, my remark about burning houses should <br/>
have been a little more thought out. <br/>
But perhaps *you* should phrase your words a little more carefully.<br/>
Perhaps you should have a less judgemental take on what others write.<br/>
Perhaps you should walk a mile in someone&#39;s shoe, metophorically speaking, <br/>
before writing such stuff.<br/>
Perhaps you should think about how many people you turn off looking for help <br/>
because they have been so hurt by what you have written.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if I&#39;ll ever post again, primarily because people don&#39;t appear <br/>
to be given the benefit of the doubt that what they write is not meant <br/>
literally, that they might be rushed or distracted, that words are not carefully <br/>
written so as not to upset.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt you&#39;ll write a nice reply back, very eloquently put, with lots of <br/>
nifty soundbites refuting word for word everything I have said. I haven&#39;t got <br/>
the time or energy to get into it. I just wish you, like me, had thought a <br/>
little more before putting fingers to keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
By the way I detest and refute the inference that my son gets so caught up in <br/>
tv because of abuse/nagging/whatever from adults. You don&#39;t know me and you <br/>
don&#39;t know him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s taken a lot of guts for me to post originally and to post this. I didn&#39;t <br/>
want to get into a row. I just wanted some help in finding a way to be <br/>
confident in unschooling, not to be swayed by those around me and to find peace on <br/>
my path. Sometimes I do lose sight of my son, but I wanted ways to block out <br/>
all the stuff that distracts me.<br/>
I have no idea if  I will ever find any of that. Obviously if I could on my <br/>
own I wouldn&#39;t have written in the first place. <br/>

I have children.  I went to school.  I taught school.  I was afraid of <br/>
unschooling.  Now I&#39;m not.<br/>
<br/>
If I can change, other people can change.<br/>
<br/>
People who want to unschool don&#39;t have forever to decide to do it.  Their <br/>
children are getting older by the minute.   The window will eventually close.  <br/>
And the more schoolish teaching they do, the more they will have to undo.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps you should think about how many people you turn off looking for <br/>
help <br/>
because they have been so hurt by what you have written.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Luckily I&#39;m not the only unschooler volunteering to help other people on my <br/>
own time then, or with the website I pay for, on the computer my husband bought <br/>
so I could do this.    People have options.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have no idea if I&#39;ll ever post again, primarily because people don&#39;t <br/>
appear <br/>
to be given the benefit of the doubt that what they write is not meant <br/>
literally, that they might be rushed or distracted, that words are not <br/>
carefully <br/>
written so as not to upset.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Words reflect thought.  <br/>
If you think that way when you&#39;re rushed, it&#39;s the way you think.  If you <br/>
unthinkingly, unconsciously chose those phrases to describe your child, then they <br/>
are in you, close to the surface, where others can see them and read them.<br/>
<br/>
You chose the words, I just quoted them back.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get angry with the mirror.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I haven&#39;t got the time or energy to get into it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling does take time and energy.  You NEED to find time and energy.<br/>
You don&#39;t need to spend it on this list if you don&#39;t want to, but without <br/>
your putting effort and time into changing, unschooling won&#39;t be a viable option <br/>
for you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;By the way I detest and refute the inference that my son gets so caught up <br/>
in <br/>
tv because of abuse/nagging/whatever from adults. You don&#39;t know me and you <br/>
don&#39;t know him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now many parallel situations would satisfy you that I&#39;ve seen it before many <br/>
times?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes I do lose sight of my son, but I wanted ways to block out <br/>
all the stuff that distracts me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see that anything I wrote or that anyone else wrote was intended to <br/>
do anything except point you away from your blockages and directly toward your <br/>
son.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people who don&#39;t really want to unschool find someone to blame.  <br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s me.   Their blame doesn&#39;t make me guilty.<br/>

And how good will it really be?<br/>
<br/>
There are some people who do phone consultation.   The GWS office (which  no <br/>

consultation, and has for years.   Someone who spoke at a conference I attended does <br/>
phone consultations.   Like $60 an hour, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s someone in England doing that.<br/>

sounds like you just want to keep doing what you&#39;re doing but you wanted to claim <br/>
you had investigated other methods.  I&#39;m not just guessing on this.  Others <br/>
who have been similarly defensive in the past have come back and described how <br/>
they felt, and how they eventually DID think about the things they read <br/>
wherever---here, at unschooling.com, on the old AOL forum---and it started to make <br/>
sense to them.<br/>
<br/>
We, people on those sources named right above have received a few dozen <br/>
apologies from people who will say &quot;I thought you were all mean and crazy, but then <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-386960021">***The problem is that I still don&#39;t feel confident or at peace with <br/>
what I&#39;m doing, worry constantly and keep changing my approach. This <br/>
has got to change!***<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a belief that ritual in religious practice will keep a body on<br/>
the right path - even if the mind forgets for a time where it wanted to<br/>
go.   By staying on the path one will eventually end up in the desired<br/>
location. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t get comfortable with unschooling until you&#39;re unschooling.  You<br/>
have to *do* it. <br/>
You won&#39;t be confident or at peace until you really believe in natural<br/>
learning and you really trust your kids. <br/>
You can&#39;t have hold of dreams about academic achievement in one hand and<br/>
ideas about natural learning in the other and be at peace about<br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Read, absorb, live it,  and trust.  <br/>
<br/>
***if I let him do exactly what he wants he will just watch tv<br/>
constantly.***<br/>
<br/>
He really wont.  He might for awhile until he finds other things he wants<br/>
to do, but he wont always and only want TV forever.   <br/>
<br/>
***his behaviour worsens, he gets headaches ***<br/>
<br/>
You might rub his shoulders if he&#39;s been sitting for a long time.  You<br/>
could bring him snacks to keep his energy up.  You might watch with him<br/>
so he feels your support instead of your worry - if he&#39;s felt that, and<br/>
those things might make him more comfortable and let you feel like you&#39;re<br/>
working with him instead of against him.  <br/>
<br/>
***and isnt&#39;t active or using his imagination when he&#39;s stuck in front of<br/>
the box all the time.***<br/>
<br/>
Can he bounce on the furniture and hop around and stand on his head?  If<br/>
you have rules about not doing those things ( I know some families do)<br/>
(If you could see my furniture you&#39;d understand we&#39;re not one of those<br/>
families&lt;g&gt;)  you could lift them and give him more freedom to be active<br/>
while watching.  For several months Dylan watched everything upside down<br/>
with his feet waving around in the air.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think TV is a wonderful for the imagination.  He might be living out<br/>
all kinds of exciting things you aren&#39;t aware of.   I know there are a<br/>
lot of mainstream theories about the evils of TV, but if you let go of<br/>
that and trust your kids, you&#39;ll come to all kinds of new thinking on the<br/>
subject. <br/>
<br/>
***He also plays constantly, mostly with my eldest daughter. Which is <br/>
fine but I worry that he isn&#39;t learning *anything*.  ***<br/>
<br/>
Play is the way people learn.   Some legislators are pushing for<br/>
mandatory preschool for three year olds because kids are learning so much<br/>
in those early years, and they think (among other things)  they can give<br/>
them a early start.  But the reason kids learn so much before they&#39;re<br/>
five is because they are free to play.  After that parents start fussing<br/>
about school work and teachers start pushing reading and all at once your<br/>
bright kid who learned to walk and talk and dress himself and feed<br/>
himself, ride a bike - who can name every dinosaur found in the Hell<br/>
Creek formation and work the dvd player and master countless, challenging<br/>
video games is suddenly learning disabled, or disordered or something.  <br/>
Hmmm. <br/>
<br/>
Let him play.    <br/>
<br/>
*** Do you think parents and children have to be of a certain personality<br/>
to successfully unschool?***<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Parents have to believe learning is natural and they have to trust<br/>
their kids.  They have to look at their kids and see what&#39;s right about<br/>
them, not what others think might be wrong.  They have to see value in<br/>
everything in life.  They have to see value in their kids choices.  They<br/>
have to really like their kids and want to be with them. <br/>
<br/>
***I feel I&#39;ve made so many mistakes, ***<br/>
<br/>
Every parent feels that way.  We all have things we&#39;d change if we could.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone who is unschooling now had to think about the difference between<br/>
a life with school and a life without.   Most of us went to school and<br/>
have had to overcome our brainwashing and self doubt.  These things<br/>
aren&#39;t unique to you.   Every moment is an opportunity for you to do it<br/>
better. The next minute might be the minute you get it exactly right. <br/>
You don&#39;t have to wait until tomorrow.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m writing this after reading several other posts from you.  I hope you<br/>
can read without it feeling personal.  There probably isn&#39;t a parent here<br/>
who hasn&#39;t had to examine their thinking in certain areas in order to get<br/>
comfortable with unschooling and live more peacefully with their kids.  <br/>

arguments with you guys.<br/>
So now, say what you like. I really don&#39;t want to go into this any more. (And <br/>
no, not because I&#39;m not tolerant, can&#39;t take criticism, etc but because of <br/>
time).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005481038"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ***his behaviour worsens, he gets headaches ***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I suggested recently on a different thread that we need to separate<br/>
our reactions to kids&#39; choices from our reactions to the consequences of<br/>
their choices.<br/>
<br/>
We shouldn&#39;t see our purpose as preventing kids from making decisions with<br/>
bad consequences. We should see our purpose as helping them make decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Not help them make the &quot;right&quot; (e.g., the one&#39;s we&#39;d make) decisions, but<br/>
help them make decisions.<br/>
<br/>
So a child who gets cranky and headaches from watching too much TV needs<br/>
help deciding what to do about the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
What if a kid got cranky and headaches from reading all day?<br/>
<br/>
(That might not be a good analogy among conventional parents. But I hope<br/>
people here would see reading all day as a good thing :-)<br/>
<br/>
Would the response be to limit reading?<br/>
<br/>
Or would a better response be to help him see the connection between<br/>
something that&#39;s causing a problem with him or the family and what he&#39;s<br/>
doing while reading (too inactive, a position he&#39;s frozen into or whatever).<br/>
And then come up with ways he can handle that. Maybe he&#39;d choose to read<br/>
less at one sitting. Or move around while reading. Or set a timer. Or ask<br/>
mom to remind him to move. Or decide it was worth feeling cranky but work on<br/>
ways to not snap at family members. Or ...<br/>
