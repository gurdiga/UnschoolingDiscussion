party. DH went with him. They had a &quot;ball&quot; (sorry, bad pun). The testosterone <br/>
was flying. Though admittedly I think I&#39;d have fun. Did anybody see &quot;10 <br/>
Things I Hate About You&quot;; the teenagers went paintballing? <br/>
<br/>
Eric is now determined he wants to purchase his own paintball set-up. &quot;The <br/>
rental guns are poor quality, Mom.&quot; He&#39;s researched on the web, talked with <br/>
other owners, shopped, saved his money, found other ways to earn money, drawn <br/>
pictures of the ideal paintball gun, etc. Amazing the details he&#39;s learned. <br/>
<br/>
Eric and I watched the Western Channel last week. Lots of old classics: Roy <br/>
Rogers, Lone Ranger, Gunsmoke, Gene Autry, John Wayne. He was in heaven. By <br/>
the next day, he&#39;d made a leather holster for his resurrected toy guns <br/>
thenwas ambushing pretend &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That night the same child was crying over the atrocities during the Vietnam <br/>
War after we watched &quot;When We Were Soldiers&quot; with Mel Gibson. He couldn&#39;t <br/>
understand how anyone could commit such acts of violence. I told him he <br/>
wasn&#39;t alone in his lack of understanding.<br/>

One thing Marty is getting for Christmas is a set of toy guns.  Just cheap <br/>
Walmart-TootsieToy six shooters.   He had a set long ago, and they broke.  He <br/>
got a set last year to use for Halloween.  He learned a bunch of tricks with <br/>
them.  One broke.  His tricks weren&#39;t as good one-handed.   He tried glueing <br/>
it.   He doesn&#39;t &quot;play with them,&quot; he just does the tricks, or wears them <br/>
with his duster for fun while they play western-theme role playing or card <br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
So for Christmas I got him TWO sets of guns, matching, so when one breaks he <br/>
still has a pair and when a second one breaks he STILL has a pair.<br/>
<br/>
At thirteen-nearly-fourteen, if he had grown up in the house I grew up in, he <br/>
would have a real gun by now, and been hunting.   If he really had an <br/>
interest, he could be going target shooting now with friends of ours who go.  <br/>
He&#39;s never even asked to see the one rifle we do own, which we inherited from <br/>
a buckskinner friend of ours who hunted and trapped in Colorado and Alaska, <br/>
and died on an icy night.   His name was Marty.  That&#39;s why Marty&#39;s named <br/>
Marty.   Still, our Marty at an age to use real guns has no interest, and <br/>
will not be happily amused to get toy guns for Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby have been paintballing once.  They had a blast, but it&#39;s <br/>
expensive, and they  just haven&#39;t made it back.  Their dad took them. It was <br/>
a work-organized outing for families (mostly or exclusively dads and sons, <br/>
but that&#39;s okay with me).  The stuff washed out really easily.<br/>
