<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267980980">This morning when I got out of bed, much later than usual, I was cranky. I <br/>
felt out of sync because of sleeping in and got busy with all the things I <br/>
had to do. Found my very pregnant neighbor is on bed rest to get to 36 weeks <br/>
without having baby first,  and needed to make her some supper, have a grumpy <br/>
20month old , dirty dishes, dirty house, wanted desparately to have a shower, <br/>
the phone kept ringing. Needed to get supper for my husband to take to work <br/>
on his afternoon shift, etc etc. Overwhelmed I guess. My poor 7 year old was <br/>
full of ideas for things for us to do, and I couldn&#39;t do them cause I was so <br/>
busy. No time for that stuff!!<br/>
I finally got the cooking over with, had a shower, even got dressed. Did I <br/>
mention that the &quot;Lovely&quot; in-laws dropped by with their &quot;delightful&quot; <br/>
pomeranian to pick up some of my horse manure for their plants, looked <br/>
horrified with my daughter in nothing but her diaper(her choice, not mine) <br/>
and left.(Yaay)<br/>
When everything that could be done was done and my husband left for work, I <br/>
asked my son if he wanted to go down the road to the regional park at the <br/>
river. We decided to do this. How perfect!!! No one else was at the place, <br/>
and we walked to the river&#39;s edge and threw rocks and sticks. We listened to <br/>
the birds, the wind, the water. My daughter walked in the water with her <br/>
shoes on. At first I tried to stop her, but, wise child that she is , she <br/>
ignored me. She simply continued to delight in the rocks, water, wind, sticks <br/>
and birds. My son enjoyed the sound of a stick whipping in the air, water, <br/>
dirt. We found rocks with cracks, stripes, colors. The same stick formation <br/>
his dear friend built last year was still there. We talked about the friend, <br/>
who has since moved. We looked at the swimming hole, saw minnows, deer poop, <br/>
compared it with the moose poop. <br/>
A magical afternoon right when a tired frazzled mom needed it. Again and <br/>
again my kids can catch me when I am falling, and help me see the wonder of <br/>
the small things.I feel so blessed to have this time with them, and to have <br/>
their help in preserving my sense of awe at the world.<br/>
This list has done this for me as well. I don&#39;t often post because so many <br/>
times people have already said what I wanted to say, only better. Keep it <br/>
coming everyone, don&#39;t hold back. This is what is changing my life, the <br/>
support and discussion I read every day.<br/>
