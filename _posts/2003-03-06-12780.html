<div id="ygrps-yiv-869908810">[I&#39;m sending this to a couple of lists, so if you see it twice, I&#39;m sorry, <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Feburary 27, Thursday at noon my husband took me to the airport.  I was <br/>
really well prepared.  I had been ready to go for over 24 hours.  That has <br/>
never happened before.  It happened because I was afraid.   <br/>
<br/>
I left Albuquerque around 2:00, stayed a long time in Minneapolis, and ended <br/>
up in Saskatoon at 11:30 at night.<br/>
<br/>
Customs was only concerned about my jerkey.  It was sealed, and American, so <br/>
I could keep it.<br/>
<br/>
Ian and Barbie, who were the conference coordinators who had arranged for me <br/>
to be there, met me right away.  I had planned to get cash at the airport, <br/>
but spaced it, being tired and my foot hurting, and their car being RIGHT <br/>
there, right outside the door.<br/>
<br/>
The Saskatoon Inn was really  near the airport and GORGEOUS inside--kind of a <br/>
jungle in the middle, with walkways and places to sit, and a pool, and just a <br/>
maze of pretty little nooks and turns.  Restaurant and bar and hot tub and <br/>
little lounge areas all mixed in there in that open area with big tropical <br/>
plants.<br/>
<br/>
Up on the second floor, where there was a balcony/hallway overlooking all <br/>
that, I met Ian&#39;s #1 and #1 children, young adults, and a son-in-law.  Very <br/>
nice people.   <br/>
<br/>
When I got to my room, 627, with a view of snow-covered flatness and a few <br/>
businesses, but mostly bare prairie to the horizon, I realized I had not one <br/>
dollar of Canadian money, and my tapes were being delivered the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, I had half a sprite and half a bottle of orange juice in my pack, <br/>
and a bunch of nuts and jerkey, so I wasn&#39;t going to starve.<br/>
<br/>
Downstairs was an ATM but it didn&#39;t deal in VISA, only Master Card.<br/>
<br/>
Things eventually worked out, though.<br/>
<br/>
February 28, Friday I went to put my things near the conference rooms, and <br/>
went toward the restaurant.  Someone called me from up on the ramp, &quot;Mrs. <br/>
Dodd?&quot;   I almost didn&#39;t hear it because of the water and all.    I went back <br/>
and it was a TV reporter who wanted to interview me.  So I went all the way <br/>
back up to the ballroom.  She and the cameraman were especially friendly and <br/>
open, unlike what I was used to with dressed-up and officious and abrupt TV <br/>
people.  Very nice.  She asked me to summarize my opening talk, and asked me <br/>
a bit about homeschooling in general.  I asked when it would be on and she <br/>
said that it was a local station, and the news repeated every hour, so if I <br/>
turned it on at the top of any hour I&#39;d see it.  Except when the hockey game <br/>
was on.<br/>
<br/>
I was the first speaker, at 1:00.  The announcements and greetings were after <br/>
my talk.  I had just sent Ian a list of all the talks I&#39;d ever done and he <br/>
had chosen some, so I was doing &quot;What Teachers Know that You Don&#39;t Know.&quot;  <br/>
There being no alternative, everyone who was already there was at that <br/>
presentation, and I&#39;m not good with numbers, but I&#39;m thinking it was over 300 <br/>
people.  Very big group.  I&#39;ve never spoken to a larger group, I don&#39;t think. <br/>
   That particular talk is better suited to a smaller group, but it worked <br/>
out, and when I finished a bit early, I was really glad that there were a <br/>
couple of teachers in the audience who were willing to come to the audience <br/>
mike and back up my assertion that most of what teachers learn isn&#39;t useful <br/>
to homeschoolers anyway, being as it is mostly about group management, tests <br/>
and measures, school politics and record keeping, and so forth.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a break after that, and I set up a table in the hall to sell tapes <br/>
and Thinking Sticks.  I don&#39;t think I sold any that first session, but I did <br/>
talk to people without pause for the couple of hours between sessions, and I <br/>
spoke at 4:30 on Unschooling.   The group was smaller, but still over 100.  <br/>
Maybe 175 people?  (If anyone reading this was there and actually counted or <br/>
is better at estimation, feel VERY free to correct my numbers.)<br/>
<br/>
That talk went really well and everybody got a Certificate of Empowerment, <br/>
but the photos of the kids didn&#39;t make it all the way around.  I brought them <br/>
out again the next day, though, and also kept them out on the table for <br/>
people to see.<br/>
<br/>
After that I sat at the table some more, sold some tapes, and officers of the <br/>
group gave me a Subway sandwich which was homey (foodwise) and friendly <br/>
(because I didn&#39;t have to put my stuff away to go and eat).<br/>
<br/>
I had planned to go back to the room , put my foot up a while, and watch &quot;An <br/>
American in Canada,&quot; a sitcom which had been advertised the night before on <br/>
TV.  And then, I figured, the hour would turn and I&#39;d see myself on TV, and <br/>
then I&#39;d venture back out and socialize.<br/>
<br/>
The sitcom, turns out, was the premier episode.  It involved a guy moving <br/>
from Phoenix to Calgary to do the morning news show.  (I read later that it <br/>
was filmed in Toronto and that the actor playing the American was from <br/>
Toronto too, but that&#39;s okay.)  <br/>
<br/>
On the local channel 10, the hockey game was on.  Minor leagues, I think, <br/>
local team, Saskatoon Blades, happy to have a guy who had grown up there <br/>
having lately left some other team and come to play for them.  I&#39;d switch <br/>
channels, and read, and check back.  Next hour; game still on.<br/>
<br/>
I called home and talked to Kirby and Holly.  Keith and Marty had gone to see <br/>
Daredevil.  I asked Kirby to e-mail two unschooling lists to say I was having <br/>
a good time.<br/>
<br/>
Hour; hockey.<br/>
Hour; hockey commentary.  Discussion of the game, of other teams, of hockey, <br/>
of the fund raiser involving tie-dyed jerseys on tie-dyed night (or <br/>
something).<br/>
<br/>
It was 10:00 and I was getting sleepy, but forced myself to stay awake until <br/>
11:00.  <br/>
<br/>
Saw myself on TV.  Also the president of the provincial group hosting the <br/>
conference.  Her last name is Dodds.  She looked and sounded marvelous.  I <br/>
sounded great, looked like a person who should REALLY get a haircut, wear <br/>
makeup and maybe lose 50 pounds before ever being on TV ever.  <br/>
<br/>
Decided 11:15 was too late to hobble downstairs and socialize, and my foot <br/>
was fat.  Went merrily to sleep in a big bed in a dark room all by myself.<br/>
<br/>
March 1, Saturday, went to breakfast.  Ended up sitting and talking to a <br/>
couple who had heard me the day before.  Another couple of moms had also <br/>
asked if I wanted to sit with them, but they&#39;d already actually eaten, and <br/>
the young couple had a baby, so I told them getting to sit with a baby won <br/>
out, and they totally understood.<br/>
<br/>
I went and sat with my tapes and sticks.  Sold quite a few.  Talked to lots <br/>
of people.  Spoke twice in the afternoon,  Dwindling crowd, which was totally <br/>
understandable, because the alternative talks were interesting and some <br/>
people had heard me already.  <br/>
The first talk was Having Confidence in Yourself, and was (naturally) also <br/>
about unschooling, but was pretty much the same outline as the article <br/>
&quot;Disposable Checklists,&quot; because that&#39;s where that article came from.    Then <br/>
I did the game &quot;That&#39;s Not Educational,&quot; and gave a prize for baggie twist <br/>
ties.   Only one person in there had not already heard me speak, and after a <br/>
few items thrown out to be shown to be educational, it just turned into <br/>
questions and answers and that was fine.  <br/>
<br/>
I had moved my sales table inside the room and had been selling things <br/>
between talks, and sold some more after.  <br/>
<br/>
People had been wonderfully friendly and open and complimentary and <br/>
communicative.  I had a GREAT  time talking to people.  Even those who were <br/>
disagreeing with me were really nice about it.  (&quot;Of course, they&#39;re <br/>
Canadians,&quot; one person who wasn&#39;t born Canadian or American either one told <br/>
me when I said that.)  But both attendees and organizers were thanking me for <br/>
being so available between talks, and for being so down to earth and <br/>
friendly.  It made me feel really good.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I packed up and went back to the room, having fulfilled my obligation.<br/>
<br/>
But I wasn&#39;t through.  <br/>
<br/>
A largish group of unschoolers had chosen not to attend the conference for <br/>
socio-political reasons.  I was sympathetic, because the New Mexico state <br/>
organization totally broke down and dissolved when unschoolers ran the state <br/>
conference one year.  We couldn&#39;t survive unless we let the Christians run <br/>
everything, and they were unwilling to really share power and opportunity.  <br/>
So something at least vaguely similar was going on in Saskatoon.  Rather than <br/>
ask to be told the details I just said I would talk to the other faction as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that wasn&#39;t wholly right and good, but Saskatoon&#39;s a long way off, <br/>
and my personal motivation is to help people unschool more confidently and <br/>
peacefully.  Yes, it would have been easier for me if they&#39;d just gone to the <br/>
conference, but I do understand when groups split out over such philosophical <br/>
issues.  And I had no contract saying I couldn&#39;t speak anywhere else.  So <br/>
although it was unfair that the smaller group piggybacked (the word used by <br/>
someone in the larger group when complaining lightly about it) on the <br/>
conference, I didn&#39;t feel too guilty, because I had gone above and beyond <br/>
what I had been paid to do.  Except for the evening waiting to see the news <br/>
blurb, I had been fully available to anyone who wanted to talk to me, and had <br/>
done four presentations.<br/>
<br/>
I was fetched and taken to a Unitarian Church where there were desserts and <br/>
maybe 25 people.  Some had been at the conference as well.  That session just <br/>
turned into me telling stories, which seemed okay.  There were some questions <br/>
and answers about younger kids reading and writing, about older kids&#39; social <br/>
stuff, about parents&#39; fears and the world changing.  I enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
Then I was privileged to stay in a guest bedroom which was a Barbie museum!<br/>
<br/>
In the morning, March 2, a breakfast buffet at a different hotel was attended <br/>
by maybe (you&#39;d think I could count a group THIS small) fifteen people.   We <br/>
laughed and told stories and were philosophical and ate good food, and then I <br/>
was given a ride to the airport!<br/>
<br/>
Two or three hours with a stop in Regina without changing planes.  Very white <br/>
and cold.   Minneapolis for four hours of magazine reading.  I thought of <br/>
calling Susan Bundlie but I was afraid she&#39;d feel bad for not picking me up <br/>
and I didn&#39;t really want to eat and I was almost too exhausted to think.  So <br/>
I read about Ben Affleck and watched CNN news and kinda vegetated.<br/>
<br/>
I had been afraid customs would question me about the leftover tapes (though <br/>
I&#39;d sold more than half of the hundred I had had copied in Canada).  I had <br/>
traded my sack of cash to someone with an American account for a check.  <br/>
Canadians don&#39;t have $1 bills anymore.  $5 is the smallest, so selling things <br/>
for $8 and $15 nets a bunch of $2 and $1 coins.  But all customs cared about <br/>
was the egg decorating kit.  Juxtaposed with my necklace (a brass pierce-work <br/>
plaque) it came to look like a knife in the x-rays, so my backpack was <br/>
searched.  They didn&#39;t care anything about my carefully documented tapes with <br/>
the shrinkwrap and the Canadian receipt.  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I was met in Albuquerque by Keith and Holly, who had happy stories of the <br/>
weekend. Nobody had told Keith I had called on Friday.  I had only brought <br/>
gifts for Holly.  A Canada patch for her jean jacket which has lots of <br/>
patches (and she did go to Ontario a few years ago), a girls&#39; magazine, a <br/>
math workbook (because she finished her Animaniacs workbook a couple of weeks <br/>
ago, and this one looked like the kind of geometrical and fractions stuff she <br/>
likes), and I gave her the egg decorating kit I had been given as a gift from <br/>
the unschooling group Saturday night.   Carol Narigon made and gave us a <br/>
decorated Easter egg and Holly had said she thought she could do that, but I <br/>
said I didn&#39;t know how and special equipment was needed.  Tadaaa!  Special <br/>
equipment and instructions.<br/>
<br/>
I was just brain-tired for a couple of days after getting home.  I&#39;ve finally <br/>
done my laundry, but haven&#39;t yet put papers away.<br/>
<br/>
People in Saskatchewan were very friendly.  I had a way better time than I <br/>
thought i would have.  I was afraid I&#39;d be all alone surrounded by strangers, <br/>
but it never felt that way from the moment I saw Ian and Barbie at the <br/>
airport.</div>

&lt;&lt; I know there are going to be lovely memories of <br/>
the SC conference this year too, I just KNOW it! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are LOTS of lovely memores of the SC conference.<br/>
<br/>
You mean you think *I* will have lovely memories?<br/>
(I&#39;m looking forward to the possibility.) <br/>
<br/>
The progress on the leg is this:<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t set off any airport security alarms.  Either they&#39;re not looking <br/>
for internal metal, or they didn&#39;t use metal.  What does anybody know about <br/>
that?  After the security lovely assistant telling people in the Albuquerque <br/>
line to take cowboy boots off because the nails would set off the alarm, my <br/>
leg with it&#39;s 12 screws and plate just goes through not a single beep.<br/>
<br/>
But...  three weeks ago I nearly whimpered (no wait, I did say &quot;I can&#39;t walk <br/>
that fast, I broke my leg a few months ago) when I asked for help finding <br/>
oven cleaner at Smith&#39;s and the very nice and quick-paced young checker said <br/>
&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll show you where it is!&quot; and where it was was about 1/3 of a mile <br/>
over freshly waxed floor.  I was scared and in pain and wanted to say &quot;Never <br/>
mind oven cleaner, I only have enough strength to limp to my car.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
BUT this weekend I myself without ever flagging down the golf cart things <br/>
walked a long long way (sometimes on moving sidewalks in the Minneapolis <br/>
airport).  Well over half a mile each time, but not on scary floors.  <br/>
Northwest Airlines has more gates in Minneapolis than most airports have <br/>
total of all gates.  And I was going to disposable towns with funny names, so <br/>
those are at far ends.<br/>
<br/>
So I can walk wherever I want to without getting too exhausted, and I only <br/>
limp a little, and my ankle is fat when I see it at bedtime, but I go to <br/>
sleep with hot cornbags on either side of it and wake up better every day.<br/>

Glad to hear you are on the mend.  sometimes when I glance at my ankle on the <br/>
support cushion at the end of the day, it&#39;s impossible to think it is <br/>
improving.  But I took the kids to the children&#39;s museum alone and stood for <br/>
an hour and a half on it, so it must be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That and the surgery is what I&#39;m dreading.  The surgeon says that because I&#39;m <br/>
fairly active, enjoy exercising every day, like to snowshoe, etc. the screws <br/>
and pins are going to bother me eventually.  Particularly the pins, which are <br/>
going through the joint.  Screws can pop and poke up painfully against  the <br/>
skin.  I&#39;ve felt that already.<br/>
<br/>
But it might also depend on the location of all this metal.  Maybe because <br/>
mine is at the ankle and through the ankle joint, it&#39;s more likely to be <br/>
bothersome?  My sister just had a couple of screws taken out of her <br/>
collarbone, but she&#39;s a triathlete and insanely active.  I can&#39;t imagine that <br/>
being a place that gets a high proportion of stress from normal activity.<br/>
<br/>
Bone growing back through holes.  Yuck, that makes me squeemish and makes my <br/>
wrists hurt (for some reason the insides of my wrists always tingle when I&#39;m <br/>
reacting to a gross thought).  But the recovery has to be quicker than the <br/>
break.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you didn&#39;t set off the metal detectors.  People are always telling me I <br/>
will, but I haven&#39;t flown in three years now.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422664894">I had the same thing done 5 years ago.  The plate and screws are still <br/>
there.  They told me that the bone would eventually integrate itself <br/>

I also wondered if my leg would trigger metal detector in airport? <br/>
 Guess, from your experience, that it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
You are brave to have traveled from warm temperature to the cold of <br/>
Saskatoon that soon.  I found that changes in temperature got my ankle <br/>

here and my leg is swollen.<br/>

But you are making me wonder why I&#39;m having all the metal removed.<br/>

I&#39;m unlikely to exercise the screws out of my bone in the relatively short <br/>
time I have to live.  If I were a 20 year old gymnast I&#39;d be scheduling me <br/>
some surgery.  (And I might anyway, to do it before the considerations of <br/>
who&#39;s paying for it are too old.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK, now I take offense!  I&#39;m the queen of the sloths.  I just happen to like <br/>
exercising to get my brain going - and my goal is breakfast.  But I am 39, a <br/>
bit younger than you.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I was more thinking about how I&#39;m blindly following my surgeon&#39;s <br/>
schedule and not seeking other advice about my screws and pins.  He&#39;s just <br/>
always said it would have to come out and it never occurred to me there would <br/>
be another option.  You two have opened my eyes and got those wheels turning <br/>
in my head.<br/>
