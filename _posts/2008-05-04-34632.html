What do you want to be when you grow up?<br/>
As happy as I am right now.<br/>

Isn&#39;t that sweet?  I like that one a lot.<br/>
<br/>
This one, I plan to register a complaint about:<br/>

Do you get along with your parents?<br/>
Pretty much.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pretty much&quot;!?  Compared to WHAT?  I want her to say &quot;Perfectly  <br/>
well, absolutely, my parents are practically perfect in every way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so I agreed with this one:<br/>

Are you annoying?<br/>
Oh, yes.<br/>

  LOL. Here in Minesooota &quot;Pretty Much&quot; equals a strong &quot;Absolutely&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  If I ask :<br/>
  &quot; Honey are you happy you married me?&quot;<br/>
  to this he replies:<br/>
  &quot;Pretty much&quot;<br/>
  and I know he loves me a lot&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  It took some time geting used to it since I am a hot blooded Brazilian.<br/>
  A friend gave the book How to Talk Minnesotan and it helped a lot.<br/>

<br/>
And my Dad, when responding to something like: Do you like such and such...&quot;, he&#39;ll answer: they&#39;re/it&#39;s OK.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s his way of saying yes or they&#39;re nice etc. I&#39;ve asked him so many times to clarify - &quot;so, do you not like them so much or what?&quot; and he answers:&quot; no, they&#39;re OK.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know now that it means pretty darn good and that&#39;s just his lingo. It&#39;s only taken me 36 years to get it. LOL<br/>
