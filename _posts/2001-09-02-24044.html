the person supervising.  If rehab honey wants to see him boy when he gets <br/>
out, meet him at the park.  I wouldn&#39;t let him to talk to him on the phone <br/>
because you have no way of knowing what he&#39;s saying and whether it&#39;s <br/>
appropriate given his new status of early recovery.  If he does get clean (at <br/>
least 1 year) then you can talk about how you can both handle raising him.  <br/>
When I was in rehab 16 years ago they told us only 3 in 10 will say clean for <br/>
1 year and only  1 in 10 will stay clean 5 years or longer.  I wanted to be <br/>
the &quot;1&quot;, so I guess it depends on how much he wants to get clean and have his <br/>
family in his life.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you the best at this time.... I can&#39;t imagine having kids and having <br/>
to deal with this issue.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>we did the whole park thing before, didn&#39;t really work out. sometimes he <br/>
would just miss them and my son would be very upset. it would be great for <br/>
him to stay clean, but i&#39;m not looking for that to happen. i&#39;ve kind of got <br/>
it in my head that if he stays clean, we can work into more free visitation, <br/>
and if not....just stay gone. i don&#39;t want to remove the possibility of a <br/>
relationship between father and son, but i also feel like it&#39;s more harmful <br/>
than helpful for my son to see him once or twice then not again for a couple <br/>
months. i don&#39;t want to be overcontrolling, but i think at this point in his <br/>
life, it&#39;s my responsibility to limit chaotic harmful relationships.<br/>
my son not having his father in his life is far from ideal, but i think <br/>
complete absence would be better than back and forth. <br/>

&lt;&lt; I truly am fascinated by this subject, it&#39;s not sarcasm when I say that I<br/>
 *never* would have imagined that on this of all lists people would say that<br/>
 they shout in anger at their children and don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s wrong (I can<br/>
 understand shouting in anger and feeling dreadful about it and trying to<br/>
 stop, but the idea that it&#39;s perfectly all right to do that with your own<br/>
 family is honestly astounding to me. Seriously.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I just wrote about our original families yelling and how I yell. I do <br/>
feel really shitty after yelling most of the time. Just wanted to clarify. If <br/>
I could have a wish granted it would be to be Zen mommy. That said I still <br/>
feel yelling is better than a calm parent who shames and blames or calls <br/>
names. I witnessed this this weekend. No clenched teeth just a parent <br/>
saying&quot;stop being a brat&quot;. All said w/ a smile and going on about the <br/>
business. personally I think people act a behavior they are not the behavior. <br/>
this is more damaging than yelling. <br/>

&lt;&lt; f they get angry enough to be saying &quot;I&#39;m tired of ....&quot; or &quot;SOMEONE moved <br/>
 my...&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t find my...&quot; I let them finish their tirade and if I did <br/>
 the bad thing, I say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I did that.  It&#39;s in the den.&quot;   Or <br/>
whatever <br/>
 it is.  Sometimes I ask if they could try to ask nicer next time.  But <br/>
 usually when someone comes to that point they are tired, hungry, sick or <br/>
 pressed for time.  And since I expect them to keep their word and be <br/>
punctual <br/>
 AND I let them sleep late, sometimes I myself have contributed to the <br/>
 situation.  So it&#39;s the same as if another adult friend of mine were <br/>
freaking <br/>
 out about not having the key or checkbook or receipt or phone number needed <br/>
 for the imminent need.  I let them vent and then we fix the situation up.<br/>

yelling b/c it was becoming habitual that day. Kinda like she was PMSing at 5 <br/>
years old. So yes my dd yells at me too. Did I create this or is this nature? <br/>
As I said before this kid is a loud one from birth.?????????<br/>

<br/>
Now in our family, no one would think twice about that and no one would<br/>
consider it name calling.  Our phrase is &quot;don&#39;t be such a jerk&quot; which<br/>
translates into &quot;I really don&#39;t like what you are doing.  Could you please<br/>
do it somewhere else?&quot;  It is kind of like dh can flip me off and I laugh<br/>
but if somebody else did it, I would get mad.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it really comes down to the words or the tone but the intent<br/>
behind it, trying to hurt someone vs. expressing yourself.<br/>
