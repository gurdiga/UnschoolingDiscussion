<div id="ygrps-yiv-966487337">I&#39;ve always compared unschooling to Bruce Lee&#39;s Jeet Kune Do (a style of<br/>
martial arts). Basically, Lee believed that there wasn&#39;t any one &quot;best&quot;<br/>
style or way to do things. Some people were taller than others, some were<br/>
fast, some were strong, some were left handed. Because of these variations,<br/>
what worked well for one person might not work well for another. He felt<br/>
that Jeet Kune Do was not about technique or doctrine but about the<br/>
individual. Thus, a big part of the art was to learn what worked best for<br/>
you and to do that. He borrowed freely from other styles to take what worked<br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
Lee felt that trying to define Jeet Kune Do is to miss the point. He said<br/>
&quot;If people say Jeet Kune Do is different from &#39;this&#39; or from &#39;that,&#39; then<br/>
let the name of Jeet Kune Do be wiped out, for that is what it is, just a<br/>
name.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the same is true of unschooling. When you put the focus on the<br/>
learner and work from their strengths or interests, that is unschooling.<br/>
Then it doesn&#39;t matter if the learner uses a linear, incremental approach<br/>
(like many workbooks) or has a more gestalt approach where the seem to go<br/>
from nothing to a complete understanding overnight.<br/>
<br/>
When you start trying to apply strict definitions as to what unschooling is<br/>
or isn&#39;t, then you are limiting yourself and missing the point. I&#39;ve heard<br/>
too many people say that their kid wants a workbook on a particular subject<br/>
but they won&#39;t buy it because they are unschoolers. If that&#39;s the way they<br/>
learn best, then that&#39;s the way to do it. And that&#39;s the point. Unschooling<br/>
is about learning, not about teaching. When you eliminate options without<br/>
regard for how well they work or don&#39;t work but just because they don&#39;t fit<br/>
a definition of unschooling, then you are no longer unschooling. Unschooling<br/>
is also about freedom and why you do things, not about what you do. As Nance<br/>
pointed out, you can be a stay at home mom and still be a feminist. That&#39;s<br/>
because you had the freedom to choose. In fact, there are many women who<br/>
work outside of the home who are not feminists, but feel they have no choice<br/>
because they need the income or their husbands have told them they have to<br/>
work. Again, it&#39;s not what you do but why you do it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the hard part is to discover what really works best and why a<br/>
child wants to take a particular approach. Do they want workbooks because<br/>
they have been in school and think that&#39;s the only way to learn? Do they<br/>
expect you to tell them what to do, to be the expert on every subject, and<br/>
to teach them? It may take a while for them to realize that learning is<br/>
something they have to do, not something you do to them.<br/>
<br/>
Another Bruce Lee quote that could apply to unschooling: &quot;Self-knowledge is<br/>
the basis of Jeet Kune Do because it is effective, not only for the<br/>
individual&#39;s martial art, but for his life as a human being.&quot; (Can you tell<br/>
Bruce Lee was a philosophy major in college?)<br/>

on what timetable and by what method.  The learning chosen could be<br/>
ancient Greek or auto mechanics, the timetable could be at any age and<br/>
it could be instant &quot;on-the-spot&quot; learning or choosing to take a 6-month<br/>
community college course, and the method could be totally by oneself<br/>
without any supervision, walking in the woods, sitting down at the<br/>
kitchen table for weeks with a workbook, or attending a class.  What<br/>
separates &quot;unschooling&quot; from more traditional approaches is neither the<br/>
subject matter nor the timetable nor the method, but the fact that the<br/>
child, faced with the range of options, freely (or as freely as<br/>
possible) chooses all three.  And there is never such a thing as not<br/>
choosing, for children (like the rest of us) are learning all the time.<br/>

I think that is exactly what homeschooling is, there are no definitions (even <br/>
though some like to think there are), and everything goes. If a curriculum <br/>
and a school like setting are what makes your family happy, go for it! If <br/>
sleeping all day and studying the stars all night is what you want, then go <br/>
for it! The public schools are the only ones who have rules and &#39;ways things <br/>
should be done&#39;. Not homeschoolers. Unfortunately there are homeschoolers out <br/>
there who insist that their way is the only way, but we don&#39;t have to play <br/>
with them. :o)<br/>

homeschooling methods overlap at all. I just meant that homeschoolers as a <br/>
whole can do whatever they want. The only rules are the ones they impose on <br/>
themselves (and of course, state laws). I have a good friend who is a very <br/>
strict homeschooler, she and I see nothing the same way, but we have agreed <br/>
to disagree. I DO NOT agree with her methods, but I have better things to do <br/>

educational theory. I was just trying to say out that there are people who <br/>
think differently about what homeschooling means to them and that should be <br/>
ok. <br/>

I was homeschooled the very structured way until last year. Some of it was<br/>
good for me, some of it wasn&#39;t. I consider myself a pretty methodical<br/>
person, which is why I now do &quot;lessons&quot; for myself everyday. I still<br/>
consider myself an unschooler.<br/>
The structured way was *not* good for me in math. I started hating math<br/>
around the pre-algebra stage and am only now realizing how much I *didn&#39;t*<br/>
learn by doing math lessons every day. I&#39;ve had math phobia for years,<br/>
although I&#39;m getting over it now (more on math in another post).<br/>
Structure *was* good for me in grammer and spelling (and writing). I don&#39;t<br/>
really remember ever having problems with that kind of stuff.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d have to agree with Helen on what she said there. My mom was a<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt;Sorry, typing while nursing is dangerous here!!!<br/>
 I would have to agree! Hpw old is your little one? Mine is 9 weeks.<br/>
 It does get rather interseting trying to type and nurse at the same <br/>
time...mainly<br/>
 when they start wiggling! Sorry, I just thought it was neat to find someone<br/>
 who tries to do the same thing as I do. My hubby thinks I&#39;m wierd for doing<br/>
 it. But, hey whatever works!<br/>

I am expecting #7 in November too, so she will soon be weaning and I will be <br/>
nursing a tiny one again...<br/>

 Aha!<br/>
 I just realized what part of my discomfort is/has been in some of these <br/>
 discussions.  As someone who believes that structure messes kids up, I <br/>
 support all kinds of unstructured learning, including that which happens in <br/>
 institutions, over all kinds of structured learning, even if it&#39;s done by <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah yes -- this is where I was going with my original &quot;definition&quot;.  If the <br/>
KIDS don&#39;t like using work-books, texts, etc - what is the point?<br/>
<br/>
I have a dd who begged me for &lt;gulp - Sandra, close your eyes&gt; Alpha Omega!!  <br/>
Now - First, I have a fundamental problem with supporting J. Richard Fugate, <br/>
and second - A canned Curriculum???  But, ok - we found some used &quot;life-paks&quot; <br/>
and we got a couple for under $2 each...  She did them diligently for about 2 <br/>
months... then came to me and said - &quot;you know what mom?  They leave NO scope <br/>
for imagination.&quot;  can I not do the rest of this??  Boy oh boy - big sigh of <br/>
relief from me...  She was reading Anne of Green Gables at the time too, can <br/>
you tell??  She is now taking charge of her education in her way - not <br/>
feeling pressured to do &quot;what other kids my age&quot; are doing.  She is really <br/>
enjoying it.  This week she decided she needed to know all the states and the <br/>
dates they were admitted to the union.  She is memorizing them in order - <br/>
huh.  She also has been doing WA state history and loving it.  She has <br/>
decided that she gets much more information from books out of the library, or <br/>
off the internet than she did from AO.  <br/>
<br/>
Being Forced to learn did not help me cement any important facts in my brain. <br/>
 Most of what I know today, I know because I WANTED to learn about it, so I <br/>
did.  That was my point about &quot;School at homers&quot; and Eclectics, etc  They ARE <br/>
different than unschoolers... IMHO<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135435740">&lt;&lt;But most people live with realities, not theories.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those realities are based on belief, though, and if belief can change reality <br/>
becomes easier.   CAN children learn without being methodically force-fed?  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;DUH!&quot; You all think.  But what made some of you first think that?  Practice <br/>
and theory.  Nobody methodically taught you that (unless you read the AOL <br/>
unschooling boards methodically until you had six weeks&#39; or four years&#39; worth <br/>
of &quot;OKAY!  I give up!&quot; reading of the unschooling missionaries who used to be <br/>
over there).<br/>
<br/>
In theory can a family keep their kids home and still get them &quot;socialized&quot;?<br/>
People have to accept the theory before they can prove it in practice.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have no daring theories can&#39;t leave the safety of their current <br/>
practices.<br/>
<br/>
Can people learn to write better by writing and type by typing and think by <br/>
thinking?  Look at all the online homeschooling moms who didn&#39;t consider <br/>
themselves writers before who are writing like crazy now, and REAL <br/>
writing--persuasive, life-changing writing--and a bunch of them are on this <br/>
list.   It&#39;s one thing to be published.  It&#39;s another separate thing to be <br/>
able to write something privately or semi-publicly which causes readers <br/>
elsewhere to change their actions.   THAT is what writing&#39;s good for and <br/>
that&#39;s what theory does.  It changes belief and practice.<br/>
<br/>
It changes political realities eventually, but I have no interest personally <br/>
in driving to Santa Fe and talking to legislators.   I&#39;d rather write to <br/>
homeschoolers, talk to unschoolers at the park on Thursday, answer phone <br/>
questions from people who are thinking just maybe they won&#39;t send their kids <br/>
to school next year.  That&#39;s not political reality directly, it&#39;s more about <br/>
how kids learn and what possibilities exist.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can learn without a curriculum no matter what the state law says.  <br/>
People can&#39;t pass laws that limit cognition. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
