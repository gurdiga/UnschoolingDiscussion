<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385997591">I&#39;m not sure if this is an unschooling question, but I would<br>appreciate any thoughts or experiences.<br><br>My older daughter, Abi, is 6 years old, seven in a week.&nbsp; We have just<br>started unschooling/deschooling, prior to this year she attended a<br>Montessori pre-school for 3 1/2 years.&nbsp; We discovered unschooling<br>after she&#39;d been attending for a year, and we ended up letting her<br>finish the program, partly for financial reasons, as we had a plan in<br>place which would allow me to leave work to unschool from this year.<br><br>Just lately, really only the past couple of weeks, Abi has started to<br>say that she&#39;s stupid, and hates herself.&nbsp; Sometimes this is in<br>response to something she&#39;s making going wrong, or not matching her<br>expectations somehow.&nbsp; At other times, like today, it is focused on<br>how she looks - she hates her hair, or how she looks in her clothes.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure of the best way to handle this.&nbsp; So far the response that<br>seems to help the most is to sympathise a bit, remind her how much I<br>love her, and to try and distract her.&nbsp; Today I told her I was so<br>sorry she felt bad, that everyone feels that way sometimes, that I<br>loved her enough for both of us, and that I thought she wouldn&#39;t feel<br>that way forever.&nbsp; I also tried a few little observations about<br>different beauty ideas around the world and over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She enjoyed<br>those and laughed when I told her about women being prized for tiny<br>feet in China a long time ago.<br><br>Anyway, she is feeling happy again now, but I think it might keep<br>coming up and I&#39;d love any advice.&nbsp; It is very hard to hear that your<br>child hates herself and wishes she didn&#39;t exist, which is what Abi<br>said today.&nbsp; But if she feels that way I want her to be able to tell<br>me and not hide things away to protect me.&nbsp; She is a very very<br>sensitive, empathic child and affected strongly by atmosphere in the<br>house.<br><br>Some other factors that might be involved are that she has a nasty<br>cough right now, and we are getting ready to move, although only in<br>theory so far, no packing yet.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to underreact or overreact.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had flashes of<br>thinking maybe she&#39;d be better off at school as she would be busier<br>and more distracted all day with less chance to dwell.<br><br>I&#39;ll finish there.&nbsp; Thank you for any thoughts.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451243151"><div dir="ltr"><div class="ygrps-yiv-451243151gmail_extra"><div class="ygrps-yiv-451243151gmail_quote">I think the way you&#39;ve responded sounds very nice and realistic. <br><br>I really like the combination of accepting that she really feels that way, but at the same time showing confidence that it will pass.<br>

<br>I have a couple of thoughts on the following:<br><br class="ygrps-yiv-451243151">&lt;&lt;I have had flashes of<br>thinking maybe she&#39;d be better off at school as she would be busier<br>and more distracted all day with less chance to dwell.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div>&gt;&gt;<br><br> </div></span></blockquote>First - Montessori schools are pretty distracting because the kids are usually busy all the time, but other schools would involve lots of waiting around time and are very boring - the opposite of distracting.<br>

<br>Second - what she&#39;s learning about how to move herself out of a funk is REALLY important - do you really want to deny her this opportunity to learn it by putting her somewhere where she&#39;ll be so busy she won&#39;t experience it?<br>

<br>If I was making a list of life skills - learning to get oneself out of a bad mood, learning to change focus from self-pity or negativity toward oneself, and learning to handle negative feelings would be at the top of the list. The ability to handle what life throws at you - and handle it in such a way that you move through it and continue to live a good life filled with joy and gratitude - THAT is the most important thing there is to learn.<br>

<br>So - she&#39;s got some negative stuff going on and, with your help, she&#39;s trying out different ways of getting through it. You&#39;re offering her a variety of examples - distraction, talking about it, doing something about it, finding humor in it, recognizing that the feelings will pass, and more. Those are the very tools she&#39;ll reach for later when she has trouble with friends, or a medical problem, or a boyfriend dumps her, or she experience loss of a loved one....from the smallest bit of discomfort right up to the biggest tragedies! <br>

<br>Sounds to me like you&#39;re doing great. Don&#39;t wish for her to never experience any negative feelings in her childhood at all - wish for her to learn from it and move on smoothly.<br><br></div>-pam</div></div>

<div>
<div>-=- &lt;&lt;I have had flashes of thinking maybe she&#39;d be better off at 
school as she would be busier and more distracted all day with less chance to 
dwell.&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In our experience, school will do the opposite of raising her self 
esteem.&nbsp; My daughter (11 1/2)&nbsp;went to public school through 3rd grade 
and it degraded her confidence greatly.&nbsp; There is a lot of judgment from 
teachers and peers as well as a great deal of pressure to conform.&nbsp; I have 
often said that watching her go through school was like watching a beautiful hot 
air balloon floating through the air and&nbsp;seeing small tears start to form 
in the fabric.&nbsp; The longer she was there the bigger those holes became 
and&nbsp;her little basket&nbsp;started slowly but surely sinking to the 
ground.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Fortunately I discovered Unschooling which gave me the confidence 
to&nbsp;offer her the opportunity to quit school&nbsp;(prior to that I was very 
concerned about how well we&#39;d do with school at home.&nbsp; At least home had 
been a retreat for her &amp; I didn&#39;t want to turn that retreat into a mini 
version of school.).&nbsp; Being at home in a supportive environment where she 
has control over social and other aspects of her life has been very healing for 
her.&nbsp; She used to say a lot of self deprecating things but over the past 
year and a half she has remade her image in her own&nbsp;mind.&nbsp; 
She&nbsp;loves her new&nbsp;identity as a &quot;computer geek&quot; and gamer girl.&nbsp; 
She sports bright pink hair and that is also a great source of pride for 
her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>About a month ago we went to the mall.&nbsp; There is a clothing store 
there that &quot;the cool girls&quot; shop at and she usually likes to hit that store 
first.&nbsp; We drove an hour and a half over windy mountain roads to get there 
and when we went into the store there was&nbsp;a gal cleaning nail polish off of 
the floor with a chemical that was pretty smelly.&nbsp; We shopped around &amp; 
picked out a couple of things but Jade seemed really down and was not into 
it.&nbsp; While we were checking out I looked over at her and she was 
as&nbsp;white as a ghost, looking like she was about to pass out.&nbsp; She sat 
on the floor to wait for me and suddenly her face flushed bright red.&nbsp; She 
felt horrible, was confused and discombobulated and wanted to go home.&nbsp; I 
suggested we sit in the food&nbsp;court&nbsp;for awhile and see if it would 
pass.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While we sat I talked to her about other stores she might want to go into 
and things she might want to buy.&nbsp; She said she was not up for it.&nbsp; 
Then I asked her about a minecraft video she had been talking about 
earlier.&nbsp; The change that came over her was priceless to witness.&nbsp; She 
suddenly seemed to&nbsp;remember &quot;oh yeah... I&#39;m Sweetiepie1011!&nbsp; I have 
pink hair and a fabulous new life and identity.&quot;&nbsp; Within a couple of 
minutes her coloring returned to normal and she was ready to roll.&nbsp; I 
believe that part of her feeling yucky was due to the car ride and the yucky 
smell but mostly it was because she got sucked into that vortex of negative 
emotions that school had created in her.&nbsp; Remembering that she had evolved 
into someone else and didn&#39;t care about those girls from school anymore pulled 
her right back out of it.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It has been a wonderful thing to see her balloon starting to soar 
again.&nbsp; It took some time, love and support but now she thinks she is 
awesome.&nbsp; She still has some insecurities, to be sure, but fortunately we 
have time for her to work through those, as well.&nbsp; So I think you guys are 
on the right track.&nbsp; Love her up and give her time to heal.&nbsp; It&#39;s hard 
to know what effect schooling has had on&nbsp;your daughter&#39;s&nbsp;psyche but 
for sure unschooling will help!!</div>

reply though because your daughter sounds exactly like our eldest daughter who 
is 8 (9 in April). She’s also acutely sensitive, self-deprecating, 
perfectionistic, smart and all that you have described. She often talks about 
how she hates her red hair (its gorgeous), how skinny she is (genetic, my 
husband is very lean) and how she “hates her life” which she said just last 
night. Its heartbreaking for me to hear (just the night before last I spent most 
of it until the wee early hours crying (I literally woke up at 3 am in fits of 
tears) partly from her apparent discontent with everything, everyone and the 
world in general and partly because I am overwhelmed by her staying up until 1 
am watching barbie movies and wondering where my little girl has gone (this is a 
different subject though). </font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">SO, last night during one of these sessions I just remained 
very quiet, I listened, I stayed still and allowed her to express. In the end it 
became apparent that she feels its grossly unfair that I allow the younger ones 
on my phone to do games she gets to do on her ipod. So I offered her to use my 
phone for a while before it was time to go to bed (bedtimes here are completely 
chaotic along with everything else in our life since we started to let go of 
control a couple of months ago). She did happily, then I walked her to bed and 
read to her (a lovely activity which we she’s always enjoyed until barbie movies 
and her ipod came to live here at christmas time), and she then wanted to read 
more herself, seemed a lot more content, said she loved me (she does say that a 
lot more these days in between the negativity) and went to sleep happily. 
</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">So the long and short of sharing this episode from last night 
is that I have also not known how to respond to her saying things like “I am 
dumb, stupid, ugly etc etc” except to just be with her, listen, and be still. It 
does not work to rebuke or deny or argue back. I just try to listen to what’s 
behind the words and then move her into a different more peaceful zone. One on 
one time is at a premium (I have four kids and I find this very difficult to 
make happen) so often she just needs me to be with her 
undistracted.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">I have also thought many many times she would be better off at 
school where there’s more kids, more stimulation. But its not the answer. She 
would still be herself with the same stuff, whether she’s at school or not. And 
doing so could well compound the issues as your husband has pointed out. I have 
had to work through this knee jerk reaction and understand that school isn’t the 
answer to her extremely challenging attitudes and behaviour.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">I had a lot of similar thoughts growing up (I am still highly 
self-critical) and all I needed (and still need) was for someone to be with me 
through the process without judgement or dismissal. </font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Though lately I am thinking someone needs to be EMPOWERING in 
this process as well. I am still working out how or what “being empowering” 
looks like. I wonder if anyone else could share some jewels on 
this?</font></div>

<p>Thank you Pam, you&#39;re right of course.&nbsp; My husband certainly thinks 
she&#39;d be having either the same or worse issues if she was at school.&nbsp; It 
seems to be where my mind first goes though, when things aren&#39;t wonderful 100% 
of the time - that maybe she&#39;d be better off at school.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don&#39;t really think that though, and I think it&#39;s part of my 
deschooling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes I think learning and experimenting with moving on and redirecting 
negative thoughts is very valuable.&nbsp; I feel reassured by your post, and 
would welcome any more thoughts, or different ways I could support 
her.</div></div></div></div></div></html></div>

(and follow other links to choices)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not enough to decide &quot;once and for all&quot; that she will be home and not at school.<br/>
It&#39;s not good to say &quot;I have had to work through this reaction and understand...&quot; when maybe you&#39;re wrong, and you&#39;re clearly still considering it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As an example, I did decide (years ago) to marry Keith Dodd.  Then we planned the wedding and I swore in front of friends and relatives to stay with him until one of us died.  Once and for all.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t keep me here, all by itself, though.  I decide all the time to make our lives good and to stay.  Some days are not perfect, and some nearly are, but it&#39;s though lots of decisions throughout the day that it stays good.<br/>
<br/>
Same with parenting peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
Same with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Same with anything.<br/>
<br/>
When you speak, or act, or think, consider two options and make the better choice.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t stay stuck with the same two choices, or think that deciding once will last a lifetime, or a year, or even a week.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616091825">-=- Its heartbreaking for me to hear (just the night before last I spent most of it until the wee early hours crying (I literally woke up at 3 am in fits of tears) partly from her apparent discontent with everything, everyone and the world in general and partly because I am overwhelmed by her staying up until 1 am watching barbie movies and wondering where my little girl has gone (this is a different subject though).-=-<br/>
<br/>
You have three other children. <br/>
Were there other stresses?<br/>
Were you hungry, angry, lonely or tired?  Sick?  <br/>
<br/>
To blame your child (and Barbie) for your inability to calm yourself is a lot of negativity pointed at ONE member of your family.<br/>

Maybe you could listen to a comforting audio book with earbuds and fall asleep listening.  You could still hear if one of the kids needed you.  Listening to a soothing voice and breathing slowly might help you.<br/>

power to say &quot;No, I do not like this store, the way I feel when I&#39;m 
there&nbsp;or the things in it.&nbsp; I want it to put it in my past&quot;.&nbsp; 
That&nbsp;was why I excepted her statement &amp; her decision&nbsp;instead of 
saying something that she might take as me trying to change her mind&nbsp;or 
questioning her decision.&nbsp; As Sandra suggested, I could have&nbsp;pointed 
out to her&nbsp;that she might feel differently later.&nbsp; She does know from 
past conversations &amp; experiences&nbsp;that she has the&nbsp;choice to change 
her mind anytime.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; She is a person who knows her own mind and what

It has been very interesting to observe how much of a dramatic impact her

calm and supportive but observed the changes in her.&nbsp; I did focus on 
positives and that is what pulled her out of it.&nbsp; That particular store has 
always had a lot of negative associations for her so I supported her choice to 
not want to go there anymore.&nbsp; She has realized over the past few trips 
there that she doesn&#39;t actually&nbsp;like&nbsp;their&nbsp;clothes &amp; that she 
only valued it because of things other&nbsp;girls had said to her in 
the&nbsp;past. &nbsp;We&nbsp;also went&nbsp;into a couple of new stores we&#39;d 
never explored before &amp; she&nbsp;expressed joy&nbsp;to be changing her focus 
toward things she is interested in now instead of focusing on negative emotions

I would add to this what I did with my son for who went through a very difficult transformation which took years of daily listening and now states happily that he&#39;s happy...listen and use the therapist&#39;s method of repeating back for validation and help with getting to the root of feelings. I am stupid...help the child identlfy the feeling by echoing..you&#39;re telling me you feel stupid...then just let him/her talk...don&#39;y say much.</span></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-336720572yahoo_quoted" style="display:block;"> <br> <br> <div style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"> <div style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"> <div dir="ltr"> <font size="2" face="Arial"> On Friday, February 14, 2014 4:57

know if there was more to the conversation than you wrote here, but it seems 
like you might be reading more into this than is necessary. I mean, you know 
your daughter best, and it&#39;s good to be aware of things that might trigger 
negative thoughts for her, but I wonder if SHE was equating the store with 
school. -=-</span></font></span></div>
<div><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px;"></span></font></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px;">Maybe 
it was a bad example to use because there are so many nuances to the situation 
&amp; it would take a lot of everyone&#39;s time to elaborate on all of the 
details.&nbsp; I think I may not have given enough detail or should not 
have&nbsp;tried to use this example.&nbsp; </span></font></span></div>
<div><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px;"></span></font></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px;">It is 
definitely a store that SHE equates with school, and one&nbsp;former friend 
especially.&nbsp; She seemed to&nbsp;feel empowered knowing that she had the 
power to say &quot;No, I do not like this store, the way I feel when I&#39;m 
there&nbsp;or the things in it.&nbsp; I want it to put it in my past&quot;.&nbsp; 
That&nbsp;was why I excepted her statement &amp; her decision&nbsp;instead of 
saying something that she might take as me trying to change her mind&nbsp;or 
questioning her decision.&nbsp; As Sandra suggested, I could have&nbsp;pointed 
out to her&nbsp;that she might feel differently later.&nbsp; She does know from 
past conversations &amp; experiences&nbsp;that she has the&nbsp;choice to change 
her mind anytime.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; She is a person who knows her own mind and what 
she wants/doesn’t&nbsp;want so I let it go,&nbsp;feeling that we both already 
knew&nbsp;she might change her mind later&nbsp;but that it would be her 
decision.&nbsp; </span></font></span></div>
<div><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px;"></span></font></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px;">This is 
also a child who has CLEARLY suffered many asthma attacks due to anxiety.&nbsp; 
It has been very interesting to observe how much of a dramatic impact her 
emotions have on her physical, observable health.&nbsp; That was the part I was 
trying to use as an example.&nbsp; It has been incredibly helpful for me to 
understand how deeply she feels things and how much it effects her on a physical 
as well as emotional level.</span></font></span></div>
<div><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px;"></span></font></span>&nbsp;</div>

<font color="#000000">Mostly though, don&#39;t get pulled into thinking negative 
thoughts about her associations. YOU focus on all the positives (you can do that 
without minimizing or dismissing her feelings), and pull her along for the 
joyride, so that her favorite destinations don&#39;t get turned into smelly 
dumps.-=-</font></span></font></span></div>
<div><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#000000" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px;"></span></font></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#000000" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE:13px;">I was 
calm and supportive but observed the changes in her.&nbsp; I did focus on 
positives and that is what pulled her out of it.&nbsp; That particular store has 
always had a lot of negative associations for her so I supported her choice to 
not want to go there anymore.&nbsp; She has realized over the past few trips 
there that she doesn&#39;t actually&nbsp;like&nbsp;their&nbsp;clothes &amp; that she 
only valued it because of things other&nbsp;girls had said to her in 
the&nbsp;past. &nbsp;We&nbsp;also went&nbsp;into a couple of new stores we&#39;d 
never explored before &amp; she&nbsp;expressed joy&nbsp;to be changing her focus 
toward things she is interested in now instead of focusing on negative emotions 
of the past.&nbsp; That was the part that was cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she 
will&nbsp;decide to go there again in the future but her reasons for going will 
have changed.&nbsp; Sorry for not being more clear.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-630047715">-=- &lt;during one of these sessions I just remained very quiet, I listened, I stayed still and allowed her to express&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is best...everyone just wants to be heard and not told how to feel.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That seems a bit too definite and singular.<br/>
If everyone just wants to be heard, I&#39;m not interested in keeping this discussion going, that&#39;s for sure.  To make observations on what people write is not telling them how to feel.  Sometimes it&#39;s showing them where they might be &quot;getting cold&quot; in terms of unsschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
With parents and children, sometimes the advice parents give is to keep children from &quot;getting cold&quot; in terms of social abilities or opportunities, or in keeping their world open and available, and helping them to see clearly when they&#39;re muddled.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids talk to me about how they&#39;re feeling, sometimes they want ideas.  Sometimes they don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t always guess right, but if I assumed every situation was the same and every person was the same, that wouldn&#39;t be using my judgment at all.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- I would add to this what I did with my son for who went through a very difficult transformation which took years of daily listening and now states happily that he&#39;s happy...listen and use the therapist&#39;s method of repeating back for validation and help with getting to the root of feelings. I am stupid...help the child identlfy the feeling by echoing..you&#39;re telling me you feel stupid...then just let him/her talk...don&#39;y say much.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If a therapist uses &quot;active listening&quot; (which is like a script, and can be infuriating), that&#39;s because he&#39;s charging by the hour and needs has a method of treatment.<br/>
<br/>
If my husband did that to me, I would be unamused.  It would not be loving or conversational.<br/>
<br/>
If I did that to my children, it would not be loving or conversational.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In general, kids assume their feelings *are* valid. Why wouldn&#39;t they? Unless a parent undermines the child&#39;s confidence. Or a parent is paying more attention to what they expect the child to feel -- like excitement over doing something -- than they are to the child.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be unusual for a child to *occasionally* be confused why they don&#39;t feel the same as everyone else. But generally it would be very disconnecting to find their feelings were causing *Mom* to need to validate them.<br/>

<div>-=- &lt;&lt;I have had flashes of thinking maybe she&#39;d be better off at
school as she would be busier and more distracted all day with less chance to
dwell.&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In our experience, school will do the opposite of raising her self
esteem.&nbsp; My daughter (11 1/2)&nbsp;went to public school through 3rd grade
and it degraded her confidence greatly.&nbsp; There is a lot of judgment from
teachers and peers as well as a great deal of pressure to conform.&nbsp; I have
often said that watching her go through school was like watching a beautiful hot
air balloon floating through the air and&nbsp;seeing small tears start to form
in the fabric.&nbsp; The longer she was there the bigger those holes became
and&nbsp;her little basket&nbsp;started slowly but surely sinking to the
ground.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Fortunately I discovered Unschooling which gave me the confidence
to&nbsp;offer her the opportunity to quit school&nbsp;(prior to that I was very
concerned about how well we&#39;d do with school at home.&nbsp; At least home had
been a retreat for her &amp; I didn&#39;t want to turn that retreat into a mini
version of school.).&nbsp; Being at home in a supportive environment where she
has control over social and other aspects of her life has been very healing for
her.&nbsp; She used to say a lot of self deprecating things but over the past
year and a half she has remade her image in her own&nbsp;mind.&nbsp;
She&nbsp;loves her new&nbsp;identity as a &quot;computer geek&quot; and gamer girl.&nbsp;
She sports bright pink hair and that is also a great source of pride for
her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>About a month ago we went to the mall.&nbsp; There is a clothing store
there that &quot;the cool girls&quot; shop at and she usually likes to hit that store
first.&nbsp; We drove an hour and a half over windy mountain roads to get there
and when we went into the store there was&nbsp;a gal cleaning nail polish off of
the floor with a chemical that was pretty smelly.&nbsp; We shopped around &amp;
picked out a couple of things but Jade seemed really down and was not into
it.&nbsp; While we were checking out I looked over at her and she was
as&nbsp;white as a ghost, looking like she was about to pass out.&nbsp; She sat
on the floor to wait for me and suddenly her face flushed bright red.&nbsp; She
felt horrible, was confused and discombobulated and wanted to go home.&nbsp; I
suggested we sit in the food&nbsp;court&nbsp;for awhile and see if it would
pass.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While we sat I talked to her about other stores she might want to go into
and things she might want to buy.&nbsp; She said she was not up for it.&nbsp;
Then I asked her about a minecraft video she had been talking about
earlier.&nbsp; The change that came over her was priceless to witness.&nbsp; She
suddenly seemed to&nbsp;remember &quot;oh yeah... I&#39;m Sweetiepie1011!&nbsp; I have
pink hair and a fabulous new life and identity.&quot;&nbsp; Within a couple of
minutes her coloring returned to normal and she was ready to roll.&nbsp; I
believe that part of her feeling yucky was due to the car ride and the yucky
smell but mostly it was because she got sucked into that vortex of negative
emotions that school had created in her.&nbsp; Remembering that she had evolved
into someone else and didn&#39;t care about those girls from school anymore pulled
her right back out of it.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It has been a wonderful thing to see her balloon starting to soar
again.&nbsp; It took some time, love and support but now she thinks she is
awesome.&nbsp; She still has some insecurities, to be sure, but fortunately we
have time for her to work through those, as well.&nbsp; So I think you guys are
on the right track.&nbsp; Love her up and give her time to heal.&nbsp; It&#39;s hard
to know what effect schooling has had on&nbsp;your daughter&#39;s&nbsp;psyche but
for sure unschooling will help!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461083334">Dear all,<br/>
<br/>
I need help to understand what a downsizing in order to live as a one  <br/>
income family can mean. Witch are your experiences? Whish where the  <br/>
major differences when your started living on one income?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes o feel we can&#39;t find more ways to cut the expenses but then,  <br/>
with a bit of imagination and shared experiences we find our way.<br/>
<br/>
Since our son was born, 4,5 years ago, I?ve manage to work almost 6  <br/>
months per year, in a part time at the university or research  <br/>
institute in social sciences. I manage to do almost all the work from  <br/>
home, at night and when I don?t I pay a baby sitter who receives as  <br/>
much per hour as I do. I don?t know of any young homeschoolers who can  <br/>
come to help at home and we don?t have any relatives in the city where  <br/>
we live. Sometimes I travel to my parent?s city and our son stays with  <br/>
grandma while I work but it is really a stressful situation and the  <br/>
trip costs around 200 euros. It is not a sustainable working situation  <br/>
and to stop with it seems the most reasonable thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
With the economic crisis, it is getting more and more difficult to  <br/>
find work, even at my level of specialization that is well paid.  I  <br/>
could easily find a  job if i was able to work 80 hours per week,  <br/>
receiving 1000 euros per month, as my colleagues are doing but, that  <br/>
this is absolutely impossible if i also value my family and want to  <br/>
unschool. I?m choosing, again, not to work and I need ideas on how to  <br/>
save more money, how and where to downsize.<br/>
<br/>
What we are already doing:<br/>
<br/>
We have a good deal on telephones, internet and television signature.  <br/>
It is not a possibility to cut down the net and tv because it is the  <br/>
same one that goes to the flat we own and rent next door and the  <br/>
rental contract includes it. To sell that flat will be a good idea but  <br/>
with the crisis we can?t get the money of the mortgage.<br/>
<br/>
We cook at home, a part of our food comes from the mother in law  <br/>
vegetable garden, she stores it for us and we pick it up every month,  <br/>
250 km away.  I try to buy products we 50% discount at the organic  <br/>
shop (still eating almost 60% organic but maybe need to revise that  <br/>
too).<br/>
<br/>
All our clothes are second hand or gifts. Same for almost all the toys.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
we dont travel for holidays unless we go to our poarents houses,  <br/>
friends houses or free camping and that is perfec as it is.<br/>
<br/>
We live in a 160ft flat, in the city Centre, 3th floor, one room, and  <br/>
no garage or storage room. I&#39;ve been angry for a long time with the  <br/>
house, i wanted a bigger, better house, less noisy, less cold in the  <br/>
winter and hot in the summer. I&#39;m lucky that I?m in peace with our  <br/>
living space now, and we are improving it to be cozier, funny, and  <br/>
comfortable. To move is not a good idea, even if we rent this house,  <br/>
because it is close to my husband job and because it is really  <br/>
inexpensive. Any ideas on small flats with children will also be  <br/>
welcome, especially on how to fit a second child in a one room space.<br/>
<br/>
Talking about the second child, we have a second child and i dont  <br/>
work, we will not have money to pay for help. This means staying at  <br/>
home, 10 hours per day, monday to friday, with a 5 years old and a  <br/>
newborn. I feel like i need to choose between unschooling one child or  <br/>
have a second one and put the older at school. I&#39;m shure there are  <br/>
other ways to see this. I always think that to have an au pair helper  <br/>
could be a good ideia but we dont have a free room...maybe that is a  <br/>
good motive to moove to a bigger house, even if it is more expensive?<br/>
<br/>
I?m doing a doula training and will do a Ayurveda massage professional  <br/>
training to try to work in another area. I already have clients enough  <br/>
to pay the investment. By your experience, is it easy to match  <br/>
unschooling family life and doula work? I was very sad to ear the  <br/>
Portuguese doulas saying that conciliation between their work and  <br/>
family file is very difficult and 95% of then got divorced after  <br/>
starting working. I cannot believe that this is true all over the  <br/>
world. I cant even see why this happens in Portugal but, maybe, I?m  <br/>
not seeing il all?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your insights<br/>
<br/>

<div>
<div>=-- I?m doing a doula training and will do a Ayurveda massage professional 
<br>training to try to work in another area.-=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would think that a doula would have unpredictable hours which would be 
challenging with children.&nbsp; Prior to having kids I decided to go into real 
estate because I thought it would have flexible hours that would make it 
convenient to have kids and still work.&nbsp; The reality was that I had very 
little control over the hours when I worked and trying to balance the needs of 
my clients and my kids was quite stressful.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Massage professional might allow you to have more control over your 
hours.&nbsp; Would you travel &amp; provide the service in the customer&#39;s 
home?&nbsp; You would still have to provide care for your child as most clients 
would probably frown on having your child present during their relaxing 
massage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>How about if you offered child care services in your home or at the other 
person&#39;s home?&nbsp; It may be a bonus to other parents that your child would be 
there, if you present it correctly.&nbsp; It shows that you are responsible and 
experienced in child care.&nbsp; My daughter has a friend (10) with a brother 
(now 2) &amp; her mother does quite&nbsp;a bit of babysitting, starting when the 
son was a small baby.&nbsp; She advertises on Craigslist, if you have&nbsp;a 
similar online source of advertising in Portugal,&nbsp;and by word of 
mouth.&nbsp; As you mentioned, child care professionals do get paid well, it 
doesn&#39;t require any special training or investment and you could include your 
child &amp; any future children.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My cousin started doing daycare from home when her daughter was 3 as a way 
to stop paying for child care, spend more time with her daughter and bring in 
extra income.&nbsp; Over the years her daycare has evolved into a preschool and 
now she is looking for commercial space to rent.&nbsp; She is a wonderful mother 
and provides excellent care to the children entrusted to her.&nbsp; She has a 
waiting list of people wanting to get in.&nbsp; It has been a good source of 
steady income for her family.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372002729"><div dir="ltr"><div>I will offer an idea to consider regarding being a doula and family life as I have been supporting women as a doula for the last few years. It does call for some creative arrangements if you dont have family/partner to rely on. The work is very unpredictable in the sense that when you get the call you don&#39;t know if you will be away from home for 3 hours or 3 days (yes it can happen this way). I am very fortunate in that I live in an area where there is a very supportive community of doulas and many of us work in collectives or partnerships where we may share the client load, provide relief after a certain number of hours or help with child care sharing. If you are able to make connections with other doulas through facebook groups (or start one), you can search doulas in your area and reach out. Birth work is amazing and very emotional. Covering childcare while you are at a birth is one aspect, another thing is the recovery time that you often need in the form of sleep, debriefing or whatever you need to do to process your experiences. Having a community of support is crucial as is having a supportive partner.<br>
