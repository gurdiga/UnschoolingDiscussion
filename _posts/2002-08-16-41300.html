 </span></blockquote>Kimber, you have seen the light.......<br/>
The light that was meant for YOU to see.........<br/>
I am getting to the point to doing the &quot;Talk to the hand&quot; thing.......<br/>
If you want me to be okay with your belief, give me the same respect and be <br/>
okay with mine. If you cannot do that......then....<br/>
The Great Spirit calls us differently.......If you need to belong to a <br/>
religion or group than that is what you need, that is your light or calling. <br/>
I have been doing alot of thinking over the past few days.....Accepting who I <br/>
am more and more. Well, I should say who I am about to become or the person <br/>
that I have always been but was afraid to let out. I don&#39;t want to be <br/>
controlled my religion or doctrine. I want to be limitless. I want to walk <br/>
again with my native ancestors in my dreams. I often see myself setting among <br/>
and soaring throught the clouds.<br/>
There was a war here and I sometimes feel the hurt, pain, and anger of my <br/>
native people since moving to this place. I hope someday to have a vision <br/>
quest.<br/>
I still think of the dream about me being in a car and an eagle landed on my <br/>
left shoulder. He snuggled against my neck and I felt the warmth of his body. <br/>
I actually felt the warmth in my dream. He kept nuzzling his beak in my hair <br/>
until I said okay, okay... I get the message. He then went along his journey.<br/>
