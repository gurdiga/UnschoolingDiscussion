&gt; the puppy conversation. Has anyone suggested the best way to find them GOOD<br/>
&gt; homes and I&#39;ve maybe missed it? We have a stray and her 9 pups that will be<br/>
&gt; ready for homes next week, and I&#39;m undecided about whether to just take them<br/>
&gt; to the flea market and give them to whoever will take them or to take them<br/>
&gt; to the rescue shelter. We&#39;ve also got a stray cat that just had 3 kittens<br/>
&gt; two weeks ago under the house, so we&#39;ll have to do something with them too<br/>
&gt; in about a month. I don&#39;t have the money to run an ad or to keep any of them<br/>
&gt; much as I&#39;d love to. Three dogs, four cats, and a horse is our limit, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; afraid. These have got to go. <br/>

reasonable distance to Salem, MA? (Yeah, right)<br/>
