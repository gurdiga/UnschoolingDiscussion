&lt;&lt; do you guys give your kids any regular work within your families? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Regular meaning ordinary, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Regular meaning scheduled, no.<br/>
<br/>
There are expectations of a level of cooperation, sort of the same as I <br/>
expect them to do as guests in other houses--pick up their own dishes, not <br/>
leave stuff where others need to walk, if they&#39;re going to the garage for a <br/>
soda ask if anyone else wants one.  Put dirty laundry where it goes, hang wet <br/>
towels up, wipe off the sink.  Courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I asked Marty to come and help me sort some laundry and put his <br/>
own stuff away.  We had an interesting discussion about whether it would be <br/>
advantageous for him to do his own laundry and that he did know how.  I said <br/>
&quot;his own laundry&quot; would need to include towels, dish towels, other public <br/>
stuff.  And efficiency works better by sorting similar things than doing lots <br/>
of little loads.  I told him I&#39;d rather have the general help.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they take trash or recycling out without being asked, but they <br/>
never whine if they are asked.<br/>
<br/>
The deal on their rooms is they can leave it pretty ratty as long as they&#39;re <br/>
willing to straighten it if I ask them to (when they&#39;re going to have <br/>
company, or when we&#39;ve reached a point of frustration because something can&#39;t <br/>
be found or not enough of their clothes are making it into the laundry, or <br/>
because I&#39;m grumpy and just want to have more order where I&#39;m walking).<br/>

Sandra had good ideas, and that&#39;s about how it works here.  I tend to<br/>
regularly ask my son to do certain things, and if he notices that they need<br/>
doing, he may do it himself.  He also does a lot of the odd little things<br/>
that come up, mainly because those aren&#39;t particularly hard, and he often is<br/>
the one who has a few spare minutes to do something between other<br/>
activities.  It&#39;s always been expected he&#39;d help out around the house, and<br/>
has never been a problem, really.  The occasional whine, perhaps, but<br/>
nothing big. I don&#39;t tie housework to allowance, partly because I don&#39;t<br/>
think my son is old enough to remember failing to do something on Monday and<br/>
being penalized for it on Saturday night, and partly because it&#39;s just too<br/>
much trouble to keep track.<br/>
<br/>
But mine is an only, so there&#39;s no one to bicker with about the work, and<br/>
he&#39;s just 6, so he still LIKES helping!  Maybe it&#39;s different with more or<br/>
older children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just ask people to do things. &quot;Rox - would you unload the dishwasher.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Rosie - will you help clear off the table?&quot; etc. They usually do it - but <br/>
not always right away. Sometimes they say, &quot;Mom - can I do something else <br/>
later, I&#39;m busy right now?&quot; I say yes to that, usually. I don&#39;t nag - I might <br/>
remind them though, if I think they&#39;ve forgotten I even asked - but if they <br/>
don&#39;t do it within a reasonable time period, I just do it. Sometimes, to be <br/>
totally honest, I&#39;m just snotty enough to point out to them that I am doing <br/>
it, though &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes that results in somebody ELSE doing it. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It happened just the other night - and what&#39;s MORE!!!! - the kids even <br/>
divided it up and worked together cooperatively &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

that you wouldn&#39;t ask it if you didn&#39;t need/want it done NOW.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 boys do not not not get that.  Even if I explain it, they&#39;re not <br/>
invested in my logical order of things, most of the time.  <br/>
<br/>
If one of mine said that it would be such a shock to me, but it would be <br/>
such an improvement!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think part that might not be coming through in these stories is the<br/>
attitude behind the requests. It&#39;s more like asking a spouse to do<br/>
something. It&#39;s a real request -- not a command phrased as a request -- and<br/>
the kid *can* say no. It&#39;s a &quot;Can you help out?&quot; rather than &quot;That&#39;s your<br/>
job so do it&quot; type of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Age is also a big factor. Up until last year (when she was 10) most requests<br/>
were greeted with loud groans. Now Kathryn helps bring in and put away the<br/>
groceries. It&#39;s *not* because I&#39;ve finally gotten her trained properly. ;-)<br/>
It&#39;s just because she&#39;s older and sees things differently than she did<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
(Thank yous for any help they give also go a lot further than grousing about<br/>
how little they did! ;-)<br/>
