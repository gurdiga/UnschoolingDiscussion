<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196083185">&quot;Ren visited me in the hospital last fall and I was really impressed by how <br/>
patient and gentle she was when her child wanted her camera.   She has more kids<br/>
 <br/>
than I had when I had toddlers, and she&#39;s more patient than I was.  If I had <br/>
more babies, I would want to be more like Ren.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ANd if Sandra had seen me many days (like yesterday) she&#39;d say, &quot;chill out!!&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
I think many of the accusations are unfair, and I couldn&#39;t help but chime in. I hope that&#39;s alright...I just can&#39;t let it go.<br/>
Sandra has complimented me, praised my writing and given me the courage to try and get published. She&#39;s taken many things I&#39;ve written and saved them, as she has many others at this site, always complimenting them on what they said and saving it for her website. <br/>
<br/>
She isn&#39;t some arrogant person that isn&#39;t learning all the time. It&#39;s just that she lacks nothing in the confidence-over-unschooling department, and some people are a touch sensitive when a very confident female tells it like it is!<br/>
<br/>
In reading &quot;Wishcraft&quot; Sher talks about being surrounded by winners. People that confidently pursue their goals and are honestly pleased when you achieve something great.<br/>
Sandra is a winner. Some people can&#39;t be around winners, it&#39;s too difficult because they see their own lack. I know this to be true in my experience because I myself had to deal with it!!<br/>
The more we are willing to admit our own lack, our own difficulty in shedding ingrained thought patterns, the easier it is to be around a winner that spotlights our weaknesses.<br/>
It&#39;s a growing experience. Not easy, but incredibly life changing.<br/>
I&#39;ll say it again...<br/>
Sandra is a winner.<br/>
