<br/>
 About school, someone wrote that that many people seem to think as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;the gov&#39;t needs to make sure that it&#39;s &quot;done&quot; to all children.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That, in a nutshell, is the view that&#39;s called, &quot;The Public Good.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s the idea behind mountains of bad laws that take money from everyone and<br/>
give it to special interests. (public school is the biggest special interest<br/>
group in the country) It&#39;s the excuse that schoolers use when they intrude<br/>
into the practices of homeschoolers. It means that the state doesn&#39;t trust<br/>
us to do it, even though it fails miserably, as we all agree.<br/>
<br/>
The opposing view is that no one has a right to the property of anyone else.<br/>
(slavery means that you don&#39;t have a right to property,<br/>
even to your own children)<br/>
Either our property and our earnings belong to us or they don&#39;t.<br/>
What gives anyone else a right to it?<br/>
Are our children OURS, or do they belong to others, to use for the purposes<br/>
of others? Is it our decision or someone else&#39;s?<br/>
Is it a public &quot;good&quot; for the state to teach MY children things that I don&#39;t<br/>
want them to be taught, at my expense?<br/>
( those are questions that libertarians ask )<br/>

( Tia, do you include unschooling in &quot;some sort of eduction&quot;? This list<br/>
seems to say that unschooling is better than what the state offers. Why<br/>
shouldn&#39;t the state provide UNschooling? )<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s those taxes that say, &quot;your property is not yours. It&#39;s ours, and we&#39;ll<br/>
use it as we decide, not you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The state can&#39;t give (provide) anything to anyone until it has first taken<br/>
from everyone else. The libertarian &quot;philosophy&quot; is one of personal<br/>
responsibility and individual choice in all matters, including how to raise<br/>
and educate our children.<br/>
Therefore, briefly, no government, like no person, has a right to take by<br/>
force what belongs to another -- no matter what. If there is a true need,<br/>
most people will contribute and help, but no one should be forced to give to<br/>
another at the point of a gun, as the government does.<br/>
<br/>
The state is not a good educator. It doesn&#39;t belong in the education<br/>
business. It spends about $1B per day of our money for its bad schools,<br/>
preventing the earners of that money from using it for good education for<br/>
their own children.<br/>
<br/>
It is a myth that&#39;s useful to the schoolers that &quot;all those kids&quot; would not<br/>
be provided for at all if the government didn&#39;t give them &quot;some sort of an<br/>
education.&quot; One problem is that they are being denied education NOW, and<br/>
would get better education if they were given a choice. That&#39;s what vouchers<br/>
are proving. Those who believe that parents would not educate their kids or<br/>
find decent schools for them, are believing a state schoolers&#39; (usually<br/>
racist) lie. Sure, there are exceptions, and the schools use them to throw<br/>
their net over all of us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had an experience today that you would probably find interesting.  <br/>
I took my kids to a public pool.  It didn&#39;t open until 12, and we got <br/>
there at 11:45.  I saw a bunch of people inside the lobby area, so I <br/>
figured they were waiting inside for the pool to open.  I walked in <br/>
with my kids and was told they weren&#39;t open until 12.  I said that <br/>
yes, I know they weren&#39;t open until 12, but couldn&#39;t we wait inside? <br/>
He said no, you have to wait outside.  I asked about all the other <br/>
people waiting inside (as I was turning to leave).  He said &quot;They&#39;re <br/>
county kids&quot;.  I said, &quot;So, does that make them special?&quot;  And he <br/>
said, &quot;Yes.  They pay 9,000 to swim in this pool&quot;.  I just left and <br/>
waited outside because my kids really wanted to swim there and I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to get us kicked out! lol But I really should have <br/>
said, &quot;My taxes pay for them to get preferential treatment over my <br/>
own children.&quot;  Ugh. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it would be possible to live in today&#39;s society and not <br/>
have some degree of literacy and participate in the economy in some <br/>
way.  We live in a literate society, full of all kinds of <br/>
interesting, stimulating things.  Some things will keep people from <br/>
fully enjoying the world around them--greed, violence, lack of love.  <br/>
Those things that keep people from enjoying life are the things that <br/>
need to change. <br/>
<br/>
There are some kids who wouldn&#39;t have the advantages that other kids <br/>
have, but the problem isn&#39;t lack of &quot;being educated&quot;.  It&#39;s just a <br/>
lack of good parenting.  If kids have good, involved parents, they <br/>
will learn.  That&#39;s one of the basic principles of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
One interesting thing I remember from one of Gatto&#39;s books was that <br/>
ever since compulsory schooling started, literacy rates dropped. He&#39;s <br/>
going by records of men entering the army during America&#39;s various <br/>
wars.  Before compulsory schooling, something like 95% of the men <br/>
were literate.  It steadily dropped with every year of compulsory <br/>
education.  <br/>
<br/>
So if we want to encourage literacy and an educated citizenry, we <br/>
don&#39;t want to do what doesn&#39;t work (school).  We want to find a way <br/>
to encourage parents to be good parents.  <br/>

<br/>
The &quot;preferential treatment&quot; probably had a lot more to do with lots of kids<br/>
and few adult. Could you imagine if they were sent outside and someone<br/>
wandered off? What a liability.<br/>
Hopefully these children will have some good memories from the summer swim<br/>
program to counter their rough lives.<br/>
