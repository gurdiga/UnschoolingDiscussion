<div id="ygrps-yiv-533658210">My best &quot;defence&quot; is youngest kidlet who pipes up and tells them like it<br/>
is.  She&#39;s so far ahead of their ps kids that they don&#39;t say anything about<br/>
the &quot;un&quot; part of the schooling process.  She taught herself to spell at<br/>
about 4 or 5 using Wheel of Fortune (and folks say there isn&#39;t anything<br/>
good about television &lt;g&gt;).  She is 7 now and has studied all kinds of<br/>
things that interest her including anatomy (flanges are her favorite bone<br/>
because of the sound of the word &lt;g&gt;)!  She loves money so is teaching<br/>
herself double and triple digit adding and subtracting.  She wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
done any of this if she was in ps and our ps parents know this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419622694">Dear Betsy,<br/>
<br/>
Hi!  I went to your web site, looked at the photos and read your first journal entries.  It looks great!  I look forward to following your journey!  I have<br/>
homeschooled my children for six years, but just started &quot;officially&quot; unschooling this year.  Before that it was more of a buy the curriculum, use it very<br/>
traditionally for about a week, and then gradually lose interest.  Now, I feel a little less guilty and have a better handle on how to guide the children with their<br/>
interests.  I really don&#39;t talk about &quot;unschooling&quot; to most of my homeschooling friends though, they would think I was crazy!<br/>
<br/>
blessings,<br/>
