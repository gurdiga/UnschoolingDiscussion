&lt;&lt; Between now & then, Ben & I will celebrate 19 years of marriage on  the <br/>
28th. <br/>
While waiting for _Finding Neverland_ to start this afternoon, he  leaned <br/>
over and said this was our best year yet! &lt;G&gt; The Sweetie! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations!  Wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, could you please tell again the marriage counselling outfit you and <br/>
Ben went to a while back?  And is there a web link you could give?  Irene might <br/>
not be the only one who could use it, and what a gift to give to children at <br/>
Christmas and all the time for their parents to be getting along!<br/>
<br/>

   It&#39;s Catholic-based, although you must not be Catholic to attend. They <br/>
even  accepted this atheist! &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s a full weekend---intensive and exhausting.  <br/>
But it&#39;s very powerful. If you *want* help, it&#39;s a great place to go. One <br/>
thing  Ben and I realized after hearing others&#39; situations was that *ours* wasn&#39;t <br/>
 nearly as bad! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s a blurb from their website. On the website, you can click on your  <br/>
area of the country to see when the next session near you will be  held.<br/>
 <br/>
I highly recommend it.<br/>

   <br/>
ABOUT THE RETROUVAILLE PROGRAM<br/>
<br/>
Retrouvaille is a live-in weekend and post weekend program for  married <br/>
couples. The emphasis is on a technique of communication between a  husband and <br/>
wife. During the weekend, a series of in-depth presentations are  given to you <br/>
and other couples like yourselves. Each presentation, given by one  of three <br/>
married couples and a priest, focuses on a specific area of a marriage  <br/>
relationship. After each presentation, you will have a chance to reflect on it  by <br/>
yourself, then discuss it with your spouse in complete privacy. The weekend  is <br/>
not a spiritual retreat, not a sensitivity group, not a seminar, nor is it a  <br/>
social gathering. You will, however be encouraged, to put the past behind you  <br/>
and start &#39;rediscovering&#39; one another again. The weekend is not a &#39;miracle  <br/>
cure&#39;, therefore, post-weekend sessions have been designed to continue the  <br/>
marriage renewal begun on the weekend. These follow-ups review earlier concepts  in <br/>
greater depth, present new ones and help you apply these concepts to your own <br/>
 marriage.  <br/>
HOW CAN YOU GET MORE INFORMATION? <br/>

If you wish to remain anonymous when calling for more  information, you need <br/>

If you then wish to register on  a program, please be assured that all names <br/>
are kept in strictest confidence.  <br/>
