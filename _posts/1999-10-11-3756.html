&lt;&lt; Should I ask for a blood test, is that the only true way to know? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A lot more Doctors are saying lets watch it.  I know if my doctor says <br/>
antibiotics, he&#39;s really sure it&#39;s necessary.  I think my 7 yo has been on <br/>
them once for a nasty, nasty, staph infection.  And my 5 yo has taken a <br/>
pencillian shot once. <br/>
<br/>
Interesting side note.  Taking antibiotic pills and liquid is rather out <br/>
dated.  I know that for this my Dr. gives one shot...  and that&#39;s it.  It&#39;s <br/>
done.  He is being very cautious in that he sees his patients back too much <br/>
because of lack of follow through.  And, this being the concern of the mega <br/>
bugs out there.<br/>
<br/>
But, although my kids don&#39;t like the shot, I have to confess I find it a lot <br/>
easier because it&#39;s over and done with.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>An elevated white blood count does not indicate the presence or absence of<br/>
bacteria.  Your white cells will increase during a viral infection.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to know for sure if something is bacterial is to culture it<br/>
and look at it.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that viral illnesses tend to have one certain pattern, and<br/>
bacterial have a different one.  Yellow to green snot, for example, is<br/>
almost always a virus.  Darker green to brown can be bacterial.  Fevers for<br/>
a viral infection tend to be relatively low, around 100 degrees, maybe 101.<br/>
Fevers that are significantly higher tend to be bacterial.<br/>
<br/>
These are not always the case, but tendencies.  Sometimes you can have an<br/>
infection and no fever at all.<br/>
<br/>
But an elevated white cell count is not an indication of bacterial<br/>
infection, or a reason to use antibiotics.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-754246833">Just to let you know that ear infections are rarely treated with antibiotics in<br/>
Europe.  Antihistamines are much more commonly used.  Most (not all) ear<br/>
infections get better on their own.  What pus? If the ear drum is intact how do<br/>
they see pus?  Usually the ear drum appears reddened.  We have never used<br/>
antibiotics with our kids though we came close on a couple of occasions.  They<br/>
have always started to get better before we become really freaked out.  I would<br/>
cave in much sooner but my wife is made of tougher stuff and is more self<br/>
reliant than I. I am brainwashed to a certain extent by being a nurse and<br/>
working around doctors so much.   I am grateful for her level headedness.<br/>
<br/>
I am confused by reports of pus in the ear.  And you are right in spades about<br/>
antibiotics. They are massively over prescribed often at the insistence of<br/>
confused patients.  Doctors need to be more assertive.  ( I never thought I<br/>
would say that!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192854324">In combination with other symptoms such as swelling, pain, redness, and general<br/>
malaise an elevated white count can be useful in deciding to use antibiotics<br/>
but I agree it by itself is not a sufficient reason.  You&#39;ve got to look at the<br/>
whole person.<br/>
