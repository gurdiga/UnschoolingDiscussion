&gt;&gt; believe he knew my feelings anyway - I don&#39;t hide a lot of my views....as<br/>
&gt;&gt; you might have noticed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ROFL!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Our goal for him was never college. Now that it&#39;s past, the goal is still<br/>
&gt;&gt; his happiness, not any other. His self-government and our trust in him have<br/>
&gt;&gt; so far been the foundation for everything, I believe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s what I thought.  Just checking.  I have a hard time with the<br/>
&gt; attitude of some homeschoolers that doing really well academically is *the*<br/>
&gt; proof that homeschooling works.<br/>

Our son decided on his own to go to college. He got himself accepted to<br/>
Hunter College in NYC - about 80 miles from our home in CT.<br/>
<br/>
When he left for the city, in late August four years ago, his words were,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not just going to college, I&#39;m leaving home.&quot;  He didn&#39;t mean that he<br/>
was ending his relationship with us -- we get along great -- but he was<br/>
stating his break with day to day dependence, he was ready for independence<br/>
even though he accepted our paying his tuition and living expenses.<br/>
<br/>
His first true test of his abilities was not academics but how to survive in<br/>
that city. He needed a place to live first -- the dorms had been filled, not<br/>
that he wanted to live in one anyway. He found a roommate, a girl from<br/>
California, through a bulletin board at the college, who also wanted to live<br/>
off campus (campus is three skyscrapers in mid-town plus a theater and a few<br/>
other smaller buildings)<br/>
<br/>
Those two got to know each other really well and quickly because they did<br/>
not move into their own place until November 7th. In the meantime, they<br/>
stayed in several different hotels and weekly-rent rooming houses, living<br/>
out of suitcases, eating in restaurants, doing laundry, taking the subway to<br/>
school and taking their unfamiliar courses in unfamiliar places, and having<br/>
to move at short notice and not even know where they would move to, each<br/>
time. An adventure that most parents could not imagine having their kids<br/>
endure even at college age...we think of going to college would be a gentle<br/>
experience with food and lodging taken care of among grassy courtyards and<br/>
shade trees with only other students to deal with. These two were thrust<br/>
into the raging city, the big apple, the 24 hour nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
What I realized was that kids who had been told what to do all their lives<br/>
could never have survived what these two did -- the girl, even younger than<br/>
our son, was accustomed to being her own boss and dealing with her own<br/>
finances and responsibilities. She was really far from home, but managed it<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
 They never complained. They told the story almost as if it were a bad movie<br/>
happening to them. But brother did they learn a lot. And when classes<br/>
started (in mid Sept.) and during the always-confusing intruductory period,<br/>
our son was the one whom   others asked what to do. He got it right away,<br/>
without ever going to school, and we believed that it was exactly because he<br/>
had never been to school and was always deciding things, and figuring them<br/>
out, for himself. It had been the unschooling that prepared him for such<br/>
dealing with a complex and difficult situation.<br/>
<br/>
They found a beautiful new apartment building with a decent sized LR 2br/<br/>
2b/K/small balcony/ 3rd Fl unit that turned out to be an enviable situation<br/>
downtown - where many such young folks want to be, and are - a short walk to<br/>
the subway (access to the whole city) and a twenty minute ride to the<br/>
college (which has it&#39;s own station), plenty of ethnic restaurants in the<br/>
neighborhood (called the Lower East Side), markets and stores and night<br/>
clubs of every description.<br/>
<br/>
The two of them stayed in that apartment for the entire four years and<br/>
became fast friends, both did well in their fields, and both seemed to<br/>
manage themselves and their relationships well. In our son&#39;s case, we and he<br/>
give the credit to how we raised him to make his own decisions. In one essay<br/>
for freshman English, the assignment was to describe their upbringing. He<br/>
described his unschooling life in what were, to him, normal terms of a<br/>
self-governing experience, but of course to the professor (a woman --<br/>
thirtyish) his was a most unusual story, and her comment, which we treasure,<br/>
of course, was that he must have had incredibly trusting parents to raise<br/>
him that way. He was happy to show it to us. We cried, of course.<br/>
<br/>
The message here is: Let.  Let it happen.  Watch, and trust, and help if you<br/>
can, but also trust from just the right distance, not too close, not<br/>
distant. Hands on, but not massaging. So....Let..&..Trust.<br/>
<br/>
There does seem to be a plan. Our job seems to be not to make it, but to<br/>
watch it unfold.      ...there I go, crying again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great post, Ned.  Made me teary, too.<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to me that I might be writing similar things in 20 years. <br/>
 The situation with my kids is similar to yours. (Don&#39;t you have old <br/>
children who went to school?)  My 8 yo is already a self-governing <br/>
person.  But I think there are going to be a whole lot more young people <br/>
like him, too.  How lucky your son was to find someone like that!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious about your son when he was 8, and your mindset then, too. <br/>
 I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve written about it some, but there&#39;s a lot of reading to do!<br/>
