<div id="ygrps-yiv-647619561">&lt;&lt;I give my children an actual choice, not a &quot;so-called &#39;power of choice&#39;&quot;<br/>
to<br/>
choose anything in the house to eat at any time.  At very young ages, they<br/>
made decisions BETTER than most adults I know.  They eat ice cream very<br/>
rarely, although it&#39;s always there.  They eat cookies and cake hardly at<br/>
all.<br/>
Donuts dry up.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
About three/four months ago, I did what AnneO,Sandra, Ren and Joyce (and<br/>
others) suggested and i began trusting my children to eat according to their<br/>
bodies needs, even the two year old. I began &quot;undieting&quot; (not diet to lose<br/>
weight, diet as in what people eat) Once my children had their fill of the<br/>
sweeter stuff, once they trusted Me to not decide for them, they started<br/>
choosing healthy.<br/>
Yesterday Emily had a choice of Pop-tarts, vegetable soup, grapes, milk,<br/>
pretzles, lemon drops, girl scout cookies, salad. For lunch she had<br/>
Vegetable soup. Later she had ice cream. For breakfast I think she ate<br/>
yogurt she grabbed from the fridge and a granola bar.<br/>
I think she had another soup for dinner but I don&#39;t remember. Max also makes<br/>
his own choices although I tend to &quot;strew&quot; foods with larger quantities of<br/>
vitamins minerals, antioxidents, fiber since he doesn&#39;t wuite understand the<br/>
intricacies of healthy eating. They are healthy, growing, happy children.<br/>
It took a few months for us to &quot;de-diet&quot; but it really worked. Try it for a<br/>
few months (who ever is reading this) you may be surprised. I seriously<br/>
doubt that in todays food industry, a child who&#39;s parent provides free reign<br/>
to food that includes all kinds of choices will become nutritionally<br/>
deficient. Even Spiderman Pop-Tarts are fortified.<br/>
