&gt; I&#39;m sorry to hear about your Grandpa. That has to be especially hard on<br/>
&gt; your Grandmother. Wow! 67 years! What an inspiration! Take care of<br/>
&gt; yourself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Wende...it is hard on Grandma.. I know this is pretty intense ( and <br/>
probably not uncommon)  but when he died, Grandma fell to her knees and <br/>
begged God to take her too.  She REALLY, wanted to die before Grandpa.   I <br/>
think Grandpa held on for months because he knew how his death with affect <br/>
Grandma.    Its sad.. but, its also wonderful to remember Grandpa and know, <br/>
truely, sincerely KNOW that he was the nearest to perfect man that he could <br/>
have possibly been.   I know when folks die, all the accolades and testimony <br/>
come out professing how great the person was ( and most folks are).. But, <br/>
with my Grandpa...well, he REALLY was one of a kind.   Of all the people I <br/>
know, I cant think of anyone as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;real&quot; as my Grandpa.   My moms a <br/>
close second though :-)   She inherited Grandpas wonderful spirit and kind, <br/>
gentle ways.. and his sense of fun too.   Mom also got a bit of Grandmas <br/>
&quot;contrariness&quot;.. lol.but hey, she allowed,, womens perogative.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve said this before.. If  I could be half the mother that my mother is... <br/>
well, I&#39;de be a damn good mother.   One thing that mom said during the <br/>
&quot;family viewing&quot; .. she was crying and hugged me and my sisters.. she said.. <br/>
&quot;he was the best daddy in the world. . the VERY best daddy anyone could dream <br/>
of.. I just wish everyone could have a daddy like mine&quot;   My sister <br/>
said...&quot;your the best momma in the world, we&#39;re lucky to have you&quot;  Mom <br/>
said.. &quot;well, anything good in me came from my daddy&quot;. I know my Momma is <br/>
good and wonderful in her own right, but, no one can deny what influence a <br/>
parent has on a child.  Some of it &quot;modeling&#39; and some of it genetic. <br/>
<br/>
I see a lot of family estrangement on this list.  A lot of complaining and <br/>
pain from the past.  I know that a lot of folks came this way because of <br/>
wanting to be &quot;better&quot; than thier parents.   Lots of parents have failed <br/>
thier children.. mistreated them.. disrespected them.. and those children <br/>
have ended up &quot;here&quot;  looking for a better way to raise thier children.   <br/>
I&#39;ve been extremely fortunate and blessed to have had a wonderful family that <br/>
I can not find fault with.. Even if they did make me wash the dishes and come <br/>
home by midnight :-)  And, Ive got a spanking or two in my life.    I never <br/>
doubted for one  minute ANYTHING my parents did was out of love.   <br/>

You are so fortunate to have experienced these fruits. They sound like<br/>
wonderful people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, and I am one of those. My parents most assuredly had &quot;issues&quot; that<br/>
greatly affected my childhood. But the older I get, the more I realize<br/>
that they tried their hardest within their capacity to be good parents.<br/>
These babies don&#39;t come with an instruction book that says &quot;Do this and<br/>
you are guaranteed success&quot;. I don&#39;t want to cause the same pains to my<br/>
children, that were caused me. While I don&#39;t hold any animosity towards<br/>
them now, I don&#39;t want to duplicate the same patterns. You and your<br/>
children are so blessed to have such wonderful role models and<br/>
inspirations in your life, even if it is for what seems to be  a short<br/>
time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, we are blessed.. ..But, I also dont want to give the impression that it <br/>
was ALL a bed of roses... I thought after I wrote that post.. about &quot; <br/>
eveything they done for us was out of love&quot; and  yeah, thats true.. what they <br/>
done FOR US... But, my dad was (is) an alcholic and that certainly wasnt a <br/>
good role model.  He is a great man and his character and good qualities far <br/>
outweigh his flaws.. ANd my mom is so great, she really helpled balance out <br/>
the &quot;yucky stuff&quot; with dads alcoholism.  Dad was never abusive or &quot;lazy&quot;.. he <br/>
always worked hard and provided for his family.   He just liked to drink and <br/>
have a good time.  ( still, not acceptable, to the extent that he did it)  In <br/>
that respect, I vowed to never drink in excess nor to marry a man that <br/>
remotely had any of the flaws that my dad did.   My husband does not drink, <br/>
gamble, hunt and fish excessively.. and lots of the other things that I felt <br/>
my dad did to the detriment of his family.  But, my dad also has qualities <br/>
that my husband lacks.   Still, all in all, I do count myself  and my family <br/>
blessed.<br/>
