I think that is WONDERFUL, because when a friend of mine signed up for high <br/>
school here to play football, they wouldn&#39;t even let him take HISTORY.  They <br/>
said he could ONLY take English, math and science if he wanted to go half <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;know why?<br/>
<br/>
He had to prove he could make a 3.0 since they were making the other football <br/>
players make a 3.0.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is it possible for your child to elect to attend a certain class or two at<br/>
the local school?  Some schools will let you do that, in order to get the $$<br/>
from the state.  Our local elementary school allows homeschoolers to enroll<br/>
for what they call &quot;specials&quot; (art, music, p.e., german, and library).  Now,<br/>
nobody scream that that&#39;s not special stuff because I already did that.<br/>
They think I&#39;m nuts up there; the feeling is mutual.<br/>
<br/>
The first week my son was enrolled, in October, we went 4 times.  The second<br/>
week, we managed to make it twice.  I think we went about 8 more times the<br/>
rest of the year.  I don&#39;t think they appreciate our sporadic attendence,<br/>
but it gave Tim are real school experience.  It was more than enough.  It&#39;s<br/>
school registration time here.  We&#39;re not registering, at my son&#39;s request.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843049843">Thanks to everyone who shared ideas with my husband and me for our unschooling child.  We have since sat down with her and asked about the appeal of school.  Her answer was that her<br/>
friends weren&#39;t around , she was envious of their new stuff, and she was just plain curious.  We asked her what we could do to satisfy her curiosity without going to school and together<br/>
we came up with a plan.  We will shop for a lunch box (thanks for suggesting this) and school supplies, we will gather her stuff at the table at 9, two days a week, after breakfast and<br/>
chores are done, and for 1 or 2 hours we will school.  She&#39;s willing to &quot;teach&quot; me, and I said I would &quot;teach&quot; her, we&#39;ll take turns (thanks for this idea too).<br/>
Our older son is very skeptical about this, but relieved that his sister will not be going to school - he really doesn&#39;t want her there.  This school will last however long it lasts and<br/>
I&#39;m sure it will be fun.<br/>
Thanks for all your help, I think it&#39;s going to work!  (We are definitely going to the museum for the dinosaurs on the first day of school.)<br/>
