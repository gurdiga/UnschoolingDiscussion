<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131217873">We too love this show and Debbie is my personal favorite. The only problem I <br/>
have with the show is that Liza is often dishonest with her parents. They <br/>
will tell her to stay in camp, for her own safety, and she says she will but <br/>
leaves the minute after her parents leave. Her word is like worthless.  Of <br/>
course there is always a good reason, she will be trying to save an animal or <br/>
something, and usually about gets herself killed. Or she tells her Mom, while <br/>
camping, that she is going to bed and instead sneaks off. We still watch the <br/>
show and we like it but we do discuss why it would be a bad idea to behave <br/>
this way and we all agree here that is a failing in the show. <br/>
peace and grace<br/>
