&lt;&lt; btw: this is a tough issue because there are one or two vaccines that are <br/>
safe. For example there is a company that makes a great tetanus vaccine <br/>
(I can get the name if anyone is interested). YET some states require <br/>
either a)religious b) medical. Very few states also allow c) conscious <br/>
choice. &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I would be interested in who makes a safe(r) tetanus or any others.<br/>
<br/>
Also, our family has a M.D. that only promotes four childhood vaccines.  When <br/>
our first child was born, I questioned him on school exemption letters, <br/>
because I thought at the time that only some religions were allowed to object <br/>
across the board.  He told me that basically all religions have some <br/>
guidelines such as &quot;Don&#39;t harm your children&quot;, therefore, as long as you <br/>
believe that by following your faith means not vaccinating, you can <br/>
religiously object.<br/>
