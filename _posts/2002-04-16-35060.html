<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111704202">I&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to ask for advice/help......<br/>
My 10 year old son has been unschooling for about 1 1/2 years. We started out <br/>
&quot;doing school&quot; at home for about 2 weeks--until I found the unschooling.com <br/>
website.<br/>
That&#39;s when we realized what we were doing was too much like what we were <br/>
trying to get away from. So I put all the workbooks and cut loose. I feel <br/>
like he&#39;s learning by leaps and bounds--not that I&#39;m measuring--he just <br/>
shares everything with me. (translate that to he&#39;s taught me a lot of stuff <br/>
in this last year....)<br/>
Now he says that next year he wants to go back to ps. I am sick inside. We <br/>
battled with the district for 4 years to have his needs met (he has Aspergers <br/>
Syndrome, which is in the autistic spectrum) and that was the main reason why <br/>
we started homeschooling in the first place. I feel like this is where he <br/>
needs to be, but I also feel like I need to trust that he knows what he <br/>
wants, and if it doesn&#39;t work out, we can always come back to home schooling. <br/>
Anybody out there have a similar story--I&#39;m open to suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
thanks, Nancy S.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548647483">Nancy does he have lots of contact and chances to play with other children??<br/>
<br/>
I ask this because I go through this with Chaelene from time to time and it<br/>
makes my heart ache.  We live in the country with no children close by, her<br/>
brother is 8 years younger and the only contact she has with other children<br/>
is at Church and 4H which just isn&#39;t the same as playing with kids on a play<br/>
ground and group activities with children.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that is not why he wants to go to school, has he said why?  I want to<br/>
try and get Chaelene into more contact with children.  She says she doesn&#39;t<br/>
like the classroom part but she really wishes she had lots of friends like<br/>
she did at school.<br/>
<br/>
What is he communicating to you about this?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307048423">Nancy S., did he tell you what his reasons are for wanting to return to<br/>
ps?  My son sometimes says he wants to go to ps, and when I draw him out<br/>
he realizes he has other options to achieve the same goal.  If the goal<br/>
is socializing we can arrange more opportunities to spend time with<br/>
friends.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476363150">Dear Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
I have been hs, my 12 year old son for a year and a half .<br/>
When we cut loose from PS, I held strong the thought of<br/>
ever going back.<br/>
He has changed, and and so have I. Also, I went with my<br/>
gut instinct and found a med. that is working for him. ( I was<br/>
against any medications and felt I could help him to solve<br/>
all of his problems (anxiety issues for one) with TLC and<br/>
homeschool. That worked only to a certain extent.<br/>
He was also forgiving of his past ps experience, and<br/>
had asked repeatedly to go back.<br/>
As of now we have toured a new school, and will only<br/>
start out an hour a day.  I recently quit daycare,<br/>
and need to work. <br/>
Yes, lots of apprehesive feelings, lots of emotions about<br/>
anyone else teaching my son and second guessing their<br/>
teaching styles.<br/>
I have given my son the chance to make his choices, be they<br/>
wrong or right,  I can&#39;t hold him back from them. I know where<br/>
he and I stand with hs, and we can easily go back.</div>
