<div id="ygrps-yiv-794663990">I&#39;ve been talking to a friend who is homeschooling for under a year; <br/>
she seems to be leaning towards unschooling. But she&#39;s very into <br/>
using the labels that the public schools and doctors determined for <br/>
her children. Each child has at least three &quot;problems&quot;. I&#39;m going to <br/>
be out of PC range for a few days possibly (going to Montana on <br/>
exchange) but wanted to ask folks what their experiences were in <br/>
rescuing a child from the diseases of the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, perhaps there is a link to this in your or Anne O.&#39;s stuff? <br/>
I&#39;d like to be able to help this person get away from these labels. <br/>
I&#39;m looking up Howard Gardners book but can&#39;t remember the exact <br/>
title. Any help would be appreciated. If you would like to email me <br/>
off list, I&#39;m at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cheeps4u@...">cheeps4u@...</a>. Maybe when I get where I&#39;m going <br/>
they&#39;ll have a PC so I can respond. Thanks Sara in NC</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042453099">** I&#39;ve been talking to a friend who is homeschooling for under a year;<br/>
she seems to be leaning towards unschooling. But she&#39;s very into<br/>

<br/>
What about a two-step approach with her?  First, let her find info that <br/>
convinces her that &quot;unschooling will work&quot; with kids who have issues <br/>
like her kids.  (The Special Needs part of the Unschooling.Com message <br/>
boards is good for this.  What the labels are good for is giving her a <br/>
word to search for.)<br/>
<br/>
After this step, then promote the idea of label dropping.  And she&#39;ll <br/>
probably see that if she reads much on the message boards.<br/>
