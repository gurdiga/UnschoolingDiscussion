<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153224056">I&#39;ve seen the NOVA presentation of Musical Minds for the second time  <br/>
now, both by chance, and I&#39;m thrilled that I saw it.  It&#39;s an Oliver  <br/>
Sachs program, about music and brain function.   A DVD costs $44.95  <br/>
and that&#39;s a lot.    It seems you can watch it online.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to link it on my music page, but first I&#39;d like to know  <br/>
whether people in Canada, Europe or the Pacific can even get onto that  <br/>
site, or if there are DVDs available in other formats.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364305869">Oh!  And for those in the U.S. who can see it, it will only be  <br/>
available free until July 7:<br/>

Note: Due to rights restrictions, this program is only available for  <br/>
streaming on the NOVA website for one week, from July 1-7, 2009.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you can even read the chapters, it&#39;s cool, though, and this is one  <br/>
of those shows that just won&#39;t work in a book (like The History of  <br/>
English, which did have a companion book, but the best part was  <br/>
hearing the accents).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hearing the music is the best part.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14295208">I live in Europe (The Netherlands) and I can&#39;t see the program.<br/>
<br/>
I get this message when I try to watch the first part:<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re sorry, but due to rights restrictions this program is only available for online viewing in the United States. You appear to be connected to the Internet from outside this area. <br/>

Thanks for letting me know.  As it detects my location, it lets me  <br/>
watch without telling me who can&#39;t watch.<br/>
<br/>
Well darn.  I won&#39;t put it on my site, but I hope it becomes widely  <br/>
available before long and for less than $50.<br/>
