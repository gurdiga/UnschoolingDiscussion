<div id="ygrps-yiv-445620758">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have been in the public school system for three years now.  Two of <br/>
those years were with Americorps.  I have come to realize that my <br/>
views of what education should be are not congruent with the current <br/>
system.  This comes as no surprise.  However, I have found that my <br/>
work (and other&#39;s work)in attempting to create changes in education <br/>
which will better serve our nation&#39;s children has been squelched by <br/>
the political machine which controls our public school system.  I <br/>
will continue to attempt to reform education through the ballot as a <br/>
member of a political party, but I also want to work in an <br/>
environment towards achieving a better education system for our kids -<br/>
 a sytem which teaches them civic responsibility; how to resolve <br/>
conflict peacefully; how communities function; how science, <br/>
technology, and math relate to real life and society, not abstract <br/>
problems that have no context to &quot;the real world&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
We teach a person how to drive by placing them in a car and guiding <br/>
them.  Our public schools are about placing people in a box and <br/>
giving them commands every ten minutes.  Sounds to me more like <br/>
preparing them for the assembly line than to be an individual working <br/>
to improve the world.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I ask if anyone here knows of progressive schools in the <br/>
Portland, OR area in which I may be a positive contribution by carry <br/>
out my work in education and curriculum development.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
