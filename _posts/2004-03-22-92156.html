<div id="ygrps-yiv-222705951">On the school optional thread Kelly said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Make school &quot;optional&quot;----he goes when he wants. And make *your* days more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>interesting than those at school!&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Boy am I ever trying!  We don&#39;t have anyone wanting to go back to school but<br/>
my ds has the blahs and dh is wondering if he will ever be interested in<br/>
anything. Nintendo and gameboy don&#39;t count much on dh&#39;s scale of positive<br/>
activities though my two guys do share a love of Unreal tournament 2004.<br/>
<br/>
Trayton is 10.  He reads less, plays outside less, seems generally bored<br/>
more often and is not as happy as we wish he were.  He *loves* our park day<br/>
but once a week isn&#39;t enough.  We go to two other park days but his favorite<br/>
friends aren&#39;t there so he usually sits and plays game boy.<br/>
<br/>
He gets irritated if anyone suggests that he get out and get some fresh air<br/>
or play outside.  Just not interested.  He has gained some girth as a result<br/>
and this really bothers him.  I don&#39;t want to say anything to make him feel<br/>
worse but I&#39;m not sure what to do or how to help.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas welcome.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578735614">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I have a different opinion on the food fight scenario.  I feel it <br/>
can fun even with a little planning.  You could put all the foods <br/>
outside on a table and then say, &quot;go to it!&quot; or maybe start it off <br/>
yourself. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not as if you are OVERplanning it, telling each child, &quot;OK. now <br/>
it&#39;s your turn to toss the mashed potatoes on his head.&quot; I don&#39;t see <br/>
anything wrong with telling the children you want to do it outside, <br/>
as long as you tell them the reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Just another opinion :)<br/>

 <br/>
Maybe if you offered to go outside and play with him, he would be more<br/>
interested.  You could play whiffle ball, Frisbee, jump rope, go for a walk,<br/>
bike ride, walk a pet (if you don&#39;t have one borrow someone else&#39;s?), or<br/>
toss a ball. <br/>

specifically include some park time afterwards (which is what HE wants, <br/>
I know). Aquarium visit, for example. Movie screenings. Go see a tv <br/>
show being taped. Beach days could be started up pretty soon - why <br/>
don&#39;t you set them up weekly with evening cookouts on an alternative <br/>
day from park days - so that&#39;ll give him an extra day per week with his <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
Play dates - I know you try, so I guess I&#39;m just saying, &quot;Try harder <br/>
&lt;G&gt;.&quot; (Easy for me to say, I know.)<br/>
<br/>
Continue to encourage your husband to take him out of the house to do <br/>
outdoorsy kinds of things. He just might like to shoot baskets, for <br/>
instance, for just a few minutes with his dad - not big deals, just a <br/>
few minutes of something here and there.<br/>
<br/>
  Make more one-on-one time happen (I know how hard it is) - where you <br/>
&quot;do&quot; things - get a project started together that he might carry on <br/>
farther without you.<br/>
<br/>
Book discussion club might be fun for him - he does LOVE to talk about <br/>
what he&#39;s reading! &lt;G&gt; So - start one.<br/>
<br/>
Also - sort of like the Mazlow hierarchy of needs - I have a feeling he <br/>
won&#39;t get involved in stuff unless his social needs are being met, <br/>
first. So maybe your focus HAS to be on that and not so much on helping <br/>
him find other passions.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if he got involved in some more outside activities, <br/>
maybe he&#39;d find more other kids to spend time playing with? Chess club?<br/>
<br/>
If you can set up a regular time for more social contact, that he can <br/>
count on, that might help the most of anything - knowing that he has it <br/>
coming up, seeing it on a calendar, he might be more inclined to enjoy <br/>
the rest of his time outside of that, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617030236">I haven&#39;t been following this discussion - or any others for the last <br/>
few days because we have been so very busy, so I hope I have got the <br/>
right idea about the subject from the last few posts.  We are busy again <br/>
today, but tomorrow we&#39;ll be home - and I just know we will all be <br/>
&#39;bored&#39;, that we will all sit around playing on the computer, watching <br/>
tv, staying inside most of the time even if it is sunny and we should be <br/>
outside enjoying the last of summer here in New Zealand.<br/>
<br/>
I know this, because this is how we react to being busy.<br/>
<br/>
For us, the busy-ness is chosen activities rather than ones imposed on <br/>
us by others, so it will only take us a couple of days to recover (well, <br/>
one day for the kids, 2 or 3 for me!).  When I think back to my school <br/>
days, several decades ago, I remeber it took me half the holidays to <br/>
recover from school enough to enjoy the second half.  Same when I was <br/>
working in jobs that I had because I needed a job, rather than jobs I <br/>
chose because I wanted to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I have watched many kids come out of school, or school-at-home <br/>
situations, over the 18 years we been homeschooling.  The ones that fell <br/>
enthusiastically into a &#39;self-motivated&#39; zest for learning usually <br/>
crashed into a pile of resentment and boredom after a few weeks / <br/>
months.  They were, in fact, still operating out of perceived others&#39; <br/>
expecation, when they appeared to be doing so &#39;well&#39;.  The ones that <br/>
still felt comfortable enough in their Selves, and comfortable enough <br/>
with their families, tend to do the bored blahs at the beginning.  I <br/>
think it means that, in general, thses kids are less lost that the other <br/>
kind.<br/>
<br/>
It is really hard to sit and watch, but though strewing is a great idea, <br/>
and he will probably eventually pick up on some of the &#39;strewings&#39;, it <br/>
will happen a lot quicker if he feels that he is free not to - that he <br/>
is free to just be blah.  It&#39;s almost like creating a vacuum inside, <br/>
letting go / getting rid of &#39;stuff&#39; until an invisible point is reached <br/>
and suddenly the kid is doing all kinds of things. But there&#39;s no <br/>
telling when it will happen.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that makes sense.<br/>

Hi, Kris --<br/>
<br/>
My son is turning 10 next month, and life here is a lot like what you <br/>
describe for your son.  We moved not long ago and are trying to make <br/>
friends at the local park day.  (We still drive 65 miles to go to the <br/>
old one.)  Is your son an only child?  (Mine is.)  Having other kids <br/>
over and pestering my friends to invite me over is the best tonic I&#39;ve <br/>
found for perking our days up.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I sympathize.  Is your son still deschooling, or just having a <br/>
kind of quiet period?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have been know to go outside and run around for a light sabre fight with my 10 year old  He loves this activity and so do I as it means we both get exercise and get to have fun together! We do a lot of walking, too..<br/>
<br/>
I also have found that my kids are more drawn to physical exercise either when I am directly involved or when I undertake exercise myself. As I have got into yoga and pilates and weights this last year or so, I have noticed my kids ( younger and older) wanting to do these , too - asking for some kids workout books, smaller weights, books on martial arts after watching me do a kickboxing video :-)....Leonie<br/>
