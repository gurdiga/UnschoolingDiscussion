&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;OH never mind.  Those who couldn&#39;t speak the language wouldn&#39;t reproduce<br/>

If someone can&#39;t speak the language very well, he won&#39;t be on anyone&#39;s &quot;top <br/>
ten eligible bachelors&quot; list.  When people choose mates they go for the best <br/>
possible.  If someone can&#39;t speak plainly enough that you can&#39;t tell whether <br/>
he&#39;s saying &quot;but&quot; or &quot;dog&quot; (pero or perro) you probably don&#39;t want to have <br/>
long romantic conversations and marry him.  Or he won&#39;t have a high paying <br/>
job as a tv announcer so that his salary lures in potential mates.<br/>

Mainly, I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s genetic at all.<br/>
<br/>
But more specifically I&#39;m saying IF it is genetic, why are there not lots of <br/>
babies born in Spanish-speaking families who can&#39;t possibly pronounce &#39;rr&#39;?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a mix as with most aspects of development. Chomsky&#39;s idea of<br/>
the language aquisition device is very intriguing and explains the built-in<br/>
patterns of development that infants all go thru around the world. BUT this<br/>
must be reinforced with positive responses or the behavior is extinguished<br/>
(as in the case of deaf babies making babbling noises at the same time as<br/>
hearing babies but then stopping). <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here again is the reinforcer. In Spanish they get positive reactions to<br/>
make the &quot;rr&quot; sound but it doesn&#39;t elicit a strong response from English<br/>
speaking parents. So we just drop the innate ability to produce that sound.<br/>
