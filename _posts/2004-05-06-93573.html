<div id="ygrps-yiv-812687997">Hi All,<br/>
 <br/>
Have any of you seen this? Not that we need research to convince us <br/>
that unschooling is right for us BUT for all the naysayers (like <br/>
SOME of our friends and relatives whom think we are all just a bit <br/>
nuts for homeschooling/unschooling - me personally, I can&#39;t even say <br/>
unschooling in my husband&#39;s family, they FREAK!) here is some <br/>
research to blow their mind away! I plan on getting Dr. Ray&#39;s book <br/>
too!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; here is some research to blow their mind away!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I think it&#39;s best to keep in mind that the statistics were gathered by<br/>
HSLDA and most HSLDA folks are conservative Christians who mostly do school<br/>
at home. Their goals are different than most unschoolers so their results<br/>
are going to be different.<br/>
<br/>
Fundamentalist Christianity, homeschooling, and politics are all tightly<br/>
intertwined and that explains why some of the statistics are what they are,<br/>
eg, a higher proportion of the homeschooled support banning books from<br/>
libraries, only 4% of the respondents found politics to be too complicated<br/>
to understand versus 35% of the general population, etc. (Patrick Henry<br/>
College was created in a roundabout way as an offshoot of HSLDA to be a<br/>
college specifically for homeschooled kids who are oriented towards<br/>
politics.)<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to look at what the statistics suggest when viewed as<br/>
answers from the Christian Right rather than answers from homeschoolers.<br/>
(Not sure why &quot;only&quot; 88% are affiliated with a church (or some group) but it<br/>
is significantly higher than 50% for the general population.)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they statistics support that homeschooling not only works but does<br/>
better than school, but unless we understand why statistics look as they do<br/>
even positive statistics can come back and bite us on the butt ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Even without the Christian/school-at-home bias, kids who are homeschooled<br/>
have involved caring parents. Schools are stuck with kids whose home life<br/>
runs the gamut from parents who are involved to parents who are passed out<br/>
on drugs. *Any* form of education that requires involved parents will show<br/>
better results than public schools.<br/>
<br/>
(Homeschools may also have a disproportionate number of kids with special<br/>
needs too but that&#39;s going to have more of a negative effect on statistics<br/>
having to do with standardized testing.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175203705">This was a survey that homeschoolers 16 or over could take on the <br/>
internet (or their parents could fill it in for them.) The survey was <br/>
terrible. It has very intrusive and ridiculous questions and I have <br/>
heard that many people taking it quit in the middle because they were <br/>
offended by the questions or found them to be worded in ways that made <br/>
it impossible to answer. It was also very long. And, parents completing <br/>
FOR their grown children? That&#39;s so outside the realm of good research! <br/>
But, I know LOTS of people who filled it out, on the internet, just to <br/>
be able to read through it - so who knows what answers they gave. I&#39;d <br/>
conclude that the results are entirely totally absolutely meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
There are a million problems with survey research and this survey has <br/>
every weakness it could possibly have, imo.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do have to say that they made an effort to get homeschoolers <br/>
of all types to fill it out - it was not sent only to HSLDA people, <br/>
they put some energy into getting grown homeschoolers who were not <br/>
necessarily &quot;Christian Homeschoolers,&quot; to fill it out and I know some <br/>
who did.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago I was at a meeting of the American Education Research <br/>
Association - I was on a panel debating homeschooling - and the point <br/>
was made by the researchers there, several times, that research done BY <br/>
homeschoolers on homeschoolers isn&#39;t exactly likely to be unbiased. So <br/>
surveys like this are pretty much disregarded by serious researchers.<br/>
<br/>
Brian Ray, author of this study, (who was also on the panel) pointed <br/>
out that much of their research was not intended for the &quot;research <br/>
community,&quot; but that their audience was really other families who are <br/>
considering homeschooling. To the extent that those families are coming <br/>
to HSLDA for information and sort of tend to match the profiles of the <br/>
people in the surveys, then the information is perfectly good for them. <br/>
He pointed out that what they want to know is what is likely to happen <br/>
in their lives if THEY homeschool and that hearing from thousands of <br/>
homeschooling families that their kids grew up and were successful is <br/>
encouraging to them. So - viewed as surveys with that purpose, not with <br/>
actual &quot;research&quot; purpose, they&#39;re perfectly fine.  I could survey <br/>
people on this list and report the results and as long as I didn&#39;t try <br/>
to generalize the results to people who wouldn&#39;t be caught dead on this <br/>
list &lt;G&gt; and offered the results only to people who DO fit the profile <br/>
of the people who filled out the survey, then it might be interesting.  <br/>
It is no different, really, than what we do all the time, sharing <br/>
anecdotes and experiences and people feeling encouraged by them. The <br/>
difference is, we don&#39;t try to put it all in &quot;data&quot; form and publish it <br/>
and imply that any of it applies to &quot;all&quot; homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
There IS other research, done by impartial analysts. Not ALL research <br/>
is done by NHERI (National Home Education Research Institute) which is <br/>
run by Brian Ray, homeschooler and libertarian and primarily funded by <br/>
HSLDA.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little embarrassed, to be honest, by the research that NHERI <br/>
does. It is SO easy to poke holes in it and the one thing that it does <br/>
is make it seem like doing that kind of research on homeschoolers is <br/>
OKAY with homeschoolers. I think we need to make the point, strongly <br/>
and repeatedly, that the very act of researching us can be disruptive <br/>
and destructive to what we are actually doing in our families. There <br/>
are researchers (Rob Reich, for example) who want to regulate <br/>
homeschoolers so that data about homeschoolers can be more easily <br/>
collected. They are frustrated with the difficulty of studying us - <br/>
heck, they point out, rightly, that they can&#39;t even COUNT us. But, my <br/>
answer is, sorry, but our right to privacy comes before your desire to <br/>
make doing research easier. There are experimental methods in which the <br/>
subject is harmed or destroyed as part of the experiment. Making <br/>
research easier by regulating homeschoolers (requiring standardized <br/>
testing, curriculum approval or other intrusions like those) would <br/>
disrupt and harm homeschooling for many of us. This is a form of <br/>
destroying the thing you are studying as part of the experimental <br/>
method and it is clearly unethical to do that to human beings. It <br/>
seemed that many, but not all, of the researchers in the room at the <br/>
AERA conference got that point and agreed.<br/>

Not absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
Some are at homeschooling by default, and aren&#39;t being too active with it.  <br/>
(Not people on this list.  People I WISH were on this list so they&#39;d get some <br/>
better ideas than the benign neglect being practiced here and there.  Not <br/>
lots.  I hope.)<br/>

<br/>
As testing would be for unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I think just generally that any research on homeschoolers done by the <br/>
educational establishment would be more biased than even HSLDA could conjure up in <br/>
their wildest apocalyptic dreams, because  they/school lose money and possibly <br/>
their jobs themselves if they prove we&#39;re doing even okay (not just better).  <br/>
Their only acceptable results would be that we&#39;re harming our children, and <br/>
using their own criteria as guidelines, they could prove it (within their windows <br/>
and on their timetables, not with ultimate or intangible results).<br/>
<br/>
And anyway, they&#39;re so intent upon and accustomed to blaming parents for <br/>
kids&#39;s failures and not themselves or their system, that they can&#39;t see the noses <br/>
in front of their own faces.<br/>
