Think of it like diving into a swimming pool. You dread the initial plunge<br/>
but once you&#39;re in the water, it&#39;s exactly where you want to be!<br/>
<br/>
Julie, in the water and loving it!!<br/>

<br/>
I took lots of deep breaths and one day at a time - like when I was quitting smoking!  :O))  <br/>

Every once in a while I&#39;d think they needed more &quot;discipline&quot; but that faded as I saw the results - now I am in awe of how well it can work.  They are such real people!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s normal to panic a bit when doing something wholly different, <br/>
that affects your whole life, and your son&#39;s, in such a dramatic way!  <br/>
<br/>
He spent hours every day in a community that became important to him.   I <br/>
would help Fisher thru saying goodbye to those things, and look at it as a way of <br/>
finding out more about him when he tells you what he misses and what he <br/>
enjoyed, etc.  I think that most people are surprised how much more intimate the <br/>
child/parent relationship can be when unschooling/homeschooling.  All that time <br/>
away can really make a huge difference in the way people connect with each <br/>
other.  <br/>
<br/>
About what he&#39;ll miss:<br/>
Take him to the park for &quot;gym and recess&quot;, not because a bell rings, but <br/>
because he feels like running around!   Or how about community open gym time at <br/>
the Y or park district ( my community has it every week).  Ask him what he <br/>
enjoyed about music class and what he didn&#39;t, and remind him that he only &quot;has&quot; to <br/>
do what he likes, now!!  <br/>
<br/>
The transition may be tough but I would simply try to stay conscious and <br/>
aware of what&#39;s going on, with Fisher AND yourself,  deal with it as honestly as <br/>
you can as issues come up.  Remind yourself that he&#39;ll gradually get to a place <br/>
where he can relax and follow more natural rhythms of life, when he&#39;ll start <br/>
to truly experience and appreciate the freedom he&#39;s gained by taking him out <br/>
of school.  But, that doesn&#39;t happen automatically.  Check out some links about <br/>
deschooling, I think Sandra has one on her page.  <br/>
<br/>
 True freedom does take some getting used to, and there will be occassional <br/>
panic and questioning,  remind yourself it&#39;s part of the process and that <br/>
you&#39;ll get thru it.  I still go thru it sometimes and I&#39;ve unschooled for 9 years!  <br/>
I think of it as a way of reminding myself of what&#39;s truly important.   <br/>
That&#39;s never a bad thing.  ;-) <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure of your situation but it might be worthwhile, during the last <br/>
couple of days at the school, for your son to collect phone numbers and <br/>
contact info for his favorite friends there. Unless distance is an issue <br/>
there&#39;s no reason to cut your son off completely from his school friends. <br/>
They can still socialize on weekends, in late afternoons, etc. as the <br/>
situation permits.<br/>

he won&#39;t be cut off. I did this when I pulled my oldest out of 4th <br/>
grade - it was very comforting to my social butterfly child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882544458">Just hold onto your heart and try to relax.  Every transition in life has a <br/>
level of insecurity and uncertainty.  What a wonderful journey you are starting <br/>
with your child.  Just put one foot in front of the other and trust yourself <br/>
and your child. The fact that it is hard to say good bye to teachers shows <br/>
that you have a loving child who&#39;s good at building relationships, so good job to <br/>
you! I, just after four months of making this life style change drove by my <br/>
sons would be school and felt 100% sure that I made the right choice for our <br/>
family.  It takes time and try to remember that the JOY IS IN THE JOURNEY. Good <br/>
Luck to you.......Jenny<br/>
