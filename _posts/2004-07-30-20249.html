<div id="ygrps-yiv-186789799">-=-Thanks!  It was at LEAST 6 or 7 years ago when we first discussed  that on <br/>
AOL.  It was very profound for me and one of the things that most  helped me <br/>
on <br/>
my way to unschooling.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember which professor said it.  I think it was a philosophy class <br/>
and we were meeting outside.   It was a weird idea which i rejected.  She <br/>
didn&#39;t use the term &quot;model of the universe,&quot; but the idea that the universe exists <br/>
inside us was so strange to me that it bothered me that she had said it. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
So I carried it around like a rock in my shoe for a while.  And I was taking <br/>
a lot of educational psychology classes in those days, and literature (English <br/>
major) and I started to realize that I had the Bible in my head, and not only <br/>
the version I had been taught in Sunday schooll, but the one I had read <br/>
myself and pondered, and what I knew about the Catholic Bible and the differences, <br/>
and the history of the Bible, and traditions and superstitions about the Bible <br/>
(the black spot passage from Treasure Island), and translations (my friend&#39;s <br/>
dad had translated the New Testament into Tewa, the language of the pueblos on <br/>
either side of my home town).  I realized the the Bible in my head was HUGE.  <br/>
Bigger than a single real Bible.  <br/>
<br/>
And my head was filling up with other stories and characters and ideas (with <br/>
their histories and refutations) and maps and charts and relationships of <br/>
people real and current, dead, fictional...<br/>
<br/>
So in adding to that what I was reading about cognition and memory, I started <br/>
to see all that as building a model.    I still think about it.<br/>
<br/>
One long &quot;wonder&quot;/fantasy I had since I was nine or ten was the idea of <br/>
changing brains, or looking through someone else&#39;s eyes to see if the colors seemed <br/>
the same or other things seemed the same.   And I still think about that too, <br/>
sometimes.  Having kids stirred it up.   <br/>
<br/>
My dad saw things much in terms of construction.  He was always aware of <br/>
where water and sewer lines were, electrical lines, bearing walls, water walls.    <br/>
He saw the whole world that way, in terms of access and drainage and <br/>
stability.   I wouldn&#39;t have understood his sorting and analysis, from inside of him.  <br/>
 He wouldn&#39;t have understood my categorizing people sometimes by their place <br/>
of origin, their religion, their chosen/intended social goal/position.   He <br/>
didn&#39;t much care about that, though he could converse with me when I brought <br/>
things up.  He knew (but didn&#39;t much care &lt;g&gt;) that someone from Alabama was <br/>
going to react to a set of circumstances differently from someone from Oregon <br/>
would.   He has a Depression/WWII overlay on his world.   I didn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
So each person&#39;s perspective is unique.  But &quot;a unique perspective&quot; is a <br/>
teensier  concept than the idea that each person&#39;s model of the universe is <br/>
ever-growing and hugely elaborate, and each person sees THAT world, in a way.<br/>
<br/>
If people are interested in this, I want to talk about associations we have <br/>
with things (how they&#39;re connected or categorized), but if it&#39;s not to be an <br/>
ongoing topic that&#39;s fine too.  I&#39;ve written too much. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Sometimes I see connections that the people around me would never  see.  And <br/>
sometimes I think I&#39;m really goofy when I see them, and that I  couldn&#39;t <br/>
possibly defend them to my more rational and linear thinking  husband.  He thinks <br/>
I&#39;m goofy sometimes, too, but WORSE is that sometimes  he claims that those <br/>
connections don&#39;t exist.  <br/>
 <br/>
They do.  My mind races through them sometimes and I can&#39;t even  remember how <br/>
I got from uttering &quot;Jones Center&quot; to &quot;the new roof on the  studio.&quot;  But the <br/>
connections were there and I got &quot;here&quot; from &quot;there&quot; and  it made sense in my <br/>
mind and what does it matter that he can&#39;t get it?   From my point of view it <br/>
looks just right.<br/>
 <br/>
I love &quot;ever-growing and hugely elaborate&quot;. Such possibilities.<br/>

previous paragraph, I was pondering how I always seemed odd to my<br/>
friends when I said things like that (&quot;Do we all see the same colors<br/>
in the same way?&quot;) **or** things like, &quot;Do you ever wonder just how<br/>
many toilets there are in that square block of buildings over there?<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of flushing per square block.&quot;<br/>

Guess I fall somewhere on the philosophical spectrum between you and<br/>
your dad! :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the interesting perks of parenting my girls is how I learn<br/>
something and place it neatly (or not so neatly) into my inside map of<br/>
How The World Works... and it will often fit **right there** in that<br/>
spot because that&#39;s where it goes, because that information belongs on<br/>
that spot of my map.<br/>
<br/>
But I get great insight watching my girls take the same piece of<br/>
information, and place it on *their* maps in an entirely different<br/>
way, because their maps are young and fresh and not nearly as crowded<br/>
with earlier construction as mine is. And watching how they take<br/>
information and categorize it in a new and fresh way can teach me a<br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of a single example at the moment, which is frustrating,<br/>
because I&#39;m  an example person, not a theory person... but there was<br/>
something we were talking about last weekk, and I realized how<br/>
thoroughly used and jaded my paradigm was, and how refreshing it was<br/>
to see them pondering this info in a really new and fresh way. But<br/>
darned if I can remember what is was now :-(<br/>

I can relate!  Sometimes I think my brain is &quot;wired sideways&quot;, because I jump off on goofy side tangents most of the time.  I find bizarre humor in even the dullest situations. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Maybe our brains are &quot;loopy&quot;, that is connected in curly spiral paths instead of boring straight lines.<br/>

My husband does prefer to stick to one topic for more than 25 seconds, so I&#39;m trying to learn not to go down every branching side path in the conversation.<br/>

------------<br/>
<br/>
We play a game called &quot;Encore&quot; here, and have now played it so many times we <br/>
can tell what the game does from what the different groups of people to.  What <br/>
I mean is the first five times we played we thought &quot;with this group, it <br/>
plays like this,&quot; or &#39;with a bigger group it plays like this...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After maybe 20 sessions over the past eight or nine years, though, it started <br/>
showing its own self.    <br/>
<br/>
First, people get excited and all perked up.<br/>
<br/>
After half an hour they start to get frustrated and sludgy.<br/>
<br/>
Another half hour, and ideas aren&#39;t coming.  It&#39;s like an exhausting head <br/>
ache (not &quot;headache&quot; the traditional things, but like sore-muscles brain-tired.  <br/>
Trying to think but can&#39;t lift a synapse. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For the next day or two ideas keep coming unbidden.<br/>
<br/>
The game involves thinking of songs with a certain word, or songs in a <br/>
certain category.  Teams take turns singing at least eight words of the song <br/>
containing that phrase.<br/>
<br/>
People are FULL of song lyrics they can access, even non-singers.  TONS of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
But it seems that using this new search/scan method re-routes or stirs up <br/>
brain parts that have been quietly minding their own business, so it can make the <br/>
rest of the party different, more interesting, good conversation connections. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are dice and cards, and each card will have five words and a category, <br/>
like (thinking of things we did the last time, not quoting a single card)<br/>
<br/>
blue<br/>
sixteen<br/>
happy<br/>
wonder<br/>
train<br/>
seasons  (that last is &quot;category,&quot; so whatever the other team accepts is <br/>
fine--could be summer, spring, autumn, fall, winter, or &quot;in this season of my <br/>
life&quot; )<br/>
<br/>
We pulled &quot;Disney songs&quot; on 4th of July, and that could&#39;ve gone on for hours <br/>
by itself, so we called it a draw and got another card.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  Another thing the game does by itself is cause people to stop keeping <br/>
score after a while.  It&#39;s too fun and its so intrinsically entertaining that <br/>
everybody&#39;s winning.<br/>
<br/>
And it has very little to do with a model of the universe, but it&#39;s a little <br/>
like hooking your brain up to a diagnostic test that gives you an <br/>
incomprehensible printout.  And I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I totally enjoy stuff <br/>
like that!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
P.S. The game is out of print.  We heard another was coming out but I haven&#39;t <br/>
seen it yet.  And if you find  used one don&#39;t worry a bit if it&#39;s missing <br/>
parts.  All you need is some cards and dice.  We use a kitchen timer when/if we <br/>
bother to time turns at all.  The playing board is not much fun and we usually <br/>
leave it in the box.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some time ago, there was a short &quot;filler&quot; film on Discovery Channel (I<br/>
think) which showed a mouse swimming around in a tank of water, searching<br/>
for a platform in the tank where it could rest.  The experiment had to do<br/>
with learning; the mouse would be taken out and put right back in, over and<br/>
over.  The result was, with each repetition, it took more time, not less,<br/>
for the mouse to find the platform.  If they let the mouse rest outside the<br/>
tank for a period of time -- a half hour or 45 minutes, something like that<br/>
-- it found the platform much more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
According to the program, mice and men learn the same way -- we have<br/>
chemicals which &quot;fire&quot; in our brains as we learn, and when the chemicals are<br/>
depleted -- in a half hour or so -- we can&#39;t learn anymore.  We need to take<br/>
a break while the chemicals &quot;reset&quot; in the used-up pathways.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids and I play &quot;SET,&quot; one of us will be on fire for a few minutes,<br/>
then start failing to see any Sets; then someone else will find the most for<br/>
awhile.  <br/>
<br/>
The experiment suggested that classes which last 45 minutes and longer are<br/>
pretty much worthless -- that people learn in shorter sessions with long<br/>
rest periods.  <br/>

I don&#39;t think Name That Tune is on TV anymore, but that would be one  way!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
I know lyrics when I hear the music, or some other thing triggers a  <br/>
particular song, but I can&#39;t spontaneously spout lyrics, or jokes for that  matter.  I <br/>
would suck at Encore.  My son Jon can recite many lines  from TV, movies, <br/>
songs, lots and lots of jokes.  If you give him a noun he  can recall a line <br/>
relating to it.  My filing system is different.  I  am amazed at his ability.  <br/>
