<div id="ygrps-yiv-714986731"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am now reading John<br/>
&gt;Holts books and they<br/>
&gt;just reinforce everything I knew in my heart and logical mind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey! Do those books belong to you? Cuz I&#39;ll buy &#39;em off you when you&#39;re<br/>
done with them! I am having a very difficult time trying to get his books<br/>
through the library. All copies are ALWAYS checked out. I have my name on<br/>
the list for one, and I hope to get it in a few days. I checked Amazon.com,<br/>
but some are on backorder and might be shipped in 3-5 weeks.  Some aren&#39;t<br/>
even being printed anymore! I was hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to buy them new.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any of his books and would be willing to lend them to me, I<br/>
will pay for shipping to/from, and I will treat them as if my life depended<br/>
on it!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone? (sniff, sniff)<br/>
