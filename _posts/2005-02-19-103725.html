<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017702570">Hi... well, I wound up having more time on my hands then I planned <br/>
on for the computer today. I have to tell you guys, if you do have <br/>
your children take that video game design course through The <br/>
Learning Community Group... it takes forever to load the lessons if <br/>
you&#39;re dial up! My son is outside with his buddy waiting for the <br/>
lesson to load! It takes a whole hour. So... if you have DSL, it <br/>
will run a lot faster until they change their program. Poor kid gets <br/>
so frustrated with it.<br/>
<br/>
To address taking things personally... Sorry if it sounds that way. <br/>
I tend to write that way and I don&#39;t mean to cause any distress by <br/>
it. I write from my vantage point and sometimes I have difficulty <br/>
writing to a group in a more general tone. Sorry about that. I have <br/>
to work on getting out the kinks. But honestly, I wasn&#39;t taking <br/>
things personally, just passionately. Do you know what I mean? Sorry <br/>
if it came out otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have trouble writing in between the paragraphs of the post. <br/>
Someone from the list contacted me saying it was difficult reading <br/>
my posts because the markings were not clear in which were mine and <br/>
that of others, I believe that is what she meant. I&#39;m going to try <br/>
to write between paragraphs, I hope it works. Cross your fingers. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Glad things went well for you, Susan - or at least that you didn&#39;t <br/>
have<br/>
to stay overnight.<br/>
<br/>
***Thanks. Lots of pokes and prods. I hate that... but at least I&#39;m <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want to suggest to you that you take another deep breath (I&#39;m sure<br/>
you&#39;ve taken a few already &lt;g&gt;) and be really careful to not take<br/>
anything said here in a personal way. You&#39;re NOT debating about <br/>
whether<br/>
YOU are doing the right thing - nobody knows you, your life, your<br/>
personality, your family, your style, etc. The debates are all about<br/>
ideas - the &quot;idea&quot; of restricting television, the idea of an adult <br/>
and<br/>
a child making a joint decision to limit something, the idea of &quot;not<br/>
teaching,&quot; and so on.<br/>
<br/>
The end of a discussion here can easily be - &quot;Well, this was a good<br/>
discussion and I think I have a better understanding of what others<br/>
think about this.&quot; Or it could be, &quot;This has helped me gain a deeper<br/>
understanding of my own reasons for my decision.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The end result of a discussion here does not need to be: &quot;Ah, you&#39;re<br/>
right and I&#39;m going to change my ways.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*** Yes, I do realize this. I think that the debates are very <br/>
cathartic. They do help me see things from different angles and to <br/>
really think about what other folks have said. I think they are <br/>
thought provoking and electric. And yes, I do have gained <br/>
understanding in what other folks think about this topic. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The goal is analytical - it is to dig down deep into the ideas we <br/>
hold<br/>
and think about the basis of those ideas.<br/>
<br/>
It truly isn&#39;t really to persuade you to change your mind as much as <br/>
it<br/>
is to provide a forum where you can, if you desire, stretch and open<br/>
and try on thinking things in ways you haven&#39;t done.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra used to have a talk she gave in which she told people they<br/>
should spend some time thinking dangerous thoughts. Think about <br/>
things<br/>
in ways you don&#39;t usually. Let yourself be willing to think <br/>
anything -<br/>
don&#39;t push any thought away, follow it, no matter what. She used to <br/>
say<br/>
if it was too scary, that you could duct tape yourself to a chair and<br/>
get somebody to act as a spotter - I really liked that image. But,<br/>
really, just thinking dangerous thoughts isn&#39;t dangerous - you can<br/>
think them and go on with life as is - you don&#39;t have to act on them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***I agree. Sometimes it is very frightening and I think that&#39;s why <br/>
I like this group so much... because it pushes that in me. It does <br/>
cause some uncomfortableness that is needed for change. It&#39;s the <br/>
beginning of growth. I was in a class that taught this through a <br/>
church I was in a few years back. They would bring up &quot;hot topics&quot; <br/>
and everyone would get into these discussions. Man, did the heat <br/>
rise in this class. It was amazing. You would think everyone was <br/>
just each other&#39;s enemies because we&#39;d all get so far into it it <br/>
seemed as if everyone was ticked off at each other. When it was <br/>
done, we would talk, go out for a bite to eat, laugh and go home. A <br/>
lot of times, we never knew what the other person had learned or <br/>
thought about the group in the end... but one thing was for certain, <br/>
we all grew a little.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a list for pushing ourselves to think dangerous thoughts - <br/>
and<br/>
it can be uncomfortable and scary and the WORST is when somebody <br/>
really<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to, but they find themselves here being pushed to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Back then, I sat down with the purpose of just thinking dangerous<br/>
thoughts for a while. I mean, I actually took time and sat in a chair<br/>
just to sort of make myself think. For me, thinking dangerous <br/>
thoughts<br/>
worked like this: I&#39;d think, &quot;Well, what if it is true that tv is<br/>
addicting and if I don&#39;t control them they&#39;ll be addicted and they&#39;ll<br/>
be couch potatoes and they&#39;ll all get fat and lazy and will be<br/>
depressed with no friends and never find a spouse and not get married<br/>
and I&#39;ll have no grandchildren.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or - &quot;Well, what if tv is addicting and I control it and they don&#39;t<br/>
learn to control it themselves and then when they grow up and have<br/>
their own place they get a tv and they just sit and watch all the <br/>
time<br/>
and don&#39;t study for their college classes and can&#39;t graduate and<br/>
they&#39;re stuck in lousy jobs that they hate and they&#39;re miserable and<br/>
they blame me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These are the kinds of trains of thought that I let myself think - <br/>
kind<br/>
of had to make myself think - because I naturally tended to think in<br/>
mind-ruts - my mind just would go where it had always gone before - <br/>
so<br/>
I had to make myself take different turns and see where those went.<br/>
<br/>
So - here on this list - we&#39;re doing it together - in writing - with<br/>
1600+ strangers watching. Gosh, does this make anybody nervous? It is<br/>
sort of the amazing power of the internet that we can exchange ideas <br/>
in<br/>
such a public way and yet keep our privacy at the same time. Cool for<br/>
some. Too freaky for others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***And how do you balance that? The public/private? Too little <br/>
information doesn&#39;t let people know what is going on behind your <br/>
thinking... too much information may be deemed to personal or too <br/>
dangerous in revealing who you are. How do you balance that? How do <br/>
you take those steps to secure yourself and yet enter into contact <br/>
with others that contains meaningful conversation? <br/>
<br/>
That is something I&#39;d be interested in learning... how do you all <br/>
balance that out?<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Good Will ;-) <br/>
