<div id="ygrps-yiv-226832509"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;The other two families, when there was a problem, the kids went to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other adults, or they covered over, or they lied, or they ran and hid.<br/>
Their parents were not on their team.  They were likely to be banished<br/>
to the car until the playtime was over if they didn&#39;t &quot;get along&quot; as though<br/>
&quot;get along&quot; was a simple command to be followed.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why people expect children to just listen to verbal<br/>
directions/commands etc. I think it&#39;s an unconscious expression (I<br/>
hope it&#39;s unconscious) of how inconvenienced they feel by children. As<br/>
if programming children with the right set(s) of commands would bring<br/>
about the desired behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think most people realize how it is for the children.<br/>
Knowledge of a command is not the same as understanding what it means.<br/>
Many people think that language is understanding, that words are<br/>
enough. It takes more.<br/>
<br/>
And on top of that, top-down directions, guidance and commands leave<br/>
out other factors that play an important part in all this: what the<br/>
child wants. Communication is not a one-way street. The thing I want<br/>
to convey is that what Karl feels matters to me, not to tell him what<br/>
he &quot;should&quot; be or what he &quot;should&quot; do. I want to continue talking on<br/>
the side (not in front of others or to embarrass him surely) about how<br/>
others in the situation might be feeling. I want him to get the idea,<br/>
over time, that people count. And that includes him. Without<br/>
considering what&#39;s going on with children, it&#39;s probably impossible to<br/>
get those kinds of things across. We can say the words all day long<br/>
and it won&#39;t mean what we want it to without the accompanying behavior<br/>
from ourselves to match the words.<br/>
<br/>
Knowledge of words ≠ Understanding of ideas<br/>
