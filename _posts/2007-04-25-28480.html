<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296343260">There will always be someone who isn&#39;t &#39;okay&#39; with your choice to UNschool.  Don&#39;t let it phase you.  When you hit public school age with your kidlets and you send in your intent to homeschool, put only what&#39;s necessary on the form (e-mail me if you&#39;d like a copy of the one we use for Justin) and don&#39;t even bother to mention UNschooling...it&#39;s widely underrated and misunderstood.  <br/>
<br/>
Be patient, educate others.  If it becomes completely stressful or annoying think of a one-line sentence that you can say, politely, to mind your own business. :)  <br/>

I used to say &quot;We&#39;re really liking it now.  If we decide it&#39;s not  <br/>
working, we can put him in school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It shut them up and gave them hope (which was never realized &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine just a couple of months ago said she used to think I  <br/>
had no idea what I was doing and that I was ruining my kids, but she  <br/>
knows them (has always known them) and said she&#39;s amazed.  And I  <br/>
talked to her about unschooling for hours, and I know it&#39;s not going  <br/>
to happen at her house, but she did finally ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676927790">Thank you to everyone who has responded! I am so happy that I found<br/>
this group and Sandra&#39;s website! I can&#39;t wait until I have time to<br/>
read through everything. <br/>
<br/>
I also found a group of unschoolers in my area who meet for a park<br/>
day, so that should be a good start to making new friends and learning<br/>
new things. I really like the ideas about having a one-liner handy, I<br/>
will have to think one up. I have so much to learn, but I think we are<br/>
doing okay so far. My husband and I have great ideas about how to make<br/>
things accessible to our children. My husband does graphic design, so<br/>
we have been designing this artwork for the kids rooms formed by<br/>
letters of the English alphabet, and when we are through with that we<br/>
are going to do letters of the greek alphabet. I&#39;m really excited<br/>
about that project! <br/>
<br/>
I guess the best example of hostility towards unschooling and the<br/>
reason why I am resolving to unschool would be from a good friend of<br/>
ours. She is a teacher at a local charter school that works with<br/>
homeschooling families. I had always looked up to her as this great<br/>
bastion of knowledge and read all the books that she told me to read<br/>
about learning. These included &quot;The Well Trained Mind&quot; and &quot;Reading in<br/>
100 Easy Lessons.&quot; I was all set to start Karlos (3.75) on the lessons<br/>
at aged 3, but then John Holt&#39;s books gave me pause and I decided to<br/>
unschool instead. When I stated my intention to said friend, she<br/>
looked at me like I was crazy. I thought she of all people would be<br/>
supportive, but instead she told me about how all of the unschooling<br/>
families she knows are so far behind in school and she thought that<br/>
was ridiculous. This was told to me after she had just finished<br/>
talking to one of our friend&#39;s children who is in her charter school.<br/>
The conversation went as follows with A being the teacher and E the child.<br/>
<br/>
E- can I show you my math lesson I did today?<br/>
A- Sure, let me see what you&#39;ve got.<br/>
E proceeds to open math curriculum booklet which he has just begun<br/>
A- No, you opened it to that back, that&#39;s the hard stuff, we&#39;ll get to<br/>
that eventually, show me the front where you are.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think when E gets to the back of the book that he will have a<br/>
defeatist attitude or not? After all, that&#39;s the &quot;hard stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all so much for reminding me that we are making the right<br/>
choice and to not worry about what others think or say. It has really<br/>
meant a lot.</div>
