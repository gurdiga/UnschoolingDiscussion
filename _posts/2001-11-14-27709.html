<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951232514">Google.com for excema and stress yields lots.<br/>
<br/>
Excerpts:<br/>
--------<br/>
<br/>
If this high stress continues, physical symptoms can result. Excema, asthma, <br/>
psoriasis, irritable bowel syndrome, migraine headaches, stomach ulcers, <br/>
certain kinds of arthritis, and other illnesses are now considered to be <br/>
potential results of high stress.<br/>
<br/>
Happily, a person can easily be taught to re-learn the ability to relax <br/>
properly, even though (s)he may have been trying to keep going with high <br/>
stress levels for many years. More and more of those who need to be able to <br/>
perform excellently - professional business and sports people for example - <br/>
regard stress management work as an absolutely essential part of continuing <br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
[in commentary on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]<br/>
<br/>
Other significant risk factors included a<br/>
history of premenstrual syndrome, a history of excema, loss of interest<br/>
in daily activities, and panic attacks. Our results suggest that stress<br/>
may be one of the factors related to the development of CFS.<br/>
<br/>
--------------<br/>
1. Body heals within outwards e.g. asthma improves so excema comes out<br/>
2. Dis-ease symptoms improve head down - Physical e.g. excema improves at <br/>
head first then moves down to feet. Mental - feel better<br/>
3. From major organs to lesser. So skin becomes the saviour of the internal <br/>
organs. It takes on the reaction rather than perhaps the lungs which may <br/>
become damaged if too much stress is put on them.<br/>
4. Retrace dis-ease back to starting point. Symptoms disappear or reappear to <br/>
their first appearance. [e.g. asthma after childhood excema] Sometimes one <br/>
must go back to a childhood experience or trauma.<br/>
--------------<br/>
Not a quote, Sandra: <br/>
On supplements there&#39;s a fair amount of commentary too: <br/>
 &quot;many people suffering from eczema often have an essential fatty acid <br/>
deficiency,&quot;<br/>
and zinc was discussed (internal, although topical used to be the favored <br/>
treatment years ago and cortizone is more common now).<br/>
<br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
From a new age page:<br/>
<br/>
Reiki is also of great assistance for skin disorders especially when the <br/>
person is under a great deal of stress.  Reiki assists when there is a <br/>
digestive/elimination disorder by allowing the person to once again confront <br/>
issues/feelings they may have been, or are experiencing.  For instance if our <br/>
digestive/elimination system is not working efficiently this can affect our <br/>
overall health – including the skin.  We digest our emotions as well as our <br/>
food!  Likewise constipation can be a result of emotionally not letting go. <br/>
<br/>
Eczema can be a result of irritation the person is feeling – perhaps to <br/>
another, yet they have not expressed this feeling.  Acne indicates feelings <br/>
of shame, fear, or strong feelings that are not expressed – trying to get <br/>
out.  Those people who are very sensitive by nature can often have sensitive <br/>
skins. <br/>
____________<br/>
<br/>
So in families in which stress from school or other factors has kids keyed <br/>
up, adding stress about the symptoms won&#39;t help.  I was blamed for my excema, <br/>
and was limited in foods (it never helped once, but my mom followed doctor&#39;s <br/>
orders anyway without any evidence of success), in what I could wear (which <br/>
is fine--cotton instead of the then-popular nylon), in what I could take a <br/>
bath in (bath oil instead of soap, which is comfortable but not all that <br/>
helpful with skin problems in the desert!!).  Being told if I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
scratch it it would go away never helped.  It was as if I was allergic to my <br/>
own sweat when I was stressed, and the stresses in my life caused sweatiness, <br/>
and I&#39;d break out.<br/>
<br/>
Dietary considerations are great as concerns general health and digestion, <br/>
but just to identify a culprit and eliminate it completely and dramatically <br/>
as though it&#39;s the one magic switch is not the same as general health, and I <br/>
know this from experience.<br/>
<br/>
When I moved away from my parents, I rarely had excema again (finals time at <br/>
college would trigger it).  So either I grew out of it or I moved away from <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
None of my kids have had any.  <br/>

I am ROTFL thinking about these studies in relation to my son......I guess<br/>
being a fourth child,  and a boy with THREE big sisters cause much anxiety<br/>
in the little guy!<br/>
