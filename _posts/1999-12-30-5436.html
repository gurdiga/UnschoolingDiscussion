<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248409092">I also used &quot;Toilet training in less than a day&quot; on 6 kids so far. including<br/>
twins. No scolding, pressure etc. It did work in less than a day. With the<br/>
exception of my highstrung dd who I tried again 2 months later and was fine.<br/>
I probably waited too long to do her in the first place.<br/>
    I mentioned it was time to try and potty train my 19 month ds to some<br/>
casual friends and they snickered. The next week at church, they were<br/>
baffled.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with showing the way and<br/>
allowing opportunity. A sense of accomplishment  is also good for the very<br/>
young. Success breeds success. my 2 cents.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree wholeheartedly with this statement.  Also, my children were in<br/>
cloth diapers and it was much easier to potty train them.  They knew what<br/>
it felt like when they were wet.  With disposables, IMHO, they can&#39;t feel<br/>
the wetness when they go.  It takes longer to make the connection.  Pull<br/>
Ups are horrible to use when potty training for just this reason.  I got a<br/>
book, recommended by my wonderful pediatrician, called _Potty Training In<br/>
Less than a Day_ or something like that.  He said don&#39;t expect to do it in<br/>
a day but use the tips in the book.  All of my children were potty trained<br/>
at 20 months(I have 5).  It was realitively easy and non stressful for<br/>
them.  I must admit the hardest part with the younger ones was having the<br/>
time at home to practice.  We carried the potty chair in the back of the<br/>
van for my 4th child.  Hey, it worked!!!!!<br/>
