What<br/>
a<br/>
bitch.<br/>
<br/>
She can&#39;t stay up a little late to talk to her own DAUGHTER!?<br/>
<br/>
What about when Noelle wants to go on dates?   Will her mom never wait up for <br/>
her?   Will she make her be home before her mom&#39;s bedtime?<br/>
<br/>
Were these people just not planning to have children so they&#39;re treating her <br/>
badly for being alive!?!?<br/>
<br/>
She would make her (AND YOU) go through an additional 24 hours of YOUR <br/>
uncomfortable lives rather than set an alarm and wake up long enough to talk to her <br/>
own daughter?<br/>

Not really.   You&#39;ll probably be getting updates from Noelle and her parents <br/>
for years to come. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Please share!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602199682">I was thinking she might LOVE to be invited back and get to choose to <br/>
come or not. Might behave entirely differently next time. Is it too far <br/>
for her to come for just a few days?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Funny you should say that--I have another sister-in-law who has been <br/>
telling me for years that Noelle&#39;s parents should have never had <br/>
children.  I never said anything because I had not experienced what <br/>
my other SIL had--of course I called this SIL and told her that now <br/>
I see what she means.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, can you even believe that? <br/>
<br/>
 Noelle&#39;s mother is a nurse and has also forbidden Noelle from <br/>
calling her at work.  I asked why and Noelle said it was because <br/>
Noelle called her one time to ask where something was at home and <br/>
this made her mother angry.  She won&#39;t even answer her calls.  My <br/>
question is:  what if there is an emergency?  Once, school was <br/>
closed early because of ice and snow and Noelle made her way home <br/>
and didn&#39;t call anyone (or maybe they wouldn&#39;t take her calls?!) and <br/>
her parents were surprised to find her at home alone when they got <br/>
there.  I think she was 11 or 12.<br/>
