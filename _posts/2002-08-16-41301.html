Your words here are sooo up lifting.<br/>
You just gave advise to a new unschooler about the elephant in the middle of <br/>
the living room.<br/>
Could you send that email to me privately, as I want to print it off and <br/>
don&#39;t know how to do that on a long list of email letters...(Okay, so I am <br/>
not into attempting to figure it out either, sorry... easier to ask you..:-)<br/>
<br/>
Let me know and thanks!<br/>
