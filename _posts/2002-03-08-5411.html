<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883749857">&lt;&lt;You mean she just plays all day&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes.  BJU is a favorite in this neck of the woods as well.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane (11) told one of the school-at-home moms that she just watches<br/>
television all day (Adriane loves the look on their faces) a couple of weeks<br/>
ago.  To which the mom gasped &quot;YOU DO NOT?!?!&quot; and looked at me.  I said<br/>
that the kids watch what they want when they want, sometimes that is all<br/>
day, sometimes it is not at all.  Then the mom told Adriane that she is very<br/>
particular about what her children are exposed to, nothing magic, no fairies<br/>
or goblins or witches....something about these things being abominations to<br/>
God or some such rot.<br/>
<br/>
The mom said she just this year let her kids (10 and 9) watch &quot;The Wizard of<br/>
Oz&quot; and that she sat right next to them, informing the kids of God&#39;s alleged<br/>
views on the subject.  To which Adriane responded &quot;YOU DID NOT?!?!?&quot;<br/>

A little girl who used to come play with Dylan informed us she couldn&#39;t<br/>
come any more because we had demons in our house.  She was talking about<br/>
the Pokemon comic book Dylan got from a pen pal in Japan.  She said it<br/>
even had demon words.  ( it&#39;s in Japanese )      Mom&#39;s orders.    It just<br/>
seems so silly.<br/>

What Shakespearean characters might a good Christian family allow?<br/>
<br/>
The only people afraid of fairies and witches are Christians.  The only <br/>
people who believe Satan is hiding around the corner are Christians.  The <br/>
only people who seem to believe that some cartoon lion actually summoned the <br/>
spirit of his dead cartoon-lion father are Christians (who would also be <br/>
quick to tell you that lions don&#39;t HAVE spirits).    And they claim ownership <br/>
of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And they SEVERELY limit what their children are exposed to.<br/>
<br/>
It just makes me sick.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re worried about what kids like mine will be like when they&#39;re grown and <br/>
in society.  I worry about theirs.  Some will have whatever it takes to cling <br/>
to the blindness.  Others will be set loose like an arrow from a 60 lb bow <br/>
and go as far from their raising as they can.  I wouldn&#39;t be keen to live <br/>
next door to either one of those.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m reading a *fascinating* recovery book (as in 12-step recovery) called<br/>
&quot;Never Good Enough.&quot;  It&#39;s about the results of raising kids in extremely<br/>
religious families, and how codependents (usually adult children of<br/>
alcoholic or dysfunctional families) can, instead of turning to drugs or<br/>
booze, turn to &quot;clean&quot; addictions like workaholism or CHURCHaholism.  Going<br/>
to church can be as mood-altering as tequilla shots, but it&#39;s unassailable:<br/>
who could possibly fault someone for being pious and faithful?<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve finally figured out what my addiction is ;-/<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d be interested in what his definition of &quot;good literature&quot; is then.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s no more &quot;good literature&quot; than there is &quot;good music.&quot;  <br/>
There&#39;s literature that gets awards, that sells a lot, that lasts 200 years, <br/>
that changes lives, and yet an one piece of literature will be loved by some <br/>
and hated by some.   I like some music that others hate.  So it goes.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure Shakespeare fans would be able to defend their affection for at <br/>
least some of the stuff.  (I could do without sonnets totally, and Corialanus <br/>
was a big drag.)  I hope he would be able to defend his own definition of <br/>
&quot;good.&quot;<br/>

Eeek.<br/>
Both depressing and about race/ethnicity.<br/>

I was at the car wash this evening with Holly and the dog, getting gallons of <br/>
water.  There was a young man and his son, washing a NICE new sporty car.  I <br/>
was thinking in a (perhaps) prejudiced way how long that father/son <br/>
relationship was going to last.  Then I thought that I should be ashamed of <br/>
myself, and then I thought &quot;Five years, tops.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
THEN I thought &quot;But maybe they go to church...&quot;   And I think if the choices <br/>
are drugs/alcohol/partying  or  church, church is the lesser of two evils.<br/>
<br/>
And I thought of how many people are unaware that there is any life betwen <br/>
those two extremes.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember, when I was young and fervently Baptist, thinking that people who <br/>
stayed home instead of went to church must really be frightening people, <br/>
commiting ALL the sins they could think of, because they didn&#39;t have Jesus to <br/>
save them from themselves.  Why not sin away if you didn&#39;t believe in hell <br/>
anyway?  Just sin, sin, sin.  Drink and dance.  FORNicate.<br/>

A mom asks her son what he learned in Sunday school.  He says that the<br/>
Egyptian army was chasing the Israelis.  When they got to the Red Sea,<br/>
the Israelis had ships waiting to transport their personnel and called in<br/>
 airstrikes on the Egyptian positions.  The Israelis successfully evac-ed<br/>
their civilians and the counterstrikes from above wiped out the Egyptian<br/>
high command.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is that really what they taught you?&quot; asks the befuddled mom.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No,&quot; the kid replies, &quot;But if I told you what they really told me, you&#39;d<br/>
never believe it.&quot;<br/>
