<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889893249">Last night late Holly was hanging around where I was filing old  <br/>
correspondence and papers (really old, some of it) and in filing an  <br/>
on-paper chain letter, it went next to a folder I started in college  <br/>
called &quot;Texas talk.&quot;  One of the phrases I had noted my older  <br/>
relatives using was &quot;lookie here&quot;  (who knows how it would be spelled— <br/>
it was never written down).   I had made a note there that it was  <br/>
from &quot;look ye here,&quot; and I&#39;m sure it is a long-forgotten contraction  <br/>
of that, especially in &quot;y&#39;all&quot; land (ye all is a much better origin  <br/>
than &quot;you all&quot; which is used in more formal situations &lt;bwg&gt;).    So  <br/>
anyway, it was at the tip of my brain and I used it.  But it reminds  <br/>
me about something I quoted here:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/learning">http://sandradodd.com/learning</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
about silent e, and I&#39;ll come back about silent e.   Please read that  <br/>
(it&#39;s short) and if any of you have stories of something you or your  <br/>
kids learned that only took a second or two and you can remember  <br/>
thinking &quot;wow, that&#39;s all?&quot; or anything like that, I&#39;d really like to  <br/>
have it for that page.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not the good part.  The good part is that although the top  <br/>
needs work, I LOVE the way the bottom came out and I hope never to   <br/>
touch it but leave it just like that.<br/>
<br/>
The page is new this morning—new an hour ago.  Please check it out.<br/>

Okay!  It&#39;s not great.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great on my Mac G5 using Safari.<br/>
<br/>
On Kirby&#39;s and Marty&#39;s computers using Windows something 95 or 2000  <br/>
or who knows what it&#39;s messier.  The links work, but some things  <br/>
aren&#39;t cool and one thing doesn&#39;t appear at all.  I&#39;ll mess with it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So about silent &quot;e&quot;...<br/>
Skip the next two paragraphs if you want to.  (Skip it all; I&#39;ll  <br/>
never know, but &quot;very best part&quot; part is the best part.)<br/>
<br/>
As with every other single letter in native English words, it was  <br/>
once pronounced.  The more we say a word, the mushier and shorter and  <br/>
&quot;flatter&quot; it gets, over the centuries.  Final vowels turn to a low-in- <br/>
the-mouth &quot;uh&quot; sound, but the vowel *before* the final vowel is  <br/>
pronounced clearly (generally, in English words).<br/>
<br/>
So the word for the female mom-horse used to go &quot;MAYruh but now it  <br/>
flattened out to a little shorter &quot;a&quot; and a don&#39;t-bother &quot;uh.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Mar,&quot; meanwhile, had a short a always.  E&#39;s weren&#39;t put on to &quot;make  <br/>
the vowel long,&quot; they&#39;re left over from when they gave the vowel more  <br/>
punch in the days they were pronounced, 600 years and more ago.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the very best part:   In school they told us that an  <br/>
apostrophe in a contraction indicates that letters were left out.   <br/>
Well surprise!  The apostrophes in posessives show that letters were  <br/>
left out too, because even after the silent e&#39;s became more silent,  <br/>
sometimes it was pronounced in a possessive.  But the way to indicate  <br/>
a possessive was to put an &quot;es&quot; sound at the end of a word.  Not &quot;an  <br/>
s,&quot; but the sound (even before spelling and writing were part of  <br/>
English) &quot;es.&quot;  So if that sound is going to be mostly left off (the  <br/>
vocalized &quot;e&quot; part), they just put &#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It just occurred to me to wonder (I&#39;m not in a hurry to find out, but  <br/>
if any of you happen to know or to be in a hurry to think it through  <br/>
or look it up) whether all or most of the &quot;silent e&quot; words, which are  <br/>
pretty much four letter words from Old English that go consonant- <br/>
vowel-consonant-silent e are nouns and adjectives.  I&#39;m thinking  <br/>
they&#39;re all nouns and adjectives, because the endings that went on  <br/>
verbs were different than the endings of nouns.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when people are writing for Rennfaire menus or for some  <br/>
reason Being Fake-Medieval and writing junk like &quot;Ye Olde Soup Potte&quot;  <br/>
or whatever, they end up putting &quot;e&quot; on words for which it makes no  <br/>
sense whatsoever.  And you all know that although there was a  <br/>
&quot;ye&quot; (form of 2nd person pronoun) that the &quot;Ye&quot; as &quot;The&quot; came about  <br/>
because the mark for &quot;TH&quot; (a combined letter at one time, called a  <br/>
thorn) looked like a y to people who didn&#39;t know what it was?  It&#39;s  <br/>
kind of a pointy backwards p, or a &quot;less than&quot; mark with a vertical  <br/>
line that cuts through the pointy ends a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TOO much history of English.  Sorry.<br/>
I did spare you any mention of declensions.<br/>
[DOH!!!]<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         I haven&#39;t introduced ourselves yet so I&#39;ll do it first then I<br/>
have a good story for this subject.  My name is Colleen, I&#39;ve been<br/>
married to Rusty for 21yrs. come this Oct., we have two dd&#39;s, Sami<br/>
almost 13 and Madi almost 4.  We have always &quot;unschooled&quot; even when I<br/>
didn&#39;t have a name for it. We just did what &#39;felt&#39; right and natural and<br/>
didn&#39;t cause conflicts.  Sami was very easy going and agreeable back<br/>
then (not as much now at 13)&lt;g&gt; so parenting was quite easy.  Since Madi<br/>
was born, parenting has been a bit more challenging since she has a<br/>
strong sense of what she wants and we have had to reassess our parenting<br/>
and go with a more gentle &#39;hands off&#39; approach.<br/>
<br/>
           Anyways to get to the point of why I am posting, when Sami was<br/>
about 8yrs. old she was heating up two pieces of pizza in the microwave,<br/>
she knew that one piece took 1min. so she asked me if 2 pieces takes 2<br/>
min. and I said yes probably.  She then asked me how many seconds are in<br/>
2min., she knew there was 60 seconds in 1min., I then got paper and<br/>
pencil and showed her how to add 60 + 60, she got it right away, it<br/>
literally took seconds.  She then asked me to make up a whole page of<br/>
double and triple digit addition questions so she could do them after<br/>
she ate her pizza, she has loved &#39;math&#39; ever since!!!!  There is also so<br/>
much &#39;math&#39; in the analog clock.  When Sami was about 4-5 we made sure<br/>
that most of the clocks in the house were analog with numbers and there<br/>
were many many conversations about fractions and counting by 5&#39;s and<br/>
10&#39;s, etc.<br/>
<br/>
              When Sami learned to read it took a little longer than a<br/>
few seconds, it took about 2 weeks.  She was 8yrs. old and she was<br/>
playing a Pokemon video game (her favorite still to this day) and she<br/>
kept calling me in the living room to read to her what the game said,<br/>
after many times of leaving the kitchen to read to her I got a little<br/>
frusterated and said to her I can&#39;t keep coming in and reading to you<br/>
right now or I&#39;ll never get dinner ready and proceeded to tell her if<br/>
she wanted to learn to read she should just learn, and she knew she<br/>
could when &#39;she&#39; decided to.  Well in less than 2 weeks she went from<br/>
recognizing a few words to reading chapter books. I&#39;m guessing the<br/>
motivation to read her video game helped alot.<br/>
<br/>
                I truly, honestly believe that a child can learn whatever<br/>
they want to learn when &#39;they&#39; want to learn it and not before.  I feel<br/>
the hardest thing about unschooling is NOT listening to the negative<br/>
comments and just living our life the way we feel is right for us.<br/>
<br/>
                 Thanks for listening<br/>
<br/>
                  Colleen & Rusty, Sami (12) & Madi (3)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689319469">love your story Colleen, I am so glad to be reminded<br/>
that we don&#39;t always have to drill our children.  I<br/>
have a 7yo that &quot;I&quot; believe refuses to learn to read,<br/>
enjoys most other things, math via cooking and games,<br/>
science.  But does not have the ability, it would<br/>
seem, to memorize even one sound.  But I do notice he<br/>
attempts to memorize the whole word, so many Dolch is<br/>
the way to go with him.  <br/>
But it has been hard sometimes, he went to a summer<br/>
camp one of the teachers just stayed on him at 6yo<br/>
that he could not read, even telling him tell your<br/>
mother to read to you more.   Little does he<br/>
know.....it is nice to be reminded that when their<br/>
brain is open to it, they wil do it.<br/>

<br/>
It takes more than wanting to learn something, though.  Many children  <br/>
want to read or ride a bike before they have all of the several  <br/>
abilities required to do it.  If you find other things for them to do  <br/>
while those skills and cognitive abilities are developing, they can  <br/>
be happy and successful all the time instead of ever being failures.<br/>

Seven is really young.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Memorizing sounds&quot; isn&#39;t the way to learn to read, so don&#39;t press  <br/>
that.  Spend your time other, better ways.<br/>
<br/>
Dolch might be the way you decide to go, but it&#39;s not a good topic  <br/>
for this list.  Here are lots of unschooling reading accounts  <br/>
collected over the years that might help you appreciate what he IS  <br/>
doing instead of what he&#39;s not doing.<br/>
