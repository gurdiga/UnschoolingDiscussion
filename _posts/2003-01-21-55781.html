&lt;&lt; My kids love Harry Potter, watch Pokemon every night at 9 on Cartoon<br/>
 Network, and are busily learning Elvish these days as a result of our<br/>
 current obsession with LOTR.  I don&#39;t give a flying fig whether JK Rowling<br/>
 is a Christian or a Pagan, or an Atheist.  She&#39;s a damn fine author and her<br/>
 books have my 11 year old reading like there&#39;s no tomorrow.  And yes, I&#39;ve<br/>
 had all of the hellfire and brimstone warnings about my children&#39;s certain<br/>
 descent into witchcraft and all things horrible because of HP.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;ll fit in just fine judging by this post!! grins<br/>
<br/>
I think the annoyed attitude about Christians is more about the condemning <br/>
fearful ones that want you as far away from their children as possible <br/>
because you allow those things.<br/>
This list is actually very inclusive (unless you try to promote spanking or <br/>
school, lol) and represents many different belief systems.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Anytime<br/>
 an entire group of people *think* the same thing, there is no thinking at<br/>
 all, imo. I have come to the belief that a vast majority of people like<br/>
 to be indoctrinated. It releases them of all responsibility and reason. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes!! I SO agree with you on this Wende.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ll admit it, we spanked. But with the thoughts and insights of the <br/>
wonderful women on this list our home has been spank free. And I&#39;ll tell you, <br/>
it&#39;s wonderful, to see joy, happiness, and love in my childrens eyes instead <br/>
of fear, it&#39;s one of the best feelings in the world. (And to tell the truth, <br/>
I hadn&#39;t even noticed the fear, until it was gone and I am sad that I was the <br/>
one to put it there, but it is gone now and hopefully I will never have to <br/>
see it again.)<br/>

This is so good to read Rebecca..I am always a bit envious of someone that <br/>
can quit the spanking thing &quot;cold turkey&quot; since it was such a struggle for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for speaking up.<br/>

Unfortunately, we did spank off and on (mostly off) for the first <br/>
several years of parenting. It has never worked for us. But we <br/>
were repeatedly convinced that we must use it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we don&#39;t and it&#39;s great to feel fine about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I need to say this...<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t spank because they&#39;re conservative Christian; they spank <br/>
because they haven&#39;t learned to manage their anger and frustration in <br/>
a healthy manner.  This is true of liberals, conservative, Muslims, <br/>
Jews, Buddhists, atheists, pagans and Christians.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to spank a child; it will not make him obey you, <br/>
but it will make him fear you.  It will not make her respect you, but <br/>
she will resent you.<br/>
<br/>
There is NO situation or circumstance that supports spanking.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Christian...Catholic (although some Christians have called me a <br/>
paganistic idol worshipper &lt;g&gt;) by choice and belief, and I have <br/>
never spanked my kids (dd-17, dd-13, ds-10, ds-6).  If the day ever <br/>
came when I felt I needed to spank my child, I would know that I had <br/>
failed as a Christian and a parent.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds harsh, but I was spanked as a child; I know how it feels, <br/>
and the cycle will not repeat itself with me.<br/>
<br/>
Had to get that out.<br/>

I was hit with a wooden spoon as a child. Maybe that has something to do with <br/>
the fact that all my wooden spoons keep getting lost? I love my stainless <br/>
steel spoon I bought myself. It feels better in my hand. No bad memories I <br/>
guess.<br/>

mouth.  My dh, Jackson, was locked in the basement.  Dark, dingy, damp <br/>
basement.  Dirt floor.  I have seen it and it is worse than any spanking I <br/>
ever got.  Can&#39;t imagine not knowing when someone would let you out.  Scary <br/>
just thinking about it.  <br/>

because they have difficulty managing anger, or because they were <br/>
spanked, or because they believe it&#39;s okay to spank.  These reasons <br/>
occur in all religions, and social and economic levels.  Conservative <br/>
Christians are not inherently &quot;spankers&quot;.<br/>

Not for about 20 years.  I was never punished in Catholic school; I <br/>
was spanked at home.  My parents loved me, but it was the way they <br/>

It is awful, but true to form I&#39;ve found.  Spankers seem to have a great<br/>
