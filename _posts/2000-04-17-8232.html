have and was more attached to her that any of my 4 siblings but moved<br/>
away from home at 17 and have only been back for visits and a few months<br/>
during my 20&#39;s.  not so for my siblings (one is still living there and<br/>
the other have lived there at least 3 yrs)  i&#39;m by far the most<br/>
independent and rarely went out during my teen years - i just was<br/>
interested in it.  so this is to say i completely agree with this<br/>
statement.  the negative view of loners really annoys me i just don&#39;t<br/>
enjoy being so stimulated all the time just once in awhile.<br/>

Hello and goodbye!
<p>I just wanted to say a few words on shyness from the perspective of
a British Columbia developmental psychologist Gordon Neufeld.&nbsp; He
believes shyness is a positive naturally occurring quality in children
which is instinctive and promotes attachment of children to their parents.&nbsp;
He recognizes that there are large variances of shyness but he sees it
as an important force for focusing children on the people who care about
them.&nbsp; It is not a problem per se.&nbsp; Very shy children have high
attachment needs which need to be met.&nbsp; I have stopped (mostly) &quot;encouraging&quot;
my children to be &quot;independent&quot;.&nbsp; You can&#39;t stop independence when
they are ready for it which occurs much later than most people think.&nbsp;
Late adolescence is the time for the natural emergence of true independence.&nbsp;
Independence is forced on children entirely too early which results not
in independence but &quot;peer identified&quot; children with displaced dependence
on their peers who are ill equipped to meet their real needs.
<p>I was subscribed to this list many months ago but unsubscribed because
my family needed my time more than I needed this list.&nbsp; I really like
it but I can see that I will need to unsubcribe again.&nbsp; I just can&#39;t
master the delete key in the way I need to.&nbsp;&nbsp; The topics are
too interesting and I agree and disagree with people so intensely.&nbsp;
I have a lot of experience and ideas to offer but sadly don&#39;t have the
time.
<p>I would encourage everyone to email Oprah&#39;s website and let them know
just how big and varied unschooling and homeschooling are.&nbsp; Oprah
is just mesmerized by schools and teachers.&nbsp; She needs lots of encouragement
to do the topic real justice.&nbsp; So let&#39;s try for an email a week to
Oprah for... say three weeks..... psst! Pass it On!
<p>I am leaving this list forthwith.
