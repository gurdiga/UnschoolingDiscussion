Where do you store art supplies (or science kits or<br/>
whatever) so they are easy to reach (but not for a<br/>
toddler) and in plain view without being messy?  <br/>
===<br/>
We put 2 five shelf bookcases (from home depot) into a double door closet in <br/>
the &#39;computer room&#39;.  Games and future craft kits, etc. are stored on the <br/>
higher shelves (with a step ladder folded up next to it) and all the art supplies <br/>
you could think of, and lots of paper, are stored on the lower shelves.  If <br/>
you had a toddler you could just shut the closet doors to keep them out of it?<br/>
