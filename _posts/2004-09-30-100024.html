<div id="ygrps-yiv-71108790">We are in the midst of our unschooling parenting journey.  Last night, ds ate half of a bag of Hershey&#39;s Kisses, two bites of dinner and then asked for an ice cream.  Dh looked at me like I was nuts for getting it.  DS had a little stomach ache later and said that maybe it was the ice cream.  He didn&#39;t each much protein, but had some fruit.  We were never overly restrictive about anything especially food.  But, we would try to encourage dinner before sweets.  So, that is new.  As I was making the grocery list, Ben wasn&#39;t going with me, I made sure to ask him if he wanted anything.  He said &quot;more kisses!!&quot;.  It occurred to me that in most homes, no one would probably bother to ask the 5 year old what he wanted and be willing to buy it without hesitation.  I usually don&#39;t ask him because he is usually with me when we shop and I buy pretty much what he wants, though now I make sure to ask, and I never say no to something unless we just don&#39;t have the extra money for 3 types of cereal or whatever.  He didn&#39;t eat anymore kisses by the way, even when I brought the bag out and offered them.<br/>
<br/>
 We&#39;ve never had bedtimes and only made a mild attempt once to regulate tv.  So many families I know restrict the tv, well everyone I know does.  As well as food and lots of other things.  We&#39;ve always been pretty relaxed about most things.  Not issues one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
The one issue that I&#39;m having a hard time letting go of if is the issue of toy guns.  I don&#39;t know why, but they bug me and we believed for so long that how kids shouldn&#39;t play with them, they promote violence, desensitizing them to violence etc...  Though we&#39;ve also talked about how I had toy guns as a kid, cap guns, and I&#39;m not violent.  DH always wanted a toy gun and never got one and resented it(lived  in a school bus as a kid by hippie parents, totally natural sugar free diet, earthy crunchy, now craves sugar and hates health foods also, not a violent person).  Most of our friend&#39;s kids would never have toy guns or any weapon toys.  We do have light sabers, swords and squirt guns.  Now, ds wants a toy gun and has been telling me that he is going to buy his kids a toy gun when he grows up. Here is our latest conversation:<br/>
<br/>
 B: I really want a toy gun.<br/>
M. I know, I really don&#39;t want you to have one.<br/>
B: Why not?<br/>
M: Because I don&#39;t like toy guns (totally weak reason I know)<br/>
B: then I won&#39;t ask you toy play with it.<br/>
M: Guns hurt people, I don&#39;t like when kids pretend to hurt people<br/>
B: But, toy guns aren&#39;t real, and no one gets hurt.  I have swords and they hurt people for real, but toy ones don&#39;t they are just pretend, you know the difference right Mommy? (this kid is 5 btw)<br/>
M: I just don&#39;t like them<br/>
B: Then when you come in the room, I&#39;ll hide it (uh oh, this is not good)<br/>
M: I don&#39;t want you to hide things from me<br/>
B: But, I dont&#39; want you to feel sad about a gun.  I won&#39;t shoot you with it I promise.<br/>
M: Let me talk it over with Daddy and think about it<br/>
B: okay let me know  (ick, another bad feeling from this response)<br/>
<br/>
So, basically, I feel bad about it, but am still resistant.  I talked about it with a few friends, stating how he had such a logical arguement in favor of.  They were appalled that I would even consider it.  I know it will not make him violent, he is a gentle kid, loud and roaring but gentle with other kids, not aggressive at all.  He loves knights, and robot battles, but I&#39;ve noticed that when he make his little robots from legos and they battle, after they &quot;get fainted&quot;, they join the good guy side.  And the good guys don&#39;t get hurt.  So, even in his play, he is not violent.  They said, &quot;so you pretty much are going to let him do whatever he wants whether it is good for him or not.  What if he wants to do drugs or steal, is that okay becasue he should have the freedom to choose for himself?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still resistant.  Part of it I hate to admit, is the perception of I bought my kid a toy gun.  Weak and poor reason, but I&#39;m being honest with myself, and I don&#39;t like my reasons.  Dh says he&#39;s fine with it. either way.  His hold out issue is soda.  He doesn&#39;t want him to have any.  Candy, beef jerky yes, soda no.???  DS never asks for it so it isn&#39;t an issue right now.  I&#39;m fine with soda.  We drink it.  But, dh doesn&#39;t want him to have it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you all have any hold out issues?  Things that go against your grain to just let go of?  I&#39;m trying hard to get through this gun thing, because he wants one.  I dont&#39; know why it bothers me so much.  I&#39;ve had some family members killed by guns, two in law enforcement, one by suicide, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the issue for me.  <br/>
<br/>
So, how do you get around these issues?  Violent video games, shows and toys, if you just don&#39;t want it around and you are worried about the effects of things on your kids?  He played some pretty violent video games at a friend&#39;s house. I think one was Mortal Kombat, again, he&#39;s five, I dont&#39; think he was ready for something like this.  He talked about it for months afterwards.  He incorporated it into his play and talked about it constantly.  It disturbed him a great deal and he didn&#39;t like it.  But, the kids were older and he didn&#39;t know what to do.  It was an emergency babysitting situation, and won&#39;t be repeated.<br/>
<br/>
This is getting too long so I won&#39;t go on.  We are on the continuim, but I don&#39;t know how to get through this part.<br/>

<br/>
Laura, send me your address and I will send your kid some guns.<br/>
Honest.   Marty needs a new pair of toy cowboy guns with Halloween coming and <br/>
all anyway.  Does he want brown or black?  That way you&#39;re totally out of the <br/>
loop. Don&#39;t even open the package, I&#39;ll address it to him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He loves knights, and robot battles, but I&#39;ve noticed that when he make <br/>
his little robots from legos and they battle, after they &quot;get fainted&quot;, they <br/>
join the good guy side. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really sweet.  Like tag games where you gain the players you tag.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They said, &quot;so you pretty much are going to let him do whatever he wants <br/>
whether it is good for him or not. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I personally have come to believe that controls are worse than all the toy <br/>
guns in the world.   And the relationship between a child and parent can&#39;t be <br/>
regained.  Your husband still has resentment/sorrow about not having a toy gun.  <br/>
No amount of money or time or talking can change that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What if he wants to do drugs or steal, is that okay becasue he should have <br/>
the freedom to choose for himself?&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re just not thinking, your friends.<br/>
Do they think that those who do drugs and steal had their mothers&#39; <br/>
permission?  That she went to Walmart and bought them some drugs or took them down there <br/>
to steal?<br/>
<br/>
They are not thinking.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m still resistant.  Part of it I hate to admit, is the perception of I <br/>
bought my kid a toy gun. -=-<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s your address?<br/>

killed by guns, two in law enforcement, one by suicide, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s <br/>
the issue for me.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Does your son know those stories?  Maybe tell them to him again, gently, and <br/>
even if that&#39;s NOT your whole issue, it will be an explanation that will make <br/>
sense to him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He played some pretty violent video games at a friend&#39;s house. I think one <br/>
was Mortal Kombat, again, he&#39;s five, I dont&#39; think he was ready for something <br/>
like this.  He talked about it for months afterwards.  He incorporated it <br/>

he didn&#39;t like it.  But, the kids were older and he didn&#39;t know what to do.  <br/>
It was an emergency babysitting situation, and won&#39;t be repeated.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Being five won&#39;t be repeated either.   Maybe next time he&#39;s where that game <br/>
is he&#39;ll feel very differently about it, but keeping him from making a choice <br/>
will just add more factors.<br/>
<br/>
-=- We are on the continuim, but I don&#39;t know how to get through this part.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can help if you send your address.<br/>
If you felt guilty about the expense you could send a donation for my website <br/>
expenses, and honestly I need a new computer, so contributions to the website <br/>
would be lovely.  I take paypal at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
They have toy guns at Playnix toys right near my house, and it&#39;s an <br/>
educational toystore so guns must be educational! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little they liked the wooden toy guns from New Orleans <br/>
Square in Disneyland, outside Pirates of the Caribbean.   They have a trigger and <br/>
a hammer, real hammer onto a steel plate.   So you could cut caps apart into <br/>
individual caps, &quot;load&quot; that gun, and fire once with the one cap.   They sell <br/>
them other places too, sometimes--touristy places.   I saw some with cowboy and <br/>
Indian stuff in Old Town in Albuquerque once.<br/>
<br/>
And there are rubber band guns made of wood with a clothespin mounted on <br/>
them.  Those really can hurt, though.  I&#39;d go for the make-believe &quot;bang&quot; or caps, <br/>
not rubber bands.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  You could say &quot;I&#39;m going to give him as much opportunity as I possibly <br/>
can to make real decisions that really matter to him. Because in a few <br/>
short years he WILL be the one who will have to keep himself safe and <br/>
he WILL be able to do whatever he wants whether it is good for him or <br/>
not. There are a lot of things every kid is going to face, growing up, <br/>
and I want him to have had ALL the opportunities to build up his <br/>
decision-making abilities as possible so that he&#39;ll be thoughtful and <br/>
clearheaded and &quot;practiced&quot; in making choices. I want him, in fact, to <br/>
make some wrong choices while he is young enough that those wrong <br/>
choices are not life-threatening or even life-serious (although they <br/>
may feel that way to him, as they are for someone his age).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In addition to that, I think you should spend some time getting to <br/>
understand human behavior and &quot;force&quot; - maybe don&#39;t call it &quot;violence&quot; <br/>
because I bet that word is loaded with baggage.<br/>
<br/>
Kids, especially male kids, but not only them, are focused a lot on the <br/>
issue of &quot;force&quot; - they NEED it in their play - it is how they process <br/>
it all. Denying them the props they want for their play is no different <br/>
than saying, &quot;I know better than you do what YOU should play.&quot; But it <br/>
isn&#39;t true - you&#39;re NOT in his head and never will be. You LOVE him, <br/>
but you are not him. You will never be able to know better than he does <br/>
what he should think about - and that is what play is - it is an <br/>
outward expression of what the kid is thinking about. To try to control <br/>
what they &quot;play&quot; is nothing short of attempted mind control.<br/>

about it with a few friends, stating how he had such a logical arguement in<br/>
favor of.  They were appalled that I would even consider it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes he was considerably more logical than your friends. <br/>
<br/>
The best advice that I have ever heard regarding toy guns is from Ren. Only<br/>
point the gun at someone who has agreed to play the game. That is the<br/>
principle of consideration for others. <br/>
<br/>
Here is some of what I wrote about toys and violence a little while ago on<br/>
Basics. There was also thread here called &quot;Violent toys?&quot; a few months ago<br/>
if you want to look up the archives.<br/>
<br/>
Quote begins:<br/>
<br/>
It can be hard to remain open minded when it is a toy gun, because there is<br/>
a pervasive belief in the wider community that playing with guns equates to<br/>
a child becoming a violent person - not unlike playing violent video games.<br/>
This is a theory that is not borne out by the experiences related by long<br/>
term Unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
One of the wonderful moments from the Conference last year [2003] was when I<br/>
was chatting with a mother in the hall (sorry I don&#39;t remember who) when she<br/>
spotted her dd passing by. She called out to her and politely but excitedly<br/>
asked if she would mind letting her brother know that some other kids (pre<br/>
and early teen) were nearby playing some pretend game with long sticks (made<br/>
from pvc pipe) and he would be interested in joining it. <br/>
<br/>
This struck me most forcibly as being the exact opposite of how many parents<br/>
would react to the whole idea of that kind of game, including assuming the<br/>
children would be careless and dangerous, as well as spiritually/emotionally<br/>
harmed by the fighting fantasy. They would want it stopped at once. <br/>
<br/>
I have faith that the kids were responsible, careful and experienced. I am<br/>
totally sure that if there was a kid in the game who seemed to be lacking<br/>
self-control and dangerous to others, there would be a halt called and they<br/>
would seek the help of a familiar adult if the problem could not be<br/>
resolved. I can only assume that the other mother had equal faith. <br/>
<br/>
On a related note, the kids were playing absolutely openly and publicly in<br/>
the funshop room (more like a ballroom sized chamber). There was no secrecy<br/>
or hiding. There was acceptance and encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
[Here some words from another poster whose dd had a new gun she was<br/>
delighting in, and whose expressed ideas were remarkably similar to your ds]<br/>
<br/>
My first thought is to not take the gun to that other family&#39;s home. On<br/>
other occasions, especially in your (her) home, it is more important to<br/>
honor your daughter&#39;s feelings than the possible feelings of other people,<br/>
none of whom you can control. You can continue to observe your dd and take<br/>
comfort in her evident grasp of the difference between fantasy play and<br/>
reality.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, another thing is to give her time for the newness of this toy to<br/>
wear off before necessarily having a play date with that particular family,<br/>
so that suggesting different games may be less of a privation for her. <br/>
<br/>
This issue has come up on occasion on my local group list in relation to<br/>
Park Days. Rarely, a family is anti-gun on broad principle; others subscribe<br/>
to the bad-toys-breed-psychos theory (see above); others are concerned about<br/>
immediate safety - the kids getting too excited and there being accidents in<br/>
&quot;violent&quot; play. These are some of the reasons our group tends to look for<br/>
good sized parks to allow the kids to separate into different groups for<br/>
different games. <br/>
<br/>
It is sometimes harder for people to deal with very realistic looking guns,<br/>
rather than colorful &quot;ray guns&quot; or something other weapon like faux swords.<br/>
On occasion people have been concerned that other park users will get &quot;the<br/>
wrong impression&quot; about our kids, especially during war-time. It is possible<br/>
to get tied into knots of non-logic worrying about pretty unlikely scenarios<br/>
and the opinions of unconnected strangers. <br/>
<br/>
One of the responses has been to reassure everyone that although there have<br/>
been the odd accidents at park days, none have been related to fantasy<br/>
weapons role playing. Another has been to talk about the kids&#39; needs to<br/>
process some of their fears and feelings about the war news, or societal<br/>
violence in general, to feel powerful in a safe environment with the surety<br/>
of their parents available to step in if it all got too much at any time.<br/>
<br/>
These are ideas that have been expressed by some of the parents of mostly<br/>
boys in our group who continue to engage in gun or weapons games. Jayn has<br/>
to date shown no interest in these games at the park. She does enjoy playing<br/>
&quot;On guard&quot; with us at home with her swords and shields - lots of collapsing<br/>
&quot;dead&quot; cured with the following incantation, &quot;magic, magic back alive!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Gun playing doesn&#39;t bother me. A child getting upset enough to use any toy<br/>
or object as an actual weapon, as against a fantasy weapon, is much more<br/>
worrying. Sand is more dangerous at the park than one kid&#39;s habitual bow and<br/>
suction cup arrows have ever been.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049041336">I&#39;m not going to be much help with this. But I wanted to tell what I<br/>
think is kind of a funny (?) story:<br/>
<br/>
My son was probably about 3 and periodically he and I&#39;d go to Toys R<br/>
Us to play. Sometimes we played with the wagons and trikes on display<br/>
but eventually he got caught up in the video games being demo&#39;ed on<br/>
various game consoles in the store. The first game that ever caught<br/>
his eye was a game called Tekken (sp?), a kicking and punching<br/>
fighting game. I was *very* uncomfortable with it. Number one, it<br/>
definitely wasn&#39;t the kind of game *I* enjoyed, it really upset me to<br/>
watch punching and kicking and, number 2, I was a little like you: I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to admit that I allowed my kid to play something like<br/>
that. Heck, I didn&#39;t even want to admit that I had a kid who *wanted*<br/>
to play a game like that.<br/>
<br/>
So, first I tried telling Nick that I didn&#39;t want him to play this<br/>
game because it was a &quot;violent game and I don&#39;t like watching a game<br/>
where people (characters) get hurt.&quot; I thought maybe my<br/>
disapproval/discomfort/dislike would be enough. It wasn&#39;t. So here we<br/>
are, Nick is sitting in a shopping cart so he can reach the controls<br/>
on the demo game consoles, and a little old lady comes by and says<br/>
something like, &quot;That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with our world! Kids playing<br/>
violent games like that!&quot; Nick turns to her (actually, I don&#39;t think<br/>
he turned - he was too busy), and said, gleefully, &quot;I&#39;ll *like* games<br/>
where people get hurt!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was horrified! But I understood immediately that what he was really<br/>
saying was, &quot;I find this fascinating! My mom says this is a game where<br/>
people get hurt, ergo, I like games where people get hurt!&quot; My son is<br/>
also extremely non-violent. When he was younger, the monsters,<br/>
enemies, etc., in his video games always turned into nice, cool,<br/>
gentle, helpful, cute, kind, little creatures in his games of fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
So I decided that what was important was how Nick acted and as long as<br/>
he continued to be a kind, considerate person, I wasn&#39;t going to think<br/>
about controlling what games he played.<br/>
<br/>
I think the other thing I did, which I know many people would not<br/>
agree with, was tried to let Nick know about the cultural war around<br/>
toy guns and video games. There are some situations where, in<br/>
consideration of others, we don&#39;t bring our guns. We don&#39;t bring them<br/>
to our homeschooling support group Park Day. Nick also knows that when<br/>
some moms and their kids come over, we don&#39;t play our Teen and Mature<br/>
rated video games. In fact, when some moms and kids come over, we<br/>
don&#39;t play video games at all. I told Nick what people&#39;s concerns are<br/>
about all these things and that what we do in our own home or with<br/>
like minded people is one thing but we choose to be concerned about<br/>
what makes our friends uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe this was helpful after all?<br/>

what they &quot;play&quot; is nothing short of attempted mind control.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True, and then there&#39;s a further aspect.  He has to play at wondering WHY his <br/>
mom is so fearful and controlling.  Moms become maybe bad guys or maybe just <br/>
contradictory, mysterious good guys the child&#39;s growing internal character <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
I would rather my child feel strongly that he and I were partners gether in <br/>
his growth (something I learned at La Leche Leagu<br/>
Ze meetings before Kirby was old enough to know he was separate from me) than <br/>
for him to feel I was an adversary or a guard or any sort of &quot;other.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a child wanted to climb a tree, wouldn&#39;t you try to find a safe climbing <br/>
tree?<br/>
If he wanted to try a scooter or a skateboard, wouldn&#39;t you try to find him <br/>
one to borrow to try?<br/>
If he wanted to throw rocks, wouldn&#39;t you find him a safe rock-throwing place <br/>
and some water or a good target to throw at?<br/>
<br/>
Toy guns are much safer than climbing trees, riding scooters, or throwing <br/>
rocks.<br/>
Children have been seriously wounded or died from trees, skateboards and <br/>
rocks.<br/>

Hi, Laura --<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to extend you a bit of sympathy.  We started out with no <br/>
guns, but it only lasted until my son was two or three and could make <br/>
his opinions known clearly.  We have lots of Nerf weaponry, and I end up <br/>
having my own lame conversations in the toy aisle : &quot;You already have 17 <br/>
Nerf guns and they take up a lot of space -- why do you need another <br/>
one?&quot;   (So I know I&#39;m being an annoying source of friction.)<br/>
<br/>
Projectile weapons that you can aim and knock things over with really <br/>
are fun.<br/>
<br/>
If you have to, could you sidle up to toy guns gradually?  First a <br/>
little catapult (Playmobil), and then a safe type of dart board, and <br/>
then a gun that shoots foam pingpong balls?<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t like guns, I find it helps to have a rule that the gun can <br/>
only be pointed at someone who consents to be in the game.  I get <br/>
creeped out when the bright plastic gun gets pointed at me.  And I think <br/>
it&#39;s important to respect this feeling and not turn non-participating <br/>
people into targets<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  My 10 year old boy is very sweet and considerate even though he <br/>
possesses a large arsenal of projectile toys.  Once he had an allowance, <br/>
he could spend it on anything legal that he wanted.</div>

It is sometimes harder for people to deal with very realistic looking guns,<br/>
rather than colorful &quot;ray guns&quot; or something other weapon like faux swords.<br/>
On occasion people have been concerned that other park users will get &quot;the<br/>
wrong impression&quot; about our kids, especially during war-time. It is possible<br/>
to get tied into knots of non-logic worrying about pretty unlikely scenarios<br/>
and the opinions of unconnected strangers.<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this was my own personal slippery slope. *g*  Initially, I was very <br/>
anti-gun. Just wasn&#39;t going to happen. I bought the girls those squirt <br/>
guns that looked like fish instead of guns, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Three summers ago, there were these really cool (to my mind)  Buzz <br/>
Lightyear Bubbleguns. I rationalized buying them by thinking to myself, <br/>
&quot;They&#39;ll never get hurt by picking up a stray ray gun.&quot; or something <br/>
along those lines.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, about a year ago, I began reading more here, and we&#39;d been <br/>
watching some of the presidential addresses on the war in Iraq. Emily <br/>
was simultaneously making up and singing war protest songs and marching <br/>
around, singing &quot;Women of War! We are Women of War!&quot;  This list and Em&#39;s <br/>
own actions made me begin to realize how important it was to honor her <br/>
need to play and work through war and violence in her own way.<br/>
<br/>
Then about a month or so later, we were in Colonial Williamsburg and Sam <br/>
really wanted a wooden pistol, so we got that. Then it was a Star Wars <br/>
light saber, or as the kids say, &quot;light saver.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then we started going to Walmart and places looking for swords, shields, <br/>
etc. We now have quite an extensive and wonderful collection of <br/>
different kinds of swords and a few guns. We just recently picked up a <br/>
pirate&#39;s blunder buster. We picked up a cool Eyewitness book on the <br/>
history of Arms and Armor, and have had great fun all around. Despite <br/>
the negative talk about ren fairs here ;) we&#39;re hoping to go to the one <br/>
here in Maryland this year and pick up a cool wooden sword and shield.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had instances where we&#39;ve put the weapon up until Sam (4) was <br/>
ready to be responsible with it: i.e. not hit people or puppies with it. <br/>
But I certainly have not noticed *more* violent play in any way. I <br/>
remember someone here, I think, posting about how violent video games <br/>
actually gave her son an *outlet* for his aggression that was necessary <br/>
and far more healthy than repressing those explorations. That made such <br/>
sense to me and has really rung true in my experience.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think the other thing I did, which I know many people would not<br/>
<br/>
agree with, was tried to let Nick know about the cultural war around<br/>
<br/>
toy guns and video games. There are some situations where, in<br/>
<br/>
consideration of others, we don&#39;t bring our guns. We don&#39;t bring them<br/>
<br/>
to our homeschooling support group Park Day.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We did that too.  They knew some families didn&#39;t like it.  And interestingly, <br/>
they thought those moms just weren&#39;t very bright.  And the more we got to <br/>
know the families, the more I agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Some moms truly do think they can control a kid&#39;s thoughts by controlling <br/>
what they touch and see.<br/>
<br/>
-=-we choose to be concerned about<br/>
<br/>
what makes our friends uncomfortable.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We do too, and my kids are better at remembering than I am when one family or <br/>
another likes avoid Harry Potter or magic-anything or fairies or bad words or <br/>
South Park or whatever.   I draw the line at The Simpsons, though.  We just <br/>
put up a big poster of all the characters, framed, right at the bottom of the <br/>
stairs.    Anyone who doesn&#39;t approve of the Simpsons can just turn around and <br/>
go back home.<br/>

9 yo will play very rough forceful games and be able to stop and change<br/>
activities rather quickly.  My 13, who lived a life surrounded by violence<br/>
until joining our family, can not change activities.  Once he is playing<br/>
rough & tumble sorts of games--even some video football games are too<br/>
much--he carries it over into all his activities.  His boundaries are sooooo<br/>
very blurred that he can not play any violent/rough/forceful games without<br/>
getting carried away and not knowing when to stop.  This can make it<br/>
difficult for him in social setting where other children can appropriately<br/>
play in such fashion but I can not allow him to do so for fear of it going<br/>
too far and someone getting hurt.  Of course his 200 lbs size combine with<br/>
his developmental level of about 6 year contributes greatly to the risk.<br/>
<br/>
This sometimes causes families that don&#39;t realize his history look at me a<br/>
bit strange when I will allow one child to participate in play but not the<br/>
other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769501662">----Laura, send me your address and I will send your kid some guns.<br/>
Honest.   Marty needs a new pair of toy cowboy guns with Halloween coming and <br/>
all anyway.  Does he want brown or black?  That way you&#39;re totally out of the <br/>
loop. Don&#39;t even open the package, I&#39;ll address it to him.<br/>
<br/>
  I think I&#39;m going to let him buy it with his money.  That was part of his arguement, that I wouldn&#39;t have to buy it, he has his own money.  He is a saver, so he has plenty.  But, thank you for the offer.  He likes to pick things out and will probably spend a few weeks comparison shopping and choosing just the right one.  That&#39;s part of the fun I think.  He is a discriminating shopper.  <br/>
  But, thank you, that would of made it easier.  If I&#39;m gonna do this, I&#39;ll just jump on in and let him select his own.<br/>
<br/>
  ---They&#39;re just not thinking, your friends.<br/>
  Do they think that those who do drugs and steal had their mothers&#39; <br/>
  permission?  That she went to Walmart and bought them some drugs or took them down there <br/>
  to steal?<br/>
<br/>
  good point!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ---Being five won&#39;t be repeated either.   Maybe next time he&#39;s where that game <br/>
  is he&#39;ll feel very differently about it, but keeping him from making a choice <br/>
  will just add more factors.<br/>
<br/>
  One good thing came of that incident.  We talked about what he can do the next time he is in a situation that kids are doing things that makes him uncomfortable but he doesn&#39;t want to speak up because they might not like him.  (handy for later for really big issues I think)  I&#39;m glad we had this chance to talk about peer pressure under a basically benign scenario.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ---And there are rubber band guns made of wood with a clothespin mounted on <br/>
  them.  Those really can hurt, though.  I&#39;d go for the make-believe &quot;bang&quot; or caps, <br/>
  not rubber bands.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, he is afraid of rubber bands, when he was younger, he had one over his head and it snapped on both of his eyes and scratched his eyeballs pretty badly.  He will just now touch one, but always retells that story.  <br/>
<br/>
  I think I&#39;m moving towards the gun thing, with some guidelines.  I like the don&#39;t point it at anyone who is not playing.  We do have blasters, so we aren&#39;t far away.  The main thing I don&#39;t want him to feel is that he is somehow bad for wanting something I clearly don&#39;t like, kwim?  Would he think &quot;if mom doesn&#39;t like these, they are bad, if I want one, I&#39;m bad for wanting one.&quot;  That would be terrible.<br/>
<br/>
  The friends I have are noticing that we are really moving in a new direction.  I am so much more relaxed about things, but I&#39;m having a hard time not rolling my eyes at things they are doing and saying.  We were always the most relaxed about things amoung our friends, now especially.  <br/>
<br/>
  They were appalled that we taught him to play Magic the Gathering, let him watch Star Wars and Harry Potter movies, and let him eat candy.  They will just have to continue to be appalled.!!  I&#39;ll let ya&#39;ll know how it goes.  Thanks for helping me sort through this.  <br/>

Laura, _Playful Parenting_ by L. Cohen has a lot of good reasons to <br/>

Okay,  that&#39;s my confession. What&#39;s the UD equivilent of 20 Hail <br/>
Mary&#39;s??  <br/>
==============<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
Three secret good deeds.<br/>
No one  can know, so you can&#39;t expect or receive thanks or recognition.<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s  that?<br/>
<br/>
If you tell one, it&#39;s cancelled out and you have to do another  one to _make <br/>
up_ (mip://06f64070/make%20up)  <br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not  penance, it&#39;s. . . therapeutic practice.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I was going to say 20 Hail John&#39;s. But I think Sandra&#39;s is cooler.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

***************************<br/>
Depending on my confession (impatience with the kids, taking someone for  <br/>
granted, wanting to flog my husband...) our priest always says (for penance) to  <br/>
do something nice for the person I &quot;wronged.&quot;  So much more productive  than <br/>
10  hail Marys!  And if he think&#39;s I&#39;m being to hard on myself,  he suggests a <br/>
good book to read (not always a religious one!), meditating, and  taking it <br/>
easy :o)<br/>

Liz - we have an 11 yo adopted son who is exactly the same way.  He  goes too <br/>
far...not stopping when other kids feel he&#39;s getting too wild,...Your  <br/>
description of having &quot;blurred lines&quot; is so true.  He has a real problem  when it <br/>
comes to relating appropriately with adults (will often try to play  rough, <br/>
taunt to try and get them to chase him, etc.)  It&#39;s really hard to  know when to <br/>
let him go and when to divert his attention to something  else.<br/>

Of course there are times and places and situations that are not good <br/>

 remember his name! Maybe his first name was Gerald. Not having much<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604257160">We don&#39;t do realistic guns, for a reason. We have a real gun in the <br/>
house. If my kids come across a real looking gun, I want them to <br/>
avoid it, come get me, their dad, who ever. I knew someone whose son <br/>
found a real gun buried in the stuff under the play equipment at the <br/>
playground.(nothing horrible happened, but it was weird and more than <br/>
a little scary because it was partially loaded) It happens rarely, <br/>
but it can happen.<br/>
 They will eventually take a gun safety course. Yes,the one the NRA <br/>
does. I&#39;m not a big supporter of the NRA, but that is one thing that <br/>
they do very well. They have a pretty comprehensive parent and child <br/>
gun safety course. Since we will be living in Texas, where guns are <br/>
very common, esp in other people&#39;s houses, and we will probably have <br/>
at least a couple, I want the kids to know what guns can do, and how <br/>
to handle a weapon safely.<br/>
 But, for now, no real looking guns, because I don&#39;t want them to get <br/>
confused about real or fake guns. our real guns look real, their guns <br/>
are pink, purple, orange and green and look like something out of a <br/>
bad sci fi movie.<br/>
 The gun daddy uses at work, sometimes, they have seen, up close. <br/>
they have held it. It&#39;s a really big real gun that can shoot a whole <br/>
lot of times. They have actually crawled around on and inside of <br/>
tanks and seen those really big guns too. (It happens when you live <br/>
on a military base.)They have also asked more than one police officer <br/>
or MP about their gun or their dog, or their car or their siren. But <br/>
until they are old enough to really distinguish real guns from toy <br/>
guns, we aren&#39;t going to allow realistic toy guns in the house. I <br/>
know several people who come from hunting/ target shooting families, <br/>
who have done very similar things with their kids. It just seems to <br/>
make sense to me to do it that way. My son is one of those kids who <br/>
would make guns out of legos, sticks, breadsticks, or his finger <br/>
before we decided to let this issue go. He&#39;s really okay with the non <br/>
realistic guns that we have for him to play with. I don&#39;t like the <br/>
repetitive bang bang bang, that usually accompanies gun play. SO, <br/>
since most of the kids guns look like ray guns, they make other <br/>
noises with them. SO we&#39;re all happy with that.<br/>
As far as the video games go, both Marty and I agree, we aren&#39;t going <br/>
to spend a few hundrend dollars our money on a video game system. <br/>
When the kids are older, and they can find a way to pay for it out of <br/>
their money, so be it. But it&#39;s not something we find really worth <br/>
it. There are enough computer games out there for our kids to be <br/>
happy with for now. (the kids are 3 and 6)<br/>

The neighbor boy that my son enjoys playing with the most is in that <br/>
group. We were talking about when we are going to let our frog go <br/>
(it&#39;s indigenous, it showed up on our doorstep and we need to let it <br/>
go so it can go hibernate) and I said something about probably around <br/>
halloween. The little boy&#39;s eyes got really big, and he said, &quot;You <br/>
guys celebrate halloween?!?&quot; I told him, yes, we did. It is my <br/>
favorite holiday. He said something about, but it&#39;s Satan&#39;s <br/>
birthday... I probably shouldn&#39;t have handled it the way I did, but I <br/>
told him, not to us it wasn&#39;t. It is/was a pagan holiday, but it <br/>
really doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Satan historically. He asked <br/>
if we dressed up and did trick or treating, and said, yeah, we do <br/>
both. We usually go to at least one halloween party, and do trick or <br/>
treating at the mall too. He asked about razors in the candy, like it <br/>
was something that is really common. I told him that we don&#39;t eat <br/>
anything that looks suspicious, and that there are places that will <br/>
xray the candy for you if you want to do that. We just don&#39;t go to <br/>
people&#39;s houses that we don&#39;t know and anything that even looks like <br/>
it might have been opened or damaged goes in the trash. I felt really <br/>
sorry for the kid. He obviously WANTS to do trick or treating. <br/>
