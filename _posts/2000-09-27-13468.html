<div id="ygrps-yiv-85156769">Thanks to those who responded to my desperate post today!!  After I <br/>
got a grip on myself (after posting, emailing, crying, etc.), amazing <br/>
things started to happen!  My two oldest actually finished their <br/>
humongous task of cleaning their playroom!!  Then we started on their <br/>
religious ed homework and (this is amazing because it is so rare) my <br/>
son actually read two whole chapters to me!!<br/>
<br/>
A while ago we embrassed the idea that he would learn to read on his <br/>
own.  It was very, very scary at first, what give up CONTROL?, but <br/>
then we have moments such as this afternoon when I know the Lord is <br/>
giving me a break and a sign and my son is showing me that he can <br/>
read and he comprehends what he is reading!  I think he learned <br/>
something else today, too.  Mom&#39;s not so bad to read to!<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks and praise the Lord for showing me the way again!!!</div>
