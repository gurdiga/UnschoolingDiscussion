<div id="ygrps-yiv-587154239">We live in the boonies, sort of, or at least the biggest city in these<br/>
boonies (26,000 with less than 130,000 in the whole county).  But, before<br/>
moving back here we lived in a &quot;bedroom&quot; community that commuters to SF<br/>
&quot;found.&quot;  The population was 136,000 and climbing!  FAST!!!  With little or<br/>
no intelligent planning.  I had to laugh about the 1/2 hour because it took<br/>
that long on an average just to get across town to where most of the<br/>
grocery stores were!  I worked less than a dozen blocks from my house and<br/>
it could frequently take me up to 15 minutes just to get to work!  Here,<br/>
1/2 hour takes us to the mountains to play in the snow or south to some<br/>
great places to get fun and sun on the rivers.  10 minutes gets us the<br/>
ocean or the next town &lt;g&gt;  Guess the times are all relative.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in the process of doing remodeling, the kitchen and bathroom thing<br/>
because &quot;they&quot; (does anyone know who &quot;they&quot; is?) say that adds the most $$$<br/>
to a sale price.  Then we will be putting it up for sale too with hopes of<br/>
moving before July (both hubby and I are July babies and thought that would<br/>
be a great present to ourselves &lt;g&gt;).  Small world!<br/>

before July when #6 will arrive!)<br/>
