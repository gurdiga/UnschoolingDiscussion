&gt; clothes,etc.  When I see the movie made about the book I am so often<br/>
&gt; disgusted and annoyed b/c &quot;that&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to look&quot;!<br/>
&gt; I guess I get to wrapped up in my descriptions.<br/>
&gt; Any one else have the same problems?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t watch many movies, and it that&#39;s why.  I have nothing against<br/>
movies, I just don&#39;t like what they do to &quot;MY&quot; books!<br/>
