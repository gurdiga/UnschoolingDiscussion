<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674287036">DD has been describing dreams lately that are quite interesting.  Mainly, I find them fascinating because they are eerily similar to dreams that I had as a child.  Anyway, we began discussing mythology and such, and I was wondering if there isn&#39;t some kind of myth revolving around a central part of the dreams. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, does anyone know of a myth or a culture that believed that there were beings/people who lived underground?  I don&#39;t even know where to start to find the answer.  We&#39;d like to know so we can research further to write a story based on the dream/myth.  <br/>

Thanks!<br/>

by C.S. Lewis, there were underground dwellers.<br/>

Dwarves maybe?  Northern European Germanic motif in stories.<br/>
<br/>
There are dream interpretation sites online, I think.  Lists of dream <br/>
elements.  <br/>
<br/>
You might already know this term, but Jung wrote about &quot;the collective <br/>
unconscious,&quot; the kinds of characters and stories all people just seem to have in <br/>
their imaginations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60396089">There appear to be some underground dwellers in Norse mythology,<br/>
primarily dwarves and dark-elves.  Too, one of the realms of the gods<br/>
is seen as being underground.<br/>

That&#39;s the only reference I was able to find to underground-dwelling<br/>
creatures.  The Hawai&#39;ian menehune may also have dwelt underground,<br/>
but I couldn&#39;t find a definitive source there.<br/>

<br/>
Irish and other Celtic folk tales often involve faerie folk who live<br/>
underground. &quot;Kate Crackernuts&quot; (I think Scottish) is a variation on the<br/>
Dancing Princesses (who wear out their shoes every night) story, about a<br/>
prince who goes to dance every night underground and is slowly wasting away<br/>
from exhaustion. Also the Pied Piper takes the children to live in an<br/>
underground cave that then closes on them after the townspeople refuse to<br/>
pay. <br/>
<br/>
Ancient Greeks had Hades as an underground realm, an idea that spread to the<br/>
Romans. See the story of Demeter.<br/>
<br/>
More modern - &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; (Narnia) CS Lewis; John Wyndham writing as<br/>
John Beynon has a short story about an underground culture; &quot;The Time<br/>
Machine&quot; HG Wells; Artemis Fowl stories. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are tons more, but I canâ€™t think of them off the top of my<br/>
head.<br/>

The Tuatha de Danaan were believed to live underground and have entrances into their underworld. They were the people who were reputed to have inhabited the British Isle before the Celts (ahem). They were said to be small and dark haired.<br/>
<br/>
Legends put entrances to the world of the Sidhe underground but theyn I think it opens up so not *real* underground.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the myth of the hollow earth. It&#39;s appeared in various cultures and if you plotted all the &#39;entrances&#39; the earth would look like swiss cheese.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a whole bunch of legends about the Tuatha de. If I was more awake I&#39;d send links, but I&#39;m not and the kids are calling for breakfast.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-114704570">Navaho cosmology has all beings coming through from worlds that were <br/>
at different levels underground.  A not very readable site is here <br/>
http://www.meta-<br/>
religion.com/World_Religions/Ancient_religions/North_america/navaho_co<br/>
smogony.htm or a slightly better site here <br/>
http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/nam/navaho.html.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a site about subterranean myths (I didn&#39;t read it very <br/>
thoroughly) <br/>
http://home.earthlink.net/~mottimorph/SubterraneanIntro2.html.<br/>
<br/>
And there are subterranean folk in Norwegian mythology, this site has <br/>
a review of the different types of folk tale and the characters that <br/>
make up those folk tales: http://www.feri.com/dawn/Feritails.html.  <br/>
Interestingly they suggest that subterranean creatures where the <br/>
children who Eve hid from God.  When God discovered they existed he <br/>
said that those who once hid should stay hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934073106">Hi Pam, long time no read.<br/>
<br/>
Good Lord Woman! Get thee to the library and worship the writing God <br/>
that is Neil.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, just had a fangirl moment.<br/>
Something about him just engenders obsession. It could be because, <br/>
besides being just one of the best authors writing today, he&#39;s also <br/>
extremely open to his fans and other writers.<br/>
Likes his editor which is always a plus in my book....I know a few <br/>
authors I really like who seem to think they have no need for an <br/>
editor...coughJKRowlingcoughcoughAnne Ricecoughcough.<br/>
He even keeps an online journal.<br/>
<br/>
Plus I really dig  someone who can:<br/>
produce the best comic ever written (Sandman) along with 4 or 5 other series<br/>
write great little kids books(Wolves in the Walls)<br/>
give me nightmares from a children&#39;s book (Coraline)<br/>
write adult novels that are just different (American Gods, Neverwhere)<br/>
rewrite a fairy tale (Snow Glass Apples, which is online to be read just <br/>
search for it) in such a way that it turns into a horror short story.<br/>
<br/>
This post makes me wonder about other things.<br/>
Do you censor (and I mean in the larger you not just Pam) what your kids <br/>
read? Ds (12) is still not a fluent reader so the comics I read <br/>
(Sandman, Hellblazer, ect) are what he wants to look at (though I do get <br/>
the Marvel/DC ones for kids) and have me help him along.<br/>
I&#39;m perfectly happy to do that.<br/>
But these really are ADULT comics. Gory, violent, explicitly sexual in <br/>
places and I find myself wanting to just give him a summery of some <br/>
story arcs and move on, but that makes me feel as if I&#39;m depriving him <br/>
of the whole of the story.<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
This brings me to another thought. What are you folks reading? I always <br/>
like to see what out there that I&#39;m missing. Right now I&#39;m reading:<br/>
Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell: a monster (800 pages) of a book by <br/>
Susanna Clark. If you like Jane Austin, magic and magicians, fantasy and <br/>
history this is just a great book. I loved and am reading it a second time.<br/>
Light: M. John Harrison...I&#39;ve just started this<br/>
The Scar: China Mieville...I&#39;m a little ways into this and its shaping <br/>
up to be a nice fantasy/mystery type of book.<br/>

&gt; Hi Julie!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Roxana (my 17 yo) adds to your Neil Gaiman recommendation - says<br/>
&gt; anybody who hasn&#39;t read him is really missing out!!! (Probably that is<br/>
&gt; a pointed comment directed at ME, because I have yet to read anything<br/>
&gt; by him.)<br/>

lovely english accent, I had tried to avoid the obvious and superficial <br/>
reasons that I would squee! if I ever really met him.<br/>
Someday I will be able to make a comic convention where he is or maybe <br/>
when his next book comes out he&#39;ll come to the wild&#39;s of Arkansas for a <br/>
reading.<br/>
I can dream, can&#39;t I?<br/>

<br/>
We don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But these really are ADULT comics. Gory, violent, explicitly sexual in <br/>
places and I find myself wanting to just give him a summery of some <br/>
story arcs and move on, but that makes me feel as if I&#39;m depriving him <br/>
of the whole of the story.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sexually suggestive comics our kids went through a few years ago:  Elfquest.<br/>
<br/>
They discovered them somewhere else, and were overjoyed to find their dad had <br/>
the whole set up to the point he/dad had quit collecting.   They added a few <br/>
more recent ones and read through it all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t censor what they read at all. Gave up even trying to keep up <br/>
with KNOWING what they&#39;re reading, long ago, because they check out <br/>
their own books from the library and buy their own books from the <br/>
bookstore - if I was checking up on them and tut-tutting some choices, <br/>
that would just be an incentive for them to be sneaky about what they <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
So - Rox has always read things that would give me nightmares, I know <br/>
that.  But she&#39;s always been one to handle stuff like that better than <br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
Reading out loud - if the kid is maintaining interest, I guess I&#39;d just <br/>
go on and read it. But I know it would be hard for me, too, and I <br/>
understand the temptation to &quot;summarize.&quot; Still, he could say so if it <br/>
bothered him, so if he didn&#39;t stop me, I&#39;d figure he was learning <br/>
something he wanted to learn.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HA - after just writing that I don&#39;t read the kind of stuff Rox does, I <br/>
have to admit that I&#39;m on Book SIX (out of seven) of the Dark Tower <br/>
series by Stephen King. (Does this tie in with the thread on addiction? <br/>
&lt;g&gt;). It isn&#39;t &quot;horror&quot; like other Stephen King books, from what I <br/>
understand, but it has its moments of creepy scary gory stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I listen to books - download them from Audible.com - because my eyes <br/>
are easily weakened and I choose to use the time I can read for reading <br/>
email lists - not books. It took me a while to get used to listening <br/>
and not reading - it wasn&#39;t a comfortable way for me to use a book - <br/>
but now I love it.  I take my little mp3 player with a book loaded in <br/>
it everywhere I go, it is always in my pocket or purse. And I&#39;ve <br/>
realized that listening, rather than reading myself, prevents me from <br/>
&quot;skimming&quot; (which is probably a habit learned from being a perpetual <br/>
graduate student and having to read FAR too much material - never able <br/>
to take the time to really savor anything) and so I&#39;m enjoying the <br/>
books more than I would have - and because there are some really GREAT <br/>
readers out there.<br/>
<br/>
Of books I&#39;ve listened to relatively recently - my favorite two were <br/>
&quot;The Painted House&quot; by John Grisham and &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot; by <br/>
Sue Monk Kidd.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and the entire &quot;Enders Game&quot; and &quot;Enders Shadow&quot; series - those <br/>
were wonderful.<br/>

racing along and missing the really pretty phrases and details and jokes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading Nicholas Nickleby which is taking a long time because it&#39;s long <br/>
and I only read in bed at night or when I&#39;m in a waiting room or something.  <br/>
But when it was written it was mailed in installments (kind of like some recent <br/>
Stephen King stuff, like The Green Mile), and it took them a year to read it, <br/>
so I&#39;m not really behind schedule. &lt;g&gt;  It was a soap opera.  So reading that <br/>
is kind of like my kids watching Season I of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  <br/>

I&#39;m an avid book on tape fan.  &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; on tape is  wonderful, <br/>
the reader has a beautiful southern drawl and does a different  &quot;voice&quot; for <br/>
each character.  Another I REALLY liked on tape was &quot;Memoirs of  a Geisha.&quot;  <br/>
Awesome,...very historically educational but really  entertaining too.  The <br/>
Harry Potter books on tape a real &quot;productions&quot;  ..the reader is WONDERFUL.<br/>
