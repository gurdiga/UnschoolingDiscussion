&lt;&lt; We cut out meat for a couple of weeks, but I was having a hard time <br/>
getting <br/>
 enough protien, (my blood sugar, energy, and mood were wild)  I love eggs <br/>
but <br/>
 can&#39;t eat them because my nursling has bouts of screaming and tummy pains, <br/>
if <br/>
 I eat them or take protien suppliments....he is not to bad with beans, but <br/>
 really how many beans can you really eat.... any suggestions....<br/>

Hi Julie,  maybe you and I should be low blood sugar partners!  :)  Can you <br/>
or your baby tolerate dairy foods?  If yes, there are some cheeses that have <br/>
excellent protein levels.  Milk has a decent amt of protein, but is still <br/>
higher in carbs.  But, if you can drink it, I would, and do, in fact.  Reg. <br/>
plain yogurt is another good choice.  It is not sweet, but you can sweeten it <br/>
up by adding some vanilla extract, sweet balance or stevia, and a  dash of <br/>
carob-- stir it up, and it is sort of like a chocolate dessert!  My oldest <br/>
son and I have some every day.  :)    Cottage cheese might be a good idea for <br/>
you to try, too.  When you get ready to go to bed at night, make sure to eat <br/>
a snack, like something mentioned above.  This will help keep the bsl <br/>
regulated, and help to prevent muscle cramps.  Other sources of protein are <br/>
soy foods, and soy milks-- some are pretty good; you have to experiment a <br/>
little.  Nuts and p-nut butter are also choices you can try.  There are <br/>
several brands of sugar free nut butters on the market-- some are better than <br/>
others.  We are using Smucker&#39;s right now.  Seafood is another good choice, <br/>
if you like it.  I love grilled shrimp. :)  Adding powdered milk to your <br/>
cooking will add extra protein to your dishes, too.    I am curious as to <br/>
what your specific lbs symptoms are.  Would you mind sharing?   Also, did you <br/>
get the recipes I posted a few days ago?   ~Karen</div>

&lt;&lt; Hi Julie,  maybe you and I should be low blood sugar partners!  :)&gt;&gt;yep I <br/>
think so too  Can you <br/>
 or your baby tolerate dairy foods?  I do okay with them.  Although, I am <br/>
noticing a few reaction starting.  DS does not do so well if I am not careful <br/>
and over eat on them. I can&#39;t eat enough it seems to help out that much.<br/>
<br/>
.  This will help keep the bsl  regulated, and help to prevent muscle cramps. <br/>
 Other sources of protein are <br/>
 soy foods, and soy milks-- some are pretty good; you have to experiment a <br/>
 little. &gt;&gt;  we are experimenting with these a little.  We may need to <br/>
investigate these more. Nuts and p-nut butter are also choices you can try. &gt;&gt;<br/>
I have to be careful with these too for my nursling &gt;&gt;  Seafood is another <br/>
good choice, <br/>
 if you like it.  I love grilled shrimp. :)&gt;&gt;I love shrimp and seafood, but <br/>
not the price.  Our budget can&#39;t handle it. &gt;&gt; Adding powdered milk to your <br/>
 cooking will add extra protein to your dishes, too.&gt;&gt;  Good idea! &gt;&gt; I am <br/>
curious as to  what your specific lbs symptoms are.  Would you mind sharing? <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  Sure  I don&#39;t mind sharing.....very moody, irritiable, edgy, jittery, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>muscle cramps, exhaustion (bigtime), sleeplessness.  I sure I have more but I <br/>
just can&#39; t think of them right now.  I did some investigating after your <br/>
message about finding out about LBS,  I have tons of symptoms.  I feel much <br/>
better now that I have cut out tons of sugar, but I am just not quite there <br/>
yet.,   Also, did you <br/>
 get the recipes I posted a few days ago&gt;&gt; yes thanks.  Keep them coming<br/>
<br/>
