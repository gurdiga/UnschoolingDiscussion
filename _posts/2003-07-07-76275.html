&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve tried to teach him to read and what&#39;s funnny is he knows the sounds <br/>
of letter, how to blend the sounds, but is blocking anything beyond that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not blocking, it&#39;s just a thing that happens when it happens, like <br/>
walking or talking.  He needs to have all the parts operational and you can&#39;t set <br/>
them into operation by pushing or pulling.  It&#39;s all brain-stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby could name letters when he was two but didnt read until 7/8.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s lots of reading-reading:<br/>

<br/>
We have a semi-structured other family nearby.  Their kids were pushed and <br/>
&quot;taught&quot; to read while Holly (who was a preemie but otherwise has no known <br/>
excuse for reading so late, being a girl and EVERYthing! &lt;bwg&gt;) just hung out and <br/>
sang and danced and watched movies and make puppets.  Then one month Holly <br/>
started reading and zoomed right by the other kids whose mom kept saying &quot;They&#39;re <br/>
reading now, they&#39;re reading 3rd grade level, they&#39;re reading 4th grade level, <br/>
oh, they&#39;re grounded because they didn&#39;t read&quot; (whatever all noise was coming <br/>
about it) and Holly kind of magically and suddenly read better than they did. <br/>
 She never read &quot;2nd grade level&quot; nor any such thing.  She lived until <br/>
reading was easy and then she read real things.<br/>
