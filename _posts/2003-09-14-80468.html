<div id="ygrps-yiv-901586544"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;The local mom of the hitting boy just seemed oblivious to whether she was <br/>
 </span></blockquote>being hit or not.  She ignored him about the same way whether he was hitting her <br/>
or not, and when she did pay attention to him, it was fawning mush like he was <br/>
a baby instead of an increasingly dangerous bigger boy (9 or 10).   He wasn&#39;t <br/>
even getting mixed messages, he was getting just about NO messages.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
See, I see this as a misinterpretation of what we, as parents, are supposed to do as an alternative to the &#39;old ways&#39; of parenting our children. (&quot;If your child is having a tantrum, walk away, ignore it, don&#39;t pay it any attention&quot;). Time was, if a kid behaved that way, he ended up with a spanking or a &#39;lickin&#39;&#39;. You can&#39;t do that nowadays (good thing, too), but no one tells you what *to* do. <br/>
This woman, imo, is trying to handle her kids&#39; behaviour that way, and doesn&#39;t realize that it&#39;s past that point with him, and that she needs to do something else.<br/>
OR...she is just sick and tired and exhausted and can&#39;t deal with it, so she has given up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If I got angry enough to start yelling at someone, I think it would be nicer <br/>
 </span></blockquote>if friends of mine, or my husband, or my kids, ushered me to another place and <br/>
helped me calm down rather than just backed up and let me &quot;get it all out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It would damage my own self worth and my own peace for me to have a fit like <br/>
that.  It would damage my reputation and my ability to be with those people <br/>
again in the future.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
But you are an adult, who (barring some kind of mental illness) is fully capable of choosing whether or not to behave this way. A child is, well...a child.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;The sheeplike tendency of human society soon makes inroads on a child&#39;s unsophistications, and then popular education completes the dastardly work with its systematic formulas, and away goes the individual, hurtling through space into that hateful oblivion of mediocrity. We are pruned into stumps, one resembling another, without character or grace.&quot; --- NC Wyeth, father of Andrew Wyeth, Artist/Painter, who was home educated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And even MORE dependent on his/her parents to take care of his <br/>
well-being. All the more reason for the parents not to just let things <br/>
happen - to intervene on behalf of all the children - including the one <br/>
who seems to be the cause.<br/>
<br/>
AND - I say seems to be because often the one that acts out the MOST is <br/>
not the one who is causing the problem. The other kids often know how <br/>
to push that kids quick-trigger buttons and, imo, if they KNOW they&#39;re <br/>
doing it and do it anyway - that is cruel on their part and needs to be <br/>
addressed, too.<br/>
  That&#39;s one reason why placing blame is not productive - sometimes I <br/>
found it helped to physically put ourselves into positions so we are <br/>
all facing the same direction - side-by-side - to talk. The reason is <br/>
that face-to-face tends to be more adversarial sometimes.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s easier to make choices from an array of options than to just do the only <br/>
thing you&#39;ve ever done.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT a choice if a child isn&#39;t shown options.<br/>

I have one child, now a 7 yo, who is more challenging than any other child I<br/>
have ever personally met.  I am grateful every single day that she is who<br/>
she is, or our family would most likely be another crib-using,<br/>
public-schooling family.  With listening to her true needs, we&#39;ve become<br/>
radical unschoolers.  :)  That said, I&#39;m always looking for new suggestions<br/>
on how best *I* can personally deal with her outbursts without losing my<br/>
cool or treating her in a disrespectful way.  In public, I have found myself<br/>
sitting on a bench not touching her and definitely NOT looking at her, and<br/>
having her calm down much more quickly than I&#39;ve expected.  At the time I<br/>
though it was a fluck.  But, looking back I can see that maybe the way we<br/>
were sitting was the solution.  I&#39;ve never tried this at home.  She gets<br/>
insulted if you look at her, insulted if you talk to her, insulted if she is<br/>
truly left alone, etc.  This sitting close, but not looking is a great<br/>
middle ground.  Wonderful advice.<br/>

It&#39;s not about outbursts, but the side-by-side communications suggestions <br/>
there surely won&#39;t make any bad situations worse, and can greatly help everyday <br/>
communications within a family.<br/>
