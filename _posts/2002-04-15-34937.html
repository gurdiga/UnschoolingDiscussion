<div id="ygrps-yiv-708464934">I just read this to my 14 year old, and she nearly came out of her skin, she would very much like to know more about this....I had thought she would need the GED...can you tell me the difference, if any....and where she can obtain the CHSPE handbook/studybook/whatever book LOL...<br/>

Thanks in advance<br/>

<br/>
  By the way, she did take the CHSPE (California High School Proficiency Exam) <br/>
  and passed - math, reading, and writing are included - so that gave her a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906609912">When I lived in California you could not take the test before age 16.  My<br/>
oldest daughter wanted to take it and quit high school and go to college (I<br/>
think the was the first year the test was available 1977).  I was told it<br/>
was real hard to pass so i told her okay, IF you pass you can drop high<br/>
school.  I did not expect her to pass.  She did pass, she did drop out of<br/>
high school and she did NOT ever go to college.  Wouldn&#39;t ya know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742225634">I did just go to the site, and it does state <br/>
&quot;<br/>
You may take CHSPE if, on testing day, you: <br/>
<br/>
  a.. are 16 or older, (no upper age limit) or <br/>
  b.. have completed at least one academic year of the tenth grade, or <br/>
  c.. are enrolled in the second semester of tenth grade. <br/>
There is no limit to the number of times you may take the test. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because I unschool, and am a registered private school in the state of california, I see no reason that I can not simply state on the form she is enrolled in the second semester of 10th grade?<br/>

So - for homeschoolers, that isn&#39;t an issue because we just put their grade <br/>
level as second semester 10th grade, no matter how old they are. For a kid in <br/>
school, it is not going to be an option until they really are in the second <br/>
semester of 10th grade or 16, whichever comes first.<br/>

worked for her all the way around.  Do you know what year they started<br/>
giving it,,,doesn&#39;t matter just checking how good my memory is.(or bad)<br/>
