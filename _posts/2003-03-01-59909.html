<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902655197">Hello, <br/>
Laura, <br/>
How do did you get your son in to a <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;floating <br/>
apprentice for a computer company, building systems, loading software, <br/>
and <br/>
working at the front desk with customers&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My son is 14 and big into computers. He makes movies and cartoons as well as cards.  I was thinking maybe I could get him to work/Vol. at a computer place near here where we live.<br/>
<br/>
He is still De-schooling and he hates it in one moment and then tells me all the wonderful things he is doing.<br/>
<br/>
He tells me he could do every thing he is doing know and still be in school.<br/>
<br/>
I think he is concerned about what his father might think sense his father told him that once.<br/>
<br/>
De-schooling may not be as easy as I would like it to be. My son wants to go to collage and now says he can not go because he will not get a GED or a diploma.<br/>
<br/>
I told him that there are a lot of homeschoolers who go to collage with out them.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I was right. He does not forget anything.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you or anyone have any input for me. Or info on how I might get him a job at a computer store. He has to penny saver routes and whats another job. Money has always been a big deal with him. He saves most all of what he gets.<br/>
<br/>
THANKS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Happy St. Patrick&#39;s Day!!<br/>

Hi Marie --<br/>
<br/>
Sorry it&#39;s taken me so long to get back to you.  Kinda hairy around <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I didn&#39;t get him into anything.  He did it himself.  I came <br/>
home from errands one day, and he informed me that he&#39;d been calling <br/>
around to used computer stores, looking for old components that <br/>
they&#39;d be willing to let him have to mess around with.  He had a list <br/>
of three places in the area to go to, and when we visited he let them <br/>
know that he&#39;d be willing to work around their places for no pay -- <br/>
just for the opportunity to look over shoulders and learn a thing or <br/>
two.  The last place took him up on it.  I was absolutely floored at <br/>
his maturity and presence.  He&#39;d just come out of the first part of <br/>
his deschooling phase and took me completely by surprise.<br/>
<br/>
He worked at that store for four months until it went under, then got <br/>
a letter of reference from the owner, which he used to find himself <br/>
another job -- this time with a larger company that builds new <br/>
systems and operates largely online.  He helps them to assemble <br/>
systems and install software, and has begun working at the front desk <br/>
helping cutomers to customize their own systems.  It&#39;s pretty <br/>
awesome.  As a bonus, he&#39;s working with a Chinese immigrant who <br/>
speaks very little English and who is teaching him some beginning <br/>
Chinese -- a language that has fascinated him for a long time.  It&#39;s <br/>
amazing to me what happens when we just let these kids go after <br/>
they&#39;ve been imprisoned by the system for so long.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend perhaps that you let him read this message, and <br/>
show him the phone book.  Let him know you&#39;ll drive him wherever he <br/>
wants to go, when he&#39;s ready, that you&#39;ll go in with him if he wants <br/>
or will sit in the car on your hands and biting your tongue if that&#39;s <br/>
what he prefers.  If he hasn&#39;t already, have him read over the <br/>
sections of the Teenage Liberation Handbook that deal with mentoring, <br/>
apprenticeship and volunteering.  Those were quite inspirational to <br/>
my ds.  Remember, there&#39;s no money in this.  It&#39;s for experience.  <br/>
And part of the experience is going after the apprenticeship.  It&#39;s <br/>
amazing how many people, who are in love with what they do, really <br/>
take to the idea of sharing that love with an eager and industrious <br/>
young person.  It makes everyone feel good.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
Laura B.</div>
