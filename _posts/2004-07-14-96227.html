<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779770340">I sent this to the Tennessee Commissioner of human and social services where <br/>
their company is based, and where they live. I also sent the same letter to <br/>
20/20, Primetime Live, and other news stations. <br/>

<br/>
Dear Commissioner,<br/>
<br/>
I would to bring attention to a publication that is offered by a company by <br/>
name of <br/>
No Greater Joy Ministries, Inc. 1000 Pearl RD  Pleasantville, TN 37033, and <br/>
authored by this company&#39;s owners, Michael & Debi Pearl. The name of this book <br/>
is &quot;To Train Up A Child&quot;, and is nothing more than a guide on how to severely <br/>
abuse a child. The contents of this book is shocking and disturbing. I can&#39;t <br/>
believe that it&#39;s been in publication for 10 years, and is available to <br/>
impressionable parents around the world. I beg you to read this book and see for <br/>
yourself. To get an idea of the horrific advice given in this book I have included <br/>
some examples from the pages of the book below:<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
Examples: <br/>
<br/>
1) The Pearls recommend whipping infants only a few months old on their bare <br/>
skin. They whip their own 4 month old (p.9). They recommend whipping the bare <br/>
skin of &quot;every child&quot; (p.2) for &quot;Christians and non-Christians&quot; (p.5) and for <br/>
&quot;every transgression&quot; (p.1). Parents who don&#39;t whip their babies into complete <br/>
submission are portrayed as indifferemt, lazy, careless and neglectful (p.19) <br/>
and are &quot;creating a Nazi&quot; (p.45).<br/>
<br/>
2) On p.60 they recommend whipping babies who cannot sleep and are crying, <br/>
and to never allow them &quot;to get up.&quot; On p.61 they recommend whipping a 12 month <br/>
old girl for crying. On p.79 they recommend whipping a 7 month old for <br/>
screaming.<br/>
<br/>
 3) On p.65 co-author Debi Pearl whips the bare leg of a 15 month old she is <br/>
babysitting, 10 separate times, for not playing with something she tells him <br/>
to play with. On p.56 Debi Pearl hits a 2 your old so hard &quot;a karate chop like <br/>
wheeze came from somewhere deep inside&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
 4) On p.59 they recommend whipping a 3 year old until he is &quot;totally <br/>
broken.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
5) On p.44 they say not to let the child&#39;s crying while being hit to &quot;cause <br/>
you to lighten up on the intensity or duration of the spanking.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
6) On p.55 the Pearls say a mother should hit her child if he cries for her.<br/>
<br/>
 7) On p.80 they recommend giving a child having a tantrum &quot;a swift <br/>
*forceful* spanking.&quot; On the same page they say to whip small children on their bare <br/>
skin until they stop screaming. &quot;Don&#39;t be bullied. Give him more of the same.&quot; <br/>
They say to continue whipping until their crying turns into a &quot;wounded, <br/>
submissive whimper.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
8) On p.46 the Pearls say that if a child does obey before being whipped, <br/>
whip them anyway. And &quot;if you have to sit on him to spank him,then do not <br/>
hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are bigger, <br/>
tougher.&quot; &quot;Defeat him totally.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
9) On p.47 they recommend their various whips, including &quot;a belt or larger <br/>
tree branch&quot; to hit children. <br/>
<br/>
10) The Pearls also recommend ignoring an infant&#39;s bumped head when he falls <br/>
to the floor, and ignoring skinned knees (p.86). They also say &quot;if your child <br/>
is roughed-up by peers, rejoice.&quot; (p.81)<br/>
<br/>
 11) They recommend pulling a nursing infant&#39;s hair (p.7), tripping a <br/>
non-swimming toddler so she falls into deep water (p.67) and to make children go <br/>
hungry if they don&#39;t &quot;like what is on the table&quot; (p.103). Also on p.103 they say <br/>
that if children lose their shoes, &quot;let them go without until they (the <br/>
children) can make the money to buy more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can only hope that you will look into this publication and the company and <br/>
owners/authors who provide this piece of hateful and abusive propaganda, and <br/>
have it removed from the hands of our society. If these examples are not enough <br/>
then you can always go to amazon.com and read the hundreds of reviews from <br/>
people who are equally as disturbed as I am. <br/>
I have sent copies of this same letter to many new organizations including <br/>
20/20 and Primetime Live, and can only hope to shed as much light as possible on <br/>
this book and it&#39;s authors.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Elaine Nichols<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467622066">Good for you Elaine! I hope you succeed. I was a part of a campaign to expose the Ezzos <br/>

spanking, even a single swap to a padded diaper area with an open hand might<br/>
be called &quot;getting a whipping&quot;.<br/>

Well... much as I hate this book and everything this author stands for, I&#39;m <br/>
pretty grateful that the laws of our country won&#39;t allow the state of Tennessee <br/>
or any other government to &quot;have it removed from the hands of our society&quot;. <br/>
Free speech is only really free if it applies to everyone, especially to speech <br/>
we hate.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, exposing hateful speech to the light of day as much as <br/>
possible is a good thing, or at least we can hope so, and hope that if any news <br/>
organization does decide to pick up on the story they leave homeschooling out <br/>
of it. <br/>
