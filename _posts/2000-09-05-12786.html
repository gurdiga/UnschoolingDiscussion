&gt; That&#39;s it.  Now I know what I want to be when I grow up!  A weather<br/>
person.<br/>
&gt;  Think about it, they get paid the big bucks (not the guys on the tv but<br/>
&gt; the ones who put the info together for them) and they don&#39;t get demoted or<br/>
&gt; earn anything less if they are wrong more than 50% of the time!  Now<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s the ultimate goldbrick job with security cause no one ever expects<br/>
&gt; them to be really right or on the money with their predictions!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511947261">This reminds me of a rather funny story.  On a business trip, DH had <br/>
to go visit the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.noaa.gov/">http://www.noaa.gov/</a> .  One of the guys there told him that congress <br/>
wanted to get rid of NOAA .  Well, he told him, they couldn&#39;t.  The <br/>
congressmen told him, they didn&#39;t need that organization any more, <br/>
that they could just get the weather reports from the Weather <br/>
Channel.  He said, &quot;Sir, that is where the weather channel gets their <br/>
information!&quot;!!!  True story!<br/>
<br/>
Kim--Southern California, where it is 84 degrees with a gentle breeze <br/>
and rather nice today!<br/>

&gt; We relocated back to Maryland from Texas just a little over a year ago.<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; left in June of 1999 and there were water restrictions at that time - like<br/>
&gt; not washing your car - but nothing like I have seen on the news lately.<br/>
Back<br/>
&gt; here in Maryland though, it seems we can;t get out from under the clouds.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; know you need rain and if I could send it I would.  I feel water logged!<br/>
