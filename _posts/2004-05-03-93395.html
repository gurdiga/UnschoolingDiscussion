I recently read an article, by a mother in Home School Digest, who <br/>
trained her babies to sit still in her lap. She would start with five <br/>
minutes, and as they improved, she would increase the time until they <br/>
were able to sit quietly in her lap for hours. She would lightly spank <br/>
her child, and teach them to wait until she said they could get down. <br/>
Her children learned early to trust and obey their parents. <br/>

<br/>
Interesting use of &quot;trust,&quot; but &quot;trust and obey&quot; is a fundamentalist idiom <br/>
(there&#39;s a song by that name) and the God they&#39;re trusting is the God of smiting <br/>
and vengeance and eternal fiery pits.  <br/>
<br/>
Home School Digest is the darkest, dreariest, scariest homeschooling thing <br/>
I&#39;ve ever seen.  The covers are in black and white and have scary dark images.  <br/>
A man&#39;s hand on a plow handle.  An upward shot of a 19th century school&#39;s bell <br/>
tower with storm clouds behind it... stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
Probably not the covers, but some of the articles, are here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschooldigest.com/">http://www.homeschooldigest.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
(Ah... it seems the covers might be in color now; they show one in color, and <br/>
one scary one in black and white, but TYPICALLY it&#39;s about dads, because <br/>
they&#39;re the heads of their households, they&#39;re the principles of their <br/>
homeschools, they are the representative of God in the home and so must be trusted and <br/>
obeyed.)<br/>
<br/>
There are links to Christian anti-spanking sites you might want to pass on <br/>
there.  You could find some with Google, but there&#39;s at least one here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking">http://sandradodd.com/spanking</a><br/>
<br/>
That link itself probably wouldn&#39;t go over well if it&#39;s a Christian list.  <br/>
Man of them think unschooling is ungodly, and that secular homeschoolers are <br/>
HUMANISTS (which they can&#39;t tell from satanists).  If it&#39;s a general list, maybe <br/>
you could share that.<br/>
<br/>
Heck of a scary magazine.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another newer, brighter but still scary one:  The Old Schoolhouse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741619529">A few years ago I &#39;left&#39; a local new Zealand list after flaming - we&#39;re <br/>
talking serious flame thrower useage here - after an even more detailed <br/>
description of how to train your baby to sit on a squre of material, <br/>
details of how hard to smack them, how many times, etc etc.  I wanted to <br/>
be on the list because at the time it was the place to find out what was <br/>
happening in NZ homeschooling.  The owner of the moderated list stopped <br/>
my posts after a couple of third degree burn posts, but also stopped <br/>
hers despite the fact that he is a  defender of smacking - in theory. <br/>
 He e-mailed me privately and was very torn - in principle he was on her <br/>
side, but his heart cried NO.  (From what I have seen of him, he&#39;s a <br/>
very much loved and unfeared father to his kids, so I&#39;m pretty sure he <br/>
doesn&#39;t put his money where his mouth is in respect to smacking.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I could not sit back and say nothing to this abusing mother <br/>
of babies - if I&#39;d known her when she had had babies I would have set <br/>
the welfare authorities on her, but her children were all older by then, <br/>
and sufficiently destroyed to no longer need beating.  I flamed her, and <br/>
badly.  What she had done, and was promoting to others was, I believe, <br/>
nothing short of evil.  I could not let it pass unquestioned.  I left <br/>
the list, and I got a lot of emails in support.<br/>
<br/>
I knew that this woman would never change, but my hope is that even just <br/>
one other person was shocked enough by what I said to rethink their <br/>
position.  I certainly felt I had to try.<br/>

either!)! Trust and obey, my hiney-more like FEAR and obey! Been there, done <br/>
that-I don&#39;t want MY kids fearing me-how can you trust someone you fear?! If I sat <br/>
and thought about it, I probably wouldn&#39;t bring myself to say something, but <br/>
if I&#39;m irritated enough to write something right away, she sure would get an <br/>

If you don&#39;t feel like you want to express your opinion you could provide<br/>
links to anti spanking sites and to the no-spanking list, and the people<br/>
who&#39;d like to look could do so. <br/>
<br/>
If you do want to speak out you may not change that mothers mind, but you<br/>
might make someone else think about it.  You might make one mom question<br/>
what she thinks she knows about living with kids and that might make a<br/>
difference.  <br/>
<br/>
Whatever you decide, flare ups on lists eventually die down and move on<br/>
to something else.  It&#39;ll be fine in a couple days (unless they kick you<br/>
off. &lt;g&gt;)  You might forever have the rabid anti spanking reputation<br/>
there but, you know, in some circles that&#39;s an admirable quality. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

respond strongly but calmly, you might influence some people or at <br/>
least get them to think about it. If you &quot;yell&quot;, people who agree <br/>
with you may cheer you on, but you probably won&#39;t make any headway <br/>
with those who disagree.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been working on taking the long view and just trying to open <br/>
people&#39;s eyes to other ways of thinking. So when a friend talked <br/>
about how so-and-so should let her baby cry, I said that I don&#39;t let <br/>
babies cry if I can help. There are times when I can&#39;t help them and <br/>
that&#39;s enough crying time--she thinks babies &quot;need to cry.&quot; She also <br/>
spanks and tends to be very strict and I&#39;ve just been sharing my <br/>
different ways. And I was so suprised when she told me she&#39;d been <br/>
being more patient with her son because of things I&#39;ve said! <br/>
<br/>
I spend so much time reading, writing and thinking about parenting. I <br/>
want to believe it&#39;s not just for the sake of my kids, but also so <br/>
that I can help other people. If you really want to help someone, you <br/>
have to be aware of where they are and what they are open to hearing. <br/>
Hmmm, where have I heard that before???<br/>

I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get her to admit to changing.  If she changes, she&#39;ll go <br/>
elsewhere and not say &quot;I changed.&quot;  But if you say strong, real things, she <br/>
will never again be able to spank without a little twinge of doubt, or guilt, <br/>
or the feeling that people are looking over her shoulder, and not everyone <br/>
would defend her.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s a worthy thing to do to people who are really, truly <br/>
inflicting violence and pain on little children in the name of God.<br/>

How many more spankings do you want to take partial credit for if you just <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-966246167">Part of it is the situation--I know she&#39;s not spanking her son any <br/>
more, but she will have a daughter soon. It&#39;s not the same as <br/>
watching her spank her son while I take the long view.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it, though, is that I&#39;m pretty darn sure that she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
stop spanking or even think much about it if I stated my views on the <br/>
subject. If she&#39;s not listening and tunes me out, I&#39;m not doing <br/>
anything but listening to myself talk. She started off thinking that <br/>
I was very lenient and permissive and now she&#39;s seeing my parenting <br/>
in a better light and being influenced by me. I will continue <br/>
plugging away because I think in this situation, that&#39;s what might <br/>
get her to not spank her daughter in a couple years.<br/>

family and experiences, it&#39;s a very good idea to respond, in my <br/>
opinion. You will probably not change the attitude or actions of <br/>
the poster, but the surprising fact that children can be treated <br/>
with kindness and respect and &quot;turn out&quot; just fine will benefit <br/>
many of the other members of the list, including no doubt many <br/>
lurkers.<br/>

I had to make that decision recently ... one mom at a hs activity was <br/>
BRAGGING about being able to threaten her 18mo old BABY into <br/>
compliance after the sound spanking she gave him a few weeks <br/>
before.  &quot;He&#39;s very intelligent, I only had to spank him once, he now <br/>
knows I mean it&quot;  I couldn&#39;t help imagining the same conversation <br/>
happening in a garage between men, about my daughter, &quot;she&#39;s an <br/>
intelligent one...only had to smack her once, now she listens to <br/>
me.&quot;  <br/>
I HAD to say something, express my own remorse over having raised my <br/>
hand to a child in anger, let her know that options are available <br/>
between *sweetie-pie* voices and a smack to the bottom.  She used <br/>
the &quot;but he&#39;ll just run into the street if I don&#39;t&quot; arguement, so I <br/>
used the example given here about a child choosing to take their risk <br/>
with the scary street over the crazed spank-o-matic mommy. &lt;beg&gt; (I <br/>
do love that quote!) She was horribly offended (though *I* wasn&#39;t <br/>
allowed to be offended by her admission of violence!) and I <br/>
considered apologizing for several days ... then I realized I will <br/>
NEVER be sorry for making her think of me and my passion against <br/>
spanking every time she raises her hand to Jake.  <br/>

&quot;On another network&quot; (in another place) someone defending restricting some TV <br/>

them heroin?&quot;  The shockers that I guess people will think we&#39;ve never heard and <br/>
never considered and that are good logic.<br/>

I had never thought about it before this car-key mention, but my keys have <br/>
hung in plain view (on the refrigerator door) all of Kirby&#39;s life, and so all of <br/>
Marty&#39;s life and all of Holly&#39;s life.  None of them has ever tried to drive <br/>

is that you keep the keys hidden, it&#39;s possible you&#39;re wrong. <br/>
<br/>
People have come up with some of the weirdest theories, haven&#39;t they?  And <br/>
the weirdest justifications for limiting children or hurting them.  They&#39;re <br/>
saving them from a life of driving vans over OTHER kids whose parent failed to <br/>
spank them and so the street is full of unspanked chidren being run over by <br/>
children whose parents let them watch TV and get hold of car keys.<br/>
<br/>
What a world, what a world.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, it exists in the imaginations of parents who have come to like being <br/>
mean to kids &quot;for their own good.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
I think that trust is important. I suppose that if painful training were the<br/>
only way to gain trust, we&#39;d just have to do it. But I&#39;m glad there are<br/>
other ways to inspire trust in a child! :-) And they&#39;re not much different<br/>
than ways that we gain trust from adults, like being trustworthy and honest,<br/>
and treating people with respect. Children are people after all! And I think<br/>
that if it&#39;s something that I wouldn&#39;t want another human being to do to me,<br/>
it&#39;s not something I&#39;d do to my child.<br/>
<br/>
If my husband slapped me for wiggling until I didn&#39;t wiggle for an hour, I<br/>
might act as though I trusted him. It might look to other people as though I<br/>
trusted him. But I&#39;d be obeying because I feared him. I&#39;m not sure why<br/>
people believe that children have different emotional reactions than adults<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
I also think obedience is overrated. Of course I do want my child to listen<br/>
when I yell &quot;Stop!&quot; And she does because she rarely hears a loud command so<br/>
&quot;Stop!&quot; does get her immediate attention.<br/>
<br/>
And I do want her to listen when I am giving her advice. Just as I&#39;d want my<br/>
husband or a friend to listen. And I do that by being a trustworthy person<br/>
that they want to listen to.<br/>
<br/>
But in other matters I&#39;d much rather model ways to work out conflicts that<br/>
my daughter could be using herself to resolve conflicts with others. She&#39;s<br/>
looking to me as a role model so I want to be the person I would like her to<br/>
be. If I in my &quot;infinite parental wisdom&quot; choose to resolve conflicts with<br/>
my child by being bigger and stronger and inspiring of fear, then why<br/>
shouldn&#39;t I expect her to emulate making someone do what she wants when she<br/>
has conflicts with others? I need to show her something better than more<br/>
powerful means you get to decide what&#39;s right for others.<br/>

Joyce&#39;s posts are always so different, anc clear.  They&#39;re not often the way <br/>
I had considered something,  and I&#39;m so glad she&#39;s back from her <br/>
other-busyness these days!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Children are people after all! And I think<br/>
that if it&#39;s something that I wouldn&#39;t want another human being to do to me,<br/>
it&#39;s not something I&#39;d do to my child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once  person is to that point, would it be too harsh to consider not doing <br/>
something to one&#39;s child we wouldn&#39;t want another adult (another relative, or <br/>
friend, or stranger!) doing?  Picking a kid up and slapping his ass four or five <br/>
times and threatening to give him something to cry about if he doesn&#39;t shut <br/>
up?   Putting our child in a room and saying &quot;If you come out you&#39;ll be sorry?&quot; <br/>
  (I think that&#39;s a felony, if strangers do it.  Kidnapping.  Right up there <br/>
with murder.)<br/>
<br/>
It seems extreme, but it&#39;s just one more step.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also think obedience is overrated. Of course I do want my child to listen<br/>

<br/>
If I were about to step into a roadway and ANY voice yelled &quot;stop,&quot; I would <br/>
stop.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s moving into the &quot;it takes a village&quot; arena, but I don&#39;t care.  <br/>
Someone else&#39;s baby is sitting in my lap right this moment, who wasn&#39;t supposed <br/>
to be here for another three hours.  Kirby spent an hour last night with <br/>
another adult (his karate teacher), talking about movies.  I had no idea where he <br/>
was at first, and was a little worried (and friends of his were here waiting <br/>
for him to get home), but when he told me where he&#39;d been I thought it was a <br/>
better place and better time-use than if he had rushed right home.<br/>
<br/>
It might take a village to give a child all the experiences he needs to be <br/>
whole and grown, but it only takes one to break his spirit and abuse his soul.  <br/>
Isn&#39;t it sad when that one is his mom, or his dad?<br/>

never really thought about it but the list owner on that other list is a <br/>
Christian Patriarch?  If I have that term wrong, sorry.  It is a varied list, but <br/>
I&#39;ll have to choose my words well, I think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen the Home School Digest.  I think I may not want to.<br/>

when I realized that the tone of the owner/moderator was harsh towards children.  <br/>
But they are his views as the patriarch of his family and usually the <br/>
discussions are wonderful, all walks of life, etc.  But I have begun to see the owner <br/>
bring up more stuff like this and it justs freaks me out.  I may very well <br/>
have to leave that list for personal reasons not because of what I might say.  <br/>
EEEEKKKKK!!!!  I just don&#39;t know how to meet anyone in my area so I was kinda <br/>
holding on to that list in hopes of finding some people in this area.<br/>

the kids were very little, babies love keys (they must taste good too)!!!  <br/>
Well, my DS (2.5) has recently started asking if he could drive the van and he <br/>

hide the keys now, NO :0) <br/>

Yesterday Mia (5yrs) had asked where the keys were, as she needed to get<br/>
something out of the car. I told her where they were and went on with what I<br/>
was doing. I didn&#39;t see her take them or put them back. This morning I went<br/>
to get them so I could take Mark to work and I couldn&#39;t find them. I went in<br/>
to Mia&#39;s room and woke her. She said she had put them back on the breakfast<br/>
bar but I hadn&#39;t seen them so I asked her where exactly. She told me (half<br/>
asleep) she had put them on our yearbook, (which I had moved while<br/>
searching). Sure enough there they were between the pages. We got out to the<br/>
car. She had left the loose change sitting in there undisturbed and<br/>
remembered to lock the car when she was done.<br/>
