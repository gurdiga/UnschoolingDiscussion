over-stimulated and that he needed to be taken to a quieter situation <br/>
- perhaps to a bedroom alone w/ you.  i&#39;m not big on separating (i.e. <br/>
time-outs) but it is hard not send a child into another room alone <br/>
when one has many children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes and doubly hard when this is my oldest and I can&#39;t very well leave the baby to his own devices while brother calms down.  Also his over-stimulation often happens when it is just he and I, or his brother and him, or the three of us.  No tv, no radio on, no telephone ringing, a quiet street/neighborhood, and maybe 1 neighbor child to play with, occassionally.  He is Soooooooo sensative.  He needs to be alone, IMHO, because he was already with us and that was too much apparently.  I hate to imagine what would happen if I was going to send him to school.  Good thing I decided to homeschool before he was ever concieved.<br/>

homeschool, and knew his spirit needed more space than school <br/>
allows.  If you believe you choose your life...<br/>
<br/>
Just a stray thought...<br/>
