<div id="ygrps-yiv-427321175">I was wondering if anyone here could help me. My son, Sean, was <br/>
researching Niccolo Machiavelli because that is the name tatooed on <br/>
the rapper 2Pac. He found this reference to him: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Machiavelli is buried in the church of Santa Croce at Florence, <br/>
beside the tomb of Michael Angelo. His monument bears this <br/>
inscription: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tanto nomini nullum par eulogium.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And though this praise is doubtless exaggerated, he is a son of whom <br/>
his country may be justly proud. Hugo Albert Rennert.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t know what the words in Latin mean. He tried all kinds of <br/>
online translators but he couldn&#39;t find any free Latin ones. Does <br/>
anyone here know what those words mean? <br/>
<br/>
PS--another cool connection. While Sean was researching this he asked <br/>
me if he could get a book written by Machiavelli called &quot;The Prince&quot;. <br/>
Later that day, while watching the cartoon Family Guy, Stewie the <br/>
baby was reading it! <br/>

love Latin around here!<br/>

Over his remains there stands a stately monument bearing the words &quot;Tanto<br/>
nomini nullum par elogium&quot; (No eulogy would do justice to so great a name).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563843326">Thanks, Tim and Lillian.  My son will be glad you found out for him.  He googled for a long time and couldn&#39;t find the translator, but I think he was looking for a language translator and not philosophy.  It makes all the difference what phrase you type into the blank in Google.<br/>
