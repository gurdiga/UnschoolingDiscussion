<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833475894">I have a friend who has 3 kids - the oldest is &#39;gifted&#39; (Katherine) , her middle girl has learning difficulties (Carolyn) and the youngest is essentially unknown (she&#39;s 3).<br/>
<br/>
My friend, Tina  would love to know if anyone has experience unschooling kids with such different needs.<br/>
<br/>
Tina is IMO sort of anti-homeschooling and she really doesn&#39;t &#39;get&#39; unschooling.  I&#39;d like to open her eyes a bit to the wonders of unschooling and how it can / does work for all children.  I however, only have one child and very little unschooling experience so I&#39;m hoping you all can give me some input.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of her comments:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t think I could ever try to teach Carolyn at home, because we *butt heads* too much over her school work now.<br/>
She has some learning difficulties, and the school is much better able to handle her needs that I would ever be.<br/>
In her case I would have to spend all my time and energy helping her, that I feel it wouldn&#39;t be fair to my other 2.<br/>
<br/>
Also, what about kids who are *gifted*? Katherine is learning so much at school, and in her Enrichment class. She is learning stuff that is beyond her *grade level* in this class. Stuff that I&#39;m amazed that she is learning and doing.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just curious if parents have come across having 2 children with such vast learning differences and how do they make it work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
to be honest, I think *all* kids have different needs.  When you unschool, their needs just naturally get met because you work at it together in a cooperative way.<br/>
<br/>
She worries about getting along with one of her kids, but how does she get along outside of school?  And if the child does not have to be fit into a particular &quot;box&quot;, she might *not* have so many learning problems.<br/>
<br/>
And there is nothing stopping the &quot;gifted&quot; child from continuing to learn whatever she is interested as in depth as she likes.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is kinda short...I&#39;m trying to get ready for a camping trip, but I&#39;ve got 3 kids with different needs at different ages, and we do ok here :o).<br/>

That was my worry also. I was so concerned with doing what the teacher said <br/>
and panicking over grades. It was crazy.  <br/>

In September of this year after Deschooling (again) I took him to sylvan <br/>
hoping to have that as use for his end of year evaluation.  His word comprehension <br/>
was well over grade 6 students according to the standards listed on the test <br/>
results.  Just from Deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
He was reading Dick and Jane books in yr. 3 of school when I took him out.  <br/>
Now year 5 (for the purpose of gauging) he reads Novels and fully understands <br/>
what is read. I never tell him to read he does it on his own.  That in itself <br/>
was worth Unschooling to me.  I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to love <br/>
reading.<br/>
All from a child the school said was LD and stuffed in the resource room and <br/>
given stickers, candy bars and toys to get him to read. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of a conversation I had with my sisters daughter last night. <br/>
She is quick to pick things up and has taken several college classes. She is <br/>
still in HS. She has been very curious about Homeschooling/Unschooling and asks <br/>
questions when we talk.<br/>
She is failing her Algebra 2/Trig class and is going to retake it in college. <br/>
She had enough credits to graduate at the beginning of the second half.<br/>
<br/>
Problem is she knows how to do it she has just has had enough of certain <br/>
teachers.<br/>
She told me that she wished she could choose her direction rather than being <br/>
forced and plans to Home/Unschool her own kids (when she has them). However <br/>
she wishes she could but would never tell my sister that. Sad....<br/>
<br/>
I think children that are considered *gifted* have way too much pressure in <br/>
school and they too would benefit from being at home.<br/>
Her second oldest has a very high IQ was failing this year because he didn&#39;t <br/>
want the other kids to think he was a geek. The school system put him in the <br/>
ALT school for three months to punish him. (wonder why, did his score bring up <br/>
the schools score. maybe, maybe not?) <br/>
So tell your friend to consider it she may find that it actually lesson the <br/>
family&#39;s stress.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have a friend who has 3 kids - the oldest is &#39;gifted&#39; (Katherine) , her <br/>
middle girl has learning difficulties (Carolyn) and the youngest is <br/>
essentially unknown (she&#39;s 3). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew my kids really well by the time they were three. <br/>
Where has this unknown child been living!?   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, what about kids who are *gifted*? Katherine is learning so much at <br/>
school, and in her Enrichment class. She is learning stuff that is beyond her <br/>
*grade level* in this class. Stuff that I&#39;m amazed that she is learning and <br/>
doing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If school is so great for her, why is the mom interested in homeschooling at <br/>
all?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m just curious if parents have come across having 2 children with such <br/>
vast learning differences and how do they make it work.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tell her with unschooling it doesn&#39;t matter one whit who&#39;s &quot;ahead&quot; or <br/>
&quot;behind&quot; or in what order things are discovered.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some stuff for her to read<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/specialunschooling">http://sandradodd.com/specialunschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
but she doesn&#39;t sound much like she wants to homeschool.  Explaining <br/>
unschooling to someone who thinks school is peachy is like trying to have an AA <br/>
meeting during a drinking contest at a downtown biker bar.   No sense in it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100986468">Ha!<br/>
<br/>
Never mind, I googled and got more info.<br/>
<br/>
It seems my strengths are interpersonal (which to me would include interpreting animal&#39;s social signals), and existentialist with a bit of others thrown in.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I just read the books &quot;Julie of the Wolves&quot; and &quot;Julie&#39;s Wolfpack&quot;.  Very good books!!  I really enjoyed all that I learned about wolves.  I&#39;m not sure how much of it is accurate, but I&#39;m guessing it is.  I want to get more books out on wolves and their social structure.  Its interesting to see my dog do a lot of the behaviors that are described in the books.  I know dogs are descendants of wolves.<br/>
<br/>
And I love my dog so much that I would just LOVE to see a pack of wolves interact the way its described in those books.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...naturalist would not be as much my cup of tea if it meant I had to classify things LOL.  I don&#39;t classify anything for &quot;fun&quot;.  I just inhale it and enjoy it :o).<br/>

Sandra - she thinks her 3 year old will fall somewhere in between her other 2 girls when I said &quot;unknown&quot; I meant that Tina hasn&#39;t &#39;labeled&#39; her yet.<br/>
<br/>
Tina is basically anti-homeschooling - she&#39;s asking questions of me in theory to learn more, however I suspect she&#39;d love to &#39;talk&#39; me out of it.  So far I&#39;ve been able to answer all of her questions.    This one of course had me a bit stumped.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll ever &#39;convert&#39; but I think it would be nice if she could move from anti-homeschooling to just accepting that it exists and that it works well for a lot of people.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; I have a friend who has 3 kids - the oldest is &#39;gifted&#39; (Katherine) , her <br/>
  middle girl has learning difficulties (Carolyn) and the youngest is <br/>
  essentially unknown (she&#39;s 3). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
  I knew my kids really well by the time they were three. <br/>
  Where has this unknown child been living!?   <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Also, what about kids who are *gifted*? Katherine is learning so much at <br/>
  school, and in her Enrichment class. She is learning stuff that is beyond her <br/>
  *grade level* in this class. Stuff that I&#39;m amazed that she is learning and <br/>
  doing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If school is so great for her, why is the mom interested in homeschooling at <br/>
  all?<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I&#39;m just curious if parents have come across having 2 children with such <br/>
  vast learning differences and how do they make it work.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Tell her with unschooling it doesn&#39;t matter one whit who&#39;s &quot;ahead&quot; or <br/>
  &quot;behind&quot; or in what order things are discovered.<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s some stuff for her to read<br/>

  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/specialunschooling">http://sandradodd.com/specialunschooling</a><br/>

  but she doesn&#39;t sound much like she wants to homeschool.  Explaining <br/>
  unschooling to someone who thinks school is peachy is like trying to have an AA <br/>
  meeting during a drinking contest at a downtown biker bar.   No sense in it.<br/>

again I&#39;ve seen him learn all those things the schools were so <br/>
concerned about. He learns when he&#39;s ready and without all the <br/>
pressure and angst. He&#39;s bright and contemplative and aware. <br/>

<br/>
We were just visiting at a friend&#39;s house in Boulder, CO where we <br/>
used to live. This friend is a college professor and very big into a <br/>
*proper* education. Her 8th grade son had just completed a paper on <br/>
Edgar Allan Poe and various other styles of poetry. He did a bio, <br/>
talked about styles and language and wrote poetry of his own. (Red <br/>
marks and comments all over it, broke my heart.) My friend was very <br/>
surprised when I told her that Poe was currently my Casey&#39;s (9yo) <br/>
favorite poet. <br/>
<br/>
Casey discovered &quot;The Raven&quot; while watching The Simpson&#39;s once and <br/>
has delved into anthologies of Poe&#39;s poetry since that time. We&#39;ve <br/>
also read Poe&#39;s bio and discussed some of the conditions and language <br/>
differences of those times and circumstances in Poe&#39;s life that <br/>
caused him to write such dark material. We&#39;ve read and re-read the <br/>
poetry for meaning, style and language. We&#39;ve talked about other <br/>
styles of poetry and how they compare. Casey&#39;s written her own poetry <br/>
and once created a hard bound book of her poems which she donated to <br/>
the library. (I&#39;m not sure what they did with it. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
So...what grade level would that be exactly? Sounds like what the 8th <br/>
grader was doing, but Casey would only be in 3rd grade of she were in <br/>
school. I didn&#39;t create any of that &quot;curriculum&quot; for her, I just <br/>
followed her lead.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are eager to learn will learn. I&#39;ve got one who gobbles <br/>
information at an amazing pace and one who prefers a slower, more <br/>
contemplative approach. Both style are just fine and both kids are <br/>
thriving with unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is so true. And the nice thing about unschooling in general, whether<br/>
it&#39;s with kids who would be labeled something-or-other or kids who would be<br/>
labeled &quot;normal&quot; is that you basically give them the gift of time to learn<br/>
at their own pace. Even within one child, they might gobble up some things,<br/>
and take other things slower. Or gobble up things for awhile and then lay<br/>
off.<br/>
I notice in observing my kids that their interest in things tends to go in<br/>
spurts. And, interestingly enough, it&#39;s when they&#39;re doing &quot;nothing&quot; in a<br/>
given &quot;subject&quot; that the real progression happens. For instance, my son will<br/>
be really interested in manipulating numbers for awhile, and ask me tons of<br/>
questions about numbers, write down problems and figure them out, etc. Then<br/>
he&#39;ll go into a period where he does &quot;nothing&quot; visible with numbers at all.<br/>
By the next time I hear him talking about numbers, he can do some more<br/>
amazing manipulations than he could do before. The last time this happened,<br/>
he could suddenly understand fractions and what they represented. In a<br/>
schooling model, these times of doing &quot;nothing&quot; are to be avoided at all<br/>
costs, yet I can see that for at least my child, *that* is when the true<br/>
learning is occurring, during those times when the concepts go internal in<br/>
his head and he can let them percolate there for awhile.<br/>
Also, I think kids look for different amounts of challenge at different<br/>
points, based on what their needs are at the moment (when they&#39;re given this<br/>
freedom to do so). Yesterday, my 3 year old grabbed my old college poetry<br/>
textbook and for an hour insisted that I read her Shelley and Longfellow and<br/>
Frost. Later, I heard her reciting some lines from the poems to herself.<br/>
Now, that could look &quot;gifted&quot; if I wanted to look at it that way. This<br/>
morning, she&#39;s playing &quot;Jumpstart Preschool&quot; on the computer, which involves<br/>
coloring in numbered squares. She&#39;s been able to use this particular program<br/>
for at least a year, so I could choose to look at it as something &quot;beneath&quot;<br/>
her level, or &quot;behind&quot; where she should be. Neither of those ways of looking<br/>
at her is especially helpful to where she&#39;s actually at. Some days she just<br/>
likes one thing, and some days another.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The LD stuff is what finally pushed me to look at other alternatives.<br/>
Not that he wasn&#39;t reading what they felt was at level but rather what they <br/>
where doing to his happiness.<br/>
 <br/>
One day a boy took his lunch and the resource room teacher lectured him and <br/>
kept telling him he misplaced it. Then she marched him into the class room and <br/>
made the entire class look for his lunch. He was so humiliated. <br/>
<br/>
Once back in her room he began to cry and wouldn&#39;t do his work so she began <br/>
to question him over and over as to what was wrong at home. <br/>
He felt obligated to tell her something so he said that his grandfather died <br/>
of agent orange on our dining room table. (He did die of agent orange but not <br/>
in my house and a neighbor had said the day before that she herd someone died <br/>
here years ago before we moved here) <br/>
<br/>
 She called the principal then she finally called me. I told her well you <br/>
wanted a story he gave you one (creative little fella).  I also told her that he <br/>
is there to learn and that she is not to have any personal conversations with <br/>
him at all! Later that day when I picked him up his teacher confronted me <br/>
about his planner that I hadn&#39;t signed in a month. ( I had never seen this <br/>
planner) She said it was to be signed each night. I said Oh really? Well, why did it <br/>
take you a month to notice?<br/>
<br/>
I made a comment about taking him out and the teacher said &quot;You cant take him <br/>
out and run any time you want to&quot; I said &quot;WATCH ME.&quot; We walked out and never <br/>
went back.  He did find his lunch, the boy had stepped on it and hung it on a <br/>
hanger on the coat rack.<br/>
<br/>
It just goes on and on.... When I think about all that he went through I <br/>
cannot believe I didn&#39;t pull him sooner. : (<br/>
<br/>
I think as far as the tests go you may be right.<br/>
 My guess is that they are 2nd or 3rd graders are they? Did the school label <br/>
them yet? If not I wouldn&#39;t let them, I think some states give parents a hard <br/>
time if they are. Maybe that&#39;s what you are going though now, I dont know?<br/>
<br/>
It takes a long time for that label to leave a kids head.  <br/>
I do not see any of the LD issues they said he had anymore. At times I think <br/>
they mold what they are called.  I did!  I BS&#39;ed my way through all those <br/>
tests and more often than not answered a question with what I thought they wanted <br/>
me to say so I could get out of there. I think if the child knows people think <br/>
there is an issue it changes a lot about them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973695316">I think that many children who are labeled &quot;gifted&quot; have WAY too much <br/>
pressure at home and may NOT be good candidates for home*schooling* <br/>

in two or three &quot;target areas.&quot; Some of these kids are &quot;20% advanced&quot; <br/>

one day he mentioned it to his special ed teacher (whom he had a very hard <br/>
time getting along with all year.)  She called me THAT DAY and questioned me <br/>
about it.  I told her that it seems all his bad behavior revolved around school.  <br/>
Maybe if we eliminated school, he could have a happy, normal life, learn some <br/>
things, bond a little more with us.  We were always so stressed out trying to <br/>
figure out how to deal with school problems too.  <br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the bad notes stopped coming home (notes about him misbehaving), he <br/>
seemed a little happier, and low and behold, he got student of the month a <br/>
week later!  Previously I got a phone call or note every friday telling how he <br/>
had disrupted the class, or not done his work, blah blah...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That 1.6 was where the test at Sylvan learning said my son was at almost a <br/>
year ago.  The biggest thing that helped us was knowing where the low score was. <br/>
 Is it reading out loud or to himself? What are the other scores and where do <br/>
they lay?<br/>
<br/>
For instance, when he was tested and read out loud he scored at first grade <br/>
sixth month. He spent so much time trying to perfect the words as he read that <br/>
it slowed him down and stressed him out and he couldn&#39;t remember what he had <br/>
read.<br/>
When he read to himself he did much better something like third grade or <br/>
something like that.  But like I said now he reads novels and loves them. Before <br/>
he wouldn&#39;t touch a book let alone even pick one up at the store.<br/>
<br/>
I would tell the school that the child at 1.6 level has had the opportunity <br/>
for them to help him and they have not, its you turn to try.<br/>
If he hates reading out loud school is the wrong place to be.  From what I <br/>
have seen and read the math usually runs with it. Dustin seemed ok until they <br/>
got into multiplication and division. Also Penmanship tends to be pretty bad.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know what ends up happening.  I am not sure what state you are in but <br/>
I believe it is your legal right to HS.  Your State Education Dept. may be the <br/>
one to contact rather than the schools them selves. They dont know much about <br/>
HS&#39;ing(at least here they dont)<br/>

Yep!<br/>

You could ease into it by saying &quot;He reads at a kid-level,&quot; and then &quot;He&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914325925">A lot of time State Boards aren&#39;t the best to go to either. I&#39;d never<br/>
advice anyone in Ohio to go to the State Board for more that a copy of the<br/>
regulations here. Even then It can be found online. So many ways to get<br/>
info. ;-) Local Unschoolers/Homeschoolers are the best IMO.<br/>
    Are there any hs groups in your area? How about NATHAN? I think that&#39;s<br/>
the name. Their online. There may be someone in your area too. I&#39;ve heard of<br/>
the TAG list. Gifted and talented. Google should pull it up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916239177">As a former teacher who knows how to perform the reading assesments I <br/>
have NEVER understood the importance of reading comprehension when <br/>
you read aloud.  At what point in life do you read an entire passage, <br/>
out loud and have to comprehend it.  Most often if you are doing <br/>
something out loud, it is a presentation of your own.  I think <br/>
everyone gets a little nervous reading out loud trying not to screw <br/>
up the words.I would love to know the actual signifigance of this <br/>
score??<br/>
