<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940283732">My two have read since they were 4 or younger so I&#39;ve never had the <br/>
problem of enticing a reluctant reader, but I have had to entice ds <br/>
over to a different subject matter. There are only so many times that <br/>
you can read a Nintendo Adventures book before they fall apart. My <br/>
trick, leave other equally enticing books lying around. They will <br/>
pick them up and read. <br/>
I was so happy to find the Animorphs series. Ds had read all of his <br/>
Nintendo books over at least twenty times when I saw &quot;Animorphs&quot; on a <br/>
book. I bought it immediately. Mighty Morphin&#39; Power Rangers were all <br/>
the rage then.<br/>
