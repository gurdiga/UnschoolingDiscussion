<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As long as mothers have the list of good things and the list of bad things,<br/>
&gt; of educational things and &quot;fluff,&quot; of good and bad food, good and bad sleep<br/>
&gt; schedules, good and bad music, books, art, it will affect children aversely in<br/>
&gt; two ways I&#39;m thinking of right off:   it keeps them from going through the<br/>
&gt; mental process of figuring out how THEY will decide what they like or need or<br/>
&gt; can <br/>
&gt; learn from; and it endangers the relationship between parent and child,<br/>
&gt; because <br/>
&gt; the parent is being judgmental of the child, and the child can lose respect<br/>
&gt; for the parent&#39;s intellect, fairness, integrity, thoughtfulness and of her<br/>
&gt; positive regard for her own child.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s a lot to risk just to tell a child that the magazine he likes sucks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been thinking about the difference between this and what, in TCS<br/>
(Taking Children Seriously, tcs.com), they call one&#39;s best theories.  One of<br/>
their premises is that we&#39;re all fallible and that we&#39;re working on our best<br/>
theories that we&#39;ve got at the time.  They would agree and I agree that<br/>
helping our kids get what they want is a good thing but they would also add<br/>
that it&#39;s important to share one&#39;s best theories about something.<br/>
<br/>
I was someone, who a year ago, on the unschooling,com listserv went through<br/>
a lot of consternation about tv.  After listening and arguing w/ Sandra and<br/>
others, I was able to get out of my indoctrination about it and really could<br/>
see how my son (about 3 at the time) did not watch tv as a zombie but as<br/>
part of life going on about him.  He was active in his watching, talking<br/>
doing other things simultaneously, discussing.  The food thing was more<br/>
difficult bc no matter how much I made sure he was getting what he wanted to<br/>
eat, it was and continues to be so much sugar, with the words, &quot;I want<br/>
candy&quot; when he wakes up many mornings and throughout the day.  I offer many<br/>
things along the way that I think he might like (things we might make, etc)<br/>
but nothing compares to store bought candy.  I&#39;ve gone months without saying<br/>
anything about it but now decided to share what I do think about it.<br/>
<br/>
What I do is share my best theories about these thing.  It&#39;s not that I<br/>
screw up my face and say dismissive things like, &#39;WHAT, another candy??&#39;<br/>
Or a big sigh w/ the rolling of eyes. But I do share my thoughts about what<br/>
I believe eating that much candy might do to his body and what I perceive as<br/>
his reactions some hours down the line.  Not every day or even every few<br/>
days but every once in a while.  If he disagrees, I accept that he thinks<br/>
that and support him in getting what he wants and still like to keep the<br/>
discussion open.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing with watching things on tv.  Sometimes something&#39;s on and I<br/>
see the stars of the movies (kids) being callous and mean to other kids in<br/>
the name of cool.  I  mention that I don&#39;t like how they are with each<br/>
other.  I don&#39;t say this movie sucks, how can you watch this drek but share<br/>
my perspective about it.  I think this opens up conversations. I hear so<br/>
many talk about being hands off when it comes to children choosing programs<br/>
and never mentioning one&#39;s own thoughts about the shows.<br/>
<br/>
Another one:  My dh is a musician.  My son loves rock and roll.  My dh can&#39;t<br/>
even listen to it.  It is jarring to his sensibilities.  At first he would<br/>
say things like this is really bad music but I&#39;ve got him to shift and talk<br/>
about what it is that is hard for him to hear and what he really likes in<br/>
music.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear what people have to say about sharing one&#39;s thoughts along<br/>
the way about these sorts of things.  Maybe this is just a natural part of<br/>
one&#39;s life and we hear more on this list about not imposing one&#39;s ideas on<br/>
kids bc that&#39;s what so many of us have to get out of.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t do this yet, don&#39;t know if I will ever be able<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
See, we school-at-homered (DOH!) for so long, and<br/>
raised our kids according to the accepted Conservative<br/>
Christian model for many years, and the damage is<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
If I try to &quot;share my best theories&quot; my older kids<br/>
immediately hear that their choice is &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;less<br/>
than&quot; my preference, and they immediately say, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
sorry mommy, I&#39;ll put the candy back&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
So since we are still healing from all the past junk,<br/>
I have to be very careful in how I share my opinions. <br/>
I can&#39;t even stop them and say, &quot;do you think it is a<br/>
good idea to...&quot; because they immediately know that if<br/>
I am asking, then I must think it is NOT a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
So my best response to almost everything they choose<br/>
to do is, &quot;GREAT!&quot; with a smile and a hug.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I exercise that power to offer my<br/>
opinion is when my 12yo might choose to watch<br/>
something that is too scarey for him, because he has<br/>
asked me to warn him.  I only warn him once, though,<br/>
and never say, &quot;Thou shalt not watch&quot;.<br/>

just with your kids, then you are judging the kids and their choices.  It<br/>
becomes about tv&#39;s effects on your kids rather than about the character&#39;s<br/>
actions per se.<br/>
<br/>
Dh watches stuff that I see little redeeming value in, some real low-brow<br/>
stuff.  I may teasingly turn my nose up at it and go do something else.  I<br/>
do the same thing with the kids.  It is truly about the content of the<br/>
show....not about the effect it might have on the kids, but the effect it<br/>
has on me.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve been thinking about the difference between this and what, in TCS<br/>
(Taking Children Seriously, tcs.com), they call one&#39;s best theories.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I try to maintain a clear separation between what we&#39;re doing when sharing <br/>
our unschooling lives, and what TCS is doing.   Unless they&#39;ve changed their <br/>
stance on telling real stories about real children, it just strikes me as <br/>
irritating theoretical political possibility, and I don&#39;t much like to hear about it.<br/>
<br/>
Our focus here is practical and direct.  How can we help children learn as <br/>
freely and as naturally as possible?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They would agree and I agree that<br/>
helping our kids get what they want is a good thing but they would also add<br/>
that it&#39;s important to share one&#39;s best theories about something.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t they just say &quot;communicate honestly with your children&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s not mix their stuff with our stuff, if possible.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;I want<br/>
candy&quot; when he wakes up many mornings and throughout the day. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you beat him to it by waking him up and saying &quot;I made pancakes!&quot; he might <br/>
still say &quot;I want candy&quot; and you could say, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s get some when we go <br/>
to the store&quot; or &quot;okay, after pancakes!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;what of all things in the world do you want?&quot; that&#39;s not the same <br/>
as offering lots of cool things, letting him turn them down (if he can, after <br/>
he sees and smells them!) or not.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What I do is share my best theories about these thing.  It&#39;s not that I<br/>
screw up my face and say dismissive things like, &#39;WHAT, another candy??&#39;<br/>
Or a big sigh w/ the rolling of eyes. But I do share my thoughts about what<br/>
I believe eating that much candy might do to his body and what I perceive as<br/>
his reactions some hours down the line.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does it help you to have candy you don&#39;t mind so much? PayDay bars?  Granola <br/>
bars?  Coconut squares?  Peanut-butter balls?   <br/>
<br/>
Would it help to have really interesting food you DO think is good already <br/>
ready to go?<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s just waking up.  I&#39;m going to make her a scrambled egg sandwich.  If <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want it, I&#39;ll eat it.  If I say &quot;Would you rather have scrambled <br/>
eggs or cereal?&quot; it might matter it&#39;s warm scrambled eggs she can smell, or <br/>
theoretical future scrambled eggs.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The same thing with watching things on tv.  Sometimes something&#39;s on and I<br/>
see the stars of the movies (kids) being callous and mean to other kids in<br/>
the name of cool.  I  mention that I don&#39;t like how they are with each<br/>
other.  I don&#39;t say this movie sucks, how can you watch this drek but share<br/>
my perspective about it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That can be done without discussing the movie as a movie.<br/>
You could say &quot;A friend of mine did that one time, and I still feel bad about <br/>
it,&quot; or whatever&#39;s true and that you think is important for them to know.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday I uttered the words &quot;Kids at school are like that&quot; to Marty <br/>
when he came back from driver&#39;s ed frustrated with the irritating behavior of <br/>
another kid who was sarcastic after a joke Marty made, and then picked on him <br/>
for the next hour and a half.  I told him he was pretty lucky not to have <br/>
experienced that behavior before he was 15, that most kids get it from kindergarten <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I hear so<br/>
many talk about being hands off when it comes to children choosing programs<br/>
and never mentioning one&#39;s own thoughts about the shows.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If people can&#39;t tell the difference between polite, equal conversation and <br/>
manipulating shame, I think &quot;hands off&quot; is better than &quot;whatever.&quot;   But those <br/>
aren&#39;t the only two choices.  Maybe they can learn how to communicate honestly <br/>
without trying to sway kids toward their own possibly-unreasonable prejudices.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Another one:  My dh is a musician.  My son loves rock and roll.  My dh can&#39;t<br/>
even listen to it.  It is jarring to his sensibilities. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a courtesy issue.  If your son is not willing to keep it down when <br/>
his dad&#39;s home, or if the dad is trying to demand total r&r blockade in his <br/>
home, that&#39;s about living together compassionately, not about music.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Alison<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Alison, welcome to the list! I&#39;m new here as well...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem sharing my opinion with my son about <br/>
&quot;whatever&quot;, as long as i know its not a knee-jerk reaction on my <br/>
part. For example, your son and his candy for breakfast issue...are <br/>
you concerned because he is ONLY eating candy, and nothing else that <br/>
is nutritious? Or are you concerned because he is eating candy for <br/>
breakfast and that &quot;just doesnt seem healthy&quot; to you? I think there <br/>
is a difference there. On any given issue, there is usually so many <br/>
possible alternatives/resolutions...would making chocolate chip <br/>
pancakes, or putting candy sprinkles on his yogurt, satisfy his candy <br/>
craving? Would he be interested in learning to make his own candy? <br/>
<br/>
I just saw Rachel Ray (a cook)on the food network make something that <br/>
most kids would looooove: Frozen bananas(stuck on popsicle sticks), <br/>
dipped in chocolate, then dipped on a variety of toppings of choice <br/>
(crushed nuts, chocolate sprinkles, shredded coconut, m and m&#39;s , <br/>
whatever you want!)then refrozen for a time. They looked really <br/>
yummy. <br/>
<br/>
If my son is making a decision, and i have information that would <br/>
help him make a more informed decision, i won&#39;t withhold that info, <br/>
of course! My son is growing out his (beautiful red)hair, because he <br/>
wants to have a mohawk this summer. He has wanted this for awhile <br/>
now, so i know its not passing phase. When/if the time comes that he <br/>
really does want to get the mohawk, i will talk with him about how <br/>
people in this area might react to such a haircut and let him know <br/>
that part of having a nontypical hairstyle means putting up with alot <br/>
of comments and negative feedback from strangers. Thats just reality. <br/>
But in giving him this opinion, it has *nothing* to do with my own <br/>
personal feelings...we have plenty of friends who have mohawks, <br/>
piercings, etc, and i myself have lots of visible, large tattoos(as <br/>
does Seamus&#39; father, who is an anti-racist skinhead.) <br/>
<br/>
I think giving information, an opinion, or alternatives is fine as <br/>
long as you aren&#39;t overly invested in the outcome, and really ok with <br/>
your child not following your advice or agreeing with you. And also <br/>
it helps to offer to give your opinion before giving the opinion <br/>
itself. I sometimes ask my son &quot;do you want to know what i think of <br/>
xyz?&quot; or &quot;do you want to see a different way of doing that?&quot; <br/>
Sometimes the answer is yes, sometimes no, and i respect that.<br/>

&gt; I have to be very careful in how I share my opinions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
I really know that feeling of realizing there&#39;s too much history to feel<br/>
confident in doing anything that even resembled the past.  I also know that<br/>
before I&#39;ve healed sufficiently from something and I go to the opposite end<br/>
of what I had been doing it&#39;s really just the opposite side of the same<br/>
coin. <br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was dating.  I had been hurt by what I thought was being<br/>
too open so decided to make a shift.  I became a tough minded and<br/>
independent woman of the world.  The trouble was, I was still the same<br/>
inside and I was either using my vulnerabilities to manipulate situations or<br/>
using my toughness to shield myself.  When I was able to just say to myself,<br/>
&#39;you know I&#39;m really rather needy&quot; which was until then one of the worst<br/>
things I thought one could possible be and something to run from at all<br/>
costs, I could w, not one month went<br/>
by and I met my dh.  I remember the feeling of being so much more<br/>
comfortable w/ who I was not having to try to be something i wasn&#39;t. That<br/>
was a wakeup call to me to make that happen as much as possible in other<br/>
areas of my life.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;ve mentioned makes me wonder whether there&#39;s a place you can find<br/>
to be able to communicate some of your concerns including your own and their<br/>
reactivity.  That way you could all find a place to be where you are.  That<br/>
sounds way too vague.  Sorry.  For example, instead of saying, &#39;do you think<br/>
it&#39;s a good idea to....&#39; .you might say something like, &quot;it&#39;s hard for me to<br/>
say these things without worrying that you&#39;ll think and I&#39;ll think I&#39;m being<br/>
my old controlling self.  But I was thinking that eating candy as much as<br/>
you do (or whatever)  might be making your moods go up and down.  What do<br/>
you think?&quot;  That way you&#39;re expressing where you are at the moment and i<br/>
think may make space for everyone to wrangle and unravel from the past as<br/>
well.  I think too often we get some idealized  notion  of how we&#39;re<br/>
supposed to be.  I&#39;m a big believer in bringing it all to the table, warts<br/>
and all.  Or should I say beauty marks and all.<br/>

the name of cool.  I  mention that I don&#39;t like how they are with each<br/>
other.  I don&#39;t say this movie sucks, how can you watch this drek but share<br/>
my perspective about it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That can be done without discussing the movie as a movie.<br/>
&gt;You could say &quot;A friend of mine did that one time, and I still feel bad about<br/>
&gt;it,&quot; or whatever&#39;s true and that you think is important for them to know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes that&#39;s a good point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Another one:  My dh is a musician.  My son loves rock and roll.  My dh<br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
even listen to it.  It is jarring to his sensibilities. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This is a courtesy issue.  If your son is not willing to keep it down when<br/>
&gt;his dad&#39;s home, or if the dad is trying to demand total r&r blockade in his<br/>
&gt;home, that&#39;s about living together compassionately, not about music.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve got this one pretty well worked out.  In the car ds has a walkman and<br/>
at home it&#39;s not much of an issue since ds mostly likes to listen to rock<br/>
and roll in the car. i guess he&#39;s a travellin&#39; man.<br/>

&gt;&gt;My question would be do you do this with your dh?  Or just your kids?  If<br/>
&gt;&gt;just with your kids, then you are judging the kids and their choices.  It<br/>
&gt;&gt;becomes about tv&#39;s effects on your kids rather than about the character&#39;s<br/>
&gt;actions per se.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Dh watches stuff that I see little redeeming value in, some real low-brow<br/>
&gt;&gt;stuff.  I may teasingly turn my nose up at it and go do something else.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;do the same thing with the kids.  It is truly about the content of the<br/>
&gt;&gt;show....not about the effect it might have on the kids, but the effect it<br/>
&gt;&gt;has on me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Just a thought.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I have to confess that the converse is probably more true; that I&#39;m<br/>
probably more respectful towards my ds.  Embarrassing but true.  I know it&#39;s<br/>
not the best thing and I&#39;m working on that.  Not so much respectful but I<br/>
can get so annoyed at my dh.  We must be pretty respectful though since ds<br/>
Asher from very early on said please and thank you and excuse me and we<br/>
NEVER asked him to say those things.  I hate to hear adults say, &quot;Now what<br/>
do you say?&quot; in that sing songy voice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think giving information, an opinion, or alternatives is fine as<br/>
&gt;long as you aren&#39;t overly invested in the outcome, and really ok with<br/>
&gt;your child not following your advice or agreeing with you. And also<br/>
&gt;it helps to offer to give your opinion before giving the opinion<br/>
&gt;itself. I sometimes ask my son &quot;do you want to know what i think of<br/>
&gt;xyz?&quot; or &quot;do you want to see a different way of doing that?&quot;<br/>
&gt;Sometimes the answer is yes, sometimes no, and i respect that.<br/>

Yes that&#39;s a tough one.  I act as though that were true as in getting what<br/>
he really wants but in the case of food it&#39;s a tough one.  We have made some<br/>
candy stuff but it doesn&#39;t cut it for him.  We continue to look for things.<br/>
I&#39;ll try the banana thing maybe dipped in caramel.  He doesn&#39;t like<br/>
chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I think too often we get some idealized  notion  of how we&#39;re<br/>
supposed to be.  I&#39;m a big believer in bringing it all to the table, warts<br/>
and all.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If we know something is still bothering us that our parents did, though, <br/>
isn&#39;t it worth avoiding doing the same to our kids?<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of ways to express disapproval, and if we express it too <br/>
often the kids can start to ignore it.  I think saving it until it&#39;s really <br/>
important works well, with them finding their own balance and preference other times.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah.   My kids are usually pretty good about those things, so it was <br/>
noticeable the other night when I went in Kirby&#39;s room where he was online and Marty <br/>
was playing a video game.  I said &quot;Any dirty dishes in here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Each of them handed me something.   I said &quot;Thank you,&quot; and turned to walk <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe each of them thought the other would say something.  I said &quot;And now <br/>
YOU guys say &#39;thank you&#39;!&quot; and they both said &quot;Thank you!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It was very rhythmic and kinda cute, none of it was hateful.<br/>
