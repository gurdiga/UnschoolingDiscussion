UNSCHOOLING AMERICA<br/>
HAVING THE GUTS TO LEAVE A CRIPPLING SCHOOL SYSTEM<br/>
TEXT :: STEPHANIE GROLL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Junior high and high school were a complete waste of time for me<br/>
academically. The bad study habits I&#39;d picked up made my<br/>
transition into university harder than it had to be. My attitude<br/>
about learning left me disinterested in pretty much everything.<br/>
<br/>
But you can&#39;t quit, right? I mean, everybody goes to school. Only<br/>
losers drop out.<br/>
<br/>
Not according to a growing group of teens who choose to educate<br/>
themselves outside the school system.They call themselves<br/>
unschoolers, deschoolers and dropouts, among other things. And<br/>
for different reasons, they drop out of school, despite<br/>
statistics that suggest that dropping out of school can lead to a<br/>
financially hard life.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to high school graduates, dropouts are likely to earn<br/>
less money, collect unemployment, and receive public assistance<br/>
and be single parents, according to a 1999 report by the U.S.<br/>
Department of Education&#39;s National Center for Education<br/>
Statistics.<br/>
<br/>
What these stats don&#39;t measure, however, are the teens who thrive<br/>
when they ditch the school system to take control of their<br/>
learning process.<br/>
<br/>
What Is Unschooling?<br/>
First let&#39;s clear up a few things - there&#39;s an important<br/>
distinction between education and schooling. Education is the<br/>
active development of knowledge and lasts a lifetime. Schooling<br/>
is merely the act of going to school. The idea is this: If you&#39;re<br/>
free to use your time, your natural curiosity will lead you to<br/>
everything you need to know.<br/>
Schooling can be passive. You sit and receive whatever lecture is<br/>
on the teacher&#39;s syllabus, regardless of what you&#39;re interested<br/>
in. Attending formal classes is no guarantee that you&#39;re<br/>
learning, just as dropping out doesn&#39;t keep you from getting an<br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
Also, unschooling is not homeschooling, where your parents set up<br/>
a school system at home. Unschooling is self-directed education.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers can read what they want, volunteer, do internships,<br/>
or become an apprentice. The can also write a novel, tackle<br/>
advanced math problems, go on hikes, or even audit classes in<br/>
college (which are very different from high school classes). The<br/>
point is to do whatever they&#39;re excited about.</div>
