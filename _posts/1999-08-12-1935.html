<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424487040"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I want to start some kind of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>group for average children - not really that is a joke - I truly do not see<br/>
any benefits in labeling my child.  No child is gifted in all areas.  I<br/>
think it behooves us to remember that.  No matter how smart my son is about<br/>
reading or numbers or facts or figures every other kid out there will<br/>
probably be better than him at something.  Thank goodness.  We all can have<br/>
some aspect of our lives that we feel good at.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

Great post, I totally agree with you.  <br/>
<br/>
A while back when I was still on aohell, there was a discussion on one of the boards about who was a mensa member and who wasn&#39;t.  I made a statement like - &quot;I&#39;ll say it loud, and I&#39;ll say it proud, I am average&quot;, needless to say, not much response &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
It does seem as though those who are &quot;more&quot; intelligent than us(me) regular folks have some edge on success in this world.  Whether that is or is not valid, I prefer to revel in the fact that I walk upright and have the opportunity to make choices for myself that will affect others far greater than my IQ score.<br/>
<br/>

I like what you say here Karen!<br/>
It&#39;s important to me, that my children stretch themselves for the sake of stretching themselves, not for the sake of finding themselves beyond or before &quot;so n so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remember that IQ discussion on AOL, and though I found it interesting, I, like you say you are, am quite average. &lt;G&gt; Hey, but I&#39;m having a good time.<br/>
<br/>
I find it hard to believe that anyone is really &quot;average&quot; anyway. Y&#39;know, What IS average, and who says so?<br/>
 My problem with &quot;gifted&quot; and other such labels, is simply that all kids should be able to access gifted assignments and try them continually -not just those who have had access to them before.<br/>
