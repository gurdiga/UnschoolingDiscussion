<div id="ygrps-yiv-550105449">Hello,<br/>
  I just wanted to thank Pam for saying that she also unschools purple. That<br/>
sentence has put me at ease about my 8 year olds reading.<br/>
 I can remember when she was a toddler, I would encourage her to learn the<br/>
abc&#39;s, colors, shapes, etc., but she wasn&#39;t going to learn them until she<br/>
was interested no matter how much I bombarded her with the information-I was<br/>
failing her miserably- and to top it off-all her little friends already had<br/>
known their colors for months!<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear anyone&#39;s personal unschooling stories. I have only been<br/>
on here for 6 or so months, and haven&#39;t heard too many.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It always cracks me up when I see anxious emails from Moms, on various lists, <br/>
asking how to &quot;teach the colors.&quot;  Gosh, have you even been to a grocery <br/>
store?  Your yard?  Opened a book?  It seems to me if you talk to yur kids, <br/>
they will get this piece of info pretty early on -- &quot;Johnny, do you want a <br/>
green or a red apple?  Chocolate or white milk?&quot;  (The &quot;right&quot; answers, btw, <br/>
are -- chocolate milk, red apple and nothing green!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my son was in preschool, I noticed that most of the other kids knew <br/>
their colours.  I made a mental note to play some colour games with him or <br/>
something but never got around to it.  A couple of months later, I noticed <br/>
that he knew his colours.  &lt;g&gt;  Possibly I had started using colour names <br/>
around him more, but I didn&#39;t do anything conscious.<br/>
<br/>
When he was around 6 and learning to tell time, he told me that he knew <br/>
what 12 +12 was.  I asked him how he knew that, and he told me that there <br/>
are 24 hours in a day and the clock only has 12 hours.  So 12 + 12 must <br/>
equal 24.  That&#39;s knowledge that he owns, because he ferreted it out himself.<br/>
