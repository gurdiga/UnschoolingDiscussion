<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because in my perception of things, I am not giving professional advice. I<br/>
&gt; think *expertise* is a tone and an attitude. I think this applies also to<br/>
&gt; someone who&#39;s a violin teacher or a professional violinist speaking about<br/>
&gt; violin stuff. I doubt anyone takes it as *professional advice*.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?  Because when I talk about violin stuff, I try to make it clear that<br/>
I&#39;m a string teacher.  I can&#39;t just chat about violin stuff as a parent; I<br/>
have a compelling interest in seeing people be happy with what they do<br/>
musically.  So I do give advice, but I try to make sure people realize where<br/>
it&#39;s coming from.  Because every teacher is different, I hope that another<br/>
teacher&#39;s ideas might be useful, particually since I understand the concept<br/>
of unschooling.  Not every teacher will, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
However, I generally only respond &quot;professionally&quot; to people talking or<br/>
asking about violin playing.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever recommended to someone<br/>
that their child would be happier playing violin than clarinet, or that a<br/>
child&#39;s problems could be dealt with by playing violin.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the difference, Yol.  If someone asks for advice about<br/>
homeopathy, I think you should be the first to respond.  You *are* a<br/>
professional, and hence your advice is professional advice.  You advertise<br/>
yourself that way on every email, in your tag line.  But many people are<br/>
looking for parenting/unschooling advice on their problems, not medical.  If<br/>
you have personal advice on the subject (&quot;I was treated for this problem as<br/>
a teen, and homeopathy helped&quot;), maybe it would be seen as personal advice.<br/>
But I definitly think there&#39;s a difference.<br/>

<br/>
I get your point. I just wonder how can someone ask about homeopathy if they don&#39;t know what homeopathy can help with? Most people haven&#39;t even heard about homeopathy, ever. Others think it&#39;s good for colds and flus, because that&#39;s what they were told at their health food store. Everybody knows what a violin is...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I won&#39;t post anymore, ok?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356161503">If I&#39;m on a general parenting site and someone is discussing a <br/>
problem they&#39;re having with making their kids do all of their <br/>
homework, or making their kids get up in the morning to go to school <br/>
on time, I will mention unschooling whether they ask to be told about <br/>
unschooling or not.  <br/>
<br/>
Even schools will sometimes see that a child isn&#39;t participating like <br/>
he normally would and might realize that it&#39;s because his eyesight is <br/>
declining and he needs glasses.  As an unschooling parent, I need to <br/>
take the whole child into account.  So if a child is having a fear or <br/>
anxiety or social interaction problem, then that is going to affect <br/>
how he learns.  One thing I could do is try to see if something in <br/>
his surroundings is affecting him and try to talk it through with <br/>
him.  Another thing I could do is to take him to my homeopath to see <br/>
if she thinks it is an emotional imbalance that a homeopathic remedy <br/>
can cure.  <br/>
<br/>
I look at the whole person.  Everything fits together and overlaps, <br/>
affecting other things so much that it&#39;s really hard to <br/>
compartmentalize things into an education category, a medical <br/>
category, a religion category.  It&#39;s all part of life and all of it <br/>
affects each other.  <br/>

recognizing that a little bit of intriguing information that piques<br/>
someone&#39;s interest is much more effective than a lot of information that no<br/>
one has asked for.<br/>

How can kids ask about Shakespeare?<br/>
<br/>
If we think it&#39;s important we need to make sure they have opportunities to<br/>
be aware of it in ways that are fun or intriguing and preferably short and<br/>
occasional at first. They will show their interest eventually. Or not.<br/>
<br/>
One way to make sure they *don&#39;t* ask about Shakespeare is to turn a<br/>
conversation to him everyday or every other day.<br/>

<br/>
There are lots of REALLY great websites about Shakespeare and if people <br/>
seemed to need that, or asked for it, we could provide those websites, some <br/>
recommendations of videos, and off they would go to learn on their own!<br/>
<br/>
I love Shakespeare.  I&#39;m happy with the way my kids are familiar with several <br/>
of the plays and can listen to the language without frustration.  When I was <br/>
their age (any of their ages) I was clueless (although I was immersed in the <br/>
King James Bible so the language wasn&#39;t out of depth).  I could talk about <br/>
Shakespeare every day, and in phases sometimes I do.  But not here.  Just <br/>
when it comes up naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Our Much Ado About Nothing videotape is missing.  We must have loaned it out <br/>
and can&#39;t remember where.  I hope whoever has it remembers where they <br/>
borrowed it!  <br/>
