He just unsubbed within the past few hours because I saw his name there this morning.  Pam and I have been discussing him and what his motives may be.  I was just rereading Pam&#39;s message when your post came through and I don&#39;t see anything in it that would scare him off, but who knows?  I did notice that he didn&#39;t have a Yahoo ID.  A lot of people have no profile, but they have IDs.  Anyway, if you View Source you can see where someone&#39;s computer is.  People can be easily traced.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  It just came through a couple of hours ago.  Was there more than the<br/>
one post from him?  I only saw one.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
*If* he really is just a somewhat naive university student, I don&#39;t see why<br/>
Pam&#39;s post would scare him off.  And that *is* what I thought when I read<br/>
his post.  *If* he is something other than what he suggested, I can see<br/>
perfectly well why Pam&#39;s post would scare him off.<br/>
