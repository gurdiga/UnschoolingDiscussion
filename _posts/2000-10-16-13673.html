<br/>
Here&#39;s a story today from Japan about a public forum that was set up to <br/>

UNPAID COMMUNITY WORK FOCUS OF EDUCATION FORUM<br/>
<br/>
Yomiuri Shimbun<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FUKUOKA -- The advisability of making it compulsory for schoolchildren to <br/>
engage in unpaid community work was the focus of attention at the first <br/>
public hearing held by an advisory panel to Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori <br/>
in Hakata Ward, Fukuoka, on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
The National Commission on Educational Reform held the hearing to discuss <br/>
an interim report it submitted to Mori on Sept. 22.<br/>
<br/>
Eight citizens, including six former and current schoolteachers, took <br/>
part in the hearing as representatives of the public.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion largely focused on proposals in the report that all <br/>
primary, middle and high school students do unpaid work in the community, <br/>
and that measures to improve teachers&#39; skills be implemented.<br/>
<br/>
Most participants said community work should not be mandatory and argued <br/>
that more emphasis should be placed on students&#39; independence. Some <br/>
participants questioned the ability of school principals to objectively <br/>
evaluate teachers.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to former Education Minister Hirofumi Nakasone, who is the <br/>
prime minister&#39;s aide in charge of educational reform, seven panel <br/>
members attended the forum, including Keita Asari, head of the Gekidan <br/>
Shiki theatrical company, and writer Ayako Sono.<br/>
<br/>
About 330 members of the public listened to the debate between the <br/>
commission members and the public representatives.<br/>
<br/>
Of the eight members of the public, five mentioned the proposal in the <br/>
interim report that community work be made compulsory for students.<br/>
<br/>
All five called for a cautionary approach to the proposal, but agreed <br/>
that community work is important.<br/>
<br/>
A 42-year-old company president, speaking on behalf of students&#39; parents, <br/>
said, &quot;It is more effective to nurture a sense of cooperation among <br/>
volunteers in times of trouble, as was evident in the volunteer work that <br/>
began after the [1995] Great Hanshin Earthquake.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A 57-year-old middle school principal stressed the importance of <br/>
students&#39; independence, saying, &quot;Students gain self-confidence through <br/>
the experience of helping others if their independence is respected.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In response, Sono asked participants to show understanding for the report <br/>
and said, &quot;If we first give students the opportunity to experience <br/>
community work, they will come to enjoy it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many of the participants drawn from the public had experience as <br/>
schoolteachers, and they expressed their opinions specifically on the <br/>
issue of improving the teaching skills of teachers.<br/>
<br/>
A 43-year-old high school teacher spoke in favor of a proposal in the <br/>
report calling for the introduction of a merit-based evaluation system <br/>
for teachers.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think an evaluation system is needed in which teachers who strive hard <br/>
are rewarded,&quot; the teacher said.<br/>
<br/>
However, another panelist questioned the evaluation ability of the <br/>
administration side, saying, &quot;I wonder if school administrators, <br/>
including principals, are able to evaluate teachers objectively.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There were some reactions to the proposal that teachers who have led <br/>
classes without difficulty or devised effective teaching methods be given <br/>
special financial allowances.<br/>
