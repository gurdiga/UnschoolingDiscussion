<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793744764">Hi Marjorie ~<br/>
Isn&#39;t life strange?  I will buy the book, as my youngest son is <br/>
Autistic.....I cannot imagine a read, the way he thinks.....lol. I decided to homeschool, <br/>
partly because of the torture school put him thru, he was so angry, not that I <br/>
let him BE...it&#39;s amazing how quickly he is learning and picking up new words, <br/>
etc.  Even if some of them are cuss words, we can&#39;t help but <br/>
smile.........they are WORDS!  I bought a leap pad for him, and since it incorporates all the <br/>
senses (except smell) he absolutely loves it, and I am quietly sitting by, <br/>
okay I&#39;m lurking.....as he shows me he knows way more than I ever dreamed he did. <br/>
 I will find the book this weekend.  <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Michelle<br/>
