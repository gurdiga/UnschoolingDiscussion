<div id="ygrps-yiv-81397642">Has anyone heard of Goddard College in Vermont?  I was going through a <br/>
book I got at the library which lists accredited colleges in the U.S. and <br/>
Canada that have off-campus/long distance learning with degrees available.  <br/>
Goddard was one of them so I did a search on the Internet and was really <br/>
surprised to read about them.  They sound like a perfect unschooler&#39;s <br/>
college.  The learning is very self-directed and the on-campus classes are <br/>
small discussion groups with teachers acting instead as &quot;facilitators.&quot;  I am <br/>
really excited about this school.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146465902">Yes, Lucy.  Another good school along the same lines is Vermont College<br/>
of Norwich University (where I am currently working on a masters in<br/>

   I saw some information on Norwich and noticed that they are near Goddard.  <br/>
Are you working on your Master&#39;s long distance or on campus?  I am thinking <br/>
of finishing my B.A. through Goddard&#39;s off campus program and then maybe even <br/>
going for a Master&#39;s.  Their approach seems so much more sane and progressive <br/>
and exciting. <br/>
   I told my oldest about it and he thought it sounded interesting.  He&#39;s one <br/>
who is planning to go to college because the things he&#39;s interested in tend <br/>
to require a degree but he and I are having a negative experience right now <br/>
in a community college class we&#39;re taking together and it has made me <br/>
question the whole approach.  I know most classes aren&#39;t as bad as this one <br/>
but I would hate for him or me to ever be in a class like this again.  It is <br/>
everything I hate about institutional learning (learning for the grade and <br/>
the transcripts rather than the information, dealing with a power crazy <br/>
authoritarian teacher, etc.).   It has really put a damper on the subject for <br/>
us both (Geology) because we associate it with that class and that teacher.  <br/>
Before this, I had had good experiences in college classes and found them to <br/>
be totally different than high school.  This was the last general ed. class I <br/>
needed for transfer or an A.A.<br/>
     I also love the flexibility of the off-campus learning because it is <br/>
difficult for me to arrange for being on campus every week right now.  And <br/>
Goddard&#39;s description of their degrees&#39; processes speaks of choosing the ways <br/>
to learn each subject and working with a long-distance tutor to come up with <br/>
a plan.  <br/>
     How do you like the Norwich program?  Is it similar?  Are you glad you <br/>
chose it?  It sounds really interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453624381"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Are you working on your Master&#39;s long distance or on campus?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am doing the online format (new last fall) following a 5-day<br/>
colloquium at Vermont College in October.  The format sounds identical<br/>
to Goddard.  I have a core faculty advisor at VC and a field faculty<br/>
advisor closer to where I live.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a program I have wanted to do for a dozen years, and the online<br/>
format finally made it possible.  I&#39;m in the early stages, and, yes, I&#39;m<br/>
glad to be doing it.<br/>

    You wrote about Norwich University and so I followed up and got some info <br/>
from them, also.  Their program looks very similar to Goddard.  So now I am <br/>
deciding which one to go with.  I am really excited about the approach of <br/>
those two schools.  It is different than any other college I&#39;ve known about.<br/>
