I think when you converted to inches 300 x 480 x 12, you left out the 12<br/>
times.  300 x 480 = 144,000, then that times 12 equals 1,728,000 sq. inches.<br/>
That number divided by the 46,656 equals 37.03, or slightly over 37 cubic<br/>
yards of mulch (I don&#39;t think I&#39;d buy 38, cuz I&#39;m cheap - the actual depth<br/>
would only be about 11.9+ inches!).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the same number that Joyce had yesterday doing it by feet.  That&#39;s<br/>
how I did it too, since the original playyard dimensions were in feet and<br/>
it&#39;s dealing with smaller numbers.  But it works any way - either by inches,<br/>
feet, or fractions of yards as someone else did it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also really close to the estimate of 35 someone said.  Joyce wondered<br/>
how she got that.  So do I.  Mathematical thinking (only one Gardner&#39;s<br/>
multiple intelligences) can be interesting, cuz it&#39;s different for different<br/>
people.  Which is what is so good about not sending our kids to school!<br/>

square feet. 3 feet of 12&quot; depth sections in a cubic yard. 3/1000 would be <br/>
33.3---so I &quot;rounded up&quot; to 35. It may be TOTALLY wrong in another example <br/>
and I may have just lucked out. And I usually buy one or two bags extra <br/>
anyway to &quot;fill in&quot;.<br/>
