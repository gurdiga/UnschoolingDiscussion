<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010318734">I have just had a lady call me and tell me that her son was failing in school <br/>
and is getting in trouble with the law.  She is a single mother and would <br/>
like to know if I would homeschool her son.  I told her that to my knowledge, <br/>
it was against the law to school anyone other then your own children.  Is <br/>
this true, or do I have it wrong?  Is there anyway that a single mom can let <br/>
someone else homeschool their child?<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700950323">Looks like you can&#39;t do it for someone else&#39;s child....<br/>

BUT, I wonder if he could enroll in an online homeschool program like<br/>
Oak Meadow and do it from your house with your supervision?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274731950">Mara, thanks for the suggestion. I don&#39;t know to much about the online <br/>
schools, so never thought of that. I would be afraid that would still be <br/>
interpreted as someone else schooling your kid, but wonder where we could <br/>
find out.  Is there any mention of that in what you looked up?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635492215">Mara, I was looking at the site you had posted, didn&#39;t see anything to cover <br/>
this at the Florida educators site.  I will email the online school and see <br/>
what they say.  As to me supervising this boy, no, his mom will need to find <br/>
someone else, she just called me cause I am the only hser she knows.  Between <br/>
my husbands business and my boys, I can&#39;t take on anything else, but, I am <br/>
trying to help her out by getting whatever information I can.<br/>
Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561021712">I&#39;m not really very sure about this...but it seems that enrollment<br/>
itself into the Oak Meadow school might qualify as a private school.<br/>
Their online program actually has &quot;classes&quot; and teachers, they keep<br/>
records etc.  Maybe you could email them to find out - I&#39;m sure they<br/>
deal with this kind of thing often enough.<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t been researching for very long, so I don&#39;t know if there are<br/>
more programs like Oak Meadow.  Could you be his daily supervisor and<br/>
his mom homeschool him at night - for legal purposes?<br/>

I believe you are correct.  I believe that if you hs someone else&#39;s child, <br/>
you are then considered a private school and have to comply with all the laws <br/>
that apply.  Have you checked the FPEA page?<br/>

him when she gets home from work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580720482">Up here in what finally looks like the North Pole, There is a wonderful<br/>
clandestine group of hschoolers not unschoolers who do send their kids to<br/>
another hs house where they all spend the am learning together under<br/>
extremely talented teachers who do charge for their time and have their own<br/>
kids with them. They are only with them in the am and the parents do have to<br/>
still do the work as far as getting their kids work evaluated by a certified<br/>
teacher at the end of year as well as submitting  the curriculum to the<br/>
superintendent at beginning of each year. It has been a wonderful experience<br/>
and we plan to join them maybe one after noon a week for drama or music or<br/>
creative writing. (based on what my kids want to do and if we can afford<br/>
it!) I am not sure if that could work in FL but it is working here sort of<br/>
an underground learners railroad if you will!<br/>
If the kid is in trouble already he may be a handful for you alone in the<br/>
beginning though it might be best to have her around or do you know him well<br/>
enough to be able to handle his testing the waters with you? Just curious<br/>
and hope he can be saved! Maybe they could spend time with you and you could<br/>
also charge for his time on your pc or whatever and show her how to write up<br/>
the curriculum or whatever you need to do there. It must be so hard being a<br/>
single mom I think it is great you want to help her. Best wishes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682225424">Beth, thanks for sharing.  I don&#39;t think that would work here.  We can do <br/>
group teaching, I believe it is once a week, but not all the time. <br/>
As for the boy, I am trying to help the mom get information, but I cannot <br/>
take him on also.  Between my two boys, and working with my husband, I have <br/>
my hands full!  But I am sure it is hard for this mom and I do want to try to <br/>
help with whatever info I can get her.<br/>
