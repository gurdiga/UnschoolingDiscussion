<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My former secretary had a terrible thing happen to her and her family last <br/>
&gt; week, and I wanted to share it with all of you so that you could be warned <br/>
&gt; and warn your friends and family as well. She had a gel candle burning in <br/>
&gt; her bathroom ...it exploded and caught her house on fire. The house burned <br/>
&gt; down and they lost everything. The fire marshal told her that this is not <br/>
&gt; the first incident where a gel candle has exploded and caused a fire. He <br/>
&gt; said that the gel builds up a gas and often times it explodes and sets fire <br/>
&gt; to the room it is in, which is what happened to her. The fire was so hot it <br/>
&gt; melted the smoke alarm, and they didn&#39;t discover the fire until there was <br/>
&gt; an explosion, which was her toilet blowing up, and by then it was too <br/>
&gt; late...the entire upstairs was engulfed in flames. Smoke damage and water <br/>
&gt; damage have destroyed what wasn&#39;t destroyed by fire. Please pass  this <br/>
&gt; along to anyone you care about. I wouldn&#39;t want this to happen to anyone <br/>
&gt; else. Her family is devastated. All their mementos and everything of value <br/>
&gt; and meaning are gone<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849994510">Yes Gel Candles can pose a greater fire risk than wax candles <br/>
but . . . they do not explode.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Claim:   Gel candles can explode, posing a greater-than-usual fire <br/>
and injury hazard. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/toxins/gel.htm">http://www.snopes.com/toxins/gel.htm</a> <br/>
<br/>
Origins:   Yes, gel candles do pose fire and injury hazards beyond <br/>
those presented by ordinary wax candles, so they should be accorded <br/>
an extra bit of caution if you&#39;re thinking of bringing them into your <br/>
home. However, as with so many e-mailed warnings, the  explanation <br/>
provided about what goes on is sadly in error and leaves those who <br/>
are &quot;educated&quot; by it in the dark about what they should really be <br/>
paying attention to as they are instead misled into worrying about <br/>
the mysterious (and non-existent) explosive properties of the gel. <br/>
<br/>
Contrary to what this e-mailed warning would have you believe, gel <br/>
candles do not &quot;build up a gas&quot; that causes them to explode. <br/>
The &quot;gel&quot; in gel candles is composed of substances that burn slowly <br/>
and non-combustively. Akin to the wax of traditional candles, the <br/>
mysterious substance&#39;s purpose is to slowly feed the wick an <br/>
continuous supply of fuel, thus keeping the candle burning bright for <br/>
a long time. Even if it were safe to use, a combustive substance <br/>
would expend itself far too quickly for any candle manufacturer to <br/>
put it to this use. <br/>
<br/>
There is a special danger inherent to gel candles, but it has to do <br/>
with the effect of heat on the containers that house them, not with <br/>
the gel itself. If the material used to contain the goo is not <br/>
sufficiently resilient, it can shatter (i.e., &quot;explode&quot;) as the <br/>
concentrated heat of the candle&#39;s flame compromises it. The glass <br/>
containers used to hold these popular fragrance candles are sometimes <br/>
not made strong enough to withstand the heat they are called upon to <br/>
contain. Heat makes things expand, and in this case it can cause the <br/>
glass that houses the gel candles to shatter. There&#39;s no mysterious <br/>
gas that builds up, no strange chemical reaction brought on by <br/>
dangerous unnamed substances reacting to God-knows-what, just <br/>
ordinary expansion due to heat. Leave a coffee mug sitting on a hot <br/>
burner long enough, and you&#39;ll see the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
In this manner, a gel candle can explode in someone&#39;s hands, <br/>
resulting in dire burns as the hot gel flows out to coat the victim&#39;s <br/>
extremities. For this reason, it&#39;s important not to move either a lit <br/>
gel candle or one that has recently been extinguished. Extinguish the <br/>
candle and let it cool, then move it. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, some lit gel candles have been observed to flare up, <br/>
producing flames shooting a few inches into the air, but these <br/>
candles were quickly recalled by their manufacturers (e.g., the 1998 <br/>
recall of 1.7 million Glade gel candles that produced flames 3 inches <br/>
above the top of 2.5 inch containers). Should you encounter a gel <br/>
candle that flares like this, extinguish it promptly, don&#39;t use it <br/>
again, and contact the manufacturer for a refund. <br/>
<br/>
As for a fire started by a gel candle being &quot;so hot it melted the <br/>
smoke alarm,&quot; such a result wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with <br/>
whatever the candle was made from, but rather with the contents of <br/>
the home that became fuel for the growing conflagration. Also, that a <br/>
fire can (and often does) become hot enough to melt a smoke detector <br/>
does not, as the e-mail states, mean the melting occurs seconds after <br/>
the blaze starts, and therefore no warning is issued. Smoke detectors <br/>
are routinely found melted into blobs the aftermath of house fires, <br/>
but these are the same smoke detectors that went off as soon as smoke <br/>
was sensed, alerting residents to the fire. <br/>
<br/>
That gel candles will explode due to heat expansion shattering their <br/>
glass containers outward is fact; that they&#39;re made of a mysterious <br/>
chemical that touches off for no reason, with the uncontrolled <br/>
burning of this substance resulting in immediate flash fires that <br/>
melt everything in their path in a scant matter of seconds, is pure <br/>
invention. <br/>
<br/>
Because the heat expansion effect on the glass housings of gel <br/>
candles poses a real danger, this form of romantic lighting should <br/>
not be left lit for more than an hour or two. In common with all <br/>
candles, they should not be allowed to burn unattended (which <br/>
includes not leaving them lit while you drift off to sleep) or left <br/>
in reach of a child, even for half a moment. Unattended candles of <br/>
all stripes have started fires in which lives have been lost, so <br/>
don&#39;t take that caution lightly. As for kids and lit candles, it only <br/>
takes half a second to cause a lifetime&#39;s worth of scars. <br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a power outage, be careful with the candles you use. Don&#39;t <br/>
use a lit candle to check inside a cupboard or closet (this is a <br/>
light source that also sets things on fire, remember, such as items <br/>
hanging in a closet), and certainly never take a lit candle with you <br/>
to check on what you think might be a fuel leak. <br/>
<br/>
Candles: Use them responsibly, be they gel or wax. <br/>
