  <br><br><tt>Hi Tracy,<br>I too worried about &quot;spending that much time with my 
  children&quot; but two<br>things helped to clarify my views : a) if I don&#39;t want to 
  spend time with my<br>children, why not? Are they not the kind of people I 
  enjoy being with and if<br>not, can I help them become that type of person? 
  and b) If I, who love them<br>so desperately do not want to spend time with 
  them, who the hell 
else<br>will???<br><br><br>Regards,<br>Michelle<br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
