<div id="ygrps-yiv-27168267">I lived on Pennsylvania (I think) Street near Candelaria and Stardust Drive<br/>
near Louisiana and Comanche -- although also on Cathy St., which is nice and<br/>
short.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18759510">Where I lived in Memphis there were lots of road names that  were named for <br/>
the towns they connected.  Raliegh-LaGrange Road.   Collierville-Arlington <br/>
Road.  If you&#39;re new to Memphis, and don&#39;t know  anything about the surrounding <br/>
towns, it&#39;s a bit odd to see Col.-Arl. Rd.   What the heck does that mean?  It&#39;s <br/>
pretty common all across Tennessee to  name the towns &quot;-ville&quot; and name the <br/>
roads &quot;-ville Pike&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
And I won&#39;t even get into the parkways.  East Parkway  North.  South Parkway <br/>
East.  @@<br/>

but different quadrants; four 1st Streets=1st St. NW, 1st St. NE, 1st St. SW, <br/>
1st Street SE, four 2nd streets and so on-and the streets go up into at least <br/>
the 30s. We were COMPLETELY lost the first time we went down there, since we <br/>
weren&#39;t used to paying attention to the &quot;directionals&quot; on our streets up here. <br/>
Add to that the fact that most of the streets in downtown are one-way streets, <br/>
and it is SO easy to get lost if you aren&#39;t familiar with the area or the <br/>
street naming!<br/>
