<div id="ygrps-yiv-790239990">I don&#39;t know about this, it sounds interesting. I meant to say that my 11yo <br/>
daughter is really into the fictional diary series,&quot;Dear America&quot; (about <br/>
girls) Also &quot;My Name is America&quot; which is the one about boys and &quot;The Royal <br/>
Diaries.&quot; These books have accurate historical details and are multicultural. <br/>
I also got &quot;Don&#39;t Know Much About History&quot; and am very pleased with it. <br/>
Thanks for the tip.-Amalia-</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617067106">Hi Kristin<br/>
We have a bunch of books called Horrible Histories, most if not all are by<br/>
Terry Deary. There is the Terrible Tudors, the Awesome Egyptians, the<br/>
Blitzed Brits, The Rotton Romans, the Groovy Greeks, and loads more. Is that<br/>
what you mean?  They are fun!<br/>
Peace<br/>
Julie<br/>
