<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t posted for quite some time - I&#39;d like to hop in here, though.  It<br/>
is exactly the kind of comments where debate turns into attack that have<br/>
kept me from posting.  It&#39;s not exactly that I&#39;m not brave enough to post.<br/>
I&#39;m just not up to being used as someone else&#39;s figurative punching bag -<br/>
when one becomes the focus of an attack turned personal, sometimes it&#39;s even<br/>
harder to stay/get out of the fray.  I personally enjoy hearing other&#39;s<br/>
opinions - it opens my mind to seeing/understanding certain issues even<br/>
more.  I doubt if anybody holds to an opinion believing it to be completely<br/>
wrong.  I know no one who enjoys being bullied or pistol-whipped into<br/>
changing their opinions.  Even &quot;facts&quot; often prove nothing conclusively as<br/>
they can be interpreted differently at times.  I&#39;d like to see the list<br/>
reach the point that a few posts back and forth on an issue are enough to<br/>
satisfy us all that we&#39;ve been heard, whether we&#39;ve convinced anybody else<br/>
of our position or not.  I do get weary of someone trying to prove oneself<br/>
&quot;right&quot; on every issue regardless of the cost to the peace, dignity, and<br/>
respect of the atmosphere of the list and of individual posters.  Let&#39;s keep<br/>
the debate healthy and welcome dissenting opinions and additional facts<br/>
where relevant.<br/>
<br/>
O.K.  - anyone out there, go ahead and take your best shot, as I don&#39;t<br/>
intend to respond.  No, I&#39;m not chicken. Yes, I&#39;ve said all I want to say on<br/>
the issue.  Yes, I will read your opinions with interest (well,to a<br/>
point-LOL), and it really won&#39;t be a problem for me if you disagree.  I do<br/>
not feel compelled to pound this into the ground until I quote umpteen<br/>
websites, books, articles, personal experiences, or experts until I&#39;m sure<br/>
everyone knows how right I am or how right I think I am. ;-).<br/>
