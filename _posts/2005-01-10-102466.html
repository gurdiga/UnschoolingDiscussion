I love instruments that you can carry in a pocket or around your <br/>
neck. Something really cool about having your tunes handy for any <br/>
situation!:)<br/>
<br/>
I bought the soprano ocarina from Songbird and it sounds lovely. <br/>
I&#39;ve really been wanting the little silver pendant one. I bet it&#39;s <br/>
hard to get your fingers on those teensy holes though.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever heard of &quot;puny tunes&quot;? This guy made up his own <br/>
little instrument which is a tiny wood flute,  like a mix between a <br/>
recorder and an ocarina and called them Puny Tunes. He doesn&#39;t sell <br/>
them anymore, but a friend of mine gave me one...it&#39;s really cool.<br/>
