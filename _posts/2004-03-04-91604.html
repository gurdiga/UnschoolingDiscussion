<div id="ygrps-yiv-987628900">My boy ages 7 and 4 years will sometimes brush their teeth together.   But, <br/>
usually I have to do it with them.   I think there is something about this time <br/>
in their lives.   They like to know you are doing it, too.   Especially my <br/>
oldest.   So, get your brush out and be really fun and foam at the mouth!!<br/>
