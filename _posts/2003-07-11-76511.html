<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873810922">Most of the carpet in my house is teal green, some of the walls are painted teal, the blinds are green and the banister is teal green.  The year I put in the carpets my car was teal.  A friend asked me if I&#39;m going to have to redecorate when I get a new car (or vice versa). :-)<br/>
Some people think Jordan&#39;s passion for reptiles came about because my house is decorated in a South West style with lots of lizards (from Arizona and Mexico) in the decor :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104935493">Nothin&#39; funky about purple!  (grin)<br/>
My beautiful 80 year old California Bungalow is a beautiful shade of <br/>
grey-purple, with dusky plum trim.  It took me four months to get the right <br/>
color mix.  (I know.  Stop rolling your eyes and laughing.)  It looks great <br/>
with the lavender/rose of sharon/tulip tree/mexican sage/penstemon garden <br/>
out front.  (all purple flower&#39;d or friends thereof.)  It&#39;s very muted and <br/>
while some of the male neighbors think the house should be *tan* all of the <br/>
women love it so far.<br/>
<br/>
Just  remember to add a touch of yellow and white with a little grey <br/>
foliage to keep things interesting...<br/>
