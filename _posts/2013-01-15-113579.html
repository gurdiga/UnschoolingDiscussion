<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528027207">I&#39;ve been new to unschooling since last May, but just recently new to North Dakota.  I was wondering if there are any other unschooling families on here in North Dakota ( we are by the Montana border).  Sorry for the discretion, North Dakota homeschooling laws just have me a bit concerned with unschooling.</div>

Though someone might pop up here and give you some local info, this isn&#39;t really a place to ask.  <br/>

Ask in neighboring states if your state isn&#39;t listed.  Read the laws and understand them as well as you can.  Don&#39;t use the HSLDA site; they like to scare people.<br/>

That&#39;s overkill for most juristictions, but might give you confidence and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a symposium in Minneapolis in early May.  You might meet people there to stay in contact with, maybe.<br/>

I have ten registrations already.  There&#39;s a water park in the hotel, and tickets come with rooms.<br/>
