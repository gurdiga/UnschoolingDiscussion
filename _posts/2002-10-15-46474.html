<div id="ygrps-yiv-155837532"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I personally think you can unschool from birth, only because unschooling to<br/>
&gt; me means a lot more than just not doing school. Maybe it&#39;s a new term I<br/>
&gt; need, but that&#39;s what I and other unschoolers get out of it. More than just<br/>
&gt; educational needs. Most unschoolers say it&#39;s a lifestyle choice and that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mary, I think you&#39;re right about needing a new term.  I *do* think that<br/>
people who unschool from birth do some things (many things!) differently<br/>
than folks who are getting their children &quot;ready to learn&quot; for school.<br/>
<br/>
But I also understand the point that unschooling or homeschooling really<br/>
starts from the time your child doesn&#39;t go to kindergarten.  It&#39;s still<br/>
socially acceptable to stay home with your kids.  It&#39;s considered a bit odd,<br/>
but tolerated, to not send them to preschool.  It doesn&#39;t much bother people<br/>
that a child 4 years old does what they like, when they like to, at least<br/>
while at home.  <br/>
<br/>
But once your children pass that magical age of 5, it&#39;s very different than<br/>
staying home with your little ones.  Most people know about homeschooling<br/>
these days, in my experience.  And they have a very clear image what that<br/>
looks like.  But they act like you&#39;ve lost your mind when you try to<br/>
describe unschooling, when the answer to, &quot;What curriculum do you use&quot; is<br/>
none, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
The pressure to perform and conform begins with school, and that&#39;s when most<br/>
people feel they&#39;ve really stepped out of the mainstream.  So maybe a new<br/>
word will surface someday for those pre-School unschooling-but-not-quite<br/>
years.<br/>

I see what you are saying and agree. Have any suggestions for a good term? <br/>
Maybe we can all come up with something that suits us!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767997528">&lt;&lt;&lt;Again, it seems that all of society wants to make labels for everyone--unschoolers, homeschoolers, schoolers, radical unschoolers,  and so on. <br/>

<br/>
My husband and a good friend both asked me why I felt the need to have a &#39;label&#39;.  I guess I have been trying to catagorize myself.    I am unsure why.  I have been thinking about it and I still don&#39;t have a reasonable answer.   I am trying to discover more about my religion/beliefs (Christian/nonChristian???) and parenting styles/homeschooling (I am convinced that unschooling is the choice for our family).  I think I feel the need to have an answer for the questions others ask regarding these topics that will summarize my beliefs.  ???  What is everyone&#39;s opinion on this?<br/>
