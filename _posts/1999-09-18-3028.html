<div id="ygrps-yiv-25222781">Just wanted to say hi and welcome to all the new people on the list. Sorry<br/>
to say I&#39;ve gotten behind in my emails. I have a 6yo boy and this is our<br/>
first year at home. It has been a trying month so far, deschooling, but<br/>
hopefully things will start to develop some sort of flow.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all enjoy the list!<br/>

<br/>
We are in our first year of homeschooling. My son would have been in first<br/>
grade. He went to a town-run preschool 2 years ago that we both really<br/>
liked; the teacher was, looking back at it, very creative and the<br/>
environment was open and friendly. (I had only put him in preschool due to<br/>
pressure from everyone for my son to be &quot;socialized&quot; because he is an only<br/>
child. If I knew then what I know now!) The preschool teacher had warned us<br/>
that kindergarten was MUCH different than preschool, and she was so right.<br/>
Last year he went to kindergarten and lost all his inner motivation to<br/>
learn anything he calls &quot;educational&quot;, which included a lot. He even<br/>
stopped reading because they had a mandatory reading program for prizes<br/>
which he didn&#39;t want to do. By the end of the year he was &quot;bored&quot; (his<br/>
words), and didn&#39;t want to go back. Now the challenge is reawakening his<br/>
interest in new things without any appearance of schoolishness. Things are<br/>
improving a little each week, but we still have days of nothing but<br/>
computer games and TV, which I find frustrating. I can&#39;t get it out of my<br/>
head that we need to have something to show for our days at home when my<br/>
parents come over or we meet people at the store or at sports events who<br/>
question homeschooling.<br/>
