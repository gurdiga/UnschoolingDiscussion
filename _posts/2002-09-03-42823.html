<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524987521">I was just wondering about the whole evaluation testing thing.<br/>
<br/>
I live in FL and we have a thing called 600 schools that are listed as <br/>
private but can encompass the right to homeschool as well. That way we can <br/>
get out of testing and evaluations and sending in a NOI. Does any of the <br/>
other states have such a thing?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Kansas, we have to file, one time, a form (short) declaring ourselves a <br/>
nonaccredited private school. No testing, no evaluations, no notices of <br/>
intents... Lovely little thing. I don&#39;t even have to give the kids name, <br/>
rank, or serial numbers. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
