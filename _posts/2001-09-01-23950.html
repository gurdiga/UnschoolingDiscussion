<div id="ygrps-yiv-190880016">Does everyone remember the young man who got the perfect SAT scores.  Big<br/>
deal was made because they were homeless???<br/>
<br/>
Well, he was on the O&#39;Reilly Factor this evening.  O&#39;Reilly asked a couple<br/>
of times about his &quot;dropping out of school&quot; before the young man corrected<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Wellll, I was really surprised at O&#39;Reilly who usually does his homework and<br/>
is quick to pick up on things but he sure missed on this interview.  The kid<br/>
rambled on and on about religion, Bob Jones University AND how his religion<br/>
comes before his country.  He went on about what a moral person he is, blah,<br/>
blah, blah and then proceeded to lie to O&#39;Reilly about why they were<br/>
homeless while implying that his mother had quit her job and hadn&#39;t gotten<br/>
another one because she wanted to be home with the kids.  O&#39;Reilly asked a<br/>
couple of times about the homeless thing and mother getting a job and the<br/>
kid kept up with the she wanted to be home with the kids.<br/>

<br/>
What are the odds the mother lied to him about it though?<br/>
If he&#39;s a Bob Jones moralist, maybe there&#39;s some honor-thy-mother loyalty <br/>
that&#39;s more important than the country and more important than (or tied up <br/>
in) religion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145559792">No, because back when we discussed all this a few months ago, I e-mailed<br/>
them to get answers &quot;straight from the horses mouth&quot; so to speak.  They<br/>
share the same e-mail addy and they both responded to the questions.<br/>
<br/>
I just think it is another case of &quot;do as I say, not as I do,&quot; we are the<br/>
selected few and we make the rules sorta thing that I&#39;ve seen quite<br/>
frequently in quite a few of the 3Rs.<br/>
