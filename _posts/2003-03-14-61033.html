                                    With luck, Britain&#39;s pushy mothers were too busy shoving<br/>
                                    yesterday to read about Professor Stephen Bell&#39;s lecture on the<br/>
                                    advantages conferred a pushy mother.<br/>
<br/>
                                    As anyone who encounters these frightful creatures will know,<br/>
                                    what they need is a ball and chain, not encouragement. In<br/>
                                    response to the increased academic competition now faced by<br/>
                                    her children, the typical pushy mother has become something<br/>
                                    worse; she is remorseless, unstoppable, a human battering ram<br/>
                                    who tramples lesser specimens in her wake as she forges from<br/>
                                    tennis lessons, to ballet, to rocket science, to piano, to drama,<br/>
                                    to swimming, to additional tutoring, filling any spare moment<br/>
                                    with demands for extra homework and the search for possibly<br/>
                                    advantageous insider information on school scholarships and<br/>
                                    preferences, which is then jealously guarded from possible<br/>
                                    rivals.<br/>
<br/>
                                    In some cases the pushing urge is so dominant that the women<br/>
                                    cannot forbear from literally pressing their shrinking children -<br/>
                                    &quot;Go on, show your lovely picture!&quot; - towards any promising<br/>
                                    source of admiration or advantage. Even as he admires the<br/>
                                    astonishing and self-denying efforts made by these individuals,<br/>
                                    Bell should take pity on their miserable children and on the<br/>
                                    non-pushy mother who reads his remarks on the pushy model&#39;s<br/>
                                    accomplishments - &quot;She ensures that her child gains skills,<br/>
                                    capabilities and a certain orientation to schooling which work to<br/>
                                    constitute him or her as clever&quot; - and knows she has been found<br/>
                                    wanting.</div>
