<div id="ygrps-yiv-487558349">Sandra,<br/>
   I listened to the tape of you and Richard Prystowsky recently called <br/>
Seeing the Writing on the Wall Even When its Not There. It was great. I <br/>
learned a lot. You were talking about reports and writing for a real <br/>
purpose (like a review for Amazon). Then you told a story about Holly <br/>
hearing you and Marty, I think, talking about reports on books or <br/>
movies. And she enthusiastically said she wanted to write a report. And <br/>
you said to her, &quot;I don&#39;t want a report&quot;.  Now I trust that you had a <br/>
good reason but can you explain why you responded like this? I would <br/>
like to understand fully. I&#39;m thinking that maybe you wanted her to <br/>
understand that a report is written when someone wants one for a real <br/>
reason. A lot of parents, even unschoolers, would be tempted to try to, <br/>
in a subtle way, encourage writing, or at least not discourage. I don&#39;t <br/>
think you were really trying to discourage, but instead had some clear <br/>
good intention.<br/>
    I do know that with my son who has been to PS that I have to really <br/>
be careful not to react more to schoolish type interests, because he <br/>
picks up on it and has an aversion to doing these things if they are <br/>
considered schoolish and therefore more desirable. Recently, after I <br/>
had listened to yours and Richards tape, we went to Six Flags which my <br/>
son had been hankering after for some time. He was so excited and <br/>
afterwards talked a lot about it. (Now this is a kid who doesn&#39;t do a <br/>
whole lot of reading and never liked to write. He&#39;s 11. Recently I have <br/>
been making it known that invented spelling is totally fine and not to <br/>
hesitate to write because of not knowing how to spell. That has helped <br/>
a lot.)<br/>
      So after the Six Flags day, he announced one day that he had found <br/>
himself a journal downstairs that he could write in. I was totally <br/>
surprised because he always knew they were there and available. AND, <br/>
because he had never expressed any interest in writing. So I just said <br/>
somewhat casually, &quot;great&quot;. Then after breakfast, he said, &quot;I&#39;m gonna <br/>
go write in my journal&quot;. I could tell by the way he said it that he had <br/>
something to write about. I again responded casually. So he wrote in <br/>
his journal for a few days in a row in the same way they had done in <br/>
school, just writing about what they did the previous day etc.  I <br/>
almost slipped and asked him about it later and my initial reaction was <br/>
to praise him or kind of acknowledge that he had a breakthrough. But I <br/>
caught myself and didn&#39;t say anything just like I don&#39;t praise him for <br/>
video gaming stuff. If he&#39;s excited about reaching a new level tho, I <br/>
will share in his excitement with him. But he didn&#39;t mention the <br/>
writing so I didn&#39;t. I peeked later without him knowing. I was very <br/>
curious about the content and somewhat about the spelling. He was <br/>
writing about Six Flags! It was cute. Not a lot of writing, maybe half <br/>
a page which I guess is a lot considering it came from his own <br/>
motivation. YEA!  Spelling was as I expected. This was very encouraging <br/>
to me and interesting that his excitement about Six Flags inspired <br/>
writing. One interesting note is that all the entries were as tho he <br/>
were writing TO someone, like at the end he wrote something like, &quot; <br/>
I&#39;ll get back to you later&quot;.  So he wrote for maybe 6 days and thats <br/>
about it.<br/>
   Sorry this is long. Thanks for reading! And thanks for the talk by <br/>
you and Richard.<br/>

<br/>
As it turned out, I laminated it and used it in a workshop on writing.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We were joking around and I was telling them about school book reports, and <br/>
she said she wanted to write one.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a scanner working, but I&#39;ll try to put it up where people can <br/>
see it someday.   It&#39;s very decorated and decorative.<br/>
<br/>
-=-    I do know that with my son who has been to PS that I have to really <br/>
be careful not to react more to schoolish type interests, because he <br/>
picks up on it and has an aversion to doing these things if they are <br/>
considered schoolish and therefore more desirable. -=-<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was little I used to tease him if he would read something aloud <br/>
(the name of a business, or a word off a billboard) and say &quot;STOP!  If I wanted <br/>
you to read, I would have sent you to school.&quot;  He thought it was hilarious <br/>
that he was &quot;rebelling&quot; by learning to read against my will.<br/>
<br/>
It was along the lines of that when I told Holly I didn&#39;t want a report.  It <br/>
wasn&#39;t the reverse psychology of &quot;no, no, I really don&#39;t want one,&quot; though.  I <br/>
really did NOT want one!!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The last few years I taught, book reports took the form of private <br/>
discussions, with the  book in hand and the kid could look things up to read me good <br/>
parts or find characters&#39; names if they needed to.   I didn&#39;t care if they said <br/>
they didn&#39;t like the book, or that they had stopped &quot;here&quot; and showed me how <br/>
far they had gotten before they decided to bail.  The point was to discuss <br/>
something they had read (rather than to have finished and summarized a book).<br/>
<br/>
I do that sort of thing with my kids all the time, so the traditional written <br/>
book report to prove the book had been read, or to practice writing reports <br/>
(I shudder at that justification) has no place in my life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But he didn&#39;t mention the <br/>
writing so I didn&#39;t. I peeked later without him knowing. I was very <br/>
curious about the content and somewhat about the spelling. He was <br/>
writing about Six Flags! It was cute.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I noticed someone criticized your looking.  If he wanted it secret he <br/>
could&#39;ve hidden it.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids and husband read over my shoulder lots of times.  If I have something <br/>
secret to write (which is rare) I do it in secret.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby share my computer sometimes.  Sometimes they leave files <br/>
open.  Sometimes I&#39;ve had to look at an &quot;untitled&quot; or oddly named file on the <br/>
desktop to see where to put it.  I see their writing there.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I read into the record at that workshop (or at least passed <br/>
around for people to see) was some online role playing stuff of Kirby&#39;s.  It <br/>
was really good.  Its goodness wasn&#39;t in technicalities, but in the aliveness <br/>
of the language, in the &quot;voice&quot; of the character, and in the tenderness of the <br/>
treatment of the other character (he was being the dad to a young daughter, <br/>
and this wasn&#39;t a &quot;public&quot; scene, but was in a chatroom, just the two of <br/>
them---part of &quot;storyline,&quot; but not in the way of in-person D&D games in front of <br/>
the whole group).<br/>
<br/>
I got Kirby&#39;s permission to use that, though, before I used it.  I didn&#39;t get <br/>
his permission to read it before I read it.<br/>
<br/>
Now that he has his own computer, I wouldn&#39;t look at anything on there.  <br/>
What&#39;s on my physical or electronic desktop for me to have to move or clean up, <br/>
though, seems fair game.   <br/>
<br/>
My kids know my passwords.  They can look at stuff on my computer.  Things I <br/>
want to keep close (Christmas notes and such) are named things they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
think to look in.<br/>
<br/>
I found one of Marty&#39;s role playing scenes the other day.  It was really <br/>
sweet too.  <br/>
There&#39;s never cause in school to &quot;write something sweet.&quot;   All the sweet <br/>
stuff is love notes and they&#39;re confiscated and the kid&#39;s in trouble for writing <br/>
and passing them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sorry this is long. Thanks for reading! And thanks for the talk by <br/>
you and Richard.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well you&#39;re welcome. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are two other tapes of co-presentations by Richard and me.  I think <br/>
they&#39;re both better than the one on writing.   One is &quot;To Question or Not to <br/>
Question: That is the Question,&quot; and &quot;Peaceful Parenting.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I agree also. If they are writing among everyone else and talking about what<br/>
they are writing, it&#39;s pretty obvious they wouldn&#39;t mind sharing what it&#39;s<br/>
about. If they are writing alone in their room and not making announcements<br/>
about it, it&#39;s private.<br/>
<br/>
Random pieces of paper lying around, I pick up and read. A book kept in the<br/>
childs room, no I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra has taken to writing in an old diary that was Tara&#39;s. I don&#39;t know<br/>
where she got the idea from but I know she writes in it. I know because she<br/>
goes in her room alone, closes the door, sits on her bed and writes. A few<br/>
times when I was looking for her, I&#39;ve seen her do it. She has also asked<br/>
for a lock for it. I&#39;m going to buy her a new one for Christmas. Every now<br/>
and then she asks how to spell something. I am very curious about what a 7<br/>
year old is writing about but I haven&#39;t even ventured to open it. Just<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be right.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.<br/>
I thought it was a family-owned book left in a public room.<br/>
<br/>
The going fad among kids these days is online journals, written specifically <br/>
to be public, at least to their circle of friends.    One of Kirby&#39;s older <br/>
(20&#39;s) friends wanted Kirby&#39;s advice about a social problem.  Kirby asked for <br/>
background and the guy said &quot;read my journal,&quot; and Kirby said &quot;No,&quot; that he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to have to do his own research to help this guy with his journal.<br/>
<br/>
In a couple of recent deaths of teens, their online journals have been cited <br/>
as having clues or general information applicable to their state of mind and <br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose if there came to be some violent craziness in my family people <br/>
could pretty easily search lists archives and websites and quote me to the police <br/>
or the press.  <br/>
<br/>
The line&#39;s not as sharp as it was.  Marty writing in a book in his room isn&#39;t <br/>
nearly near Marty having an instant message window open on my computer.   <br/>
That&#39;s more like writing on a chalkboard in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
I have a xerox-box (paper box, but the not-so-generic name for the nice-lids, <br/>
holds ten reams of paper boxes) for each of my kids of things they want saved <br/>
but they don&#39;t want in their rooms, or things I&#39;m saving for them.  Birthday <br/>
cards from grandma.  The outfits they wore in their first birthday portraits.  <br/>
Samples of art and writing from when they were little.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s girlfriend broke up with him and he had a stash of letters from her, <br/>
folded into their own little origamish envelopes, decorated.   I put them in <br/>
his box for him.  I had no temptation whatsoever to read them.<br/>
<br/>
Twice when he&#39;s written notes to girls (one was typed and printed, one was <br/>
e-mail) he&#39;s asked me for help to say just what he wanted to say.   There&#39;s <br/>
another kind of blurring.  I&#39;m not his adversary.   The tradition of kids and <br/>
parents having lots of secrets from each other isn&#39;t the same in our family as in <br/>
the families of most of the kids my age I grew up with.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have online journals, but I&#39;ve seen a few of the other kids&#39;.  <br/>
Another mom and I were discussing a social problem among the homeschoolers, <br/>
and it ended up involving discussion of those journals.  She had seen them too.  <br/>
One of the boys was really angry and had put in blustery threats toward Marty <br/>
(posturing stuff) and we were hoping not to make things worse in a couple of <br/>
upcoming social gatherings.  Those kids have known each other since birth, <br/>
some of them, and have shared friends and activities.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or even in most of the families of the kids our own<br/>
kids are growing up with.<br/>
<br/>
I think the difference is between mutual respect and<br/>
mutual suspicion.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter Sarah has been writing a book for the last<br/>
3 years, on her own.  She has asked me not to read it<br/>
until she is done.  I know she will share it when she<br/>
is ready, or maybe not.  And I am ok with that.<br/>
<br/>
Respect leads to trust.  Sarah frequently shows me her<br/>
email and notes from her friends, her poems and songs<br/>
that she writes, tells me everything about their<br/>
conversations, etc. because I don&#39;t put her in a<br/>
position where she has to hide anything from me.<br/>
<br/>
A 17yo I know has been doing very risky things,<br/>
involving drugs, unprotected sex, stealing, etc.  His<br/>
parents can&#39;t trust him and have another, younger son<br/>
at home to protect.  So they do read his mail, his<br/>
IMs, etc.  They have spyware on their computer that<br/>
captures all the IMs so that they can read them.  I<br/>
think their actions are justified to protect the<br/>
younger brother and try to help the older boy.<br/>
<br/>
Another family I know does the same thing with their<br/>
teenage daughter, reading her e-mails and IMs and<br/>
listening in on the phone extension.  She is convinced<br/>
her parents are the ones who keep putting her tofu and<br/>
soymilk (which she buys with her own money) in the<br/>
freezer because she decided to be a vegetarian and<br/>
they don&#39;t want her to.<br/>

me think of the Simpsons every time).  Very strict<br/>
about behavior and conduct.  Sent him to school for<br/>
high school.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I understand their need to protect the younger<br/>
child so it sort of justifies in my mind reading his<br/>
mail and such.  Not that they didn&#39;t create the<br/>
problem to begin with, but the little guy shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have to suffer because of it, I suppose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     Correct. And I certainly have not been meaning to make a case for <br/>
the point<br/>
     of view that I think its ok. I don&#39;t. I agree that it is wrong to <br/>
read without asking<br/>
     first.  I think where I was coming from was more of a place of not <br/>
wanting to draw attention to<br/>
     the fact that he was writing for reasons I explained in the first <br/>
post. Since being in public school<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  he has been rebellious towards learning schoolish stuff, like <br/>
&gt; writing. So I was purposely acting like<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     it was no big deal because I wasn&#39;t sure how to handle it and I am <br/>
interested in how his &quot;unschooling&quot; is going.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     great suggestion. I just did that.<br/>
   I asked if he minded that I read it. He said, &quot;no, .....its just <br/>
boring stuff that I did.&quot; He replied very casually.<br/>
   Then I apologized for reading it without asking and he said very <br/>
casually, &quot;doesn&#39;t matter&quot;.<br/>
   But I do agree I was wrong.<br/>
