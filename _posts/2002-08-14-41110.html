&gt; Estrangement and distance in the family may not even be the worst<br/>
&gt; effects of schooling.... The idea that<br/>
&gt; often a school parent may &quot;take sides&quot; and act in favor of the school<br/>
&gt; and against their own child is just repulsive to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My bias is showing, but I find the stronger and stronger emphasis on<br/>
&gt; having very young children do homework to be hideous. ...<br/>

<br/>
First, government schools have, as one of their primary objectives<br/>
(unwritten, of course -- see Gatto) to emotionally separate children from<br/>
their parents. That makes it easier to do the indoctrination about how they<br/>
should all become &quot;employees&quot; and &quot;economic resources&quot; and consumers. Thus,<br/>
the estrangement you speak of is INTENTIONAL.<br/>
<br/>
Homework makes the parents work for the school -- and against their child.<br/>
Result: Resentment; estrangement, a conflict of loyalty...Schools call a<br/>
subject, Values Clarification, when the course is intended to challenge the<br/>
moral views that parents teach their kids.<br/>
<br/>
Schools make fun of parents, even while the schools claim to want to<br/>
&quot;involve&quot; them. But schools never allow parents to have a say in school<br/>
policies that affect their children or anything else that&#39;s important. (the<br/>
PTA / PTO  is controlled by the teacher unions)  Schools want parents to do<br/>
their bidding. For example: make sure the kids go door to door collecting<br/>
money for the band uniforms (or whatever -- it&#39;s always something) , get the<br/>
parents to come to school and paint the teachers&#39; lounge.....use them,<br/>
control them, make them pass the next budget with its raises for all the<br/>
teachers (good and bad teachers), but never let them control the school --<br/>
even though we tell the world there is this wonderful thing, Local Control<br/>
of public schools...it&#39;s all a big lie, there is no such thing. The teacher<br/>
union runs the school and the school system controls the town, today.<br/>
Elected school boards are puppets (rubber stamps) of the administrators.<br/>
<br/>
Homework is one of the mechanisms that the public school use in order to<br/>
control, not just the children when they&#39;re not in the school building, but<br/>
also the parents -- their time and energies must be directed toward the<br/>
child and the school.<br/>
<br/>
When schools say they want &quot;parent involvement&quot; this is what they mean --<br/>
helping the school control the children, even if it means giving the family<br/>
NO time to do things on their own, no time to take walks, etc. Time is taken<br/>
up with school demands.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, homework makes parents part of the school program, and makes<br/>
them feel partly responsible for how their child does. It also allows the<br/>
school to blame the parents when IT is found to be failing to educate<br/>
children. Public schools often blame parents and society for the schools&#39;<br/>
failure. Blame the victims. How convenient, but totally dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s another reversal...When schools fail, they blame parents, and raise<br/>
their own budgets.  The truly weird part is that no one complains.  What a<br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
Schools know that if they can make everyone preoccupied with demands, then<br/>
parents and the public will come to believe that the school is doing<br/>
something that &quot;must&quot; be important, and therefore worth all that money it<br/>
costs everyone.<br/>
<br/>
As we know, it&#39;s not. But until that ship sinks, it is getting bigger and<br/>
more expensive and more consuming every day.</div>
