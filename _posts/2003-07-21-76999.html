Spankers: Ever heard of Critical Incident Stress?  <br/>
It is the after-effects of &quot;rare emergencies&quot; as you call them (aka shell shock, cowardice [Gen. G Patton]).  It ruins people&#39;s lives.  Cops who think they have killed innocent people because the high speed drivers they were chasing ran into someone, or shoot kids with [toy] guns, or ambulance drivers who remove dead children from wrecks.  Fact: IT DESTROYS LIVES!<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s a kicker:  you can get it from living in fear - it&#39;s called PROGRESSIVE Critical Incident Stress and I know it well.  Comes from the craziness of a rage-o-holic father who hit a lot!  Who beat my little brother&#39;s ass black and blue with his belt. <br/>
<br/>
Or from being bullied at school/work.  And IMHO opinion, it&#39;s MORALLY wrong!  Even a little spanking can lead to this condition. Even a little spanking is morally wrong!<br/>
