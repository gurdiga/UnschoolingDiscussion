<div id="ygrps-yiv-552850870">Dear Sharon<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;As a distributor of curricula have you come in contact with many<br/>
 </span></blockquote>homeschoolers?&gt;&gt;<br/>
No, not as a distributor, but yes as one of the few that is actively<br/>
involved with our local HS Association and HSLDA.  The internet has also<br/>
been an amazing tool to bring the HS Community together though only a amall<br/>
percentage of HS&#39;ers have internet access.  One of the reasons possibly<br/>
being that we pay for all telephone calls (local too) and it&#39;s thus costly<br/>
if not used with discretion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Are the legalities uncomfortable in SA?&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  Things are hotting up as Government does not like the free-thinkers<br/>
that are being raised.  They are wanting total control also with regards to<br/>
curriculum & teaching method (quite a nightmare for unschoolers or even unit<br/>
study users).  We are expected to be satellite campuses for our local<br/>
schools.  The new set of evaluations that our children have to pass annually<br/>
is quite ridiculous & definitely not in our children&#39;s best interest! All<br/>
this will have to be contended in Court (the Ed Dept will however have the<br/>
onus of proving that their way is indeed the only way!)  Unfortunately it&#39;s<br/>
stressful & causing some families to put kids back into school to avoid the<br/>
confrontation (even though it&#39;s not in the best interest of the child!) So<br/>
far very few HS&#39;lers that have applied for registration (some don&#39;t, but<br/>
stay &quot;underground&quot;) have been registered and given permission to HS (we<br/>
don&#39;t just &quot;inform&quot; the Education Department but have to ask &quot;permission&quot; to<br/>
excercise our parental duties!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Do most folks do homeschooling now or less than in the past?&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re talking about before 1994 as the past (it was illegal to HS then)<br/>
yes, far more are HS&#39;ing now.  According to figures from Curriculum<br/>
Suppliers (the school-at-homers i.e ACE etc) there are about 25 000 families<br/>
HS&#39;ing (though many more are still &quot;underground&quot;).  Last year however more<br/>
HS&#39;ers wrote Matric (Gr 12 final examination before tertiary education) than<br/>
Private School Students did!!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What sort of school did you grow up with? Confusing, I would guess, by the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ages of you children I put you in late twenties.&gt;&gt; I&#39;m 33 and was educated<br/>
in various public schools, the most memorable being a small farm school (a<br/>
Three Room School House *grin*)  I also did some Nursing, Bible School &<br/>
studied Law (now I&#39;d say that&#39;s confusing!!) ...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I wonder if there is a way to be parents that isn&#39;t intensive?&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, there is: give birth to them and then hand them over to some Childcare<br/>
Centre to raise them while you bury yourself (and any feelings of guilt) in<br/>
your Career!  You then wish weekends and school holidays away so that you<br/>
can just get rid of the brats & have some time to youself again...<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards<br/>
