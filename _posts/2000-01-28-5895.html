<div id="ygrps-yiv-697458760">I just read about the adjustment pd you wrote about on your web site! I<br/>
think since I have always been a SAHM I may not have a long one since I took<br/>
this year off to send them both to school and have had major adjustment<br/>
issues with that! I find it impossible to give up control of my kids and am<br/>
glad for that. My kids were always home with me up till this year I always<br/>
had someone around and I regret we allowed him to watch a lot of tv when we<br/>
did. MY son was premature and has some what they label sensory issues and<br/>
when overstimulated tv helps to calm him down. He is also very frigtened of<br/>
being alone but not when actively engaged in something of interest. Do you<br/>
all have time limits on the tv watching? I used the tv as a baby sitter when<br/>
I wasn&#39;t in the mood to entertain them or do an activity so I could try and<br/>
cook dinner or clean up from the last meal we ate. It seems I am good at<br/>
cooking but not the clean up part. My house looks like a total disaster and<br/>
I had hoped this time with them in school I&#39;d be working on getting it<br/>
organized do the feng shui thing and become less dependent on tv and as you<br/>
mentioned outside influences. Really what I am most desiring to do is go on<br/>
adventures with the kids and I don&#39;t enjoy my solitude the way I thought I<br/>
would. I guess after they grow up I will have to find ways to enjoy it as I<br/>
have often craved it on those days when everyone was around. Are you able to<br/>
schedule any self time for your own needs and does your DH help you to just<br/>
take that time when he gets home?<br/>
I think it is important to do this esp. because you are just getting<br/>
adjusted you don&#39;t want to burn out your first month! I am sure journaling<br/>
is helping you though too. Just my .02 cents.<br/>

<br/>
About TV watching, we have never really set any limits on <br/>
that.  We don&#39;t have cable (by choice), the kids do watch <br/>
movies, but not all day long.  Sometimes the boys spend too <br/>
much time on the internet or playing video games, and that <br/>
is something we have to be careful of - they get so <br/>
hypnotized by these games that they can get very grouchy.  <br/>
Anyway our decision to turn off the electronics for several <br/>
hours a day has been a good one so far IMHO.  Yesterday <br/>
Zach got so engrossed in a book that he read half way <br/>
through Pokemon (!!!!!!!), which was in our allowed TV <br/>
time.  I know that the longer we unschool, the more <br/>
interests the kids will develop and the less dependent they <br/>
will be on outside influences for entertainment.  <br/>
<br/>
Being a new SAHM has presented some challenges.  I could <br/>
just do housework all day, but I have to let it go and <br/>
spend time with the kids.  It&#39;s hard for me to have a messy <br/>
house, but I&#39;m learning.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Now, in regards to having some time for myself, I married <br/>
just the most thoughtful man.  David actually suggested <br/>
that since I would be home with the kids all day that I <br/>
would need a mom&#39;s night out.  It surprised me, because <br/>
many husbands of SAHMs think that staying home all day is <br/>
like a vacation.  David is smart enough to know that <br/>
staying at home with all these kids and trying to teach <br/>
them something is one of the toughest jobs a mom (or dad)  <br/>
can do.  Anyway, you know I took him up on it and I&#39;ve been <br/>
going to a ladies Bible study on Monday nights.  Sometimes <br/>
I even go have coffee at Books a Million after and get home <br/>
at a sinful 10pm &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
David and I also lock ourselves in our room after 10pm <br/>
every night without fail.  We need our time - I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
trade that time for anything.  It revives me after a long <br/>
day and prepares me for the next.  (this is also a no TV <br/>
zone!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the helpful and supportive comments.  <br/>
That&#39;s why we&#39;re all here - isn&#39;t it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176536382">Betsy I am so happy for you and your new marriage and family life it all<br/>
seems very romantic and exciting watching how you all come together and work<br/>
through the rough spots kind of like the movie &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;<br/>
starring Lucille Ball (my fav all time funny comedian I can still have great<br/>
laughs watching I Love Lucy) only you are way more together and less self<br/>
absorbed and aware than Lucy was! Glad your Dh lets you have that time and<br/>
offers it to you mine rarely does that though he doesn&#39;t ever try and stop<br/>
me he loves being with the kids too but has trouble feeding and getting them<br/>
to bed before I get home no matter how late it is usually if they are in bed<br/>
they are still up and hungry from eating only beans and rice or pasta the<br/>
only meals he knows how to cook! :o)<br/>
I am interested in the routine thing you mentioned. I wonder if it is more a<br/>
natural rythm of life that is more a kin to how it used to be for prior to<br/>
industialization that we all need to relearn? Only we are luckier being on<br/>
the planet in this time as we all don&#39;t have to have farmers hours or make<br/>
everything from scratch though I have wanted to do bread from scratch and<br/>
save money from being more self sufficient that way.<br/>
