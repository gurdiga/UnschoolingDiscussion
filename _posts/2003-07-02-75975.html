<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925893089">****You could easily give someone $100 to tell you you should put her in<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
You KNOW that&#39;s not the answer, but what other answers could possibly be<br/>
<br/>
expected to come from a professional who became &quot;professional&quot; by 18 or<br/>
20 years<br/>
in school?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think drugs or daycare would help?****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
God no!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****First brainstorm with your husband what &quot;professional help&quot; he<br/>
thinks would<br/>
help.  Play therapy?  (Are there serious home problems?  I doubt it--you<br/>
said<br/>
this was from birth, and play therapy isn&#39;t going to get to a genetic<br/>
level--they&#39;re looking for trauma or odd relationships or behaviors on<br/>
the part of<br/>
other family members in her life which she would act out with dolls or<br/>
puppets.)****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No serious home problems,  just the usual sort.  No abuse of any kind.<br/>
She&#39;s been like she is all her life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****I&#39;d mention it.****<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m think I&#39;m going to.  We&#39;re going tomorrow night, I&#39;ll bring it up<br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****Two friends of mine are in counselling and the counsellor has a<br/>
GREAT plan.<br/>
One of their major problems is the relationship between the dad and the<br/>
middle<br/>
child, older of two boys.    That child is most like the mom (hmmmm) and<br/>
the<br/>
dad is MEAN to him.<br/>
Sandra****<br/>
<br/>
Jeff isn&#39;t mean to Storey, but she is most like him.  Intense, hard to<br/>
get their attention when they are concentrating on something, do not<br/>
like to be told what to do or say.  Maybe that&#39;s why he finds her so<br/>
difficult and maybe that&#39;s why mil has such a hard time with her.  Jeff<br/>
is her baby, the last of 7, and was not a planned child.  His parents<br/>
divorced when he was about 3 and she never really had much time for him<br/>
(he is also the only one of the 7 who was never breast fed, she says she<br/>
was burned out).  Maybe Storey brings up too much stuff for her to<br/>
handle or even recognize.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****there are great outcomes when you are blessed with such a child! -<br/>
but this is NOT an &quot;easy&quot; child****<br/>
<br/>
You got that right.  And the older she gets the more I see how<br/>
incredible she is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****Maybe try the &quot;Highly Sensitive Child&quot; book so often recommended<br/>
here!  Might helps you and maybe your<br/>
husband undestand her.****<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll look into that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****Maybe take a look at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bullyonline.org">http://www.bullyonline.org</a> generally and maybe<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bullyonline.org/familybully/index.htm">http://www.bullyonline.org/familybully/index.htm</a> for help with mil.<br/>
Great site!  Helped me see where the<br/>
lines of help/hurt are a lot more clearly.<br/>
Tim T****<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this, I&#39;ll check this out too and share it with Jeff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****My mother in law is difficult.  Not as bad as yours sounds, but not<br/>
too fun<br/>
for too long.<br/>
Sandra****<br/>
<br/>
I guess I didn&#39;t realize how difficult.  When Robin was born, he was so<br/>
easy and she praised me for being such a good mom.  Funny, now I&#39;m a bad<br/>
mom with one good kid and one bad kid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****If anyone needs professional help to learn how to &#39;behave properly&#39;,<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
your mother in law.  Have you tried telling her privately that she needs<br/>
to<br/>
stop interfering in your mothering?<br/>
~Rue****<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m actually a little afraid of her!  She&#39;s very good at manipulating<br/>
people&#39;s words into something other than they said.  And I&#39;m not<br/>
experienced with that.  Jeff has stood up to her, but he knows how she<br/>
operates.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much for the help and advice everyone.  Jeff and I will talk<br/>
about this in counseling and alone.<br/>
<br/>
Kate<br/>
Who&#39;s feeling less alone on this issue now.</div>
