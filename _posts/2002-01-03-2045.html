<h4>The Mowery Family</h4>
<time> 3 Jan 2002, at  9:57am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757264649">Joe bought me Roller Coaster Tycoon with the Loopy Landscapes expansion pack and I am having a ball playing this game.  However, I am not so great at building my own coasters, especially those that would go inside a mountain, etc.  I am also having difficulty figuring out how to join a path to something at a higher grade, I can&#39;t figure out the platform deal.<br/>
<br/>
I have watched the tutorial(not enough detail), gone to the RCT website(way more advanced than I) but I need help in between.  I was wondering if any of you or your kids play/love this game and could give a newbie some assistance.<br/>
<br/>
You can contact me on list or off, just make sure the heading refers to the game.<br/>
<br/>
TIA, <br/>

PS.  I can&#39;t wait for Dana to read so she can play this game - it has so many learning opportunities!  Math, marketing, physics and on and on - plus it is flat out fun!!! <br/>
