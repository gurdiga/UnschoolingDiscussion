She&#39;d fit in SO very well here!! I was doing a makeover for a friend <br/>
yesterday that was having some skin problems. We did a facial and while I was <br/>
doing the make up, Sierra and her new neighborhood girlfriend from three <br/>
doors down were watching.<br/>
Shay kept saying (imagine wide eyed six y.o. here) &quot;my Mom has GOT to meet <br/>
you&quot; as she shakes her head in awe. It was all I could do to not laugh, she <br/>
was so cute.<br/>
Apparently her Mum loves makeup too. Shay and Sierra gave each other make <br/>
overs with the makeup they got for Christmas. They are six and five years <br/>
old, respectively.<br/>

complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
