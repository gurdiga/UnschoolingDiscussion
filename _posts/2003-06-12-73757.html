<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202435392">From: &quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...">bunsofaluminum60@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Another table rule of ours: taste everything on your plate. If<br/>
there&#39;s something you don&#39;t like, you don&#39;t have to eat it. But at<br/>
least taste it. I&#39;ve learned what&#39;s &quot;edible&quot; around here, and what<br/>
isn&#39;t, but trying things is a good habit, IMO. If it&#39;s yucky, I have<br/>
no problem with them saying so.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is a nice idea in theory.  Try to make my 4yo try <br/>
something new and he would be in tears and probably hypervenitlaing <br/>
within minutes..LOL!!  I struggled with him when he was a baby.  He <br/>
loved his baby food and trying to wean him off to table food was <br/>
torture.  He still has a very limited number of things he will eat <br/>
(unless it involves chocolate and then suddenly it all looks good ;) <br/>
but it does not bother me anymore.  He makes alot of healthy choices <br/>
and is a healthy, strong boy.  In fact, he still gets a good bit of <br/>
fruit from the baby food aisle..LOL!  If we happen to read a book or <br/>
watch a show related to picky eaters I will remind him they seem to <br/>
be enjoying new food.  He agrees but cannot seem to truely comprehend <br/>
he is one.  My dh was the same way when he was little and now tries <br/>
more things than me so obviously making kids try things has no huge <br/>
influence over how they will be as adults.  My 2 yo will come up and <br/>
just grab something out of your hand if the mood strikes.  I have <br/>
realized it just comes down to personality.  Your kids may be more <br/>
easy going about trying things so it may not be coersive for you.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I think some parents can get so caught up in these power <br/>
struggles over food that they lose sight of what it important.  My <br/>
BIL has this big issue over eating as a family and they got to the <br/>
point with their picky eater son where they forced him to eat what <br/>
was on the table or he would get nothing.  They claimed all he wanted <br/>
was chicken nuggets and the such which was not healthy.  Well, my <br/>
first thought is who introduced him to all that *crappy* food and  <br/>
then does not want to let him eat it?  My poor SIL HATES dinner time <br/>
because it is full of fighting.  She wants to hide in the bathroom.  <br/>
Her dh is on her because she is below weight but he does not realize <br/>
that the stress of dinner just contributes to her not wanting to <br/>
eat.  Also, my BIL is the PICKIEST eater.  In fact, outside of my FIL <br/>
I do not know anyone as picky as him.  He will not try anything new.  <br/>
SO how the hell does he justify his son looking at food and finding <br/>
it gross and expecting him to eat it whereas he would never want to <br/>
try it.  These are the really *old-fashioned* parents who are always <br/>
in that &quot;I have all the power&quot; mindset, kind of the Wonder Years <br/>
Dad.  It is so stupid and sad really.  Here you have a chance to have <br/>
a nice dinner with your kids and you ruin it over food.  Of course, <br/>
now he eats different things so people like my BIL say it works and <br/>
of course everyone should just do it that way.  Two of my BIL&#39;s have <br/>
that same attitude &quot;Well, if he won&#39;t eat it that way then he just <br/>
wouldn&#39;t eat!&quot;.  It is not worth the battle or control to me, when he <br/>
is ready he will try new things.  At this point, I could really care <br/>
less :) and we are all happy!<br/>
