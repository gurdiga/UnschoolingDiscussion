<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861811996">Dh and I have food issues from different ends of the spectrum (although he<br/>
would deny having issues at all).  I would like to allow my children to grow<br/>
up issue free but that doesn&#39;t sem to be happening.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember my parents being hugely restrictive about my food choices.<br/>
But I was the youngest of 7 and a lot of things were decided based entirely<br/>
on funds.  We didn&#39;t really have sweets around the house much mostly just on<br/>
special occasions.  Most of my childhood I remember my mom being sort of the<br/>
health food nut and my dad the white bread eater.  :)  He would buy chips<br/>
ahoy cookies and hide them they were HIS and no one else was allowed them.<br/>
That said my mom had a particular weakness for chocolate covered almonds.<br/>
We ate veggies and weren&#39;t forced to or harrassed about it.  Fruit was a<br/>
good treat.  We all had our &#39;favorite&#39; foods and foods we hated and everyone<br/>
seemed pretty understanding about it all.  My parents weren&#39;t big on the<br/>
clean plate club thing (either that or it never affected me because I was a<br/>
&#39;good eater&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
This has lead to me now.  I eat basically whatever.  I have very few things<br/>
I really don&#39;t like (basically just spicy things).  I love veggies but don&#39;t<br/>
make a lot myself because I hate the prep involved.  I love meat, bread,<br/>
pasta basically I just love food.  And I really like &#39;good food&#39; as in a<br/>
well planned meal in a nice restaurant.  I love the way food tastes.  And I<br/>
get a lot of emotional satisfaction from eating.  I do love sweets.<br/>
Although I am finding that as an adult with no one hiding the cookies away<br/>
I&#39;m finding myself a little more discriminating in the sweet department.  I<br/>
don&#39;t like hard candies or other sweets without fat.  :)  I like cheese cake<br/>
and apple pie.  Gotta have a little bit of the salty in there.  It&#39;s comfort<br/>
food.  The downside to all of this is I weigh 240 lbs (I&#39;m only 5&#39;1&quot; so that<br/>
is a LOT).<br/>
<br/>
DH looks at his childhood and discounts anything people argue about<br/>
controlling food leading to food issues.  His parents were EXTREMELY<br/>
controlling about food.  And he was very stubborn!  He tells the classic<br/>
story of not eating his spinach and having it served for the next 4 meals.<br/>
Sitting at the table ALL night refusing to eat peas.  Having Halloween<br/>
divvied out over months.  The more his parents controlled the more he and<br/>
his siblings fought them.<br/>
<br/>
Now he loves veggies (but only raw or lightly steamed) and he will eat<br/>
anything!!  He&#39;s not a food lover like I am he doesn&#39;t seem to care if it&#39;s<br/>
a fancy restaurant or Mc D&#39;s as long as it&#39;s food and there&#39;s a lot of it.<br/>
The part he ignores though is his early childhood.  He was adopted by the<br/>
above mentioned controlling parents at age 9!!  Before that he grew up in a<br/>
small fishing village in Korea, food was scarce there and he remembers that<br/>
everyone got a bowl of rice and some chopsticks.  All the food was served<br/>
&#39;family style&#39; which meant you snapped up one bite or so at a time and put<br/>
it on your rice and ate it.  You learned to grab what you wanted and eat<br/>
fast because it was first come first serve and the little kids were at a<br/>
clear disadvantage.  All veggies were steamed or raw.  In between the two<br/>
meals a day you were pretty much on your own to find edible things.  He<br/>
tells stories of eating raw sea slugs from the bay and stealing fruits and<br/>
veggies from neighbors yards.  Sweets were basically non existent except for<br/>
some candies they would get from military people on rare occasion.<br/>
<br/>
Now he hardly eats sweets at all.  He passes up birthday cake and ice cream<br/>
cones and deserts of all kids.  This is completely foreign to me :)  He&#39;s a<br/>
big pop drinker though and shovels food which drives me crazy!!!<br/>
<br/>
Like I said our combined food issues lie all over the spectrum.  I&#39;m better<br/>
at limiting my overall intake of food while he&#39;s certainly better at<br/>
limiting his sweets.  We both love veggies but I like a wider variety of<br/>
cooking styles.  He has issues with the &#39;clean your plate&#39; thing that I<br/>
don&#39;t have.  And we both have a hard time &#39;wasting&#39; money on the junk food<br/>
our kids want rather than the junk food WE want!!!!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
DD4yo likes pastas and to a lesser degree meats.  Broccoli is about the only<br/>
veggie she will eat.  Big Bread eater.  LOVES pop, loves sweets of all kind<br/>
but generally won&#39;t finish a hard candy or sucker (but wants them every time<br/>
she can anyway)  She wants yogurt more than anything in the world.  hungry<br/>
ALL OF THE TIME except at &#39;meal time&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
DS2yo eats meat.  LOVES ice cream!  Milk, eggs, seafood, will eat pasta but<br/>
really loves meat.  Basically if it&#39;s an animal product he wants it.  Does<br/>
not eat veggies except maybe broccoli ever 4th time or so.  EATS!  Like<br/>
daddy that way.<br/>
<br/>
They both love fruit!  I don&#39;t know, I look at it all here in writing and it<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem all that bad.  My issues are that I have a hard time buying the<br/>
things they like.  DD loves yogurt and I have a hard time justifying it<br/>
because it&#39;s like .50 a container.  Never mind that I buy pop which is about<br/>
the same price and WAY less nutritious!!  Money has always been really tight<br/>
and now hat It&#39;s not so much I&#39;m trying to work myself out of miser mode.<br/>
It&#39;s hard.  before basically anything that varied from the menu just wasn&#39;t<br/>
going to get bought.  Now that money&#39;s not so much an issue it&#39;s like that<br/>
thinking is still stuck in my head.  But now it&#39;s like someone else voice<br/>
coming out of my mouth saying &#39;no&#39; to all requests.  I don&#39;t WANT to be like<br/>
this!<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s not just that way with food though.  I think it&#39;s from being the baby<br/>
of 7.  Somewhere along the line I learned to be really miserly with money<br/>
and have to &#39;justify&#39; every purchase.   Even when we have the money I have a<br/>
hard time justifying spending it on things like that.  Then at the same time<br/>
my &#39;weaker&#39; side that loves dining out and hates cooking will use the same<br/>
money, I earlier denied my children, to take the whole family to dinner at<br/>
Jack In The Box!<br/>
<br/>
So here are my problems in a nutshell.  DH is big on clean plates (but<br/>
thinks that &#39;worked&#39; for him so it will work for our kids).  DH uses sweets<br/>
as a reward (and denies them as punishment) I use them to celebrate a job<br/>
well done and to show love.  I refuse requests for impulse purchases in the<br/>
store.  Dh says things like &quot;You can chose to get this bag of chips (that I<br/>
want as opposed to the ones you want) or nothing.&quot;  In both of our minds<br/>
&#39;picky eating&#39; is a bad thing and &#39;good eaters&#39; are a good thing.  Pop both<br/>
flows endlessly and is all caught up in power struggles in our home.  The<br/>
only universally agreed upon veggie is broccoli (and we adults both like<br/>
salad).  Everyone loves fruit but I hardly ever buy it because it&#39;s so damn<br/>
expensive and it&#39;s all gone in the first 2 days!!!<br/>
<br/>
Help, advice, comments, welcome!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
Maybe for an educational and entertaining outing, take the kids to the store <br/>
and let them pick out ANY one thing each.<br/>
<br/>
Or... make a list of them brainstorming what they would like to have from the <br/>
store if you had a million dollar shopping spree one day.  And if you get the <br/>
things, try not to leave one kid out.  If they brainstorm, you might find <br/>
them all shout YES! about one choice or another.<br/>
<br/>
It will be healing for you, maybe, and exciting for them, and might lead to <br/>
more loosening up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172429954">Katie, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re in this boat alone.  I, and to some extent I <br/>
think all of us, still struggle with old hang-ups.  I&#39;m pretty new to <br/>
all of this...unschooling, eating whatever, whenenver, no sleep <br/>
schedules.  Even though we&#39;ve pretty much been doing these things all <br/>
along, now I&#39;m actually saying it out loud and part of me is thinking, <br/>
&quot;you&#39;re crazy!&quot;  But I&#39;m doing it anyway because I&#39;m a firm believer <br/>
that the &quot;crowd&quot; isn&#39;t always right.  Common sense tells me that these <br/>
changes are right.  It still doesn&#39;t help that little voice inside that <br/>
is the Past Me.  All those ingrained childhood things may never go away.<br/>
<br/>
Does your husband feel things aren&#39;t right?  I&#39;ve discussed with my dh <br/>
what I&#39;m learning from all of you and he thinks it&#39;s a joke.  But I&#39;m <br/>
the childbearer and raiser of this house, so what I say goes.  To tell <br/>
you the truth, I&#39;m trying to make these changes quietly though because <br/>
I&#39;d rather he didn&#39;t notice too much too soon.  I hate to fight with <br/>
people, even though sometimes I do anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, don&#39;t beat yourself up.  The first step in making a change is <br/>
seeing the need to change.  I myself have started researching health and <br/>
exercise at sites like Mayoclinic.com.  Knowledge is power.  You don&#39;t <br/>
have to change anything right now.  It doesn&#39;t even sound like things <br/>
are that bad.  If you decide to start implementing changes, you&#39;ll <br/>
always find support here and I&#39;m sure in a lot of other places, too.   <br/>
Good luck,  Heidi  <br/>

<br/>
It doesn&#39;t work as well for me and Keith as it does the kids, because we were <br/>
trained to &quot;reward&quot; with food, and &quot;special&quot; with food and &quot;you deserve it&quot; <br/>
with food.<br/>
<br/>
The kids don&#39;t have those associations.<br/>
<br/>
But having lots of something makes it last longer than having a little here.<br/>
<br/>
Keith is only lately getting to where he will not finish off chips.  For a <br/>
long time he would say &quot;I don&#39;t want to buy chips because I&#39;ll just eat them <br/>
all.  Finally others complained and once I said &quot;Well DON&#39;T eat them all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was simple, yet not simple.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just taking longer for us than for the kids.  They had zero years of <br/>
conditioning to overcome.  We had over thirty years of first parental <br/>
this&#39;n&#39;that, and then the years of CELEBRATION that we could eat the things <br/>
and eat the ways that had been forbidden!!<br/>
<br/>
All that was pretty silly, and we hadn&#39;t considered really just eating what <br/>
it seemed our bodies needed or wanted WHEN our bodies communicated.   That <br/>
came because we wanted to give Kirby as good an environment as we could.  So <br/>
we&#39;re following him, only he&#39;s way ahead of us, having been doing it since <br/>
infancy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfooding is really the most basic diet practice around: eat what you want,<br/>
when you&#39;re hungry.  Don&#39;t eat because you&#39;re bored, sad, frustrated, happy,<br/>
socializing, etc. unless what you&#39;re putting in your mouth is something you<br/>
really want and you are hungry.<br/>
<br/>
In theory, it sounds very reasonable.  In practice, it&#39;s a little more<br/>
complicated because of long-time food issues.  But I agree that having more<br/>
around means I eat less.  I used to crave m&m&#39;s.  I have a full container of<br/>
them and two more bags of Valentine m&m&#39;s in the cupboard.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
them.  I think I put on a pound or two in the process, but I&#39;ve stabilized<br/>
and starting to lose weight now, slowly.  So it&#39;s working so far.<br/>
<br/>
Big thing for me has been to pour a drink first.  I tend to eat when I&#39;m<br/>
thirsty, when I&#39;m bored, etc.  So now I drink crystal light.  No calories,<br/>
etc., but more satisfying to me than water.  A glass or so later, I&#39;m not<br/>
interested in food any more.  Bathroom, yes.  Food, no.  ;)<br/>

  around means I eat less.  I used to crave m&m&#39;s.  I have a full container of<br/>
  them and two more bags of Valentine m&m&#39;s in the cupboard.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
  them.  I think I put on a pound or two in the process, but I&#39;ve stabilized<br/>
  and starting to lose weight now, slowly.  So it&#39;s working so far.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115939381">I must say, I am shocked to find so much advice on an unschooling list about restricting all sugar and white flour, as though that were the root of the problem. <br/>

He sounds very much like my second ds. He is always drawn to simple carbs and was a very picky eater for a very long time, still is fussier than anyone else in the house.<br/>
I think your whole thing about making them finish what they eat is a very bad idea. His resistance to eating sounds very much like a control issue, and I think the sooner you give him true control, the faster you&#39;ll see him being willing to try new things and eat better.<br/>
This worked beatifully for Jared, and though he is still very skinny, I don&#39;t worry because I see him eating a lot of variety.<br/>
Until you truly let him take charge of his eating, he will resist.<br/>
Try protein shakes as a &quot;treat&quot;. We blend about 1/2 can of frozen OJ concentrate, 1-2 handfuls of frozen berries (raspberries are wonderful), some soy milk and whatever supplements he may need. Blend well for a creamy, delicious and yet healthy snack.<br/>
Adding protein powder would be a good idea right now when he needs calories so much.<br/>
Also, there are oodles of healthier snack foods at health food stores. Cookies and such that actually have some health value, but taste great too.<br/>
I don&#39;t think more control is going to have a good outcome in the long run. Making kids eat what they take is a great way to cause eating disorders...I think your ds might be living proof of that.<br/>
My SIL was bulemic for years over that very same issue.<br/>
Let it go. The waste to the human psyche/emotional health is far greater than any food costs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190418486">Thought you could use a chuckle.  I was reading at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a> about food issues and came across the following:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;We went out to eat at Olive Garden last night and the boys got this<br/>
activity sheet/menu to do while we waited. It had a cross word puzzle on it<br/>
and we were doing it. I was reading the questions and the boys were<br/>
answering. Questions like &quot;Spaghetti is a _________.&quot; Well, the last<br/>
question was &quot;Clean your __________.&quot; My boys had no idea what that could be<br/>
that would deal with food. <br/>
<br/>
I gave them the answer then looked at Jackson, we were both brought up<br/>
hearing that phrase every day. I am so glad my boys have never heard it. Pam<br/>
G. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I thought to myself...my kids have never heard anyone say &quot;clean your plate&quot;<br/>
either, I don&#39;t think.  I wonder what they would fill that blank in with.  I<br/>
explained to my 9 yo dd that a placemat had these fill in the blanks and had<br/>
her answer a couple that I made up.  Then I gave her &quot;Clean your ____.&quot;  She<br/>
answered that one with ass.  LOL!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850209379">Hello!!!  I need a little support.  I&#39;m really having a hard time letting go of the food issues in regards to the kids.  I battle with the kiddlets to eat healthy foods.  One will eat fruit, but expects a treat after.  The other eats NO fruit and some veggies.  In my manical mind, I keep thinking he&#39;s gonna get scurvy!!!<br/>
<br/>
How can I begin the process of letting my children choose their own foods.  Do I get rid of most of the &quot;junk&quot; food in the house so they only have healthy choices?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to have food issues.  I want them to grow up and be healthy and eat healthy.  Please give me step by step instructions and/or advice on how to reach this goal.<br/>

Thanks so much for anyone that responds.<br/>

There.  That is the easiest food advice ever.  It was 100% painless<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just a few weeks ago i asked something similiar so i am no expert and although i have backstepped occasionnally in the past few weeks things have gotten better.<br/>
our issue isnt kids that wont eat fruit and vegtables (although i have one that has limited repetoire of them).  our issue is eating too much. and always wanting what the person next to them has.<br/>
so i have started putting LOTS of choices out.  For ex.  lunch yesterday was a big plate of strawberries and carrots with ranch, a plate of whole wheat crackers cheese and ham, fruit smoothies and some fruit roll ups.  if someone asks for something else i add enough for all.. like i think someone requested pretzels and the smoothies were an extra request too.  after lunch the carrots, strawberries (we have had alot lately) were left.  i refilled the ham once and added a few more crackers.  They ate the strawberries throughout the afternoon and i think i ate most of the carrots.  <br/>
Honestly, I am coming to realize our health is going to be more compremised by the stress that I am inflicting on the family than the extra food could.<br/>
Just an update to my past posts.  My son, who I said never realizes he is full, just came up to me and told me his belly is stuffed.  He ate two bowls of cereal, a mini bagel and after seeing his brother with pretzels asked for some of those.  In the past I would have told him, &quot; no, your full.&quot; but i gave him a few, half of which he fed to the dog, and then announced that his belly was full.  he has been so much happier lately.</div>

<br/>
Don&#39;t think of them as a team of kiddlets.  It seems unrelated, but it  <br/>
isn&#39;t.  You&#39;re each individual child&#39;s partner in getting what he  <br/>
feels he needs.  If he can no longer (or never could) feel what he  <br/>
needs, you have some undoing to do!  But that&#39;s okay.  LOTS of people  <br/>
here have undone things and can help you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In my manical mind, I keep thinking he&#39;s gonna get scurvy!!!-=-<br/>
<br/>
In your school-trained mine is where scurvy lives.  The only scurvy in  <br/>
your life was introduced by school and it&#39;s still causing you &quot;a  <br/>
battle&quot; (your own phrase).<br/>

<br/>
If you really work on deschooling yourself, the parenting issues will  <br/>
dissolve as well.  It takes a while, but it takes the conscious wish  <br/>
to make decisions based on what your new principles are becoming.<br/>

<br/>
Say yes more often.  Don&#39;t say no so much.  Be happier about food,  <br/>
when you can be.  Be generous with food.  Don&#39;t force them to finish  <br/>
one thing in order to get another thing.<br/>

<br/>
Step one:  Change the way you see the world.<br/>
That&#39;s the whole process!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This might help, too, though, about gradually moving toward it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The really interesting thing is how everyone has a different idea of<br/>
what is &quot;junk&quot; and what is healthy.  If you can recognize that kids have<br/>
their own ideas and you respect those ideas, it should logically follow<br/>
through with things such as food.  What a kid might consider good, you<br/>
might consider junk.  That judgement won&#39;t help a kid learn how to be<br/>
thoughtful and considerate about their own judgements and their own<br/>
decisions about the world, which food is a big part of, since we have to<br/>
have it to live!<br/>
<br/>
Offer as many choices as you can.  If a kid likes gummy bears, try many<br/>
different kinds of gummy bears, try making gummy bears, decorate things<br/>
with gummy bears.  If you consider gummy bears to be junk, you&#39;ll be<br/>
missing out on some gummy bear fun.</div>
