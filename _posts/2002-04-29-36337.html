hundred years ago   B) Popper solved the problem of replacing it     C) The<br/>
Frabric of Reality by David Deutsch, esp chaps 3 and 7 explains the subject<br/>
very well.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re *really* curious I&#39;ll copy/paste an explanation I wrote below.<br/>
I&#39;m not expecting anyone to read it or discuss it, I&#39;m just offering it as<br/>
information to those who want.<br/>
<br/>
***WARNING: The Below Is Off-Topic For This List And May Be Boring***<br/>
<br/>
Induction goes like this.  You make a bunch of observations.  You<br/>
generalize them into a theory.  You make more observations to test the<br/>
theory.  If they fit, then you have a good theory.  This is impossible, has<br/>
never happened, and wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
The first problem is that **any finite set of observations can support an<br/>
infinite number of theories**.  So how do you generalize observations into<br/>
one theory when there are infinite choices?  You don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The next problem is that no matter how many white socks I find, there may<br/>
always be a black one somewhere else.  It can&#39;t prove anything.  It can&#39;t<br/>
even make something more likely.  There is no valid way to establish that<br/>
something is even more likely based on numerous observations.<br/>
<br/>
Since induction can&#39;t happen and wouldn&#39;t work, you&#39;re probably wonder what<br/>
does work.  This is called the Problem of Induction, it&#39;s the one Popper<br/>
solved.  Here is the process that knowledge is actually created by (notice<br/>
that its evolution):<br/>
Step 1: Problem/Question<br/>
Step 2: Conjectures/Theories/Explanations.  It does not matter how you come<br/>
up with them, or who comes up with them.  The more the better.<br/>
Step 3: Criticism.  Find flaws in theories and reject those.  Any theory<br/>
with any flaw at all is wrong (although a similar theory with one change<br/>
may still be right).  This is where observations come in, as one form of<br/>
criticism.  But logic and argument are also useful criticisms.<br/>
Step 4: Alter your worldview to incorporate your new theory that survived<br/>
criticism in place of the old one.<br/>
Step 5: New Problem<br/>
<br/>
The key points are that it doesn&#39;t matter who comes up with an idea.  There<br/>
is no authority involved, and claiming &quot;my theories are right b/c of<br/>
experience in the world&quot; is obvious specious.  Authority and Experience<br/>
making someone right only makes any sense at all to inductionists.  What<br/>
makes people right is that all the rival theories fail to criticism, and<br/>
their own theory does not.<br/>
<br/>
Note theories are basically explanations.  Also that accepted theories are<br/>
not &quot;proven&quot; or even established as &quot;likely&quot; but simply the best and only<br/>
theory that makes sense.  As soon as some problem with this theory comes<br/>
up, the process starts over to discover a better one.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Induction is nothing more than coming up with a theory based on a bunch of <br/>
specifics. It is observing the world around you and noticing specific things <br/>
and putting them all together to reach some general conclusion. An example <br/>
would be that you look around and notice that those kids who learn math from <br/>
math textbooks usually don&#39;t seem to have good conceptual understanding so <br/>
you conclude that learning math from textbooks doesn&#39;t usually result in good <br/>
mathematical understanding. Your conclusion is only as good as your <br/>
observations and your ability to generalize.<br/>
<br/>
It is as opposed to deduction which is coming up with specifics based on some <br/>
generalized principle. So you already HAVE some general principle and you <br/>
hold to that and conclude things based on that. If your general principle is <br/>
that kids learn best from textbooks, then you might conclude that your kid <br/>
should use a math textbook if you want him to learn math the best way <br/>
possible. Your conclusion is only as good as your starting principle and your <br/>
ability to apply it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Apparently what Hume argued was that induction wasn&#39;t *rational* (in<br/>
philosophical terms) not that it didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
All he was saying, I beleive, is that just because the sun has risen every<br/>
day of our lives doesn&#39;t *prove* that it will rise tomorrow. That doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that we can&#39;t observe and come up with a theory that will provide us<br/>
with a fairly high sense of confidence that we would be right in assuming<br/>
the sun will rise tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
It would be impossible to function without inductive reasoning. My bed could<br/>
turn into a tiger while I sleep. The light switch could move. Electrons<br/>
could grow to large to run through the wires.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve induced from a bunch of observations that none of those will<br/>
happen. And thus I am able to sleep peacefully at night unbothered by such<br/>
irrational thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me parenting difficulties don&#39;t arise from inductive reasoning<br/>
-- which I think school tries its darnedest to train out of us: we&#39;re taught<br/>
to trust what we&#39;re told and ignore what we observe -- but from deductive<br/>
reasoning. (Thank you Pam for that succinct explanation of something I<br/>
undoubtedly learned in school but had filed away as noise with no practical<br/>
purpose.)<br/>
<br/>
The generally accepted rule is that school is where children learn best,<br/>
therefore I should send my child to school if I want her to learn best. The<br/>
generally accepted rule is that control of children prevents them from doing<br/>
bad things until they are old enough to control themselves, therefore I must<br/>
control my child if I don&#39;t want her to do bad things.<br/>
<br/>
Which is why many unschoolers ask &quot;why&quot; questions of newbies. Trying to free<br/>
them from being trapped by deductive reasoning based on false assumptions<br/>
and learn how to inductively reason again. :-)<br/>

number of logically consistent theories.  So, how does induction work?  How<br/>
do you pick which one?  In truth, you are looking at these observations for<br/>
inspiration, and seeking an *explanation* for why certain patterns may be<br/>
there.  For example you see no tigers in your bed-room over and over, and<br/>
you explain this by considering the properties of bedrooms, and the<br/>
properties of tigers, and the laws of physics.</div>

&quot;Doesn&#39;t offer proof&quot; is a mathematical assertion.  If something is &quot;not <br/>

that this is not a good source for philosophical information.<br/>

Unschoolers have been saying that since before any of them heard of TCS, so <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything you brought to bear.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why questions, it seems to me, ask for explanations.  Which is exactly what<br/>
I&#39;m suggesting.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why are you bringing TCS to this list without first reading to see what the <br/>
list is about?<br/>
<br/>
Whey are you making assertions you can&#39;t defend?<br/>

doesn&#39;t work didn&#39;t make sense. I went and found out that wasn&#39;t what Hume<br/>
meant. Now what he says makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
But that means you are not now making sense.<br/>
<br/>
I think this inductive/deductive discussion began as an explanation of why<br/>
TCSers don&#39;t use real examples and talk about their kids. I do understand<br/>
the respect aspect.<br/>
<br/>
But from my experience, hypotheticals don&#39;t generate the depth of<br/>
understanding that real examples do. Hypotheticals get &quot;what if&quot;ed to death<br/>
because anything is possible. The discussion remains on the actions and not<br/>
on the reasons for the actions. Standard parenting advice focuses on the<br/>
actions of the child and how to modify those actions. More mindful<br/>
parenting/less coercive parenting (without going to the rhetoric heavy TCS)<br/>
looks at why the child is doing something. And the why is absent from<br/>
hypothticals.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If the *only* thing you had to work with was observations of the sun<br/>
&gt; rising, you wouldn&#39;t know if it would happen the next day.  Because you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what the explanation is.  Perhaps the sun is an alien<br/>
&gt; space-craft and will leave the next day.  You don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I&#39;ve lived long enough to know that I can&#39;t develop a useful theory<br/>
on one observation, and to know that I will need a fair number of pieces of<br/>
data before a pattern emerges. I can&#39;t know anything with 100% certainty.<br/>
But I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re insisting that 100% certainty is enough. I<br/>
can&#39;t even be 100% certain my name is Joyce Fetteroll, for that matter, but<br/>
I keep on using it because it&#39;s proven it&#39;s usefulness over time.<br/>
<br/>
Unless I&#39;m a scientist needing to convince others, I can confidently accept<br/>
a theory based purely on a great deal of observation. It&#39;s nice to know the<br/>
why behind it, but it isn&#39;t necessary in order to place confidence in it and<br/>
to base daily decisions on. (Should I make contingency plans on the sun not<br/>
rising tomorrow?)<br/>
<br/>
You say:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is no way to establish liklihoods, degrees of confidence, etc<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And then you say:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, BTW, the light switch COULD move, but its extraordinarily unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Didn&#39;t you just say there&#39;s no way to establish likelihoods, degrees of<br/>
confidence, etc?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Listening to authorities *IS* inductive reasoning.  The idea of an<br/>
&gt; authority is they were smart in the past, so they will be in the future, so<br/>
&gt; they are probably right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think children accept adults as authorities because adults have<br/>
proven themselves right. I think they do so because they&#39;ve been coerced<br/>
into it. They are trained to rely on experts. They are trained to not trust<br/>
their own powers of observation and reasoning. They are trained to even<br/>
ignore conflicting data that refutes the expert&#39;s theory.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So you agree parents shouldn&#39;t try to control their children?  Great! :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe it was stated pretty clearly before the posting began that it<br/>
would be a good idea to read for a while to see what some people here<br/>
actually think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why questions, it seems to me, ask for explanations.  Which is exactly what<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m suggesting.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For any finite set of obserations, there are an infinite<br/>
&gt; number of logically consistent theories.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I ignored that before because it makes no sense. Doesn&#39;t make any more sense<br/>
on second viewing.<br/>
<br/>
I might conceded that my limited imagination will prevent me from seeing<br/>
more than one &quot;logically consistent theory&quot; that I could draw from the<br/>
pattern of sun rising each morning for years and years, but I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s my imagination limiting me from understanding how there could be an<br/>
infinite number of logically consistent theories.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if the data set were severly restricted to one or two instances, lots<br/>
more theories would be possible, but it would be rather silly to base a<br/>
theory on such limited information. So that&#39;s not making sense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, how does induction work?  How<br/>
&gt; do you pick which one?  In truth, you are looking at these observations for<br/>
&gt; inspiration, and seeking an *explanation* for why certain patterns may be<br/>
&gt; there.  For example you see no tigers in your bed-room over and over, and<br/>
&gt; you explain this by considering the properties of bedrooms, and the<br/>
&gt; properties of tigers, and the laws of physics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is seeming to be a whole lot more about the limitations of langauge&#39;s<br/>
ability to express reality than it is about how we actually deal with<br/>
reality.<br/>

What I meant was, &quot;Given our current theories of physics, the lightswitch<br/>
moving would be extraordinary unlikely.  If our current theories of physics<br/>
turn out to be wrong, then its technically possible it might not be an<br/>
unlikely event.  I cannot prove how likely it is.  But my best theories<br/>
suggest its very unlikely.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re assuming the sun goes in an elipse (we&#39;ll pretend the earth is<br/>
stationary to make discussion easier, it doesn&#39;t really make much<br/>
difference given relativity).  You&#39;re assuming the sun doesn&#39;t teleport.<br/>
You&#39;re observations don&#39;t prove this, you only believe it b/c of<br/>
explanation.  If you let it wander anywhere in the sky you&#39;ll have an<br/>
easier time coming up with theories.  A theory could be ANY function for<br/>
predicting where the sun will be that happens to work for all known data<br/>
points.  So specificy all the important ones by hand, and then your<br/>
function can do anything at all for the non-observed points.  Example<br/>
follows:<br/>
<br/>
 (t is time in minutes since whenever you wanted me to start, and the<br/>
position of the sun will be 3 numbers x/y/z)<br/>
<br/>
f(t) = 47t/ 33y/ 99z       (or ANY other numbers, hence the infinite<br/>
theories claim)<br/>
except on certain inputs do something else:<br/>
for t=2, 45/23/11 (fill in numbers from an observation)<br/>
for t=7, 12/345/33 (again use the real numbers from an observation)<br/>
(continue list for every observation on your list)<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t you ever seen a graph with open-points on a line and the data point<br/>
somewhere else?  Like  the function  x=y except if x=2, then y=44.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The point is you cannot figure out anything solely based on observations.<br/>
Nothing at all!  Not even &quot;good enough&quot; or &quot;non-absurd&quot; theories.  Only<br/>
explanations work (and the explanations DO take into account the<br/>
observations, among other things).</div>
