Even though I&#39;m new to this list (well, I was on it several years back but <br/>
was not ready for it) I still can relate to this feeling. I always know when <br/>
I&#39;m trying to &quot;teach&quot; something and so do my kids and even though they like <br/>
to tell me that they aren&#39;t  learning anything they also rebel whenever I&#39;m <br/>
trying to *teach*  them anything, LOL What a rock and a hard place.<br/>

A few weeks ago, I ordered a boxed curriculum, I don&#39;t know<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what came over me and I regretted it immediately. We got the box full of<br/>
&gt; workbooks etc at the beginning of last week. I made a little schedule and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; got started. It was terrible!! It was so boring and unnatural!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL! That sounds so familiar after hs&#39;ing my boys for 5 years. I understand<br/>
about the inviting, soothing quality of wanting a complete curriculum, out<br/>
of a box. It&#39;s all there! No muss, no fuss. No extra work, research or<br/>
planning on my part. And they make it look and sound so wonderful in the<br/>
catalog. But then, when I got it, I just thought, how could a whole years<br/>
worth of learning fit inside this box?? And then looking through the<br/>
workbooks, lesson plans, &quot;assignments&quot; and feeling the dread, &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
really want to DO this!!&quot; And realizing I just spent all that money so we<br/>
BETTER make a good effort trying to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the kids. At first they&#39;re so excited! They got this special<br/>
box in the mail, just for them. They have SCHOOLWORK to do now!! They ask me<br/>
to give them &quot;grades&quot;. They want to get started right away. I can&#39;t get the<br/>
books out fast enough. They both want my help in instructing them what to<br/>
do - I have to divide my time - they start getting frustrated. Days go by<br/>
and they don&#39;t want to do their schoolwork anymore! They just want to play.<br/>
We&#39;re maybe half way through the first one. Then I come up with a schedule<br/>
and consequences for not completing schoolwork. UGGHH!! I will NEVER forget<br/>
this. Just like you said, it was terrible, boring and unnatural. And<br/>
thousands, millions (?) of hs&#39;ing families do this every day?? I&#39;m SO glad I<br/>
found unschooling. I feel like I&#39;ve been let out of prison.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But at the<br/>
&gt; same time it was wonderful because I finally realized that the &quot;schoolish&quot;<br/>
&gt; way is the wrong way for us! The whole lot of stuff has been put up for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sale<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I can&#39;t wait until it&#39;s gone. Looking at the stacks of workbooks makes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; realize how ridiculous I have been in the search for the right way for my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fa<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mily to learn.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are so right about this. Maybe some people (like me) have to know the<br/>
bad before they seek the good. I had to experience all those horrible<br/>
homeschooling experiences to know the joys of unschooling. I still have a<br/>
lot of our old workbooks around, I&#39;m not sure why. Maybe to serve as a<br/>
reminder? &lt;g&gt; I love unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114563030">For us, those urges are getting shorter and shorter.<br/>

Me:  Or do you want to give it to yourself?<br/>
Dd:  You.<br/>

Dd:  All kinds.  Everything.  Reading, math, history, everything.<br/>

Dd:  Everything.<br/>
Me:  Which one first?<br/>
Dd:  History.  Do history first.<br/>
Me:  What about history do you want to learn?<br/>
Dd:  The war.  And famous people, like Martin Luther King.<br/>
Me:  Okay, got it.  We&#39;ll do the war and famous people first.  What kind<br/>
of homework do you want: reading, writing papers, worksheets, tests?<br/>
Dd:  All of it.<br/>
<br/>
My mind starts racing.  Which war?  And who?  I start thinking about<br/>
materials.  Less than a minute passes.<br/>

    It seems that I must learn everything the hard way,  I&#39;d have thought I <br/>
would have outgrown that by now. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m grateful that the kids are still <br/>
young enought that I don&#39;t have too much damage to undo. <br/>
