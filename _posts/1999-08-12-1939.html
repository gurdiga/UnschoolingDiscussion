OK, here is a question for all of you.  How many people really have NICE<br/>
handwriting?  How much does the quality of your handwriting really affect<br/>
your life?  When I think about all of the people whose handwriting I am<br/>
familiar with, only one brother and myself (both writers) have good<br/>
penmanship.  I think that is mostly due to our love of written language, as<br/>
well as a great deal more practice than most folks have nad (ie: writiing<br/>
letters, keeping journals, writing stories, etc..)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My handwriting is ok, generally legible, but not what I&#39;d call pretty.  I <br/>
type very quickly because I do almost all my writing at a computer.  When I <br/>
do write with a pen or pencil I almost always print.  I&#39;ve never enjoyed <br/>
writing cursive.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it would be kind of cool if I had really beautiful handwriting.  I <br/>
sometimes have fantasies about writing letters in an elegant script to my <br/>
distant friends filled with Proustian descriptions of my life and <br/>
surroundings.  And my friends would keep all these letters and someday after <br/>
my demise they would be compiled into a best-selling book and people would <br/>
say, &quot;Wow, I wish I had known her.&quot;  But even if I could write beautifully <br/>
I&#39;d probably never find the time to actually do this.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
On a more serious note, I will say that occasionally I have to grade papers <br/>
from a student with *terrible* handwriting and this drives me crazy.  That&#39;s <br/>
probably the one way that penmanship really does affect my life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112316735">I have wretched handwriting. Legible but ugly.  I am a nurse and have to chart<br/>
all the time.  It&#39;ll pass in court but win no beauty contests.  They constantly<br/>
harassed me throughout school and I think I probably rebelled against it by<br/>
&quot;trying&quot; to improve my handwriting (not) very hard.  But I am employable<br/>
nonetheless.<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s a weird little personal factoid:  When I was in school, I was taught <br/>
cursive...I did OK, had a pretty nice &quot;hand&quot; and all that.  But my writing <br/>
NOW is so totally different...kind of a mix between printing/writing...closer <br/>
to D&#39;Nealian (sp) than anything I was taught....it even slants <br/>
differently...almost backhand.  This writing didn&#39;t &quot;emerge&quot; until I got <br/>
older and grew into my real self!  Our fundraising group always has me do <br/>
signs, etc., because I &quot;have such nice handwriting&quot;!!! <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of D&#39;Nealian, when my dd was in kindergarten (the only formal IS <br/>
she&#39;s had) the teacher taught them this as a link between printing and <br/>
writing.  Her grandma had already taught her to write in cursive, and she <br/>
already knew how to print in manuscript, so this made 3 ways for this child <br/>
to write.  I then took her out of IS and began to homeschool her with the <br/>
Calvert curriculum (OK, so I didn&#39;t know better but I was just beginning, <br/>
remember?)  THEY wanted her to learn &quot;Calvert Script&quot;.  I wrote them back and <br/>
said that she already knew 3 different kinds of writing and I didn&#39;t see the <br/>
necessity for a 4th.  They then gave me the exquisite explanation of &quot;Those <br/>
are our rules and we request that she use Calvert Script when doing her work&quot; <br/>
.  That was the beginning of the end for Calvert!!!<br/>

this. (My mother told them to leave me be!). But I was contantly criticized <br/>
for smearing pencil across the paper.<br/>
  when my dd wanted to learn cursive, she insisted on a workbook, which she <br/>
did for a short while. We talked about how everyone is different and so <br/>
everyone&#39;s handwriting is different. That she would develop her own style and <br/>
that the best way to learn cursive is to write in cursive.  She and a friend <br/>
decided to write to each other (it&#39;s fun getting mail).<br/>
 Her handwriting is often clearer than mine!!  Now she&#39;s teaching herself <br/>
calligraphy. No pressure, no struggle, just living with the process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167685769">I couldn&#39;t think slow enough for my pen to keep up. I remember when I was in<br/>
the first grade, I had been placed in a special class that year. There were<br/>
too many students so they made a new class out of the sharpest tacks in the<br/>
box.  (This is back before my brain turned to mush) I remember knowing I was<br/>
bright and that expectations were high. I did really well, sometimes the<br/>
best in the class, in every subject, but one....Penmanship!!! I tried and<br/>
tried to make neat little block letters like Tina and Wayne but no matter<br/>
how hard I tried or how much time I put into it I couldn&#39;t get more than a<br/>
few neat little letters on the page before it would degenerate into crooked<br/>
curves.  I guess this is a point about penmanship and the &#39;gifted&#39; label<br/>
because not being able to write neatly like all the other little drones<br/>
really messed with me.  In the 6th grade I remember Gene and I were the very<br/>
brightest math students. We always turned our papers in first and always had<br/>
the most answers right, even the story problems (in 9th grade algebra when<br/>
the teacher would post on the board that 1 or 2 students had got a really<br/>
high score the whole class would yell Mary and/or Gene) BUT, no matter how<br/>
hard I tried, no matter how fast I went, Gene always got his done just a<br/>
hair faster and such pretty, neat little numbers and symbols! My math sheet<br/>
would always be so messy.  This was the year I discovered that even though I<br/>
was the brightest in math, English, reading, science and especially social<br/>
studies (teacher gave essay questions, my specialty) I ranked in the middle<br/>
or below on SPELLING. In the fifth grade I was also the third to the last to<br/>
memorize my times tables. By the way, I dropped out of high school in the<br/>
middle of the 10th grade because my GPA went from a 3.84 (not a 4.  I got a<br/>
B in Home Ec because I didn&#39;t want to study meat. sheesh) to a 3.31 between<br/>
the first quarter and the second because I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore.<br/>
The one way I was special, my &#39;giftedness&#39; was failing me and there was no<br/>
more reason to go to that horrid place.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion-Can you tell I am a poor speller? Have really lousy penmanship?<br/>
Would it lower your estimation of me if you could? Would I care? What really<br/>
matters anyway? That I know my times tables or that I am a kind person? That<br/>
I was a &#39;gifted&#39; student or respectful? That I can earn a scholarship or<br/>
honors or whatever or that I can tell the difference between right and<br/>
wrong, and choose right.  Parenting isn&#39;t about making sure our kids can<br/>
spell, write legibly, memorize times tables, or answer essay questions. It<br/>
is about nurturing, loving, sharing, giving, providing a safe place to<br/>
explore the world. The rest will fall into place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62680904">I feel like someone has to stand up for beautiful handwriting, so .... here<br/>
I go:-) I remember being forced to take classes to improve my handwriting<br/>
when I was around 13 years old. Don&#39;t remember my writing being that bad,<br/>
don&#39;t remember the classes, but I am forever grateful for them! <br/>
<br/>
I love handwriting for its beauty and grace. In my teens, I took up<br/>
calligraphy and was actually paid for my handwriting for wedding<br/>
invitations and turning words into works of art. These days, I use my word<br/>
processor a lot, but whenever I need to do &quot;important&quot; meaningful writing-<br/>
journalling, personal letters, information that I need to really get into<br/>
my head- nothing but pen and paper feels right and careful penmanship is<br/>
part of that process. I guess it&#39;s meditative and therapeutic for me.<br/>
<br/>
I love playing with words and handwriting is of course a major part of<br/>
that! I use my handwriting in bookmaking, in jewellery making, in my<br/>
graphics work. I love to write out recipes and poems and notes to my<br/>
children. I point out to them the beauty of the written word all the time<br/>
and I plan to introduce cursive writing to my nine-year-old this year. Part<br/>
of me believes that it IS a skill that everyone needs, because I think<br/>
we&#39;re becoming removed from the spirit and soul of writing as computers and<br/>
technology play a larger part in out lives (along with speaking clearly and<br/>
well) . Of course the computer is quicker and more legible and fixes all<br/>
your mistakes, but why are we in such a hurry all the time? <br/>

make his won games and write. Last year i tried to get some cursive stuff<br/>
for him but he didnt get into and i decided that he didnt have to learn it<br/>
at 8. so we put the books away. well today he asked for the books and said<br/>
he wanted to learn adn it is so easy now. now arguements or anger just<br/>
practicing and pride.<br/>

 OK, here is a question for all of you.  How many people really have NICE<br/>
 handwriting?  How much does the quality of your handwriting really affect<br/>

<br/>
I have really nice handwriting and enjoy using it, especially in my <br/>
scrapbooks.<br/>
I also have fast cursive/print I use a lot too!  I love to write cursive, and <br/>
I <br/>
use to love to practice my signature.  I fiddled with it for quite a few years<br/>
before I fell into a very flowery cursive style.  My first initial K is <br/>
completely<br/>
improper, but when I sign my last initial W its proper, straight from the <br/>
classroom walls.  Funny I didn&#39;t learn how to make a W that way in my early<br/>
years.  It wasn&#39;t until I was a teen playing and practicing could I learn to <br/>
do <br/>
that.  Anyhow, to make a long store end &lt;gg&gt; and to answer the original<br/>
question, no, my handwriting hasn&#39;t really affected the quality of my life <br/>
other<br/>
than to say I enjoy it, my dd likes, my dh can&#39;t read it (thats another <br/>
story!)<br/>
and I occasionally get compliments on it ; )<br/>

<br/>
I think you make a very good argument that really fine penmanship is more of <br/>
an art than a skill.  I can practice and get to be a better typist -- get <br/>
faster and more accurate and get better at this skill.  I could practice <br/>
until forever and my penmanship would not improve.  Nor do I need or want it <br/>
to.  I think it would be neat to teach kids about how pretty and fun some <br/>
penmanship can be but to require good artistic talent seems cruel to me -- <br/>
I&#39;m no artist -- my daughter is very talented (I think) -- but I hope noone <br/>
ever makes my kids feel bad that they aren&#39;t talented this way.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>
