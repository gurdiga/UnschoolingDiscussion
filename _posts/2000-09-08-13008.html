<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi All,&nbsp; I&#39;m picking up on this country 
thread...I want soo much to move farther away from the city...we were a ways 
away, until this area became the development capital.&nbsp; All 5 acre plots 
being sold out for large 224,000$ particle board houses &amp; condos..with No 
land...what a profit, but what a loss for the community..soon there will be no 
wild places for the kiddies in the area to explore in, and they will all be 
playing in the street, instead.&nbsp; I wish to have&nbsp; a little farm, out in 
the country where we can have a little peace &amp; quiet....grow our garden, and 
care for our animals.&nbsp; 3 dogs, 2 cats 2 birds, 2 fish, and a wonderful 
goat..oh yah....and 3 silkworms...one about to emmerge from his cocoon.&nbsp; I 
dislike the hustle &amp; bustle, and want my son to learn&nbsp;a quality of 
life, aside from integrating into a fast moving society.......my motto is find 
your self, your skills, your dreams&amp; passions...then offer them to the 
world.......not be given a skill ..be given the self you are expected to be, and 
then have no choice but to integrate with what you&#39;ve been given.....without 
your deepest hopes &amp; dreams, and the natural skills you&#39;ve been born with , 
and learned to fulfill them......life has little meaning, in my opinion.&nbsp; 
The world is such a backwards place.....be like everyone else.....seems the 
goal.....despite their best efforts to say you are all unique..but fullfilling 
those unique personality fluxes........is not their job....and alot of things 
fall under, well that&#39;s not my job......if we could all just do the job that 
comes naturally to us using the skills we are best at....we would all find the 
perfect place.&nbsp; It&#39;s a shame all this brainwashing, stripping of spirit, 
and seperation of family, manipulation.&nbsp; I hear this lady last night on 
Oprah...they were covering the topic of letting go of your children when they go 
off to college...how important it was to let go, so you could be your own 
individual person, how healthy it was for you to do so....how your relationship 
SHOULD change so they can go off into the world, and you should do some 
volunteer work to cope with it.....Now I&#39;m not saying some of what she said 
wasn&#39;t true.....but the part of reinventing yourslef...find something else to 
do...you&#39;ve moved beyond being a Mother get a new carreer stuff, was 
insulting.&nbsp; Being a Mother is something you never really stop doing, once 
it is a part of who you are.&nbsp; And the natural transition from Mother used 
to be to GRandMother.....I heard no mention of this....just a start all over 
again attitude.....ofcourse ineviteably kids grow up, and often find doing there 
own thing is somewhere other than , where you are at, but not all the time, and 
that doesn&#39;t change the strength or end the need for a MOther.&nbsp; I know 
this.....the norm of this society to seperate from their families so readily, is 
absurd to me..there is nothing more warming than the home of close family..and 
it is NOT natural to seperate to such degrees, in my opinion.&nbsp; I think it 
had alot to do with the Tough Love era....where you abandon the one that causes 
you stress.....this is now accepteable.&nbsp; (just when they need you 
most)&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had my Mother since I was 15..when I was married for the 
first time...it was if this is your choice get out, and stay out....and that&#39;s 
the way it was.....my relationship with my parents because of extreme distance, 
and long periods of non communication.....has all but shriveled away.....I have 
tried to express my desire to rekindle some type of relationship, but them being 
in Florida, and me being in Washington...conveniently keeps us apart.&nbsp; We 
speak once about every six months..how&#39;s the weather stuff.......and send gifts 
on holidays..but who told these people that once someone leaves their 
home...they no longer need the relationship , care &amp; love of a , and 
communication with their Mother &amp; Father.&nbsp; I do alot of things 
differently than they did...for many reasons....I still respect &amp; Love them 
deeply......the world seems so Backwards to me....priorities are 
jumbled......often we feel we are the only ones who see it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But you 
know what ...that&#39;s ok..we&#39;ll teach our children to see it, and do what we feel 
is healthiest, happiest, and mose fulfilling for us, and not give a damn what 
the rest of the world thinks.&nbsp; The best way to teach someone is by action, 
and dedication, and from leanring from your mistakes..or in&nbsp;some cases the 
mistakes  of others.</font></div>
