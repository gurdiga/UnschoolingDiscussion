<div id="ygrps-yiv-510202332">Perhaps your friend meant egalitarian society?<br/>
Egalitarian:  Advocating the doctrine of equal political, economic, and legal <br/>
rights for all citizens.<br/>
 Your friend forgets that many societies, including ours, mainly homeschooled <br/>
in previous times.  It didn&#39;t lead to an egalitarian society.<br/>
We still had politicians, grocers, bookstores etc....<br/>
Funny thing how people have forgotten that. Some of the greatest inventors,  <br/>
philosophers and politicians in history were self taught.<br/>
Her theory doesn&#39;t hold water....besides, everyone is not going to suddenly <br/>
homeschool tomorrow, so it&#39;s hardly a solid reason why people shouldn&#39;t <br/>
consider homeschooling. Is that her arguement against homeschooling? Not much <br/>
of a leg to stand on if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
The Smithsonisn is free? Wow, you learn something new every day....we&#39;ve been <br/>
wanting to visit that area of the country for a long time now.  Maybe this <br/>
fall.<br/>
