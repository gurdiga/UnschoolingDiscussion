&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I agree. And so has (does) my state, CT, big. We read about abuse, injuries,<br/>
&gt;&gt; neglect, yes - killing,  almost every week, and this, even though we know<br/>
&gt;&gt; that the agencies, just like the schools, do whatever they can to hide their<br/>
&gt;&gt; dysfunctions. No one is punished, no one is blamed. Why? It&#39;s the state.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Private agencies are closed when they do the same things. Charges are filed.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Homeschool those kids.  Keep them healthy, safe. Nobody else will.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the parents are abusing and neglectful, why on earth would homeschooling<br/>
&gt; keep them safe? I would think that in this situation, school would keep them<br/>
&gt; safe. School certainly kept me safe. But what do I know?<br/>

The subject was, as I remember, state child/family agencies that abuse,<br/>
neglect, and even kill children, and then change their names to help the<br/>
public forget which agencies were responsible, and so the state will<br/>
continue to fund them.<br/>
<br/>
The connection I was making was that both the social agencies and the<br/>
schools try to hide their cruelties.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t disagree that some schools are safer than some homes. That sad fact,<br/>
however, doesn&#39;t give the state the right to take all children from their<br/>
parents and put them in schools, as much as some people would like to see<br/>
that.<br/>
