<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108702570"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; And there are millions of people who claim to believe and follow every word<br/>
&gt; of the Bible as the literal word of God without having even read it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now that&#39;s the one I don&#39;t get.  I could never tell people I believe every<br/>
word of the Bible is the literal word of God.  I have read well over half<br/>
the books.  But there are several books I have doubts I&#39;ll ever get through.<br/>
<br/>
With all the great literature in the world, and all the great religious<br/>
writings both in and out of the Bible, why would I want to slog through some<br/>
piece of it I don&#39;t enjoy?  And how could I ever claim to believing<br/>
something I can&#39;t tolerate reading?!?!<br/>

your classic example of a good episcopalian, aka bad christian to some!  &lt;g&gt;</div>
