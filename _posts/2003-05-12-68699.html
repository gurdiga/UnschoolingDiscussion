sun school teacher asked &quot;Is Jesus more like Mr. Rogers or <br/>
<br/>
Braveheart?&quot; and they came to the conclusion that He is like both. <br/>

But the question was about this stereotype we have of what Mr. Rogers <br/>
<br/>
is like. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What age Sunday School class is this that the teacher is expecting the kids <br/>
to all have seen Braveheart!?  SHEESH!!!   Sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m the &quot;Let them watch R!&quot; advocate, and I think Braveheart is pretty <br/>
much too rough for lots of kids.<br/>

often just her and her teacher (Tiny Church). She hasn&#39;t seen <br/>
Braveheart, but I think she and her Sun school teacher have talked <br/>
about William Wallace some. They&#39;ve become friends over the past <br/>
couple of years. I&#39;m glad Abbie has her. <br/>
