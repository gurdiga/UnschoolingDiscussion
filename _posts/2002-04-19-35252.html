&lt;&lt; people are telling me I need to take him to a pediatrician and get him <br/>
 &quot;diagnosed&quot; because he may have some sort of problem. I just don&#39;t feel that <br/>
 he could possibly be any of these things (hyperactive, add, whatever) <br/>
 because he has a very long attention span for something he is interested in, <br/>
 very very long. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, first of all I would listen very carefully to my inner voice and my <br/>
knowledge of that child, NOT what other people think I should do.<br/>
But you probably already feel that in your heart and are just needing <br/>
reassurance.<br/>
What you said about the ADD label is innacurate...he probably would be <br/>
diagnosed with it. Because I&#39;ve seen &quot;severe ADD&quot; kids focus intently on <br/>
things they are interested in for hours. Interest will focus a person.<br/>
ADD is not a disability unless you&#39;re in school and a teacher needs you to <br/>
conform.<br/>
Outside of school it is a useless label. By following your child&#39;s lead, by <br/>
trusting them to develop, you are doing exactly what he needs.<br/>
What would a diagnoses do in this case? Would it change what you were doing? <br/>
Would it help you understand him better and suit situations to him better?<br/>
If not, then what is the purpose of a diagnoses.<br/>
There are reasons to get diagnoses of certain problems. I would hate to see <br/>
depression go undiagnosed in certain individuals. Or Autism..<br/>
But ADD only exists in schools.<br/>
Outside of school I think one could consider it a different learning style <br/>
(isn&#39;t it interesting how unique we all are?).<br/>
And as to the social skills that may be lacking....<br/>
I have a dd with none of the other symptoms you mentioned that will not <br/>
acknowledge or look at people most of the time. She does not like talking to <br/>
strangers....never has.<br/>
But she&#39;s a chatter box once she&#39;s comfortable with a person, which can take <br/>
a while.<br/>
If she hasn&#39;t seen a relative for a while they get the same cold treatment.<br/>
I have no doubt that this is a stage, that I will have a very socially <br/>
skilled young lady one day.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but I truly believe that as I&#39;ve seen an extremely shy son <br/>
open up in amazing ways in the last year or two.<br/>
I say trust him...if he&#39;s happy, your immediate family is happy, that&#39;s <br/>
important.<br/>
The outside relatives want the diagnoses it sounds like. I personally would <br/>
give it time and maybe in a couple years some of their fears will be allayed <br/>
somewhat.<br/>
