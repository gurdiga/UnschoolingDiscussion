<div id="ygrps-yiv-479608842">My dh &quot;happened&quot; into the computer field after a mere 2 weeks of college<br/>
& has never regretted going &quot;career over college&quot;. He still laughs at<br/>
some of the things they teach at college-much of it has nothing to do<br/>
with the real computer business of today (and he should know-we are<br/>
raising a family of 5 on his almost 22 yr old business-and I&#39;m a sahm).<br/>
My oldest son, now 17, has been considering the possibilities of college<br/>
but hates the thought of &quot;wasting so much time and money&quot; (his words).<br/>
He has taught himself quite a bit of computer expertise (works part time<br/>
with &quot;Dad&quot;) and also has quite a talent with animals (has his own little<br/>
herd of miniature horses, in addition to odds and ends of others).  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure what he&#39;ll end up choosing (I would guess probably a mix of<br/>
computers and animals, but he&#39;s only 17, so ???) but I know he&#39;ll choose<br/>
based on what he likes and is good at.  When he was about 12-13, he went<br/>
through the &quot;I think I&#39;ll be a chef&quot; phase-that was a wonderful time<br/>
around here as he tried new recipes, invented many of his own.I ended up<br/>
gaining a bit of weight, but he has cooking skills that will last<br/>
forever! (Yum, Yum!!)<br/>

I do know that in some technical fields they are wanting kids to do<br/>
co-op<br/>
programs (half school, half work) so that they don&#39;t get behind in the<br/>
field<br/>
while studying out of date information at the college.<br/>
<br/>
Great thread. I feel my mind and ideas have leapt forward from fear.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
