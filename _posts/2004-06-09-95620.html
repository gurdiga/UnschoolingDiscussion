&quot;We&#39;re from San Diego, in Michigan right now, and plan to move back<br/>
asap...but both of my kids HATE socks and shoes, not a biggie in SoCal, but<br/>
in MI in the winter a must.<br/>
<br/>
. I don&#39;t stress them, I figure it&#39;s one less thing to buy and wash. :)&quot;<br/>

I love your by-line, and so apropos to the subject!  My husband definitely<br/>
has a problem seeing my son so casual - but we&#39;ve talked about it, and he&#39;s<br/>
starting to understand that his son is not being disrespectful; he is truly<br/>
uncomfortable in a lot of clothing.  At our Friday family dinner he wears a<br/>
button-down short sleeved shirt (he prefers those to tees), because he knows<br/>
it pleases his Dad and all the grandparents.  I never realized before I had<br/>
children that personal preferences (especially in children) can really bug<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought it was a bit odd that he took out shoe laces, never wore<br/>
socks with any closed shoe or roller-skate, and was very aware about his<br/>
comfort level in his clothes.  But, hey, it&#39;s his body.  The only way it<br/>
affects me is that I take him shopping with me because it wouldn&#39;t work out<br/>
if I saw an article of clothing and just bought it for him. (I buy clothes<br/>
for his sister without her because she finds the whole shopping experience<br/>
too much - the stores and decisions overwhelming.  She likes the idea of<br/>
getting presents - even if it is only socks!).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how my son would react to a cold climate where he would have to<br/>
wear more clothing.  My kids have never been to the snow, and I&#39;ve only been<br/>
in it twice in my life.  That might be a fun thing for us to do this winter<br/>
- experience snow!        <br/>
