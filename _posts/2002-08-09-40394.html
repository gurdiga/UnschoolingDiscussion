&lt;&lt; Does anyone have<br/>
ideas on easy readers that are a little more interesting for tweens? (That<br/>
would inolve babysitting, horses or Mary Kate and Ashley? LOL ) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They do exist.  Check remedial reading supply sites.<br/>
<br/>
When I taught remedial reading one sad year long, long ago, we had a series <br/>
of paperback books at second grade level (a formula involving sentence length <br/>
and average word length), high school interest level.  They were good books!  <br/>
Science fiction, cars, danger, adventure, plane crashes.  They would still <br/>
take a week to read, so the kids didn&#39;t have the impression of them being <br/>
easy, and the stories were not shallow as to character, theme and all that <br/>
good analytical stuff.  I would read them aloud sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
One involved an emergency situation with a tourniquet.  Two non-reading 13 <br/>
year olds ditched school one day, played in an abandoned house, and one got <br/>
badly punctured with window class still in the frame.   The other took his <br/>
shirt off, put pressure on the wound with part of it and made a tourniquet <br/>
with the other half, and they walked until they got a ride to the hospital, <br/>
just a few blocks from there.  <br/>
<br/>
The principal was really angry they&#39;d been ditching.  I was always really <br/>
proud that they&#39;d used something they&#39;d learned in a remedial reading class <br/>
in a real-life situation, which I thought beat the heck out of being in <br/>
school that afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look and see if those books or their successors are still around.<br/>
