<br/>
&quot;The problem with home schooling is you can either get an incredible <br/>
education or you can get no education at all,&quot; he says. &quot;I do know of <br/>
families in Montana whose kids reach high school age and they don&#39;t <br/>
know how to do basic math and have no background in literature, <br/>
because the parents were doing canning and the parents said the kids <br/>
were learning counting from canning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unlike &quot;unschoolers,&quot; Paolini says he and his younger sister followed <br/>
a fairly regimented curriculum devised by their mother, a trained <br/>
Montessori teacher. They used home-education materials made by the A <br/>
Beka Academy in Pensacola, Fla.<br/>
<br/>
Paolini&#39;s mother guided them until they reached high school age, when <br/>
they enrolled in an accredited online distance-learning program <br/>
called The American School.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We put ourselves through high school, essentially,&quot; he says. &quot;That <br/>
was one of the most valuable lessons - learning how to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Paolini says sometimes having his mom as his teacher made the mother-<br/>
son dynamic more intense, but they managed. It might have been nice <br/>
to grow up around more kids, but he&#39;s meeting plenty now on the <br/>
lecture circuit.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been in more schools with this book than I would have going to <br/>
regular schools,&quot; he says with a grin. &quot;It&#39;s retribution, I guess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Home schooling gave him wide latitude to pursue his own interests in <br/>
music, writing and computer games. He does not believe, however, that <br/>
children should be totally free to decide what they study.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If it was up to kids, half the time you know you wouldn&#39;t be allowed <br/>
to teach them anything,&quot; he explains. &quot;They don&#39;t understand how <br/>
useful it&#39;s going to be later in life or how much they&#39;ll end up <br/>
enjoying it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any personal examples?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think either that you&#39;re paranoid or that he has a hidden <br/>
agenda (although the newspaper reporter might have one).  The kid -- <br/>
in all his wisdom -- has a very out-in-the-open agenda, it seems to <br/>
me.  He obviously has negative feelings about unschoolers.  I wonder <br/>
why it&#39;s such an issue that it should dominate this article this <br/>
way?  Did the reporter emphasize it, I wonder?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
They&#39;ve done studies on how homeschoolers do compared to public <br/>

terrible next to schoolers- well, all but one of them.  They are <br/>
learning different things in a different way and it cannot be measure <br/>
in any traditional sense if at all.  There learning to think not what <br/>
to think. <br/>
<br/>
You know Justin, my 18 yo.  If he had been tested at the age of 12, <br/>
he would have been off the lower end of the charts.  Had they tested <br/>
him, I&#39;m sure they have decided he was dyslexic, dysgraphic, ADD and <br/>
who knows what else.  Think of what Gale Fallon said about him.  But <br/>
look at him now.  He&#39;s been successful in college and the work <br/>
place.  He has a physical intelligence with his juggling, clowning, <br/>
dancing and acting.  People love him; he&#39;s a great converstaionalist <br/>
and has  a wonderful sense of humor.  None of that would ever have <br/>
been tested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824273666">Yeah,  I was going to post this yesterday.  I saw it too,  from HEM homeschoolers in the news.<br/>
<br/>
I just finished reading the book last week.  Pretty good,  I mean I read the whole thing in a few days, and its practically 500 pages!  So something held my interest.  It did bug me though that he borrows quite heavily from Tolkein.<br/>
<br/>
He has a new language going, maps, dwarves, elves, certain grotesque creatures chasing them.  He even has a wise old man who says some things that were darn exact to Gandalf&#39;s.   I guess he has a right to use these characters just like Tolkein did, but it just felt sooo similar.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as his comments,  sounds like his mother or who ever has really sold him on the idea that a required type of &#39;education&#39; is what is needed in childhood.     <br/>
<br/>
Obviously he doesn&#39;t have a clue about unschooling and the complexities it involves.  I&#39;m wondering if he really ever met an unschooled family?   Sounds like he was heavily controlled,    <br/>
<br/>
How about this statement:   &quot;Paolini says sometimes having his mom as his teacher made the mother-<br/>
son dynamic more intense, but they managed. It might have been nice <br/>
to grow up around more kids, but he&#39;s meeting plenty now on the <br/>
lecture circuit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t sound so great to me,  sounds like their relationship was strained and that he was sheltered.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, he&#39;s not an unschooler.  :(    I was hoping too,  when I heard he was homeschooled, but when it said he had finished high school at 15 I guessed that he wasn&#39;t.  Too much school lingo. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Meet the 21st-century Tolkien<br/>
(Filed: 22/12/2003) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 20, he has never been to school, he lives with his parents in a <br/>
remote community in Montana  and his debut novel is outselling Harry <br/>
Potter. How did Christopher Paolini do it? It was a family affair, <br/>
Michael Shelden discovers <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For a young man of 20, Christopher Paolini has lived a rather <br/>
sheltered life. He has never been to school, never held a regular job <br/>
and still lives in the old farmhouse along the banks of Montana&#39;s <br/>
Yellowstone River, where he grew up. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Magical tales: Christopher Paolini <br/>
<br/>
When he is not busy constructing a hobbit hut with an 8ft tunnel near <br/>
the river, he spends much of his time happily lost in a fantasy world <br/>
of his own creation - a place he calls Alagaesia, where dragons roam <br/>
and battles rage among sword-wielding tribes.<br/>
<br/>
This time last year, he was just another geeky teen with too much <br/>
time on his hands. But now, thanks to Eragon, his 500-page rousing <br/>
adventure story set in his imaginary world, young Christopher is <br/>
suddenly rich. <br/>
<br/>
The British edition appears early next month, but already it is a <br/>
huge bestseller in America, where it has surged past the Harry Potter <br/>
books. Almost half a million copies were sold in only two months, a <br/>
screenplay is in the works and at least a dozen foreign-language <br/>
editions are on the way.<br/>
<br/>
So how is the new millionaire spending his fortune? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, my dad bought a new computer, and we got this really cool <br/>
plasma-screen TV. The picture is so good, we don&#39;t go to the movies <br/>
any more. We just stay home and watch DVDs.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He has also been ordering a lot of tapes to listen to around the <br/>
house. Lately, his favourite is The History of Science Since the <br/>
1700s.<br/>
<br/>
Home is a cramped living room with an old sofa and a wood-burning <br/>
stove, a kitchen with a bare linoleum floor, a dark study and a few <br/>
bedrooms. A cardboard box holds a load of logs for the fire, a <br/>
welcome feature, since it&#39;s freezing outside and the wind is howling.<br/>
<br/>
When I suggest that a new house, or simply a family holiday, might be <br/>
in order, the entire Paolini clan - father Kenneth, mother Talita and <br/>
sister Angela, 18 - stare at me as though I wanted them to move to <br/>
Las Vegas and take to drink.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re not like other people,&quot; Angela says, with a gleeful smile. &quot;We <br/>
know we&#39;re weird, and that&#39;s fine.&quot; Her dad nods, but is more <br/>
temperate in his view of the family. &quot;Let&#39;s just say we&#39;re a little <br/>
eccentric.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
For years, Kenneth and Talita - former members of a survivalist cult <br/>
led by a woman called Ma Prophet - seem to have lived on a <br/>
shoestring, with only occasional employment. Kenneth, the son of an <br/>
Italian immigrant, used to be a photographer, but doesn&#39;t appear to <br/>
have had much work lately.<br/>
<br/>
He and his wife have devoted their lives to their children, schooling <br/>
them at home and, until recently, rarely venturing outside their <br/>
small community of Paradise Valley, Montana. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We like being together,&quot; Christopher says. &quot;If Nasa is looking for a <br/>
team of four people who can spend years with each other on a trip to <br/>
Mars, we&#39;re it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Which explains why you don&#39;t go to the Paolini house and just <br/>
interview Christopher. The whole family gathers round the kitchen <br/>
table and speaks in turn, answering my questions, correcting each <br/>
other and asking questions of their own. Eragon - and the other two <br/>
books in the Inheritance trilogy that will follow it - is a family <br/>
business. <br/>
<br/>
But it didn&#39;t start out that way. At first, there was just a lonely <br/>
boy with a vivid imagination. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;You see what it&#39;s like here,&quot; Christopher says, pointing to the <br/>
rugged landscape outside, with its looming mountain peaks and snow <br/>
swirling over the river valley. &quot;You have to do something to <br/>
entertain yourself and keep busy. So I thought it would be kinda neat <br/>
to write a story.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Inspiration came from long, intense days and nights of solitary <br/>
reading - everything from Beowulf to Tolkien - and close observation <br/>
of the world around him. His mountains and valleys were transformed <br/>
into a mythical land full of strange characters who seem like <br/>
refugees from The Lord of the Rings. His hero discovers a dragon&#39;s <br/>
egg, then makes a best friend of the newborn creature. <br/>
<br/>
Giggling like a little boy, Christopher says: &quot;Dragons make perfect <br/>
friends. They can eat anyone you don&#39;t like.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Yes, well, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s useful, but how did he manage to create <br/>
500 pages of this fantasy in so remote a part of America that even <br/>
his parents call it the &quot;middle of nowhere&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was only 15 when I started Eragon. I didn&#39;t know how to write. I <br/>
just told everything in one gigantic burst, then spent another year <br/>
revising it. My parents read it and thought it was great. But I <br/>
didn&#39;t really trust their opinion. After all, they&#39;re my parents. I <br/>
wasn&#39;t surprised they liked it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His mother points to the faded sofa in the living room. &quot;He wrote the <br/>
book sitting right there,&quot; she notes, with a grin of satisfaction. <br/>
She encouraged him all the way, but her husband was less enthusiastic <br/>
until he saw the finished product.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My dad&#39;s not a big fan of fantasy books,&quot; Christopher explains. <br/>
<br/>
However, Kenneth saw its potential. It&#39;s an understatement to say he <br/>
liked it: he and his wife were so smitten by the rough manuscript <br/>
that they decided to publish the book themselves in paperback and <br/>
sell it online and in local bookshops.<br/>
<br/>
Kenneth typeset it on his computer, his wife and daughter did the <br/>
proof-reading and Christopher designed the cover. With the last of <br/>
the family&#39;s savings, they paid a printer to produce a few thousand <br/>
copies and went out into the world to hawk them. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;People told us we were nuts to do this,&quot; says Kenneth with a <br/>
shrug, &quot;So what else is new?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Christopher donned a home-made costume that was supposed to make him <br/>
look like a Renaissance storyteller and went to school libraries to <br/>
promote his book. Didn&#39;t he feel self-conscious? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not a bit. It attracted a lot of attention and people wanted to know <br/>
more about the book. They would buy copies and I would sign them with <br/>
my tag line, &#39;May your swords stay sharp&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To everyone&#39;s amazement, the book was a huge hit, but the self-<br/>
publishing business was onerous and unpredictable. &quot;Our house was <br/>
filled with copies of Eragon,&quot; says Angela. &quot;They were stacked <br/>
everywhere. We couldn&#39;t handle the demand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But when things didn&#39;t go well,&quot; her father interjects, &quot;it was <br/>
tough. For a while, money was so tight that if we didn&#39;t sell books, <br/>
we didn&#39;t eat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Their big break came when the popular crime novelist Carl Hiaasen <br/>
visited the area on a fishing trip with his young son, and the boy <br/>
became immersed in a copy of Eragon. On the way home, Hiaasen asked <br/>
his son why he couldn&#39;t put the book down. &quot;It&#39;s great, Dad,&quot; came <br/>
the reply, &quot;better than Harry Potter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To a novelist who has had his fair share of bestsellers, those words <br/>
were magic. Hiaasen alerted his editors in New York, and the next <br/>
thing the Paolinis knew, the prestigious publisher Knopf (a part of <br/>
Random House) was offering them a contract. <br/>
<br/>
Christopher excitedly recalls the day when he heard the good news. He <br/>
is unreservedly grateful and is particularly impressed that Hiaasen <br/>
has never claimed any credit for himself. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We didn&#39;t even know what he had done until a few weeks ago. But he <br/>
changed our lives for ever. It made all the difference to get the <br/>
support of someone like that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His father greeted the news of Knopf&#39;s interest with caution and <br/>
decided to drive a hard bargain. He hired a powerful New York agent <br/>
to do the deal. In the end, they secured a considerable advance from <br/>
the publisher.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We may live out in the middle of nowhere,&quot; Kenneth says, with a sly <br/>
grin, &quot;but we didn&#39;t fall off the turnip truck yesterday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The former survivalists proved more than a match for the city folk, <br/>
and now have so much money that they can&#39;t seem to bear the thought <br/>
of parting with it. One reason is that, having been poor for so long, <br/>
they seem more comfortable saving than spending.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s our main stream of income,&quot; young Angela says, then adds with <br/>
the prudence of a country banker. &quot;We have to be careful how we spend <br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her mother adds a bleaker note: &quot;About money, we have an acute <br/>
understanding of the lack thereof.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A small woman with an air of quiet determination, Talita says that <br/>
she regards her son&#39;s book as a natural extension of his home <br/>
schooling. She always wanted her family to be close and began by <br/>
insisting that she give birth at home. <br/>
<br/>
When the children reached school age, she didn&#39;t want outsiders <br/>
interfering with their lives. Now she can be proud that the education <br/>
she gave them has resulted in one becoming successful enough to keep <br/>
them all together.<br/>
<br/>
And Angela may be next. She&#39;s writing her own fantasy novel and her <br/>
brother seems to think it will sell.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, brother and sister often share their creative plans and are <br/>
so close that they tend to finish each other&#39;s sentences. Dark-<br/>
haired, bespectacled and clad all in dark clothing, they could be <br/>
twins.<br/>
<br/>
They seem confident of their future, if not yet of their finances. <br/>
They will continue living and working at home, churning out their <br/>
respective epics and relaxing in front of the plasma-screen <br/>
television at the end of a hard day&#39;s writing. <br/>
<br/>
For the time being, the family is willing to let the occasional <br/>
stranger enter their haven and ask a few questions. But the curtain <br/>
of their privacy will soon be drawn across again. They have already <br/>
disconnected their old telephone and put in a private line. Soon, it <br/>
will be the dead of winter in the mountains, and they will be snug in <br/>
their hideaway, using email as their main contact with the outside <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are highly private people,&quot; they assure me, before I go.<br/>
<br/>
From his study, where he is checking sales figures on his computer, I <br/>
hear Kenneth shout out the latest numbers to his family: &quot;543,308 <br/>
copies sold,&quot; he announces triumphantly.<br/>

For Home-Schooled Teen, Novel&#39;s Success No Fantasy<br/>
By Leslie Brody<br/>
The Record (Bergen County, N.J.)<br/>
Wednesday, December 31, 2003; Page C03<br/>
<br/>
HACKENSACK, N.J. -- The latest Wunderkind of home-schooling, <br/>
Christopher<br/>
Paolini, grew up by a river in rural Montana and wrote the hit <br/>
fantasy novel<br/>
&quot;Eragon&quot; when he was 15.<br/>
<br/>
In October, soon after Alfred A. Knopf published the magical <br/>
thriller, it jumped<br/>
to No. 3 on the New York Times bestseller list for hardcover <br/>
children&#39;s chapter<br/>
books. This month it hit No. 2, outstripping four of the five Harry <br/>
Potters.<br/>
<br/>
Paolini, now a lanky and poised 19-year-old with a fresh-scrubbed <br/>
face, is<br/>
clearly ecstatic. He reportedly sold the 528-page &quot;Eragon&quot; for a <br/>
price in the<br/>
mid-six figures, and he&#39;s under contract to write two sequels for his<br/>
&quot;Inheritance&quot; trilogy.<br/>
<br/>
Although he has been accepted at Reed College in Oregon, he&#39;s not <br/>
sure he&#39;ll go.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m getting paid to do what I love, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve stopped <br/>
learning,&quot;<br/>
Paolini said at a recent book-signing. After all, before his book <br/>
tour, he<br/>
listened to a taped college course on Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity <br/>
and modern<br/>
quantum physics. He insists &quot;it was lots of fun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Paolini says he&#39;s glad he was home-schooled because it gave him the <br/>
time to<br/>
write &quot;Eragon.&quot; But he believes the success of home-schooling is <br/>
totally<br/>
dependent on the parents&#39; thoughtful involvement.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The problem with home-schooling is you can either get an incredible <br/>
education<br/>
or you can get no education at all,&quot; he says. &quot;I do know of families <br/>
in Montana<br/>
whose kids reach high school age and they don&#39;t know how to do basic <br/>
math and<br/>
have no background in literature because the parents were doing <br/>
canning and the<br/>
parents said the kids were learning counting from canning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unlike &quot;unschoolers,&quot; Paolini says, he and his younger sister <br/>
followed a fairly<br/>
regimented curriculum devised by their mother, a Montessori teacher. <br/>
They used<br/>
home-education materials by the A Beka Academy in Pensacola, Fla.<br/>
<br/>
Paolini&#39;s mother guided them until they reached high school age, when <br/>
they<br/>
enrolled in an accredited online distance-learning program called the <br/>
American<br/>
School.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We put ourselves through high school, essentially,&quot; he says. &quot;That <br/>
was one of<br/>
the most valuable lessons -- learning how to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Home-schooling gave him wide latitude to pursue his interests in <br/>
music, writing<br/>
and computer games. He does not believe, however, that children <br/>
should be<br/>
totally free to decide what they study.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If it was up to kids, half the time you know you wouldn&#39;t be allowed <br/>
to teach<br/>
them anything,&quot; he says. &quot;They don&#39;t understand how useful it&#39;s going <br/>
to be<br/>
later in life or how much they&#39;ll end up enjoying it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any personal examples?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I remember marching up to my mom and saying, &#39;I hate reading.&#39;&quot;<br/>

They can&#39;t test unschoolers without screwing up everything.<br/>
If we start teaching to their test, we lose our magic.<br/>

But someday when a bunch of unschoolers are grown, they can interview them <br/>
and quantify them and most people will look at the statistics instead of the <br/>
