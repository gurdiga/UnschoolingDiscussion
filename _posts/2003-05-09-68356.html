(mostly homework), but in Kindergarten and first grade he was pretty happy. <br/>
<br/>
In Kindergarten he had this teacher named Claire (I always thought it was a <br/>
good sign when the teachers invited parents to call them by their first <br/>
names....I wish it applied to the kids too, but I don&#39;t think they were <br/>
allowed to.), who was always very careful about how every aspect of the class <br/>
went, paying close attention to each child. It was remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
In first grade he had Jane, who was even more in tune with the kids. She <br/>
would greet each one every morning and say goodbye with a hug, call them <br/>
darlings, remember to ask each kid every day something about home that she <br/>
remembered....and none of it was in a gushy sick-sweet way. She just loved <br/>
them. (One of the interesting things we noticed about this class is that the <br/>
children were remarkably kind to one another. Apparently if it&#39;s clear that <br/>
the teacher really believes you&#39;re all special and valuable, the other kids <br/>
do, too.)<br/>
<br/>
When he got to second grade, he had a perfectly okay person as a <br/>
teacher...but from the very first, it was clear that she was just his <br/>
teacher; she didn&#39;t LOVE him. That was hard for Julian (and us). By third <br/>
grade, he had a couple of teachers who were new, and some of the time I <br/>
wasn&#39;t even sure they LIKED him.  And that was the end of that. <br/>
<br/>
I wish all kids who need to be in school for whatever reason got to have <br/>
people like Claire and Jane. <br/>
