  We were just having a Franco-American (or was it Chef Boyardee, or however<br/>
  you spell that) conversation the other day when we went grocery shopping.<br/>
  Is anyone else OAD and remember the spaghetti dinners in a box.  Supposedly<br/>
  (heavy on the supposedly) would feed a family of four--little bunch of<br/>
  spaghetti, little can of sauce and little can of cheese that looked like<br/>
  soap powder.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember it well!!  My mom would make it w/little tiny rubber-y meatballs and serve it in a stoneware covered dish that sat in an iron stand over a little can of sterno!!<br/>
When she died, and my dad moved, I got the dish.    And the little can of &quot;cheese product&quot;--probably tasted as much like soap as it looked!!!<br/>
