Helping Roya now helps a grown unschooler who&#39;s working on a master&#39;s degree.<br/>
<br/>
When she writes up her results, it could help homeschoolers interface with therapists from then on. <br/>
<br/>
This is worth doing, if you&#39;re willing to help.<br/>

Dear Homeschooler,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Roya Dedeaux. I am currently working on my Master�s degree in Counseling at California State University, Long Beach to meet my goal of becoming a Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT). I was homeschooled from the age of ten, when my mother removed me from the public school system. From that time, I have been interested in how our alternative education has impacted us as a culture.<br/>
<br/>
As I began my studies in the Counseling field, I became more and more aware of how many therapists are unaware of the diversity that the homeschooling population includes. I also heard many anecdotal stories of homeschoolers who felt they could not go to therapy because they were afraid that the therapist would not understand their lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to use my current studies to benefit the homeschooling culture that I grew up with. The purpose of my study is to measure adult homeschooler�s mental health needs, and their attitude towards seeking therapy. The results of my thesis will hopefully be used to benefit the homeschooling population by providing much needed information to the mental health profession. If there are any significant barriers for homeschoolers to seek therapy, this survey will isolate those as well.<br/>
<br/>
I found your homeschooling organization�s email address from an online search. To qualify to take this survey, you need to be over the age of 18. Additionally, you need to have EITHER been homeschooled yourself, OR homeschooled your own children. Any types of homeschooling methods, religious affiliations, or mental health needs are welcome. It should take approximately 25 minutes, is completely anonymous, and at the end you are qualified to win one of 2 $50.00 electronic gift certificates to Amazon.com!<br/>
<br/>
            Please feel free to pass this survey along to any other adult homeschoolers you know. I have two goals: 1st, to get 1000 responses, and 2nd, to get responses from every state!<br/>
<br/>
            Thank you in advance for your help and support of a fellow homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
