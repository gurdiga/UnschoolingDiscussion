&lt;&lt; My point was the same people saying the same things about the same 1 line. <br/>
 Everyone saying that correcting IMs is not unschooling spelling.  I think <br/>
that was said so many times it was just getting old.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh... and one more thing about repetition.  Sometimes the quicker to respond <br/>
get jumped on personally and individually, and others shy away from saying <br/>
&quot;Well I would have written the same thing.&quot;  So sometimes for me it&#39;s a <br/>
relief for five others to say the same thing.  It keeps people from attacking <br/>
me (or any one of them) just for being the first and maybe only.<br/>
