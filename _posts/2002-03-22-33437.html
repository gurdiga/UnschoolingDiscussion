 Since they&#39;re free to come and go, why is there a problem with letting them <br/>
 know there are other lists and giving them the descriptions and addresses <br/>
 from yahoo?   If a person says &quot;this list sucks&quot; why should the answer be <br/>
&quot;We <br/>
 will all change to suit you&quot; instead of &quot;There are other lists which might <br/>
 not suck for you!&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Because that is not the way it was presented (at least in my recollection, <br/>
which I admit could be fuzzy with so many emails). I have no problem with you <br/>
saying there are these other lists out there that focus on xyz. BUT, the <br/>
problem is when maybe there are people who are really just not understanding <br/>
it yet, and if they keep listening and posting, something may click. To be <br/>
told it might be better to go somewhere else serves no purpose that I can <br/>
see. Let others decide for themselves while giving them the information. <br/>
Please don&#39;t suggest to others what list is best for them. That is where the <br/>
problem arises in my opinion<br/>
<br/>

 Is there a problem with me having listed my articles page, or the <br/>
 unschoolingotherwise page, or unschooling.com?<br/>

people post and the tone of the list?<br/>
People get &quot;called out&quot; for expressing what they believe unschooling <br/>
to be and not to be.  When others agree with that person, it gets <br/>
called a &quot;section of the group&quot; or a clique.  They get told they are <br/>
being rude and chasing people away with their opinions and the ways <br/>
they express them.  They also get told they have no right to define <br/>
something that others have decided doesn&#39;t need to be defined.<br/>
This list should be open to unschooling and peoples experience of it <br/>
and opinions of ways it can go astray.  We are bombarded IRL with <br/>
thing children MUST do.  Lets come here and listen to all the ways <br/>
people have learned to say &quot;NO, they don&#39;t need that!&quot;<br/>

good for the list (less unhappiness, more unschooling information).&quot;<br/>
