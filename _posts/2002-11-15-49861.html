(although I do sing---and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s horribly out of tune). And no way to <br/>
check because I&#39;m NOT going to sing solo for you! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, the musical intelligence requirement is a no go. Ben and I like <br/>
music--many sorts. And the children HEAR a lot. Cameron has played with a lot <br/>
of instruments---even wants a set of drums for Christmas. We have several <br/>
harmonicas, a tiny violin, an acoustic and an electric guitar, two keyboards, <br/>
bongos, and maybe a few other things---but nothing (other than the CD player) <br/>
gets played except for occasionally the bongos quietly at night and the <br/>
keyboards every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no way the musical intelligence is an indication! We&#39;re living proof! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But how about animal lovers as a possible requirement for unschooling? Seems <br/>
as if there are quite a few here. BUT there are also some unschoolers who <br/>
would NEVER have a pet in the house. Them I just would not associate with!<br/>
