&lt;&lt; s this standard practise in county hospitals? Is there <br/>
 any thing else I should watch out for when having  a <br/>
 baby in an American hospital?<br/>
 Sigh. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes there are other things you should watch out for.  <br/>
Some hospitals are giving Hep B vacc right after <br/>
birth.  Find out hospital policy about rooming in.<br/>
You might want to look into eye drops and Vit K<br/>
shot.  They may also do the test where they prick<br/>
the baby&#39;s foot, can&#39;t think of the name of that, but<br/>
its really not necessary to do until your milk comes<br/>
in around 5-7 days after birth I believe (even if your<br/>
milk comes in day 3 still wait a few more days).<br/>
Lastly, what I did not know, even though I had<br/>
said breastfeeding, no formula, they managed<br/>
to slip a bottle of water to my dd. Who would of<br/>
known?  I had three planned homebirths, with the<br/>
first I wound up in the hospital after 26 hrs of labor.<br/>
I had a nurse that I couldn&#39;t stand telling me that<br/>
I was too loud, telling me that I had to sign the <br/>
episiotomy form just in case, to which I said that<br/>
the dr. better not cut me and she said that he might<br/>
have to and I said he better not do it, as I am <br/>
refusing to sign the form. Turns out I dont&#39; tear,<br/>
even delivering 9 plus # babies.  It was annoying to<br/>
say that least to have my child in the hospital.  Being<br/>
a more experienced mom (now) I would never go<br/>
to the hospital in my circumstances, as there was<br/>
no emergency, only a tired mama and a sick <br/>
midwife who had just gotten home from England <br/>
two days before.  I kept my baby with me as long<br/>
as I could, never let her go until she started crying<br/>
in the middle of the night and I couldn&#39;t get her<br/>
back to sleep. They took her from me (I had no<br/>
one there to care for her at midnight, she had<br/>
been sleeping in my bed with me, I swear I <br/>
dont&#39; think that anyone knew that). When I<br/>
woke at 4 am I demanded my baby back and<br/>
have felt guilty ever since (thats when they gave<br/>
her the water and I only found that out when a<br/>
nurse accidentally said something about it to<br/>
me and I had a fit--much to my dh&#39;s dismay--<br/>
that she was successfully breastfeeding and did<br/>
not need any supplements including water)  that they<br/>
took my baby for those four hours she was alone!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra mentioned the birth plan, a great book for<br/>
putting one of those together is called A Good<br/>
Birth, A Safe Birth.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
