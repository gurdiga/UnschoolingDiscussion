<br/>
&quot;Also, you may find that your local home-school support group is <br/>
populated mostly by &quot;unschoolers.&quot; Classical education is <br/>
diametrically opposed to &quot;unschooling,&quot; which is immensely <br/>
popular among many homeschoolers. &quot;Unschooling is <br/>
child-centered. It assumes that the child will learn all that she <br/>
needs to know by following her natural impulses and that any <br/>
learning that is &quot;imposed&quot; on the child by an authority figure will <br/>
prove unproductive.<br/>
<br/>
Classical education is knowledge-focused, not child-focused. it <br/>
attempts to teach knowledge in a way that awakens the child&#39;s <br/>
interest, but the child&#39;s interest is not the sole determining factor <br/>
in whether or not a subject should be followed. How does a child <br/>
know whether something will interest and excite her unless she <br/>
works at unfamiliar (and perhaps intimidating) material to find <br/>
out what it&#39;s all about?<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers also tend to denigrate &quot;book&quot; learning in favor of <br/>
&quot;real&quot; learning. Many unschoolers claim that day-to-day realities <br/>
of family life provide plenty of opportunities for learning. for these <br/>
unschoolers, taking care of the house, grocery shopping, <br/>
cooking, car repair, working in the family business, writing <br/>
thank-you notes, and so on provide enough opportunity for <br/>
children to learn real-life skills without &quot;doing school&quot; om a <br/>
formal way.<br/>
<br/>
While this may be true, a child&#39;s education shouldn&#39;t be limited to <br/>
&quot;real life skills.&quot; Classically educated children should be able to <br/>
cook, write thank-you notes and tie their shoes. They also know <br/>
where their country came from, how to construct a logical <br/>
argument, and what puella means.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers claim that students who aren&#39;t forced to learn <br/>
mathematics tables in third grade can pick them up in a day <br/>
once they hit sixth or seventh grade and get interested on their <br/>
own. In our experience, the student who doesn&#39;t learn the math <br/>
tables in third grade will never be comfortable enough with math <br/>
to get interested in sixth or seventh grade.<br/>
<br/>
If you end up in a local group of unschoolers and you want to <br/>
follow the curriculum we&#39;ve outlined in this book, you&#39;ll probably <br/>
need to switch groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is the main place I found that deals with unschooling. I <br/>
thought there was a reference in the intro too but can&#39;t find it now. <br/>
The two authors, Susan and Jesse, believe in early phonics and <br/>
reading as well. (Susan is the daughter and Jesse is the <br/>
mother).<br/>
<br/>
When I read TWTM, I like the idea of offering a child wonderful <br/>
ideas and facts of other places and times, teaching them to <br/>
reason and put their thoughts into competent writing and <br/>
enabling them to interact with information from a rich variety of <br/>
sources.<br/>
<br/>
What got to us after using it as a &quot;plan&quot; is that the very goal I <br/>
wanted to achieve (that the child would be excited by and <br/>
stimulate in his/her education) became drudgery and the very <br/>
things I hoped would catch fire became onerous. By leaving the <br/>
kids alone, and by providing lots of great books to read, and <br/>
enjoying them together as they&#39;ve been inteested, we&#39;ve ended <br/>
up learning about many of the very topics Susan imagines they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t cover... left to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, nuff said. :)<br/>

from the library a few years ago and remembered that there was at least one <br/>
passage that criticized unschooling and several paragraphs of instruction <br/>
that made me shake my head. <br/>

<br/>
If anyone hasn&#39;t looked at who the other speakers will be, here is the lineup:<br/>
<br/>
SIGMUND BROUWER IS A RENOWNED AUTHOR OF OVER 50 BOOKS. HIS BOOKS ARE ON OVER <br/>
2,000,000 BOOKSHELVES. He is a sought after speaker in home based education <br/>
circles as a well as being a very popular informational and motivational <br/>
speaker in public circles in the US and Canada. We want to thank Sigmund for <br/>
giving us a special rate that has allowed us to bring him in on our limited <br/>
convention budget.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd is a popular speaker in the US at home based education functions. <br/>
She looks forward to her first time to talk with Saskatchewan home based <br/>
educators. Sandra Dodd taught English for 6 years in New Mexico, before they <br/>
choose to home educate their family. None of her children have attended <br/>
public school. She has mastered the art of educating without rigid structure. <br/>
<br/>
Cheryl Garrett IS COMING AS A FEATURE SPEAKER. There have been so many <br/>
requests for her that we have chosen to invite her for 2003 convention. She <br/>
specializes in classical education and organizing your home based education.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA has been invited by popular request also. It is unfortunate that Dallas <br/>
Miller cannot atttend, but he had assured us the someone from the <br/>
organization will come to give us some of the update on home based education <br/>
situations at home and abroad. It is always important for us to keep abreast <br/>
of UN and federal legislation, etc. that can seriously effect our lives and <br/>
the education of our children.</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s just SO foreign.<br/>
Altogether foreign.<br/>
<br/>
But I do need to really read and think about it so I&#39;ll know how to respond <br/>
to their concerns.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t HAVE &quot;students&quot; in my home and they never &quot;hit sixth grade,&quot; and if I <br/>
just even said that, the people would just look at me as though I just fell <br/>
out of a well.<br/>
<br/>
But I have kids who can multiply in their heads.  And they actually MULTIPLY, <br/>
they didn&#39;t memorize the answers.  SHEEEESH!!!<br/>

<br/>
Yes, if you want to believe what the book says about unschooling it will help <br/>
greatly if you stay away from any actual unschoolers!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I knew people felt that way, but I didn&#39;t know they were charging people <br/>
money to &quot;learn&quot; about unschooling from them.<br/>
<br/>
I am getting the physical willies.  Shivering.  Maybe I&#39;ll go drink some warm <br/>

<br/>
But thank you VERY much for typing that in.  I printed it out to put with my <br/>
workshop notes to study between now and then.  It will help for me to have <br/>
names, so if someone says &quot;What do you think about Susan Bauer&#39;s writings&quot; I <br/>
won&#39;t have to say &quot;WHO!?&quot; but I can suavely say, &quot;Oh, The Well Trained Mind?&quot; <br/>
  So thanks!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602120255">I must confess that before I discovered unschooling, we used The Well-Trained Mind.  I now politely refer to it as The Well-Fried Mind.  My children were SOOO stressed trying to follow this method!!!  <br/>
<br/>
They start Latin in 3rd grade and my oldest was drowning within 6 months from the intensive English, Math, and Latin requirements, as well as their requirements for a chronological study of History and then Science as well, plus Art, Music & Bible requirements.  <br/>
<br/>
My children would start their day at 8 am and we were lucky if we had everything finished by 4 pm.  <br/>
<br/>
This was NOT what I started homeschooling for!!!  They were soon crying when it was time to do school! :(  <br/>
<br/>
It might work for some, but it certainly didn&#39;t work for my kids.  They needed to seriously de-school before they even wanted to tackle anything remotely &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The MHEA Conference in Maryland (my state!) is the 5th of April and it&#39;s predominantly an unschooling conference and they&#39;re having Jessie Wise as their guest speaker this year (the co-author of The Well-Trained Mind).  I&#39;m wondering how it&#39;s going to work out!!!  ::ducking in advance::<br/>

We had the same result with TWTM, my children were older, started when they<br/>
were about 11 and 12.  I don&#39;t think we ever finished school by 4:00 p.m.<br/>
(And we were all stressed!) My son, especially, would spend hours trying not<br/>
to do the outlining and any other writing!  I have great schoolish looking<br/>
stuff for his &quot;cumulative&quot; file, but  he hated every minute of it!  Now, I<br/>
have nothing for his file, but he is smiling!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think tyour conference is going to go very well, lol.  You might<br/>
want to go incognito!  We have the opposite situation here.  Our convention<br/>
will be featuring John Taylor Gatto (I can&#39;t wait!) and I would say about<br/>
99% of the people would relate to the Bauers much better.  I would asked if<br/>

Unschoolers also tend to denigrate &quot;book&quot; learning in favor of <br/>
&quot;real&quot; learning. Many unschoolers claim that day-to-day realities <br/>

unschoolers, taking care of the house, grocery shopping, <br/>

This is the main place I found that deals with unschooling. I <br/>
thought there was a reference in the intro too but can&#39;t find it now. <br/>
The two authors, Susan and Jesse, believe in early phonics and <br/>
reading as well. (Susan is the daughter and Jesse is the <br/>
mother).<br/>
<br/>
When I read TWTM, I like the idea of offering a child wonderful <br/>
ideas and facts of other places and times, teaching them to <br/>
reason and put their thoughts into competent writing and <br/>
enabling them to interact with information from a rich variety of <br/>
sources.<br/>
<br/>
What got to us after using it as a &quot;plan&quot; is that the very goal I <br/>
wanted to achieve (that the child would be excited by and <br/>
stimulate in his/her education) became drudgery and the very <br/>
things I hoped would catch fire became onerous. By leaving the <br/>
kids alone, and by providing lots of great books to read, and <br/>
enjoying them together as they&#39;ve been inteested, we&#39;ve ended <br/>
up learning about many of the very topics Susan imagines they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t cover... left to themselves.<br/>

(And we were all stressed!) My son, especially, would spend hours trying not<br/>

stuff for his &quot;cumulative&quot; file, but  he hated every minute of it!  Now, I<br/>
have nothing for his file, but he is smiling!<br/>

I don&#39;t think tyour conference is going to go very well, lol.  You might<br/>

will be featuring John Taylor Gatto (I can&#39;t wait!) and I would say about<br/>

Fast!  Before &quot;your kids&quot; figure out that the other kids are having a<br/>

PS  (I do know some lovely homeschooling moms that have chosen the WTM<br/>
approach for their kids.  I don&#39;t snort and spit at them IRL, honest. <br/>
But the quote from the book is just too damned provocative.)<br/>
<br/>
**so if someone says &quot;What do you think about Susan Bauer&#39;s writings&quot; I <br/>
won&#39;t have to say &quot;WHO!?&quot; but I can suavely say, &quot;Oh, The Well Trained<br/>
Mind?&quot; **<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you look at her book on Amazon, you can see book recommendation<br/>
lists for classical homeschooling that include her book.  Looking at<br/>
those lists is an interesting form of anthropology or sociology or<br/>
snoopology, whatever.</div>

  We had the same result with TWTM, my children were older, started when they<br/>
  were about 11 and 12.  I don&#39;t think we ever finished school by 4:00 p.m.<br/>
  (And we were all stressed!) My son, especially, would spend hours trying not<br/>
  to do the outlining and any other writing!  I have great schoolish looking<br/>
  stuff for his &quot;cumulative&quot; file, but  he hated every minute of it!  Now, I<br/>
  have nothing for his file, but he is smiling!<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think tyour conference is going to go very well, lol.  You might<br/>
  want to go incognito!  We have the opposite situation here.  Our convention<br/>
  will be featuring John Taylor Gatto (I can&#39;t wait!) and I would say about<br/>
  99% of the people would relate to the Bauers much better.  I would asked if<br/>
  you wanted to trade, but I am really looking forward to this.  I imagine<br/>
  most of my homeschooling friends will be skipping all of the general<br/>
  sessions after the first one, and I will be skipping everything but the<br/>
  general sessions!<br/>

  &gt; I must confess that before I discovered unschooling, we used The<br/>
  Well-Trained Mind.  I now politely refer to it as The Well-Fried Mind.  My<br/>
  children were SOOO stressed trying to follow this method!!!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; They start Latin in 3rd grade and my oldest was drowning within 6 months<br/>
  from the intensive English, Math, and Latin requirements, as well as their<br/>
  requirements for a chronological study of History and then Science as well,<br/>
  plus Art, Music & Bible requirements.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; My children would start their day at 8 am and we were lucky if we had<br/>
  everything finished by 4 pm.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; This was NOT what I started homeschooling for!!!  They were soon crying<br/>
  when it was time to do school! :(<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; It might work for some, but it certainly didn&#39;t work for my kids.  They<br/>
  needed to seriously de-school before they even wanted to tackle anything<br/>
  remotely &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>

  &gt; The MHEA Conference in Maryland (my state!) is the 5th of April and it&#39;s<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190383316">&lt;&lt;Classical education is knowledge-focused, not child-focused. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This quote was really interesting to me, given that I am re-reading  David Guterson&#39;s Family Matters: Why Homeschooling Makes Sense. <br/>
<br/>
Guterson argues, in chapter one,  that good education *should be child centred - we are talking about a real child and not a robot. After considering and adapting to the child, then look at the knowledge, method, whatever, he says. The child and his/her needs are more important than the method and facts. Then any learning is real, relevant,  remembered... ...<br/>
<br/>
I have read TWTM. I have  also read Gatto. Both talk about the importance, to our civilisation, of thinking and not just following. Bauer/Wise suggest a structured curricula to teach thinking, which seems a contradiction in terms. Gatto suggests being with the child and  their interests;  using real life experiences and disussion.  ....Leonie W. <br/>

life is usually radically different than the mainstream, but I (usually) get <br/>
along well with others and dont have a problem interacting with and enjoying <br/>
the company of others.  Round here in the Bible Belt, it&#39;s not all bad, is <br/>
it.. :-)<br/>

Thank you.  I&#39;m saving all this good stuff in case I&#39;m ambushed by some <br/>
subset of 1,000 Christian homeschoolers in a foreign country.  <br/>
<br/>
Guterson&#39;s making sense!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people have said kids can&#39;t possibly learn algebra in the real <br/>
world.<br/>
So I&#39;ve said &quot;What are you saying, that algebra doesn&#39;t exist in the real <br/>
world?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And when they say &quot;yes,&quot; that&#39;s the wrong answer, because I pin them to the <br/>
mat with<br/>
&quot;Then why learn it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I suppose some classically trained people could tell me in Latin that I&#39;m <br/>
ig&#39;nernt, but how many people would understand what they had just said OR <br/>
believe them?  <br/>

That&#39;s not my quote.  That doesn&#39;t matter.  It was a quote from a book on The <br/>

someone said that when I described unschooling (which I did because someone <br/>
asked) I made it seem that some of the things they were doing were  <br/>
unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Seems, Madam? Nay, it is.  I  know not &#39;seems&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could&#39;ve said that, but I didn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
If a parent chooses to teach reading and another family&#39;s children learn to <br/>
read without that teaching, then that teaching has been proven to have been <br/>
unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
But if the parents have told the children repeatedly that they HAVE to do <br/>
what the mom&#39;s making them do or they won&#39;t learn to read, then our lives <br/>
make them liars.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent tells a little kid that they HAVE to do book reports or they&#39;ll <br/>
never get into college, if my happy slacker kids go to college, that mother <br/>
was not truthful.<br/>
<br/>
We are a great danger to parents who are forcing their children to &quot;do work&quot; <br/>
with threats and promises and guarantees.<br/>
