<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187679692">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i think this is a very important issue.  it seems, in general, that<br/>
&#39;sharing&#39; has not only become an issue of power for children but for<br/>
parents as well .  it is a sad perversion of the parent/child<br/>
relationship.   there is so much social pressure to &#39;civilize/socialize&#39;<br/>
your children that children are being forced to exhibit behaviors that<br/>
have no essential meaning, turning them into &#39;trained animals&#39; (diane&#39;s-<br/>
I have forced her to before and she  did it).<br/>
<br/>
deepak chopra wrote a book: the seven spiritual laws for parents.   it&#39;s<br/>
a nice little book about a way<br/>
&#39;to keep the innocence flowing.  there&#39;s a lot in this world that can<br/>
destroy innocence and precious little that can keep it flowing. &#39;   &#39;as<br/>
parents, then, what we teach our children is no different from what we<br/>
must keep teaching ourselves.&#39;<br/>
the issue of self-esteem does not lay solely in the lap of children,<br/>
many parents have very low self-esteem making it difficult to love their<br/>
children because they struggle with loving themselves (this struggle is<br/>
often expressed by the use of control over ones environment; which often<br/>
children are seen as, instead of, equal contributing members of the<br/>
family).<br/>
<br/>
in chopra book he talks about power and sharing in the context of the<br/>
spiritual development of the self.<br/>
&#39;spirituality, the value of the preschool stage is that power is<br/>
spiritual - only the distortion of power leads to problems.   so rather<br/>
than try to curb your child&#39;s rush to power, you need to channel it into<br/>
tasks and challenges that teach balance.&#39;   &#39;in our love for the child,<br/>
we allow the illusion (of power) to exist, because we want her to grow<br/>
up a strong, capable person who feels up to any challenge that comes<br/>
along.   this sense of self-esteem won&#39;t develop if the feeling of being<br/>
powerful is shut down or repressed at this stage.&#39;<br/>
it seems to me that we, as parents, balance the need to protect our<br/>
children from the world and to protect the world from our children<br/>
(grabbing, hitting - basic expressions of power &lt;g&gt;).  this balance,<br/>
within today&#39;s &#39;politically correct&#39; climate (not to say that<br/>
historically this hasn&#39;t also been the case, for example in the name of<br/>
religion many injustices have been perpetrated against children, new<br/>
face, old problem), has been forsaken.  children&#39;s right to develop and<br/>
acquire the tools that will aid them in finding their own happiness and<br/>
contentment, is being sacrificed for the good of the group (again<br/>
another balance to be maintained, but given some time and some<br/>
suport/faith this balance will happen- the development of the self will<br/>
naturally be followed by a caring of others, provided the child does get<br/>
the opportunity to develop self).<br/>
<br/>
chopra goes on to say that giving and sharing (among other attributes)<br/>
are really acquired around the ages of 5-8, not that children do not<br/>
experienced these before this time, but giving and sharing are<br/>
experienced more toward the child rather then from the child (much like<br/>
the example diane gave of the girl learning to say please because she<br/>
experienced it rather than was told that it was the &#39;right&#39; thing to<br/>
do).  chopra says:<br/>
&#39;giving is how, at any age, we show that we empathize with needs outside<br/>
ourselves.  if giving is seen as a loss - i have to give something up so<br/>
you can have it (illustrated by diane&#39; example of the boy being forced<br/>
to give up his piece of pottery)  - the spiritual lesson of this stage<br/>
has not been taught.  giving, in spiritual terms, means &quot; i give to you<br/>
without loss to me because you are part of me&quot;.   a young child can not<br/>
fully grasp this idea, but he can feel it.   children don&#39;t just want to<br/>
share - they love to share.   they feel the warmth that comes from<br/>
reaching beyond ego boundaries to include another person in their world;<br/>
no act is more intimate, and therefore no act feels so blissful.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
carolyn&#39;s story of the 18 month old girl is sad for 2 main reasons:<br/>
first is because the girl is being asked to do something well beyond her<br/>
years and out of rhythm with her natural development; and second, and<br/>
equally sad, is that the mother, needing to control her daughter, lacks<br/>
faith in her child&#39;s ability to develop and grow.  this lack of faith<br/>
undermines this most primary and critical relation.  we are so lost to<br/>
our need to appear &#39;on top of it&#39; and to be &#39;doing the right thing&#39;,<br/>
that we have forgotten that these things have no meaning if the<br/>
relationship is lost.<br/>
<br/>
a personal example that i can give is the issue of &#39;where the child<br/>
should sleep&#39;.    our son has always slept with us though he has had his<br/>
own bed (giving him a choice and a the sense of power to exercise that<br/>
choice), which we bought when he was around 18 months old.   at that<br/>
time he choose to sleep in it for about 2 months but then returned to<br/>
&#39;the big bed&#39; and still sleeps there (he was 4 in sept.).  the commonly<br/>
accepted practice of, literally, no time in the &#39;parents&#39;, because the<br/>
child will become too attached and never individuate, has not been a<br/>
reality for us.  rene&#39; is extremely independent to the point that he<br/>
virtually potty trained himself, always introduces himself to new people<br/>
and does not hang on me (in public that is, though at home is another<br/>
story:) and has not experienced any overly dependent behavior, in fact<br/>
he is amazingly confident and has a strong sense of who he is.  what he<br/>
has learned is that his needs will be met, his desires do matter and his<br/>
happiness is as important as every other member of the family.  the joy<br/>
and satisfaction i personally experience because of this is more than i<br/>
could have imaged (or could have &#39;willed&#39; into existence) and this is<br/>
why i feel great sorrow when parents literally stop themselves from<br/>
having an opportunity to experience this level of relating by trying to<br/>
force their children to conform to some pre-set/external concepts of<br/>
&#39;right and wrong&#39;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465960542">Diane McBryan Alignan:<br/>
<br/>
Of power, I would like to say - it&#39;s really about a solid sense<br/>
of self - of feeling right.  This, unfirtunately becomes issue if power<br/>
when others/culture begin to destroy/change/shape a self.  At a very<br/>
young age when a self is forming, focus shifts from being oneself - <br/>
*all of oneself* - to exerting power in order to retain and preserve<br/>
oneself.  That&#39;s load of unjust work for anyone to have to do - each <br/>
and every day.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to share something from Erich Fromm.  This is getting<br/>
off the unschooling topic - but I thought it was very important and<br/>
I wanted to quickly throw it out there and bounce off of what Susan <br/>
had written in her excellent post.<br/>
<br/>
Erich Fromm wrote:<br/>
Selfishness is one kind of greediness. (The German word Selbstsucht<br/>
(addiction to self) very adequately expresses this quality common to all<br/>
Sucht.) Like all greediness, it contains an insatiability, as a<br/>
consequence of which there is never any real satisfaction. Greed is a<br/>
bottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy<br/>
the need without ever reaching satisfaction. This leads to the crucial<br/>
point: close observation shows that while the selfish person is always<br/>
anxiously concerned with himself, he is never satisfied, is always<br/>
restless, always driven by the fear of not getting enough, of missing<br/>
something, of being deprived of something. He is filled with burning<br/>
envy of anyone who might have more. If we observe still closer,<br/>
especially the unconscious dynamics, we find that this type of person is<br/>
basically not fond of himself but deeply dislikes himself. The puzzle in<br/>
this seeming contradiction is easy to solve. The selfishness is rooted<br/>
in this very lack of fondness for oneself. The person who is not fond of<br/>
himself, who does not approve of himself, is in a constant anxiety<br/>
concerning his own self. He has not the inner security which can exist<br/>
only on the basis of genuine fondness and affirmation. He must be<br/>
concerned about himself, greedy to get everything for himself, since<br/>
basically his own self lacks security and satisfaction. The same holds<br/>
true with the so-called narcissistic person, who is not so much<br/>
overconcerned with getting things for himself as with admiring himself.<br/>
While on the surface it seems that these persons are very much in love<br/>
with themselves, they actually are not fond of themselves, and<br/>
their narcissism - like selfishness - is an overcompensation for the<br/>
basic lack of self-love. Freud has pointed out that the narcissistic<br/>
person has withdrawn his love from others and turned it toward his own<br/>
person. While the first part of this statement is true, the second one<br/>
is a fallacy. He neither loves others nor himself. <br/>
<br/>
Erich Fromm also wrote:<br/>
The criticism of democratic society should not be that people are too<br/>
selfish; this is true but it is only a consequence of something else.<br/>
What democracy has not succeeded in is to make the individual love<br/>
himself; that is, to have a deep sense of affirmation for his individual<br/>
self, with all his intellectual, emotional, and sensual potentialities.<br/>
A puritan-protestant inheritance of self-denial, the necessity of<br/>
subordinating the individual to the demands of production and profit<br/>
[the good of society], have made for conditions from which Fascism could<br/>
spring. The readiness for submission, the pervert courage which is<br/>
attracted by the image of war and self-annihilation, is only possible on<br/>
the basis of a - largely unconscious - desperation, stifled by martial<br/>
songs and shouts for the F�hrer. The individual who has ceased to love<br/>
himself is ready to die as well as to kill. The problem of our culture,<br/>
if it is not to become a fascist one, is not that there is too much<br/>
selfishness but that there is no self-love. [***&gt;]The aim must be to<br/>
create those conditions which make it possible for the individual to<br/>
realize his freedom, not only in a formal sense, but by asserting his<br/>
total personality in his intellectual, emotional, sensual qualities.<br/>
This freedom is not the rule of one part of the personality over another<br/>
part - conscience over nature, Super-Ego over Id - but the integration<br/>
of the whole personality and the factual expression of all the<br/>
potentialities of this integrated personality. <br/>
<br/>
He continues:<br/>
The problem of selfishness has a particular bearing on psychotherapy.<br/>
The neurotic individual often is selfish in the sense that<br/>
he is blocked in his relationship to others or overanxious about<br/>
himself. This is to be expected since to be neurotic means that<br/>
the integration of a strong self has not been achieved successfully. To<br/>
be normal certainly does not mean that it has. It means, for the<br/>
majority of well-adapted individuals that they have lost their own self<br/>
at an early age and replaced it completely by a social self offered to<br/>
them by society. They have no neurotic conflicts because they<br/>
themselves, and, therefore, the discrepancy between their selves and the<br/>
outside world has disappeared. Often the neurotic person is particularly<br/>
unselfish, lacking in self-assertion and blocked in following his own<br/>
aims. The reason for this unselfishness is essentially the same as for<br/>
the selfishness. What he is practically always lacking is self-love.<br/>
This is what he needs to become well. If the neurotic becomes well, he<br/>
does not become normal in the sense of the conforming social self. He<br/>
succeeds in realizing his self, which never had been completely lost and<br/>
for the preservation of which he was struggling by his neurotic<br/>
symptoms. A theory, therefore, as Freud&#39;s on narcissism which<br/>
rationalizes the cultural pattern of denouncing self-love by identifying<br/>
it with selfishness, can have but devastating effects therapeutically.<br/>
It increases the taboo on self-love. Its effects can only be called<br/>
positive if the aim of psychotherapy is not to help the individual to be<br/>
himself; that is, free, spontaneous and creative - qualities<br/>
conventionally reserved for artists - but to give up the fight for his<br/>
self and conform to the cultural pattern peacefully and without the<br/>
noise of a neurosis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287114648">Just had to intejhect quickly here.....Our third duaghters first phrase was &quot;thank you&quot;,  which she began one morning as I got her out of her crib (She was about 12 or 13 mos. old)  She so easily says &#39;please&#39; and &#39;thank you&#39; appropraitely -- and after thinking it over and observing things....I came to the strong conclusion that it was simply because she has heard that in our typical verbal exchanges as a family.  <br/>
    I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re the Cleaver family here...and she is your typical rambunctious, not-always-willing-to-share, &#39;i do it myself&#39;, kind of toddler.  We do try to give her room to &#39;own&#39; her feelings, especially when they&#39;re intense.  I agree also that it&#39;s something I as a parent try to continually learn for myself....especially in a society where we&#39;re often told intellect is more important than emotion.<br/>
    Hopefully,  my children and I will both learn to couple our intellects with our emotions...then we can truly live what we are passionate about.<br/>
    Many Blessings to all & Happy Holidays!<br/>

Who is going the way of Joel and others and focusing on family until the New Year...Hope to be less of a &#39;lurker&#39; then.....I do enjoy everyone&#39;s input and discussion!<br/>
