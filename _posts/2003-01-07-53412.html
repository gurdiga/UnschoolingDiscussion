Excuse me, but the post you are referring to was not mine. I haven&#39;t <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; expressed any opinion about it either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yol<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt; THERE you are.. LOL.. I already pointed that out.. I was hoping I was right <br/>
and you didnt have some &quot;other identity&quot; on this group.. :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I have no other &quot;identity&quot; here nor anywhere, and I always write my name at the end of my posts. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Foxglovestudio@...">Foxglovestudio@...</a> doesn&#39;t and that&#39;s where the confusion came from. <br/>
Now, why would someone ASSUME that it was my post simply makes me wonder if there isn&#39;t some prejudice about me lurking in there, but that&#39;s something I can do nothing about. Nor care much about either, for that matter...  ;-)<br/>

Foxglove Studios.  No predudice against you at all, Yol.  Now would the real<br/>
Foxglove Studios please stand up?  Now that I know you aren&#39;t Yol, I&#39;d like<br/>
to be reminded as to who you are.<br/>

for the digest.  It&#39;s a lot easier to read this than all of the separate<br/>
entries.  Thank you, too, for including the one I sent in the Digest #2800,<br/>
#6. I&#39;m sure I will get more involved as time passes.<br/>

confusion. FoxgloveStusio and you both use similar sentance structure and <br/>
word choices. (At least to my untrained eye!)<br/>
