<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382187643">I think comparing your brave, self sacrificing son to John Hinckley is not<br/>
a useful exercise.  The more useful comparison, it seems to me, are where<br/>
the similarities are numerous so that the difference (here unschooling) has<br/>
more obvious causality.  Or, if you want to think of it another way, how<br/>
could John Hinckley&#39;s life been different (assuming you knew him really<br/>
well) if he had been raised with more kindness, more attachment more<br/>
understanding than he got?  Could his pathology have been addressed?  Who<br/>
knows.    But I think I know in the case of my own children that if they<br/>
were raised in an unkind, uncaring, environment instead of the one I try to<br/>
provide for them they would be more frustrated, less happy, they would have<br/>
more self doubt than they presently have.  I feel certain that they are<br/>
better off and better people because of this.  If I didn&#39;t I might be<br/>
standing in line for the most convenient behaviorist style quick fix<br/>
parenting I could find.  I&#39;d put them to bed on a schedule, get rid of them<br/>
at school and daycare and get on with my own interests , hobbies, or<br/>
profession.  <br/>
<br/>
How we raise them does matter.  It matters a lot.  You only need to look at<br/>
the kids in your personal experience to find ones that would be so much<br/>
happier if they didn&#39;t have to go to school, or if they had parents who<br/>
listened to them instead of making decisions for and about them.  Of course<br/>
it matters.  But as in most things it&#39;s complex.  The longer I parent the<br/>
more I feel that at it&#39;s core, it&#39;s the love, kindness and respect that<br/>
makes the difference.  AP and unschooling are an expression of those things<br/>
but when I think of the really great kids I&#39;ve known  who come from more<br/>
traditional families, those qualities are still core.  Too simplistic, I<br/>
know, but still important.  All kids need these things and some do a lot<br/>
with precious little but they would still do better with more.<br/>
<br/>
OK I guess everyone can tell I&#39;m on a midnight rant. %)  Tomorrow I&#39;ll read<br/>
this in the digest and blush.<br/>

<br/>
Makes me think of dogs.   I don&#39;t see as much meanness toward dogs as I did <br/>
when I was younger, which is wonderful.   But I&#39;ve known dogs that could&#39;ve <br/>
been great and happy be yelled at (and worse) and they get scared and sad and <br/>
confused and become more irritating to their owners and dangerous to others.   <br/>
<br/>
Please just think the details of worst-dog-treatment stories and don&#39;t tell <br/>
them here.   I bet we all have visions in our minds we wish we could forget, in <br/>
that area, but to use dogs as a &quot;remember the nicest dogs you&#39;ve known and <br/>
the skittiest?&quot; takes it out of the way more complex realm of children growing <br/>
up with cultural/religous/school/birthorder/environmental factors.<br/>

To me, the influence of genetics, sibling position, etc. make mindful parenting that much more important - it is the part of the equation that I can control. And I agree, I think it makes a huge difference. I think societal ills could be improved and the Hinckleys and Dahmers of the world largely prevented if our culture could move toward better parenting. Not that there are not other factors and influences, but you can profoundly affect the multi-generational disease processes of your family of origin. This can be seen easily with physical symptoms - a genetic tendency for heart disease or cancer can be mitigated by changes in diet, lifestyle, stress reduction (perhaps an even bigger factor than previously thought) etc.  <br/>
<br/>
My thinking has been influenced by Bowen Theory - family systems theory - (www.thebowencenter.org/pages/theory.html) - which views birth order, family of origin etc. to have a large influence for good or ill on our emotional life. But far from being fatalistic, Bowen therapists train people to intentionally influence and improve the health of the family system. This is done primarily through self-differentiation. Mindful parenting could be seen as a form of self-differentiation. Parenting focused not on how children behave, but on how I behave.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Karen, I&#39;m Cheryl and new, here. I was wondering how far you think your<br/>
influence as a parent &quot;now&quot; will stretch in to the future, if at all?  Is<br/>
there an underlying question you&#39;re asking, that you haven&#39;t fully<br/>
recognized?<br/>
<br/>
This discussion brought to mind, for me, my tendency over the years to blame<br/>
my parents for my problems... and how difficult it has been to take<br/>
responsibility for my problems. Sure I&#39;ve given my parents credit, as well,<br/>
but for this topic, I&#39;m focusing on blame.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult, I have tools, experiences and have sought examples to help me<br/>
change, but I struggle with how difficult change is because of the way I was<br/>
raised created habits that feel impossible to break, sometimes...basically,<br/>
my emotions make the struggle more intense.  I mean, if I&#39;m working on<br/>
myself, (taking responsibility), yet get frustrated that I can&#39;t change,<br/>
quicker, I might start to feel angry with my family for having created an<br/>
environment that *made* me this way. Yet, stopping my growth-work to feel<br/>
angry & blame others is just as unproductive as was the environment my<br/>
parents created years ago... and now *I&#39;m* the &lt;responsible&gt; adult!  Seeing<br/>
it that way helps slap me out of it, dissipate my anger, stop the blaming<br/>
and move on.<br/>
<br/>
Something else that comes to mind as I write this is that I don&#39;t really<br/>
reach out for help from my parents. I&#39;m sad that we are so disconnected, but<br/>
have brushed it off as a consequence of *their parenting*.  I hope that I<br/>
can model a strong sense of self-awareness, compassion, strength, and wisdom<br/>
so that my daugther will choose to stay connected to me, no matter what age<br/>
she is, and vice versa.  In that way, my sphere of influence directly<br/>
reflects a connection to my daughter, now & always. Perhaps I need to spend<br/>
more effort reconnecting to my parents, if not only as a model for my<br/>
daughter, but for my own personal growth.<br/>
<br/>
Did I make any points in musings?  I think I interpreted your words in this<br/>
thread a desire for people to take responsibility for their lives. Yet I am<br/>
not sure whether you agree with us that your actions as a parent have a<br/>
*lasting* effect on your children, regardless of their ability to be<br/>
responsible.<br/>

I really haven&#39;t been saying that parenting makes no difference.  I&#39;ve  said <br/>
that parenting makes a difference in the &quot;now&quot;, but we can&#39;t presume  against <br/>
the future.  I&#39;ve been saying that we don&#39;t get to claim credit or  blame for <br/>

what I think.  I think about this often.<br/>
 <br/>
And I certainly WASN&#39;T comparing my son to John Hinkley.  I was  comparing <br/>
how their mothers should feel/think/be responsible for what they  do.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m recovering from a minor surgery in which the doctor found a &quot;stone&quot;  <br/>
inside my upper lip, and so I&#39;m in a Vicodin haze.  This topic may zip by  before <br/>
I can be coherent again.  If that&#39;s so, then I&#39;ll just enjoy reading  the <br/>
responses.<br/>
