&gt; on their own having lived this way. And how do you plan to help that along?<br/>

spend it doing stuff he doesn&#39;t care about.  I want him to see how<br/>
incredibly wonderful the world is -- educational, multi-faceted, and just<br/>
plain FUN.  <br/>
<br/>
I think if you love life, you&#39;ll be happy.  If you do things you care about,<br/>
you&#39;ll be fulfilled.  And if you&#39;re happy and fulfilled, you&#39;ll have great<br/>
self-esteem, good self-confidence, make the right kind of choices growing<br/>
up, etc.  Maybe I&#39;m an idealist, but I have never been happier than the day<br/>
I quit working full-time at a job I hated to stay home and raise a child I<br/>
loved.  <br/>
