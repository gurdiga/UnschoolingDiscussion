&lt;&lt;&lt;I must be evil then. I got hit by an inappropriate giggling fit at the <br/>
cheesiness and had to hurry out of the theatre to glares from <br/>
everyone else.<br/>

When my dh and I were dating we saw Body Double together.  I laughed throughout the movie because of the campiness and the obvious take-offs to Hitchcock, whom I adore!  I was getting lots of evil glares because most of these *funny* moments were also during the *thriller* moments, like when the drill comes unplugged only millimeters from the victim&#39;s stomach.  My dh wanted me to leave, but I refused, just glared back at all the old biddies &lt;BWEG&gt; and it&#39;s still one of my favorite movies!!<br/>
