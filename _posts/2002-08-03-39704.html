<div id="ygrps-yiv-247403977">Thanks, Joz, for expressing my feelings before I had the nerve to do so<br/>
: )<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so much the disagreeing that bothers me, it&#39;s the TONE of these<br/>
disagreements.  Really nasty and negative.....condescending and<br/>
self-righteous.   Perhaps we need to learn to express our beliefs and<br/>
feelings alittle more positively? : )<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have belonged to many email lists over the year (and am also a<br/>
long-time moderator of two lists...an infertility list and a parenting<br/>
after infertility list) so am well acquainted with these types of posts.<br/>
On our lists, however, these types of posts would not be tolerated.  You<br/>
simply are not allowed to publicly berate or flame another member<br/>
(you&#39;re not even allowed to &#39;beat a dead horse&#39;....before it went on<br/>
_this_ long, the moderator would step in and announce that it was time<br/>
to drop the subect and move on!  For a nasty post directed directly<br/>
towards another member, you would be &#39;warned&#39; to BE NICE, and then you&#39;d<br/>
be unsubscribed if you persisted.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying anything about the content of Ned&#39;s post, but the fact<br/>
alone that all of you ganged up on him so nastily made me feel alot of<br/>
sympathy for him.  <br/>
<br/>
Obviously, you can just &#39;have at&#39; each other here, so I&#39;ll go back to<br/>
lurkdom and ponder whether I should just try to find a nicer unschooler<br/>
list or if I should just use my delete button next time this happens.<br/>
BTW....does anyone know of a &#39;kinder, gentler&#39; unschooling list?<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see this as a &quot;support list&quot;, per se. It&#39;s a discussion list, a<br/>
learning and growing list, and IMO it&#39;s not a good fit for people who<br/>
want only pats on the back and &quot;do whatever works for you and call it<br/>
unschooling&quot;. There *is* an awful lot of support here for people who are<br/>
trying to live as unschoolers, and who are willing to critically examine<br/>
the ideas they hold about learning and living.<br/>
<br/>

find out what this list is like before you rush to judge it.<br/>
<br/>
If you do decide to look for another list, you can plus &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
into the search box at yahoogroups and find quite a few...<br/>

published articles he has written and have told him and others how much I <br/>
appreciate what he and Luz have to say. We appear to disagree very strongly <br/>
about this one issue, though, and, in fact, (listening Ned? &lt;g&gt;) I think he&#39;s <br/>
being inconsistent and misleading. I think he can take hearing that - he <br/>
probably thinks I&#39;m being pigheaded and dimwitted not to think the same way <br/>
he does about it &lt;G&gt;. I wish he&#39;d pay attention to what other people here <br/>
have to say and be responsive to that because we could have a way better <br/>
discussion, I&#39;m sure, and people do tend to get cranky when they spend time <br/>
thoughtfully responding to someone&#39;s &quot;article&quot; and that person ignores what <br/>
they&#39;ve said and just posts more of the same. This is a &quot;discussion list.&quot; <br/>
Discussions can get heated - and that is to be expected sometimes when <br/>
people&#39;s beliefs are being challenged. But we sure do learn a lot from those <br/>
challenges - if we&#39;re willing to keep listening and talking and responding <br/>
and trying to understand other people&#39;s points of view.<br/>

personally but by the minute correspondence I have had with him and <br/>
by reading his post on several lists, I even know he is not going to <br/>
back down on that one. That&#39;s why I sent the phonics jokes. I mean <br/>
really, Ned, giving up Phonics?!?!?!?  I have not read him that long, <br/>
nor know him personally and even I know that ain&#39;t gonna happen ...<br/>

The beauty of email lists is that these are not verbal discussions <br/>
and we can still discuss other people&#39;s ideas even if they refuse to <br/>
participate in the discussion. Still, this kind of complaint comes up <br/>
regularly and I think they are just reminders of how the noise level <br/>
has to go back to thoughtful or even soothing instead of remaining <br/>
strident.<br/>

<br/>
I so agree.  These things weren&#39;t about people, they were about theories and <br/>
ideas and practices.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not saying anything about the content of Ned&#39;s post, but&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Without the fact of the content (and tone) of the posts, how could you have <br/>
an opinion?    I&#39;ve been in discussions about spanking, in which families&#39; <br/>
lives were changed from swatting children to not-at-all hitting them.  Those <br/>
changes don&#39;t come from anyone saying &quot;Well, you know your children best, and <br/>
if hitting is what works, that&#39;s fine!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In such discussions when some people are showing how their own real children <br/>
are thriving and &quot;behaving&quot; without being hit, any statement like &quot;Oh, <br/>
lighten up people--a little spanking isn&#39;t going to make that much <br/>
difference,&quot; would have to be met with REAL opposition, or else those who <br/>
want justification for hitting might take that and say &quot;Well, in one <br/>
anti-spanking argument...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In those discussions I care about the future of those children, and those <br/>
families, and the grandchildren.  That&#39;s not really the time to think, &quot;Well <br/>
this spanking mother needs support.&quot;  Yes she does need support, but she <br/>
needs (from that list) support to STOP.&quot;   AA meetings don&#39;t serve drinks for <br/>
those who would really like one.  Anti-smoking groups don&#39;t have just a few <br/>
ashtrays out just in case.  And unschooling groups shouldn&#39;t take seriously <br/>
the idea that reading will come natural only after phonics is learned or <br/>
taught or mastered somehow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t see this as a &quot;support list&quot;, per se. It&#39;s a discussion list, a<br/>
learning and growing list,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad when it happens, but it happens with some regularity.<br/>
<br/>
People who were not involving themselves in a debate come and complain that <br/>
they want people debating for their benefit, they want the issues discussed, <br/>
but they want them discussed on their previously-unstated terms.  Complaining <br/>
of those who ARE brave enough to stick their necks out to make a point for <br/>
the benefit of those who are not brave enough serves what purpose?  <br/>
<br/>
A watered-down unschooling group that accepts just about anything as a <br/>
possible unschooling practice serves what purpose?<br/>

<br/>
Does spanking have to do with unschooling?  Lots of ways.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a culture in which spanking was not only common but considered a <br/>
necessary part of good parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t accept that.  <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in and around families in which children were shamed and belittled. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Accepting that doesn&#39;t promote harmony.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We grew up surrounded by, inside, working in schools--most of us here.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t the world be more harmonious if we all just give up this divisive <br/>
homeschooling folly and accept the culture&#39;s decision to have schools, and <br/>
send our children back to school, and peacefully live in that culture with an <br/>
attitude of acceptance?<br/>
<br/>
It WOULD be more harmonious.<br/>

condone them. It is just an acknowledgement that it indeed happens. <br/>
 From there, then, one can work towards changing that. Attacking and <br/>

 From there, then, one can work towards changing that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling wasn&#39;t well known or accepted when I started doing it. I got help <br/>
from families who were doing it pretty much in isolation.  I got bad examples <br/>
from families who were using structure, and their kids didn&#39;t much like them <br/>
anymore (nor did they much seem to like their kids).<br/>
<br/>
I came into contact with people who had NO living local examples, one way or <br/>
another.  On Prodigy and earlier AOL, and now with internet forums.  There is <br/>
more homeschooling information to be had in an hour nowadays than I could get <br/>
by any means in a year when Kirby was five and didn&#39;t go to kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Attacking and <br/>
inflicting pain and suffering to those who create pain and suffering <br/>
is not going to stop the cycle but feed it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you didn&#39;t intend to say that I had attacked and inflicted pain.<br/>
<br/>
Defending natural reading methods isn&#39;t an attack on anything but the idea <br/>
that children can&#39;t learn to read naturally.  I know with absolute certainty <br/>
that they can.<br/>
<br/>
But I know with certainty that a mom can&#39;t even begin to help that happen if <br/>
she doesn&#39;t believe it CAN happen.  If a mom is convinced that teaching <br/>
phonics is a prerequisite to them reading, then her children will not be able <br/>
to learn gradually, and peacefully, and in their own personal way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687657345">To all,<br/>
<br/>
People have complained. You can agree or disagree, but most <br/>
importantly, you can just &quot;listen&quot; for what the complaint brings. <br/>
What you may have &quot;listened&quot; is that you (meaning the people <br/>
partaking in a discussion) are wrong. When I read complaints like <br/>
that what I listen is that maybe the focus of the rebuttals could <br/>
need a little bit of tweaking and less &quot;passion&quot; in the choice of <br/>
words. It could also mean that these newbies may have to wait a bit <br/>
longer to understand the diversity of &quot;humors&quot; on this list. The <br/>
thing is that, I find that most unschooling discussion lists carry a <br/>
similar tone --and that may have to do with the fact that most of the <br/>
same people are in these lists.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that, when people work up the courage to present <br/>
these complaints, we all should listen. The you in my previous post <br/>
was not a personal you but a collective you. Now, notice I did not <br/>
say &quot;change&quot; or  &quot;you are wrong&quot; or &quot;that is not true&quot;. I am choosing <br/>
my words very deliberately because (1) I am not talking to you/you <br/>
but a whole community; (2) this is not about rights or wrongs; this <br/>
is just about having more effective communication.<br/>
<br/>
Newbies have communicated and we all can choose to acknowledge the <br/>
communication or dismiss it. The people that post most of the time on <br/>
the list will have bearing on how the newbies regard the WHOLE <br/>
community represented in the list.<br/>
<br/>
HARMONY, as a practice in choosing our words, is not so much about <br/>
who we are as individuals but what we want to be as a community.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

  &gt;Wouldn&#39;t the world be more harmonious if we all just give up this divisive<br/>
  &gt;homeschooling folly and accept the culture&#39;s decision to have schools, and<br/>
  &gt;send our children back to school, and peacefully live in that culture with an<br/>
  &gt;attitude of acceptance?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;It WOULD be more harmonious.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
  Actually accepting that pain and suffering are everywhere is not to <br/>
  condone them. It is just an acknowledgement that it indeed happens. <br/>
   From there, then, one can work towards changing that. Attacking and <br/>
  inflicting pain and suffering to those who create pain and suffering <br/>
  is not going to stop the cycle but feed it. Accepting that there are <br/>
  indeed people who do not agree with your ideas is cultivating <br/>
  harmony. Trying to convert them or conquer them by attacking them or <br/>
  ostracize them is not.<br/>

&gt; To all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People have complained. You can agree or disagree, but most<br/>
&gt; importantly, you can just &quot;listen&quot; for what the complaint brings.<br/>
&gt; What you may have &quot;listened&quot; is that you (meaning the people<br/>
&gt; partaking in a discussion) are wrong. When I read complaints like<br/>
&gt; that what I listen is that maybe the focus of the rebuttals could<br/>
&gt; need a little bit of tweaking and less &quot;passion&quot; in the choice of<br/>
&gt; words. It could also mean that these newbies may have to wait a bit<br/>
&gt; longer to understand the diversity of &quot;humors&quot; on this list. The<br/>
&gt; thing is that, I find that most unschooling discussion lists carry a<br/>
&gt; similar tone --and that may have to do with the fact that most of the<br/>
&gt; same people are in these lists.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me get this straight, there are how many people on this list? Hundreds<br/>
right? And you are suggesting that people on the list should &quot;modify their<br/>
tone&quot; so as to not upset some of the members? Let me come out of long term<br/>
lurkville to suggest that from my point of view the &quot;passion&quot; in the tone of<br/>
voice is of great value to me. I can go all over the net and watch people<br/>
patting themselves on the back and using LLLLOvely words to express exactly<br/>
nothing. <br/>
<br/>
And when someone jumps into a new list or discussion area with a &quot;play nice<br/>
you&#39;re upsetting me message&quot; it sets off big warning bells for me. I know I<br/>
would never assume that what I thought about a brand new list was so valuable<br/>
I&#39;d try to get other people, long term members of an existing list, to do what<br/>
I wanted without trying to figure out what was really going on first. In<br/>
short, if someone does something like that I expect that they have some sort<br/>
of an agenda. At the least they are pretty self-centered and rude. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The bottom line is that, when people work up the courage to present<br/>
&gt; these complaints, we all should listen. The you in my previous post<br/>
&gt; was not a personal you but a collective you. Now, notice I did not<br/>
&gt; say &quot;change&quot; or  &quot;you are wrong&quot; or &quot;that is not true&quot;. I am choosing<br/>
&gt; my words very deliberately because (1) I am not talking to you/you<br/>
&gt; but a whole community; (2) this is not about rights or wrongs; this<br/>
&gt; is just about having more effective communication.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are all sorts of &quot;communication&quot;. And the examples you have given might<br/>
seem calm, sane, and reasonable to you. We all experience things through the<br/>
lens of our own experience and perceptions. In my own experience, when people<br/>
start crying &quot;play fair&quot; it has usually meant that the ones with power didn&#39;t<br/>
want anyone upsetting them by mentioning some essentially unfair advantage<br/>
they held and yet refused to acknowledge as part of the dynamic. It might have<br/>
been a clique of girls as school who were taking turns picking on one of the<br/>
members. It might have been someone who did something awful to their child but<br/>
thought to mention it was beyond the pale: the whole it&#39;s not wrong to hit,<br/>
it&#39;s wrong to flinch ideology. The point is, some people feel that saying what<br/>
they mean and meaning what they say is o.k. and that there isn&#39;t really some<br/>
higher standard of compassionate communication that the holy adhere too. The<br/>
honest among us admit that we all have some sort of agenda and that in<br/>
communicating about things that we care deeply about on email lists we are<br/>
also attempting to gain the approval of our audience. So, to come onto a list<br/>
and cry &quot;Play fair&quot; one would have to ask by what rules? Who profits?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Newbies have communicated and we all can choose to acknowledge the<br/>
&gt; communication or dismiss it. The people that post most of the time on<br/>
&gt; the list will have bearing on how the newbies regard the WHOLE<br/>
&gt; community represented in the list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. So, the people on this list with the most experience and the most<br/>
valuable things to say should change what they have to say so that the people<br/>
with the least amount of experience and, as far as we know, the least amount<br/>
to say about the subject, should feel comfortable and in their element? I<br/>
certainly didn&#39;t feel that I had the right to butt in and tell people to<br/>
behave in a certain way when I joined this list. My own opinion is that<br/>
telling people what is rude and unpolite is one of the rudest things a person<br/>
can do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; HARMONY, as a practice in choosing our words, is not so much about<br/>
&gt; who we are as individuals but what we want to be as a community.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is the point of this list to give off harmonic vibes to newcomers? I don&#39;t<br/>
know how much there is to be learned in that. Might make a good support list<br/>
for feeling good. I have other places and lists where I go to get pats on the<br/>
back and kudos from those who think much as I do. I love those places but I<br/>
don&#39;t always learn new things there. I think we learn the most when we go<br/>
beyond our usual boundaries and comfort zones.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Accepting that there are<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But *why* do they disagree? Why do they believe what they do? What are they<br/>
basing their beliefs on?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect a lot of people feel comfortable with trying out ideas that<br/>
intrigue them in order to find the ones that work for their families. It<br/>
sounds like an unschooling process :-)<br/>
<br/>
What they&#39;ll end up with is what-makes-mom-comfortable. It might be<br/>
unschooling. Then again it might not be unschooling because it&#39;s a rare<br/>
person who hasn&#39;t been affected by society&#39;s ideas about how children need<br/>
to learn and be raised. And therefore what-makes-mom-comfortable is quite<br/>
often what quiets the fears instilled by society.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is what-makes-mom-comfortable then trying things to see<br/>
what works will work. But if their goal is unschooling and they don&#39;t find<br/>
learning from life naturally, comfortably obvious, then<br/>
what-makes-mom-comfortable won&#39;t get them to unschooling. If they can dig<br/>
deep and analyze what&#39;s going on then they can learn to see for themselves<br/>
when they&#39;re making decisions based on fear and when they&#39;re making<br/>
decisions based on reality. Then they&#39;ll be able decide for themselves when<br/>
what-makes-mom-comfortable isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what the discussions are about: holding fears and myths up to the<br/>
light of day. If someone doesn&#39;t feel they need the discussions, they don&#39;t<br/>
need to participate.  But the discussions are *very* valuable to others.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;m not insensitive to how discussions can be irritating and seem<br/>
like just a bunch of noise. My state&#39;s homeschooling list split into 2<br/>
because of heated legal discussions: one for legal issues and one for<br/>
homeschooling. I come away from the legal issues list with an attitude of<br/>
What is the point?? and Who really cares?? But I also come away from the<br/>
other list with, well, nothing. It&#39;s full of intros and welcomes and<br/>
questions and answers about resources.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Trying to convert them or conquer them by attacking them or<br/>
&gt; ostracize them is not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to be a common perception that the goal of people involved in the<br/>
discussions is winning. But just because it&#39;s common doesn&#39;t make it right<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of discussing some issue is not winning but clarity and<br/>
understanding. It&#39;s disentangling multiple issues to get to the heart of the<br/>
issue being discussed. It&#39;s evaluating the support for each sides&#39;<br/>
conclusions to see what has a solid foundation and what crumbles.<br/>
<br/>
If one person wants to offer ideas and another wants to clarify, evaluate<br/>
and disentangle, I can see how that could be perceived as an attack.<br/>
Perception doesn&#39;t make it an attack though.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;absolutely!that&#39;s actually an old lyric from an ex- boyfriends(none <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;than kip winger)song that came to mind.but io do find that every new <br/>
&gt;bit<br/>
&gt; &gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;knowledge opens a vast new world, therefore, my awareness of how little <br/>
&gt;i<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;actually know...it&#39;s a humbling experience.<br/>

It is a paradox (another thing I&#39;ve learned to live with, in my OLD age &lt;G&gt;) <br/>

confident that I know a whole lot that is worthwhile passing along to others.<br/>
