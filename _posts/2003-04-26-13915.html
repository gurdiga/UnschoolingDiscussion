<div id="ygrps-yiv-391182697">I tried to name a New Mexico Unschooling list &quot;Goof Group.&quot;  That was the <br/>
name of our old unschooling group.  But it&#39;s taken, by fans of A Goofy Movie. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Fine.<br/>
<br/>
So I started looking to see what&#39;s already taken.  The other working list (I <br/>
had shared with two other locals for feedback) was this:<br/>
<br/>
Wait...<br/>
What should I call this list?  There are a couple of southern Colorado <br/>
(Durango corner) people...<br/>
It should be easy to spell, easy to remember, not ambiguous.<br/>
NMun?<br/>
too short?<br/>
enchantingunschooling?<br/>
too long?<br/>
ZiaUnschool?<br/>
learningwithoutcrap?<br/>
(no, I guess not)<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
Doddlocal?<br/>
(but Holly will grow up and I&#39;ll be out of it)<br/>
<br/>
Our old group was called &quot;the Goof Group&quot;<br/>
goofgroup@yahoogroups?<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t have goofgroup.<br/>
<br/>
So I came here to sit on my unschooling cyber-couch and put my feet <br/>
figuratively up and to think aloud.<br/>
<br/>
I found the following detritus while looking:  I have a three year old group <br/>
called &quot;NewMexicoHomeschooling with 125 people or so on it and found this <br/>
one, newer, and some other oddities<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
NOT much range.<br/>
<br/>
-=- just talk including, scripture, God, church, parents, kids, home <br/>
cleaning, lessons and curriculum, on-line courses, and web sites. -=-<br/>
<br/>
They listed unschooling as a keyword.  Very sad.<br/>
<br/>
And the pagan school...  &quot;schudual changes. . . . all who are sincre about . <br/>

<br/>
I guess not teaching my kids to write is okay.<br/>
<br/>
***sigh***<br/>
<br/>
So I need something short yet descriptive, clever, yet easy to spell.<br/>
Something non offensive, something maybe catchy, to draw people together, but <br/>
to ward off people we don&#39;t want to attract and let people know right away we <br/>
don&#39;t want them to come and advertise the algebra home course they just wrote <br/>
last week and that we don&#39;t want to hire someone for $350 to come and tell <br/>
our group about Charlotte Masons or Charlotte Shriners nor even Charlotte <br/>
Rainbow Girls.<br/>

The iconography of New Mexico involves road runners, zias, desert this, <br/>

Holly says it should be something the kids can say so they can talk about <br/>
going there.  So the name of the yahoogroup needs to be what the kids will <br/>
call what they go to.<br/>
<br/>
Scratch&#39;n&#39;Sniff, Holly just recommended.  Then she farted dramatically.<br/>
