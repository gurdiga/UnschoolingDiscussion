&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now this is where my BUT comes in. I know parents who are<br/>
&gt; respectfully parenting their spirited children. But some only<br/>
&gt; respect the child, not other people. One family in particular are<br/>
&gt; not even attempting, it would seem, to teach their gifted, spirited<br/>
&gt; child that other people deserve repect also.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Hi!<br/>
     i think this is a very important point you make - &quot;some are and <br/>
some aren&#39;t&quot;.  while parenting a spirited or gifted child can be very <br/>
demanding and challenging, the one family probably would let thier <br/>
child exhibit this sort of behavior irregardless of them being <br/>
spirited or gifted.  that&#39;s just my opinion but don&#39;t know enough <br/>
about the people make that sort of assumption so have a counter <br/>
arguement for that as well....... further down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is NOT an isolated incident. This child is severely gifted in<br/>
&gt; the traditional areas. He has been tested and told the results. He<br/>
&gt; has been heard on several occasions to say to kids he&#39;s trying to<br/>
&gt; play with &#39;you have to play my way, because I&#39;m gifted and I so know<br/>
&gt; better than you what to do&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  sounds like he is not getting the guidance to use his giftedness <br/>
in a positive manner.    <br/>
<br/>
 I know a couple of other<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; families with similarly behaved children, though this would be the<br/>
&gt; worst. They are so proud of their children&#39;s abilities - and these<br/>
&gt; are, I agree, unusually intelligent kids - but somehow, having<br/>
&gt; discovered that the &#39;spirited&#39; behaviour is common among gifted<br/>
&gt; children, they seem to feel that the behaviour is acceptable, and<br/>
&gt; must be accepted by everyone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This is unfortunate and in the long run is only going to hurt the <br/>
child.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; These and a couple of other children seem to have only one volume -<br/>
&gt; full on - and are extremely disruptive. The parents are caring,<br/>
&gt; loving, intelligent people. I can only assume that they are<br/>
&gt; suffering so badly from shell shock that they just don&#39;t see how<br/>
&gt; unpleasant their children are to others.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  my counter arguement...  maybe they just don&#39;t know what to do <br/>
anymore or where to turn so are trying to play it down so it doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem so bad to others or to make themselves feel like failures.  you <br/>
don&#39;t mention the age of the other kids you refer to but in the case <br/>
of the 9 yo, i&#39;m sure the parents through some of the earlier years <br/>
were trying their best and hardest, only to be met with the utmost <br/>
negatively from people who probably don&#39;t even know them!  i don&#39;t <br/>
think this is an acceptable excuse to let your children rule <br/>
everybody and everything, BUT in also in their defense maybe<br/>
they just don&#39;t know what else to do.  i&#39;m sure they&#39;ve heard it all <br/>
when it comes to trying to talk to someone about their child&#39;s <br/>
behavior and realizes it was a wasted effort to even begin to try and <br/>
get someone to understand what they were talking about!<br/>
<br/>
 Furthermore, they use the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; child&#39;s intelligence to excuse the behaviour, and seem to expect the<br/>
&gt; rest of us to sit by<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This is totally unacceptable in my eyes.  Neither gifted or <br/>
spirited should be an excuse for rude, unrespectful, unruly behavior. <br/>
 I know a lot of parents with spirited kids that would agree <br/>
and are working very hard to teach their children about their <br/>
spiritedness and how to manage their behavior in a positive manner.  <br/>
This includes recognizing when they are becoming overwhelmed by too <br/>
much stimulii and ways to tone themselves back down before they get <br/>
entirely out of control, respect for other&#39;s feelings and space, and <br/>
so on.  it&#39;s an exhausting job but equally has it&#39;s rewards.    <br/>
<br/>
 I can accept the child: I can&#39;t accept a family<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; where the parent allows the child to disturb / annoy / physically<br/>
&gt; hurt / emotionally harm others without any intervention, because<br/>
&gt; &#39;it&#39;s just the way he is / he can&#39;t help it / it&#39;s just part of his<br/>
&gt; giftedness / he&#39;s spirited / he&#39;s got to be free to express<br/>
&gt; himself....&#39;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Perhaps if you listen carefully you might detect an underlying <br/>
reason of why she&#39;s making excuses?  Is she on the internet?  maybe <br/>
suggest she join a discussion group such as this one but for parents of <br/>
spirited kids?  You could send her over to mine for starters.  there <br/>
are more and more surfacing all the time if someone would to spend <br/>
some time searching the net.  see my signature line at the bottom for <br/>
mine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess what I am saying is, spirited is great. These are exciting<br/>
&gt; neat kids who have such a lot of potential. But they also need<br/>
&gt; guidance in how to learn to fit in with other people. I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; calling for mindless conformity - just a bit of consideration for<br/>
&gt; others, which will ultimately make life a lot more fun for them as<br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i couldn&#39;t agree more.  Sterling is spirited and i would not (or <br/>
let anyone else) break that spirit but i work with him constantly to <br/>
help him recognize it for the gift that it is and the good it can <br/>
bring him.  i won&#39;t tolerate for him to use his persistance to bully <br/>
his way around into getting what he wants.  He&#39;s taught to use his <br/>
mind and words creatively, to channel all that energy to do positive <br/>
things, and not to use his body (as in hitting) to get results.<br/>
Believe me, we have our days.  but he is only 3 yo and still <br/>
learning.  Some days he forgets everything and does things out of the <br/>
clear blue that he knows better and i work with him about it.<br/>
The difference i am hearing is that the people you know seem to<br/>
have given up on doing anything about the behavior.  <br/>
<br/>
  i don&#39;t know what else to say at this point except try to be <br/>
patient and understanding so that you may be able to tactfully point <br/>
her to some resources?  Please don&#39;t misunderstand me to say that you <br/>
should quietly accept being hit either.  It is not appropriate <br/>
behavior for any child and spirited or gifted is no exception!!  Do <br/>
the same that you would if anyone else child did the same.  If you <br/>
don&#39;t, you are just encouraging the excuses as being acceptable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301395902">I don&#39;t have a &#39;spirited&#39; child, although I have had one that was definitely<br/>
&#39;interesting&#39;! (ie threw massive tantrums for a long time) and 3 out of 4 of my<br/>
boys would check out on at least 12 of the 14 traits on the ADD list. But I don&#39;t<br/>
believe they are ADD or spirited - they are just boys.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading some of the posts with interest, however, knowing several<br/>
people with children that fit this description, some friends, some not. Yesterday<br/>
I was attacked, yet again, by one of these children, and feel the need to comment.<br/>
I have seen how hard it is to live with some of these kids. I have seen how tired<br/>
and despondent 2 of my friends in particular have been at times. I am sympathetic.<br/>
I have looked after my friends&#39; kids.<br/>
<br/>
But......<br/>
<br/>

&gt;  (ask those parents with well behaved toddlers).  I encourage all of you to<br/>
&gt;  hang in there. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I certainly don&#39;t think of you as a rotten parent. My eldest was a climber and<br/>
very active in every way. A woman gave me and another woman a lecture on how we<br/>
should train our boys to sit nicely, be quiet and not run around. I used to have<br/>
fantasies about sending my boy around to visit her daughter and lead her astray<br/>
when they got to 16 - 17 &lt;beg&gt; She was soooo complacent.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:LivnLetLrn@...">LivnLetLrn@...</a><br/>
&gt; Ah, thanks for the kind words, coming at exactly the right time, as we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; struggling again (still?!) with respectful parenting of a spirited 4-1/2 year<br/>
&gt; old son.  On good days we think of him in terms like &quot;free spirited,&quot; &quot;mind<br/>
&gt; of his own,&quot; &quot;a leader, not a follower,&quot; &quot;inquisitive and curious.&quot;  Other<br/>
&gt; days I have less wonderful descriptions running through my mind.  ::::sigh::::<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ll keep hanging in there, hoping and believing that what we&#39;re doing is<br/>
&gt; right, knowing that other parenting choices may alleviate some of the<br/>
&gt; stresses we face as parents but may not be the best choices for the long-term<br/>
&gt; well-being of our son.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now this is where my BUT comes in. I know parents who are respectfully parenting<br/>
their spirited children. But some only respect the child, not other people. One<br/>
family in particular are not even attempting, it would seem, to teach their<br/>
gifted, spirited child that other people deserve repect also. When I say I was<br/>
attacked, I mean it. I was sitting on the floor at our homeschool family playday<br/>
talking to a friend and her 5yo daughter, and this 9 yo came up and literally hit<br/>
me on the head and started telling (yelling) me something. When I said to him &#39;I<br/>
was listening to Shelley, and I&#39;d like it if you would wait till she&#39;s finished,<br/>
and also I don&#39;t like being hit on the head because it hurts&#39; he said - &#39;but I<br/>
want to tell you something&#39; and continued to tell (yell) me.<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT an isolated incident. This child is severely gifted in the traditional<br/>
areas. He has been tested and told the results. He has been heard on several<br/>
occasions to say to kids he&#39;s trying to play with &#39;you have to play my way,<br/>
because I&#39;m gifted and I so know better than you what to do&#39;. His sister was very<br/>
much the same, but is finally learning, the hard way, at 12, that if she wants to<br/>
have friends she has to change her ways. I know a couple of other families with<br/>
similarly behaved children, though this would be the worst. They are so proud of<br/>
their children&#39;s abilities - and these are, I agree, unusually intelligent kids -<br/>
but somehow, having discovered that the &#39;spirited&#39; behaviour is common among<br/>
gifted children, they seem to feel that the behaviour is acceptable, and must be<br/>
accepted by everyone.<br/>
<br/>
The saddest thing of all: This child&#39;s mother sat and told me in all seriousness<br/>
how cruel and unwelcoming the other children were to her kids, and how sad they<br/>
were that no-one would play with them. When my Jeff came to her once and asked her<br/>
to do something because her son kept breaking Jeff&#39;s construction, her response<br/>
was &#39;well tell him you don&#39;t like it&#39;. Jeff said he had and that the boy had<br/>
continued - she did nothing. He physically manhandles the children who try to<br/>
befriend him, and his response to any request to modify his behaviour in any way<br/>
is to look at the person with a look of disdain and to reply &#39;but that&#39;s what I<br/>
want&#39;. The daughter also used to tell other children that what they were doing was<br/>
useless, that she knew better. Both scream / used to scream at the tops of their<br/>
voices for their mother to make the other children do as they want them to do -<br/>
for up to half an hour.<br/>
<br/>
These and a couple of other children seem to have only one volume - full on - and<br/>
are extremely disruptive. The parents are caring, loving, intelligent people. I<br/>
can only assume that they are suffering so badly from shell shock that they just<br/>
don&#39;t see how unpleasant their children are to others. Furthermore, they use the<br/>
child&#39;s intelligence to excuse the behaviour, and seem to expect the rest of us to<br/>
sit by while their little precious trys (literally in one case) to strangle our<br/>
kids. Say what? Yes, I believe in respectful parenting, but I also believe in<br/>
respecting other people in society too.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend with a child that almost anyone would describe as ADHD. For a long<br/>
time she used to leave her son with her husband or parents when she visited<br/>
friends - except me. She said I was the only friend who would accept her son&#39;s<br/>
behaviour as something he couldn&#39;t help, so she brought him to our house. Why?<br/>
Because when he infringed on other people&#39;s freedoms she intervened. And that&#39;s<br/>
the crux of the matter. I can accept the child: I can&#39;t accept a family where the<br/>
parent allows the child to disturb / annoy / physically hurt / emotionally harm<br/>
others without any intervention, because &#39;it&#39;s just the way he is / he can&#39;t help<br/>
it / it&#39;s just part of his giftedness / he&#39;s spirited / he&#39;s got to be free to<br/>
express himself....&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am saying is, spirited is great. These are exciting neat kids who<br/>
have such a lot of potential. But they also need guidance in how to learn to fit<br/>
in with other people. I&#39;m not calling for mindless conformity - just a bit of<br/>
consideration for others, which will ultimately make life a lot more fun for them<br/>
as well.<br/>

That is exactly our main challenge around here -- helping our son learn to <br/>
control himself in a way that is respectful of ourselves and those around us, <br/>
without crushing his spirit in the process.<br/>
<br/>
I have unfortunately been in similar situations to the one you described <br/>
where the child was obnoxious, but the difference is that I would have <br/>
promptly removed my son from the situation and talked with him about it in a <br/>
quiet place, possibly then to return for another try or go home and shift <br/>
gears.  I suspect that parents of spirited kids aren&#39;t the only ones faced <br/>
with such challenges.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105105475">Carol, I know I too have experienced children with the behaviors you are <br/>
talking about. You hit the nail on the head. We have 3 boys in our <br/>
neighborhood who are simply rude and imposing to the point that I had to stop <br/>
allowing my children to play with them because I could see the influence. I <br/>
think they have such great potential and at times are great kids but they <br/>
haven&#39;t been taught respect for others. It&#39;s a shame. How do these kids slip <br/>
through the public school system, I wonder, where every child is expected to <br/>
be quiet and follow the rules?<br/>

No flames here.  I call those parents you described as the ones who read<br/>
Mothering Magazine without thinking about what they are reading.  I do<br/>
think you are being too kind to the parents.  When a parent says their<br/>
child should have the right to hurt others, they are not kind loving<br/>
people, but rather selfish self centered folk.  The friend you spoke<br/>
about who was helping her child learn about respecting others will turn<br/>
out a neat kid.  The others will have kids who go through life blaming<br/>
everyone else for their problems, and not understanding why no one likes<br/>
them.<br/>
The parents who talk about teaching boys to sit quietly are called (in<br/>
rather snippy tones) &quot;you know, parents of girls&quot;<br/>
Now for my hard question.  Why are you and the other parents allowing<br/>
your children to be hurt by this selfish woman&#39;s children?<br/>

to think of what to say to her.<br/>
<br/>
But it isn&#39;t just that. Our local h/s group seems to have developed in a<br/>
very inclusive manner. Too inclusive IMO. It is generally accepted in the<br/>
group that every family has the right to parent and homeschool in the manner<br/>
in which they believe to be right for their family. People get very irrate<br/>
if someone tells their child not to do something. One family even got<br/>
indignant because the church from whom we were hiring a building said that<br/>
children were not to play in the carpark area.<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know. We should just stop going. But my kids have friends there<br/>
and the physical space is just great and we live 45 minutes drive away and<br/>
just can&#39;t get into organising something else.... Excuses, excuses. I should<br/>
just front up to these people, but there are enough that believe that the<br/>
family has sole right of control / lack of control that I would just make<br/>
enemies and change nothing. So until we can escape the situation altogether,<br/>
I just make sure I keep close enough to intervene.<br/>
<br/>
Go on. Call me a coward!<br/>

<br/>
If this is a correct interpretation of what you&#39;re saying, then I STILL agree <br/>
with you...it would be completely unacceptable for a harrassed child to miss <br/>
a great activity because an aggressive child ruined the fun.  If I had a <br/>
gentle child who needed to leave something fun because another parent was too <br/>
passive about their child&#39;s behavior, I&#39;d resent it too.  That&#39;s why I remove <br/>
my spirited little man from those types of situations, talk to him, and <br/>
decide whether we should give it another *closely monitored* try or leave, <br/>
with the knowledge that he wasn&#39;t ready for it.  <br/>

Like you said before, it&#39;s all about respect...of him AND those around him.   <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now for my hard question.  Why are you and the other parents<br/>
&gt; &gt; allowing your children to be hurt by this selfish woman&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; children?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is really neat lady - except for her attitude to her kids. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; so hard to think of what to say to her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i can relate and understand this.  it sounds like a touchy <br/>
situation that requires careful thought.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; But it isn&#39;t just that. Our local h/s group seems to have developed<br/>
&gt; in a very inclusive manner. Too inclusive IMO. It is generally<br/>
&gt; accepted in the group that every family has the right to parent and<br/>
&gt; homeschool in the manner in which they believe to be right for their<br/>
&gt; family. People get very irrate if someone tells their child not to<br/>
&gt; do something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  their choice of methods for parenting and homeshooling are one <br/>
thing - anyone&#39;s kids being allowed to become physically aggressive <br/>
with other kids and/or adults is another.  If two children at the <br/>
group ended up in a full blown knock down fight, would everyone just <br/>
stand around and watch if the parents were of the mindset that they <br/>
should be allowed to fight it out as a lesson?  what if one of the <br/>
kids drew a knife out of nowhere (or worse yet, the unspeakable!), <br/>
what then?   why should &quot;one hit on the head&quot;  done in an obviously <br/>
aggressive manner be any different?   being inclusive and respectful <br/>
of everyone&#39;s parenting or homeschooling methods should not mean that <br/>
anyone (or their kids) should have to endure physical attacks of <br/>
aggression - i&#39;m sorry....  spirited, gifted, ADD...  that is no <br/>
longer the issue here.  the issue is that this aggressive behavior is <br/>
not only being tolerated at someone else&#39;s expense, but by allowing <br/>
it, it is encouraging the fact that it&#39;s okay to treat others this <br/>
way and a means to get your own way!  this is not right IMO under any <br/>
circumstances!  <br/>
<br/>
   it&#39;s nice that the group is inclusive of all parenting and <br/>
homeschooling styles but i think it does need a couple &quot;house rules&quot; <br/>
that everyone should have to abide by.  how each parent enforces <br/>
those rules with thier children is where the everyone else&#39;s respect<br/>
of the choice of that parent&#39;s style comes into play.  <br/>
<br/>
 One family even got indignant because the church from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; whom we were hiring a building said that children were not to play<br/>
&gt; in the carpark area.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know, I know. We should just stop going. But my kids have friends<br/>
&gt; there and the physical space is just great and we live 45 minutes<br/>
&gt; drive away and just can&#39;t get into organising something else....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  no, why should your family be impositioned or deprived of utilizing <br/>
the benefits of a group because some kids are being allowed to be <br/>
physical and hurt others?  I used to take Sterling to a playgroup at <br/>
the local gymnastics center.  it&#39;s intent was to give the kids safe <br/>
equipment and area to play in, to learn their social skills when <br/>
playing with other kids, and to give parents the environment to be <br/>
able to teach their kids these things.  the playgroup was for 2-6 yo. <br/>
the rules were simple - no running, no physical contact (hitting, <br/>
pushing, shoving), parents were to be with their kids at all times, <br/>
parents would ensure their kids were following the rules (no matter <br/>
what parenting style they chose to use to enforce them).  yes, kids <br/>
would occasionally be caught hitting another, but the parent was <br/>
expected to step in and &quot;teach&quot; their child that it is not <br/>
appropriate and use whatever method they chose to try and ensure that <br/>
it would not happen again.  There was a monitor present at all times <br/>
and everyone knew that if a child continually broke the rules and the <br/>
parent was not doing anything about it, that the monitor could <br/>
intervene and they could also be asked to leave if the parent did not <br/>
want to participate in keeping the group enjoyable for everyone by <br/>
controlling their child.  With everyone knowing these expectations, <br/>
it was a fun place for the kids to go.  but kids will be kids and i <br/>
think every single child at some time or another lashed out <br/>
inappropriately.  however, it was dealt with immediately because of <br/>
the rules that were in place and everyone was able to get past it <br/>
quickly, put it behind, and enjoy the rest of the session.  in a <br/>
nutshell, learning to treat others the way you want to be treated and <br/>
making sure no one gets physically hurt and having fun, was the basis <br/>
of the group.<br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps this is the philosophy that needs to be adopted by the group <br/>
and implementing any rules necessary for that philosophy to <br/>
materialize.  after all, isn&#39;t part of homeschooling teaching values <br/>
and respect for others?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Excuses, excuses. I should just front up to these people, but there<br/>
&gt; are enough that believe that the family has sole right of control /<br/>
&gt; lack of control that I would just make enemies and change nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i have a question about the group.  what is it&#39;s purpose?  is it a <br/>
meeting to discuss homeschooling issues?  is it a social setting for <br/>
kids to play?  is it a learning session for kids to get together and <br/>
help each other academically? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So until we can escape the situation altogether, I just make sure I<br/>
&gt; keep close enough to intervene.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go on. Call me a coward!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  no, i don&#39;t think you&#39;re a coward.  perhaps a little over-cautious <br/>
to not make waves for the group or appear to go against the <br/>
principles of the group?  perhaps the principles of the group need to <br/>
be better defined.  how long has this group existed?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Anyone ever hear of Cynthia Ulrich Tobias? I have seen her books referenced <br/>
on homeschooling lists of books...well, one night I heard her speak on Focus <br/>
on the Family and I ordered the tape, because it really spoke to me about <br/>
handing spirited children. I highly recommend the tape, you can probably <br/>
still get it on the FOTF website, it was recent.....I also will be reading <br/>
her books on spirited children and learning styles...I also like Mary Sheedy <br/>
Kurcinka, her book on tape at the library was helpful, now I own the <br/>
paperback of it--Raising Your Spirited Child....it is geared more toward the <br/>
younger children....I learned a lot about temperament and how to accept and <br/>
manage the way my child is wired. A few years back I used to resent having <br/>
such a difficult, <br/>
refusing-to-be-a-good-school-student-that-made-me-look-bad-as-a-parent-child. <br/>
Now I am thankful that God would trust me with such a wonderfully curious and <br/>
fascinating creature. Some days are tough but coming from a position of love <br/>
instead of fear makes such a difference. I just hope I can reverse enough of <br/>
the damage I did to my beautiful child with my stupid selfish attitude that I <br/>
had. <br/>

I remember several years ago I was driving in the car and happened to catch <br/>
her on the radio. She was talking about people that see the forest and people <br/>
that see the trees and explaining the ways they learn and how they percieve <br/>
the world differently.<br/>
I broke down crying because I thought for the first time EVER &quot;I&#39;m OK just <br/>
the way I am&quot;.<br/>
My disorganization and haphazard methods were always seen as a problem, as a <br/>
weakness and I never realized I could just be DIFFERENT and myself and it was <br/>
OK.<br/>
I had to be an adult before learning that.<br/>
Isn&#39;t it great that our kids will always know that?<br/>
I am now using those personality differences to BE what I was meant to be. To <br/>
do the things I love and not try to be anyone else. It&#39;s such a wonderful <br/>
thing to realize. Unschooling has healed me tremendously...I&#39;m finally <br/>
pursuing the life I was meant to live.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

Yeah, obedience is overrated.  It certainly makes dull people.  I&#39;m<br/>
