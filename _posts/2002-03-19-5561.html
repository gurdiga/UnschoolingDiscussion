<br/>
Anyway, lets kick off with my ramble...<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d open thedebate on &#39;Unschooling&#39; or &#39;child led learning&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Much to my husband&#39;s horror, I do very little so-called structured<br/>
learning with my children. he&#39;s like to see filled workbooks and written<br/>
stuff but it ain&#39;t happened yet. He wants to know how they can possibly<br/>
&#39;get on&#39; in the world when they never pick up a pen, do maths etc<br/>
(get-on means career, money, pension plans etc etc)<br/>
Generally I am aware of how much they are learning just through our<br/>
conversations and I feel that workbooks are &#39;make-work&#39; to keep adults<br/>
happy but he is concerned that they will need exams and must have the<br/>
ability to take exams and learn.<br/>
Now that DD is 10 he is getting very anxious about her future and that<br/>
she shouldn&#39;t be playing and reading all day. We spend a lot of time<br/>
seeing friends and drinking wine too (me, not the kids)<br/>
<br/>
So, what this ramble is leading too is people&#39;s experiences of<br/>
unschooling older children and their thoughts on unschooling, either for<br/>
or against. Everybody on the list is much more eloquent than me so I can<br/>
just plagarise your words in arguments with DH and sound clever rather<br/>
than say its instinct :-D<br/>
<br/>
On your marks, get set, go.............<br/>

listing all the things you know she&#39;s been doing and learning, but <br/>
translating them first into &quot;Educationese&quot;.  If he was suitably impressed, <br/>
you might want to translate it all back into English so he can see that she <br/>
has really been learning lots all along.<br/>
<br/>
As far as exams go, she can learn that later if she needs it.  She could <br/>
study for and take the GED or the SAT or whatever.  There are books out <br/>
there both to help her learn and to take practise tests from.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mine are 11, 14, and 17 and unschooling has been fine for us. My kids spend <br/>
months looking like they&#39;re doing nothing, sometimes, and then have <br/>
explosions of intense focus on specific things. There has been little to <br/>
nothing that looks like regular, progresive, systematic learning of any <br/>
particular subjects - but somehow they seem to know stuff. Now that they&#39;re <br/>
older, they aren&#39;t really unschooling, I guess, since they take college <br/>
courses - my 17 yo has about 60 units of college work - all her GE <br/>
requirements finished except math (along with a lot of art classes). Even <br/>
though we never did formal studies - no history, math, science, etc., she <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to have any &quot;gaps&quot; in her background knowledge to hinder her in <br/>
her college courses. In fact, she says that she feels like she usually knows <br/>
a LOT more than most of the other students. If you asked her where she <br/>
learned the stuff, she&#39;d say, &quot;From reading, traveling, talking to people, <br/>
watching movies and tv, whatever....&quot;. Hard to really say where it came from <br/>
- just from life. Really.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana, who is 14 (hi Rox) has just started to take a few courses at the <br/>
college - a website design class, an introduction to opera (studying about <br/>
it, not performing), and a beginning voice class. She was nervous about <br/>
&quot;going to college,&quot; worried about things like note taking and writing essays <br/>
for exams, but she&#39;s doing really well - really happy with the classes and <br/>
learning a LOT and, as it turns out, getting good grades too.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 yo has a friend who is in a public school homeschooling program. She <br/>
has to turn in work samples every month. So Rosie (my 11 yo) was spending the <br/>
night at her friend&#39;s house and her friend had to do a bunch of workbook <br/>
stuff so she&#39;d have some work samples to turn in. They decided to play school <br/>
- and Rosie did the worksheets too. It was pretty dismal. The other mom was <br/>
the &quot;teacher&quot; and she marked wrong all the math questions and spelling words <br/>
that Rosie missed. There were a LOT of them. I was kind of annoyed by the <br/>
whole thing - because I didn&#39;t want Rosie getting the feeling she&#39;s &quot;behind&quot; <br/>
or something. I&#39;m not worried about her - she&#39;s fine - she knows a LOT of <br/>
stuff and can simply THINK way more clearly than the other girl - even if she <br/>
can&#39;t spell &lt;G&gt;. The time the other girl has spent doing worksheets, Rosie <br/>
has spent on things she&#39;s INTERESTED in. So, for example, the worksheets <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;test&quot; knowledge of the geography of the world - it isn&#39;t part of the <br/>
5th grade curriculum &lt;G&gt;. But Rosie knows a LOT about world geography - more <br/>
than many adults, probably. Why? Because she LOVES soccer and follows <br/>
international soccer - follows teams from Europe and South America, mostly, <br/>
but also is very very aware of other countries because of the World Cup <br/>
qualifying rounds going on all over the world right now.<br/>
<br/>
So - she knows interesting information about lots of countries in the world, <br/>
but didn&#39;t know how to multiply multiple digit decimal numbers. It hasn&#39;t <br/>
come up. Big deal - she can learn that in minutes - and will, I&#39;m sure, one <br/>
of these days, because it&#39;ll come up and she&#39;ll want to.<br/>

because it won&#39;t be the unschooling that&#39;s the problem. Problems are <br/>
just part of the life that unschoolers learn from. (Yeah, I know Sandra <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for that. I think some of the maths pressure comes because my husband is a<br/>
mathematician/phycisist. He does research into mathematical concepts that the<br/>
rest of the world hasn&#39;t even heard of and thats part of the problem. He forgets<br/>
that generally, for every day life, people don&#39;t need to know how to do<br/>
simultaneous equations or plot a curve on a graph etc.<br/>
He had been looking at the Standards of Learning for Virginia and the English<br/>
National Curriculum which sets out what kids *should* know at particular ages.<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to get across to him that just because he went to a private,<br/>
well motivated school and is amaths genius that generally most children don&#39;t<br/>
*know* all this stuff that the NC says they should. It gets done in class, ticked<br/>
off the list and the class moves on. Very few actually retain it or were<br/>
interested in it but it&#39;s down as being *done* and therefore learnt.<br/>
My daughter is into reading the Classics in abig way at the moment. Dickens,<br/>
Hardy etc etc. I find them tedious beyond words but she loves them. This does not<br/>
interest DH though.<br/>
He tried to give her one of the Maths Sat tests (done at 7, 11 and 14 in the UK)<br/>
for 11 yo&#39;s (she&#39;s nearly 10) but she got flustered cos it was timed, burst into<br/>
tears andran away. This led to a majorly long rant about how was she ever going<br/>
to take exams etc etc with me saying &#39;well isn&#39;t there something wrong with the<br/>
whole exam system. Why should they be timed. pressure blocks memory, you never<br/>
need to do timed things in your job etc.<br/>
<br/>
Ho hum. We&#39;re going away for 3 months this summer. Without DH. As I can&#39;t afford<br/>
to fly home. I&#39;m chucking the tent in the car and heading out into the US to see<br/>
how far I get.<br/>

doing 3 hours of homework a night (and they are ages 10 -- 13) and cramming<br/>
madly for the SATs. When you ask them about school they get twitchy and<br/>
look positively wild-eyed. Apparantly they aren&#39;t even sleeping properly<br/>
and 2 have dropped all sports in order to have more time to study for the<br/>
SATs. Yep, sounds like something I would want to subject my kids too -- NOT!<br/>
<br/>
Blair talks a good line about the standards of schools since National<br/>
Curriculum but in reality they are just forcing kids to become more little<br/>
factory model neurotic people. It&#39;s also interesting that crime by<br/>
adolescents in the UK is reaching an all time high and has doubled in the<br/>
last few years (any relation to national curriculum???). <br/>

from their childhood.  The stuff they did without prompting.  Like making up<br/>
games, working on cars, scouting, whatever. I get them talking about how<br/>
much they learned doing these things outside of school. I can then talk<br/>
about how unschooling capitalizes on that kind of learning.<br/>
<br/>
That usually works without having to go into the inefficiencies and<br/>
counterproductive nature of classroom schooling.  But I go there if I need<br/>
to.  <br/>

about doing community service through<br/>

about collecting cookies to donate to this<br/>

organizations like Girl Scouts.  I said that<br/>
I had agreed to call it a &quot;girls club&quot; in the<br/>
learning records that the EA is supposed to<br/>
write but that I actually write each month<br/>
(as a former teacher, I have all the<br/>
educatational language down) but that I<br/>
refused to change Lexie&#39;s words.  That Girl<br/>
Scouts were/are a part of the public schools<br/>
(although our troop meets at a catholic<br/>
church), meeting in their classrooms, being a<br/>
part of the school (flag ceremonies, etc.),<br/>
and that I wouldn&#39;t change Lexie&#39;s words. She<br/>
replied that it was OK, but in the future if<br/>
I could ask Lexie to refer to it as a girls<br/>
club that would be better but then she said<br/>
that it was OK if I didn&#39;t ask Lexie to do<br/>
that, or that it was OK if Lexie didn&#39;t want<br/>
to or whatever.  I won&#39;t even bring it to<br/>
Lexie&#39;s attention--I thought the entire thing<br/>
was stupid!<br/>
<br/>
I do like all the lovely art supplies we&#39;ve<br/>
gotten, including a bunch of paints and<br/>
stuff. And loads of paper.  The learning<br/>
records I do at work and they take me very<br/>
little time, and the samples are only needed<br/>
2x a year so I put up with it.....especially<br/>
as long as they accept these paragraphs and I<br/>
don&#39;t have to do any stupid worksheets, etc.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, what this ramble is leading too is<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s experiences of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling older children and their<br/>
&gt; thoughts on unschooling, either for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My kids are 10, 13 and 15 and unschooling<br/>
&gt; has worked great all along.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; not going to change courses when there<br/>
&gt; are no problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mine are 11, 14, and 17 and unschooling has<br/>
&gt; been fine for us. My kids spend<br/>
&gt; months looking like they&#39;re doing nothing,<br/>
&gt; sometimes, and then have<br/>
&gt; explosions of intense focus on specific<br/>
&gt; things. There has been little to<br/>
&gt; nothing that looks like regular,<br/>
&gt; progresive, systematic learning of any<br/>
&gt; particular subjects - but somehow they seem<br/>
&gt; to know stuff. Now that they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; older, they aren&#39;t really unschooling, I<br/>
&gt; guess, since they take college<br/>
&gt; courses - my 17 yo has about 60 units of<br/>
&gt; college work - all her GE<br/>
&gt; requirements finished except math (along<br/>
&gt; with a lot of art classes). Even<br/>
&gt; though we never did formal studies - no<br/>
&gt; history, math, science, etc., she<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to have any &quot;gaps&quot; in her<br/>
&gt; background knowledge to hinder her in<br/>
&gt; her college courses. In fact, she says that<br/>
&gt; she feels like she usually knows<br/>
&gt; a LOT more than most of the other students.<br/>
&gt; If you asked her where she<br/>
&gt; learned the stuff, she&#39;d say, &quot;From<br/>
&gt; reading, traveling, talking to people,<br/>
&gt; watching movies and tv, whatever....&quot;. Hard<br/>
&gt; to really say where it came from<br/>
&gt; - just from life. Really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Roxana, who is 14 (hi Rox) has just started<br/>
&gt; to take a few courses at the<br/>
&gt; college - a website design class, an<br/>
&gt; introduction to opera (studying about<br/>
&gt; it, not performing), and a beginning voice<br/>
&gt; class. She was nervous about<br/>
&gt; &quot;going to college,&quot; worried about things<br/>
&gt; like note taking and writing essays<br/>
&gt; for exams, but she&#39;s doing really well -<br/>
&gt; really happy with the classes and<br/>
&gt; learning a LOT and, as it turns out,<br/>
&gt; getting good grades too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My 11 yo has a friend who is in a public<br/>
&gt; school homeschooling program. She<br/>
&gt; has to turn in work samples every month. So<br/>
&gt; Rosie (my 11 yo) was spending the<br/>
&gt; night at her friend&#39;s house and her friend<br/>
&gt; had to do a bunch of workbook<br/>
&gt; stuff so she&#39;d have some work samples to<br/>
&gt; turn in. They decided to play school<br/>
&gt; - and Rosie did the worksheets too. It was<br/>
&gt; pretty dismal. The other mom was<br/>
&gt; the &quot;teacher&quot; and she marked wrong all the<br/>
&gt; math questions and spelling words<br/>
&gt; that Rosie missed. There were a LOT of<br/>
&gt; them. I was kind of annoyed by the<br/>
&gt; whole thing - because I didn&#39;t want Rosie<br/>
&gt; getting the feeling she&#39;s &quot;behind&quot;<br/>
&gt; or something. I&#39;m not worried about her -<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s fine - she knows a LOT of<br/>
&gt; stuff and can simply THINK way more clearly<br/>
&gt; than the other girl - even if she<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t spell &lt;G&gt;. The time the other girl<br/>
&gt; has spent doing worksheets, Rosie<br/>
&gt; has spent on things she&#39;s INTERESTED in.<br/>
&gt; So, for example, the worksheets<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t &quot;test&quot; knowledge of the geography of<br/>
&gt; the world - it isn&#39;t part of the<br/>
&gt; 5th grade curriculum &lt;G&gt;. But Rosie knows a<br/>
&gt; LOT about world geography - more<br/>
&gt; than many adults, probably. Why? Because<br/>
&gt; she LOVES soccer and follows<br/>
&gt; international soccer - follows teams from<br/>
&gt; Europe and South America, mostly,<br/>
&gt; but also is very very aware of other<br/>
&gt; countries because of the World Cup<br/>
&gt; qualifying rounds going on all over the<br/>
&gt; world right now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - she knows interesting information<br/>
&gt; about lots of countries in the world,<br/>
&gt; but didn&#39;t know how to multiply multiple<br/>
&gt; digit decimal numbers. It hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; come up. Big deal - she can learn that in<br/>
&gt; minutes - and will, I&#39;m sure, one<br/>
&gt; of these days, because it&#39;ll come up and<br/>
&gt; she&#39;ll want to.<br/>

<br/>
I see this happening at my house.  My kids are just learning with no <br/>
rhyme or reason but I know they are learning.  The problem I am <br/>
having is with the *thought* that they could learn more by having a <br/>
little focused learning.  They would still learn from life but in <br/>
addition they would focus on a small amount of information such as <br/>
what you might get out of a course on something.  This focus would <br/>
help introduce them to more things they might enjoy knowing about <br/>
than we are being exposed to now.<br/>
<br/>
An example of this is when we were doing school-at-home we studied <br/>
ancient history.  To do this we went to museums, watched the history <br/>
channel when ever something came on about ancient history, got books <br/>
out of the library etc.  My kids would some day like to visit Egypt <br/>
because of our focus on ancient history.  They pretended they were <br/>
archeologists and paleontologists because of this exposure to ancient <br/>
history.  That might not have happened if it were just left up to <br/>
chance.<br/>
<br/>
It is not that I am worried about gaps or specific information. I am <br/>
concerned that there is a lot of lost opportunity for learning.  <br/>
Learning that would ultimately be enriching and of course very <br/>
enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
There is always the possibility that we would have overlooked <br/>
something while we were focused on ancient history that may have been <br/>
more enjoyable however, looking at the small amount we are doing now, <br/>
it is hard to imagine that we wouldn&#39;t have had time for ancient <br/>
history in addition to what we are doing now.<br/>
<br/>
We go places, we talk about a lot of things, they watch movies and <br/>
tv, spend a lot of time on the computer (playing games and looking <br/>
stuff up), they play sports and do occasional projects, we play board <br/>
games.  The problem as I see it is there is no focus and therefore <br/>
lost opportunities.    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Every minute is just one minute &lt;G&gt;. If you spend it studying ancient <br/>
history, then there is something else you&#39;re not doing. There is ALWAYS an <br/>
opportunity cost to every decision.<br/>
<br/>
So if you decide to have the kids do just a little of something formal - then <br/>
that means there is just that same little bit of time they aren&#39;t doing what <br/>
else they would have done during that time. It is always going to be a <br/>
tradeoff. Heck, its a trade-off when I ask my kids to unload the dishwasher <br/>
or set the table or pick up their clothes, too. The question for unschoolers <br/>
is what are the benefits of insisting the kids do just a bit of studying a <br/>
subject of the parents&#39; choosing versus the costs. <br/>
<br/>
The benefits - I guess - are like this last post said - the kids learned <br/>
something that they would maybe not have gotten interested in and now they <br/>
ARE interested.<br/>
<br/>
The costs? I&#39;ll toss that one out to the rest of the list - we&#39;ll probably <br/>
have a lengthy list of costs. <br/>
<br/>
Number one, for me, is that it is unnecessary. Parents can &quot;offer&quot; stuff and <br/>
parents can &quot;learn&quot; about stuff and share what they are learning with their <br/>
kids and be excited about something and draw the kids into it, too, and the <br/>
kids can often be attracted/enticed to something that the parents want them <br/>
to learn about. If not, then they aren&#39;t likely to get all that much out of <br/>
it if the parents insist on it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So if I think, &quot;Gee, my daughter ought to learn some American history,&quot; and <br/>
&quot;Wow - here is a really great history series (say, History of Us by Joy <br/>
Hakim)&quot; then I can certainly offer it to her in a way that seems to me to be <br/>
most likely to catch her interest. (Often I&#39;ll say, &quot;Here - let me read you <br/>
some of this - it is very cool.&quot;) If she likes it - we&#39;ll go on. If, at some <br/>
point, she says, &quot;Mom, this is boring,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m just not interested in this&quot; <br/>
or whatever, then it&#39;ll get put aside. Or I might say, &quot;Okay - hey - how <br/>
about I read it to you at bedtime instead?&quot; Because just maybe she does like <br/>
it but doesn&#39;t like it to take up precious daytime hours. Who knows? MAYBE <br/>
she just isn&#39;t going to be interested - that is something I have to judge as <br/>
her parent - when to just let go of something that I MYSELF thought was going <br/>
to be cool.<br/>

she called me -- found a mentor/teacher -- to learn more.  All of that was<br/>
interest-driven, non-coercive, and learner-initiated.<br/>

now? Is it because the kids are not interested in ancient history? You can&#39;t <br/>
get them interested? Then, there ya go, they&#39;re just not interested and if <br/>
you insist on it, what lessons ARE they going to learn from that? <br/>
<br/>
We went to a Viking exhibit at a local museum because Roxana wanted to go - <br/>
Rosie and I went through it in about an hour and Roxana wanted to spend a lot <br/>
more time. So we left her there and went and did some other stuff and came <br/>
back. Rosie and I weren&#39;t all THAT interested in the Vikings, but Roxana <br/>
already had an interest, having spent a lot of time reading Norse mythology, <br/>
having a Norwegian online buddy, and having spent the last six months <br/>
studying Norwegian. Rosie and I spent some time looking at fossils of <br/>
prehistoric horses - SHE is interested in horses - takes riding lessons and <br/>
reads everything she can get her hands on about horses - from magazines to a <br/>
series of books (SaddleClub).  A few weeks later we went to the La Brea Tar <br/>
Pits -- and learned MORE about horses -- there were horses trapped in the tar <br/>
pits 10 to 40 thousand years ago. In the process of following the kids&#39; <br/>
interests - we picked up a lot of other info - about Mammoths and the early <br/>
inhabitants of our area and so on. We didn&#39;t have to study ancient history -- <br/>
it just happened along the way of having a good time. <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that maybe some people don&#39;t live in places where they can <br/>
visit different museums. Or maybe their kids don&#39;t like museums? But that <br/>
just means they do other things - watch movies, listen to music, read, play <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The reason is because there is no focus to our day.  It just goes by <br/>
and very little gets done.  My kids don&#39;t get up until 10:00 then <br/>
they lounge around and do stuff on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked them at least to try some type of morning routine which <br/>
includes them eating breakfast(sometimes), washing up and taking care <br/>
of their animals.  I generally have to remind them to finish.  So <br/>
usually around noon they are ready for the day.<br/>
<br/>
Then it is lunch time so we have lunch.  I ask them what they want to <br/>
do for the day and try to suggest something interesting if they don&#39;t <br/>
know.  If we were schooling, we would have something planned and we <br/>
would at least do that.<br/>
<br/>
They are easily distracted and jump on the computer for a game or two <br/>
or take some time to pick at each other and fight so what they said <br/>
they wanted to do probably won&#39;t get done.  At 3:00 their ps friends <br/>
come home so they go out and play or get back on the computer for <br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
At night they watch tv which they never used to do.  They often fall <br/>
asleep watching tv instead of reading which they used to enjoy.  <br/>
Sometimes I read to them if they will stop what they are doing by <br/>
10:00 otherwise I am too tired.<br/>
<br/>
This is all so hard for me because I am a focused, organized person.  <br/>
I can&#39;t even be happy with my life because their lives prevent me <br/>
from being focused and organized in my life. I don&#39;t know if that <br/>
makes sense or not.  Anyway it is tough for me to feel so much <br/>
responsibility for their learning and so little control.  <br/>
<br/>
Basicly, they learn through conversation.  I answer their questions <br/>
or look it up if I don&#39;t know.  I show them what I find.  It seems <br/>
like so little.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it because the kids are not interested in ancient history? You <br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get them interested? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They really seem to be interested in everything.  They just don&#39;t <br/>
want to be focused in their quest to learn.  Virginia said she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to feel like she *has* to do anything.  I don&#39;t want her <br/>
to feel like she has to do anything she doesn&#39;t want to do but I <br/>
think she should feel like she should do it now instead of when ever.<br/>
<br/>
It feels as if we are on vacation somewhere and spend most of our <br/>
time in the hotel room.  What a waste!<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411364230">Gen out of the house. Use humor and a light tone to encourage them.<br/>
Say:<br/>
Would you rather go to the aquarium or the history museum today?<br/>
There&#39;s a new film at the IMAX theater about Dinosaurs and it&#39;s 3-D, Do you<br/>
guys want to go before lunch or after?<br/>
I have to run some errands, do you guys want to stop and see a movie<br/>
afterwards or just come home?<br/>
Read the newspaper everyday. Not necessarily the articles, but the ads.<br/>
Hey! The library is having a class on making marionettes. I really want to<br/>
see that, you guys can hang out with me or just wander the stacks if you<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are &quot;allowed&quot; to plan things! They are also &quot;allowed&quot; to have a<br/>
structured day (some call it routines) I have to structure myself in order<br/>
to feel comfortable. I make breakfast for whoever is around when I get up,<br/>
make my coffee, check my email, empty the DW, read the paper, make my bed<br/>
and then get dressed. The rest of the am is free for whatever. My evenings<br/>
are also &quot;structured&quot;. I make dinner, have relaxed time, pick up a little,<br/>
make coffee for Joe in the AM if I remember, check what I do tomorrow.<br/>
Routines are all around us.<br/>
Anyway, back to the topic.<br/>
As the kids learn that they are free, they may need some help seeing what<br/>
there is out there. They aren&#39;t going to magically find friends and play<br/>
with them unless *I* connect with the other HSing moms with kids, and then<br/>
*I* drive them there. They aren&#39;t going to just do stuff they haven&#39;t even<br/>
thought of yet! Point things out, keep their interests in mind so that you<br/>
can show them when something related is going on. Go for a walk everyday and<br/>
ask them to come along.<br/>
They may be doing more than you think. Don&#39;t discount the value of &quot;doing<br/>
nothing&quot;<br/>

<br/>
But human interaction is what it all comes down to really. How many kids <br/>
have that benefit of a caring adult who is truly willing to listen to them <br/>
and answer their questions? Not many from what I&#39;ve seen. It may feel like <br/>
more if you also go into their world a little more. Share some tv shows, let <br/>
them teach *you* a video game. You&#39;d be amazed at the conversations that <br/>
come up during those times.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;They really seem to be interested in everything.  They just don&#39;t<br/>

to feel like she has to do anything she doesn&#39;t want to do but I<br/>
think she should feel like she should do it now instead of when ever.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you really can&#39;t control what she feels, or how she learns. Schools have <br/>
us believing that learning comes in neat little packages like chapters or <br/>
unit studies or courses or grade levels. It works to help keep the schools <br/>
operating, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best way to learn. And for some people <br/>
that *learn it all now* approach can be disastrous. It can turn off their <br/>
natural curiosity and questioning.<br/>
<br/>
True learning comes in all the connections we make. It&#39;s about how we make <br/>
sense of the world. It&#39;s about seeing how the past ties in with the present <br/>
ties in with the future. It&#39;s understanding the impact that one statement <br/>
made 100 years ago can have on present day society. It&#39;s flipping numbers <br/>
around because we need the result it will bring. It&#39;s about being in the <br/>
world today and learning what we need for today. Over the course of a life <br/>
(or even 18 years, when a schooled kid would graduate) that&#39;s a lot of <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It feels as if we are on vacation somewhere and spend most of our<br/>

<br/>
Why not try actually making it like a vacation? Get some guide books for <br/>
your area and hit the hot spots. Don&#39;t try to make them educational, try to <br/>
make them cool, eye catching and fun. Talk and giggle and take one of their <br/>
friends if they prefer. Answer questions, point out cool stuff, and back off <br/>
on expecting it to look like anything. The learning will flow.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and be sure to buy some cheap souvenir trinkets along the way. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
