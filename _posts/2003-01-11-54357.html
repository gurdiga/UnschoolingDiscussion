<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am currently recovering from a ruptured appendix and subsequent emergency<br/>
&gt; appendectomy so this is very timely. I actually went to the ER 3 times with<br/>
&gt; abdominal pain and a fever and was SENT HOME. By some chance the appendix<br/>
&gt; actually burst on my third visit which landed me in surgery. Am anticipating<br/>
&gt; separate $50 co-pays for each ER visit. :(<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Make a complaint (in person!) to the Patient Representative at the hospital.<br/>
Present your bills for the 3 seperate co-pays.  Tell them that you are happy<br/>
to pay for the 3rd one, since that&#39;s the time that you got the care you<br/>
needed.  Ask them to waive the $100 that will remain on your account after<br/>
insurance pays, since it&#39;s the hospital&#39;s fault that your issue was not<br/>
properly diagnosed on the first visit.  Imply that if they do waive that<br/>
$100, you will cheerily go on your way and not press the issue.  If the<br/>
first person you talk to can&#39;t help you, work your way up the chain.<br/>
Somewhere there will likely be someone who sees the light and realizes that<br/>
you might have a really valid complaint about misdiagnosis and $100 is a<br/>
pretty small amount to write off to make you go away.<br/>
