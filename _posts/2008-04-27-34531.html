<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259915515">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading on this list for about 2 months, and I am finally<br/>
getting around to introducing myself, and posing a question.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to unschooling in my own family, but not new to the concepts,<br/>
having several of my closest friends who have unschooled since day 1.  <br/>
<br/>
My son is 9.5 and was in alternative school settings until recently (a<br/>
&quot;democratic&quot; charter school, and then a &quot;free&quot;school.)  he finally led<br/>
the way toward the switch to unschooling with his adamance that he was<br/>
never going back to school! i am grateful to him for his strong<br/>
personality!  <br/>
<br/>
I do have an older daughter (13) who *is* in school, and loves it, and<br/>
has no desire to leave school, so our lives are complicated, to say<br/>
the least. <br/>
<br/>
my question is about how to talk with my son about unschooling.  he is<br/>
not really aware of the concept, although is aware of &quot;home schooling&quot;<br/>
and seems really conflicted, in his  own mind, about how things are<br/>
&quot;working out.&quot;  he has a tendency to be very negative about his own<br/>
&quot;follow through&quot;  and is in a phase right  now of pining for something<br/>
he is passionate about, but not being able to figure out what that is,<br/>
and feeling frustrated with himself about that.  so he is now applying<br/>
that frustration/disappointment with *himself* to &quot;home schooling&quot; -<br/>
saying things like &quot;it seems so right for me, but it just isn&#39;t<br/>
working - i don&#39;t know what to LEARN&quot; and before that &quot;when are we<br/>
going to START home schooling - we really need to start!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
but when i respond with &quot;what did you have in mind?&quot; and &quot;lots of kids<br/>
learn all the time just from doing interesting things in life, i am<br/>
not worried about you needing specific lessons in anything, until and<br/>
unless you have a specific question or interest in something - then we<br/>
can learn all about it&quot; - he doesn&#39;t seem satisfied, and seems a bit<br/>
fixated on the need to have tangible learning.  so i have offered to<br/>
&quot;do some math&quot; or anything else he&#39;d like with him, but he declines.<br/>
<br/>
i am not really asking how to go about unschooling - more  - how do<br/>
others talk about the concepts with their kids, especially kids who<br/>
*have* been in school, (and maybe have a sibling in school- even<br/>
college...) and therefore have this contrast to grapple with.  i will<br/>
say he is a kid who is *constantly* asking questions, absorbing ideas,<br/>
etc.  but he just doesn&#39;t see that as learning...i look forward to<br/>
hearing how other kids have moved through this process.<br/>
<br/>
warmly, Lyla</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547723299">It seems to me that part of the solution might be found in deschooling.  It will take some <br/>
time, even coming from a free school (and taking into account the fact that his sister is <br/>
still in school) to move away from the thinking of how learning needs to look.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s asking about unschooling, then having him read about it is a great idea, but if he&#39;s <br/>
not, then just concentrating on looking for the activities that he&#39;s excited about and filling <br/>
his days with interesting stuff will start to fill him with new energy.  In other words, just <br/>
doing it.  As he starts to really just live his life, one of two things may happen:  1.  He will<br/>
start focusing on other stuff and stop worrying about the nuts and bolts, or 2.  He will <br/>
start to have his own experiences with unschooling--making connections, delving deeply <br/>
into an interest that may lead to another interest, meeting people interested in the stuff <br/>
he is and having great conversations about his interests, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
In other words, even if the worries are still there he will be living his life, and eventually <br/>
the connections can be made and the worries replaced.  At this point, with things so new, <br/>
he has no experiences to back up your confidence, and having him read a bunch of theory <br/>
may not help, because he&#39;s still operating at a concrete level where actions speak louder <br/>
than words.  I suspect his worries may stem from having it not really work out for him at <br/>
the free school.  Maybe his rhythm of learning really didn&#39;t fit there, but at home, you&#39;ll be <br/>
able to really support him.  A free school--as great as some people find them--still <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a deeply connected parent partner.  I&#39;m just guessing here, but maybe it&#39;s too <br/>
overwhelming to some younger children to be put in a situation, without parents, where <br/>
self-sufficiency or self-motivation is expected and they don&#39;t feel ready for it.  Maybe you <br/>
guys need to deschool others&#39; expectations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740622832">yes, thanks for the reminder.  i think deschooling is a big part of<br/>
it, as are all the other factors you mentioned.  things change so<br/>
rapidly around here, that i fully imagine that he will be in a<br/>
different place each day, week, month, in terms of his concerns,<br/>
expectations, etc. of *himself*.  <br/>
<br/>
i was just curious what others had experienced with previously<br/>
schooled kids, when you began unschooling, regarding the actual<br/>
discussion of the approach of unschooling with them, vs just *doing*<br/>
it.  it seems in some ways that discussing it at all normalizes<br/>
school, to some degree, and keeps things in that paradigm.  but<br/>
perhaps in this culture of school, *not* discussing the paradigm shift<br/>
also maintains the &quot;dominant paradigm.&quot; just grappling with those<br/>
questions, and wondering what others may have noticed with slightly<br/>
older kids who have the experience of school as being something that&#39;s<br/>
&quot;done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
thanks again for the reminders about deschooling, though - very<br/>
pertinent, for sure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165130833">ok, thanks, glad to hear it - that is pretty much how everything goes around here, generally, so it  makes sense that approach to education wouldn&#39;t be any different!  i imagine it would depend a lot on the child too - if it had been my daughter, i think she would have been very interested in the &quot;philosophy&quot; end of it and would have wanted/needed to understand the nuts and bolts of the &quot;plan.&quot;  i always have to remind myself that my son doesn&#39;t require or WANT the words words words about everything.  but i think sometimes he needs a few, for reassurance, to disrupt any &quot;negative&quot; words within his own mind and plant seeds or optimism/opportunity...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646901820">We¹re just a couple months in, but moving from schooling at home to<br/>
unschooling did require some conversation ­ as in, why aren¹t you making us<br/>
do our schoolwork?  So we talked about the different ways they learn, how<br/>
much they already know and how much of it came from schoolwork vs. life.  It<br/>
helps that I was homeschooled, and was left alone educationally after about<br/>
12.  I did not do¹ jr. high or high school, just went to college.  It makes<br/>
it easier for me (and my husband) that my kids are 8 and 13 and already know<br/>
the basics¹.  Not that I¹m glad it happened that way but it does make it an<br/>
easier argument.  Fortunately, they still love learning other than my 13<br/>
y.o. did develop a dislike of math that will hopefully dissipate! Poor guy<br/>
was pushing (being pushed) through algebra when I suddenly realized, why the<br/>
hell does a 13 year old need to know algebra?  I learned it in college, and<br/>
only used it because I taught it for several years.<br/>
<br/>
The kids acted like it was Christmas when they heard they wouldn¹t have to<br/>
do schoolwork and have remained very happy and satisfied with that choice.<br/>
We are definitely still in the deschooling process.  My 8 year old, having<br/>
experienced far less school than my 13 year old, is much farther along.  My<br/>
13 year old, although he loves to read and reads tons of fiction and<br/>
non-fiction, as well as being online, playing lots of games, etc., he seems<br/>
to still be suspicious of things that I offer sometimes, assuming I am<br/>
trying to trick him into doing schoolwork somehow lol.  I try to really make<br/>
sure things I offer him right now are very lighthearted, such as getting the<br/>
Garfield comics he likes from the library and nothing else (for him).  My 8<br/>
y.o. loves it when I bring him books/videos on science (his passion), but my<br/>
13 yo would view it with suspicion still.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I have noticed the biggest changes in the demeanor of the<br/>
13 yo, a definite lightness and joy that were dissipating a few short months<br/>
ago.  I was actually starting to worry about depression; it runs in the<br/>
family!  But by releasing my last vestiges of control (I really didn¹t think<br/>
I had many, we were quite the laid back family anyway!) I can see that he is<br/>
as peaceful and satisfied as anybody could hope to be!  It is so strange<br/>
that merely dropping two hours worth of schoolwork creates such a difference<br/>
in how he feels he can spend his time.  Before, he would sleep in and stay<br/>
in bed as long as possible, and then drag the schoolwork out until<br/>
afternoon.  When it was finally over with, he would spend as much time as<br/>
possible playing games, and not want to go anywhere that would cut into his<br/>
game time.  Now he gets up quite a bit earlier, plays as soon as he feels<br/>
like it, reads when he feels like it, watches tv when he feels like it, and<br/>
has picked up the guitar.<br/>
<br/>
I never expected him to play an instrument because, although we are a<br/>
musical family and I thought he would be good at it, I figured he would<br/>
never be interested in putting in the time that it takes.  In January we<br/>
found a music teacher that came weekly for lessons (drums for one, guitar<br/>
for one and bass for one).  The kids wanted the lessons.  I did not make<br/>
them practice, and they didn¹t practice much at all.  Suddenly, when the<br/>
schoolwork stopped, my 13 yo (who had been having bass lessons) picked up<br/>
the guitar and started playing it, sometimes for hours every day!  This has<br/>
continued for about 4 weeks now and he is becoming quite good.  He plays a<br/>
lot of the songs they know from Guitar Hero and Rock Band ­ on a whole<br/>
nother topic, it¹s amazing the interest in music those games have sparked<br/>
around here.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the looooong response, but in answer to your question about<br/>
experience with previously schooled kids... Living in a world where school<br/>
is the default for kids, and especially having one still in school (which I<br/>
do too!) I think it is important to talk about the choices you are making,<br/>
and especially about why they are the best choices.  I think it can seem to<br/>
kids like you just don¹t care or are too involved with other things if you<br/>
just don¹t have them do any schoolwork without discussing it.  I know that¹s<br/>
how I felt about my parents (though it was probably true in that case; I<br/>
don¹t think they were consciously unschooling).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383300123">yes, that makes sense, thanks.  i think we may be fortunate in this regard, in that, because he went to quite &quot;alternative&quot; schools, school &quot;work&quot; was never a big thing on his radar.  it was the attendance, primarily, and the groups and classes he participated in *in* school, the absence of which make the biggest impact - but no home work to speak of...  and actually, at the free school, he didn&#39;t *participate* in any groups or classes, so the transition may have been eased into by that experience, however he was at the charter school for 3.5 years, and only at the free school for 2 months, so perhaps not long enough to make much of an imperssion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238112246">I&#39;m really grateful that this topic has been posted and so well put. <br/>
I&#39;ve been struggling a bit lately with my 10 y.o. son who was in public<br/>
school until January of this year.  At first I did try assignments and<br/>
worksheets and reviews and such.  And it was a constant, constant<br/>
battle.  I realized I was just continuing at home what he&#39;d been doing<br/>
at school and that was defeating the purpose of pulling him out of<br/>
school in the first place.  He is not an &quot;inside the box&quot; thinker (me<br/>
either).  So, we decided to experiment, if you will, with unschooling<br/>
for a while.  I first had to understand what it was, and I had it<br/>
confused with deschooling.  I understand the difference now, but still<br/>
think he and I need a bit more deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We are learning that we can learn on our own without someone else&#39;s<br/>
structure or schedule on what they think we should know and by when. <br/>
And by &quot;we&quot; I mean me as well.  I have forgotten so much of what was<br/>
crammed into my head years ago - I explained it to Blake as a pump and<br/>
dump method: pumping your memory full of the information on an upcoming<br/>
test and then dumping it after the test was over.  The things that stick<br/>
are the things we WANT to learn, want to know about and want to<br/>
remember.  He gets that.  He couldn&#39;t care less right now about naming<br/>
the parts of a sentence, yet he  has perfect sentence structure (due to<br/>
reading and not being talked down to at home, I&#39;m sure).  He hates to<br/>
try to sit and do multiplication (so I found out very early on) but can<br/>
calculate in his mind how much money he needs to save for whatever it is<br/>
he is wanting and how long it will take to save it.<br/>
<br/>
We did finally &quot;get&quot; that when an interest pops up in something and we<br/>
don&#39;t know all of the components, we can research and learn it then. <br/>
Things begin to roll and click and that&#39;s so fascinating to see.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t know how to combat boredom for him - dealing with that<br/>
right now.  Maybe it&#39;s spring fever?  But he is very clear that he&#39;d<br/>
rather be bored at home than bored at school.  At least here he can<br/>
actively look for something else to do instead of sitting at a desk<br/>
miserable out of his mind.<br/>

It&#39;s ok to be bored.  Being bored means you look around for what may interest you!   Not that it&#39;s a pleasant part of life but it creeps in now and then.  Just keep following his lead as well as looking around for fun and interesting activities, classes, etc, bearing in mind that these should be interesting to HIM.  Congratulations on getting him out of school and being so daring and open to unschooling--it&#39;s fabulous!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also suggest that kids who have been in school are used to having their day planned FOR them and so they aren&#39;t really sure what to do with so much free time.  He probably just needs to get used to the new way of things--and his freedom!<br/>

  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: introduction and a question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m really grateful that this topic has been posted and so well put. <br/>
  I&#39;ve been struggling a bit lately with my 10 y.o. son who was in public<br/>
  school until January of this year. At first I did try assignments and<br/>
  worksheets and reviews and such. And it was a constant, constant<br/>
  battle. I realized I was just continuing at home what he&#39;d been doing<br/>
  at school and that was defeating the purpose of pulling him out of<br/>
  school in the first place. He is not an &quot;inside the box&quot; thinker (me<br/>
  either). So, we decided to experiment, if you will, with unschooling<br/>
  for a while. I first had to understand what it was, and I had it<br/>
  confused with deschooling. I understand the difference now, but still<br/>
  think he and I need a bit more deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  We are learning that we can learn on our own without someone else&#39;s<br/>
  structure or schedule on what they think we should know and by when. <br/>
  And by &quot;we&quot; I mean me as well. I have forgotten so much of what was<br/>
  crammed into my head years ago - I explained it to Blake as a pump and<br/>
  dump method: pumping your memory full of the information on an upcoming<br/>
  test and then dumping it after the test was over. The things that stick<br/>
  are the things we WANT to learn, want to know about and want to<br/>
  remember. He gets that. He couldn&#39;t care less right now about naming<br/>
  the parts of a sentence, yet he has perfect sentence structure (due to<br/>
  reading and not being talked down to at home, I&#39;m sure). He hates to<br/>
  try to sit and do multiplication (so I found out very early on) but can<br/>
  calculate in his mind how much money he needs to save for whatever it is<br/>
  he is wanting and how long it will take to save it.<br/>
<br/>
  We did finally &quot;get&quot; that when an interest pops up in something and we<br/>
  don&#39;t know all of the components, we can research and learn it then. <br/>
  Things begin to roll and click and that&#39;s so fascinating to see.<br/>
<br/>
  However, I don&#39;t know how to combat boredom for him - dealing with that<br/>
  right now. Maybe it&#39;s spring fever? But he is very clear that he&#39;d<br/>
  rather be bored at home than bored at school. At least here he can<br/>
  actively look for something else to do instead of sitting at a desk<br/>
  miserable out of his mind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the more than five years since my son quit school, he and I have<br/>
never had a conversation about what unschooling is or isn&#39;t. I never<br/>
use the term in my offline world. We just live our lives and learn<br/>
stuff. And, because I&#39;m rather obsessive about self-education myself,<br/>
there&#39;s an awareness of &#39;educational&#39; stuff in the household all the<br/>
time, but without it necessarily being talked about as &#39;educational&#39;<br/>
stuff. In that respect, probably the most well-worn topics of<br/>
conversation are, &quot;I&#39;ll google that.&quot; and &quot;Where did you learn that?<br/>
No, wait. Let me guess. From a cartoon?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Apart from one time a couple of years ago when she thought he might be<br/>
interested in taking a second look at school (a different school to<br/>
the one he went to), and took him along to the school&#39;s Open Day, my<br/>
son&#39;s ten years older always schooled sister has simply got on with<br/>
her own life. When she was at home (she moved out about two years ago<br/>
to share a house with some fellow students), that was a fascinating<br/>
juxtaposition of lifestyles. My daughter working on university<br/>
assignments, my son playing videogames. Actually, my daughter has been<br/>
rather wonderful about all that considering her own almost 18 years<br/>
in total of formal education. She&#39;s followed her own chosen path and<br/>
worked on achieving her goals and seems to have appreciated that what<br/>
was right for her wasn&#39;t necessarily right for her brother.<br/>
<br/>
Now that my daughter has graduated from university this year, it&#39;s the<br/>
first time both of my children have been &#39;out of school&#39;. Which is<br/>
kind of like the beginning of a new era.<br/>

of his life.  Seriously.  Schools are in the business of making  <br/>
people hate libraries.  Don&#39;t help them.<br/>

On the other hand, the usefulness of a library is waning because of  <br/>
the internet.  That&#39;s okay.  Don&#39;t worship the library or the books.   <br/>

<br/>
I never expected him to play an instrument because, although we are a<br/>
musical family and I thought he would be good at it, I figured he would<br/>
never be interested in putting in the time that it takes. In January we<br/>
found a music teacher that came weekly for lessons (drums for one,  <br/>
guitar<br/>
for one and bass for one). The kids wanted the lessons. I did not make<br/>
them practice, and they didn¹t practice much at all. Suddenly, when the<br/>
schoolwork stopped, my 13 yo (who had been having bass lessons)  <br/>
picked up<br/>
the guitar and started playing it, sometimes for hours every day!  <br/>
This has<br/>
continued for about 4 weeks now and he is becoming quite good. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If he quits the lessons, let that slide quietly by.  He might not  <br/>
need them anymore.  Once he understands how to tune it and hold it  <br/>
and has some technique, he cal learn the rest on his own.  He  <br/>
could&#39;ve learned that on his own, too, but he is where he is right  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902953870">Darn, I was so hoping to be a candidate for the getting it¹ page... Should<br/>
have known I wasn¹t even close yet.  There I go comparing and leveling again<br/>
lol.  I definitely have deschooling to do...<br/>
<br/>
There¹s not much chance of library hating around here.  I read a lot, plus<br/>
check out a lot of movies and cds, so I go quite often.  They usually want<br/>
to go, and if they don¹t, they don¹t... they can stay home.  Yesterday they<br/>
came with me, and the 8 yo got a movie and the 13 yo got a few books, one of<br/>
which he¹s been reading since we got home (he¹s almost done).  If they<br/>
didn¹t want to get anything, no big deal.  If they don¹t come with me and I<br/>
happen to see something they might like I get it... Do you think I should<br/>
avoid that?  That seems counterintuitive.  Or should I just make sure I<br/>
don¹t have an agenda?  They do love reading, as well as computers, tv, video<br/>
games, etc. (none of which have been limited in their lives, and they have<br/>
every system and game their hearts have ever desired lol).<br/>
<br/>
As for the guitar, I totally agree.  I know the lessons he had in bass did<br/>
not teach him how to play the things he plays on the guitar... At the moment<br/>
the lessons are on hold anyway because of the teacher¹s schedule.  I learned<br/>
the piano quite well (well enough for a short-lived band and quite a few<br/>
years of church playing anyway) when I was growing up by getting some books<br/>
and a little support from my dad when I asked.  My older brother, who was<br/>
forced into piano lessons at 5 or 6 and then quit, never did pick up an<br/>
instrument.<br/>

You can&#39;t measure deschooling that way.   You need as much more as  <br/>
you need.  The mom needs enough more that she stops measuring and  <br/>
counting.  The child needs enough more that he forgets to think about  <br/>
whether something &quot;is educational&quot; or not before he looks at it, into  <br/>
it, involves himself in it.<br/>

We&#39;re getting some garble.  Thanks.<br/>

-=-Do you think I should<br/>
avoid that? That seems counterintuitive. Or should I just make sure I<br/>
don¹t have an agenda? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Be aware of your agenda.  You can&#39;t make sure you don&#39;t have thoughts  <br/>
and intentions.  That would be bad. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A good way to figure out what to do is to see if you know what you  <br/>
would do if it were a friend staying with you for a week or two, or  <br/>
your husband.  Would you bring that library book?  If so, do it.  If  <br/>
not... you&#39;re treating your child differently than you&#39;d treat &quot;a  <br/>
person.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129806271">I realize, from time to time, that this is far more true than not -- I<br/>
definitely have to remind myself to stop measuring and counting.  I know<br/>
this, KNOW it, but sometimes it seems to slip from my mind.  Weird... <br/>
Then he and I will do something together and we will both realize that<br/>
we just did something scientific/historic/mathematic/social without even<br/>
realizing it at the time.  THAT is when it re-hits me that what we are<br/>
doing is wonderful and beneficial and we don&#39;t need to be lead around by<br/>
the brain by systematic teaching.  Thanks for the reminder and keep<br/>
those coming!<br/>

&gt; You can&#39;t measure deschooling that way. You need as much more as<br/>
&gt; you need. The mom needs enough more that she stops measuring and<br/>
&gt; counting. The child needs enough more that he forgets to think about<br/>
&gt; whether something &quot;is educational&quot; or not before he looks at it, into<br/>
&gt; it, involves himself in it.<br/>
