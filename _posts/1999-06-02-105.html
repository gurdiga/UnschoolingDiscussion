&lt;&lt; So, in Washington, where we have to have our children tested or assessed<br/>
 once a year, what do you do with yours? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well the first year we homeschooled, I didn&#39;t do any testing or assessing.  I <br/>
felt that the first year was our deschooling year (course didn&#39;t feel that <br/>
way at begining of year).  We are just finishing up our second year.  My 11 <br/>
year old, will take her testing next week.  She was in public school through <br/>
4th grade; so she is use to that kind of test.  As you know in WA state, we <br/>
are required to test but don&#39;t have to show it to anyone.  So the testing <br/>
will be used by me to see how she is doing.  I&#39;m kinda wishy washy on <br/>
testing...but she is gearing up towards getting more acedemic in her studies <br/>
and has a strong desire to keep more records for college.  So this is yet <br/>
antoher thing to put in her records.  To be honest, I am not worried about <br/>
her at all.....she has always been ahead and loves to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Now with my 7 year old, he has never been in school.  He is still &quot;underage&quot; <br/>
of testing requirement.  I have a feeling when he is of age, I will go more <br/>
of a assesment route for him till he older.<br/>
<br/>
Course this is how I feel this year. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
does this answer your questions?<br/>
