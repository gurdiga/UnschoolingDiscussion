<div id="ygrps-yiv-515549371">PLEASE forgive me for bringing this up again. But I just HAVE to say it. Yoki <br/>
(hi Yoki) has come to this list saying that she schools at home. No one has <br/>
jumped on her, told her to just do it, been short or impatient with her, etc. <br/>
Everyone has talked and explained to her, right to the point but very <br/>
respectfully, the ways of unschooling. She hasn&#39;t had to feel like she&#39;s <br/>
needed to be defensive, and therefore (IMO), she&#39;s been receiving and <br/>
understanding the info. She&#39;s only been here a few day&#39;s, and yet, even <br/>
though she&#39;s been talked to *nicely*, she&#39;s still getting it, and fast. Just <br/>
an observation, I&#39;m NOT starting anything.   Lara..........</div>
