<p><br><br>Kerry, I loved your rubber-stamp greeting card idea. I used to make gift wrap with rubber stamps that I carved myself from small erasers using an x-acto knife. This was way before I had kids. Do you make the stamps yourself? Do you use one per card or many? Have you ever tried linoleum block printing? It&#39;s similar -- I made a nice greeting card that way once. </p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042756403">No, I never used the linoleum technique, but have seen<br/>
it done at convention. I dont make my own stamps. I<br/>
buy the sheets of unmounteds at conventions and mount<br/>
them myself. DH is a carpenter, so wood aplenty. You<br/>
do have to be careful selling stuff, as some stamp<br/>
companies dont allow resale with their images. &quot;Angel&quot;<br/>
companies mean that they allow it. Most do not,<br/>
though, and if you&#39;re caught, they will sue you quick.<br/>
