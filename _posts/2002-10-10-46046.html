<br/>
<br/>
I know I could get so long winded on this one and when I read everyone <br/>
else&#39;s, I&#39;ll be going &quot;Oh yeah, that too!!!&quot; I&#39;ll try to be plain and <br/>
simple, which will be a first.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling to me is the freedom to go at one&#39;s own pace, no matter how slow <br/>
or fast that may be according to someone else. No matter what one choses to <br/>
busy themselves with if anything at all. To find one&#39;s own way, no matter <br/>
where, when, how and why, as long as one is happy and respectful that others <br/>
have that same freedom as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735445874">Finish this sentence - To me, unschooling is...  giving my children the same freedom I have to live life however they want to. It&#39;s the freedom to learn whatever you want, whenever you want. It&#39;s the freedom to grow into the kind of person you were meant to be, without outside pressures to be, act, think, talk, and do any particular thing. It&#39;s just life as it was meant to be.<br/>

up in search of dinosaur bones cause someone in a town close by found some in <br/>
their back alley, listening to the music in the rain, spending way too much <br/>
time on the computer with you guys, looking for fairies at dusk, spending the <br/>
day cutting and gluing and listening to Mom&#39;s old albums (Mom explaining <br/>
about 45&#39;s to disbelieving kids), going to the store and sitting down in the <br/>
produce area to look at ugli fruit, explaining things to friends and <br/>
neighbors, running nekkid through the sprinkler, in the middle of the night, <br/>
when it is too hot to sleep, playing with magnets, planting a garden, <br/>
dressing in a Spiderman costume every day for a week eight months after <br/>
Halloween, reading a book late into the night cause you can&#39;t put it down, <br/>
sleeping till noon cause you don&#39;t have to be anywhere, picking that book <br/>
back up again two years or two hours later and reading it again, explaining <br/>
things to friends and neighbors again, eating cake for breakfast, popping a <br/>
bowl of popcorn for the ducks, walking by the river at dawn to see the <br/>
cranes, spending a day playing playstation, painting rocks, having the skate <br/>

&#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me bows<br/>
to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones, our tired<br/>
feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a dimension that is<br/>
more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the &#39;trappings and the<br/>
suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39;<br/>
and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all that, a space for the<br/>
eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361726982">My friend really sees fairies.  Really.  My son thinks some ancient being<br/>
lives in our Mountain Ash tree.  I have never seen, heard, felt, these<br/>
creatures.  I DO see, hear, feel, feed and eventually end up with every<br/>
stray cat in the neighborhood.  Not quite as exciting or interesting as<br/>
fairies but warmer at night.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tell Dylan I agree with him, he should leave something for the wee one who <br/>
lives in his tree. I recommend something warm, it may have been years since <br/>
someone left something soft and fluffy for him to wrap up in. Of course the <br/>
honey and maybe some nuts. An oatmeal cake would be nice too. Homemade bread <br/>
and a bit of butter and/or cheese. Something shiny and new, he may not have <br/>
had anything new, all his own, for a long time. A shiny brand new penny, or <br/>
maybe a pretty bead? Do you know about those little tiny glass beads? (seed <br/>
beads) Have Dylan make a small necklace out of some. Don&#39;t forget to leave <br/>
something at Samhain!<br/>
 <br/>
~Nancy Wishing much luck, and many blessings to Dylan with his wee folk!<br/>
