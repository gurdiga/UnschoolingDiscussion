<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-&quot;Yes, someday they will need to have sex, so let&#39;s have them <br/>
&gt; practice it<br/>
&gt; &gt; while they are children!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; My analogy has been &quot;would breaking his finger now prepare him for a <br/>
&gt; possible<br/>
&gt; broken leg later?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;or sooner or later he&#39;ll come in contact with alcohol, so why not put<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;n a bottle and give him while he&#39;s a baby so he can get adjusted to it <br/>
&gt;early?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have used &quot;They&#39;ll need to drive a car one day,  guess I&#39;ll give &#39;em<br/>
the keys and make them learn to drive a car now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like these all...will have to file them away in my mind for later use.<br/>
