outcome, then possibly there&#39;s manipulation involved.  If we&#39;re just leaving<br/>
stuff out and around, in case anybody is interested, it&#39;s just interesting<br/>
clutter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291671746">I haven&#39;t weighed in on the strewing thread much because I haven&#39;t had <br/>
to strew.  My girls have been quite adept at finding their own <br/>
interests and finding new ones accidentally for quite a long time now. <br/>
 I see now that had I been practicing purposeful strewing, they might <br/>
have gotten caught up in other things instead of their current <br/>
fascinations.  For us, I think strewing what I found most interesting <br/>
would have had the effect of superimposing my likes over theirs.  <br/>
Instead we have three very separate circles of intrest thet only <br/>
overlap partially.  Had I kept them fully involved in the overlapping <br/>
parts, they may never have found the outer parts of the circles.  And <br/>
then there is the circle of my dh&#39;s interest and Wyndham&#39;s interests <br/>
which cross ours in someplaces and not others.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense to anyone?  I know what I an trying to say but <br/>
I&#39;m not sure others will get it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the consequence of having the five of us with varied i <br/>
nterests in one house has not led to an unstrewn house but no one <br/>
does it with the intent of seeing if anyone else is interested.  It <br/>
just happens.<br/>

I sometimes wish that I had learned about the idea of strewing when Lars <br/>
was much younger, but chances are he&#39;d be going the same direction now anyway.<br/>

to be interested in gardening. She found that on her own, now we both <br/>
garden.  But had I strewn her towards the other things I thought she <br/>
was interested in, and used up all her time with that, she may never <br/>
have found gardening and neither would I.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I think boils down to this:  You should only &#39;strew&#39; if <br/>

stuff on their own, strewing might just distract them from their own <br/>

<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have loose ends.  They&#39;re finding stuff all the time, and <br/>
NOTHING is a distraction, everything is an addition.  Their &quot;path&quot; is <br/>
encompassing the whole world, it&#39;s not a narrow little trail.  So I think a <br/>
parent considers their children to be on &quot;a path&quot; instead of open to all <br/>
input, the analogy becomes a limitation.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Strewing what YOU found most interesting wouldn&#39;t be what we&#39;ve been talking <br/>
about, though. That would simply be leaving your own clutter lying around, I <br/>
guess &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t what people mean by &quot;strewing&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking about strewing things that we think the KIDS will be interested <br/>
in. I mean, they wouldn&#39;t pick it up and fool with it if they weren&#39;t and, <br/>
with strewing, there is NO pressure on the kids to even give whateveritis a <br/>
second glance if they&#39;re not interested.<br/>
<br/>
I was rummaging in a box yesterday and stumbled upon our huge container of <br/>
pattern blocks. They&#39;d been buried in the bottom of this box and I pulled <br/>
them out and left them on the dining room table just because they hadn&#39;t been <br/>
available for a while (being buried in the bottom of a box) and I thought <br/>
maybe somebody might like to fool with them. My husband started playing with <br/>
them first and my daughter and her friend got in on it too, later. They&#39;re <br/>
still sitting there.<br/>
<br/>
This wasn&#39;t superimposing my likes over theirs  - it was making something <br/>
available IF they felt like using it. They could have left them sitting on <br/>
the table for a day or a week  and everybody could have ignored them until <br/>
they got put away.<br/>
<br/>
I also leave the new magazines lying around - so people can see that they&#39;ve <br/>
arrived and choose to look them over, if they want to do so. <br/>
<br/>
This morning, Rosie said, &quot;THANKS Mommy, for finding the pattern blocks.&quot;<br/>
She hadn&#39;t asked for them, but was glad to see them resurface.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Had I kept them fully involved in the overlapping <br/>
 </span></blockquote>parts, they may never have found the outer parts of the circles.  <br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Again - strewing doesn&#39;t mean keeping the kids involved in something you are <br/>
also involved in. It just means THINKING about them and knowing them, being <br/>
able to guess that something might interest them and leaving it out where <br/>
they can find it and decide for themselves if it does, in fact, interest <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Anyway, the consequence of having the five of us with varied i <br/>
 </span></blockquote>nterests in one house has not led to an unstrewn house but no one <br/>
does it with the intent of seeing if anyone else is interested.  <br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
So, if you were in the library and ran across a book that you thought would <br/>
interest your daughter -- you&#39;d never bring it home and leave it on the table <br/>
where she&#39;d be sure to find it? You&#39;d object to that? You&#39;d think that was <br/>
superimposing your own interests over that of the child? <br/>
<br/>
Again, I think that some people&#39;s lifestyles are very very calm and they are <br/>
sort of &quot;minimalist&quot; families. If they brought in a book from the library, <br/>
they&#39;d hand it to the kid and talk to them about it, etc. In my family, I <br/>
might put it on the shelf where we keep the library books and then let it go <br/>
from my mind -- knowing that the kids will be rummaging through that shelf <br/>
and will stumble across it and, if it interests them, they&#39;ll take a look at <br/>
it. I don&#39;t need to remember to introduce it to them - just need to leave it <br/>
somewhere they&#39;ll find it.<br/>
<br/>
In other families, especially those with kids just out of school, even a <br/>
parent just suggesting a book to a kid might be &quot;felt&quot; by the kid as if it is <br/>
an assignment. So kids might be a bit resistant to recommendations by their <br/>
parents, for a while. Just leaving things lying around that you think might <br/>
interest them is a way to offer resources to them without them feeling <br/>
pressured.<br/>

just ... strewing. Like leaves on a path. Some they pick up. Some they walk<br/>
past.<br/>
<br/>
In houses where there&#39;s a lot of wind, perhaps lots of leaves fall just from<br/>
living life. In other homes the strewing may need to be more parent<br/>
initiated. But they&#39;re still leaves strewn about to be picked up or walked<br/>
past.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think you understand strewing at all.  If a child is interested in <br/>
something, nothing can divert them. Strewing is simply a way of opening the <br/>
world to a child. A child does not come into this world understanding all the <br/>
possible choices available. A good unschooler is going to make sure the child <br/>
is exposed to CHOICES.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t equal interest or time.<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you think that placing available items around is going to <br/>
divert them from anything.<br/>
Strange way to look at it.<br/>
Maybe we should just clear our homes of any books, tv or anything interesting <br/>
because it might divert their interests?<br/>

leaving a book about birds of prey out on the dining room table, thinking the <br/>
kids might enjoy the cool photographs, is preventing them from discovering <br/>
gardening. They&#39;ll still discover things &quot;on their own&quot; -- although one could <br/>
argue that you &quot;strewed her path with gardening&quot; just by having chosen to <br/>
live in a place where gardening is possible and happens. <br/>

time with that?&quot; I don&#39;t see leaving things lying around that kids MIGHT find <br/>
interesting as &quot;using up all their time&quot; any more than I see it as forcing <br/>
them to do things that interest their parents.<br/>
<br/>
I once had a kid interested in gardening - no longer a passion, I&#39;m sorry to <br/>
say - but when it was, she was especially interested in herb gardens. I <br/>
happened to go to a library that we didn&#39;t normally use and saw a beautiful <br/>
book about herb gardens around the world. I checked it out and left it on her <br/>
bed, so she&#39;d be sure to see it.<br/>
How on EARTH did that detract from her life? How did it prevent HER from <br/>
finding her own interests? How did it use up all her time? How did it impose <br/>
my interests on her? <br/>
<br/>
She had the choice to glance at the book and then ignore it. She could skim <br/>
through it. She could sit for hours and gaze at the pictures or carefully <br/>
read all the text. She had total control - I simply dropped something into <br/>
her path and let her decide if she wanted to pick it up or step over it.<br/>
<br/>

they are interested in. But usually they are interested in lots and lots of <br/>
things - they don&#39;t see the world in terms of following some particular <br/>
specific path ONLY. They&#39;re normally happy to take side trips - sometimes <br/>
just stopping for a minute at a vista point and sometimes traveling along a <br/>
different path for a while.<br/>

Kind of like this: I&#39;m marginally interested in radio so if that was <br/>

constantly strew radio in front of me, I have a marginal interest in <br/>
radio and had time to find a strong interest in textile arts on my <br/>
own.  I still do both, but if my dh had kept me so involved in radio <br/>

Strewing their paths with potentially interesting stuff is obviously not the <br/>
ONLY thing we&#39;re talking about -- Nobody said they were &quot;focused&quot; on doing <br/>
that and I think we&#39;ve posted more than enough about supporting our kids&#39; <br/>
interests for it to be abundantly clear that our kids DO find their own <br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
If I give them some additional choices and they CHOOSE something different, <br/>
then they CHOSE it and that means they PREFERED it. You think it is better to <br/>
limit their choices (by not offering new and potentially interesting <br/>
possibilities) so that you don&#39;t risk distracting them off the path they <br/>
chose when they had fewer options.<br/>
<br/>
None of us can offer unlimited choices, but to purposely withhold things that <br/>
the kids might really find interesting and enjoyable, for fear that it will <br/>
influence what they choose to do with their time? <br/>

I don&#39;t understand the thinking behind that position.<br/>

offer up all sorts of things to my kids, I bring home tons of cool things (I <br/>
think so anyway) and leave them on the living room book shelf, the coffee <br/>
table, kitchen table, and sometimes I just hand it right on over to the kids. <br/>
&quot;I think you might like this.&quot; No strings attached. Now if I handed my <br/>

go.&quot; with the expectation that she immediately &quot;do&quot; something, well then that <br/>
would be steering her towards something. <br/>

I guess you&#39;re assuming that unschooled kids are like you&#39;d be with your <br/>
husband. That just because he left a bunch of radio stuff in your path, you&#39;d <br/>
fool with that instead of doing what you REALLY wanted to do. My kids <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do that - they wouldn&#39;t let something else interfere with what they <br/>
really want to do - not if they had true freedom to choose. Learning to <br/>
manage time is something unschooled kids REALLY get a handle on at a young <br/>
age because they do have so much freedom to choose what to do with their own <br/>
time. I&#39;ve observed, first-hand, that they are often far better at it than <br/>
their own parents, in fact &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

This concept reminds me a little of my son.  He always says that he likes <br/>
to &quot;keep his options open&quot;.  It&#39;s a good concept, but I&#39;ve been trying to <br/>
get across to him that keeping one option open often means closing another, <br/>
at least for the moment.  Nobody can do it all.<br/>

You would actually spend more time on something you are marginally interested <br/>
in over something you are deeply interested in just because the items were <br/>
available?<br/>
Wow.<br/>
Sounds like someone that can&#39;t make choices for themselves.<br/>
I trust my children to make choices regardless of what is available.<br/>
And comments like :<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, but if I had been focused on &#39;strewing&#39; the path in front of my <br/>
kids the way I think many here mean it,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Show me that you still don&#39;t have a &quot;feel&quot; for the list or what many on here <br/>
mean at all.<br/>
Every person that posted about strewing has done so with the intent of <br/>
offering choices, not coercing, it&#39;s obvious.  I&#39;ve read posts from these <br/>
same people at other lists and message boards and I KNOW that they have a <br/>
firm grip on what unschooling means and   how to strew in a meaningful, <br/>
noncoercive, beautiful, bubbly way.<br/>
Why can&#39;t you get the feel for what these incredibly wise people are saying?<br/>
At this point I feel like any veteran unschooler that has solid unschooling <br/>
advice is going to get a negative response from you.<br/>
What do you get from this list? What have you learned from being here?<br/>
Do you enjoy the support of other unschoolers?  I really, really wonder these <br/>
things.<br/>

<br/>
What I see is half a dozen people describing a gentle process of providing<br/>
access to the world so kids have the ability to find new interests and one<br/>
person saying it&#39;s coming out as &quot;so well supplied&quot; and &quot;forced them to use&quot;<br/>
and &quot;made them do&quot; and &quot;so involved&quot; and &quot;constantly giving me stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do your children pick up every leaf they see? Do you need to keep them off<br/>
leaf strewn paths to prevent them from being unable to choose for<br/>
themselves?<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t find quotes then it would show appreciation to all the time<br/>
people are spending to try to make this strewing point clear to go back and<br/>
reread the thread *knowing* that no one is saying what you are interpretting<br/>
so we can move onto something that&#39;s more useful to the the rest of the<br/>

think about it all the time and are constantly finding things to <br/>
strew.  And what I have said is that that would have made big changes <br/>
in how my kids had turned out.  If I had spent any extra time <br/>
thinking about what to put in front of them and procuring it and <br/>
leaving it about for them, they would not have had any free time.  I <br/>
knew them well enough to strew the right stuff to occupy them, but <br/>
that would have had the effect of using up their time and they would <br/>
never have developed these other hobbies.  It is not a matter of me <br/>
forcing it, or of them not being able to find other things.  And it&#39;s <br/>
not a matter of there not having been anything there, there was a lot <br/>
of stuff strewn in there path but it happened hanturally and without <br/>
my having to think about it at all.  <br/>
But go back and read my description my adult viewpoint with a hobby <br/>
that I could have ended up highly involved in but didn&#39;t.  It is very <br/>
easy for a parent to do that with a child (overwhelm them with a <br/>
portion their own interests) without even realizing it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425672191">It&#39;s not that at all.  It&#39;s more, &quot;Hey this is cool. I&#39;ll mess with<br/>
this while I have it cause I really like it.&quot;  Not that I had to do it<br/>
but that it would have fed one interest and caused me to miss the<br/>
others that I have found since that I am willing to do all the work to<br/>
mess with.<br/>
<br/>
I really am not understanding. Why is it choosing one thing over another and<br/>
never doing the other again?<br/>
Aren&#39;t the interests that are currently being done causing you or the kids<br/>
to miss out on other potentially unknown interests? Or is it the fact that<br/>
someone else is introducing them that makes it feel to you like it couldn&#39;t<br/>
possibly be your own interest?<br/>
