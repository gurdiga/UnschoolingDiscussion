<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404481886">Another mystery that has been driving me crazy.<br/>
How come some peoples posts arrive on my computer looking like modified text (say Times Roman or some other font) and most others come in plain old courier (typewriter) font?<br/>
Even when I type and send my message in a different font, it still shows up as courier.<br/>
But some posts do show a different font.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea about the &quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&quot; things. I have noticed that it happens to me only sometimes when I am replying back to another post, but not always.<br/>

  O.K., curiosity and the cat thing here.  How come some posts arrive in their<br/>
  original state looking like they are a forward or an answer?  I mean the<br/>
  little &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; things.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Then her little brother comes along<br/>
  &gt; &gt;   and he and I butt heads right from the start, unschooling has made him<br/>
  a<br/>
  &gt; &gt;   lazy, willful child. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Could you explain a bit more what you mean by that? I mean, like how was<br/>
  it<br/>
  &gt; &gt; determined that he was lazy and willful, and who did the determing?<br/>
  Thanks<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
