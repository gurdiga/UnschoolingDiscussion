Have you discovered the Dav Pilkey books about Captain Underpants?  If<br/>
you can stand the same bathroom jokes over and over your son will love them.<br/>

their english counterparts. Either its just Virginia or the Brits are <br/>

One lady from here went to Hesfes a couple of years back and was <br/>
horrified to hear mucho swearing from kids as young as 3. She was <br/>
also disgusted at tangled hair and scruffy clothes however.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe it is location. I really don&#39;t hear children swear that often. When I <br/>
do, it&#39;s mean schooled children. As in swearing and yelling at those they <br/>
are playing with who won&#39;t follow their rules.<br/>
<br/>
I would never feel comfortable with my children swearing. I know they are <br/>
just words and all. They watch movies with swear words in them and <br/>
occasionally my husband or I slip up. With me it&#39;s a matter of what I feel <br/>
is respectful. Not a lot of people I know of would be comfortable with <br/>
hearing language like that often from anyone let alone children. I feel <br/>
there&#39;s a time and place for it. I don&#39;t feel small children are the time <br/>
and definitely out in public isn&#39;t the place. My almost 17 year old has just <br/>
recently gotten to the point where she will swear in front of me realying a <br/>
joke or story or feeling. I&#39;m fine with that and I do the same with her now <br/>
too. She doesn&#39;t swear around the children or my mom or out in public. She <br/>
also doesn&#39;t swear at us either.<br/>

length hair is almost always in tangles.  (No matter what magic potion we <br/>
buy.)  And both she and my four year old pick out their own clothes....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Virginia is definitely a close-mouthed state. My children were chastised for <br/>
saying butt. &quot;We don&#39;t say butt; we say bottom or hiney.&quot; They think that&#39;s <br/>
ridiculous since the word is buttock. <br/>
<br/>
To think it was once a British colony. Now in Connecticut (at least in <br/>
central CT) many patients couldn&#39;t understand me unless I used the f-word <br/>
(works well as adj, noun, verb). <br/>
