sleep or bio rythms. If you read about bio rhythms, you will understand that <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894927908">A lot of research shows that during adolescence the internal clock changes<br/>
so that kids can&#39;t go to sleep as early and need to sleep later in the day.<br/>
It&#39;s purely biological. School districts have identified this and a few<br/>
have changed hours to better meet the kids&#39; needs but most continue to have<br/>
high schoolers start earlier than the younger grades because so many work<br/>
after school.<br/>

I think my husband is in delayed development as he never got over his<br/>
adolescence clock:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575587488">My dd (10) stays up until around 2 or 3 am...every night.  I have <br/>
gotten to the point where I will stay up with her, some nights, till <br/>
midnight, but then I gotta give in...She routinely sleeps until I <br/>
wake her.  I usually go up there and rouse her around 12:30 or 1 pm.  <br/>
It took me many months to get to the point where I felt comfortable <br/>
letting her &quot;sleep the day away&quot;  Dh still disagrees with me on this <br/>
one.  But she spends most of her night time reading, drawing, or <br/>
playing video games.  There are a couple of late night cartoons that <br/>
she gets into.  Other than that, she reads...reads..reads...How can I <br/>
say no to that?  At least I know that she is happy, and interested.  <br/>
Her attic room is tomblike, so, if left to her own devices, she would <br/>
seriously sleep until 4 or 5 pm...But she has a paper route and needs <br/>
to at least be up in time to do that!  Personally, sleep is one of my <br/>
favorite things..so many dreams.  I sometimes have out of body <br/>
experiences while I sleep.  At least I feel that they are OBE&#39;s but <br/>
they are interspersed with the dream itself.  Dreams are awesome!<br/>

I am also dealing with this.<br/>
<br/>
One of my closest friends just started homeschooling,  But informed me that it wouldn&#39;t be like my homeschooling.  Which I don&#39;t understand,  why wouldn&#39;t everyone unschool?  Hee, hee.     She is still waking her kids up,  making them go to bed.   Relaxed in schooling somewhat, but still doing assignments and such.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get it...if it didn&#39;t work at school,  why try it at home.   And... why make them get up?  Isn&#39;t a great benefit to homeschooling the fact that you can have your own schedules?       She says they won&#39;t get anything done if they sleep in.   Yada, yada...  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a long way from unschooling.   Sigh....this is hard for me. <br/>

Be patient :-) She sounds like me, 4 years ago, and I&#39;m still &quot;homeschooling&quot; more than I think I should. I started to relax when I saw my kids (who were jr high age when we started) taking the lead, making decisions about what they wanted to do and when/if they wanted to study something formally.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to accept that life itself is a learning process -- we&#39;ve mostly been taught to take control, take the lead, crush the competition, etc. We&#39;ve been trained to feel uneasy without rules, rituals and structure. Unschooling is a surrendering of all those ideas, at least it has been for me and my kids, and it doesn&#39;t happen overnight.<br/>

sometimes more, no matter what time he goes to bed.  Not if he stays up<br/>
particularly late one night, but at times when we&#39;ve had months of going to<br/>
bed at 10 or 11 and getting up at 8 or 9.  It just seems to be his thing to<br/>
be awake 14 of every 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I got him out of bed promptly at 6, I&#39;d probably find him exhausted<br/>
by about 8 p.m.  The logical part of my brain says we&#39;d accomplish exactly<br/>
as much between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. as we would between 10a.m. and midnight.<br/>
(The not-so-logical part of my brain actually suspects we wouldn&#39;t, since<br/>
neither of us function well in the moring, but that&#39;s not really my point.)<br/>
Why do you have less time to get things done if they sleep in?  You just<br/>
don&#39;t go to bed as early!  I don&#39;t get it!<br/>
