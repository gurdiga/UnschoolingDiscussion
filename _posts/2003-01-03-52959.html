&lt;&lt; I am homeschooling my 6 year old this year and I am looking for a <br/>
 Florida State Certified Teacher to do an end of the year evaluation.  <br/>
 Of course I am looking for someone who accepts a relaxed approach to <br/>
 education.  If anyone has a recommendation I&#39;d appreciate it.  We <br/>
 live in Lake County, Florida.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I recommend signing up with an umbrella school.<br/>
Email me off list though, as Florida is not really OT for everyone else here.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
