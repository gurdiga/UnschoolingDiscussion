<div id="ygrps-yiv-607285003">I was curious...does anyone else here watch Penn & Teller&#39;s show on Showtime?  I&#39;ve been watching it for a while and really enjoy it -- recently the kids started watching it with me and we have had some great discussions based upon the themes of the show.  Last night the show was about colleges:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/topics.do?topic=college">http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/topics.do?topic=college</a> -- was just wondering if anyone else here is a fan of the show.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128308397">I don&#39;t have cable, but when it&#39;s on DVD I&#39;d love to see it.  They did a <br/>
fantastic series for PBS years ago called &quot;Behind the Scenes.&quot; I taped some, and <br/>
last time I checked they weren&#39;t on DVD yet.  They were on music, sculpture, <br/>
perspective...<br/>

<br/>
EEEK!!!<br/>

I ordered the first season used while I was at Amazon.  <br/>
Holly won&#39;t remember that first series at all (Behind the Scenes).  Kirby <br/>
definitely will.  Marty probably.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really excited about getting to show a couple of scenes in particular to <br/>
Holly.<br/>

Thanks!  I would guess that my Mythbusters-loving family would also go for this.<br/>
