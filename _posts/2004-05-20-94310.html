<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743726384">&quot;Maybe you are right, maybe there is a distinction in how you love children <br/>
that are adopted or are your birth children.  Maybe no matter how much I don&#39;t <br/>
want there to be that, there will always be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here we go again Glena....I swear you don&#39;t READ what people write.<br/>
I did NOT say that the adopted children were less loved. If that were the case, I don&#39;t see how my parents could have endlessly gave to people that treated them so awful so much of the time. My brother got help every time he got out of jail, new clothes, dishes, anything they could help him with, only to have him lose, sell or destroy what he&#39;d been given because he can&#39;t control his addictions.<br/>
I think I&#39;ve made it pretty clear that these children were loved deeply and intensely.<br/>
I also think you&#39;re ignoring the fact that you don&#39;t bond at the same level with an 11 y.o. that has issues, as you do with a child you carried in your womb and have been with from birth. If you think that&#39;s an equal bonding...you&#39;re totally ignoring the fact that my sister COULDN&#39;T bond the same way, by the very fact that she&#39;d already bonded deeply with HER birth parents!! <br/>
<br/>
Quit twisting things through that filter of yours...it&#39;s irritating.<br/>

peace.  Peace is the way.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t say LESS loved, but loved in a different way.  You did say that, I <br/>
read that.  While you say how much you are family and that you do love them, <br/>
it&#39;s DIFFERENT.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t use the words less loved, but loved differently, and that is what <br/>
you described.<br/>
<br/>
What you described did give me some insight into a lot of things, many things <br/>
that directly relate to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Many people think we are offering our children &quot;less than&quot; but it&#39;s really <br/>
just &quot;different&quot; and can be much better in almost all cases.<br/>
<br/>
Just because you care for something or someone differently it does not mean <br/>
it&#39;s &quot;less than&quot; and I didn&#39;t say that, those were your words.  Differently <br/>
means differently, I love my husband differently than I do my children.  There <br/>
are differences in the way I parent each of my children, all bio children.  They <br/>
need different things from me at different times.  It doesn&#39;t mean I parent <br/>
any of them &quot;less than&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, I find it equally irritating that you can presume to say <br/>
I&#39;ve said something when I certainly did not, just because you THINK that&#39;s <br/>
what I&#39;ve said, doesn&#39;t make it so.  If you really read that post you would <br/>
know that I was admitting that I could now SEE that indeed whether I&#39;d like for <br/>
there to be or not, differences are going to exist between naturally born <br/>
children and adopted children.  That is was my skewed vision from the side of the <br/>
fence of BEING adopted at almost four that made me think/hope/wish that there <br/>
were no differences in how parents would love bio or adopted children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441362514">Glena, you did say &quot;less than&quot; - and it was also clear that was what  <br/>
you meant by &quot;distinctions&quot; in a number of places in recent posts. Here  <br/>
is one example:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Wishing one had given all of one&#39;s energy and time to three birth  <br/>
children<br/>
upon reflection of a life of raising a group of children, seems to me  <br/>
that even<br/>
after years there are distinctions and divisions to some with regard to<br/>
&quot;birth&quot; children and &quot;adoptive&quot; children.  Making them somehow less  <br/>
than the same,<br/>
as in these are &quot;our children&quot;. &gt;<br/>
