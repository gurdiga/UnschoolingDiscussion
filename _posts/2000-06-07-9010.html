<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759357835">Hi Nanci,<br/>
<br/>
All I can say is, &quot;YIKES!!!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
What is to become of this world?  (And those poor neighbour girls...)  I<br/>
think my children have been naked in the yard at the ripe old age of 5!<br/>
What&#39;s the big, hairy deal regarding babies yet?  Jealousy!  Your<br/>
neighbour is jealous of your mothering or something...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Her demand for swim trunks on my babies gave me the urge to march over there and ask her to please refrain from screaming obscenities and abusing her children where mine could hear and see it.  Of course I didn&#39;t, as that would be petty and childish.  But I just felt the need to vent and share the event with all of you.  It upset me a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576044466">One major comment here, be careful with this woman. Her &quot;issue&quot; with your<br/>
babies tells more about HER than anything. That is tough when you don&#39;t have<br/>
the privacy fence there. I, personally, think she is ill in thought because<br/>
2&3 years old and she&#39;s got a problem with it? Like I said, it states a lot<br/>
about her. We have a privacy fence on one side and the back of our yard, the<br/>
open side faces nothing but a greenbelt and my Emily, 5yo, STILL loves to<br/>
get into her little pool nakie, but really likes to run around in her<br/>
panties. I told her only in the back yard.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to say that I would have told her she was sick and perverted<br/>
for thinking anything was wrong with your boys being outside at that age<br/>
nudie, but we live in a society full of shame and shaming. Especially for<br/>
the naked body, one of the most natural things on our Mother earth However<br/>
in this time you have to really think before you say something like that<br/>
because you never know how far someone may take something and it&#39;s too bad<br/>
to feel that way but one must take care with people like that. It&#39;s sad (and<br/>
she&#39;s nuts.)<br/>

Good luck and love!<br/>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As strange as it may seem, behaviour like your 
neighbor&#39;s toward you often stems from feelings of intimidation.&nbsp; The 
outwardly negative person is all too aware of their dis-satisfaction with 
themselves - though they may never admit it to you.&nbsp; She could very well be 
jealous.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;ve found that you can often defuse a situation 
like the one you describe by bestowing some importance to the other 
person.&nbsp; Specifically, by asking for their help in some innocuous 
way.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Is there something you can ask your neighbour for 
help or advice on - without making yourself further vulnerable to her?&nbsp; (It 
has to be genuine, not patronizing.)&nbsp; You might be surprised how quickly 
she turns into your staunchest defender.</font>&nbsp;</div>

you described (ACK) what in the world would she do if she were angry w/<br/>
you???   ohhhhhhhhhh I don&#39;t think there is NOTHING cutier than little<br/>
free~hearts having a good time playing naked as a jay~bird ... when my dss<br/>
were little bitsy, they&#39;d run around naked b/c of drs orders, esp in the<br/>
summer b/c of DIAPER RASH!!!  man she would&#39;ve had a field day w/ ME!!!<br/>
haha ...  AND, my kidlets think it&#39;s pretty fun to swim in the buff, too<br/>
(our backyard pool is enclosed w/ a privacy fence, so total privacy!!!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not to trying to distract from your problem but this reminded me of our<br/>
h-s camping trip a few wks ago ... a h-s mom (also a friend) had her 18 mth<br/>
old skinny dipping in the river and I took a picture of him standing on a<br/>
rock while holding his mama&#39;s hand b/c I thought it was just precious (GASP,<br/>
IT WAS FRONTAL VIEW, also hinnie view, too) ...  one of the h-s dads came up<br/>
to me and asked if I was planning to devlop this film myself???  I said no,<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to develop film wished I did though but I&#39;ll just mail it<br/>
off like always ... he said &quot;WELL, you&#39;d better be REALLY CAREFUL about<br/>
those NUDE PICTURES you&#39;re taking there, I&#39;d HATE to hear that you&#39;re having<br/>
to homeschool from the POKEY!!!&quot;  OHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhh my goodness??? ... I<br/>
said &quot;well, my intentions aren&#39;t PERVERTED so I doubt I&#39;d be hauled off over<br/>
friendly baby pictures!!!&quot;  ohhhhhhhhhhhh we have to deal w/ the drug<br/>
dealers, the bank robbers and all that white crime out there but the police<br/>
dept is coming after *ME*???   so, I basically laughed @ him and blew him<br/>
off ... and, yes, I had the film developed and I&#39;m NOT wearing STRIPES!!!<br/>
haha ...<br/>
<br/>
ohhhhhhhh good luck w/ your crazy neighbor and tread softly ... any chances<br/>
they&#39;ll move???  hehe ...<br/>

&gt; babies tells more about HER than anything. That is tough when you don&#39;t<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; the privacy fence there. I, personally, think she is ill in thought<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; 2&3 years old and she&#39;s got a problem with it? Like I said, it states a<br/>
lot<br/>
&gt; about her. We have a privacy fence on one side and the back of our yard,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; open side faces nothing but a greenbelt and my Emily, 5yo, STILL loves to<br/>
&gt; get into her little pool nakie, but really likes to run around in her<br/>
&gt; panties. I told her only in the back yard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would like to say that I would have told her she was sick and perverted<br/>
&gt; for thinking anything was wrong with your boys being outside at that age<br/>
&gt; nudie, but we live in a society full of shame and shaming. Especially for<br/>
&gt; the naked body, one of the most natural things on our Mother earth However<br/>
&gt; in this time you have to really think before you say something like that<br/>
&gt; because you never know how far someone may take something and it&#39;s too bad<br/>
&gt; to feel that way but one must take care with people like that. It&#39;s sad<br/>
(and<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s nuts.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck and love!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi all.  Had a rather unpleasant experience yesterday.  My two toddlers (2<br/>
&gt; and 3) were splashing around naked in a wading pool in our backyard.  Our<br/>
&gt; neighbor, who has two girls (7 and 13) came over and complained, saying<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; she did not want her girls to see my boys naked.  We do not yet have<br/>
privacy<br/>
&gt; fencing up in back, just chain fencing. I thought it was particularly<br/>
silly,<br/>
&gt; given that my babes are not even toilet trained yet, and are still in<br/>
&gt; diapers.  In the interests of neighborhood peace, I aquiesced to putting<br/>
&gt; shorts on them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, this is the same neighbor who screams/shouts obscenities at her<br/>
&gt; daughters in the yard (front and back) at the top of her lungs all the<br/>
time.<br/>
&gt; She also pulls their hair and strikes them, that I have seen, as well as<br/>
&gt; calling them stupid, fat, etc.  Not the type of things I really want my<br/>
&gt; toddlers to see or hear.  Especially since the 7 year old (and often her 8<br/>
&gt; yr old cousin) comes over frequently to play in our house and yard and my<br/>
3<br/>
&gt; year old is quite fond of her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her demand for swim trunks on my babies gave me the urge to march over<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; and ask her to please refrain from screaming obscenities and abusing her<br/>
&gt; children where mine could hear and see it.  Of course I didn&#39;t, as that<br/>
&gt; would be petty and childish.  But I just felt the need to vent and share<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; event with all of you.  It upset me a bit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I get the feeling that they do not want their little one playing with mine, as they are always coming to fetch her home when she is here.  However, she will be here for 2 hours or more before they come looking for her.  <br/>
<br/>
Today they were out playing in the back yard (my two and this neighbor girl) and my three year old came crying to tell me that she had hit him in the face.  So I said, &quot;Well, let&#39;s go talk to her.&quot;  When I asked if she had hit him she launched into a whole big complex story about why she &quot;Had&quot; to hit him, just a little.  The whole while not meeting my gaze and clearly nervous.  So I took her chin gently and I looked into her eyes and said, &quot;In this house, we don&#39;t hit.&quot;  Then I smiled and gave her a bit of a hug and left the kids to play.  She looked tremendously relieved.  LOL  Poor thing.  She does seem to really like to come over and spend time here.<br/>

Sounds like your neighbor is one twisted sister.  I agree that you ought to <br/>
be very careful with her.   What a hoot, eh?  :)  Also, don&#39;t let her steal <br/>
your sunshine.  Put little shorts on da babies.  Pee on her and her sick <br/>
little mind.  Let them play on, splashing in the sun is still fun even with <br/>
shorts on.  :)<br/>

&gt;One major comment here, be careful with this woman. Her &quot;issue&quot; with your<br/>
&gt;babies tells more about HER than anything. That is tough when you don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;the privacy fence there. I, personally, think she is ill in thought because<br/>
&gt;2&3 years old and she&#39;s got a problem with it? Like I said, it states a lot<br/>
&gt;about her. We have a privacy fence on one side and the back of our yard, <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;open side faces nothing but a greenbelt and my Emily, 5yo, STILL loves to<br/>
&gt;get into her little pool nakie, but really likes to run around in her<br/>
&gt;panties. I told her only in the back yard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to say that I would have told her she was sick and perverted<br/>
&gt;for thinking anything was wrong with your boys being outside at that age<br/>
&gt;nudie, but we live in a society full of shame and shaming. Especially for<br/>
&gt;the naked body, one of the most natural things on our Mother earth However<br/>
&gt;in this time you have to really think before you say something like that<br/>
&gt;because you never know how far someone may take something and it&#39;s too bad<br/>
&gt;to feel that way but one must take care with people like that. It&#39;s sad <br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Neighbor Blues<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all.  Had a rather unpleasant experience yesterday.  My two toddlers (2<br/>
&gt;and 3) were splashing around naked in a wading pool in our backyard.  Our<br/>
&gt;neighbor, who has two girls (7 and 13) came over and complained, saying <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;she did not want her girls to see my boys naked.  We do not yet have <br/>
&gt;privacy<br/>
&gt;fencing up in back, just chain fencing. I thought it was particularly <br/>
&gt;silly,<br/>
&gt;given that my babes are not even toilet trained yet, and are still in<br/>
&gt;diapers.  In the interests of neighborhood peace, I aquiesced to putting<br/>
&gt;shorts on them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, this is the same neighbor who screams/shouts obscenities at her<br/>
&gt;daughters in the yard (front and back) at the top of her lungs all the <br/>
&gt;time.<br/>
&gt;She also pulls their hair and strikes them, that I have seen, as well as<br/>
&gt;calling them stupid, fat, etc.  Not the type of things I really want my<br/>
&gt;toddlers to see or hear.  Especially since the 7 year old (and often her 8<br/>
&gt;yr old cousin) comes over frequently to play in our house and yard and my 3<br/>
&gt;year old is quite fond of her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Her demand for swim trunks on my babies gave me the urge to march over <br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt;and ask her to please refrain from screaming obscenities and abusing her<br/>
&gt;children where mine could hear and see it.  Of course I didn&#39;t, as that<br/>
&gt;would be petty and childish.  But I just felt the need to vent and share <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;event with all of you.  It upset me a bit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

All the powers that be around here (Police, etc) are mostly Mormon as well, and I have no illusions as to where their sympathies would lie, if she is Mormon.  I am not, and that would be the deciding factor if my experiences so far in this community bear out.  <br/>
<br/>
My chief aim is to maintain the peace in the neighborhood and keep from having any enemies around us.  In purely the interests of maintaining (more than anything else) the ability of the little girl to come over and play here, I will swallow my tongue and put the shorts on.  My kids don&#39;t care, but just looked at me kinda&#39; funny.  &quot;What do we need those for Mom?&quot; :-)<br/>

basically had to sign some documents admitting guilt and promising never to<br/>
do it again, or risk have her daughter taken away.<br/>

<br/>
I called our local groc store photolab (I usually mail my film off) and I<br/>
asked if they&#39;d have a problem w/ developing some pictures of my friend&#39;s<br/>
little toddler taken @ a campout @ the river ... before I described the<br/>
pictures, she laughed and said &quot;are you talking about NUDE~BABY PICS???<br/>
*NOoooo*, there is a BIG DIFFERENCE this and PORN and we&#39;ve TRAINED to<br/>
distinguish b/t the two, so please don&#39;t worry!!!&quot;   I did take her name<br/>
*just in case* the police were @ the store waiting to haul me off when I<br/>
pick these up next week ...<br/>
<br/>
GOODNESS, I wonder what my dd&#39;s wedding guest thought of her PERVERTED<br/>
mother when they attended her wedding reception 3 yrs ago???   next to the<br/>
gift table and guess registry, I&#39;d placed several nake~jay~bird ~baby pics<br/>
and other childhood pics of BOTH the bride and groom; everyone remarked how<br/>

It is hard, I know from experience, to bite your tongue and go the peaceful <br/>
route.  I applaud you for doing so.  You seem to be a sweet-heart.   We all <br/>
have our hang-ups.  But it&#39;s unfortunate when people feel they have to <br/>
impose their hang-ups on others.  (I&#39;ve been one of those kinds of people, <br/>
too.)   :(  :)   If you could be a light of kindness, gentleness and <br/>
graciousness in your neighborhood, I think you&#39;ll make a greater impact.  <br/>
Sometimes speaking our minds isn&#39;t wise.  Understanding where others are <br/>
coming from and trying to live peaceably (without making your chest a <br/>
welcome mat for everyone to wipe their feet on) is wise.<br/>
<br/>
Your neighbor was probably raised in harshness.  The fruit doesn&#39;t fall far <br/>
from the tree.  So, it&#39;d be nice if she could see an example (like you).  <br/>
Maybe she&#39;ll wanna break the cycle of violence in her own life one day.  Or, <br/>
maybe her kids will learn from your behavior that there is another way to <br/>
live.  Who can know?   Meanwhile, your kids are blessed with a Mom who&#39;s <br/>
just a sweetie.  :)   They have a great advantage growing up with you.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of smiles............Marcy<br/>
