YES!!  I&#39;ve had a similar discussion with my mom and she can&#39;t get away<br/>
from thinking that doctors and lawyers are &quot;smarter&quot; than auto mechanics.<br/>
 I heard a homeschooling mother say she&#39;s hs&#39;ing so her kids won&#39;t grow<br/>
up to be hairdressers.  If I had a child who loved doing things to hair,<br/>
I&#39;d be thrilled for them to make a career of it.  I hope my children <br/>
will *enjoy* whatever thing they choose to spend most of their time<br/>
doing.  Not that it will always be easy or fun, but that overall it will<br/>
give them pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
PS don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true, but I heard once that garbage collecters as a<br/>
group have a high level of job satisfaction bc they know their job is so<br/>
important!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200608416">I have always admired people who could do things well with their hands or their minds. I think our low opinions about people who do manual labor comes from the fact that it is getting increasingly more difficult to find the ones who do their work because they love it and not because they have no other option. There is nothing wrong with being a carpenter unless you do it because this was the only job you could get. It is the same way with people who get their MBA&#39;s only because they think they will make more money.<br/>
