  Well, my son finally decided he was ready to turn 6.  So we had his birthday <br/>
  party yesterday, birthday was in March.  Had a great time.  My 9 year old was <br/>
  outside in the AM and said &quot;you know mom....the air always smells better on a <br/>
  special day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  So sweet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752194722">HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  to your son   He picked the absolute perfect day to <br/>
celebrate his birthday .  The weather was finally wonderful ( as opposed to raining <br/>
and humid).   I think from now on, I will only pick perfect days to celebrate my <br/>
birthday, it just makes so much more sense.  :-)   <br/>
