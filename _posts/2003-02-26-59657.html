<div id="ygrps-yiv-421483079">I get this list in a daily digest in an attempt to stay caught up. Sometimes <br/>
halfway through the digest all the text becomes italicized. I don&#39;t know if <br/>
it&#39;s from someone quoting something in italics, but anything for the rest of <br/>
the email<br/>
-- even normal posts-- become italicized too. It can be hard to read. Am I <br/>
the only one this happens to or the only one it bothers? Any suggestions?  <br/>
Get over myself? LOL thanks<br/>

Switch to individual messages and set up a file in your email program to<br/>
automatically put all email with Unschooling-dotcom in the subject into your<br/>
Unschooling-dotcom folder.  Then, when you have time to read email from<br/>
Unschooling-dotcom, you can go to that folder and read and delete them one<br/>
message at a time.  So much easier and convenient than digest.  I used to<br/>
get dizzy scrolling through digests!<br/>

You could cut and paste the digest into a word file, select all, select <br/>
italics and then de-select italic.  You can put it in a word file and change <br/>
the font entirely.  Maybe you can set your e-mail program to show it in a <br/>
font which has easily-read italics.<br/>
<br/>
I get individual e-mails, and I KNOW that reading it at the site is a pain <br/>
and people who get digests complain a lot (and forward the rest of us junk, <br/>
and forget to make subject lines), so my best personal advice is for everyone <br/>
to go to individal e-mails and never complain ever again!   LOL!<br/>

scrolling making you dizzy is no exaggeration. I have had dizziness <br/>
problems and scrolling really stinks LOL<br/>

 Yep. I really need to go back to individual. I tend to get <br/>
overwhelmed, but there are many reasons I don&#39;t really like the <br/>
digests. One being too impatient to read responses to what I post. <br/>
The digests are sometimes a day behind. That&#39;s why I am replying from <br/>
the website. I haven&#39;t even gotten this digest yet &lt;g&gt;  You are on <br/>
AOL right? All my yahoo groups come through as default(arial) font. <br/>
Anyway to change that? Forgive my ignorance. <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693065415">And if you group them by conversation, you can actually go to edit, select all, and then delete full conversations with one click.<br/>
<br/>
It is MUCH faster and easier than digest.<br/>

Aol will save 1000 e-mail message in the regular inbox, won&#39;t it?  Or a <br/>
month&#39;s worth? Just take your time reading and let them sit til then!<br/>
