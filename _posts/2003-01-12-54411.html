<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The first time I saw a naked male body <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;was on my wedding night and I was most definitely not frightened <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;My mil hadn&#39;t been told anything about sex or male parts and had never seen <br/>
a <br/>
male body before she got married. I had some conversations with her about how <br/>
<br/>
very frightening the first night was and how she wished someone would have <br/>
been more open with her.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My mother was married for the first time at 17.  She had never had sex nor <br/>
seen a naked man. AND, ( get this, its unbelievable)  She STILL hadn&#39;t <br/>
actually seen a naked man when they divored a few years later.. ?!?!? She <br/>
said he insisted on keeping the lights off.. He undressed in the dark, got <br/>
into bed, and well, she never really &quot;saw&quot; him naked.  He ended up emptying <br/>
her her bank account and stealing her car.  She lived with her mil for 6 mos <br/>
til he came back.. She went back to him.. and in another few mos, he pulled <br/>
the same crap.. cept this time, it wasnt long til he got drafted.  She had <br/>
learned by the 2nd time that he duped her that he was bad news, but she <br/>
wouldnt give him a divorce while he was in the service because she recieved <br/>
spousal support.  ANYWAY. she also didnt sleep with my Dad ( her husband of <br/>
37 years) til they got married. <br/>
<br/>
I was a virgin at 17 when I met my husband.  We did sleep together after he <br/>
proposed to me.   I cant say only having sex with the man I married  was the <br/>
best thing.  I have very mixed feelings about it.  Being with only one man <br/>
has it definite rewards and lends a very  special bond.. But, well, it also <br/>
leaves a lot of questions and what ifs that we have both had to work through. <br/>
   I would definitly not condone &quot;sleeping around&quot; casually with multiple <br/>
partners.. And, I also wouldnt want my kids to have sex too young.   But, I <br/>
wouldnt want them to marry someone just so they could have sex with them.<br/>
