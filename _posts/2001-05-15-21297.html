<div id="ygrps-yiv-736388093">Hi Nicki,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this post a lot today.  You&#39;re in Ketchum,<br/>
right?  I went to elementary school at Hemingway.  It was a fair<br/>
experience (email me off-list for specifics, if you want).  I have<br/>
cousins that go to The Community School, and they like it, for the most<br/>
part.  In fact, I will be in Ketchum this weekend for a baby shower.<br/>
<br/>
I do not think it is coercive to tell your child everything you know<br/>
about kindergarten.  This includes the good.  Does she know she has to<br/>
get permission to go the bathroom, for example?  Does she know that she<br/>
cannot eat whenever she wants, that she will have to sit in one place<br/>
for a good portion of the day, that time with friends is very limited?<br/>
Does she know that there are plenty of opportunities to interact with<br/>
other children outside of school in classes, playdates, the park, etc.<br/>
If she knows all of these things, and she still wants to go to school,<br/>
maybe she&#39;d like you to schedule a time when the two of you could<br/>
observe the kindergarten classes in the area.  Maybe she needs to see it<br/>
for herself.  If she loves it, you can do lots of things to help her<br/>
have the best possible experience.  You can see how many days a week you<br/>
could volunteer in her class, join the PTA, send really great snacks,<br/>
get to know the children she likes so she has plenty of opportunities<br/>
outside of school to interact with them, etc.  Let her know that she is<br/>
welcome to come home whenever she wants.<br/>
<br/>
Utah allows homeschooled children access to public school activities and<br/>
certain classes, does Idaho?  If so, maybe she would like to go to<br/>
Kindergarten only on art days. Or assembly days.  Or PE days.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to her teacher and make sure she will have access to a telephone to<br/>
call you if and whenever she wants.<br/>

&gt;       How old is your dd? My 5 this wed. dd is now voicing that she<br/>
&gt; wants to<br/>
&gt; go to school. I am so bummed. I am having nightmares. I always said if<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; child wanted to go I would let s/he. I decided when I was very young I<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; school through life,I had no idea there was even such a thing as<br/>
&gt; unschooling,honestly. School was so bad for me I knew what would be<br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
&gt; Now what? I could cry thinking of it. I am afraid if she does attend<br/>
&gt; she&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; come out a different child. Or what if K is fun and she decideds to<br/>
&gt; keep<br/>
&gt; going and by say 8 wants out. Then I have 4 years to unravel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    This kid is so spirited and different I fear how it will go. She<br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; pretends to be a dog 1/2 the day and we have to call her Jenna the dog<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; treat her as a dog. She still occaisionally makes dog faces at mean<br/>
&gt; kids in<br/>
&gt; the playground. She really isn&#39;t an extrovert though the way she is w/<br/>
&gt; dh and<br/>
&gt; I you&#39;d think she was. She clams up w/ other kids and adults. This is<br/>
&gt; fine by<br/>
&gt; us and we understand her personality. I can see the first time she<br/>
&gt; gets told<br/>
&gt; to not do something or corrected.she will be crushed. I am so<br/>
&gt; concerned for<br/>
&gt; her self esteem. School ruined me along w/ my mother&#39;s controling I<br/>
&gt; became<br/>
&gt; someone else to make it through.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I would love to go off on why she doesn&#39;t want to go but I feel<br/>
&gt; that would<br/>
&gt; be brainwashing or coersive. What to do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Any advice? NICKI~ </span></blockquote></div>
