<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314417730">Our unschooling approach is to expose our children to as wide a variety of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448169879">I am currently taking a &quot;course&quot; from Gordon Neufeld, a developmental (with<br/>
attachment being the center piece) and clinical psychologist and from his point<br/>
of view ( and I am in agreement) our emphasis on stimulation is vastly overdone.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that we should support our children&#39;s enthusiasms and our own interests<br/>
and passions. At the same time I think that, in fact, providing a stable, deep<br/>
connection with our children is the paramount task.  I think caution is advised<br/>
when it comes to the idea of &quot;flooding&quot; their brains.  Children require lots of<br/>
reflective, unorganized, idle, &quot;down&quot; time to develop.  Our stimulus mad society<br/>
has in fact flooded children with a jittery mass of shiny, bauble filled<br/>
stimulation and they suffer terribly as a result.<br/>
<br/>
Of course going places is good.  Seeing lots of the world is good. Stimulation<br/>
is good AND laying around the house, playing in a desultory, ambling,<br/>
undirected, relaxed, nowhere to go and &quot;nothing&quot; to do sort of fashion is truly,<br/>
really, equally good.<br/>
<br/>
Packed platters are great for a feast but it is possible to overeat.  ( I am not<br/>
suggesting that your particular example is necessarily one of these excessive<br/>
banquets).<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Neufeld believes that we got completely carried away with a few pieces of<br/>
research about the value of stimulation and (imo in our typical western fashion)<br/>
went to a grotesque extreme.<br/>

always on the go either.  We do love our quiet evenings in, which are most<br/>
of the evenings in the week.  It&#39;s really an attitude more than how we use<br/>

Whoo! I am glad to hear someone say this! My kids love having all that <br/>
nothing-to-do time! Sometimes I think we do miss out on some stuff, but they <br/>
do just fine with bringing the world to them little pieces at a time. That is <br/>
just what works for us. <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
getting better grades, getting into college, or getting a &quot;good job,&quot; is the<br/>
<br/>
type of stimulation we could do without. &gt;&gt;<br/>
  <br/>
but also the type that has us react to and fill our unschooling lives with <br/>
any good sounding option.  i have known many hsing moms burn out by taking <br/>
advantage of all the many educational opp.&#39;s in the area.  i am referring to <br/>
all really good sounding opportunities!  it can really be a struggle for moms <br/>
to not step into the busyness and instead embrace the value of downtime.  i <br/>
am so glad that i have had the chance to try and then love the &quot;mostly home&quot; <br/>
model as opposed to the &quot;running to a class/fieldtrip, etc&quot; each day of the <br/>
wk.  having several children tends to make it both harder to get out the door <br/>
while simultaneously attracting you to the different activities that peak the <br/>
interests of the different people in the household.  so it causes us to <br/>
really remain in the more thoughtful mode before rushing out to sign up for <br/>
the latest exciting class...<br/>
<br/>
along the same lines, unschoolers might be more likely to sign up for more <br/>
things because of the lack of structured lessontime that other hsing fam&#39;s <br/>
have.  but doing that puts us at risk for not knowing as well where we are <br/>
with things (eg. what kids true interests are, how they are really <br/>
understanding concepts that they come across in everyday life, etc.)  i find <br/>
that when we fall into that busy schedule pace we dont have time for the <br/>
discussions and sinking in of concepts and later resurfacing thoughts that <br/>
reaffirm to me/us we are all really learning...<br/>

    It&#39;s funny but I have always been a very busy person. (I have 6 kids,4 <br/>
now at home) However not until I decided to hs did I realize how little of a <br/>
life I had. I have great kids and am in a wonderful marriage but when I <br/>
wanted to unschool I realized that you really need an interesting life to be <br/>
able to share that with your kids.<br/>
    I don&#39;t mean that I needed to be constantly busy with something but I had <br/>
over the years let so many of my interests dwindle.  I had been a <br/>
professional crafter for the last several years and was very ready to get <br/>
out. All of a sudden I realized that I had no life.LOL <br/>
    Now I am in the process of putting my real life back together. We do go <br/>
on field trips and visit the library, go shopping etc. However the great part <br/>
is the life we are developing again. The two younger boys and I decided at <br/>
10:00 last night to take a walk. My husband is even relaxing a bit, he didn&#39;t <br/>
act as though I was crazy.<br/>
    We had a great time. Doing nothing really. we took a flashlight and <br/>
watched our breath in the light, looked at the stars and discussed the houses <br/>
they trick or treated at. They asked if we could do this every night. As I am <br/>
beginning to realize it takes very little to have a life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013233263">I think you have touched on some of the core issues Laura.  A simpler, relaxed,<br/>
full of interests life is what it is about.  The interests however need to spring<br/>
from the heart and not just be imposed interests from someone else.  I am<br/>
inspired by your account.  I know I have let many past interests atrophy to a<br/>
certain extent mostly because of having to do the money earning thing for my<br/>
family.  Salaried employment occupies so much time. It has its own interests so I<br/>
am not horrendously bored by my work but I want more time. Reflective time.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters really love to go for neighborhood walks.  They would always go<br/>
longer and farther than me because I am usually tired.  I never want to do it as<br/>
much as they do and yet the walks we have had are usually very pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lesson here for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838693554">laura, love this shared thought!  it is so true, that being busy is different <br/>
than having a life!  thanks for the reflection.  i guess it says well what i <br/>
was trying to say in one of my last posts about the joy of being at home, <br/>
rather than busy.  but you seemed to say it clearly.  it feels so much <br/>
richer, less shallow...<br/>
