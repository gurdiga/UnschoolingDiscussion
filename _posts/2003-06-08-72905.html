<div id="ygrps-yiv-57631141">I was just thinking about having folks over and how everyone&#39;s family is <br/>
different, does things differently, expects different &quot;behavior&quot;... And all of the <br/>
ressponses about Hiedi&#39;s situation.. how the kid will probably adjust his <br/>
behavior to fit in with her family.. And I realized how often my kids have to <br/>
adjust thier behavior when they are at someone elses house. <br/>
<br/>
   Even thier aunts, uncles, and cousins may do things differently than we <br/>
do.  My sister &quot;requires/makes&quot; her kids pick up thier toys from one activity <br/>
before they go on to another one. So, when my kids are over there, they have to <br/>
do that too.  They have the option of either playing by Judys rules, or not <br/>
going over to play with thier cousins. They don&#39;t like the pick up rule, but <br/>
they like playing with thier cousins a lot more than they dislike the rule.   <br/>
Anna once had a friend whose family was fundamentalist Christian,and she had to <br/>
&quot;fit in&quot; thier family if she wanted to go over there.   She really liked the <br/>
little girl and had a great time with her, but she didn&#39;t like all the chores <br/>
and rules and weird stuff thier mom made them do.   She would complain, or <br/>
discuss her disappointment with me, about the stuff at Jessica&#39;s house.  I always <br/>
told her.. &quot;well, you dont HAVE to go over there, you can always say &quot;no&quot; you <br/>
dont want to come&quot;  I even gave her an out.. she could always say that I said <br/>
&quot;no&quot;  and give some excuse about going somewhere or something.   But, she <br/>
usually opted to go over to Jessicas house and just put up with the stuff.    Well, <br/>
now that I think about it.. Jessica was over at our house a LOT more than <br/>
Anna was over at hers :-)    <br/>
