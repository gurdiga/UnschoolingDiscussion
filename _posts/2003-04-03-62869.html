&gt; I just want to say something else that I&#39;ve been mulling over in my<br/>
&gt; mind.  Isolated nuclear families are a very recent development in<br/>
&gt; human evolution.  I don&#39;t think that it necessarily reflects poorly<br/>
&gt; on a parent if the kids have a hard time of living in this way-<br/>
&gt; being only around their siblings for days on end.  If we lived in a<br/>
&gt; tribe, or had a sense of an immediate larger community right outside<br/>
&gt; our door, it would be different- there would always be another adult<br/>
&gt; handy if two children who couldn&#39;t stand being together every<br/>
&gt; instant *also* both wanted an adult&#39;s company.  There would always<br/>
&gt; be other children as buffers and distractions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree and we&#39;ve really seen how well the tribe situation works when our<br/>
group of homeschoolers goes camping together (which is usually at least once<br/>
a week during the summer). With the tents in a big circle and the kids<br/>
roaming in the grass and trees and sand and streams, there&#39;s rarely a harsh<br/>
word said or a need to intervene in anything. The moms can cook, clean,<br/>
chat, read books, it&#39;s so stress-free! Just glance up and make sure the kids<br/>
are all accounted for, put a bandaid on a hurt knee or snuggle with a kid in<br/>
a chair who wants their mom and then they run back to the group or groups of<br/>
kids. I&#39;m always amazed at how few problems there are between kids in a<br/>
tribe situation. Put those same kids and same loving moms in an isolated<br/>
house for just a few hours and all hell breaks loose. I just don&#39;t think<br/>
we&#39;re meant to live that way.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re fortunate in that we&#39;re part of an &quot;intentional neighborhood&quot; where we<br/>
know our neighbors, have weekly potlucks and get-togethers, etc. The kids<br/>
all know all the adults and feel safe going in and out of houses. I think it<br/>
makes a huge difference when children feel that they&#39;re a part of a larger<br/>
community.<br/>
