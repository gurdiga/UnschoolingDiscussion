<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215042126">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember who was asking about this movie but I went to our <br/>
library on-line and here is what I found :)<br/>
<br/>
I found that it was origanally released in 1981 but I found a DVD <br/>
that was done in 2002 (re-done??) so for kicks and giggles I ordered <br/>
it for my 7 year old son Joey.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the description of the movie that they wrote:<br/>
<br/>
Peseus(Hamlin), the mortal son of Zeus(Oliver), faces the monsters <br/>
of Greek mythology as he battles to save Andromeda(Bowker) from a <br/>
primeval sea beast.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps you - I order what ever movies I can from the <br/>
library because they are free !! If I have to wait that&#39;s okay I <br/>
don&#39;t mind and I can do it on-line and THAT is a beautiful thing.  <br/>
No extra trip to the video store AND I go to the library every week <br/>
anyway so it isn&#39;t an extra trip for me.  <br/>
<br/>
You can ask your local library if you can access them on-line - <br/>
technology today is wonderful.  <br/>
<br/>
I just ordered Finding Nemo - I checked for it and Walla !!! They <br/>
had it !!! <br/>
We didn&#39;t run to the movies for this one but I keep a list of <br/>
things I do want to see so I have an idea of what I want when I go <br/>
shopping @ the library :)<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say I don&#39;t ever go to the movies - the other day my <br/>
son said on a whim that he wanted to go to the movies.  So we did - <br/>
and we saw the movie Brother Bear.  I loved it and as always it <br/>
brought tears to my eyes.  Those Disney movies get me every time <br/>
LOL....................................<br/>

inter-library loans. <br/>
  Speaking of Brother Bear, I wanted to take the kids to see it today and <br/>
there are no daytime showings during the week, only night-time. Rats! Also found <br/>
that it&#39;s $5.75 per person before 5:00, including kids, not to mention the <br/>
expensive popcorn, pop, etc...This may be an expensive little outing! <br/>

or get it from the library - I can&#39;t wait until finding Nemo comes <br/>
in/ LOL..........................................<br/>

<br/>
We have been doing &quot;popcorn innoculation&quot; here before movies.  I pop <br/>
microwave popcorn and we get sodas out of the garage, and on the way to the movie we <br/>
eat popcorn and drink soda.  When we get there, we smell it but eh, we just had <br/>
some.  WAY, way cheaper.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah Sandra we sort of do the same but we take it one step <br/>
further !! I take my big purse in that has everything inside it<br/>
(popcorn and soda) - I also make the kids clean up their trash. I <br/>
also stop off @ the Shell Gas station and let each child pick out a <br/>
candy :)  They love it it&#39;s a ritual. It&#39;s way to exspensive to buy <br/>
it there and my kids want to enjoy it when the others are :)<br/>
