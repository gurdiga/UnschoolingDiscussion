&gt; How did you manage this?<br/>
&gt; I would like to go chemical free, but am not sure if this is possible.<br/>
&gt; Do you know where I could research this more?<br/>

I had a landscape company down in Louisiana. . . but I was not very <br/>
knowledgable about the ecology of ponds, however, I know the fish ate the <br/>
mosquito larvae. . . as far as what I did when the pond got green. . . I <br/>
pumped the water out to water the garden and started over :) It was not a <br/>
huge pond. . . I guess about 9 by 9 maybe. For the most part it stayed pretty <br/>
clear. We pumped it out a couple of times a year I guess. As far as research, <br/>
I would probably go to a search engine and type in ponds and go from there. <br/>
And I&#39;m sure the library would have some books you could take out on it, and <br/>
of course, your local book store. And try your local nursery. . . you may be <br/>
able to get some good advice, although some of it would be about chemicals I <br/>
suppose. . . maybe Organic Gardening has a web site with some info on it too. <br/>
Let me know how it goes. . . I plan on putting in one here at my new house <br/>
sometime next year probably.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321128133">A submersible pump to keep the water moving will help keep the algae<br/>
levels down so it doesn&#39;t go green.  But that means you have to have<br/>
electric out to your pond.  Anyway, that&#39;s how we keep Esmarelda&#39;s (the<br/>
turtle) pond clear.<br/>

have the right ecology of the pond and that changes all the time. I really <br/>
wish just a pump would do it, but that is not the case.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624076800">No a pump won&#39;t do it alone but if your pond is too small to get a good<br/>
balance it will help a lot.  Ours is a 50 gallon pond liner set up in the<br/>
florida room so we weren&#39;t really looking for a great balance as we<br/>
consider this temporary until we can build on outside for real.  <br/>
