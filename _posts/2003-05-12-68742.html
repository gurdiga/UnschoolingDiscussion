<div id="ygrps-yiv-939838942">okay, I really need some help, it&#39;s been a really bad and long <br/>
weekend and I just don&#39;t have any other place to turn.<br/>
<br/>
On thursday a friend of mine and her kids dd5 and ds7months came over <br/>
to play, everything was going wonderfully until, Jaiden decided that <br/>
he wanted to give the baby his bottle, and Erika(the mom) didn&#39;t want <br/>
Jaiden to, the baby gets colic and has to be fed a certain way, she <br/>
kept trying to get JAiden to give her back the bottle and he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
and was turning it into a wrestling match, I was in the bedroom <br/>
laying Avery down(I had just fininshed nurcing him and he had nodded <br/>
off) so I wasn&#39;t able to step in until the situation had already <br/>
escalated. I gently removedJaidens hand from the bottle and asked him <br/>
to come sit with me in the rocking chair, he turned to me screamed <br/>
that he hated me, spit at me, and ran and locked himself in his room.<br/>
he&#39;s 4. Honestly, it was all I could do to keep from marching in <br/>
there and spanking him. We stoped spanking and I have been fighting <br/>
with Jason lately over the decision, this is not the first time <br/>
Jaiden has done something like this, although, this has been the <br/>
worst, thus far.<br/>
<br/>
JAson feels like that we stoped spanking and have since let jaiden <br/>
run over us, and I guess its true.  I have been trying so hard to <br/>
look the other way and accept the fact that he has to test us, and <br/>
see if we would take it back and start spanking again, and we haven&#39;t <br/>
not that I haven&#39;t been tempted(I&#39;m really embaressed to admit it, <br/>
but it&#39;s true) and I have steped in and kept Jason a few times. <br/>
<br/>
This is becoming a problem between me and Jason, he doesn&#39;t like the <br/>
way JAiden is treating me and the fact that he absolutly will not <br/>
listen to anything Jason will say, something that bothers JAson soooo <br/>
much. Jason is willing to belive me that not spanking will work and <br/>
that we won&#39;t have out of control kids that are major problems, we <br/>
have a friend that dosen&#39;t spank and her son is violent towards her, <br/>
his sister and pretty much everyone and it is just ignored and jason <br/>
doesn&#39;t want that. ummm oh yah, so JAson is willing to not spank, as <br/>
hard as he sometimes finds it, because I keep telling him that I <br/>
don&#39;t want our kids spanked and I feel really strongly about it but, <br/>
he keeps asking what it is that we should be doing. And honestly, I&#39;m <br/>
at a loss, I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read that we should have principles instead of rules, but how do <br/>
you make the switch? How do you explain to a 4yr. old? Jaiden keeps <br/>
saying that he&#39;s the boss and that no one can make him do anything, <br/>
so he&#39;s gonna do what ever he wants. In lots of ways it is fine, he <br/>
can eat when he wants to, he can go to bed when he wants to...but I <br/>
don&#39;t think he should spit in my face, am I wrong? So how do I do it, <br/>
how do we make the switch? I know that there is no instant cure for <br/>
all of this, but we are struggling and things are bad and I&#39;ve tried <br/>
talking to friends and family and I get &#39;spank him&#39; or &#39;just ignor it&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry this is so long and all over the place but Avery is really <br/>
sick and I&#39;ve had to stop about 20 times and I keep looseing my train <br/>
of thought, so if anyone made it to the end of this, I thank you.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Is just ignored&quot; is not the opposite of &quot;never spanked.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve read that we should have principles instead of rules, but how do <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Have all the rules you want if that&#39;s what you&#39;re used to doing.  But based <br/>
on your principles, you might want to soften some of the rules, gradually, as <br/>
you get used to doing things.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re driving a standard transmission car, do you have the clutch all <br/>
the way in, or all the way out?   Do you let the clutch out and then push the <br/>
gas pedal?  Do you push the gas all the way while the clutch is in?  WHAT?  <br/>
WHAT?  WHAT?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like that.<br/>
<br/>
If you dump your rules before you HAVE principles, your car won&#39;t go.<br/>
If you keep your rules and try to apply your principles in the presence of <br/>
arbitrary rules and punishments, your car will make no progress, and you&#39;ll <br/>
waste a bunch of gas and flood the carburetor.<br/>
<br/>
The analogy is ended.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Jaiden keeps <br/>
<br/>
saying that he&#39;s the boss and that no one can make him do anything, <br/>
<br/>
so he&#39;s gonna do what ever he wants. In lots of ways it is fine, he <br/>
<br/>
can eat when he wants to, he can go to bed when he wants to...but I <br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t think he should spit in my face, am I wrong?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you tell him he was the boss of eating and going to bed?<br/>
<br/>
You let the clutch out before you had any acceleration?  (The analogy has <br/>
risen again.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve tried <br/>
<br/>
talking to friends and family and I get &#39;spank him&#39; or &#39;just ignor it&#39;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Talk about it calmly to him.  <br/>
Ask him what he would do if he were the mom or dad.<br/>
Distract him with interesting stuff to see or do.<br/>
Ask him to hold your hand, or to show you his toes, or something that keeps <br/>
him close but doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;You come sit RIGHT BY ME, young man...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas should be by here soon.<br/>

<br/>
I think just holding him and talking calmly with him.    Let your calmness<br/>
overflow onto him.   That&#39;s what I would do with my son when he was that<br/>
age.   You could almost see the change.  The agressiveness/tension would<br/>
just melt away.<br/>
<br/>
And if you are switching your parenting style,  its going to take some time<br/>
for it to sink into your lives.   I know for us it has also been slow going,<br/>
but it is going.  I can see small, but good steps.    Just eliminating the<br/>
spanking is huge!  That&#39;s great.<br/>
<br/>
I also would explain things to my son when he was quite young and it was<br/>
amazing how much he understood.   I was thinking about the bottle incident.<br/>
Some people would question me in talking this resonably with a 3 or 4 year<br/>
old,  they didn&#39;t think it was worth it.  But then they would ask me how he<br/>
was so well-behaved?<br/>
<br/>
You are going in the right direction,    tell your husband that it will take<br/>
some time to see all the benefits.   I bet if you look at things closely<br/>
you&#39;ll see some good small changes already.     It will be so worth your<br/>
time in the end,  you&#39;ll have children that will come to you and talk to<br/>
you, you&#39;ll have a great relationship.<br/>

<br/>
I like that.<br/>
And if he&#39;s still flailing and yelling, hold him with his back to you, and if <br/>
you can do it, take him outside to do something real, like check the mailbox, <br/>
or move the water in the yard, or throw a frisbee for the dog a few times.  <br/>
He&#39;ll be away from the stress, in the wind and sunshine or rain or whatever <br/>
(new and better oxygen), and he&#39;ll be alone with you without being &quot;in time <br/>
out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve told my kids in various bits and parts over the years is that <br/>
I&#39;m risking the wrath of friends and relatives by giving them some of the <br/>
power and privilege that the government and the culture gives me.  I&#39;ve just <br/>
SAID that the county expects me to feed them and make sure they have clothes <br/>
on, and I&#39;m willing to give them a ton of say in that but they can&#39;t get me <br/>
in trouble, because some people would NOT be thinking it was okay that they <br/>
had so much freedom.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d remind them that the freedom was given because I WANTED to give it to <br/>
them, but there were some realities about my responsibilities LEGALLY so we <br/>
always needed to take that into consideration.<br/>
<br/>
I can take them beyond the short arm of the school, but not beyond the long <br/>
arm of the law.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740675406">&lt;&lt;In lots of ways it is fine, he<br/>
can eat when he wants to, he can go to bed when he wants to...but I<br/>
don&#39;t think he should spit in my face, am I wrong?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, you are not wrong.  He shouldn&#39;t be spitting in anyones face! :)  I&#39;m <br/>
going to make a gentle assumption here to make my response flow in a more <br/>
understandable way...<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are in the same place I was/am.  Once I stopped spanking <br/>
and punishments in general, I went a bit overboard and decided anything and <br/>
everything had to go.  I was revamping the ship and startin from scratch.  <br/>
The problem with that is my children were used to being punished and <br/>
spanked.  I made the mistake of not listening to myself.  I just kind of up <br/>
and let everything go cold turkey.  Some things, like smoking habits and <br/>
spanking are excellent things to go cold turkey on but rythyms and disipline <br/>
aren&#39;t.  Children still need guidance and limits.<br/>
<br/>
When I cut out my little ones bedtimes (which are flexiblebut no later than <br/>
9pm), quiet times and general mealtimes, they went haywire.  I made the <br/>
mistake of thinking that gentle parenting, peaceful parenting, whatever term <br/>
you use, meant total and complete freedom.  I set aside my own inner voice <br/>
and listened to other people that were on the opposite extreme of where I <br/>
was.  Many of whom led completely child-centered lives.  By that I mean, if <br/>
their child refused to ride in a carseat, either they wouldn&#39;t leave the <br/>
house or they would let their child roam free in the car.  (This was an <br/>
example given to me at one time.)  I went against *my* inner voice and chose <br/>
not to leave the house, because I certainly wasn&#39;t going to allow my 18 <br/>
month old son ride around in the car jumping up in my lap!  I soon figured <br/>
out that I was going to have to insist on car seats but I found ways of <br/>
keeping him occupied so he wasn&#39;t miserable.  It worked.  There were <br/>
occasions when he would climb out so I pulled over and either let him run <br/>
around in the van for a while or gave him something new to distract him.<br/>
<br/>
I think the key with Jaiden (sorry but I think I may have misspelled his <br/>
name) is to give him limits and guidance.  I realize you weren&#39;t in the room <br/>
at the time, so in that case, I would have explained to him, in front of the <br/>
offended, that when he is asked to return someones belongings, in this case <br/>
the bottle, he needs to give it back, otherwise he will have to stay with <br/>
Mommy while the baby and her mommy are visiting.  At that point, I might <br/>
have also offered him his own baby doll to feed.  As far as spitting in your <br/>
face, I would let him know that it isn&#39;t okay to spit on other people and if <br/>
he feels angry, he can talk about it and go outside and spit in the grass if <br/>
he feels like he needs to.  This way, he has the opportunity to let out his <br/>
frustrations without harming other people.  The *I hate you* stage is pretty <br/>
normal, I think and I would respond that I understand you are upset so why <br/>
don&#39;t we go spend some time outside together and we can talk about it.  If <br/>
he doesn&#39;t wnt to talk about it, try spitting in the grass with him!  He&#39;s <br/>
young and probably felt like he was trying to help the baby.  When the <br/>
struggle ensued, he most likely became confused and frustrated.  And hey, if <br/>
you go spit with him, you will most likely both end up laughing.  You <br/>
offered clear boundries (we return other peoples belongings when asked, we <br/>
don&#39;t spit on other people), allowed him to vent his anger and frustrations <br/>
(voicing his feelings and spitting on the ground), and you can now enjoy <br/>
each others company again (spitting together and laughing).<br/>
<br/>
I hope all this made sense!  My kids are turning on the waterhose so I have <br/>
to save my hanging laundry and hit send.......<br/>

I JUST got done saying a variation of this to James (the 7 year old from the<br/>

more, if I could.  He&#39;s a smart, capable kid who I trust.  In this case,<br/>

Depending on the kid, the park, the town, etc., this might or might not be <br/>
useful advice:<br/>
<br/>
I have let a kid stay in the car, with a book or a puzzle or paper and pens, <br/>
if he didn&#39;t want to play, usually with the car door open and me not too far <br/>
away.  Often they would come out, or other kids would go over and at least <br/>
visit him in there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154608577">I think it&#39;s really wonderful you stopped spanking.   No good thing ever<br/>
happened because a big person hit a little one.  Not ever.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s very small.   He doesn&#39;t understand all the nuances of human<br/>
communication yet, but he&#39;s putting great effort into communicating with<br/>
you.    You may not like the method he&#39;s using right now, he probably<br/>
isn&#39;t happy with it either, but for what ever reason it&#39;s the only way he<br/>
feels he can reach you.<br/>
<br/>
In every moment I can ever remember when Dylan&#39;s behavior was something I<br/>
didn&#39;t like it was because I was parenting badly.  Every time, without<br/>
exception.   I missed his cues about being hungry, or tired or stressed<br/>
or overly stimulated, or his need to be cuddled or whatever it was.  If<br/>
we are parenting badly how can we expect them to respond in the best<br/>
ways?<br/>
I&#39;m not making a judgement about your parenting, I&#39;m just suggesting you<br/>
look at how you&#39;re interacting with him, communicating with him and see<br/>
if there is something you can help him with.   Does he need more of your<br/>
time, more ideas about feeling good about himself and his family?  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s little.   He just plain doesn&#39;t have all the information and tools<br/>
about communication someone your age has.   <br/>
<br/>
And please remember he doesn&#39;t want you to feel bad about him.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to feel bad about you.   He must have a powerful need to<br/>
express himself to you for whatever reason.   <br/>
<br/>
This behavior you don&#39;t like is not because you&#39;re not spanking any more.<br/>
  It&#39;s because he&#39;s needing something, and trying to express it and<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a better way to do it at the moment.   <br/>
<br/>
Stay warm and loving to him and spend time with him whenever you can.  <br/>
In happy times make sure he knows you like to be with him and in his<br/>
difficult moments make sure he know you love him no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
Try to understand he&#39;s behaving exactly the way he&#39;s able to right now.  <br/>
Imagine how frustrating things must be for him to be feeling this way.  <br/>
He&#39;s doing the best he can. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll play the imagination game.  Maybe everything wasn&#39;t as fine as<br/>
you thought that day.  Maybe there were little problems with your friend<br/>
or her kid and Jaiden did his best to cope, but when you were out of the<br/>
room, away from him, he was on his own with these people who were maybe<br/>
getting on his nerves.    Maybe he thought he was being friendly and kind<br/>
to give the baby the bottle.   Maybe it seemed an insult for your friend<br/>
to oppose him.   Maybe all he needed was a reason the baby couldn&#39;t have<br/>
the bottle but he just got a bossy &quot;stop that&quot; from the mom. <br/>
<br/>
How much do you talk to him about feelings and love and family and<br/>
happiness?    <br/>
<br/>
***How do you explain to a 4yr. old?***<br/>
<br/>
This kind of stands out in your post, and I wonder how you communicate<br/>
with him.   How would you explain to anyone?   Do you tell him it&#39;s not<br/>
nice to spit and that you wouldn&#39;t spit on him?    Does he get<br/>
explanations for why some things aren&#39;t nice?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra said it somewhere, this is just a glimpse of a little part of who<br/>
he is right now, this isn&#39;t the whole of him. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got a few thoughts on this one, because I have a very fiery daughter<br/>
who will be four this fall. She&#39;s quite a handful! I think the number one<br/>
thing that helps in situations like you are discussing is just to first try<br/>
to see things from her standpoint. What does she know about this situation?<br/>
How does she feel? Would she know that feeding the baby wrong give it colic?<br/>
Even if she knew that, would she be able to control her urge to keep holding<br/>
onto that bottle. Or if she&#39;s mad, can she really possess the self-control<br/>
to contain it? I can&#39;t always do that, it&#39;s a tall order for a 3 or 4 year<br/>
old! So once I&#39;m in that headspace of &quot;What is my child feeling?&quot; instead of<br/>
&quot;my child is misbehaving&quot;, I can try to let go of my own fear, anger,<br/>
embarassment, or whatever is going to make me react to this situation<br/>
instead of helping my daughter learn, which is really what I want.<br/>
<br/>
What I would do in this situation is to explain why the baby needs its<br/>
bottle and needs its mom to feed it to her. If my daughter is still angry<br/>
about that, I would offer to hold her or help her move through the anger,<br/>
but I would remove her from the baby if she was causing it to get fussy and<br/>
have problems feeding. I might suggest something like getting a water bottle<br/>
or cup and feeding one of her own dolls or stuffed animals. My daughter&#39;s<br/>
still nursing, so I&#39;d definitely suggest that as a way for her to calm down.<br/>
I might find a way to give her some power back, because losing control over<br/>
the bottle is losing power and small kids I think feel quite powerless. Even<br/>
if we parent them respectfully and they get more power than other small kids<br/>
(like determining food and bedtime), they still can&#39;t go where they want<br/>
when they want and do everything they want, they depend on us for<br/>
transportation, providing food, etc. It&#39;s got to be hard at times.<br/>
<br/>
So, to use an example that happened when a friend of mine was over here<br/>
watching my kids yesterday: My daughter (3) and her daughter (4) were having<br/>
a tussle over a toy. My daughter was lying on the floor and screaming and<br/>
being angry about it and in general being a 3 year old. My friend suggested<br/>
reading a book, and asked my daughter if she wanted to pick the book out or<br/>
have her brother pick it out. My daughter leaped off of the floor and said<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll pick it out!&quot; and Bingo, tantrum over. She got to do something fun,<br/>
she was given power when she was feeling powerless (not being able to<br/>
totally control a toy that her friend had). Sounds like a good solution to<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In lots of ways it is fine, he<br/>
&gt;can eat when he wants to, he can go to bed when he wants to...but I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t think he should spit in my face, am I wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely not! If my kids are mad and do something that&#39;s not appropriate,<br/>
I just tell them &quot;You can be as mad as you want, but you cannot &lt;&lt;spit in my<br/>
face, hit your sister with that baseball bat, throw a rock at the dog,<br/>
whatever&gt;&gt;&quot;. I give them alternatives: &quot;You can throw this pillow at me!&quot; or<br/>
something like that, or I tell them that I can hug them if they want that<br/>
(my son usually does, my daughter doesn&#39;t). But keep in mind that you cannot<br/>
*make* your child not spit at you. Sure, you can throw consequences at him -<br/>
time-outs, spankings, etc. but he still might do it the next time he gets<br/>
mad and then you have to keep escalating the consequences until he reaches<br/>
that point some day where he is too big to hit or control and then where are<br/>
you? Instead, if you build a relationship of trust *now*, by the time he is<br/>
big, he will trust you with situations he can&#39;t handle.<br/>
<br/>
I do tell my kids my expectations for appropriate behavior: &quot;It&#39;s not okay<br/>
to spit at someone, if you&#39;re feeling that angry you can do X, Y, or Z&quot;)<br/>
I tell them my feelings: &quot;I don&#39;t like to be spit on, that doesn&#39;t feel nice<br/>
to me.&quot;<br/>
I might even set my own limits: &quot;I am not going to stand near you while<br/>
you&#39;re spitting.&quot; or &quot;You can spit outside, but not inside. Would you like<br/>
to go spit at a tree?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll recommend again the book &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline&quot; and<br/>
have your husband read it too if you can. It gives excellent descriptions of<br/>
alternatives to punitive parenting. It gives a step-by-step road map to get<br/>
there from where you are. It&#39;s an excellent book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132157194">I just wanted to thank everyone for their kind responses, I&#39;m going to go to the library as soon as Avery is well enough to go out to get the book recomendation (thanx Robin) I&#39;m going to keep trying to see things from his perspective and breath. I&#39;m thinking that some of it was to much excitement and he also seems to be getting sick so... anyways, I&#39;ve been on the &#39;puter a lot the past few days but not really able to type much and I had wanted to address a couple of the different posts but I dumped my saved email and I&#39;m not up to the archives right now. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry about this post but I&#39;m still lacking in sleep, but I wanted to say thanx.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know I&#39;m DAYS behind in my email, but I want to thank Deb for this.  It <br/>
really spoke to me.  I&#39;m a recovering yeller and can usually trace our <br/>
difficulties to a pre-yelling moment.  We&#39;ve needed to spend time de-yelling <br/>
and sometimes fall off the bandwagon.  Maybe the mom of the original post <br/>
needs to spend time in de-spanking land?<br/>
<br/>
Deb L also wrote a great bit about kids and housework a while (some months) <br/>
ago.  It might help the mom of the teenagers to search the archieves for it.  <br/>
It helped me lots.<br/>
