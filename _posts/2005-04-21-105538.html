<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347763711">I&#39;m really trying to fully understand unschooling - it&#39;s scary!  I <br/>
have really backed off my daughter.  She has shown me a few times <br/>
already that if she&#39;s interested in something she&#39;ll put 100% into it <br/>
and enjoy it.  I&#39;ve decided (with her approval) that I will cut out <br/>
any articles out of the paper that might interest her, let her know <br/>
of upcoming shows on the History channel etc... that might interest <br/>
her that we could record and I let her &quot;pack her own backpack of <br/>
things to do&quot; when she goes to work with me at my parents (her <br/>
grandparents).  <br/>
<br/>
So...this is what the past two weeks have been like:  I have a small <br/>
stack of newspaper articles that she hasn&#39;t expressed an interest in <br/>
yet, I&#39;ve recorded probably 8 shows she said she be interested in but <br/>
hasn&#39;t wanted to watch them yet, she decided she&#39;d like to work more <br/>
on girl scout stuff so I got that all figured out and helped her get <br/>
started and she hasn&#39;t done anything else with it.. All she is doing <br/>
is staying up late playing a &quot;medieval&quot; type role playing games on <br/>
the computer, sleeping in late, getting up just in time for chorus at <br/>
school at 2pm, home and back on the computer, I will give her major <br/>
credit for one thing - she&#39;s actually reading for pleasure - BIG <br/>
ACHIEVMENT!!!!  I&#39;m so proud of her.  But that&#39;s it - computer games, <br/>
reading, sleeping & chorus.... She is really really into the <br/>
computer, she says she&#39;d love to think about getting into some kind <br/>
of field relating to computer security so I try to look at her 7 <br/>
hours a day on the computer as &quot;okay&quot;, I am proud of the reading but <br/>
she&#39;s not giving herself any time to become interested in anything <br/>
else.  Just being exposed to life is teaching her a lot too I think, <br/>
she&#39;s around an uncle that is recovering from prescription drug <br/>
abuse, a great grandmother with heart problems that are discussed on <br/>
a daily basis, being involved and helping in a small family run a/c <br/>
business etc..... but I still worry!  Sometimes I think I should <br/>
really limit the computer time but being on the computer has been her <br/>
passion for going on a year now....<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions???? Is what I&#39;ve described unschooling?  I do I know <br/>
she&#39;ll ever want to do anything else????  Heck, If I had a choice, <br/>
I&#39;d rather play on the computer and read all day too.......</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526692518">She is 12, has vision problems, and has been out of school ONLY since <br/>
October. Plus she has to pack up stuff to take with her when you take <br/>
her with you to work. She had low self-esteem - which is why you took <br/>
her out of school.<br/>
<br/>
AND - she&#39;s an extreme night owl, probably partly vision-related <br/>
reasons and, it sounds like, just because that is her personal nature.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE listen to this:  start summer vacation right now.<br/>
<br/>
Spend the &quot;summer&quot; (meaning from now until September) just having fun <br/>
together. Don&#39;t try to get her to learn anything at all. (I&#39;d like to <br/>
say, &quot;Try to stop her,&quot; but I won&#39;t go quite that far &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, don&#39;t take any action or say anything to her that is <br/>
designed to get her to learn anything. Instead of finding articles or <br/>
videos that you think &quot;should&quot; interest her, just get movies that you <br/>
know she&#39;ll enjoy. (Have you seen &quot;Spirited Away?&quot; or &quot;Kiki&#39;s Delivery <br/>
Service?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not seeing clearly yet - YOU haven&#39;t got your own vision cleared <br/>
regarding learning versus schooling. There is a certain amount of <br/>
faith/trust that you have to have to &quot;get it&quot; and you&#39;re agitated and <br/>
busy and worrying yourself too much - you have to relax and let your <br/>
vision clear.<br/>
<br/>
If you could let go of all preconceived notions about what learning <br/>
looks like, I think you&#39;d be pretty darn impressed with your daughter. <br/>
She sounds wonderful to me.  It is YOU who could do a way better job of <br/>
facilitating her learning - you&#39;re not supporting her, you&#39;re still <br/>
trying to shape her to fit into a mold that you have in YOUR head. <br/>
You&#39;re discounting HER interests and not supporting her strengths and <br/>
her very individual, unique self.<br/>
<br/>
If she read what you&#39;ve written to us, would you be embarrassed at all? <br/>
Would what you&#39;ve written to us be good for HER self esteem?<br/>
<br/>
Imagine you were writing it about me - a 53 yo woman friend. I would be <br/>
terribly insulted that you thought what I chose to do with my time <br/>
wasn&#39;t good enough.<br/>
<br/>
I really seriously think you should stop it. Stop agitating yourself <br/>
over this and focus on learning something yourself ABOUT learning. Read <br/>
&quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot; by Frank Smith. Read &quot;The <br/>
Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter. Read &quot;The Unschooler&#39;s <br/>
Handbook&quot; by Mary Griffith. Read &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; by John Holt. <br/>
Last, but definitely not least, read as much as you can on <br/>
&lt;SandraDodd.com&gt;, particularly those articles written by Sandra, <br/>
herself.<br/>
<br/>
You have great instincts - you lack confidence. Bolster yourself by <br/>
educating yourself. In the meantime, just enjoy time with your 12 yo - <br/>
trust me please - I have 3 daughters, 14, 17, and 20. Twelve is a VERY <br/>
special age - poised at the edge of womanhood. Don&#39;t miss out on the <br/>
joy of it by creating an adversarial relationship at all. Don&#39;t fight <br/>
her - support her.<br/>

You do have a choice.<br/>
For various reasons, based on your desires and beliefs, you choose to  do <br/>
whatever all you do.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re living your life thinking you have no choices, that&#39;s a  recipe for <br/>
unhappiness and resentment.    Some of the best  parts of another time this <br/>
topic came through here are collected  here:<br/>

Even as a middle-aged adult, when my mom pokes and prods me to do something, my intrinsic motivation crumbles and I get kind of pissed-off and contrary.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to apply this insight to restrain myself from nagging my husband.  Not easy -- but worth doing.  (To let him maintain his internal sense of satisfaction.)<br/>
