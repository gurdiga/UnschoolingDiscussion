<div id="ygrps-yiv-383973993">Hey folks.  I am looking forward to the conference too!  My husband  is <br/>
really looking forward to the bike tour of Columbia on Saturday morning.    He <br/>
collects vintage lightweight bikes, great for touring and road travel.   He has <br/>
over 50 bikes!  .  So, if anyone who is traveling by plane, or has no way of <br/>
transporting thier bike, would like to do the bike tour and needs a bike, just <br/>
email me and I will bring one for you.  We have all sizes, models, you name it.. <br/>
lol.   DH and I will be traveling seperately, he will only be at the <br/>
conference on Saturday.  We have a two  bike racks that will each hold 3 bikes and <br/>
also quite a few of the bikes have quick release tires that allow for easier <br/>
transportation.  Drop me a line and I will be glad to hook you up with a bike!<br/>
