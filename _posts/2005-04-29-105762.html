<div id="ygrps-yiv-309552160">I thought that I would update you on my recent drama.  Nothing has happened!!!!  <br/>
Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I am happy, but I spent 4 days doing the kind of cleaning that I hate (make it look good, if it is shoved out of the way that is ok, but it must look good.  I hate that.  I am one of those people who doesn&#39;t mind stuff on the floor, but if things are going to get put away it must be organized.), worrying, getting next to no sleep, and I haven&#39;t heard from CPS at all.  I really would rather just get this over with, I know that my house is fine, and all of my paperwork is in order, so I wish that she would just come back and end the case.  I know that I could go down there and give her my paperwork, but since part of the claim was that I live in a dirty house (yes cluttered, not dirty), I know that she must come back and do a follow up.<br/>
<br/>
I did talk to a lawyer that I know.  He told me that in NM (maybe it was just in Otero County) the Children Youth and Families Dept. really aren&#39;t the big problem.  He said that they usually want things to work out for the families, the problem is the DA&#39;s office.  He said that they are hell bent on getting convictions, and they will totally ignore the recommendations of CPS to reunite families if they think that they can get a conviction.  He also advised that if the CPS officer comes with a camera, don&#39;t let her in and retain a lawyer immediately.  The CPS officer told me that I would need references (can you believe that?), so on my list I have a lawyer (who is also Richard&#39;s taekwondo instructor),  another CYFD employee, a very well-spoken friend, and my sister-in-law who is the superintendent of the statewide school for the blind.  I think that if there was a problem in my home one of them would have noticed.<br/>
<br/>
I have also had numerous people into my house to do &quot;walk-through&quot; inspections, to see if any of them can spot anything that could be seen as a health hazard, including one cop, I think that I mentioned that before, and no one has been able to find anything.  The cop was even here before I started cleaning!  I think that someone just has it out for me.  Top of my list is my old child-care provider (the list consists of her and a few fundamentalist book-burning people), who was great in the beginning, but I began to notice some behavior that I didn&#39;t like, including shaming my son if he didn&#39;t know what she thought he should.  He has never been to school and yet he has had to &quot;deschool&quot; because of her, and it wasn&#39;t even a daycare center, just a childcare home with all homeschoolers who have parents that work.  About 6 months ago she told me that Richard couldn&#39;t come anymore, no explanation at all.  The people there were like family to him, so it was hard.  I had been looking for solutions for the few days a week that I work, but she speeded up the process.  I wish that I had pulled him so that he wouldn&#39;t have felt unwanted, but I waited.  <br/>
<br/>
This has been especially irritating for me because since the time that I knew that I was pregnant, every decision that I have made has been with not just much reflection, but most times tons of research and contemplation.  I researched everything from what I ate while pregnant and breastfeeding to circumcision to attachment parenting to childcare to homeschooling then to unschooling.  I am not sure that the general population does all of this, and I really do feel like I am an exceptional parent.  I also feel comfortable saying all of this on an unschooling list because I am sure that all of you feel the same about yourselves!  Reading all of your writings has helped me so much, and I think that everyone here is going to extraordinary measures to be the best parents that we can.  The fact that someone would say that *I* am neglecting my son is just appalling to me.  I guess abusers might feel the same way though.....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wanted to give you all an update.  I really appreciate all of your kind words and advise last week, at a time when I wasn&#39;t sure who to trust it was nice to have an outlet to vent and look for advise.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990749277">I&#39;m glad you wrote.  I thought about it in the middle of the night,  and <br/>
thought of looking up the address and asking you how it went.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
-=-I  know that I could go down there and give her my paperwork, but since <br/>
part of  the claim was that I live in a dirty house (yes cluttered, not dirty), <br/>
I know  that she must come back and do a follow up.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
You don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; that, you just suspect it, right?  If her first visit  <br/>
didn&#39;t yield her any dirt (so to speak), she might NOT have to come back at  all.<br/>
 <br/>
-=the problem is the DA&#39;s office.  He said that they are hell bent on  <br/>
getting convictions=-<br/>
 <br/>
But the DA&#39;s office only deals in crimes, and you weren&#39;t charged with a  <br/>
crime.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe she&#39;s just not going to come back.<br/>
 <br/>
When my mom was neglecting my brother I wasn&#39;t trying to turn her in, I  just <br/>
wanted them to provide some counselling for them, and I went in person to  <br/>
CPS in Rio Arriba county (Espanola).  I was trying to pressure the  caseworker <br/>
not to leave them at the bottom of a long list.   She said  she understood my <br/>
concern, but that my brother was healthy and fed, and that  that week they had <br/>
had a girl with cigarette burns on her arms and a baby with a  broken arm.  <br/>
That shut me right up.  And I suppose you might be  comforted in a twisted and <br/>
sad way by that thought, too.  Undoubtedly the  county has worse situations <br/>
this week than yours.  That&#39;s bad for the other  children, but good for you.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe as you&#39;re researching and contemplating how to procede, you might  want <br/>
to consider not staying in Otero County.  <br/>
