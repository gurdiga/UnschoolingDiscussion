<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336051277">Well, after one whole week of no phone service (an old bill did not get<br/>
paid, but it was not indicated on my statement that service would be<br/>
disconnected), I received a lot of unschooling emails.  What interesting<br/>
subjects.  I took some notes because I really do enjoy reviewing other<br/>
people&#39;s perspectives.  This club has helped me to grow as a person and<br/>
as a mother, since it really has caused me to stop and think about my<br/>
viewpoints, and to question my choices more. <br/>
Karin, your comments on how unschooling has changed the way you parent<br/>
and relate to your children really impressed me.  I have found my own<br/>
life changing in a similar way since unschooling.  I am learning to be<br/>
respectful of myself and others without being either controlling or<br/>
passive.  <br/>
I noticed your opinions caused a lot of sparks, but very interesting<br/>
ones.<br/>
