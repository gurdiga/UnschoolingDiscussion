<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964597074">Have you heard about the next planned &quot;Survivor&quot; show?<br/>
6 men will be dropped on an island with 1 van and 4 kids each, for 6 <br/>
weeks.<br/>
Each kid plays two sports and either takes music or dance classes <br/>
There is no access to fast food.<br/>
Each man must take care of his 4 kids, keep his assigned house clean, <br/>
correct all homework, complete science projects, cook, do laundry, <br/>
etc.   The men only have access to television when the kids are <br/>
asleep and all chores are done: There is only one TV between them and <br/>
there is no remote.  The men must shave their legs and wear makeup <br/>
daily, which they must apply themselves either while driving or while <br/>
making four lunches.  They must attend weekly PTA meetings;<br/>
clean up after their sick children at 3:00 a.m; make an Indian hut <br/>
model with six toothpicks, a tortilla and one marker; and get a 4 <br/>
year old to eat a serving of peas.  The kids vote them off based on <br/>
performance.<br/>
The Prize is:<br/>
The winner gets to go back to his job.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
