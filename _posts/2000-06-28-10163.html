<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405184624">Don&#39;t leave! What I&#39;m doing is going No Mail and then I&#39;ll turn it back<br/>
on in a week or so when I *hope* this has all blown over. At first I was<br/>
reading the posts, but then I got so upset I started deleting any from<br/>
the Feminism/Institutionalizing thread without reading them. Now I have<br/>
to delet the Spanking ones too! I finally got tired of deleting almost<br/>
every unschooling email I&#39;ve gotten in the last few days :-) But you<br/>
don&#39;t have to unsubscribe! Go to eGroups and check &quot;No Mail&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I already went No Mail, but it takes a few hours to kick in. <br/>
<br/>
See y&#39;all later! <br/>

&gt; &gt; This whole feminism discussion has driven me crazy and now people are going<br/>
&gt; &gt; to advocate or condone spanking.  I htink I am on the worng list here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be leaving now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please don&#39;t leave! I decided not to reply at all to the spanking thread.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been in enough spanking debates online. But you are not the only one<br/>
&gt; who believes that &gt;&gt;Spanking is correction, beating is abuse.&lt;&lt;  is a silly<br/>
&gt; semantic excuse for hitting their children.<br/>
