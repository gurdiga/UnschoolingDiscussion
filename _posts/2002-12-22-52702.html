Some of this is personality. Jared still worries me at 9, even though I know <br/>
he can shop on his own and won&#39;t leave with anyone, he still doesn&#39;t really <br/>
pay attention to where you are. At least now he tries to say something if <br/>
he&#39;s going somewhere else.....at younger ages he would see something cool and <br/>
just be gone in a split second. <br/>
He&#39;s very easily distracted and has a hard time remembering to communicate <br/>
where he&#39;s going. Definitely would have been labeled in school due to lack of <br/>
focus.<br/>
He&#39;s a dreamer, an artist, the quiet, sweet personality that lives in a dream <br/>
world. It&#39;s really neat except when you&#39;re trying to go somwhere with him!!<br/>
<br/>
I shop with my 23 mo. old out of the cart. He pretty much stays with us, <br/>
stopping to touch and look at things here and there, we try to go in his <br/>
direction and at his pace which makes shopping fun. Once in a while I have to <br/>
go pick him up and bring him back, but mostly he wanders around and through <br/>
us as we go about our shopping.<br/>
So part of it is age, and part of it is personality I think. So who knows <br/>
when yours will be more capable of this.....I think trying to see the things <br/>
they want to and going at their pace helps a lot.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
That I would say depends on the child. My oldest I really don&#39;t remember <br/>
that much because being an only then it was so much easier for me to manage. <br/>
One thing that really opened up my eyes as to how people are though. My <br/>
oldest was about 2 and in a stroller. My mom and I were in a mall shopping. <br/>
I noticed a man in one of the stores we were in. I noticed him again in <br/>
another store. I watched and noticed he was following us. I told my mom to <br/>
watch her purse. I finally stared him down in one store and let him know I <br/>
was aware of him. He left. It wasn&#39;t until I got home and told my then <br/>
husband and he remarked that maybe it wasn&#39;t the purses he was after, it was <br/>
our daughter. Scary.<br/>
<br/>
With the next two, being they were only 13 months apart, I can&#39;t say I went <br/>
very many places alone. I had a double stroller and made sure they stayed in <br/>
it. I do remember though by the time they were 4 them understanding. My son <br/>
during one of his T ball games lost us. We were all marching to the field <br/>
and he got distracted. He stopped and by the time he came around, we were <br/>
gone. My husband and I were coach and team mom so we had a bunch of little <br/>
aqua shirts to watch. My oldest realized Joseph was gone. I ran back <br/>
retracing our steps and found him right by the fence. He was a little scared <br/>
but not crying or anything. He had stayed right where he was left like I <br/>
told him. He told me some people tried to talk to him and he said he was <br/>
told to stay right where he was. He didn&#39;t leave with anyone and just <br/>
waited. He was 4 then.<br/>
<br/>
With a 6 and 7 year old now plus the 2 year old, I make sure they all get <br/>
it. My 2 year old now, at 2 months past 2 years understands enough so she <br/>
will not leave my sight. If she wants to go to another aisle, she clls me <br/>
and waits. She knows we all go down the aisles together unless I have my <br/>
mom, oldest or husband with me.<br/>
