<div id="ygrps-yiv-885796356">Greetings from &quot;Lurking Lynn&quot;,<br/>
Hi,<br/>
I have a grandson my husband and I are raising. He has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with many psychological components. He is a very good reader/decoder (college level - lower comprehension about 3rd-4th grade). With repetition can do basic math. Has many interests but does not stick with anything long enough to really grasp it. <br/>
<br/>
I have home schooled him most of his life (now almost 14). He is not able to function in public school setting. Because of my health, he has had a home teacher 3 days a week this past year.<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to Unschool him but turning him lose without structure is like turning a tornado lose in the house. He loves using the computer but not for writing. He loves to read, but, never finishes anything. He has an &quot;ear&quot; for music and picks up melodies and can pick them out on the keyboard quickly, but has not been into that much for quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
He loves taking electronics apart - even if we&#39;re still using them.<br/>
<br/>
He seems to have many interests but not focused enough to profit from any of them.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Lynn<br/>
