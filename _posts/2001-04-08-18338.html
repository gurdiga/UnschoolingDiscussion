Sounds about right...  hey is it jealousy about your dd <br/>
goign to work with your dh?  You wish you were going <br/>
too?  As for the &#39;how come?&#39; thing, maybe you&#39;re still <br/>
deschooling, liek you&#39;re expecting her to do more than <br/>
she wants/needs to when it&#39;s &#39;school-time?&#39;  As well as <br/>
her not having the stimulation of someone round?  <br/>

Jealousy?  No.  I fall asleep if I travell around in the van all day. <br/>
However I did think she had the right idea NOT coming to work with me <br/>
this week!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Yes I could be still de schooling.  Though in all honesty.  I do <br/>
think, having a friend to share with ,is much more stimulating than <br/>
being home on your own with Mum!!!!</div>

<br/>
Are you acting always like a mom or like a teacher with her?<br/>
You could BE that other friend to share with, but it might take some <br/>
adjustment of your patterns.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, think it&#39;s a deschooling problem.  Kids can get over a few years of <br/>
school easier than parents can get over 16 years of it (or 20, or whatever).<br/>

I can honestly say &quot;NO&quot; I never act like a teacher these days - used <br/>
to!<br/>
It is possible that I havent yet learned to decipher the &#39;learning&#39; <br/>

<br>That&#39;s what I was wondering. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t &quot;see&quot; it, maybe you don&#39;t &quot;count&quot; 
<br>it in your own mind. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>And then you &quot;see&quot; things clicking when she plays and hmmmm, why didn&#39;t she 
<br>do that from 8-2??
<br>
<br>I am constantly reminding myself that stuff &quot;counts&quot; and then quickly 
<br>reminding myself that I don&#39;t really have to count anything anyway! :)
<br>
<br>Today&#39;s learning (?) experience: &nbsp;I have a son (7 yo) and a daughter (6 yo). &nbsp;
<br>So this isn&#39;t gross to them. &nbsp;OK?? &nbsp;Did you know that if you stick your head 
<br>under the outside faucet (as you are supposed to be washing your hands from 
<br>helping Mom plant some herbs) that the water will go in your nose and you can 
<br>swallow it?? Did you know all that stuff in your head is connected?? We do 
<br>now!
<br>
<br>Have fun figuring it all out!
