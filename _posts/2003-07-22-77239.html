<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869665359">Shellley,<br/>
    I would like to address your concerns with having Jacob formally<br/>
assessed for Autism Spectrum Disorder.  My daugher, Amanda is 12 1/2.  When<br/>
she was in third grade (began homeschooling in fourth grade) she was<br/>
assessed for ADHD and Autism Spectrum.  She was officially diagnosed with<br/>
ADHD and Asperger&#39;s Syndrome.  At the time, being that she was in school,<br/>
she needed the assessment for special accommodations.  When it became<br/>
apparent that the school was not accomodating her, I brought her home. <br/>
(homeschooling was always something I wanted to do for her but couldn&#39;t<br/>
being a single mom with no support...at the end of third grade I became<br/>
disabled and was able to bring her home).  Now that she is being<br/>
homeschooled, the only benefit to an official diagnosis is that she receives<br/>
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).  Yes, I believe unschooling is<br/>
the best approach for her.  She has blossomed in the freedom that she has at<br/>
home.  I did not work with an Early Intervention because I did my own<br/>
reading up on both disorders.  I didn&#39;t feel like her idyoscyncracies were<br/>
detrimental to her.  Actually, by not addressing the Austitic stims since<br/>
bringing her home, they have lessened.  I really don&#39;t know what to<br/>
attribute that to.  If I was not in need of the SSDI, I would not have<br/>
worried about the official dx in hindsight.  I use the SSDI to buy her<br/>
learning games/toys, books, etc.  Whatever she expresses a desire to study,<br/>
we find the materials and buy them with her monthly benefit.  Just by doing<br/>
alot of reading (Tony Attwood&#39;s Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, The Out-of-Sync Child,<br/>
and various books on Sensory Integration Disorder), I began to understand my<br/>
daughter and see her unique attributes as a huge part of who she is.  I<br/>
certainly don&#39;t need the label now that we are homeschooling.  I found,<br/>
through trial and error, that unschooling is what works best for Amanda. <br/>
She is a very curious preteen and unschooling allows for the curiousity,<br/>
even encourages it.  Bringing her home was the best thing I could have done<br/>
for her.  Both her teacher and the pyschologist supported me in bringing her<br/>
home.  We don&#39;t have issues with loud noises, bright lights, bullies. <br/>
Amanda&#39;s stims are not made fun of.  She has not been on medication for the<br/>
ADHD since coming home four years ago.  Our family is happy with our<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling life.  I think what I am trying to say Shelley, is<br/>
think carefully before you decide.  In some states, once you have a<br/>
diagnosis, you may be required to have your son in rehabilitation and have<br/>
home visits, etc.<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>
