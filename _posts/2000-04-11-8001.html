<div id="ygrps-yiv-78816292">I too have been seeing a chiropractor for a looooong time. I go as often as<br/>
my schedule allows, I try to go 2x/wk. Luckily he&#39;s a friend of ours, so he<br/>
allows me to be flexible with my visits. I think the advantages of<br/>
chiropractic care are enourmous. I try to go even when I&#39;m not in pain, so<br/>
that I can still receive the benefits of a better immune system, etc. My<br/>
children have all been adjusted from time to time also. He confirms what has<br/>
already been stated here, that simply being born is one of the most<br/>
traumatic things that can happen to the spinal cord. I would encorage<br/>
everyone, child or adult, in pain or not to visit a chiropractor. IMO it can<br/>
only make things better.<br/>
