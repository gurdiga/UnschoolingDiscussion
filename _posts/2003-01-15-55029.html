<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204705504">HI!<br/>
My 3dd always wants to do whatever my 5dd is doing and wants to take what<br/>
she has. I got tired of the constant struggle so we came up with a game.<br/>
If 5dd is playing with a toy that 3dd wants, 3dd has to trade her<br/>
something for it. So I help her look around and we decide what looks the<br/>
most enticing. They usually just start laughing, because the pile of<br/>
unaccepted trades mount up next to 5dd until she finally accepts<br/>
something, and joyfully gives 3dd the toy. Usually by this time, 3dd has<br/>
no interest in that toy, and is on to greener pastures.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
We did scissors/paper/stone when kids couldn&#39;t decide who got to sit with <br/>
dad, or who got to go first in a tie situation.  <br/>
<br/>
And the winner had as long a turn as he wanted, followed by the other <br/>
person&#39;s long-as-he-wants turn.   If something interrupted a turn (dinner <br/>
with the family, needing to go to sleep) it was that person&#39;s turn, still, <br/>
afterward.<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;was,&quot; but they still do that.  Only they got old enough that the <br/>
scissors/paper thing wasn&#39;t necessary.   If they&#39;re stuck trying to decide, I <br/>
try to remind one of them of something else they had also wanted to do, which <br/>
might not happen if they go first.  Like I might say, &quot;Holly, didn&#39;t you want <br/>
to practice fiddle before it got too late?&quot; or &quot;Marty, you still need to call <br/>
Logan.&quot;<br/>

Ruined for life!<br/>
<br/>
She has a practice chart and she calls it practicing.  <br/>
I don&#39;t argue with her about it, but I talk to her about when she&#39;s playing. <br/>
<br/>
Just last night she had &quot;Rubber Dolly&quot; DOWN and was doing it with no <br/>
hesitation and good tone, and I heard her from downstairs, and told her later <br/>
it sounded just as good as if anyone were to play it.   <br/>
<br/>
Usually her teacher sings the words to the songs, or they make words up, but <br/>
although she told them Rubber Dolly has words, she hasn&#39;t taught them to them.<br/>
<br/>
I sang it for her and realized it&#39;s pretty thoroughly politically incorrect <br/>
and touches on issues maybe best left in the past.  Or not. &lt;g&gt;  Can&#39;t decide <br/>
on that one, but I can understand why the teacher hasn&#39;t taught the words to <br/>
her predominantly-Christian-homeschooled clientel:<br/>
<br/>
My mama told me if I was goody<br/>
That she would buy me a rubber dolly<br/>
My sister told her I kissed a soldier<br/>
Now she won&#39;t buy me a rubber dolly.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know the history of that?  I&#39;ve never heard any but that one verse.  <br/>
My mom used to sing it just to herself as she was working, or would play the <br/>
guitar and sing it, but I don&#39;t remember any more of it.<br/>
<br/>
(Google for me...)<br/>

&gt; Hi Iam dawna! I have been just reading a few emails. I have been<br/>
considering homeschooling or unschooling. My son is 18 mth and daughter is 2<br/>
almost 3. She seems a bit a head of her age though. She wants some of his<br/>
toys. So I give a more grown up toy or distract her by getting her to help<br/>
me. I dont know maybe some kind of distraction or fun activity like a<br/>
computer game or movie. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198896433">I have a 6 year old and an almost 3 year old so this often arises. A while back Joyce (I think)<br/>
posted something about being the person trying to help your kids get what they want rather <br/>
then the person standing in their way. Of course when you have two kids who both want the<br/>
same thing, how do you choose? Well, believe it or not, I have found recently that *not <br/>
choosing* can often help!<br/>
<br/>
What I have found is, instead of me being the judge and determining what is fair (and<br/>
basically taking one kids side over the other), what seems to work better is to try to help<br/>
them talk it through. For example, if Jason (6) wants to play a computer game but Kyle<br/>
is already playing, I used to jump in and tell Jason that he had to wait his turn (sticking<br/>
up for Kyle who is younger etc). Now what I do is this...if Jason tries to push Kyle off<br/>
and take the computer, I stop Jason and ask him to *ask* Kyle not just take it. Jason asks<br/>
Kyle...to my surprise, Kyle often says OK and gets off LOL! If Kyle does not want to get<br/>
off, I will talk with Kyle a bit, explaining that Jason really wants to play etc, <br/>
(or he will be leaving soon and just wants to play until he goes or whatever) but<br/>
I leave it up to Kyle. If Kyle still says no, I explain Kyle&#39;s point of view (he just <br/>
got on or is right in the middle of a game), sympathize with Jason and try to get<br/>
him involved in something else.<br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing is that since I have done this, they have gotten better at sharing<br/>
and working things out on their own. I think that it helps because I am leaving the <br/>
decisions up to them, not making the decisions for them. I do not have to take one<br/>
side over the other...rather I model how to present their arguments to the other. <br/>
The rule here for the computer is that the person playing can play as long as they<br/>
like. If it seems like Kyle (or Jason) has been playing for a long time and the<br/>
other still wants to play, I will help them make their argument, but still leave it<br/>
up the person playing. Jason has been figuring out that Kyle is more likely to give<br/>
him a turn if Jason lets Kyle have a turn. I have heard them work things out more on<br/>
their own (often using the same words that I have used). And sometimes they come up<br/>
with solutions that I never would have thought of. <br/>
<br/>
It does not work perfectly, but for the most part it has helped improve how they <br/>
handle things. I am not sure how well I explained what we do, I hope that it made<br/>
sense. In a nutshell, I do not take one kids side over the other and I help them see<br/>
the others point of view by talking it out with them and letting them make the decision.<br/>

I&#39;m responding to the quote at the bottom of your e mail, &quot;a house without books is like a room without windows.&quot;  I counted 17 bookcases in my house; mostly childrens books which started their way into our home 21 years ago after our first child&#39;s birth.  I imagine this list has a lot of book lovers.<br/>
<br/>
Your hometown of Toledo is where my oldest had his High School graduation from Clonlara.  It was funny, I remember telling my puzzled neighbor that my son&#39;s &quot;school&quot; was in Ann Arbor and he graduated in Toledo. We live in Illinois.<br/>

Enjoy your kids and your books!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Like the Battle <br/>
&gt; &gt; of New Orleans <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love this song! &quot;In 1814 we took a little trip, along with Colonel<br/>
&gt; Jackson <br/>
&gt; down the mighty Mississip.....&quot; Now it&#39;s stuck in my head.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a side note, I recently learned a lot about our local history here, as I<br/>
&gt; was making a fact sheet about our area for a flat traveler project we do. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve lived in Toledo, OH for most of my life and attended school here<br/>
&gt; through <br/>
&gt; college. I&#39;d never heard of the Toledo War, or that Ohio and Michigan were <br/>
&gt; disputing which state Toledo belonged to. I found all about it online and <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t believe it! (The dispute was solved when Congress gave MI the<br/>
&gt; Upper <br/>
&gt; Peninsula in exchange for letting Ohio have Toledo....the jury is still out<br/>
&gt; on who got the better deal, but I&#39;m thinking that I&#39;d take the UP too LOL)<br/>

my mind. ;) Where is your flat traveler going?<br/>

Reminds me of Neil Young&#39;s Powderfinger:<br/>
<br/>
POWDERFINGER <br/>

Look out, Mama, there&#39;s a white boat comin&#39; up the river <br/>
With a big red beacon, and a flag, and a man on the rail <br/>
I think you&#39;d better call John,  <br/>
&#39;Cause it don&#39;t look like they&#39;re here to deliver the mail <br/>
And it&#39;s less than a mile away <br/>
I hope they didn&#39;t come to stay <br/>
It&#39;s got numbers on the side and a gun <br/>
And it&#39;s makin&#39; big waves. <br/>
 <br/>
Daddy&#39;s gone, my brother&#39;s out hunting in the mountains <br/>
Big John&#39;s been drinking since the river took Emmy-Lou <br/>
So the Powers That Be left me here to do the thinkin&#39; <br/>
And I just turned twenty-two <br/>
I was wonderin&#39; what to do <br/>
And the closer they got, <br/>
The more those feelings grew. <br/>
 <br/>
Daddy&#39;s rifle in my hand felt reassurin&#39; <br/>
He told me, Red means run, son, numbers add up to nothin&#39; <br/>
But when the first shot hit the docks I saw it comin&#39; <br/>
Raised my rifle to my eye <br/>
Never stopped to wonder why. <br/>
Then I saw black,  <br/>
And my face splashed in the sky. <br/>
 <br/>
Shelter me from the powder and the finger <br/>
Cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger <br/>
Think of me as one you&#39;d never figured <br/>
Would fade away so young <br/>
With so much left undone <br/>
Remember me to my love, <br/>
I know I&#39;ll miss her.</div>
