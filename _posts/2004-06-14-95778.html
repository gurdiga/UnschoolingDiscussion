<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271127667">When I was a special ed teacher for preschool service providers, we hired <br/>
students all the time for classroom assistants or aides (like one to one aides <br/>
for kids with multiple disabilities).  This typically pays more than the average <br/>
&quot;daycare&quot; assistant job and there are often summer only positions available.  <br/>
These jobs could be searched out by inquiring with the county or school <br/>
district about which places in your area are approved by the district to provide <br/>
special ed services to preschoolers.  You can also try looking in the phone book <br/>
under preschools and special needs or places that provide PT & OT for kids.<br/>
He could combine his love of kids, music, and sign language as many of these <br/>
classes use signing with the children.  This is also something that could turn <br/>
into a &quot;real&quot; job after the summer- as aides and also substitutes are always <br/>
needed- especially young men because the kids just LOVE them!<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-317252632">Don&#39;t have any other suggestions. Just that it is so nice when your child<br/>
can find something they really like. My oldest, Tara had worked in food for<br/>
awhile and hated it. And that was just at a bakery.<br/>
<br/>
Her passion is shopping and clothes and she was able to get a job at Old<br/>
Navy right by our house. She was working a little over a year there when<br/>
they skipped a step and promoted her to assistant manager. She was so<br/>
excited but I was wondering about the extra responsibility. She is handling<br/>
it with such determination. She was called in the other day on her day off<br/>
and when I mentioned she shouldn&#39;t have answered the phone, she said she had<br/>
to. It was her responsibility. She went in without even complaining. She<br/>
also got a raise after the promotion and they will work with her when she<br/>
goes to college in the fall. Her liking this is such a difference then from<br/>
her just having a job.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

That is SO cool.<br/>
The place Kirby works distributed phone lists, in precedence order. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Kirby is the first person after the owners and the store manager.  He <br/>
outranks six other employees.  It&#39;s not worth a whole lot, but this year he&#39;s asked <br/>
for two weekends off (on his own, not like the family vacation time I used to <br/>
request for him when he was  younger) and he got them in a flash.  And I don&#39;t <br/>
think he has to do windows or the bathroom NEARLY as much as he did when he <br/>
was fourteen. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052594626">I wanted to mention house-sitting as a possible &quot;created&quot; job.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron had a client base---as I groom dogs and am known in doggy  circles.<br/>
 <br/>
But he works 2 out of 5 weekends, and sometimes all week or for weeks  at a <br/>
time, house-sitting. Caring for pets and mail pick-up and plant-watering  and <br/>
such.<br/>
 <br/>
He makes $15/day for two pets, plus another $5 for each additional pet.  <br/>
Mostly they leave him frozen pizzas, salad fixin&#39;s, and cokes in the  <br/>
refrigerator. I usually send burrito fixin&#39;s with him. <br/>
 <br/>
He really enjoys the independence he has while there---like it&#39;s his own  <br/>
house. Dogs and cats are usually VERY easy to deal with in their own  homes.<br/>
 <br/>
He leaves little notes that tell what happened, how the dogs acted,  <br/>
whatever----and his clients love that. He often gets tips.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron&#39;s jobs have all come by word of mouth, but we&#39;ve recommended  flyers. <br/>
He probably shouldn&#39;t now---he has so many clients!<br/>
 <br/>
GREAT summer money---and even during the year for folks without  children!<br/>

this year. She likes it too - the independence, the sort of <br/>
&quot;pretending&quot; to have her own house to care for and so on - the <br/>
responsibility.<br/>
