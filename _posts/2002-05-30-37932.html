<div id="ygrps-yiv-244437664">Has anyone read the book called: and the children played by Patricia Joudry? It was published in 1975 but her children were unschoolers in the mid 50&#39;s. It is a riot of a book and a crazy, fun, loving adventure of unschooling. It is however out of print and I haven&#39;t seen it on used sites for less than $45. for a book that once sold for $6.95. If you ever come across it grab it up, it is a delightful book. So, I guess people were unschooling way back when...Carol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763819015">I HAVE that book.  It was one John Holt really enjoyed and recommended.  I can even remember when GWS  was offering $3 for used copies to recycle back to readers when new ones no longer available.  Oh, for the days.....<br/>
<br/>
Not just the unschooling.  Was window for me into an entirely different culture.  I admit I was a bit shocked at first about a family living in a castle and having a Rolls while on the brink of bankruptcy but 20 years have mellowed me :-). <br/>
<br/>
Yes, if you see it in a garage sale snap it up. <br/>
<br/>
And if ANYONE ever sees a book called &quot;The Children on the Hill&quot; let me know and *I* will buy it!!!<br/>
