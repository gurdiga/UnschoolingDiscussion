Kinda cruel, in a way, but within the context of our culture at the beginning <br/>
of the 21st century, I hope I will be forgiven by future generations for <br/>
having made reproductive decisions for other beings I legally owned.  Maybe it <br/>
will someday be seen as barbaric or politically incorrect.<br/>

Tomcats died of kitty leukemia from exchanging bodily fluids with other <br/>

Peru  that belonged to a god-like fellow from Argentina who was riding his bike <br/>
from the southern-most tip of South America to Alaska. When he got here, he <br/>
needed to go home for a month and be with his wife while she had her baby. He <br/>
was riding for Amnesty International. Long Story Short, this dog was 11 mos old <br/>
and starting to be rude about his dogginess,  so I suggested to this fellow <br/>
that thismonth off would be ideal to have the dog neutered if he wanted to, as <br/>
he would need the rest for a week or so any way. YIKES!! The guy acted like I <br/>
wanted to cut his knackers off!!<br/>
Apparently god-like Italians from Argentina do NOT neuter dogs. I had no <br/>
idea. He phoned me from Argentina to make certain that I did not neuter his dog. <br/>
My vet told me that hardly anyone in  other cultures spays or neuters their <br/>
animals as much as North Americans.<br/>

I believe, as do many others, that animals are indeed sentient beings, <br/>
definitely in reference to the second definition, above, but I cannot rule <br/>
out the first definition, either.  I just finished reading an excellent <br/>
book on this subject, and I encourage anyone who is interested in this <br/>
subject to check it out.  It was a wee bit dry and scientific for Liam, but <br/>
we both really loved it and it sparked a lot of good conversations.  I had <br/>
picked up an audiotape of the book, and there were parts that really made <br/>
both of us think and Liam wanted to hear again and again.  The book is <br/>
called &quot;When Elephants Weep.&quot;  Here is a link to a review:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps animals don&#39;t make decisions about reproduction from *our* <br/>
perspective, but they certainly do from theirs. I would not want to say <br/>
with certainty whether animals can or cannot think about anything.  I also <br/>
think that &quot;promiscuity&quot; is a very judgmental term that we cannot lay on <br/>
animals, whose reasons for being are completely their own. If we could get <br/>
ourselves inside the heads of animals, we may be quite surprised to find <br/>
out exactly what kinds of &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;emotions&quot; they have.  We may not <br/>
be able to recognize them because they may be very different than what <br/>
humans&#39; feelings and emotions look like. But, that does not mean that <br/>
animals are not sentient or have no consciousness.<br/>

universally, but in some quarters these things are definitely being called <br/>
into question.  I have noticed that people can become very angry and <br/>
defensive when animal rights issues are brought up (i.e. at circus <br/>
demonstrations, which I frequently attend whenever I can), and, again I <br/>
could be way off, but I think there may be a correlation with our <br/>
discomfort with an idea and the idea&#39;s proximity to truth.  (Ugh.. does <br/>
that make any sense at all?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874778419">I lied. I&#39;m not done.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that I just said in my previous post about the sentience of <br/>
animals, I do believe that we humans have a tremendous responsibility to <br/>
those animals we have tamed and domesticated (but not because they&#39;re dumb, <br/>
unfeeling beasts).  I do neuter companion animals because there are just <br/>
too many unwanted cats and dogs in shelters and on the street. Because <br/>
these animals have been domesticated but us humans, they depend upon humans <br/>
for food and shelter; they cannot and should not be out on the street.  So, <br/>
neutering companion animals is really (in my mind) the lesser of two evils.<br/>
<br/>
Having said *that*, I do not judge people who have cats and dogs they do <br/>
not neuter, as long as they are taking responsibility for the animals and <br/>
providing good homes for the offspring.  What some folks described here <br/>
about people allowing animals to have litter after litter and then dumping <br/>
the pups or kittens is just so awful, it breaks my heart.<br/>

And I don&#39;t think animals can be &quot;promiscuous&quot; in the absence of a marital <br/>
tradition in their species.  Especially when they&#39;re living outside their <br/>
instinctive choices.  Maybe a gander could be promiscuous.   <br/>

<br/>
True.<br/>
<br/>
Our dog lives with us, without another dog, because we decided she would.<br/>
Her job is to guard the house and hang out with us and be cute.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t feed her as well as we eat.  She doesn&#39;t have her own room.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t get to decide whether to go somewhere with us or not.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re nicer to her than our neighbors on either side are to their dogs, but <br/>
nothing they&#39;re doing is atypical of dog owners.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re responsible about getting our animals fixed.  But the cats are here to <br/>
kill mice and bugs, which they do.  They&#39;re overpayed for what they do, but so <br/>
it goes.  They were all strays (one found, two wild barncats, captured as <br/>
kittens, and would have rather have stayed there, wild with their mom).<br/>
<br/>
There was a time when we let two tomcat kittens live with us rather than <br/>
continue on their journey to the city pound, and they were already ten months old <br/>
and we were young and poor and didn&#39;t get them fixed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>point taken. That is what Sandra was saying. I see a different <br/>
mindset towards animals, out herre in the country, than people have <br/>
in the city. OUr dogs and cats are pets, and come inside the house <br/>
all the time, no problem. Our neighbors think we&#39;re nuts. They take <br/>
baby calves away from their moms at market time, send to the feed <br/>
lots where they can gain weight and garner a profitable price.<br/>
<br/>
We disagree with that practice. But the locals who know we want only <br/>
grass fed...they can&#39;t figure out why on earth you&#39;d want grass fed <br/>
when grain fattened is so tender. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a matter of mindset. The neighbor&#39;s dog who ate her pups...in <br/>
the city, they&#39;d be fined by the Humane Society or SOMETHING. No <br/>
humane society out in the country. Animals are tools. Different <br/>
mindset. And btw, the neighbors whose dog...you know...they aren&#39;t <br/>
like most of our neighbors. Though their pets are all outside <br/>
animals, they treat their cats and dogs decently and responsibly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783531299">I also <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think that &quot;promiscuity&quot; is a very judgmental term that we cannot <br/>
 </span></blockquote>lay on <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; animals, whose reasons for being are completely their own. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oops, I did it again. Promiscuous means without any thought to kind; <br/>
indiscriminate. Again, animals select based on species, and within <br/>
species, based on scent or color or size or strength.<br/>
<br/>
But thinking primarily of cats and dogs (our most common pets)...an <br/>
un-fixed pet will mate frequently, with whatever counterpart is in <br/>
heat or is responding to a &quot;heat&quot;...in that, they are indiscriminate. <br/>
In that, they are promiscuous: mating with whatever animal of their <br/>
own species sends the right signals.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the dolphin, which does have sex outside of a <br/>
female&#39;s &quot;season&quot;, animals mating is based on instinct: scent, time <br/>
of year, mating calls...I don&#39;t know how many ways they have of <br/>
getting each other&#39;s attention. I do know, they don&#39;t think &quot;Oops, <br/>
better not do it tonight. I might get pregnant.&quot; and so, we have to <br/>
do that thinking for them. Especially concerning the animals we have <br/>
in our lives with us, and their species: dogs and cats.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we could get <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ourselves inside the heads of animals, we may be quite surprised to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>find <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; out exactly what kinds of &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;emotions&quot; they have.  We <br/>

 </span></blockquote>that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; animals are not sentient or have no consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. Animals ARE sentient: they can perceive. sorry about that <br/>
misapplication of vocabulary! LOL sometimes, I lose MY sentience, you <br/>
know? hee<br/>
<br/>
as for this &quot;getting in their heads&quot; we have a lot to learn, I agree. <br/>
But that reminds me of a discussion w/my bil...knowitall of the <br/>
century. &quot;Dogs see color! I know they do!&quot; (Mind you, this is a man <br/>
who &quot;knows&quot; that flies&#39; eggs are the little brown specks they leave <br/>
on ceilings...and he&#39;s the genius of the family) Anyway, his &quot;proof&quot; <br/>
was that he had a dog; he could roll a blue ball and a red ball <br/>
across the room and tell the dog &quot;Get the red ball&quot; and it would get <br/>
the red one every time.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;the red ball most likely SMELLED differently than the blue <br/>
ball, and it knew what SMELL you meant, when you said red.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
duh. my b-i-l, that is. duh-uuuuuhhhh<br/>

I think the only thing we can do is try make an imformed decision. <br/>
Not a split second edcision based on what someone else says.<br/>
I can see both sides and can see where both sides have validity. With <br/>
that I just do the best and follow what the combination of both my <br/>
heart and brain {and bank account}say. I try to look on both sides of <br/>
the fence because some of my decisions in retrospect were better then <br/>
others IMO, and I have adjusted my next decisions accordingly.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s actually pretty agreed upon by experts that dogs can see some color.<br/>
More along the blue and yellow lines and nothing in the green and red areas.<br/>
The rest is shades of grays. So the dog probably could tell the difference<br/>
from just looking at the blue and red balls. Now give him a red and a green<br/>
one, I&#39;d be curious to see how he did!<br/>
