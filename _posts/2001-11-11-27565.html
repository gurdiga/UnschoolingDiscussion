<div id="ygrps-yiv-106485285">Well. . . I think the locked door could have been a mistake. I can see how it <br/>
might have happened. And I don&#39;t think leaving a 10 year old is necessarily <br/>
bad. Lelia was left alone (when she wanted to stay home and I had to go out) <br/>
when she was 10, and probably younger as well. She is also very mature. She <br/>
is 12 now and sits home with our two year old. Also, there were neighbors she <br/>
knew she could count on if something came up. . . she always had an option. <br/>
Maybe you could be the option for these kids. <br/>
<br/>
I understand you being upset  . . it obviously pushes  your buttons on this <br/>
issue. But I think jumping to conclusions that may not be the truth could  <br/>
harm things more than help. Everyone has different ways of raising children. <br/>
I know the door locked was not a good thing, but it really could have just <br/>
been a mistake. The young people staying by themselves at times is not on the <br/>
surface child neglect. Of course, these are my own feelings. . . you have to <br/>
do what you feel if right, but since you posted, I thought I would give my <br/>
own thoughts to it.<br/>
