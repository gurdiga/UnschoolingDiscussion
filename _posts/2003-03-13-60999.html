Carol:<br/>
<br/>
The food we used with our black Lab was Ken-L-Biskit, which is listed <br/>
as a Premium dog food in The Dog Food Book.  This food was <br/>
recommended to us by a breeder who had about 16 Labs on her small <br/>
urban property for precisely the low amount of waste it produced <br/>
while still giving her show animals excellent nutrition.  Shop around <br/>
and see who carries this in your area and try it.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is one acceptable way to recycle dog waste:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Animal Waste Composting <br/>
 <br/>
Dog waste should not be put in the garbage.  Here&#39;s a simple way you <br/>
can turn dog waste into compost.  <br/>
<br/>
Dig a hole (Approx 3&#39; x 3&#39;) in a corner of your back yard away from <br/>
any food crops you may have and cover it with a plastic lid from an <br/>
old garbage can or compost bin.  Then empty the dog waste into the <br/>
hole daily; now and then add water and some Septo-Bac, an enzyme-<br/>
active biological compound formulated to increase the digestion rate <br/>
of sewage.<br/>
<br/>
After several years, the finished compost can be dug out and placed <br/>
in a hole around ornamental shrubs, and covered with dirt.  There are <br/>
also animal waste composters on the market.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve noticed that the cheaper foods tend to &quot;go right through&quot;.  They have<br/>
to eat more to get the nutrition they need.  Our dog gets the BARF diet,<br/>
(meaty) bones and raw food.  His poop is minimal, mostly white (from all the<br/>
bones) and crumbles and dissolves into the lawn in his yard.  We don&#39;t go in<br/>
there for anything, so I can get away with scooping only when we need to mow<br/>
the grass.<br/>

You could try a raw meat diet. I noticed mine prodeuced less fertilizer and it was smaller and harder.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974699551">Thanks to everyone who replied to my woes about my dog, Tarzan.  The <br/>
latest food we&#39;ve tried is Nutro Max, which was lower in fiber.  We feed 4 <br/>
cups a day, which is what the bag suggested for a 60 pound dog.  Previously <br/>
we&#39;ve fed him Science Diet, but we later found out it has a lot of corn in it <br/>
which can upset many dogs.  Then we switched to corn-free Canadae, but none <br/>
of these foods have made a difference.<br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;ve heard about the BARF diet, but I would have no clue what to give him. <br/>
 Can anyone give this queasy vegetarian an idea of what Tarzan would need <br/>
each day?<br/>
<br/>
   Thankfully, Tarzan hasn&#39;t gotten into any other animal food,  We have a <br/>
lot of animals here (3 dogs, three cats, seven frogs, a fish, a rabbit, a <br/>
cockatiel and a snake!).  But because Tarzan is &quot;enthusiastic,&quot; to put it <br/>
kindly, he&#39;s an outdoor dog.  He does get hold of things he shouldn&#39;t and <br/>
chews them up.  He ate part of a doormat one day, and a bit of soccer ball <br/>
after that.  Would that account for the mess in the backyard?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your help.<br/>
Carol  (By the way, is it common for cats to drool?  One of our cats just <br/>
drools buckets when she&#39;s happy.  She&#39;s such a love, and very much a lap cat, <br/>
but holding her gets a bit damp after a while!)<br/>

I&#39;m in bed at night and does this as near to my face as I will let her get!<br/>
I think the drooling is a reflex from when they were kittens and nursing. So<br/>
that when they are paw treading and purring, it makes them remember how<br/>
content they were when they nursed as kittens. Could be wrong, though.<br/>

I got a book titled &quot;The Encyclopedia of Natural Pet Care&quot; and<br/>
really like the info. <br/>
Along with having several pets, some that have wondered up{living in<br/>
the country},we also rehab small mammals later to be released<br/>
{mainly squirrels}, from time to time when someone gets in touch<br/>
after finding them. {I don&#39;t go out looking for them because I have<br/>
a husband who is very empathic to suffering, so when they don&#39;t make<br/>
it, it is very hard on him} Anyway I have carried it over to<br/>
rehabbing as well. I make collidal silver from time to time for us<br/>
and have carried it over and use it on our animals.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182493585">This is something I know about! lol We have a 13 month old Siberian Husky who <br/>
is on a barf diet. It&#39;s very healthy for them especially if they are an <br/>
outdoor dog. Our dog mostly stays in because she is spoiled! Along with the <br/>
barf diet she eats carrots, broccoli, buffalo meat (her favorite) and cottage <br/>
cheese..she basically eats better than we do sometimes! This diet is however <br/>
something you really want to look into before starting because if you do not <br/>
do it properly then you can do more harm to your dog than good. So check it <br/>
out. Kim<br/>

schipperkes. The love it, their teeth are spotless, the poop is waaaayyy <br/>
less, and the dogs are happier. I figure it takes about the same amount of <br/>
time it used to take to go to the pet store for the premium food. Could help <br/>
with the behaviour as well. The dogs seem to settle down emotionally a bit <br/>
more when the food is more natural. Don&#39;t we all?<br/>

Thank you for this.  I have a young Jack Russell who is a very picky eater.  I give him beaf stew, eggs, etc. mixed in with small amounts of commercial food. I have been questioning how many eggs per week was too many. All good. : ) <br/>
<br/>
I am going back to read about the shots issue.  Does anyone here not have his/her dogs up-to-date on those?  I would like to hear more about that.<br/>
<br/>
I do have some Jack Russell books, but the &quot;putting the dog on a feeding schedule&quot; didn&#39;t work for him.  That was when I started giving him &quot;real food&quot;.  <br/>

sell dog food! Four cups a day will probably give you a VERY fat dog!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard really good things about BARF---but as a veg-head, you might be <br/>
squeamish about preparation.<br/>
<br/>
Slow growth and keeping him on the slim side are important for a retriever <br/>
(making those bones grow too quickly and added weight can result in serious <br/>
problems). I&#39;d certainly cut back on the amount you&#39;re feeding---by almost <br/>
half---maybe a cup to a  cup and a quarter twice a day. <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m writing all this without seeing him, but that sounds like A LOT of food <br/>
for a lab!)<br/>

Kinda the concept I got when I was nursing my babies, I was always worried <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t get enough or I couldn&#39;t tell how much they ate, so if they <br/>
wanted to nurse, I let them, for however long they wanted, then I knew they <br/>
would be full and well nourished.<br/>
<br/>
Some dogs might overeat given the chance, especially if they&#39;ve been used to <br/>
a certain amount each day, so I&#39;m not sure if this change would help you.  <br/>
<br/>
It just made it easier for me to be assured that all four labs are well fed <br/>
and getting enough.<br/>

I have many friends that still do it. BUT...<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re dogs. They can&#39;t speak. One of the best indications that a dog is <br/>
sick is water and food intake. A dog&#39;s instinct is to NOT show <br/>
weakness/sickness---so he may not show you any other signs than being off his <br/>
food or, especially, water. If my dogs aren&#39;t finished in less that two <br/>
minutes, we need to check them out. If I have to fill up the water bowl more <br/>
than once---or not at all---during the day, something&#39;s up, and it&#39;s serious.<br/>

can tell when something is amiss with one of them.<br/>
<br/>
I think you can get a sense for your animals, especially when you are around <br/>
them 24 hours a day, they even sleep in my room (and sneak up on the bed when <br/>
they think we are asleep, like a 60 pound dog can really sneak!).<br/>
<br/>
So I agree that you have to know your pet and their habits.  I have seen some <br/>
dogs that apparently over eat, or maybe my sons insists that they give them <br/>
too much people food that is just bad for them.  It just hasn&#39;t been our <br/>
experience.  Our dogs eat people food, they love fresh fruit and veggies as <br/>
snacks and occasionally I&#39;m sure the neighbor child slips them a bite of <br/>
something she doesn&#39;t really want.<br/>

easily.  If you *really* start being able to feel the ribs, you need to feed<br/>
more.  I hadn&#39;t realized how much food Toby needs when Rod takes him out to<br/>
work with him in the bush.  He runs most of the day.  When he went almost<br/>
every day for a week I  noticed him getting skinnier.  Now I feed him more<br/>

  I tend to agree here. Labs also have a tendency to get overweight. We have a Bullmastiff who goes at around 110lbs right now, although still young, he gets 5 cups a day and is in good health and weight.<br/>

  I didn&#39;t write that first part. Although I would suggest cutting down on the food, I wouldn&#39;t do it all of a sudden or just start at 2 and half cups. Gradually lessen the amount by a half a cup. You might want to try and change the food also. What he&#39;s on might not seem as filling as maybe something else would. All dogs are different. And also just because he&#39;s woofing down his food doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything is wrong. Some dogs just do that. I have a little Beagle that can outeat my Bullmastiff any day. She can eat fast and I assume probably more if I let her. She has a tendency to become overweight and acts like she&#39;s never fed. She&#39;s a real nut that one.<br/>
