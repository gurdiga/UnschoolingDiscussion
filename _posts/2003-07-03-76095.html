&gt; The biggest difference in how I teach is that we focus on what I<br/>
&gt; call &quot;the real.&quot; I have no patience for quizzes (in theater? Give me<br/>
&gt; a break) text books, twaddle. We use quality plays and scenes (I<br/>
&gt; loved doing Shakespeare), we have real performances and we<br/>
&gt; work on acting and directing. I do the directing but am always<br/>
&gt; taking suggestions since the class is very free flowing. I&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; the same basic group of kids for four years and they&#39;ve become<br/>
&gt; so special to me.<br/>

<br/>
My dh and I are actor/directors/teachers too. We have done many years of<br/>
work in public schools and have run the gamut from great to soul-sucking<br/>
experiences. We still do it for money (when the money is right &lt;gg&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My best thing now is working with our hs group. Me and another theater mom<br/>
have done Scene Study with 18-20 kids 9-16 for the last two years. It&#39;s been<br/>
so fun! And just like you said, they love it because it&#39;s real work we&#39;re<br/>
doing. Some of the plays we&#39;ve done: Tartuffe, Servant of Two Masters, Glass<br/>
Menagerie, Miracle Worker.<br/>
<br/>
In the fall, we&#39;re going to try full productions. I&#39;m a bit nervous about<br/>
that large an undertaking, but it&#39;ll be interesting for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Love to hear more about what you&#39;re doing,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Full length is a big challenge. We only meet weekly so I knew I <br/>
couldn&#39;t ever do more than a one act. We did those last year. I <br/>
enjoyed the Shakespeare scenes the most (Have you seen <br/>
&quot;Clues to Acting Shakespeare&quot;--great book!) This last year we <br/>
did Advanced Improvisation. They loved that. Did a performance <br/>
a bit akin to Who&#39;s Line is it Anyway?<br/>
<br/>
This year I&#39;m doing Reader&#39;s Theater with the junior high kids to <br/>
get them ready for my program in high school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun to share about this with other theater moms!<br/>
