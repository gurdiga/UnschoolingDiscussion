by the evaluation option. Did you do that or the test?<br/>
 <br/>
I just did the &quot;Checklist Assessment&quot; from FLO.  It was easy to do and<br/>
now I&#39;ve met that legal requirement.  I was more surprised by things on<br/>
it that my daughter knew that I didn&#39;t know that she knew.  This<br/>
assessment seems to be based on a &quot;typical course of study&quot;.  It had<br/>
sections for the 11 subjects that are required in Washington.  Under each<br/>
subject, there was a list of things that the typical second grade class<br/>
would cover.  I needed to check off the ones my daughter knew.  FLO also<br/>
sells a &quot;free style assessment&quot;.  I am told it has spaces to write about<br/>
what your child does.  I think I will go that route next time, as it<br/>
seems that would be more suitable to unschooling.  We also have the<br/>
option of keeping a portfolio (ie, scrapbook) in lieu of testing. <br/>
Currently, our law does require that the portfolio or assessment needs to<br/>
be reviewed by a person certificated in the field of education.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to remember that WA state law says that the test/assessment is<br/>
for the parent.  We do not have to give the results to anyone, but we are<br/>
required to &quot;make a good faith effort to remedy any deficiencies&quot;.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be reviewed by a person certificated in the field of education.<br/>

met her personally, but the woman who runs FLO &quot;unschooled&quot; as far as I<br/>
can tell.  I am still waiting to get my completed assessment back from<br/>
them.  I suspect that the &quot;C.P.&quot; just signs the assessment, without<br/>
further comment.  I can report back when I get it.<br/>
