<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503285975">Hi Wende.<br/>
<br/>
You said:<br/>
<br/>
Point taken. But mostly, unmotivated to choose her own things to <br/>
do. She<br/>
often  comes to me with the &quot;Mom, I&#39;m bored&quot; thing. I will give her <br/>
some<br/>
ideas, and she usually asks me to choose. I often wonder if I <br/>
have too<br/>
many things available to her, making it tough for her to make a <br/>
decision.<br/>
Does anyone else have this problem?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When I worked with La Leche League years ago (was a leader <br/>
for ten years), I used to notice a couple of extremes in the <br/>
application of total breastfeeding. One was that the mother <br/>
became so consumed with responding to every single need of <br/>
the baby, (fearful that the baby would be damaged if it ever cried <br/>
or fussed) that she became tired and resentful of the little baby <br/>
for doing what it does naturally--and that is, cries for attention <br/>
and milk. Usually this mom would neglect other children, the <br/>
home and spouse all to prevent a fussy baby. The second <br/>
extreme was that the mother felt that if she deviated from the <br/>
philosphy of &quot;demand feeding&quot; at all, that she was a bad mother. <br/>
This kind of mom often rebounded into a scheduled approach to <br/>
nursing with the next baby.<br/>
<br/>
But does that mean that demand feeding isn&#39;t best for the baby? <br/>
No. But it also doesn&#39;t mean that if a baby sits in a swing or uses <br/>
a pacifer or is rocked to sleep by dad that the mother has <br/>
suddenly abandonned her original philosophy either. Common <br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
I think moms forget that we are a part of the relationships we <br/>
nurture. We do have a responsiblity to express our own needs <br/>
and to see that they get met while still meeting those of our kids. <br/>
As adults, we are better at delaying the gratification of our needs <br/>
than our children are, so we should be more clever in how we <br/>
meet both their needs and in how we preserve our sanity. <br/>
Common courtesy and mutual respect are part of being in a <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
When you say that your daughter comes to you bored, that is a <br/>
very real emotion. But it isn&#39;t your job to solve it, even though it <br/>
feels like it is. It&#39;s your job to support her during her boredom <br/>
with a hug and comments like: &quot;Wow. I hate being bored. I bet <br/>
you do too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then get back to work on the thing that is engaging your <br/>
attention. Or invite her to help you out, if that&#39;s appropriate (in our <br/>
house, boredom can always be overcome with housekeeping if <br/>
someone wants to go on and on about it).<br/>
<br/>
Boredom is a precursor to meaningful discovery and <br/>
engagement. But not if it is assuaged too quickly with a pacifier <br/>
(&quot;Here, draw this.&quot; or &quot;Have you read this book?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me that one of the misconceptions of unschooling <br/>
may be that we are responsbile to make sure that our kids don&#39;t <br/>
suffer or have negative emotions--life should be continually full. <br/>
But it isn&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510805115">I didn&#39;t just write this today, but I feel more strongly about it now than I <br/>
did when I wrote it.   <br/>
<br/>
The text is below, but it&#39;s regular home is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore.html">http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s called Bored No More<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another homeschooling mom once wrote, “It&#39;s a valuable lesson to learn to <br/>
deal with boredom, just like all other emotions.” <br/>
<br/>
Until I read that, I hadn’t ever thought of boredom as an emotion. I liked <br/>
the idea. When a child comes to me seeking advice on how to deal with any <br/>
emotional state, I&#39;m flattered and glad for the opportunity. <br/>
<br/>
Traditionally in this culture boredom is seen as a state of sin. “I’m bored” <br/>
is met by unthinking parents with, “Then mop the kitchen,” or “You have a <br/>
thousand dollars’ worth of toys, you can’t be bored,” or “Boredom’s good <br/>
for you.” I believe the VERY common habit of belittling children who use the <br/>
word “bored” should be rethought (or “thought,” since it seems many parents <br/>
have never considered it carefully but just repeat what their parents said to <br/>
them). <br/>
<br/>
If a child came and said she was heartbroken would you tell her she was a <br/>
brat and should clean the garage? If a child came and said he was angry <br/>
enough to hit would you say, “Then sit down and read a book whether you want <br/>
to or not”? Wouldn’t you try to help them? It&#39;s nonsensical to me that some <br/>
parents shame their children for saying they are at a loss about what to do <br/>
next. <br/>
<br/>
The most to be accomplished from punishing or sending bored kids away is that <br/>
the kids will learn not to go to that parent for advice and ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the real message behind &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; is &quot;I&#39;m little and feeling <br/>
agitated and vaguely unhappy and I don&#39;t know what I can do to get over this <br/>
uncomfortable feeling. What would you do if you were my age, in this house, <br/>
on a day like this?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think that deserves a helpful, respectful response. <br/>
<br/>
It is rare that my children say, “I’m bored,” but when they do I walk with <br/>
them where they are, or to some other part of the house, thinking quickly <br/>
about what I might have that they have never seen, or haven’t seen for a <br/>
while. I think of art supplies or games or toys or musical instruments they <br/>
haven’t thought of for a long time. I scan my mind and the house for things <br/>
which would provide some visual, auditory, olfactory, or mental stimulation, <br/>
preferably two or three of those. Tactile stimulation is good too--perhaps <br/>
the offer of a shower or bath with new/different toys, or different soap or <br/>
something. Sometimes “watering the yard” (playing with the hose) will do. <br/>
When a baby cries for no clear reason, parents will often joyfully see <br/>
whether the baby means “I’m uncomfortable.” They’ll try a change of <br/>
clothes, physical contact, a change of temperature, more air, less air, hot <br/>
food, cold food, a stroll outside, a car ride, SOMETHING different. Older <br/>
kids have the same needs, and the expression of that need might come through <br/>
as whining, irritability, or a claim of boredom. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it’s not physical need, but intellectual need. Boredom is a desire for <br/>
input which unschooling parents should welcome. It’s a child saying “How can <br/>
I add excitement to my life?” This can be a big opportunity to introduce a <br/>
new subject, activity, or thought-collection. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it’s an emotional need, and the parent’s undivided attention for a <br/>
little while will solve the problem. A walk, some joking, a hug, inquiries <br/>
about progress on the child’s projects or plans or friends might serve many <br/>
purposes at once. If after a walk and a talk the child is not quite <br/>
refreshed, you still had that time together, which made “I’m bored” a useful <br/>
invitation to bonding. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes “bored” means tired, low on energy, needing a break from conscious <br/>
thought and responsibility. Arranging a nap, or putting on a soothing video <br/>
(even for older kids--a romance instead of an action flick, or light drama <br/>
instead of comedy), leaving a pillow on the couch and herding the rest of the <br/>
family in other directions might result in an unplanned but needed nap. <br/>
<br/>
I’m grown. I still get bored occasionally. Thinking about why I’m bored and <br/>
forgiving myself for being bored have helped me assist my children in <br/>
learning some coping skills they can use in their own lives. I have also used <br/>
my occasional boredom as a trigger to seek out the kids. If there’s a lull in <br/>
my life now I should fill it with those children who will be gone too soon. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome opportunities to learn about when and why your child asks for your <br/>
advice and stimulation. The threshhold of needing the parent will change over <br/>
time, and parents can really use knowing where it is and seeing the benefit <br/>
in it. One complaint of parents of school kids is that communications are <br/>
lacking or are misunderstood. Homeschoolers have the fulltime luxury of the <br/>
chance to do better. Unschoolers have the added advantage of “counting” <br/>
every interaction as a learning experience. Self awareness, interpersonal <br/>
skills, creativity and compassion all come into play when a child and a <br/>
parent can build an uplifting memory from “I’m bored.”</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to too, until someone (and I wish I remembered who) on an unschooling <br/>
discussion board  (on AOL) said boredom was an emotion.  AND WHAM!!!  I <br/>
thought how horrible to tell a child he shouldn&#39;t be bored!  My mom used to <br/>
tell me I wasn&#39;t hungry.   Or &quot;That&#39;s not anything to be unhappy about.&quot;  And <br/>
I thought telling a kid he had no right to be bored had to be just the same <br/>
kind of thing, so I quit right then.<br/>
<br/>
There are other things I&#39;ve learned out of the swirl of idea-exchanges like <br/>
this, and one of the other life changing ones for me was people saying that <br/>
if they wanted their houses to be a certain way that was THEIR problem.  And <br/>
I hadn&#39;t seen it ever as &quot;a problem&quot; before (although I&#39;m not a good <br/>
housekeeper, and really quite a packrat).  I thought wanting a clean house <br/>
was right and normal and justifiable and commendable, and the fact that I <br/>
hadn&#39;t figured out how to do it meant I was some kind of slacker who had no <br/>
skill to be that organized.  Maybe that latter part is true, but I no longer <br/>
believe that the former is true.<br/>
<br/>
So if I want the dishes done, I just do them!  And I&#39;m SO much happier <br/>
thinking &quot;I did the dishes because I felt like it!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
We have hard water and so calcium forms in and around sink fixtures, and the <br/>
toilets get rings of calcium from mineral water.  I bought a <br/>
pumice-on-a-stick toilet cleaning tool and went after the two worst toilets <br/>
and made them look new.  I didn&#39;t even tell anybody.  If they notice, fine; <br/>
if not, fine.  I *THINK* they don&#39;t care one way or another.  But for me, it <br/>
was like a secret difficult project, and I was glad to have my leg well <br/>
enough that I could do something like that.  I don&#39;t think anyone wiped a <br/>
toilet off while I was immobilized, but they also didn&#39;t die of germ-borne <br/>
diseases, and they were all VERY great taking care of me, so rather than rise <br/>
up and shame them about their lack of desire to scrub toilets, I cleaned <br/>
toilets while thinking how grateful I was to have a happy family without a <br/>
bunch of stress and fighting.<br/>

About cleaning:  I felt exactly the same way until I discovered that my second child was having recurring bronchitus due to pet and dust mite allergies.  Lots of changes had to be made including more frequent vacuuming with a good allergy vac.  I had always enjoyed the lifestyle of cleaning being a very low priority but cleaning and all the other environmental changes we made in the house really helped him.<br/>

I agree 100%  and wish I would have conveyed that more clearly in my email.<br/>

  But it&#39;s still the same. *You* have a reason that&#39;s particular to your needs<br/>
  to clean. I wasn&#39;t advocating being a slob. (Though I might be a poster<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And who says a house is for looking nice? Why can&#39;t it be a workshop for our<br/>

We had the same problem here.  It&#39;s been a year and I&#39;m still working on not <br/>
hating it.  Once I get over that I&#39;ll work on doing it because I want to.  I <br/>
try to remember how much I love seeing my kids not sniffling.   But for two <br/>
days now I&#39;ve done nothing.  Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
Just the change in vacuuming (and vacuum) and eliminating mainstream chemical <br/>
cleaners gave me my sense of smell back!<br/>
