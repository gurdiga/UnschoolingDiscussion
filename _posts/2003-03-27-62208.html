<div id="ygrps-yiv-584596435">Hi,<br/>
  I&#39;ve been happily immersed in the Harry Potter books my seventy-something <br/>
mother loaned me.  They were recommended to her by my sister, who has an <br/>
eight year old son.  We all love them.  Anyway, I came up for air after <br/>
number three, and checked my email to discover several hundred messages from <br/>
this group.  I&#39;d like to add my two cents to some recent discussions.<br/>
 TV:  My son is six and he watches what he wants.  Even though the tv was on <br/>
when he woke up yesterday, he walked right past it to ask me to take him to <br/>
the park.  We got dressed and spent most of the day, until the rain came, <br/>
outside.<br/>
 POOP:  This fascinates my son.  He knows which yards in the neighborhood are <br/>
most likely to have dog poop, and always stops our walks to check it out.  He <br/>
recognizes rabbit poop, too, and it&#39;s easy to spot in the snow.  Day before <br/>
yesterday he found some in the field on last autumn&#39;s leaves.  He&#39;s got a <br/>
good eye.  I googled &quot;animal poop&quot; and &quot;animal scat&quot; and got these two sites. <br/>
 Although I don&#39;t expect to step in any exotic poop anytime soon, you never <br/>
know.<br/>

OUR DAILY SCHEDULE:  We don&#39;t have one.  The weather just changed for the <br/>
better, three days ago, so we&#39;ve been out a lot. Walks around the block, to <br/>
the field, to the playground.  Looking for bugs (he found something that <br/>
looked like a small copper colored worm, but had lots of legs), chasing <br/>
robins, observing which flowers are coming up.  Walking to the tracks to see <br/>
if any cars are parked on the siding.  When we get lucky, a train goes by.  I <br/>
was saddened to see how much trash has been dumped since last year, and <br/>
commented on it.  Noticed the doves are back.  They made a nest last year on <br/>
the shelfing unit on our porch that my husband keeps his trusty rusty stuff <br/>
on.  Mother dove stares right through you, and acts like she&#39;s invisible.  I <br/>
can reach right out and grab her, but she totally ignores us.<br/>
   Indoors, my son discovered that his computer games have demos on them, and <br/>
enjoys playing around with them.  He watches tv sometimes, but mostly has a <br/>
few videos he watches over and over.  Mostly Thomas, Blues Clues and Sesame <br/>
Street.  (We also like Steve better.)    My grandson brought over a Zoobily <br/>
Zoo tape, and my son has watched that MANY times since it&#39;s been here.  He <br/>
plays with his Thomas trains every day.  I bought Sweet Streets dollhouses so <br/>
I could play with him when he plays trains, now he plays with the little <br/>
people and houses too. Visits from and to relatives.  Paint.  Lots of games, <br/>
but he doesn&#39;t follow the rules.  He just plays with the pieces how he wants. <br/>
 Notebooks and markers.  We read &quot;a really great book&quot;, usually several, <br/>
before bed each night.  We listen to classical music to help us doze off.  I <br/>
recently found a book on tape of one of his favorites, Franklin.  I thought <br/>
he was going to pop when he heard it was read by Franklin himself.  So we <br/>
listen to that before the music, after the books.<br/>
  I probably forgot half of what I wanted to comment on.<br/>
  Night before last, we were going for one last walk, and looked up at the <br/>
stars.  I was about to say that I&#39;d like to go to the observatory, when he <br/>
sighed and said, &quot;I can&#39;t fly.&quot;  I said I couldn&#39;t either.  He said, &quot;Sorry, <br/>
pal.&quot;<br/>
