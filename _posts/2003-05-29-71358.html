<div id="ygrps-yiv-38017947">As we are moving more towards unschooling I need a little insight <br/>
into if the following is still in line with good unschooling <br/>
practices.  When we first starting *officially* homeschooling, my son <br/>
decided he wanted to learn about Egypt as we had watched some shows <br/>
on it and he got interested.  As we quickly moved to unschooling, I <br/>
bascially read him some books we got from the library, went to <br/>
related field trips and did related projects when they came up and if <br/>
he wanted to do them.  There was no forcing or cajoling on my part, I <br/>
swear &lt;g&gt;!  WE did a number of fun things that he did for as long as <br/>
he was interested and really has alot of fun.   After a good bit of <br/>
time,  he was playing a Scooby Doo PC game about Egypt and saw they <br/>
had another related to knights.  He said he was &quot;done learning about <br/>
Egypt&quot; and wanted to learn about knights, i.e want the new game.  I <br/>
told him, I wanted him to finsih this one at the higher levels before <br/>
we got a new one? (is that okay?).  A new topic is fine with me, so I <br/>
have some books on order at the library and figure we will follow the <br/>
same routine.  I was planning to let him go through the project book <br/>
with me and pick things that interest him, try to plan some field <br/>
trips if I can find any and just take things casually.  Now, is this <br/>
still in line with unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I am having a problem with being sponatneous.  You know, <br/>
it is raining what do we do with ourselves or where should we go <br/>
today.  When we were studying Egypt, I had ideas on the back burner <br/>
so should we have a free moment and he showed interest we had <br/>
something cool and interesting to do.  He learned alot of neat things <br/>
and really had fun doing the project we did.  Anyway, I want to make <br/>
sure that I have things available for us to do during down time so is <br/>
this Okay??  Thanks you any input as we are still defining our path <br/>
here!<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have pressed him to finish a game. That makes it work, and <br/>
assignment, no longer for fun.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t let someone get by without a comment if he said &quot;I&#39;m done learning <br/>
about Egypt.&quot;  I would say &quot;You&#39;ll learn more about Egypt as long as you&#39;re <br/>
alive.  Sometimes lots, sometimes nothing for a year, but the more you know the <br/>
more you&#39;ll know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; A new topic is fine with me, so I <br/>
<br/>
have some books on order at the library and figure we will follow the <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
trips if I can find any and just take things casually.  Now, is this <br/>
<br/>
still in line with unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unit studies.<br/>
<br/>
Why have a routine? <br/>
Why a project book?<br/>
Why field trips?<br/>
<br/>
By that I don&#39;t mean &quot;why field trips,&quot; but why field trips about knighthood? <br/>
 If he&#39;s interested and the interest isn&#39;t extinguished, he will continue to <br/>
learn about knighthood for the rest of his life?  No rush to do it this month. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some great stuff online.  There are coloring books by Dover and <br/>
Bellerophon.  But if you get him one, please don&#39;t tell him you want him to color <br/>
it all before you get him another one.<br/>
<br/>
I have three dozen coloring books I don&#39;t let ANYONE color in.  We&#39;ll <br/>
photocopy pages if anyone wants to color.  I&#39;ve had most of them before I ever had <br/>
kids.  Lots are Dover Clipart stuff (but coloring books, Dover Archive series).<br/>
<br/>
Wander and ramble among all the things in the world.  He will make <br/>
connections on his own.  You don&#39;t have to tell him what is or isn&#39;t related to knights <br/>
or Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
We have pop-up books about both subjects at our house.  If he visited, I&#39;d <br/>
put those out, but wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Your mom says you&#39;re interested in knights.  <br/>
Come here and I will show you all my books about knights and then we will go <br/>
into the garage where you can try on a chainmail coif, and then I&#39;ll show you a <br/>
video on heraldry and then...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can lay things out casually.  You can rent a movie about knights and <br/>
castles without declaring it to be part of his unit.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; When we were studying Egypt, I had ideas on the back burner <br/>
<br/>
so should we have a free moment and he showed interest we had <br/>
<br/>
something cool and interesting to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think if you consider that you were studying Egypt but you are not studying <br/>
Egypt any longer, that you&#39;re a full giant step away from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
=Right now, I am having a problem with being sponatneous.  You know, <br/>
<br/>
it is raining what do we do with ourselves or where should we go <br/>
<br/>
today.=<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s on TV?  Does he know how to play rummy?   Do you want to make cookie?  <br/>
Does he need to blow bubbles in the bathtub?  Has he played with magnets <br/>
lately?  Do you have finger paints?  Have you ever taken the thread out of the <br/>
sewing machine and let him make perforated designs on paper?  He could trace <br/>
magazine photos, or follow lines on notebook paper, or make tickets and then put <br/>
perforations between the main part and the stub.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Projects&quot; don&#39;t have to be weeks or hours long.  They can be five minutes <br/>
long.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good point, I didn&#39;t see it that way.  I think I was worried, he <br/>
would not complete them and look to buy more.  But thinking back, he <br/>
does tend to go back to games so realistically he will finish it at <br/>
some point.  He was getting to a harder level and getting a little <br/>
frustrated.  I wanted to see him push himself past that point (with <br/>
help if need be) but maybe he just wasn&#39;t ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
 I wouldn&#39;t let someone get by without a comment if he said &quot;I&#39;m done <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In all honesty, I felt the same way when he said it.  That statement <br/>
felt very *schooly* for me. In my head, we are not *done*, because if <br/>
something interesting comes up then we would pursue it.  Obviously, I <br/>
have made it very black and white to him if he thinks we have to <br/>
*stop* Egypt to get a new game on knights.  I have to work on that <br/>
one.<br/>

<br/>
I admit it is unit studies.  I knew that, however, I think I was <br/>
trying to keep it as loose and interest oriented as possible assuming <br/>
that if he was happy and learning we were still using a child-led <br/>
learning approach.  Sort of, you pick the topic and any activites and <br/>
go from there.  So if I am understanding correctly, I have to find <br/>
that balance between making his interests available but with no <br/>
beginning and no end?  So now when I bring home books on knights from <br/>
the library do I just leave them out for him to puruse or do I offer <br/>
them?  One book has specific projects, do I show him and allow him to <br/>
choose if interested or scrap it all together?  How do I now get him <br/>
to see Knights as just one thing in the mix and not our *lesson*?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;   But if you get him one, please don&#39;t tell him you want him to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>color <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it all before you get him another one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL..he hates to color, that would never happen here &lt;g&gt;!!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the ideas.  I am definitely still caught in the schooling <br/>
world myself.  I think I am having a hard time drawing the line <br/>
between exposing him to ideas and the world and lessons.  For <br/>
example, with Egypt I offered to let him do heiroglyphics with <br/>
stampers which I thought he would enjoy because he hates writing.  He <br/>
ended up coloring and drawing on his own for over an hour and he <br/>
HATES writing.  I am worried without such ideas on the back burner, <br/>
we will not do these types of things which turned out to be fun and a <br/>
great learning experience.  Learning about Egypt led us to so many <br/>
cool things.  However, I think what I am understanding is that if I <br/>
hear about more cool Egypt projects I can still offer them and we can <br/>
still continue and at the same time talk and learn about about <br/>
knights and pirates and whatever.  Now to implement...that is the <br/>
hard part!!<br/>

Great point. Loved your post Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
i realized in the last six months that I had a firm hieracrhy of <br/>
learning in place. When a child showed interest in Egypt or <br/>
knights, I&#39;d think: Hey! This is important and natural. Then he&#39;d <br/>
want to watch Kung Pao: Enter the Dragon and I&#39;d sort of glaze <br/>
over waiting for the next &quot;real&quot; interest to emerge. It&#39;s taken me <br/>
six months to change my thinking about learningthat learning <br/>
about knights is not superior to learning how to beat the next <br/>
level in Shrek on X box.<br/>
<br/>
My job isn&#39;t to create lists of activites that tie together. And it isn&#39;t <br/>
to create activities at all. It&#39;s to be available. And right now my <br/>
daughter is asking me to come so I&#39;d better go. :)<br/>

left the old can opener on his workbench in the basement, if R. would <br/>

part the entire can opener, examining how the gears worked, wondering <br/>

All I did was offer him an old can opener.<br/>

&lt;&lt;He said he was &quot;done learning about Egypt&quot; and wanted to learn about<br/>
knights, i.e want the new game.  I<br/>
told him, I wanted him to finsih this one at the higher levels before we got<br/>
a new one? (is that okay?). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well you said it right there. &quot;He&quot; was done learning about Egypt. So no,<br/>
wanting him to on when he was finished isn&#39;t my idea of unschooling. When<br/>
the kids want to do something, they do. But you have to be willing to say<br/>
okay when they want to stop. No matter how you feel it should be done. Here,<br/>
I also don&#39;t ask my kids if they want to do something that&#39;s educational. I<br/>
let them decide that. I&#39;ll say how about the park today or the museum,<br/>
(that&#39;s fun for them) or buy something I think they might like and show them<br/>
where I&#39;m putting it. But I never suggest doing projects. Those are things,<br/>
if they are interested in that they come up with on their own. And projects<br/>
for them aren&#39;t a big interest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Right now, I am having a problem with being sponatneous.  You know,  it is<br/>
raining what do we do with ourselves or where should we go today. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel like you have to do something or go somewhere every day. We do a<br/>
lot of just hanging out at home. The kids play. It&#39;s as easy as that. Don&#39;t<br/>
always look at educational things they need every day. They will get it but<br/>
it doesn&#39;t have to be something you always see in school terms. Just let<br/>
them play and you do what you do around the house. Watch tv, play games,<br/>
bake cookies, do puzzles. Just let the day happen without feeling like you<br/>
have to plan something for them to do.<br/>

to create activities at all. It&#39;s to be available.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And to help make the world available and accessible and attractive.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that makes me cringe sometimes with families in which <br/>
they&#39;re saying unschooling isn&#39;t working is that one or both of the parents will be <br/>
entirely judgmental about LOTS of stuff.  Half the music in the world is <br/>
&quot;stupid,&quot; and movies are &quot;babyish&quot; and games are &quot;too easy for you&quot; and once half <br/>
the world is branded (subtly or not) as unworthy of exploration, those <br/>
children are living in a half-sized world.<br/>
<br/>
Helping keep the world big is a good thing for parents to do.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t feel like you have to do something or go somewhere every day. We do a<br/>
<br/>
lot of just hanging out at home. The kids play. It&#39;s as easy as that. Don&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
always look at educational things they need every day. They will get it but<br/>
<br/>
it doesn&#39;t have to be something you always see in school terms. Just let<br/>
<br/>
them play and you do what you do around the house. Watch tv, play games,<br/>
<br/>
bake cookies, do puzzles. Just let the day happen without feeling like you<br/>
<br/>
have to plan something for them to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this, but some families get stuck and don&#39;t go out enough.  <br/>
There should be a balance.  Neither out every day nor home every day is optimal.<br/>

Yes of course. But what I seem to see around here with homeschooling<br/>
families is that they get stuck the other way. Feeling like they have to<br/>
find &quot;something&quot; to do outside the house almost every day. I think it&#39;s<br/>
starts with homeschoolers and that socialization word. They worry so that<br/>
they become travel agents on a daily basis. If the children choose to go out<br/>
every day and the parent does fine with that, then I would say that&#39;s great.<br/>
But I know sometimes when we&#39;ve had a full week, my kids just really want to<br/>
stay home and hang out. Now of coure there&#39;s the backyard, sand box,<br/>
swingset, pool so it&#39;s not like they are hermits. But Joseph for one doesn&#39;t<br/>
like to be out and about too much. And I&#39;m lucky that I can let him stay<br/>
home and take the 2 younger girls out and about with me. But I never feel<br/>
like I have to plan outtings on a regular basis. There are days that go by<br/>
and we just find tons of stuff here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168246608">Yesterday was a good day also.<br/>
<br/>
We had gone to scholastic books warehouse sale and Dustin found a book 101 <br/>
science experiments.  He spent half the day and part of this am trying some <br/>
experiments out and ended up running with his own. <br/>
The effect of bug spray on weeds, Food coloring and color changes, Weights of <br/>
water, oil and food coloring, Vinegar and baking soda rockets and some other <br/>
mixtures. <br/>
<br/>
He then broke out the glue gun and made a pen/junk holder out of blank CD&#39;s.  <br/>
He is working on making book ends out of them also.<br/>
He also watched the Mummy Returns (5th time this week) and is now riding his <br/>
bike with some friends.<br/>
My DH has been in and out of the hospital with a couple bad teeth and has <br/>
required several IV&#39;s and lots of rest so I am thrilled the oldest has found some <br/>
things to do this week.<br/>

&gt; and wondered aloud how it worked inside.  I remarked that daddy had <br/>
