&gt; by gaining from other&#39;s wisdom and experiences, so . . . got more expert <br/>

&gt; &gt; (by the way, for what it&#39;s worth and for the times i do use them, i love <br/>
&gt; &gt; the saxon approach and they work quite effectively for my children, so <br/>
&gt; saxon is <br/>
&gt; &gt; not a concern in my case.)<br/>
