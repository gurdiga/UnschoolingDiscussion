<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496040753">Hi, I&#39;m new to this group and I&#39;ve been reading the posts to try to <br/>
get a feel for the board. The video game topic leaped out at me! My <br/>
9 yo ds *loves* the strategy/role-playing games (zelda, etc.) and <br/>
spends literally hours playing the actual games, researching cheat <br/>
codes on the internet and scouring the guidebooks. Since we are <br/>
relatively new to unschooling, we still get a lot of &quot;but what&#39;s he <br/>
doing for school&quot; type questions from well-meaning friends and <br/>
family. I would love any thoughts and comments on the value of video <br/>
games from you all.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa :)</div>
