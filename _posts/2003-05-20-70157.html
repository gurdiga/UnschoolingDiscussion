<div id="ygrps-yiv-405137421">I realize this is not a medical group.. lol.. But, it IS the largest <br/>
membership of parents of any  group that I am on.   I have been googling and <br/>
searching other sites online and so far have come up with nothing.  I am <br/>
taking JP to the Dr for this problem ASAP in the morning.  I would like to <br/>
know if anyone  has ever experienced anything like this or has any idea what <br/>
may have caused it.   <br/>
<br/>
JP starting complaining with a sore throat on Sunday.  Typical allergy <br/>
related symtoms.  runny nose, sinus drainage, sore throat.    Sunday night he <br/>
felt hot in the bed with us, he was restless, got up alot with &quot;snot choking <br/>
him&quot; and generally felt worse throughout the night.  Monday morning, he slept <br/>
VERY late ( after getting up very early and taking some medicine)  He felt <br/>
warm on and off all day, but nothing extreme.  He laid in the bed pretty much <br/>
all day, no appetite or energy.  But, by evening, he was feeling a little <br/>
better.  He ate supper and stayed up til his normal bed time.  He slept well <br/>
last night.  He still has cold/allergy symptoms today, but in general, he has <br/>
felt much better. <br/>
<br/>
Also yesterday, he came to me and said that &quot;his balls were red and hot&quot;  I <br/>
asked him if they hurt, or if it hurt when he peed, she said, &quot;no, I think <br/>
they are just too hot from my fever&quot;    Then again today, he asked me &quot;what <br/>
do balls look like?&quot;  I said, &quot;what?, what do you mean, do you think yours <br/>
look &quot;funny&quot;, do they look different than normal?&quot;  He again said &quot;no&quot;.. He <br/>
said he meant on the inside.. and I told him we would look it up on the <br/>
internet to see a picture of inside your testicles.. OK. .then later again <br/>
this evening, he came to me and said his ball were hot.  So, this time, I <br/>
said.. well, let me look at them.   I took a look and his whole groin area is <br/>
red and irritatied looking.. Like.. around his pubic area ( where a man <br/>
normally has hair), all down his scrotum, its red, similar to a diaper rash.  <br/>
 The area is hot, like a heat rash.   His scrotum looked a little swollen, <br/>
but, not a lot.. its really hard for me to tell if its swollen.     He said <br/>
it hurt when he walks, from what he described, not an &quot;inside pain&quot; but an <br/>
outer irriation.  I had him put on some loose boxers and he is just taking it <br/>
easy right now. <br/>
<br/>
 My husband was VERY concerned.   I am more puzzled than anything.  I have <br/>
never seen anything like this on a boy his age.  He does not wet his pants, <br/>
and he has not been hot and sweaty from playing or anything.. No tight <br/>
underwear or pants.   Dh is afraid it is some kind of infection..    I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure he does have the beginnings of a sinus infection, but nothing <br/>
that I have been alarmed about.   So, anybody have any clues?  All the leads <br/>
I have found online have been dead ends.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89657659">I agree that you should take him to a doctor.<br/>
<br/>
It does sound like an infection of some kind.  Allergies do not cause fevers.  Infections do.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like both conditions could be related.  <br/>
Possibly strep?  Try looking up testiculitis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388825399">Hi Teresa --<br/>
<br/>
I would, personally, call your doctor&#39;s office this evening -- they&#39;ll have <br/>
an emergency number or a service that will page someone.  They get paid to be <br/>
available like this just in case, so don&#39;t feel bad about it.  It might be <br/>
better for JP to be seen immediately than to wait another night.  Only your <br/>
doctor is really qualified to say.<br/>
<br/>
My source says, *Pain in the scrotum is of serious concern...if pain persists <br/>
for more than several hours or is acccompanied by swelling, see the doctor.  <br/>
If there has been no trauma (injury), your child may be experiencing either a <br/>
twisting of the testicle or an infection of the stalk of the testicle <br/>
(epididymitis).  Both of these conditions need immediate attention.*<br/>
<br/>
The accompanying chart recommends seeing the doctor immediately if swelling <br/>
is accompanied by any of the following: pain, vomiting, abnormal color, or <br/>
fever.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t wait before at least calling my doctor tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and keep us posted.<br/>
<br/>
Laura B.</div>
