Dawn has brought up some very good points.<br/>
<br/>
I recently saw a biograghy of Sidney Poitier, his formal education finished with the 2nd. grade.<br/>
He educated himself from then on.<br/>
Later in life reading five newspapers a day.....<br/>
Not only a wonderful actor but became a very influential man and an ambassidor for the Bahamas to Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Sidney Poitier is one of our most famous and enduring artists. His career defined and documented the modern history of<br/>
blacks in American film. This notably shy and private man portrayed proud and powerful characters. His depiction of<br/>
blacks on the stage, in the movies, and on television was and remains revolutionary. More than an actor (and<br/>
Academy-Award winner), Poitier is an artist -- a writer and director, a thinker and critic, a humanitarian and diplomat.<br/>
His presence as a cultural icon has long been one of protest and humanity.<br/>

I have been sickened by the focus of money, money, money of this country.<br/>
If going to school means you&#39;ll make money......why are college grads. working retail & fast food?<br/>
There is no guarantees there will be a job when you get out of school.<br/>
And what is the point of making big bucks if you never have time to enjoy life or the people you love?<br/>
<br/>
How many times have we all heard the stories of people struggling to go and pay for schooling, working hard, long hours<br/>
all their lives and dying before they get a chance to even live.<br/>
<br/>
Money shouldn&#39;t be the main focus of life.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand if there are things you want out of life that are pricey, you&#39;ll have to find the way to afford them.<br/>
However, that is not for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It may make life easier sometimes but, it won&#39;t love you or make your life worth living.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, Kathy<br/>

Interesting that the school believes money is the &quot;thing&quot; we ought to be<br/>
focusing on that makes us &quot;wealthy&quot;.  What about the love we have to<br/>
give to others, ourselves and doing something we love for a living that<br/>
we are passionate about, regardless of the money it brings us.  It also<br/>
leaves out those people that didn&#39;t finish high school and still became<br/>
financially wealthy such as Dave Thomas the founder of Wendys.<br/>
<br/>
So as usual the school is single minded in its belief that money is the<br/>
answer to everything and that money will make everything better.  Ask<br/>
those people who become instant millionaires when they won the lottery<br/>
what it did for them emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a vast difference between someone who &quot;drops out&quot; of<br/>
school and someone who voluntarily doesn&#39;t go to school at all because<br/>
they choose to use the world as their way of learning.  Even the drop<br/>
outs have the right idea when they don&#39;t want to stay in school because<br/>
there are bored, uninspired and cannot connect with what adults<br/>
disguised as &quot;teachers&quot; believe they need to know.</div>
