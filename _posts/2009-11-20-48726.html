<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798180784">Aha!  I didn&#39;t know this.  &quot;Tutor&quot; isn&#39;t about teaching, it&#39;s about  <br/>
being with someone.  (As to the word&#39;s original root meaning, I mean.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
tutelage<br/>
This noun has a handful of jobs, all of which blend imperceptibly into  <br/>
each other while never drifting too far from the Latin root tueri,  <br/>
&quot;look at, guard.&quot; Tutelage can be (1) what a tutor does, (2) what a  <br/>
guardian does (i.e., guardianship), or what a trustee does (i.e.,  <br/>
trusteeship).<br/>
<br/>
As it has to do with trust and guardianship, if we guard our  <br/>
children&#39;s learning space, maybe unschoolers can say with all honesty  <br/>
that they tutor their children at home.  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4477548">Funny... :) I do say this from time to time, when talking with someone who has provided their anti-homeschooling stance, then ask about my kids, I say, &quot;They&#39;re tutored.&quot; <br/>
