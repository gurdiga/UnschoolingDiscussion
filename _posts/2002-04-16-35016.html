Kirby&#39;s going to see the Count of Monte Cristo with a friend of his <br/>
Wednesday.  I said before he went I wanted him to watch The Adventures of <br/>
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert--that it would make the show much more fun for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
So he agreed.  He, Marty, Holly, Brett (another unschooling regular, since <br/>
3rd grade, often at our house) and I sat down and watched it.  Holly had seen <br/>
it.  So I wanted them to notice Guy Pearce, who plays the youngest of the <br/>
drag queens, and also the bad guy in the Count of Monte Cristo (also the lead <br/>
in Memento, which only Marty and I had seen, and which is a disturbing <br/>
movie).   What I did NOT know is that the other two drag-queen-playing actors <br/>
were recognizeable to the boys.  One was in the Matrix (Hugo Weaving)--Kirby <br/>
pointed that one out.  And although I knew but couldn&#39;t picture Terrence <br/>
Stamp in Superman III, Marty sat up straight when the show was almost over <br/>
and said &quot;I have seen him in another movie--he played someone&#39;s teacher.&quot;  <br/>
After agitating and searching his memory banks, he dug up &quot;Young Guns&quot; out of <br/>
the basket of westerns his dad gathered up for him for research purposes  <br/>
(for an RPG he&#39;s making with Brett), and sure enough--stuck it in and we saw <br/>
nearly the same phrase and gesture he had recognized in &quot;Bernadette.&quot;  Then <br/>
we put in the Matrix video and took a look at THAT very different character!<br/>
<br/>
It was some weird family togetherness, but it was a lot of fun.<br/>
