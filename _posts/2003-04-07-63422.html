<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473465598">**Again, the question I was asking was whether I was doing enough by just <br/>
<br/>
basically ignoring math and being OK with it to Cait as to whether she <br/>
<br/>
learned it or not, or if as a parent there is a responsibility to find a cool <br/>
<br/>
fun way to expose them to EVERYTHING.**<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we ask questions and find out that the answers aren&#39;t helpful, <br/>
maybe we&#39;re asking the wrong questions.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve settled on *one*thing that might stand in her way and are obsessing <br/>
over (NOT ignoring it but worrying over it) while dismissing ideas as &quot;too <br/>
involved&quot; that might actually help the child to get an idea of whether being <br/>
a doctor is actually truly something she might be interested in in real life <br/>
not just in imagination.<br/>
<br/>
**That sounds way more involved than buying software and letting her know <br/>
it&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
there if she wants it or buying a book and leaving it around.**<br/>
<br/>
It probably is. Our responsibility as unschoolers of providing opportunities <br/>
and resources extends to far more than providing software and books. Real <br/>
life is more than that. Providing resources also means giving them access to <br/>
opportunities and people and places. Buying stuff is easy by comparison.<br/>
<br/>
**Nice clean <br/>
<br/>
cadavers are much preferable to stinky squashed animals and there will be <br/>
<br/>
time for that when and if she gets to medical school or if she still wants to <br/>
<br/>
do that.  After all I doubt you get any extra consideration because your mom <br/>
<br/>
brought roadkill home for you.**<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about getting consideration for getting into medical school. It&#39;s <br/>
about having opportunities right now to explore whether or not this is <br/>
actually something the child is interested in. For most people, finding out <br/>
in medical school that having to deal with real bleeding sick bodies is NOT <br/>
what they want to do is WAY TOO LATE. They&#39;ve already invested so much time <br/>
and money and energy in the pursuit of being &quot;a doctor&quot; that they just can&#39;t <br/>
bring themselves to quit at that point. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be roadkill, but the point is that &quot;getting ready for med <br/>
school&quot; should be more about exploring the idea of being a doctor at this <br/>
point, and less about specific requirements. When a child has had opportunity <br/>
to really see what a specific career is about and wants to pursue it they <br/>
usually have motivation to do whatever they need to do to get there.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, often kids settle on saying &quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;lawyer&quot; or <br/>
&quot;teacher&quot; when asked about career goals because they know those answers will <br/>
be &quot;good enough&quot; to satisfy the questioner and they won&#39;t have to answer a <br/>
lot more questions about the matter, where &quot;historian&quot; or &quot;gamer&quot; or &quot;writer&quot; <br/>
will get them questions and comments about practicality etc. Especially if <br/>
they live in families where at least one of their parents believes that the <br/>
only possibilities are college on the one hand and living at home forever on <br/>
the other hand. :)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, meant to write more, and softer. Maybe later. :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not the case here, there is an entire gamut of possibilities, limited <br/>
only by my child&#39;s own choices and she&#39;s well aware of them.<br/>
<br/>
Cait has spent a day in a clinic with a doctor friend of the family.  She&#39;s <br/>
seen some pretty sad things.  This same doctor has been &quot;many&quot; things as a <br/>
doctor and is currently an Internist but he&#39;s been a missionary doctor in <br/>
Africa, a soccer player in England, oh the list goes on and on and he&#39;s very <br/>
willing to share with Cait his experiences and allow her the freedom of <br/>
exploring his world.<br/>
<br/>
There are other equally good resources I am sure.  I personally think he <br/>
desire stems from her spending a good portion of her toddler years in and out <br/>
of the hospital and becoming so familiar with the surroundings and procedures <br/>
and medical staff. But I might be wrong, I&#39;m never sure I&#39;m right about what <br/>
drives a young mind to anything in particular.<br/>
<br/>
I think those that have posted about just ignoring the math until she decides <br/>
she HAS to do it or not are very helpful.  They&#39;ve reinforced to me my <br/>
thoughts that it&#39;s not bad to NOT have any math at a particular time, there <br/>
is always more time, well almost always anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the helpful suggestions regarding what is really MY issue and <br/>
what to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749388806">about having opportunities right now to explore whether or not this is <br/>
actually something the child is interested in.<br/>
<br/>
This is kind of a tangent here, but did anyone else see the Bill Moyer&#39;s <br/>
series on Chinese Americans?  One of the women he interviewed extensively got <br/>
into Berkeley and was planning on being a doctor.  She described the college <br/>
interviewer asking why being a doctor would make her happy.  She thought it <br/>
was the most ridiculous question anyone could have asked.  What did her <br/>
interests, her happiness have to do with it?  She was always going to be a <br/>
doctor.  <br/>
<br/>
She eventually rebelled and found her calling as a writer.  Causing great <br/>
stress in her family, but being true to herself.  It&#39;s much easier to be true <br/>
all along, I think.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought it was an interesting comment on the cult of a pre-med <br/>
discipline we faced growing up and children are still facing today.  Also, it <br/>
was interesting to see how strongly cultures can push their children to <br/>
succeed to a standard the children might not own.<br/>

encourage your child to even THINK about being a doctor.  It&#39;s a constant <br/>
game with insurance companies and trying to get paid, lots and LOTS of hours, <br/>
huge students loans, unless of course you get scholarships.<br/>
<br/>
If you as a parent were to examine the idea of what to &quot;encourage&quot; your child <br/>
to be to earn the most money and have the most prestige it wouldn&#39;t be to <br/>
become a doctor for sure!  <br/>
<br/>
It would BE... A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE!!!!  But then of course that is <br/>
considering they have any talent in that area, but as for anything else, I <br/>
guess you would have to have some kind aptitude for whatever you do. <br/>
<br/>
 I have an older son who is an apprentice to a master carpenter.  He&#39;s doing <br/>
what he loves.  He doesn&#39;t make much money, is often cold and wet while <br/>
working or sunburned beyond belief but it makes him happy and isn&#39;t that all <br/>
that matters?  Well mostly in this world anyway.<br/>

a bed and breakfast for many years right across the street from the gas<br/>
station and store before I realized it. (He took some liberties with the<br/>
illustrations. The store and gas station aren&#39;t right across from the water.<br/>
There are houses between them and the water and the water is about 100 yards<br/>
from the road.)<br/>
<br/>
The town is pretty much the same. The gas station looks *exactly* the same<br/>
and the store is still a store but sort of a upscape country store for the<br/>
yachters that anchor in the harbor during the summer.<br/>

Fine.  All day he has been telling me what X + X is etc.  Then he asks if I<br/>
can make some math homework for him to learn math.  I told him he doesn&#39;t<br/>
need &quot;homework&quot; to learn math.  If he keeps doing what he&#39;s doing, he&#39;ll<br/>
learn.  Now, Connor has never been to school a day in his life and never<br/>
wanted to go for that matter.  :o)  The only &quot;school&quot; he&#39;s ever seen is on<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He just wants you do give him a way to practice - so do it.<br/>
<br/>
One fun way is to hold up both hands, with, let&#39;s say, 3 finders up, <br/>
the rest down. Then put your hands behind your back and bring them back <br/>
out with, say, 7 fingers up. Have him say how many you now have up and <br/>
how many MORE you have up than you did before (7 up and 4 more). Or if <br/>
he gets good at that, do it in reverse - hold up 7 fingers, then put <br/>
your hands behind your back and bring them back out with only 3 held <br/>
up. He should say how many disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - he might be wanting paper and pencil practice - so either write <br/>
him up some, or find an internet site that creates practice pages that <br/>
he can type the answers right in online or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I think he pushed some of your buttons, calling it homework, but <br/>
remember it doesn&#39;t mean anything to him other than he wants you to <br/>
give him some practice pages.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing wrong with practice. If he wanted to practice hitting a <br/>
baseball, you&#39;d help him with that, right? Have the same attitude. Have <br/>
fun with it.<br/>
