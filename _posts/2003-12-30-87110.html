<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575320687">Hello, my name is Alysia and I am homeschooling my son Zachary (3 <br/>
years). I knew before he was born that I wanted to HS and with that <br/>
in mind I began a pursuit of a Master&#39;s in Education at The <br/>
University of Toledo. After a long road I anticipate a Spring <br/>
Graduation! The last requirement of my degree is a Master&#39;s Project. <br/>
After many advisors telling me &quot;no&quot;, I have finaly found one open to <br/>
my project being based on homeschooling. <br/>
I am researching certified teachers that have choosen to HS their own <br/>
children. As a former teaching professional, I found it to be very <br/>
close to my heart. Many people at the University are concerned that I <br/>
will not find enough participants for my project. I have faith that <br/>
they are out they are willing to help. <br/>
<br/>
If you are, or know a teacher that homeschooled please consider <br/>
participating. I have a brief survey that can be easily emailed. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this! <br/>

going to help anyone homeschool, even if they&#39;re doing school at home. I do <br/>

their teacher training got in the way. It was something they had to lose.<br/>

I have been away from the list for quite a while.  We moved from CA <br/>
to NV and were waiting for a home to be built so I was without a <br/>
computer at a hotel.  My point is that maybe I don&#39;t have much room <br/>
to comment here but I just had to say something (I&#39;ve never been <br/>
very good at keeping my opinion to myself).  <br/>
<br/>
As I was reading the first post about getting a Master&#39;s in <br/>
Education, I thought this exact same thing that Tia and Sandra <br/>
did!   &lt;&lt;I&#39;m scratching my head wondering how in the heck a Master&#39;s <br/>
in Education is going to help anyone homeschool, even if they&#39;re <br/>
doing school at home.&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;And the time spent in class away from the <br/>
child...Sad.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m actually tring to figure out when you had time to get a Master&#39;s <br/>
degree in anything with a 3 year old around.  I hardly have time to <br/>
vacuum!  I certainly hope it dosen&#39;t take a Master&#39;s in Education <br/>
becuase I never even went to college and am planning on unschooling <br/>
my 2 year old.  Which brings me to my next question but I think I&#39;ll <br/>
start a new post about that since it has nothing to do with this one.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got my PhD with 3 kids. For a long time I joked that I had more children <br/>
than chapters, but that changed.  I actually hand-wrote much of my <br/>
dissertation because I worked in the playroom with my kids. I also worked <br/>
at night and in the wee-wee hours.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found my education background particularly detrimental to <br/>
unschooling, but I was not an ed. major. I was an English major; I taught <br/>
at Penn State for 6 years before we moved away. Part of my dissertation <br/>
deals with the early stages of what became liberal, public education and <br/>
the beginnings of women&#39;s education. This has actually helped me to see <br/>
education as just a bunch of theories laid out by guys like Jean-Jacques <br/>
Rousseau who really didn&#39;t have a whole lot to recommend them.<br/>
<br/>
While I don&#39;t use my education in homeschooling, I think it did give me a <br/>
certain amount of confidence in myself. I think I&#39;m far more capable than <br/>
anyone else of deciding what&#39;s best for my children--hubris that may or may <br/>
not have been there otherwise. I taught lots of education majors, and they <br/>
were, as a group, some of the worst students I had. Unable to write <br/>
coherent thoughts or punctuate and dead set against anything that resembled <br/>
critical inquiry. That&#39;s what really made me begin to look into homeschooling.<br/>
