 </span></blockquote>I TOTALLY agree!  My religious beliefs include respecting the decisions and<br/>
differences of others and not thinking that I have a monopoly on truth or<br/>
the &quot;one right way&quot; to do anything.  This includes lifestyle choices like<br/>
family dynamics.  When we start to say it &quot;should be this way&quot; or &quot;that is<br/>
the wrong way&quot; we have to examine our reasons for thinking this.  We are<br/>
pointing fingers here and we had better have a damned good reason for doing<br/>
it.  Are these opinions purely motivated by a respect for others and a<br/>
desire to  aid and encourage them along a life path that makes them happy<br/>
and brings them fulfillment?  Or are we passing judgements on others based<br/>
on the idea that we know &quot;the truth?&quot;<br/>
