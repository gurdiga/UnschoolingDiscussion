  close to what you have in mind?<br/>

  &gt; &gt; 1229 Avondale Ave<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Anytown, OH 45444<br/>
  &gt; &gt; 3) Name, address and telephone number (telephone number optional) of<br/>
  &gt; &gt; person(s) who will be teaching the child the subjects set forth in<br/>
  &gt; paragraph<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (a)(5) of this rule, if other than the parent;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; 4) full name and birthdate of child to be educated at home;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Jimmie J. Doe 1/15/91<br/>
  &gt; &gt; 5) Assurance that home education will include the following, except that<br/>
  &gt; home<br/>
  &gt; &gt; education shall not be required to include any concept, topic or<br/>
  practice<br/>
  &gt; &gt; that is in conflict with the sincerely held religious beliefs of the<br/>
  &gt; parent:<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (a) language, reading, spelling and writing<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (b) geography, history of the United States and Ohio; and national,<br/>
  state<br/>
  &gt; and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; local government;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (c) mathematics;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (d) science;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (e) health;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (f) physical education;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (g) fine arts, including music; and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (h) first aid, safety, and fire prevention<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; I attest that the above subjects will be included in our course of<br/>
  study.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; 6) Brief outline of the intended curriculum for the current year. Such<br/>
  &gt; &gt; outline is for informational purposes only.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Unlike public schools and some home schooling families, we do not decide<br/>
  &gt; in<br/>
  &gt; &gt; advance what we will cover over the course of the year.  We have made<br/>
  &gt; &gt; assurances in section #5 that the required areas will be covered and in<br/>
  #8<br/>
  &gt; &gt; that a minimum of 900 hours of home education will occur.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; We intentionally strive to allow our curriculum to be interest-driven;<br/>
  &gt; that<br/>
  &gt; &gt; is, based on the interests of each child.  With our guidance our<br/>
  children<br/>
  &gt; &gt; decide what, when and how they will learn.  We want them to be active<br/>
  &gt; &gt; participants in their education, not passive receivers.  It is our<br/>
  belief<br/>
  &gt; &gt; that through this process their self-esteem will be preserved and they<br/>
  &gt; will<br/>
  &gt; &gt; be empowered to make good choices throughout their lives.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; We have access to and knowledge of typical public school curricula and<br/>
  &gt; take<br/>
  &gt; &gt; those into consideration as we offer opportunities to our children<br/>
  (which<br/>
  &gt; we<br/>
  &gt; &gt; do in abundance). We believe that the most developmentally interests and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; needs.  Because our children do not naturally divide the world into<br/>
  &gt; &gt; curriculum areas (language arts, math, etc) our curriculum is inherently<br/>
  &gt; &gt; integrated.  The children may pursue interests for varying lengths of<br/>
  time<br/>
  &gt; &gt; (hours to months) and one interest often leads naturally to another.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; When it is time for our children&#39;s portfolios to be reviewed by a<br/>
  &gt; certified<br/>
  &gt; &gt; teacher, we collect our many journals, photograph, scrapbooks, and<br/>
  &gt; projects,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; to show all of the interesting things they have discovered and the<br/>
  skills<br/>
  &gt; &gt; they have acquired in the process.  This is our course of study; it is<br/>
  an<br/>
  &gt; &gt; after-the-fact curicullum.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; 7) List of textbooks, correspondence courses, commercial curricula, or<br/>
  &gt; other<br/>
  &gt; &gt; basic teaching materials that the parent intends to use, and who will<br/>
  have<br/>
  &gt; &gt; the primary responsibility for instruction.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Our list may include some or all of the below listed materials:<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Library books<br/>
  &gt; &gt; books we own (100&#39;s of them!)<br/>
  &gt; &gt; woodworking<br/>
  &gt; &gt; gardening<br/>
  &gt; &gt; theater<br/>
  &gt; &gt; videos<br/>
  &gt; &gt; CD ROM&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; &gt; educational television<br/>
  &gt; &gt; music tapes/cd&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; &gt; local businesses<br/>
  &gt; &gt; textbooks that meet what we want to learn<br/>
  &gt; &gt; discussions with those who are involved directly in what he wants to<br/>
  learn<br/>
  &gt; &gt; the computer<br/>
  &gt; &gt; the internet<br/>
  &gt; &gt; encyclopedias<br/>
  &gt; &gt; our weekly homeschooling support group<br/>
  &gt; &gt; newspapers<br/>
  &gt; &gt; magazines<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  art materials found in our home<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  art classes offered by an outside source<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  music lessons<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  playing team sports<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  Scouting<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  vacations<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  Religious activities<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  games<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  puzzles<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  manipulatives<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  museums<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  local parks<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  volunteer activities<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  aquariums<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  zoos<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  community involvement opportunities<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  dictionaries<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  County Metro Park activities<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  state/national parks<br/>
  &gt; &gt;  nature hikes<br/>
  &gt; &gt; 8) Each child must receive at least 900 hours of instruction per year<br/>
  (the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; equivalent of 180 school days) from a person with a high school diploma<br/>
  or<br/>
  &gt; &gt; the demonstrated equivalent.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Jimmie will receive at least 900 hours of instruction from myself or his<br/>
  &gt; father,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; both of whom have at least high school diplomas.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; 9) Home instruction may be provided by a person who does not have a high<br/>
  &gt; &gt; school diploma if he or she is working under the direction of a person<br/>
  &gt; &gt; holding a baccalaureate degree from a recognized college until the<br/>
  child&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; or<br/>
  &gt; &gt; children&#39;s test results demonstrate reasonable proficiency or until the<br/>
  &gt; home<br/>
  &gt; &gt; teacher obtains a high school diploma or the certificate of high school<br/>
  &gt; &gt; equivalence.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; This is not applicable.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; 10) The parent(s) shall affirm the information supplied with his or her<br/>
  &gt; &gt; signature prior to providing it to the superintendent.<br/>
