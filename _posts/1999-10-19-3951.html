<div id="ygrps-yiv-561367853">thankyou nancy for the wonderful testamoni. i want to hear more like it. my son<br/>
is an avid reader and i hope he does well on the test next year. i&#39;m afraid he<br/>
won&#39;t like studying for the test. i plan to get a ged prep book to look at.<br/>
i&#39;ve seen them and they are all so thick!<br/>
as unschoolers i figured the goal should just be to get the ged asap so he can<br/>
go on and take the courses he needs to reach his goal of being a pilot.  no<br/>
need to waste time sitting and dreaming about it ~~ do it.<br/>

&gt; I took my state equivalancy test as soon as I was old enough (16) for which<br/>
&gt; I did not study, passed with flying colors and proceeded to college<br/>
&gt; directly.  Later, when I moved to another state, I took the GED and did not<br/>
&gt; study for that either.  Again passed with very good marks, even making 80%<br/>
&gt; in math, which I had always thought myself a failure in.  I failed Algebra<br/>
&gt; 4 times in various grades, and just did not enjoy math classes at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I actually got out of Highschool when I was 14, forcing my parents to put<br/>
&gt; me into an independent study school, and studied mostly only things I was<br/>
&gt; interested in.  Actually, I guess I always just studied what I was<br/>
&gt; interested in, as I had major problems with authority from day one of grade<br/>
&gt; K, and just refused to participate in things I did not enjoy or that made<br/>
&gt; me uncomfortable (like Gym).  It made for records peppered with either A&#39;s<br/>
&gt; or F&#39;s and not much in between.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am the best reference for Unschooling that I know in person, as I got<br/>
&gt; very little from school at all.  Any socialization that happened there are<br/>
&gt; traumatic memories for me, and all my friends came from my volunteer work<br/>
&gt; at the zoo, or my neighborhood.  I am now a SAHM of two boys, working as a<br/>
&gt; business consultant for a retail store, doing everything from design and<br/>
&gt; decor to advertising and product expansion.  My friends tease me about my<br/>
&gt; expansive conversation vocabulary (&quot;lots of big words&quot;) which I got<br/>
&gt; exclusively from independent reading, writing and conversation.  We<br/>

I took the GED over 20 years ago while in the Army.  I would not be much help with current information.  It did not seem difficult to me and I did not study prior to taking it  Naturally I would not recommend that today.<br/>

When I took my GED I had to know about things like Reagonomics. I think your <br/>
best bet is to go to the library and get the prep book. When I started <br/>
college, they obtained my scores, so they did know exactly how I scored on <br/>
the tests. There are five, English, Math, Science, Social Studies, and one <br/>
other. I can&#39;t remember, but I know that I am going to start teaching my dh <br/>
so that he can either get his GED or be the first graduate of our home <br/>
school. You can also call an adult education office and ask them what the <br/>
required tests are. Yes, no company that you apply for cares about the score, <br/>
just that you have one, but for furthering your education, it is imperative <br/>
that you have decent scores. It falls under placement.... I hope this helps. <br/>

just what they were.  They did Independent Study and had a lot of teen<br/>
parents and full time members of the workforce in their student body.  I<br/>
met once a week with my &quot;instructor&quot; who went over last week&#39;s assignments,<br/>
assigned next week&#39;s, talked with me about any problems I may have been<br/>
having and either helped me herself or set up tutoring appointments with<br/>
someone else.  Tests were taken in the school, in my instructor&#39;s office or<br/>
at a study desk.  There were no classrooms, and you only saw other students<br/>
if they happend to be in the building at the same time as you were meeting<br/>
with your instructor.<br/>
