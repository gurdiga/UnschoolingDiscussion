They had the right to have more children.  They had the right for her to be <br/>

have their right to have more children taken away because they need help.  <br/>
They need to get help and then be a healthy person again to live life to the <br/>

doctors and hospitals and insurance companies who did not help her.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about women&#39;s prisons, but I have heard that in men&#39;s prisons <br/>
some men are in special danger from the other prisoners, especially if <br/>
they&#39;ve abused children.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  And the woman who ran her car into the water a few years back--I think <br/>
others at the prison were especially mean to her at first?<br/>

So maybe it&#39;s for her own defense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548257880">She did NOT want more children.  They were advised not to have more<br/>
children.  He didn&#39;t care because his church told him to go have more<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to drink and drive and kill someone, don&#39;t try to blame it on<br/>
the state who didn&#39;t stop you or the alcohol distributor who sold you the<br/>
booze.<br/>
<br/>
They made a choice and yes somethings failed them but the ultimate<br/>
responsibility lies with the person who made a conscious choice to go<br/>
against medical advise.  That would be the father.<br/>
<br/>
And she had to take some of those medications while pregnant and that also<br/>
endangered the future child.<br/>
<br/>
This case is no different than a couple with HIV playing Russian roulette<br/>
with the lives of possible children by deciding to have children.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, all the children died because of a religious zealot!<br/>
