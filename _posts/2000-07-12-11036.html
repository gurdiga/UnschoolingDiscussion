<div id="ygrps-yiv-810231382">Hi - We&#39;re the Flinns, Ron and Susan, from Nebraska.  We&#39;ve been <br/>
homeschooling for quite a while - first since he was nine with our <br/>
(now 25) multihandicapped son and later (really since his birth) with <br/>
our now 11 year old son, Ryan.  We split duties somewhat evenly <br/>
between us, with Ron handling physical education, computer skills, <br/>
math, and science and Susan managing social studies, languages, <br/>
literature, fine arts and geography.  We all love history and <br/>
economics and it seems to overlap every other subject.  Ron&#39;s a <br/>
fairly traditional teacher, with lesson plans, assignments and <br/>
homework.  Susan has always been an unschooler at heart and delights <br/>
in &quot;seizing the teachable moment&quot; - preferably while the family is <br/>
traveling somewhere. This nice division of ultimate responsibilities <br/>
doesn&#39;t always balance evenly, but comes out pretty well in the end, <br/>
mostly because we have very flexible work schedules.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this isn&#39;t too much info. for this intro.  Susan&#39;s been browsing <br/>
this board for about a week and you folks are a riot!  Looking <br/>
forward to getting better acquainted.<br/>
