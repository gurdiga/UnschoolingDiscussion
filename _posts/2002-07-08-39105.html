First Stacy:     <br/>
No, you don&#39;t correct spelling for your child, any more than we would<br/>
correct yours. Writing is what&#39;s important. If you correct her spelling, you<br/>
risk spoiling it for her, and turning yourself into a &quot;teacher&quot;...heaven<br/>
forbid. She&#39;ll learn spelling in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
On TEACHING MYSELF:<br/>
<br/>
When we say, &quot;He&#39;s teaching,&quot; we imply that the person already knows<br/>
something. When we say, &quot;He&#39;s teaching himself,&quot; we describe a situation in<br/>
which the person already knows something, but is also learning it (again?)<br/>
from himself. We create a conundrum -- a riddle inside an enigma. &quot;Is he<br/>
learning from himself?&quot; and &quot;Will he give himself a test?&quot;  etc., etc...<br/>
<br/>
John Holt, in his usual desdain for school teaching, wrote something like,<br/>
&quot;Just because someone is &quot;teaching&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anyone else is learning.&quot;<br/>
Could that apply to teaching one&#39;s self?  What fun !<br/>
<br/>
For Josie:    <br/>
Yours is a common problem. You are seeing the results of being in public<br/>
school...it takes time to overcome the damage done. From your post, it&#39;s<br/>
hard to tell how long you&#39;ve been with this list, but if you stick around,<br/>
I&#39;m sure you will find reasons to continue to trust your kids to be<br/>
learning. The key just might be to increase their freedom instead of<br/>
thinking of ways to regiment them into familiar (but dumb) ways of<br/>
&quot;learning&quot; such as doing schoolwork.<br/>
<br/>
If one of them wants a curriculum, make him/her BEG for it. Luz adds, &quot;and<br/>
make &#39;em pay for it, too.&quot; (long ago, I sent for one for a ten year old. On<br/>
the second day, the kid looked up and said, &quot;Dad, this is stupid.&quot; I<br/>
replied, &quot;Right. Let&#39;s send it back.&quot; We did. He went out to play --<br/>
permanently. Today, he&#39;s a thirty-two year old who makes sound tracks for TV<br/>
commercials. <br/>
<br/>
You need new ideas. With the money and time you are considering spending on<br/>
a curriculum, why not buy magazine subscriptions or go to museums or<br/>
factories or the newspaper office (talk to reporters and editors) or city<br/>
hall (see how it works/doesn&#39;t) or all learn to sail or ride horses (like<br/>
royalty all do -- it&#39;s great survival training). If all else fails, browse<br/>
the yellow pages to see what people in the real world are doing.<br/>
<br/>
As the cartoon character Pogo once said, &quot;We are confronted with<br/>
insurmountable opportunity.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To Melissa: <br/>
You end with this: &gt;&gt; I cannot imagine bringing myself to<br/>
take him there ever again.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s your bottom line...your conclusion.  It&#39;s risky for anyone to advise<br/>
you about raising your child, but that usually doesn&#39;t stop me...<br/>
You are the one who&#39;s in charge since your dh is at MIT learning, of all<br/>
things, that there is a science to politics. Well, there is a science to<br/>
being a mother, too, and it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with sending the<br/>
kids to schools for babysitting and being told to sit down and be quiet and<br/>
cut this and paste that. I also don&#39;t believe that the goal in life is to be<br/>
a  &quot;well informed voter&quot; especially when most schools prepare children<br/>
mostly for Socialism, not independence. It gets me crazy just thinking about<br/>
it when your child needs to be climbing trees and playing with one or two<br/>
friends.  Keep in touch.<br/>

To Joyce: <br/>
Great stuff!<br/>
<br/>
To Liza:<br/>
Thanks, and about READING SIGNS, when my youngest son was very small and I<br/>
carried him around town on my shoulders, talking to him, he learned to read<br/>
the signs -- all kinds -- from my reading them and, of course, saying them<br/>
to him. The first I remember was STOP  and GO on the light signals at<br/>
crossings. Then BANK and MARKET and, and...  We went into stores and talked<br/>
to many people. I know it was why he became so verbal at a young age. He now<br/>
speaks four languages and is off in Europe (as a graduation from college<br/>
present) practicing them every day.<br/>
<br/>
To all: <br/>
One more crack: Stay away from anything that calls itself &quot;progressive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
