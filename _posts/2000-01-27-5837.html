<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128678590">Can&#39;t answer for any other state or even part of a state but up here we&#39;ve<br/>
been asked &quot;is it a school holiday&quot; or things like that and youngest kidlet<br/>
(she&#39;s 7) always tells them she is homeschooled.  To which she usually gets<br/>
a &quot;oh, that&#39;s nice&quot; and I get a &quot;I wish I could.&quot;  The few that have had<br/>
questions like the usual socialization/friends are easily answered with<br/>
lighthearted comments like &quot;if we had anymore kids at the house we&#39;d have<br/>
to add on a room and get a third phone line.&quot;  I don&#39;t think we had more<br/>
than 2 or 3 that were obnoxious and one was put in her place by the kidlet<br/>
and the other two were given &quot;the&quot; look &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we have a multitude of options (ISP, charter, community,<br/>
continuation, OJT, apprenticeships, etc.) here and we also have 45/15/s<br/>
(year-round schools as some call them), so folks are kinda use to seeing<br/>
kids out and about.<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
I recently spoke to a hs mom in charge of coordinating hs groups up here<br/>
she said the local groups or families in NH don&#39;t like to be open when out<br/>
and about with their kids esp. during school hours and also that they don&#39;t<br/>
generally like to take them shopping during those times etc.because they<br/>
want to avoid harassment. That put a damper on things for me and saddened<br/>
me till I spoke to a close friend in OH who unschools and doesn&#39;t worry<br/>
about a thing and even had a neighbor try and report her for it (of course<br/>
they couldn&#39;t do anything but still that really is a bummer!)<br/>
I am not the type to hide indoors during school hours and lately my son<br/>
hasn&#39;t been going even though I haven&#39;t taken him out officially yet. I<br/>
don&#39;t plan on worrying about others reactions but found it curious that she<br/>
wanted to share this with me and protect me by letting me know this as a<br/>
newbie to kind of lay low or at least not wear a T-shirt that says &quot;I<br/>
homeschool and I&#39;m proud&quot;. Any thoughts or experiences from anyone here on<br/>
this topic I&#39;d like to hear from you. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710620985">Beth, <br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t really given much thought to the fact that there may be people staying home during school hours, because people give them a hard time - how awful!<br/>
<br/>
We are fairly new homeschoolers, but we go wherever, whenever.  I have almost hoped people in the grocery store would ask my kids why they weren&#39;t in school, so I could tell them.<br/>
<br/>
I did wonder what my neighbors would think, but no one has said anything so far.<br/>
<br/>
We are also lucky because we live in Florida.  There are always so many people who have taken their kids out of school for a week to vacaction, that nobody questions kids running around on school days.<br/>
<br/>
But, the sad fact is that most people don&#39;t understand homeschooling, or that others feel strongly enough to do it.  I remember a family who lived near my MIL in Michigan.  She said that one of the kids had been kicked out of school, so they had taken all their kids out and were homeschooling them.  MIL said that they weren&#39;t even doing homeschool, because she saw the kids outside playing almost all day.  At the time, I agreed with her.  Now that I understand school and learning, it&#39;s my kids who are playing outside all day!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Right before I started homeschooling I was in Hallmark and there was a lady there with several middle school aged kids and there was &quot;just something about them&quot;.  They seemed very self confident and happy and it really made me wonder.  When I saw her pulling out of the parking lot, she had a bumper sticker that said &quot;When it comes to school, there&#39;s no place like home&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Imagine That!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845238327">We&#39;re in CA, way out in the boonies or up in the boonies, I guess one would<br/>
say &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t know how the rest of the state is but never had any<br/>
problems back in the dark ages either when we were living about an hour<br/>
from SF when I hs&#39;d my neices and nephews in the late 60&#39;s, early 70&#39;s. <br/>
Don&#39;t ask, I&#39;m old as dirt &lt;g&gt; but was actually young then and sil was ill<br/>
and we ended up with 5 kids!  Being a mere child myself at the time, I<br/>
&quot;accidentally&quot; ended up unschooling them because all the paperwork was<br/>
enough to choke an organized person, let alone a professional &quot;file by<br/>
piles&quot; kinda person &lt;g&gt;  No one bothered us and when they went back to<br/>
their mom, they were tested and placed back in ps according to their<br/>
scores.  No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, we&#39;ve had the local school district refer kids to &quot;real&quot;<br/>
homeschooling and to the local charter that is as loose as they can get and<br/>
still get state approval.<br/>

I love that bumper sticker and the connection to the Wizard of Oz my favorite story of all time! I have been to your web site it is fantastic and have enjoyed reading your wonderful journal. I did sign your guest book. Please don&#39;t stop it is a masterpeice IMHO. (It is good enough to publish in a book). Last year I know I had my kids in FL visiting with my Dad during school week and not during vacation time. It was great I didn&#39;t think about us being the only ones there with school age kids. One big reason I want to hs is because of the flexibility you can go to places wherever and whenever you want to. The person who I spoke to is not a true unschooler perhaps she still has one foot right in the door of propriety?New Englanders are big on that and are responsible for IS I believe it originated in Mass. I live here but am a New Yorker flamboyant at heart! Anyway I&#39;d love to meet you all when we do go down there some time next year. When someone does ask you i&#39;d love to read about how you respond to them!<br/>
Take care,<br/>

It would be cool to meet you and your family next time you&#39;re in Florida.  We&#39;re right between Tampa and Orlando, so how can you go wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading my journal - it would be great to get it published.  I guess we&#39;ll burn that bridge when we come to it.  LOLOL.<br/>
<br/>
I promise a full report whenever that poor person happens to be the first one to question me about homeschooling.  No, really, I&#39;ll be gentle.<br/>
