<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256601339">hello all-we are so glad to be a part of this group. we&#39;re new and very<br/>
thankful to have found a place where everyone is respected,and listened<br/>
to. I&#39;m the mother of Emily 4 and Ethan 1.5. We have recently decided to<br/>
unschool. I feel terrific about this decision but my husband is still<br/>
skeptical. I am the recently retired (at 28) pre-school teacher from a<br/>
parent cooperative school. The more &quot;educated&quot; I have become the more I<br/>
feel confident about our decision. My daughter was the child who went to<br/>
Mothers day out and pre-school. As you well know we have spent the last<br/>
six months unschooling her (even though she only went for a short period<br/>
of time) and rebuilding our relationship. As a revelation to me and my<br/>
husband, we had a lot of issues to resolve and lots of bonding to do. My<br/>
daughter and I had to re-establish our relationship completely . It&#39;s<br/>
been hard but its been beautiful. We have finally reached a point where<br/>
we are all comfortable and working together. I never realized how out of<br/>
sync my family was. <br/>
<br/>
We love the library, park, museums, going for walks, visiting with<br/>
friends, having an open schedule, gardening, baking, sewing, making<br/>
things, painting, reading, music, dancing, gym time, camping, hiking,<br/>
canoeing, and we are discovering new things all the time.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is the dramatic one and my son is the &quot;strong&quot; one. Both are<br/>
very passionate and compassionate. We are having a blast although we are<br/>
trying to est. ourselves in a local group right now.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, Brad, is a youth minister so we are always into kids.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the time and hope to have more great conversations.<br/>
In the spirit<br/>
Kathy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778053271"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am just beginning to research homeschooling, and unschooling <br/>
 </span></blockquote>seems to be where my interests lie. My son is 18months old so I know <br/>
I have the time to do my research, but would like some direction. I <br/>
would like the names of a few great books about unschooling to get <br/>
started with and some tips on how to deal with all the negatives I <br/>
know I will encounter from family/friends who do not understand. If <br/>
we ultimately decide to unschool, it will not waiver me to have to <br/>
explain it, but a few pointers are always helpful. <br/>
Thanks a lot, Scout&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so happy to see someone researching Un-schooling earlier than <br/>
me!  LOL!  I&#39;ve been looking into h/schooling and un/schooling since <br/>
mine was 2.5 -- now I don&#39;t feel so weird.  ;o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884396886">I&#39;ve been hanging out at unschooling.com, here and similar places since my<br/>
son was under a year. We started attending homeschool group locally when he<br/>
was under 2! Make yourself at home!<br/>
