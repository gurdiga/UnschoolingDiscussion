&lt;&lt; I know that I cant, one of those life rewinders would be kinda nice right <br/>
now, though :). I like that, grammy the life lesson &lt;g&gt;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of Trevors big wishes is to have a life rewinder. He says he&#39;d watch <br/>
something spill, then rewind and watch it over and over.<br/>
And he&#39;d test out people interactions. What would happen if he said something <br/>
really, really rude, then rewind and do it diffferent.<br/>
What a great tool for learning how to do things better!! :) I&#39;d like one too.<br/>
<br/>
About those pesky Grandmas, it can be rough.<br/>
I have no problem with family disagreeing with me or showing other points of <br/>
view.<br/>
But my Grandma has the same disease yours does, overcontrollitis.<br/>
She snuck behind my back to tell Trevor that he needs to teach Jared to read <br/>
and she&#39;d pay him to do so. ACK!<br/>
This, after my Dad told her to mind her own business and that the best way to <br/>
piss off his dd was to meddle with the kids.<br/>
She doesn&#39;t learn very quickly, but the kids are pretty good at dealing with <br/>
her.<br/>
They just smile and make vague sounds and change the subject. Works like a <br/>
charm.<br/>
<br/>
With the younger ones, I&#39;d be like a Mama bear. Leave them the hell alone or <br/>
ELSE!!<br/>
She knows not to push it too far with me now, I&#39;ve had it up to my eyeballs <br/>
with it. So has my sis. It is really, really freaking her out that we are <br/>
still homeschooling...guess she thought we&#39;d give it up by now! <br/>
Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Just shrug it off, but make it very clear that if your kids are going to <br/>
spend time with your family, it is NOT to happen again.<br/>
She has the choice between honoring the mother/child relationship or not <br/>
spending time with the children, that&#39;s how I see it. But I&#39;m rather <br/>
intolerant and thick skinned these days....<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

I agree with it intellectually.  It&#39;s sensible and calm.  But I have a <br/>
comment below.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think you can start by talking to your kids about your <br/>
mom, and explain that she has very strong beliefs in Jesus, and that&#39;s why it <br/>
was so important to her to share them with him. Tell them that you and your <br/>
husband have different beliefs from her, and even from one another, and that <br/>
people all over the world have even more beliefs.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-You&#39;ll just have to keep stressing that these are her BELIEFS, not <br/>
facts, and that he&#39;ll develop his own beliefs.-=-<br/>
<br/>
To fundamentalist Christians that will sound like &quot;blah blah blah Satan blah <br/>
blah blah damnation blah blah blah just needs to know about Jesus.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When someone is focussed on Jesus as the Savior and Son of God who&#39;s coming <br/>
soon to sort people out for eternity, NOTHING about any other beliefs or <br/>
religions means anything at all except death and pain and stupidity.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t compromise with them.  You can&#39;t ask them to be happy keeping their <br/>
beleifs to themselves.  They will hear that as &quot;Back off, we don&#39;t care if he <br/>
goes to hell.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I meant that she should stress that to her kids. Clearly there&#39;s no <br/>
talking to mom, if she&#39;d sabotage realtionships by telling her grandchildren <br/>
that their mother would lie to them about religion.<br/>
