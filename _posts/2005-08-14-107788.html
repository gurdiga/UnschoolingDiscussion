We just went through a situation that was split with religious families in  a <br/>
way.. We also had families who are working towards unschooling but not quite  <br/>
there and refused to openly say unschool. <br/>
Some people can tolerate and ignore... I, nor my son could stomach the  <br/>
endless rules and what some call family values but was really more rules so they  <br/>
could puppet their kids.<br/>
Save your self the future stress and start your own group.<br/>
Invite friends/post to the groups with an invite for teen situations (that  <br/>
way it&#39;s not ruled by the parents who limit or don&#39;t allow their teens to <br/>
breath  without permission)....<br/>
I suspect you can find activities he likes without them.<br/>

&lt;&lt;He is a very atheletic, techknowlegagble and a  competitive chess <br/>
player.  He is very mature for his age (and tall)  so everyone thinks <br/>
he&#39;s much older than he is.  I think I just need  to hear from someone, <br/>
anyone, that I&#39;m doing the right thing not putting  him in the hs teen <br/>
night, etc. in the area.  He does do activities  with ps kids.<br/>

And all the kids might have in common is that they&#39;re homeschooled.    <br/>
<br/>
At school, all the kids have in common is that they go to the same school.   <br/>
Why duplicate that if there are other options?<br/>
