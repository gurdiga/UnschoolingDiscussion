<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066906202">A book that my wife and I recently enjoyed is called &quot;The Five Love <br/>
Languages&quot; by (Dr.) Gary Chapman.  During his counseling career, he <br/>
found that saying loving words or performing certain activities made <br/>
the recipient of those (for example, a spouse) feel loved.  He termed <br/>
it filling their love tank.  He went on to describe five categories <br/>
of words or actions, the five love languages.<br/>
<br/>
He found that each person&#39;s love tank is filled more quickly by a <br/>
certain language.  A person tends to use that love language when <br/>
communicating to another, but that other person may have a completely <br/>
different love language.  Chapman recommends finding out the other&#39;s <br/>
love language and using it to communicate with them.  <br/>
<br/>
He mentions that this works well for communicating love to children <br/>
also, although children under 5 or 6 seem have their love tanks <br/>
filled quickly in any language.<br/>
