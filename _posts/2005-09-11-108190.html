<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153705622">Hi everyone!<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind me asking this question since it is about an older <br/>
teen.......but I could really use some advice.<br/>
<br/>
My stepson is 18, and has just come 3 months ago from France, to live with us.<br/>
He was unhappily schooled his whole life, bounced from private school to <br/>
private school.......and finally public when no more would take him.<br/>
<br/>
He is a highly intelligent, deep and sweet boy who has had a lot of heartache <br/>
in his life.<br/>
My husband works a real lot so he&#39;s home with me and my 15 month old daughter.<br/>
He is very sensitive and I think he resents my dd a little. He said before he <br/>
came here that she&#39;s not his sister.<br/>
He definitely likes us though.<br/>
<br/>
He spends almost all his waking hours on the computer or on the X-box.<br/>
He stays up all night and sleeps most of the day and doesn&#39;t get any sunlight <br/>
really.<br/>
When I ask him to come with us some place he declines (when my husband is <br/>
home he does go out with him to play tennis and such).<br/>
<br/>
We live with my parents temporarily (we just bought a business and are <br/>
staying w/ them for a bit) and they are not OK with his lifestyle (my mom mostly).<br/>
His room is overflowing garbage (until I pick it up) and he doesn&#39;t pitch in <br/>
when they are doing work. He locks the housekeeper out of his room.....lol.<br/>
He also doesn&#39;t work and didn&#39;t work for about 6 months before he left France.<br/>
He eats boxes of cookies and drinks liters of soda daily.......often there is <br/>
nothing left for the rest of them.<br/>
Monopolizes their computer.<br/>
Just lots of bad habits for a &quot;guest&quot; to have (their opinion).<br/>
<br/>
I am fine with him keeping his room how he wants but it&#39;s not my home and he <br/>
has a room on the main level where people are constantly entering.<br/>
<br/>
I admit I was a bit shocked when I saw that he had absolutely no desire to go <br/>
out and explore his new surroundings.......the town, etc.<br/>
I was thinking &quot;maybe he&#39;s de-schooling&quot; but it&#39;s been 3 months and it&#39;s <br/>
still this way.<br/>
I worry about his health and mind living this lifestyle (no sunlight, <br/>
smoking, minimal exercise etc.).<br/>
I&#39;ve done it too when I was his age and I was a very unhealthy girl.<br/>
<br/>
I keep the house stocked with natural, whole foods and that&#39;s what I cook.<br/>
He eats that too so that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
I give him lots of space but lots of caring too.<br/>
I invite him to go places, never tell him he has to go.<br/>
I try to find ways (without being too obvious) for us to connect as a family <br/>
when dh isn&#39;t home and when he is.<br/>
<br/>
I know he will not be like this forever as he is 18 and is bound to want some <br/>
kind of social interaction. He was very social in Nice, where he lived.....a <br/>
club kid. <br/>
I just am at a loss as to how to engage him in our daily life and connect.<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to help him connect with others and how to facilitate <br/>
pleasurable life experiences for him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this so please, any advice is welcome.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973573636">** He spends almost all his waking hours on the computer or on the X-box.**<br/>
<br/>
Is this something he does because he doesn&#39;t have any friends locally?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Just lots of bad habits for a &quot;guest&quot; to have (their opinion).**<br/>
<br/>
If they think of him as a &quot;guest&quot; and not as &quot;family&quot; then it sounds <br/>
like they don&#39;t think of him as if he&#39;s really their grandson.  Thus <br/>
it&#39;s not surprising he doesn&#39;t think their grandaughter is his sister, <br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** I worry about his health and mind living this lifestyle (no sunlight,<br/>
smoking, minimal exercise etc.).  I&#39;ve done it too when I was his age <br/>
and I was a very unhealthy girl.**<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember people (like your parents) pushing you to change and how <br/>
you felt about it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** I keep the house stocked with natural, whole foods and that&#39;s what I <br/>
cook.  He eats that too so that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
I give him lots of space but lots of caring too.<br/>
I invite him to go places, never tell him he has to go.<br/>
I try to find ways (without being too obvious) for us to connect as a <br/>
family when dh isn&#39;t home and when he is.**<br/>
<br/>
This all sounds good.  I believe you are taking the right approach, even <br/>
if you don&#39;t see results yet.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s tough when your home is not fully your home, as is your situation <br/>
right now.  My mother went through a similar thing with my brother (in <br/>
his 40s) recently when he was unemployed.  He could come and stay in her <br/>
guestroom, for a short time.  But the house she lives in is owned by her <br/>
boyfriend who eventually lost patience and made him move out.  I do <br/>
think it&#39;s best if your parents talk to your husband about his son&#39;s <br/>
behavior, leaving you out of the &quot;chain of command&quot; as much as <br/>
possible.  This is pretty common advice for stepfamilies.  Your husband <br/>
may not want to deal with complaints, but his relationship with his son <br/>
is much stronger than yours.<br/>
<br/>
Does this young man drive?  Did he want to come to the U.S., or is there <br/>
some conflict with his mother driving him from the home he was raised <br/>
in? Was this originally a visit, or is he planning to stay in the U.S. <br/>
permanently?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m ready to say that the only thing I think is likely to help is for <br/>
your husband to increase the amount of time he spends with his adult <br/>
son, even if he has to cut back on his work hours to do so.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Strewing&quot; a few interesting things may help a bit.  Maybe even French <br/>
magazines and videos if he is feeling homesick.  Since the young man <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem very active, watching videos is a low-energy activity that <br/>
I thought he might be willing to do, but he&#39;s unlikely to want to watch <br/>
your daughter&#39;s Disney videos.  You may not want really violent movies <br/>
on when your daughter is awake, but maybe she wouldn&#39;t notice much if he <br/>
was watching sexy movies (tasteful ones, rated R, I mean).  Another <br/>
possible type of movie that came to mind is the Ethan Hawke and Julia <br/>
Delpy movies Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.  These are about a young <br/>
American man and a young French woman talking on a train.  (v. little <br/>
sex in them).  He might think Julia is cute, and you might find stuff to <br/>
talk about about differences between French and American culture. <br/>
<br/>
Other stuff you strew could be information about the local club scene, <br/>
or other things related to his interests.  (I don&#39;t know what they are.) <br/>
You probably have to be subtle, because it sounds like he may be highly <br/>
resistant to feeling like he is being led or controlled by grown-ups.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** I know he will not be like this forever as he is 18 and is bound to <br/>
want some kind of social interaction.**<br/>
<br/>
The desire to impress women has gotten many a young man cleaned up and <br/>
off the couch. &lt;g&gt;  So, I think you are right in what you say above.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242715442">Although I&#39;ve expressed some opinions, I don&#39;t see that this is an <br/>
unschooling issue.   He&#39;s a grown schoolkid; your daughter is a toddler.   Most of what <br/>
this list knows about isn&#39;t applicable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems quite a stretch to have a stepson stay with your parents.   It must <br/>
have seemed crowded and tense enough.    <br/>
<br/>
But bottom line, if it&#39;s your parents&#39; house, they should be able to call the <br/>
shots about how rooms are kept and how people behave.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My husband works a real lot so he&#39;s home with me and my 15 month old <br/>
daughter.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do your parents work during the day?<br/>
<br/>
-=-When I ask him to come with us some place he declines (when my husband is<br/>
home he does go out with him to play tennis and such).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you asking him just at the last minute, or are you planning things a few <br/>
days in advance specifically intended to be of interest to him (yet something <br/>
your daughter would like too)?   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe because of the crowdedness situation, you should be planning many more <br/>
days out, and take him with you.   Plan for it, maybe two touristing days a <br/>
week.   It would be good all sorts of ways.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We live with my parents temporarily (we just bought a business and are<br/>
staying w/ them for a bit) and they are not OK with his lifestyle (my mom <br/>
mostly).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did they know when they agreed to let you live there that he would be part of <br/>
the deal?<br/>
<br/>
-=-He eats boxes of cookies and drinks liters of soda daily.......often there <br/>
is<br/>
nothing left for the rest of them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not buying that food, ask him not to eat so much of your mom&#39;s <br/>
food.   Boundaries seem to be being forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Monopolizes their computer.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have a computer?   Can you get one and let him use yours?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just lots of bad habits for a &quot;guest&quot; to have (their opinion).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is he not a guest?   <br/>
<br/>
If my daughter grew up and<br/>
married a guy<br/>
who had a grown son<br/>
and if my daughter needed to stay at my house, I wouldn&#39;t mind HER, and her <br/>
child, of course.   Her husband, part of the deal; HIS SON?   Absolutely a <br/>
guest.   Not my relatives.   Her relative by marriage.   He needs to be very, very <br/>
nice.<br/>
