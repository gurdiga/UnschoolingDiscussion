Is the Home School Network still going in Cinti?  When we lived there a few<br/>
years ago they had a great group with a monthly newsletter.  You could set<br/>
up a gaming day at your house or a library meeting room, announce it, and<br/>
see who shows up.  I know there is a newer group in cinti (newer as in since<br/>
5 years ago when I moved) called C.A.T.C.H. that you could look into also.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what that stands for but I think it might be Cincinnati Area<br/>
Teaching Children at Home??  Sorry if I got that wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819460842">My littlw brother games as well as a lot of my friends. They all go to places like Game Towne, Wizards of the Coast,  Game Empire, places like that. These places are all stores that sell the games, cards and books and all have a room in the back for playing. Ask at your local gaming store, if they don&#39;t do it there I&#39;m sure that could tell you where to go.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sandra has mentioned several times that her kids have friends <br/>
who are &quot;gamers.&quot; We are in a subculture that doesn&#39;t <br/>
encourage that stuff but my kids love Harry Potter, Yu-Gi-Oh <br/>
cards, RPGs on the computer and more. Any suggestions of <br/>
how to meet kids (teens) who are into this stuff? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gamine shops.  Card shops.  Find out where they sell Magic cards and <br/>
miniatures, and ask them about gaming schedules.  There might be free play <br/>
sessions, or there might be tournaments.  <br/>
<br/>
Probably the kids they meet there will also be doing online stuff as well.<br/>
<br/>
There is probably a bulletin board in the shop too, where they might put a <br/>
note, or find a note looking for players.<br/>
<br/>
There is a homeschooling session here once a week which is noon on, at a <br/>
little gaming shop near my house.  It&#39;s not the one where Kirby works, and <br/>
I&#39;m not involved, but Holly goes and Kirby often goes with her.  They have <br/>
two other sessions for the general public during the week too, Harry Potter <br/>
tournaments.<br/>
<br/>
During the homeschooling session, though, the owner of the store has <br/>
instituted a STUPID add-on---it&#39;s they buy a comic for $2 (which is a <br/>
discount, but he chooses the lot from which they can pick) and they read it <br/>
and then give a report.  EEEYEW!  Holly just stalls to try to go after that&#39;s <br/>
done.  Both she and Kirby laugh about how awful it is that he wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
that could make kids not like comics.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Ask at your local gaming store, if they don&#39;t do it there I&#39;m sure that <br/>
could tell you where to go. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some stores are really jealous about where people will buy their booster <br/>
packs and might be reluctant to name competitors.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you do start gaming at a shop, it&#39;s most ethical to buy your <br/>
supplies there rather than at WalMart or Hastings, even if it&#39;s cheaper at <br/>
the other places.  If you buy an on-sale starter deck at ToysR&#39;Us, that&#39;s <br/>
fine, but if you NEVER buy at the store where you play, you become a burden <br/>
and you haven&#39;t helped them pay for the tables and chairs, people to clean <br/>
up, the bathroom, the electricity, etc.    (A gaming etiquette note. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
