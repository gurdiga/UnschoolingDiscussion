<br/>
There are a lot of great discussions of unschooling here, just delete the <br/>
posts with this stuff in them.  I&#39;m a christian and love it here, I know I <br/>
can post a question and get the best advice around from some experienced and <br/>
thoughtful unschoolers.  Every list will stray into side issues, I just <br/>
delete most of it and hang in there for the good stuff.<br/>

Marty has a funny routine that&#39;s been going around the gaming shop where he <br/>
