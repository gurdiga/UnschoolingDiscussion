my opinion if that is what the child or young person wants.<br/>
If your son wants to learn algebra, then workbooks can help.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, unschooling is &#39;child-led&#39; and sometimes children <br/>
lead us to textbooks.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Learning algebra&quot; in school is learning how to maniplulate already-set-up <br/>
&quot;equations&quot; and to do the computations to complete what someone else already <br/>
started.   <br/>
<br/>
My kids &quot;do algebra&quot; in their heads.  They wouldn&#39;t know what it looked like <br/>
on paper.  Many people who did well in math, made A&#39;s in finishing problems, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t know what it was really good for, because that question wasn&#39;t on <br/>
the test.<br/>
<br/>
When someone who understands algebra is shown the notation for doing more <br/>
difficult forms, they might actually have a chance to understand it, instead <br/>
of just following directions to get the solution.<br/>
<br/>
I know I just used this analogy the other day, but algebra is taught in the <br/>
same way it would be to teach musical notation to someone who neither sang <br/>
nor made music, nor had really heard music.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-249606730">The following was written last November and was originally private mail <br/>
between my husband and someone on this list.<br/>
============================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Math is a highly structured abstract modeling tool and requires a strong<br/>
<br/>
sense of discipline, but ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A true math student must possess a strong passion for discovery in a realm<br/>
<br/>
which has little direct connection to the world of our five senses.  My<br/>
<br/>
experience says that the passion will grow in children if they are shown the<br/>
<br/>
myriad of modeling applications in their everyday world (physics, chemistry,<br/>
<br/>
finance, sports, arts, etc).  All growth takes time and gentle nurturing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about educating the parents as much as educating the<br/>
<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keith Dodd<br/>
<br/>
(husband to Sandra)<br/>
<br/>
------the other parent:=======<br/>
<br/>
Keith, I really appreciate you writing this. Sandra wrote me a few weeks<br/>
<br/>
ago, telling me something you&#39;d said about math that really helped her, and<br/>
<br/>
it helped me too, at least as far as beginning to tell the difference<br/>
<br/>
between real math and computation. But I&#39;m sort of stuck here. I really<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t know how to show my son these applications. You&#39;re surely right that<br/>
<br/>
the parents need educating as much as anyone. Not just my husband and his<br/>
<br/>
wishes for structured math, but me and how do I show math around us and how<br/>
<br/>
it applies? I would love for there to be that passion for discovery that you<br/>
<br/>
write about. Much education needed here....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==========Keith:========<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the ages of your children (or yourself or your husband :) but<br/>
<br/>
it doesn&#39;t really matter.  Think of your everyday actions, then look at how<br/>
<br/>
they can be represented with math.  Scaling of cooking ingredients (ratios),<br/>
<br/>
boiling water (physics or chemistry), bouncing a ball (physics), watching<br/>
<br/>
the moon circle the earth (geometry), (as in why does a ball fall to earth<br/>
<br/>
but the moon does not?).  Find art with a protractor, compass, straight<br/>
<br/>
edge, (like the Greeks) or just play with graph paper (geometry & trig).<br/>
<br/>
Look for symetry in nature or man made artifacts (ratios again).  Look for<br/>
<br/>
applications of fractions (ratios, division, combinatorics).  Talk about the<br/>
<br/>
lottery or statistics in elections or sports.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Algebra and calculus are abstractions to be delved into once you see the<br/>
<br/>
need for modeling in the first place.  Interest in &quot;the need&quot; I find to be<br/>
<br/>
hinged on a budding interest in some tangible format.  Do they like<br/>
<br/>
architecture or engineering (mud pies to model planes)?  How about<br/>
<br/>
competitive puzzles (board games, cards, video games)?  My son (12) just<br/>
<br/>
finished reassembling a TV. (The picture was cutting out.)  He now knows<br/>
<br/>
that the insides are not some kind of magic.  We talked a little about<br/>
<br/>
circuits and assembly and troubleshooting.  In the process of finding the<br/>
<br/>
broken circuit, we talked about TV signals and waveforms and how both audio<br/>
<br/>
and video came from the same antenna.  I didn&#39;t try to go into the math of<br/>
<br/>
electronics (really complicated modeling), but he now is a little more<br/>
<br/>
interested in just how that stuff works.  It took him 3 days of putzing<br/>
<br/>
around with it, (and a $20 part) and mostly all I did was encourage him to<br/>
<br/>
be careful and take small steps.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think the greatest thing I have learned from homeschooling, it the fact<br/>
<br/>
that it is ok to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s find out.&quot;  The other side of<br/>
<br/>
that is being able to judge when the child is bored with the subject and you<br/>
<br/>
can let it slide.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
=====from the other parent=====<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[Child in question] is almost 11, and can manage basic arithmetic computation <br/>
(all those<br/>
<br/>
enforced math lessons). Lately he seems to be enjoying fractions, and in the<br/>
<br/>
way you&#39;re speaking of. He thinks in fractions a lot of the time: I&#39;ve<br/>
<br/>
finished making one fifth of my bed, I&#39;ve read 3/12 of this book&#39;s chapters<br/>
<br/>
or 1/ 4 of them. That kind of thing. He seems to be enjoying that and it&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
not something I coached him in, he just started figuring them out. So doing<br/>
<br/>
ratios like you mentioned, with cooking, would be a natural to him. I bet<br/>
<br/>
he&#39;d enjoy that. And symetry too. He loved that Donald Duck in Mathemagic<br/>
<br/>
Land video, with its golden rectangles. He thought that was really cool how<br/>
<br/>
the same proportions came up over and over. And lotteries we talked about<br/>
<br/>
the other day. We went over how they worked and did do some math during the<br/>
<br/>
discussion. All the rest of your ideas are things I hadn&#39;t touched on, ever,<br/>
<br/>
so  that gives me a lot of ideas. What are combinatorics????<br/>
<br/>
=============Keith again=========<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Combinatorics:<br/>
<br/>
Consider a lottery drawing of 3 balls from 3 separate pots of 10 balls each.<br/>
<br/>
The odds of picking a specific combination of numbers is:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1/10 * 1/10 * 1/10 = 1/1000 or one in one thousand combinations.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now consider drawing the 3 balls from a single pot.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1/10 * 1/9 * 1/8 = 1/720 or one in seven hundred twenty combinations.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Combinatorics is the study of ratios.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Computer Programming:<br/>
<br/>
This is more like logic than math, but the same principals apply.  My<br/>
<br/>
recommendation would be to buy your son a simple programming environment<br/>
<br/>
(like Visual Basic or even better Microsoft Access) and a couple beginner<br/>
<br/>
books on programming.  Even so, it will require a rigorous effort because of<br/>
<br/>
how &#39;dry&#39; the materiel really is.  The artistry of programming is in<br/>
<br/>
conceptualizing just what it is you want to accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed this<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That depends. Is he also asking for a different way than a course or would a course meet his needs right now?<br/>
<br/>
You might want to check into Harold Jacob&#39;s text called simply &quot;Algebra&quot; I think (he also wrote Mathematics:a human endeavor). These were texts originally written for college students which I discovered through John Holt&#39;s recommendation many years ago in the GWS catalogues. Both my son and I really enjoyed them--he has a way of explaining math that relates to life and is not dry, and doesn&#39;t assume you&#39;re an idiot who needs busywork. My son was about 11-13yo at the time--we didn&#39;t do all the exercises in order, we really love math, though I&#39;m definitely not very experienced in higher math. The books are thick and expensive--might be available used (and if I can find them again, I might consider selling mine.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

Hi Rhonda and Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
If my son was interested in algebra, I would find books, games, computer<br/>
programs and anything else related to alegebra to introduce him to the<br/>
subject, as well as trying to learn about it myself as much as I could.<br/>
<br/>
If he was still interested after going through the various things we had<br/>
already looked at and I could no longer meet his needs to help him learn<br/>
algebra, I would find a class for him, or a friend or tutor to help him more<br/>
personally.<br/>
<br/>
Those are my unschooling thoughts. :-)<br/>

A madrigal group.<br/>
<br/>
And one of the best costume references I ever came upon was in a cookbook, in <br/>
an illustration of the serving of a feast, which showed backs of the servers.<br/>
<br/>
And in a book of hours, I found a picture of baby Jesus in a little walker--a <br/>
wooden frame with wheels, 16th century or 15th.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling works.  You don&#39;t go looking in an algebra book for <br/>
algebra.  You let a rich life wash over you and everything comes by over and <br/>
over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43576628">This whole thread is really hitting close to home.  I remember, long after <br/>
my college algebra and trigonometry classes were over, having an &quot;a-ha&quot; <br/>
moment when I realized *why* all those formulas really worked, with &quot;sin2 <br/>
+ cos2=1&quot; being one of those that never really made sense to me, until I <br/>
had time to sit and play with it, and figure it out.  Same for all those <br/>
other trig identities.  I memorized them, and used them when I managed to <br/>
remember them, which, unfortunately, wasn&#39;t often enough.<br/>

strange pain killer sleep, so I watched it.  Cosby had a whole thing about <br/>
his geometry teacher and said that he could add, subtract, multiply, divide <br/>
and go anything with &quot;If a man...&quot;  He LOVED &quot;if a man,&quot; (yikes, I hated word <br/>
problems) but once he got to geometry he refused to open the book and ended <br/>
up reproving all the them.  The skit was really funny - Cosby refused to <br/>
memorize because the book was too heavy and he didn&#39;t want to take it home, <br/>
which was meant for play and not homework.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is to agree with the above point and use Bill Cosby to do <br/>
it.  I was a pro at differentiating equations, by the way, but can&#39;t remember <br/>
and am sure I never knew why I was differentiating them!<br/>
