pretty clever the way it quotes your words back to you<br/>

<div><font color="#008080" size="4">it waits about five minutes, then your incoming 
mail start going into your outgoing mail instead. the attachment is added and it 
comes through the inbox as if you sent it. If you are posting to a group. it 
seems to come as a personal response to a post someone has sent. If you download 
your mail, log off and read it, the worm won&#39;t activate until you log on the net 
again. did you open any attachments? It gives an error meassage stating &quot;File 
data corrupt: probably due to a bad data transmission or bad disk access.&quot; I 
don&#39;t think it works if you don&#39;t open the attachment but I&#39;m not sure. I hope 
you are ok. I feel really bad because&nbsp;I knew I needed to get antivrus 
software and hadn&#39;t done it yet. Finances can be tight sometimes. </font></div>

As long as you didn&#39;t try to open the attachment you should be fine.  A<br/>
friend (computer tech support) told me that you can even download the<br/>
program onto your hard drive and be fine, it&#39;s only when you open it<br/>
since it is an executable file, opening it starts it up.<br/>
<br/>
You can do a search and see if you have any of the files on your hard<br/>
drive just to be safe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874971435">&lt;&lt;I tried to open a similar email from Valerie.  Hey Valerie are you out<br/>
there?   Dh had just reloloaded out computer and I don&#39;t think the anti<br/>
virus software got loaded on before he left for WA.  I want to make sure<br/>
I am not spreading anything.  What happens with the virus?  NOthing seems<br/>
to be wrong with my computer right now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll know if you have it by searching for the following files:<br/>
<br/>
kern32.exe<br/>
inetd.exe<br/>
Hkk32.exe<br/>
<br/>
If none of these files are on your computer you are probably fine.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you use Windows.  Go to &quot;Start&quot; then &quot;Find&quot; and have it look<br/>
for these files,<br/>
kern32.exe<br/>
inetd.exe<br/>
hkk32.exe  *note* this file means that the &quot;trojan horse&quot; aspect of the<br/>
virus was executed and it is the cause for real concern.  It can capture<br/>
and transmit passwords, credit card information and other security<br/>
information stored on your hard drive.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have any of these files you are probably fine.  If you<br/>
haven&#39;t opened any attachments for the past couple of weeks you are fine.<br/>
 If you have opened ANY attachment from an email with no message except a<br/>
quote from one of your own posts along with a note &quot;look to the<br/>
attachment&quot; then you have the virus.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t have to worry about viruses because, even though I have anti-<br/>
virus software on my computer, my internet service provider filters <br/>
every email before it comes to my inbox.  Perhaps you should <br/>
shop around and find an internet service provider in your area that <br/>
does this also.  Then you wouldn&#39;t have to worry so much.  My ISP <br/>
always has the latest DAT files with the newest virus information, <br/>
so I don&#39;t worry.<br/>

<div><font size="1">Johanna - Do not feel bad about the lack of anti-virus 
software.&nbsp; I have the software, yet I was affected. Everybody who uses the 
internet/e-mail knows they are open to this risk.&nbsp; Thankfully, the software 
is available online.&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to apologize (more on that later), 
although your apology is graciously accepted by all, no doubt.&nbsp; By the 
way,&nbsp; I have an extra McAfee program (got it free as an incentive for 
something else - e-mail me if you want me to mail it).&nbsp; When I had the full 
suite on my older computer, it left too much running and slowed things 
down.&nbsp; If this is a concern for you, have a self-proclaimed &quot;expert&quot; (the 
kind that do things for free) help you install it differently.&nbsp; It has more 
than just anti-virus software on it.&nbsp; Also, you&#39;ll need to update it 
often.&nbsp; The Symantec I have know updates ever 14 days with an option to do 
it sooner.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font size="1">Back to the original thought here - no one blames you anyway 
(especially me).&nbsp; Truth be known, I suspect that I got it from a very 
small, twelve woman list from a person who didn&#39;t know she had it.&nbsp; By the 
time I figured out I had it, it had sent dozens, maybe hundreds of e-mails out - 
mostly to myself!&nbsp; And I seem to have sent it to the 15,000+ Flylady list 
as well as the unschooling list.&nbsp; If anyone has a red face here it&#39;s 
me.&nbsp; So to all of you, I apologize.&nbsp; What&#39;s strange is that I got rid 
of it days ago, and am surprised it just hit this list recently - I thought it 
probably hadn&#39;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess these worms are written so cleverly 
that the pause is intentional.&nbsp; Since this was my first ever virus/worm, I 
am now well-schooled in the dangers of strangely and alluringly titled 
attachments.&nbsp; However, I never received the enticement of nude photos. I&#39;ve 
been LOL just thinking of those of&nbsp;you sitting&nbsp;out their staring at 
those attachment titles in bewilderment!!!</font></div>

  <div><font size="1">Johanna - Do not feel bad about the lack of anti-virus 
  software.&nbsp; I have the software, yet I was affected. Everybody who uses 
  the internet/e-mail knows they are open to this risk.&nbsp; Thankfully, the 
  software is available online.&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to apologize (more on that 
  later), although your apology is graciously accepted by all, no doubt.&nbsp; 
  By the way,&nbsp; I have an extra McAfee program (got it free as an incentive 
  for something else - e-mail me if you want me to mail it).&nbsp; When I had 
  the full suite on my older computer, it left too much running and slowed 
  things down.&nbsp; If this is a concern for you, have a self-proclaimed 
  &quot;expert&quot; (the kind that do things for free) help you install it 
  differently.&nbsp; It has more than just anti-virus software on it.&nbsp; 
  Also, you&#39;ll need to update it often.&nbsp; The Symantec I have know updates 
  ever 14 days with an option to do it sooner.&nbsp; </font></div>
  <div><font size="1"></font>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font size="1">Back to the original thought here - no one blames you anyway 
  (especially me).&nbsp; Truth be known, I suspect that I got it from a very 
  small, twelve woman list from a person who didn&#39;t know she had it.&nbsp; By 
  the time I figured out I had it, it had sent dozens, maybe hundreds of e-mails 
  out - mostly to myself!&nbsp; And I seem to have sent it to the 15,000+ 
  Flylady list as well as the unschooling list.&nbsp; If anyone has a red face 
  here it&#39;s me.&nbsp; So to all of you, I apologize.&nbsp; What&#39;s strange is 
  that I got rid of it days ago, and am surprised it just hit this list recently 
  - I thought it probably hadn&#39;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess these worms are 
  written so cleverly that the pause is intentional.&nbsp; Since this was my 
  first ever virus/worm, I am now well-schooled in the dangers of strangely and 
  alluringly titled attachments.&nbsp; However, I never received the enticement

proper website but if you go to www.download.com and look up <br/>
virus software you should find it.  However I did a full virus scan <br/>
after getting these messages (I figured out it was the ones with the <br/>
three &#39;RE&#39;s in the subject header, so i don&#39;t even have to open the <br/>
message, I know this can be a problem for OE users) and it didn&#39;t <br/>
find anything, even with a fresh update, so either I wasn&#39;t infected <br/>
cos I use Pegasus email reader or Inoculate doesn&#39;t have av for this <br/>
one yet :-(  but I haven&#39;t seen any of mine go out odd...<br/>

    <div><font color="#008080" size="4">i think this particular worm is a replica of 
    a previous one. Symantec&#39;s site listed it as first being reported on April 
    11th of this year. I ended up getting the Norton Utilites Systemworks. I had 
    wanted to get it earlier, but kept putting it off for financial reasons. It 
    automatically updates whenever you go online. Nice feaure. I had the day 
    from hell yesterday anyway. Between the virus, car troubles and children

      <div><font size="1">Johanna - Do not feel bad about the lack of anti-virus 
      software.&nbsp; I have the software, yet I was affected. Everybody who 
      uses the internet/e-mail knows they are open to this risk.&nbsp; 
      Thankfully, the software is available online.&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to 
      apologize (more on that later), although your apology is graciously 
      accepted by all, no doubt.&nbsp; By the way,&nbsp; I have an extra McAfee 
      program (got it free as an incentive for something else - e-mail me if you 
      want me to mail it).&nbsp; When I had the full suite on my older computer, 
      it left too much running and slowed things down.&nbsp; If this is a 
      concern for you, have a self-proclaimed &quot;expert&quot; (the kind that do things 
      for free) help you install it differently.&nbsp; It has more than just 
      anti-virus software on it.&nbsp; Also, you&#39;ll need to update it 
      often.&nbsp; The Symantec I have know updates ever 14 days with an option 
      to do it sooner.&nbsp; </font></div>
      <div><font size="1"></font>&nbsp;</div>
      <div><font size="1">Back to the original thought here - no one blames you 
      anyway (especially me).&nbsp; Truth be known, I suspect that I got it from 
      a very small, twelve woman list from a person who didn&#39;t know she had 
      it.&nbsp; By the time I figured out I had it, it had sent dozens, maybe 
      hundreds of e-mails out - mostly to myself!&nbsp; And I seem to have sent 
      it to the 15,000+ Flylady list as well as the unschooling list.&nbsp; If 
      anyone has a red face here it&#39;s me.&nbsp; So to all of you, I 
      apologize.&nbsp; What&#39;s strange is that I got rid of it days ago, and am 
      surprised it just hit this list recently - I thought it probably 
      hadn&#39;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess these worms are written so cleverly that 
      the pause is intentional.&nbsp; Since this was my first ever virus/worm, I 
      am now well-schooled in the dangers of strangely and alluringly titled 
      attachments.&nbsp; However, I never received the enticement of nude 
      photos. I&#39;ve been LOL just thinking of those of&nbsp;you sitting&nbsp;out 
      their staring at those attachment titles in bewilderment!!!</font></div>
