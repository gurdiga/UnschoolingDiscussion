You and some of the others here are inspiring to a new one like me.  <br/>
I have my monthly meeting with our &quot;ES&quot; on Thursday and OH am I <br/>
dreading it!  I am leaning to declaring my freedom on that day and <br/>
jump out of the California charter circus. Thanks to all. I am glad <br/>
to be a part of an encouraging and informative group. Sara</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274292741">I live in Grass Valley, Calif.  No I have not been to one of the <br/>
conferences in Sacramento.  I am planning to go this year.  Will you <br/>
be there? It would be fun to meet you! I enjoyed seeing you and your <br/>
family on your site also. It is nice to put a human face on these <br/>
posts!!!<br/>
<br/>
I tried yesterday to file my R-4 affidavit to set up my private <br/>
school (Calif. regulations) so I can leave our charter school but <br/>
found the Calif. Dept. of Ed.(CDE) has changed their policy and you <br/>
can no longer fill the form out  online as of 1/06/03.  You now have <br/>
to request the form in writing. I contacted HSC and their legal <br/>
committee told me NOT to call CDE and be very careful with what I say <br/>
in my request. They (HSC legal) are not happy with the change in <br/>
policy and don&#39;t know their motives behind the change. I hear that <br/>
some are being denied the application for the R-4.  HSC said to <br/>
contact them if I have any problems. They have been very helpful. <br/>
Also told me not to say anything to our charter school about leaving <br/>
until our R-4 is in place. I have to meet with our ES tomorrow so I <br/>
will really have to bite my tongue!! Anyone out here in Calif. filed <br/>
an R-4 lately? Any advice you can give me?  Thanks, Sara  --- In <br/>

<br/>
I was there in 2001 and 2002, but for 2003 they have decided to change <br/>
formats to mostly-panel-discussions, and while they would have been willing <br/>
to have had me on panels, they&#39;re unwilling to pay for a room or <br/>
transportation this year.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is REALLY disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe 2004.<br/>
