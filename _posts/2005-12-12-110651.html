Career & Education<br/>
BY BARBARA BLAKE-HANNAH<br/>
Sunday, December 11, 2005<br/>
<br/>
THE most important educational influence in my son&#39;s life was the<br/>
computer. When he was born I was using a typewriter for my writing, <br/>
and he<br/>
grew up during the development from manual to electric, then to <br/>
computer<br/>
keyboards.<br/>
<br/>
BARBARA BLAKE-HANNAH<br/>
I started using the original pre-Windows DOS computer with black <br/>
screen<br/>
and green letters at about the time he learned to read. This meant <br/>
that<br/>
the combination of my lap as his favourite seat, and his eagerness <br/>
to show<br/>
that he could read, enabled him to perform simple tasks on the <br/>
computer<br/>
like open file, print, save, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I soon acquired a computer with the first Windows 3.0<br/>
programme, he has never forgotten the basic DOS operations that are <br/>
the<br/>
foundation of computer use, and this knowledge/education formed his<br/>
development as a technology &#39;whiz kid&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
When he was four years old, I moved to Kingston and began a PR job <br/>
with<br/>
SPECS-SHANG Records manager Babsy Grange, who allowed me to bring my <br/>
child<br/>
to the office. Taking advantage of this enlightened opportunity, he <br/>
made<br/>
himself useful.<br/>
<br/>
He was not bored by learning and helping to do such office tasks as<br/>
printing documents from the computer, sending faxes and even <br/>
answering the<br/>
phone. His ability to read facilitated all these activities, and even<br/>
though he sometimes was a handful as children can be, he soon <br/>
learned how<br/>
to behave by imitating the adults around him.<br/>
<br/>
His education was further enhanced and assisted by the Ramocan <br/>
family, who<br/>
operated an educational book distribution office next door and gave <br/>
him<br/>
many of the excellent Merrill school books which he read quietly in <br/>
the<br/>
corner that became his &#39;office&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing his great interest in the computer, I read about and sent to <br/>
the<br/>
USA for a fascinating &#39;toy&#39; named Socrates, a device that plugged <br/>
into the<br/>
TV and connected by infra-red rays to a computer-like keyboard in the<br/>
user&#39;s lap.<br/>
<br/>
Socrates had game-like lessons in English grammar, spelling, maths,<br/>
general knowledge and even a place to make music. Socrates was as <br/>
wise as<br/>
its namesake, and taught my son not only knowledge, but fulfilled his<br/>
eagerness to use computers for learning and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Free to explore wherever he chose, he soon made Socrates, then later <br/>
my<br/>
computer, his personal assistant and tutor. You know the rest of the<br/>
story, how he was appointed Youth Technology Consultant to the <br/>
Minister of<br/>
Commerce & Technology in 1998 at the age of 13. It all started with<br/>
homeschool - giving him the freedom to learn what he was most <br/>
interested<br/>
in knowing.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;homeschooling&quot; is not the correct term to describe the methods <br/>
I used<br/>
to educate my son. The large majority of homeschooling parents run a<br/>
minature version of &#39;school&#39; in their homes, acquiring books and <br/>
lesson<br/>
plans of the regular curriculum, purchasing curriculum packages or <br/>
using<br/>
the Internet to access teaching websites.<br/>
<br/>
There is a fixed daily schedule of &#39;lessons&#39;, and the ultimate goal <br/>
is to<br/>
create a child that is &#39;brighter&#39; at a younger age and passes high <br/>
school<br/>
or university exams at a scholarship-winning level. Often this path <br/>
leads<br/>
to home-school &#39;burnout&#39;, where both parents and children buckle <br/>
under<br/>
this pressure and go back to traditional &#39;school.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Rather, &quot;un-schooling&quot; is the term more commonly used for the way I <br/>
did<br/>
it. Un-schooling means allowing the child to learn what he wants, <br/>
when he<br/>
wants, in the way he wants, where he wants, for his own reasons. The<br/>
method is learned-directed, and instead of a &#39;teacher&#39;, the parent <br/>
acts as<br/>
a facilitator and resource person for the student.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sounds impossible, doesn&#39;t it? The idea that children - even quite <br/>
young<br/>
children - should be in charge of their own education, choose what <br/>
they<br/>
learn and how they learn it, and even choose whether they should <br/>
learn<br/>
anything at all sounds ludicrous,&quot; writes Mary Griffith in her <br/>
excellent<br/>
book, The Un-schooling Handbook - How To Use The Whole World As Your<br/>
Child&#39;s Classroom.<br/>
<br/>
Griffith reminds us that the advent of what we know as &#39;school&#39; only<br/>
developed in the 1850s, and that formal education often lasted only <br/>
three<br/>
to five years, the time it took to learn the basics of reading, <br/>
writing,<br/>
arithmetic and a smattering of history and literature. The rest of <br/>
the<br/>
knowledge needed to become competent adults was acquired by working<br/>
alongside adults, either family or as apprentices.<br/>
<br/>
By the 20th century, schools developed into the formal institutions <br/>
we<br/>
know and became regarded as a necessary instrument to teach children <br/>
a<br/>
curriculum and discipline for future employment in the modern <br/>
mechanised<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Few children acquired their education outside schools, but there were<br/>
notable exceptions. Margaret Mead, the famous American <br/>
anthropologist and<br/>
heroine who was unschooled, said: &quot;My grandmother wanted me to have <br/>
an<br/>
education, so she kept me out of school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the 1970s, parents began to question the value of &#39;school&#39; as an<br/>
instrument of educational development. Led by the counter-culture <br/>
movement<br/>
of that era, many parents opted to give their children an alternative<br/>
upbringing and an education that fitted their concept of the global<br/>
village. Homeschooling also found favour with parents who felt their<br/>
religious values were not being transmitted to their children within <br/>
the<br/>
school system.<br/>
<br/>
Some families come upon un-schooling while their children are still<br/>
infants and deliberately set out to create circumstances under which<br/>
un-schooling can thrive.<br/>
<br/>
Others, like myself, develop similar ideas and practices accidentally<br/>
while searching for a form of education that they feel will give <br/>
their<br/>
child maximum intellectual possibilities. No two un-schooling <br/>
families are<br/>
alike. However, they all have characteristics in common.<br/>
<br/>
What is crucial in un-schooling philosophy, says Griffith, is to <br/>
know that<br/>
the child has the desire to learn.<br/>
