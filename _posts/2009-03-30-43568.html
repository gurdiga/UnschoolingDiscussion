not depend on side advice.  It&#39;s possible that one of the moms you&#39;ve  <br/>

1) The child should never have to suffer because the parent signed a<br/>
contract;<br/>
2) if the school was worth the cash while he was there, the environment is<br/>
not conducive to his life at this point, then it&#39;s worth the cash to bring<br/>
him home;<br/>
3) let this be a lesson in contracts for all of you, it&#39;s a conversation I<br/>

where you invest your cash and your signature;<br/>
4) that there school will probably still be standing long after your child<br/>
is grown; they can get another student, you can&#39;t get another *him*<br/>

<br/>
So that I can LEARN TO MAKE IT become part of my nature &quot;to make decisions in light of what leads to more peace and learning.&quot;  I&#39;m sorry, but is this list only for very experienced unschoolers?  I forget because there are a number of unschooling lists that I am on, and I apologize if I am troubling you with my struggles to think clearly in an unschooling and peaceful parenting manner.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, you&#39;re right -- though we have been trying our best to unschool for the last few years, I guess I am still in the deschooling stage.  The traditional ed. and traditional parenting mentality has been so ingrained in me that it has been a great struggle.  I thought I had made some progress, but apparently, according to you, I have not.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone can be as lucky or as brilliant as you (and I say this sincerely) in understanding the whole concept of unschooling and peaceful parenting so quickly and thoroughly.  I wish I didn&#39;t have to go through these struggles and have to bother experts like you for advice.  Since you have obviously been gifted with all this knowledge and understanding, I wish you would be more patient to us mortals, who are slower in *getting it,* but are trying they&#39;re best to.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I will read the link you sent me about *have-to&#39;s.*<br/>
<br/>
The introduction on the Always Learning website page says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.)&quot;  Please let me know if I&#39;ve been uncooperative.  As for being nice to play with or deal with in the list, shouldn&#39;t that apply to all members of the list, including moderators?<br/>

<br/>
Okay, if we were in person I think I WOULD be yelling.<br/>
<br/>
Shelly, you did not need to out yourself on the list.  We could have  <br/>
talked about the situation without talking about ANY individual  <br/>
particular person.<br/>
<br/>
When I wrote yesterday asking people to be honest, I didn&#39;t know that  <br/>
someone would write to me on the side (and others):<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am a member of your Always Learning Yahoo group, and I just read  <br/>
your post, Sandra, on &quot;List Business.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Okay. .  So you read where I tried to emphasize how important it is  <br/>
that people&#39;s messages to this HUGE LIST be well thought out and  <br/>
sincere and honest.<br/>
<br/>
The situation is about a child in school, who is in school at this  <br/>
point because the parents paid for it and don&#39;t want to take him out  <br/>
while it&#39;s still paid for.<br/>
<br/>
It is not the purpose of this list to discuss the problems caused by  <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wish I didn&#39;t have to go through these struggles and have to  <br/>
bother experts like you for advice. ...<br/>
Yes, I will read the link you sent me about *have-to&#39;s.*-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE TO EVERYONE:<br/>
Read the links first and THEN think and then *maybe* post back to the  <br/>
list.  Don&#39;t say &quot;I wish I didn&#39;t have to...&quot; and then promise to read  <br/>
the links about have to, or whatever links have been suggested.<br/>
<br/>
This is to anyone who&#39;s reading:   Is it not enough that this list  <br/>
exists and people will answer your questions?  That Joyce and I have  <br/>
been collecting the best writings of the past several years and  <br/>
putting them where you can get to them freely and easily?<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not just a moderator, I&#39;m the owner and operator.   Do you think I  <br/>
should be nice to your specifications or throw myself off the list!?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s uncooperative to want unschoolers to help with a school  <br/>
problem, yes.  I think posting about having to do something instead of  <br/>
reading what&#39;s already been written about the idea of choice vs. &quot;have  <br/>
to&quot; is uncooperative, yes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At our house, it has been liberating to learn the economic concept of  <br/>
&quot;sunk costs.&quot; A sunk cost is a cost that can&#39;t be recovered--that  <br/>
time, money, energy, or capital is gone, and it&#39;s not coming back. Why  <br/>
this has been liberating is that sunk costs are ideally irrelevant to  <br/>
future decisions, but it&#39;s easy to get sucked into the idea of &quot;I paid  <br/>
for this, so I have to use it, even though I&#39;m not enjoying it/it  <br/>
tastes bad/ it hurts/I&#39;d rather be doing something else right now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to get trapped into bad decisions because we can&#39;t let go of  <br/>
sunk costs. For instance, suppose I buy theater tickets. Three weeks  <br/>
later on the night of the show, I don&#39;t feel like going. I would  <br/>
rather have a quiet evening at home. My choices are:<br/>
<br/>
1. Stay home. I&#39;m out the money for the tickets, but I enjoy my  <br/>
evening and feel rested and refreshed.<br/>
<br/>
2. Go to the theater even though I don&#39;t want to. I&#39;m still out the  <br/>
money for the tickets, but I end the evening feeling even more  <br/>
frazzled than I began, still wishing for a quiet evening I might not  <br/>
be able to get for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the tuition, going forward a parent can:<br/>
<br/>
1. Keep paying tuition and keep the child in an unhappy school  <br/>
situation until the contract expires.<br/>
<br/>
2. Keep paying tuition, as the contract requires, but remove the child  <br/>
from school, get a start on de-schooling, relax and enjoy some family  <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
The financial cost is the same in either situation. What is different  <br/>
in each situation are the _future_ costs, and that&#39;s what it can help  <br/>
to compare.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to be all jargon-y and abstract, or to start a  <br/>
conversation about economic theory! But my partner and I fairly  <br/>
regularly, when one of us is making a decision, will remind each  <br/>
other, &quot;That&#39;s a sunk cost. Let it go. What do you want to do _now_?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What this school year costs in money is a sunk cost. What it costs in  <br/>
other ways can still be changed going forward. You may not have any  <br/>
control over the tuitions costs but you do have control over some of  <br/>
the others.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

contracts, and how they can be used and misused.<br/>
<br/>
One of my sons just told me he doesn&#39;t want to take drum lessons anymore.<br/>
I could choose to be angry and make him continue to take lessons.  I paid<br/>
for six weeks of lessons and I can&#39;t get that money back.  I can say, &quot;If you <br/>
choose to spend my money, then you are choosing to commit your time.&quot;<br/>
But that does not honor the fact that people&#39;s needs and interests change.<br/>
So I would not use &quot;if-then&quot; like that.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I choose to be loving and accepting and supportive.  Why should<br/>
DS feel guilty that his interest in drum kit lessons has waned?<br/>
<br/>
The money is already spent, but his time is *not*.  I would much rather see DS <br/>
spend the time doing something he loves. I let him know that, that his time has <br/>
value.  His joy has value.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think kids should concern themselves with the money their parents<br/>
choose to spend on them.  Kids shouldn&#39;t feel like they &quot;have to&quot; do something<br/>
just because money has been spent.<br/>

&gt; I could scream. Unschooling is about helping children see their<br/>
&gt; choices. PARENTS HAVE CHOICES TOO!!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the most painful things in my life is seeing all these kids that<br/>
have no choices, or feel like they have no choices, or have a bunch of<br/>
bad choices to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
I had a talk with Chamille&#39;s best friend yesterday that involved the<br/>
legalities of emancipation.  Her first choice is to be legally adopted<br/>
by our family, which I would do in a heartbeat, but I know that it will<br/>
never be, since she has 2 biological parents, and grandparents<br/>
somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
This is a kid that feels she has no choices, and the choices she has are<br/>
in the realm of endangering her life as a runaway, or staying in a house<br/>
that is miserable.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can do a LOT of damage to kids by removing choices.  Kids, like<br/>
adults react in the way all people do, to control and lack of choices. <br/>
They will do everything in their power to resist, their whole existence<br/>
depends on sovereignty and the search for it.  If you seek to control<br/>
another, I imagine, the first thing you do is to remove choices to<br/>
establish power and dominance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been dealing with this for years, this hurt child, friend of my<br/>
daughter.  I was grappling with my own feelings of lack of control and<br/>
choices about what I CAN do.  I&#39;ve been thinking about this since<br/>
yesterday&#39;s conversation.  I&#39;ve thought about it before.  There was<br/>
something different about our conversation yesterday, it was as if, for<br/>
the first time, she has recognized that she has choices, which is<br/>
simultaneously beautiful and scary.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve allowed, to an extent, this man dictate how things will go, and do<br/>
as much damage control as possible, just so that our kids can spend<br/>
small amounts of time together.  In many ways Chamille handles the<br/>
situation better than I do and I attribute that to the fact that she<br/>
hasn&#39;t been damaged by control and lack of choices.<br/>
<br/>
If a child, or a parent feels like they don&#39;t have choices, free<br/>
choices, then how can we ever learn how to responsibly handle the<br/>
choices we do have?  This relates to another topic recently about<br/>
failure to meet standards.  Making choices involves trial and error and<br/>
learning.  Without ever making the choice to try something, wether the<br/>
outcome is successful or not, we will never learn from it.  Some<br/>
mistakes can never be undone.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent recognizes that going to school is harming their child, it<br/>
is a mistake to continue that harm.  Learn from that mistake, don&#39;t make<br/>
it again, make a better choice!</div>

you would be more patient to us mortals, who are slower in *getting it,* but<br/>
are trying they&#39;re best to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know, too, it seems intimidating when others seem natural at what I<br/>
struggle to grasp.  What I&#39;ve discovered is the mindset of the experienced<br/>
unschooler is the same mindset of the beginner - the goal is set and we<br/>
reach for it; sometimes starting over every few minutes, every day. It&#39;s a<br/>
matter of stronger muscles from more frequent practice.  Listening to<br/>
Parenting Peacefully is my #1 recommendation for beginning to collect voices<br/>
to live in your head; voices who can lead you where you want to be - in<br/>
peaceful relationship with yourself and your loved ones. You can do both at<br/>
the same time, Sandra speaks of this (in my head, often) as Practice What<br/>
You Want to Be Good At.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>
<br/>
I remind myself, while breathing, that I do not have the energy to address<br/>
the voices who may insist I *cannot* __________; I work tko reinforce and<br/>
listen to the voices that lead me to what I *CAN* do.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone CAN channel their inner unschooler.  Invite your image of your<br/>
favorite unschooler to sit in the corner of your living room - act as if you<br/>
are doing unschooing under their watchful eyes and advice. I praqcticed this<br/>
for MONTHS before I even met Sandra in real life.  Being in her space and<br/>
around her children really helped reinforced those visits, along with the<br/>
cassette of the talk ;) I have other unschoolers I still call upon to<br/>
visit-in-spirit, depending on my situation-at-hand (I had a whole team ready<br/>
for my recent visit to the school-thinking friends and in-laws last week -<br/>
it *still* helps keep me calm and in practice of what I really want to be<br/>
good at).<br/>
<br/>
It helps me to remember, too, that even the calmest, most confident<br/>
unschooling parent, had normal, human baggage to overcome, too. The biggest<br/>
benefit to the leap to unschooling is a big sense of urgency. You only have<br/>
NOW to experience; do not wait for whatever arbitrary date you&#39;ve got set.<br/>
That kick-in-the-pants urgency is the GREATEST gift I&#39;ve received from these<br/>
sorts of discussions. One shot at parenting *this* kid, what am I gonna do<br/>
with it?<br/>

with people for most of that time (all of it, counting the La Leche  <br/>
League years talking about nursing and babies and then childbirth  <br/>
activism group and then unschooling), I&#39;m able to help other people  <br/>
see where they&#39;re on the wrong path.<br/>
<br/>
Putting a child in school is clearly not the right path to  <br/>
unschooling.  That&#39;s not even the opposite of lucky and brilliant.  It  <br/>
was a conscious decision that was not in an unschooling direction.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Since you<br/>
have obviously been gifted with all this knowledge and understanding,  <br/>
I wish<br/>
you would be more patient to us mortals, who are slower in *getting  <br/>
it,* but<br/>
are trying they&#39;re best to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sarcasm and snarkiness aside, putting a child in school is not trying  <br/>
one&#39;s best.   It&#39;s not being slow to get it, even.<br/>
Leaving a child in school just because the tuition is paid and then  <br/>
insulting unschoolers when it&#39;s pointed out isn&#39;t trying one&#39;s best to  <br/>
get unschooling.<br/>

Thank you for taking the time to spell it out so clearly -- I really appreciate it!  I agree so much with all the points you&#39;ve listed below and even asked my husband to read them.  He thought it made a lot of sense.  Thanks for helping us look at it from a different and better perspective!<br/>

1) The child should never have to suffer because the parent signed a<br/>
contract;<br/>
<br/>
2) if the school was worth the cash while he was there, the environment is<br/>
not conducive to his life at this point, then it&#39;s worth the cash to bring<br/>
him home;<br/>
<br/>
3) let this be a lesson in contracts for all of you, it&#39;s a conversation I<br/>
wish I&#39;d had swirling around me as a kid - Caveat Emptor - be very careful<br/>
where you invest your cash and your signature;<br/>
<br/>
4) that there school will probably still be standing long after your child<br/>
is grown; they can get another student, you can&#39;t get another *him*<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my son Patrick was in school and became chronically unhappy, by<br/>
the time my wife and I decided to take him out of school there were<br/>
only seven weeks remaining to the end of the school year. At a<br/>
meeting with his teacher and the school counsellor a few days after<br/>
the decision, we agreed as a courtesy to the school that Patrick<br/>
would complete the year.<br/>
<br/>
It was a totally stupid agreement. The final seven weeks turned out<br/>
to be very tough for both Patrick and myself - I was the one who was<br/>
taking him to school every morning and picking him up in the<br/>
afternoon, plus I was in school for at least some of the time every<br/>
day for &quot;moral support&quot; in one way or another - morning assembly,<br/>
helping with the reading program and in the canteen, whatever it<br/>
took. It was a huge, huge effort that took massive doses of &quot;positive<br/>
thinking&quot; to cope with and it was all totally UNNECESSARY. We went<br/>
through it because *I* decided to honour the agreement I&#39;d made. It<br/>
didn&#39;t matter to anybody else, they just got on with their lives.<br/>
Even when it got tough, I didn&#39;t have the sense to think, &quot;Maybe we<br/>
ought to forget what we agreed to and quit right now.&quot; What an idiot.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely, if I had my time over again, I wouldn&#39;t even have<br/>
bothered with a meeting with the school&#39;s representatives after the<br/>
decision to remove my son had been made; I would have taken Patrick<br/>
out of school on the day and too bad if the school didn&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m probably adequately &quot;deschooled&quot; these days (&quot;Schools?<br/>
Yeah, don&#39;t *they* have an overinflated sense of their importance in<br/>
the world?&quot;) and I&#39;ve been able to make it up to my son and more and<br/>
we&#39;re both over it (we had the conversation a few years ago).<br/>
<br/>
The year after my son quit school, a local karate club was recruiting<br/>
new members and Patrick was curious so my wife and I signed him up<br/>
for a trial period that cost $120 (a non-refundable deal). I took him<br/>
along to the first evening&#39;s class - which, as it happens, was in the<br/>
assembly hall at his former school - and the guy running the class<br/>
had all the kids lined up and doing drills and was shouting out his<br/>
instructions like a sergeant-major, and I&#39;m thinking, &quot;Hmm ... I<br/>
wonder if Patrick is going to take to this&quot;. Patrick didn&#39;t like it<br/>
at all. So he quit after the first lesson. My wife and I simply wrote<br/>
off the $120. We&#39;d learned our lesson. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, not long afterwards, I ran into the mother of one of<br/>
the boys in that introductory karate class who was also an<br/>
ex-classmate of Patrick&#39;s, in my local supermarket. She asked me if<br/>
Patrick was still doing the karate. &quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;He hated it. He<br/>
never went back after that first lesson.&quot; &quot;Oh, thank goodness,&quot; she<br/>
replied, &quot;It wasn&#39;t just me&quot; and she told me her son had hated it too<br/>
and had quit after the first lesson and people had told her she was<br/>
silly for throwing away money after she&#39;d paid for six lessons.<br/>

to have an experience.  If the experience doesn&#39;t feel positive, that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean the money wasn&#39;t well spent.  If a child knows after <br/>
one or two classes, or two years of classes, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m not digging this at all...&quot; <br/>
then great!  The opportunity served its purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I do prefer it when folks let you take a trial class (or two),<br/>
or are willing to refund money if find the activity &quot;working&quot;<br/>
for you, but not everybody operates that way, so sometimes<br/>
you just have to take a chance and see what happens.<br/>

wanting to try the new activity. I think it takes active thinking on the <br/>
adult  part to overcome that feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn also freely left a dance class that she was unhappy with after just <br/>
three lessons, with no refunds. She still talks about why it didn&#39;t work for <br/>
her, and contrasts it with how happy she is with her other dance class.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if it was said, but has Miguel (I think the op&#39;s child&#39;s name) <br/>
himself asked to come home, or is it entirely parental discomfort with the <br/>
drama in the playground?<br/>

He had been so excited about both.

Anyway, I was concerned about the money at first and I was actually able to get some of the swimming money credited back for future lessons for other family members.  But, by the time I called about it had decided it wasnt important.  <br/>
The night he went to soccer and decided not to play, an acquantance had a son there who didnt want to either.  They dragged him onto the field, where he screamed till they dragged him home.  Yelling at him that he was ruining their family dinner by not playing and they were not going to get pizza now.<br/>
Kind of put it all in perspective for me.</div>

this analogy several times!  She went so far as to say, a dog can<br/>
sometimes even get away, or go to the humane society and have a chance<br/>
at a better life, but kids, no, kids can&#39;t.  They are stuck with their<br/>
abusers, and let&#39;s just call that what it is, it is abuse, and their<br/>
only recourse is running away, which is even worse, or foster care,<br/>
which may or may not be better or lasting.<br/>
<br/>
Animals get treated better than a lot of kids do.  It&#39;s heart breaking,<br/>
and very close to my heart right now.  (I probably shouldn&#39;t write about<br/>
this in my current state of thinking about it)  So, I&#39;ll leave it at<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, that reminds me of another incident with my son. <br/>
<br/>
After he left school, he played baseball for a couple of years with a<br/>
local club. His team would play a match on Saturday mornings and<br/>
practice on Thursday evenings. Most of the practice consisted of<br/>
drilling in the various techniques. Patrick just wanted to play<br/>
baseball and wasn&#39;t very keen on spending time throwing a baseball to<br/>
a partner over and over again or jogging around the playing field and<br/>
things like that.<br/>
<br/>
One time in his second year, when Patrick was playing for the under<br/>
10s, there was a recruitment drive to get more 7-10 year olds<br/>
interested in playing. It was to run for one half term on Tuesday<br/>
evenings and was sponsored and free, so no money involved, and there<br/>
was an incentive of a free (sponsor labelled) backpack and an MLB cap<br/>
and t-shirt. Pat was told that if he came along to this he could skip<br/>
the Thursday practices, and that it would be just playing baseball,<br/>
giving newbies a chance to get a feel for the game (nothing to put<br/>
them off, like drills and such!).<br/>
<br/>
So, Patrick thought that was a pretty good deal, playing baseball<br/>
twice a week and no drills. We came along to the first week, Patrick<br/>
with his glove and in his club uniform, he got his free backpack and<br/>
a Cardinals cap and t-shirt, and all the kids took to the field. But,<br/>
of course, this was baseball for the benefit of total beginners, so<br/>
the coach set up the tee for T-ball. On seeing that, Patrick walked<br/>
off the field.<br/>
<br/>
I was sitting on one of the benches and he came and sat down next to<br/>
me and said he thought he would be playing baseball, he wasn&#39;t going<br/>
to play T-ball and he wanted to go home (when he&#39;d been a beginner,<br/>
his team coach had pitched to the batters underarm, so he&#39;d never<br/>
used a tee and I guess he thought T-ball was baseball for babies).<br/>
Anyway, the guy running the evening followed Patrick over and asked<br/>
him what the problem was. Patrick told him he&#39;d come to play baseball<br/>
and wasn&#39;t going to play T-ball. So the guy was saying something<br/>
like, &quot;Come on, you went to all the trouble of getting dressed up in<br/>
your uniform and you&#39;re here now, so you don&#39;t want to miss all the<br/>
fun, do you?&quot;. He looked at me anticipating I would back him up, but<br/>
I looked up at him and said very pointedly, &quot;He said he&#39;s not playing<br/>
T-ball.&quot; So the guy stopped talking, kind of shrugged and walked away<br/>
and Patrick and I went home, no questions asked. I felt really quite<br/>
good about both of us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding me. :-)<br/>
