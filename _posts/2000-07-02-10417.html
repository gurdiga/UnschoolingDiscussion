<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545006225">While there are many points which I feel strongly about in the <br/>
discussions which have gone on since I went, (some of which I was <br/>
in at the beginning) I understand that the threads have died, so I <br/>
won&#39;t go into my opinions on daycare, smacking, and feminism <br/>
unless I&#39;m asked.  But I thought I&#39;d say that while these were very <br/>
strongly-felt topics I didn&#39;t perceive any specific bashing of anyone.  <br/>
Perhaps this was due to my distance from the debate (I&#39;ve found in <br/>
the past that I&#39;ve had to keep out of certain debates cos they just <br/>
make me cross) but it seemed to me that (mostly) people did a <br/>
very good job of presenting their opinions and feelings as just that, <br/>
opinions and feelings.  While there were some broad <br/>
generalisations made, and there were some comments which were <br/>
turned around (perhaps touching some nerves? I, obviously, don&#39;t <br/>
know.) most of the discussions seemed to be conducted (on points <br/>
I both agree and disagree with) quite maturely &lt;g&gt;  If you don&#39;t <br/>
mind me passing judgment on your behaviour &lt;bigger grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing that struck me was the reaction to being posted offlist.  I <br/>
have always understood this to be an appropriate way of continuing <br/>
or commenting on an on-list discussion which has worn out its <br/>
welcome on the list.  No doubt I&#39;ll be corrected if I&#39;m wrong, but I <br/>
thought this was proper netiquette.<br/>
<br/>
And so endeth lesson no.2 &lt;g&gt;<br/>
