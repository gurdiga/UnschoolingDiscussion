<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854511857">This is a very troubling development.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all based on the premise that if a little &quot;higher education&quot; is good, a<br/>
lot is even better.  The highereducation.org site reminds me of the milk<br/>
advisory board, or the beef council: both marketing firms which package<br/>
themselves as quasi public service agencies.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re seeing here is a not so subtle propaganda machine designed to<br/>
lure ever-increasing numbers of customers into buying the goods and services<br/>
of the massive higher education industry.<br/>
<br/>
So far we haven&#39;t put up a lot of resistance to this constant flow of<br/>
misinformation and onesided messages.<br/>
<br/>
However, as college costs continue to annually exceed inflation, I can only<br/>
hope that eventually more people will begin to recognize something is<br/>
terribly amiss.<br/>
