<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The Slow Food International Movement **<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holiday feasts serve as an island of bonhomie in an ocean of<br/>
&gt; hustle-bustle. Food and wine critic Carlo Petrini worries that such<br/>
&gt; opportunities for celebrating flavor and camaraderie have become<br/>
&gt; rare. Petrini pins the blame, in part, on America&#39;s obsession with<br/>
&gt; fast foods. In fact, he founded the Slow Food movement in 1986 in<br/>
&gt; response to the incursion of fast food restaurants into Italy. Now<br/>
&gt; an international organization with 60,000 members in 35 countries,<br/>
&gt; Slow Food works to &quot;counteract the fast food virus by defending<br/>
&gt; local food traditions and by reconditioning our collective<br/>
&gt; gastronomic consciousness.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The group champions a number of gustatory causes, such as defending<br/>
&gt; the biodiversity of crops and livestock and protecting the<br/>
&gt; historical heritage and practices of small-scale dining <br/>
&gt; establishments. Their &quot;Ark of Taste&quot; project attempts to discover,<br/>
&gt; catalog, and distribute regional and forgotten flavors. The group&#39;s<br/>
&gt; quarterly magazine, &quot;Slow,&quot; offers musings on matters of taste,<br/>
&gt; pleasure, and the habits of the movement&#39;s mascot, the contemplative<br/>
&gt; snail. As its U.S. director Patrick Martins says, &quot;We&#39;re trying to<br/>
&gt; bring the ethic of Thanksgiving into everyday life, not necessarily<br/>
&gt; eating that much or fighting with your parents, but sitting,<br/>
&gt; talking, and creating ritual more than once or twice a year.&quot;<br/>
