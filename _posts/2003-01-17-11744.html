<div id="ygrps-yiv-471172664">We were adopted by a neighbor&#39;s cat a couple of years ago.  Took Cougar to the vet yesterday for a check-up.  Turns out he has severe gingivitis.  Based on his age (3 or 4 years), the vet thinks the condition of his gums indicates something else going on, likely feline leukemia.  She prescribed antibiotic for the immediate inflamation, and would like to anesthetize him to do a complete dental cleaning and exam.  She also wants to do the blood test for leukemia.  All this would amount to at least $500.  I told her I really can&#39;t afford that, but we would discuss her suggestions as a family and decide what to do.<br/>
<br/>
I did some research on-line this am.  According to what I&#39;ve read, if the cat does have FeLV, then we need to do what we can so that he doesn&#39;t infect other cats.  Also, it is clear that his mouth bothers him.  I would like to do what I can to alleviate the pain, but everything I read indicates that extracting teeth is about the only thing that can be done.  I have thought of asking the vet if she will accept small monthly payments over the next year.  Any ideas?<br/>

We had two male cats just die kind of listless deaths from it, years ago.  <br/>
All the cats in our neighborhood who fought (all the males) got it kind of at <br/>
once.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t put money into it if you find out it&#39;s lukemia.  Just keep the cat <br/>
comfortable, get soft food for it, pet it, and let it live a while.<br/>
<br/>
Antibiotics for infection might not be a bad idea, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183359935">Several years ago we adopted a stray cat who turned out to be fe leuk<br/>
positive. <br/>
When we found him he had been injured and that was when we did the blood<br/>
test.   Since all my other cats at the time were vaccinated, we decided<br/>
to see what we could do for him.    He recovered from his initial<br/>
injuries (broken shoulder, fractured skull)  and was a really nice cat. <br/>
We named him Kirby because he sucked up every morsel of food he could<br/>
find.   He did have problems with his teeth, but after a cleaning and<br/>
exam it turned out that only one needed to be pulled.   Once or twice he<br/>
went on antibiotics for his mouth, and that worked fine.   We had him<br/>
four years and he had a happy and good life, if too short.   He staked<br/>
out his area near the heater and wouldn&#39;t budge.  He never once asked to<br/>
go outside, apparently having had his fill of cold, miserable weather. <br/>
He was sweet and happy and we still miss him. <br/>
<br/>
I live in a pretty rural area so that price you mentioned for teeth<br/>
cleaning and a fe leuk test seems wildly high. <br/>
Is that for a complete blood work up or just a fe leuk test?   Do you<br/>
live where you might travel to a more countrified place and find some<br/>
nice old country vet who doesn&#39;t have to charge high tech prices?<br/>
<br/>
You might find, after the infection is cleared up that it&#39;s only one or<br/>
two teeth bad enough to be extracted.  That&#39;d be worth it,  if he could<br/>
have some quality of life for however long he has.  <br/>
<br/>
We had an old cat who needed a lot of vet attention ( at a higher tech<br/>
clinic where they treated renal failure ) and they let me make payments<br/>
on it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I hope it&#39;s not fe leuk.   I&#39;m sorry if it is.  Poor little critter.<br/>

True, and there&#39;s the pound (in some communities, not all).<br/>

<br/>
We are fortunate in our little community to have two vets in practice<br/>
together who are really amazing.<br/>
One has been a vet for fifty years,  and has literally seen everything.  <br/>
Even the modern, well trained vet at the high tech vet clinic forty miles<br/>
away calls old Doc. Bissonnette for advice.   Folks around here trust his<br/>
advice more than their physician&#39;s. &lt;g&gt;   With good reason.   He&#39;s a<br/>
brilliant, caring man and a wealth of knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
 ***Humane<br/>

are<br/>
privately owned businesses.  It&#39;s not fair to expect the vets to<br/>
subsidize<br/>
low cost care to the strays and ferals.  Pet overpopulation and strays is<br/>
a<br/>
COMMUNITY problem, not a veterinary problem.***<br/>
<br/>
True, but here we have vets who are part of the community and twice a<br/>
year they organize a spay and neuter clinic for stray and feral cats and<br/>
low income pet owners.   In the fall our old countrified inexpensive vets<br/>
spayed 122 cats for the community of Deer Lodge,  at a reduced rate for<br/>
those who couldn&#39;t pay the full price and free for the captured feral<br/>
cats brought in by the local animal shelter.  They notch their ears so<br/>
folks can tell which cats have been spayed and in the spring volunteers<br/>
will get together again to round up feral cats (without notches) and get<br/>
them spayed and neutered.    Our vets were the voices at the city council<br/>
meeting where the fate of feral cats was being decided and spoke their<br/>
unwillingness to kill a couple hundred cats a year just because they are<br/>
an inconvenience.   These old guys have been a huge part of the solution<br/>
of a community problem.    <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in great admiration for vets of all varieties and it&#39;s true, these<br/>
old guys wouldn&#39;t have the equipment to do kidney transplants or<br/>
chemotherapy, but for what they can do, and certainly teeth cleaning,<br/>
extraction, blood tests, etc,  fall into that category, they&#39;re quite<br/>
remarkable and cheap.  <br/>
<br/>
This clinic is where Dylan got to help X-ray a bird and learned to wrap<br/>
broken wings and got to see how stitches are placed and where he gets<br/>
free disgusting posters about anthrax and tapeworms.   They show him<br/>
interesting X-ray and talk to him about interesting patients and let him<br/>
walk some of them and answer his questions.   Doc Bissonnette called<br/>
Dylan one afternoon and invited him out to see a herd of antelope that<br/>
had wandered close to his place and he always tells us where he spotted a<br/>
rattlesnake.   <br/>
<br/>
Cheap veterinary care can be astoundingly good!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205410671">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The overhead to run a veterinary clinic is quite high, as is the cost<br/>
of a great staff.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
Higher downtown than out in the country, often.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the rent, but the drugs, supplies, & equipment are the same.  And<br/>
often the solo doc will pay more because they aren&#39;t buying in bulk (lots of<br/>
companies will throw in cheaper or free product with bulk purchases, but if<br/>
it goes out of date because the smaller clinic can&#39;t use it all up, it&#39;s not<br/>
a bargain).  So I pay more for my vaccines, meds, test kits, etc.  And lab<br/>
fees are more as well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But it is also true that a farm vet might be willing to look at a cat with<br/>
less formality and expense than a downtown doctor with a fancy building.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Might is the operative word here.  Even the country vets also have bills to<br/>
pay.  Farm vets on large animal calls charge by the head, as they treat the<br/>
herd as a whole in lots of cases.  Much different than a small animal<br/>
practice, where the individual animal gets a complete exam.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We wanted our male cat checked for a bladder infection.  They wanted to<br/>
keep him overnight at great expense, to collect urine on their schedule.  I<br/>
asked<br/>
if they could just assume infection and give me antibiotics.  NO, that<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be good medical practice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And rightly so.  Most cats with cystitis are sterile, and antibiotics won&#39;t<br/>
really help (not to mention contribute to antibacterial resistance).  A<br/>
urine sample at minimum is needed to check urine pH, check for the presence<br/>
of crystals, cells, blood, etc. before determining which course of treatment<br/>
is necessary. Bladder stones need to be ruled out as well (not to mention a<br/>
ton of other things.  We once had a kidney worm; very rare, but there.)  A<br/>
cat I saw recently had intersticial cystitis, which cleared up on the meds,<br/>
then a few weeks later started again with symptoms.  A repeat urinalysis now<br/>
showed a high pH and crystals, necessitating a completely different course<br/>
of treatment.  So, a recurrence is not necessarily the same as before,<br/>
either, even in the same cat!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Small-town vets (in my northern-New-Mexico experience) don&#39;t have<br/>
uniformed staff or fancy plants or walls of literature, they have a building<br/>
out back of their house. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of small town vets in Connecticut and Massachusetts don&#39;t either,<br/>
including me.  My practice was in my basement, but that didn&#39;t negate the<br/>
bills, and I wasn&#39;t cheaper than the other clinic in town, even when I had<br/>
no staff.  When a thing as simple as a scale costs $750 and a cage $1000,<br/>
that&#39;s a lot of money.  My practice is now in a small strip mall that&#39;s in<br/>
need of a paint job, but the location is good and the rent is cheap.  Still<br/>
can&#39;t charge less.  And I have worked in country practices in Texas and<br/>
Tennessee, too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t see the suggestion as having been an insult to the veterinary<br/>
trade, nor the idea that someone who charges less isn&#39;t as competent as<br/>
being a fair one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I take that back.  One of the worst vets I worked for was also one of the<br/>
most expensive.  He was a great charlatan and the clients bought it hook,<br/>
line, & sinker.<br/>
<br/>
In general, those practices that practice good medicine will cost more.  It<br/>
costs more to keep updated equipment, attend conferences to keep up with<br/>
advances, have a decent and well-trained staff that also attend continuing<br/>
ed conferences (turnover is high as the pay is notoriously low), and newer<br/>
and safer drugs cost more.<br/>
<br/>
Take the cat spay.  Why does is cost so much?  How much is too much?  If you<br/>
actually factor in the real costs, including equipment use and maintenance,<br/>
staff time, drug costs, surgery suite, IV caths, fluids, pain meds, heart<br/>
monitors, etc., the cost is well over $300.  But I know of no vets that<br/>
charge that much.  In fact, if the spay costs less than $100 I can almost<br/>
guarantee that there is little or no pain meds used (butorphanol, the drug<br/>
most commonly used, if any, lasts a whopping 30 minutes and is not redosed),<br/>
no catheter or fluids (maintains hydration and blood pressure, as anesthesia<br/>
causes profound hypotension), minimal monitoring.  I have seen many lower<br/>
cost places (yes, I have worked in them) use no cap/mask/gown for a spay,<br/>
which is major abdominal surgery.  I have seen more than one cat spayed with<br/>
the same instruments and not sterilized in between.<br/>
<br/>
Many times I have seen cases from Old Doc So&So who does the cheap work when<br/>
they come to me because the pet still has the problem.  The cat with<br/>
diarrhea actually had pancreatic insufficiency, not worms.  The dog with bad<br/>
breath didn&#39;t have dirty teeth (the cleaning didn&#39;t help) he had a severe<br/>
periodontal infection requiring long term antibiotics.  The wart that was<br/>
really a mast cell tumor.  Establishing a diagnosis before treatment can be<br/>
critical.  I have seen it time and time again, as have most vets.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that not everyone can afford to do everything.  But I am a firm<br/>
believer that the BEST option should be presented to the owner and that the<br/>
owner should decide if they want to pursue that option.  The lesser options<br/>
are also available, but sometimes are not the best route to go, but if one<br/>
understands that symptomatic treatment may not work, then fine.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And here is all this absolutely free unschooling advice.<br/>
You COULD pay someone $60 an hour for phone consult, but it wouldn&#39;t be as<br/>
good as what you could get online with a couple of mailing lists and<br/>
unschooling.com by reading for the same amount of time, or leaving a<br/>
question and getting free answers.<br/>
I&#39;m serious about the phone consults.  More people are charging to advise<br/>
homeschoolers by phone.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And most veterinarians give free phone advice as well.   There are pet care<br/>
forums staffed by vets also, for free.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Old adages don&#39;t always apply.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True.  But lots of times there is a nugget of truth in there somewhere.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159625048">We took the cat back for a recheck.  The vet said it looked like the antibiotics helped, but she could still see some inflamation.  Her only option for payment plans is 3-months no interest, then 22% on the remaining balance.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the tests for FeLV and FIV, she didn&#39;t act as if it is so urgent, now that she knows I can&#39;t pay to have it done right now.  The only symptom my cat is showing is gingivitis, otherwise he seems healthy.  She said cats can have the virus yet not actually become ill for years.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who sent me ideas on this.<br/>
