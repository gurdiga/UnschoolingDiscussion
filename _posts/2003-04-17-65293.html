 </span></blockquote>Quick Chess is really good. It&#39;s like quarter of the board with half the<br/>
pieces. It really is quick and it makes it easier to learn how things move<br/>
and basic strategy. It&#39;s the only modification of the game the US Chess<br/>
Federation endorses.<br/>
<br/>
We have Lego Chess and another chess program that haven&#39;t gotten much use<br/>
but I can&#39;t say they&#39;re bad. My husband just never thinks to play them<br/>
because he has Chessmaster and sometimes Kathryn joins him.<br/>
<br/>
They do the chess puzzle in the paper and Puzzles for Children by David<br/>
Levin occasionally.<br/>

The board has the basic instructions running along the top and bottom as well so you can refer to that while playing instead of having to constantly refer to the book.  <br/>

Searching for Bobby Fischer has a cool scene where he has set his Lego men up <br/>
like chessmen and is working out moves before he even owns a chess set.<br/>
<br/>
I need to buy a copy of that movie.  <br/>

it. My son (6) has already beaten the computer once, so I&#39;m not sure how<br/>
challenging it is (then again, he&#39;s beaten DH twice, so maybe it is!) It&#39;s<br/>
cute, you can have the chess pieces be Lego pirates or Lego soldiers (from<br/>
the Fort series) or regular chess pieces and it has little movies about the<br/>
Lego guys when one of them takes another piece. I don&#39;t know if it has any<br/>
kind of teaching mode. I borrowed a good Chess for kids book when DS was 4<br/>
and wanted to learn, it had some of the history of the game and such, and<br/>
then how the pieces move and some basic strategies, but I can&#39;t remember<br/>
what it was called.<br/>
