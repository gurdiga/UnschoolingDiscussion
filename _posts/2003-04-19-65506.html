<div id="ygrps-yiv-137826110">I got the tape, sure enjoyed it.  I feel like I&#39;ve gotten a tiny taste of <br/>
something I want much more of!  LOL!  I am eyeing a couple books by Thich <br/>
Nhat Hanh on Ebay.  I also really appreciated Sandra&#39;s insistance on the tape <br/>
to take the change over to peaceful parenting one step at a time, to not <br/>
expect a change right away.  Do you have any more tapes Sandra? :o)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Where does one acquire this peaceful parenting tape? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have some and will get some more to sell in South Carolina, but really the <br/>
cheapest, fastest and easiest way to get them is here:<br/>

Peaceful Parenting was a joint presentation of  Richard Prystowsky and <br/>
myself, so it&#39;s listed under both names.<br/>

  I would buy her a copy of Sandra&#39;s peaceful parenting tape.  I think <br/>
  it might be helpful to the mom. :)<br/>

The many benefits of video games was really good too.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another one there, though.  The practicalities of <br/>
unschooling.  I don&#39;t remember that one before.  Is that from this <br/>
year maybe?  There&#39;s another one there too by Richard Prystowsky <br/>
called The Heart of Homeschooling.  Were they there before and I just <br/>
missed them or are they new?  <br/>

Practicalities of Unschooling is another intro to unschooling.  <br/>
Peaceful Parenting is listed under my name and Richard&#39;s both--it was a duet. <br/>
