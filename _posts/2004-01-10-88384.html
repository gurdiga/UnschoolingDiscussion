talking about various concepts of heaven and hell. I was outlining what I <br/>
recalled of the CS Lewis description of heaven as an acquired taste that might not <br/>
sound very good to us right now, and the part about a child thinking heaven must <br/>
be all the chocolate candy yo want, while a grown man might imagine heaven as <br/>
all the sex he wanted. And Lewis arguing that just as the child can&#39;t <br/>
conceive of the man&#39;s version, probably the man can&#39;t conceive of whatever the next <br/>
higher level would be. Mortification probably -- yuck.  I&#39;ll stick with the <br/>
candy and sex too. :)  JJ<br/>

Once, sitting in the dirt driveway of my granny&#39;s house in Texas, my cousins <br/>
and I were discussing heaven.  I was five or six.  It started because the sun <br/>
was behind a cloud and the edges of the cloud were all gold.  So of course <br/>
that was God, in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
And we decided that in heaven you could have whatever you wanted, whenever <br/>
you wanted, as long as it was a good thing and not a mean or sinful thing.  So I <br/>
settled on my wish, which was all the ice cream I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I remember sitting with my face up toward the summer sun, eyes closed, <br/>
smiling, picturing heavenly ice cream.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317630681">One of our old priests, who loved sci-fi novels and movies, said his idea of <br/>
heaven is being able to explore all the galaxies safely in a spaceship.  Being <br/>
able to go anywhere, everywhere, beyond anything we could fathom.  Sounded <br/>
cool to me!<br/>

<br/>
A few years ago the kids were sitting around the table talking about heaven.<br/>
Zach scared Marsie (then 4) by telling her that heaven was probably just<br/>
like church....you have to sit still and listen to somebody yell at you (our<br/>
preacher had a fundamentalist bent).  No one thought that sounded good.<br/>
<br/>
Zach said he was pretty sure heaven was an army surplus store.<br/>
