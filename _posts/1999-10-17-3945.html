     I just read your Blue Collar essay and I loved it.  Your story is very <br/>
interesting and I agree strongly with your message.  I don&#39;t know if my dad <br/>
has reached a level of confidence yet where he values himself for who he is <br/>
completely but I would like to print up your essay and have him read it.<br/>
     One side thing I thought about while reading this: with a passion for <br/>
German Literature, you must have read Goethe.  I am just starting to read <br/>
him, having read some of his quotes in other books.  Are there any of his <br/>
writings that you would recommend in particular?  I am totally new to it.  <br/>
The book I bought is Goethe The Collected Works Volume 4,  From My Life  <br/>
Poetry and Truth (Parts One to Three).  I know I will probably lose some of <br/>
the flavor of it reading it in English but I&#39;m afraid my German is limited to <br/>
things like, &quot;How much does that cost?&quot; and &quot;Where is the bathroom?&quot; from the <br/>
three years we lived in Germany.  <br/>
     As always, thanks for sharing your thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
      Lucy</div>
