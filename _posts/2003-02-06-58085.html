&gt; Again, reality doesn&#39;t match what we fear will happen. Advertising isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; that hard to understand. It&#39;s a pretty simple concept. I&#39;ve always trusted<br/>
&gt; that my daughter is intelligent enough to get the concept.<br/>

GREAT post! I was going to answer and my brain was too foggy and I was<br/>
hoping someone else would come along and answer and, like summoning a genie,<br/>
voila! -- Joyce. ;)<br/>

Re: advertising -- it was pretty easy for my daughters to grasp the concept<br/>
of people trying to sell them things and learning that things did not always<br/>
work in the way advertised. A valuable bit of knowledge, I think, for<br/>
anybody in our society.<br/>

thing in way fewer words!<br/>
