 </span></blockquote>Well I think that&#39;s wonderful. I wish I would have started earlier so I <br/>
could have more kids now. I&#39;m trying to talk my hubby into another one but <br/>
after our last birth experience, he&#39;s not real receptive. Plus we&#39;ve already <br/>
outgrown our house of 2 years. But I still wish for a 5th. Just too old to <br/>
do more but I think 7 sounds wonderful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had 4 boys before we had our only girl.  I can imagine how people react,<br/>
we get it too even though we only have 4 boys:)  I can say that I am having<br/>
a different experience with my only girl than I did with my 4 boys.<br/>

Now, that&#39;s interesting..Different in what way?..I often wonder how and if my sons&#39; childhood , with all brothers in a large family, is different to my childhood in a small single parent two child, one of each sex, family...They  *do have the advantage of unschooling/homeschooling, which I would have loved...Leonie W. <br/>
