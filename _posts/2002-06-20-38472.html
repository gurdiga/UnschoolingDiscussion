<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; So - I&#39;m curious - what did you learn? What kind of thing is there to <br/>
&gt; know <br/>
&gt; about cleaning? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When to use powdered cleanser and when not to.<br/>
&gt; How to clean out the runner in a shower door.<br/>
&gt; How to wash dishes by hand.  (I&#39;ve seen people stick a dirty pan right in <br/>
&gt; with glasses at the beginning; that won&#39;t work well at all.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tricks, like using old mismatched socks as disposable dustrags (put them on <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; your hands and just TOUCH everything you want to dust).  Like wiping Windex <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; off with crumpled up newspaper instead of cloth or paper towel, because it <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t leave any lint.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay - household tricks I understand - but you can get a thousand of those in <br/>
20 minutes of reading at the bookstore (I&#39;ve done it). It doesn&#39;t seem like <br/>
&quot;cleaning&quot; is that big a deal. I remember someone going on and on once, back <br/>
on the aol message boards, about making sure her children know the RIGHT way <br/>
to load the washing machine (not the dishwasher, the clothes washer). I mean- <br/>
okay, don&#39;t stuff it too tight with clothes, don&#39;t put new colored stuff in <br/>
with other things -- that&#39;s about it. It&#39;s all just common sense stuff, isn&#39;t <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
It is clutter that overwhelms me - I don&#39;t understand how to keep it under <br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
However, I had a housekeeper once (back in my previous life &lt;G&gt; when I was a <br/>
corporate economist). She was a woman much older than myself. I asked her <br/>
what I should do to keep my house more tidy. She said, absolutely seriously, <br/>
&quot;Pick up one thing and put it away. Then do the same with another. And then <br/>
just keep doing that.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This is the same type of thing I tell people who ask<br/>
me how I clean house.  I clean for people who seem<br/>
like they should really know stuff (doctors and<br/>
lawyers)  and they have no clue that the best way to<br/>
avoid bugs is to put dirty dishes in the dishwasher<br/>
instead of leaving it on the floor or table.  They<br/>
just put stuff where ever it is convenient and never<br/>
put anything away.   One house I clean once a week  is<br/>
clean when I leave it  and the next week I can barely<br/>
walk thru the house because there is so much stuff on<br/>
the floor.   The lady who owns the house asked me how<br/>
I get the house so clean,  and I told her that I just<br/>
put everything back where it goes  and she acted like<br/>
I told her some huge secret.  I say &quot;a place for<br/>
everything and everything in its place&quot;  I don&#39;t<br/>
remember where I heard this  but it is the way I try<br/>
to keep my space and it seems to work.<br/>
