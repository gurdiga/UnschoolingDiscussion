<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693513458">On the whole, our culture has developed an infatuation with the concepts of<br/>
education and training.  Whenever anything goes wrong, we pool our<br/>
curriculum specialists together to design a course to prevent the deviation<br/>
from ever occurring again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve become aware of the increased interest in workplace &quot;anger management&quot;<br/>
courses in the wake of this week&#39;s two workplace shooting rampages.  This<br/>
should be a good money-making opportunity for professional trainers.<br/>
<br/>
This is just one example of how we as a culture confront intractable<br/>
problems.  We apply &quot;first aid&quot; and equip the best &quot;ambulances&quot; money or our<br/>
political will can buy.  Somehow we seem incapable of putting our finger on<br/>
and discussing the deeper, often systemic sources of these problems.<br/>
