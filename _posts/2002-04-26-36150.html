<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532109010"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;This being the unschooling list, I feel strongly that I people should <br/>
&gt;&gt;suggest you try NOT to buy used curriculuanything.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra&#39;s right. It&#39;s probably good NOT to get caught up in all that. BUT you <br/>
can still have him getting the structure he wants without pre-packaged <br/>
curriculums.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;assign&quot; him a cool historical fiction book to read. (While, of <br/>
course, not caring if he ever gets to it. ;-))<br/>
<br/>
Get a cheap spiral notebook and write a few math problems in it. Leave it <br/>
out for him. If he does them, write a few more for the next day. If not, <br/>
that&#39;s okay! At the same time you might find some ways to really drive home <br/>
the point of math in real life. Bake, build, sort, estimate, buy stuff etc. <br/>
Talk about it all in a casual way.<br/>
<br/>
Buy him a journal and tell him that&#39;s for his writing skills. Tell him he <br/>
&quot;should&quot; write in it everyday. Then never ever read what he&#39;s written unless <br/>
he asks you to. And don&#39;t ever check up to be sure he&#39;s written something.<br/>
<br/>
Find the coolest Discovery Channel show you can and tell him it&#39;s his <br/>
Science assignment to watch it. Share in the joy and excitement of it all.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you get the idea. And everybody please note, these are ideas to ease <br/>
a schooled and reluctant kid into unschooling. I&#39;m not suggesting these are <br/>
good methods for unschooling in general.<br/>

    What you said above is what I neglected to mention in my first post. <br/>
Sorry about that! I&#39;m an unschooler in training ... I&#39;ll learn. =)<br/>

Take care,<br/>

On Dena, please don&#39;t cringe! It started a great discussion which is <br/>
branching out into all sorts of ideas and mind-opening stuff. It&#39;s good to <br/>
talk about all of it. :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the suggestions!  What we&#39;ve done up until this week has been on <br/>
the more relaxed side, more so than what he&#39;s saying he wants to do, actually <br/>
so it seems to be really more of getting him to either understand unschooling <br/>
or commit to using the expensive curriculum he wants before I spend all the <br/>
$$$ on it.  We might try doing something even more relaxed than what we have <br/>
been, but with a bit more structure than just unschooling next week to see <br/>
how it goes for everyone using things like you mentioned.  : )<br/>
