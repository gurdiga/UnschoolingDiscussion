<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396106193">Hello fellow Scadian and Shannon :-) I&#39;m Maire by the river in the SCA.<br/>
Where are you? I&#39;m in the East Kingdom. <br/>
<br/>
The SCA does have a lot of learning possibilities. My dd is very young<br/>
however, so we are just getting used to the SCA with a child. It was a<br/>
whole different ballgame when I was single and childless! I am on the<br/>
SCA moms list (also at Onelist) and there was recently a post about a<br/>
feast cooking class for young children (6 and up) that sounded like so<br/>
much fun! They had a group of children in the kitchen making and then<br/>
eating a mini medieval feast from period recipes. Using modern tools<br/>
tho, but at Pennsic this year (big camping event in the East and Mid)<br/>
they will be repeating the class using period tools (no gas oven, no<br/>
electricity, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
In our area we&#39;ve recently had a baby boom so people are coming up with<br/>
all sorts of ideas of things to do with young children. To not only keep<br/>
them occupied, but to teach them about medieval history. And of course,<br/>
the SCA covers a bit more than strictly medieval, so you have options on<br/>
time periods. And cultures too. Most people are European, but we have a<br/>
good size Japanese group around here. <br/>

&gt; middle ages wearing costumes. I do it because it is alot of fun, but it is<br/>
&gt; also educational for all of us. There are experts in crafts (needlework,<br/>
&gt; spinning, costume making,<br/>
&gt; cooking, woodworking,all sorts of things...), herbalism, games, dancing, and<br/>
&gt; of course, history of the times. People involved pick a persona which is a<br/>
&gt; person they create in history, a name, and research all about the life and<br/>
&gt; times of the persona they create, along with their skills and hobbies. I am<br/>
&gt; figuring out what my Irish name in the 1500s will be, and think I am a wise<br/>
&gt; woman healer type (as I used to be a midwife in regular life).Eithne, Aine,<br/>
&gt; Liadan, and Niv are names that I like.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At SCA events, they often have simulated safe fighting<br/>
&gt; too (fencing, pretend swords, armor, etc.)<br/>
&gt; There seem to be people willing to share expertise and that will be<br/>
&gt; wonderful for Gabe when he is bigger and able to make use of these mentors.<br/>
&gt; I am learning alot from them.<br/>
&gt; Learn more at www.sca.org . I don&#39;t think I have explained it well.There are<br/>
&gt; events where one can go, be loaned &quot;garb&quot; to wear, and watch and participate<br/>
&gt; in the current middle ages.<br/>
&gt; GWS mag has an article about living history and another on archeaology this<br/>
&gt; issue. The teens had chosen to learn<br/>
&gt; what they did.<br/>
&gt; Seems like your boy could find some aspect of history and learn alot about<br/>
&gt; it in this way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867759804">We do SCA also.  My daughter is 7 and enjoys the SCA a lot, though she <br/>
professes to despise history generally, probably to save herself from DH&#39;s <br/>
monologues on any given period or event.  She had a lot of fun at all the <br/>
Pennsic classes when we went when she was 5.  She did needlepoint, made a <br/>
scroll, played chess and boffer swords and target archery.  She helps with <br/>
armor at practices and occasionally embroiders a favor for someone.  My son <br/>
occasionally puts on bits of armor, but mostly he just likes banging on <br/>
things with sticks right now.  The SCA is just beginning to make provisions <br/>
for the interests of younger children, and DD does get bored at some of the <br/>
less interesting events, but she is always excited to go to another one the <br/>
next time.  I didn&#39;t know about the SCA moms list.  (Like I really need <br/>
another list!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This depends on your group. As I said, our Barony just had a baby boom<br/>
so it&#39;s the new moms and dads who are scrambling to come up with stuff<br/>
to do. If you are in an area with not many children, you might need to<br/>
be the one to come up with and implement ideas (not addressing this to<br/>
you specifically Karen, but to anyone interested). Here is a post I got<br/>
from the SCA moms list which was forwarded from the SCA cooks list. It<br/>
sounds really fun! <br/>
<br/>
Shannon, Mom to Bridget (OCt.8.98)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, I saw a need to fill and decided to run with it.<br/>
I really wanted to work with this problem for the past<br/>
couple of years, but never really had the nerve to do it.<br/>
I now have that nerve.<br/>
<br/>
The problem:<br/>
<br/>
1) unknown foods at events<br/>
2) children witn nothing to do<br/>
3) need for unskilled labor in kitchen (paring , mixing,<br/>
chopping, washing, etc.)<br/>
4) need for more  training for more active roles in kitchen<br/>
<br/>
The positive influences:<br/>
<br/>
1) A bored child is more willing to try anything to not be bored<br/>
2) A child is more often willing to eat something he has helped create.<br/>
3) What we see as unskilled labor is fun to children (Messy is good!)<br/>
4) Experience in a friendly atmosphere creates a liking for kitchen<br/>
duties.<br/>
5) I work well with children ( teaching and nursing background).<br/>
6) My mom taught me how a kitchen  can be made fun .<br/>
<br/>
The negative influences:<br/>
1) Period food is often strange to  a modern child<br/>
2) Previous help in the kitchen may have been unnoticed or unrewarded.<br/>
3) The decidedly adult atmosphere scares the timid child.<br/>
<br/>
My response:<br/>
<br/>
Small classes (of ten children) given out in areas requesting a<br/>
University style format.<br/>
<br/>
Example: At our most recent East Kingdom University, I provided a<br/>
workable (albeit, not typical) kitchen in which a maximum of ten<br/>
children <br/>
could create, and eat a small feast based on period sources. However,<br/>
the <br/>
cooking itself was thoroughly modern due to the constraints of the<br/>
working <br/>
area in a conventional classroom). I have a portable oven <br/>
(convection/broiler/microwave acquired in the 70&#39;s), an electric<br/>
steamer, <br/>
and a good quality crockpot.<br/>
<br/>
The menu:  Hirchones     from Harleian  MS 279<br/>
           La maniere de faire compost  from The Menagier du Paris<br/>
           Applemoyl from Harleian  MS 279<br/>
           Hot spiced cider<br/>
<br/>
The result: A class of six, one child under five ( I had limited the<br/>
ages from 6 to 12) , the father stayed to help the five year old. There<br/>
were <br/>
no other adults present.<br/>
<br/>
The chopping and paring took a great deal of time. The results were ill <br/>
formed and messy. They were incorporated into the final recipes with<br/>
great <br/>
admiration of a job well done and smiles from all.<br/>
<br/>
The spiced cider was a hit ! I encouraged  mortar and pestle use for the <br/>
spices and they also grated a nutmeg into the brew.  All pronounced it <br/>
excellent !<br/>
<br/>
The hedgehogs, ended up looking like space aliens (one done like Pikach<br/>
by <br/>
an older child who could not just make a hedgehog like the others) , but <br/>
three were fully eaten, one had the almonds eaten off, and two went home<br/>
to <br/>
show Mom how cool this was!<br/>
<br/>
The compost( mostly carrots) were considered to be  good. They really<br/>
liked the honey sauce ( no surprise here) and were promptly eaten.<br/>
<br/>
The applemoyl  had the best result of all , it was inhaled! The spices<br/>
(now, <br/>
all familiar: I explained what they were and we &quot;sampled&quot; them before<br/>
adding <br/>
them) mixed with  the apples and the other ingredients were very good.<br/>
While it did not look as visually pleasing to the adult eye (due to the <br/>
chopping episodes) it tasted better than it looked.<br/>
<br/>
The downside: While I had brought games to occupy them during the<br/>
cooking phase, I had forgotten that some do not participate well in<br/>
group <br/>
games. Next time I will bring solo activities too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Final Note:  All in all, we had a good time. I learned a lot, and so did <br/>
they. I think the best thing that happened to me is that when I asked<br/>
them <br/>
if they would do this again, EVERY ONE said yes!  My next class is this <br/>
weekend and I already have two on the schedule for Pennsic!! And at<br/>
Pennsic, <br/>
we will be using  camp fire cooking  techniques and be discovering how<br/>
to <br/>
use a turf oven !<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380150488">I love that you guys are talking about this right now! We&#39;ve been wanting to <br/>
get involved with our local group, but when I checked it out online the other <br/>
day, it said they were suspended, or something like that:(  I emailed someone <br/>
requesting information, but haven&#39;t heard anything yet.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to the Medieval Faire in Sarasota this weekend (our favorite <br/>
thing to do!), so I&#39;m hoping I may be able to get some info there.  Anybody <br/>
familiar with SW FL?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for this thread - I love it!<br/>

    The web page with all the local groups and contacts for Trimaris, <br/>
(Florida), is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.trimaris.org/contacts.html">http://www.trimaris.org/contacts.html</a><br/>
    A shire might have been suspended for something simple and easy to fix <br/>
like an on-going lack of paperwork, or it might be something that would <br/>
require you to look at the next local group over.  <br/>
    The other thing you might do is look at the kingdom calendar<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.trimaris.org/calendar.html">http://www.trimaris.org/calendar.html</a><br/>
and find an event happening reasonably close to you.  Contact the contact <br/>
person for the sponsoring group and explain that you&#39;re new and would like to <br/>
attend and see if they can loan appropriate clothes to your family for the <br/>
day.  <br/>
