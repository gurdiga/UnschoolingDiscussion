<div id="ygrps-yiv-262984066">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
After all my concerns of recent I just have to share with you today&#39;s<br/>
victories!<br/>
<br/>
This morning started out with my scheduling daughter scheduling once again<br/>
- right down to question time and bathroom breaks!  Sparing you all the<br/>
details the root of the problem came out.  The tears started flowing and I<br/>
learned that she was so aware that her old friends were back in school -<br/>
school buses going up and down the road, not hearing from the few she heard<br/>
from during the summer, etc.  She was having a hard time with the whole<br/>
thing (this is only our 2nd year hsing.)  After a much needed talk (this is<br/>
what dd is like - a volcano - she builds up pressure, builds up pressure,<br/>
manifests it in strange ways (schedules in this case) and then explodes on<br/>
me) she started playing joyfully like a trooper.  We even turned the whole<br/>
schedule thing into an unschooling lesson about scheduling our time and how<br/>
not to try to force it on others!  In tears she told me &quot;I guess I have<br/>
been trying to make our school seem like ps, huh?&quot;  Bless her heart.  They<br/>
go through so much sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
She wanted to tear up the schedule but I wouldn&#39;t let her.  We talked about<br/>
how it had helped her and that having a schedule in her private time was<br/>
fine if that is what SHE wanted.  But I wouldn&#39;t go there!  They both<br/>
really learned so much from this.  Funny how it all worked out.<br/>
<br/>
Then after basically blowing off the day (compared to our other days) we<br/>
came home and &quot;did&quot; our math (no, don&#39;t throw tomatoes at me :o)  Only to<br/>
run across an introduction to division problem that my 6 yo took on with<br/>
glee.  Something we had been doing together that I knew clicked with her in<br/>
division I showed her on paper - she lit up like a light bulb and took off<br/>
like a tornado with division problems.  &quot;Mom make up some problems for me<br/>
in division.&quot;  She learned the two ways to write division problems on<br/>
paper, worked about 30 problems, used apples as counters (we picked apples<br/>
today as well) and when she got to a problem that needed a decimal point<br/>
she mastered that too!  Yikes!  Try to stop her.   She bypassed that math<br/>
book at warp speed!  <br/>
<br/>
So you Minquon (sp?) math lovers out there - is there a web site I can<br/>
visit?  I really saw tonight how the text book dumbs the kids down a lot!<br/>
DD was really moving along until she started back with the apples and doing<br/>
what they did in the book - it is like it gets more complicated than<br/>
necessary and boggles their little brains.  No wonder my older dd feels<br/>
like she is too stupid to do math - she is probably beating her head<br/>
against imaginary walls trying to figure out the obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Then oldest daughter was typing and decided she wanted to learn proper<br/>
keyboard placement of her fingers - so I wrote her some exercises to start<br/>
off with.  We will see how that goes.  Anyone know of a good source for her<br/>
to use in this endeavor?<br/>
<br/>
OK, so Mom had a pretty good unschooling/deschooling day herself!  :o)<br/>
In His Service,<br/>
