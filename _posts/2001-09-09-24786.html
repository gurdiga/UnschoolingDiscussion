 </span></blockquote>Okay, I have to start out with the disclaimer that I have a really easy kid, <br/>
who has never responded to a simple request by refusing or throwing a fit. <br/>
But I have hung out in various other contexts with a wide variety of <br/>
personalities of kids. So keep in mind that I may be totally missing <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
It strikes me that if you have a kid who refuses to fulfill a simple, <br/>
reasonable request (&quot;Please throw the apple core into the garbage.&quot;), you <br/>
already have a problem pattern going on. It&#39;s one thing if the kid says, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
going to as soon as I finish this life on the Playstation game,&quot; which is a <br/>
reasonable response. (We owe it to our kids, I think, to try to function <br/>
WITHOUT sticks up our butts. And not agreeing to that reasonable delay WOULD <br/>
imply &quot;control issues.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I think respect for our kids is VERY important. I also think that respect for <br/>
parents is. By that I do not mean immediate, blind obedience. I THINK (again, <br/>
remembering that I have an easy kid) that Julian responds positively, and <br/>
usually in a timely manner, to requests we make of him because history has <br/>
proven that we generally make reasonable requests.<br/>
<br/>
(Another disclaimer: I would love passionately to believe that Julian&#39;s <br/>
general positive attitude and &quot;obedience&quot; (if you want to call it that--I <br/>
think of it as cooperation) is because of our superior parenting skills. And <br/>
having just one child I could probably blissfully assume that that is the <br/>
case---but I really don&#39;t think so. I think he&#39;s just like that.)<br/>
