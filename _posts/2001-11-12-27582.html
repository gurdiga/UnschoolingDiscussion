<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101798522"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From the newest issue of &quot;HR Magazine&quot; (Human Resources), an article called<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Home is Where the School Is&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The article is online, at the website of the organization that puts out the<br/>
magazine:<br/>

Here are some quotes from the article:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The number of homschooled children has tripled over the past decade, leading<br/>
to workplace changes as these children make their way into the workforce.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To find reliable employees, Chick-fil-A prefers to tap what it believes is a<br/>
unique source of talent - high school- and college-age homeschoolers...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When it comes to homeschoolers, I&#39;ve only heard good things from our<br/>
restaurant operators who employ them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Homeschoolers are popping up everywhere, moving seamlessly into colege and<br/>
the workplace, thriving in internships and in entry-and professional-level<br/>
jobs.  They&#39;re also making a mark as entrepeneurs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When Ray, who once taught science in the public school system, is asked to<br/>
describe homeschooled students for prospective employers, he paints a picture<br/>
that&#39;s almost too good to be true: &#39;Self-starters, reliable and creative,<br/>
intellectually perpared, better than average, read voraciously, watch TV<br/>
less.&#39; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[Homeschoolers} are stable and mature, good team players and likely to stand<br/>
up for what they think is right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The article had some quotes from critics of homeschoolers, and also explained<br/>
what homeschooling is.  The definite message of the article was that<br/>
homeschoolers are desirable employees.<br/>
<br/>
The article ends with the following paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the final analysis, if you&#39;re hiring, homeschoolers may be a good<br/>
investment.  Cutting through the stereotypes, Lines, who has studied the<br/>
movement for many years, perhaps says it best.  &#39;If I didn&#39;t know anything<br/>
about someone other than their education background, I&#39;d rather hop into a<br/>
foxhole with a homeschool kid than one from public school. The homeschool kid<br/>
will be a little better educated and dependable.  It&#39;s just the law of<br/>
averages.&quot;<br/>
