First, if homeschoolers grow up and homeschool their own kids, we could have<br/>
two or more generations of people running around the world knowing their<br/>
families really care about them and their needs, and not all messed up by<br/>
school.  That alone sounds great to me!<br/>
<br/>
The other piece, which Marilyn seems to miss, is that very few people just<br/>
stay home with their kids all their lives.  Unless you have so many children<br/>
that you are home from your late teens into your seventies with all of them,<br/>
you will have many child-free years to devote your energies to anything you<br/>
choose.  Of course, many people work part- or full-time while homeschooling,<br/>
volunteer their time, etc.  Plus, their kids, being unconstrained by the<br/>
school day schedule, often work and/or volunteer.  I had trouble seeing the<br/>
problem.  <br/>
<br/>
I think Marilyn thinks homeschoolers are *home* schooling.  My friends make<br/>
the same mistake.  But I&#39;m not home very much!  It&#39;s called LIFE!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
