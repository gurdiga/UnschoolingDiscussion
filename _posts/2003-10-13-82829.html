<div id="ygrps-yiv-334652442">yeah, news &lt;insert snort&gt;<br/>
they said BFing was dangerous too.<br/>
Anyone see Michael Moore&#39;s Bowling for Columbine?<br/>
My understanding of his data was that the fear presense in our media was very much a part of the killing in our society.<br/>
I stick with NPR and wont watch the other stuff, well we dont get channels out here, but...part of why I dont invest in cable...<br/>

Yeah.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;data,&quot; it was editorial commentary stretched to fit his <br/>
prejudices.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I stick with NPR and wont watch the other stuff&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With nothing to compare it to, you don&#39;t get much perspective.<br/>

Be careful about limiting your children to your preferred single mode of <br/>
input!<br/>
<br/>
And reading a while before posting is probably a good idea.<br/>

kid killed his siblings and then commited suicide.And other cases of abuse<br/>
and murder among people who homeschool. Supposedly it&#39;s to enforce tougher<br/>
laws concerning the homeschooling communities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252954655">In case you&#39;re interested in responding to tonight&#39;s show, you might <br/>
get some ideas off the National Home Education Network website. Some NC <br/>
homeschoolers who were dealing with the task force asked NHEN to help <br/>
by pulling together some information.<br/>

I would like for you to read for a week or two before you post, so that you <br/>
get a better feel for the list and for who&#39;s who and what&#39;s what.<br/>

well.  Here&#39;s one comment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Argh.  Thanks for the heads-up, xxxxx.  I read the above paragraph from<br/>
the website to my (20 year old unschooled daughter), who sighed and said: <br/>
&quot;...culture of fear&quot;.<br/>
(Michael Moore&#39;s basic thesis in Bowling for Columbine.)<br/>
