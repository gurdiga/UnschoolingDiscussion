<div id="ygrps-yiv-693758404">We manage a fairly high volume of e-mail here daily, using<br/>
Outlook Express.  I find that digests are only useful to me for<br/>
announcement type lists.<br/>
<br/>
What we do - and you may be able to adapt - is to create a folder<br/>
for different types of messages.  All of unschooling goes into<br/>
one folder.  If there are a bunch of messages in that folder, I<br/>
select &quot;group by conversation&quot; and then poke a little way into<br/>
the conversation.  If it interests me, I will read it.  If not,<br/>
collapse the conversation back into one entry and delete in one<br/>
click.  Digest lists go into folders according to interest area.<br/>
When I have time for the interest, I go to that folder.  Business<br/>
and web site stuff goes into folders for each.  You have to play<br/>
with the message rules and the order in which they are applied<br/>
sometimes, but it keeps the high volume from becoming a time<br/>
sink.<br/>
<br/>
I have used the same general method with several different e-mail<br/>
programs and while the terms used may vary, the approach of<br/>
sorting before seeing works like a charm in all of them I have<br/>
used.<br/>

being sent, but I guess there isn&#39;t.  No biggie, I&#39;ll deal.<br/>
