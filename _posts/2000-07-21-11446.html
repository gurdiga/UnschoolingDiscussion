<div id="ygrps-yiv-648885750">Here&#39;s an invitation to consider joining a new Egroup called &quot;Homeschoolers<br/>
International.  You can find it at::<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The purpose of this list is to foster contact between homeschooling parents<br/>
around the world.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, it will be a place where parents can share experiences, talk about<br/>
their homeschooling challenges and triumphs, and discuss other subjects like<br/>
family outings, books, dealing with extended family members who object to<br/>
homeschooling, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Many homeschooling families love to travel.  The more we can learn about<br/>
where you&#39;re from, your city, region, and country, the better.  That sort of<br/>
information is what I personally hope to glean from this list.<br/>
<br/>
While I realize I&#39;m discriminating against non-native English speakers, I<br/>
have no choice but to make English the language used in this forum.  Please<br/>
forgive me for that.  We welcome all, even those of you who feel inadequate<br/>
when it comes to writing messages in English.  We promise to be considerate,<br/>
and patient.  Perhaps your efforts will motivate some of us native speakers<br/>
of English to learn another language ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Regular participation in this forum should reward us with a broader<br/>
perspective of the homeschooling movement, a deeper sense of connectedness<br/>
with people from around the world, and perhaps a few new friends.<br/>
<br/>
No spam.  No chain letters.  No discussion of politics or religion.<br/>
Open-mindedness, respect of other&#39;s beliefs and customs, and a listening ear<br/>
are all mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
My goal is to create a fun and supportive group with a lot of interesting<br/>
people.  If you would like to see that as well, you&#39;ve come to the right<br/>
place.<br/>
