<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015336453"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Didn&#39;t I see that Prince Charles would<br/>
&gt; leave England if Fox hunting is banned? ;o)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Considering the number of people who don&#39;t seem to like him, I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
surprised to see a push for a fox hunting ban merely to get rid of the man!<br/>
In fact, I&#39;m surprised he would make it that easy!<br/>
