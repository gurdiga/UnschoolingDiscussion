<div id="ygrps-yiv-262838982">I always had cool hoppy names for my imaginary kids.  In Jr. hi we had flour <br/>
sack babies (Ok I wasn&#39;t actually in the class but thought it was a cool <br/>
assignment so I did it with my friends who were in that class :) )  My <br/>
boyfriend and I had two flour sack babies named Onyx and Obsidian.<br/>
<br/>
Another boyfriend and I had a &#39;plant baby&#39; (a jade plant that we <br/>
co-parented) named Lucidity.  We treated her like a real baby (Ok, I was an <br/>
odd kid I know).<br/>
<br/>
In highschool I went with hippy/element names.  There was Oshen Rane (ocean <br/>
rain -water baby) Aurora Sky Dawn (air baby), Ember Ashe (fire baby) And <br/>
Kanyon Terra (earth baby).<br/>
<br/>
In college I really wanted a little blond baby girl named Lettuce.  People <br/>
still speak of Lettuce.  I still think it&#39;s a cool name.<br/>
<br/>
My college boyfriend and I named our imaginary children Dharma (before the <br/>
show), Kellen Alisabeth, and the twins Zot and Zoe.  He was also a big Pink <br/>
Floyd fan and Liked the name Pink.  As well as the lead singer guys name <br/>
(which I can&#39;t remember).<br/>
<br/>
So then I married my husband and he loved names like Agustus and Americanus. <br/>
    He likes names from Roman Generals which didn&#39;t mesh so well with my <br/>
earthy hippy far out names.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up with Kathrynn and Aiden.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Where I work we get some weird named kids...<br/>
<br/>
Silver and Orion are sister and brother.<br/>
<br/>
As are Serenity and Winter.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a Harleigh (Harley, girl) and her brother Andrue (which is <br/>
normal I know but I had never seen it spelled that way)<br/>
<br/>
Looking up names with a friend the other day we came across the name Saran.  <br/>
Which is really pretty if it weren&#39;t for Saran Wrap!  :)<br/>
<br/>
So in list format here they are...<br/>
<br/>
Onyx<br/>
Obsidian<br/>
Lucidity<br/>
Oshen Rane<br/>
Aurora Sky Dawn<br/>
Ember Ashe<br/>
Kanyon Terra<br/>
Lettuce<br/>
Dharma<br/>
Zot<br/>
Zoe<br/>
Kellen<br/>
Silver<br/>
Orion<br/>
Winter (or quads w/Summer, Autumn, and Spring :) )<br/>
Serenity<br/>
Harleigh<br/>
Andrue<br/>
Saran<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I once heard a story (urban legend?) about a foreign woman who came to <br/>
America and had a baby but didn&#39;t know English.  She was so greatful to the <br/>
doctors who helped her that she decided to name her baby that beautiful word <br/>
she had over heard at the hospital.  Vagina.  Probably not a true story.  <br/>
But fun to giggle about when you&#39;re 12.  :)  I have always thought the name <br/>
Vulva would be pretty.  Of course that would take Guts!!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
My highschool Biology teacher dared us all to name a baby girl Aminita <br/>
(Amanita?  Deadly Nightshade.)  As far as I know no one has.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stop now!  :)<br/>

as a joke. Her mother didn&#39;t get it.<br/>
