OK , admittedly, that was natter.  <br/>
<br/>
Here some stuff of substance.  <br/>
<br/>
Landon got his first car yesterday!   He bought it ( with a loan from his <br/>
Grandpa) from my sister.  He has been working about 35 hours a week this summer.  <br/>
  Anna has also been working on the farm about 12 hours a week.  She has <br/>
saved up quite a good chunk of money.  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, does any of that have to do with unschooling?  Hmm, let me see,. <br/>
Anna has learned a lot on the farm about trees ( how to trim different kinds, <br/>
how to identify different kinds) animal habitats ( bees nests, snake holes, <br/>
mouse nests,  etc), safety around heavy equipment,.   She has learned how to keep <br/>
track of her hours and figure her salary.  She has learned how difficult it <br/>
is to work for her Grandpa.. and also how fun it is to work for her Grandpa...( <br/>
yes, a real dichotomy).   Gosh, I am sure she has learned probably a lot more <br/>
than I am aware.<br/>
<br/>
Ethan helps on the farm occasionally, picking up roots, rocks or pulling <br/>
weeds.  He needs constant supervision though.. If  someone  is not nearby  to <br/>
remind him, he will stop working and just zone out.  He likes making the money, <br/>
but he often forgets  Grandpa won&#39;t pay him for sitting on a rock.   As long as <br/>
someone else is there working with him, he&#39;s fine.   But  you can&#39;t give him a <br/>
job and just leave him to do it.  He just got a new gameboy advance and he <br/>
wants some new games, so his motivation for working is pretty high right now.   <br/>
He has also learned how to figure his salary so he knows exactly how many <br/>
hours he needs to work to get his new game.  <br/>
<br/>
JP is still going to karate 3 times a week.. He is testing for his yellow <br/>
belt next Saturday. He is very excited!.  <br/>
<br/>
We are getting the puppies ready to find new homes next week.  They are <br/>
growing beautifully.  They got thier 2nd dose of worm medicine today and they are <br/>
getting their shots next week.   We have all learned a lot about puppies with <br/>
this litter.  <br/>
<br/>
Thats our unschooling life update.<br/>
