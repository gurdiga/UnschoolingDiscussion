<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357703915">I know the food post was a little while ago but wanted to share something.<br/>
<br/>
We went out to eat at Olive Garden last night and the boys got this activity <br/>
sheet/menu to do while we waited.  It had a cross word puzzle on it and we <br/>
were doing it.  I was reading the questions and the boys were answering.  <br/>
Questions like &quot;Spaghetti is a _________.&quot;  Well, the last question was &quot;Clean your <br/>
__________.&quot;  My boys had no idea what that could be that would deal with food. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I gave them the answer then looked at Jackson, we were both brought up <br/>
hearing that phrase every day.  I am so glad my boys have never heard it.<br/>
