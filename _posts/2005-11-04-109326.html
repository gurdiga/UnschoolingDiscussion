Ringer&#39;s Secret School of Writing - my oldest daughter did this and  <br/>
absolutely LOVED it. Ted Ringer studied with Natalie Goldberg, author  <br/>
of &quot;Writing Down the Bones,&quot; the BEST creative writing book ever!<br/>
<br/>
You can try a lesson on the website, for free. We paid for it and it  <br/>
was money well spent!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; computor animation and game making<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s something I posted a while ago. Sorry for the goofy formating.  <br/>
I copied it from Unschooling.info message boards.<br/>
<br/>
The Cartoon Smart website also has some Quicktime tutorials (some  <br/>
free ones to download and if you like those more to buy) on how to  <br/>
animate using Flash.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stagecast.com/&quot;]">http://www.stagecast.com/&quot;]</a>Stagecast Creator[/url] is a good  <br/>
&gt; place to start. He can start making games immediately by just  <br/>
&gt; moving objects around the screen and the program writes the code  <br/>
&gt; for him. But the code is editable so he can start tinkering with it  <br/>
&gt; at any time. They have some really great tutorials that will get  <br/>
&gt; him started quickly. There&#39;s a demo version that limits you to just  <br/>
&gt; a few objects. And, no, he won&#39;t need to know math to program [;)]  <br/>
&gt; But he&#39;ll pick it up as he goes along! [:D]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And something I just found out is that you can write games in  <br/>
&gt; Flash. The great thing about Flash is that he can put his games up  <br/>
&gt; on the internet and let his friends play [:)] (Flash also does  <br/>
&gt; animation among other things.) Macromedia offers a [i]generous[/i]  <br/>
&gt; discount for educators (including homeschoolers). (It&#39;s $99 at the  <br/>
&gt; [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-">http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-</a> <br/>
&gt; EDU&quot;]Education Store[/url]) (It says homeschoolers qualify at their  <br/>
&gt; discretion. If they turn you down I found this list of academic  <br/>
&gt; discounters at Adobe that sell their software (among other things):  <br/>
&gt; [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.academic-collegiate.com/products.htm&quot;]">https://www.academic-collegiate.com/products.htm&quot;]</a>Academic &  <br/>
&gt; Collegiate Software[/url]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, if he thinks he might be interested in doing webpages, you  <br/>
&gt; might give serious consideration to the suite of programs (Studio  <br/>
&gt; MX 2004 for $100 more) that includes Dreamweaver (for creating  <br/>
&gt; webpages), Flash and 2 art programs. (We&#39;ve both used Fireworks a  <br/>
&gt; lot for drawing.) (Without the educator&#39;s discount it&#39;s like $600 [: <br/>
&gt; 0]) Most of the big internet service providers (AOL, Earthlink and  <br/>
&gt; such) have walkthroughs to put up simple webpages so Dreamweaver  <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t necessary but it is nice if he has the urge for less generic  <br/>
&gt; [:)]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are [i]loads[/i] of tutorials about Flash on the internet. A  <br/>
&gt; good beginning might be the Quicktime videos at [url=&quot;http:// <br/>
&gt; www.cartoonsmart.com/&quot;]Cartoon Smart[/url]. Scroll down to the  <br/>
&gt; bottom and there&#39;s one for Video Games. The freebies we  <br/>
&gt; downloaded ... well he didn&#39;t edit out his &quot;Oops, didn&#39;t mean to do  <br/>
&gt; that&quot;s [;)] but they were very easy to use. You just run Flash and  <br/>
&gt; Quicktime at the same time and follow along with what he does. You  <br/>
&gt; can pause and back up just like with a video.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve also heard good things about [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/">http://www.ambrosiasw.com/</a> <br/>
&gt; games/coldstone/&quot;]Coldstone Game Engine[/url] for developing RPGs.  <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a demo version at the website to download. I don&#39;t have any  <br/>
&gt; personal experience with it though. If you type Coldstone and  <br/>
&gt; review into Google, that should turn some information up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (For non-Macophiles, as far as I know the above are all available  <br/>
&gt; for Windoze too. There&#39;s also Dark Basic that I&#39;ve heard really  <br/>
&gt; good things about and for which there&#39;s a ton of support and  <br/>
&gt; tutorials. And my daughter took a 2 week full day course at  <br/>
&gt; [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://video-game.internaldrive.com/&quot;]">http://video-game.internaldrive.com/&quot;]</a>ID Tech Camps[/url]  <br/>
&gt; where they used [url=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clickteam.com/English/">http://www.clickteam.com/English/</a> <br/>
&gt; multimedia_fusion.htm&quot;]Multimedia Fusion[/url] which she really  <br/>
&gt; liked. (The camp used the standard version at the time. There are  <br/>
&gt; free trials at the website.) She also liked the camp but they were  <br/>
&gt; a bit pricey.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594943024">I was talking to an acquaintance who designs websites and does a lot of work<br/>
with graphics about Flash software for animation.  She recommended something<br/>
called Swish.  She said it does the same things as flash but is much easier<br/>
to use and cheaper.  Has anyone used this?<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
