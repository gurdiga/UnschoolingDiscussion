<div id="ygrps-yiv-58329869">Google is working on making books searchable on line.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can search the full text of the books they&#39;ve scanned in so far.  <br/>
Obviously not all books are scanned yet but if you search for  <br/>
unschooling 245 books turn up which is a more than I would have  <br/>
expected to show up if they were all on line.<br/>
<br/>
For books still copyrighted you can see a few pages around your  <br/>
search term and I guess you&#39;re limited to a certain number of page  <br/>
views since it&#39;s intended as a search feature so you can find books  <br/>
you didn&#39;t know about rather than a place to read books on line.  <br/>
(Though, like the Gutenberg project you can read books that aren&#39;t  <br/>
copyrighted.) There are links to places you can buy it on line and  <br/>
eventually to local libraries that have it.<br/>
