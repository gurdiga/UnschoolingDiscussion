&gt; Of course you have the right to set the rules in your own home.  I think I <br/>
&gt; would have said it out of the child&#39;s earshot, but as you say, you didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; really <br/>
&gt; have time to think this out in advance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spanked children NEED to hear that not everybody spanks. Hopefully that child <br/>
can take what he learned from Joylyn and use it when he becomes a parent and <br/>
stop future abuse of children.<br/>

&gt; IMHO, that is basically the same thing I did when I smacked my son at the <br/>
&gt; bus <br/>
&gt; stop.  It would NOT have worked if I went around doing it all the time, but <br/>
&gt; because it was so rare and unexpected, it did work.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So here are two women raising children. Both think it&#39;s OK to go around <br/>
smacking others.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what kind of adults/parents the children will become.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This list is the same way. No groundings, no spanking, no taking things away <br/>
from children, no shaming, no punishments. We treat children as humans, NOT as <br/>
grubs waiting to become humans.<br/>

It&#39;s a little harder than punishments, but MUCH more effective---and <br/>
joyful---in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
You can LEARN here or you can let it go in one ear and out the other. You DO <br/>
have a choice. People here can help you see it if you WANT to.<br/>

of situations.  I got the living crap beat out of me almost daily, I&#39;m a <br/>
pretty well adjusted loving, kind person.  Could my life have been more pleasant?  <br/>
Oh yes, and I wish it had been.  Did it make me a wicked terrible burden to <br/>
society?  Nope, maybe in spite of our upbringings we will be what we are <br/>
innately supposed to be.  Makes life more pleasant for the child growing up for sure <br/>
but we can&#39;t condemn children to be something horrible because of a spanking <br/>
as a child.  I think that is simply ridiculous.  Your honor, this fine young <br/>
man killed 18 people but it was because he was spanked as a child and it&#39;s not <br/>
his fault... bull!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I don&#39;t spank and wouldn&#39;t spank.<br/>

that can make good outcomes more assured.<br/>

Why would anyone advocate practices that make bad outcomes more likely?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you&#39;re advocating that as a philosophy?<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s all a crap shoot then we might as well shut the list down.<br/>
<br/>
We *can* understand what can encourage bad outcomes. And we *can* understand<br/>
what can encourage good outcomes. That&#39;s why we discuss things here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one has said it would. But hitting can cause psychological harm. There<br/>
are other effective ways that don&#39;t. So why hit?<br/>

long run?<br/>
<br/>
There is some support for that point of view - a controversial study <br/>
published by a psychologist that came out a few years ago strongly <br/>
supports it. Judith Rich Harris, The Nurture Assumption.<br/>
