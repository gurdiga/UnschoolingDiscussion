I understand where you are coming from and I partly agree.  I think <br/>
that a four year old is capapble of understanding fiction vs. reality <br/>
and death.<br/>
But I agree that if a parent can&#39;t figure out how to explain it, she <br/>
should avoid exposing her child to it.  I like the traffic analogy.  I <br/>
am also very concerned about the gun aspect.  If a child sees these <br/>
movies with no input from parents and then finds a gun at a relatives <br/>
house, he may point and shoot it because he thinks the person will get <br/>
right back up.  So I think it is very important to get that &#39;guns are <br/>
not benign things&#39; through as soon as the child starts to be <br/>
interested in them.<br/>

<br/>
A person who isn&#39;t good at interpersonals will have a hard time with such <br/>
things, and sometimes a young child is in a family with lots of older kids or <br/>
adults and can&#39;t live the same happy, sheltered Raffi-music life a firstborn <br/>
child of analytical liberal parents might.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s experience of the world with two older brothers can&#39;t be undone.  <br/>
Kirby&#39;s experience surrounded by other kids his age (mostly girls) of La <br/>
Leche League hippie parents at the same age was much quieter and more flowery <br/>
and peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
Insulting a big group because of the freely offered answers to one question <br/>
isn&#39;t the answer.   Most people focussed on the guns part of the question.  <br/>
So?  Answer the other parts!  <br/>
<br/>
But for me, censoring all input isn&#39;t the answer.  I&#39;d rather be there and <br/>
discuss.  But I have never purposely exposed a child to something scary or <br/>
offensive just to engender discussion opportunities.  Mine saw Rocky Horror <br/>
Picture Show (video) when they were little, but they could always get out of <br/>
the room, and they saw it for the goofy alien-nonsense rock and roll humor <br/>
that it was.  And the sex stuff they didn&#39;t pay any attention to because it <br/>
meant nothing to them.<br/>
<br/>
Had I hidden it or forbidden it, they might be studying it in secret today, <br/>
but they can sing some of the songs and not see it as an important or <br/>
powerful or frightening thing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I just can&#39;t see treating a four year old as you would an adult when it <br/>
comes to choosing what they watch. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t choose materials for adults to watch, so I&#39;m thinking your statement <br/>
wasn&#39;t worded the way you meant for it to be.   I don&#39;t choose what my <br/>
children watch, either, but I always gave them options.  And NO, the options <br/>
weren&#39;t &quot;Would you rather watch a Disney Singalong or Terminator II?&quot;  <br/>
Nothing like that.  But if at one end is &quot;treating them like an adult&quot; and <br/>
the other end is &quot;choosing what they watch,&quot;  I&#39;m way in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t treat a four year old with any respect or freedom (to rephrase, <br/>
probably unfairly) then how differently will you treat a six year old?  <br/>
Eight?  Ten?  Twelve?  At which point DO you let them make free choice?  Many <br/>
parents say &quot;When they prove they can make good choices,&quot; but that&#39;s like <br/>
saying I&#39;ll let him take driver&#39;s ed after he proves he can drive safely.  <br/>
Without choice, kids can&#39;t practice making choices.  <br/>
<br/>
I have three kids now 10 to 15.  None of them ever for a minute stared at a <br/>
scary scene against their will.  None of them sought out disturbing movies.  <br/>
They watched things they liked.  LOTS of cartoons and musicals.  Pirates of <br/>
Penzance was a favorite.  For a while Holly watched Stand By Me every day, <br/>
sometimes twice.  She was little, maybe four.  Marty said I shouldn&#39;t let <br/>
her.  He was six or seven.  I said if she&#39;s liking it for some reason, let <br/>
her watch it.  She liked the music and the scary parts (leeches, running <br/>
across a trestle with the train coming).  She liked the voices of the actors. <br/>
 She liked the scenery.  It didn&#39;t hurt her.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  Am I the only one who feels this way about this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
600+ members aren&#39;t all gonig to register their feelings in full with you.  I <br/>
doubt you&#39;re the only one who feels that way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I cannot believe that a four year old can reason that well as to draw a <br/>
line between what they&#39;re watching and what&#39;s real or make-believe?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean you haven&#39;t had four year olds?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But I think we have to use some COMMON SENSE in raising our children!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, experienced and successful unschoolers are using more <br/>
common sense than any other group of parents I&#39;ve ever known.  Unfortunately <br/>
in our culture, &quot;common sense&quot; is often the label put on treating children <br/>
practically as an enemy species, and putting them in institutions outside the <br/>
home for at least half a year if not more.  Boarding schools are considered <br/>
to be things GOOD parents sacrifice to provide, etc.  When using &quot;common <br/>
sense&quot; as a banner, please look carefully at both sides of that flag.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511480451">Hi, Betty!<br/>
<br/>
My impression is that this is not a black-and-white issue, but there are a <br/>
lot of gray areas.  The way I see it now that I have examined the issue <br/>
more closely in our own home is that I trust my son and I know who he <br/>
is.  He is a gentle boy who takes the trouble to avoid accidentally <br/>
stepping on bugs outside, shows extreme compassion to me and animals and <br/>
his friends, has never (even as a toddler) hit anyone, and is fascinated <br/>
with guns and lasers and weapons in general.  What is that?  I&#39;m beginning <br/>
to believe it is some biological urge boys have, but whatever it is I <br/>
cannot deny it and I cannot make it go away by pretending he doesn&#39;t like <br/>
guns, etc., and wishing he were more like me.   For years I would not <br/>
*allow* toy guns in the house, but  sword were okay.  I told him that <br/>
swords and knifes could also be useful tools (cutting an apple on a hike, <br/>
etc.) but that there were no good uses for guns, which were only meant to <br/>
kill animals and people.  Well, he heard me, but that did not change his <br/>
urges or his fascinations.  I have lifted the weapons ban at home, and Liam <br/>
is as happy as ever, and is still a gentle, loving boy.<br/>
<br/>
I was running the risk of making Liam feel badly for this natural urge he <br/>
was feeling.  And, I ran the risk of alienating him.  Again, this was not <br/>
the desired effect I had in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I think that when you have an open, honest relationship with your kids, you <br/>
can talk about ANYTHING, and they will know you are speaking from an honest <br/>
place.  Kids really appreciate our honesty and frankness and trust.  I <br/>
appreciate it when people approach me in that way.  It shows me that I am <br/>
respected for my intelligence and ability to handle things.  When someone <br/>
shows me that they think I can handle stuff, it behooves me to rise to the <br/>
occasion.  But, it&#39;s not all or nothing.  You don&#39;t have to sit a <br/>
4-year-old in front of Die Hard.  Neither do you have to sequester them <br/>
from our world.  There&#39;s a middle ground.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this makes sense!  I&#39;ve been awake for too many hours this week!<br/>

I totally agree with you when you put it like that.  I&#39;m all for unschooling<br/>
and trying our best to let the children do what they want *except* when it<br/>
comes to safety issues.<br/>

appropriate to *this* situation. But that answer can&#39;t be extrapolated to<br/>
every family with a 4 yo. Nor is the &quot;no violent games or movies&quot; the answer<br/>
to every family with a 4 yo. Every family situation is different and the<br/>
answer is to look at the situation objectively and make decisions that are<br/>
appropriate to that particular situation, rather than grasping at a one size<br/>
fits all decision.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing these games are being played by the older kids in the family<br/>
and the boy is drawn to them. Forbidding him from interacting with his<br/>
brothers while they get to play would just make whatever is attracting him<br/>
all the more enticing. Talking to him and answering his questions will help<br/>
satisfy his curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would you first explain to him what the possibilities are of getting himself<br/>
&gt; run over and how dangerous it is and then let him do it and hope for the best<br/>
&gt; JUST because that what he &#39;s interested in??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is violence so attractive that it will negate the more positive messages of<br/>
a loving and caring home life?<br/>
<br/>
What *are* the consequences you&#39;re imagining will happen to a 4 yo by<br/>
watching self chosen violent movies in a loving home? It&#39;s when we base our<br/>
decisions on &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know but why take chances?&quot; -- and when avoiding<br/>
those chances have for more likely negative consequences -- that we aren&#39;t<br/>
using common sense.<br/>
<br/>
I think the possibilities of a 4 yo seeing how attractive guns on video<br/>
games and movies are and picking up and using a real one are vanishingly<br/>
small. *But* again, that&#39;s where common sense comes in. If you live in the<br/>
middle of PA where every other person has a gun rack on the back of his or<br/>
her truck and you routinely allow your 4 yo child to play unsupervised at<br/>
other people&#39;s homes is it common sense *not* to think that there&#39;s a<br/>
possibility of him running into a gun just become someone you don&#39;t know<br/>
never suggested that possibility?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-458351500">Hi Margi, Betty and everyone here on Unschooling-dotcom,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined the group a couple of days ago.  What a great group!  Got me<br/>
thinking deeply about things already.  The Blood and gore posts seem to be<br/>
ones I&#39;ll have to think more about.  Most of the time I agree with all of<br/>
the unschooling ideas and so it&#39;s easy to just keep going along.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Joyce.  I see one of the moderators is a Joyce so I&#39;ll be Joyce K<br/>
unless someone already claims that.  Our family is made up of me, my<br/>
husband, ds 7 and dd 5.  This is our first official year of HE.  I&#39;m just<br/>
starting to &#39;get&#39; unschooling and hope that I can do this with my children<br/>
without going crazy.  &lt;g&gt;   I think the reason I feel like I&#39;m getting<br/>
unschooling now is that I joined the TCS list not so long ago and can<br/>
finally get them too.   :)<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Betty!<br/>
<br/>
My impression is that this is not a black-and-white issue, but there are a<br/>
lot of gray areas.  The way I see it now that I have examined the issue<br/>
more closely in our own home is that I trust my son and I know who he<br/>
is.  He is a gentle boy who takes the trouble to avoid accidentally<br/>
stepping on bugs outside, shows extreme compassion to me and animals and<br/>
his friends, has never (even as a toddler) hit anyone, and is fascinated<br/>
with guns and lasers and weapons in general.  What is that?  I&#39;m beginning<br/>
to believe it is some biological urge boys have, but whatever it is I<br/>
cannot deny it and I cannot make it go away by pretending he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
guns, etc., and wishing he were more like me.   For years I would not<br/>
*allow* toy guns in the house, but  sword were okay.  I told him that<br/>
swords and knifes could also be useful tools (cutting an apple on a hike,<br/>
etc.) but that there were no good uses for guns, which were only meant to<br/>
kill animals and people.  Well, he heard me, but that did not change his<br/>
urges or his fascinations.  I have lifted the weapons ban at home, and Liam<br/>
is as happy as ever, and is still a gentle, loving boy.<br/>
<br/>
I was running the risk of making Liam feel badly for this natural urge he<br/>
was feeling.  And, I ran the risk of alienating him.  Again, this was not<br/>
the desired effect I had in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I think that when you have an open, honest relationship with your kids, you<br/>
can talk about ANYTHING, and they will know you are speaking from an honest<br/>
place.  Kids really appreciate our honesty and frankness and trust.  I<br/>
appreciate it when people approach me in that way.  It shows me that I am<br/>
respected for my intelligence and ability to handle things.  When someone<br/>
shows me that they think I can handle stuff, it behooves me to rise to the<br/>
occasion.  But, it&#39;s not all or nothing.  You don&#39;t have to sit a<br/>
4-year-old in front of Die Hard.  Neither do you have to sequester them<br/>
from our world.  There&#39;s a middle ground.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this makes sense!  I&#39;ve been awake for too many hours this week!<br/>

&gt;   Now come on folks, just because a four year old wants to do something,<br/>

&gt; we just let them watch it and hope for the best ?<br/>
&gt;   Sorry, but even the  movie and video makers try to set limits on how<br/>

&gt;   As for teaching them about guns, IMO, that is something that should be<br/>
&gt; taught REALISTICALLY, NOT explained because they&#39;re exposed a violent<br/>
&gt; movie!  Movies nowadays (and video games) use guns to blow away anybody<br/>
&gt; that gets in the way.  HOW can you let a small child watch things like<br/>
&gt; this and then try to explain to them the dangers of guns??????   They<br/>
&gt; think they&#39;re for the purpose of blowing people away, if that&#39;s what<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re first impressions of gun use is.  You might talk your head off<br/>
&gt; but as long as they sit and watch what guns are used for what are they<br/>
&gt; going to believe??  So you sit and tell them that it isn&#39;t real this is<br/>
&gt; MAKE-BELIEVE??  But in these movies these are real people and real guns<br/>
&gt; that they&#39;re seeing and I cannot believe that a four year old can reason<br/>

He liked Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and lots of &quot;boy&quot; type things. But<br/>
when my daughter shared Gundam Wing with him -- which is chock full of<br/>
weapons fire and blowing things up -- he chose the angst ridden peace loving<br/>
character who was forced to fight as his favorite.<br/>
<br/>
People are drawn to internalize violence as a good thing for a reason, not<br/>
just because they see it. In homes where there&#39;s a barrier between parents<br/>
and kids, or where kids feel powerless in a family that rewards power (the<br/>
parents are dictators and the kids jump when they say jump) then they&#39;re<br/>
going to be attracted to the types of things that will give them power.<br/>

It *is* common sense to judge that something you don&#39;t have time to explain<br/>

to base advice or future judgements on a special circumstance. Common sense<br/>
to me is recognizing that extenuating circumstances need to be taken into<br/>
account when applying general rules drawn from real experiences, but that<br/>
real experience overrides imagined consequences.<br/>

&gt; away anybody that gets in the way.  HOW can you let a small child <br/>
&gt; watch things like this and then try to explain to them the dangers <br/>
&gt; of guns??????   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When  Rain (Cacie) was 3 and 4 I owned a gun, I dated a guy who worked at<br/>
a shooting range, plus I had another good friend who did practical pistol<br/>
every weekend. She was around a lot of guns. She went to the range, she<br/>
saw (and heard) them fired (with eye and ear protection on, of course),<br/>
and I think we even shot up a watermelon with her. I had a target I&#39;d<br/>
shot hanging on ther back of my bedroom door. She knew what guns did. To<br/>
this day, I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;d never point a gun at anyone unless she<br/>
meant to kill them, since that was the rule everyone followed. She had<br/>
toy guns, of course, but those were different, it was pretty easy to tell<br/>
the difference. We showed her our guns, took them apart, let her hold<br/>
them, talked about how a gun could look unloaded but there could be a<br/>
bullet in the chamber... she really did get all this. I truly think a<br/>
shooting range or a practical pistol competition can be a great trip for<br/>
a little kid... the people there are very serious about gun safety, they<br/>
really respect the power of their firearms.<br/>
<br/>
Rain also watched &quot;blood and gore&quot; movies when she was little...<br/>
Dragonheart and Jurassic Park at 2 or 3, Star Wars, all that stuff. I<br/>
remember playing &quot;making a movie&quot; with her when she was 3. We&#39;d act out a<br/>
scene together, usually involving violence or death, and then yell &quot;Cut!&quot;<br/>
and whoever was dead or injured would jump up and we&#39;d high-five each<br/>
other and say &quot;Great job!&quot;. It was pretend...<br/>
<br/>
When she was 5 I got a scanner, and we scanned in all sorts of photos and<br/>
cut and pasted and did weird things, like showing her riding a giant cat.<br/>
Even back then we talked about how the movie&#39;s special effects might have<br/>
been created, just throwing out ideas...<br/>
<br/>
Rain&#39;s nephew came out to visit us a year ago, when he was 2 1/2, and he<br/>
loved to watch our Jurassic Park and Land of the Lost videos... &quot;Watcha<br/>
dinosaur movie?&quot; was his big line. His mom (Rain&#39;s sister) said they<br/>
owned the Making of Jurassic Park video, and the first time he saw that<br/>
he was just enthralled...<br/>
<br/>
Dar<br/>
They think they&#39;re for the purpose of blowing people <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; away, if that&#39;s what they&#39;re first impressions of gun use is.  You <br/>
&gt; might talk your head off but as long as they sit and watch what guns <br/>
&gt; are used for what are they going to believe??  So you sit and tell <br/>
&gt; them that it isn&#39;t real this is MAKE-BELIEVE??  But in these movies <br/>
&gt; these are real people and real guns that they&#39;re seeing and I cannot <br/>
&gt; believe that a four year old can reason that well as to draw a line <br/>
&gt; between what they&#39;re watching and what&#39;s real or make-believe?<br/>
&gt;   I don&#39;t mean to be sarcastic or offensive if I come off sounding <br/>
&gt; that way, I apologize.  But I think we have to use some COMMON SENSE <br/>
&gt; in raising our children!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Insulting a big group because of the freely offered answers to one question isn&#39;t the answer.   Most people focussed on the guns part of the question.  So?  Answer the other parts! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
    I&#39;m sorry if you took offense by my opinions.  I apologize to amyone who has been insulted from my opinions. That was not my intentions. BTW Sandra,I did answer BOTH of her questions IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;common sense than any other group of parents I&#39;ve ever known.  Unfortunately <br/>
  in our culture, &quot;common sense&quot; is often the label &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I guess the issue here is HOW we as individuals define the phrase COMMON SENSE.  My difinition is apparently different from your and probably a lot of other people&#39;s.  But it&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to go on.  I try to (IHMO) to do the very best I can for my child even if sometimes he doesn&#39;t get to watch or do everything he wants.  My theory is  (IMHO) sometimes he&#39;s affected in a more POSITIVE way when I say NO than when he&#39;s allowed to do something that is going to take a lot of explaining from me for him to understand  that maybe I didn&#39;t fully approve of at the beginning and had reservations about letting him do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233731556"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;If a child sees these  movies with no input from parents and then finds a <br/>
&gt;&gt;gun at a relatives  house, he may point and shoot it because he thinks the <br/>
&gt;&gt;person will get right back up.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My nephew had not been exposed to violent movies before he shot himself. <br/>
(This was back in the 70&#39;s.) He was 2 1/2 and being babysat with his one <br/>
year old brother at a neighbor&#39;s house. He woke up early and got into a <br/>
drawer that was supposed to be locked. He shot himself in the stomach. <br/>
Amazingly, he survived.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we can blame gun interest or gun accidents or violence in <br/>
children on exposure to movie scenes. It&#39;s a much more complex phenomenom.<br/>

if someone had been playing but put their gun down for some reason, he was <br/>
temporarily out of the game.<br/>
