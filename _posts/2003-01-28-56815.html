<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An old college boyfriend and I had this discussion on late into one evening. <br/>
This was before I got my &quot;potty mouth&quot;. It might have been what changed my <br/>
view of words---whether they are bad and all. They&#39;re just words. My roommate <br/>
lived on the Caloosahatchie River. We joked that Caloosahatchie could just <br/>
have easily have been decided by the English-speaking-world to be the word <br/>
for &quot;shit&quot;. Why did Shit get to be shit? So we started using Caloosahatchie <br/>
instead of shit. Or Caloo for short. We changed a lot of words that night, <br/>
but Caloo is the only one I remember.<br/>
<br/>
We also talked about folks&#39; reactions to words and how anger/meanness could <br/>
be the reason for most &quot;definitions&quot;. Or maybe connotations.<br/>
<br/>
Bitch is an everyday word here (I&#39;m a dog show nut)---so my boys didn&#39;t know <br/>
it shouldn&#39;t be used in polite society. &lt;G&gt; &quot;This is Soda Pop, our dog, and <br/>
Basia, our bitch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no doubt that words are powerful. As someone said earlier---look what <br/>
just happened here. <br/>
<br/>
And conference attendees will never forget &quot;LOWING&quot;! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone&#39;s Granny can say something---or a two year old!---and we can&#39;t help <br/>
but snigger. What is it that makes the same wods coming out of an adult&#39;s <br/>
mouth NOT funny?<br/>
<br/>
I DO love words---how they got here, where they&#39;re going. The word pregnant <br/>
was banned on TV for YEARS. Now we have gay Will trying to impregnate Grace. <br/>
Go figure! The evolution of words is fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
Who KNOWS what will be the &quot;four-letter&quot; words 50-100 years from now. SO cool <br/>
to speculate.  (and why ARE so many FOUR letters???)<br/>

<br/>
Saxon words are short.  Latin words are long.<br/>
<br/>
Saxon words work like little wooden blocks.  You set them side by side to <br/>
make longer words, generally.   Latin and French work more like <br/>
tinker-toys--you stick stuff onto either end and you can pick the whole thing <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
Indescribable is not a Saxon word.<br/>
<br/>
Bookend is.  Neither &quot;book&quot; nor &quot;end&quot; was harmed in the creation or <br/>
disassembly of that word.<br/>
And neither had more than four letters.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of some long Anglo-Saxon words.<br/>
<br/>
Mother, brother, father, sister.  Those are some of the longest.<br/>
Gold becomes golden.<br/>
There are forms of that for made-of-whatever words:<br/>
brass to brazen<br/>
wood to wooden<br/>
<br/>
iron isn&#39;t ironen, but probably because it already ended like &quot;-en&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The words just tend to be short.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember the statistics because I don&#39;t remember numbers, but <br/>
although English has the highest word count of any language anywhere, it&#39;s <br/>
because we keep terms from several different languages so we can shade our <br/>
meaning with different levels of formality or with connotation.  And of that <br/>
big word count, most of the words are from Latin or French or Greek.<br/>
<br/>
But if you analyze any piece of conversation or writing, most of the words <br/>
used are native Anglo-Saxon words.  So the little words we use every day or <br/>
the connecting words and adjectives of a common day are probably native <br/>
English words.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to do it when you&#39;re writing or speaking yourself, but it&#39;s fun to <br/>
do with song lyrics.  Doo-wop love songs, for instance.  Or with kids&#39; <br/>
nursery rhymes.  It&#39;s possible sometimes to find something that has NO &quot;big <br/>
words,&quot; and no recenh above.  <br/>
(Pretend I put quotation marks around words-as-words; I&#39;m not going to.)<br/>
lyrics and rhymes are from Greek.<br/>
Nursery is from French.  So is possible and recently.<br/>
I think borrow is English but it might be French.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the rest are Old English.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Anna was about 3, she wanted a &quot;horsestick&quot;  ( say it all together like <br/>
one word)..Of course, we bought her a cute little stick horse.. She would <br/>
talk about how she loved her horsestick and she loved to ride and ride it.  <br/>
Dh and I would crack up every time she referred to her beloved toy.    We <br/>
would just always refer to it as her horsey or stick horse.  She eventually <br/>
named it something, but she still often called it her horsestick<br/>
