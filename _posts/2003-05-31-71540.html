 </span></blockquote>From the times I&#39;ve heard him/them speak, and from a couple of <br/>
things I&#39;ve read, I have the impression that Pat is very <br/>
knowledgeable and enthusiastic about unschooling, but his daughters <br/>
happen to be academic oriented and Day supports that by helping them <br/>
meet their goals.  <br/>

I think she said maybe.<br/>
She&#39;s gone to girl scout camp.<br/>
<br/>
Pam really likes the times she&#39;s heard him speak.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not me - I have no idea what goes on in their private lives. <br/>
Unschooling or not - or maybe did when the kids were younger and don&#39;t <br/>
anymore or never did or still do --- I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I was simply surprised to hear that &quot;someone with the last name of F <br/>
who had run GWS&quot; had said those kinds of things - because I&#39;ve never <br/>
heard anything like that from Pat. But - that doesn&#39;t mean I know <br/>
anything about their real lives - one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have to agree that it would be disconcerting to discover that they <br/>
never unschooled. BUT - to be fair - what Pat talks about is learning <br/>
without a curriculum, etc., he is generally talking to audiences filled <br/>
with people who are trying to select the perfect curriculum and he&#39;s <br/>
trying to get them to at least step away from that. Maybe that&#39;s as far <br/>
as they ever went - not using a formal curriculum, but still teaching <br/>
&quot;lessons&quot; etc., of their own mix and match design. I don&#39;t think that <br/>
would be terribly surprising. Whether they are unschooling or not - <br/>
might be subject to interpretation, I guess. And I can tell you that we <br/>
will never all agree fully on a definition.<br/>
<br/>
My kids sometimes do &quot;courses&quot; and stuff like that. Some of you would <br/>
undoubtedly argue that they are no longer unschooling when they sign up <br/>
for an online writing course at &quot;secret school,&quot; for example. I think <br/>
you&#39;re wrong - but I don&#39;t care enough to argue extensively about it.  <br/>
When these things are truly child-chosen (if not initiated) with no <br/>
pressure or compulsion from parents or other adults - I don&#39;t see <br/>
&quot;writing course&quot; as any different than a karate class or soccer team <br/>
membership. I think it is a bias against intellectual pursuits that <br/>
rears its head occasionally among unschoolers. My 12 yo daughter has <br/>
homework - assigned by her 4H club horse leader. She gets tested on it. <br/>
How to help her learn that material is a useful thing for me - she&#39;s <br/>
reading from a manual and will, this next year, be using a <br/>
college-level textbook on equine studies. It is tough stuff and if I <br/>
can learn to help her, that&#39;s a good thing because she LOVES it and <br/>
really really wants to gain the knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
So - again - please don&#39;t say that I think anything, one way or the <br/>
other about whether or not they are unschooling. I don&#39;t even know, for <br/>
SURE, if we are!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is very very very true -- there is thousands of times more <br/>
information at these sources than anywhere else - NO speaker can <br/>
compare to the depth and breadth found here and at www.unschooling.com <br/>
--- for FREE.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes in-person talks are very inspiring though. Sandra&#39;s are so <br/>
energizing it is just amazing. I come away feeling like I&#39;m walking <br/>
around in a warm glow. The stuff I have to say about math is more <br/>
difficult for me to do online - I need to do hands on stuff and I speak <br/>
better when I have real people with expressions on their faces right in <br/>
front of me.<br/>
<br/>
So - I think in-person talks, seminars, workshops, conferences, are <br/>
fantastic and even life-changing at times. Priceless.<br/>
Those who are really great are those who are really trying to &quot;give it <br/>
away&quot; though, imo. So - yeah - I&#39;d beware of high-priced talks, too.<br/>

really going...... have a great weekend!!!</div>

<br/>
I think that until parents can see value in things which don&#39;t look <br/>
schoolish, they need to step away from academic things so they can see.   People&#39;s eyes <br/>
don&#39;t adjust to seeing in the dark until the lights are turned off, and some <br/>
people never do succeed in seeing that writing CAN be learned other ways.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids know that, Pam.  <br/>
<br/>
I know you know I know that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some parents, though, seeing that your kids took writing classes for fun <br/>
might use that to justify pressing writing classes to help their kids be more like <br/>
your kids.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t work, I&#39;m just speaking in defense of what might seem like &quot;bias <br/>
against intellectual pursuits&quot; in helping people get from school-life to a <br/>
life without school.<br/>
