<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774414142">I&#39;ve always been a *Just one bite* parent, and it has worked relatively well <br/>
and without much conflict in this household, although I am learning that I <br/>
wish I&#39;d done it another way, because of this list.  At any rate, my children are <br/>
now 18 and 15, and there&#39;s a lot of water under that particular bridge.<br/>
<br/>
This post is to verify the claim that you CAN teach an old dog new tricks, <br/>
however.<br/>
<br/>
I was making dinner tonight and was preparing the broccoli for the steamer.  <br/>
Dd, 18, is off at college, and Liam, 15, is the only one still here at home.  <br/>
He hates broccoli.<br/>
<br/>
And then I remembered something, with a dull flash, and hustled down the hall <br/>
to ask him a question.<br/>
<br/>
*Liam, would you like some broccoli if I serve it raw with ranch dip?*<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t take his eyes off his game.<br/>
<br/>
*Sure.*<br/>
<br/>
Shit.  &lt;g&gt;  How many meals have I let pass without him gaining any sustenance <br/>
from the broccoli I stubbornly served lightly steamed, just the way he hates <br/>
it, rather than simply and easily holding some back from the pot for him to <br/>
munch on with a little dip?  <br/>
<br/>
How stupid can one mother be?  ;-)<br/>

nobody else in my family does. So I make it sometimes, for myself. Just <br/>
a week or so ago I noticed my 12 yo was putting it on her plate at a <br/>
salad buffet restaurant - and it hit ME that, yep, she likes it - just <br/>
like your son, raw with some ranch dressing dip. I was always so <br/>
irritated that nobody else in my family likes nice hot delicious <br/>
steamed broccoli, that I (stupidly) never thought either of just giving <br/>
it her the way she actually DOES like it. Sheesh!!<br/>

foreheads and say DOH!)<br/>
<br/>
Like when my 12yo sits down and reads the Kenshin<br/>
comic book he got at Christmas in one sitting and I<br/>
realize, &quot;Hey, he CAN read when he wants to!  DOH!&quot;<br/>

dh, and put some raw baby carrots out for Lars. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

that time because I pushed him. He still didn&#39;t *like* to read until about <br/>
this fall (He&#39;s 16 now) when he started asking me for books about various <br/>
science and other topics. Then a couple of weeks ago he asked me if we had <br/>
The Golden Compass, a book I read to him a few years ago. I got it for him, <br/>
and he started reading. Last night it was time for him to leave for his <br/>
sister&#39;s to spend the night before a snowboarding trip. He said, &quot;Just let <br/>
me finish this chapter first.&quot; Music to my ears that I&#39;ve waited so long to <br/>
hear! AND he hugged me before he left, something he&#39;s been mostly allergic <br/>
to since he was 12. Life just keeps getting better.<br/>

second hand. Eventually I&#39;ll also get the first so we&#39;ll have the whole <br/>
series. I loved them too.<br/>
