I have no answer for you unless you&#39;re willing to put in some SERIOUS time <br/>
and effort. Maybe more than you can imagine. It IS possible, but how hard do <br/>
you want to work? Would you rather just keep him away from chickens? That <br/>
would be easier.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476616627">We have 2 dogs and 4 chickens (one of which is a rooster).  The male dog is<br/>
half malamute and half wolf.  He used to chase the chickens and tried to get<br/>
them and then stopped.  Now they treat him like he is their<br/>
father...lol...they sleeep with him and the hole bit.  The other dog is a<br/>
black lab and pit bull female and she doesn&#39;t get it at all.  She loves to<br/>
chase the chickens and the cats.  NOTHING stops her.  She has to be watched<br/>
always.  And she tries to go for blood...sigh.  So I don&#39;t know about the<br/>
addage once a killer always a killer.<br/>

happened several times, the last time it did, I picked up the dead <br/>
chicken took it in the house and emptied a whole bottle of hot <br/>
tabasco sauce on it. Went out and gave it to the dog, he grabbed it <br/>
then dropped it, never chased another chicken again.  ~&gt;Chloe</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-822121900">You should bury about 6-8 inches of the chicken yard fencing in<br/>
the ground to keep out not just dogs, but also foxes, raccoons,<br/>
and other vermin.  We have a neighbor dog who will go after any<br/>
of our chickens that get out, in which case you have to make some<br/>
choices about how seriously to keep the chickens in vs the joy of<br/>
yard birds.  We have achieved a happy ecology by making it semi<br/>
difficult for the hens to fly out, resulting in only the<br/>
brightest (yes they are smarter than you think) chickens doing<br/>
it - they are also bright enough to avoid the dog. It helps that<br/>
we have a collie who enjoys herding the hens  - and will protect<br/>
them from the neighbor dog if need be - though the 2 dogs are<br/>
&quot;best friends&quot; other times.<br/>
