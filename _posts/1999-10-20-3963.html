&gt;<br/>
&gt; He felt science had failed in its mission by not fighting for the expression<br/>
&gt; of the individual; instead, it had put itself at the service of mercenary<br/>
&gt; interests and favored mass production.  The idea of turning out a perfectly<br/>
&gt; finished product, which is the ideal of modern industry, never occurred to<br/>
&gt; him.  He was fond of quoting Pascal&#39;s phrase, &quot;There is only one thing that<br/>
&gt; interests man, and that is man.&quot;&lt;&lt; page 38.<br/>

&gt; there are many convincing arguments for cooperation and working together,<br/>
&gt; but we must be careful to not become too smugly satisfied with being a<br/>
&gt; specialist in an &quot;assembly-line&quot; (regardless of how well we&#39;re paid) if the<br/>
