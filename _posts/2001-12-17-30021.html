with anaplastic thyroid cancer. Her condition deteriorated rapidly over<br/>
the last few days of her life - we knew she was dying but it looked like<br/>
we had a month or two, so we were ready but not ready. We found out on<br/>
Monday morning that her condition had really deteriorated over the night,<br/>
and we called my brother in Hawai&#39;i and managed to get him home on a<br/>
flight that arrived at 9 that evening, a true miracle - he didn&#39;t have<br/>
time to pack anything so arrived with the clothes on his back and saw her<br/>
before she died.<br/>
