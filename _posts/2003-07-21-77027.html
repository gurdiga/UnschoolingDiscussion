<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222288482">Seeming people do come on here and ask questions off topic, I figured <br/>
I would ask one that is off topic but has to do with our son.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone here had an alcoholic in their family or has been an <br/>
alcoholic that fears that their child will be too or has actually <br/>
turned out to be one?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit concerned about this after I received the following e-mail:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I was raised by abusive parents but ones that never drank, as a<br/>
matter of fact I don&#39;t know one person in my family that even has <br/>
alcohol in their home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That is a red flag right there, since it is so unusual in our <br/>
culture to NEVER drink.  Unless the use of alcohol is forbidden by <br/>
your religion, it is likely that your family stays away from it for a <br/>
reason!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just the worried mom in me but my family honestly never <br/>
drank and they were not closet drinkers and now I wonder about when <br/>
our son gets older. Am I missing the red flag somewhere? Does anyone <br/>
here feel that it is unusual to never drink?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kim, my family are not drinkers either.  I didn&#39;t even have more than an occassional single beer until I was in college, and even then it was just a couple drinks at an occassional party.  Today, I will have a drink out socially, but we don&#39;t even usually have alcohol in the house.  My brother and his wife never drink, my sister and her husband never drink and regularly hold parties with absolutely no alcohol.  My parents almost never drink -- I&#39;ve seen my dad have a beer socially, and my Mom a glass of wine.  None of these folks is a &quot;closet drinker&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unusual to never drink.<br/>

<br/>
We had a party here in a few weeks back and it didn&#39;t even occur to me to buy <br/>
alcohol.  We had asked some people to contribute stuff if they wanted to, and <br/>
those who brought things brought salad and soda.  It was a party so people <br/>
could see our friend Helena who&#39;s living in London.  Helena had brought us a <br/>
bottle of Pimm&#39;s and we all tasted that, and made drinks with Sprite and Pimm&#39;s <br/>
and she told us stories about who did and didn&#39;t drink Pimm&#39;s and when, and we <br/>
tried to guess what it was and what was in it (it&#39;s spiced gin, I think).<br/>
<br/>
There were unfinished drinks here and there, and it was totally no big deal.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I lucked out in the genetic crapshoot.  My sister has been alcoholic <br/>
and used cocaine.  I don&#39;t much like alcohol anyway, and when I tried cocaine <br/>
it hurt my nose and I thought it was disgusting.    We have the same parents, <br/>
same grandparents, but she got bits I didn&#39;t, and vice versa.  She smokes <br/>
cigarettes like crazy, but it keeps her thin so she justifies it that way.<br/>
<br/>
If my sister had been here she would NOT have had Pimm&#39;s and Sprite, but just <br/>
Sprite, because she doesn&#39;t touch cocaine or alcohol anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695415966">Thanks Shelly for responding to my question. Many thanks to all the <br/>
wonderful people on this list that e-mailed me with their thoughts<br/>
and opinions. It truly shows that you all want to help others on<br/>
their <br/>
unschooling journey, even if it&#39;s a bit OT.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All I can say is that practically everyone thinks it runs in families by some <br/>
mechanism or other.  Do I think worry two kids are at risk considering that <br/>
both their parents had problems in the past?  Of course.  One of the things <br/>
I&#39;ve done is bring them to Narcotics Anonymous meetings that allow kids because I <br/>
think they hear things that are a lot more effective than any school based <br/>
program I ever heard of.  (I&#39;d take them to AA too, but in my area these almost <br/>
never allow kids.)  As they get older I will educate them as best I can, <br/>
including teaching them the latest findings about the genetic and biochemical <br/>
factors involved.  But in the long run it will have to be their choice.  <br/>
