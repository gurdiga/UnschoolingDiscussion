HI back atcha Elizabeth!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Deb S--<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I was not clear. I meant symptoms often clear with treament with<br/>
antibiotics. Borrelia is a screw shaped bacteria that gets into the CNS and<br/>
causes a myriad of symptoms, asperger&#39;s and ADD among them. Also MS, Lupus,<br/>
ALS, 100% if Alzheimer&#39;s post mortem testing of brain has shown presence of<br/>
Borrelia.  I have a wonderful best friend with Aspergers who developed it<br/>
after two tick bites. He is such a gift!! I know your daughter is too.<br/>
 I had all symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s two years ago. That is gone with abx<br/>
treatment, which continues. Don&#39;t mean to labor the point but on the other<br/>
hand I can&#39;t undo what I know to be true in many cases. Its a curse to know<br/>
about it sometimes, as I feel morally obligated to speak up. Another friend<br/>
now stands to gain much of her life back after finding out she didn&#39;t after<br/>
all have Parkinsons or MS or all the other stuff they were looking for. She<br/>
has LD.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My dh and I have brought her a long way from where she was at three.<br/>
&gt; Emily is Aspergers will always be Aspergers no matter how well she<br/>
&gt; blends in with everyone else.  It is a different way of thinking and<br/>
&gt; seeing the world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They have found the longer you wait to help them the harder it is to<br/>
&gt; gain ground.<br/>
