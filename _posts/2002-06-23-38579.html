  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] a boy and his socks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Since yesterday...<br/>
  Early a.m, Kirby, Marty and their three friends get up early to go to a big <br/>
  regional &quot;kotei&quot; (Legend of Five Rings tournament at the gaming shop); Holly <br/>
  and I are up because Holly has an acting class at 9:00; five out-of-town teen <br/>
  houseguests are up to go to Edgefest, all-day rock concert in the sun (sun <br/>
  screen?  Hats?  yes.  Okay.)<br/>
<br/>
  I made pancakes and sausage for all of them.  Keith made juice, Holly set the <br/>
  table, all got full.<br/>
<br/>
  My sister calls pretty frantic because the twelve-year-old son of a family <br/>
  they know who live in a town near Las Vegas, NM, is missing.  Two days <br/>
  missing, and she wants them to look for him at Edgefest.  She&#39;s not calming <br/>
  down.  I said &quot;Do you want to ruin their day? I&#39;ll paraphrase.&quot;   I convinced <br/>
  her that if he ran away he probably would not go to Edgefest, and if he was <br/>
  abducted, the abductor would not take him to Edgefest, and so to wait until <br/>
  in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
  So the kotei batch had left, and I said calmly to the remaining set that if <br/>
  they saw Skye they should call me or Ruth (my former sister-in-law, from my <br/>
  long-ago first marriage, and close friend of the mom) so we could let his mom <br/>
  know he&#39;s okay, because she&#39;s not sure where he is.  I said it calmly, <br/>
  without panic or details.  They said fine.  I gave them phone numbers.<br/>
<br/>
  Holly goes to two classes, Holly auditions for some photo thing (they liked <br/>
  her and spent a lot of time with her, and then asked her how tall her parents <br/>
  are. Very tall?  Wah.  I&#39;m 5&#39;4&quot; but Holly wasn&#39;t sure.  She said her dad was <br/>
  tall but her mom says she&#39;s not too tall).<br/>
<br/>
  Home, all ten teens are still out, Keith says my sister called before her <br/>
  three kids and their two friends left to say they had found Skye in an <br/>
  arroyo, dead.  Keith opted not to offer the phone to the kids, convincing my <br/>
  sister they would NOT search the concert site for him, but just planned <br/>
  casually to glance around and call if they saw him.  Better not to ruin their <br/>
  day.  My sister agreed, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
  Kirby and crew came back.  The winner (of the fancy-sword prize) was a friend <br/>
  of theirs, so they were happy for him.  Kirby had lost to a cheater from <br/>
  Utah, he said--literally cheating,  drawing cards in a sleight-of-hand way, <br/>
  and having nine cards  after playing two, when the hand limit was eight.  But <br/>
  since Kirby works there he was bending over backwards to be hospitable to <br/>
  people, and thought he could whip him anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
  The other kids came back late, REALLY exhausted, didn&#39;t say anything about <br/>
  Skye (and I was glad).  One was sun poisoned, pretty sick, and we got her <br/>
  Aleve, much water, and some quiet.    One had a mosh-pit scrape on his back, <br/>
  and the last three seemed to have survived okay, but all were droopy-tired.  <br/>
  Three slept out on our upstairs deck, five on floor and couch in the library, <br/>
  and my own boys in their own rooms (probably tired from the overwhelming day).<br/>
<br/>
  Sunday morning, I watched the last third of Gone With the Wind (for the first <br/>
  time seeing it, and it was cool).  I was folding clothes while watching a <br/>
  video.  Most teens were up, in various stages of finding out Skye was dead.  <br/>
  I went in after my sister had talked to all three of her kids, and talked to <br/>
  them.  I apologized for knowing and not saying more, and they understood.  I <br/>
  told them until the autopsy it woudln&#39;t be known what happened, and even then <br/>
  maybe not.  The body had been &quot;pretty banged up&quot; was the only quote we had so <br/>
  far.   There&#39;s the possibility of his friend being suspect.  The first story, <br/>
  Wednesday, when he was first missing, was he left his friend&#39;s house to walk <br/>
  home.  He didn&#39;t make it.  He was found in an arroyo (a ravine) the other <br/>
  direction.   So I told the kids not to guess yet until more was known.  <br/>
  Could&#39;ve been the boys were playing too rough and he got badly hurt and his <br/>
  friend panicked.  Could be someone hit him with a pickup and panicked and <br/>
  took him and hid him.  Maybe a mountain lion, or dogs (we know instances of <br/>
  both, in our lives, in Northern New Mexico).  Possibly, but not necessarily, <br/>
  abduction and murder.  But for them to keep calm and be careful and that they <br/>
  would probably need to go to the funeral this week.<br/>
<br/>
  Kirby got in the shower, needing to be at work before 11:30.  I sent his <br/>
  eight balled-up pairs of clean socks with Holly up to his room so they would <br/>
  be there when he got out of the shower.  <br/>
<br/>
  After the whole weekend, delivering clean, sorted socks to his room felt like <br/>
  a huge privilege, not a job.  I KNOW that he dealt with things this weekend <br/>
  much more educational and important than sock-supply, and it&#39;s only noon on <br/>
  Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
  OH!  I forgot discovering that our huge juniper tree had been blown by the <br/>
  wind so hard that it had pulled one of its roots up from the ground some, and <br/>
  there were cracks in the ground like a little earthquake, about three feet <br/>
  square, and that visible root, about 2&quot; diameter.  It leans over our <br/>
  neighbors&#39; house.  Now it was leaning a little bit more.<br/>
<br/>
  I went to the movies on short notice with adult female friends (cool!) but <br/>
  that meant two bad things:<br/>
<br/>
  1.  Holly and I both forgot we had planned to go and see one of her <br/>
  classmates doing mannequin modelling in a store window in the mall.<br/>
  and<br/>
  2.  I wasn&#39;t home when the tree-removal guys came to do an emergency <br/>
  tree-ectomy.  They didn&#39;t drop it on my four-year-old catalpa tree (though <br/>
  nearly), but I did lose half my day lilies (until next year), some of the <br/>
  pumpkin plants, and all my morning glories.  I cried, hard, in the garage.<br/>
<br/>
  I felt bad about crying hard when I found out it was costing $800 for tree <br/>
  removal.<br/>
<br/>
  And the branches they threw in the front yard until they bring a chipper <br/>
  Monday crushed my husband&#39;s sage he really liked.  His birthday&#39;s soon, so <br/>
  I&#39;ll try to find him some good sage.  He would probably rather have nothing <br/>
  than spend money like that, but our attempts to transplant sage from vacant <br/>
  lots hasn&#39;t done well.  Maybe I&#39;ll go look on construction sites for older <br/>
  plants that are going to be trashed anyway.  We&#39;ll get some firewood out of <br/>
  the deal--whatever we want to pull out of the pile before they get back <br/>
  Monday.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Our kids are alive, and so losing a tree or missing a social moment aren&#39;t <br/>
  the end of the world.  And who gets clean socks from one room to another is <br/>
  positively miniscule.<br/>
<br/>
  Almost everyone&#39;s gone from the house at the moment and it&#39;s quiet.  <br/>

The sock discussion.<br/>

It&#39;s about what&#39;s important.  I personally think MOST things are more <br/>

This is a reminder of how fragile life is.  This is how it happens.  <br/>
One moment you&#39;re involved with the details of everyday life, the <br/>
next moment everything is different.  <br/>
<br/>
My (younger) brother died at the beginning of the year.  I know my <br/>
mom wishes she was able to deliver &quot;clean socks&quot; to his room.  I know <br/>
Sandra is thankful that her son (any of her children) needs clean <br/>
socks.  Sometimes it&#39;s the little things that remind us how lucky we <br/>
are.</div>

Thanks for paraphrasing me so sweetly, and I&#39;m really sorry about your <br/>
brother.<br/>
<br/>

If any of you can see out the window and aren&#39;t seeing a skyful of ashen <br/>
haze, or if you have trees you can see and they&#39;re not on fire, you might <br/>
want to take a deep breath of gratitude and appreciation, too, and be glad <br/>
your children are safe at home.<br/>

read since my granddaughter&#39;s name is Skye.  Give your kids a hug for <br/>
me.  And I hope the only problems with fire you have this year are that <br/>
smoke.  I can&#39;t even imagine being in the path of a raging forest fire.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294435957">In the scheme of things  socks are really umimportant (around here we <br/>
don&#39;t wear them)  but when everything else is going wrong  it is nice <br/>
to have kids that know how to do their own  or a mother/father that <br/>
is willing to do them for you!  and if at some point  there is no <br/>
teaching/guidance   there is a pretty good chance that there may be <br/>
no learning.<br/>

issue a <br/>

I think it would help a whole lot for you to read more about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The suggestion that there is no teaching/guidance involved in natural <br/>
learning is a fallacy.  <br/>
<br/>
People are saying &quot;you could have a more peaceful relationship with your <br/>
children if your priorities were different,&quot; and it&#39;s being interpreted in <br/>
the worst light.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been following the Rodeo fire in Arizona in the news. I grew up in<br/>
Arizona. The White Mountains are burining. Show Low is burning - the main<br/>
street in town is called Deuce of Clubs, because that was the low card<br/>
that the winning rancher turned up. We used to go up fishing near there<br/>
during the summer, at Lake of the Woods in Pinetop-Lakeside, at a cabin<br/>
in Greer, in Heber-Overgaard. Heber-Overgaard already burned. It&#39;s the<br/>
biggest fire in Arizona history.<br/>
<br/>
Last month Mount Lemmon (north of Tucson) burned. A week or two ago there<br/>
was a fire near the Arizona-Mexico border, near the lakes where we used<br/>
to go fishing.<br/>
<br/>
I can see smoke out my window. It&#39;s probably someone burning trash at a<br/>
neighboring farm, but it still makes me nervous.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all very very sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346464959">&lt;&lt;Our kids are alive, and so losing a tree or missing a social moment<br/>
aren&#39;t <br/>
the end of the world.  And who gets clean socks from one room to another<br/>
is <br/>
positively miniscule.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, any attempt to describe how much I needed to read this will fall<br/>
short.  I have been obsessing about so much &quot;stuff&quot; and missing the sheer<br/>
bliss of my life.  I&#39;ll be leaving the rest of the house work till later<br/>
and take the kids to the pool, maybe we won&#39;t get back to to the work at<br/>
all today.  I need some snuggle time with my kids!  I&#39;ll definitely<br/>
relish those moments spent folding their clean clothes, thank God they&#39;re<br/>
here to get them dirty again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be sending good thoughts and prayers your way about the loss of your<br/>
young friend, Skye.<br/>

&lt;&lt; We are not there, so we cannot know what her priorities are. Most of us do <br/>
the best we can and strive for improvement each day. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We can only know people by what they write and what they claim.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are striving for improvement need other models and ideas to <br/>
consider.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As homeschooling <br/>
parents, we need to offer love and support to each other&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t love and support people who force their children to do ABeka lessons.<br/>
I don&#39;t love and support parents who spank and ground their children for not <br/>
&quot;finishing homework&quot; (when they&#39;re homeschooling).<br/>
I don&#39;t love and support people who belittle their children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the current situation it had to do with none of the above, but with <br/>
&quot;consequences&quot; which were not natural, but were created.  <br/>
<br/>
But all the situations above HAVE been dealt with by unschoolers in online <br/>
discussions and on sites (as www.unschooling.com, AOL&#39;s homeschooling forum, <br/>
and others).  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; As homeschooling <br/>
parents, we need to offer love and support to each other, not guilt and <br/>
blame. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My love and support goes to children, not to the parents.  If the parents are <br/>
doing things which makes childhood rough, which negatively affects the peace <br/>
and trust between children and parents, and which will create bad memories <br/>
for the children, I want to love and support those children, even if it might <br/>
make the parents feel guilty in the process.  If they are doing those things <br/>
(rough life, bad memories, disturbing the peace) then they should feel <br/>
guilty. If they are not, then GREAT!!<br/>
<br/>
People can ignore everything around them.  They can ignore me all they want. <br/>
They can go to any of dozens of unschooling discussionsarn, why have the list <br/>
then?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Each person here can give the type of support she thinks will help the most.<br/>
Each person here can pick and choose of the information presented.<br/>
