&lt;&lt; &gt; Take a look to the attachment. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     I got this as a private email from Valerie Stewart and have no idea what <br/>
it is.  It was in response to my post answering what I do.  I got another one <br/>
just like it in response to my post about violence in movies.  I would like <br/>
to ask why we get so much email now with some form of attachments, most the <br/>
kind that don&#39;t need to be downloaded, but this was a regular download type.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know that much about that even though I&#39;ve had a computer for 2 1/2 <br/>
yrs now.  I just know that everytime I go to open any of the attachment <br/>
types, AOL has a warning first and I know that that&#39;s how the computer <br/>
viruses get into your computer so I&#39;m wondering why there&#39;s so much of it <br/>
now.  I don&#39;t mean this as an argument; just truly wondering is there <br/>
something about posting this way that makes it easier or what?<br/>
     Also, I don&#39;t want to download this attachment from Valerie unless she <br/>
can tell me what it is.  Thanks...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341602083">I got two from Johanna, too! But they had bad file<br/>
data! Oh, poor Johanna! I hope people don&#39;t think<br/>
she&#39;s sending them nude pictures of herself! The<br/>
really weird thing about the ones from Johanna is that<br/>
what *I* said was quoted, then it said, &quot;Take a look<br/>
at this link! Johanna&quot; I replied saying they were<br/>
corrupt file data. Did anyone see that reply from me<br/>
or did it go somewhere else? Juli<br/>

     That&#39;s how mine was too.  I responded thinking it was to the group <br/>
because it still said unschooling dotcom in the subject but I never saw it <br/>
come up so when I looked back at it I saw that it was from her privately.<br/>
