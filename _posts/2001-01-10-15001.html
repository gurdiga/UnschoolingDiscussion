<div id="ygrps-yiv-844859388">I have to give my 2¢ on video games and gameboys. I was one who didnt<br/>
want the darn things in my house. In my mind I had it they would rot my<br/>
kids brains and they would become lazy and not want to do anything but<br/>
play them. Hey I am big enough to admit I felt the same way about Legos.<br/>
I know what was I thinking? Still deschooling I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Walk into my house now you will find my son (9) not only has a gameboy<br/>
but a subscription to some game magazine. We also picked up an old Sega<br/>
genisis (ok so we aren&#39;t hip but so far no complaints). Why the change?<br/>
My dh bought Nate one and I put the rule he had to get x amount of work<br/>
done around the house before game time. Well then I noticed the kid who<br/>
hated to read was reading the manual. Nate swore up and down he couldnt<br/>
read. But there he was sitting on the couch reading. We went up  to a<br/>
used game store and picked up more games with his allowence and he got a<br/>
membership that came with a magazine subscription to I believe it is The<br/>
Game Informer (or something like that). I don&#39;t really know as soon as<br/>
it hits the mail box Nate grabs it and runs to his room and reads it.<br/>
Again this is my son who didn&#39;t want to read.<br/>
<br/>
I had to say this since someone else posted they worried their kid would<br/>
play nintendo all day. My son has gone from not reading at all to<br/>
reading chapter books and actually enjoying a trip to the library<br/>
because I let a gameboy in the house. Who knew. *L*<br/>
<br/>
So never under estimate the learning power of something even if you<br/>
don&#39;t see it. This is what I am finding out as we take this unschooling<br/>
journey.<br/>
