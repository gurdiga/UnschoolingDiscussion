&gt;   My question is this: How do unschoolers feel about lessons? Piano lessons,<br/>
&gt;   swimming lessons, tai chi lessons, etc. I&#39;m talking about where the child<br/>
&gt;   goes to a place, with another adult, not the parent, and learns in a<br/>
&gt;   structured way about something. Ever do that? Or is it bad-bad-bad?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son Julian (12) loves a bunch of structured classes and lessons. He takes <br/>
guitar lessons from a wonderful woman who talks with him with great respect, <br/>
as two people who love music. He&#39;s joined a series of enrichment courses at <br/>
MIT for ten weeks, and has a blast wandering about the MIT campus, eating <br/>
lunch at the cafeteria, figuring out where they might have moved the Music <br/>
Theory class THIS week.  He is eagerly anticipating a hands-on program this <br/>
summer in oceanography in Northern Maine, by the Boston Museum of Science.<br/>
<br/>
When I see an opportunity I think he might like, I mention it to him, and he <br/>
decides if he&#39;d like to do it. Sometimes he asks me to keep an eye out for <br/>
something specific he&#39;d like to do. At this point, I am the Resource Person <br/>
-- he relies on me a lot for outside resource opportunities. I suspect in the <br/>
next couple of years that will be changing. (But I am also a <br/>
Resource-kinda-gal among adult friends and relatives. I tell all kinds of <br/>
people when I see something I think they&#39;ll love.)<br/>
<br/>
The thing about the classes and lessons that has happened is: He always seems <br/>
to end up learning from people who LOVE what they&#39;re doing, and want to share <br/>
it. The MIT classes are taught by MIT students who are passionate about the <br/>
thing they care about. The Oceanography is led by scientists, and the <br/>
assumption is that the kids will act as scientists.  I think Julian would run <br/>
screaming from a class taught in a less empowering way. And if they tried to <br/>
give him a TEST about it...well, forget it. None has been condescending or <br/>
&quot;schooly&quot; in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when you have choices you find people to learn from who see you as a <br/>
partner in a journey rather than someone who requires wisdom to be imported <br/>
upon.<br/>
