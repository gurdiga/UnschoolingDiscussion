<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996338533">Hi Sandie!<br/>
It is nice to know that there are other FLYbabies out there unschooling! We <br/>
just started unschooling, had to talk DH into it :-)! My life would be so <br/>
full of CHAOS if it where not for FlyLady. I hope some others do look into <br/>
it. It is fun and simple, even for kids.<br/>

&gt;I do house work the Fly Lady way (www.flylady.net), it has really improved<br/>
&gt;our household.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Woo Hoo Carrie - I&#39;m a FlyBaby, too :) and I&#39;m finally getting the house<br/>
&gt;under control and the kids eager to help.  I also apply some of FlyLady&#39;s<br/>
&gt;principals to our unschooling routine so nobody gets overwhelmed or anxious<br/>
&gt;feeling like we &quot;have to&quot; get certain things done...we know whatever we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;doing is what we&#39;re doing at the moment, and we&#39;re never behind so we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have to worry about trying to catch up.  My girls are much more focused on<br/>
&gt;the theme of the moment and don&#39;t worry about how long it takes or how long<br/>
&gt;they want to spend on any given topic, subject, or activity.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt;I could be successfully guiding my kids and feel good about everything we<br/>
&gt;accomplish without having experienced FlyLady!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also encourage anyone interested in a guilt-free approach to household<br/>
&gt;chores to take a look!<br/>
