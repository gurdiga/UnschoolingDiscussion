 </span></blockquote>Hey Stella.  I am an organizer by nature, and your house sounds like one I would have a fabulous time in, if you were to let me loose to help with your space and clutter issues.  If you would like to talk more about it privately, feel free to email me, and maybe I can help you brainstorm ideas about what to do.<br/>

are all so far apart-we could just trade off and clean for each other!<br/>

together and have a cleaning co-op. Kinda like I&#39;ll<br/>
help you clean  your house if you help me clean mine.<br/>
She said that before she knew they were doing this she<br/>
was embarrassed because their houses were so much<br/>
cleaner than hers. Now that she knows she doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
so bad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041728394">I read a suggestion somewhere ages ago (might have been Do <br/>
Not Disturd, by Deborah Jackson) for a &#39;playgroup&#39; type thing <br/>
where mothers had a cleaning circle, they went to each others <br/>
houses and got all the stuff done while the kids played togethr, I <br/>
thought this was such a neat idea, shame I haven&#39;t found anyone <br/>
to do this with, but there again I&#39;ve just remembered it...<br/>
