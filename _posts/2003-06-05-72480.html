<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560823014">I went down yesterday to see my mom.  She didn&#39;t appear to recognize me and<br/>
kept her eyes closed.  They did fly open briefly when I whistled our family<br/>
whistle.  That was so familiar it called her back briefly.<br/>
<br/>
They had decided to move her to a nursing home that day since we had agreed<br/>
on only comfort care.  When she got to the nursing home, her eyes opened and<br/>
stayed open.  She had such a look of fear and confusion.  I hadn&#39;t planned<br/>
on staying overnight, but I just couldn&#39;t leave her like that.  They brought<br/>
in a big recliner for me to sleep on, and I spent the night mostly holding<br/>
her hand.  She settled down and closed her eyes by late evening and seemed<br/>
to sleep fairly peacefully.  She was much the same in the morning.  I would<br/>
have stayed if she still seemed scared, but since she didn&#39;t, I left and<br/>
came home.  Of course she had to go and die while I was travelling home.<br/>
They told me she might do that.  I guess it&#39;s common.  I had just been<br/>
hoping she would die while I was there because I really wanted to hold her<br/>
in my arms for a few minutes.  I couldn&#39;t do that while she was alive<br/>
because it would have caused too much pain.<br/>
<br/>
But she&#39;s in a better place now and free from both pain and dementia.  For<br/>
that I&#39;m happy.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry for your loss. There are no words to say at this moment in your <br/>
life, so I will leave you with this. She was lucky to have you as her daughter <br/>
and you were lucky to have her for a mother. And you were both lucky to have <br/>
a night of holding hands before she crossed over. <br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you and yours,<br/>

Tia I am so sorry for you loss. Just the thought of losing a parent brought<br/>
me to tears. I&#39;ve lost my dad and wasn&#39;t able to be anywhere near him. You<br/>
were there for your mother and I would say in her way she knew that. You<br/>
stayed with her when she seemed to need you there and you also saw that she<br/>
became comfortable where she was. Maybe that gave her the comfort she needed<br/>
to let go. You were a loving daughter and I&#39;m sure that was everything to<br/>
her. My sympathies to you and the family.<br/>

oldest was almost a year old and my youngest wasn&#39;t even thought of yet.  When I <br/>
make something from a recipe of my mom&#39;s I will mention it.  Like:  &quot;my Mom <br/>
used to make this for me.&quot;  or &quot;my Mom used to love to crochet...she made my <br/>
Christmas stocking.&quot; etc.  Then they get to know her a little and they come back <br/>
and will ask &quot;did your Mom ever do xyz?&quot; and we get to talk about my <br/>
childhood a little.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is a Mom thing because Jackson doesn&#39;t do that about his Mom.  My <br/>
boys and I love to look through the old photo albums and see what I looked like <br/>
as a child and see my parents etc.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Pam, and everyone else who sent condolences.  I was surprised how<br/>
much all those emails have helped.<br/>
We&#39;re planning to have a family gathering in a couple of weeks.  (Mom didn&#39;t<br/>
want a service.  This is for us.)  We&#39;ll eat ice cream with chocolate syrup<br/>
(a nightly tradition at her place) and look at pictures and old family<br/>
movies and remember together.  Skye (8) is the only one of my grandkids who<br/>
even met her great-grandma, and she was 2 then.  I was surprised she<br/>
remembered her, but she does.  So the pictures and rememories will help the<br/>
little ones and be carried on for more than just that one day.<br/>

Tia, I am so sorry for your loss. The day you have planned sounds beautiful. When my mother died, we had a memorial service that allowed us all to remember her with her presence there.  We sprayed her perfume in the chapel, placed pots of Gardenias, her favorite flowers, everywhere, and then later planted them in her yard.  The immediate members of her family and a few of her closest friends read poems that she loved or that reminded us of her.  At the end we sang &quot;To Life&quot; from Fiddler on the Roof and all toasted her with champagne.  I remember my little step brothers (who were only six) climbing all over the largest, coolest sculptures (actually headstones) while we were outside having our toast to her. I was 26. This was years before I had my own children.  It was my first huge hit of how children completely bring you into the moment, into life, the living.  May you have a warm day of memories and of loving each other.  I know there are no right words to say to you. You sharing your experience on her last day/night really moved me alot.  I ended up dancing with my three year old to a new song by Train about a guardian angel. Take care of yourself.<br/>

I wish strength, peace and clarity to you and your family.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing my father suffer through 2 years of dementia, it was truly <br/>
a relief.<br/>
The same thing happened to us --he waited for us to leave so he could <br/>
do it<br/>
his way (typical of my dad). Looking back, it&#39;s actually kind of <br/>
endearing that<br/>
he still had some will left in him.<br/>
<br/>
Strength, peace and clarity.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
