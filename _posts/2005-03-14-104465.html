Sometimes it has helped with dh, and the occasional other father who is<br/>
sprouting off orders unthinkingly, for me just to quietly say, &quot;Why?&quot;. It<br/>
makes them pause for a moment, and is especially useful when the answer is<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719826698">Heidi- we are so in the same situation.  My dh still wants to be obeyed when <br/>
he announces Clean up, or Bedtime.  He still makes comments like, &quot; I told you <br/>
I didn&#39;t want you playing that Gameboy all day.&quot;  Luckily, I&#39;m around most of <br/>
the time and can temper his comments.  At first he resented my stepping in; <br/>
he felt I was undermining his authority and insulting his parenting.  We&#39;ve <br/>
even had a few blow ups, but I think he&#39;s starting to understand it.  He can see <br/>
that my gentler method, which respects the childrens&#39; wishes and gives them <br/>
time to transition, produces slower but MUCH pleasanter results.  He&#39;s stopped <br/>
stressing about bedtimes as much, and I see him experimenting with my technique <br/>
once in a while, which really warms my heart.  He&#39;s really a terrific, <br/>
involved, and loving father, he&#39;s just a little stuck in his ways.  I now feel <br/>
confident he will come around all together, just as he did with the academic part <br/>
of unschooling.<br/>
    So, my advice: keep modeling your way, try not to blow up(not easy) when <br/>
he uses those knee jerk responses, and find quiet times to explain your <br/>
method.  And remember to empathize that this must be a big scary change for him.  I <br/>
became a very different person and parent over the course of a couple months.  <br/>
That&#39;s a lot for any spouse to adjust to.<br/>

On a very exciting note, dh has just agreed for us to actually homeschool /<br/>
unschool! Niklas is turning 5 in May and I was starting to get antsy about<br/>
the kindergarten registration deadline coming up. Well, one short<br/>
conversation and dh actually agreed! I&#39;m so excited to be able to call us<br/>
official homeschoolers! I haven&#39;t yet wrote an intro - I&#39;ve been lurking for<br/>
months now. I&#39;ll try to find time to do so in the next couple days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139530919">What Ben Lovejoy has might help him a lot (it was a conference  presentation, <br/>
but the text of it is here):  _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/benrules_">http://sandradodd.com/benrules_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/benrules)">http://sandradodd.com/benrules)</a> <br/>
It&#39;s about living by principles instead of rules.   <br/>
That could help a lot in the case of bedtimes and gameboys.  If the  <br/>
principle is a happy child who&#39;s learning should be left to do so (learning is  good <br/>
and happiness is good), then he won&#39;t be as likely to say &quot;I said  stop.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
If the principle is sleep is important and going to sleep happy is better  <br/>
than going to sleep unhappy (and contributes to better sleep) then it makes less <br/>
 sense to shout children off to bed.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe a list of priorities, with a &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; column so that  <br/>
things are ranked in twos:  <br/>
respect is better than demanding<br/>
choice is better than command<br/>
laughing is better than crying<br/>
talking is better than yelling<br/>
yelling is better than hitting, but talking is even better.<br/>
 <br/>
going where a kid is is better than shouting for him to &quot;come here&quot; (when  it <br/>
makes no other difference)<br/>
 <br/>
When he&#39;s making a choice, maybe he could just make a better choice each  <br/>
time.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a tape called Peaceful Parenting that&#39;s me and Richard Prystowsky,  a <br/>
talk we gave in Sacramento a few years ago, and that make-a-better-choice  <br/>
principle is explained better there.  E-mail me if you want  to order  one, or <br/>
you can search online and find it maybe from the guy who does the  taping.  <br/>
I&#39;ll have some with me in St. Louis in October, too.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
------<br/>
 <br/>
I think so. <br/>
And you might find yourself using some of those new tools on your husband  <br/>
too.<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t remember anymore how I worded it, but I remember one day telling my  <br/>
husband that it would probably be best if he weren&#39;t the less favorite or less <br/>
 sought-out parent, and if he kept being inflexible and channeling his <br/>
parents,  that was likely to happen.   It wasn&#39;t &quot;they&#39;ll like me best,&quot; but  &quot;don&#39;t <br/>
you want them to like you and want to come to you with problems?&quot;   And if he <br/>
heard it as &quot;they&#39;ll like me best,&quot; oh well.  I do remember  asking him if he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to do differently than his parents did, and I told  him when I&#39;m <br/>
not careful I hear my own mom coming out of my mouth, so we should  both be <br/>
careful and conscious and be KIRBY&#39;s parents, not OUR parents.<br/>
 <br/>
It was probably in some antagonistic moment of frustration, but whatever it  <br/>
was, it did help. <br/>
 <br/>
On the other hand, with kids all teens, the other day when Keith was  working <br/>
on taxes (and becoming his parents, as he does during tax prep, because  they <br/>
did his taxes for many years and it&#39;s &quot;just math&quot; on one hand a total  <br/>
reversion to family of origin on the big mean hand)...  Keith yelled at me  about <br/>
being tired of me not understanding our finances better and for 14 years  he&#39;s <br/>
had no say in how the kids are raised.  <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, really? <br/>
No, that was his mom speaking through him.  <br/>
Just an hour or two before that he had been saying Marty was a great kid,  <br/>
doing really well, when I was discussing whether I should press a  <br/>
police-department-volunteer  thing he&#39;s said &quot;When I&#39;m sixteen...&quot; about or  just let it <br/>
slide, as he&#39;s really busy lately and not as interested as he once  was.  Keith <br/>
was mushy sweet about Marty and Marty&#39;s life and interests and  abilities.  It <br/>
didn&#39;t keep him from yelling at me from the fog of  tax-world.<br/>
 <br/>
So sometimes it&#39;s two steps forward and one back (or vice versa) but  <br/>
eventually it can be years of peace, one yelling fit, more peace...<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Will my methods produce positive change<br/>

 <br/>
Yes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, yes. I&#39;m with my kids about 9 hours a day while dh is at work or <br/>
getting ready for work, or otherwise occupied. So that&#39;s a huge <br/>
portion of their week.<br/>
<br/>
It can be tough figuring out how to respond to dh&#39;s parenting in a <br/>
way that helps everyone. We were just discussing this on the <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled list. When I slip back into grumpy authoritative <br/>
parenting, dh sometimes pulls me back out, but more often joins me <br/>
there and things spiral downhill.<br/>
<br/>
Good news is that it takes less time to work our way back to <br/>
happiness each time as that base of mindful parenting and respect <br/>
grows stronger.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
======<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t always try to do it in a way that helped him, or at least not  <br/>
directly.<br/>
 <br/>
I would remind the kids that he still had problems with the way his parents  <br/>
treated him, and it might be harder for him to remember to be  <br/>
patient/gentle/fun.  It was a living lesson, though, in not doing the first  thing you think <br/>
to do, or not saying the first thing you think of.  And  using him as a sad, <br/>
bad example sometimes, or something they just needed to  learn to accept and <br/>
live around, was int he longrun helpful to everyone, but in  the shortrun it <br/>
probably seemed as though I wasn&#39;t accepting my husband as he  was (I wasn&#39;t, but <br/>
I was understanding it and helping the kids see what might&#39;ve  caused it, and <br/>
it wasn&#39;t THEM), or not &quot;respecting&quot; him.  But I didn&#39;t  respect having my <br/>
kids yelled at (even by someone else whose kids they were  too).  And he WASN&#39;T <br/>
an equal partner if he wasn&#39;t willing to find out what  had happened while he <br/>
was gone that might affect his expectations or plans when  he got home.  <br/>
Blasting in and issuing commands in the midst of a situation  is rarely the path to <br/>
success.  Better to be briefed first, and find out  what if anything needs to <br/>
be done.  Maybe they&#39;ve been gone all day and  need to chill.  Maybe they <br/>
were having a horrible day and have JUST cheered  up and started getting along <br/>
and feeling mellow.  Maybe they were great for  hours and melted down just as <br/>
the dad pulled up.  <br/>
 <br/>
It does take a while, but when the dad sees how cool the kids are he&#39;ll  <br/>
soften up.  <br/>
 <br/>
With Keith, he used to say things like &quot;Shouldn&#39;t Kirby be doing this?&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;When I was his age, I could do X...&quot; and it helped a lot for me to get Keith  <br/>
where other kids were.  La Leche League activities, the &quot;let&#39;s have a  <br/>
barbecue this time&quot; meetings of the babysitting co-op.  Kids&#39; birthday  parties we <br/>
hosted or attended.  When he saw that Kirby was fine and  personable and <br/>
responsible, he got more into looking at and supporting Kirby  instead of waiting for <br/>
Kirby to fit his mental model of what a little boy should  be like (by <br/>
calendar age or season or time of the day).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969342536">As for the kids responding to respectful methodology: I see it <br/>
working. My son is very aware in social settings. Not super outgoing, <br/>
but he sees when someone needs a chair, and goes gets it. He holds <br/>
doors open, and helps littler kids with things. He&#39;s always willing <br/>
to get someone a drink of water if he&#39;s up. You know &quot;anyone else <br/>
want something while I&#39;m up?&quot; Quite adult, compassionate things, and <br/>
not anything we&#39;ve specifically taught him. Modelled, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
But I also see some meaningless, sheepish looks and half-hearted <br/>
apologies when he pulls a boo-boo. Like buying some candy with money <br/>
his dad asked him not to spend. (He wanted the kid to ask me, first, <br/>
because it was change left over from some I&#39;d given him. Not a huge <br/>
disaster, but also not respecting what his dad had asked him to do.) <br/>
And, the dad hooted and hollered, and the son looked sheepish and <br/>
said &quot;sorry&quot; as he ate the candy he&#39;d bought.  and dh rolled his eyes <br/>
and heaved a big sigh and muttered something and walked off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to see more Child Level communication. Father coming up <br/>
beside Son and talking, not just handing down decrees and then being <br/>
frustrated when the kids fail to heed and obey. <br/>
<br/>
thanks for the responses and ideas.<br/>
