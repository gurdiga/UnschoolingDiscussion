&gt;What are stims? Is it an achronim?<br/>

It&#39;s short for stimulation.  Children with Autism will flap their hands,<br/>
spin in circles, rock back and forth, make vocal noises (Amanda grunts). <br/>
Most parent that I know with Autistic children work really hard to stop the<br/>
stims.  I don&#39;t see this as a problem.  Amanda does it when she is<br/>
overwhelmed.  For me, they are a clue that she needs comforting, a change in<br/>
activity, etc.  I see it as just part of who she is.  I have been to parent<br/>
support groups and have been involved with online support and parents<br/>
actually punish the children for exhibiting their stims.  I just accept that<br/>
this is a part of who Amanda is.  We certainly don&#39;t punish her or make fun<br/>
of her.  We use the stims as clues to something bigger.<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d just never heard of it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met Anne&#39;s Jacob. Sweet and gentle---and &quot;amazingly&quot; in control. We have <br/>
a couple of Aspie kids here in Columbia (I DO so wish they and their moms <br/>
would come to the conference!)---and I say &quot;amazingly&quot; because of the differences <br/>
I see between them and Jacob. Jacob &quot;owns&quot; so much of his world---and I&#39;m <br/>
SURE that&#39;s because of Anne (and Dave and Sam). She is always so aware of their <br/>
surroundings and their options. Their communication is a joy to watch.<br/>
