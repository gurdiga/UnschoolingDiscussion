<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171998335">I have been recently trying to talk empathetically to my 3 year old when she melts down. I say things like, &quot;wow, this sounds really frustrating&quot; and I hold her really close. Sometimes she tells me how scary it feels to be that way, and almost always once I have put everything down and stopped to reallyhold her and talk to her, the tantrum turns in to tears. This has proven to be much more effective and how nice to be heard and validated like that. Kelli<br/>

sure he&#39;d never get better.  (This would be relatively minor stuff -<br/>
sometimes scarier, like croup.)  His panic was interfering with his body&#39;s<br/>
ability to heal itself.  Often rescue remedy was the only thing he needed in<br/>
order to start healing himself.<br/>

also dab some on a raging kid&#39;s wrist or inside the elbow and it&#39;ll help a <br/>
great deal, then, too.  It&#39;s also helpful for companion animals (a dab <br/>
inside the ear flaps or in the drinking water).  One of the nice things <br/>
about Rescue Remedy is that you don&#39;t have to stress anyone out to give it <br/>
to them. :-)<br/>

P.S.  AA alert- a friend pointed out to me that there&#39;s a lot of alcohol in <br/>
Rescue Remedy, and she had been avoiding it for that reason. She didn&#39;t <br/>
realize that you can dab it on topically and it will work just as well. <br/>

Those can strike at home, though.  The other one only happens in WalMart. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I get exercise at my house by walking through six rooms and upstairs was in <br/>
there somewhere and looking around and realizing I can&#39;t remember what I needed <br/>
unless I go back to the first room and see what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
So it goes.  Exercise is good, I guess.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joyce says it so well...Joyce?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do I? (I seem to have missed the original of this.) Maybe you mean when I<br/>
point out that a tantrum is the last resort of a child who isn&#39;t being<br/>
heard. They&#39;ve gone through the skills they know to tell us they want<br/>
something and we&#39;re ignoring them or not taking them seriously or not<br/>
understanding. They don&#39;t have anything left but to melt down in supreme<br/>
frustration.<br/>
<br/>
If we tried to tell our husbands we were hungry or tired and they ignored<br/>
us, dismissed us, and told us to stop complaining for what felt like *hours*<br/>
we&#39;d likely melt down too!<br/>
<br/>
If a parent waits until the tantrum happens to try to understand what the<br/>
child wants, the child can learn that a tantrum is an effective means of<br/>
communication. They can learn to skip over the other ways of communication<br/>
and go straight to tantrum.<br/>
<br/>
In standard parenting practices that translates into ignore the tantrum so<br/>
they don&#39;t learn to use tantrums to &quot;manipulate&quot; the parent.<br/>
<br/>
Better -- *much* *much* better -- is to learn to listen to the child and<br/>
pick up the cues he&#39;s using to try to communicate before it ever gets to the<br/>
tantrum point. Then offer help or at least understanding. It may not avoid<br/>
the additional frustration of not getting their needs met, but at least<br/>
they&#39;ll feel they&#39;re being heard and their needs are understood and taken<br/>
seriously.<br/>
<br/>
And additionally thinking ahead to the types of things that cause melt downs<br/>
and preventing the situation in the first place, like making sure they&#39;re<br/>
well fed and rested before going shopping, maybe having a little bit of<br/>
money to spend or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
(Which doesn&#39;t address the highly sensitive child who may have frequent<br/>
meltdowns because of frustrations with life in general. In which case I&#39;d<br/>
say &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot; and &quot;The Explosive Child&quot;.)<br/>
