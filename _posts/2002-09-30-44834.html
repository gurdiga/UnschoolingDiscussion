<div id="ygrps-yiv-824854452">I love these dog stories....Deb L, that was a cute story.<br/>
  I guess I have been one of those folks that believed the reports<br/>
thinking that more study has been done showing that the theobromine (I<br/>
think that is what is in it) and caffeine is toxic. Avocados are supposed<br/>
to be toxic to dogs and teflon coating on irons,griddles etc. is toxic to<br/>
birds. I have heard several stories of birds dropping dead after an iron<br/>
was left on while the owner went into another room. The teflon off gasses<br/>
and leaves harmful fumes.<br/>
  we tried the raw meat diet with our pooch and it was gross! her breath<br/>
was terrible all of the time so we just put her back on the veggie diet<br/>
we eat and she was fine. we tried it as an experiment because we had seen<br/>
so much on it but there wasn&#39;t much change.We were open to feeding her<br/>
differently if it would keep her healthy. Boy, she was the perfect veggie<br/>
dog eating carrots, apple,almonds, tofu etc. She had a passion for bread<br/>
too.She was a typical dog though...she got sick sometimes and we cleaned<br/>
it up and went on with our day...kind of like for the kids.<br/>
  Thanks Sandra for expanding on the &quot;needs&quot; issue. I agree that we have<br/>
to be willing to re-look at our beliefs and see if they are valid. But<br/>
isn&#39;t that part of everyone&#39;s &quot;everyday&quot;? Living with kids?<br/>
  My kids challenge my thinking all of the time and  I have to go back<br/>
and re-think things through. Sometimes it is fun and other times<br/>
painful..All of it worth while!<br/>

carrots, apples...he will go through his whole array of tricks <br/>
before you can say a word...very funny.  To watch a 175 lb. puppy go <br/>
from stand to sit to down to sit to stand all in the matter of a <br/>

I&#39;m guessing your dog is large.  My friends have a little poodle-type dog<br/>
who got into a box of chocolates last Christmas.  He spent several days at<br/>
the vets and almost didn&#39;t make it.<br/>

it, but a whole chocolate bar could make a dog or cat seriously ill, even <br/>
kill it. That isn&#39;t a fallacy at all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a substance in chocolate that is deadly for dogs and cats. There&#39;s<br/>
some in milk chocolate. More in semi-sweet. And loads in baker&#39;s chocolate.<br/>
Here&#39;s something for a website:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Theobromine, caffeine and theophylline [in tea] are all naturally occurring<br/>
&gt;&gt; molecules that are found in several foods, plants, beverages and human and<br/>
&gt;&gt; veterinary medications.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BTW, according to The Straight Dope, chocolate is the 3rd most common<br/>
poisoning in dogs. The first is rat and mouse poison. The second is<br/>
Advil/ibuprofen. Apparently dogs love the smell of ibuprofen and will chew<br/>
right through the container and gobble them down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Milk chocolate is obtained from seeds of theobroma cacao after fermentation<br/>
&gt;&gt; and roasting. Milk chocolate has about 44 mg/ounce of theobromine; a 4.5 oz.<br/>
&gt;&gt; milk chocolate bar has about 240 mgs. of theobromine. Unsweetened baking<br/>
&gt;&gt; chocolate has even more -- about 390 to 450 mgs of theobromine per ounce.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Relative theobromine content per ounce for various products is:<br/>
&gt;&gt; Milk chocolate: 44 - 60 mgs/ounce<br/>
&gt;&gt; Unsweetened baking chocolate: 450 mg/oz<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cacao meal: 300 - 900 mg/oz<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cacao beans: 300 - 1200 mg/oz<br/>
&gt;&gt; Hot chocolate: 13 mg/oz<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The lethal dosage of theobromine in dogs is between 250 and 500 mgs/kg, or<br/>
&gt;&gt; about 2/3 to 1 1/3 of baking chocolate for every 2.2 pounds of body weight.<br/>
&gt;&gt; However, serious non-fatal poisonings have been reported in dogs after eating<br/>
&gt;&gt; smaller amounts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I keep hearing this one. It&#39;s usually mentioned in conjunction with <br/>
dark chocolate (what Americans would call semi-sweet I guess <br/>
where the cocoa content os 80% - proper chocolate)<br/>
My Shih Tzu once ate all the choclate decorations from the xmas <br/>
tree when he was 2. Apart from the unusual turds he was fine and <br/>
live until he was 15 when a vaccine killed him :-(<br/>
