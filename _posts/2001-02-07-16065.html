<div id="ygrps-yiv-207435173">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
My son and I were out shopping and he had $2 to spend.  He saw a small<br/>
silver shiny toy pistle.  I said those guns were made mostly just for<br/>
killing people.  He decided not to buy it and bought a small flashlight<br/>
instead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160982634">My dh was 14yrs old when he went Duck shoting with his uncle.  his <br/>
uncle went every year, and was a *careful* hunter.<br/>
On this day, for some reason the gun ahd been leant up against a <br/>
fence loaded and ready to fire. It began to fall over and uncle <br/>
reached over to catch it - too late, it went off, shooting my dh in <br/>
the ankle. It blow away his ankle - he was unconcious for 3 days from <br/>
loss of blood. Because thay were a long way from a road, it took <br/>
considerable time to get to the hospital.<br/>
dh had to have a muscle graft - skin graft and bone graft. He still <br/>
has the scars 20 yrs later.  He was in hospital for 3 months and when <br/>
he did go home, was in a wheel chair for several weeks.<br/>
Accidents can/will always happen.  So yes, if one must have a gun, <br/>
safty precautions MUST be taught.<br/>
I do not like guns and will not have them in the house.<br/>

You are right that accidents do happen.  However, Id<br/>
like to point out a line of thinking that doesnt quite<br/>
make sense to me.  Its normal but I want to stimulate<br/>
some thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
You have chosen to not have guns in your home because<br/>
of the accident.  Do you also choose not to have<br/>
vehicles?  Cars have killed people.<br/>
<br/>
Many children have died from toys.  Will you no longer<br/>
allow toys in the home because they have killed<br/>
children?<br/>
<br/>
People have killed people.  Will they also be banned?<br/>
<br/>
Ridiculous thinking?  Sure it is.  But, were teaching<br/>
our children that people are not the ones who are<br/>
hurting and killing others.<br/>
<br/>
By saying an inatimate, unfeeling object is<br/>
responsible for killing something, were teaching our<br/>
children that people are not responsible for the<br/>
things that they do.<br/>
<br/>
The saying &quot;Guns Dont Kill People, People Kill People&quot;<br/>
is nothing but the truth and I what I teach my child. <br/>
Guns do not get up all be themselves and kill.  A<br/>
person must pick it up, load it and pull the trigger.<br/>
<br/>
We prosecute the drunk that got in their car, drove<br/>
and killed someone.  Do we blame the car, the drinks?<br/>
<br/>
How can children grow up to be responsible individuals<br/>
if were teaching them they dont have to be?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7645104">I&#39;m going to ask this question in the most innocent, or perhaps <br/>
ignorant way I can think of - Aren&#39;t guns made for doing one thing, <br/>
and one thing only?<br/>
<br/>
O.K., I know there are decorative guns (see, everything IS subjective <br/>
to perception!) and there are collector&#39;s or antique guns.  Do these <br/>
guns have live ammunition to go with them usually (I honestly do not <br/>
know)?  Guns that are used for target practice, do they have to have <br/>
live ammunition with them or can you use blanks?<br/>
<br/>
I only ask these questions because guns seem to be one type of item <br/>
that is manufactured expressly for the purpose to kill.  I recognize <br/>
that almost any household item or personal affect could be *turned <br/>
into* something that&#39;s lethal, but not directly designed for it.  I <br/>
do not question the validity of the statement, &quot;Guns Don&#39;t Kill <br/>
People, People kill People&quot;.  I&#39;m wondering if comparing guns to <br/>
automobiles, toys, household items or the millions of other dangers <br/>
in our lives is a fair comparison.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also wondering if a child gets a hold of a loaded gun and shoots <br/>
himself or someone else, accidently, does the &quot;Guns Don&#39;t Kill...&quot; <br/>
statement hold true?<br/>

**Chris, we have guns for protection. If that means kill someone in order to<br/>
protect myself or my family, so be it. Fortunately, it&#39;s never come down to<br/>
that with anyone I know. (I take that back...I know someone who killed<br/>
someone else in self-defense, but it was with a sword.) My husband&#39;s entire<br/>
family and nearly all their friends have guns. You&#39;d never know it, but they<br/>
are armed nearly at all times. We enjoy target shooting. In all the<br/>
generations of their gun ownership, there&#39;s never been an accident or a case<br/>
of a child getting ahold of a gun. Not that they are cocky about that. They<br/>
take it very seriously.<br/>
<br/>
When/if my daughters want to learn to shoot we&#39;ll have them take a<br/>
marksmanship course, and a gun safety course. I took one with my mil and we<br/>
had a great time.<br/>

driving.  We tow and impound cars that are used in various illegal acts<br/>
(including DUIs), so in essence we are &quot;punishing&quot; the object as well as the<br/>
owner, technically &lt;g&gt;  And if a vehicle is too unsafe, we crush the sucker<br/>
and melt it down and make it into something else.<br/>

violence to solve problems possibly be teaching kids to be irresponsible<br/>

&lt;&lt; Guns that are used for target practice, do they have to have <br/>
live ammunition with them or can you use blanks? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Blanks can kill people too; I need to say that.<br/>
<br/>
Swords are made for killing too.  At least rifles are made to kill animals <br/>
for food or protections.  Nobody goes deer hunting with a sword.  <br/>
<br/>
Then again, kids don&#39;t accidently kill each other much with swords.<br/>
<br/>
We have a hatchet in the den, which I use to split kindling, and it hangs on <br/>
the wall, low, in easy reach.  When little kids (toddlers) come over, I put <br/>
it up high.  <br/>
<br/>
But out in the garage we have all kinds of power tools and hammers and <br/>
screwdrivers, and those could be used to kill people, even in the movies.<br/>
<br/>
Even if a simple question is answered about handguns being designed for <br/>
interpersonal business, it doesn&#39;t make them the only dangerous thing in <br/>
anyone&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
People who have been in the military or law enforcement often come to have an <br/>
affinity for the tools they&#39;re trained to use--clubs, sticks, swords, guns, <br/>
missile launchers, helicopters, whatever.  Some of those are cooler and have <br/>
a more fascinating history than others.<br/>
<br/>
I can see and understand the fascination, I just don&#39;t personally have it.  <br/>
We can&#39;t kill that fascination by talking about it, though.  We can scare <br/>
some people into hiding the ammo better and locking the guns up, but the <br/>
history of firearms is totally interesting to many people, and there are <br/>
bright people I know and respect who have it, and I see it in their eyes, and <br/>
they never want to kill anybody and they&#39;re very careful.<br/>

toys that I thought were positive and empowering. We never really ran into <br/>
relatives buying them, probably because they knew we&#39;d have issues with it.  <br/>
He never did much of the gun play thing at all. When he was little he only <br/>
watched PBS on tv, so it&#39;s possible it never occurred to him to imagine a <br/>
gun. (It amuses me now, but he also didn&#39;t have any sugar until well after <br/>
two!)<br/>
<br/>
Now he has Super Soakers, which I definitely had a twinge about. But how cool <br/>
ARE these things?!  Interestingly, he always refers to them as Super Soakers <br/>
(&quot;Want to go play with the Super Soakers?&quot;), never as guns. It might be fear <br/>
of Mama Disapproval, but I really believe it&#39;s just commercial influence.<br/>

also colored the way I think... When we were growing up we had toy guns, <br/>
water pistols and cap guns.... BUT there was no chance of us getting a real <br/>
gun when we got older and it never entered out head.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that I live in America I don&#39;t let my son have guns... He doesn&#39;t even <br/>
know what one is (a) he&#39;s not exposed to television programs that have them <br/>
in it (b) not exposed to children who play with guns (maybe that will change <br/>
and I&#39;ll deal with it when it happens)..... Whenever he goes to someone&#39;s <br/>
house for a playdate that is new to us I ask them whether they have guns.... <br/>
(I mean real ones) and if the answer is yes, Zak doesn&#39;t go.... They are <br/>
welcome to come to our home, but I&#39;m not sending my child to a house where <br/>
there are guns....<br/>
