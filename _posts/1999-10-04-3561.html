<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352034265"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I get accused of sounding preachy as well.  It goes with the territory when<br/>
&gt;you are living an alternative lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that is very true.  Any time that any part of your lifestyle is<br/>
outside the norm you find yourself making explanations and qualifications<br/>
to others on a regular basis.  You may run into other who expect you to<br/>
defend your choices, or those who are truly interested in learning more<br/>
about you and your choices, or those who want to follow your lead.<br/>
Whatever the case may be, you end up getting pretty old hat with your<br/>
responses, and even sometimes getting &quot;on a roll&quot; with your answer and<br/>
ending up sounding more passionate than the situation may find appropriate.<br/>
 Then one can sound very &quot;preachy&quot; indeed.  It is sometimes hard to avoid<br/>
sounding that way when you feel that you have something worthwhile to share<br/>
and especially if you care anything about the recipient.<br/>
