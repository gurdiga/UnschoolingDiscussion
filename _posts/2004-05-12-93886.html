<div id="ygrps-yiv-823246039">This came from a friend of mine... I haven&#39;t been able to turn up<br/>
anything, and thought perhaps someone here might have an answer? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;A couple years ago, I stumbled across a website that showed a<br/>
three-dimensional representation of the world, universe, cosmos,<br/>
whatever as believed by the ancient Greeks.  The picture showed a sphere<br/>
in which the earth, a general disc shape, stood with Olympus sticking up<br/>
from the top of the disc, the underworld growing out underneath, the<br/>
ocean surrounding the disc (&#39;cause they thought it was a river that just<br/>
went in a circle), etc.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have looked EVERYWHERE that I can think of, trying every combination<br/>
of words like &quot;Ancient Greek world&quot; etc., and I can&#39;t find the picture.<br/>
Want a challenge? GO FORTH!  SEEK!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyone? It&#39;s rare that I&#39;m stumped to find something on the &#39;net, but<br/>
this one has my brain just about fried.<br/>
