<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031568664">&lt;&lt;when it comes to TV and computer stuff, he would go on forever&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would he really?  He isn&#39;t willing to stop watching television to make<br/>
cookies, play with the video camera (my Zach just discovered this and loves<br/>
it), go fishing, a trip to the zoo, whatever?<br/>
<br/>
Do you sit and watch with him?  My kids watch such &quot;educational&quot; shows as<br/>
&quot;The A-Team&quot; and &quot;Lizzy Macquire&quot;.  When we watch together it almost never<br/>
fails to spark some interesting discussion.  We talk ethics, history,<br/>
religion, economy, all kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
I am a big believer in not sitting on your behind all day so I get myself<br/>
busy and lo and behold, here come the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Does any of the above sound familiar to you?  Why is it that you want him to<br/>
watch less television?  Just a thought from a mom of 2 very rambunctious<br/>
boys thrown in with some fantastic girls----If you are trying to get the kid<br/>
to &quot;control his wilds&quot; after television or any other time, I think you may<br/>
have already set up an uphill battle for yourself.<br/>
