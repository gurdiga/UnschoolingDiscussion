Both of these stories reminded me when I was in 4th grade and my mom had to <br/>
pick me up at some odd time. I raised my hand to get permission to leave and <br/>
the teacher called on me and I happily said, &quot;Mrs. Stewart, I have to go now, my <br/>
mom has an appontiment for a Blow Job.&quot; The teacher looked like she was <br/>
becoming a turnip she was so red. She demanded that I pick up my things and marched <br/>
me to the office. My mom came in to pick me up and was greeted with some ugly <br/>
snares. The school secratary asked why I was leaving early and my mom said <br/>
she had an appointment for her car. The secretary looked at her in such an odd <br/>
way. When we got in the car I asked my mom,&quot;Why is everyone so weird about you <br/>
getting a blow job on your car?&quot; She said, &quot;What?&quot; I said, &quot;Mommy, you said <br/>
you needed a blow job this morning.&quot; She started laughing hysterically and tears <br/>
ran down her cheeks. After  a while she quit laughing long enough to tell me <br/>
she need a lube job on the car, not a blow job. Which of course came my next <br/>
question, &quot;Then what the heck is a blow job?&quot; It was an interesting afternoon.<br/>

In sixth grade, I thought a blow job was a haircut. A nice haircut <br/>
blown dry with blowdryer. Don&#39;t know where I heard the term, but <br/>
using it in my context was an amusing lesson!<br/>

LOL!!! That&#39;s a classic. It&#39;s so nice to hear your mom got a kick out of it<br/>
too and not get mad at you. My mom would have had to ask me what it was. My<br/>
poor mother was so naive. She even now still spoils a good joke sometimes by<br/>
just not getting it. It&#39;s just not funny if you have to explain it!! She<br/>
actually had to have one of the nuns from the school I went to explain what<br/>
knockers were.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the story!!<br/>

and I had chosen subliminal advertising.  I got the the part about colors <br/>
conveying different  emotions/feelings, etc, and said, &quot;For instance, red would <br/>

keh-nig-it is the PHONETIC pronunciation of the word knight &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At one time (post-King Arthur, if there was one &lt;g&gt;) it was pronounced (so <br/>
say the Middle English scholars) &quot;k NICht e&quot;  (the first and last sounds not <br/>
quite full syllables and the middle one having a kind of German top-of-mouth <br/>
hoik).  And &quot;sword&quot;  had its &#39;w&#39; pronouced (as in the unrelated &quot;swarthy&quot;) and <br/>
&quot;castle&quot; had a vague syllable at the end so it sounded a little more like <br/>
&quot;castille&quot; but not much.<br/>
