&gt;<br/>
&gt; BlankHi All,<br/>
&gt; I just had to share this.  My friend who is an avid unschooler, just lent<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me a book titled, &#39;The Unschooling Handbook&#39; by Mary Griffith.  It is a<br/>
wonderful book!  I couldn&#39;t put it down!  I have already read half of the<br/>
book today!  I recommend it to anyone who is unschooling, thinking about<br/>
unschooling, unschools but has doubts about their kids not learning<br/>
anything, READ IT!!!!  I wish that I would have found this book a long time<br/>
ago!<br/>

Yes, TTLH is very heady stuff, isn&#39;t it? I plan to have my always<br/>
unschooled, completely unappreciative 11 year old daughter read it at some<br/>
point. Maybe she&#39;ll better understand how free she is by comparison.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is one I&#39;ve been meaning to read. I hear great things about it, but I&#39;ve <br/>
been on a book budget lately and have to be quite careful how I spend. I tend <br/>
to get carried away at the bookstore. I&#39;m currently reading Summerhill A <br/>
Radical Approach  to Child Rearing by A.S. Neill. A bit freudian for my <br/>
tastes, but definitely lots of food for thought. I found it for 5 bucks.<br/>
