&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;  My dd has money for what she <br/>
  needs/wants because she&#39;s part of the family and not old enough to make it <br/>
 on <br/>
  her own, and she helps because it&#39;s the right thing to do.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 Does anybody know of a book that advocates this type of arrangement with <br/>
kids?<br/>
 Thanks,<br/>
