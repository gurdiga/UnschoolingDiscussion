&lt;&lt; I think since this is an unschooling message board, I&#39;d rather keep to that<br/>
 topic if you don&#39;t mind.  Thanks for offering to discuss the ADD issue<br/>
 though :)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It has everything to do with unschooling though, that&#39;s why I offered. I <br/>
understand not wanting to discuss it, that&#39;s cool. After unschooling a while <br/>
you may find the label unecessary.<br/>
