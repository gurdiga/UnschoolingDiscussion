<div id="ygrps-yiv-636147207">&quot; What I need to know is is it possible to<br/>
network two computers for home use as opposed to getting a third phone<br/>
line? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way when you&#39;re on dial up, is to buy some network cable<br/>
and plug both into a hub or router. The hub&#39;s work fine for dial-up in<br/>
our experience, but you can&#39;t use them for cable.<br/>
The hubs seem to be going by the wayside.<br/>
We just got a router that can be wireless or use the network cable<br/>
(not cheap, so try to position the computers as close as possible) but<br/>
with our new computer it was a nightmare to set up.<br/>
<br/>
It ended up taking three days, a return and about 4 tech calls, even<br/>
with a computer geek in the house that had tried virtually everything<br/>
including messing with the ip addresses.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, most routers automatically walk you through the set up.<br/>
