<div id="ygrps-yiv-215011365">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to add that in Perth Australia - where I am originally from -<br/>
we have one of the highest rate of children diagnosed with ADD per capita in<br/>
the world. What I have noticed with some of the children that I know who<br/>
have been diagnosed with ADD is the family life is so structured and too<br/>
much is happening in the childs life. ie/ school, afterschool sports 3<br/>
nights a week and on Saturday plus their parents busy social life. When does<br/>
the child ever get the chance to take a breather and to organise their<br/>
thought processes - a classic case of the hurried child syndrome for some of<br/>
these children.<br/>
<br/>
 I also found with one family that their home life has become explosive and<br/>
they would comment on how well their boy would do with me and how calm he<br/>
would be - All I did was stop and listen to him and join in on activities<br/>
with him ie/ experiments he would do. I would video tape them and make a<br/>
commentry on them. This experiement was the same one that his mother said no<br/>
to immediately and that it was dangerous - I said that I could look into it<br/>
for her and him and she said fine you can do it with him and we had a<br/>
pleasant afternoon - no hassles whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand that this boy is more intensive then most children and<br/>
living with him fulltime would be a challenge but I don&#39;t see the family<br/>
making any adjustments to suit his special needs. I think that person (sorry<br/>
forget who it was) did a wonderful thing for his nephews taking them on<br/>
holiday with them and his intentions came from a very good and loving place<br/>
(excluding the stopping of medication - not for or against just not educated<br/>
in that area to comment) but I  wonder if half the children diagnosed with<br/>
ADD are just reacting to an environment that they do not want/appreciate/or<br/>
need to be different for what ever reasons but to force them to remain in<br/>
that environment is harmful to them in a number of ways!!!<br/>
