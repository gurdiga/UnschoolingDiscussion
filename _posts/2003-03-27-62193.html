<div id="ygrps-yiv-796062146">Tell me, how much vinegar do you put in?<br/>
<br/>
Could it relate to how hard or soft one&#39;s water is, whether clothes come out<br/>
soft?  Our stuff gets pretty stiff without fabric softener.  I have a downy<br/>
ball, but use the less expensive store brand.  And I bought it based on my<br/>
mom&#39;s recommendation, not a commercial.<br/>
<br/>
Elevator music plays in background.  I am sitting on the divan, wearing<br/>
pearls and playing Monopoly Jr with two neatly groomed, smiling children.<br/>
&quot;Before my Downy ball, I was always on edge, waiting to hear the clothes<br/>
washer go into the rinse cycle.  I had to drop whatever I was doing to rush<br/>
in and pour the fabric softener in.  Now I am free to enjoy my children, as<br/>
nature intended.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I usually do 1/2 cup. You may want to start with 1 cup the first time, to <br/>
remove buildup of soap and softeners on your clothes. I know that towels <br/>
rinsed with vinegar come out smelling so fresh and clean, no perfumey scents. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wish I still had one.  One came free with Downey years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Our washing machine is down until next week when parts come in.  It&#39;s nearly <br/>
as old as Marty is.  It needs a whole new agitator-everything.<br/>
<br/>
My van is down.  Transmission in all its pieces on a bench at the shop.<br/>
<br/>
So... Yesterday Keith took me and Holly to a laundramat, where we did the <br/>
three most crucial loads and read books.  I read about conjoined twins in the <br/>
Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  She had planned to read a Happy Hollisters <br/>
book, but was frustrated with long words, so looked through the ads in <br/>
whatever women&#39;s magazine has Bruce Willis on the front.<br/>
<br/>
I saw it as a frightening evil laundramat, and me there without a car.<br/>
<br/>
Holly saw it as a very cool place, an adventure, a time to be alone with me.<br/>
<br/>
I think Holly might voluntarily choose laundramat over home-machines when <br/>
she&#39;s older.  I&#39;m serious.  She saw it as something social, and efficient (to <br/>
have all that stuff in one place and do more than one load at a time).  I saw <br/>
it as something for people who can&#39;t afford a washing machine, and I kept <br/>
being reminded of the ghostly little girl in me whose mom made us be still, <br/>
sit down, be quiet at the public laundry when I was a kid (which is still <br/>
there, in a half a quanset hut stuck on another building, in my home town.  I <br/>
saw it a few months ago.  Same name and everything).<br/>
<br/>
So... the consumerism is me and my washing machine, proof of income and <br/>
status.<br/>
<br/>
For Holly, her baggage is light and she was actually looking at the <br/>
comparison without ANY thought of wringer washers, clotheslines in the desert <br/>
when the sandstorms are coming, NONE of the compex laundry trauma inside of <br/>
me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think she will make some really great decisions in her life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420238902">This is quite possibly the stupidest question of the entire discussion.<br/>
What the heck is fabric softener for and why do so many people use it?<br/>
Our clothes are already soft.  They don&#39;t stick together, which is what<br/>
those dryer sheets are for (isn&#39;t it?).  I&#39;ve used vinegar in the rinse<br/>
for cloth diapers, but not to soften them.  They&#39;re already soft and if<br/>
I knew it was for that, I wouldn&#39;t have done it.  I read a website about<br/>
cloth diapers once that said to use a vinegar rinse and I assumed it was<br/>
to kill germs or something. <br/>

<br/>
Hard water and static electricity.<br/>
Where we live, in New Mexico, it&#39;s a necessity.  <br/>
<br/>
I use dryer sheets.  If I didn&#39;t, the clothes would be lint collectors, or <br/>
really stiff (depending on the fabric) and anything with polyester would give <br/>
you a pretty serious shock when you pulled it out of the dryer  (not a <br/>
surprising shock, an electrical shock worse than sliding across the carpet <br/>
and touching someone).<br/>
<br/>
The fabric softener keeps the minerals from the water from depositing <br/>
themselves on the cloth as it dries, and they somehow stop the electrical <br/>
buildup of the dry air with artificial fibers in the spinning chamber.  They <br/>
separate lint from clothes somehow too.  A mystery to  me.<br/>
<br/>
If you live in a humid place with soft water, then you may not need any.  <br/>

<br/>
You  might as well stop doing things just because articles say to without <br/>
knowing WHY they said so! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
