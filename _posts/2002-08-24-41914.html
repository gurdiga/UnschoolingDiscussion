&gt; So isn&#39;t there a local support group challenging this outrageous<br/>
&gt; situtation? If not, why not start one?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t a support group, it&#39;s a discussion list. Pretty big difference.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t say this was a support group. I presume, however, that most of the<br/>
listers are members of them, some in the state that levies fines for<br/>
non-attendance of school.<br/>
<br/>
I also did not suggest that anyone on this list should do the challenging.<br/>
<br/>
 I also did not bring up the subject of the fines for truancy or the new<br/>
threat in CA. I am participating in the existing discussions.    NV</div>
