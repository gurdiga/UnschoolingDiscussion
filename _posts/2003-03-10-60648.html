 <br/>
Yes, that&#39;s called &quot;en loci parentis&quot; or something (Latin for &quot;in place<br/>
of the parents&quot;).  By sending kids to a public school, parents are<br/>
giving the school parental authority over those children.  That&#39;s why<br/>
they can search a locker without a search warrant, etc.  I learned that<br/>
in my high school law class.  <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a guy in Albuquerque who&#39;s always painting and repainting the low <br/>
cinderblock wall of his yard with political stuff.  It&#39;s his wall, though.  <br/>
City building code people could probably cite something or other, but since <br/>
he repaints it frequently, what could they say?<br/>

But *I* don&#39;t have the right to go and post something on his wall.<br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to make up posters (even 8.5x11 flyers) about unschooling, where <br/>
could I tape them up?  Any store or window, I&#39;d need permission from the <br/>
owner.  Could I tape them up at the university?  They&#39;re supposed to have <br/>
approval of someone, and be stamped with the removal date.  Could I tape them <br/>
at the state capitol building?  City Hall?  Federal courthouse?   So it&#39;s not <br/>
even a matter of whether taxpayer money paid for the building.   <br/>

Most parking lots in town, I&#39;d be violating code or littering if I passed <br/>

Pretty much, yes.<br/>

I think that punishment wasn&#39;t really necessary to get their point across. <br/>
Now if the kid asked and the answer was no and he continued doing it, I can <br/>
understand. But it seems to me they could have just made him take them all <br/>
down. If he refused, then it&#39;s a different story again. Detention seems <br/>
stupid but then again most schools do to me anyway. I stay out of school <br/>
business. Might seem like I&#39;m part of the problem but I&#39;m just not <br/>
interested. My local Target was shocked when I wouldn&#39;t give them a school <br/>
name to donate proceeds to from my credit card there. (money doesn&#39;t come <br/>
from me)<br/>
