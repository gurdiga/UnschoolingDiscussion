develop a legible signature, unlike two of his three parents. I know it was <br/>
MY stuff, told him I knew it was MY stuff, and offered him (something, can&#39;t <br/>
remember what) if he&#39;d do it. He was very clear that  he could say, no, not <br/>
interested, and that would be that. He was willing to do it without the <br/>
&quot;bribe,&quot; because he knew it mattered to me, but I figured he deserved the <br/>
&quot;bribe&quot; anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Julian has a bunch of tasks that are his around the house. These are not <br/>
assigned chores or anything -- they are tasks that need to be done, and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t mind doing them. As a result, he does all the laundry for the family. <br/>
He doesn&#39;t fold, because he hates that. If we&#39;re running out of stuff, we&#39;ll <br/>
ask him if he&#39;d throw a load in, and he never refuses, even though he knows <br/>
he certainly could.<br/>
<br/>
It occurs to me that some of this might be because he&#39;s an only child with <br/>
three parents. He&#39;s never hurting for attention, and sees himself as a <br/>
partner in the running of the household. I suspect when there are more kids <br/>
or fewer parents, the dynamics change considerably. I dunno.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I offer to pay my kids to do something they dont&#39; necessarily want to do, especially if its something I don&#39;t want to do either :o).<br/>
<br/>
But they have the choice to say no.<br/>
<br/>
Often its the neighbors that will come over and help out, and then I might take them somewhere for a treat.<br/>
<br/>
I figure as long as its mutual consent, and they are free to say no, I don&#39;t think it does any harm.  And I soooooo appreciate it when they do the dishes &lt;grin&gt;  because I HATE doing the dishes!!<br/>
<br/>
They know how much I appreciate it...because nowadays they actually offer with a &quot;price&quot; in mind, and then I&#39;ll agree or disagree with the price.<br/>

I suspect you&#39;re right. Here. it&#39;s Brianna & me. She knows she can say &quot;No&quot; to this or that - but she loves to powwow, she knows I have lots of back trouble. - so she willingly does this or that.<br/>
She came in earlier and asked if there was anything she could do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876828047">I have seen bribery mentioned at times and I have gotten more comfortable at using it<br/>
*in certain circumstances*. For example, my boys do not like going to the food store<br/>
so I usually try to go in the evening when dh is home. Has been working great. Every<br/>
once in awhile there is something that I really need and I have to go during the day<br/>
 In this case I &quot;bribe&quot; them with a donut or cookie from the bakery or we<br/>
pick up ice cream on the way home. I have come to see it not as bribery though and<br/>
more as appreciating the fact that they are doing something they don&#39;t like. I do<br/>
not tie it in to how they behave or anything, just more as a &quot;I know that you hate<br/>
it so hopefully this will make it more enjoyable for you&quot;.<br/>
