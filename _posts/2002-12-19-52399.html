conventional school attendance, to home school their children who are at <br/>
least age 7 but not yet age 16 must: <br/>
Send to the Division of Non-Public Education (DNPE) a Notice of Intent to <br/>
Operate a School.  The notice must include the name and address of the school <br/>
along with the name of the school&#39;s owner and chief administrator; <br/>
Hold at least a high school diploma or its equivalent; <br/>
Elect to operate under either &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.doa.state.nc.us/dnpe/hhh108.htm&quot;">http://www.doa.state.nc.us/dnpe/hhh108.htm&quot;</a>&gt;Part 1 or Part 2 of Article 39 of the North <br/>
Carolina General Statutes&lt;/A&gt; as a religious or as a non-religious school; <br/>
Operate the school &quot;on a regular schedule, excluding reasonable holidays and <br/>
vacations, during at least nine calendar months of the year&#39;&#39;; <br/>
Maintain at the school disease immunization and annual &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.doa.state.nc.us/dnpe/hhh125.htm&quot;">http://www.doa.state.nc.us/dnpe/hhh125.htm&quot;</a>&gt;attendance records&lt;/A&gt; for <br/>
each student; <br/>
Have a nationally standardized achievement test administered annually to each <br/>
student.  The test must involve the subject areas of English grammar, <br/>
reading, spelling, and mathematics.  Records of the test results must be <br/>
retained at the school for at least one year and made available to DNPE when <br/>
requested; <br/>
Notify DNPE when the school is no longer in operation. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t say what test to use or who has to administer it or what grade you <br/>
must test at etc etc.  We use a computer test that is like playing a computer <br/>
game.  I don&#39;t tell my boys that it is a test, I just let them do it and file <br/>
it away.<br/>
