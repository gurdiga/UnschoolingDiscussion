&lt;&lt;  have thought of food allergies - does anyone have any resources on an <br/>
 elimination diet?  I am unsure of how to approach finding out if he has food <br/>

Your might want to do a web search for Feingold Association of the United <br/>
States, or look at the library for books by Dr. Ben (?) Feingold&#39;s approach <br/>
to all sorts of physical, emotional, and learning/attention problems.        <br/>
