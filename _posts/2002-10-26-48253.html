&gt; have found this way of life and with the help and support of others we can <br/>
&gt; lick these unhealthy/dysfunctional behaviors. <br/>
&gt; If you ever need to vent like I do,  go ahead and e-mail me.<br/>

&gt; I know some of you will wonder where this comes into unschooling, but for <br/>
&gt; those of us who grew up this way, its much harder to live a free, joyful <br/>
&gt; life and to me that is what unschooling can be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for being here, everyone!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so right on! And every time I read someone complaining that the posts <br/>
aren&#39;t *nice* enough, or that the list should be changed, or that the list <br/>
doesn&#39;t reflect how they *think* unschooling should be I think about this. <br/>
And how beautiful most days can be for me. And how glad I am to have this <br/>
list on the not so beautiful days. <br/>
