<div id="ygrps-yiv-9195017">Dear Laura...<br/>
How refreshing to hear these words from you ...I must say that I &#39;sing from<br/>
the same songbook&#39; as you. I , too, long for the curriculum that embraces a<br/>
period of history or a set of biographies. <br/>
I too...loved school. And your words in brackets were mine as well. (that<br/>
is why we do what we do....right!)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that it is a &quot;bizarre addiction&quot; just a natural feeling that<br/>
some of the learning you did in an organized setting was extememly<br/>
positive. Isn&#39;t homelearning all about acceptance of ourselves AND our<br/>
children...about our different learning times together? Accept  your<br/>
gut-feeling and try a Sonlight Curriculum. Variety is the spice of life.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;bliss. I loved school, and I want to do it all over with my kids. I can see<br/>
&gt;the damage school did to me (I was the A student who desperately feared to<br/>
&gt;fail, who learned for the test and then forgot, who excelled in pleasing<br/>
&gt;diverse teachers to the detriment of my actual education). But still, I<br/>
&gt;loved school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Am I the only unschooler who secretly drools over the Sonlight catalog? And<br/>
&gt;how can I loose myself from this bizarre addiction to learning plans?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710786290">Dear Laura,<br/>
<br/>
  I agree with your DH--give yourself the gift of the curriculum if it means<br/>
that much to you.<br/>
<br/>
The other option, if you are willing to spend the money, is to buy all of<br/>
the supplies with no expectations. I know that my mother bought truckloads<br/>
of &quot;learning tools&quot; that neither my brother nor I ever touched. We would<br/>
pick up some of the material and I do admit that my mother had a great and<br/>
subtle influence over what we focused upon (I mean, if Mom&#39;s interested in<br/>
doing something with you, why not give it a look-see?), but a lot of the<br/>
books and the like went to relative waste. She might have had a form of the<br/>
same problem you face.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be married to anything. You can and--I would argue--should bring<br/>
educational material into the house. You can even heavily push for certain<br/>
texts or material and be well within the bounds of &quot;unschooling&quot;, I think.<br/>
To me, at least, unschooling is the freedom to follow your passions. If the<br/>
kids are interested in Sonlight, that&#39;s awesome. If not, there will be other<br/>
cool things out there. As a lifelong unschooler (now 20), to me unschooling<br/>
is not anti curriculum. It is just anti forced-curriculum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073014195">I think that it also depends on the child... whether or not to use<br/>
curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
I have one dd (10 years old) who loves workbooks and Five in a Row type<br/>
programs. She goes through the catalogues and picks out things she enjoys.<br/>
It works for her. <br/>
My other dd (8 yrs. old) HATES anything that is organized by ME. However,<br/>
she will organize all sorts of amazing things on her own. She despises<br/>
workbooks...and , silly me, (I should know better after 5 years of learning<br/>
with them) I ordered her workbooks because her sister loved them. I soon<br/>
learned that I had wasted money...her  eyeroll gave it away and the big<br/>
sigh, too. <br/>
The workbooks got tossed or sold at a used curriculum sale. <br/>
<br/>
Allowing the children to choose is not a bad idea. Viva la difference!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Peter, you&#39;ve just made every mother on this list breathe deeply again. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s rather difficult to admit you&#39;ve bought all this neato<br/>
cool---to mom--looking stuff and the kids aren&#39;t even interested in seeing<br/>
it come out of the box.<br/>
<br/>
I have tons of things in the house, but dh made me admit early on that it&#39;s<br/>
really stuff for me. Yes, the kids use some of it and a few things have been<br/>
absolutely magical for a child or two, but all in all we have lots of unused<br/>
stuff too.  But hey, some of my kids are still little so who knows what<br/>
they&#39;ll use.<br/>
