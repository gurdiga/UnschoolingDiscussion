<div id="ygrps-yiv-441697245">Anonymous, please.  Some has been paraphrased by me.<br/>
<br/>
__________<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like the advice of the group anonymously please and your feedback too.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (8) is sensitive, and thinks and talks about death<br/>
<br/>
In the past month or so she says that she is hearing voices. She&#39;s told me twice. Once a few weeks ago and said the voice is a boy and is asking her to do or say bad things. <br/>
<br/>
The bad things were wanting to swear at people and hurting her soft toys  (she loves them usually and treats them as real animals). She was going off into the other room and asking for privacy.<br/>
<br/>
Today she was distraught and told me she heard the voices again and while I was on the toilet, literally away from her for a couple of minutes, it told her to hurt our guinea pigs. She said she took one out of the cage and shook it and put it back. We have permanent pets and often take in rescues and foster animals and she loves them so this is so completely out of character. <br/>
<br/>
Both times she has found it very hard to tell me and said she really wanted to but it was so hard. <br/>
<br/>
I try to tell her no matter what I can help her and will help her with the voices. I wanted to know more but didn&#39;t want to push her into talking about it more when it was obviously so hard. <br/>
<br/>
I said if they are thoughts, you can choose to listen to them or push them away somehow. When she&#39;s had anxiety before, we&#39;ve tried to use the strategy of not feeding the anxiety too much just talking about it but not too much that it takes over. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked her to tell me if she&#39;s hearing them again to let me know ASAP so that we can try and cope with them together. I said I noticed she was going off again but really want her to be able to have private moments if she wants them because we are together almost 24/7, but she said that if she does again, she would like me to come and follow her.<br/>
<br/>
With the dying feeling, it helped her to become friends with it. We used to say hi to it and just recognize it was about, talk about the feelings and to the dying feeling as if it was an actual entity, and that really helped and she barely has those feelings anymore. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve looked up online and what I read said sometimes children hear voices after trauma but I can&#39;t honestly think of one big incident that has happened.<br/>
<br/>
We have just come back from a couple of months [distant elsewhere] and the transition period is hard. And we usually nest at home for quite a while which we are doing now.<br/>
<br/>
She has also become anxious about going out at night time so we don&#39;t walk around at night at all anymore.  She is worried about seeing someone hurt an animal after seeing a group of boys throwing shoes at a cat sometime before we [left for the trip/visit].<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if it&#39;s connected, but she seems to be going through some signs of early puberty.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399049518">I would bet most people hear voices in the form of whispers and thoughts that form into words. It&#39;s just that for some people like your daughter the voices are clearer so sound like actual voices.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a voice that&#39;s talking to her, then she can talk back to it.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the problem is that it frightens her. Which makes her feel weak and small. Maybe some guided imagery will help her. Have her close her eyes and picture herself as strong and powerful. If she&#39;s a word lover, throw in some thesaurus words related to staunch. Build that picture up with her. Ask her what her hands look like. What do her arms look like. What is she wearing on her feet? What is she wearing on her head? What does her face look like. What does her strong face look like? What does her fierce face look like? <br/>
<br/>
Then ask her what her powerful self can say to the voice. Walk though several ideas until she finds one or a handful she likes. Have her speak forcefully, firmly, no nonsense. If she enjoys playing with the voices, she can also say it meekly, then a goofy voice, then an old lady voice. That way she&#39;s choosing the strong voice from several choices.<br/>
<br/>
Then she can picture the voice in her head. And go through responding to the various things the voice says. She could even tell it it&#39;s mommy is very disappointed in it for the things it says ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Probably the worst thing is that it&#39;s so unexpected. As with most unexpected new events, most people get scared and freeze up. And that freezing up makes the event scarier than it is. For most people falling down the stairs is frightening. They panic. They stiffen up. They flail. But stunt people practice exactly that. They know how to react when they fall so they don&#39;t get hurt because they&#39;ve practiced falling a lot. Before they practiced, it was scary for them too. And she can practice responding to the voice so when it happens she has ways to react.<br/>
<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t mind action, maybe watching movies about stunt people would help. She can see them doing things that would frighten most people but because they&#39;ve practiced a lot, it&#39;s easy for them. There&#39;s a good one about two stunt women, Jeannie Epper and Zoë Bell, one who did the stunts for Wonder Woman (and loads of other female characters) and the other who did the stunts for Xena and The Bride in Kill Bill. It&#39;s called Double Dare. (Netflix has it.)<br/>
<br/>
This might be less helpful than the guided imagery, but if she thinks she&#39;s the only one who hears voices, perhaps showing her the idea of shoulder angels would help. The idea that we have both a self serving voice and a social voice in our heads is as old as our social brains. But people have been writing about the idea in terms of angels for nearly 2000 years.<br/>
<br/>
This one&#39;s cute. And acrobatic too :-)<br/>

<p dir="ltr">I agree with the others to look into therapy with some of the referrals listed on the site and see where that leads you. </p><p dir="ltr"><br></p>

 feelings, openly. &nbsp;if the mom is anxious or fearful, find someone with whom those feelings can be faced, expressed, expunged, transformed, etc - hiding doesn&#39;t work. &nbsp;(I&#39;m not saying this is happening, or blaming the mom, just pointing to a possibility)</span></font></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176"><font style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176" color="#3f3f3f"><span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176" clear="none"></span></font></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176"><font style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176" color="#3f3f3f"><span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176">what I would do is find more times and places to help her feel her own power, strength, and resilience, and confront any feelings of fear or resistance in myself. &nbsp;</span></font></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176"><font style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176" color="#3f3f3f"><span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176" clear="none"></span></font></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176"><font style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176" color="#3f3f3f"><span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-228232176"

 &nbsp;Counseling may help. &nbsp;It will get better with time. &nbsp;Good luck.</div></div></html></div>
