<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033257624">I just had to share a little zap of insight I had this weekend. I have a<br/>
good friend is very much a &quot;send them all to school&quot; person. She does<br/>
respect my choice to unschool, at least she never lets on that she<br/>
disapproves. Ironically, my friend is the person who introduced me to<br/>
the concept of child-led learning when our children were little. She<br/>
strongly supports this approach for early childhood, but somehow hasn&#39;t<br/>
made the connection to how this approach is truly wonderful in the later<br/>
childhood years as well. She now takes a pretty hardline about grades<br/>
and school performance with her kids.<br/>
<br/>
I was on my way back from a meeting and was talking on the phone to her.<br/>
Our conversation was interupted by what sounded like a major<br/>
conflagration involving her and her 15 year old son. Their relationship<br/>
is pocked with antagonism. She also takes a hardline, cut-them-no-slack<br/>
approach to child guidance, which I think is one of the sources of the<br/>
antagonism. So this huge argument is going on while I&#39;m on the phone and<br/>
hearing that it seems like it will go on for longer than I was willing<br/>
to hold, I just hung up.<br/>
<br/>
When I got home, I was greeted by the sound of my two unschooled<br/>
children having a discussion and trying to list all the various<br/>
historical ages and epochs since the dawn of humankind. They have become<br/>
huge history buffs since playing Age of Empires. As I come in, they have<br/>
questions for me to help them fill in the gaps. I can&#39;t answer their<br/>
questions, but I go to our home copy of Timelines of History we all<br/>
start looking for the information together. Then my oldest son wants to<br/>
know how many civil wars occured in Japan. My youngest son says with<br/>
certainty that there were a lot of civil wars in Japan. I had no clue,<br/>
so we all go look on the internet and find that Japan had 500 years<br/>
worth of civil wars that killed off one third of the population. He was<br/>
right! How did he know this? By playing computer games and watching the<br/>
History Channel. They start talking about a great Samuri named Iyeyasu.<br/>
Peace was made in 1600 when Iyeyasu Tokugawa made peace by granting land<br/>
to his defeated enemies. An article we found on how this bold concept of<br/>
waging peace while avoiding total anhilation of the enemy could be<br/>
applied to the conflict between Israel and Palestinians lead to a<br/>
discussion and more questions about current events. This lead us to look<br/>
through the newspaper and television to get the news of the day. And so<br/>
it went on for the rest of the day, we were happily unschooling on a<br/>
Saturday afternoon -- listening and viewing, reading, discussing,<br/>
playing war game scenarios on the computer, applying this to my dh&#39;s<br/>
web-based game creation -- all of us learning and growiong and enjoying<br/>
each others company.<br/>
<br/>
What a contrast to the parent-child wars going on at my friend&#39;s house!<br/>
I am so grateful to be an unschooling family!<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have a set bedtime -- they often stay up later than I do.<br/>
I don&#39;t restrict their TV or video games -- they seem to regulate that<br/>
well enough on their own. Their rooms are their domain -- I never go in<br/>
unless asked, but they ask all the time to show me things they&#39;re doing.<br/>
They voluntarily do housekeeping tasks -- dishes, vaccuming, mopping,<br/>
dusting, trash removal. They see me working and they just pitch in. The<br/>
more I let go of all the issues that I see other parents battling their<br/>
kids about, the more I see my kids evolve and grow. The less &quot;control&quot; I<br/>
exert on them, the more self-control they seem to have.<br/>
<br/>
Not to say that every day is perfect -- but since starting down the path<br/>
of unschooling -- we&#39;ve had a lot more perfect days than not.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you thank you thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711174693">Awesome post!!<br/>
<br/>
I love the way you talked about all this wonderful discovery <br/>
together and then casually mentioned it took place on a <br/>
SATURDAY! :) So great.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that stood out ot me here is the way one thing naturally <br/>
led to the next. That&#39;s what I find so irresistible about learning <br/>
this way and why I felt wrong doing it differently with my kids <br/>
(when this is precisely how I learn and enjoy it so much).<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I did more &quot;reading stuff&quot; with my 6 yog than we <br/>
have done all fall just because she initiated it. And I suddenly <br/>
saw how much she was getting out of it even though she really <br/>
isn&#39;t reading at all yet. All this on a weekend.<br/>
<br/>
About chores and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We have routines in place that my husband I decided not to <br/>
disrupt. No complaints here. But I have backed off of requiring <br/>
help outside those routines.<br/>
<br/>
Last night while my daughter (whose phone time used to be <br/>
heavily restricted) was on the phone, I walked into the kitchen to <br/>
see her standing on a chair peeling wallpaper for me without <br/>
being asked to do it. It struck me--here she was finally getting to <br/>
chat to her heart&#39;s content and she suddenly of her own volition <br/>
decided to pitch in with the wallpaper project.<br/>
<br/>
Moments like that are worth it all.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Alicia. Keep reporting the good stories. I love to read <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>

This morning my kids collaborated on a book with one writing and one <br/>
illustrating. Right now they&#39;re sledding down the stairs on a basket <br/>
lid in their pajamas and bicycle helmets. Earlier they were eagles <br/>
building a gigantic nest out of my (as yet unfolded!) laundry pile, <br/>
since we saw an Osprey&#39;s nest the other day, and also reached the <br/>
part in reading Lord of the Rings where Gwaihir, the big eagle comes <br/>
into the story, they&#39;ve been interested in big birds. I just love to <br/>
see the unmitigated fun that&#39;s a daily part of their lives.<br/>
