<div id="ygrps-yiv-864418698">&quot; Guns<br/>
are made for war. If he dislikes war, why the interest<br/>
in guns? So many other interesting complex machines to<br/>
explore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My 14 y.o. is fascinated with war history (watches &quot;Mail Call&quot; <br/>
frequently), weaponry of all eras AND many, many other complex <br/>
machines. He&#39;s also a peace activist.  <br/>
Why would I limit his interest in history and weapons, just because <br/>
there are other things to explore?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s like saying: &quot;why the interest in birds when there are so <br/>
many other intersting creatures to explore?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
An interest in guns has nothing to do with a love for violence. One <br/>
does not lead to the other.<br/>
