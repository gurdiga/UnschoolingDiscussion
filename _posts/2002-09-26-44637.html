<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476234131">I am so new to all of this so please forgive me if I sound ignorant.  I have<br/>
been reading today about being less restrictive and having less rules.  I<br/>
can see the wisdom in it.  But I just wanted to ask if you have chores your<br/>
children are required to do?  Also, as mine run through the house and I am<br/>
bone weary, I am just preparing to get them to bed and was wondering if your<br/>
children have required bed times?  And how do these things fit into <br/>
unschooling&quot;?<br/>
Thanks for putting up with me:o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762030321">Welcome and you certainly have a house full. Must be interesting and <br/>
fun and exhausting at one time or another. How wonderful though. I <br/>
would have loved to have started earlier and had more kids. <br/>
<br/>
About the chores thing. I have read or heard somewhere, not sure <br/>
where, that our &#39;job&#39; if you will as parents is to teach our children <br/>
and then when they know how, to let them do for themselves. I <br/>
personally don&#39;t do this. My kids in the next few months will turn <br/>
17, 8, 7 and 2. I know they can get their own food and drinks. Most <br/>
of the time, I do it for them. Not because I feel like I have to or <br/>
because they expect me to, just because I enjoy it. Okay not always, <br/>
but then again they do a lot for themselves and me too. My oldest <br/>
does cook but there are many times when I cook for her. There are <br/>
many times when she feeds the other kids too. She can do laundry just <br/>
like I&#39;m sure if I showed the middle two how to do it, they could <br/>
too. But I usually do it all. No big deal really. I&#39;m doing laundry <br/>
every day anyway, what&#39;s another load?<br/>
<br/>
Each child does put their own clothes away after I fold it. Sometimes <br/>
they help fold and my oldest always folds her own. Not the rest <br/>
because I&#39;m just too anal about how it&#39;s all folded!! They each keep <br/>
their room clean and mostly tidy, although my son is a scatterer. If <br/>
that&#39;s not a word, it should be. The baby helps me feed the dogs <br/>
every day and they all help with letting them out and playing with <br/>
them. My oldest is in charge of the cat box, which is automatic so <br/>
it&#39;s not too bad. When everyone eats, they each clean off their plate <br/>
and take their things to the kitchen. My oldest will load the <br/>
dishwasher and wash things in the sink too. None of these things are <br/>
really forced upon them to do. There are times when they slack off on <br/>
some and times when they do more. Their allowances have nothing to do <br/>
with chores. They get money every week regardless. They are never <br/>
made to feel like they have to do them. I guess it&#39;s just the way <br/>
they were brought up, just kind of knowing and wanting to take care <br/>
of their own things. I never told the baby to do these things either <br/>
and she just follows suit with the rest of them. <br/>
<br/>
As far as bedtimes go, we never really had a set time with any of <br/>
them. Even with my oldest being in school, I leave it up to her. She <br/>
knows what she needs. But at the same time, the kids don&#39;t stay up <br/>
until 1:00 a.m. either. The only reason being that with them being so <br/>
young, they sleep later in the morning and we would have a really <br/>
hard time doing some of the field trips my local group goes on. These <br/>
are choices that they made about going and know how they feel from <br/>
staying upo too late (late for them) by experience. So as much as it <br/>
is something they know and decide, I do suggest that maybe it&#39;s <br/>
getting a bit late and we have such and such the next day to go to. <br/>
My 2 younger girls need more sleep and go to bed earlier than my son <br/>
who will be 8 soon. He could probably stay up all night but watches <br/>
the clock so he doesn&#39;t sleep too long the next day and miss <br/>
something! As it is, no one is in bed before 11:00 these days. Much <br/>
later than my in laws think appropriate!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I got long winded. I haven&#39;t been getting my mail and had to <br/>
archive and felt the need to post something!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; .  But I just wanted to ask if you have chores your<br/>
children are required to do? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, but yesterday I asked people to do specific things, and none of them even <br/>
sighed, they just did it happily.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, as mine run through the house and I am<br/>
bone weary, I am just preparing to get them to bed and was wondering if your<br/>
children have required bed times?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mine don&#39;t.   I got up this morning at 5:00 (because that&#39;s when my husband <br/>
went to work, and I was wide awake from a stupid dream), decided to start <br/>
some bread and get online, and my 13 year old was still up and online playing <br/>
Neopets and chatting with two friends.  One is in town, and one is in <br/>
northern California, so I know he&#39;s not the only kid up all night or up <br/>
really early (in his local also-homeschooled-kid&#39;s case).<br/>
<br/>
The older one, who&#39;s 16, wasn&#39;t in his bed either, but had stayed out gaming <br/>
late and so just slept over where he was.<br/>
<br/>
Marty (mid-kid) went to sleep and asked me to make sure he gets up at noon, <br/>
to go to a gaming-league meeting at 2:00.   Holly was last seen by me at <br/>
10:15 last night.  She had rented The Wiz and was going to watch that in her <br/>
room, and she borrowed an extra alarm clock so she can get up at 9:00 so <br/>
she&#39;ll have time to practice fiddle and then get to a neighbor&#39;s house a few <br/>
blocks away by 11:00 for Harry Potter Leage at a shop near them.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has karate at 4:30, so I  figure he&#39;ll be home noonish.  I&#39;m not <br/>
worried about him.  He&#39;s very responsible.<br/>
<br/>
What it has to do with unschooling is lots of their learning happens when <br/>
they&#39;re awake &lt;bwg&gt;  and it doesn&#39;t all involve me.  <br/>
<br/>
Two of the boys&#39; friends, one female and one male, have been deposere are <br/>
great discussions about all of it.  Critique, sympathy, objection... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While I was asleep, Holly was watching a musical (she&#39;s really interested in <br/>
theatre tech and costumes and such) and when she gets up she&#39;s going through <br/>
her fiddle lessons (three styles at once concurrent with her teacher:  <br/>
Suzuki, Bluegrass, and something called something like &quot;Just Do It&quot; (I <br/>
forget, and the notebook&#39;s in Holly&#39;s room).  So I don&#39;t really care what <br/>
hours she sleeps, I&#39;m just happy that she&#39;s so involved in things that <br/>
interest her, and that she&#39;s looking forward to getting up today and doing <br/>
two things SHE chose to do.  I&#39;ll practice with her, but I don&#39;t do Harry <br/>
Potter with her.  Another homeschooling family introduced her to that and <br/>
takes her to that meeting.<br/>

Required is such a strong word. &lt;g&gt; My DD -10, gets up every morning with <br/>
her mother at 6:30 a.m. to take a walk, and then feed and water the <br/>
animals. It&#39;s not really a &quot;chore&quot; for her, but she loves to do it, just to <br/>
spend some one-on-one time w/mom. Our son, being only 7 has no chores at <br/>
this time. His main purpose in life is just to be a kid, and play, play, <br/>
play. I&#39;m sure as he gets older, just like our daughter, he&#39;ll want to be <br/>
more helpful, and do things just because &quot;they need to be done, and I know <br/>
how to help now&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>==<br/>
Right now they don&#39;t *technically* have a bed time, but they&#39;re usually in <br/>
bed by 10:30 p.m. Mostly because they like to get up in the morning because <br/>
they have a lot of playing to do. &lt;g&gt; And usually by that time of night, me <br/>
and the Mrs. are getting tired too, so if they want a bed-time story, they <br/>
best do it while mom and dad have the energy. LOL.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   And how do these things fit into unschooling&quot;?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>==<br/>
Well, unschooling to us is just living life. So anything and everything is <br/>
part of life, and therefore applies/fits into unschooling :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Thanks for putting up with me:o)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>==<br/>
If they&#39;ll put up with me, they&#39;ll put up with anyone. LOL<br/>

In many places it is literally not safe physically for youngsters to go to<br/>
school. And in many schools - and it&#39;s becoming almost generally true - it<br/>
is spiritually unsafe to attend public schools. Look back over the history<br/>
of education to the turn of the century and the beginning of the educational<br/>
philosophies...which have led us now into a circumstance where our schools<br/>
are producing the problems that we face.<br/>
