Just walked over here from making a batch of goat cheese, so ... I am NO<br/>
expert on this, but at the farm where we are living, the first cheeses<br/>
made were soft unripened ones that are very simple and very good.<br/>
Simply scald (NOT BOIL) a litre of goat milk, then add about 2<br/>
tablespoons of vinegar (I&#39;ve also tried organic lemon juice, but used<br/>
slightly more) after you remove it from the heat.  Stir, and it will<br/>
start to curdle.  Let it sit for a bit, then pour through some cheese<br/>
cloth in a colander and hang or press to get the whey out.  Before<br/>
pressing or hanging you can add a little salt. Presto.  We have mixed<br/>
this simple and quick cheese with herbs (basil is wonderful), garlic,<br/>
smoked salmon, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. with great success.  This is<br/>
really a delicious but simple and versatile cheese.  The whey is used in<br/>
breads and soups, etc.  We also freeze milk for the dry times.<br/>
<br/>
The cheese I just made was a more traditional one with bacterial<br/>
culture, and rennet, and is a bit more complicated.  It is the first<br/>
time we&#39;ve done that here, but it is going to be a growing venture.<br/>
There is a fair bit of information on the web -- I didn&#39;t bookmark the<br/>
site, but I had good luck just enterring &#39;goat cheese&#39; and browsing.  We<br/>
also get cheese books from the library -- it&#39;s is pretty much the same<br/>
process as for cow cheese.  You need to order culture and rennet,<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Because we are all allergic to dairy, we use goat milk for everyting.<br/>
We make puddings (a thickener such as corn starch, arrowroot, tapioca or<br/>
flour; vanilla and honey) to eat with fruit, or to make pies.  The kids<br/>
love these.  One day Jorlene, the real goat lady here, dried some of the<br/>
unripened cheese in a pan in the oven, turning often, to yield a dried<br/>
cheese comparable to parmesan.  Very good, and uses quite a bit of milk.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got ...<br/>
<br/>
So, good luck.<br/>
