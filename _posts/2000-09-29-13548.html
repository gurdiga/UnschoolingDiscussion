<br/>
An excellent article.  Mr. Leef hits the nail right on the head.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A snippet to whet your appetite:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Our government education system has always produced a large number of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>people who have neither the interest nor the ability to do college-level<br/>
work, and its imploding standards are increasing those numbers each year. In<br/>
the days before nearly universal &quot;access&quot; to higher education, poorly<br/>
educated high schoolers simply got jobs, or if they tried college, they<br/>
probably flunked out. But things have changed. Driven by the belief that<br/>
everyone should go to college, politicians and college officials have<br/>
lowered costs and standards to the point where virtually anyone with the<br/>
slightest desire to attend college can.<br/>
<br/>
There are still islands of excellence in higher education, but they are<br/>
surrounded by and eroding into an ocean of mediocrity. As Ernest van den<br/>
Haag wrote in his essay &quot;Gresham&#39;s Law in Education&quot; more than 25 years ago,<br/>
&quot;In the process of trying to educate the inept, the education of those who<br/>
might benefit will necessarily be impaired while very little is gained by<br/>
those supposed to be helped.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
