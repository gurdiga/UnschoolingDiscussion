<div id="ygrps-yiv-259485117">Hello <br/>
I just joined the group.. I am a 30 year old SAHM and <br/>
shepherd/weaver. I have a dd almost 4 shannon and husband rick.  We <br/>
live on a 40 acre farm in TX with a young mother and her 2 year old <br/>
son.  We plan on unschooling. We find living like we do there are <br/>
multiple opportunities for learning.  I was reading back a bit and <br/>
so will also say that we don&#39;t have television.  We have limited <br/>
electricity.  Our goal here is to be self sufficient.  I look <br/>
forward to sharing with everyone and picking up some interesting <br/>
ideas.  As it is, the kids love reading to each other.  There are <br/>
several books that Shannon will &#39;read&#39; to Kiryn and vice versa.  <br/>
Kiryn is very verbal and articulate and will make up stories for <br/>
Shannon.  &#39;Why&#39; is his favorite word. We find opportunities to teach <br/>
math while sorting beans and baby chicks and fractions while baking <br/>
bread.  Shannon is still pretty preoperational but is beginning to <br/>
get two halves make one whole.  We are also introducing Spanish and <br/>
play a game called What is it? Que es esso? <br/>
Shannon also likes to sew with her little sewing kit.. and kiryns <br/>
favorite is carrying around his little hammer and fixing things. He <br/>
will often be found wearing a green velvet dress with shannon <br/>
playing pretty pretty princess although right now they are <br/>
pretending to kill a pig and cook it for dinner.<br/>
Soon the garden will go in and they will help along with that.  We <br/>
also teach botany as we take walks out in the field and shannon can <br/>
identify a dozen trees and plants and about half that many animal <br/>
tracks(deer, rabbit, goat, dog, raccoon, goose).<br/>
so a little glimpse into our day...<br/>
happy to meet everyone.<br/>
