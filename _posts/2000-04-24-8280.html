&lt;&lt; celebrating May Day &gt;&gt;<br/>

wouldnt it be fun to make flower wreaths for little heads and i wonder how <br/>
hard that maypole thing is where you attatch streamers to the top of the pole <br/>
and each child holds the end of one, then they go around the pole weaving <br/>
them down...  sounds pretty or picturesque anyway!  the other thing i have <br/>
heard is to make may baskets to secretly leave at the door of someone... <br/>
which could be a nice service opp. for the group.  ooops, i think you asked <br/>
for games?  owell.<br/>
