&lt;&lt;  She still only uses the bedroom clock because she<br/>
hasn&#39;t memorized the hand clock and thinks it&#39;s a waste of time to count<br/>
by fives when she can just run into my room and read the digital.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were all little, the boys only read digital clocks, and Holly <br/>
only read analog.  I loved when they would be in a public place, and one <br/>
would ask the other what time it was (depending on what clock they could see, <br/>
and who could read it).<br/>
<br/>
We never &quot;taught&quot; them to read any of those, but they learned in part from <br/>
Playroom and Treasure Math Storm (I think it was), both of which had clock <br/>
games in them.<br/>
