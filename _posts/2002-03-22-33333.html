&lt;&lt; And I don&#39;t understand why those people don&#39;t just join in at an <br/>
eclectic homeschoolers website? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good idea.  There are LOTS of websites where nobody argues about the <br/>
definition of unschooling, where families who require writing and math will <br/>
be welcomed and praised!   <br/>
<br/>
But if this one is not what it advertises itself to be, which is supportive <br/>
of unschooling, and the one discussion group of unschooling.com, then people <br/>
wanting good unschooling information won&#39;t have a good place to go.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no justification for watering this one down or for having people here <br/>
who insult unschoolers and say unschooling is anything in the world including <br/>
going to school.<br/>
<br/>
There have been snarky objections to suggestions that there are other <br/>
discussion groups on yahoo that might be more welcoming of those who are <br/>
unschooling-resistent, or who have a need to try to bend and stretch the <br/>
definition to include their children who are in school or being tutored or <br/>
whatever.  IF this were the only homescholing information source on earth, we <br/>
would have an obligation to be welcoming, but this is one of thousands.  <br/>
Rather than people staying here and complaining and redefining terms to suit <br/>
any contingency, they could try other lists and either see that others are <br/>
not better, or find one that&#39;s MUCH better suited to them.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some others which specifically advertised on yahoogroups to discuss <br/>
unschooling.  (These links and comments, from here to the end, were posted to <br/>
another list a couple of weeks ago after I did a search on yahoogroups for <br/>
unschooling groups.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of you want more input and would like to join additional groups. <br/>
Maybe some of you are bored with this list and want a different style. Maybe <br/>
you&#39;re just curious about what else is there. I&#39;ll set my own comments <br/>
apart ******this way******** and the first number there is the number of <br/>
members listed.  There were 210 groups listed, but many <br/>
of them were definitely NOT unschooling lists, and showed up because they <br/>
said so (using that term) or because they had a keywords list and unschooling <br/>
was one of their keywords (for no good reason at all).<br/>

395 RUL <br/>
This is the &quot;Radical Unschoolers List&quot;. It is for all families, regardless of <br/>
religious affiliation, choosing to unschool their children. Unschooling is <br/>
child-led learning, learning as a part of life. It allows the child to learn <br/>
naturally, without adult-imposed &quot;lessons&quot;, schedules, or timelines. This <br/>
list is to offer support, information, perspective, and enlightenment to <br/>
anyone already unschooling or interested in unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
217 CCU-List <br/>
CCU stands for Christ Centered Unschooling. Unschooling is a well researched <br/>
theory which departs from the accepted norms of education in our society. <br/>
Learning should be as natural as any other life process, ie; breathing and <br/>
eating. The theory of unschooling depends on the human being&#39;s innate desire <br/>
to learn and strives to allow the individual the freedom to explore their <br/>
current areas of interest. This list was formed as a place for Christians who <br/>
are either unschooling, attempting to ... more <br/>

****I don&#39;t think unschooling is exactly &quot;well researched,&quot; although it&#39;s <br/>
based on various parts of well-researched learning theory rejected by public <br/>
schools...****<br/>

Thanks for sharing the lists, but I have a question for you (and all). I just received a phone call from a homeschooler who has been having some troubles and joined our local unschooling group. She was basically just asking some questions and wanted to know if she would still be welcome to come to some of our gatherings *if she didn&#39;t do things the same as everyone else. After talking more with her and her asking questions I did tell her that I thought she was more of a relaxed homeschooler, so because she doesn&#39;t &#39;fit&#39; the definition, do I tell her... well, you do require subjects and well you put your kids in time out so you are not really worthy of support from our groups, go and find another one out there? Or do I WELCOME her and maybe, just maybe, let her see how great unschooling can be and that although our styles are completely different, we can still learn from each other?<br/>
<br/>
Me, I told she was welcome anytime.<br/>

If you&#39;re not telling newcomers here to ignore the other posters and just <br/>
listen to you, what would be the problem?  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the direct attacks on those who WOULD like to help people understand <br/>
that unschooling can work that are irritating.  YES it can work really well, <br/>
but it can never work if people are headed off and discouraged from actually <br/>
trying it full out.<br/>
<br/>
If the constant background  noise is &quot;school&#39;s no problem,&quot; and &quot;math lessons <br/>
are fine,&quot; families will hesitate to believe that there is such a thing as <br/>
workable radical unschooling and there most certainly is.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what I used to do when we did have an unschooling group.  Because my <br/>
boys are older and didn&#39;t want to keep doing the new-homeschoolers social <br/>
work they had done for so many years, and I was tired of having my house <br/>
trashed by little kids I might never see again, we quit hosting the group.  <br/>
Several of those families are still solidly part of our lives, but there are <br/>
other broader groups in town now where newcomers can go.<br/>
<br/>
Another mom and I made three rules for the unschooling group.  We had done a <br/>
weekly play group for years, and when we were both unschooling and our kids <br/>
were older and wanting friends, we organized &quot;the Goof Group&quot;--no officers, <br/>
no field trips, no discussion of curriculum.  So if families wanted to come, <br/>
I just told them it was fine, but to just let the kids play, and if they were <br/>
curriculum users, not to talk about that during the meeting time.  <br/>
<br/>
The greatest benefit of the unschooling group was seeing unschooled kids <br/>
interacting with each other and with the parents.  Those kids made more <br/>
parents change their beliefs than any words did.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve always tried to keep current contact information for other groups in <br/>
the area, and for web resources for whatever kinds of homeschooling they were <br/>
interested in.   The New Mexico contact stuff is at sandradodd.com/nmex and <br/>
the various-particulars stuff (religions, clubs, regions) is at <br/>
sandradodd.com/unschoolingotherwise (that&#39;s not local, but international).<br/>

By being welcoming she may decide that unschooling can and will work for<br/>
her.  If not, she will find another group but won&#39;t go away from unschooling<br/>
with a negative impression thinking that unschoolers think of themselves as<br/>
some elitest group.<br/>

My hope is that even if folks can&#39;t &quot;do&quot; 100% pure unschooling as defined by<br/>
some, they will at least glean something from unschooling that will help<br/>
make life a nicer place for their children.  And you simply never know, you<br/>

like you should be put on the list. . . that radical unschooling can work for <br/>
every child. Others who disagree are also free to post their thoughts on it <br/>

However, there is a problem with telling people to go find another list. <br/>
People are free to come and go on this list unless they get moderated and <br/>
then their posts have to be approved. Because of some of the totally uncalled <br/>

of  you who have suggested that some people should find another list, please <br/>
discontinue to do so. I know there were several post of that nature and I <br/>

not do that anymore. Thanks for your cooperation.<br/>

Since they&#39;re free to come and go, why is there a problem with letting them <br/>

It is very true that there are other lists.  It&#39;s not secret.  There is no <br/>
money lost to anyone if people are on more than one list.  There seems to be <br/>
some desperation as though this is the only source of unschooling <br/>

No, I think offering up the other options is actually good. But sometimes the &#39;tone&#39; of a post is hard to tell and it can seem to sound like - go find another list.. it&#39;s a tricky line online because you can not see the other person and if you don&#39;t know them or their posting style some may get offended..<br/>

I don&#39;t agree. I like hearning about other lists, websites anything to help<br/>
me along on my journey.<br/>
If someone says something to the group, and I think they are saying it<br/>
personally to me and I get upset/offended/angry, I need to wonder why. *I*<br/>
know whether or not the statement applies, if it doesn&#39;t apply to me, then I<br/>
just say, well, s/he can&#39;t be talking about me.<br/>
I can&#39;t spend my time getting offended for others, they can get offended<br/>
without my help.<br/>
I take what I need here, and I leave the rest. There may very well be a few<br/>
people who are lurking and saw the other lists and checked them out. With<br/>
the amount of people on this list compared to the amount who are active, we<br/>
have no way of knowing if the things we say are helping others or hurting<br/>
them, since many don&#39;t post. What if it was helpful? should we stop?  Maybe<br/>
some people read the list of lists, joined them thinking they would explore<br/>
a more ecclectic style and then came back here convinced unschooling was<br/>
better?<br/>
Information is just information, do with it as you wish.<br/>
If one believes they belong here, They do! so how could providing info be<br/>
wrong?<br/>
If one doesn&#39;t like the commentary, think of oneself as the better person,<br/>
and just blow it off.<br/>
Miss Manners columns everyweek are based on the same premise. Someone being<br/>

things the same as everyone else. After talking more with her and her asking <br/>
questions I did tell her that I thought she was<br/>
more of a relaxed homeschooler, so because she doesn&#39;t &#39;fit&#39; the definition, <br/>
do I tell her... well, you do require subjects and well you put your kids in <br/>
time out so you are not really worthy of support from our groups, go and <br/>
find another one out there? Or do I WELCOME her and maybe, just maybe, let <br/>
her see how great unschooling can be and that although our styles are <br/>
completely different, we can still learn from each other?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would have told that she was welcome, but there might be times she might <br/>
be surprised or uncomfortable at the way people do things. I would also have <br/>
spent some time with her explaining the places where she might differ from <br/>
the group dynamic or thinking. That way she&#39;d be prepared to start seeing <br/>
things done a little differently, or sharing her ideas with some history of <br/>
the group in mind. Maybe it would help her be less defensive when ideas are <br/>
brought up that don&#39;t match her own.<br/>

Group,&quot; our unschooling playgroup which lasted for several years.  There was <br/>
a map kind of bandit/pirate style, to the park.   <br/>
<br/>
One side had DISCLAIMER AND GUARANTEES:<br/>
<br/>
This is not a support group.<br/>
GUARANTEED: No officers.<br/>
GUARANTEED:  No meetings.<br/>
GUARANTEED: No fieldtrips.<br/>
Support and encouragement<br/>
are likely but not GUARANTEED:<br/>
We will not be dangerous unless<br/>
you try to talk to us about<br/>
structure and curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
The main blurb said <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers Wanted.<br/>
<br/>
The Goof Group, all wild and crafty &quot;unschoolers,&quot; welcome more of their ilk <br/>
to join them at their merry hideout on Tuesdays at 11:00.  If you are <br/>
homeschoolers who take inspiration from John Holt or the Marx Brother, you&#39;re <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
Bring food if you can; we&#39;ll disperse at 1:00; when it gets too cold we&#39;ll <br/>
hole up until Spring and meet again.<br/>

I&#39;ve seen folks say they are starting new lists which are specific to &quot;a&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen folks share lists that are for folks from particular states.<br/>

I&#39;ve mentioned some of the lists that are run by radical unschoolers.<br/>
