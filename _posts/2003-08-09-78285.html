Actually, they&#39;re very edible to ducks and snakes, which at least helps solve the slug problem in my garden :-).<br/>

<br/>
I think you can get arrested for that.<br/>
At the very least you know, people will start calling you old slug butt.<br/>
<br/>
Do you like spicy food?  You could try some hot peppers, they&#39;re pain<br/>
numbing.  Don&#39;t rub them on anything though, (YOWZA that hurts!) eat<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
Are you out of chocolate?  I could send you some.  <br/>
<br/>
If pain numbing doesn&#39;t work there&#39;s always mind numbing.  You could<br/>
always watch the slugs stroll across your rump, if you&#39;re a contortionist<br/>
or clever with a mirror.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a contortionist who&#39;s clever with a mirror I&#39;m going to have to<br/>
ask some tough questions about how you actually broke that arm and got<br/>
such a sore behind.     <br/>

much once it gets going, but we&#39;ve had to this year.  I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
a slug in several weeks.  How about arnica cream or gel.  Chances are <br/>
you can get it in PG.<br/>

THAT would be a contest in patience.  Just w-a-t-c-h and wonder which way the <br/>
slime trail will go.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I don&#39;t have that kind of patience at ALL.  I did somehow end up with two <br/>
patient kids (the boys) and one non-patient Holly.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has counted a little herd of snails in our back yard and has been <br/>
watching them a couple of times, at night  There are ten, she says.  As it&#39;s been <br/>
overcast, they&#39;re able to be out longer. She knows more about snails than I <br/>
(hope) I ever will, and is patient enough to watch them a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight she&#39;s at an overnight party in another area (Placitas, not quite a <br/>
town, but not Albuquerque) with a family she met once and they called and gushed <br/>
about how nice she was and how fun.  I hope she has fun and they still like <br/>
her that much by tomorrow afternoon.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve developed an unnatural fascination with crawly things.  It came<br/>
directly from answering Dylan&#39;s questions about bugs.  &quot;What is this,<br/>
what does he eat, where does he live ?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I used to be afraid of spiders, not in a squealing kind of way, but had<br/>
the presence of mind (just briefly there) to know I&#39;d transmit my fear to<br/>
Dylan if I didn&#39;t get rid of it.  I can pick spiders up in my hands now,<br/>
something I never would have done eleven years ago. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for grasshoppers. <br/>
They look like little aliens.  <br/>
<br/>
I  also now have sickening amounts of trivial information about bugs and<br/>
insects, absorbed from my son who loves all creatures, great and small,<br/>
and won&#39;t even swat mosquitoes.   <br/>
<br/>
***I hope she has fun and they still like <br/>
her that much by tomorrow afternoon.***<br/>
<br/>
If snails are fun for a little while this family&#39;s chances of being fun<br/>
for an overnight might be pretty good. <br/>
They&#39;ll like her more than ever I suspect, and if they don&#39;t, you could<br/>
send them a slick package of snails. <br/>
Oh!  They&#39;re not French are they, the family Holly&#39;s staying with? <br/>
Bill them, if they are.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

to ride green horses I am(oops, sounding like Yoda there).<br/>
The slugs would get hung up on the haematoma(sp) on my butt the size of a <br/>
grapefruit. But the laugh I got from your post is better than all the tylenol I <br/>
have taken for pain relief.I seem to be whiny today. Even slugs would be ok  <br/>
with me. My heart goes out to people with constant chronic pain and health <br/>
problems.<br/>
We are watching a lot of TV. <br/>
   all chocolate would be much appreciated. Even the virtual stuff is good<br/>
Nancy in BC still chortling<br/>
ps our slugs in Prince George are teeny tiny, not worth rubbing on.<br/>
