Try six people and four ratties in 1250 squ. feet!!! Actually, we&#39;ve added a bit of footage with dh finishing the basement...probably up around 1500 or so with that space. But that&#39;s just a den/office for dh to work or escape when quiet is needed. All the eating, sleeping, playing etc...is done in the 1250 sf main living area.<br/>
I am trying really hard to get organized right now...giving things away left and right and still can&#39;t seem to find enough space. I like living simply, but sometimes storage issues get a bit frustrating.<br/>

floor, with bedrooms, kitchen and living space is 900sf. The basement, <br/>
thankfully, is finished, with one big room, a very large laundry room that <br/>
doubles as a craft room with an extra refrigerator, and a 3/4 bath. We have <br/>
no garage (just built a 12&#39; x 16&#39; shed), so I hear ya about storage issues! <br/>
I am constantly purging and constantly trying to wring more efficiency from <br/>
the space I have.<br/>

When people make statements like these, I feel like we must be different <br/>

<br/>
The above info is why I &quot;find&quot; myself reorganizing, though I am the first <br/>
to admit that I am a total type A personality. LOL I am one of those people <br/>
who simply cannot sit still. I wrote my dissertation while mothering 3 <br/>
small children. For a while I joked that I had more children than chapters. <br/>
LOL  Now that&#39;s finished, I had nothing to do. So, I just built a 3000+ <br/>
gallon pond, moving a whole lot &#39;o earth and about 6 tons of rock by <br/>
myself.  I have a little too much energy for most people&#39;s taste! I think I <br/>
AM a different species. ;) BTW--I LOVED your suggestion about keeping dice <br/>
in your purse! I am definitely going to do take that suggestion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727542348">If it wasn&#39;t a temporary housing situation, we&#39;d have done something down in the basement...but we didn&#39;t feel it would be worth it to do much for just a couple years of use. As it is, we&#39;re not allowed to take the pads off of the ductwork so that it would be heated in the basement, so there was no point to putting in a couch and TV and making a playroom down there like I&#39;d really wanted to do when we first moved in. SIGH...<br/>
 <br/>
If anything I have a better appreciation for just what it is that I do want in our &quot;someday&quot; house that we are drawing up plans for building when Paul retires from the Coast Guard...and one of those things is a minimum of two full baths and one half-bath!<br/>

converting from feet to meters by dividing the feet by 3 if the numbers <br/>
aren&#39;t too big. If you&#39;re working with big numbers or need accuracy, <br/>
divide by 3 1/4.<br/>
<br/>
When you multiply, to get the square units, the extra little fraction <br/>
makes more difference. So, a square foot is 1 foot by 1 foot and that <br/>
would be roughly 3 1/4 meters by 3 1/4 meters or 10 1/2 square meters.  <br/>
So it would be closer to divide by 10, instead of 9 (and easier, too).  <br/>
If you want to be more accurate, divide by 10 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
1250 square feet is quickly estimated at 125 square meters (actual <br/>
number is closer to 116 square meters).<br/>
1500 square feet is quickly  estimated at 150 square meters (actual <br/>
number is closer to 139 square meters).<br/>
<br/>
So - just divide by 10 to go from square feet to square meters, but <br/>
remember that the actual square meters is really a bit smaller than <br/>
that.<br/>
