Food coloring-kids paints of anykind-unsweetened kool-aid-<br/>
Spray containers-dump your soap-window cleaner-into something else-you can put it back later if you want to.small spray containers are available at  garden stores-dollar stores- <br/>
Draw faces-outline  each other with a stick in the snow-spray around the lines with the colors-color lines to make big house plans-arrows-pointing north-south  etc with &quot;signs&quot;.  &quot;modern art&quot; for  toddlers or the so inclined.<br/>
faces on snowmen<br/>
carve snow chunks with old bread knives  to make snowmen if the snow isnt sticky  -join the chunks with some  water to freeve them together if it is real cold out.<br/>
pour some in plastic bowls-let it freeze outside  or in the freezer-put a  tea candle or candle stub in and let it burn in the dark where they can see it from the window. Put it in your &quot;snowmans&quot;  &quot;hands&quot;<br/>
