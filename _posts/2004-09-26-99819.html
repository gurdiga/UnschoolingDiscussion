<div id="ygrps-yiv-531471550">It&#39;s almost 9 pm on Saturday, and a couple of rooms away my 15 year old son  <br/>
is having a birthday party with a bunch of his friends, unschooled,  <br/>
homeschooled, and schooled.<br/>
 <br/>
They started in the yard. We arranged a bunch of chairs in a circle with a  <br/>
great round Moroccan table in the middle loaded with food and candles. We <br/>
bought  a new firepit and some firewood. They played loud discordant metal rock and <br/>
 laughed and played.<br/>
 <br/>
Now they&#39;re in the living room playing cards and games and still laughing.  <br/>
They are lovely. They are adorable. They are very happy on their own, but also  <br/>
very sweet and happy to chat with us adults when we check to see if they need <br/>
 anything.<br/>
 <br/>
After a couple of months of really hard stuff, it&#39;s so nice to have  this in <br/>
the house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019975368">We had a similar experience when my son turned 15 (two years ago) and it meant so much <br/>
to me. I&#39;m really happy for your family.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it wonderful to feel good about your kids?<br/>
