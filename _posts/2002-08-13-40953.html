&gt;&gt;asked me what was going on and I told her I was so glad she was here and <br/>
&gt;&gt;not gone on a school bus at 7 a.m.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

here. I&#39;ve gotten a few jittery emails lately from local newbie <br/>
homeschoolers with 5 and 6 year olds. Hopefully this wil help them all <br/>
connect and for the kids to see they&#39;re not the only ones staying home from <br/>
the school scene. It will not be starting at 7:00 a.m. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Victoria Homelearners have been doing this for a number of years <br/>
now.  (We stole the idea from Vancouver.)  We meet at a wonderful local <br/>
beach around late morning of the first day of school.  Not only is it a <br/>
great chance to re-connect with home learners we haven&#39;t seen for a while, <br/>
it&#39;s also great for newbies.  They get a chance to see a lot of kids and <br/>
parents who seem pretty normal.  They get to see a lot of kids of all ages <br/>
mostly getting along well.  Even though my teen doesn&#39;t like going anymore, <br/>
*I* still go.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
