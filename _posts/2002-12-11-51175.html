<div id="ygrps-yiv-746616452">I LOVE Trader Joe&#39;s! You&#39;re right, the staff is great, but I have to say the <br/>
&quot;old  people&quot;  in ours (Dublin, Ohio) have been pretty good..well, great <br/>
sometimes, actually. We had a day recently when my three year old (new to the <br/>
experience of &#39;little people&quot; carts) decided that pushing her child-size cart <br/>
as hard as she could and letting go was great fun. Of course, as I was trying <br/>
to keep it from zooming into a display with glass containers she somehow <br/>
managed to whack it into the back of the legs of an older man ahead of <br/>
us....who could have made her feel awful, but smiled and spoke to her <br/>
whenever we passed him after that. <br/>
<br/>
Kalie sings her way (loudly) through whatever store we happen to be in, too, <br/>
and several days before Thanksgiving, we were at the same Trader Joe&#39;s (very <br/>
crowded, the usual pre-holiday stuff), and I had a number of older people <br/>
tell me she was a joy to watch - &quot;just the entertainment value alone was <br/>
worth the trip&#39;&quot; as one very pleasant woman put it. <br/>
<br/>
I always leave there feeliing relatively relaxed, even after shopping with my <br/>
3-year-old, who will absolutely not ride in a cart anymore, because she&#39;s a <br/>
&quot;big girl&quot; (and if she were in the cart, she couldn&#39;t toss in all those nice <br/>
surprises for me that I try to find at the checkout!).<br/>
<br/>
I just wish there was a Trader Joe&#39;s closer to our house......my only <br/>
&quot;complaint&quot;!<br/>

&gt; I sure miss that place!! I love the way they ring your purchase up without<br/>
&gt; laser scanners and calling out the price of each item.....just like all<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry to break the news to you Ren, but our Trader Joe&#39;s has gone to the<br/>
fancy laser scanner system about 6 months ago. It was actually pretty<br/>
funny - it took a while for the regular checkout staff to get the hang of<br/>
the scanner system - it took longer than the old way! But now they&#39;re old<br/>
pro&#39;s at it and checking out goes smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t really have many grumpy people at our Trader Joes that I can<br/>
recall - just your average amount, I suppose. ;-)<br/>
I LOVE Trader Joes and go shopping there once a week, and if I miss a week,<br/>
I am severely out of STUFF!<br/>
