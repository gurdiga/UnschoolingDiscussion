<div id="ygrps-yiv-219242319">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any advice on sibling fighting? It&#39;s usually the same <br/>
story my older son picks on the younger one until he gets mad and <br/>
pounces on his brother. It doesn&#39;t seem that anything we try is <br/>
working. Today the older one woke up with a black eye and scratches <br/>
all over his face which was the result of Starwars play gone bad.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the Help.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105458899">Hi Jenn....<br/>
<br/>
Two things come to mind that may help.....<br/>
<br/>
Hitting should never be accepted. Do you talk with your sons about <br/>
this when things are calm? Trying to talk when tempers are flared is <br/>
not going to work. Talk about better ways to handle frustration and <br/>
anger.  <br/>
<br/>
Also...maybe they need to get out more. Go bike riding or hiking or <br/>
roller blading. My kids had a lot of anger issues when we adopted <br/>
them and physical activity has really helped us. We have bikes, <br/>
roller blades, a playset, skateboards, a pogo stick, jump ropes and <br/>
we just bought a 14&#39; trampoline for them for Christmas (I can&#39;t wait <br/>
to give it to them!!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this helps!<br/>
