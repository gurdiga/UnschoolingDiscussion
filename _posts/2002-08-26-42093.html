 Could you channel that offer toward memberships at museums, aquariums, zoos, <br/>
 science center?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not with my Grandma. She is hell bent on academics.  I think that&#39;s a <br/>
marvelous idea for most people though.<br/>
My in laws are the supportive ones strangely enough.<br/>
I have fantastic in laws!! Their offer is to pay for some type of lesson for <br/>
each child. They don&#39;t care if it changes every month, any type of lesson the <br/>
kids want to dabble in they will support. They&#39;ve helped with swim lessons, <br/>
gymnastics, tennis and even paid for a science museum membership one year.<br/>
They also like to pay for one or two magazine subscriptions....what marvelous <br/>
grandparents.<br/>
If I even suggest something like that to my Grandma she gets all twitchy, it <br/>
really, really bothers her that I&#39;m not even concerned about the fact that <br/>
Trevor doesn&#39;t know his multiplication tables at 12y.o. and Jared can&#39;t read <br/>
at 9.<br/>
I would just like to not talk with her about homeschooling ever again.<br/>
My sister called me ranting and raving like a lunatic last month because my <br/>
Grandma had gotten Kevin (my nephew) alone and tried to tell him how great <br/>
school was and &quot;didn&#39;t he want to go too?&quot;<br/>
She&#39;s totally brainwashed. Trusts government and the system in general, <br/>
impossible for her to think outside the box.<br/>
