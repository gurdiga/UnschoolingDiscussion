<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077700115">My son (6) and I  have been doing &quot;How to teach your child to read in<br/>
100 easy lessons&quot;.  I like it.  We don&#39;t do the writing part because it<br/>
was just too hard for him, and caused to much frustration and tears.<br/>
But, he really loves books, and being read to.<br/>
We have been doing it for about a month, every day.  It only takes about<br/>
10 minutes each day.  It is all phonics....<br/>
He is getting frustrated though.  Today he even almost started to cry,<br/>
though he really fights that now.  He is doing well.  I think he would<br/>
be very excited to read, but maybe I just ought to forget it for now?<br/>
Should we just continue with the read aloud and forget the lessons?  We<br/>
read alot of chapter books, even the first book of the Tales of Narnia,<br/>
which he enjoyed.  They all loved Little House books, and we&#39;ve read<br/>
lots of others.<br/>
Why do I want him to read so much?  I love reading to them, so it&#39;s not<br/>
that.<br/>
I guess its just that all the 6,7 yr olds I know can read, and write<br/>
ect....  My son has no interest in learning to read or write.  He can<br/>
barely write his name, and that&#39;s it.<br/>
Am I just getting into  one of those &quot;crazy Mom&quot; times???<br/>
I need some words..........<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I need some words.......... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Words we got.  :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not true that all 6-7 year olds read. What they do is reading readiness. <br/>
 You know the goal that the President set out was all kids reading by the end <br/>
of 3rd grade. What that really means is that by 10 most kids are reading, and <br/>
some of them are reading not even close to reading fluently.  I have a son <br/>
who is 9.5, he&#39;s only been reading 1st grade material fluently for 3 months <br/>
or more.  I have another son who is 7. That poor child couldn&#39;t care one whit <br/>
about words and letters.  Give him a screwdriver and something to take apart <br/>
and he&#39;s in heaven.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing to consider is that not all learning is on a steady uphill <br/>
curve.  Learning is like physical growth, it comes in fits and starts.  <br/>
Sometimes there is a very long down time, sleep time, right before a spurt of <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not worth tears. You can&#39;t make his brain comprehend until it&#39;s ready <br/>
anyhow. Put the book up and just read to him.  Then get up and bake some <br/>
cookies.  In 3 months it will dawn on you that he&#39;s reading much better, that <br/>
he has learned and he hasn&#39;t cried over 100 Easy lessons in 90 days.  When <br/>
he&#39;s ready, he&#39;ll ask, either directly or indirectly for more info about how <br/>
reading works.<br/>
<br/>
I promise.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Been there.  While we didn&#39;t attempt any actual learn to read programs, I<br/>
would try to get Neal to attempt to read the first sentence of every chapter<br/>
or whatever.  He would deliberately read  words incorrectly that I *Knew*<br/>
that he knew.  It was just too much work, and he was losing the context<br/>
while doing the decoding.  I would usually get the message and back off and<br/>
just read to him.  Part of the problem was that we were also reading books<br/>
like the Narnia series and E. Nesbit books which had either difficult or<br/>
rather anachronistic language for a 7 or 8 year old.  It&#39;s hard to puzzle<br/>
out words you have never heard before.  OTOH, he was not at all interested<br/>
in the easy read stuff which was more at his reading skill level.<br/>
<br/>
So I backed off.  He started reading on his own just before his 10th<br/>
birthday and was reading high school level books and technical manuals<br/>
within months.  He needed to wait until his cognitive readiness caught up to<br/>
his taste in reading material.<br/>
<br/>
With son #2, I had learned my lesson, and didn&#39;t press him.  We just kept<br/>
reading to him.  One day I had a bad cold and finally said that if he wanted<br/>
to finish the chapter he would have to read to me.  He looked at the page<br/>
for awhile and then slowly and haltingly sounded out the whole first<br/>
sentence!   I asked him why he hadn&#39;t told me he could read and he replied,<br/>
with great surprise &quot;I only just discovered it myself!&quot;  This was at about 7<br/>
years of age, and he too refused to read aloud or on his own until he was 9.<br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing is that while these kids both read late, their<br/>
comprehension is excellent.  I&#39;m convinced that  they could have decoded the<br/>
words earlier, but not without losing the context and this was<br/>
counter-productive to the whole purpose of reading, nu?<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is reassuring to you, Ann.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I forgot to mention the writing thing in my response to the reading thing<br/>
:-)  #1 son  would dictate wonderful, long, creative stories from the time<br/>
he was four but would not put pencil to paper.  He would run back and forth<br/>
and do sommersaults while dictating.  It was as if he would have to put all<br/>
his energy into staying still and this would block the creative flow or<br/>
something.  He only printed out messages on birthday cards.  He eventually<br/>
started to used a keyboard,  but what kicked the writing thing in was when<br/>
he joined a creative writing circle with some other unschoolers who wanted<br/>
to push themselves and share their writing.  They would do excercises, and<br/>
one day after having hastily scrawling his contribution but not being able<br/>
to decipher his own letters, he came home and said he thought it was time to<br/>
learn to write cursive.  He finally had a reason.  We decided together that<br/>
we would take a half an hour a day for as long as it took.  He kept at it<br/>
for an hour the first day, and we worked again the next day for a shorter<br/>
time and that was it.  His handwriting is more legible than his father&#39;s<br/>
(okay, so this doesn&#39;t take much :-) but the point is that when they decide<br/>
it&#39;s worthwhile, they do it quickly and well.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 year old wrote a postcard last spring where the printing was large and<br/>
uneven and crowded, and again, all capitals.  This was the *only* thing he<br/>
had written up until then other than &quot;happy birthday&quot; on cards, at least<br/>
that I knew of.  I was so impressed that I scanned it and kept a copy before<br/>
he sent it.  This past fall he wrote a wonderful paragraph on the 1998 Major<br/>
League Baseball season and the improvement in a couple of months without<br/>
ever having done a lick of work on it, was truly amazing.  He&#39;s still<br/>
printing, but suddenly using both capitals and lower case letters<br/>
appropriately, and the words were quite even and well spaced on the page.<br/>
His sentence structure and grammar, and punctuation  were impressive too.<br/>
Go figure.<br/>

This has been our experience -- my daughter sometimes says: &quot;No, Mom, I don&#39;t <br/>
want to learn anything today.  Let&#39;s read a book.&quot;  Sometimes I think she <br/>
gets more on those days.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He is getting frustrated though.  Today he even almost started to cry<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 11 year old daughter was determined by a special reading teacher in first<br/>
grade to be unable to grasp phonics.  Although as time went on she did get<br/>
better she still does not sound things out.<br/>
<br/>
Some children just have some sort of block in their minds that keeps them<br/>
from being able to grasp phonics.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe trying sight reading will make all the difference.  I tried that with<br/>
my daughter and it was the best thing we could have done.  Children can<br/>
remember words from their looks so easily.  If you think about it, that&#39;s<br/>
the way we read too, when we already know the word.  Noone who knows a word<br/>
sits there and sounds it out, you know it by sight.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember what resources we used except a couple of workbooks by<br/>
Frank Shaeffer and some early reading books that concentrated on sight<br/>
reading.  If you go to a large bookstore or an educational store you will<br/>
surely find some of these materials.<br/>

Read my message about Reading in Good Time if you want my opinion about<br/>
when kids &quot;should&quot; read and write.  But as to the frustating day, I am<br/>
having one myself.  The baby did not sleep well last night (we are trying<br/>
to teach him to sleep through the night,) which means that nobody slept<br/>
well last night.  My husband was late for work and I did not get a shower<br/>
this morning.  My toddler would not eat his breakfast but made a big mess<br/>
with it instead.  The baby has been wandering around crying all morning<br/>
because he is so tired and is already taking his second nap today.  My<br/>
toddler then cut his foot and refuses to keep his bandage on, despite my<br/>
telling him that he needs it (cut was bloody and on the bottom of his<br/>
foot.)  Then he started hitting his brother, probably because he is<br/>
annoying him as much as he is me, which redoubled the crying.<br/>
<br/>
So I tried seperating them and having my toddler play in his room with his<br/>
leggos for a while, but when I was upstairs getting them out and getting<br/>
him interested in them, the baby dumped my entire can of pepsi all over<br/>
himself and my light colored rug.  Now I will have to shampoo the carpet or<br/>
we will all be stuck to the floor.  Baby then had to get a change of<br/>
clothes and a good wiping down, and into bed he goes for that second nap.<br/>
When I am coming out of the hall my toddler practically throws himself in<br/>
front of me and I come very close to having a very bad fall.<br/>
<br/>
I am counting to ten, and waiting patiently until their father gets home<br/>
and can take over, as I need a break!  Hang in there, we all have those days!<br/>

<br/>
This is my almost-7-yr-old son exactly!!!! <br/>
<br/>
We did Calvert 1st grade this past year and are trying to loosen up <br/>
considerably from here on out. Mike reads at the <br/>
end-of-first/beginning-of-second grade level, which (I keep telling myself) <br/>
is right &quot;on schedule.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of problems finding stuff for him to practice on because most of <br/>
the stuff that&#39;s written at his level doesn&#39;t especially interest him. He has <br/>
enjoyed a few of the step-into-reading books, like Purple Pickle Juice (a <br/>
Mercer Mayer Critters of the Night book) and Bully Trouble and The Missing <br/>
Tooth (about 2 kids who are best friends). But a lot of the things my friends <br/>
recommend like the Bernstein Bears just don&#39;t turn him on at all!<br/>
<br/>
He wants to read Jurassic Park and Goosebumps and Animorphs and seems to feel <br/>
demoralized that he&#39;s just not ready yet!<br/>
<br/>
I try very hard not to show my own anxieties about it. But I must admit that <br/>
I would feel better about unschooling if his reading skills were more <br/>
advanced. :(<br/>

There is an essay in the back of one hsing book called of Daisy&#39;s and <br/>
Diesel&#39;s, or something close to that.   The point of the essay is to examine <br/>
just what the kids are doing instead of reading, what would reading replace <br/>
in their day??  Instead of saying he&#39;s just not ready to read fluently, look <br/>
for what he IS doing developmentally and ask yourself why giving up those <br/>
skills in order to read is important.  <br/>
<br/>
Children who aren&#39;t reading yet spend more time reasoning than readers.  How <br/>
do I do this......well a reader just goes for the directions or resource <br/>
book. A non-reader has to think it through.<br/>
<br/>
Why would you push the children to stop thinking for themselves and instead <br/>
inform themselves of what other people thought out?????<br/>

I don&#39;t know if this would help, or be what you would want, but I used <br/>
Learning Language Arts thru Literature to teach my oldest to read.  My <br/>
youngest had two years of listening to his brother learn phonics and play the <br/>

 I really like LLATL and adapted it to what I wanted, it has lots of site <br/>

them.  The early ones are very easy readers, with parts for the parent to read<br/>
too, so the story moves along.  They have a nice feel to them too.  They have<br/>
them from first grade up to 8th.  They are published by Pathways.  Timberdoodle<br/>
has them, and at a great price.  Just a suggestion.  We haven&#39;t tried them yet,<br/>
