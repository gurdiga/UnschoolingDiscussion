<div id="ygrps-yiv-75268079">After reading the article, how are supposed to &#39;calmly&#39; educate this man??? I<br/>
have a few other ideas in mind, but none of them include being calm! Does this<br/>
man hold any office or anything of the sort? If so, he should be kicked out!<br/>
What we do with OUR kids is OUR business, as long as we aren&#39;t hurting them<br/>
and are working towards bettering thier lives! At least we care enough not to<br/>
subject our kids to the ridicule we got in ps!<br/>
Highly annoyed at that man,<br/>
