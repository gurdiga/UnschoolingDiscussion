&gt;Just as a side note; I have a friend who farms her own fish..If you&#39;d like <br/>
&gt;I can see if she&#39;d be willing to talk to you about starting your <br/>
&gt;own/buying from her..She cannot tolerate anything but organic food <br/>
&gt;including meat..She has a very severe allergy to all genetically altered <br/>
&gt;foods she&#39;s come in contact with..<br/>
