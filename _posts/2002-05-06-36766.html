 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t remember learning how to read. It seems as if I always knew how. I<br/>
remember reading a book called &quot;The Runaway Pancake&quot; to my kindergarten<br/>
class. (very similar to &quot;The Gingerbread Man.&quot;) I don&#39;t remember my parents<br/>
reading to me when I was very young either. As I recall, I don&#39;t remember<br/>
them reading to us much at all until I was about 10 or 11. I don&#39;t know how<br/>
I picked it up, but I did. BTW my parents were FORCED to send me to<br/>
headstart when I was 4 because we were &quot;underpriviledged&quot;, translate that to<br/>
mean poor. My mom tried to fight it, I am not sure why maybe stigma of being<br/>
poor, but she told me that apparently the government thought that being poor<br/>
also meant a non-enriched environment or stupid. I could read before I went<br/>
to headstart! We had World Book Encyclopedias and Child Craft. I can<br/>
remember even when I was very young taking not just the Child Craft out and<br/>
reading it on my own, but also the encyclopedia, for long periods of time. I<br/>
really enjoyed them, and I used them so much that my parents eventually just<br/>
moved the entire set into my room, so of course I bought a set for my<br/>
family. I have been disapointed that my own kids have not used them as much<br/>
as I did. They are starting to use them more though, now that I have been<br/>
trying to get out of the habit of telling them to go look something up when<br/>
they ask me a question, but instead now when they ask me something I say<br/>
something like &quot;well, lets look it up and find out&quot;, or &quot;I&#39;ll go look it up<br/>
and let you know&quot; and then I go look it up and usually they come with me and<br/>
read along. Since I have changed my way of saying it, they now look up more<br/>
on their own, or ask me to look up something with them.<br/>
<br/>
Remember Scout from To Kill A Mockingbird? She got in trouble when she<br/>
started school because she already knew how to read! If I remember right,<br/>
she learned from her father reading the newspaper with her. Hey, maybe<br/>
that&#39;s how I learned how to read! My dad and I shared a love for newspaper<br/>
comics, maybe he read them outloud to me and I just don&#39;t remember. He<br/>
passed away when I was 19, so I can&#39;t ask him.<br/>
<br/>
Suzanna, who still loves to read and look things up; and still loves<br/>
newspaper comics.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Same here. I knew how to read long before kindergarten. I distinctly remember <br/>
being in K and writing long rows of &quot;big E&#39;s&quot; and &quot;little e&#39;s&quot; and wondering <br/>
why my parents put me in a class with kids who didn&#39;t know their letters or <br/>
how to read. My ds started reading without much input from me around his <br/>
fourth birthday and now reads at a &quot;1st-2nd grade level.&quot; Luckily, this <br/>
occurrence made my homeschool-doubting family feel that I must be doing <br/>
something right! LOL<br/>
