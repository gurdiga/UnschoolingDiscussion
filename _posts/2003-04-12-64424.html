<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256701051">Brianna and I have a home business and we&#39;re pow wow traders. Just about every weekend we&#39;re at powwow. She gets paid $25.00 per day at pow wow. That&#39;s $50.00 per week. That&#39;s the standard that traders pay. In my opinion, Brianna does more than someone I would hire  - she helps me load the van, she helps at home etc. I can&#39;t afford to pay her more. There are some traders that don&#39;t pay their kids. I disagree w/ that. Why shouldn&#39;t Brianna get as much as someone that doesn&#39;t know our stock as well and that I can&#39;t trust as much??<br/>
During our off season, she gets $25.00 per feast/festival - but these are usually one day affairs.<br/>
As for the house, well, every once in a while I go crazy and go on a cleaning binge - she helps if she wants.<br/>
I do make her pick up anything that our dog can choke on or destroy - but Brianna&#39;s good about that.<br/>

<p><small><time>12 Apr 2003, at 10:30am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333299187">Zoe is my oldest and she is 6.5 years old.  When she turned 6, we<br/>
realized that we hadn&#39;t explicitly ever given her an allowance or any<br/>
type of cash money to use as she wanted.  We figured out what we could<br/>
always afford to give her and started at that.  Currently it is $3 per<br/>
time DH gets paid, or $6 a month.  No, this isn&#39;t a lot, but it is when<br/>
you consider that we have budgeted money to be able to buy her anything<br/>
that she wants food, book, clothing, arts & crafts, and experiment<br/>
wise.  She just needs to tell me what she wants and I&#39;ll happily buy it<br/>
(she&#39;s not asking for expensive things, just things like yeast and pipe<br/>
cleaners and tapioca).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she has come up with some creative purchases.  She is a Girl<br/>
Scout and she spent quite a bit of her money purchasing cookies (some<br/>
for a charity, too).  She has also bought her 2.5 year old sister a<br/>
stuffed animal on a whim.  This money is not associated with chores.  We<br/>
have no &quot;child has to do chores&quot;.  She does, however, often help me do<br/>
the dishes/laundry/vacuuming (she&#39;s excited that she&#39;s finally big<br/>
enough to physically run the vacuum).  We rarely require cleaning done<br/>
by the kids and even then it is usually just, &quot;Please don&#39;t bring<br/>
anything new out until I&#39;ve finished cleaning the floor or table in<br/>
order to give you a fresh clean place to have things.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I am a part-time professional photographer from my home and Zoe really<br/>
loves to help.  She is quite knowledgeable about cameras and lighting<br/>
setup, etc.  So, whenever she helps me with a photo shoot, I pay her. <br/>
Depending on how much she works and how much I make for the job, I give<br/>
her between $5-$20 per job.  This is never required of her, but rather<br/>
an opportunity that is available if she wants to do it.  I also do<br/>
contract web design projects that I get paid for.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a funny/cute story that happened last night:<br/>
Note that I&#39;ve *never* required her to clean her room, and once a month<br/>
or so DH and I will go in and clean it all (with her permission and<br/>
strong desire to find things!!).  Anyway, last night she was asking me<br/>
the difference between contract work and having a regular job (like<br/>
DH).  She liked the idea of paying someone one time to do a specific<br/>
job.  She thought for a bit, then asked if she could pay me to clean her<br/>
room!  I asked her when she needed it done by, how much she was willing<br/>
to pay, the details of what she wanted cleaned, etc.  She wants it done<br/>
by Sunday, is willing to pay half of all the money she has (I don&#39;t know<br/>
what that amount is), and she just wants the stuff that belongs in other<br/>
rooms put away and the bed made (all stuff that I actually already<br/>
regularly do).  I&#39;m excited that she finally noticed that these things<br/>
need to be done.  :)  I told her that I&#39;d do all that and more,<br/>
willingly and for free, if she&#39;d just keep me company.  She is insisting<br/>
on paying me though, so I guess that I&#39;ve got a new job.  :)<br/>
<br/>
-Lisa in AZ<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  My 2.5 year old cleans for no pay, too.  I have a good routine for<br/>
washing clothes.  I always wash a load a day (put in a combo<br/>
washer/dryer at night and take out in the morning).  We presort our<br/>
dirties into baskets on the closet floor and whichever is the most full<br/>
gets washed that night (we also wash diapers).  I will do the laundry in<br/>
the morning and my 2.5 year insists on helping me carry the basket of<br/>
clean clothes.  She often disappears when I get the clothes to the<br/>
bedroom and I discover that she takes the dirty clothes to the wash all<br/>
on her own.  She starting doing this- for fun- when she was just a year<br/>
and a half old!  We live in a ranch style house with no basement, so it<br/>
is safe.  She also loves to unload the dishwasher.  She is a born<br/>
organizer.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290798122">It does help a lot to just make sure they have a bit of money so that <br/>
when they&#39;re wanting to buy things that I don&#39;t feel comfortable <br/>
spending our family money on - I can say, &quot;Why don&#39;t you buy that with <br/>
your own money?&quot; That gets them to consider a bit more seriously how <br/>
much the whateveritis is really worth to them.<br/>
<br/>
The minute my kids hit the teenage girl state of mind of caring more <br/>
about clothes, I started giving them a big enough amount of money, on a <br/>
monthly basis, that I felt comfortable saying that they were <br/>
responsible entirely for their own clothes. That way I NEVER had to <br/>
deal with them wanting to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a <br/>
trendy or badly-made item of clothing. My girls are also extremely <br/>
generous and always seeing things they want to buy for their friends - <br/>
things they are sure their friends will &quot;just LOOOVE.&quot;  So making sure <br/>
they had some money coming in was a way that I could get out of that <br/>
problem too - I hated to not buy things they wanted to give to friends, <br/>
but it was a lot of money they were wanting to spend. Now they are just <br/>
as generous, but also quite a bit more discerning.<br/>
<br/>
We give a small allowance - seems to be less than anybody else around <br/>
here. They get their age, once a month. So the 12 yo gets $12 per month.<br/>
<br/>
I expect chores to be helped out with when I ask - but am understanding <br/>
about it and don&#39;t insist if they are busy doing other things. Money <br/>
isn&#39;t tied to chores.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-651973017">I absolutely refused to put quarters in vending machines, and eventually <br/>
started an allowance because of that. My kids (3 and 5) get 75 cents a <br/>
week. The 3 will occasionally put some in a vending machine, but has <br/>
also spent on some longer-lasting stuff like a bowl with a straw made in <br/>
it from the grocery store. The 5-year-old wants to spend his only on <br/>
TRAIN stuff, but will occasionally talk his sister into buying him some <br/>
candy too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Like I said, our kids *can* earn about 30.00 per month (or more) for <br/>
chores/extra work, etc, but it is their option.  Before we began doing foster <br/>
care, my kids (any age) got about 3.00 per week.  But because we receive a <br/>
monthly stipend for each foster child, I felt it&#39;s &quot;their&quot; money, so they <br/>
need to get a fair portion of it to spend as they please.  Well, I couldn&#39;t <br/>
very well give them that much and not my biological kids, so that&#39;s why they <br/>
got the increase.  If they choose not to do any chores, they still get money, <br/>
but it goes in a bank.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it evens out either way.  If you don&#39;t give your child any allowance <br/>
or a small amount, but then spend more on them at the store, what&#39;s the <br/>
difference?  The way we do it, they just get the cash and spend it as they <br/>
see fit.<br/>

  Hey Janis, I was wondering if you come to any pow wows/festivals in the <br/>
  downstate/Hudson Valley area of New York state.  We love to go to pow wows, <br/>
  and it would be wonderful to meet you and Brianna.  I&#39;m keeping my fingers <br/>
  crossed.<br/>

  &gt;Brianna and I have a home business and we&#39;re pow wow traders. Just about <br/>
  &gt;every weekend we&#39;re at powwow. She gets paid $25.00 per day at pow wow. <br/>
  &gt;That&#39;s $50.00 per week. That&#39;s the standard that traders pay. In my <br/>
  &gt;opinion, Brianna does more than someone I would hire  - she helps me load <br/>
  &gt;the van, she helps at home etc. I can&#39;t afford to pay her more. There are <br/>
  &gt;some traders that don&#39;t pay their kids. I disagree w/ that. Why shouldn&#39;t <br/>
  &gt;Brianna get as much as someone that doesn&#39;t know our stock as well and <br/>
  &gt;that I can&#39;t trust as much??<br/>
  &gt;During our off season, she gets $25.00 per feast/festival - but these are <br/>
  &gt;usually one day affairs.<br/>
  &gt;As for the house, well, every once in a while I go crazy and go on a <br/>
  &gt;cleaning binge - she helps if she wants.<br/>
  &gt;I do make her pick up anything that our dog can choke on or destroy - but <br/>
  &gt;Brianna&#39;s good about that.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Sometimes, when we&#39;re broke - she&#39;ll go into her savings to help.<br/>

  &gt;   &gt; &gt; When we&#39;re in the check-out aisle and my kids are drooling over the<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &gt; candy, I say something like, &quot;I know.  That candy *does* look<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &gt; delicious,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t it?  It makes me want to hurry up and check out so we can go<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &gt; home and bake cookies.&quot;  Also it helps that I have never, ever bought<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; &gt; candy in the check-out aisle.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; I pretty much always say yes if they ask. Candy is cheap and if that is<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; what they want, it is fine with me.  They only ask once in a while.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Rosie went through a stage of wanting tic-tacs every time we shopped.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; So - 75 cents once or twice a week? I can manage that.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Yeah, that&#39;s reasonable...Plus, our kids always have money.  Which <br/>
  &gt; brings up<br/>
  &gt;   another thing I am almost afraid to mention...LoL...chores and being <br/>
  &gt; paid for<br/>
  &gt;   work.  At our home the kids, just by doing one chore a day plus keeping <br/>
  &gt; their<br/>
  &gt;   rooms reasonably straightened, can earn about 30.00 per month.  There are<br/>
  &gt;   other things we all pitch in to do that are not paid for because we are <br/>
  &gt; doing<br/>
  &gt;   it &#39;for the family&quot; (we are adding onto the house right now) and we never<br/>
  &gt;   force anyone to work.  We also have special things needed done that we <br/>
  &gt; will<br/>
  &gt;   pay extra for (bringing wood in which EVERYONE hates, for example.)  We <br/>
  &gt; never<br/>
  &gt;   bug anyone to do their chore or their room...it&#39;s all their <br/>
  &gt; choice.  But we<br/>
  &gt;   do monitor who is doing it and who is not and they are rewarded for <br/>
  &gt; it.  They<br/>
  &gt;   know that by doing these things, I am paying them because they are <br/>
  &gt; taking a<br/>
  &gt;   big load off of my back (we have 6 kids at home total, I do about 3 or <br/>
  &gt; more<br/>
  &gt;   loads of laundry per day alone) and because I really appreciate their <br/>
  &gt; help.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Anyhow, if they always have money, it does eliminate them even asking for<br/>
  &gt;   stuff, although I am often buying candy or goodies anyway.  We have a <br/>
  &gt; lot of<br/>
  &gt;   opportunities for one-on-one time  (dr&#39;s appointments, foster care agency<br/>
  &gt;   meetings, etc) so it&#39;s so nice to go out to lunch or shopping and treat <br/>
  &gt; that<br/>
  &gt;   one kid by themselves :o)  Lots of sharing and discussion when there&#39;s <br/>
  &gt; only<br/>
  &gt;   the 2 of you in the car.<br/>

<br/>
  Zoe is my oldest and she is 6.5 years old.  When she turned 6, we<br/>
  realized that we hadn&#39;t explicitly ever given her an allowance or any<br/>
  type of cash money to use as she wanted.  We figured out what we could<br/>
  always afford to give her and started at that.  Currently it is $3 per<br/>
  time DH gets paid, or $6 a month.  No, this isn&#39;t a lot, but it is when<br/>
  you consider that we have budgeted money to be able to buy her anything<br/>
  that she wants food, book, clothing, arts & crafts, and experiment<br/>
  wise.  She just needs to tell me what she wants and I&#39;ll happily buy it<br/>
  (she&#39;s not asking for expensive things, just things like yeast and pipe<br/>
  cleaners and tapioca).<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, she has come up with some creative purchases.  She is a Girl<br/>
  Scout and she spent quite a bit of her money purchasing cookies (some<br/>
  for a charity, too).  She has also bought her 2.5 year old sister a<br/>
  stuffed animal on a whim.  This money is not associated with chores.  We<br/>
  have no &quot;child has to do chores&quot;.  She does, however, often help me do<br/>
  the dishes/laundry/vacuuming (she&#39;s excited that she&#39;s finally big<br/>
  enough to physically run the vacuum).  We rarely require cleaning done<br/>
  by the kids and even then it is usually just, &quot;Please don&#39;t bring<br/>
  anything new out until I&#39;ve finished cleaning the floor or table in<br/>
  order to give you a fresh clean place to have things.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
  I am a part-time professional photographer from my home and Zoe really<br/>
  loves to help.  She is quite knowledgeable about cameras and lighting<br/>
  setup, etc.  So, whenever she helps me with a photo shoot, I pay her. <br/>
  Depending on how much she works and how much I make for the job, I give<br/>
  her between $5-$20 per job.  This is never required of her, but rather<br/>
  an opportunity that is available if she wants to do it.  I also do<br/>
  contract web design projects that I get paid for.<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s a funny/cute story that happened last night:<br/>
  Note that I&#39;ve *never* required her to clean her room, and once a month<br/>
  or so DH and I will go in and clean it all (with her permission and<br/>
  strong desire to find things!!).  Anyway, last night she was asking me<br/>
  the difference between contract work and having a regular job (like<br/>
  DH).  She liked the idea of paying someone one time to do a specific<br/>
  job.  She thought for a bit, then asked if she could pay me to clean her<br/>
  room!  I asked her when she needed it done by, how much she was willing<br/>
  to pay, the details of what she wanted cleaned, etc.  She wants it done<br/>
  by Sunday, is willing to pay half of all the money she has (I don&#39;t know<br/>
  what that amount is), and she just wants the stuff that belongs in other<br/>
  rooms put away and the bed made (all stuff that I actually already<br/>
  regularly do).  I&#39;m excited that she finally noticed that these things<br/>
  need to be done.  :)  I told her that I&#39;d do all that and more,<br/>
  willingly and for free, if she&#39;d just keep me company.  She is insisting<br/>
  on paying me though, so I guess that I&#39;ve got a new job.  :)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  P.S.  My 2.5 year old cleans for no pay, too.  I have a good routine for<br/>
  washing clothes.  I always wash a load a day (put in a combo<br/>
  washer/dryer at night and take out in the morning).  We presort our<br/>
  dirties into baskets on the closet floor and whichever is the most full<br/>
  gets washed that night (we also wash diapers).  I will do the laundry in<br/>
  the morning and my 2.5 year insists on helping me carry the basket of<br/>
  clean clothes.  She often disappears when I get the clothes to the<br/>
  bedroom and I discover that she takes the dirty clothes to the wash all<br/>
  on her own.  She starting doing this- for fun- when she was just a year<br/>
  and a half old!  We live in a ranch style house with no basement, so it<br/>
  is safe.  She also loves to unload the dishwasher.  She is a born<br/>
  organizer.<br/>
