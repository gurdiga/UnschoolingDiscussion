&lt;&lt; basic household<br/>
<br/>
duties (cooking, cleaning) leave him with large blocks of alone time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i am just surprised that he is not right there with you doing these.  my <br/>
seven year old cooks and cleans with me (plus on her own when i am busy with <br/>
other things!  she has required chores and cooks for fun.)  to me it gives <br/>
the wrong message if one is sitting vegging while someone else is work, work, <br/>
working...  we are all a team, we have work to do, we can talk about what <br/>
game to play afterwards while we wash and dry these dishes.  i&#39;ll sweep this <br/>
floor while you sort the recycling.  will you get the dw emptied while i <br/>
start supper?  open 2 cans of crm mush soup and we will need a bag of frozen <br/>
veggies from the downstairs freezer....  etc etc...</div>

<br/>
the habit. &gt;&gt;<br/>
