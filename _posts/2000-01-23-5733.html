&lt;&lt; I&#39;m in Cary, Jenny--I know another Jennifer who&#39;s unschooling in the east <br/>
Raleigh area, unless you&#39;re she!  She&#39;s wonderful, by the way, and I didn&#39;t <br/>
know she went by Jenny, so you&#39;re probably not the same person...<br/>
     If you&#39;re another Jenny, is Cary too far away? :) &gt;&gt;<br/>

        Heavens no, Cary is not far away at all.  I live between Clayton and <br/>
Wendell and we come to Raleigh about once a week for soccer and church.  Love <br/>
to talk more particulars -- is it appropriate to do it here or should we <br/>
continue &quot;off-list&quot; ?<br/>
