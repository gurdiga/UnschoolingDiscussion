<div id="ygrps-yiv-581002372">I&#39;m wondering what everyone&#39;s input is on older kids who can&#39;t get to <br/>
sleep without mom.  My daughter is 9, and is used to me laying with <br/>
her, talking with her and praying with her, and singing the same two <br/>
songs every night before she goes to sleep.  I don&#39;t mind doing this <br/>
at all, but I&#39;m wondering if I should be worried about her.  She <br/>
can&#39;t sleep over at friend&#39;s houses because I&#39;m not there.  She wants <br/>
to go to sleepovers but almost always comes home crying.  I&#39;ve <br/>
offered to come to the sleepover when she calls me to tell me she&#39;s <br/>
ready to go to sleep, and sing to her.  That doesn&#39;t work.  I&#39;ve <br/>
tried cuddling and singing to her before she goes, and that doesn&#39;t <br/>
work.  I just worry that she won&#39;t ever be able to leave mom. I mean, <br/>
I don&#39;t want her to be 20 and still need me.  Should I keep singing <br/>
and laying with her at night or should I start insisting that she <br/>
learn to sleep without me?</div>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s my (long-winded) take on the subject:  My Bradley instructor had a <br/>
wonderful metaphor for me when I was getting ready to give birth all those <br/>
nearly eight years ago!  She wanted me to respect the labor process and <br/>
understand that not all development happens in ways we can see.  So, <br/>
although I might be in labor and chugging along and at 5 cm and getting <br/>
ready to go into transition soon, but there might be some further <br/>
development that has to happen (spiritually, even), and the process could <br/>
sort of stop for a while until this other thing catches up.  She said that <br/>
doctors usually call this &quot;failure to progress,&quot; but it really may not <br/>
be.  Okay, here&#39;s the metaphor she gave me:  She said that all the apples <br/>
ripen on an apple tree, but not all at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
My point is this:  Our kids are all moving along in a progression of sorts, <br/>
but not everyone moves at the same rate.  Because we humans like to <br/>
quantify things, we might say that some kid is &quot;developmentally delayed,&quot; <br/>
but I don&#39;t agree entirely with that.<br/>
<br/>
This is just my guess, but on some level your daughter may need you because <br/>
she is still working on some aspect of her Self.  If you can be patient <br/>
(and it sounds like you are wonderfully patient) to continue to allow her <br/>
to unfold in her time--the way a blossom is allowed to unfold--I think she <br/>
will get to the point where she is feeling independent enough to do her own <br/>
bedtime routine, and one day she&#39;ll sleep over other folks&#39; houses and get <br/>
married and all sorts of stuff (good stuff!) that you can&#39;t even imagine <br/>
now!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, it sounds like a wonderful bedtime routine you guys have <br/>
going!  (Sorry this is so long!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642249943">My Daughter is 9 yo, she still sleeps in the family bed. I am not concerned<br/>
at all, her brother is 12 and sometimes he will come sleep with us, my<br/>
oldest 13 yo, sometimes she does as well(although rare, but she has that<br/>
option). When I was little, I wasnt allowed, bad dreams, being scared, didnt<br/>
matter. So I allow this luxury to our children. I guess some might find it<br/>
wrong, or blah blah, but we as a family do not.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, Tami<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461063552">My kids are 8, almost 10, and almost 12.  More often than not, they sleep on <br/>
the floor in my room.  My 9 y.o. daughter is usually on the floor right next <br/>
to my bed; she likes to hold my hand as she falls asleep.  I don&#39;t have a <br/>
problem with this.  Physical affection is a very real need, whether you are <br/>
two years old or 20-I know that if they&#39;re getting these needs met by me and <br/>
my husband, they won&#39;t be looking to have them met somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always gotten grief from others about &#39;holding my kids too much&#39;-more <br/>
when they were little-but *I* know that I&#39;m doing the right thing.  Plus, I <br/>
like it, too!<br/>
<br/>
The bedtime problems do get better.  Bedtimes were a nightmare when they <br/>
were little, partly because I worked evenings, but over the years I <br/>
developed the attitude that as long as they didn&#39;t disrupt *my* sleep, (In <br/>
other words, as long as they aren&#39;t tossing and turning and hogging the <br/>
covers!) they were welcome in my bed, or on the floor.  We&#39;ve tried every <br/>
arrangement imaginable-mattresses on the floor, cots, etc.  Now they just <br/>
bring in their sleeping bags.  I&#39;m planning to get the biggest king-sized <br/>
bed I can find, now that they&#39;re bigger.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m, frankly, happy that my 11 y.o. ds wants to be in my room; he likes to <br/>
come in and read at night while I&#39;m watching tv or reading.  Other kids his <br/>
age are getting into girls, and we all know how young some kids are starting <br/>
to have sex.  I&#39;m not about to turn him away.<br/>
<br/>
There are some nights when my husband and I tell them to sleep somewhere <br/>
else, and they&#39;re usually OK with that.  I think back to my child psych <br/>
class, and how infants and toddlers need to develop trust; I think the same <br/>
is true of older kids.  When they need (or want) us, and we turn them away, <br/>
how are they supposed to trust us?  Or trust their own feelings, for that <br/>
matter?<br/>
<br/>

Our daughter didn&#39;t sleep in a bedroom by herself until after she was nine <br/>
(she&#39;s now almost 10). But she still comes and sleeps in our bed from time <br/>
to time. I don&#39;t personally think you have anything to worry about :-)<br/>

OH! <br/>
<br/>
Consider taping your voice.  We did that sometimes. I taped reading a book, <br/>
and I have a tape of me doing ballads and there were times I wasn&#39;t around <br/>
and Marty went to sleep by the mom tapes.<br/>
