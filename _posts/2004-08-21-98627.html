<div id="ygrps-yiv-23238259">Once it becomes a habit, it doesn&#39;t seem like very much work. But here are a few ideas that require little or no preparation: <br/>
<br/>
Get an apple corer/slicer - a metal device that you push over the top of the apple - it takes out the core and cuts into 6 or 8 slices easily. (Any kitchen supply store would ahve them.)  If you kids don&#39;t eat the peal (mine do), you would still have to peal them, though.   The slices are especially yummy with a light sprinkling of cinnamon.<br/>
<br/>
Bagged baby carrots (which are really normal carrots precut into baby carrot shape).<br/>
<br/>
Cut up vegies and keep in ziplocks in the refrigerator (they&#39;ll last a week or so - maybe more, we always eat them within a week) <br/>
<br/>
Mix honey and cashew butter together and store in fridge.  Delicious with tart green apples. <br/>
<br/>
Pretzels. <br/>
<br/>
String cheese. <br/>
<br/>
Frozen blueberries (or fresh in season). <br/>
<br/>
Shelled edamame (frozen) <br/>
<br/>
Raisins and other dried fruit. <br/>
<br/>
Frozen juice or smoothie popsicles (we got our molds at bed, bath, beyond, but they have really fun (and more expensive) ones at William Sonoma, and probably hve them at Walmart, also. <br/>
<br/>
Peanutbutter balls -- I made mine with high quality cocoa powder and agave nectar (you could use honey) and no salt/no sugar peanut butter, and quick cooking oats. Mix together, form into balls for easy eating -- keeps in the refrigerator for at least several days (the longest a batch have ever lasted here). <br/>

   also providing or having more<br/>
  healthful snacks on hand and easily available is also important.  <br/>
<br/>
  ....<br/>
<br/>
  Carrots, apple, cheese, etc are not always immediately edible, and<br/>
  require cleaning,  peeling, cutting, etc - by me for the younger ones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ....<br/>
<br/>
    How do others keep healthful food choices as available to themselves and<br/>
  their kids as the shelf-stable more sugary/fried choices?<br/>

<h4>Penne & Buddies</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555037525">Wow, I love these tips!  My kids are hooked on raisins and bananas <br/>
(the fastest food around for babies and toddlers!) Grapes are quick, <br/>
too, but I can&#39;t keep a toddler from grabbing a handful despite my <br/>
best efforts to make them &quot;baby-safe.&quot;  I figure if they&#39;re big <br/>
enough to toddle over and grab fruit from a vine, they can probably <br/>
handle it and there&#39;s never been a problem.  Who can resist a bunch <br/>
of fresh, delicious grapes?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, PB&J on the halfshell LOL -- this is easy for the kids; grab one <br/>
slice of bread, spread half with P.B. (this side first &#39;cuz it stays <br/>
in place and the jelly is messier) and half with jam (spreads easier <br/>
than jelly), then fold and eat!  I do it this way, buffet style, <br/>
when I have eight hungry kids standing in line for a snack.  Cuts <br/>
the wait time in half and I get to eat, too! :o)<br/>
<br/>
I also quickslice pears, nectarines (they hate peach fuzz), and <br/>
apples _around_ the core, then quarter.  If I need something more <br/>
substantial in a hurry, I put out the crackers and P.B. (the natural <br/>
kind even tastes better on apples than the sugar-filled stuff, <br/>
though we like both.)  I&#39;m planning to try out the apple <br/>
corer/peeler/slicer from Pampered Chef(.com) sometime soon.  We&#39;re <br/>
using their starter program for homeschool economics this year.  The <br/>
kids already love to cook, and I figured they&#39;d have fun learning <br/>
how to run their own business and put on a show.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else familiar with this company?  My DIL got involved with <br/>
them this summer and the more I read about their company history and <br/>
founder, the more impressed I was with the original idea (though <br/>
like any direct sales, the concept and the customers can be <br/>
abused.)  If we end up enjoying the program, I&#39;m thinking my <br/>
daughter can use it to meet friends and make a little money while <br/>
she&#39;s away at art school.  She found an atelier in Toronto (far cry <br/>
from Florida!) at the Art Renewal Center &lt; www.artrenewal.org &gt; and <br/>
is very excited about pursuing her love of fine art!  <br/>
<br/>
It never fails, one thing leads to another and I end up modifying <br/>
the subject line! :o) HAND-PDA<br/>
