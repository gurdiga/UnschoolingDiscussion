<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943110022">I used to be *bad* at directions and names.  I was happy to reinforce that to myself.  &quot;I&#39;m bad at directions.&quot;  &quot;I never remember names.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I decided to change.  I realized that a major reason those things were difficult for me was that I didn&#39;t pay attention.  So I began to concentrate when going somewhere or when meeting someone.  I still forgot sometimes, but am SO much better at those skills.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you won&#39;t remember someone&#39;s name if you don&#39;t focus when you hear it, brain damaged or not.  If I&#39;ve just met someone, and realize their name slipped by me, I&#39;ll ask again.  I&#39;ll look at them and repeat their name in my head.  I&#39;ll try to use it a few times in our introductory conversation and repeat it at the end as well.<br/>
<br/>
I look at street signs and make mental notes about landmarks and whether they are on the right or the left or north or south.<br/>
<br/>
Although these skills are probably related to the differing intelligences, most people can still at least improve them with effort and practice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52108959">That very well could be my problem, but I don&#39;t remember having <br/>
prior to drug use.  In fact, I remember having an excellent memory <br/>
and remembered names, dates, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe maybe it could have more to do with me telling myself I <br/>
have memory problems verses simply not paying attention.  I will try <br/>
paying closer attention.  <br/>
