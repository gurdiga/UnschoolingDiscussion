<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596210974">My 7 year old, soon to be 8 is starting to really get into the Yu Gi Oh card <br/>
game.  I&#39;m sure there are others on the list who have kids that know more <br/>
then me and could point us in a good direction to learn more about this. He <br/>
has purchased the starter set and it looks like I may also to play with him <br/>
we are reading the game rules but would like to know more.  Any help would be <br/>
appreciated.  My son has some delayed motor skill and doesn&#39;t write so for <br/>
him to be interested in something finally I want to jump right in and not <br/>
discourage him.<br/>
<br/>
thanks so much<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636411066">Kirby runs the Yu Gi Oh tournaments every week where he works.<br/>
<br/>
He says the company that publishes that game has a website:  upperdeck.com<br/>
and you might find more information there.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ll both be playing you&#39;ll need another deck, or buy enough boosters to <br/>
make another deck (will take at least five boosters, probably more).    Some <br/>
cards are restricted to one or two.  Kirby says he would never suggest making <br/>
a deck out of boosters right off the bat, just buy another deck.<br/>
<br/>
All the instructions are inside the deck.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby says maybe he could use a calculator, or some tool to keep track of <br/>
numbers between 1 and 8,000.  That number needs to be visible by the opponent <br/>
at all times.<br/>
<br/>
Also, he says, if you find a place where they&#39;re having tournaments, or even <br/>
just selling the game and they have gaming tables in the shop, he&#39;s sure you <br/>
can find someone there will be willing to help you learn to play--either a <br/>
customer or an employee.  You might just have to ask about when&#39;s a good time.<br/>
<br/>
You might also go and watch a tournament and look over the shoulders of <br/>
people playing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719971867">Trevor just bought a game for his Gameboy advanced which utilizes Yugioh <br/>
cards, he&#39;s been absorbed for two days in nothing but that game.<br/>
You input numbers from actual cards and then you can use them in the game.<br/>
He&#39;s been going around asking people to see their cards so he can input the <br/>
codes off of them.<br/>
That might be a fun way to learn more about Yugioh if your children have <br/>
Gameboy advanced.<br/>
It&#39;s titled Eternal Duelist Soul.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832068992">First off, find out when Yu-Gi-Oh in on TV. It is REALLY TRULY AWESOME!<br/>
Very intense. Watch it for background info.<br/>
Is there a gaming store near you? The may very well have a time where your <br/>
son can go to learn the game and play with others on his level.<br/>
And, of course, there is always Google!<br/>
