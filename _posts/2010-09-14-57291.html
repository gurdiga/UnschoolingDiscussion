In a system where testing scores is how a school demonstrates value and where <br/>
you can get more funding if you have more children who have a diagnosis of one <br/>
learning disability or another it seems inevitable that these will be the <br/>
outcome. It may help people who are pulling their children out of school to <br/>
realise that the motivations of the school and it&#39;s beuracrats are different to <br/>
the motivations of the child or the parent. <br/>

<br/>
In a quote from the article, it&#39;s easy to see just how the motivations of a <br/>
school are very different than the motivations of a parent.  Having higher <br/>
expectations and better teaching won&#39;t lead to fewer children being identified <br/>
as having special needs.  I think it has little to do with &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; <br/>
teaching at all and I truly believe &quot;higher expectations&quot; are often more harmful <br/>
to children.<br/>
<br/>
 “Higher expectations of all children, and better teaching and learning, would <br/>
lead to fewer children being identified as having special educational needs.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many parents really believe that?  Probably lots!  I opted not to <br/>
send Chamille to school when she was 5 and ready for kindergarten because I <br/>
realized that she was a body with a dollar sign attached to it, nothing more. <br/>
 What was good for her, based on what I felt was good for her, as her parent, <br/>
was dismissed entirely because of low kindergarten enrollment and the need to <br/>
have her butt in a seat at that school.<br/>
<br/>
That was a huge turning point for me!  While an individual teacher might have <br/>
seen some of the cool things about Chamille that I saw, teachers have very <br/>
little power to change or do anything different, and they change each year.   <br/>
They also wanted to start off her kindergarten year without even knowing her, by <br/>
putting her in therapy because they thought she was lacking in fine motor skills <br/>
since she didn&#39;t like to hold a damn pencil.  The larger system didn&#39;t care at <br/>
all, it doesn&#39;t care at all.  It can&#39;t.  It cares about numbers and <br/>
accountability of funds.  Period.<br/>
<br/>
Not one single person could persuade me different.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad I recognized that!  It didn&#39;t take long to find unschooling.  About <br/>
2 weeks into our homeschooling I stumbled across the old unschooling dot com <br/>
boards and it fed my soul and change our lives so drastically and so beautifully <br/>
that I would never go back and change anything!  I&#39;m glad the school system <br/>
showed it&#39;s ugly underbelly and I&#39;m glad I saw it for what it was instead of <br/>
believing what they told me!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is so completely different from what schools do!  I&#39;m not diagnosing <br/>
my children to fit into anything.  They fit into the world because they exist <br/>
and we mesh, like play dough, and squeeze and squish and change and fit into our <br/>
surrounding and we are impressed upon and change and grow and shift and add to <br/>
our beings.  My kids don&#39;t need to be rigid square pegs trying to painfully fit <br/>
into round holes!  For that, I&#39;m so eternally grateful!<br/>
