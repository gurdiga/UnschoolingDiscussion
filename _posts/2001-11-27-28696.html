 </span></blockquote>Since unschooling, my youngest (7 yo ds) is more likely to go to the store <br/>
with me; grocery, WalMart, thrift, used books, etc. Of course he usually <br/>
wants to buy something. Years ago, I most likely would not have given in. <br/>
Nowadays, my thought process has changed. I usually buy and item or two that <br/>
is not a neccesity for myself, why wouldn&#39;t he want to do the same. As a <br/>
result, he often gets to purchase something. (He also always lets me know he <br/>
needed to get something for his older brother who goes to ps.) There are <br/>
times when I tell him no. Perhaps it&#39;s close to his birthday and he will be <br/>
getting toys, or after Halloween and he wants candy when he has pounds of it <br/>
at home. When I do tell him no, I occassionally need to tell him the reason <br/>
I am declining the purchase, but often he doesn&#39;t even question my decision.<br/>
<br/>
In rereading the above paragraph, I also realize that my ps kid (8 yo ds) is <br/>
more difficult to take to the store. Is wants are also ever changing. One <br/>
week it&#39;s Nintendo, the next it&#39;s a football uniform, followed by expensive <br/>
Lego sets. My unschooled child used has an item or two that he wants and it <br/>
seldom changes, until it acquires it. I used to think it was TV that <br/>
affected a child&#39;s neediness for consumer goods, but now I&#39;m not so sure.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering what your thoughts are.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, when dropping off donations at a thrift shop this morning my son really <br/>
wanted the box of Lincoln Logs he spotted. He has some and I had planned on <br/>
purchasing some more for Christmas. We inquired. In the end, without <br/>
haggling, we walked out with a xerox paper box full of Lincoln Logs for <br/>
$3.00!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Stacy, I don&#39;t think the school situation *or* tv  really has much to do with it. IMO kids can be different as night and day and yet come from the same parents, same household. They&#39;re just all wired differently and nothing can change that.<br/>
