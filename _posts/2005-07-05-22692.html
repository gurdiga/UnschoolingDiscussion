<div id="ygrps-yiv-190487305"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You CANNOT tell them about all options. Impossible.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;So - that was an option you chose to tell him about.<br/>
&gt;There are an infinite number of other things you<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t tell him about.<br/>
&gt;-pam<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just got in from out of town, and I know Sandra sent<br/>
a response to this as well, but I can&#39;t find it just<br/>
now.  Anyway, it said pretty much the same thing, so<br/>
I&#39;ll just answer this one.<br/>
******<br/>
The above is true I suppose, or it sounds like it<br/>
should be true.  I couldn&#39;t possibly present him with<br/>
all his options.  But then again, I am drawing a<br/>
complete blank on what things I haven&#39;t told him<br/>
about, thinking back.  I mean, I pretty much present<br/>
him (well both boys) with anything I hear about in<br/>
terms of events, programs, and so forth that there is<br/>
any chance that we might be able to attend or<br/>
participate in.  That&#39;s probably not true, but I just<br/>
can&#39;t think of any examples right now.  <br/>
<br/>
I am most likely just a little brain numb from<br/>
spending the last four days camping with relatives who<br/>
were in an alcoholic haze the entire time (thankfully<br/>
mostly a &#39;happy&#39; haze), as well as relatives who<br/>
practice disrespectful parenting and neices and<br/>
nephews who appeal to me to rescue them when I have no<br/>
ability to do so.  All in all it could have been worse<br/>
really, a lot worse, but still exhausting.  Well, I&#39;m<br/>
hitting the showers and clean sheets while my hubby<br/>
and the kids are out seeing the local fireworks. <br/>
Happy 4th all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834990430">We were at the library the other day and I noticed they were going to <br/>
have a month long Teen Summer Reading thingee with a &quot;medieval&quot; theme. I <br/>
probably would not have mentioned it to Josh, but one of the Thursday <br/>
activities is going to be a Jousting and Stage Combat program that he <br/>
had wanted to take at The Arts Center (he was too old for it) with the <br/>
same facilitator who he also had done an improv thing with earlier this <br/>
year.<br/>
So I just mentioned it to ds. He said that sounded cool and would <br/>
sign-up, but did he really have to read anything or could he just come <br/>
to the jousting thing.<br/>
Now I know the gal who is the Yong Adult Librarian (she waited tables <br/>
with me a few years while getting her degree) and she said she did not <br/>
care what he did---they just wanted the kids to keep track of anything <br/>
they read (that includes cheat codes and strategy guides online OR <br/>
anything I might read out loud to him---which will be about 600 pages <br/>
since Half Blood Prince is coming out) to show progress towards a stated <br/>
goal and get their names in for the prizes she has gotten out of local <br/>
merchants.<br/>
Pretty good prizes: movie passes, free food, free games rentals--that <br/>
kind of stuff.<br/>
He said as long as no one expected him to read anything extra or <br/>
anything at all he was cool with doing it. They get their names put in <br/>
for prizes just for showing up for the programs and showing the &quot;reading <br/>
scroll&quot;  with progress to the librarians.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see how it works out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786240611">Hello<br/>
<br/>
I have a 4 year old who really enjoys computer games. I try to find different websites (French or English) to offer her various styles and approaches, although our favourite website at the moment is bbc.co.uk and cbeebies, in particular with the games and stories from bbc school.<br/>
<br/>
Have you got any &quot;favourite&quot; website to suggest that we could try ? <br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>
Catherine<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752333326">I was looking for the link for UpToTen, which is in French and English, and <br/>
has two characters, Boowa and Kwala.   Found it.   But found it on a page FULL <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358677978">I don&#39;t have a link, but one of Dan&#39;s favorite sites (he&#39;s 4) is Boowa & Kwala -- it&#39;s available in French, Spanish, or English.  I think it&#39;s Canadian.  If you google Boowa Kwala, you&#39;ll get a hit for the site.<br/>
