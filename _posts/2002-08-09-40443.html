OK Bob,<br/>
<br/>
How many people do you figure Christianity has killed?  We&#39;ve got the<br/>
Crusades, Spanish Inquisition, Converting of Celts, Native Americans,<br/>
Africans, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Before you start jumping on people for being ignorant, please be able to<br/>
provide numbers.<br/>

witch burnings combined range from the 100,000&#39;s to 3,000,000. There has been <br/>
misreading of a horrible book published by an anti-Catholic publishing house <br/>
(Zondervan) that suggests 68,000,000. LOL! The misinterpretation is based on <br/>
the wording of the book (I don&#39;t remember the name) in which it slyly bags <br/>
everything from murder to offending people all in one grand category.<br/>
<br/>
I am not comparing apples and oranges, and as I said in my original reply, <br/>
one murder in the name of Christ is one too many. But I know of no valid <br/>
research which suggests that murder in the name of Christ (that is by <br/>
Christian governments or authorities -- not nominal Christian governments, <br/>
which Germany could have claimed to have been during W.W.II) ever reached the <br/>
amount suggested in that post. I have never found research that suggest it <br/>
ever even got up to the 10 millions.<br/>
