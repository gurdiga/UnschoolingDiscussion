<div id="ygrps-yiv-986430377">&lt;&lt; As the hospitals <br/>
and professionals took on &quot;home-like&quot; settings and twisted ideas into <br/>
their own, fewer home birth advocates were willing to &quot;fight the <br/>
fight&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Surely you&#39;re not saying it would have been better for home births for <br/>
hospitals to stay as stirrup-bound and drug-requiring as they wanted to be in <br/>
1959!!<br/>
<br/>
If pitocin were mandatory, there might be more home births, but is that a <br/>
reason to scoff at the demands of MANY birth activists for them to STOP IT <br/>
with their pitocin and stirrups and 48-hour-limits after water broke, etc?<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re being criticized here for responding to people&#39;s complaints!?<br/>
<br/>
And similarly, if school was criticized for same-age segregation and subject <br/>
segregation, but now alternative mixed-age, unit- or theme-based classrooms <br/>
are being criticized, or alternatives that don&#39;t require the children to be <br/>
separated from their families all day every day are being snorted at, I <br/>
question whether some of those here are really concerned for the good of <br/>
others around them.<br/>
<br/>
Not all families can unschool.  Not all moms can homebirth safely or <br/>
confidently.  If the radicals can&#39;t help pull the middle ground further away <br/>
from the extreme conservative side, why be radicals?   To be cool and <br/>
different, or to change the course of the mainstream?<br/>

changed, whatever there motivation.  I&#39;m glad if schools have changed,<br/>
even in small ways, if it&#39;s made things better for kids.  The danger I<br/>
think is in believing, being made to believe, that since things are so<br/>
much better, everyone must be satisfied.  Midwives have faced increasing<br/>
regulations, because hospitals don&#39;t want it to be easy for people to<br/>
make home birth choices.   Policy makers decide most of the people are<br/>
happy with the various hospital choices, and so why do women need to have<br/>
the choice to have their children at home?   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad parents who won&#39;t or can&#39;t homeschool are finding choices that<br/>
work for their kids.  I&#39;m just worried about what happens when  it is<br/>
decided these programs meet everyone&#39;s needs, and other options are taken<br/>
away.  Am I the only one who thinks this can really happen?  Every year<br/>
the school officials are trying to sneak more forms and requirements into<br/>
homeschooling.  I&#39;m usually not a pessimistic person, but as I watch the<br/>
homeschoolers leave for ps programs,  I wonder how many will be left to<br/>
stand in support of homeschooling freedoms when they are challenged<br/>
further.<br/>
<br/>
No one&#39;s snorting at anyone.  I don&#39;t see this group as just concerned<br/>
for themselves regarding anything.  I want things to be good for your<br/>
kids as much as I want them to be good for mine.  After all, our kids<br/>
will share this world.  Because some of us have worries doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>
aren&#39;t concerned for the good of others around us.  It simply means we<br/>
have worries.  These are nice people here.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll stop whining now.<br/>

That is the way of the bureaucratic world.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best way for us to stay a step ahead of the inevitable <br/>
regulations is to document some of what unschoolers are doing--even if in the <br/>
way of journals and testimonials--and by having grown unschoolers who will be <br/>
able to say, &quot;Hey--it&#39;s NOT necessary to read by seven and memorize times <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heavens no! You make some excellent points, Sandra! Good to see you <br/>
here too!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not saying that the changes weren&#39;t welcome. And I <br/>
agree, that home birth and home education are not for everyone.. <br/>
simply a choice on the plate. But I don&#39;t think hospitals changed <br/>
because of women who enjoyed their birthing experiences. I think the <br/>
home birth &quot;radicals&quot; &lt;g&gt; and the natural birth advocates threatened <br/>
the financial end to where changes were made to bring folks happily <br/>
back to the institution. As the sides draw closer together, less <br/>
passion is inflamed, less &#39;fighting spirit&#39;, if you will. I wonder <br/>
about the women who would have chosen home birth, and fully realized <br/>
the female power and beauty in birth had the institutional route been <br/>
uglier and more offensive to their sensibilities. But with its &quot;not <br/>
so bad&quot; ease of doing what everyone does, and nothing offensive to <br/>
raise one&#39;s ire, the advocate list shrinks and contracts. I&#39;m not <br/>
saying that is a bad thing. Except perhaps for those on the fence.<br/>
<br/>
I think you can educate people about their choices all you want but <br/>
very few will really take the road less traveled unless the opposing <br/>
choice is just plain offensive. I don&#39;t think I really understood how <br/>
offensive I felt schools (and schooling) were until long after I had <br/>
been in the home ed community. Most folks just go with the flow, <br/>
choose the least troublesome route. Why struggle for money when the <br/>
schools can give me some; why worry about an outline or a curriculum <br/>
when the state can provide one; why go to the trouble of sifting <br/>
through books and library shelves when someone else can tell me what <br/>
to do. In part, for me, because the struggle is part of the living <br/>
and the learning. But it is also about social politics and changing <br/>
the root, not the symptom.<br/>
<br/>
For analysis purposes only &lt;not really wanting to start an animal <br/>
rights discussion&gt;:<br/>
Zoos are certainly a far cry from what animal activists fought when <br/>
animals were obviously abused. During the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, many common <br/>
everyday Janes and Joes felt sorry for animals in zoos and felt <br/>
something should be done. Today, most people are not offended by <br/>
zoos, in fact, most feel that they serve a valuable place in our <br/>
world. And the elephant in the zoo is fed well, cared for with the <br/>
best medicine, and can expect a life longer than his wild <br/>
conterparts... but is he free? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really not sure of all the answers here. I&#39;m still working on <br/>
this in my own head as well as thinking out loud here. I know there&#39;s <br/>
something that doesn&#39;t feel right about the pull towards less freedom <br/>
and I know there are fewer voices as the choices become less <br/>
offensive. Beyond that, I&#39;m still listening and learning, not carving <br/>
my place in stone.<br/>
<br/>
in peace,<br/>

as well. IMO the missing link in ps or structured hs and in hospital births <br/>
is very similar. Not believing in the natural processes of life/of being a <br/>
human.  A lot of the peripherals of hospital births have improved <br/>
drastically, but at the core, they still manage the birth process...and <br/>
usually do more harmful interventions that helpful. And I think the <br/>
peripherals of ps/hs have improved, I&#39;ve not been in this long enough to even <br/>
speculate why, but at the root, the natural desire of children to learn is <br/>
given little to no credit. It is managed, and again through <br/>
unwanted/unsolicited/sometimes violently rebelled against intervention, often <br/>
damaged.<br/>

barely warrant a strong reaction, or at least so it seems. But all too often <br/>
today, I walk away from things feeling not quite right. It looks better, it&#39;s <br/>
meeting higher standards, but underneath the political correctness and pr, <br/>
there&#39;s still something not right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453570686">(The following is long and only marginally about homeschooling, in a <br/>
philosophical way.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  That birth was when I was really thankful for all the changes that have <br/>
been pushed through by <br/>
birthing advocates.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was pregnant with Marty, I totally planned a home VBAC with backup <br/>
plans, but I kept going to appointments with my HMO, letting them assume I <br/>
was coming in, stretching their limits, educating them as to why I was <br/>
refusing this or that, and what the legalities were, and making sure they had <br/>
refusal forms, giving them current research to read, and generally being a <br/>
pain.  When insurance-change time came where my husband works, I dropped that <br/>
HMO in favor of the university hospital, which is the neo-natal-problem <br/>
headquarters for the whole state.  I figured if there were problems, I&#39;d be <br/>
better off at UNMH than Lovelace.<br/>
<br/>
I had had a bad session with the head of pediatrics one day, and so I <br/>
dramatically said I didn&#39;t think I could deal with them, and it was MY birth, <br/>
not theirs (etc., again, knowing I wasn&#39;t going there anyway--I was just <br/>
there as part of my dedication to helping other moms not be totally <br/>
buffaloed).  <br/>
<br/>
Before the insurance switch had gone through, I got a call from one of the <br/>
administrator nurses at the HMO asking me whether I was dissatisfied.  I said <br/>
I was, and I wouldn&#39;t be coming back.  She pressed for me to tell her which <br/>
doctor I was going to.  I was seeing the same midwife I&#39;d been seeing the <br/>
whole pregnancy, but I didn&#39;t tell her that.  I said I was taken care of and <br/>
they didn&#39;t need to worry.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if they were afraid I would sue or what, but she said they would <br/>
consider paying the other doctor.  I asked skeptically why they would <br/>
consider doing that, since they had plenty of doctors and that wasn &#39;t how <br/>
the plan worked.  She was soothing, and I think she was willing to say <br/>
anything to find out where I was going and what I was up to.<br/>
<br/>
I had seen the midwives at the university hospital already and told them my <br/>
plan, that I would just come in in case of emergency, and I let them check me <br/>
out (at about 7 months) so I&#39;d have a record on file there, to save some time <br/>
in case.<br/>
<br/>
They said that to qualify for a VBAC there, I would have to have been in <br/>
their VBAC program since three or four months (I forget what now), and so if <br/>
I came in it would be a cesarean.  I said fine, because if it doesn&#39;t need a <br/>
cesarean, I&#39;m not coming in.<br/>
<br/>
At that point I had gathered more information for the use of other moms in <br/>
town who were coming to the Ceasarean Prevention Movement.  (I&#39;m going to <br/>
give up now on spelling that consistently, since the rest of the world has <br/>
given up, and that&#39;s not what this story&#39;s about.)<br/>
<br/>
Time came, labored for 35 hours or so, midwife, and EMT homebirthing mom,  <br/>
and other friends took shifts.  It wasn&#39;t happening.   I went in.  Told them <br/>
the details, gave them the chart of the past two days.  We had tried to break <br/>
the water and it didn&#39;t break, but the labor was at the point where the <br/>
contractions were involuntary, there was just no progress for many hours.<br/>
<br/>
They said &quot;OH!  We&#39;ll just break that water and the baby will slide right on <br/>
out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told them their policies prevented VBAC for me.  (Mostly I knew of a <br/>
then-24 hour policy on how long to labor after the water breaks and I didn&#39;t <br/>
want to labor for another 24 hours; Kirby had been a cesarean after I was at <br/>
10cm, and it was happening again.)<br/>
They said they could waive that policy, no problem.<br/>
<br/>
So...  Three more hours of labor (stirrup table, me saying &quot;cut me&quot;) and the <br/>
story gets really boring.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...  <br/>
My sister heard I&#39;d gone in and had the baby.  She called from our home town, <br/>
but she called my HMO, Lovelace.  This is 7:00 a.m. when Marty was 4 hours <br/>
old.  She asked if I was there.  They said &quot;She&#39;s at UNMH.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had carefully told NOBODY at Lovelace, but they found out anyway.  I&#39;ve <br/>
always thought that fascinating. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s the sad story of someone who never even had a homebirth OR a vaginal <br/>
birth, still managing to help other moms have them.  And there are <br/>
marginal-to-homeschooling situations in which the questions and insistence <br/>
and complaints of those who are not purely natural unschoolers which will <br/>
still change the schools for the better.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think schools should be dismantled.  I think they should adapt and be <br/>
more open.  I believe unschoolers will eventually make much more difference <br/>
in the practices and beliefs of educators than all the structured <br/>
homeschoolers put together.  Their structure-results, if good, will only <br/>
serve to make schools want more money for lower student-teacher ratios <br/>
without changing their methods.  <br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t change it all at once, but I&#39;d rather have a small, real effect <br/>
which made someone else&#39;s life better than to stand and rant and have no <br/>
effect except to have the establishment point at us and say &quot;See?  Nuts.  <br/>
Ignore them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not glorious or photographable to be a part of social erosion.  I&#39;m not <br/>
usually a very patient person, and sanding wood or polishing metal gets old <br/>
fast for me, but with social engineering I have more patience.<br/>
