&gt; their own accord) of not doing them.  One was to not be able to use the<br/>

choose&quot; their own punishment.  But it&#39;s NOT a consequence. A consequence of <br/>
not washing the dishes is no clean dishes for the next meal (or eating at a <br/>
restaurant! &lt;G&gt;) No computer time is a punishment---whether self-inflicted or <br/>
imposed by the parent.<br/>
<br/>
What many of us are saying is that, if allowed to THINK about the situation <br/>
and be a part of the solution---as opposed to being given orders and <br/>
accepting punishments, children will gladly and joyfully be your partners.<br/>
<br/>
As for the bike-riding. You&#39;ve just given us excuses WHY you can&#39;t be the <br/>
first one at the stop sign. There&#39;s an underlying problem that has NOTHING to <br/>
do with biking. If your child won&#39;t stop at the sign, it&#39;s NOT because he has <br/>
a bike---there&#39;s something deeper there. Your getting angry and taking away <br/>
his bike doesn&#39;t TEACH him that he must stop at the stop sign. What he&#39;s <br/>
LEARNED is that you&#39;re controlling him and enjoying the taunts he receives <br/>
from his friends. Put yourself in HIS shoes. He&#39;s seven; you&#39;re the adult. <br/>
How would YOU feel? Might you stop next time? Maybe (maybe not), but what <br/>
have you learned? Compassion? Understanding? Reason?<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s seven.<br/>
<br/>
YOU said you were a bad mother. Not a ONE of us wrote that---don&#39;t put words <br/>
on our fingertips.<br/>
