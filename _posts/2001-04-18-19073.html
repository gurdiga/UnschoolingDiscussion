Maybe if children are allowed to have fun while they&#39;re children<br/>
they&#39;ll know how to have fun when they&#39;re adults.</div>

I had this with dd2, when ultrasounds were being otuted as a <br/>
cause of dyslexia...  I had this high level of IgA in my bloodsteram <br/>
(maybe I was too happy?!) and they didn&#39;t know what to do about <br/>
it, the doc wanted to do an ultrasound to check for foetal oedema, <br/>
ie signs that my body was rejecting the baby.  Did he tell me this?  <br/>
Noooo...  He said &#39;I&#39;ve booked a scan.&#39;  I said &#39;What for?&#39;  He <br/>
said &#39;to make sure the baby&#39;s OK.&#39;  Imagine my dismay...  I said <br/>
&#39;yes, but what are you looking for?&#39;  He said &#39;Foetal oedema&#39;  <br/>
That was it.  not what it was a sign for or why theyw ere looking <br/>
for it or anything, it wasn&#39;t until I spoke to the midwife later that I <br/>
found out what they were looking for...  UGH!!!  The guy had <br/>
such a patronising attitude, &#39;don&#39;t worry your little head about it, us <br/>
doctors will sort it all out...&#39;  and they didn&#39;t they were clueless <br/>
and wouldn&#39;t put their arses on the line to tell what the real issues <br/>
were.  I stayed home.<br/>
