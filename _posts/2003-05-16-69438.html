<div id="ygrps-yiv-640275033">Hi people<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d post a &quot;What Our Day Was Like&quot; post, only it&#39;ll <br/>
cover a few days. How&#39;s that?<br/>
<br/>
We have about a dozen batches of glop around the place. That gooey <br/>
stuff recipe is SO simple, and really easy to clean up after, that <br/>
the kids have used up pretty much all the glue in the house, making <br/>
different colors of glop. Purple, that Katie and a friend made and <br/>
divvied up; reddish brown so it looked like guts; brownish green so <br/>
it looked like stomach fluid (according to Robby, who made those <br/>
batches); teal that Abbie made, and a batch of black to look like <br/>
tar. <br/>
<br/>
Katie has been very busy with a daily &quot;shop&quot; out front: lemonade and <br/>
cookies so far, but we&#39;ll bake a batch of bagels for her to offer the <br/>
public ;) She designed a sign for it on the computer, and then <br/>
executed her plan on a big piece of plywood, and has that propped <br/>
against the legs. She sold a bunch of lemonade to the migrant workers <br/>
across the road, on her first day, and a farmer advised us not to try <br/>
and retire on the proceeds from her shop! L &quot;Don&#39;t quit yer day job!&quot; <br/>
She made $1.60 that day, and today nothing, though not for lack of <br/>
effort. That&#39;s been keeping her busy for a few days. <br/>
<br/>
On Wednesday afternoon, she and a friend went up in the treehouse and <br/>
painted, and they&#39;re heading up there again right now to do some <br/>
more. On Weds, my hubby also hung hummingbird feeders and I made a <br/>
decision about sugar water instead of honey water :( but honey is SO <br/>
expensive. $20 a gallon, and that&#39;s before prices started soaring.<br/>
<br/>
Weds night and all day Thursday, I went to SLC with a girlfriend who <br/>
makes glass beads, to a wholesale show/shopping expo. She wanted <br/>
company for the drive down, and I wanted a chance to see my <br/>
grandbaby, so we did that. Wonderful, beautiful Aidan the Perfect! <br/>
<br/>
Oh, I bought a strand of round stone beads, of various stones at the <br/>
bead show. Lots of potential, in all those different types of beads. <br/>
Earrings, possibly a simple necklace.<br/>
<br/>
Got home really late on Thursday night, and spent the morning <br/>
reading. Kids slept in, from waiting up for me. And Robby has been <br/>
gone all day on an odd job with his dad, while the girls and I have <br/>
been home. Abbie&#39;s re-reading Harry Potter IV and I&#39;m reading some <br/>
Modern Fiction (which I haven&#39;t done in AGES: read for pleasure? not <br/>
in a LONG time). <br/>
<br/>
Today, while Abbie was at Drama, Katie and I played in the park. You <br/>
know, this group has been good for me, because I&#39;m seeing &quot;say yes to <br/>
your kids&quot;   &quot;spend time with your kids&quot;   &quot;be there beside your kids <br/>
working and playing and talking&quot;   I am reading a pretty good novel <br/>
(Sea Glass by Anita Shreve) and would have been content to sit and <br/>
read while Katie played. And, while the school group of little kids <br/>
was there, that&#39;s what I did. But then the school group left, and I <br/>
listened to the Unschooling Yahoo Group in My Head. Got up and slid <br/>
down the slide with her! It&#39;s a very fast, spiral slide, and we did a <br/>
train SO FAST that we ended up in a pile on the ground. Then we found <br/>
a plastic dome thingy (like, for a fast food salad or something?) and <br/>
dug down to find the moist sand, and built mountains. If you put dry <br/>
sand in the middle of a packed moist sand mountain, you get a cave! <br/>
and a cave in...<br/>
<br/>
That sand felt so good on my hands. Cool and heavy. I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
done that if You All weren&#39;t there telling me &quot;Play with your kids!&quot; <br/>
Thanks for doing that!<br/>
<br/>
peace, HeidiC</div>
