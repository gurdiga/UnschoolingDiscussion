<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631394322">How important is it to you that you know your children&#39;s (in our case, teens) friends?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been living out the values we&#39;ve learned on this loop over the last year, trusting our <br/>
kids to develop friendships, driving them places when they need it and so on. Our kids <br/>
have been great and I have no complaints about how they&#39;ve handled themselves. It was a <br/>
huge adjustment for us, but we&#39;ve made it. And I&#39;m happy with how things have gone.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, new situations arise that force me to rethink my attitudes again.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m faced with a developing friendship between our 14 yog and an 18 yob. So <br/>
far, they aren&#39;t romantically involved. They go to the mall or afternoon movies together <br/>
and spend a lot of time on IM. They&#39;ve gone to a concert too with my older son and <br/>
another boy so there were four of them together.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met the boy but haven&#39;t actually chatted with him. He&#39;s never come to our house, but <br/>
my daughter has good judgment and he seems to be a decent person.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend, my dd wants to go to his house for the afternoon. I asked her to invite him <br/>
here so we could get to know him a bit before she&#39;s spending time alone with him at his <br/>
house. She said that our big family makes her feel embarrassed when friends come (the <br/>
youngers can be very inquisitive). I promised her to keep them out of her way (we have <br/>
activities that day that would help the focus not be on her new friend).<br/>
<br/>
Still, she resisted. She likes keeping her friends separate from family.<br/>
<br/>
So I feel a dilemma. I&#39;m not that comfortable with their being alone in his house.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that my husband won&#39;t be keen on sending her to a boy&#39;s house when we don&#39;t <br/>
actually know the boy (we really just know about him).<br/>
<br/>
Any advice for how to handle this would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s rough.<br/>
<br/>
What about another plan?  You do something with her and the boy outside and <br/>
away from the younger kids?   <br/>
<br/>
But it seems somewhat suspicious to me if she&#39;s embarrassed to have him at <br/>
home.  If she&#39;s being different with him than at home, that might be an <br/>
indicator.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any advice for how to handle this would be greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you know his parents?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in true negotiator style you could tell her that before she visits his <br/>
house, maybe he AND HIS PARENTS should come over that day.  Maybe his whole <br/>
family.  That will seem way huge to her and she could say &quot;no, too much,&quot; and <br/>
you could say &quot;Okay, how about just him?&quot;  And maybe her relief at not having to <br/>
have his whole family over will make it seem small.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Jewish story about the house that&#39;s too small, and the rabbi advises <br/>
bringing the chicken in.  Next week &quot;My wife&#39;s complaining that the house is <br/>
too crowded.&quot;  &quot;Bring in the goat.&quot;  Etc. for a few weeks until &quot;My wife is <br/>
furious now because she can&#39;t even turn around.&quot;  &quot;Okay, take all the animals <br/>
out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then the house seemed plenty big!!<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Any advice for how to handle this would be greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really believe this one has to be a decision that is comfortable for you<br/>
and one that doesn&#39;t put a wedge between you and your daughter. It really<br/>
depends on how much you trust your daughter. And not just to say no to bad<br/>
decisions, but to think her way out of any problems and situations that may<br/>
arise. (no pun intended)<br/>
<br/>
I mean, you can tell her you are uncomfortable with her going over to an<br/>
empty house with this boy. When situations came up concerning my teen<br/>
daughter, I would talk to her about my insecurities and questions which<br/>
usually led to her making me feel better, just by listening to her, voicing<br/>
my concerns and having her talk them out with me. Have you spoken to your<br/>
daugher at all about how you feel and why? That could possibly have her<br/>
understand and maybe compromise on you meeting the friend.<br/>
<br/>
If she goes, what are you afraid of? Guns, drugs, sex, violence? How do you<br/>
feel about what she would do if any of these things were around and<br/>
presented to her? You seem pretty confident in her making good choices for<br/>
herself. If you don&#39;t allow her to go, she can easily become involved in<br/>
such matters by saying she&#39;s going to the movies and then going elsewhere.<br/>
&quot;Where there&#39;s a will there&#39;s a way&quot; is very true.<br/>
<br/>
I have found in my personal experience, the times I have allowed my daughter<br/>
freedoms I was wondering about turned out very well. It was when I had a<br/>
hold on her that she found things to get into that weren&#39;t the best choices<br/>
for her. And even at that, my daughter has learned from those mistakes and<br/>
is the kind of person that has to find out for herself anyway. I just think<br/>
I would have saved us a lot of trouble and helped the trust we have together<br/>
now if I would have eased up with her sooner than I did.<br/>
<br/>
But again I think it depends on the child and on how the parents feel about<br/>
the situation in general.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my daughter&#39;s friends parents refuse to let their kids have friends<br/>
over the house to hang out. My daughter&#39;s newest date is amazed that she can<br/>
bring him here after she gets off work at 11-11:30. He doesn&#39;t have a car<br/>
now so she often takes him home at 3, 4 or even 5 in the morning if they<br/>
have fallen asleep watching a movie. Now he&#39;s allowed to stay out that late,<br/>
just not with friends at his house. Where could a teenager go if they like<br/>
to stay up late and not be allowed home with friends? You can only hang at<br/>
the beach for so long. My daughter doesn&#39;t get parents who freak when their<br/>
kids run into trouble out and about yet they aren&#39;t allowed to hang out at<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
So my house is always open to her friends no matter what time it is. And<br/>
they are actually here more than they are out and about. And by her feeling<br/>
very comfortable to bring them here, she is here with them often and I do<br/>
know the kids pretty well. Her newest date I didn&#39;t know well at all. After<br/>
a few times of them going out, she brought him here. They rented a movie and<br/>
brought fast food in and hung out all night. I went in her room and had a<br/>
chance to talk to him about a lot of things for about 20 minutes or so. Made<br/>
me feel good she&#39;s hanging out with a nice kid. And if she wouldn&#39;t feel<br/>
comfortable here or I wouldn&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; her here with friends, I would never<br/>
know that.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, she also knows that my converstaion never turns to<br/>
grilling her friends. And she knows I will keep a check on my husband so he<br/>
doesn&#39;t pull any embarrassing behavior by scaring the crap out of the poor<br/>
kid. He can be intimidating and not really mean to be. So we made<br/>
compromises too. And we all understand that. And when situations come up<br/>
that I&#39;m not sure about, I come right out and talk to my daughter about<br/>
that. We are always able to figure something out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372346045">Wow, I don&#39;t blame you for being worried. Even if both of them are nice <br/>
people it would be very tempting for something to happen if they are possibly <br/>
romantic and alone. I would talk to her and say exactly that. Maybe she isn&#39;t <br/>
really interested and she doesn&#39;t realize that he is. What does she do if he tries <br/>
something and takes her by surprise? Is she ready for that? 14 is so young. I <br/>
think it is a very difficult situation she is putting herself in. Maybe it is <br/>
her way of wanting you to stop her by telling you she is doing this. Maybe she <br/>
is at least looking for guidance even though she acts like you are just <br/>
annoying her. <br/>
       I would strongly discourage it. You know your daughter. Some kids <br/>
would still do it and keep it a secret. If that happens, at least she&#39;ll have <br/>
heard your advice and hopefully you don&#39;t have a pregnant 14 year old. I snuck <br/>
around when I was 19 or 20 but 14 sounds so young. Even though I was alone with <br/>
my boyfriend when I wasn&#39;t supposed to be, I still remembered what my parents <br/>
told me and knew they were right. <br/>
  Good luck. My oldest is just 9 and those days will be coming for me soon. <br/>
It is really scary to me because even if you do everything right (and I know I <br/>
don&#39;t) there is still that big world out there that can pull them away from <br/>
you and you just pray they survive. <br/>
Hang in there.   Teresa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951587357">&lt;&lt;She likes keeping her friends separate from family.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is she the oldest?  I think this is fairly normal.  My oldest is 13 and<br/>
hates for her friends to come to the house because the little guys (4 of<br/>
them) can be somewhat intrusive.....ok really intrusive.<br/>
<br/>
Will she listen if you talk about you being uncomfortable because you don&#39;t<br/>
know him?  That you understand that she really likes this boy and that you<br/>
would be much more comfortable with them being alone together if you had the<br/>
opportunity to like him too.<br/>
<br/>
I think the idea of spending time away from the little guys is a good idea.<br/>
Perhaps offer to buy her and the boy lunch, or a bowling game, or<br/>
something.....<br/>

<br/>
One of the things I&#39;ve always loved about homeschooling is the way I always <br/>
know my kids&#39; friends.  They really tend to flock to our house and sometimes <br/>
seem to be as much *my* friends as my children&#39;s.  But as Em&#39;s gotten older <br/>
there have been some conflicts w/the little ones being annoying and definitely <br/>
over inquisitive, lol!  Emily is 15 and most of her friends are over 18.  I give <br/>
Emily the same freedom I would give another adult living in my household...but <br/>
this is because I *know* her.  We don&#39;t keep secrets from each other.  I <br/>
trust Em to make good judgments about being alone with people and putting herself <br/>
into difficult situations.<br/>
<br/>
I think the focus should be on your dd and not the guy.  Do you trust her to <br/>
make good judgments about boys?  I would be upfront and honest with her about <br/>
your concerns.  Tell her exactly what you are worried could happen and see how <br/>
she responds.  Are you worried about *date rape*?  Or are you worried about <br/>
your dd becoming sexually active at such a young age?  Or do you just think she <br/>
might be getting into a situation she can&#39;t handle?  Again, I would openly <br/>
discuss all your concerns with her and maybe discuss some ways she could handle <br/>
different situations.  If she still wanted to go I&#39;d let her &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel that mutual trust and the freedom that results is the foundation of my <br/>
relationship with my children.  I have received a lot of criticism about the <br/>
level of freedom I give my kids since Em was about 10.  Interestingly, the <br/>
same people who criticize *permissive* parenting are quick to say what wonderful <br/>
children I have.  They just seem to have a hard time seeing the connection.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733767407">Thanks for the good advice.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share what we came up with as I processed the various helps you all posted.<br/>
<br/>
My dd was able to let me in on why she didn&#39;t want this boy here a little more clearly. She <br/>
was afraid that it would appear to him that we thought of him as her boyfriend when he is <br/>
really just a friend. I could totally understand this.<br/>
<br/>
I explained that my dh and I felt better knowing him first before she spends days at his <br/>
house just like we know the rest of her friends. Then we&#39;ll have no problem with them <br/>
hanging out together there.<br/>
<br/>
She was okay with that but wondered how to handle the potential awkwardness of his <br/>
coming here. She solved her own problem. :) She invited another girlfriend to come too. <br/>
They are making an Internet forum all three together.<br/>
<br/>
And I promised to keep little ones occupied elsewhere to prevent their being an <br/>
embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
We do have a relationship that is built on trust. It&#39;s a reciprocal trust - I do trust her <br/>
judgment, but I also want her to trust me when I have a little red flag. We discussed this <br/>
and she agreed that was valid.<br/>
<br/>
The goal we have is for everyone to feel good about stuff, not just one side while the other <br/>
stifles their feelings. So I try to come without prejudgments but also to pay attention to my <br/>
gut.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the range of replies (not all identical) because that gave me more to think <br/>
through. So thanks!<br/>
<br/>
