<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359317432">........PLEASE do NOT include the other persons ENTIRE response when responding.  This list is SO busy right now, and I have a hard enough time reading everything.  So, can we make a concerted effort when replying to include ONLY the part you are referring too and not 3 or 4 posts worth.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note - Sandra is not evil.  Sandra has the ability to tweak my nerves, but she always gets me thinking.  And for that, I am grateful.  If it weren&#39;t for Sandra getting my &quot;hairs&quot; up, I wouldn&#39;t be the unschooler I am today.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda - you get me thinking as well.  Sometimes I think you believe we are all imbeciles here so you have to beat the snot out of us to get your point across - but it is not the case.  I truly believe you feel so passionately about the topics you &quot;jump&quot; on.  In the future, write a response, and reread it about 20 times before you hit send.  We aren&#39;t stupid, we are human.  If I knew you IRL I could probably figure out what was an attack, and what wasn&#39;t - most of us aren&#39;t privvy to that so that is why folks feel you go for the jugular.  Write a passionate post, but make sure it isn&#39;t towards a person please.<br/>
<br/>
YMMV,<br/>
