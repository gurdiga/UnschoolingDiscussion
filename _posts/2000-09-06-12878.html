&lt;&lt; Well, they should take pictures of the kidlets when we &quot;un&quot; school shop. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, ooh -- this reminds me of my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
We were in the supermarket the other day.  She saw a turkey baster and just <br/>
HAD to have it!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For a science experiment, Mom.&quot;  She&#39;s 5 1/2 so pretty much the whole world <br/>
is a science experiment.<br/>
<br/>
But that was a pretty good $1.89 to spend.  She has since used it for several <br/>
&quot;projects&quot; and had great fun!<br/>

My daughters love their turkey baster, too. But my 8 yo says it&#39;s for her<br/>
&quot;Science experiments gone terribly wrong&quot;  (using very dramatic voice).<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if the leftover liquid should be considered hazardous<br/>
waste.<br/>
