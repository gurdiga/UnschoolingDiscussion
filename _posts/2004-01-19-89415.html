<br/>
Well, speaking as a real witch---ie, a practicing Neo-Pagan--very little of<br/>
what kids see on TV has any relation to my religion.  Admittedly, Willow is<br/>
the closest.  Well, maybe Tara was, really.  But still--what they see is<br/>
pretend.  What they do from what they see is pretend.<br/>
<br/>
I like that others pointed out it&#39;s just another kind of fantasy play.  Just<br/>
like being a superhero.  That&#39;s all Charmed is.  A set of superheroes using<br/>
the &quot;witch&quot; archetype.<br/>
<br/>
And there is a lot to admire about all these women, not the least of which<br/>
is their strength of personality.  And their willingness to help others and<br/>
their willingness to work hard at their craft.  All valuable traits.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t mind answering--what would you do, feel, think if one of your<br/>
kids came to you and said they felt the need to explore Wicca or another<br/>
Pagan (witchy) religion?  I&#39;m not trying to jump on you or anything.  I&#39;ve<br/>
had to consider that the other way around--what if my kids decided they<br/>
wanted to go to church or be Christian.<br/>

I also would do the same with ANY religion that I didn&#39;t feel was Bible<br/>

I&#39;m totally open to the idea that *I* might be wrong, so why should I get in<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very good question Kelly.  But for me personally, I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
even considered unschooling if it werent&#39; for my faith (which <br/>
happens to be christian).  My faith helps me trust in my children <br/>
and the belief that they have been created beautifully in God&#39;s <br/>
image and don&#39;t need any &quot;fixing&quot; or &quot;teaching&quot;  This is &#39;my&#39; faith <br/>
and &#39;my&#39; belief.  It is not an attack on anyone who doesn&#39;t share <br/>
this belief. But you did ask.  Maybe, the view of Christianity as <br/>
being harsh and all about the &quot;don&#39;ts&quot; is what contributes to the <br/>
misconception that a Christian can&#39;t unschool. I haven&#39;t had that <br/>
type of experience with Christianity and I am sorry for anyone who <br/>
has.<br/>
<br/>
There is no objectivity on this topic. There really can&#39;t be when it <br/>
comes to faith, whatever yours may be.  Anyone who is going to <br/>
bother commenting is obviously passionate about theirs or lack <br/>
thereof.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems a disclaimer has to be added to posts so that someone <br/>
doesn&#39;t take it the wrong way and run with it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894897796">I would be as supportive as I could.<br/>
<br/>
No I don&#39;t think I could  go to a wiccaning or a handfasting.   I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
love my children any less.  I can support them and still not belive the way<br/>
they chose.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind you asking the questions at all. I think it really helps us to<br/>
learn ourselves when asked tough questions.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I don&#39;t come across as &quot;condemning&quot; or &#39;holier than though&#39; either.<br/>
<br/>
I do love learning of other religions and have found this discussion very<br/>
enlightening. <br/>
<br/>
There are different kinds of &#39;Christians&#39; just as there are different kinds<br/>
of &#39;parenting&#39;  ( I currently am not unschooling full time.. I am making a<br/>
slow transition because my 8 year old doesn&#39;t take to sudden change well.. I<br/>
guess in a way I am sneaking it in on him)<br/>

fundamental friends about these issues, and doing a<br/>
LOT of thinking and praying about it so we are at<br/>
peace with our decisions that seem to run counter to<br/>
some of the words coming from the pulpit in front of<br/>
us.  Knowing why we made these decisions and how helps<br/>
tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
By doing a LOT of talking with our children about why<br/>
we are living the way we do, and showing them that it<br/>
is not contradictory to our faith to unschool, to use<br/>
gentle parenting, and to be vegetarian.<br/>
<br/>
The resources are out there to support our decisions,<br/>
but they are overwhelmed by the resources by the<br/>
majority sometimes.  But there are Christian<br/>
unschoolers, Christians who don&#39;t spank their<br/>
children, and Christians that are vegetarian.<br/>
<br/>
So why do we stay in our church?  Well, if we felt<br/>
that it was becoming an issue or that our children<br/>
were being made to feel like sinners for our choices,<br/>
we would not stay.  But right now it seems that while<br/>
we are viewed as quirky and permissive, we have not<br/>
been told that our choices are wrong and unbiblical,<br/>
which would be legalistic and we would be out the door<br/>
really fast!<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

I feel that I unschool religion.  I model my choice, and am open about it<br/>
and include my kids, but I don&#39;t in any way expect that it need be their<br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
I feel, though, that by it&#39;s very nature Christianity takes some of the<br/>
choice away.  What happens if you don&#39;t follow the rules is so severe as to<br/>
make choosing a different way unreasonable.  That&#39;s not true of all other<br/>
religions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then Kelly, may you consider the probability that one day you may not <br/>
need to use the word &quot;religion&quot; to describe what you practice much in <br/>
the same way we use stop using words like teaching*, schooling, even <br/>
education? When I use the word atheist, it is in the same vein as <br/>
unschooling : I am wiping out any possibility of churches and organized <br/>
religion. It does not mean though that I do not find &quot;the golden rule&quot; <br/>
worthy of using as a compass for living. Actually, I do. But do I use <br/>
it because I expect an outcome in &#39;another life&#39;? Absolutely not. Just <br/>
in the same way I do not expect from my children&#39;s learning anything <br/>
other than living. Theirs is a life to make on their own accord, not <br/>
for me to impose upon my prejudices or points of view. I actually find <br/>
the Tao Te Ching the most &#39;unschooling-friendly&#39; <br/>
spritual/practical/ethical of all texts and it is very much in accord <br/>
with the basic tenets of christianity (Thomas Merton would approve).  <br/>
But it is not a sacred text; it is not based on a religion or a church.<br/>
<br/>
I actually was a religion studies freak growing up. Loved to read up on <br/>
all the saints (Augustine, St Francis, St Theresa de Avila & Fray <br/>
Leon). Studied the last two, once again, during my Spanish Literature <br/>
graduate studies along with Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz and other <br/>
mystics. That&#39;s how I got to Joseph Campbell and Elaine Pagels <br/>
(looooove anything written by them) ... and I can&#39;t wait to read the <br/>
&#39;Da Vinci Code&#39; (it sounds like something Umberto Eco would have <br/>
written, aka &#39;The Name of the Rose&#39;). Like Campbell would say, they are <br/>
all stories, myths we need to live by.<br/>
<br/>
I am not religious but love stories of saints. I love christmas. The <br/>
nativity story and the flight to Egypt is one of the best suspense <br/>
stories ever written. I just have come to a point in my life that I am <br/>
not attached to the meaning of these stories. To me they are not <br/>
factual. Is non-attachment to those stories another myth? Maybe. Then <br/>
again, non-attachment is a practice, the story &quot;virgin birth&quot; on the <br/>
other hand is found across many cultures --just like the story of the <br/>
sacrificial lamb and the messiah.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just rambled at the moment ... back to unschooling religion. <br/>
I knew BIG changes where happening in my life when, after having Evan, <br/>
I was not quite sure I&#39;d dig the idea of baptism. I still had to ask <br/>
Mark how he felt about it and he strongly rejected the idea --actually <br/>
he was shocked I had asked, having known the kind of alternative <br/>
religious studies I had done for years. That was the beginning of the <br/>
end of my life as my mother&#39;s child. Of course, raising my kids &#39;sin <br/>
escuela&#39; (that&#39;s how you say unschooling in spanish), is the straw that <br/>
broke the camel&#39;s back.<br/>
<br/>
So in this household, our rejection of schooling and religion go hand <br/>
in hand with our wish to break with the cycle of pain and suffering <br/>
that plagues all of humanity. Do we know 100% what we&#39;re doing? No, not <br/>
really ---but that&#39;s why we are here :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to laugh.  Not at what you are saying but that it ended up getting<br/>
said to me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a witch.  A Neo-pagan.  I have no idea what comes in the next life, but<br/>
I tend to envision it as a Summerland--all is warm, wonderful and safe but<br/>
not a boring harp and clouds kind of thing.  Think a beautiful late spring<br/>
day with a big picnic with all your loved ones.<br/>
<br/>
But hell, who knows?  So for me &quot;religion&quot; or as I tend to call it &quot;my pagan<br/>
practice&quot; is all about getting along in this world.  How to make changes in<br/>
myself or my surroundings with the help and guidance of Goddesses who I am<br/>
called to.<br/>
<br/>
I practice alone--no church, no organization of others of my faith.  My own<br/>
practice is fairly &quot;unreligioning&quot; if you will.<br/>
<br/>
In short--I hear ya, sister.  And you have addressed one of my big issues<br/>
with many religions, Christianity in particular and why I asked some of<br/>
these questions in the first place.<br/>

level.  It&#39;s like &quot;I get it&quot; to the cosmic degree.<br/>

You&#39;ll laugh, but I sometimes use curses from the old TV show Battlestar<br/>
