<div id="ygrps-yiv-269827137">OK----Time for some PRO-unschooling talk! Even though it&#39;ll &quot;SEEM&quot; off-topic:<br/>
<br/>
MY SEVEN YEAR OLD CAN READ!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We were out all day with Leslie and her kids. We went to a unique zoo where <br/>
most of the animals are trained and used in TV, movies, and commercials. It was <br/>
a cool day. We got to see and feed some really neat and charming animals, and <br/>
Leslie and I got in some good chatting to and from Spartanburg while the kids <br/>
snoozed.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, after we dropped Leslie and her kids off, Duncan and I went to The <br/>
Happy Bookseller because he wanted a new &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; bookmark (it comes <br/>
with a ring you can wear!). While we were there, he asked whether he could get <br/>
a book. Always ready to spend $$$, I said &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We got four &quot;readers&quot;---two of SpongeBob SquarePants , one on spiders, and <br/>
one really simple &quot;reader&quot;. The SpongeBob ones were level two, and the others, <br/>
level one.<br/>
<br/>
We came home, and Duncan asked that we get in bed and read. I started, but he <br/>
said, &quot;No. Let me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;all, he READ the books! They weren&#39;t hard (except for the proper <br/>
names---Sandy, Squidward, Patrick, and SpongeBob (which I guess he &quot;knew&quot;))---but there <br/>
were words like: agreed, replied, cried, said, Halloween, ghost, witch, pearl, <br/>
quickly, scared, afraid, downward, outside, could, would, should.<br/>
<br/>
I was cracking up. It was funny---he would &quot;miss&quot; &quot;he&quot; and &quot;me&quot;, but he&#39;d <br/>
have no trouble with &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; (I asked how he knew that---he said <br/>
that it ended with &quot;man&quot;---like Batman and Spiderman.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been watching me read for years. He&#39;s been knowing when to say the words <br/>
in bold caps like &quot;BOOM&quot; or &quot;BANG&quot; or &quot;CRASH&quot; or proper names like Harry and <br/>
Hermione. <br/>
<br/>
Suddenly ALL the pieces fit! It&#39;s so cool! And we haven&#39;t read in WEEKS! Busy <br/>
with the conference, all summer in the pool, new video games, travelling here <br/>
and there. We take this long hiatus from reading.....and he can read!<br/>
<br/>
Had to share.<br/>
