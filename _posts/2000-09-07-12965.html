<div id="ygrps-yiv-170153810">Hi Nicole....<br/>
<br/>
With my own husband, what worked as far as convincing him to do &quot;radical&quot;<br/>
things (homebirth, unschool) was to make it appear so natural and ordinary<br/>
that he couldn&#39;t imagine anyone doing it another way. Now he&#39;s sure it was<br/>
his idea!<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck...Valerie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905975988">Hello.  I just subscribed to this email group after two days of <br/>
trying to get through our internet filter!!  I thought I would <br/>
introduce myself, then I&#39;m going to go back and read through past <br/>
posts to try and get to know you.<br/>
I am a mother of seven, ages 24yg,  22yg,  15yb,  13yb,  9yb,  7yb,  <br/>
4 next week yg.  I am the grandmother of 7, my oldest two are <br/>
married.  I have been married 27 years to my husband, Bill.  This is <br/>
our 11th year of homeschool.  We attend a Mennonite church.<br/>
I have tried unschooling for a couple of years, partly due to burn <br/>
out, but also because my 13 year old has such a hard time learning <br/>
through books, and I would lose my temper with him.  Finally, I told <br/>
him, &quot;I am no longer your teacher, I am now just your mother.&quot;  Not <br/>
really knowing what I meant by that as far as schooling.  So I <br/>
started to read everything I could about Unschooling.  I thought this <br/>
site might help!!<br/>
I am looking forward to what you have to teach me!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204823634">hello,<br/>
I just signed up for this list.  We have two young boys and this is<br/>
the <br/>
second year we are homeschooling the 6 year old.  Last year we were <br/>
pretty casual. Well for some reason this year I decided to buy a<br/>
boxed <br/>
curriculum. It is going OK.  He really likes the math and I am<br/>
letting <br/>
him go at his own rate.  But it is the reading that is bothering me.<br/>
He is learing to read OK, but it isn&#39;t his favorite.  He is reading<br/>
the <br/>
books that came with the curriculum until the present one.  He says<br/>
he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to read it. So then I said to myself, &quot;I don&#39;t want to <br/>
make him read a book he doesn&#39;t want to read&quot;.  But he isn&#39;t really <br/>
interested in reading other books on his own either.  We go to the <br/>
library a lot and he checks out books on subjects that he is<br/>
interested <br/>
in.  Like right now it is hockey.  But they are all adult books, he <br/>
just looks at the pictures.  Which I think is great, but he has no <br/>
interest in learning to read them.  The main problem is my husband,<br/>
he <br/>
wants me to teach him to read and write!  So has anyone been in my <br/>
situation?  Being more relaxed than your significant other?  I don&#39;t <br/>
want to force my son to read and turn him off of it.  I am just now <br/>
relearning to enjoy reading myself and I want to make sure my son<br/>
loves <br/>
to read.  But I also need to keep my husband satisfied.  If I tell <br/>
him,&quot; Oh he will pick it up in a few years, he will be OK&quot;.  He won&#39;t <br/>
like that.  Well Sorry to make this so long!</div>

 </span></blockquote>If your husband were telling you you needed to do something concerning<br/>
childbirth that you knew was wrong, would you try to appease him or help him<br/>
understand better?<br/>
<br/>
Insisting that your son read when he isn&#39;t interested and perhaps isn&#39;t<br/>
developmentally ready yet will send him the message that there&#39;s something<br/>
wrong with him. Schools cause most reading problems by insisting kids need<br/>
to learn to read by 4th grade. My daughter is 10 and though she can read<br/>
fine, is still not comfortable with dense text. How would she feel if she<br/>
were being forced to read?<br/>
<br/>
How much will your husband read? John Holt is a good suggestion. If he won&#39;t<br/>
read full books, try the Unschooling.com message boards. There are articles<br/>
available from the home page and a huge number of posts that you could email<br/>
him bit by bit. There&#39;s even a folder on the message board to discuss<br/>
reluctant spouses.<br/>
<br/>
As for writing, boys especially tend to be late physically writing. You can<br/>
encourage him by making sure paper and markers are easily accessible so he<br/>
can write when the muse strikes him. If he has a story to tell, you can<br/>
write it or type it for him as he dictates. Or he can tell it into a tape<br/>
recorder or put it on video tape. Then, if he&#39;s interested, you can go a<br/>
step further and print it out so he can illustrate it and then make it into<br/>
a book.<br/>

undesireable?  Does he just not enjoy reading?  Does he think it&#39;s more work <br/>
than the information gain is worth?  <br/>
<br/>
And maybe he will be able to see himself in the same glance he sees his son.<br/>
<br/>
Asking a child to do what a parent won&#39;t do is problematical all by itself.<br/>

I believe there&#39;s a line that you cross to unschool, and I don&#39;t <br/>
believe directing the area of learning that the parents consider <br/>
Too Difficult or Too Important to Leave to Chance can legitimately <br/>
be called Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t say, as these people are saying (and yes, I know them <br/>
too), &quot;I unschool except of course for this school thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could say, &quot;I&#39;m a man, except for these breasts and ovaries, and <br/>
of course my missing penis.&quot; Doesn&#39;t make it so.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t be a vegan who occasionally eats fish. You can&#39;t be a <br/>
vegetarian who has steaks on Sundays. You can&#39;t be a lesbian <br/>
who sometimes has sex with men.<br/>
<br/>
You CAN be a relaxed homeschooler who follows formal work <br/>
with math and follows the child&#39;s interest for everything else. You <br/>
can be an eclectic homeschooler.<br/>

based unit studies&quot; for a long time.  Then I was &quot;I unschool for <br/>
everything but Bible-based unit studies&quot;.  Then i was &quot;I unschool for <br/>
everything but Bible-based unit studies and we only do them once in <br/>
awhile&quot;.  I kept getting closer and closer to the line.  Then I <br/>
enrolled the kids in a cyber school thinking that I was unschooling <br/>
because the kids wanted to do it.  But when teachers gave assignments <br/>
and the kids didn&#39;t want to do them, I said, &quot;But you have to because <br/>
you signed up for this&quot;.  Then we quit the cyber school and began <br/>
totally unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I started panicking that my son needed to learn how to read.  <br/>
Actually, he told me that he wanted to learn how to read, which gave <br/>
me an excuse to start reading lessons.  He didn&#39;t like them and <br/>
decided he didn&#39;t want to learn how to read after all.  We quit the <br/>
reading lessons. I crossed that line again for about 2 days and made <br/>
him do his reading lessons for me &quot;because you told me you wanted <br/>
this and we&#39;re going to follow this through&quot;, but then I came back to <br/>
my senses and let it go.  Back over that unschooling line again. It&#39;s <br/>
a nice place to be and I don&#39;t want to go back. :)  (I&#39;m still not <br/>
sure how comfortable I&#39;ll be answering grandparent&#39;s questions in a <br/>
few years if he&#39;s not reading.)  <br/>
<br/>
I think that some very relaxed homeschoolers see that they&#39;re a lot <br/>
closer to that line than other relaxed homeschoolers and want to let <br/>
people know that.  So they call themselves &quot;unschoolers except for <br/>
_____&quot;  or &quot;a combination of unschooling and unit studies&quot;.  <br/>

&gt; Renee<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Renee,<br/>
Welcome to the list.<br/>
Since you don&#39;t have time to read a whole book in the middle of a move <br/>
(Yuck!) reading the message boards at unschooling.com will really give you <br/>
the most info. You can type in a topic to learn about, say &quot;math&quot; or just <br/>
pick a folder and start reading. ALL of your answers are probably there.<br/>
Here&#39;s my take on the difference of the above:<br/>
NOT Unschooling:<br/>
child likes trains - Mom: Dear child, please go read this book about trains <br/>
and we&#39;ll discuss it when your done. <br/>
Unschooling:<br/>
Child speaks enthusiastically: Mom. Mom. Mom. MOM!! Look! There&#39;s a train! <br/>
Wow! Can we go on a train ride? I wonder how that train goes? Does someone <br/>
drive it? Can *I* drive a train? Why don&#39;t we ever ride on the train? Where <br/>
is it going? Why does it have so many wheels? Next time we go to the library <br/>
can we get some train books?etc. etc.<br/>
Mom: buys a short ride ticket, brings child to library to look at pictures of <br/>
more trains, and reads the hard words for the child. Maybe mom finds some <br/>
train coloring pages on internet, sits down and puts together the Briotrain <br/>
set with child.<br/>
Mom and child have fun and learn together. And when the child learn enough, <br/>
when he knows all he WANTS to know, it&#39;s over. Mom doesn&#39;t continue <br/>
overloading with info. Sometimes the interest is one question and answer, <br/>
sometimes it is the above, and very occasionally, the child grows up to <br/>
become an engineer.<br/>
Not a unit study, Not mom&#39;s idea, but the child&#39;s idea and request for info.<br/>
In that interest, the &quot;basics&quot; will come.<br/>
In unschooling, Mom (or dad) is not the teacher, s/he is the facilitator. It <br/>
helped me to think about how I would treat anyone else, an adult, if they <br/>
expressed interest in something. Would I create a lesson plan that involved <br/>
reading math science and history? Or would I see a really cool book or video <br/>
and buy it as a gift, offering it to the person to Do With It As They Will? <br/>
Unschooling involves alot of trust. People are designed to learn about their <br/>
environment, their interests. So we trust them to use the tools available to <br/>
them (what schools call the basics) to learn about themselves and their <br/>
lives. They will learn to read because they need to use that tool to get <br/>
information from books. They will learn math because they need that tool to <br/>
make good decisions on how to spend their allowances or because they love <br/>
making brownies and want to make a double batch. And they learn How to use <br/>
those tools by watching otehrs use them. By seeing Mom & Dad pay the bills, <br/>
by listening to grownups read out loud.<br/>
Children left in a vacuum will learn nothing. Children in an environment <br/>
where there is joy in learning, where fun things are available to play with <br/>
(note: I dodn&#39;t say educational to learn from) where excitement about new <br/>
things infects everyone in the family, where Life is right there for them to <br/>
join and participate in Now rather than at 18, WILL learn. They will learn <br/>
that *learning* is fun and natural and joyful.<br/>
But it starts with Trust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298105862">IHere is the spell checked version!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi Renee,<br/>
&gt; Welcome to the list.<br/>
&gt; Since you don&#39;t have time to read a whole book in the middle of a move <br/>
&gt; (Yuck!) reading the message boards at unschooling.com will really give you <br/>
&gt; the most info. You can type in a topic to learn about, say &quot;math&quot; or just <br/>
&gt; pick a folder and start reading. ALL of your answers are probably there.<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my take on the difference of the above:<br/>
&gt; NOT Unschooling:<br/>
&gt; child likes trains - Mom: Dear child, please go read this book about trains <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and we&#39;ll discuss it when your done. <br/>
&gt; Unschooling:<br/>
&gt; Child speaks enthusiastically: Mom. Mom. Mom. MOM!! Look! There&#39;s a train! <br/>
&gt; Wow! Can we go on a train ride? I wonder how that train goes? Does someone <br/>
&gt; drive it? Can *I* drive a train? Why don&#39;t we ever ride on the train? Where <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; is it going? Why does it have so many wheels? Next time we go to the <br/>
&gt; library <br/>
&gt; can we get some train books? etc. etc.<br/>
&gt; Mom: buys a short ride ticket, brings child to library to look at pictures <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; more trains, and reads the hard words for the child. Maybe Mom finds some <br/>
&gt; train coloring pages on Internet, sits down and puts together the Brio <br/>
&gt; Train <br/>
&gt; set with child.<br/>
&gt; Mom and child have fun and learn together. And when the child learn enough, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; when he knows all he WANTS to know, it&#39;s over. Mom doesn&#39;t continue <br/>
&gt; overloading with info. Sometimes the interest is one question and answer, <br/>
&gt; sometimes it is the above, and very occasionally, the child grows up to <br/>
&gt; become an engineer.<br/>
&gt; Not a unit study, Not mom&#39;s idea, but the child&#39;s idea and request for <br/>
&gt; info.<br/>
&gt; In that interest, the &quot;basics&quot; will come.<br/>
&gt; In unschooling, Mom (or dad) is not the teacher, s/he is the facilitator. <br/>
&gt; It <br/>
&gt; helped me to think about how I would treat anyone else, an adult, if they <br/>
&gt; expressed interest in something. Would I create a lesson plan that involved <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; reading math science and history? Or would I see a really cool book or <br/>
&gt; video <br/>
&gt; and buy it as a gift, offering it to the person to Do With It As They Will? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling involves a lot of trust. People are designed to learn about <br/>
&gt; their <br/>
&gt; environment, their interests. So we trust them to use the tools available <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; them (what schools call the basics) to learn about themselves and their <br/>
&gt; lives. They will learn to read because they need to use that tool to get <br/>
&gt; information from books. They will learn math because they need that tool to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; make good decisions on how to spend their allowances or because they love <br/>
&gt; making brownies and want to make a double batch. And they learn How to use <br/>
&gt; those tools by watching others use them. By seeing Mom & Dad pay the bills, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; by listening to grownups read out loud.<br/>
&gt; Children left in a vacuum will learn nothing. Children in an environment <br/>
&gt; where there is joy in learning, where fun things are available to play with <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (note: I didn&#39;t say educational to learn from) where excitement about new <br/>
&gt; things infects everyone in the family, where Life is right there for them <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; join and participate in Now rather than at 18, WILL learn. They will learn <br/>
&gt; that *learning* is fun and natural and joyful.<br/>
&gt; But it starts with Trust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479673980">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Patricia Reszetylo, and I live with my husband and our 6-mo son in northern Minnesota.  I joined this list last night.  I had mentioned to a friend that I was planning on homeschooling and he suggested I look into unschooling.. so here I am.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we are already &quot;unschooling&quot; baby E., given the thread on sex that I read this morning.  Both hubby and I think that our culture is way too repressive when it comes to sex, and since we aren&#39;t embarrassed about our functioning, and baby finds it interesting, we don&#39;t necessarily reserve it for times that he is asleep or at Gramma&#39;s.  In many (other) cultures, parents do directly teach their children about sex, and watching is the first step.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t told my friends, because they would think I am perverted.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am very interested in the &quot;unschooling&quot; idea, it seems to fit in with MY mindset, so I will be reading and watching and learning how to allow my little guy to learn.<br/>

Hi Renee,<br/>
<br/>
You are about to engage in a wonderful journey and a major paradigm shift<br/>
(at least if you are one of the lucky ones).<br/>
<br/>
Let me see if I can explain:<br/>
<br/>
Adriane (11) wanted to raise dairy goats for 4-H.  Not to *Learn* any thing<br/>
in particular, just because she thought it would be fun.  So she is now a<br/>
dairy goat farmer and this is what she has been learning.  Just by hanging<br/>
out with her goats, she can now tell you the different breeds and some of<br/>
the history of the breeds.  She has to feed them a particular blend of food,<br/>
making sure there is enough protein, so she has a beginning understanding of<br/>
nutrition and nutritional sources.  She has to breed her goat every year.<br/>
(talk about your life sciences crash course as well as genetics).  She<br/>
understands about parasitic and symbiotic relationships between species due<br/>
to worming goats.  She milks her goat and keeps records (lots and lots of<br/>
math).  She sells her milk at cost to a family with a developmentally<br/>
disabled baby so she learns about citizenship.  We travel to goat shows all<br/>
over Texas.  Adriane can now read a map, has discovered that she really<br/>
likes Sue Grafton mysteries (we listen to them on tape in the pickup), knows<br/>
how to meet deadlines because paperwork has to be completed on time or you<br/>
are out.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t set out for Adriane to learn any of those things, just for her to<br/>
have fun.  But unschoolers believe that you can&#39;t keep kids from learning<br/>
even if you try.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I believe there&#39;s a line that you cross to unschool, and I don&#39;t <br/>
believe directing the area of learning that the parents consider <br/>
Too Difficult or Too Important to Leave to Chance can legitimately <br/>
be called Unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I feel that way too.  I think what those parents are intending to say is that <br/>
reading will open up all the other fields, and that math, once they get the <br/>
basics, will be easy.<br/>
<br/>
What they are REALLY saying, to themselves and others without knowing it, is <br/>
that they don&#39;t really think science and history and geography, music, etc., <br/>
are all that important at all.<br/>

Nicole,<br/>
  The point isn&#39;t that you should have goats and live on a farm in <br/>
order to unschool well.  The point is that whatever it is that your <br/>
kids want to do, you figure out a way to do it if at all possible.<br/>
     My daughter is upset about our town banning skateboards and <br/>
scooters, so we&#39;re into this huge civics project, walking the town <br/>
doing a survey (and we&#39;ll do a graph and figure a percentage of how <br/>
many residents are for/against) and getting signatures on a petition, <br/>
talking and writing to council members, etc.  If I wanted to divide <br/>
it into school subjects, I would say we have civics, language arts, <br/>
and math.  However, I&#39;m not doing this project because I want to <br/>
cover those subjects.  I&#39;m doing it because it&#39;s something that&#39;s <br/>
important to my daughter.  None of it requires us to leave our town. <br/>
   My boys are into trains.  We went (two hours) to Strasburg, PA to <br/>
ride on the real Thomas the tank engine.  We visited the railroad <br/>
museum of PA.  We&#39;re going on a santa train ride, we&#39;re visiting <br/>
three other train museums.  They have every Thomas toy you could <br/>
imagine.  We&#39;re touring an engine shed.  <br/>
    I can see where life in general would be harder without a car.  <br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t follow their interests.  Wait <br/>
until you see them really excited about something and go for it.  <br/>
You&#39;re right that a trip to the seashore would be better than a <br/>
book.  If they would really get into it, maybe you could find a way <br/>
to earn the money together so that you could take a bus trip?  Maybe <br/>
sell tupperware or baked goods or do a paper route together, and save <br/>
all your profits in a jar?  <br/>
    I can also relate to not having kids around with similar <br/>
interests to your kids.  My daughter really likes video games but <br/>
doesn&#39;t really have any friends who are into them.  She gets to play <br/>
video games with her dad, though, so it&#39;s special for them.  She <br/>
loves American Girl dolls too, but has found a few friends who are <br/>
into them and who do that stuff with her.  American Girls are popular <br/>
among girls in homeschool groups.  Do you have any homeschool groups <br/>
near you?  Where do you live?  <br/>
<br/>
Sheila<br/>
<br/>
maybe that&#39;s why unschooling would be harder for me.last night the <br/>
girls & i were putting sea salt on each others feet & inside the jar <br/>
was a seashell & they wanted to know all about them,so i said we&#39;d <br/>
got to the library to get books on them,but if i could go to a beach <br/>
& they could see seashells,i think they would learn much more than <br/>
from a book.they are also interested in little house on the prairie <br/>
but we are far away from missouri or any other landmarks.i think <br/>
seeing things in person would be much more educational & something <br/>
they would remember but all we can do is go to the library.my dream <br/>
would be to live on a small farm & my kids would help raise all the <br/>
animals & we&#39;d have a huge garden & also maybe make crafts to sell <br/>
but sadly it&#39;s only a dream.my girls are also interested in colonial <br/>
times & we&#39;d love to have a party &quot;american girl&quot; style but we don&#39;t <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276323516"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;i just thought maybe unschooling <br/>
&gt; was things like,oh there&#39;s a book & it&#39;s shaped like a rectangle instead of<br/>
&gt; just pulling out a math book to learn shapes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not. :) What you&#39;re describing is creating a curriculum out of everyday<br/>
materials instead of a textbook -- it&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is sometimes pointing out things that might be useful or<br/>
interesting to your particular child at a given time. If he draws a square<br/>
and you say, &quot;Great square! I love how you mixed red with purple&quot; and he<br/>
says &quot;What&#39;s a square?&quot; you would tell him and if he seemed interested could<br/>
point to a rectangular box of crackers and tell him what that shape is, and<br/>
a circular window and tell him that. As if you were telling an interested<br/>
adult some things that he might find pertinent or useful at that given<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I can see lots of things being<br/>
&gt; educational,such as cooking b/c you have to measure things,but i get the<br/>
&gt; impression that if you ask any questions about it,then it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; unschooling.For example,if i tell them to give me half a cup of flour,am i<br/>
&gt; wrong to ask how do you get 1/2 cup from a measuiring cup that&#39;s 1 cup?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a test and nothing but a test and as such isn&#39;t unschooling. :) Now,<br/>
if my daughter were getting more and more interested in cooking (which she<br/>
is) I might sometimes explain a fraction-of-the-moment to her but mostly<br/>
she&#39;s sorted those out without me having to lecture about them or ask her to<br/>
prove what she knows -- we just use them and she picks up the concepts as we<br/>
go along.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; guess i was thinking unschooling was more strict but i can see i&#39;m far<br/>
&gt; off.i guess i kind of see things as surveys since i do so many.lol!i just<br/>
&gt; think it&#39;s more than normal to ask people whatthey thought about ertain<br/>
&gt; things & what was it about,especially movies so i would know if it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; something i want to see or not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the purpose of the question is to find out if they liked the movie and<br/>
get a handy movie review for yourself, it&#39;s as unschoolish as anything else.<br/>
If the purpose of the question is to test their comprehension and see what<br/>
they&#39;ve learned through it, it&#39;s not. Motive counts in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i&#39;m just very concerned they will not learn all the things they need to<br/>
&gt; know to get into a college.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if they don&#39;t want to go to college? :) It&#39;s not a death sentence. And<br/>
even if they do want to go to college, unschoolers can and do and have.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;i&#39;ve never given my children tests but i would<br/>
&gt; imagine one day i will so they will be prepared for college.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure. And if they show interest in college as they get toward &quot;college age&quot;<br/>
you can point out to them that knowing how to take tests there will be a<br/>
useful skill, and you can help them find practice tests and such that they<br/>
can do. But to start testing early a child who might not even want college<br/>
is unnecessary -- a five or eight year old unschooled child is a long way<br/>
from college, and learning how to take tests doesn&#39;t require years to<br/>
master.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;i do understand<br/>
&gt; lots of learning comes from daily life,but i don&#39;t see how my children<br/>
&gt; could ever figure out how to add fractions with different denominators if i<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t show them by giving them work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they have a need to know how to figure out how to add fractions with<br/>
different denominators, they will either develop the skill on their own (I<br/>
know it&#39;s hard to believe from where you&#39;re sitting now. I may be a radical<br/>
unschooler but I was still pretty astounded when my always-unschooled<br/>
never-seen-a-math-worksheet daughter made up her own one day, for fun, and<br/>
showed me later) or, if you see they have a real-life need for that skill<br/>
right then, you can offer to show them how to do it. It&#39;s different to give<br/>
them information relevant-to-now than to prepare against a possible future<br/>
educational need.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;is there some strategy unschoolers have<br/>
&gt; to teach these harder things without resorting to &quot;school work&quot;?another<br/>
&gt; example would be adding money,we rarely use cash,use credit cards so i feel<br/>
&gt; i had to teach her by buying play money.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could instead just use some cash sometimes. I don&#39;t remember how old<br/>
your daughter is, but when she has some money of her own to spend, she will<br/>
learn all about money and change and such, and right quick. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-960409322">well,in my opinion up to 3 years old is fine,after all they are just babies,they don&#39;t know that you are not supposed to see that unless they are told by somebody.besides,that&#39;s how that child got here anyways.and if you are under the blankets,for all the child knows,you&#39;re not doing anything interesting so it&#39;s no big deal. :)<br/>

(not tied to chores as we don&#39;t have them) and it is amazing how quickly<br/>
he is picking up on money things. He saves everything to buy new bionicles<br/>
(around $8). He is getting really good at identifying coins as well as <br/>
being able to add up  his dollars. He just learned this week that 5+5=10<br/>
because my grandmother and my dad each gave him $5 for halloween and he<br/>
was so excited to learn he could go out and get another bionicle immediately!<br/>
Then to make things even better, we decided to go to the lego outlet nearby<br/>
and they had the figures he wanted marked down to $5 so he was able to get<br/>
2 instead of 1.<br/>
<br/>
Money is one thing I have absolutely no doubt that Jason will be able to master.<br/>

<br/>
  &gt; I guess we are already &quot;unschooling&quot; baby E., given the thread on sex that<br/>
  &gt; I read this morning.  Both hubby and I think that our culture is way too<br/>
  &gt; repressive when it comes to sex, and since we aren&#39;t embarrassed about our<br/>
  &gt; functioning, and baby finds it interesting, we don&#39;t necessarily reserve it<br/>
  &gt; for times that he is asleep or at Gramma&#39;s.  In many (other) cultures,<br/>
  &gt; parents do directly teach their children about sex, and watching is the first<br/>
  step.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I haven&#39;t told my friends, because they would think I am perverted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  With a six month old, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a pervert. :)<br/>

I don&#39;t know where or If I draw a line on that.  Hubby thinks no line should<br/>
be drawn; the whole concept is new to me as I was raised in a very repressed<br/>
