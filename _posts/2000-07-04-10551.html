<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223451395">Hi Stella<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Dawn F. (born in England and moved to America at 22)... have two kids, 5 <br/>
in August and 9 months old.  Just started the unschooling thing and still <br/>
learning lots and lots from people on this list and also from the <br/>
homeschooling group I&#39;ve joined in Tucson, Arizona, where we currently <br/>
live... Yes it&#39;s 105 today and we are off to the pool soon... July 4th here <br/>
so most people are off work and having bar-b-qs and fireworks tonight.  This <br/>
year we bought fireworks for November 5th, when I&#39;m going to have a Guy <br/>
Fawkes party....  Going to start showing Zak (5yr old) some of the things I <br/>
did growing up in England.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome<br/>
<br/>
Dawn F</div>
