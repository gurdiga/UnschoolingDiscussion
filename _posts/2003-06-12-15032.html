<br/>
I had saved your bio hoping to comment and time flowed by (especially quickly <br/>
in my e-mail inbox, it seemed) and I wanted to say it was really wonderful to <br/>
read.  I&#39;ve just read it again, and the peace and energy popped back out <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I read all ( the late) John Holt books, some before <br/>
the boys were born.  I read all Growing Without Schooling ( from # 1 to <br/>
the end), I read all( the late) Donn Reed&#39;s books, and lots more. .&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need us, but we could sure use you!!<br/>
<br/>
If you have time and mood one of these days and would be willing to write <br/>
something for the typical days page, that would be wonderful.  &quot;What&#39;s a typical <br/>
unschooling day&quot; is one of the most-asked questions, and the only book out <br/>
there with typical days (A Patchwork of Days) is *very* light on <br/>
unschooling/liberal/non-structured families.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve collected so far:<br/>

&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical&quot;">http://sandradodd.com/typical&quot;</a>&gt;Typical Unschooling Days&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But there are also these moments, I would like to trap in time:  Like <br/>
when the three of them played guitar in a concert last month ( they only <br/>
started to play last November );  or seeing them acting plays they  <br/>
authored; Or seeing the twins and one of their friend putting a whole <br/>
service for the fellowship  ( Philip was the service leader !  );  Or <br/>
listening to  Lewis discussing computer system configurations with one <br/>
of our specialist friend...( and our friend was awed by his knowledge, <br/>
which was way over my head )&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could trap some moments for others, in part, maybe.<br/>
That was great to read, your whole bio post.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the very delayed reaction.<br/>
<br/>
