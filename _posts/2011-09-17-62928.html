<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448107140">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sometimes i also feel agressed by your hapiness and how much unschooling <br/>
values hapiness and adequate activities to children needs. I feel <br/>
agressed because sometimes i dont know how to be that happy mother. <br/>
Today i asked my husband to come back from work because i could not stop crying and did not want our sun to have a bad day with me (the reason <br/>
is not important). In other days i&#39;m not crying but i feel and see i <br/>
cant respond to is needs (fisical smart, i supose) and i&#39;m to tyred to <br/>
do fisical stuff. The other day i was reading here about a trampolin, we will love one like that but have no space. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 Are you depressed?<br/>
Your son is very young and sometimes post-partum depression can stay for a long time. I know my sister suffered for years when she had her youngest. It took her  realizing it was depression to be able to work on it and get out of it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is you native language Portuguese? I ask because of your son&#39;s name. I am from Brazil.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504965170"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Are you depressed?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the question that was building up for me as I read.<br/>
<br/>
While people here might be able to make suggestions to pieces of what  <br/>
you&#39;re going through, they&#39;d ultimately be like bandages on wounds  <br/>
that are festering inside. The surface might look better but what&#39;s  <br/>
causing the problem is underneath.<br/>

<br/>
At his age, you don&#39;t really have to go anywhere specific, just someplace relatively safe for him to explore: someplace with stairs so he can go up and down, over and over. Is there anywhere nearby with a fountain? Hours of fun. Anything he can climb? A low wall or a tall curb for him to walk on? It can help to get down on the ground and look at the world from his perspective - what&#39;s interesting from down there? Take him places where there aren&#39;t a lot of people so he can run, and take him places where there are people so he can look at people and socialize if he wants. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On those days i  feel sad that my son does not like our nest<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter isn&#39;t a very social person, but when she was 2 she wanted to go out every day. So for awhile we went out every day - or nearly. It didn&#39;t matter where, for the most part. It might help to think that you&#39;re &quot;nest&quot; is so comfortable he&#39;s now ready to step out of it and explore, knowing the nest will be there when he gets back. That&#39;s one of the ways kids grow more independent - its a good thing! You&#39;ve made a nice safe place he can trust well enough to step away from. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our house is very small<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*************<br/>
<br/>
Can you make a simple slide? Look for something smooth - a piece of counter-top, a piece of metal or plastic... depending on where you live you may be able to scavenge something. When my kids were little I had a piece of plastic pipe I got from a construction dumpster, about .75m across and maybe 1.5m long. It made a nice tunnel to crawl through, it could be rolled back and forth with a giggling child inside, and with one end propped up it was a slide. <br/>
<br/>
Look for old mattresses and cushions, too. Those can be used to jump on, or to build with like giant blocks, draped with cloths to make tents or &quot;caves&quot; - and then stacked up in a corner out of the way or used as furniture. <br/>
