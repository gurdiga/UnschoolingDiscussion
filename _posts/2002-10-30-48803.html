&lt;&lt; I guess I&#39;d better figure it out before it comes time to talk to the <br/>
kiddies about using &#39;em! I really don&#39;t think I want them doing what I did, <br/>
I&#39;d like them to be &quot;prepared&quot;.<br/>

Ok, this isn&#39;t just for Myranda, but anyone out there that has had any <br/>
questions about sex and what guys REALLY like. Most of &#39;em anyway.<br/>
Get the book &quot;How to Be a Great Lover&quot; by Lou Paget (Girlfriend to girlfriend <br/>
totally explicit techniques that will blow his mind).<br/>
If you read that, and still can&#39;t explain condoms to your kids, you have <br/>
major problems!!:)<br/>
Anyone could learn a lot from that book, it&#39;s amazing! <br/>
Graphic drawings for the unsure....<br/>
