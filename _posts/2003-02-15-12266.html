<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you know someone who knows someone!<br/>
<br/>
My grandma used to fix huge dinner/lunches for The Men at harvest time. <br/>
They&#39;d go into  the fields outside of town and use threshers and <br/>
combines (are they the same thing?), then come in and consume mass <br/>
quantities. My grandparents didn&#39;t even farm, so I don&#39;t know why she <br/>
did the cooking. Grandpa really wanted to be a farmer, but Grandma said <br/>
she&#39;d have a nervous breakdown if she had to be stuck out in the <br/>
country; instead, he became a rural mail-carrier (drove a team of <br/>
horses at first, then a Harley later) and made their entire backyard <br/>
into a garden--so big I could get lost in it when I was little.<br/>
<br/>
My sister used to be married to a hog farmer in southwestern MN. One <br/>
day she was visiting us in &quot;The Cities&quot; and got a call from him saying <br/>
her favorite black lab had been caught in the combine and killed. I&#39;ll <br/>
never forget standing in the bathroom and hearing her scream from the <br/>
kitchen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Being a nonfarmer but a good guesser, my guess would be that a combine<br/>
*combines* 2 or more machines that used to be separate.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s what my dictionary says. A combine heads, threshes and cleans<br/>
grain. I&#39;m not sure what each of those is in farm terms but I could guess<br/>
again ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552088608">Mama deer sometimes have their babies curl up in the tall hay and it has<br/>
happened around here more than once they get killed or nearly killed.  <br/>
Lot&#39;s of farmers let their dogs run out there just to chase little fawns<br/>
so they don&#39;t have that problem.   I haven&#39;t heard about anyone&#39;s dog<br/>
getting it, but I bet it&#39;s happened.   Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
But it would have worked on those aliens I bet.   AND they wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
had their little crop circle landing grid thingy anymore either.  <br/>

Deb, who always thought it was those smart border collies making crop<br/>
circles for their amusement...<br/>

<br/>
Nana likes to run a few circles around me when we go for a walk, really<br/>
tight, fast circles. Then she stops ahead of me and stands very still<br/>
until I get up to her and just lightly touch her chin, and then she takes<br/>
off again!<br/>
<br/>
She has a black lab friend now, we dogsat for a couple of days, and we&#39;ve<br/>
invited another border collie to come visit next week (as well as his 4<br/>
human kids and their mother),<br/>
