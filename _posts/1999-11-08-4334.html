&lt;&lt;But do you know what, she would do nothing about it<br/>
<br/>
if I just looked at her and said &quot;great honey - study the ocean!&quot;  So what<br/>
<br/>
do you do differently when your child wants to study a subject?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know you were looking for a general, philosophical answer here, but I don&#39;t <br/>
have one!  So let me jump to a specific.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and son are both ocean nuts, so I would strongly recommend <br/>
underwater nature shows on PBS-TV.  In my area the local PBS stations have <br/>
websites that list their upcoming programming for the week.  I like to scan <br/>
this information on the weekends and check which shows are worth taping <br/>
during the week.<br/>
<br/>
One of my all-time favorites was an episode of Nature about octopi, called <br/>
Incredible Suckers.  Watching an octopus ooze it&#39;s body through a teeny, tiny <br/>
hole is just fascinating.<br/>
