<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052361304">Hi all, we have a snake in need. A tiny baby garter anake, less than a quarter inch in diameter, doesn&#39;t seem interested in insects - we got it from a friend, it&#39;s been captive for about two weeks now. Does anyone know how we can get the little guy to eat? His<br/>
skin is getting flacid, we&#39;re worried about the little guy! Thanks in advance. Logan</div>
