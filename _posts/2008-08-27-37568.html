<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363275640">So...<br/>
<br/>
This might be useful for explaining to an older relative what&#39;s okay  <br/>
about knowing something &quot;trivial&quot; in detail:<br/>

<br/>
Those who know both the original Star Trek series and Monty Python  <br/>
and the Holy Grail will find hundreds of fascinating details in  <br/>
this.  Those who know neither one won&#39;t have a clue.   It could be a  <br/>
good jumping-off place for discussions of &quot;collage&quot; as an art form  <br/>
(static or moving) and of video editing and of the kind of visual  <br/>
talent helpful to being able to find certain kinds of gestures and  <br/>
body movements and facial expressions from a huge mass of images.<br/>
<br/>
The memories it will bring up in each viewer will be different.   <br/>
Those for whom it brings up NO memories have not led as rich a life  <br/>
as they might have.  Teens and younger are excused; they might&#39;ve  <br/>
missed either or both of the originals, but in such cases they will  <br/>
probably be able to show the older folks around them similar types of  <br/>
humor based on the melding of two things they know well and we don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The light sabre videos (from Braveheart, Raiders of the Lost Ark and  <br/>
other such things) are minor examples.  Technically VERY very cool,  <br/>
but not a full scene overlaid as with this one.<br/>
<br/>
If you know of or discover similar examples, please post them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127393184">This is so cool.  BOTH my girls will not only enjoy it, but they will get it at a deep level.  Alexx had to watch the holy grail for her TART class at CC, and Janene ended up watching it with her, and of course that meant that I had to watch it.  And Janene and I watch Star Trek daily, with Alexx teasing us that it&#39;s geeky.  <br/>

As a Shakespearophobe, I have to admit that was one the funniest things <br/>
I have EVER watched. I literally peed my pants. (I should have paused <br/>
to make a potty trip *more* than once!!!)<br/>
<br/>
No one was home at the time: I was all alone. But I laughed so <br/>
hard---and wished for company. I played certain bits over and over and <br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
So, I WON&#39;T say that I&#39;m over my school-induced hatred of Shakespeare, <br/>
but I *did* attend Measure for Measure last night in Charleston. <br/>
Cameron&#39;s girlfriend, Carly, was Mistress Overdone.<br/>
<br/>
To me, Shakespeare is *still* a bunch of words I know tossed into a <br/>
salad spinner and randomly spit out. Nevertheless, we had a good time. <br/>
