<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267274365"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hey, we don&#39;t have a car - by choice!<br/>
&gt;Donna Andrea in Nova Scotia<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We haven&#39;t had one, living in urban PA for almost 4 years.  We are getting<br/>
one this fall, a minivan no less.  In that four years we have gone from one<br/>
3.5 year old to a 7 year old, a 2 year old and we&#39;ll have a new born.  I<br/>
have reached the limit of what I feel I can handle without one.  It is<br/>
begining to limit what I can do for/with the kids.  And for/with my family.<br/>
In other words--the benefits finacially and health wise are no longer<br/>
outweighed by other benefits.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve been glad to have these years.  Glad that we all had to be more<br/>
thoughtful about what we do.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;ll be really glad not to take three kids on the city<br/>
buses.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about trade offs.  If you feel you are still giving enough options<br/>
and don&#39;t feel trapped by no car (I didn&#39;t for years) then good for you.<br/>
They cost a bloody fortune!  That&#39;s money for other things.<br/>
