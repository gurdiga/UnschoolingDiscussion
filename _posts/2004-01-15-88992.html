-- on the other children already there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, we didn&#39;t set out to adopt another child.  When the<br/>
situation with my niece first happened, we really believed that it<br/>
would last 2-3 months.  As time went by and we learned more, we&#39;re<br/>
realized that it&#39;s probably going to be forever and our family now<br/>
thinks of our niece as one of our bio children.  I&#39;m not at<br/>
liberty to discuss the details of the case, but I think many people<br/>
would make the same choice we did, if they knew the entire situation.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we&#39;re not adopting our niece.  We will probably get legal<br/>
(as opposed to permanent) custody.  This means that her parents will<br/>
still have some residual rights.  We would prefer adoption, but<br/>
that&#39;s<br/>
not an easy thing to getÂ—the parents would have to sign away all<br/>
of<br/>
their rights to her, or be PROVEN to be harmful to her.  <br/>

Joyce wrote:  That&#39;s not saying you&#39;re a bad mom for adopting. It&#39;s<br/>
not saying that you should have turned the child down. It&#39;s saying<br/>
there may be a pattern of looking at more ways you can help when<br/>
taking on more means you wont&#39; be able to give the time needed to what<br/>
you&#39;ve already taken on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This, along with something Sandra wrote (see below), is REALLY<br/>
helpful.  Thank you both for helping me to realize that I need to take<br/>
some time to listen to the thoughts and feelings of my children, as<br/>
well as not take on too much.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra wrote: &quot;My point at first and now was that if an oldest<br/>
child with or without a diagnosis of some frustration-producing<br/>
&quot;disorder&quot; seems frustrated and the mom doesn&#39;t have time to soothe<br/>
and calm him, the fact of the mom&#39;s lack of time IS a factor and<br/>
should be considered a factor.<br/>
<br/>
It might be nice if he could just be TOLD to buck up and get over it,<br/>
but he&#39;s a kid with real kid needs.  He could be drugged, but when the<br/>
drugs wear off will he be in a smaller family with a happier mom?<br/>
<br/>
When parents decide kids&#39; feelings aren&#39;t justified or aren&#39;t &quot;okay,&quot;<br/>
that&#39;s the beginning of the end of their relationship with that<br/>
child.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Joyce wrote, &quot;It&#39;s suggesting you need to find ways to<br/>
make sacrifices to cut back so that you can get the most out of the<br/>
energy and time you have.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was good advice!  You&#39;re absolutely right on this one.  We<br/>
were contacted yesterday about a new development involving our niece<br/>
and we have drawn a line in the sand in order to protect our<br/>
family&#39;s<br/>
needs and not take too much from our own family.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to all of the wonderful subscribers who have given advice<br/>
and counsel about ways to find time for myself and conserve energy. <br/>
Thanks, also, to the person who told me to stop calling myself a bad<br/>
unschooling mother! <br/>
