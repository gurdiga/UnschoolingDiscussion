<div id="ygrps-yiv-340778945">I&#39;m ready to scream.<br/>
I took some pics of my kids with the shields and swords we made<br/>
tonight.  Now I&#39;d love to be able to put them into a medieval setting.<br/>
I have adobe photoshop, and photoplus, and photoexpress, and I can&#39;t<br/>
figure out how to do it in any of them.<br/>
Does anyone know how I can learn this??<br/>
I&#39;ve tried books at the library, but they are soooo confusing!!<br/>
I love my digital camera, but I wish I could do more with the pictures.<br/>
Thanks...<br/>

   With Adobe Photoshop, I open the picture I want to edit, than <br/>
click on &quot;Layers&quot; at the top......the layer you will be working with <br/>
will show up there.  I usually than make a copy of the layer (in case <br/>
I screw it up and have to delete it) and do my editing in the copy.  <br/>
If you want to put the kids in a castle picture for example, you can <br/>
use the magic eraser to erase the background around the kids and than <br/>
use the move tool to pull them into the castle pic (which you have to <br/>
have open as well) This is so hard to explain in an email.....To see <br/>
what I mean.....I just made a picture of some pot bellied piggies <br/>
having a pool party......its on my website on the link called PALS:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.home.net/nigeyjetty/nigel.htm">http://members.home.net/nigeyjetty/nigel.htm</a><br/>
click on the red wording that says pool party....<br/>
Its a pretty good example I think of pulling things into another <br/>
background.  If you can&#39;t get to it write me off list and I will send <br/>
you the pic......<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:norjetacademy@...">norjetacademy@...</a><br/>
If you do an Adobe Photoshop Tutorial search on the net you will get <br/>
instructions as well.  That is how I learned to do this.  There is <br/>
also a clone stamp in that program that is a lot of fun to use.  Good <br/>
luck and I would love to see the picture when you are finished.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513428724">Do you still have the CD&#39;s that came with Adobe Photoshop? There is a <br/>
tutorial on there that I found very useful. Also, there is a series <br/>
of books called &quot;Visual Quickstart Guides&quot; by Peachpit Press which <br/>
are excellent for visual learners. They have a Photoshop guide. You <br/>
can also find them online at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.quickstartonline.com">http://www.quickstartonline.com</a> where <br/>
you can get a limited trial membership to use the books online for <br/>
free.<br/>
<br/>
Do you use ICQ or MS Messenger? If you do, I can talk you through a <br/>
photo manipulation project, if you like. We could set a time, and you <br/>
could get your photos and medieval backgrounds together and we can <br/>
put the shots together.  I&#39;m <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sterling_poet@...">sterling_poet@...</a> on MSM and ICQ <br/>
