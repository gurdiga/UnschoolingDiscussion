<div id="ygrps-yiv-83663525">**I don&#39;t consider unschooling to be accurately characterized as<br/>
&quot;child-led learning&quot; - I think that expression is part of the<br/>
difficulty we unschoolers have in getting the idea across, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
As Tammy said in the below paragraph - unschooling is very<br/>
parent-involved. It is more of a &quot;learning tango&quot; &lt;G&gt; where parents and<br/>
children interact and their ideas and energies and voices and<br/>
activities intertwine. We could think of it as a dance in which<br/>
sometimes one leads and sometimes the other - but, really, most of the<br/>
time it isn&#39;t that one leads - they simply move together. I think the<br/>
idea of the children &quot;leading&quot; can be misleading and confuse people&#39;s<br/>
understanding of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody asked me today, &quot;So, do you just sit there and wait until your<br/>
child says they want to learn about something? And then you figure out<br/>
how teach it to them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That is so NOT how unschooling works - but I can see how people would<br/>
think that when they hear &quot;child-led learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-pam**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pam, do you mind me dragging this over (from the HSC list) and using it <br/>
as a conversation starter here?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very available to my kid and very responsive to him, but I&#39;m not <br/>
sure if much of anything at my house is &quot;parent led&quot;.  I don&#39;t know if <br/>
this is my natural temperament, or a carefully evolved strategy that <br/>
suits my child, or my exaggerated fear of committing an unschooling <br/>
&quot;sin&quot; by pushing to hard.  (It could even be poor recollection on my <br/>
part.  Maybe my softshoe shuffle really is like a tango. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
In the absence of an expressed interest from my child, I find it hard to <br/>
know what to do other than go to the park, visit friends, or hang out <br/>
around the house.  Really.  But my kid strongly prefers staying home <br/>
over going out and having adventures, so maybe I&#39;m just being respectful <br/>
of his wishes.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just not seeing the trees for the forest, or something.  But <br/>
sometimes I think I am doing this all wrong because it doesn&#39;t resemble <br/>
the pictures I get of other people&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
Could you paint some footprints on the floor for me and the other <br/>
remedial unschoolers?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Betsy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073039331">Sometimes the illustration of respectful parenting that is used <br/>
is &quot;would you say/do that with your spouse/SO/best friend?&quot; I think <br/>
in some ways you might extend that to this topic too (but don&#39;t <br/>
stretch it too far). Think about when you and spouse/SO were first <br/>
together (and hopefully still are but it is especially evident in <br/>
the first bloom of a relationship) - if s/he discovered a love for <br/>
big band music, you&#39;d keep your ears open for concerts in your area, <br/>
you&#39;d pick up books and CDs if you spotted something and sometimes <br/>
even go the extra mile to get something that you knew would be &quot;just <br/>
right&quot;. You didn&#39;t &quot;instruct&quot; in the finer points of big band music <br/>
or &quot;study&quot; the social and economic situations of the times, you <br/>
didn&#39;t require the interest to last x amount of time or go to y <br/>
depth and didn&#39;t require some z level of mastery of the subject. You <br/>
supported and enjoyed their enjoyment until that interest passed <br/>
perhaps or perhaps it became a permanent fixture at your home. I <br/>
think in many ways that&#39;s the way it works with our kids too - the <br/>
main difference being their dependence on us for things like money <br/>
and transportation. And, for an adult you might pick up something <br/>
and say Gee this looks like something s/he might like? and you bring <br/>
it around and they like it or not and that&#39;s that - you don&#39;t try to <br/>
make them do or use or like whatever it is. And it might sit around <br/>
a bit until it gets looked at, and it&#39;s generally okay, adult to <br/>
adult (I know I&#39;ve bought books and things for DH and it was quite a <br/>
while before he touched them and sometimes they just aren&#39;t a good <br/>
fit at all).</div>

I love this explanation.    I can think of several people  that I&#39;ve tried to <br/>
explain unschooling to that just didn&#39;t grasp what I  was saying.  I think <br/>
they would understand this.  In particular,  I&#39;m thinking about my ex-husband <br/>
who seems very open to our lifestyle but  really isn&#39;t grasping what we do <br/>
around here.  I&#39;ll add it to my  repertoire of explanations for people who seem <br/>
sincerely interested in  unschooling or at least in what in the world we&#39;re doing <br/>
around here! :-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m wanting to look more closely at the prior statement that <br/>
unschooling parents do a substantial amount of leading or initiating, <br/>
whereas I think I mostly wait around for him to express an interest <br/>
before taking any action.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fairly uncommon for me to buy anything for him that costs more than <br/>
$3 that he hasn&#39;t pre-approved.  Because he has shown himself to be <br/>
quite selective about what he&#39;ll approach, it seems like a waste of <br/>
money to bring something home if there seems to be only a 25% chance he <br/>
will like it.  (Having more kids and having more positive kids would <br/>
change the cost-benefit picture, I think).  Having three kids who like <br/>
say 50% of all well-selected new things could raise one&#39;s likely success <br/>
rate to 87.5%)  (Right?)<br/>
<br/>
When I am *following* his lead, and going with interests that I know he <br/>
has (e.g. Garfield books), then I&#39;d probably buy it.  But, to me, that <br/>
fits in the category of waiting until he has an interest and then <br/>
supporting it.  It isn&#39;t me initiating something *new*.  The whole idea <br/>
of broadening his horizons and cultivating new interests feels <br/>
mysterious and undoable to me.  Maybe because I just am not willing to <br/>
strike out that often.  (&quot;If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try, try again&quot; <br/>
is a tough philosophy for me to embrace.)<br/>
<br/>
Since we aren&#39;t in stores often, because he dislikes shopping, it&#39;s not <br/>
that common for us to even see cool new stuff.  (Remember we aren&#39;t <br/>
getting to museums with any frequency, so we aren&#39;t getting to museum <br/>
gift shops either.)  We aren&#39;t even seeing cool books, games and <br/>
thingies at Barnes and Noble, because we don&#39;t go there.  We try to get <br/>
all of our books at the library and at library book sales, because that <br/>
is what fits our restricted budget.<br/>
<br/>
You know, this is going to sound unimaginable, but since we moved <br/>
recently and signed up with the direct marketing preference thingie to <br/>
reduce junk mail, we don&#39;t even get homeschooling and toy catalogs in my <br/>
house!  (We find out about cool new things when our better-informed <br/>
friends give us birthday presents.  &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve never seen one of <br/>
these!&quot;)  (I think we did get catalogs in December, but don&#39;t get very <br/>
many.)<br/>
<br/>
**Do you never hear about a place to go and suggest it?**<br/>
<br/>
I would say that seventy or eighty percent of the time he doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to go to new places. Maybe the answer there is always to have someone to <br/>
go with, so he can have some kid companionship. <br/>
<br/>
Of the things that our co-op group talked about doing this year, the one <br/>
that he was enthusiastic about was going on a newt walk.  Unfortunately, <br/>
rain and illnesses and birthday parties have postponed this for many weeks.<br/>
<br/>
We did a big outing to the Monterey Aquarium during the three day <br/>
weekend, but that&#39;s an &quot;old&quot; place for us.  We bought a membership and <br/>
told our friends that any time they wanted to go we would carpool down <br/>
with them.  (We may not go to another &quot;museum&quot; for four months.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about going to the theater, but am often discouraged <br/>
by the ticket prices.  (even if only multiplied by three people)  *I do <br/>
need a better planning method*, though.  I got an email last week that <br/>
the local community college is doing &quot;Seussical&quot;, and that seems like a <br/>
good combination of kid-appeal, convenience, and low cost.  I just need <br/>
to convert my good intention to action, without any upfront enthusiasm <br/>
from my kid or my spouse.  (Neither of them would be panting by the <br/>
door, like dogs that want to walk to the park, which is the kind of <br/>
enthusiastic response to theater that I imagine some people may get. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
**Do you tell him about your childhood?**<br/>
<br/>
Not a lot.  We don&#39;t talk much.  He doesn&#39;t seem interested in talking <br/>
to me.  Even in the car.  But if I sit with him and watch television for <br/>
an hour (as Sandra has recommended) sometimes words to start leaking out <br/>
of him.<br/>
<br/>
**Do you watch tv and movies together at your suggestion? **<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, but not often.  He wants to make his own selections.  (I do <br/>
TiVo things that I think he might possibly be interested in.)  We have <br/>
finally run through everything he wanted from Netflix, so when I saw <br/>
that Mork and Mindy was being released, I picked that for him. (He loves <br/>
comedy and television and space, and pretty much everybody loves Robin <br/>
Williams.)  That was a big hit.  Currently we also have out Children of <br/>
Heaven (because I heard it was good) and The Right Stuff (which dh and I <br/>
have already seen, but thought James would find interesting.)  I can&#39;t <br/>
get anyone to consent to watch either of these with me.  (But we&#39;ve only <br/>
had them 3-4 days, so maybe I&#39;m giving up too soon.)  My husband&#39;s idea <br/>
of viewing pleasure is to surf and watch whatever *he wants* (normally <br/>
the History Channel), not anything that I have picked.  With two TVs, we <br/>
find ourselves in separate rooms a lot.  All of us would rather be alone <br/>
than be &quot;stuck&quot; watching something we don&#39;t find appealing.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling at my house is so different from unschooling at your house <br/>
that I&#39;m not sure that what I do could possibly still be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS  Balancing all the negative with a positive example, I did grab a <br/>
book of Optical Illusions at last month&#39;s library booksale and James and <br/>
Rick spent a lot of time looking at this together.  This type of <br/>
activity-oriented book isn&#39;t commonly found at booksales, which is what <br/>
made me start pondering what I might be missing by not going to <br/>
full-price bookstores.  At last months library sale, I did buy for James <br/>
(or for our collection) -- The Whipping Boy, Coraline, I Was a Rat, <br/>
Artemis Fowl, Midnight for Charlie Bone, and a Star Wars graphic novel.  <br/>
All 35 cents a piece.  We are fortunate to be able to get cool stuff <br/>
like this at a price where I can say &quot;I don&#39;t care if we EVER read this <br/>
or not&quot;.  I also bought eight princessy or historically set books for a <br/>
friend&#39;s daughter&#39;s birthday at the same sale.</div>

especially ironic how the scene ends as &quot;O&#39;er the land of the free&quot; is<br/>

(Another slice of school life for you sociologists out there:  My husband is<br/>
still teaching because we havent yet figured out how to earn enough money<br/>
from other sources, so he was especially interested in this.  In contrast to<br/>
the situation in this video, he said that about two people per day decide to<br/>
stand for the pledge of allegiance in his homeroom.)<br/>

Put it on.  Do something in the room where it is.  Maybe someone  will come <br/>
and join you.  Be willing to start it over, or to pause and  summarize what he <br/>

 <br/>
You could at least LOOK at full-price bookstores and maybe look then on  <br/>
amazon for a used copy of something you liked.<br/>
 <br/>
People shouldn&#39;t try to unschool for free.  Seriously, having a kid in  <br/>
school costs money, even a public school.  There are expenses.  Not  spending ANY <br/>
money on things for a kid could be neglectful.<br/>

But the books in that pile are there because the library didn&#39;t want to  <br/>
bother to put them in the library, right?  Someone donated it to the  library <br/>
(rejected it) and the library sold it cheap (rejected it).  Maybe  twice-rejected <br/>
book sales isn&#39;t the best use of your time.<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, sometimes there are good books at library book sales, I know.   <br/>
Libraries will jettison books for not having been checked out or for being no  longer <br/>
on the recommended lists.  Those books are old, though, and  something is <br/>
wrong with them one way or another.  I own pretty many ex  library books, so I&#39;m <br/>
not condemning them as a class of books, but it&#39;s not the  best pile to dig <br/>
through in general.<br/>

Have you looked to see if there is a freecycle group near you?  People <br/>
are always giving away books, household items, etc.  If you can get <br/>
stuff for free, you can definitely not worry if he is going to use it or <br/>
not.  I&#39;ve seen things like craft supplies, old magazines, building <br/>

Jackie (9) usually prefers to see a movie or read a book that she has already experienced.  So when I ask if she wants to watch a movie of my choosing, she usually says no.<br/>

If it&#39;s a movie I want to see, I put it in for me.  Sometimes she&#39;ll end up watching and sometimes not.<br/>

doesn&#39;t normally shelve them.  There are a lot of affluent people in this<br/>
town who buy their kids books.  But the selection does skew towards fiction.<br/>
The really bells-and-whistles fun nonfiction (i.e. Excavate your own mummy!)<br/>
doesn&#39;t tend to show up.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What is wrong with fiction? Is this an anti-fiction/pro-&quot;educational&quot; book<br/>
bias of yours showing up, or did I miss some important piece of info in a<br/>
prior post regarding your ds&#39;s book preferences? (The latter perfectly<br/>
possible as I am trying to clear a backlog).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799195430">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;You know, this is going to sound unimaginable, but since we moved <br/>
recently ...snip... I would say that seventy or eighty percent of the time<br/>
he doesn&#39;t want to go to new places. Maybe the answer there is always to<br/>
have someone to go with, so he can have some kid companionship.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he is just taking a longer time than some other family members to<br/>
settle in, emotionally, to the new location.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We did a big outing to the Monterey Aquarium during the three day <br/>
weekend, but that&#39;s an &quot;old&quot; place for us.  We bought a membership and <br/>
told our friends that any time they wanted to go we would carpool down <br/>
with them.  (We may not go to another &quot;museum&quot; for four months.)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We were just there too. And we also bought a membership. There is a nature<br/>
museum in Redding, CA that has a huge number of reciprocal memberships all<br/>
over the country. It is called Turtle Bay, and the membership seems<br/>
comparatively inexpensive. <br/>
<br/>
There is a very cool newt in the film &quot;Matilda&quot;. (Just some &quot;unconnected&quot;<br/>
trivia.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;(Neither of them would be panting by the <br/>
door, like dogs that want to walk to the park, which is the kind of <br/>
enthusiastic response to theater that I imagine some people may get.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As someone who has worked in the theater at all levels for most of my<br/>
professional life, and really loved the life, I finally had to accept that I<br/>
was, nonetheless, *not* a theater-goer. Maybe he would be interested in<br/>
working in a theater rather than seeing it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My husband&#39;s idea <br/>
of viewing pleasure is to surf and watch whatever *he wants* (normally <br/>
the History Channel), not anything that I have picked.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aha! My husband&#39;s long lost twin separated at birth!!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Unschooling at my house is so different from unschooling at your house<br/>
<br/>
that I&#39;m not sure that what I do could possibly still be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy (under dark rainy clouds today) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dear Betsy, the clouds will pass (maybe they already have). We have all been<br/>
reading your posts for long enough to know that you are unschooling (unless<br/>
you have secretly instituted some kind of imposed lesson regime that you are<br/>
keeping from us). One great brilliance of Unschooling is that it does look<br/>
different in everyone&#39;s home, and with each individual child - but the<br/>
freedom is still there - even the freedom to grump about and not seem to be<br/>
into much just now. <br/>

If a family has a rich, busy, involved life the parents don&#39;t <br/>
necessarily have to make an out-of-context-point to introduce <br/>
something in order for a child to have access to it.  In fact, my <br/>
children have introduced *me* to a few things along the way. :-)  <br/>
That&#39;s not to say that out-of-context introducing things isn&#39;t a <br/>
good thing, just that it&#39;s possible for children to discover things <br/>

I see what you&#39;re saying.  But those are all things (internet, tv, <br/>
people, places, magazines) that would be there even if the child <br/>
wasn&#39;t.  I thought from Betsy&#39;s posts that she was referring more to <br/>
special things gotten specifically to catch a child&#39;s interest... <br/>
conscious input as opposed to input (like conversation) that&#39;s a by-<br/>
product of living a busy life.<br/>
<br/>
My energy as an unschooling mother ebbs and flows, with my higher <br/>
energy times resulting in more of the conscious type of input, but <br/>
I&#39;ve found that even when I&#39;m exhausted or stressed for a while and <br/>
not doing much leading my kids go right on learning and discovering <br/>
things anyway.  I remember one time bringing a book of short <br/>
biographies home from the library thinking that it was important for <br/>
me to &quot;expose&quot; my kids to these historical figures.  It turned out <br/>
that they already knew about many of them from a time travel cartoon <br/>
on cable. :-)<br/>
  <br/>
Many of my children&#39;s various passions over the years, while <br/>
nurtured and supported by me, were definitely not introduced by me.  <br/>

Betsy? If you are doing nothing but waiting around for him to express <br/>
an interest, not offering any input, how does he have a clue what there <br/>
is available in the world in which to express an interest?**<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to say that I initiate nothing, just that it is a far cry from a fifty-fifty balance of me leading then him leading, which is what I thought your tango metaphor was expressing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still thinking about how to give him as much access to the whole wide world as he will take.  I will continue to consider your question abovr.  What he has abundantly are TV stations, library books, play dates, walks, interesting used stuff and time and freedom.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that we stay home all the time, it&#39;s that if I think we&#39;d both be happier with an outing then what I offer is a familiar and deeply enjoyed outing (park, friend&#39;s house, toy store, beach, aquarium) not an unfamiliar outing, since his willingness to be talked into trying something new is very low.  This is why I say I am not leading him in new directions or putting my efforts deliberately towards broadening him.<br/>
<br/>
Since I don&#39;t find his interests very similar to mine and find them sometimes hard to guess since he is fairly closemouthed, I don&#39;t have a great track record picking outings.  If I say &quot;Hey, I&#39;m sure it will be fabulous&quot;, he makes a skeptical face.  And I think it&#39;s reasonable for him to be skeptical.  It&#39;s not clear to me how to get past that.  When to try to sway him and when to fully accept his decision without argument.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be incompatible with unschooling for me to insist on him going places when he declined.  I get advice from my conventional homeschooling friends to do that, but it seems like the wrong way to go.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it isn&#39;t incompatible with unschooling for me to learn to be a better saleswoman. (If you&#39;ve seen cartoons showing how bad Dilbert is at salesmanship because he&#39;s the stereotypical engineer, that applies pretty well to me, too.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you do yard sales and flea markets/thrift stores?  One thing that <br/>
I did this week was make peanut butter from a peanut butter machine <br/>
that I got at a flea market (My dad&#39;s flea market, so I didn&#39;t have <br/>
to pay for it, but he would&#39;ve sold it for $1.00 so it wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
been expensive for anyone).  I also found one of those cookie press <br/>
things at the flea market($1.00) because my son has seen ads for them <br/>
on tv and has pointed them out to me several times, so I knew he&#39;d <br/>
want that.  There was also an old kitchen chemistry kit put out for a <br/>
quarter, and there were really neat ideas in there and even some <br/>
supplies that could still be used.  So I bought peanuts and cookie <br/>
ingredients and yeast for the kitchen chemistry kit, and made peanut <br/>
butter and soft pretzels and (will make) cookies.  If the kids hadn&#39;t <br/>
gotten interested that would have been okay, because I have to make <br/>
them food anyway, so I could&#39;ve just made them myself and then given <br/>
them the peanut butter and pretzels to eat.  But they REALLY got into <br/>
the pretzels, and my 5 year old REALLY got into punching down that <br/>
dough.   <br/>
<br/>
I tend to go crazy at yard sales buying stuff (which are summer <br/>
weather occasions only around here), and it&#39;s okay if I get so much <br/>
that we don&#39;t get to it for months or years or never, because I get <br/>
it REALLY cheap.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is he happy and content?  Does he seem to be needing something new?  <br/>
How does he spend his time?  <br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; **Do you never hear about a place to go and suggest it?**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would say that seventy or eighty percent of the time he doesn&#39;t <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to go to new places. Maybe the answer there is always to have <br/>
 </span></blockquote>someone to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; go with, so he can have some kid companionship. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds familiar &lt;grin&gt;.  Remember the hot dog/play date <br/>
conversation.  Maybe he just doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere.  It can get <br/>
to the point where you&#39;re working SO hard to try to find some little <br/>
way that you might possibly be able to get them to agree to go <br/>
somewhere.  When I find myself at that point, I remind myself that <br/>
I&#39;m probably trying to get him to do something he doesn&#39;t want to do <br/>
because *I* am worried that he &quot;should&quot; go out and do more things.  <br/>
It really is a hard thing to balance though!  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about going to the theater, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why? I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s wrong, but I&#39;ve learned to examine my <br/>
motives before I plan a trip.  It&#39;s one way I&#39;ve found that helps me <br/>
find that balance between offering cool stuff and pushing for <br/>
something because I think I/we *should*.   Is it something you want <br/>
to do?  Is it something you would want to go to even if he didn&#39;t <br/>
come along?  Is it something that you *know* would trhill him, or is <br/>
it something that maybe you might be able to get him to go to without <br/>
a major amount of complaint?  Are you doing it just because <br/>
you &quot;should&quot; get him out more?  <br/>
<br/>
When there was a winter festival at a nearby farm, I tried to get all <br/>
my kids to go.  They all said no, and so we didn&#39;t go.  I could&#39;ve <br/>
gone by myself, but when I seriously considered it, I realized that I <br/>
didn&#39;t really want to go for myself.  I wanted to go for them.  I <br/>
thought it would have neat stuff to &quot;expose&quot; them to.  After the <br/>
festival was over there was a story and pictures in the paper about <br/>
it, and I felt a pang of &quot;Darn, I wish we could&#39;ve gone&quot;, and again <br/>
realized that I wouldn&#39;t have felt that if I didn&#39;t have kids.  I <br/>
really think it was a bit of schooly &quot;expose them to a lot of <br/>
educational things&quot; kind of feeling that still pops up every once in <br/>
awhile.  I wasn&#39;t so much attracted to taking them to the festival <br/>
because of anything there that I thought would particularly interest <br/>
any one of them.  It was just that it was a &quot;good experience&quot; that I <br/>
wanted to &quot;expose&quot; them to.  It would make me feel like a good, well-<br/>
rounded unschooler.  And it would make me feel &quot;normal&quot;, like I go <br/>
lots of cool places with my kids like everyone else.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to explain unschooling to friends/relatives when you can <br/>
tell them about theatre productions and festivals and museums that <br/>
you went to, because all that sounds very &quot;educational&quot; and <br/>
impressive. In my state, it also makes good fodder for the <br/>
portfolio.  But when your homebody kids stay home and read and cook <br/>
and play video games and watch tv and play, and it seems that every <br/>
time you tell them about what your kids are doing it&#39;s the same <br/>
thing, you feel a pressure to be &quot;exposing them&quot; to more so that you <br/>
sound more impressive.  I know that it&#39;s not the same old thing every <br/>
day and that they learn and do interesting stuff all the time but to <br/>
other people who don&#39;t get unshcooling, it sounds like the same old <br/>
thing sometimes I think.  That&#39;s been my experience, anyway.  Good <br/>
thing we didn&#39;t choose to be parents for the purpose of impressing <br/>
our friends, huh? ;) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think &quot;expose them to a lot of things&quot; is necessarily schooly. <br/>
I think it is part of what unschooling parents do.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy - if he goes along with 20 to 30 percent of what you suggest (you <br/>
said 70 to 80 percent of the time he didn&#39;t), then what&#39;s wrong with <br/>
that? Sounds like a good chunk of the time, to me.<br/>
<br/>
I see absolutely nothing wrong with thinking that he ought to be <br/>
exposed to a theater experience. Find a local high school  or community <br/>
college production of a lively rousing good-time show and say you want <br/>
him to go with you. Don&#39;t take him to an opera for his first live <br/>
theater performance, though - use good sense about what is likely to be <br/>
more fun for a novice theater-goer.<br/>
<br/>
Same with other outings. We have local baseball and hockey teams - <br/>
their games are very entertaining. Be willing to stay for an inning or <br/>
two, only. Local festivals of all kinds - again - be willing to just <br/>
have a taste of them and then go. This will be Irish festival weekend - <br/>
go spend 20 minutes watching some Irish dancers somewhere. Mention to <br/>
him that their dresses can cost over a thousand dollars - wonder why? <br/>
Wonder how often they wear out their shoes? YOU read up on it a bit in <br/>
advance so that you can throw out a few tidbits of information - make <br/>
it interesting for him.<br/>
<br/>
Stop by somewhere new on your way to a familiar place - &quot;I just want to <br/>
stop in and see what this place is like....then we&#39;ll go to park day <br/>
after that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Grocery shopping - pick up a fruit you&#39;ve never tried and just say, &quot;I <br/>
wonder what this is like - I&#39;m going to buy one and cut it open at <br/>
home.&quot; When&#39;s the last time you had a pineapple or a coconut or a mango <br/>
or kiwi?<br/>
<br/>
The first time you went the aquarium was the FIRST time. There had to <br/>
be a first time for all those things you listed as being tried and true <br/>
outings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you have to be on the go constantly - but if you&#39;re <br/>
spending time at home, then home ought to be filled with opportunities <br/>
and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re expecting too much in terms of &quot;showing interest&quot; for a <br/>
kid who doesn&#39;t express himself that way. He doesn&#39;t need to be wild <br/>
about things - just mild notice for a few minutes is enough. With a kid <br/>
who is so selective, who turns his nose up at so many of your <br/>
offerings, I don&#39;t see why you&#39;d cut back and not offer much - why not <br/>
make more experiences and opportunities available so he has more to <br/>
choose from. Twenty percent of a hundred things is 20 --- twenty <br/>
percent of 10 things is only 2.<br/>
<br/>
Also - you read 50/50 into what I wrote - when, in fact, what I wrote <br/>
was that sometimes one leads and sometimes the other.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m definitely not doing 50 percent of the initiating of my kids&#39; <br/>
experiences and exposure anymore. They&#39;re too involved in their own <br/>
things for that. But I gave them a bit of exposure to all kinds of <br/>
things when they were younger and now they&#39;re &quot;specializing&quot; more and <br/>
more. And, even just a few months ago, I really pushed Rosie to try out <br/>
karate - and she loved it and it is now one of the main activities in <br/>
her life.  If she hadn&#39;t liked it, she&#39;d have tried a few classes and <br/>
then stopped. The karate studio has a 2 weeks free trial period.<br/>
<br/>
But, I am on the lookout for things to share with them - for <br/>
interesting little tidbits of information - for a comic strip or a <br/>
website or a book or movie or tv show that I think they&#39;ll like.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were younger, I did buy a LOT of stuff in which they <br/>
showed absolutely no interest - I made a lot of mistakes. Sometimes, <br/>
later,  one of them discovered something I&#39;d bought years earlier and <br/>
loved it. Don&#39;t give up on providing interesting things and experiences <br/>
because you have only a 70 percent track record - that sounds pretty <br/>
good to me.<br/>
