<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450409103">Hello. I have been lurking for over a month now and I have found the list to be very stimulating.  Before I bring up what I want to talk about I will give you a little background information about me and my family.<br/>
 <br/>
Dh and I will be married for 14 years this May.  We have two ds, Charles (12) and Julian (9), and dd Willow (5) and also a dd on the way (due June 1).  Our children have never been to school.  We have never done &#39;school at home&#39; either, but I have played around with various levels of structure especially in the early years.  However, I kept coming back to the conclusion, the less structure the better.  My real stumbling blocks (in regards to working toward the kind of ideal environment I envisioned) have been computer/video game/TV.  I had a big hang up about those.  After much internal debate, discussions with dh, and going to an unschooler friendly conference, I was right on the edge of letting go completely.  Reading the discussions on this list pushed me over the edge (in a good way).<br/>
 <br/>
While reading the list I also came across references to letting children have complete control over what and when they eat.  Wow.  Scary, yet intriguing.  So I have been thinking about it a lot, and talking to dh, and I read the stuff from Sandra&#39;s site.  I understand the principle, and it certainly makes sense.  So we have been trying it.  But (isn&#39;t there always a big but hanging around?), the practical application of this idea is not simple for me.  I am full of questions and squirming doubts and frustration.<br/>
 <br/>
It seems to me that the principle of giving children control of food is not about expecting them to eventually start eating on their own the way you would choose for them.  Right?  Rather, it is about trusting them and accepting their choices whatever they are.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have some very strong opinions about what is good food and bad food.  I have researched nutrition and drawn on my own experiences to reach these opinions.  Surely I shouldn&#39;t just ignore this background and smile cheerfully when my dd reaches for cookie number six?  Yet I don&#39;t want to nag her or make her feel guilty.  And what about shopping?  How do I decide what to buy?  And then there is supper.  If the kids don&#39;t want to eat what I have planned do I cook them something else?  Something different for each child?  That is a lot of cooking.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess I would like some examples of how this works in different families.  Either I need to commit to this idea whole heartedly and work through my issues or I need to go back to my old comfortable ways (geez that sounds unenlightened!).<br/>
 <br/>
TIA,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have information. They don&#39;t have that same information. Provide <br/>
the information to them, just as you would provide it to DH. Talk <br/>
about how they feel after 102 cookies, 17 Cokes and nothing else for <br/>
a day or two (quantities wildly exaggerated to make the point). For <br/>
example, DS is almost 7. I noticed that if he didn&#39;t get some <br/>
protein in regularly, he&#39;d be more easily frustrated and generally <br/>
uncomfortable inside his own skin. I mentioned to him one day, when <br/>
things were heading in the same direction yet again (but after my <br/>
connecting A to B), &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve noticed you get really frustrated <br/>
when you haven&#39;t had some protein. How about I make you a PBJ?&quot; And <br/>
off we headed to the kitchen - don&#39;t remember whether he had that or <br/>
if I got him some cheese and crackers or what. Point is, I had some <br/>
info that would be useful to him and gave it to him. Now we have a <br/>
list of protein foods on our kitchen wall chalkboard so he has easy <br/>
reference when he wants something. In similar vein, DH is <br/>
hypertensive, so checking sodium quantities and such in foods is <br/>
something we do. DS has been known to check a label and say &quot;Daddy, <br/>
this has too much sodium in it for us&quot; He has also used label info <br/>
to decide that one type of soda is a better choice than another, if <br/>
we&#39;re buying soda at that point. And, sometimes, he chooses <br/>
regardless. Over all, though, he has a very well balanced eating <br/>
pattern.<br/>
<br/>
Alternate meals? We keep simple stuff handy - PBJ is easy <br/>
(especially for kids old enough to handle a spoon to spread with), <br/>
cheese and crackers (a wire cheese slicer is safe for kids to use), <br/>
cooked pasta than can be easily re-heated (or eaten cold as DS will <br/>
sometimes do), pre-sliced, ready to eat fruits and veggies in the <br/>
fridge, etc. We also do lots of mix n match meals - pasta, sauce, <br/>
meatballs, cheeses, all separate to build as each chooses; flour <br/>
tortillas, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, beans/chili, salsa, sour cream <br/>
all separate so each person can build a burriot, taco, wrap to their <br/>
liking (sometimes DS simply wants a pile of cheese with some diced <br/>
tomato on a tortilla wrap-style); rice, stir fried or otherwise <br/>
cooked veggies, meat if any for custom stir fry meals, and so on. <br/>
We&#39;ll also put out the salad/fresh veggies out ahead of time for DS <br/>
to munch while the rest of dinner is on. Sure, he may fill up on <br/>
carrots and tomatoes (the little easy to manage kind) and cucumbers <br/>
and cheese and bell peppers and eat little dinner but hey, I&#39;m not <br/>
complaining.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been limiting/controlling food, go slowly releasing the <br/>
controls. Say yes more but to simply &quot;let loose the hounds&quot; is going <br/>
to probably cause you more stress and confuse the kids - which is <br/>
likely to result in a rebound effect. <br/>
<br/>
Give the kids say in the grocery shopping - DS shops with me (handy <br/>
for getting stuff off low shelves!). They have the usual assortment <br/>
of snack cakes right at the front of the bread and PB aisle. I <br/>
stopped there and asked if he wanted anything. He said Not here, <br/>
where&#39;s the cottage cheese? We also talk, not only about nutrition, <br/>
but about money - we can afford this OR that this week. Which would <br/>
you prefer? We can put the other on the next list (and we do - that <br/>
part is important). He knows he has free range (within budget) to <br/>
choose items and help me choose within some categories (which jams <br/>
should we get?) For a time, he was just in love with a particular <br/>
snack cake. We&#39;d buy one pack per week (snack cakes really run up <br/>
the grocery bill). Then, that exact item went on sale 5 for $5. So <br/>
we stopped at that spot and I told DS go get FIVE of those. He was <br/>
beyond belief happy. If it wasn&#39;t for me brown bagging them and DH <br/>
eating them too, the last couple of boxes would never have been <br/>
touched. My point being, DS knows he can have them when he wants <br/>
pretty much, so he doesn&#39;t need to have them all the time. There&#39;s <br/>
no sense of neediness or the &quot;famine&quot; mentality associated with ANY <br/>
foods for him - he&#39;ll eat bell pepper slices as readily as an Oreo, <br/>
if bell pepper slices are what he&#39;s wanting right then. He&#39;s been <br/>
known to eat an entire canteloupe over the course of a day. <br/>
Waitresses get a kick out of him ordering just a salad and iced tea <br/>
at restaurants, or making sure we order him a spinach dip for <br/>
himself (often that&#39;s his whole meal, eaten with a fork, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like the tortilla chips - some places now do an &quot;Atkins&quot; spinach dip <br/>
platter with fresh veggies that he really likes), or getting &quot;just <br/>
the salad bar&quot; at some places - and eating a good full plate of <br/>
veggies, cheese, diced eggs and ham, and fruit. He dislikes places <br/>
that only have iceberg lettuce in their salads - it has no flavor. <br/>
He&#39;s never been limited deliberately by us - economics, yes; us, no. <br/>
And we get interesting comments from folks when they see him eating <br/>
fresh veggies, vegan chili, fruit, etc. along with cake or cookies <br/>
or whatever. &quot;How did you &#39;get&#39; him to do that?&quot; Simple, we didn&#39;t. <br/>
We just never crimped his internal guidance system.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa - running on here. I&#39;ll stop before it becomes a major novel ;-)</div>

<br/>
Whoa - running on here. I&#39;ll stop before it becomes a major novel &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad you &quot;ran on&quot; as long as you did, because this last idea is such<br/>
a great expression of the idea of no food limits. I feel exactly this way<br/>
about Jayn who has not been food limited in any way. As parents it seems<br/>
that we have so much power to actually do harm, despite the best intentions.<br/>
<br/>
However the question is how to restore the internal guidance system of kids<br/>
who have had it redirected to greater or lesser extents. <br/>
<br/>
I would encourage the original poster to browse the archives. Simplified the<br/>
collated experience/advice includes:<br/>
<br/>
* Just start by saying yes more often.<br/>
<br/>
* Expect a brief period of painful (to Mom) choices while the kids revel in<br/>
their new freedoms. It will pass quicker if it is not &quot;crimped&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
* Your offered knowledge/advice will likely be more accepted after the<br/>
decompression period is past and the kids have learnt to trust that you are<br/>
not trying to manipulate or control them.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, this seems to apply to every area really. <br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest being ready to re-examine the idea of family mealtimes,<br/>
especially if resentments about overwork for Mom are ensuing. Unschooling<br/>
frees each family from cultural expectations of normalcy in many areas, and<br/>
allows us to create our own family traditions. Not everyone sits down at<br/>
table all together every evening. Many Unschoolers apply respecting family<br/>
members&#39; freedom of choice to this practice also. The principle of Inviting<br/>
rather than Expecting applies.<br/>

<br/>
Exaggerations like that just reinforce the idea that anyone WOULD eat nothing <br/>
but cookies and coke for a day or two, but it never ever happens.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
even START to happen.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s l ike saying &quot;Ask them how they feel after they&#39;ve done nothing but play <br/>
video games for three days straight without sleeping or going to the bathroom.<br/>

<br/>
Those things don&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
Adults make the claim and then react to the claim.  It&#39;s a straw man, and the <br/>
children are burned as effigies for a straw man that never existed in reality.<br/>

<br/>
YES, certainly, encourage protein if they&#39;re feeling its lack, but that can <br/>
be done easily and cheerfully and honestly without exaggeration.<br/>
<br/>
Better yet, make him a cool peanut butter and cream cheese sandwich on an <br/>
English muffin and some hot chocolate and tell him you love him without a lecture <br/>
on proteins effect on the brain.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
YES.  <br/>
And when you release a control or rule, go through it in your own mind and <br/>
heart and realize how arbitrary it was.  This will help in other areas, like <br/>
reading, math, how long he can stay out after a movie ends and whether his socks <br/>
need to be folded exactly your way or whether he can experiment.<br/>
<br/>

Holly, same too.<br/>

It was a good novel, except that scary intro with the flaming straw man. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s what we do, and it seems to be working well, but I&#39;ll add the <br/>
caveat that my kids are still very young (almost 5 and 2), so I may <br/>
have to rethink things as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, we plan our dinner menus as a family -- it only takes <br/>
about 15 minutes once a week.  I print out a menu form I made on the <br/>
computer which also has a section to write what I&#39;ll need from the <br/>
grocery store.  Then dh and I sit with the kids and everyone offers <br/>
suggestions as to what they&#39;d like.  It&#39;s easy and fun, and then when <br/>
the meals are being served, the kids get a kick out of eating from the <br/>
menus they&#39;ve helped to create.  It really helps me because while I <br/>
love to cook, I sometimes get in a rut or just feel stumped when it <br/>
comes to thinking of what to make.  Also at this time, everyone makes <br/>
their requests for the week&#39;s groceries.  It makes shopping easier for <br/>
me, because I&#39;m not guessing what people might want, and we have a lot <br/>
less waste, because all items are either wanted or planned for in the <br/>
menu.<br/>
<br/>
Dinner goes really smoothly for us because I don&#39;t make stuff my kids <br/>
don&#39;t like (dh and I will be really happy when their tastes grow to <br/>
include more casseroles and spicier dishes, though, LOL), and if there <br/>
is something on the menu that one person doesn&#39;t like, I know in <br/>
advance to make an alternative, so it doesn&#39;t seem like a pain at the <br/>
time.  For example, dd1 doesn&#39;t like anything mixed together -- she <br/>
used to, but doesn&#39;t right now -- so when everyone else is having beef <br/>
stew, I either saute her meat and steam her vegetables separately <br/>
(which only takes a few minutes), or I make her a hot dog or some <br/>
canned soup and she eats some veggies from the salad.  The kids are <br/>
always happy to came to the table because they know they will not be <br/>
pressured to eat anything -- even if it is their favorite, they always <br/>
have the option of saying &quot;No thanks.&quot;  They are very willing to try <br/>
new things, because they have never been forced to eat something they <br/>
didn&#39;t like.  They are free to leave the table whenever they please, <br/>
but usually they stick around because we are enjoying each others&#39; <br/>
company and their dad has been away at work all day, and they want to <br/>
be where he is.  Now, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a Martha Stewart experience, <br/>
with perfectly groomed little angels eating with perfect manners!  Dd2 <br/>
usually prefers to stand on her chair while eating, Dd1squirts ketchup <br/>
off her plate onto the table more times than not, but our priority is <br/>
having it be an experience they enjoy and look forward to, not a table <br/>
manners critiquing session ;-).<br/>
<br/>
As far as food issues for the rest of the day, pretty much I just make <br/>
them what they want when they want it.  They are both extremely healthy <br/>
kids -- never been to the doctor for any reason other than routine <br/>
check-ups.  Both are in the 75th percentile for weight, and the 95th <br/>
for height.  They are bright, active, and happy.  I have a candy jar <br/>
filled with their favorites, and sometimes weeks will go by without <br/>
them paying it any attention whatsoever.  When they do want some, they <br/>
serve themselves, and they always take about 3 or 4 pieces each, which <br/>
I think is reasonable.  Sometimes they get on a kick, started by one <br/>
and imitated by the other, where they want ice cream for breakfast <br/>
every day for a week or so -- so I give it to them, and then it fades <br/>
away for a few months.  They like the typical kids&#39; foods: hot dogs, <br/>
mac/cheese, grilled cheese, spaghetti; but they also love my homemade <br/>
minestrone, spinach pie, tabbouli, humus, and they eat any separately <br/>
cooked meat or seafood, plus veggies, and then a rice, potato or pasta <br/>
side for dinner that I make.  They are not big breakfast eaters, once <br/>
in a while dd2 will have a scrambled egg.  Their favorite for lunch is <br/>
for me to make them a plate with a bunch of different foods on it -- <br/>
cheese cubes or slices, some sliced meat, little pickles, garbanzo <br/>
beans, olives, cukes or tomatoes, some grapes or other fresh fruit, and <br/>
maybe a cookie.  During the day, they snack on whatever we have <br/>
available -- and here I will admit to stacking the deck pretty severely <br/>
(which I admit I may not be able to continue to do when they are older) <br/>
-- I do not buy processed foods like ChipsAhoy cookies, or even the <br/>
organic ones.  I bake all of our bread, make all of our cookies, cakes, <br/>
etc. from good quality, whole grain (where possible) ingredients.  The <br/>
kids like to bake so much that we do it at least twice a week, so we <br/>
really have no need for store-bought cookies, etc.  I always keep lots <br/>
of fruit and veggies that I know they like in the fridge -- my kids <br/>
would rather eat raw green beans than potato chips any day,  but, if we <br/>
happen to have chips, I don&#39;t restrict them.  They also, for some <br/>
reason, love frozen corn and frozen peas.  Oh, and of course, frozen <br/>
blueberries are a staple for us.  For the stuff that still gives me the <br/>
willies (hot dogs and mac and cheese from a box), I buy the best <br/>
quality I can find (the natural casing hot dogs from the deli, and <br/>
Annie&#39;s organic mac and cheese) and just let go whatever reservations I <br/>
may have about them -- I feel so good about the rest of their diet, I <br/>
can afford to relax about some stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this got so long, hope it was helpful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Anne Ohman asks herself in conflicting situations like this &quot;Who&#39;s <br/>
gonna die?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter is standing in front of a speeding Mack truck is she <br/>
gonna die? Very likely! It&#39;s best to grab her out of the way!<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter eats cookie number 6 will she die? No, and she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to be rescued from cookie number 6.<br/>
<br/>
Will she eat 6 cookies everyday? Very unlikely. But one way you could <br/>
&quot;help&quot; her eat 6 cookies a day is by sending the message that 5 is a <br/>
limit she shouldn&#39;t cross.<br/>
<br/>
I read anywhere from 0 words to 4 pages a day of whatever book is <br/>
currently in the bathroom. If someone told me I must not read more than <br/>
2 pages a day it would be really hard not to read *at least* 2 pages <br/>
and I&#39;d want to sneak more. By setting a limit of 5 cookies it makes it <br/>
more difficult to choose no cookies when cookies are available.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about limits imposed by others is it makes the limited thing <br/>
more attractive. It&#39;s easy to pass a door marked Janitorial Supplies <br/>
without feeling the need to open it and see what&#39;s there. But a door <br/>
that&#39;s marked &quot;NO ADMITTANCE. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. DO NOT ENTER&quot; <br/>
just begs to be opened ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have researched nutrition and drawn on my own experiences to reach <br/>
&gt; these opinions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if your husband started reading extensively about food and came to <br/>
different conclusions about what was healthy? What if you could feel <br/>
his eyes on you as you made choices about what to eat and you knew he <br/>
was judging you by his standards? What if he gave you a running <br/>
commentary on what was good to eat as you were about to bite into <br/>
something to &quot;help&quot; you eat better? How would you feel about him and <br/>
about his food beliefs?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really irritating living with experts who know how we should live <br/>
better than we do ;-)<br/>
<br/>
What we model and the choices we make for ourselves is far more likely <br/>
to pass onto our kids than us micromanaging the choices they make.<br/>
<br/>
Make nutritious meals and snacks. Have nutritious food on hand. Make <br/>
nutritious choices for yourself. When a question comes up tell her why <br/>
you&#39;re making a particular choice for yourself. But let her make her <br/>
own choices. If she wants a specific something from the store, put it <br/>
on the list. if she wants to try some new fun snacky food, get it for <br/>
her. She will learn far more about the world by having the freedom to <br/>
experiment than she will by memorizing what you say is true.<br/>
<br/>
If we say &quot;This is what I believe,&quot; it gives us room to be wrong. If we <br/>
say &quot;This is what is right,&quot; our credibility goes down if we&#39;re wrong! <br/>
;-)  And our kids are less likely to trust the next so called truth <br/>
from us. And since the &quot;truth&quot; about nutrition seems to change yearly, <br/>
getting too specific about what&#39;s right and wrong to eat is putting <br/>

My dd was a cookie monster. So much so my youngest son thought the cookie jar was actually her name cos everytime her hand was in it we all said &quot;Sarah!!!&quot; The more restrictions she got the more cookies she wanted.  In the end I left the choice to her to have as many as she wanted and for several weeks she did this and then got tired of eating them all day long and now only eats them ( one or two not a whole batch lol)if she has baked them. I bought her cookie cutters and receipe books from e bay and printed them off the internet and she has turned her cookie love into a little hobby and sells the cookies to her friends, on a stall each year and gives them wrapped as gifts.<br/>

Brenna and Logan just told me about how they were &quot;gently&quot; making fun of my  <br/>

He and I have been on this eating and exercise plan for a few  weeks and have <br/>
been trying to be supportive and encouraging of each  other.  I guess they <br/>
heard our conversation where we were talking about  what we had eaten.  Me...&quot;I <br/>
did a little better with more fruits and  vegetables today.&quot;  Broc...&quot;I had <br/>
some vegetables....green chili in that  soup we had for dinner.&quot;  Me...&quot;Green <br/>

about food controls for a  couple of years and then saying something like that to <br/>
my husband!!<br/>
We were just kidding but they certainly picked up on it.<br/>
 <br/>
The kids had a good laugh about it.  I think we amuse them more and  more as <br/>
time goes on.  They think we are both quite strange but seem  to love us <br/>
anyway.<br/>

It sounds like you have some other circumstances in your family because of<br/>
medical concerns.  In my family, my children aren&#39;t going to end up in the<br/>
hospital for making their own food choices.  Still, my kids can only choose<br/>
from what we have.  I do buy things they like and want but sometimes we run<br/>
out and no one wants to go to the store to replace it.  So, they choose from<br/>
what we have readily available.  Closer to grocery day, we have more fresh<br/>
fruits and veggies because those get eaten first.  As the week goes on,<br/>
there is less to choose from, but still enough variety that they can choose.<br/>
It&#39;s not always what I would pick, but it does round out over several days,<br/>
generally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000496973">I would love to have a house that everyone could eat what everyone <br/>
else could eat.  :::sigh:::  My 2 yr old has to have a balance of <br/>
sugar and salt.  It&#39;s not a problem usually if we are not eating <br/>
snacks because I never salt anything but when it comes to salty and <br/>
sweet we have a hard time.  If only I could fill my house with <br/>
chocolate covered pretzels.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Then we have my son.  Fresh fruits, juices, dairy, and whole grains <br/>
are his trouble, mainly.(so everything I would want the children to <br/>
eat)  Because of his intestinal disorder he can get impacted or go <br/>
to the opposite end of the spectrum and have watery stools very <br/>
easily by not eating a good balance.  Baically he can&#39;t have his <br/>
favorites all the time; chocolate milk, pineapple, mandarin oranges, <br/>
cheese.  He&#39;s also alergic to crustations.  Found that out because <br/>
his (most) favorite food in the entire world is crab legs.  Every <br/>
once in a while we let him have some because it is a mild reaction, <br/>
so far.  I have to make sure to monitor him though.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s because of these restrictions that it would make it very hard <br/>
to only have food choices in the house that would be good for all.  <br/>
It&#39;s not too hard because I just let them have what they want <br/>
mostly, but put limits on it.  That way they are not deprived, but <br/>
don&#39;t go overboard anymore.<br/>

letting them choose to mean hands off.<br/>
<br/>
No, many 2 yos won&#39;t understand why something the like is dangerous to <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d liken the situation to a child wanting to run in a parking lot. You <br/>
don&#39;t just let them run. You find ways that will help them hold your <br/>
hand or  hold onto something. Promising a trip to the park soon so they <br/>
have a safe place to run. Or you avoid parking lots as  much as you can <br/>
until they can understand.<br/>
<br/>
When there is imminent danger kids do want us to protect them. They may <br/>
want something else too, like running in the parking lot and it&#39;s up to <br/>
us to do the best we can to help them get what they want safely. In the <br/>
case of allergies it can be trying out substitute foods, not having the <br/>
tempting foods in the house, not taking them grocery shopping (or <br/>
having Dad do the aisle with the problematic foods).<br/>
<br/>
The problem with explaining &quot;letting them choose&quot; in general ways is <br/>
that many parents are convinced of the imminent danger of TV, violence, <br/>
video games, artificial additives, meat and so on and feel they need to <br/>
protect their children from those things.<br/>
<br/>
But kids don&#39;t end up in the hospital from glancing at a TV. They can <br/>
from Mack trucks and eating things they&#39;re allergic to and cliffs and <br/>
parking lots.<br/>

<br/>
It sounds like a good opportunity to help them figure out how much is too <br/>
much, and what needs to be added to make up for having had a favorite.  If <br/>
someone&#39;s eating a lot of meat and cheese, they might really NEED lettuce or oranges <br/>
or raisens or plums or apples to balance that.  ANYone.  That&#39;s not a <br/>
disorder, to need a variety and a balance of foods.<br/>

<br/>
If the want something and a limit has been put on it, how is that &quot;not <br/>
deprived&quot;?<br/>
I&#39;m just being picky because it helps a lot for moms to be really clear in <br/>
their reasons and their thinking even at home in private.  And on the list, it <br/>
helps for writers to be really clear to say what they meant to say.<br/>
<br/>
-=-That way they are not deprived, but don&#39;t go overboard anymore.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why did they &quot;go overboard&quot; before?<br/>
Were they fresh from limits and they gorged and frolicked when the limits <br/>
were lifted? <br/>
Were they eating on their own without you making food for them or helping <br/>
them get good ideas about balance?<br/>
<br/>
My kids have never &quot;gone overboard&quot; and so I&#39;m curious as to what might cause <br/>
it in kids who have.<br/>
<br/>
If kids have a life-threatening condition and have to have their foods <br/>
specially measured, prepared, or whatever, that&#39;s completely understandable and it&#39;s <br/>
an exception to the ideas being presented here.   People often write here <br/>
about music and movies and really looking at things.  Of course, if someone has a <br/>
child who&#39;s blind or deaf, those suggestions won&#39;t work (though the <br/>
principles behind them would, which is give them access to as much input as you can, <br/>
because the&#39;ll learn from all of it and make their own connections).<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby could only eat liquid food when they had their wisdom teeth <br/>
out a week and a half ago.  They were on liquid-to-soft food for DAYS, and I <br/>
helped make sure they had a balance so it wasn&#39;t all milk-based, and there was <br/>
protein, and juice.  I never made them eat anything, I didn&#39;t prevent anything. <br/>
 I helped them feel comfortable and get nourishment.  It was an exceptional <br/>
time, and I was their partner.<br/>

more clear, and in light of the fact that your writing isn&#39;t likely to help  <br/>
others understand unschooling, I&#39;d like to ask (as a moderator and one of the  <br/>
list owners) that you refrain altogether from posting UNTIL you get time to  <br/>
write clearly and with the list-posting guidelines in mind, then.<br/>
 <br/>
If you don&#39;t have time to write clearly, don&#39;t write. <br/>
If you do write, don&#39;t post it to 1600 people.<br/>
 <br/>
-=--=-Sorry, I attend college full time and work outside the home as well  <br/>
as have an at home business and run a homeschooling group.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
have time to be any more clear.  It&#39;s all I can do to get my house  <br/>
clean and try and try to get a bit of down time for myself.-=--=-<br/>
 <br/>
You didn&#39;t mention your children in that.<br/>
Maybe you should spend more time with your children.<br/>

How can you *know* how much water he needs in a day?  Many foods contain a large amount of water but we don&#39;t notice because they appear solid.<br/>

If your daughter is standing in front of a speeding Mack truck is she <br/>

<br/>
If your daughter eats cookie number 6 will she die? No, and she doesn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
That certainlly puts things in perspective. :)<br/>

&quot;help&quot; her eat 6 cookies a day is by sending the message that 5 is a <br/>
limit she shouldn&#39;t cross.--<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snipped a lot of good stuff about setting limits&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I see what you mean. My concern, however, is not weather or not to set limits. It is about if I should talk to her about what I have researched and observed about nutrition. I realize that it would be easy to fall into the trap of &quot;sending messages&quot; about what she should or shouldn&#39;t eat and therefore hamper any actual freedom. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have researched nutrition and drawn on my own experiences to reach <br/>
&gt; these opinions.<br/>
<br/>
--What if your husband started reading extensively about food and came to <br/>
different conclusions about what was healthy? What if you could feel <br/>
his eyes on you as you made choices about what to eat and you knew he <br/>
was judging you by his standards? What if he gave you a running <br/>
commentary on what was good to eat as you were about to bite into <br/>
something to &quot;help&quot; you eat better? How would you feel about him and <br/>
about his food beliefs?--<br/>
<br/>
Actually my husband has done something similar to this and I didn&#39;t like it at all. I definitely want to avoid this with my children.<br/>
<br/>
--It&#39;s really irritating living with experts who know how we should live <br/>
better than we do ;-)<br/>
<br/>
What we model and the choices we make for ourselves is far more likely <br/>
to pass onto our kids than us micromanaging the choices they make.<br/>
<br/>
Make nutritious meals and snacks. Have nutritious food on hand. Make <br/>
nutritious choices for yourself. When a question comes up tell her why <br/>
you&#39;re making a particular choice for yourself. But let her make her <br/>
own choices. If she wants a specific something from the store, put it <br/>
on the list. if she wants to try some new fun snacky food, get it for <br/>
her. She will learn far more about the world by having the freedom to <br/>
experiment than she will by memorizing what you say is true.<br/>
<br/>
If we say &quot;This is what I believe,&quot; it gives us room to be wrong. If we <br/>
say &quot;This is what is right,&quot; our credibility goes down if we&#39;re wrong! <br/>
;-)  And our kids are less likely to trust the next so called truth <br/>
from us. And since the &quot;truth&quot; about nutrition seems to change yearly, <br/>
getting too specific about what&#39;s right and wrong to eat is putting <br/>
your credibility on borrowed time ;-)--<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree with what you are saying about credibility. I do try to always be aware that what seems to be &quot;true&quot; today may turn out to be way off base.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what it comes down to is this; share what I believe about nutrition when she brings it up - not when I think she needs the benefit of my &#39;superior wisdom&#39;.<br/>

He found no scientific studies in support of 8 x 8. Rather, surveys of fluid  <br/>
intake on healthy adults of both genders, published as peer-reviewed <br/>
documents,  strongly suggest that such large amounts are not needed. His conclusion is <br/>
 supported by published studies showing that caffeinated drinks, such as most <br/>
 coffee, tea and soft drinks, may indeed be counted toward the daily total. <br/>
He  also points to the quantity of published experiments that attest to the  <br/>
capability of the human body for maintaining proper water balance.  &lt;&lt;<br/>

SEE how important words are?<br/>
Even just the words we use in our own thoughts can change our attitude and  <br/>
biochemistry when we&#39;re thinking about what we&#39;re doing and why we&#39;re doing  it.<br/>
 <br/>
You want to think about ways to enrich your children, ways to enable them  to <br/>
be their best and their happiest selves.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you think of it is catering to or indulging or bowing down to or  spoiling <br/>
or being a servant of a short-order cook or a doormat or a martyr, in  the <br/>
space of SECONDS you can feel like crap and not being too happy with your  <br/>
choices.<br/>
 <br/>
If you see it as opening the world up as a giant gift for them and  <br/>
maintaining and ensuring and providing and amusing and facilitating, then in the  same <br/>
few seconds you can feel BIG and wonderful and invaluable.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a word from the Simpsons you can use when you think of your own  <br/>
attitude and of what you&#39;re doing for your children:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;embiggen&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
You are embiggening them, and that will embiggen you.<br/>
 <br/>
I went to look for the dialog to cut and paste, and didn&#39;t find it but I  did <br/>
find that in Minneapollis there&#39;s a Shakespeare troupe called The Cromulent  <br/>
Shakespeare Company,and their motto is &quot;Embiggen the Bard.&quot;<br/>

 From what you&#39;ve written it sounds like you&#39;ve gotten into a power <br/>
struggle with each other. It&#39;s no longer about food choice but about <br/>
being able to choose. You&#39;re seeing him testing his limits and making <br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; choices so you cut off his ability to choose. And he&#39;s saying <br/>
&quot;By Gosh, by golly I&#39;m going to fight for the right to be able to make <br/>
my own choices even if it&#39;s a really lousy choice I&#39;m fighting for!&quot;<br/>

you&#39;re around and when you aren&#39;t he&#39;ll sneak and make the choices you <br/>
