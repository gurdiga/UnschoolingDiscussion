&gt; Ethan decided to strip naked, including his dirty diaper, in the play-gym<br/>

&gt; people.  I&#39;m trying to pack, find a house, give my husband directions in<br/>
&gt; Columbia, SC while being in Texas and not seeing all the streets he&#39;s<br/>

 </span></blockquote>blessed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we truly are!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While cleaning out the laundry room cabinets (the equivilant of most<br/>
&gt; peoples&#39; &#39;junk drawers&#39; only 80 times as big) I found newborn pictures of<br/>
&gt; Chloe and the cutest picture of all the kids on hands and knees crawling<br/>
&gt; away from the camera in a long side-by-side line.  I hung my gift from<br/>
&gt; Laurie on the fridge to help me smile while going about my dreary business<br/>
&gt; at hand.  Instead of packing away the pictures of Chloe and the kids, I<br/>
&gt; grabbed a coke and took a break to remember the joy and peace of her birth<br/>
&gt; and what a fun day we had that day.  When I came in the house, Ethan was<br/>
&gt; sitting in the kitchen floor with empty cupcake papers and the salt and<br/>
&gt; pepper, making &#39;birthday cakes&#39;.  I had just mopped the kitchen floor.  I<br/>
&gt; just wanted to scream and cry.  Instead, I grabbed him and carried him off<br/>
&gt; to bed.  I sang him a soft song and rubbed his beautiful face until he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fell<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; asleep.  For an hour, I went from room to room, carressing my sleeping<br/>
&gt; little angels.  Little by little my patience returned.  A wave of peace<br/>
&gt; washed over me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our sheets still haven&#39;t made it into the washer.  The house is still a<br/>
&gt; mess.  But my kids are all sleeping peacefully.  I have a beautful picture<br/>
&gt; hanging on my fridge that no professional artist nor writer could ever<br/>
&gt; compare with.   There are no alarm clocks set, no homework due.  When the<br/>
&gt; kids wake up their Daddy will be home and they will scream with joy to see<br/>
&gt; him again.  And they will have all day to be with him and catch up on the<br/>
&gt; latest lost tooth, the birthday party he missed and tell him all the new<br/>
&gt; words they learned to spell.  He&#39;ll get to hear Chloe say Dada for the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we have precious little time to savor with him.  I am thankful they are<br/>
&gt; home, were they belong, for if they were in school, they would miss these<br/>
&gt; beautiful moments.<br/>

&gt; makes us better people.  We are changing the world, not just for our<br/>
&gt; children but by them and through them.  Every life they touch is a<br/>

&gt; I wish I could offer you a cup overflowing with patience, but I haven&#39;t<br/>

&gt; Do I ever understand!! My kids are the same age and my 2 yo is my<br/>
&gt; challange.  I have realized alot since joining the list and have made<br/>
&gt; a few changes that have helped me.  He has a heck of a temper and<br/>
&gt; when he is mad he starts throwing his body around, throwing things of<br/>
&gt; tables, will NOT let you hold or console him and usually ends up<br/>
&gt; getting hurt in the process &lt;sigh&gt;.  I have made a huge effort lately<br/>
&gt; to really pay attention to his cues so things do not escalate and<br/>
&gt; that is helping alot.  I am also much more flexible with his<br/>
&gt; demands.  The other day he wanted juice, so I got a juice, still<br/>
&gt; moaning.  DO you want milk? okay, than a change of mind.  After a few<br/>
&gt; minutes of struggle he wanted a regular cup with ice tea like a big<br/>
&gt; boy..LOL!  Of course he spilled it a minute later..LOL!  I never<br/>
&gt; would have continued to figure out the problem in the past.  It took<br/>
&gt; less time then one of his tantrums and left an overall feeling of<br/>
&gt; peace.  Anyway, we still have some really difficult moments and I<br/>
&gt; feel tears come because I don&#39;t feel I handled it in the best way.<br/>
&gt; At least our consciousness of the problem and desire to change are a<br/>
&gt; step in the right direction!!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been lurking for about a month now and enjoy the list, though<br/>
&gt; occationally do mass deletes to catch up.  That is the reason for my<br/>
&gt; lack of posting.  I feel like I should be reading everything to make<br/>
&gt; an informed decision before putting my 2 bits out there, but just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t always find the time to get through them all.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m mom to a 5 year old and have intended not to send her to school<br/>
&gt; nor do school at home sense she was about 2 and I discovered<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  I first discovered Taking Children Seriously, which,<br/>
&gt; while I think it&#39;s a nice ideal, I have some trouble with it.  My<br/>
&gt; problem is if I&#39;m not meeting an ideal, I feel like a failure.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I try my best to be respectful and thoughful toward Davan and<br/>
&gt; try not to beat myself up too much.  Where I was trying to go with<br/>
&gt; that was to say, it lead me toward unschooling, which is something I<br/>
&gt; can work with and is a great way of life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have to say, though, that lately I&#39;ve been feeling like I am not<br/>
&gt; patient and creative enough with problem solving with Davan.  We<br/>
&gt; ended up having quite a bad seance at a store today.  I think Davan<br/>
&gt; was hungry, which led to some of the difficulties, but it gets me so<br/>
&gt; down when she ends up crying and angry and I end up angry and not the<br/>
&gt; nicest of people in return.  Do any of you ever feel like you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have enough patience for this job?  Sometimes I wonder about<br/>
&gt; myself....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, here I am, and I imagine that now I&#39;ve broken the ice with my<br/>
&gt; first post, there will be more to follow.  :)<br/>

&gt; I wanted to share the weekend we had because it&#39;s just so cool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was a busy weekend. Julian, who is 13, has been preparing to sign with<br/>

 </span></blockquote>was<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other thing that happened this weekend was we had Children&#39;s Sunday at<br/>
&gt; the Unitarian Universalist church where I am the Director of Religious<br/>
&gt; Education. I do Children&#39;s Sunday a bit differently than a lot of<br/>
&gt; churches...it tends to be mostly adult-driven, with the kids doing<br/>

&gt; and sang it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Do you know if the digests count as the same amount of space as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; individual emails?  My ds-6 with medical disabilities is often<br/>
&gt; &gt; hospitalized suddenly, and it can be days before I check my email.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My mailbox has been shut down twice because of excessive mail, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m afraid of tempting fate with a third event.  Consequently, I read<br/>
&gt; &gt; the mail at the website...it&#39;s inconvenient, but I&#39;ve been able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep my mailbox from self-destructing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have no idea what your service provider would think of this, but can you<br/>
&gt; get a second email box for little or no money?  Then you could subscribe<br/>
