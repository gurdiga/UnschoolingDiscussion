&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi. I suspect you found my column on the Web, where it might <br/>
have been taken a little bit out of context -- it&#39;s not an op-ed but <br/>
rather a humor column, and my regular readers know that my <br/>
simplistic take on topics is part of the joke. (The theme is sort <br/>
of, &quot;The world from the perspective of a goofball.&quot;) What you&#39;re <br/>
doing sounds really interesting and I look forward to examining it <br/>
further. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-937981772">my problem with his response is that it is an attempt to throw off<br/>
responsibility for his words by saying &quot;even though thousands of people read<br/>
it and I never disavowed the opinions expressed therein, I&#39;m trying to be<br/>
funny, so you can&#39;t be offended&quot;.  Of course, he&#39;s trying to be funny AT THE<br/>
EXPENSE of unschooling.  This is no more an excuse than it would be if he<br/>
were making fun of a racial group or a religion.<br/>

He&#39;s not &quot;trying to be funny,&quot; he&#39;s professionally paid to be funny,  <br/>
it seems.<br/>

Freedom of the press.<br/>
Making a big deal out of it lacks realism and graciousness.<br/>

What we do *IS* funny, compared to school.<br/>
