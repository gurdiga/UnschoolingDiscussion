<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508152650">Is anyone here from Nebraska, New Mexico, Alaska or Rhode Island?  My <br/>
children are doing state studies and we&#39;ve covered those states so far.  I <br/>
thought it would be cool for them to get postcards from those states we have <br/>
studied.  If you are, or you know someone who is and would be willing to send <br/>
a postcard, please let me know and I&#39;ll send you our mailing address.  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
I live about 15 minutes from the Rhode Island border and could get you a<br/>
postcard to mail from that state. Let me know if that will do.<br/>
