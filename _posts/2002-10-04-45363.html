<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865392344"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Jude, Can you help me and possibly others if they are interested in menu<br/>

&gt; enough Calcium for their growing bones and they bruise easy like me or is<br/>
&gt; that just a kid thing? Amy<br/>

<br/>
Are you looking for menu ideas or help balancing a basic meal?  My son (6<br/>
years) is a vegetarian, and I use the food pyramid, loosely.  We think of<br/>
proteins heavily in terms of beans, cheese/milk products, tofu, TVP, peanut<br/>
butter and such, and just ignore the meat.  We&#39;ve learned that no matter how<br/>
much starch and veggies my son eats, he&#39;s hungry in an hour if I don&#39;t load<br/>
some protein into him along with it.<br/>
<br/>
Have you searched calcium on Goggle?  There are a LOT of foods with calcium<br/>
in them, including some you probably eat every day and never think of as<br/>
having calcium.  I was worried about iron, but as my new (and much better!)<br/>
doctor pointed out, it&#39;s not like my 6 year old son is a menstruating<br/>
female, and they&#39;re generally the ones that have iron deficiency problems!<br/>
<br/>
I bruise easily, and so does my son.  I eat meat, he doesn&#39;t.  If you have<br/>
one child that bruises particularly easily or badly, perhaps it&#39;s something<br/>
to run by the doctor sometime.  But if you all bruise easily, maybe you have<br/>
fair skin and it just shows bruises more.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for recipes that help you plan meals, drop me a line off<br/>
the list and I&#39;ll see if I can help.  I had a number of vegetarian recipes<br/>
before my son became a vegetarian, but I have lots more now.  It&#39;s been fun<br/>
to search out new recipes.<br/>
