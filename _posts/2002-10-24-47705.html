think you are a young and a bit overwhelmed by having three kids by age, is it<br/>
25 or less? I&#39;ve had plenty of friends like you in the past. Just getting by<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m veering off topic a little bit, but I had to respond to this as a &quot;young&quot; mother myself.  Yes, some people are overwhelmed by having three kids in a short time period, but I don&#39;t think age has anything to do with it.  I&#39;ve known young mothers who handled it well and older mothers who didn&#39;t and vice versa. <br/>
 <br/>
And having our own issues to work through before we can adequately see our kids&#39; issues for what they are can be a problem at *any* age... in fact I think that sometimes it&#39;s *having* kids, regardless of our age at the time of their birth, that prompts of to confront our own childhood issues.  And this can happen whether you have kids at 20 or 40.  So perhaps what you&#39;ve said above about Myranda is true, but I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with her age.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually been told that the reason I parent my kids the way I do (unschooling and striving for mutual respect) is that I&#39;m just &quot;young&quot; and &quot;idealistic.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Patti, yes, I have met young moms who had their sense of self and needs filled<br/>
enough to give full emotional support to young children. So, I apologize for<br/>
the generalization. And, I too have met older moms who had aged but not grown<br/>
in emotional strength. I think that finding that balance takes some time in a<br/>
person&#39;s life and in our culture many of the young people, because their needs<br/>
are usually NOT respected, tend to go though years of reacting against what<br/>
happened to them when young rather before moving on and developing the degree<br/>
of emotional health and intelligence that a child needs from a parent. I think<br/>
so many of them are young because it takes time, support, and awareness to<br/>
work though the earlier issues and having kids young can put that growth on<br/>
hold.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Kelli,<br/>
 I *do* understand what is being said, I just don&#39;t agree with it all. A lot <br/>
of it goes into things I really don&#39;t want to discuss on a list of people <br/>
that I don&#39;t know well. Yes, I&#39;ve found that my idea of unschooling is <br/>
different from most posters here. I see unschooling as an educational choice, <br/>
nothing more or less. All of this other about it being a way of parenting, I <br/>
don&#39;t agree with. Sure, most unschoolers choose to respect their children, to <br/>
give them freedom of choice in all areas, to put their rights above all else, <br/>
but to me those are parenting choices, not unschooling choices.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So can you see why we are saying &quot;that&#39;s not respectful to children&quot; and you <br/>
aren&#39;t getting it?<br/>
And why it seems ludicrous when you say that you only hang out with, and are <br/>
around people that are respectful to children when most parents are NOT.<br/>
Your definition of respect is not one that is accepted by most members at <br/>
this list.<br/>
And therein lies the crux of the problem I think.<br/>
Maybe you ought to get the feel of the views here before trying to convince <br/>
other people that your views are just as valid.<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;ve been living on your own since you were 15 Myranda?<br/>
I think your life has been rougher than you want to admit, and by comparison <br/>
your home is respectful of children.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean you couldn&#39;t do a whole lot of thinking and changing and <br/>
try to understand the DEEP level of respect that is being discussed here.<br/>

<br/>
Or, as in my case, having children young can accelerate one&#39;s emotional growth.  I think it&#39;s easy prior to having children to keep one&#39;s emotional baggage comfortably swept under the carpet, but not so easy after!  In my experience anyway...<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m 39, and every day I learn something new about myself and about my<br/>
son.  <br/>
My son is like one of his beautiful paintings.   He works on them for a<br/>
few weeks and everyday they change and become something different.   At<br/>
age ten he might be like day three of his painting, beautiful, complex,<br/>
mysterious, funny, with no hint at what the next day will bring.   If I<br/>
can go to bed at night and say, ok, I got it right today,  that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean I can expect the same thing in the morning.  Because my son will be<br/>
a different boy tomorrow.  He&#39;ll have learned new things and thought new<br/>
thoughts and I will have to catch up with him all over again.   He&#39;s such<br/>
a perfect learning person he makes me want to get it perfect too.  I<br/>
never will, but I&#39;ll wake up everyday ready to try.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; . Those are the kinds of things I&#39;m looking for here, not parenting advice <br/>
that I&#39;ve already heard and either accepted or rejected years ago.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re on the wrong list Myranda.<br/>
This is primarily a discussion list. Not an ideas list. The ideas get shared <br/>
and come along as a natural flow to the discussion....but this list is a <br/>
discussion list specifically about unschooling. Unschooling and how it <br/>
relates to parenting.<br/>
If you want cool projects and fun ideas, there are better places.<br/>
If you&#39;ve got the whole parenting thing so figured out, this isn&#39;t the place <br/>
for you.<br/>
It&#39;s strange to me, cuz I talk to people here in their 30&#39;s, 40&#39;s, 50&#39;s and <br/>
sometimes beyond, that don&#39;t claim to have it all figured out. People with <br/>
teens (have you ever raised a teen?) people that have VAST quantities of <br/>
experience and time being gentle parents and I hugely value their input.<br/>
If you are already a perfect parent, why oh why disrupt this list?<br/>

<br/>
I was excited to hear this. I have yet to actually get to  really talk to<br/>
folks with experience in gentle discipline.<br/>
  I don&#39;t mean to seem like a dunce here but I would love to pick<br/>
&quot;brains&quot; and get insights. I am new and the posts have been moving so<br/>
quickly. I am not sure where to start in asking my questions or if I even<br/>
know yet what to ask. <br/>
 The best I have gotten was LLL when my oldest was young and I met a<br/>
couple of moms that had children older than mine that seemed so calm.<br/>
When I went to talk to them for ideas I was told that LLL stand was no<br/>
spanking but their personal stand was they did occassionally because they<br/>
felt no spanking  had not worked.  for their family.<br/>
  I thought that this list was strictly unschooling but one poster shared<br/>
that there was more to it.<br/>
We have 4 children 15,14,7,&5....I am still learning and while I feel<br/>
like I have learned some things (from experience) a new day dawns and I<br/>
start all over.<br/>
  Are there moms here that have never spanked and had great results? And<br/>
moms that started out spanking and stopped by  learning better ways? If<br/>
so what did you read or do to get to that point? <br/>
  In groups at homeschool meetings I have heard conversations about<br/>
someone in the group not spanking. The gist of it was &quot;oh,they don&#39;t<br/>
spank...you can see that it doesn&#39;t worklook how ill behaved the child<br/>
is.&quot;<br/>
  I sense from this list that there are parents that are misunderstanding<br/>
not spanking like they misunderstand unschooling. It is not doing nothing<br/>
but learning what to do when? Like Sandra has shared lots of ways to give<br/>
choices or to (for lack of a better word *please forgive the wording*)<br/>
train children without harshness.<br/>
Parents go through difficulties with behaviour whether they spank or<br/>
not...is it because some parents do nothing that brings about the<br/>
negative feedback? Or people just don&#39;t feel that it can be done gently? <br/>
  I hope to learn more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682564466">***Are there moms here that have never spanked and had great results?***<br/>
<br/>
My son is ten and we didn&#39;t spank.  We started out knowing we wouldn&#39;t<br/>
spank, and we had to listen to a lot of people tell us how naive we were,<br/>
how wrong we were, how sorry we&#39;d be, etc.  We weren&#39;t naive or wrong and<br/>
we&#39;ve never been sorry.<br/>
<br/>
What I came to understand is there was always a reason my son did what he<br/>
did.  If it was something I wasn&#39;t happy about there was still a reason<br/>
for it.  In every case I can remember, when he did something I wasn&#39;t<br/>
happy about he was reacting to the way I was parenting.   What I learned<br/>
was to respond to him quickly when he was upset, tired, hungry, lonely. <br/>
And if I did my job well he was a very cooperative and happy person. <br/>
Never, ever once can I remember feeling like the decision to not spank<br/>
was wrong. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a nice, well adjusted boy who gets along with others and is happy<br/>
and confident.  He&#39;s never been hit by anyone (outside of sparring in<br/>
Karate and Tae Kwon Do) and he&#39;s never hit any one.  <br/>
He is even credited as the reason one of our friends stopped spanking her<br/>
kids.  He was five at the time and her kids were five and seven.<br/>

 so what did you read or do to get to that point?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to. I don&#39;t now. I have had a couple slip ups where I did the &quot;light <br/>
swat&quot; crap.....didn&#39;t like myself much after the fact.<br/>
The truth is, I am impatient by nature (or maybe by the way I was raised, who <br/>
knows) I get stressed when too many distractions start at me and that&#39;s when <br/>
I tend to lose my temper. Although lately, losing my temper means speaking in <br/>
a very stern voice, but not anything worse.  No, I take that back. The worst <br/>
thing I do, and I seem to have a hard time with this one, is the guilt thing.<br/>
Not over stuff the kids do wrong, or breaking things or stuff like that. But <br/>
about not helping me. I will do the &quot;I feel so used you  guys, you expect me <br/>
to run around cleaning up after you all day while you goof off&quot;<br/>
Sheesh. You&#39;d think that would have done a silent death by now.<br/>
The struggles of being a mindful parent constantly present themselves, and <br/>
yet, the struggle is not overwhelming, nor is it a bad thing. It&#39;s just what <br/>
it is.<br/>
A person trying to change ingrained behavior. Never easy, but certainly <br/>
satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
How I got to this point? <br/>
Reading, reading and reading some more. Meeting real people that believe the <br/>
same way and don&#39;t think you&#39;re nutso. Having family that is very supportive <br/>
about not spanking (really cool) and my online support network.<br/>
Unschooling.com literally changed my life. Changed the way I parent forever.<br/>
I never see a need to spank, I do see that it only damages.<br/>
I know people that never, ever spanked and had wonderful results.<br/>
Not spanking is only one facet of being a good parent though....there is so <br/>
much more to it.<br/>
It&#39;s like people that are vegetarian, but eat candy bars, loads of cheese <br/>
etc....and then they&#39;re overweight and people point at them and say &quot;see, <br/>
being a vegetarian doesn&#39;t work&quot;.<br/>
That&#39;s what the non spanking parents that have totally out of control, <br/>
dysfunctional families do for other non spankers. <br/>
Make people say &quot;Oooh, look, you better spank, that doesn&#39;t work&quot; without <br/>
looking at the entire picture or all of the parenting skills (or lack <br/>
thereof) that are being called into play.<br/>
Not spanking is one part of it. Being available, being involved, being <br/>
interested in your children&#39;s interests, seeing them as worthy, intelligent, <br/>
capable human beings, trusting them, not being coercive, dialoguing and <br/>
modeling decent behavior, stopping harmful behavior (not being coercive does <br/>
not mean allowing another human to be hurt at the hands of my child) and <br/>
caring about every aspect of their lives and happiness.<br/>
These are all things that tie into unschooling and not spanking for me.<br/>
There are parents that don&#39;t spank but are still really rotten parents <br/>
(although not nearly as common).<br/>
<br/>
Another helpful thing for me was taking some positive parenting courses, <br/>
including Stephen Glenn&#39;s nine week course titled after his book &quot;Raising <br/>
Self Reliant Children in a Self Indulgent World&quot;.<br/>
Sandra Dodd and Richard Pytowski&#39;s talk at the California Homeschooling <br/>
conference is available on tape, and I highly recommend it.<br/>
Daily meditation helps hugely.<br/>
I have many inspirational books that help me focus and I try to read <br/>
something every day to remind me of what is important right now, today.<br/>

okay like not overnight, had such a comfort with myself that I had never <br/>

was just so right and not adding anything but more love. And now that I&#39;m <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644113501">Well,  we didn&#39;t spank from the start but I don&#39;t know if that means we<br/>
were good parents.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
I was older, I&#39;d just turned 29 when Dylan was born.   His dad was older<br/>
33.  We had a long time away from our own childhoods,  a long time away<br/>
from our families, out in the world, and by that time almost all of our<br/>
friends from our younger days had kids.  There was so much growing up<br/>
time and I think that helped. <br/>
But I would cry myself to sleep sometimes because I&#39;d been frustrated or<br/>
tired and said something I shouldn&#39;t have.  I couldn&#39;t sleep at all some<br/>
nights wondering if I&#39;d ruined his life completely. <br/>
I&#39;m not a yeller, I internalize, but when you have a sensitive child they<br/>
see and know everything.  <br/>
I remembered as a child feeling responsible for my mother&#39;s stress and I<br/>
didn&#39;t want Dylan feeling that way.  <br/>
Letting go of the way we were raised is maybe the hardest thing to do and<br/>
I couldn&#39;t have done it without deliberating on it every day.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
have a horrible childhood but what I&#39;d had didn&#39;t seem at all good enough<br/>
for Dylan.   <br/>
The thing is you have to wake up every day and decide what&#39;s important,<br/>
and let go of the rest.  But you have to think about it because, for me<br/>
at least, it wasn&#39;t automatic.  <br/>
I&#39;m five months away from 40 and SO looking forward to that calm<br/>
acceptance that I&#39;ll never know it all.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

They don&#39;t have a problem being quiet when she&#39;s sleeping, they learned real quick that if they wake up the baby, the baby&#39;s gonna be REALLY fussy and mom doesn&#39;t have time to do much with them if she has to keep a fussy baby happy.

<br/>
Me too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Richard&#39;s awesome.<br/>
<br/>
His last name is hard to spell, but it&#39;s Prystowsky,<br/>
I think.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238809006"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m 39, and every day I learn something new about myself and about my<br/>
&gt; son.  <br/>
&gt; My son is like one of his beautiful paintings.   He works on <br/>
&gt; them for a<br/>
&gt; few weeks and everyday they change and become something <br/>
&gt; different.   At<br/>
&gt; age ten he might be like day three of his painting, <br/>
&gt; beautiful, complex,<br/>
&gt; mysterious, funny, with no hint at what the next day will <br/>
&gt; bring.   If I<br/>
&gt; can go to bed at night and say, ok, I got it right today,  <br/>
&gt; that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mean I can expect the same thing in the morning.  Because my <br/>
&gt; son will be<br/>
&gt; a different boy tomorrow.  He&#39;ll have learned new things and <br/>
&gt; thought new<br/>
&gt; thoughts and I will have to catch up with him all over again. <br/>
&gt;   He&#39;s such<br/>
&gt; a perfect learning person he makes me want to get it perfect too.  I<br/>
&gt; never will, but I&#39;ll wake up everyday ready to try.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

It is amazing how much you learn about yourself when you have kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559599201">I finally got that tape in the mail.  I enjoyed it VERY much.  But <br/>
it&#39;s not one I could loan to most of my Christian friends.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
agree with all the eastern religion in it, but I was able to look <br/>
past it and benefit from it.  I don&#39;t have a lot of Christian friends <br/>
who would be able too though.  He came on pretty strong.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra said something on there that just hit the right cord with me.  <br/>
She said to smell your child&#39;s hair when you&#39;re tempted to ignore <br/>
your child&#39;s needs, so that you realize just who this person is that <br/>
you&#39;re ignoring. (My rough paraphrase, she said it much better!)  I <br/>
found that very helpful, and have actually done that a few times <br/>
already.  <br/>

I was driving home from a rehearsal tonight and listening to that <br/>
particular tape.  If someone asked me what I think every brand new parent <br/>
should receive, I&#39;d have to say a copy of that tape for sure, along with a <br/>
very, very few other things, namely the Womanly Art of Breastfeeding; a <br/>
sling in not too fruity a pattern so Dad will use it, too; and the book the <br/>
The Continuum Concept.  I&#39;m sure there are a couple of more things, but I <br/>
just can&#39;t think of them right now.  Oh yes, a bottle of lavender essential <br/>
oil.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite things about the tape is hearing Sandra&#39;s voice, which I <br/>
really like.  One of the other favorite things is the subtle ways that <br/>
Sandra and Richard differ.  Both of them get there, but they use ever so <br/>
slightly different paths, and they are both accessible paths.<br/>
<br/>
GREAT tape!!<br/>
