This happened to me recently, for the first time, my computer is almost 2<br/>
years old.  When I asked my &quot;geek&quot; friends they said it&#39;s a &quot;Windows<br/>
glitch&quot; and it&#39;s been cropping up for a lot of folks in the last few<br/>
weeks.  I had to make all sorts of adjustments and ever since the window<br/>
sizes have been too big.  I probably should format the hard drive and<br/>
reinstall everything but it&#39;s a big job.<br/>

Need to do that with this machine anyway, but I&#39;ve lost <br/>
the disk :-(  I have the Win95 disk and the Win98 <br/>
book...  ack!  I&#39;ve needed to do this for ages, and I <br/>
also have another hard-drive in this &#39;puter htat I want <br/>
to set up to dual-boot so that I can separate the work <br/>
stuff from the non-work stuff...  <br/>
