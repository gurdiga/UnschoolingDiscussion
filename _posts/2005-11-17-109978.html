I always vaguely guess £100   --twice as many dollars as pounds, but you can <br/>
check the current rates with google.<br/>
US$ 200 = 115.989097 British pounds<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t even mean use google to find an exchange page.   <br/>
<br/>
I typed the question <br/>
what is $200 in pounds sterling?<br/>
into the google search box and the next page said <br/>
<br/>
US$ 200 = 115.989097 British pounds<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that cool?   Someone showed me that google does math conversions if you <br/>
just ask it a simple question.<br/>
<br/>
I asked &quot;How many feet in a mile?&quot;<br/>
Google says:<br/>
 1 mile = 5 280 feet<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914896954">Very cool. Just don&#39;t ask it how many fluid ounces to a pint. US <br/>
pints are bigger than UK ones. Many&#39;s the recipe that&#39;s been ruined <br/>
by not knowing that one.<br/>
<br/>
£116 is a lot of money to us. We spend a little over half that <br/>
around £60 a week on groceries, loo roll,cat food etc We do get <br/>
organic veggies, fruit, milk and eggs and tofu as we&#39;ve got a great <br/>
delivery service that supports local farms and I HATE food shopping. <br/>
None of us drive so we end up really tired after shopping for food. <br/>
Delivery is great! I think food is generally more expensive over <br/>
here but I do enjoy cooking so that really helps.<br/>
<br/>
DD has been bitten by the cooking bug too. She&#39;s also just asked me <br/>
if I&#39;d like a hot drink as she was making one. That&#39;s so nice. I <br/>
didn&#39;t need one but I told her I really appreciated the offer. She&#39;s <br/>
9  :)<br/>

We&#39;ve also used a delivery service from one of our local grocery <br/>
stores (not anything special, just the standard groceries). It was a <br/>
real lifesaver when DH was working part time and I was working full <br/>
time. And, when we got back from the Live and Learn conference and we <br/>
all had the flu and almost no food in the house (we were gone for 2 <br/>
weeks and my parents - our dogsitters - just bought what they needed <br/>
so supplies were quite dwindled). But we popped into the website from <br/>
DH&#39;s laptop while propped up in bed and placed the order. We just had <br/>
to save up enough energy to be dressed (reasonably) and ready to take <br/>
delivery - they bring it right to the kitchen table!</div>

Yes delivery services have been an absolute godsend for us. We have <br/>
a choice of 3 supermarkets that deliver in our city as well as the <br/>
organic veggie box scheme. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a wholefood wholesaler that will deliver for a minimum <br/>
order of £100 so a few of us group together and my friend with a car <br/>
brings the stuff round to me.<br/>
<br/>
Before delivery services I would lose a whole day a week because of <br/>
having to shop. I have a disability and get very tired, a heavy <br/>
shopping trip wipes me out. Sometimes the fatigue would roll over in <br/>
to the next day as well.<br/>
<br/>
As dd goes to her dad&#39;s every weekend my losing a day a week was <br/>
very significant for her. Now we get delivery we can still go in to <br/>
town and do a tiny shop or go in to town and hang out but it&#39;s not <br/>
the huge chore it used to be. Delivery services = unschooling <br/>
friendly. <br/>
<br/>
I have even bought online a sewing machine as a pressie for my older <br/>
daughter, a phone for my younger daughter, stocking fillers and a <br/>
pair of walking boots for me. <br/>

tissue&quot; or &quot;t.p.&quot; so that they didn&#39;t actually pronounce the nasty &quot;toilet&quot; <br/>
word. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Brits use the word &quot;scheme&quot; as we use &quot;plan&quot; or &quot;project.&quot;   There might be a <br/>
tax plan here, or a city roads project, but in England they might call those <br/>
&quot;tax schemes&quot; and such.    Here, a scheme is a sneaky deal someone hopes to <br/>
get away with without being caught.   (The explanation is so that the north <br/>
American readership won&#39;t think some organic veggie-box group is scamming poor <br/>
innocent buyers.)<br/>
