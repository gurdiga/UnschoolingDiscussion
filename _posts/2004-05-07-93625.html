<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375016813">I was wondering if you would be willing to share the titles of books <br/>
that have been beneficial to you during your <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling journey.  I&#39;m more interested in function <br/>
than history.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m particularly interested in books, if there are any, that reflect <br/>
a home situation that&#39;s not the typical &quot;mom and dad are both <br/>
wonderful and involved in the unschooling of their children.&quot;  Are <br/>
there any books that reflect a family that maybe has one directly <br/>
involved parent with a combination of children in different schooling <br/>
scenarios?  I&#39;m not only interested in this, but would love to read <br/>
something from that slant.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions...<br/>
<br/>
Tina</div>
