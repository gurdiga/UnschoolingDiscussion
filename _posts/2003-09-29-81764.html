&lt;&lt; Let&#39;s turn the table.  What about the term &quot;radical unschooler&quot;?  I<br/>
personally don&#39;t like it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind it.<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;re stating where your beliefs lie, and I made a statement which <br/>
included where MANY people&#39;s beliefs lie (including hundreds of thousands of <br/>
Christian Homeschoolers).<br/>
<br/>
How about having stated that you stop trying to convert me and others to your <br/>
minority view of terminology?<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;alley&quot; means the same thing to most people and there&#39;s a dictionary <br/>
definition and lots of cities define &quot;alley&quot; to mean the same thing, then someone <br/>
campaigning to call &quot;alley&quot; something different and to use the word &quot;alley&quot; to <br/>
mean something particularly other can put up web pages and billboards, but <br/>
they&#39;re fighting the tide of language.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But they don&#39;t make<br/>
me radical--at least, not in the sense in which I use that word, of<br/>
wanting to overturn all of the &#39;establishment&#39;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t what &quot;radical&quot; means.<br/>
If, in your mind, the word &quot;radical&quot; means to overturn the establishment, <br/>
please spend some time looking it up in dictionaries or in useage guides on the <br/>
internet.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe it&#39;s just I don&#39;t have a great take on the word &#39;radical&#39;.  Maybe<br/>
it&#39;s just the way I don&#39;t care for labels of any kind, anywhere.  But I<br/>
would no more call a group of people radical unschoolers than I would<br/>
call a group fundamentalist Christian or a group Christian<br/>
homeschoolers.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  You won&#39;t.  But I don&#39;t mind labels.  They&#39;re called &quot;nouns.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know my dog is a dog, and I know she&#39;s a pet, and a blue heeler and an <br/>
Australian Cattle Dog.  I didn&#39;t know at first.  At first she was a dog-pound <br/>
puppy.  Those labels don&#39;t hurt her.  They&#39;re ways of communicating about her.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Labels are a lot of what we leave school to escape. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your &quot;we&quot; should have been something different.  I didn&#39;t leave school to <br/>
escape labels.  First, I didn&#39;t &quot;leave school.&quot;  I finished it, continued it, and <br/>
became an employee of school.<br/>
<br/>
My children didn&#39;t &quot;leave school,&quot; they never went in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
And the reason I&#39;m glad they&#39;re home is to avoid structured delivery of <br/>
subject matter, not to &quot;escape labels.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Just as most of the women on this list would probably<br/>
prefer that either female pronouns be used in non-specific writing, or<br/>
that constructions like his/her be used, because we KNOW that using male<br/>
pronouns almost exclusively creates a worldview which maintains the<br/>
importance of the male over the female.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re proposing (speaking for most of the women on this list, no less) that <br/>
in referring to a mixed group, the pronoun &quot;she&quot; should be used primarily?  Or <br/>
he/she, but if not he/she then &quot;she&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s weird.  I&#39;ve never heard ANYONE propose that in the absence of he/she, <br/>
&quot;she&quot; should be preferable over &quot;he.&quot;  I&#39;ve known (and done) lots of going <br/>
back and forth, or using &quot;she&quot; sometimes, as a reminder that we&#39;re not talking <br/>
only of boys, in a late-reading situation or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Labels are made to pigeon-hole people, to<br/>
avoid our having to see the individuality that lies beneath the facade. <br/>
First we pigeon-hole, then we dehumanize, then we deprive rights,<br/>
then.....well, how did the Nazis end up able to slaughter so many<br/>
people?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
JESUS CHRIST!!! You think using a label is being a NAZI!?<br/>
<br/>
Get a grip.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers are people, too, working within<br/>
their own sets of values and worldviews.  If we label and avoid, we<br/>
contribute to the adversarial relationship that exists. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please read their stuff.  It&#39;s not &quot;adversarial.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s God against Satan.<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re either with me or against me,&quot; they say in sermons all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how you were raised, Holly, but I grew up Southern Baptist and I <br/>
know what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t WANT that adversarial relationship to fall.  They built it and <br/>
they maintain it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
I personally prefer to bring people together rather than divide or<br/>
maintain divisions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do it on your yourself in your own posts then, instead of disrupting this <br/>
group with talk of Nazis and other ranting.<br/>
<br/>
In the military, people have a job to do together and they are made to get <br/>
along by threat of punishment, expulsion or worse.  &quot;Can&#39;t we all just get along <br/>
like in the military&quot; isn&#39;t a legitimate argument to use of those for whom <br/>
the military won the freedom to be exclusive and separatist.<br/>
<br/>
Have you actually read any statements of faith?<br/>
Do you really understand what those groups intend by them?<br/>
