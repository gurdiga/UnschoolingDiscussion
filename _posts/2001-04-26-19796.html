<div id="ygrps-yiv-874550633">I keep finding spiders in our house - some I know are poisonous (some <br/>
are not, and most, I don&#39;t know) and I would like to get rid of <br/>
them.  But I don&#39;t want to kill them - I mean, it&#39;s not their fault <br/>
they&#39;re spiders.  Dh likes to get them with the vacuum hose.  The <br/>
kids and I use a cup, slip a piece of paper underneath, and take them <br/>
outside.  I still worry about being bitten, either while I&#39;m catching <br/>
them, or the kids while they&#39;re sleeping.  Any suggestions?  (I guess <br/>
I could saturate the house with anti-bug juice, but I was looking for <br/>
something a bit more, uh, friendly...)<br/>

Thank you<br/>

We learned that the two poisonous species (Black Widow & Brown Recluse)<br/>

Do you have a Natural History Museum near you?  Perhaps there is a<br/>
college or university with an entomologist on staff.  Our experience has<br/>
been that they love to talk about the subject.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155243850">We have lots of black widows in NC.  We have taught the kids what they look like<br/>
so they know it immediately when they see one.  They can kill it if they can do it<br/>
safely, or they are to call Mom or Dad.  We have only had one in the house, but<br/>
there are many, many outside.  They love to make homes in the kids toys in the<br/>
sand box, so all during the summer the kids do checks....<br/>
What was the black widow bite do Sandra?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685134611">We have the brown recluse here in FL, too.  I don&#39;t know about the widow, but I also think its a regional thing.  We just moved into a new place and have been visited by a variety of spiders, a few scorpions, centipedes, and millipedes, and some yukky thing I just killed in the garage.  Our guys love it, but I&#39;m worried about &quot;what&quot; is sleeping with the children at night.<br/>

***I was bitten by a huge shiny black spider years ago. We were living in a<br/>
woodsy area here in WA state where&#39;s there&#39;s both recluses and widows. I<br/>
don&#39;t know for sure what got me because I sort of accidentally repeatedly<br/>
pummeled it into spider bits in a moment of terror. But this was after it<br/>
bit me in the thigh (it was on my bathrobe).<br/>
<br/>
Hours later at work I started hallucinating, kind of like having a high<br/>
fever, and when I looked there were violent red-purple streaks<br/>
criss-crossing my thigh originating from the spider bite. So what did I do?<br/>
I went and passed out in my car. Didn&#39;t even tell anyone I was leaving. That<br/>
evil bug could have gotten me fired. I was alright several hours later (and<br/>
kept my job).<br/>
<br/>
I have heard of recluses causing people to need abscesses surgically<br/>
removed. Kind of like that strep that poisons skin...&quot;flesh eating whatever<br/>
they call it&quot;...except it&#39;s slower. Can be as bad, though. I like spiders<br/>
outside eating bugs. When they&#39;re in my house I&#39;m not very friendly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442728668">I guess I should have said, some of the spiders I have been told are <br/>
poisonous.  I believe we have brown recluse here - that&#39;s what my <br/>
neighbor said the one hiding behind my trashcan was - I see them <br/>
everywhere.  What I&#39;m really looking for is a way to make my house <br/>
unfriendly to bugs and spiders without hurting them.  Like an herb <br/>
they don&#39;t like or something.  I&#39;m hoping RAID is not my only option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087192576">Hi Melanie,<br/>
As far as I know, there are only 2 spiders that are poisonous in the US, the black widow which is all black and has a red hour glass on their abdomen.  And the brown recluse which is a tannish brown and has a violin-shaped thing behind the head.  You really don&#39;t have to worry about the other spiders, their palps are too short to penetrate human skin.  They even trap the other pesky bugs that manage to get in the house!  I usually leave a few webs up.  But when they get too numerous, I just suck them up with the vacuum.  My DD will trap them with her hands and put them outside if she knows I&#39;m vacuuming them up!<br/>
<br/>
Here is a good site that talks about spiders:<br/>

Subject: poisonous spiders in our house<br/>
<br/>
I keep finding spiders in our house - some I know are poisonous (some <br/>
are not, and most, I don&#39;t know) and I would like to get rid of <br/>
them.  But I don&#39;t want to kill them - I mean, it&#39;s not their fault <br/>
they&#39;re spiders.  Dh likes to get them with the vacuum hose.  The <br/>
kids and I use a cup, slip a piece of paper underneath, and take them <br/>
outside.  I still worry about being bitten, either while I&#39;m catching <br/>
them, or the kids while they&#39;re sleeping.  Any suggestions?  (I guess <br/>
I could saturate the house with anti-bug juice, but I was looking for <br/>
something a bit more, uh, friendly...)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>

the size of a half dollar where the skin just sort of died.<br/>

That is what I do as well.  When we lived in a rural area with horses for<br/>
neighbors we were greatful for the spiders and their webs.  We had two<br/>
particularly efficient ones who monitored opposite ends of the house. <br/>
When one of them died an offspring moved into her web and did just as<br/>
good a job.  They caught HUNDREDS of flys and gnats and this was IN the<br/>
house.<br/>

&lt;&lt; What was the black widow bite do Sandra? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Looked like a big ant bite, made me woozy-sick, like a stupid-making flu for <br/>
a few days.  It was on my waist, on the side.  Not awful.  I don&#39;t know if it <br/>
would be worse on a small child or whether they&#39;d quickly recover from being <br/>
healthy kids (I&#39;m old).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had two brown recluse bites, though.  The first, I let it go because I <br/>
kept thinking it would start healing any day, and we were poor...  Five or <br/>
six months.  A big open sore.  The next time I saw one I recognized the sore <br/>
opening up and went straight to the doctor and said, &quot;Antibiotics, <br/>
please--inside, outside--lots.&quot;  <br/>

&lt;&lt;  I believe we have brown recluse here - that&#39;s what my <br/>
neighbor said the one hiding behind my trashcan was - I see them <br/>
everywhere.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My guess is if you&#39;re seeing them everywhere, that&#39;s not them.<br/>
They don&#39;t like to be around busy people.  When we moved in our house had <br/>
been empty for a while, and I saw a few.  Haven&#39;t seen one for two years (but <br/>
we&#39;ve also had it sprayed sometimes, around the outside, not inside, because <br/>
of spider-fear).<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the website that was here you&#39;ll see what they look like and <br/>
you won&#39;t worry about whatever you keep seeing (which I could be wrong about, <br/>
but if I&#39;m wrong you&#39;ll know! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

I called the emergency room here, and asked what we should expect and do if one<br/>
of us was bitten by a black widow.  The kids were toddlers then.  They said, and<br/>
adult would just get really sick feeling, but a child especially one so young<br/>
should be brought immediately to the hospital.  I didn&#39;t ask more....  I don&#39;t<br/>
think I want to know.<br/>
That is when we educated the kids to what a black widow looks like.  ANY black<br/>
spider is stomped!  Just to be on the safe side since we have so many around<br/>
here, and the kids are outside playing all the time.<br/>
