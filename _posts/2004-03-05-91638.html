Dear List,<br/>
I have been enjoying your dialogue on &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;.<br/>
Just wanted to share with you that my 11 year old daughter, Catie, had the<br/>
opportunity to screen the film in December with a group of priests and nuns.<br/>
 She came out telling me that it was more like living through an experience<br/>
than watching a film.....I would have to say that I agree with that<br/>
assessment.  <br/>
I came out of the theatre literally exhausted - and I truly believe that the<br/>
film, with all of the violence, helped not only myself but my little girl as<br/>
well.  Of course, each of you knows whether or not your child could handle<br/>
the graphic scenes of Our Lord being beaten, scourged and crucified....<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Mel is a devout Catholic - (our family is as well) and I was overjoyed<br/>
to finally see a film with some Catholic overtones.  It has been beautiful<br/>
to see the coming together of so many religions on a film....in support of<br/>
one another.  I pray that it continues.<br/>
His daughter is a nun (or close to becoming fully professed) and my little<br/>
Catie hopes to join the nuns at 18 - this movie seemed to solidify her <br/>
calling&quot; to become a sister.  She has said she has wanted to be a nun since<br/>
she was 4 years old....so there must be something to her vocation.  This<br/>
movie only made that resolve stronger.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, I must admit that I&#39;ve been waiting to hear some of our protestant<br/>
brothers and sisters start complaining about the Catholic &quot;overtones&quot;....i.e<br/>
, the Blessed Mother, the scenes of the crucifixion while flashing back to<br/>
the Last Supper (where we believe Jesus instituted the Holy Eucharist)<br/>
I did watch an interview on EWTN with Mr. Gibson and he said that he was<br/>
clearly trying to show the bloody sacrifice of Christ on the cross while<br/>
flashing back to the unbloody sacrifice of the altar.  Very moving for me<br/>
personally.<br/>
I hate the fact that I feel like I&#39;m waiting for the other shoe to drop<br/>
regarding other faiths and their interpretation of the film.  Makes me sad<br/>
-- like why can&#39;t we just all come together on something and not start<br/>
picking it apart.  Y&#39;know?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, I wanted to write and share that my 11 year old saw<br/>
this movie and helped her in her faith tremendously.  If any of you would<br/>
like to get Catie&#39;s direct feedback, she said she&#39;d be happy to write to you<br/>
with her &quot;review&quot; so-to-speak. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Peace be with each of you!<br/>

of our actions, nor even at their difficulty, but at the love with which we<br/>
do them. <br/>
