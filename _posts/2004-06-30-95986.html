<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113620984">I never did get back to the topic of the phrase in question on the <br/>
certificate of empowerment.  Life keeps sweeping me away to other things.  This isn&#39;t <br/>
hugely important, but might be of interest to the nit-picky philosophical types, <br/>
of which we have a fair number here!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone wrote a few months ago with a question/suggestion on the Certificate <br/>
of Empowerment.  The text of it is below, and it&#39;s at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/empowerment">http://sandradodd.com/empowerment</a><br/>
Also,  someone adapted it for medical recovery purposes, here:<br/>

<br/>
But here&#39;s my text:<br/>
<br/>
CERTIFICATE OF EMPOWERMENT<br/>
<br/>
As bearer of this certificate you are no longer required to depend on the <br/>
advice of experts. You may step back and view the entire world-not just your <br/>
home, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth-as a learning experience, a <br/>
laboratory containing languages (and native speakers thereof), plants, animals, <br/>
history, geology, weather (real live weather, in the sky, not in a book), music, <br/>
art , mathematics, physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, and ideas <br/>
without end. Although collections of these treasures have been located in museums <br/>
for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere else, too. <br/>
<br/>
This authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy your kids; to rejoice <br/>
when your children surpass you in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make mistakes, <br/>
and to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may allow your children to <br/>
experience boredom without taking full responsibility for finding them something to <br/>
do. <br/>
<br/>
Henceforth you shall neither be required nor expected to finish everything <br/>
you start. Projects, books, experiments and plans may be discontinued as soon as <br/>
something more interesting comes along (or for any other reason) without <br/>
penalty, and picked up again at any time in the future (or never). <br/>
<br/>
You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>
feel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>
harm. <br/>
<br/>
You have leave to think your own thoughts, and to encourage your children to <br/>
think theirs. <br/>
Each person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these <br/>
privileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by <br/>
creating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to obtain <br/>
approval to experiment, to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen others do <br/>
are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the first place. <br/>
<br/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Another homeschooling site posted it years ago, with one little tweak in the <br/>
text:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Although collections of these treasures have been located in libraries and <br/>
museums for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere else, too.-=-<br/>
<br/>
They added &quot;libraries.&quot;<br/>
I think that largely defeats the purpose.<br/>
<br/>
But...  <br/>
<br/>
The real question is about this paragraph, in the one I pass out at <br/>
conferences and have on my own website:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>
feel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>
harm. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
When it was first written, I had help from other online unschoolers to polish <br/>
it up for what I thought was a single day&#39;s use at a conference in New <br/>
Mexico.  It has survived many, many years.<br/>
<br/>
The question of unschooling is rarely, these days &quot;Is it okay to take them <br/>
out of school?&quot;  That&#39;s what the phrase about protecting them from harm was <br/>
about, and reclaiming control.  It was about not thinking schools could dictate a <br/>
family&#39;s schedule, or force a child away from parents.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are more often former other-kinds-of-homeschoolers these days,  I <br/>
think, than fresh-from-school families.<br/>
<br/>
The problem cited by the reader was that some parents will interpret &quot; take <br/>
what steps you feel necessary to protect your children&quot; as encouragement to <br/>
control their lives, to forbid television.  It&#39;s a valid question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Should the certificate be amended?  Annotated?  Left as it is?<br/>

family&#39;s schedule/learning/life/socialization/whatever&quot;. Okay, I have <br/>
no idea how to end that sentence, but you get the idea.<br/>

Only because it was brought up am I also chiming in -- otherwise I love <br/>
it.  It IS very empowering and I&#39;ve passed it on to many friends.  :)<br/>

<br/>
I love this paragraph. For my response to the Certificate, this was the<br/>
heart of the thing.<br/>
<br/>
However if you really wanted to update it, perhaps - concurring with another<br/>
poster - something along the lines of:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your family may reclaim control of their daily life, and take what steps<br/>
you feel necessary to ensure your children&#39;s freedom from physical,<br/>
emotional or social harm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It never occurred to me that this would be taken as an endorsement of media<br/>
limiting, but that is undoubtedly because I was already familiar with<br/>
Sandra&#39;s writing and the concepts of non-limiting. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The good news is I have a special folder where the original lives, and I will <br/>
print this out and put it there and consider changing it before it&#39;s ever <br/>
reprinted again.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is I have several hundred.  As the cost of photocopying went up <br/>
and up, and I just pass them out broadly at conferences, I decided last fall <br/>
to go to a printshop and get them done on various papers in the cheap <br/>
ink-of-the-day (on a good ink-color day, I mean &lt;g&gt;), and so...  It will be a while <br/>
before reprinting.  <br/>
<br/>
I do appreciate the input.  I don&#39;t want it to have even a bit of harm in it. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe, though, nobody really sees it without knowing enough about unschooling <br/>
or me to know what the intent is.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe it will last a long time.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe I could just change the online version.   <br/>
<br/>
But no.  Yeah.  That&#39;s what I should do.  <br/>
No, I can&#39;t decide.<br/>

Oh good!  An argument for not changing it. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m not in a big hurry to decide since I have two or three years&#39; <br/>
worth in my office.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun, that day, ordering them.  I worked in a print shop years ago, so <br/>
I knew to apply to their need to offload leftovers from old jobs, so I asked <br/>
him if he would charge me plain-paper cost for an assortment of whatever all <br/>
they had in the left-over nice-paper piles in the back, and he did.    So I have <br/>
different colored papers with colored inks which satisfies my urge for them <br/>
to be a bit colorful.<br/>

<br/>
There is no single statement that would cause all parents to realize the benefits of removing limits.  It takes many conversations and hearing or reading stories of families where it is working.  Maybe some people read one thing, one time and totally change, but I needed to hear or read it over and over before it made sense.  It also took self examination for me to realize areas I was setting limits without realizing it.<br/>
