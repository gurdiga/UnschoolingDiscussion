&lt;&lt; We do adjust our behavior for different situations, but having kids<br/>
around doesn&#39;t tend to define the situation.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good way to put it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids and I can both adjust our behaviors depending who&#39;s around, what <br/>
their sensitivities are preferences are, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We can discuss R rated movies with our kids, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I think a family with a teenager (even a young teen) who hasn&#39;t seen R rated <br/>
movies with the parents is in such a different mindset from our family that <br/>
the discussion will be apples and avocados.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; Trying to overcome that would be a huge step toward understanding <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I dont see that as something to overcome. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s fine, but I do and truly believe that unschooling will be difficult if <br/>
you deal differently with your teenaged daughter, and you don&#39;t consider <br/>
yourself to be her peer, than you deal with other people.  The more you treat <br/>
her like a whole person instead of a child, the easier it will be for you to <br/>
understand what unschoolers are talking about when they talk about natural <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Kids are not &quot;little adults&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;I  think some topics are inappropiate for children to be exposed to. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think there are a few, depending on the child.  But if the rule is made <br/>
expressly to separate children from adults, that gap is hard to bridge.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My husband and I maybe out for dinner and drinks with another <br/>
couple, and the conversations turns to sex, or we may discuss an R rated <br/>
movie that we have seen recently.  I may have a heart to heart talk with a <br/>
girlfriend or sister about marital problems.   I may discuss concerns for <br/>
over my childrens behavior with another mother.   My husband and I may <br/>
disdoesn&#39;t necessarily have to do with age differences.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t ever discuss sex with a thirteen year old girl, that&#39;s going to <br/>
be a problem any day now.  I&#39;m more likely to discuss concerns over my c<br/>
hildren&#39;s behavior with them or their friends than with my other adult <br/>
friends.  But because of that I have very few concerns about their behavior.  <br/>
It&#39;s not something that&#39;s discussed behind their backs, it&#39;s one part of the <br/>
larger relationship--both my concerns and their behavior.  My concerns are <br/>
often more a problem than their actions.  They call it &quot;mom stuff.&quot;  They&#39;re <br/>
sensitive to &quot;mom stuff,&quot; but they know it for what it is--protective <br/>
instinct, projection, sensitivity to what others think...<br/>
<br/>
Because they are acknowledged to have as much mature (&quot;adult&quot; perhaps in your <br/>
parlance) awareness and sensitivity as they come to have, they have quite a <br/>
full range of it!  If I waited for them to be 16 or 18 to talk about human <br/>
interrelationships, why moms worry, why kids need freedom, why their friends <br/>
are being the way they are, they would have made dozens or hundreds of <br/>
mistakes without the benefit of analysis before they got to the point that <br/>
they would be out on their own.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t we all adjust our behavior to the situation and <br/>
circumstances that we are in?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I speak differently with longterm friends than I would with their <br/>
grandmothers.  I discuss different things with toddlers than I do with <br/>
teenagers.  But in every case, I am relieved when and if that other person is <br/>
able to meet me as a person and talk about something real and meaningful.  <br/>
And it will happen more often if you expect it to happen and allow for it to <br/>
happen.  <br/>
<br/>
The situation and circumstances of unschooling, in my own life, have involved <br/>
helping my children be in the world by their being in the world, with <br/>
discussion and commentary and analysis.  In that exploration, I am their <br/>
peer.  I got here first, but I don&#39;t know everything.  They learn from me, <br/>
but I learn from them too.<br/>
<br/>
I know this was just lately mentioned, but it&#39;s too applicable not to mention <br/>
again here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-843015751">My oldest son read about sex in a Parent Handbook of Childcraft when he was <br/>
9.   All about how to explain it to your children, complete with pictures, <br/>
Intercourse.. penis, vagina, sperm. the whole nine  yards.  He had <br/>
unrestricted access to any book he wanted to read.  He loved medical <br/>
encyclopedias.  We told him the facts about getting pregnant when he was 8.. <br/>
I was pregnant with my 4th child.  He said.. Moma, I know that the egg inside <br/>
you gets fertilized by the seed inside Daddy, but how does the seed get <br/>
there?  I said.. &quot;Well, you know where the seed is stored in Daddy, right? He <br/>
nodded, &quot;yes,in his testicles.&quot;  &quot;OK&quot;, I said.. &quot;and where is the egg stored <br/>
in Mommy?&quot;  &quot;In her ovaries&quot; he repliled.. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said. and where are <br/>
they.?&quot;  He pointed to the correct place on his tummy. &quot;Thats right&quot;, I <br/>
said.. &quot;So, how what do you think the quickest route from Mommy to Daddy <br/>
would be?&quot;  He though a minute and his eyes got wide.. He said.. &quot;You mean, <br/>
.. Daddy puts his penis inside your vagina?&quot;   &quot;Yes, thats right&quot; I said  <br/>
&quot;Men and women have sex because they love each other.  When they make love, <br/>
the sperm comes out of the man and if the womans egg is just right, she can <br/>
get pregnant&quot;   And thats how he learned the basics of sex.   My daugher <br/>
learned when she was about 10, she wasnt quite a precocious.  My 11 yo son <br/>
still doesnt know ALL about sex, but when he asks, when he&#39;s ready, he&#39;ll <br/>
know too.  When my oldest son was about 10, he came downstairs one night to <br/>
our bed.  He was very worried.. He wanted to ask me something. .. &quot;What is it <br/>
honey&quot; I asked him.. He said..&quot; Well, Ive been worrying about this, and I <br/>
just wanted to ask you if anything was wrong&quot;  &quot;Ok, what is it, you can ask <br/>
me&quot;  I reassured him. He said.. &quot;Well, sometimes when I play with my penis it <br/>
gets all slippery, is that supposed to happen?&quot; I  said. &quot; Oh, yeah, yeah, <br/>
dont worry about that, that is perfectly normal. nothing is wrong with you, <br/>
your fine&quot;  He said., very relieved.. &quot;Oh good, I was scared about it&quot;   My <br/>
children have seen selective R rated movies since they were as young as 8.  <br/>
It all depends on the child and the content.  Anna wont watch Titantic <br/>
because she is too tender hearted.   Sex doesnt &quot;bother&quot; Landon ( hes 16)  <br/>
but graphic violence does.   Ethan and JP seem to get a thrill from the gore <br/>
and guts, but too much &quot;supernatural&quot; stuff bothers them.   If we want to <br/>
have wine or beer with our supper, we do. If we want to tell dirty jokes, we <br/>
do.  If we want to get mad and cuss each other out, we do.   Landons friends <br/>
smoke pot, but Landon doesnt. If he smokes or drinks, he&#39;ll call one of us to <br/>
come get him.. But I highly doubt he will becasue he thinks its ignorant.  <br/>
Some of Anna&#39;s friends have experimented with sex, but Anna hasnt.. If she <br/>
wants to, she&#39;ll talk to me about it.  <br/>
<br/>
You see, you dont really know me.  You have made assumptions about me and my <br/>
family that are way off the mark.   I may not be an &quot;unschooler&quot; but that <br/>
certainly doesnt mean i am an uptight repressed overprotective parent.  Most <br/>
parent are shocked by my parenting approach.  I hope none of you are too <br/>
shocked.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rain watched Titanic on TV and was fine with it - it was a story to her,<br/>
even though she knew  it was based on a true story she responded to it as<br/>
fiction because it was clearly fictionalized and hollywoodized. OTOH,<br/>
last week she watched something PBS about using DNA technology to<br/>
identify remains of Titanic victims, and she came to me in tears about<br/>
the story of the one child whose remains were found. And pinned to her<br/>
wall she has a facsimile of a Titanic ticket with the name of an actual<br/>
passenger  (who survived) that she got when we went to the Arizona<br/>
Science Center with Karin and her boys, and she talks about the woman<br/>
sometimes...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting. She reads all sorts of books that people say are scary<br/>
and too adult for her, but it&#39;s exclusively fiction, even though some are<br/>
based on historical fact (she just read Stones in Water). She&#39;s almost<br/>
never upset by books she reads, fiction is apparently abstract enough for<br/>
her to read at arm&#39;s length... but news stories and documentaries<br/>
frequently bring her to tears.<br/>
