<br/>
Now, I&#39;m a fair weather fan, lol.  I like all sports but usually find it <br/>
boring to watch on TV, not the same as being there.  So I only watch my teams and <br/>
the playoffs.  <br/>
<br/>
A match up between the Sox and Cubs, can that happen, for the World Series? ( <br/>
yah, I am so well informed about baseball!)   I hope it doesn&#39;t, too many <br/>
people to disappoint either way...But, Yankees can bite me, so.....( even tho I <br/>
lived for quite a few years in NY).  GO SOX!!  Until they play the Cubs, of <br/>
course! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459656274">YES!!!   That was the most back and forth, moment to moment, unbelievably <br/>
tense game I&#39;ve ever seen!   And this from a woman who frowns at dh&#39;s <br/>
frequent need to watch sports.  But it is the Red Sox and I grew up in <br/>
Boston and as much as they so frequently in the past have stomped on our <br/>
hearts by taking us to the brink and then just missing it....  I am tempted <br/>
to take my newly baseball-loving 6yo to Boston to watch a game at Fenway <br/>
(and just to be in Fenway is such an experience, so many great stories he <br/>
could hear from his grandfather about all the past Fenway moments...) w/ <br/>
his uncle who has an extra ticket... but the 3yo would have to go along for <br/>
the veeeeery long ride so I have to just be happy we have TV .   Go SOX!!!!!!!!<br/>

plans to get a tattoo (his first) if they win it all.<br/>

out of his slump. After tonight&#39;s game, you almost have to believe it :)<br/>
