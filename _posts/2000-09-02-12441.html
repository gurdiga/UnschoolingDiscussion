<br/>
I&#39;m surprised your vet hasn&#39;t already given you all of the neutering info. I<br/>
have 2 male cats, both neutered at 6 mos. I have heard of others being done<br/>
sooner. As for the smell, change your litter box often and use air<br/>
fresheners. I find Glade plug ins work the best. Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870258590">Well, as mother to Az-re-el, Gargamel and Boo, I can tell you what we have<br/>
done, present and past.  No one ever knew we had cats, even when we had<br/>
Krispy Kritter, Blacket and Poppy and her 4 kittens all in the house. <br/>
Blacket used the toilet and Poppy would yowl until you let her outside, so<br/>
we really only had one using a litter box.  We used baking soda in the cat<br/>
box before sprinkling in the litter.  If you can afford it, the clumping<br/>
kind is the best.  The box itself was washed out each week using hexol (?<br/>
spelling) and then let soak for about 15 minutes with a baking soda bath.<br/>
<br/>
As to accidents, you need to be sure that the spots are well scrubbed with<br/>
something like Dial soap because that is the first place a male will mark,<br/>
sometimes even if they are neutered.<br/>
<br/>
Neutering should be done at six months at the latest because cats mature<br/>
real early and once they start thinking that way if does no good to neuter<br/>
them as far as the marking of territory is concerned.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453386574">I&#39;ve heard of white vinegar, and have tried it.  I notice an initial<br/>
elimination of odor, but after a day it comes back.  I&#39;ve never heard of the<br/>
dial soap idea.  Does using liquid dial soap work just as well?<br/>
<br/>
I was using this spray pet odor stuff that was 8 dollars a bottle-too much<br/>
money!!  So I stopped buying it.  It helped, but again, was temporary-lasted<br/>
about a week or two.  (puh-enzyme action my eye! that&#39;s the last time I buy<br/>
into that!)<br/>
<br/>
There this cat litter called Feline Pine.  I really suggest you try it! It&#39;s<br/>
expensive, 9 dollars a bag, but so long as you remove the tootsie rolls<br/>
there is no smell, no tracking and it is very light, easy to change.  I ran<br/>
out of it and had to use my emergency litter (multiple cat formula gritty<br/>
kitty).  I put only about an inch in and change it every other day (I have 5<br/>
pans!) but the smell returns before I change it.  (I can&#39;t bear the thought<br/>
of changing the litter more than that! Eek!)<br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem right now is the kitchen floor.  There&#39;s carpet in there,<br/>
and after multiple kitty messes, potty training mistakes (poor Abraham, just<br/>
can&#39;t remember to go to the bathroom!) and doggy piddles (brother in law&#39;s<br/>
english springer spaniel) the musty odor will not go away! Yuck.  Yesterday<br/>
we invested in a dehumidifier. (What an exciting way to spend money.) The<br/>
odor from the cats is non existent now yay!! but the kitchen floor smells<br/>
hideous.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to try the dial suggestion.  Hey, at this point, I&#39;ll try just<br/>
about anything!<br/>
<br/>
7 cats!!!?? How Glorious!! Maybe someday-sigh-<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my son is learning that keeping animals is a big resonsibility-and<br/>
my dh is teaching him that in order to live with someone you love you make<br/>
compromises. (Dh doesn&#39;t like cats much! But he loves me! :-)<br/>

bin at least 6 inches tall will do.)  Fill it with about 20 pounds of plain <br/>

Not sure on how to stop the smell from returning, but Febreze (not <br/>
sure of the North American spelling, but I&#39;m sure you know what <br/>
I mean) does get rid of tom-cat smell!  Oh, and apparently tin-<br/>
foil&#39;s a good deterrent if you put it down in the places they <br/>
frequently &#39;mark,&#39; seemingly they don&#39;t like the feel on their feet.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

been told never to use an ammonia based product to clean up an accident <br/>
because urine itself is basically ammonia.  The point is to get rid of the <br/>
smell (for our sake and so that the cat won&#39;t come back to that spot).  On <br/>
the other hand, spraying ammonia in the cat box will sometimes induce a cat <br/>
to use the box when he&#39;s had accidents elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if your cat is having unexplained accidents, it could have <br/>
cystitis or crystals in the urine or could be diabetic.  We have one of each.<br/>
