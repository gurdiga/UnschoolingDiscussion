<div id="ygrps-yiv-695326393">There have been some helpful clarifications and revisions made to the original description <br/>
of the unschooling circuit rider yahoo group.  Just wanted to keep everyone posted.  <br/>
Joanne O&#39;N.<br/>
<br/>
Have you attended a unschooling conference wishing you could go to more during the <br/>
year? Have you never had a chance to attend a conference and have heard everyone <br/>
sharing how much they loved the one that just past? Do you belong to unschooling yahoo <br/>
groups but don&#39;t have time to get on and read as much as you would like since you are <br/>
busy doing other things with your family? Would you like to know about other types of <br/>
conferences where there will be at least one speaker who will be talking about <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Here is one place where all statewide and larger unschooling conferences, gatherings, <br/>
speakers and events can be posted so that those of us who would like to &quot;ride the circuit&quot; <br/>
can easily find which ones are coming up. This includes anything from statewide to <br/>
international. <br/>
<br/>
This particular yahoo group is not covering local unschooling groups. For local get-<br/>
togethers find a list for your local area.<br/>
<br/>
If you know of an unschooling conference, gathering, speaker or event that is not posted <br/>
here, please add it to our list! If you know of a different type of conference, gathering, <br/>
speaker or event not specifically related to unschooling but which you think other life <br/>
learners might also be interested in, please e-mail me so we can consider posting it here <br/>
as well. :) <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting you on the journey,<br/>
Joanne O&#39;N.<br/>
