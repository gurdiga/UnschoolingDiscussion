What have you all successfully done in these situations? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insight,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517432372">I check if the bathrooms are empty. They are more willing to go the either one ( and be safe alone in the men&#39;s bathroom) if they are empty.<br/>
 I check, knock on the door and even call in there.<br/>
 Sometimes they are both busy and there is nothing you can do but I have to say that busy bathrooms are safer than bathrooms with only one or two people in it.<br/>
 I have been asked by dad&#39;s to take their little girls into the girl;s bathrooms. <br/>
I have also send my son with with several friends in a big group to the men&#39;s  bathroom. I do stand right outside the door so I can hear what is going on and make sure he is safe. Safety in groups?<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to my son on how to be safe and I have made sure the woman&#39;s bath was empty so he did not feel bad about  being in there.<br/>
I do love the family&#39;s bathrooms!<br/>
But I have to say that at 6 my son had no problems being in a women&#39;s bathroom .It was not until a couple years later at least that he started minding it.<br/>

He won&#39;t be six for more than a year. :-)<br/>
<br/>
You could wait until he&#39;s older or choose your outings based on the facilities.<br/>
Depending where you live, maybe he could occasionally water some bushes.<br/>

Maybe taking another boy along--his age or older--would give him courage to go in a public restroom.  If it&#39;s an older boy, you could ask him to help your son, maybe.<br/>

We carry an old wide-mouth lidded water bottle in the car for Noor to use. She and Michael go out quite a bit without me, and they know where all the family-friendly bathrooms are in our area. Now, at 8, she goes into the women&#39;s room alone, while he waits outside the entrance, but she didn&#39;t want to do that a few years ago, so the pee bottle got a lot of use.  <br/>

When David was around five or six he started worrying a bit about going<br/>
into the Ladies&#39; with me. I discovered that he was a bit worried that he<br/>
was breaking the rules by going in with me; I told him there was an<br/>
unwritten rule that little boys could go in the Ladies&#39; with their mothers<br/>
or little girls into the Mens&#39; with their fathers and no-one would object.<br/>
He asked occasionally after that if he was still little enough, I&#39;d say<br/>
&quot;yes&quot; and he&#39;d be completely reassured.<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s 8 he occasionally likes to go in the Mens&#39; to feel a bit<br/>
independent but it doesn&#39;t bother him at all to come in the Ladies&#39; with me.<br/>
