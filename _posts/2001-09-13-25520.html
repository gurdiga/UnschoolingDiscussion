<br/>

hard to overcome your past.  There sure are a lot of people out there who <br/>
would rather justify the way they treat their kids than change it.  (And <br/>
I&#39;m not talking about anyone here.)  I&#39;ve also yelled at my kids at times <br/>
and even hit them and felt terrible about it.  The thing that kept me from <br/>
feeling too horrible  (besides knowing that I was doing my best and trying <br/>
to improve) was realizing that I&#39;ve done a better job at parenting than my <br/>
parents.  And my daughter is doing a better job than I&#39;ve done.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I was in your situation, I&#39;d probably be feeling and reacting much the <br/>
way you are.  Give yourself credit for trying.  Hang in there.  I can tell <br/>
what a good mother you are precisely because you&#39;re giving yourself such a <br/>
hard time about your slip ups.  Can you find a way to pamper yourself a <br/>
bit?  It&#39;s awfully hard to give when your own tank is empty.<br/>

<br/>
The wonderful thing about kids is that when we screw up and apologize, and <br/>
explain what WE need, is that they can be the greatest support. Let your kids <br/>
take care of you as you take care of them. Skip over the squabbling posts and <br/>
enjoy the joyful ones.  You are loved, and you are NOT a failure, even if you <br/>
mess up sometimes.<br/>

You have it. Peace be with you and your family at this very horrible time. We <br/>
all do things that we regret but we are just human and doing the best we can. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The recent events has overwhelmed us here and we do not know anyone involved <br/>
and are far removed in KS. But still it has touched us deeply. My kids are <br/>
older and they are glued to the tv or radio listening and watching in <br/>
disbelief. When we see the destruction in Manhatten we are shocked yet they <br/>
say what we are seeing is nothing compared to what is there. When we hear the <br/>
victims families crying on tv holding pictures of their loved ones wanting to <br/>
know if anyone has seen them, well, I do not think we will be the same. <br/>
<br/>
For anyone who knows someone that is missing, or hurt, our thoughts are with <br/>
you. <br/>

<br/>
Please don&#39;t feel like a failure.  You sound plenty okay to me.  I think<br/>
what you need to do is find that point of balance that works for you<br/>
family.  I&#39;ve been at this for 6 years, and only recently did I realize<br/>
that my needs counted to.  I used to just let the kids do whatever all<br/>
day, I took them to lots of cools places and ran myself ragged working<br/>
and going on field trips and then coming home to a mess of a house. <br/>
Throw in a couple of major illnesses and it was not pretty.<br/>
Anyway, I realized just recently that it is not unreasonable for me to<br/>
expect my teenagers to help with the house.  We sat down and discussed it<br/>
and I talked to them about how unfair it was to Ron who came home from<br/>
work and did housework every night to help me.  That&#39;s when we hashed out<br/>
the job list that has been so pilloried here.  But untimately what has<br/>
occurred is that they now feel like they have MORE power in the household<br/>
and therefore more responsibility.  <br/>
I know your children are younger than mine, but don&#39;t forget to put your<br/>
own health and mental wellbeing into the equation when you are looking at<br/>
what is working for your family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573461835">Sheri, don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. I think we all have elevated stress<br/>
level right now. Many of us will be directly affected in the aftermath of<br/>
this. Just give your kids hugs and reassurance of your love. Let them know<br/>
at the level they can handle that you are concerned and spend some time with<br/>
them right now. I have been very distracted by all the events and concerned<br/>
also. At first I was getting snappy with the children, but as we talked<br/>
about what was going on, there was a change of mindset and we are in this<br/>
together. We have heard from family members in NY and they are all ok. Today<br/>
I am going to make sure I am listening to what my children are feeling and<br/>
experiencing so I can support them. Is your husband home right now, or away?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596046046">Dearest Sheri,<br/>
<br/>
You are not alone.<br/>
<br/>
My how you must love your children.<br/>
<br/>
I used to yell and spank also.  I too, fall into old patterns sometimes.  My<br/>
children are very forgiving when I come to my senses and figure out what I<br/>
need to apologize for.  Time and more time -- it takes time.  And when you<br/>
get frustrated try going to the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
My heart goes out to you and your family -- this is not an easy time for<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
You, your family and your children are the most important thing in this<br/>
(your) world ... everything else really doesn&#39;t matter ... the dishes (one<br/>
will get cleaned when it&#39;s needed), the dust (it will move someday), the<br/>
peanutbutter in the chair (it&#39;s just a chair - and so what - someday it will<br/>
be replaced or covered with a blanket) -- So who cares if the house is a<br/>
mess -- if they care about it they will help with it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what else I can say -- I am not always good with words.<br/>
 Except - My thoughts are with you and I hope any good feelings of love from<br/>
me reach you.  Your post certainly touched me.<br/>
<br/>
With all my heart - Love,<br/>
<br/>

  mom is heart broken, they are her friends. Darren her husband is a retired<br/>
  big wig in the Air Force.  So many family and friends in the military...I<br/>
  haven&#39;t heard from my dear friend who lives in Manhatten, I am sure they<br/>
are<br/>
  fine but will feel better when I hear from her. I am rambling... I had the<br/>
  TV on too much and am grumpy...<br/>
<br/>
  I have been snapping at my kids, which makes me feel terrible. I have<br/>
heard<br/>
  some amazing personal stories from many of you. I have a story too, not<br/>
  always pretty. I used to spank my kids and yell a lot. We have been using<br/>
  unschooling as a path to healing, some days I feel it is working and I am<br/>
  amazed at all I have learned and how much stronger my relationship to my<br/>
  kids has become. Then there are days when I &quot;lose it&quot; and revert to my<br/>
  yelling. I am in counseling, but am about to be kicked off insurance, my<br/>
  counselor says I am one the sanest people she knows. But I don&#39;t always<br/>
feel<br/>
  that way. All it takes is one &quot;blow out&quot; for my kids to be in tears and my<br/>
  five year old to revert to some old behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
  I feel a bit like a failure tonight. I yelled at my kids, after neglecting<br/>
  them for two days. The current events will probably directly effect us,<br/>
  (husband is military).  My house is a mess, which always makes me feel<br/>
  badly. I could sure use some words of encouragment. Have any of you come<br/>
  from a troubled beginnings and overcome?<br/>
<br/>
  Please don&#39;t tear apart my post, I am sure I worded much of it poorly. I<br/>
am<br/>
  feeling a bit sensitive and not sure I want to deal with harsh words right<br/>
  now. I need some unschooling encouragment and words of guidance. Thanks .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365212088">Hi Sheri:<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear about where you are at right now.  My husband was a <br/>
firefighter in the Military until 5 years ago and we were just <br/>
thinking how he won&#39;t get called as his reserve status was over 2 <br/>
years ago.  Then we began talking about all the brave people in NYC <br/>
who ran into those buildings to save others.  Especially this week it <br/>
seems that some of the stuff has been petty on the list, maybe a way <br/>
to vent frustration over the feeling of powerlessness and wondering <br/>
what on earth is God&#39;s plan with all this chaos going on.<br/>
<br/>
I know that for me each day is a new journey with my kids and the <br/>
unschooling way of life.  As I let go of old behaviors in my life <br/>
that don&#39;t work for me personally anymore I also let go of some of <br/>
the old behaviors I&#39;ve had with them.  I actually told Zak yesterday <br/>
that if he didn&#39;t stay close to me in the library I was going to put <br/>
him over my knee and smack his bum infront of everyone.   Instead of <br/>
telling him how scarey it is for me when he takes Max in his stroller <br/>
on a tour of the library and they are both out of my sight.  Learning <br/>
to be more honest with my kids will help me.  Later on in the day <br/>
when Max was down for his nap I sat Zak down and we talked about why <br/>
mummy had said what she said in the library.  He said &quot;but I can take <br/>
care of myself mummy.  IF anyone tries to hurt me I&#39;ll scream and <br/>
kick and run away&quot;.... Maybe that would work, but the thought of him <br/>
being abducted still lingers in my head.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one day at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
