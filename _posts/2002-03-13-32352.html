<div id="ygrps-yiv-7297576">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list and to unschooling. I&#39;m curious, does anyone have older <br/>
kids they home educate? Also, does anyone on this list have to be accountable <br/>
to the public school system?  How do you unschool and follow the high school <br/>
curriculum at the same time  ( required by the State Education Department in <br/>
NY) ? Plus, how do they write up the required reports to look &quot;schoolish&quot; ?<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143792250">I have older kids, but our regs here in Ohio are pretty loose.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have to provide anything other than a single composite test <br/>
score or a statement from a certified teacher that shows they are <br/>
working to the best of their abilities and age.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of reports do you have to write up?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a 14 year old boy who has always unschooled, but  I can&#39;t really <br/>
help you with the regs in your state.  We&#39;re with a public school program <br/>
in BC that basically leaves us alone.  We have to report 3 times a year, <br/>
but I just write a general, anecdotal statement of what he&#39;s been <br/>
doing.  The last report contained nothing &quot;academic&quot; at all.  (Well, I did <br/>
mention that we had discussed current events some.)  My kid is doing <br/>
&quot;vocational exploration&quot; this year.  (Means he&#39;s been working with his dad <br/>
a lot)  He&#39;s majored in P.E. since he was a little guy.  Academics?  No <br/>
way!  At least not yet.<br/>
