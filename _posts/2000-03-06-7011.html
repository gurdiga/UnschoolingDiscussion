&gt; Hi there Tina,<br/>
&gt; yes ...I was on that ca. list for a year but I found there were too many<br/>
&gt; posts coming through and that the vein of discussion was often a waste of<br/>
&gt; time for me (and off topic...but that was my opinion and not very welcome<br/>
&gt; so I never expressed it..others who did got their wrists slapped). I think<br/>
&gt; that there are loads of people who are very informed and some wise<br/>
&gt; home-schoolers on that list though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ha Ha, Brooke!  It&#39;s funny you brought the wrist slapping up ... there was just a very long, and actually quite interesting, thread about this this past week on homeschool-ca.  The gist of the discussion was that all of what came up on the list reflected people&#39;s reality in living life with their<br/>
children, and the learning that takes place with the whole mess of it.  The wrist slapping turned into a wonderful welcome to a new subscriber!<br/>
<br/>
(I actually subscribe to the digest, so for me the list is pretty manageable.)<br/>
<br/>
I have heard of the wonderful support for hs in the Kootenays (Nelson, in particular).  Glad you have that there.<br/>
<br/>
