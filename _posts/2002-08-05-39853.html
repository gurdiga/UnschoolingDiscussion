<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376784817">Twelfth Night was a medieval English holiday.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;?  It wasn&#39;t just for nothing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you go to google.com and look up Twelfth Night you&#39;ll need to add some <br/>
words to get a good set of hits (not all the words at once).  Try:<br/>
England<br/>
Christmas<br/>
winter holidays<br/>
traditions<br/>
king of the bean<br/>
<br/>
Gregorian calendar reform<br/>
<br/>
Be looking for mentions of &quot;old Christmas,&quot; which is a post-calendar-reform <br/>
term.  It&#39;s in an American version of an older ballad, The Wife of Usher&#39;s <br/>
Well:<br/>
<br/>
There was a lady, a lady so gay<br/>
And she had children three<br/>
She sent them away to the north country<br/>
To learn their gramaree, to learn their gramaree<br/>
<br/>
[and a few verses pass which aren&#39;t all that pleasant,<br/>
but she asks God for a miracle...]<br/>
<br/>
It was then Old Christmas Time<br/>
The nights were so long and cold<br/>
She looked and saw her three little babes<br/>
Come a-runnin&#39; down the hall...<br/>
<br/>
In the SE U.S. the immigrants were Protestant, and they were NOT big on the <br/>
miracles or the supernatural, but to distinguish the legal holiday Christmas <br/>
from &quot;REAL&quot; Christmas (when it would have fallen if the calendar hadn&#39;t been <br/>
adjusted), they said that the difference was that on &quot;Old&quot; Christmas, at <br/>
midnight, the animals would kneel and pray.<br/>
<br/>
I got off the topic, but if you go to www.google.com you will too!! And it <br/>
will be fun!!<br/>
