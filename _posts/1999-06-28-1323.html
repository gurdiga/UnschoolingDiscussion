<div id="ygrps-yiv-802078453"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;right, but he cant find the articles that give reasons why school is<br/>
&gt;better. all they do is put down homeschooling not prove their point. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is exactly the kind of politics that I hate.  &quot;So-and-so is a bad<br/>
choice because...&quot;  and every positive thing that they have to say about<br/>
themselves is merely a knee-jerk reaction to their own negative propoganda.<br/>
 They don&#39;t have anything to say about their own merits based on their job<br/>
qualifications, expereince, etc.  They can only say, &quot;I am better than they<br/>
are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is the same as the politics involved in Homeschooling versus Public<br/>
School and even School-at-Home versus Unschooling.  Who was it that said<br/>
that comparison is an evil thing?  Yes, it is good to know and remember the<br/>
problems with other methods that led us to choose Unschooling in the first<br/>
place.  But I try not to start throwing stones.  To each his own.  It is<br/>
our job to raise our children to be happy, productive members of society in<br/>
the best way that we know how.  Not to judge others for their choices and<br/>
condemn them for what we percieve as mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Just like religion, or anything else important, the issue of how we should<br/>
educate our children is very sensitive and emotionally charged.  There is<br/>
plenty of vehement rhetoric being slung back and forth.  Mostly though this<br/>
comes from the folks who are completely convinced of the indisputable FACT<br/>
that their way is the ONLY way, and they wish to force all others to live<br/>
and believe as they do.  Religions do this in the name of saving your soul<br/>
from your ignorance, anti-Unschoolers want to save your children from your<br/>
ignorance.  <br/>
<br/>
That is unfortunate.  I am of the belief, being an American and all ;-),<br/>
that Diversity makes the world go around.<br/>

kinds of people. I personally would have a tough time if everyone was like<br/>
me and did the same things.<br/>
