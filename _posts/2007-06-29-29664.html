Voice Chat Can Really Kill the Mood on WoW<br/>
06.19.07 | 2:00 Am<br/>
Recently I logged into World of Warcraft and I wound up questing  <br/>
alongside a mage and two dwarf warriors. I was the lowest-level  <br/>
newbie in the group, and the mage was the de-facto leader. He coached  <br/>
me on the details of each new quest, took the point position in  <br/>
dangerous fights and suggested tactics. He seemed like your classic  <br/>
virtual-world group leader: Confident, bold and streetsmart.<br/>
<br/>
But after a few hours he said he was getting tired of using text chat  <br/>
-- and asked me to switch over to Ventrilo, an app that lets gamers  <br/>
chat using microphones and voice. I downloaded Ventrilo, logged in,  <br/>
dialed him up and ...<br/>
<br/>
... realized he was an 11-year-old boy...<br/>
===================================================<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the beginning of a very, VERY interesting article on the  <br/>
disadvantages of hearing the other players&#39; voices, allowing for the  <br/>
possibility that younger players will not have those disadvantages as  <br/>
much as older players do.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine the differences if this list were by voice instead of text.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Liam had an experience like that when he was, in fact, 11.   He was <br/>
playing WoW with his level 40-something rogue guy and he had <br/>
partnered up with some other guy and they were meeting up frequently <br/>
on line to play.  Liam was fairly authoritative about the game and <br/>
knew and suggested what to do and where to go and all that.   (I know <br/>
this because most of the time I was right there with him at his <br/>
request to help him read and spell.)  It came up one time during <br/>
their informal non-game-related chatting that Liam was 11, and the <br/>
guy bowed out of their WoW relationship.  Why?  I do not know.  Maybe <br/>
he had kids in school Liam&#39;s age or something like that (strictly <br/>
conjecture  on my part; I know that one time he had to stop to &quot;get <br/>
dinner going,&quot; and while *I* used to have to do that as a teenager, I <br/>
got the impression that this guy was not a teenager).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Liam took it in his stride and didn&#39;t think twice about being <br/>
blown off for age discrimination despite having already proven <br/>
himself a worthy WoWer.  Funny.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; much as older players do.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It works both ways too.  I&#39;ve been in RPG&#39;s before and played quite <br/>
fine with other players until they find out I&#39;m an adult.  Then they <br/>
become scarce when you are around.  Sometimes you can tell by the way <br/>
they play and sometimes you can&#39;t, how old someone is.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille has never cared about how old someone is, as long as they play <br/>
good and treat others kind.  We&#39;ve used ventrillo a bit, and it really <br/>
does change things.  What I found the hardest is when you are with a <br/>
group and some have voice chat and some are texting.  The texters get <br/>
left out of the loop because people stop texting when they are <br/>
chatting.  I would say it way overpowers.  Some things I just don&#39;t <br/>
want to know about the people that I play games with.  I&#39;d rather just <br/>
assume things about them by what they say.<br/>
<br/>
I like the anonymous nature of texting.  However, it would be <br/>
interesting to hear people here talk, since I&#39;ve met some of you guys <br/>
at the Life is Good Conference, and elsewhere.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Way back in Olden Times, I was one of the volunteers who hosted <br/>
homeschooling chats on AOL.  My regular screen name was Felicitas, and <br/>
usually signed posts with my obviously female name.  During chats, <br/>
though, I had to use a screen name with a mandatory four-letter prefix, <br/>
so I had to abbreviate my name.  I chose the masculine of <br/>
Felicity/Felicitas, which is Felix.  It was interesting when new <br/>
chatters came in my room; they often thought I was a man.  I finally <br/>
realized this was happening when someone commented on how cool it was <br/>
that a homeschooling dad would volunteer to host a chat.  Even more <br/>
interesting was how those who thought I was male would treat me, <br/>
usually deferring to my opinion.  I would correct the misconception as <br/>
soon as I detected it, and the chatter would relax.<br/>

 <br/>
It could be simple discrimination that the man (or woman) didn&#39;t want to<br/>
keep playing with a kid (dumb huh?)  But I think there is a vague feeling<br/>
among adult players that there is something unacceptable about a 40 yo man<br/>
having an online relationship, even an innocent gaming one, to a young boy.<br/>
There might be a fear that he could be accused of being creepy or worse.<br/>
Also dumb imo but I think some people have that fear.<br/>
