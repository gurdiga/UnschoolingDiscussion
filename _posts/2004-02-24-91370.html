<div id="ygrps-yiv-16152767">Sarah had just sat down to watch Spirited Away again. I just realized that there is a &quot;luck dragon&quot; in the movie...Sarah noticed it too, and said &quot;Hey Mom, what&#39;s that other movie, with the boy in it, that&#39;s got one of those?&quot; And I said &quot;The Never Ending Story&quot; and remembered that the luck dragon&#39;s name was Falcor. <br/>
<br/>
So now she&#39;s wanting to look up luck dragons to find out more about the symbology (is that the right word?!) involved, and anything else she can find about it...after she&#39;s done watching Spirited Away. She wants us to rent Never Ending Story tonight when we return Spirited Away.<br/>
 <br/>
But we talked for a little while about the two movies, what we liked about them, what we hadn&#39;t...and she says &quot;I think it&#39;s neat that we both like the Luck Dragons!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Gosh..that was just a nice moment for us!!! <br/>
