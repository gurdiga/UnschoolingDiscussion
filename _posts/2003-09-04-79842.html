<div id="ygrps-yiv-953737272">And just as each person&#39;s priorities and universe-models are personal, I<br/>
guess even Peter Jackson has his own priorities.   One of them is visual.<br/>
<br/>
 My own direction of Lord of the Rings (in my head) had only the very<br/>
vaguest of visual pictures.  Very murky, beause the &quot;realness&quot; of the<br/>
characters for  me had to do with virtues and morals and knowledge and<br/>
growth.<br/>

This gets me to thinking about multiple intelligences. My &#39;dominant&#39;<br/>
intelligence is interpersonal, and I&#39;m thinking yours must be too. Do our<br/>
intelligences shape our vision of life around us? If they do, then each<br/>
person&#39;s &#39;reality&#39; is going to be different. So, what is real? Okay, I&#39;m<br/>
confusing myself now.  Where is Morpheus when you need him? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Julie, stopping to think about this a little more.( If you never hear from<br/>
me again, you&#39;ll know my brain imploded!)<br/>

I think it would be an amazing job to have, designing sets,  creating<br/>
miniworlds.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed watching the special features discs and seeing how much<br/>
attention to detail there was. They did a superb job of making Middle-earth<br/>
come alive. Finding out they made all the glasses, plates, goblets and so on<br/>
so that no-one watching would be able to say &quot;I have a set like that at<br/>
home&quot;. They built Hobbiton and established gardens a year before filming.<br/>
<br/>
How do you get work designing sets? Not that I need a job but...<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve usually thought language was my best thing (but I only know one, so it&#39;s <br/>
not that polyglot linguistic skill), but probably because &quot;interpersonal&quot; <br/>
wasn&#39;t legit &#39;til lately. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s real is that different people see the world differently.  My dad <br/>
always knew where the power source was for a house or machine, and was aware of all <br/>
waterlines under the ground.  If he didn&#39;t know where the lines were he <br/>
WANTED to know.<br/>
<br/>
In MY head, under the ground is just dirt, and manhole covers are some kind <br/>
of decoration, and I know I&#39;m wrong, but I don&#39;t have time or interest to map <br/>
the water supply and sewer pipes of my neighborhood in my head, let alone the <br/>
whole of the city or the state.<br/>
<br/>
I do tend to remember if people tell me they grew up Catholic and had all <br/>
brothers and was an Eagle scout.  That maps pretty easily.   &quot;Chicago,&quot; they <br/>
might say.  &quot;Polish?&quot; I might ask.  I&#39;ve never even been to Chicago, but I know <br/>
two guys my age who were, and both were Polish Catholic.  Their answers would <br/>
help me with my map of the U.S., which is more social than physical geography.   <br/>
As to how Chicago is supplied with electricity or drinking water and whether <br/>
they use natural gas, it never occurred to me to wonder until just now.  And <br/>
I&#39;m already through caring. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I scanned for significant bits, as who slew significant monsters (coming in <br/>

-=-Local theater. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but it&#39;s volunteer work, most likely, and would be assisting the set <br/>
people and carrying plywood around and painting cloth and stuff first, for a long <br/>
time, before &quot;design&quot; would come about.<br/>
<br/>
Puppet show sets/backgrounds/props would be a start.  Designing bedrooms to <br/>
look fancy ways would be related.  <br/>
<br/>
There are things that lead up and toward without being &quot;a job&quot; and they&#39;re <br/>
all things I&#39;m not good at, but I do see in my friends who have that skill.   <br/>
Window dressings in stores sometimes are REALLY creative, and other times just a <br/>
few mannequins looking bored.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914211236">Others have talked about starting by volunteering in community or local<br/>
theaters. Indeed I did get my start along those lines. I also studied<br/>
Architectural Drafting - something that you could do today using one of<br/>
the many computer programs if you didn&#39;t care for classes. After a<br/>
while, however, I found it was slow going and felt a lack in myself. I<br/>
ended up going to college and studying theater design and production,<br/>
the best part of which was learning Lighting Design from a marvelous<br/>
designer. I have been designing in theater for many years, but came to<br/>
Los Angeles to work in film in 1994. To get to work in the Art<br/>
Department, most people do start out by volunteering - or as they call<br/>
it &quot;interning&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
This is the most crucial and important piece of advice I will give to<br/>
anyone starting in film. Several young people whom I have mentored have<br/>
profited from it in a way I did not, since I didn&#39;t know or understand<br/>
this idea - having come from a different style of place. Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
            Volunteer to work on the biggest, most prestigious, highest<br/>
budget picture you can, even if you are doing the most menial and<br/>
trivial thing. If you are going to sweep someone&#39;s floor for free, you<br/>
might as well sweep Steven Spielberg&#39;s than Joe Shmo doing his graduate<br/>
thesis film at UCLA. You stay in the circles you start in.<br/>
<br/>
 When I began I had the incorrect notion, gleaned from some readings in<br/>
books about the film industry, that it was more important to be able to<br/>
express that you were a [insert head of department title], because you<br/>
would be locked into that. I expected that with hard work, an expanding<br/>
resume, and an increase in contacts, the pictures would get bigger. I<br/>
had the notion that as a big fish in the small pond, the pond would<br/>
grow. I found out that is not how it works for most of the time. What<br/>
happens, almost always is, that the director or producer who hired you<br/>
for their $500K project, talking all the time about the next film down<br/>
the line that would be a $4Mil pic, then hires someone who is already<br/>
working in the $4Mil milieu. Expect no gratitude. Even working for free<br/>
is dangerous, as you will continue to be called for free work by the<br/>
same people. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, in film the title Set Designer means the people who actually do the<br/>
drafting for the construction, sometimes including working drawings and<br/>
color rendering of the concept. A good set designer has a lot of input<br/>
in shape and details. For example the Art Director (to whom the Set<br/>
Designer reports) may say,                    &quot;We need a decorative<br/>
moulding to fill this wall&quot;, and the Set Designer will have the<br/>
opportunity to actually design the moulding, fitting in with<br/>
architectural style already conceived. However the concept of having<br/>
moulding, and choosing the style is done by the Production Designer.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is serious about working in the film business and would like<br/>
to profit from my mistakes is welcome to email me privately. I swear<br/>
that every one of the kids I have taken on have moved on from me very<br/>
quickly into real Union jobs, including being on an Emmy nominated team<br/>
at CBS.<br/>

<br/>
Though I stopped pursuing a career in theater during college, I <br/>
grew up around that industry and discovered that it really is true <br/>
that who you know is more important than what you know. <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Interesting and varied more than great - now I am Jayn&#39;s mother, which<br/>
is also all of the above. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Fashion Illustration - East Sydney Technical College<br/>
<br/>
Architectural Drafting - Sydney Technical College<br/>
<br/>
Bachelor of Creative Arts (Honours) - University of Wollongong (1990) -<br/>
major in Theatre Design and Technical Production, Minor Film Studies<br/>
(Faculty of Arts)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Australia is, or was in 1992 when I left, very different from US.<br/>
<br/>
Half way through my college degree fees were reintroduced (after 20<br/>
years of free education) for University attendance. When your income<br/>
reaches a certain point, you pay an additional 1 or 2 % in income tax to<br/>
discharge the debt. Needless to say, working in the arts, my income had<br/>
only a meagre chance of reaching the threshold. I still owe the<br/>
government about $4000. I remember the fight that was put up against the<br/>
idea of fees. I was paid a stipend by the government to study, since I<br/>
was low income before enrolling.<br/>
