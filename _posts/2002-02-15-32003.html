OK, so I need to vent here. Lets have some reality, there has to be a way<br/>
to make ends meet, and still remain committed to homeschooling our children.<br/>
Its great if your husband can handle everything fianancially. But here in the<br/>
real world thats not always possible, and lets talk about stress. There are<br/>
days when the money woes has almost taken me down, and if its affecting<br/>
me, than its affecting the children. When bill collectors call, it is a BIG <br/>
DEAL,<br/>
and I pray for anyone that has to answer the phone, and be humiliated.<br/>
I do have to work out of my home during the day, and homeschool.<br/>
And I am the only one in my Hs org. that is. So alas, I am the black<br/>
sheep. I also am unforgiving of the help-books that say to downsize<br/>
and not eat out, no drycleaning, etc.....HELLO! like I was living<br/>
the rich life before? Not!<br/>
Something has to be said for us that stay at home. We work very hard,<br/>
and yes, sometimes we do get stressed out trying to manage it all. Often,<br/>
we only have the lists like this in order to be heard and communicate.<br/>
I am worried about retirement, insurance, etc. I know what I am doing is<br/>
very important, the sacrifices that I may seem small but what happens<br/>
if I become so blind, I jepardize it all away?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>
