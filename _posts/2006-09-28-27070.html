<div id="ygrps-yiv-770105636">Okay, this isn&#39;t about a program to choose a phrase from a list and  <br/>
display it.<br/>
<br/>
This is about a generator of random phrases.  Maybe it&#39;s a person and  <br/>
maybe it&#39;s a &quot;pick two nouns&quot; program, but if any of you get e-mail  <br/>
spam about penny stocks and such, you&#39;ve seen them.<br/>
<br/>
This one came from Sadie Mendoza in Germany.  I like that all by  <br/>
itself.   But the weird subject to pass spam catchers was...<br/>

I think I&#39;d like to list that as my religion or maybe as my  <br/>
occupation from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s what priests do.  We heard a really brilliant priest at a  <br/>
wedding we attended in Southern New Mexico the other day.  He was  <br/>
saying wonderful things I had never heard.   But his job and his  <br/>
religion both are transforming God into a flow that others can  <br/>
perceive and accept.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could consider adopting the term  &quot;transistor&quot; as an  <br/>
adjective for homeschooling, instead of clinging to &quot;unschooling&quot;  <br/>
which confuses everyone who never heard the &quot;un Cola&quot; commercials of  <br/>
the 1970&#39;s, and causes arguments in France.   Could we think of  <br/>
ourselves as homeschool transistors?<br/>
<br/>
For those who read it (or think of) &quot;REsistors,&quot; we would be that, to  <br/>
them, anyway.<br/>
And for people who might say resistors only make a flow smaller, we  <br/>
could say &quot;If you go to Google and put in &#39;Can transistors amplify?&#39;  <br/>
you can read all about it.&quot;   That will be a good intro to google if  <br/>
they don&#39;t already use it.<br/>
Or we could follow with any of these amendments, to help their thinking:<br/>
  &quot;Okay, we&#39;re homeschool  inductors&quot; or  &quot;Homeschool amplifiers&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;homeschool op amps&quot; (Homeschool Boosters sounds so 1962/bakesale).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Homeschool transformers&quot;<br/>
YES!!   *Robots in disguise*!<br/>
      Transfomers, more than meets the eye--<br/>
      Transformers, robots in disguise.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe the old Transformers cartoon theme song would be as lost on  <br/>
younger moms as the &quot;uncola&quot; reference in &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If we think of our job as moms as helping transform the world into a  <br/>
flow that others can perceive and accept, what could be better?<br/>
And isn&#39;t learning itself taking information and transforming it into  <br/>
bits that can be absorbed by our system (our minds, memory and  <br/>
understanding?)<br/>
<br/>
And quite simply, not everyone has the capacity to do this.<br/>
