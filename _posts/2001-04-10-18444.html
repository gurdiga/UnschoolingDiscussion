<div id="ygrps-yiv-604110187">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am Julie.  I was a regular to this list at the end of last summer, but <br/>
could not keep up with all the mail.  However, a recent heated debate with my <br/>
best friend about the benifits of unschooling has led me back, to the place I <br/>
guess I really need to be.<br/>
<br/>
I have a four year old and an almost 2yr.  I volunteer with two parenting <br/>
organizations (seems to take up tons of time, but I enjoy doing it.)  <br/>
However, some (most) days I feel like I am not focusing enough on my children <br/>
and their play.  My thoughts are if I am not doing as much as I feel I should <br/>
now, will it be enough as they get older and unschooled?  Can anyone offer <br/>
their thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
Julie<br/>
<br/>
ps.  I had a successful VBAC to an 8lb 15oz boy almost two years ago.  I went <br/>
to the hospital pushing in the car, my hubby running red lights with the <br/>
homebirth midwife acting as a doula sitting between my legs.  I purposely <br/>
waited that long so I felt I had control over most of my labor.  Next baby <br/>
(if we are that lucky) is homebirth!</div>

 </span></blockquote>My kids are similar ages to yours. It&#39;s hard to find that balancing point,<br/>
isn&#39;t it! On one hand, I think that as parents we need to be available to<br/>
our children, but on the other hand I try not to be too child-focused or<br/>
child-centric. I&#39;m not sure that they need us to focus on their play, unless<br/>
they&#39;re asking us to play with them. Often at home, I&#39;m working on my own<br/>
stuff or I have the kids with me while I&#39;m doing something (my passions are<br/>
photography and I&#39;m also training for a triathlon) and I think that&#39;s great.<br/>
Kids need to see their parents pursuing their passions and having their own<br/>
interests, goals, and dreams. I also try to have time available to do things<br/>
like crafts where they need my help and/or supervision. A lot of their play<br/>
time is spent alone or with each other in imaginative play and that&#39;s great<br/>
too. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;ve spent too much time on my own focus and I<br/>
need to pull back and spend more time just hanging out with the kids.<br/>
Sometimes I feel like my own interests are getting neglected and I&#39;ve spent<br/>
too much kid-time and then I need to regain some of my own focus. Always a<br/>
balancing act, eh? I&#39;d say go with your own intuition - if you&#39;re feeling<br/>
like you&#39;re not spending enough time with them (or they&#39;re showing it via<br/>
their own frustration), then back off of your other activities for a while.<br/>
If not, carry on! I try to remember that the years when they are so young<br/>
and needy are short and few. Soon enough they will be wanting/needing time<br/>
to do their own thing. I try to treasure the moments I have to spend with<br/>
them.<br/>

Homebirth is awesome, I hope you get the chance to experience it!<br/>
