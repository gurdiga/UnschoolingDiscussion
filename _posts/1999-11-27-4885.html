&gt;&lt;&lt; Well, in our house the word is &quot;simplify.&quot;  And that is what we are doing! <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    We, or shall I say, I am too. I have carried so many bags of stuff out to <br/>
&gt;give to friends, good will, etc. Yet when I look around I see so much more <br/>
&gt;STUFF to go through and get rid of.     <br/>
&gt;    This has all started as a result of hsing and changing the way I look at <br/>
&gt;life and I am loving it and so is my dh. <br/>

simplify. DS was skeptical at first about donating his toddler toys and<br/>
books, but it didn&#39;t take long before he was letting go of a lot of things.<br/>
I think it helped to see the adults clearing out a lot of things as well.<br/>
That is how DH and I spent most of the day today: we put together about 16<br/>
bags of kid&#39;s clothing and small toys and my old clothing for charity. We<br/>
had already found homes for larger toys, and the library got the books and<br/>
videos. Tomorrow it&#39;s on to the closets! I just don&#39;t know how we have<br/>
accumulated so much stuff over the years.<br/>

&gt;This website has a pamphlet with ideas for &quot;simplifying the holiday&quot;.<br/>

schools and commercialism that reminded me of ds&#39;s Kindergarten year last<br/>
year. At every event, parent night or holiday concert, the kids stood at<br/>
the entrance to the classrooms handing out little bags of assorted coupons<br/>
and samples of household products. I was amazed and appalled. And they<br/>
always pushed the boxtops for education campaign also, so the kids were<br/>
looking for these cereals in the stores. Talk about indoctrinating future<br/>
consumers! <br/>
