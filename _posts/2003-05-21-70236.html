<div id="ygrps-yiv-272041828">A few years back we had a pretty active homeschool playgroup going,<br/>
alternating at different houses.  The kids did a lot of dress up and whoever<br/>
hosted always ended up with a pile of leftover socks, underwear, etc.<br/>
Several of us moms were in the same book club, and we would arrive and pass<br/>
the stuff back to the kid&#39;s mom.  &quot;here&#39;s Sierra&#39;s underwear&quot; &quot;here&#39;s<br/>
Gillian&#39;s sword&quot;.  It was pretty funny!<br/>
