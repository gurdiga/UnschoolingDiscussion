&gt; There are little wooden ocarinas too.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have one of the &quot;potato&quot; ocarinas from the 1970&#39;s.  Blue-glazed clay, <br/>
&gt; kinda <br/>
&gt; gourd-or-small-turnip shaped.  And I have a little rosewood ocarina that <br/>
&gt; hangs on a string around the neck, and a plastic knock-off of the rosewood <br/>
&gt; ones.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have one shaped like a penguin made of glazed porcelain.  There&#39;s a woman <br/>
near Portland who makes ocarinas in a zillion animal shapes.  I fell in love.  <br/>
She also sells cool little cheater songbooks.  www.eaglecrestarts.com  <br/>
<br/>
While we&#39;re on the subject of music, I wanted to say that I&#39;ve finally gotten <br/>
around to learning piano.  (We discussed adult unschooling instruments a year <br/>
or so ago, at my request.)  I jump started my learning with a class offerred <br/>
at our community center called &quot;Instant Piano for Hopelessly Busy People.&quot;  3 <br/>
hours, 1 day, $45, didn&#39;t stand to lose much so I did it, even if it sounded <br/>
like an infomercial.<br/>
<br/>
It was perfect for me:  I can read treble clef and knew how to pick out tunes <br/>
with my right hand and this class taught chord style piano and taught how to <br/>
play chords with your left hand.  So now I can figure out how to play things <br/>
out of fake books, I&#39;m learning new chords little by little.  I sit down for a <br/>
few minutes here and there and play.  I&#39;m very patient with myself and very <br/>
apprecieative of my progress. <br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m still in awe of the fact that there are so many people who can play this <br/>
instrument that requires you to do different things with each hand , without <br/>
really looking at your hands, while reading a foreign language (music).  I <br/>
learned to play violin as a kid and I guess I did two different things with two <br/>
different hands while reading music too, but piano seems more complicated <br/>
somehow.<br/>

hard to just look at a chord and play it the way I can look at one note and <br/>
play it.  I guess you just end up memorizing the way the different chords <br/>
look written out, the way you memorize single notes and where they are on <br/>
the keyboard.  I had a really neat book out of the library once, but I&#39;ve <br/>
never been able to get it again.  I think it was called The Way of the <br/>
Hand.  I think it was jazz-oriented, and the idea was to connect the way <br/>
the chords looked on the page with the way the hand looked and felt playing <br/>
the chords.<br/>
<br/>
I was always in awe of my grandfather, who could sight-read almost anything <br/>
at speed.  He could even sight-read an orchestral score and pick out the <br/>
most important parts to play.<br/>

<br/>
Piano&#39;s cool, though, because with four fingers you can make FOUR NOTES!!!  <br/>
With recorder it can take seven or eight fingers to make ONE note!<br/>
<br/>
Piano just seems much more energy efficient. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
