I didn&#39;t go to that one, but I went to the 2003 one.<br/>
<br/>
It was awesome.  Really.   To be with so many other unschoolers was such an<br/>
amazing experience.  Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
We drove down from Minnesota, to South Carolina.  It was so worth it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids comments about going this year,  &quot;we ARE going!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be there again.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link for this year&#39;s:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/</a><br/>

Sandra, I take it your broken leg occurred AT the conference? I had tears in my eyes reading about Marty speaking out in your place at the conference. What an incredible moment!<br/>

I was on my way to where I was going to speak, in about 15 minutes.  I had my <br/>
notes and the things for the auction.     VERY very frustrating to think <br/>
about even now.<br/>
