&gt;<br/>
&gt;People do NOT need to learn math the way it is taught in schools.  In fact,<br/>
&gt;they don&#39;t need to &quot;learn math&quot; at all.  Math is INSEPERABLE from most<br/>
&gt;everything else in life, and if you live a full life, you&#39;ll learn all the<br/>
&gt;math you need because you need it.  It&#39;s there.  It&#39;s part of everything.<br/>
&gt;You couldn&#39;t escape it if you tried really hard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;SOME people will love it and get interested and want to pursue things to a<br/>
&gt;deeper level and learn more advanced math and do all sorts of cool things<br/>
&gt;with it.  MOST won&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. Most people don&#39;t need math the way it&#39;s taught in schools. I <br/>
suppose you need that only if you want to become a mathematician or a <br/>
physicist and want to communicate your ideas with your colleagues. Then <br/>
you need a common language.<br/>
<br/>
I loved math when I was in school, and I even thought I wanted to become <br/>
a physicist, but later on I changed my mind and studied English <br/>
Literature instead! Go figure...<br/>
My second major was music, which I think has a lot to do with math, but <br/>
in a very practical way. No need to write divisions on paper, or <br/>
anything like that. You need to understand the language in order to make <br/>
music or write music so that others can read it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s how I see math, as a language. The way it&#39;s taught in <br/>
school it is mostly used to separate so-called intelligent kids from <br/>
so-called dumb ones. It serves the school system and the political <br/>
agendas in order... Divide and you will conquer. It&#39;s not just math, of <br/>
course, but it&#39;s well intertwined with other values and myths within the <br/>
system.<br/>

because they can grasp the why from the what. Most people can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Or they don&#39;t much care about the why, only the what. I was really good in<br/>
math in school. It was like puzzles to me. But I was pretty lost when I got<br/>
to engineering and had to *apply* the math I&#39;d learned. I really hadn&#39;t a<br/>
clue because I didn&#39;t understand why. But I sure could solve the problem if<br/>
someone set it up for me!<br/>
