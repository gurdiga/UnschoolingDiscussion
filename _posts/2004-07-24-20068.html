<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879326447">I think the words we use are important to ourselves and those around us -<br/>
they set the stage so to speak.  In the emails I have read -  &quot;it&#39;s non<br/>
negotiable&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s not an option&quot;.   Those types of lay down the law<br/>
statements really set others up to feel and act defensively.  It shuts down<br/>
any hope of finding solutions and having open communications.    <br/>
<br/>
What works for us is to share how we are feeling, be genuine and not<br/>
defensive and be open to hearing the same from others (spouse, children,<br/>
etc.)   I have found when I explain why something is so important to me, my<br/>
children get it and respect it.  I believe that is because they know they<br/>
will get the same treatment from me.    I think this goes back to our<br/>
discussion a month ago about choices.  There is *always* a choice, many in<br/>
fact.   And I choose to be positive and happy and work with in that frame<br/>
work to find solutions.   My dds are amazing at finding alternatives that<br/>
work for all of us.  They are endlessly creative and very respectful of my<br/>
needs and each other&#39;s needs.   <br/>
<br/>
So for me, it&#39;s not about TCS or anything like that, it is just about<br/>
respecting each other and trying to live together in harmony.  Sounds<br/>
cheesy I guess but it works for us.  <br/>

Doesn&#39;t sound at all cheesy to me.<br/>
I don&#39;t think we need new vocabulary to treat our children as kindly and <br/>
respectfully as we treat our adult friends.  We don&#39;t need to have a special <br/>
philosophy to acknowledge that it&#39;s their house too, not just ours.<br/>
