<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062454322">Hi everyone,<br/>
I am helping my son Eric with WOW, and he saw a guide that he would <br/>
like to buy. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wowhobbs.blogspot.com/">http://www.wowhobbs.blogspot.com/</a> Can someone tell me how <br/>
I can find out if it is worth the money, or if there is somewhere else <br/>
that I can ask the question? There seems to be so much information out <br/>
there about WOW, I just want to make sure it is worth the money. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57441254">Hi Amie<br/>
My son Jackson (13) checked out the site, and says it doesn&#39;t look good, and wants you to know that &#39;power leveling&#39; in the game is illegal...for the game...<br/>
Now, I have no idea what that means, but evidently he does..LOL <br/>
He says if Eric wants ANY help, to contact him, he&#39;d love to help him...<br/>
By the way, How old is he??  <br/>
Email me privately and I&#39;ll give you the email address for my son...<br/>
Hope I helped..LOL<br/>

I don&#39;t think the book is really that necessary, I&#39;m a level 67 mage.  My son and daughter agree, (level 70 hunter and 70 druid).    We use Allakhazam.com  a lot.  It can give you lots of tips as far as quests and other info too--weapons, maps, armor.

<br/>
Yet, if my son really wanted the book and he thought it might help him,  I&#39;d get it for him :)  We&#39;ve bought other guide books for other games and he&#39;s read them through and they have assisted him.  We just haven&#39;t for this game.<br/>
<br/>
I did see when I googled it that some people have been really happy with it.  I think it would probably make leveling easier, less searching, less grinding.(killing monsters over and over)<br/>
<br/>
Happy WoWing!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511539255">Kirby&#39;s advice on the question of a player&#39;s guide is this:<br/>
<br/>
Tell them that they can get the official players guide if they -need-  <br/>
a book. The best website for information like this is called  <br/>
www.Wowhead.com.<br/>
