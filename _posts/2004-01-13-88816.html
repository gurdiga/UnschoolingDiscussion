<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031404548">I have learned so much from this list!  It really challenges me and <br/>
makes me think and I could use some input here!<br/>
 <br/>
I have concerns about my 2nd child.  He will be 10 years old in May <br/>
and he has autism.  I&#39;ve been unschooling him since July.  Before <br/>
this, we were doing &#39;school at home&#39;, albeit even then in a relaxed <br/>
fashion.  When we had Jonathan diagnosed, they tested his IQ at 88 <br/>
and he&#39;s been consistently at a 1st/2nd grade level since around the <br/>
age of 7.<br/>
 <br/>
Since we&#39;ve been unschooling, his attitude has improved tenfold.  He <br/>
no longer has emotional meltdowns and seems SOOO much happier!!  I <br/>
could tell that I had been pressuring him to &#39;catch up&#39; and that <br/>
this was doing more harm than good.  Hence the decision to just &#39;let <br/>
it go&#39;.<br/>
 <br/>
He is very artistic and loves to draw.  He loves to play board <br/>
games, so I have no real concerns about his math skills, as I can <br/>
see that coming on its own, just through curiosity and play.<br/>
 <br/>
My concern with him is in the area of reading and pessimism.  <br/>
Before, when I was doing &#39;school at home&#39;, we worked through a <br/>
phonics curriculum, and he did well with the decoding thing, but he <br/>
still does not read. <br/>
 <br/>
He has the attitude of &#39;I can&#39;t read.&#39;  and  &#39;I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
read.&#39;  Even though, from last year, when we were doing school at <br/>
home, I know he *can* read.  <br/>
 <br/>
For instance, today he brought a popsicle stick to me with a joke on <br/>
it and said, &quot;I can&#39;t read this.&quot;  The words were all simple, save <br/>
for one word and that was &#39;digital&#39;.  So I said, &quot;Is it just this <br/>
word here?  That word is &#39;digital&#39;&quot;  And then, with prompting on my <br/>
part, he read the rest of the joke with ease.<br/>
 <br/>
But his initial attitude was &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;  Is there any way that I can <br/>
help him with this attitude?  In other words, if he has the attitude <br/>
of &quot;I can&#39;t read,&quot; will that ever change on its own?  Or has the <br/>
proverbial damage already been done?  Will he ever become a reader <br/>
if he thinks he is not, or can&#39;t be, or, maybe even never will be <br/>
able to become a reader?<br/>
 <br/>
And is it better for me to encourage him to sound words out and, <br/>
therefore, figure it out?  Or is it better for me to read it for him <br/>
and ignore the &#39;pessimistic&#39;, &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; attitude?<br/>
 <br/>
Btw...he doesn&#39;t like to be read to.  He never has.  He has auditory <br/>
sensitivity issues and I really think that being read to was <br/>
almost &#39;painful&#39; for him in a way, as he is easily overwhelmed by <br/>
auditory stimuli.<br/>
 <br/>
Any and all advice would be most welcome!!!  And if there is anyone <br/>
on this list unschooling a special needs child, I would LOVE to hear <br/>
from you!!  I have yet to meet anyone, either in &#39;real life&#39; or <br/>
online, who is unschooling an autistic child, or any child on <br/>
the &#39;autism spectrum&#39;.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393222931">***Will he ever become a reader if he thinks he is not, or can&#39;t be, or,<br/>
maybe even never will be <br/>
able to become a reader?***<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  He&#39;ll see words everywhere and he&#39;ll begin recognizing lots of them<br/>
and he&#39;ll eventually think differently about himself.  <br/>
<br/>
***And is it better for me to encourage him to sound words out and,<br/>
therefore, figure it out? ***<br/>
<br/>
No, that&#39;s discouraging if the words are already giving him trouble. <br/>
When he comes to you for help, tell him the word.   <br/>
<br/>
***Or is it better for me to read it for him and ignore the<br/>
&#39;pessimistic&#39;, &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; attitude?***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, read as much as you can and he enjoys.  If he says, &quot;I can&#39;t read&quot;<br/>
you can say &quot;someday you will&quot; and leave it at that.  <br/>
<br/>
***Btw...he doesn&#39;t like to be read to.  He never has.  He has auditory <br/>
sensitivity issues and I really think that being read to was <br/>
almost &#39;painful&#39; for him in a way, as he is easily overwhelmed by <br/>
auditory stimuli.***<br/>
<br/>
My young nephew is like this and his mom reads to him while he sits under<br/>
a big silk scarf.  He touches it and pulls it over himself and wraps up<br/>
in it while she reads softly.  <br/>
<br/>
He likes to put his hands in warm soapy water and play while she reads to<br/>
him.   Something about the physical contact of something pleasant while<br/>
hearing someone reads appeals to him.  She reads to him while he&#39;s in the<br/>
bathtub. <br/>
<br/>
She reads while the fan is on.  <br/>
