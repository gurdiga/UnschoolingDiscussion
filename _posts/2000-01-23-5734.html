<div id="ygrps-yiv-309758518">Science Buffs, Are you there?<br/>
I got this e-mail today and think it sounds pretty ridiculous.  I pulled<br/>
out the book that came with my microwave oven (installed in 1994, book<br/>
written in 1991).  It says that 2:30 at high power can be used to heat a<br/>
cup of water for coffee, tea, or hot chocolate.  There are no precautions<br/>
anywhere related to the following e-mail.<br/>
Maybe the warning should be: Don&#39;t stick your face close to something<br/>
that just came out of the microwave oven!  (My apologies to the following<br/>
party if this is true!)<br/>

Subject: Microwaving Water Caution<br/>
I feel that the following is information that anyone who uses a microwave<br/>
oven to heat water should be made aware of.  About five days ago my<br/>
26-year old son decided to have a cup of instant coffee.  He took a cup<br/>
of water and put it in the microwave to heat it up (something that he had<br/>
done numerous times before).  I am not sure how long he set the timer for<br/>
but he told me he wanted to bring the water to a boil. When the timer<br/>
shut<br/>
the oven off, he removed the cup from the oven.  As he looked into the<br/>
cup he noted that the water was not boiling but instantly the water in<br/>
the cup &quot;blew up&quot; into his face. The cup remained intact until he threw<br/>
it out of his hand but all the water had flew out into his face due to<br/>
the buildup of energy.  His whole face is blistered and he has 1st and<br/>
2nd degree<br/>
burns to his face which may leave scarring.  He also may have lost<br/>
partial sight in his left eye.   While at the hospital, the doctor who<br/>
was attending to him stated that this a fairly common occurrence and<br/>
water (alone) should never be heated in a microwave oven.  If water is<br/>
heated in this manner, something  should be placed in the cup to diffuse<br/>
the energy such as a wooden stir stick, tea bag, etc. It is however a<br/>
much safer choice to boil the water in a tea kettle.  Please pass this<br/>
information on to friends and family. (Mike J<br/>
Tucker, Safety/Security Officer)<br/>
This sounds like an urban legend but it isn&#39;t. The issue is that a very<br/>
clean cup has no nucleation points to initiate the boiling, and the water<br/>
can become superheated beyond the usual boiling point. If mechanically<br/>
disturbed in this state, like inserting a spoon or adding your cocoa mix,<br/>
all of the stored energy can be released all at once. Not all the<br/>
water turns to steam, only a small fraction, but it can throw the<br/>
remaining hot water a significant distance.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t believe it when I read this message.  The same <br/>
thing happened to me a few months ago when I was heating <br/>
water for instant oatmeal.  The box does say to either pour <br/>
boiling water into the oatmeal or to put water and oatmeal <br/>
together and microwave it - I guess now we know why.  <br/>
Anyway I lifted the cup out of the microwave and peeked to <br/>
see if it was boiling.  The whole thing blew clear to the <br/>
ceiling and I was covered with hot water.  Miraculously I <br/>
wasn&#39;t burned - but it scared the snot out of me!  I <br/>
thought it was just one of those weird things that just <br/>
happen to me, but no, there&#39;s actually scientific <br/>
evidence.  This has the makings of a science as well as a <br/>
safety lesson!<br/>

I boil water for tea in a microwave, and sometimes when I&#39;ve let it go too<br/>
long, putting the teabag into the water causes a boilover that loses half<br/>
the water.<br/>

this phonomena occurs.  The water needs something to make it form air<br/>
pockets to boil.  When heated in a microwave, the microwaves do not always<br/>
allow this to occur.  Thus, the water is heated above boiling temp. without<br/>
boiling.  When you remove the cup of wahter the disturbance causes bubles<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656571391">It&#39;s not anything special about microwaves. The phenomenon is called<br/>
superheating and can occur when a liquid is rapidly heated above its boiling<br/>
temp (a lack of nucleation causes this, normally a liquid reaches an<br/>
equilibrium and cannot be heated above its boiling temp as the excess heat<br/>
energy is consumed by converting the liquid to a gas).<br/>
<br/>
In the lab, &quot;boiling chips&quot; are often added to beakers to prevent &quot;bumping.&quot;<br/>
Most people never notice this effect on regular stoves because the metal<br/>
surfaces of pots and pans are rough and provide nucleation sites. People are<br/>
more likely to use glass or glazed ceramics in microwaves. I have seen the<br/>
same effect while heating liquids in test tubes or beakers with both<br/>
electric heating elements and open flames (bunsen burner).<br/>
<br/>
Note that this produces explosive boiling, not an &quot;explosion&quot; like a bomb.<br/>
Think of it as sudden, violent boiling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063177067">Sounds like someone with too much time on their hands as their &quot;science&quot;<br/>
language is drivel.  &quot;Nucleate&quot; is &quot;the have, act as or use a nuceus.&quot; <br/>
And, basic chemistry would tell you that the water molecule has one there<br/>
for does not need something else to act as one.  Also, I&#39;ve worked in<br/>
hospitals for years and never saw such a case.  Thinking maybe I was out of<br/>
the circle for too long, I called all three of ours and none had ever heard<br/>
of such a thing.  They had, however, heard of folks playing chemistry type<br/>
games with water, etc. (trying to change the boiling point by adding things<br/>
to water, etc.) have things blow up INSIDE the microwave usually or have<br/>
the things work and then scald the sh*t out of themselves because they<br/>
didn&#39;t have sense enough to use oven mits.<br/>
