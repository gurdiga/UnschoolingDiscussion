then immediately read the archives.<br/>

P.S.:   don&#39;t go all paranoid.     Pretty big task to read archives in<br/>
entirety :-).   But do remember that at any time there may be more<br/>
listmembers lurking than the total you have seen posts from.     So while<br/>
these communities can indeed be very supportive and one can make friends,<br/>
you must remember that the listeï¿½w[elf is pretty accessible to anyone<br/>
wanting to listen in.</div>
