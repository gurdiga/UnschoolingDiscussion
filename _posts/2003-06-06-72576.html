 </span></blockquote> One of the major reasons I took my kids out of ps was because of the way my  <br/>
11 yo was treated by the other students.  They were downright mean and rude.  <br/>
Others ( including my own parents) told me that he needed to &quot;deal with it, <br/>
get used to it, toughen up&quot;  etc etc.  My mom said.. &quot;there will always been <br/>
mean people in the world, we just have to learn to live with it&quot;  Well, I did <br/>
not agree.  This was before I even found out about unschooling.   I knew in my <br/>
heart that things are NOT just black and white.  We do NOT have to &quot;just deal <br/>
with it&quot;  or, rather, there is more than one way to &quot;deal with it&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
   Yes, we come in contact with rude and mean folks in our every day life.   <br/>
A rude person at the store, a bully child in play group, a condescending <br/>
waiter, on and on and on.  We deal with them in an individual basis and take each <br/>
situation and try to find a solution.  Sometimes it&#39;s just ignoring the person. <br/>
 Sometimes it&#39;s countering back with kindness and understanding.  Sometimes <br/>
it is assertively taking a stand and demanding better treatment.   But, the big <br/>
difference I see in these situations is, they are temporary.  We do not have <br/>
to stay in a situation that involves rudeness day in and day out.     If a <br/>
cashier at a particular store is rude every time I go in that store.. I will stop <br/>
shopping there, or at least avoid her line.   There ARE solutions to dealing <br/>
with rudeness, and sometimes it means we take ourselves out of the situation.  <br/>
 Our time is too precious and our life too important to have to &quot;tolerate&quot; <br/>
ongoing rudeness from others in our lives. <br/>
