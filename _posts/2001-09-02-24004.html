 </span></blockquote>no father at all has to be better.  I grew up in an addicted family, mother <br/>
is an alcoholic, albeit functioning and father was (he died 13 years ago) a <br/>
sex addict... For those of you unclear on sexual addiction (the biggest <br/>
addiction we actually have in this country that&#39;s not talked about.... just <br/>
look at Bill Clinton)... Sex addiction can be anything from masturbation, <br/>
voyerismn, multiple sexual partners, rape, abuse, reading porno on the <br/>
internet, in magazines, in porn stores,... it&#39;s about getting a &quot;high&quot; <br/>
feeling from the act of being involved with something sexual.... Just wanted <br/>
to clarify what it is...<br/>
<br/>
My mother wasn&#39;t available emotionally, although she was there physically and <br/>
my father wasn&#39;t available in all ways.<br/>
<br/>
The chances of children becoming either addicts or codependents are extremely <br/>
high if they are exposed to this behavior in the people that raise them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t advocate single parents and my belief is that children need role <br/>
models of each sex for a physically, emotionally, spiritually and mentally <br/>
healthy upbringing.  However, one non-addcited person is better than one <br/>
non-addicted and one addicted together.  <br/>
<br/>
I speak from the painful experience of recovering from drug and alcohol <br/>
addiction myself 15 years ago.  Addiction is not something I wanted my <br/>
children to experience first hand.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i guess i should&#39;ve clarified a bit more. my ex will not be living in the <br/>
home. before he went in to rehab i told him he wasn&#39;t to call here at all, <br/>
and i began refusing him to talk to ds because i never knew if he was <br/>
straight or not. and while his calls seemed to please ds in the short run, <br/>
he&#39;d go through an extremely emotional period after the calls.<br/>
<br/>
so, for a 3.5 yr old boy, is not allowing this contact properly protective or <br/>
over controlling?<br/>
