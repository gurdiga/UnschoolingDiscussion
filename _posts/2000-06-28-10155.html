 </span></blockquote>You are conveniently leaving out the bit about feminism being the root of<br/>
this daycare scourge upon our planet. That&#39;s what I objected to. I find that<br/>
attitude shortsighted and an overgeneralization. I haven&#39;t heard anyone on<br/>
this list say that they, personally, put their children in daycare for 10<br/>
hours a day. I think you&#39;ll find that we agree more than disagree. But the<br/>
venom towards working mothers disturbs me. Keep your children home. Mine are<br/>
home. Who here has condemned that? Please show me.<br/>
