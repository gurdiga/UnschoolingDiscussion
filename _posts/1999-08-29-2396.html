<div id="ygrps-yiv-690383404">FYI - Did you all know this?  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true - but just in case<br/>
it seemed worth passing on.<br/>
<br/>
DIAL 90#<br/>
This is scary to think that our kids are answering the phones. important,<br/>
please read.<br/>
 This can happen at home and at work, everyone should be aware...I&#39;ve sent<br/>
this to all my friends last Friday night and I&#39;ve already had 3 email me and<br/>
say that it&#39;s already happened to them.<br/>
I received a telephone call from an individual identifying himself as an<br/>
AT&T Service Technician that was running a test on our telephone lines. He<br/>
stated that to complete the test we should touch nine (9), zero (0), pound<br/>
sign (#) and hang up.  Luckily, we were suspicious and refused.<br/>
Upon contacting the telephone company we were informed that by pushing<br/>
90# you end up giving the individual that called you access to your<br/>
telephone<br/>
line and allows them to place a long distance telephone call, with the<br/>
charge<br/>
appearing on your telephone bill.<br/>
 We were further informed that this scam has been originating from many of<br/>
the local jails/prisons.  I have verified with UCB Telecomm. that this<br/>
actually happens.<br/>
I called GTE Security this morning and verified that this is definitely<br/>
possible and DO NOT press 90# for ANYONE.  It will give them access to your<br/>
phone line to make long distances calls ANYWHERE!!!!  The GTE Security<br/>
department told me to go ahead and share this information with EVERYONE I<br/>
KNOW!!!<br/>
Could you PLEASE pass this on.  If you have mailing lists and/or<br/>
newsletters from organizations you are connected with, I encourage you to<br/>
include this information.<br/>
