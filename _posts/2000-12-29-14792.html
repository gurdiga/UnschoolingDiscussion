<div id="ygrps-yiv-352821219">the best<br/>
talks come at times when you aren&#39;t staring too<br/>

Wow! An epiphany if ever there was one! I have 3 boys,<br/>
the oldest is 7. I have been having such a tough time<br/>
with my relationship with him. He seems so far away<br/>
all the time- from me, not everyone else. I guess I am<br/>
trying way to hard to get him to relate to me the way<br/>
I want him to, not the way he needs to.<br/>

&gt; Hi, Carol --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t realize their ages.  I tend to assume that<br/>
&gt; everyone must have a 6<br/>
&gt; year old, because I do. &lt;g&gt;  Also, I probably<br/>
&gt; underestimate how much older<br/>
&gt; kids actually &quot;need&quot; their mother when she&#39;s busy<br/>
&gt; weeding.  Certainly yours<br/>
&gt; are old enough to make their own sandwiches and tie<br/>
&gt; their own shoes &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; which are the things that I get interrupted for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You know, having you deeply involved in weeding does<br/>
&gt; create a great time<br/>
&gt; for them to come out and talk to you.  With older<br/>
&gt; kids, I&#39;ve heard the best<br/>
&gt; talks come at times when you aren&#39;t staring too<br/>
&gt; intently into each others<br/>

subject....I suggest &quot;Boys Will Be Men&quot; by Paul Kivel,<br/>
&quot;Real Boys: rescueing Our Sons from The Myths of<br/>
Boyhood&quot;, There is another one written by a women that<br/>
debunks the myth that women/mothers aren&#39;t capable of <br/>
raising thier sons(I look it up later).  That somehow<br/>
at some magic time mothers need to get out of the way.<br/>
<br/>
There are few other books out there by Michael Gurian<br/>
(sp?)that are kind of popular but I didn&#39;t like them<br/>
because he seemed to think mothers needed to get out<br/>
of the way and turn their sons over into the world of<br/>
men. I am thinking here what bunk.  Don&#39;t we live in a<br/>
world of Men AND Women.<br/>
<br/>
What I like about the first three books I recommended<br/>
as they really get into how culture shapes our view of<br/>
our children&#39;s gender and who they should and the<br/>
social pressures boys face. These books spoke to me<br/>
about my son as &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; by Mary Pipher<br/>
spoke to me about my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
You can take my advice with a grain of salt. I am just<br/>
a we bit femenist. I also think our culture sucks for<br/>
both boys and girls. And I am a mother who reads just<br/>
too darn much about everything. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13859931">Another really good book,(so far, 1/2 way thru it), is Raising Cain- <br/>
Protecting the emotional life of boys, by Dan Kindlon,PH.D. and Michael <br/>
Thompson,PH.D.<br/>
I actually found it at Walmart, very inexpensive too.<br/>
Has anyone else read this book? I have found it extremely valuable in <br/>
understanding my son ( I only have one and 2 girls).<br/>
Hope everyone had the happiest of holidays!<br/>

use it all the time for hanging up pictures, etc...<br/>
the kids take alot of pride in asking me &quot;mom, where&#39;s<br/>

&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt;own hammer and saw before I was 5 and helped my dad<br/>
&gt; work on motorcycles.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This brought back a blast from the past.  A cartoon,<br/>
&gt; published in Ms.<br/>
&gt; Magazine years ago.  A little girl holdind a wrench<br/>
&gt; in each hand, but<br/>
&gt; making them &quot;talk&quot; to each other and one is saying<br/>
&gt; &quot;Yes, Ken, I would love<br/>
&gt; to go to the prom with you.&quot;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S. (I&#39;ve been doing a lot of home repairs<br/>
&gt; recently, and wish that I had<br/>
&gt; spent less of my childhood playing Barbie and spent<br/>
&gt; more time hammering. <br/>
&gt; However, I am in my element at Home Depot, because I<br/>
&gt; sure can wield a<br/>
&gt; shopping cart!)<br/>
