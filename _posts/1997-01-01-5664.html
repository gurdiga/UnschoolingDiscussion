<div id="ygrps-yiv-278554310">Hi Kerry<br/>
<br/>
After 13 years of homeschooling I feel far less threatened by questioners<br/>
than in the first few years. Take away the sick feeling in my stomach - what<br/>
do I say? what will they think if I give a &#39;bad&#39; answer? - and I find I am<br/>
able to judge very quickly whether the person is actually genuinely<br/>
interested, but lacking understanding of what homeschooling is about, or if<br/>
they are just saying something to fill an empty space, or if they are<br/>
antagonistic to homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So, if they are in the first category (rare) I explain nicely.<br/>
<br/>
If they are in either of the other categories, I would say something like:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1.  &quot;What curriculum do you use?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.  &quot;What do you do all day?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enjoy life with my children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.  &quot;Do you work from home while the kids school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4.  &quot;I thought I saw you at the park yesterday.  Are you on a break?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5.  And, my personal favorite, &quot;When are you going to put the kids back<br/>
&gt; in school again?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not. (maybe adding - &#39;When are you going to take yours out?&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
Keep it to the minimum. These questions are almost always in the same class<br/>
as &#39;how are you?&#39; and if you&#39;ve ever responded to that question with details<br/>
of your haemorrhoids, or your herpes virus, you&#39;ll understand what I&#39;m<br/>
saying. They really don&#39;t want to know. And if you&#39;ve misread them, they&#39;ll<br/>
ask more questions, so you&#39;ll know that they are really in the interested<br/>
but misguided category.<br/>
<br/>
BTW my all time most hated question is &#39;Are you sure you are doing the best<br/>
thing for your children?&#39;. The arrogance. I&#39;ve been asked this a number of<br/>
times and after the first time I have responded brightly &#39;Oh no, I know it&#39;s<br/>
really bad for them, in fact I make it as unpleasant as possible for them, I<br/>
mean it really hurt giving birth so I figure I owe them a lot of agony for<br/>
that, I like them to really suffer, oh no it isn&#39;t best for them, but it<br/>
sure makes me feel better to see them suffer....etc. etc.....&#39; This draws an<br/>
instant apology and is usually followed by some well considered questions,<br/>
and a far greater interest in homeschooling than was there before!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 <br/>
 See what I mean!!  Thanks in advance for an &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok -- are you trying to blow these people off, let them know how rude you <br/>
think they are, actually answer the questions, educate them to possibilities <br/>
they might not know about, a blend of the above, none of the above.  I find <br/>
these questions can take a lot of energy but sometimes, rarely, the <br/>
conversation is actually worth it.<br/>
<br/>
So:  <br/>
<br/>
1.  We do not follow a strict curriculum.  It is not required in our state.  <br/>
One can, of course, puchase a pre-packaged curr.  I have check on what the <br/>
state standards are for the public schools and feel that these are so <br/>
pathetic that I have no fear that we are doing at least that much (in our <br/>
sleep).  This last is usually met with vigorous nods from anyone with a child <br/>
in ps.  My experience only of course.  <br/>
<br/>
If this does not fully satisfy the questioner, there is usually an actual <br/>
conversation about how different families do things and how each child has <br/>
different needs and rates and methods of learning.  Etc etc etc.  <br/>
<br/>
2.  I have never been asked this -- what a stupid question.  Anyone who is <br/>
home with two kids knows what you do all day -- you never sit -- except for <br/>
now typing on the computer.  Are they asking about your schedule or just not <br/>
comfortable being with their kids for that much of the day?  I am confused by <br/>
the question and would probably laugh and say, well, we&#39;re very busy, what do <br/>
you mean??<br/>
<br/>
3.  I do work part-time, handling the billing/banking/payroll for my <br/>
husband&#39;s biz -- all that admin stuff that he can&#39;t stand -- at least we&#39;re <br/>
not paying someone else to do it.  Yes, the kids now know how to use the <br/>
little pneumatic tube at the bank!<br/>
<br/>
4.  Really, we missed you -- were you there?  Another odd question.  I would <br/>
say we must have been playing tennis, or basketball, or kite flying, or <br/>
whatever it was we were doing.  The kids had a ball!<br/>
<br/>
5.  I say that we are keeping our options open but I really haven&#39;t heard <br/>
anything that has made me want to rush back.  Again, this usually brings nods <br/>
and a horror story or two about ps.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people just want to vent about their ps, sometimes they even have a <br/>
nice program to brag about, sometimes they are genuinely curious.  Sometimes <br/>
they are just nosy Parkers.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you have to judge and go with how much energy you have that day.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

Dear Kerry...<br/>
My general advice is to bore them to tears-using as much &quot;education-ese&quot; as <br/>
you can sprinkle into conversations.  They&#39;ll either be impressed or sorry <br/>
they asked!  This is what I mean...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; 1.  &quot;What curriculum do you use?&quot;<br/>
On a ___________(daily, weekly, monthly) basis, I evaluate the children&#39;s <br/>
skills and design for them an IEP (Individual educational plan...but use the <br/>
acronym, it sounds more impressive).  According to the outcome of the IEP <br/>
conference, we glean resources from many different academic areas, using <br/>
content that is pertinent to their particular needs and interests.  (get the <br/>
idea?)<br/>
 <br/>
 2.  &quot;What do you do all day?&quot;<br/>
We spend our day working on a rotation basis with multiple educational tools <br/>
designed for teaching ADL&#39;s (activities of daily living).  Children and <br/>
adults work daily on expanding their creative potential using all resources <br/>
available to them.  We also hold daily workshops dealing with the following <br/>
subjects: crisis management; diversity education; handling emotions and <br/>
sibling rivalry.<br/>
<br/>
 3.  &quot;Do you work from home while the kids school?&quot;<br/>
My husband (partner, etc.) are co-researchers on a longitudinal study that <br/>
involves the observation of multi-age subjects while at work and play.  On a <br/>
daily basis, we evaluate the relevancy of the educational approach to the <br/>
desired outcome for the subject.  This study is time-consuming; requiring 24 <br/>
hour attentiveness and leaves me too busy at this time to pursue other <br/>
commitments.<br/>
 <br/>
 4.  &quot;I thought I saw you at the park yesterday.  Are you on a break?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, we were actually testing a recently published study that states that <br/>
children learn better when offered the opportunity for regular outdoor <br/>
exercise and exposure to natural elements. After analyzing the personal data <br/>
we compiled, we found ourselves quite in agreement with the study!<br/>
 <br/>
 5.  And, my personal favorite, &quot;When are you going to put the kids back<br/>
 in school again?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
My children are already in school, if you consider school to be a place where <br/>
people pursue learning.  With the new technology and all the opportunities <br/>
available for learning; why would anyone think that only children who attend <br/>
a traditional brick and mortar institution are indeed attending school?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m being very tongue-in-cheek here, obviously.  If you don&#39;t want to bother <br/>
with all this, the old stand-by of smiling and saying nothing at all works or <br/>
turn the question back on them...<br/>
When they say &quot;What do you do all day,&quot; smile really big and say...What an <br/>
interesting question...What do you do all day?<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have fun....don&#39;t let them know you&#39;re flustered; fluster them <br/>
instead, but do it with a smile<br/>
