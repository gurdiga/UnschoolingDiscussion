<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216611073">At the Always Learning Live Symposium in Albuquerque there was a discussion <br/>
yesterday about critical relatives.<br/>
<br/>
I had been thinking about my regret at the times I was less than kind to my <br/>
sisters in law when they were bugging me about Dylan not going to school.<br/>
<br/>
One used to send newspaper clippings about random stranger kids in different <br/>
parts of the country achieving cool things in public school, or some great <br/>
program in some school somewhere.  She lived in Alaska and didnt have any <br/>
kids... still doesnt.  And she would ask, How do you know where hes at, <br/>
academically, and , how can he possibly go to college, and other similar <br/>
questions.   She had gone to catholic school.<br/>
<br/>
I started bombarding her with news reports of teachers who molested kids, <br/>
injured kids, or otherwise abused their power.   And articles about school <br/>
violence and underfunding and cut programs and crumbling or contaminated <br/>
buildings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I hadnt done that.  I wish I had just said, Claire, STOP.  I know <br/>
youre worried.  I know you love Dylan.  But youre harassing me and I want <br/>
you to stop.<br/>
<br/>
And one sister in law usually didnt say anything to me but worked on David <br/>
and sometimes lit a little flame of worry in him and said stuff either to or <br/>
around her kids that they would later repeat to us.   Her daughter Lillie was <br/>
so much like Dylan and there came a time when Lillie was very unhappy at <br/>
school, crying a lot, feeling sick a lot, and I said I didnt want Dylan to be <br/>
as miserable as Lillie, that seemed like torture to me and I wouldnt do it.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I hadnt said that.   I was so invested in getting her to shush that I <br/>
didnt think about how harsh that was.   I wish I had directly asked her to <br/>
stop it and then resigned myself to the idea that she probably never would.<br/>
<br/>
Lillie is married now with a nice husband and a new baby.<br/>

When my mother-in-law asked how I knew that Kirby wasn&#39;t behind, I told her I knew he WAS behind in some things, and that he was ahead in others.<br/>
<br/>
I think acknowledging their concern is courteous, even when you-the-unschooling-parent aren&#39;t worried at all.  Or you could say &quot;I used to worry about that, too&quot; or &quot;I know it seems weird to think they could...&quot; and maybe also allow for the possibility that you will put the kids in school.  It gives your detractors hope. :-)<br/>
