<div id="ygrps-yiv-381132819">I joined the list yesterday and will probably lurk for a while.  We are in <br/>
the middle of a move and I have lots of packing to do.  <br/>
<br/>
My name is Cindy Berkowitz and have been married to Jeff for 14 years on the <br/>
9th.  We have three children, Sarah Elizabeth 10 yo, Jessica Eileen 7 3/4 yo, <br/>
and Jacob Edward 5yo.  I tried school with Sarah and sent her to a Montessori <br/>
kindergarten program which she loved.  However, public school 1st grade was a <br/>
whole different ball of wax.  She was sitting in a class doing all of the <br/>
sounds of the alphabet when she could read on a 3rd grade level.  Went the <br/>
whole gifted testing route against my better instincts and in Feb. pulled her <br/>
out to homeschool.  I had a little one and at the time didn&#39;t feel I could <br/>
handle school-at-home.  Only knew one homeschooler and she did <br/>
school-at-home.  I quickly discovered unschooling and have never looked back. <br/>
 After only five months in school she needed to be unschooled for almost 6 <br/>
months.  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to meeting new people but I won&#39;t be around much till after <br/>
the move on June 15th.<br/>
