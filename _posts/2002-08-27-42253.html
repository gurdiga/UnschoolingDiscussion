read, by reading Shakespeare. Seriously. We were performing in a local <br/>
Shakespeare theater group, she was one of the three fairies in Midsummer <br/>
Night&#39;s Dream. She was 7. She didn&#39;t read yet, at all. But she held the <br/>
script and (I thought) pretended to read along, during rehearsal after <br/>
rehearsal. One day I came into the living room and caught her upside down on <br/>
the couch/sofa/davenport -- feet kicking in the air -- reading the script <br/>
with great expression. I thought she&#39;d memorized it, of course (quite a feat, <br/>
itself), but it turned out that sometime over those previous weeks she&#39;d <br/>
started actually reading -- I realized that when I noticed she was reading <br/>
more than just the dialog. That was it, she read fluently from them on.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s always loved Shakespeare - she spent her own money at a garage sale to <br/>
buy a full set of little volumes of all of Shakespeare&#39;s works. They were <br/>
selling them for $50, but she misread it as $5. When they seller saw the <br/>
heartbroken look on her face, he sold them to her for the $5 and loaded them <br/>
into our car and could not stop grinning at her - as they chatted about <br/>
various plays. Called his wife out of the house to meet her.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t READ Shakespeare with my kids, though, unless they already loved <br/>
it enough to really want to read it. I&#39;d watch the video Much Ado About <br/>
Nothing with Kenneth Branaugh (my younger kids always just thought that the <br/>
whole thing was because of a &quot;kiss&quot;) and I&#39;d read &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot; by <br/>
the Lambs (maybe before going to see an actual production) and I&#39;d watch the <br/>
video of Hamlet with Mel Gibson AND (for those who can handle the sadness) <br/>
the version of Romeo and Juliet with Olivia Hussey -- the Leonardo DiCaprio <br/>
gang version for older kids and West Side Story, too. And - I&#39;d go see <br/>
Macbeth with a kid who likes scary stuff and Comedy of Errors for those who <br/>
like that kind of humor.<br/>
<br/>
Shakespeare&#39;s plays can be raunchy or scary or sad or funny and I think they <br/>
are delightful --- but they can also be VERY VERY boring to read.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe we think of &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;celebrating&quot; differently. Don&#39;t get me <br/>
wrong, I&#39;m not a fan at ALL of most punk/rap music - I get to hear a fair <br/>
amount of it and I don&#39;t like much of it... once in a while one of the teens <br/>
in my life wants to play something for me they think I&#39;ll like, and I can <br/>
bring myself to appreciate it - to appreciate what they are appreciating, at <br/>
least. <br/>
<br/>
But I also don&#39;t think that something has to &quot;teach&quot; the difference between <br/>
right and wrong for people to learn about that difference from it. Have you <br/>
seen the movie, Road to Perdition? I don&#39;t want to give it away to those who <br/>
haven&#39;t seen it - it is WELL worth seeing!!!!!! It really is about this topic <br/>
though - of learning to distinguish right from wrong - not from someone <br/>
moralizing/teaching it, that&#39;s for sure. I can&#39;t say enough about how much I <br/>
liked that movie - I think it is a deceptively simple plot, with HUGE <br/>
implications that nobody tries to pound into the audiences&#39; heads. Lots of <br/>
food for thought about parenting and loyalty and learning good/evil and anger <br/>
and love and so on.<br/>

that I&#39;m giving away the ending). The way they really stage it is with a <br/>
trampoline behind the set, so she is really jumping onto a trampoline. There <br/>
have been productions where she bounced so high that she was visible above <br/>
the set on her rebound -- to the dismay and amusement of the audience, I&#39;m <br/>
sure. Anyway -- we have the video and have watched it over and over. Once in <br/>
a while it makes me want to go jump on a trampoline. Hasn&#39;t yet made me want <br/>
to jump off of high walls, though &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150208368">I really like Shakespeare - as do my children. I had thought my daughter 8 too young for Shakespeare in the Park - for the last couple of years, but decided to take her this year. They were doing comedy of errors. Both she and my other children (3,&4) enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
The really great part was, that she wanted the actors to sign her program. So I took her backstage and the actors and actresses were more than happy to do so, and talk with her about the play. She wanted to go back again - and we did - this time bringing an entourage of her friends...<br/>
<br/>
I do think that Shakespearean theater is different than movies, Hamlet with Glen Close and Mel Gibson was a little too Freudian from the way I interpreted the play.  <br/>
<br/>
But I guess it is all in how you see something.<br/>
