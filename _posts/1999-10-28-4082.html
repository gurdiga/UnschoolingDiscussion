<div id="ygrps-yiv-842686354">Actually I remember the whole tune but only the very last stanza of the song.  That&#39;s why I walked away *whistling! :)<br/>
<br/>
something something something,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark.<br/>
Now what did they say, just when everything looked so stark?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, you know you gotta Accent-uate the Positive<br/>
and Elim, eliminate the Negative<br/>
and Latch on to the Affirmative <br/>
and Don&#39;t miss with Mr. In Between.<br/>
<br/>
No-o don&#39;t miss with Mr. In Between.<br/>
No, no Don&#39;t Miss with Mr. - In Between!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I sure would love to find a copy of that song.  It&#39;s been in my head for years.  I grew up in a very abusive home and was an incredibly miserable child.  <br/>
I loved any and all forms of escape.  Music (despite the fact that both parents were musicians and singers) was always my primary source of comfort.<br/>
Once when a family member came to visit he got a peek at just how desperate the situation was and came to our rescue (my brother&#39;s and mine). <br/>
My father told him to mind his own business and get the something out and never come back.  My father left in a huff, my mother ran off to console him<br/>
and my uncle told me he that now he understood why I was the way I was but to always focus on the positive and remember that old song and sang some <br/>
of it while he packed.   He was elderly and passed on while we were still little.   The only part I ever remembered was that last part and honestly it didn&#39;t really <br/>
help me till I grew up but everytime I think of it it still makes me smile.<br/>
