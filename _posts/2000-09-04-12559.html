No, no, no.....you&#39;re not getting it. I was hysterical. I needed to hold<br/>
still so she could stop the bleeding. I couldn&#39;t even hear her saying &quot;Stop!<br/>
Hold still!&quot; over my own frightened screaming. (I cut myself trying to make<br/>
lunch.) She gave me one simple stinging swat on the tush and it brought me<br/>
back to earth. She didn&#39;t care about cleaning up the mess. She knew she<br/>
needed to stop the bleeding. And she was certainly used to my strong<br/>
emotions. If she had had a problem with that, I would have received a lot<br/>
more than 3 spankings in my entire life. Not a control issue at all, unless<br/>
you count first-aid as a control issue. The spanking was a simple attention<br/>
getter. No ill effects and no therapy needed.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Spanking<br/>
&gt;Date: Sat, 05 May 2001 05:02:00 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi Kate,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Would you mind telling me which Proverbs that is? Does it actually<br/>
&gt;say, &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child?&quot; I was told that it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Biblical passages are deciphered differently by different people.<br/>
&gt;I for one do not take it so literally. I can NOT imagine Jesus<br/>
&gt;hitting a child, whether He called it spanking or something else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I never felt that hitting/spanking a child was a civilized way of<br/>
&gt;teaching them right from wrong. I preferred communication. I was<br/>
&gt;spanked as a child, not &#39;abused.&#39; I suffered from it, and no it<br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t often and it wasn&#39;t with great force. It was simply total<br/>
&gt;humiliation. Spanking IMO is something that is used when patience is<br/>
&gt;lost and words can&#39;t be found. Listening, REALLY listening to Laurie<br/>
&gt;worked better than using the spanking/powertrip thing...not that I<br/>
&gt;ever resorted to hitting her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;love, Valerie<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am astounded at the ridicule of the Proverb &quot;Spare the rod, spoil<br/>

&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; upbringing of our child.  This includes discipline.  Does it mean<br/>
&gt;to &quot;beat&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; them?  NO! It means to correct and discourage them from<br/>
&gt;disobeying.  That<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes means using a physical form of correction.  Please give<br/>
&gt;me one<br/>
&gt; &gt; example of a child that was &quot;spanked&quot; as means of correcting that<br/>
&gt;has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; emotionally damaged.  I am not talking about those cases of abuse.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t believe &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; pertains at all to<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; disallowing of a child to attend ps for fear of the bullying he/she<br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience. &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; pertains to Biblical<br/>
&gt;discipline<br/>
&gt; &gt; of our children.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;&gt;says that their anxieties and fears will overwhelm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;them later if they don&#39;t learn how to deal with them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;by overcoming teasing etc. in childhood.  I end up<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; You know Eileen, I had plenty of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; teasing/torment/ostracizing in public school and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; don&#39;t think it did me a damned bit of good.  I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; have done without every scrap.  If I had respectful<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; parents who taught by example, a happy childhood and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; less (or no) stress, I would have turned out so much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; less screwed up, with fewer issues to work through and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; deal with as an adult.  It would have saved me so much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; time and heartache.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Don&#39;t lament that &quot;sparing the rod will spoil the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; child&quot; please!!  Rejoice in the fact that you treat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; your child like a human being and you do not subject<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; him to experiences that YOU would not want to undergo.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;  Perhaps if I had not been subjected to the horrors of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &quot;socialization&quot; in public schools I would not have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; been such a profoundly unhappy and deeply terrified<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; child.  I have few happy memories of my childhood,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; which in retrospect seems like a string of painful<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; memories best left behind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727960508"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Makes life more pleasant for the child growing up for sure<br/>
&gt; but we can&#39;t condemn children to be something horrible because of a spanking<br/>
&gt; as a child.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re talking about condemning children to be seriel<br/>
killers if they were spanked.  You&#39;ve taken a reasonable question and<br/>
exaggerated it to the point that it&#39;s meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
I was spanked, hard and frequently as a child.  Yes, I&#39;m happy, and you&#39;d<br/>
probably figure to meet me that I&#39;m reasonably well adjusted.  But it&#39;s<br/>
taken a lot of hard, consious, and often painful emotional work to be the<br/>
kind of parent I want to be.<br/>
<br/>
My sister was raised in the same environment, and didn&#39;t have the emotional<br/>
support in her marriage that I&#39;ve had.  She&#39;s not a serial killer, either.<br/>
The last I heard, she was waitressing and was well-liked by customers.<br/>
She&#39;s friendly and chatty.  She also abandonded her children and hasn&#39;t<br/>
spoken to our parents in 14 years.  Somehow, I think that&#39;s closer to what<br/>
the questioner originally meant.  It&#39;s not about the physical hurt of a<br/>
child.  It&#39;s not about making life more pleasant.  It&#39;s about the emotional<br/>
scars.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Nope, maybe in spite of our upbringings we will be what we are<br/>
&gt; innately supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you really believe this?  Because I hard to believe that my sister was<br/>
supposed to turn out to be what she is.  I can&#39;t believe that her actions,<br/>
which have brought so much pain to so many people, were &quot;innately supposed<br/>
to be&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that some people believe in predestination, and perhaps your faith is<br/>
one of those.  Personally, I couldn&#39;t believe in a God that would intend<br/>
such a thing.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BTW, I don&#39;t spank and wouldn&#39;t spank.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have, wish I hadn&#39;t, and try hard every single day not to.  Every day, I<br/>
make choices to not do what seems more natural based on my upbringing.<br/>
Statements like yours hurt; they seem full of pride, and could make other<br/>
people in my situation feel shamed.  Please don&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996826536">&quot;Not so much offended as sad that people would be so violent when <br/>
addressing such a topic as spanking and how wrong it is! Replying to <br/>
a woman who obviously needs help to stop violence with more violence <br/>

<br/>
Violence?<br/>
Does someone here have a black eye? Did anyone hit somebody when I wasn&#39;t looking? Geez, this new technology is so amazing, we can now physically ASSAULT each other through the computer!!! <br/>
Yes, I&#39;m sarcastic....but I&#39;ve about had it with all this sniveling about violence when the ONLY thing that happened was a defense of gentle parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is hostility being read into posts where there is NONE Jeva. That says more about how you are filtering information than it does about any single poster here.<br/>
The only thing I&#39;ve seen was questions, information and more questions about how to NOT commit violence.<br/>
Chris was defending the &quot;fact&quot; that hitting a child is ok in certain situations. That is not a person wanting options. If she wanted options I would have been happy to answer her questions for the next year.<br/>
<br/>
There is no violence at this list. There is strong information and questioning of IDEAS. Anyone who can&#39;t handle a good discussion ought to really quit whining and go find a list that is perfect for them.<br/>

  advocate non-violence in word and deed unless I too practice such.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe I have missed something but I am puzzled by your talking about violent <br/>
<br/>
  posts and I see you as really defensive. It seems to me that maybe you would <br/>
<br/>
  like us to all be polite always but I think that would mean we would have to be <br/>
<br/>
  less than honest with one another. It is a dangerous thing to take an email to <br/>
<br/>
  personally. How could I or anyone truly insult you when we don&#39;t personally know <br/>
<br/>
  who you really are.<br/>

  &gt; Today you have called people violent, hateful, disrespectful,<br/>
  &gt; undignified, immature, impatient, intolerant, sarcastic, accusatory,<br/>
  &gt; insulting, hostile, verbally abusive, snotty, nasty and those are <br/>
  just<br/>
  &gt; the one&#39;s I can think of without looking back at your posts. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Teach gentleness by being gentle indeed. <br/>
