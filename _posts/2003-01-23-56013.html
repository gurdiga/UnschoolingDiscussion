<div id="ygrps-yiv-502417094">Dear Maryann,<br/>
<br/>
I am a homeschooling mother that uses our local<br/>
public library sometimes twice a week pending<br/>
on the topic of our study.<br/>
We live in North Dakota.<br/>
Our library does carry some information on homeschooling,<br/>
of which I was very surprised to find.<br/>
I was very hesitant to let even the library staff know that<br/>
we were homeschooling, as I assumed these older ladies<br/>
to be standoffish, and single minded regarding anything<br/>
but public schooling all the way.<br/>
This was not and was has not been the factor. Very<br/>
friendly towards my child and myself and helpful.<br/>
If they have any views they keep it to themselves.<br/>
This library has been my source as a teacher for<br/>
materials. Everything from documentaries, movies<br/>
books on tape or disc going beyond only bookes.<br/>
Of course we do it bored, and wish there were <br/>
something new everyweek, but there is still untouched<br/>
informatin there on the shelves, I just have to me more<br/>
creative.<br/>
The public library, if used, is an asset to homeschooling<br/>
families.<br/>
