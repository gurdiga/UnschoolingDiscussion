<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408671814"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I hope we can support you in whatever ways you need.  Being a single<br/>
&gt;mother is difficult.  If something ever happened where my children<br/>
&gt;needed to go to a brick-and-mortar school, I&#39;d use a Sudbury Valley<br/>
&gt;one too.  And if it helps, I have seen a lot of support for those<br/>
&gt;parents who want to unschool and who can&#39;t fully because of a spouse&#39;s<br/>
&gt;objection.  Leaving isn&#39;t always an option and it isn&#39;t always in the<br/>
&gt;best interest of the child either.  Sometimes it is hard to share <br/>
&gt;personal information on lists like this but it does help to understand<br/>
&gt;the specifics for each family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>HI Cindy, Actually, most of what I talked about was in theory. Then I <br/>
spoke of my own personal experience with being a single mom.<br/>
<br/>
I am back in NYC as a family and its most likely a temporary situation. I <br/>
don&#39;t like the energy of the area as a place to raise a child. And <br/>
unschooling is our lifestyle. It always has been since my own childhood. <br/>
But I&#39;ve been on a lot of sides of the coin in my varied history and <br/>
somehow this has given me insight to a lot of frames of mind.<br/>
<br/>
No I don&#39;t know the past of some of these people, but I do know some of <br/>
them that have posted about non-support and then I can see where they are <br/>
torn when trying to move forward.<br/>
<br/>
The whole flavour was to have patience for those that need to take two <br/>
small steps and then they go three back from internal situations.<br/>
<br/>
This is where the support to eachother does come in.<br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>

And personally, I&#39;d choose Sudbury or something similar first, <br/>
unschooling at home second. My son is a people person. And the best place <br/>
for him is to be around groups of people. I can&#39;t give that to him 5 days <br/>
a week.</div>
