<div id="ygrps-yiv-978357763">My oldest son Jesse, who is 9, has an amazing imagination. I&#39;m sure he is bound for the stage, he loves to talk and he turns everything into a story which is told with expression and enthusiasm. He gets so caught up in stories, film and book that he often forgets that it isn&#39;t real. Even if it&#39;s a cartoon!! Is there anyone else out there with kids who do the same thing?<br/>
<br/>
When I start to panic I always remind myself of  the Einstein quote, &#39;Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I just read the piece &#39;Serious Play&quot; by John Holt in Unschooling.com Online News and that was further comfort. Jess has so much more time to play, play, play. He is outside for most of the day sword fighting with his brother and making up all sorts of dramas. <br/>
<br/>
I often catch myself wondering how long it will be before he starts writing or  wanting to know about vikings and the history of early Australia. LOL. Then I slap myself around the head and  realize he is doing the important stuff right now. <br/>

finishes the quote after the word Imagination in the third sentence...and says <br/>
&quot; is endless.&quot;  I ask him if he ever heard that quote before and he gives me <br/>
a look, and says, &quot;No, that just makes sense, Mama.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That it does.  <br/>

When Marty was little and Disney&#39;s Pocahontas was new and we had the songs on <br/>
tape, he sang the end of a line elegantly, and more sensibly (and of course <br/>
full voice and on pitch, holding the last note &lt;bwg&gt;) this way:<br/>
<br/>
[Recording:]<br/>
<br/>
You can own the earth but still<br/>
All you own is earth until... [dramatic pause before big finale]<br/>
<br/>
[Marty finishes, with two notes, the fifth and octave of the closing chord:]<br/>
<br/>
... you die!<br/>
<br/>
[and then the recording lamely finishes &quot;...you can sing with all the colors <br/>
of the wind.&quot;]<br/>

Some things just make sense, and lots of them come out of little kids.<br/>

When he says things like that I wonder, when did I lose my sense? Good thing <br/>
I have my son around to help me notice what I still have, and get the rest <br/>
back!  <br/>

OH!  That helped a lot!<br/>
Whey you said &quot;snuggled up&quot; I thought they were in bed, and maybe the kid was <br/>
hungry!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
