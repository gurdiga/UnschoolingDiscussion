<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757400385">I have noticed after my post, entire digests are being<br/>
included. I think this is my fault and so apologize. <br/>
I think the way i was posting was causing this, or am I <br/>
the only one who saw them? Just asking/ Thank you<br/>
for the bread and gardening resources. We will look<br/>
for both at our next library visit.<br/>
