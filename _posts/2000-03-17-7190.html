<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634340561">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m just terrible at searching for stuff on the Web.  I either come up with <br/>
14 million matches, or 2-3 matches that have nothing to do with what I was <br/>
looking for.  Sounds like I need to work on that.  Anyhoo, in the meantime, <br/>
can anyone point me to some good sites about geometry for beginners?  My 8 yo <br/>
has discovered that he LOOOOVES geometry and would like to do more.  He&#39;s <br/>
already found and completed all the geometry pages in every workbook in the <br/>
house, and is looking for more.   He&#39;s a geometry junkie!  When I look back <br/>
on my godawful geometry experience in PS, I am so happy for him that he can <br/>
enjoy it happily.  Thanks in advance for any pointers you may have.  <br/>
<br/>
Pax et bonum, <br/>
KIM</div>
