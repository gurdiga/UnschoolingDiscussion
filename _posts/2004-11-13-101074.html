<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542251043">Well, I thought I&#39;d say &quot;Hello&quot; again to everyone! <br/>
<br/>
Sarah just came home earlier this week after a few very difficult <br/>
weeks in public school. For those of you who may not remember us, <br/>
Sarah is 8. We first pulled her out of school after a disastrous year <br/>
in Kindergarten in which she was medicated for ADHD, and we had to <br/>
deal with Social Services over taking her off of it, and our refusal <br/>
to test her for Asperger&#39;s Sydrome, ODD, and OCD. We spent first <br/>
grade fighting over various curriculae, then were unschooling when <br/>
second grade began. However, we still were dealing with DSS, and I <br/>
ended up letting Sarah go back to school. It was her choice. She <br/>
seemed to be happy, but she wasn&#39;t really learning much as far as I <br/>
can tell. <br/>
<br/>
We moved to NYC this summer. Sarah went back and forth on being home <br/>
and going to school, and ultimately went back to school. This time <br/>
however it did not work out very well at all, and so she is home once <br/>
again. <br/>
<br/>
The past couple days have been wonderful with her! It is so good to <br/>
see her waking up smiling again on her own time, rather than having <br/>
to argue to get her to the bus on time earlier than either of us <br/>
wanted to be awake. Instead of ignoring her drawing materials, she <br/>
has drawn a great picture of a rooster sitting on a nest (she <br/>
says &quot;Well, Daddy Hens have to take care of the chicks too!) of eggs. <br/>
<br/>
We just found out that we have the opportunity to move back to NC for <br/>
a couple of years, which will be nice. <br/>
<br/>
The odd thing is, even though we weren&#39;t homeschooling here, someone <br/>
(keep in mind, please, that we are living in military base housing!)<br/>
called social services complaining that we weren&#39;t homeschooling <br/>
Sarah properly because she was out playing during the day!! She <br/>
didn&#39;t start school on the first day of school because she was going <br/>
through the placement tests for the district. But geez! Even if we <br/>
WERE homeschooling, there is no law saying a homeschooled child MUST <br/>
be indoors from 9 to 2! <br/>
<br/>
THEN...Tuesday was her last day. I was supposed to be taking her up <br/>
to a different school on Wednesday (because they wanted her in a <br/>
special ed class, which isn&#39;t offered at her districted school). We <br/>
didn&#39;t go first thing in the morning, and by afternoon Sarah was a <br/>
crying wreck, and she told me it was too much to change schools AND <br/>
class, and she wanted to be home because school wasn&#39;t as much fun as <br/>
she thought and she missed us. <br/>
<br/>
My husband Paul was on duty on Wednesday and Thursday, and I didn&#39;t <br/>
tell him about Sarah&#39;s decision to stay home until Thursday <br/>
afternoon. Not an hour later, as we were at the playground, another <br/>
child asked Sarah why she was being homeschooled and didn&#39;t she want <br/>
to go back to school? <br/>
<br/>
Sarah&#39;s reply &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to go back. I love homeschooling! <br/>
It&#39;s lots more fun!&quot; and they went over to the other side of the <br/>
playground, so I didn&#39;t hear anything else they said. (Although not <br/>
two hours later, the mom of one of Sarah&#39;s other friends emailed me <br/>
asking me if it was true Sarah wasn&#39;t going back to school AND if we <br/>
were moving - so apparently Sarah mentioned our move to her friend on <br/>
the playground as well). <br/>
<br/>
UGH. I look forward to leaving this place. I&#39;d like to decide what <br/>
I&#39;m doing without hearing my decision questioned ten minutes later <br/>
from people who aren&#39;t even my friends!!<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY...that&#39;s what we&#39;re up to right now. <br/>
<br/>
