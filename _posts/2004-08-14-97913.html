Unschooling limits one in relation to the history of schooling.  <br/>
Trusting people to know what and how they want to live and learn is  <br/>
more encompassing than schooling or unschooling.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, since my definition of unschooling is respecting the child and  <br/>
trusting him to know what and how he wants to live and learn, I take  exception to <br/>
this. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t find it limiting at all.<br/>
