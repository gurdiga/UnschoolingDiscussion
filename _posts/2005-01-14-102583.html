homeschool email group. I&#39;ve been struggling with this issue for probably <br/>
the past year. I believe in this philosophy, BUT I have issues with the <br/>
discipline side. HOW do I teach my child to make his own choices, while AT <br/>
THE SAME TIME discouraging undesirable behavior?  I&#39;d *like* to let him do <br/>
whatever he wants, but what about when he does things that are just not <br/>
acceptable, for example hitting or yelling at me? This is our big issue now <br/>
and, while it may not exactly equate to TV watching, I still think the idea <br/>
is the same. So do I let him hit me and bark orders at me for two years <br/>
until the marginal utility of this behavior comes down? No.  I guess what I <br/>
am asking all of you for advice on is - how do you curb an undesirable <br/>
behavior *without* punishment/restriction?  (And before anyone brings it <br/>
up, there is never *any* hitting in this family, so he is not learning it <br/>
from us. I am very loose with discipline and it is suggested by many <br/>
friends and family members that *I* am the reason he acts this way - <br/>
because I am not strict enough. Typical.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do or do not. There is no try.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898013194">I just didn&#39;t put up with any hitting - when the kids were little - 2 <br/>
or 3 or up - if they lashed out, I&#39;d just wrap my arms around them and <br/>
hold them as gently as possibly but firmly and say, &quot;No hitting.&quot; If <br/>
they persisted, I&#39;d carry them into another room away from the victim <br/>
and say, &quot;You can&#39;t be around other people if you hit.&quot;  I didn&#39;t deal <br/>
with whatever their issue was, to be honest, if they were hitting, <br/>
because the hitting itself became the higher priority issue to deal <br/>
with. So - my answer is that other things stop - they get separated <br/>
from &quot;society&quot; - they don&#39;t get to hit me or anybody else because that <br/>
is just not going to be tolerated and it is my job to make our home <br/>
safe for the rest of our family or guests.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as they&#39;re calm, we THEN go back to trying to resolve whatever <br/>
the original problem was, of course.<br/>

With yelling - things are a little different. Yelling can be a step UP <br/>
if they&#39;ve been being physical and now they&#39;re using words - albeit <br/>
mean and loud ones.<br/>
<br/>
But - still - screaming in my face is going to get a similar response <br/>
as hitting.<br/>

Shannon I forget how old you mentioned your kid(s) are, however it is<br/>
something that we struggle with at times with Jayn (5), especially since she<br/>
sometimes seems to get a great kick out of doing something that is<br/>
irritating to us. Here&#39;s something I wrote fairly recently on another list<br/>
that still applies to Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
Long Quote begins:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This &quot;what to do about our youngster hitting out and kicking us&quot; is one<br/>
of the *big* issues related to the children that are these young ages. I<br/>
often find it a real struggle. So this is going to be a bit of an essay.<br/>
Just thinking about my answer I have had a couple of revelations about Jayn,<br/>
so thanks for asking. <br/>
<br/>
There are two different types of unpleasant hitting behavior - towards other<br/>
kids, and towards Mom and Dad. They have different motivations behind them,<br/>
and I act differently for each.<br/>
<br/>
The first step in this for me was to make a commitment to not spanking or<br/>
punishing. I did this before Jayn was born. She has never had a time out,<br/>
although she sometimes takes herself off to the other room if she wants a<br/>
moment to calm herself. My commitment reminds me to stop and breathe at<br/>
those times when it just seems impossible - and presto it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
About two years ago, when I still allowed Jayn to play at my neighbors&#39;<br/>
home, I got a call from their mother. Jayn had apparently kicked Jonah, a<br/>
boy her age, while all three children were left alone in the kids&#39; bedroom<br/>
to play. His mother was upset because Jayn would not apologize to Jonah, but<br/>
had evidently made no effort to get to the cause of the event, or to comfort<br/>
Jonah who was *still* crying (more in hurt pride not actual hurt body) by<br/>
the time I got down the hall to their apartment. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn was doing a kind of skipping around song to herself, which I recognize<br/>
as avoidance/denial behavior. It is not that she is really callous; it is<br/>
that she had no tools for how to act in the situation when the other adult<br/>
was making a demand that she didn&#39;t want to comply with.<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring the woman, who just kept repeating, &quot;She won&#39;t apologize, she won&#39;t<br/>
apologize&quot;, in favor of dealing with the more urgent situation, I got down<br/>
on the floor close to Jonah and held his hand, gently pulled Jayn to me in<br/>
one arm, and asked him if he was hurt, and to tell me what had happened. I<br/>
listened for a few minutes while he calmed down and told me that Jayn had<br/>
kicked him and how it had hurt, and Jayn in my arm did also. I apologized on<br/>
her behalf, and then gave him a hug. All this time, Renee just kept playing<br/>
herself. At no time did she contribute anything to the story of what had<br/>
actually happened. At the end of this Jayn and Jonah hugged, and she said<br/>
something about not kicking in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I then took Jayn off home, and I asked why she had wanted to kick Jonah. She<br/>
wasn&#39;t ready to tell me until a little later, when she explained that Jonah<br/>
had come over and knocked over the girls&#39; little town. We talked about some<br/>
alternative courses of action next time someone was doing something that was<br/>
bothering her, or interrupting her play: using her words, inviting Jonah to<br/>
play, getting a grown up to help. It was clear to me that Jonah was<br/>
resenting being left out of the game and having his space invaded, and so<br/>
disrupted their game. I suspect he was afraid that if it came out that he<br/>
had provoked the kick, he would at best lose all sympathy and at worst be<br/>
punished himself. <br/>
<br/>
This kind of physically supporting Jayn&#39;s emotions (with my arm around her)<br/>
while not condoning her actions and acting to comfort and apologize to the<br/>
injured other party has been the model of what I do in any event where Jayn<br/>
is unpleasant to another child. Sometimes I remind her that sand is<br/>
dangerous if it gets in someone&#39;s eyes. I usually have taken her away to<br/>
speak to her privately about her actions.<br/>
<br/>
This last action has become more problematic for me recently, as it is<br/>
starting to fall under the purview of an idea that I have been thinking and<br/>
writing about a lot recently - that our children don&#39;t need us to elucidate<br/>
their mistakes for them, or try to ensure that they have learnt something<br/>
from them (they will anyway). <br/>
<br/>
Jayn has been resenting/rejecting me wanting to point out her bad behavior<br/>
to her. She resists listening to me go on about how she shouldn&#39;t throw a<br/>
toy at someone. She already knows it. On these rare occasions, her judgment<br/>
is overcome by a moment of annoyance, or possibly a desire to conduct an<br/>
experiment into the usefulness of whacking someone. My solution to this has<br/>
become to focus more on comforting the other person, mirroring back their<br/>
emotions, and apologizing on her behalf. Jayn can sense my concern, and is<br/>
starting to say sorry spontaneously. She is now more likely to talk about<br/>
why she did it and what she could do instead at a *much* later time, like<br/>
when cuddling on the sofa later in the evening, rather than immediately<br/>
after the event.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of Jayn hitting or kicking me or dh, there seem to be several<br/>
reasons for it. <br/>
<br/>
The first one is when she is trying to distract me from speaking to her<br/>
seriously about something she is doing that really should stop. Sometimes it<br/>
means I am being long winded about it. Usually I protect my face by grabbing<br/>
her hands and *completely ignore* the hitting. In other words I refuse to be<br/>
distracted from my mission to stop her from whatever discourteous behavior<br/>
she is engaged in. Recently it was continuing to splash a child in the pool<br/>
who didn&#39;t wish to play a splashing game. When Jayn realizes her ploy won&#39;t<br/>
work she usually becomes calm and listens (I try to be brief) and then will<br/>
agree to another course of action that either she or I devise.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn was kicking and hitting (then laughing) dh a lot recently, we<br/>
divined that it was because she was missing him while he was at work, and<br/>
wanted more of his undivided attention for a while in the evenings. She<br/>
didn&#39;t have the words or grasp of her emotions to explain her resentment. Dh<br/>
and she had a conversation on a walk, after I suggested to him that this<br/>
might be the reason for her pushing away behaviors. They came up with a plan<br/>
for them to spend time playing their games together, and he agreed to make<br/>
her his first priority. It has worked really well. I&#39;m feeling like the hit<br/>
and laugh action is more on this theme - wanting attention or the chance to<br/>
be close. I continue to suggest other ways to express those desires to Jayn,<br/>
like to say, &quot;I need your attention.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The third reason for hitting out is just plain overwhelmed with emotion.<br/>
Jayn is very articulate and loquacious, but she still is just a little one.<br/>
She sometimes just can&#39;t find the words to adequately express that she is<br/>
tired, frustrated, irritated or disappointed. Even adults sometimes have<br/>
trouble doing that! She has meltdowns, but the good news is that they are<br/>
getting fewer. Usually my first goal is self-protection - I push away her<br/>
hands from my face, or hold up my arms in front. I tell her forcefully to<br/>
take some deep breaths. I sometimes will hold her briefly. I am reluctant to<br/>
do so too much after reading Jan Hunt&#39;s &quot;The Dangers of Holding Therapy&quot; at<br/>
www.naturalchild.org .<br/>
<br/>
If I feel anger I try to breathe and speak about it - which is what I want<br/>
to model for her. If I want to hit her, which does still sometimes come up<br/>
(which is why I *need* that stated commitment), I often try blowing a<br/>
raspberry on her instead. Walking away sometimes is possible, but usually<br/>
she will follow. I do repeat, &quot;No hitting/biting people&quot; and sometimes<br/>
suggest she thump the chair or bite a pillow instead. This last action<br/>
sometimes turns into a game with some giggles.<br/>
<br/>
The big thing is to try and remember that it will pass as she ages, that she<br/>
is often mirroring my emotional state, that the good thing behind this is<br/>
that she has no fear of us. When she is at her most obnoxious is also her<br/>
most vulnerable and needy.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-22664357">Hi all--<br/>
<br/>
Am new to this home/unschooling journey, although I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading/talking/thinking about it all since well before my <br/>
now-8-year-old daughter was born.<br/>
<br/>
Started out the year attempting schedules and &quot;assignments&quot; and the <br/>
whole she-bang - not Susan Wise Bauer-level torture for my child, but <br/>
still a couple hours worth of &quot;required&quot; &quot;work&quot;.   (Yes, yes, I know. <br/>
It was a starting point.)  This quickly proved a terrible idea, because <br/>
when I did actually manage to implement said imaginary schedules, my <br/>
daughter was unhappy, bored and frustrated and so was I.   My daughter, <br/>
who loves to learn and is always excited about new ideas, was suddenly <br/>
asking me suspiciously &quot;Is this for SCHOOL or for FUN?&quot; when I handed <br/>
her a new book.  Smart kid.<br/>
<br/>
So out the window that goes and here I am, back to the unschooling <br/>
ideas that compelled me in the first place before I got some sort of <br/>
misguided ideas in my head about what I needed to do.  Been reading and <br/>
lurking and reading some more for a while now, and am immensely <br/>
grateful for this list.<br/>
<br/>
I find myself hitting a wall without externally imposed schedules. I&#39;ve <br/>
never been very good without them, to begin with (thanks a lot, public <br/>
schools).  My daughter is currently happy to read/watch television/surf <br/>
the internet all day, and I&#39;m trying to stay out of her way while she <br/>
decompresses a little.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess this was a longwinded and not very clear request for advice <br/>
on how you all &quot;developed your own interests.&quot;  I worry that I will end <br/>
up playing nethack for hours on end and ignoring my child, which I <br/>
think would not quite be what I&#39;m going for here. :)  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll <br/>
find ourselves a rhythm here eventually, and we do have outside things <br/>
scheduled most days which helps keep me from spending every day in my <br/>
pajamas in bed with a book.  I assume that once she has more <br/>
deschooling time, some of her other interests will re-emerge and we can <br/>
explore those.<br/>
<br/>
Are there others here who had difficulty structuring their days when <br/>
they got started?  I worry that I&#39;m just not nearly as enterprising and <br/>
creative as the rest of you, who are always doing far more interesting <br/>
and exciting things.  heh.<br/>

It sounds like she already has some interests that you could help her<br/>
explore.  You could watch the TV programs that she likes to watch and see<br/>
what she likes about them.  You could surf the internet with her and see<br/>
what kind of things she likes to find.  I think it&#39;s a mistake to try to<br/>
stay out of her way. I think it would benefit you both if you explored the<br/>
things she already likes together.  <br/>

<br/>
The only structure we have to our days is the structure that happens<br/>
naturally.  I guess you wouldn&#39;t call it structure, but more of a rhythm.<br/>
We tend to do a lot of things at the same time every day, but not because we<br/>
feel we have to, but because that&#39;s when it works for us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is there anything that you would like to do that you haven&#39;t found the time<br/>
for over the years.  Do you want to knit, do rug braiding, learn about<br/>
horses? What floats your boat?  Find something that fascinates you and find<br/>
a way to learn about it.  Also, spend time with your child and help them<br/>
research and seek out the things that fascinate him/her.<br/>

Make a schedule for your own self, then.  Maybe plan some  outings.  Shopping <br/>
or lunch. Find fun things to do with your daughter  outside the house.  Go to <br/>
an arcade, a movie, a giftshop, a fabric  store.  Just slowly look at things <br/>
at a crafts store.  Buy some nice  paper and sparkle glue, or something just <br/>
for fun.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe checklists would help, in a scheduly sort of way.<br/>

out of the way, I guess.<br/>

Some people like to get ready for the next day at night. I tend to go <br/>
to sleep as soon as the kids do, but this week they&#39;ve been asleep <br/>
earlier and I&#39;ve been restless, so I&#39;ve been organizing and putting <br/>
away laundry, setting out clothes, etc. at 11:30 at night. Seems <br/>
bizarre and solely due to pg hormones to me, but some people actually <br/>
have energy at night on a regular basis! <br/>

Oh dear, I need to go talk to ds who is suddenly sad about fireworks <br/>

 <br/>
This was tough for me.  As we moved into unschooling I realized that  my <br/>
passion had been &quot;homeschooling&quot; and my life had become consumed with  schedules, <br/>
curriculums, field trips, support groups etc.  I didn&#39;t know  what I loved any <br/>
more.<br/>
 <br/>
I started a list with all the things I&#39;d ever been interested in and just  <br/>
kept adding to it.  Then I just started doing some of those things.   Some of it <br/>
was short-lived...I really hated crocheting!  :-)  Some of  it I love....I&#39;m <br/>
running and weight lifting.  Next week I start a  belly-dancing class.  The <br/>
woman (Mindy) who is teaching the class gave  a workshop at the last Live and <br/>
Learn Conference and now has her own troupe and  performs locally. <br/>
 <br/>
I think just being open to the possibilities and trying something is the  <br/>
key.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a long term thing but it can open the door to  <br/>
discovering something you may become passionate about.<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;ve developed new interests from looking up things the kids were  interested <br/>
in.  And if it seems too self-indulgent or artificial to just  &quot;find a <br/>
hobby,&quot; maybe do it for the kids&#39; sake.  Marty&#39;s interested in the  19th century.  I <br/>
never was.  But sometimes if I have a moment and am  sitting where google.com <br/>
is, I&#39;ll look something up for him, check out a ghost  town near where we <br/>
might be going or some such, and either mention it to him or  just file it away <br/>
in my own support-of-Marty mental area.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s okay if we never tell our kids everything we know.<br/>
 <br/>
I have a kinda stupid but very useful interest I was thinking about picking  <br/>
back up just this morning.  I used to scrounge firewood, when I had to  drive <br/>
the kids places and hang out a while.  Some years back, each had an  interest <br/>
that involved the hockey rink or dance school or karate dojo, and while  I <br/>
waited 20 minutes or an hour or whatever, I would drive in alleys or go to  <br/>
vacant lots and pick up people&#39;s tree trimmings, or abandoned old broken  lumber.  <br/>
It was a combination free firewood and community service, I  guess.  Too much <br/>
good wood goes to the dump, while people are paying money  for firewood.<br/>
 <br/>
Now we have a wood-fired hot tub in addition to the fireplace, and it&#39;s  <br/>
COLD, and I&#39;m thinking I should just go by myself (since the boys are driving  and <br/>
they often drive Holly around now) and just look for wood sometimes.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s also exercise and a good &quot;explore&quot; sometimes.  <br/>
 <br/>
The hot tub itself has been a good new toy that I&#39;ve played with a lot,  <br/>
figuring out how most efficiently to heat it, and how best to drain it and  all.  <br/>
Water play and pyromania combined, with a good soak pretty  often!  And <br/>
there&#39;s a tactical/physics element.  It&#39;s winter and the  hose will freeze if we <br/>
leave it attached and don&#39;t drain it, but if three people  use the tub there&#39;s <br/>
too much displacement to keep 3&quot; over the stove, so if the  stove is already <br/>
cool that&#39;s fine, but if it has a fire in it, more water has to  be added.  We <br/>
have 20 full & closed gallon millk jugs we can chuck in,  but that only replaces <br/>
a person and a half or so.  It&#39;s been a fun  puzzle.  Holly&#39;s been in the <br/>
most, of the kids, but yesterday Marty (on his  16th birthday) sat out with his <br/>
dad and me for half and hour in the late  afternoon, and it was a sweet time we <br/>
can all look back on in years to  come.<br/>
 <br/>
The kids and  I have shared music back and forth, and humor (movies,  <br/>
comedians on recordings or video, musical parodies, websites,  books).   The kids <br/>
turned me on to Eddie Izzard, I offered them things  I had of Bill Cosby and <br/>
George Carlin.  For Christmas I got Marty some  cassette tapes, cheap, of older <br/>
comedy because he has that interest and is  driving a car without a CD player.  <br/>
He&#39;s loving some old Eddie  Murphy.  He knows Eddie Murphy as a famous <br/>
protective father, actor in  kids&#39; movies, Dr. Doolittle, cartoon voices.  This stuff <br/>
from when he  was young and childless and wild is surprisingly crass, and so <br/>
seeing his  career backwards is fun for Marty.<br/>
 <br/>
Your kids can kind of be your main hobby, but if you can learn to just be a  <br/>
support figure in their projects and interests and spend some time making  <br/>
yourself a better &quot;librarian&quot; or resource person you might find some of your own  <br/>
interests through theirs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Lisa. You sound just like me. I, too, have difficulty without <br/>
&quot;schedules&quot; but somehow my life has come to the point where routine and <br/>
schedules do not exist. My husband works from home and we just get up every <br/>
day and never know quite what to expect. I laughed at your comment &quot;we do <br/>
have outside things scheduled most days which helps keep me from spending <br/>
every day in my pajamas in bed with a book.&quot; Ditto for me! We have lots of <br/>
&quot;pajama days&quot; in my house!!<br/>
<br/>
I tried for 2 years or more to implement a &quot;family schedule&quot; with specific <br/>
times for getting up, working, going to the gym, eating. Ugh. What a waste. <br/>
While I might do well on this type of plan, it DOES NOT work for my family.<br/>
<br/>
I also attempted to &quot;plan&quot; my son&#39;s schooling at first. Ha. For the past <br/>
year (he&#39;s 6 now) I&#39;ve been letting him do what he wants, while planning <br/>
outings and field trips with our local homeschool group, providing ample <br/>
books and workbooks strewn about the family room, and playing computer <br/>
games. He has pretty much taught himself to read and has developed <br/>
interests in chess, medieval times, and has become a Star Wars maven. He is <br/>
well advanced beyond many of his friends that go to public school. (I try <br/>
not to compare his progress, but the system has ingrained that in me and <br/>
I&#39;m trying to fight it.)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to structure and don&#39;t worry about being creative. Just let it <br/>
happen and it will.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do or do not. There is no try.&quot;<br/>

 <br/>
It&#39;s been  a bit weird that as Brenna has explored interests, she has  become <br/>
involved in many of the same interests I had in my college  <br/>
days....photography, eastern philosophy, psychology.  It&#39;s been fun because  I have been able <br/>
to share some of what I know but I&#39;ve  also learned much  more that I didn&#39;t <br/>
know as she has gotten deeper into these areas. <br/>
 <br/>
For Christmas, she asked for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ...a  <br/>
book I had loved 25 years ago. Someone from NBTSC had recommended it to  her.  <br/>
She often recommends books to me that she thinks I will like.   She&#39;s been <br/>
listening to a lot of Elton John lately and playing some of  his older songs on <br/>
the piano.  Cool for me!!<br/>

 <br/>
I have a weird parallel too.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron has, through the years, had interests that were close to my heart  <br/>
too.  Oddly, I&#39;ve had boyfriends with the same interests---AND good  <br/>
relationships with them---the ex-boyfriends, I mean! <br/>
 <br/>
When he started showing a strong interest in art/drawing, I called William,  <br/>
and he and William worked together a bit. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
When he showed an interest in magic (after I showed him a pack vanish that  I <br/>
learned from Jeff), I called Jeff and asked for more info. We also stopped in <br/>
 and had lunch with Jeff & his family when we were in DC. Jeff showed Cameron <br/>
 a few things, and Cameron wowed Jeff with his new talent.<br/>
 <br/>
Then he found film-making. I knew John was a camera-operator because I saw  <br/>
his name in the credits of some movie. We called him and chatted about schools  <br/>
and cameras and such. We&#39;re going to drive up to Wilmington, NC to spend a <br/>
few  days with him and use some really fancy cameras.<br/>
 <br/>
Those connections *I* made in my late teens and twenties have made a  huge <br/>
difference in my son&#39;s life. It&#39;s pretty cool. <br/>

I had so much fun in Mindy&#39;s funshop. I just posted about this, too! The <br/>
girls and I got a bellydancing kit for Christmas, put out by Fat Chance <br/>
Bellydance and Barnes & Noble. It&#39;s challenging, but fun!<br/>
<br/>
Kelly&#39;s funshop on service dogs planted a seed that may someday reach <br/>
fruition.<br/>
<br/>
And the beautiful socks that Jill knit inspired me to learn to knit. <br/>
That was one of my New Year&#39;s resolutions, and I got two of my <br/>
Unschooling friends to show me at our last Unschooling Support meeting. <br/>
I&#39;m now in the midst of two scarves for the kids. Still a long way off <br/>
on those gorgeous socks, but I&#39;m hopeful. Plus, I figure someone at the <br/>
next Live and Learn will be kind enough to help me along!<br/>
<br/>
The conference was life changing for *me*!<br/>

I&#39;m thinking we should just all get up at the talent show and do some   <br/>
bellydancing.<br/>
That could be quite a show!  :-)<br/>

We actually did go and watch Mindy recently at a performance with some of  <br/>
her troupe...just amazing.  She is so professional and doing really well  with <br/>
her dance classes.  She is such a inspiration and a good example  of someone <br/>
who has followed her passions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296985986">Oh, yeah!  A Belly Dancing thread on this list?  FUN!<br/>
I&#39;ve been belly dancing for about 5 years now, taking classes off and <br/>
on between having babies....<br/>
I gave a Belly Dance Basics parent/child class for our local <br/>
homeschooling association.  It was great fun, although it did seem <br/>
like the moms were more into it than the young girls!  ;-)<br/>
Fat Chance Belly Dance is a great tribal troupe to watch/study!  I <br/>
LOVE this troupe which is based in San Fran., CA.<br/>
<br/>
If a touring group called Belly Dance SuperStars come to your town- <br/>
do not miss them!  They&#39;re HOT!  I just caught them for the second <br/>
year yesterday.  Oh, and bring spending money as they have stuff to <br/>
sell during intermission.  They are also coming out with a movie in <br/>
February about the forming of the touring act and also the <br/>
controversies surrounding belly dance between the sexes and since <br/>
September 11th.<br/>

It&#39;s interesting, like a train wreck.<br/>
The belly dancing objection kind floored me, though, as my kids have seen <br/>
lots of bellydance in and around the SCA, and some outside of there as another <br/>
homeschooling mom did parties and once took Kirby and Holly as her sound guy and <br/>
her lovely costumed assistant. She had made Holly a very cool little <br/>
cabaret-style costume when she was seven or so.<br/>
