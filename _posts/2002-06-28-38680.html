<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050513658">Personally, I believe when a child hits, if it isn&#39;t self defense, and the <br/>
child hitting is &quot;guilty&quot;, there should be the social skill of saying &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry&quot; to the one they hit.<br/>
I am a public school teacher.  During the summer now I am subbing with little <br/>
kiddos.  There is often a hit given; we stop, and yes, we talk, BUT the child <br/>
knows they owe the other one an apology.  AND, the other child needs to <br/>
accept the apology.  You can&#39;t imagine in one week, how much mellower these <br/>
children have become.<br/>
And yes, I do have one volatile boy.  His parents are split up. he&#39;s mad.  I <br/>
don&#39;t blame him.  Daily, however, I remind him it is okay to be angry and mad <br/>
BUT when he is yelling at all of us and then kicking other kids around him <br/>
and calling names, that type of anger isn&#39;t acceptable.  However, I tell him <br/>
and suggest he can go by himself to another part of the room or restroom to <br/>
yell and kick.  And I ask him to let me know when he is calmer and when he is <br/>
ready for some &quot;hug&quot; time.  The hugging is really what calms him and what he <br/>
lacks.  Yep. LOVE!  That has been my overall evaluation in the school <br/>
setting.<br/>
In our home, hitting just isn&#39;t allowed , period!  Controlling?  perhaps!  <br/>
Too bad!  We are not into violence that is physical. We don&#39;t like verbal <br/>
violence either, but we are more tolerant in the home of this, but highly <br/>
encourage our children to talk  respectfully as much as possible.<br/>
Just a few thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Now a question..<br/>
Do any of you know anything about adult ADD?<br/>
You can email me privately about this.  Thanks.<br/>

They didn&#39;t improve how I felt, perhaps made me even angrier at my sister<br/>
(and my mom) because the sitaution was still unresolved and what counted was<br/>
the pretense that everything was okay.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps when there&#39;s one person responsible for many kids and the goal is to<br/>
get them to behave it&#39;s a useful technique to train them to act the way they<br/>
&quot;should&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But I suspect it&#39;s the stopping and talking that&#39;s improving the behavior,<br/>
not the forced apologies.<br/>

&gt; sorry&quot; to the one they hit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The primary reason that I pulled my 12 year old son out of school, was becaus<br/>
e of teachers and administrators like you. Well meaning, but mostly <br/>
ineffectual. My son was teased, kicked and spat on in public school (fourth <br/>
and fifth grade). The perpetrators would be told to apologize and then would <br/>
smirk at him behind the teachers&#39; back. It never stopped, he just stopped <br/>
going to them for help because he knew it was a waste of time. Probably to <br/>
the teachers, it looked like things were &quot;more peaceful.&quot; Next I put him in a <br/>
very academic (and expensive) private school. In the private school, it was <br/>
ten times worse. There, in 6th and half of 7th grade, the kids were bigger, <br/>
stronger, more accomplished at being sneaky. My son was teased, kicked, spat <br/>
on, punched, bodyslammed, insulted all day, threatened, and shunned. The dean <br/>
of students at the school was a really nice guy, who could not have been more <br/>
useless. Every time someone did something to my son, thay&#39;d all have a big <br/>
heart to heart. The bullies would put on their sweetest and most contrite <br/>
expressions, say a &quot;heartfelt&quot; apology to my son, and then call him a &quot;fagot&quot; <br/>
the minute they&#39;d left the presence of the adult. On the few occasions that <br/>
some sort of punishment was meted out, they&#39;d get him back for it. The <br/>
punishments were never as bad as the crimes, and they all knew it.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I realized (I can be incredibly thick sometimes) that he had only <br/>
two choices in such situations. Response A, was to hide out with all the <br/>
other nonconformists in the library or artroom and keep his mouth shut the <br/>
rest of the time. This group accepts that they are somehow inferior. Response <br/>
B, was to join the the nasty bullies and &quot;popular&quot; kids by being nasty just <br/>
like them. This group assumes that they are naturally superior, because <br/>
anyone who disagrees is beaten emotionally or physically into submission or <br/>
oblivion. I started to see my son turning into a nasty.<br/>
<br/>
We chose response C. We started homeschooling. We are still feeling our way <br/>
along, and not quite sure how to proceed. We don&#39;t quite know what approach <br/>
we&#39;ll end up with, but I am at least sure I&#39;ll never leave him in such a <br/>
hopeless situation again, for even 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
One last point. I tried to get the school to implement an anti-bullying <br/>
program that would be preventative by holding many supervised discussions <br/>
about acceptance of nonconformity, and many other issues that concern kids <br/>
and human beings in general. But at the same time, I did expect them to <br/>
implement consequences (yes I know that&#39;s a fancy word for punishment) when <br/>
people are unkind or just plain cruel to others. <br/>
<br/>
What I tell my kids, is that not only is cruel behavior wrong, and totally <br/>
unacceptable, but in this society, if you grow up and punch somebody you <br/>
don&#39;t like or agree with, you go to jail. <br/>
<br/>
There are many unpleasant and pleasant natural consequences for our behavior. <br/>
Childhood is the best time to learn this, with the help of our family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946417045">Not all children who hit are bad kids or bullies. <br/>
Sometimes hitting is the only way a child, especially<br/>
a boy has in trying to defend himself against those<br/>
who constantly pick, spit or in other unviolent ways<br/>
hurt a child.  It is very hard for some adults to<br/>
constantly take this behavior which is abuse without<br/>
losing it.  What makes us think a child is any<br/>
different.  I have four children two of which were in<br/>
school and I took them out for this reason also, there<br/>
was no way my other two were going to be exposed to<br/>
that mess.<br/>
<br/>
When I have fighting among my children, even if there<br/>
is hitting or any kind of physical behavior I send<br/>
both to their rooms and ask them to think about what<br/>
there part was in the altercation.  Because even if<br/>
the other person didn&#39;t hit there may have been some<br/>
verbal abuse going on.  While there is never a reason<br/>
for physical violence both verbal and physical abuse<br/>
are equally harmful to a child.  Often times the<br/>
verbal abuse is more so because it is harder to see<br/>
and detect.  It is this verbal abuse which goes<br/>
undetected over a period of time results in violence.<br/>
<br/>
After my children come out of their room they tell me<br/>
what their part in it was and we sit and talk about it<br/>
and discuss how they could have reacted differently. <br/>
They usually don&#39;t want to do this, they want to sit<br/>
and blast the other and place blame.  But blaming<br/>
others is counter productive, I am trying to teach my<br/>
children that we have a part in every situation, and<br/>
in every situation we can learn something about<br/>
ourselves.<br/>

VERY good point.<br/>
And verbal abuse is legal.  And it&#39;s easy to remember.  It can become a sound <br/>
loop in the person&#39;s mind that could play for life without them really <br/>
hearing it loudly.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect a lot of parents who are mean to their kids are being so in <br/>
response to recorded voices in their heads.<br/>
<br/>
I learned to turn mine up a little and think &quot;What was that?  Louder?&quot; and if <br/>
it&#39;s old and stupid, I tell it to be ashamed of itself and never play in my <br/>
head again. &lt;g&gt;  Or I play them as souvenir reminders.  My granny telling me <br/>
&quot;You have book smarts but no horse sense.&quot;  I used to really worry about that <br/>
when I was a kid and a young adult.  Now I think clearly &quot;Whatever!  I&#39;m not <br/>
the mother of drunks and jailbirds.&quot;  (Not yet, anyway, and I see some <br/>
contributing factors I have managed to avoid already.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Boy, I&#39;ve heard that one! I have an ex-husband (emphasis on the EX) who used <br/>
to call me dumb constantly when it was generally agreed by others that I was <br/>
definitely the smarter of the two of us. Then one day I witnessed his father <br/>
verbally abusing his mother, a very intelligent lady with a PhD, and using <br/>
the nearly-exact words my Ex used on me. It was definitely a wake-up call.<br/>
