 </span></blockquote>Bear with me and let me see if I can explain this without it sounding <br/>
like a release of one&#39;s self responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
A person&#39;s self-worth is what determines their choices in life. So in <br/>
order to avoid intergenerational dysfunctions, somebody in the line has <br/>
to stop and change that path.<br/>
<br/>
If a person was raised with self-worth, they will most likely make <br/>
choices that will allow unschooling to fall easier in their path. Such as <br/>
a supportive spouse. Which then snowballs into falling within the normal <br/>
realm of daily issues that arise. And the decision to unschool won&#39;t be <br/>
AS MUCH as an uphill battle as say the scenario below.<br/>
<br/>
Now, lets say you have someone who had a dysfunctionally controlling <br/>
parent. This person then marries a controlling spouse. At some point, <br/>
they &#39;wake&#39; up and realize that this isn&#39;t what life and parenting are <br/>
all about, and decide they want to take steps to make changes. So they <br/>
pull the kids out of school and start unschooling. The spouse is now <br/>
going nuts because dinner isn&#39;t on the table by X o&#39;clock, the house is <br/>
messier now that the kids are home, and the spouse is unyielding and <br/>
relentless in being a thorn in the side of the parent trying to change.<br/>
<br/>
This parent now has a bigger hurdle to jump, and the steps towards <br/>
unschooling may be slow even though the wishes of the parent is to make <br/>
giant ones.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you might say, well that person should leave. This time I can speak <br/>
from personal experience. I left my unhusband because I did not want to <br/>
live in NYC and he would not move. Being a single mother isn&#39;t easy, and <br/>
it makes it much harder to unschool. I chose to live near a Sudbury <br/>
Valley school (my personal choice over unschooling). But it wasn&#39;t an <br/>
easy ride AND I only have one child. I can&#39;t tell another person to do <br/>
what I did. It wasn&#39;t easy and it takes a certain personality to do so. I <br/>
also ended up homeless and broke for a short period of time. Again, not a <br/>
choice I would tell someone to make. I can&#39;t imagine what a parent of 2+ <br/>
kids would do. Most of them choose to stay. <br/>
<br/>
I give the people credit that want to change the intergenerational <br/>
tendencies and move forward. But its sometimes yields more struggles for <br/>
one, than it does for others.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let this conversation sound like one person has a bed of roses and <br/>
another doesn&#39;t. We all have our hurdles to jump. Some people have big <br/>
ones, and some have smaller ones.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes one side can&#39;t relate to the other.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see what you are getting at.  But I also think that maybe you don&#39;t know<br/>
the pasts of some of the people involved!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that this makes things a lot more difficult.  If it helps any<br/>
to know, this is my second marriage and in many ways my second family.<br/>
I have an adult son who was traditionally schooled.  I did a lot of<br/>
work on myself while I was single to get where I am today.  I also<br/>
found a supportive spouse this time around - he&#39;s is as an unschooler<br/>
as I am!<br/>
<br/>
I hope we can support you in whatever ways you need.  Being a single<br/>
mother is difficult.  If something ever happened where my children<br/>
needed to go to a brick-and-mortar school, I&#39;d use a Sudbury Valley<br/>
one too.  And if it helps, I have seen a lot of support for those<br/>
parents who want to unschool and who can&#39;t fully because of a spouse&#39;s<br/>
objection.  Leaving isn&#39;t always an option and it isn&#39;t always in the<br/>
best interest of the child either.  Sometimes it is hard to share <br/>
personal information on lists like this but it does help to understand<br/>
the specifics for each family.<br/>
