&gt; Subject: RE: Gatto Book title?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I firmly believe the Underground History of American Education by John<br/>
&gt; &gt; Taylor Gatto is a must read.  It will help tremendously in explaining to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;educator&quot; type family & friends why we don&#39;t want to send our kids to<br/>
&gt; &gt; school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went to search for this book on Amazon and could not find it. Is this the<br/>
&gt; correct title? Any hints on where I can find it? I liked his other book,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; and would be interested to read this one if I could get my<br/>
&gt; hands on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks very much, Ashley Harvie, mom to Willis, 5, and Frances, 2<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is because it&#39;s not published yet.  What is out is the pre-published edition, the way Gatto wants it to read, before the publisher&#39;s get their hands on it and change it!<br/>
<br/>
You can get it through Holt Bookstore, F.U.N. Books, Practical Homeschooling and maybe HEM.<br/>

&quot;What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for<br/>
children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than<br/>
the schools,but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.&quot;<br/>
