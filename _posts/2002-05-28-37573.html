&lt;&lt; We have a young bird that I have taken under my wing LOL<br/>
 It has its feathers. And apprently trying to fly.<br/>
 Any idea&#39;s what to feed it. Gave it water in a dropper.<br/>
 Tried mashing up worms, blah! but he won&#39;t have anything to do with it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Put it back in the nest if you can. What kind of bird is it? Bluejays are <br/>
watched over by their parents even after they leave the nest. The fledlings <br/>
are dangerously hanging out on the ground for a couple of days before they <br/>
finally take off.<br/>
Many parent birds partially digest the food and regurgitate it into the <br/>
babies beak.<br/>
The best thing you can do is either put it back in the nest or get it to a <br/>
wildlife sanctuary as quickly as possible.<br/>
They have special bird &quot;formula&quot;.<br/>
Try Audobon society or a vet to find someone that will help.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve gotten a lot of great ideas and been forced to <br/>
 think things through differently here, by Sandra and a number of <br/>
 others.  Some of those helpful others say that they initially felt the same <br/>
 as I did about her style.  But you know what?  I&#39;ve gotten little to no <br/>
 help from any of the people who come here and snipe at Sandra and her <br/>
 posting style. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here.<br/>
I don&#39;t see bluntness equal to rudeness.<br/>
Clarity equal to an attack.<br/>
Experience equal to meanness.<br/>
I think it&#39;s something called defensiveness that causes people to react that <br/>
way to certain posts. If we just think through the information and read it at <br/>
face value, there is no meanness, no rudeness. Just to the point and true.<br/>
Or maybe there is some projection going on?<br/>
