<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531903860">to help people understand unschooling better <br/>
to build a sense of community<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those are the things we are charged to help do here on the unschooling-dotcom <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
The first I totally can support, and have been doing this to the best of my <br/>
ability for years, in person, in writing, by phone (those whose numbers are <br/>
listed as local contacts know...), and online.<br/>
<br/>
There is no one &quot;community&quot; of unschoolers, nor is there a national support <br/>
group for unschoolers, nor any of the things which are true of some other <br/>
subgroups within homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
A mailing list is a resource for information.  If a sense of community <br/>
develops, that&#39;s a bonus.  It can&#39;t be induced or forced.  It is possible to <br/>
point out when people are compromising the chance of a sense of community <br/>
(and I might have this pointed out to me after this post, I know).<br/>
<br/>
But for me, the two are nowhere near to equal in importance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known some unschooling families who never went to any homeschooling <br/>
groups, didn&#39;t join any organizations whatsoever, don&#39;t go to playgroups or <br/>
park days and don&#39;t subscribe to magazines.   Having discovered what <br/>
unschooling could be, they went out on their own without need for or desire <br/>
for a community of unschoolers, because they were in the community of the <br/>
real world, and had enough confidence to live there without &quot;support.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There must be a million--literally a thousand thousand--places to go for <br/>
homeschooling information, good or bad.  Local groups, newsletters, family <br/>
websites, sermons posted on the web, scheduled presentations of curriculum <br/>
sellers to local homeschooling groups, conferences, workshops, newspaper <br/>
articles, library resource folders, and there are Christian homeschooling <br/>
conference which can draw 5000 or more people at once.  <br/>
<br/>
The resources for unschoolers are very much slimmer and more limited, but <br/>
this list has been and can be a great source.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not my favorite, but it does have the potential to change lives for the <br/>
better.  It has the potential to empower families to empower themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Seekers don&#39;t need community as much as they need clarity and input.<br/>
<br/>
When anyone is learning anything, there are better sources and worse ones.  <br/>
Not every book on the Civil War is easy to understand and balanced.  Not <br/>
every report of the holocaust is written by someone who really knows what <br/>
he&#39;s talking about and has something new and thoughtful to say about it.  Not <br/>
all sets of directions can be followed successfully.  <br/>
<br/>
Regardless of all other factors, it would be good for newcomers to this or <br/>
any list to remember that some of the people who are offering opinions are <br/>
not, themselves, taking their own advice.  Not all people who say &quot;I&#39;ve been <br/>
unschooling for ten years&quot; would be considered to have been unschooling by <br/>
other observers.  Or they might be counting from conception instead of from <br/>
school age (a debate we know well &lt;g&gt;).  Some who say &quot;unschooling has always <br/>
worked perfectly for our family&quot; have had kids in and out of school (not a <br/>
great sin, but a factor to be considered).<br/>
<br/>
And above all, nobody needs to depend on one source for all information.--not <br/>
one person, list, company, government summary, policy, nothing.   <br/>
<br/>
The way adults can learn is the way children can learn--by exposure, thought, <br/>
practice, more exposure, practice, new input, time to think, another pass at <br/>
the first exposure, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
One bad way to learn is to come and get one set of directions, go away and <br/>
follow them, and declare it all learned and over with.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t <br/>
work that way.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t learn to write a bicycle in the absence of a bicycle, and you can&#39;t <br/>
learn what unschooling is or how it works without actually trying it, doing <br/>
it, getting feedback (from any and all involved), thinking, adjusting, and <br/>
living with it in your life.<br/>
<br/>
So when you (anyone here or anywhere, newcomer, repeat-seeker, first or <br/>
second year, convert from Calvert, longterm unschooler) read ideas and <br/>
experiences, let them settle.  Let them soak in.  Try some out.  Before you <br/>
decide with confidence that someone is your favorite writer, let some time <br/>
pass and see how the information looks in different lights.  See whether the <br/>
writer is consistent, and really seems concerned with helping others.  <br/>
Synthesize your own body of knowledge from the best parts of what you gather <br/>
by reading, observing, and experimentation. <br/>
<br/>
The list can&#39;t be everything for anyone, but it can be something for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who uses it is responsible for his or her own use, and shouldn&#39;t <br/>
attack the first day or week out.  (Thereafter you probably wouldn&#39;t want to, <br/>
anyway.) Bring your own good judgement and don&#39;t try to make it something it <br/>
isn&#39;t, or customize it for yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t so easy to understand.  It&#39;s possible to paddle around in <br/>
it without really swimming.  But if we keep adding useful information to the <br/>
pool of knowledge we&#39;re sharing, it will continue to be a resource for <br/>
earnest learners.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I can agree with this.  I think having a sense of <br/>
community is important for many people in anything they do.  I also <br/>
think that when you are struggling with a specific problem it is <br/>
really easy to feel all alone if everyone you hear from is adamant <br/>
about telling you that it is not a problem for them.  Sometimes, it is <br/>
just helpful to here from someone who has BTDT and know you are not <br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
Some people find strength in individuality, some find it in community.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665018061"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Please do not directly communicate with me again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone contacts you (that&#39;s a general you) off list, and you don&#39;t want<br/>
them to, click on the email and then click Delete.<br/>
<br/>
Or set your eamil program to filter any emails from their address to the<br/>
Trash so you don&#39;t even have to see it in your mail box. (You can ask on<br/>
list for help. (Informing us that you&#39;re trying to prevent someone on the<br/>
list from contacting you won&#39;t be a necessary part of the question.)<br/>
<br/>
Or contact your internet provider to see what their criteria of spamming or<br/>
other harrassment is.<br/>
<br/>
*Please* don&#39;t bring such exchanges to the list. It doesn&#39;t help anyone<br/>
understand more about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We might be able argue this, but the freedom to email someone sounds like<br/>
freedom of speech to me. We should all be free to email whomever we want.<br/>
But just because someone emails you doesn&#39;t mean you need to read it.<br/>
<br/>
DELETE IT.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps one of the more useful lessons in life is that we have very little<br/>
power to control what others do but we have a huge amount of power to<br/>
control what *we* do.<br/>
<br/>
You have the tools. Learn to use them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953649749">Okay, here&#39;s what I was trying to get across by using the word community. I<br/>
was trying to avoid writing a whole sentence and thought the one word<br/>
community would convey what I meant but since words can mean different<br/>
things to different people ...<br/>
<br/>
Gee, where have I heard that discussion before? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
By community I mean create an atmosphere where the purpose of this list:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;to discuss unschooling in ways designed to help each other become<br/>
unschoolers or become better at unschooling&quot;<br/>
<br/>
can be carried out.<br/>
<br/>
If in pursuit of the purpose we destroy the place that makes it possible to<br/>
carry it out (Helen could pull the plug!) or chase away so many people that<br/>
we&#39;re only talking to a handful, then we&#39;ve lost the ability to pursue the<br/>
purpose.<br/>
<br/>
So if it doesn&#39;t help someone understand more about unschooling, don&#39;t hit<br/>
send.<br/>
<br/>
(Which probably covered the &quot;community&quot; part anyway. But I reserve the right<br/>
to change my mind later ;-)<br/>

<br/>
There are hundreds of people here, many who never say a word and we don&#39;t <br/>
even know they&#39;re here. What you meant by &quot;community&quot; sounds more like <br/>
creating an &quot;environment&quot; that is supportive and conducive to people asking <br/>
questions and getting a variety of answers as well as a place for unschoolers <br/>
to toss ideas around and bounce them off of each other. Community had more <br/>
connotations than that, to me. <br/>

unschool a kid without it . . . especially when the advice doesn&#39;t <br/>
even begin to address the problems.<br/>
