<div id="ygrps-yiv-70759877">Wow,<br/>
I seemed to have touch a nerve. I mentioned my father because I felt it was<br/>
appropriate to the discussion, sorry if you felt it was inappropriate. In<br/>
addition I enjoy reading all the posts for they offer a different slant on<br/>
htings, life in general, that is the reason I am here. I can&#39;t recall, but<br/>
wasn&#39;t there a recent post from Arizona? Where are you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105456165">Last post because we seem to be talking at cross purposes here.  What you<br/>
said about your father wasn&#39;t inappropriate, nor did it &quot;hit a nerve.&quot;  What<br/>
was irritating was being told to be &quot;careful&quot; when I had purposely used<br/>
phrasing which clearly stated that I wasn&#39;t including all doctors just so no<br/>
one would feel they needed to make such remarks.<br/>
