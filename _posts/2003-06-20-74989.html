 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never had anything but gratefulness shown from flight attendants when<br/>
I&#39;ve nursed my kids (even at age 2 or 3) on an airplane. For one thing, a<br/>
breastfeeding child is not screaming, jumping on the seats, or running into<br/>
the drink cart, LOL. The only comment I ever got was from a woman seated<br/>
across from me on one of those Southwest airplanes with the four facing<br/>
seats. She said she thought it was &quot;unnatural&quot;. Funny thing, her profession<br/>
was a stripper. Yeah, it&#39;s &quot;natural&quot; to pump them full of silicone and twirl<br/>
them around in front of 50 year old men, but not natural to feed a baby with<br/>
them? Yeesh.<br/>

You&#39;re funny. Thanks for the laugh and I definitely agree with you!<br/>
