<div id="ygrps-yiv-462697004">Being from the states, living in Canada and being a nurse I am constantly amazed<br/>
by the bs emanating from the states re: health care.  The number of lies told<br/>
about the Canadian system is unbelievable.  There is a concerted effort by<br/>
American insurance companies, et. al. to propagandize against a Canadian style<br/>
system which provides more than adequate coverage for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It was a sickening thing to watch Clinton and company cave in almost immediately<br/>
to the huge vested interests in the US when attempting to reform health care.<br/>
The big lie technique works so well.  Tell everyone that Canadians have no<br/>
choice of doctors when in fact we have more freedom to choose our own doctor<br/>
here than anyone in the states who is in an HMO.<br/>
<br/>
Jingoism, chauvinism and blind ignorance prevail.  Ah once again the real aim of<br/>
schooling is alive and well...serve the interests of the very rich, obey, do NOT<br/>
think.  Under no circumstances question the status quo. Everything is WONDERFUL.<br/>
We live in the best of all possible worlds.<br/>
<br/>
Poor people can die in the streets but it is their own fault.<br/>
<br/>
I am delighted to work in the Canadian system in spite of its imperfections.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s where I must go now.  End of rant.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a few weeks ago, a bright young 18 year old girl from our community<br/>
&gt; suffered a severe spinal injury which is expected to leave her permanently<br/>
&gt; paralyzed from the waist down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This accident occurred while she was away at a college where she had entered<br/>
&gt; as a freshman just last August.  Luckily, she had been wise enough to<br/>
&gt; purchase the medical insurance policy available to students through the<br/>
&gt; college.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sadly, she has already almost maxed out her benefits.  She will need<br/>
&gt; continuing treatment for many months and years to come.  In addition, her<br/>
&gt; parents and younger brother must now move out of the house they were renting<br/>
&gt; into another house which will be more suitable for their handicapped<br/>
&gt; daughter.  The new house will need to be fitted with a variety of items just<br/>
&gt; to allow this daughter to function on a daily basis.  Such adaptations will<br/>
&gt; easily add up to tens of thousands of dollars of additional expense.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Friends of the family have already started an effort to raise funds to help<br/>
&gt; this family meet these anticipated gigantic financial obligations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is just another example of how getting sick or injured in the United<br/>
&gt; States can not only devastate your health, but your finances as well.  Hey,<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t argue that it&#39;s a great country to live in as long as you&#39;re young,<br/>
&gt; healthy, and have adequate coverage.  It&#39;s just when one or more of those<br/>
&gt; factors changes that things can get precarious.  Some time ago, I learned<br/>
&gt; that the<br/>
&gt; United States and South Africa are the only two major industrialized<br/>
&gt; countries<br/>
&gt; which don&#39;t provide universal medical coverage for all of their citizens.<br/>

He did cave quickly didn&#39;t he?  Makes you wonder, did he really cave or was it just that he had never truly planned to reach for a <br/>
difference in the first place.  I tend to believe that despite the convoluted mess that was his idea if he had truly wanted to break<br/>
the hold insurance has on America he would have done it or at least kept trying.  I think he simply made a bid to attract sympathy<br/>
from the &quot;average joe&quot; and made a quick about face just in time to make sure he didn&#39;t make the good ol boys too upset, you know?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh Well, there goes my ranting and raving for the night.  <br/>
