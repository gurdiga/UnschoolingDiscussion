Stanley was the cartoon that I was thinking of when I wrote this!  I <br/>
really like that show.  Of course, there are others that I like as <br/>
well.  I just really like the Disney channel for morning cartoons.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure about the afternoon because she usually isn&#39;t watching <br/>
TV by then (either too busy playing or watching her videos instead).<br/>

<br/>
If parents tell kids which shows are &quot;stinkers,&quot; the parents could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably a good idea to let the kids decide whether they like programs <br/>
or not without telling them which are good influences or bad influences.  They <br/>
might honestly see some subtlety you don&#39;t see.<br/>
<br/>
My mother said The Friendly Giant was a stupid show.  I&#39;ve seen parents <br/>
badmouth Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street to their very young children.  I&#39;ve heard <br/>
tons of people badmouth Barney to their children.  In every case I have thought <br/>
that the program was much wiser and kinder than the mother was being to her own <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
When people told me in my childhood that what I was listening to was not <br/>
music, they were wrong. <br/>
<br/>
When my mother said The Friendly Giant was a stupid show, she was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better when children think their mothers are gentle and good, than for <br/>
them to start to think early on that their mothers are mean and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
We had overnight company last night.  Dad, little girl, live-in girlfriend.  <br/>
I&#39;ve known them all for many years.  I know the bio mom too; she&#39;s awful.   <br/>
But the girlfriend isn&#39;t lots better.   She is disdainful of just about <br/>
everything on earth.  Cynical, negative, clucks her tongue and rolls her eyes and <br/>
insults and belittles and is just a stream of criticism about whatever movies or <br/>
ideas or games or hobbies people might express interest in.  It&#39;s just a really <br/>
bad habit with her.  I think she sees it as being discerning and intelligent, <br/>
but it&#39;s just looking at the world through suck-colored glasses.   <br/>
<br/>
I prefer those optimistic joy-colored glasses.<br/>

DH and I took DD to see The Wiggles in concert last year.  We all <br/>
loved it!  They really interacted with the kids, even came out into <br/>
the audiance and talked to lots of them.  If you brought a rose, <br/>
Dorthy would come out and take it from the kids (DD loved that).  <br/>
The aisles were large enough for the kids (and some parents) to sing <br/>
and dance in.  It was a great show.  I am keeping an eye out too see <br/>
when they might be in our area again.<br/>

Stanley, Rolie Polie Olie, the Wiggles (for younger kids--but I *loved* <br/>
their Christmas beach party--they&#39;re Australian). Afternoon shows are <br/>
geared to an older (afterschool) group, so I don&#39;t know them.<br/>

<br/>
Ahhhhh, the Friendly Giant! I can barely remember the show, it was <br/>
one we watched very early in the morning, i don&#39;t think i was even in <br/>
school yet. I have such warm memories of the thought of this show, <br/>
even though i don&#39;t remember anything about it. I feel warm and cozy <br/>
and safe just thinking about it. <br/>
<br/>
I never watched Mr. Rogers, we had Mr. Dressup (with his little <br/>
puppet Casey), which i think was Canadian, but we get alot of <br/>
Canadian tv here in Michigan. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Lucky woman. &lt;g&gt; My kids still love Mr. Dressup (Ernie Coombs was from the US originally and came up in the 60&#39;s I think with his friend--wait for it--Fred Rogers! They came up to do children&#39;s shows for the CBC. Rogers left for PBS later but Coombs stayed. He finally became a Canadian citizen in the 90&#39;s and died a couple of years ago). I&#39;m a devoted CBC fan <br/>
  and feel for all the American&#39;s that never get to see the shows that CBC produces.<br/>

High&quot; and later &quot;Degrassi High&quot; (didnt really watch &quot;Kids of Degrassi <br/>
Street&quot;), I remember being so impressed back in high school when <br/>
Degrassi High did an abortion episode. I doubt any show for kids here <br/>
wouldve tackled that issue at the time(and i think PBS, which also <br/>
aired Degrassi High, cut the final scene which featured a fetal <br/>
model), the kid actors also gave input on the script. My brother is a <br/>
huge fan of CBC (was really into &quot;Avonlea&quot;, i think it was called?)<br/>
and has now turned me on to this great funny show called &quot;This is <br/>
Wonderland&quot;, i cannot get over how smart and funny this program is!<br/>
<br/>
One thing i had forgotten about living so close to Canada (i just <br/>
moved back to MI from OH last month)was all the Canadian money <br/>
floating around. Stores even have signs &quot;No Canadian quarters!&quot;, <br/>
although i&#39;m usually able to slip one in unnoticed.*g*<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Yes! I was a fan from the first episode! It really gives you a view into how crazy and unfair the (or our) legal system can be and a lot of compassion for everyone involved...And huge belly laughs that have my husband asking what I&#39;m watching. The other must see is &#39;DaVinci&#39;s Inquest&#39;. It&#39;s on Sunday nights and puts any other crime drama I have ever seen to shame (Even CSI has become sensational and dull to me now). It&#39;s really smart, has story arcs that stretch as long as several TV seasons or as short as a show and has some of the most subtle and fresh acting on TV. I&#39;m raving I know but watch it. I&#39;ve heard it has American fans who&#39;ve written CBC begging for tapes when they haven&#39;t gotten their fix. :)<br/>
