<div><font size="4">wow, thats rough.I can see how it would leave you&nbsp;torn.  
Have you been able to talk to your daughter since this happened? Is she 
withdrawn? Have you reassured her of your love? She may feel like she betrayed 
you. Does your son realize how unfair his question was? Why did he ask her that 
in the first place? Do you still notice the mood swing periods since you have 
been homeschooling? Does she communicate her feelings&nbsp;much when she seems 
down? Maybe you could keep a mood journal of sorts and see&nbsp;if you notice a 
pattern or&nbsp;possibly something that triggers her moods. What you have 
described reminds me of my sister growing up. She had her teddy bear, which she 
still has. I can understand being anxious about the medical community. I think 
they used my sister like a guinea pig, trying different things to see what 
worked. Many caused more damage than good. Learn all you can before you let any 
doctor medicate her. I wish I had some easy answers, but all I can offer is the 
sympathy of a mother who understands how much this situation must make you hurt. 
I&#39;m sure you&nbsp;will pursue whatever you find that will help your 
daughter.&nbsp;My prayers will go with you.</font></div>
