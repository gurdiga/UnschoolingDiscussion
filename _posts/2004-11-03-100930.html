Danielle Conger writes about the difference between rules and principles  and <br/>
notes, &quot;If, after careful consideration, we adopt a principle, we  <br/>
internalize it and thoughtfully apply it to countless situations throughout our  life. <br/>
There is no external threat demanding our adherence, only our own internal  <br/>
sense of right and wrong. Living by principles offers our children both the  <br/>
model of an ethical life and the opportunity to grow as ethical and just  <br/>
individuals.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Woohoo!<br/>
