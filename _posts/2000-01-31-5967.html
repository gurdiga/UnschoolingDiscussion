<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082602251">I&#39;ll always remember the feeling my dh and I had after the first Waldorf information meetng we attended.  It was a feeling difficult to describe--incredibly compelling.  Our oldest daughter attended a Waldorf school through the 7th grade (skipping 6th to try homeschooling) and the youngest through the 2nd grade.  Our school had a lot of political stuff going on (as all organizations do), but as soon as the door on the classroom closed, all that was separate from the children. The teachers/administrators, etc., almost without exception, had tremendous respect and love for the children.  It was unbelievable how much TIME they all took from their own lives--I think the school just became their lives.<br/>
<br/>
The kindergarten, though, was the best experience. It was somewhat like living in a fairy tale or at least living in an atmosphere that corresponded with the feelings of a very young child. Both my children--especially the oldest, who had more time there, appreciate that they were able to experience it.<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;best of all worlds&quot; wish, though, would have been to have had the kindergarten experience followed by a few hours of the week at the school with the same people (a class, working on a play, doing some handwork...).  Every day, five days a week, is too much time away from the family, even at a Waldorf school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495668964">I&#39;m interested in learning about the Waldorf philosophy.  What<br/>
books/websites are generally recommended?  Would it be worth a long trip<br/>
to visit a Waldorf school to see what it looks like?  We don&#39;t have any<br/>
alternative schools in the my area, but I could go to a major TX city if<br/>
it would be worth it (just to look and visit).<br/>
<br/>
I understand that Oak Meadow is kind of a modified Waldorf cirriculum.<br/>
Are there any others?<br/>

Yes Susan, that would be great if there could be a waldorf kindergarten<br/>
style drop in resource center with curriculum and classes for parents the<br/>
way the Christian Homeschoolers up here have one. If hs families could go as<br/>
they needed and wanted rather than the time and expense of a 5 day<br/>
situation. Also I would imagine having to share your child with one other<br/>
adult for all those years can be somewhat difficult and emotional at times.<br/>
Though it definately beats the current ps system esp. if you like the<br/>
teacher and they do love your child! What is your oldest doing now?<br/>

<br/>
Sorry, Beth...and Mara!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I remember the first grade Waldorf<br/>
teacher having to take my daughter for a long walk..<br/>
<br/>
..That is amazing though that her teacher would do this for her...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did find the teachers amazing a lot of the time. Their dedication was spiritual--it certainly wasn&#39;t because they were making any kind of money!<br/>

when I looked into it when Zak was 2... They wanted him to learn how <br/>
to wash glasses (yes real glass when he was 2) and when he smashed <br/>
one by dropping it on the concrete floor I realized it wasn&#39;t a good <br/>
place.  I asked the question &quot;why does he need to learn how to wash <br/>
glasses, we have a dishwasher and that&#39;s what he&#39;ll probably always <br/>
use?&quot;  The woman running the program glared at me and said &quot;they need <br/>
to learn to do everything and we need to teach them&quot;... Zak wanted to <br/>
play on the swings in only his diaper and in the sand... They wanted <br/>
him to sit in a circle and cut up fruit with a knife and sing <br/>
songs... LOL LOL LOL... I can&#39;t stop laughing now when I think back <br/>
on that experience and since then the friends that I&#39;ve talked to <br/>
who&#39;ve had a similar experience with their kids... Decided if he <br/>
wanted to cut up fruit with a knife (a) he&#39;d be a lot older and (b) <br/>
I&#39;d be there helping him not handing him the knife at 2 years old....</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668871033">Hi,<br/>
  I am not an expert at Waldorf, but for a couple of years ago, that was<br/>
what I wanted for my children, and I read  a few things, and I have<br/>
Oakmeadow&#39;s first grade curriculum. However, I have gotten to the point<br/>
where I still love some Waldorf ideas, and thougouly enjoyed a Waldorf<br/>
Conference last year, but I don&#39;t attempt to &quot;teach&quot; anything. I just don&#39;t<br/>
believe that people can teach anyone anything unless the learning person has<br/>
a desire for the information or maybe if they are somehow coerced into it,<br/>
like a Pavlov dog, and then, they are just going through the motions, but<br/>
missed out on the joy of discovery.<br/>
 I still find the Oakmeadow books and supplies useful around the house, but<br/>
I don&#39;t follow any recipes for a happy, educated, well balanced child. I<br/>
notice that my children are extremely happy when I step out of their way,<br/>
and they keep extremely busy and are constantly learning. That doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
that I am not involved in what they are learning, because we do have lots of<br/>
things around that they may need help with, and quite often they want help,<br/>
a suggestion, or want to work together on something.<br/>
Also, I really believe in what I wrote above, but I must confess that<br/>
occasionally I get a little uptight with my older child, and question myself<br/>
about what we are doing, but it is just fear, concern whatever, but so far,<br/>
I&#39;ve snapped out of it, and I remember that I have total confidence in her.<br/>
Also, sometimes I step back into teacher mode (I have a degree in<br/>
education), but my kids usually lose interested immediately when I act up,<br/>
and I usually end up doing whatever I decided to teach them myself.<br/>
