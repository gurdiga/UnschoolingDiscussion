Yesterday when we were all in the pool, I spotted a tiny lady bug floating<br/>
to the bottom. I thought it was dead but soon found out it wasn&#39;t. Joseph,<br/>
Sierra and I watched that little bug for almost 25 minutes trying to dry off<br/>
enough to fly away. Just the 3 of us sitting mesmerized by the pool watching<br/>
this tiny little thing spread it&#39;s wings only to flop around some. Finally<br/>
it took off and we all cheered. I think I was happier than the kids!!!!<br/>

What timing with all this ant farm talk!  Just a few hours ago we received the ants we ordered a month ago.  We have had this ant farm kit since last summer.  We were inspired to finally order the ants when Gillen and Jesse and I spent about twenty minutes one afternoon on our deck watching one ant carry a piece of dead insect- that was bigger than the ant - to its nest in our house wall. It had to crawl across many gaps in the wooden boards and we were cheering it on the whoe way.  I have gotten so into watching animals with theboys that I started video taping all of our animal finds several years ago- our own nature video.  The I saw &quot;Microcosmos&quot; last week (a movie with amazing close up animal photography) and I have taken a break.  It is more fun to just watch live, for now.  <br/>
<br/>
The irony of the ants we ordered is that they are fire ants - the same ants that farmer DH is attempting to get rid of at the farm on a daily basis (grits works pretty well).  Here I am trying to find the perfect little water dish for them and telling the kids not to jostle them too much in their vial.  I&#39;m essentially nurturing the ants!  Ants that had been flown across the country to us (free coupon at least) so that I wouldn&#39;t have to go risk being bitten by finding them at the farm!  Of course, if these die too soon, I&#39;m in trouble. <br/>

This sounds like something I would do too. Today we went to a marine<br/>
taxidermy company for a field trip. Then took the kids to see T3. Later we<br/>
got out our triops and sea monkey kits. Went to the pet store to replace 2<br/>
dead fish and also came home with a ghost shrimp. (just too cute and his<br/>
name is Casper) I set up the tanks for the sea monkeys and triops and the<br/>
kids started on their owl pellets. Joseph did about 20 minutes and as he&#39;s<br/>
not a big animal fan, went to watch something that caught his attention on<br/>
TV. Joe came into the dining room and there Sierra and I are, blowing mole<br/>
fur out of our noses and sorting bones the size of broken toothpicks!!!!!<br/>
Joe said &quot;who ever said grown ups can&#39;t homeschool????&quot; It gave him an idea<br/>

O.K., what are triops and owl pellets and whose noses were you blowing mole fur out of?  Wow.  Is this a creature menagerie from FLA. or from another dimension or have I been too sheltered?  Do tell.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, our new ants were very busy in their &quot;farm &quot; last night and have created all kinds of tunnels.  They remove one grain of sand at a time, bringing it all the way out of the tunnel and then going back for the next one.  Infinite patience.<br/>

Glad your ants are doing well. We may have to try them again if you&#39;re<br/>
having too much fun without us. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Triops are crustaceans that are supposedly from the prehistoric age. They<br/>
kind of look like mini horshoe crabs. You hatch them and keep them very<br/>
similar to the sea monkeys. Of course they are cannibals and you end up with<br/>
only one in the tank. At least we always have. But the one we end up with is<br/>
always quite large and ugly and neat all at the same time. They only live<br/>
about 2-3 months.<br/>
<br/>
Owl pellets we sent away for. Not lucky enough to have somewhere to go to<br/>
gather them ourselves. Owls don&#39;t chew and eat much like a snake. But they<br/>
need to dispose of the bones and all somehow. They cough them up, much like<br/>
a cat with a fur ball. The result is the owl pellet. We get them from a<br/>
company that disinfects them and sends them along with a bone guide.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph possibly had a vole along with mole bones and maybe a rodent too.<br/>
Sierra&#39;s looked like all mole. The pellet is literally all wrapped up in<br/>
fur. Or I guess feathers depending on what the owl ate. Well the fur, once<br/>
you pull it apart is very fine and just gets all over you. Reminded me of<br/>
when I use to groom and had to shave cats. You know that fine fur that just<br/>
seems to get in your nose? You do that whole phoo phoo thing because it<br/>
feels like it&#39;s all your face!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have the website you can send away for the owl pellets and neat other<br/>
stuff too. Let me know if you want it.<br/>

Trevor wanted to save his bones and skulls but I wasn&#39;t sure how. I found <br/>
some cool Riker display cases and specimen boxes at Acorn Naturalists <br/>
(www.acornnaturalists.com)<br/>
though and they also sell the owl pellets. Incredibly fascinating catalog for <br/>
kids who are into this kind of thing.<br/>

Thanks Mary Ellen, that&#39;s exactly the kind of advice I was looking for.  Alex <br/>
is so excited he wanted to put the sand in and get it all ready for the ants <br/>
for when they come, and I said ok, but lets put the water in later, cause we <br/>
don&#39;t want mold or anything in there.  <br/>
<br/>
The little booklet that came with the farm said that sometimes a worker will <br/>
&quot;mysteriously&quot; turn into a queen.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Then I asked myself, why would it be OK for a kid to spend hours observing <br/>
nature, but not me?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
      I found some field guides at the camping store the other day, and was <br/>
oohing and ahing over them,  and Alex said, it&#39;s much more fun to watch <br/>
something than read about it.  Still want the tree one, tho, because I would love to <br/>
recognize more trees in the forest than maple, oak and elm, lol.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97655100">If you don&#39;t want to take on the care and keeping of a bunch of<br/>
ants, there are 2 fun things you can still do.  First put a crumb<br/>
near - maybe a foot - from an ant hill.  Once it is found, put<br/>
another a foot further and so on.  You can get a big hill<br/>
stretched for an amazing distance by putting out new crumbs every<br/>
few minutes.  It really makes the sheer number of ants in the<br/>
hill apparent.<br/>
<br/>
Second, excavating ant tunnels is great fun drawing on the same<br/>
skills as archeologists use not to disturb/disrupt the target.  A<br/>
&quot;summer camp/amateur dig&quot; taught me that a few years ago.  I have<br/>
been amazed at how fascinating it is to perfect digging skills<br/>
this way.  Our 6 has managed to get 8 feet before losing the<br/>
track.  Our daughter in law, who is the long term ant lover,<br/>
can&#39;t get quite that far yet.</div>
