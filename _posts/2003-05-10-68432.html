  I am going to buy this book. I read the first couple of chapters just now. I have so much to think about. <br/>
<br/>
  I was watching my boys the other day. They were outside sword fighting again (Mark cut a broom handle in half and the halves make great swords). They are outside doing this all the time and I noticed that they practice their moves and discuss which move they are going to make. It&#39;s serious play! I thought about the different famous brothers, the Wright&#39;s and the Cohen&#39;s, the Wachowski&#39;s and I realized I was doing the absolute right thing for my boys in letting them be free to dream and play together. Who knows what they are capable of?<br/>
<br/>
  I have to plagarize Mary here and say....<br/>
  Life is good.<br/>

Anyone see her on PBS ( I&#39;m in Chicago)  last nite?  <br/>
<br/>
I listened for a while, I like her ;-)  It was her &quot;you can change your life <br/>
after 40&quot; spiel.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pledge time, so they were offering her books and videos. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still reading WishCraft that I dl&#39;d on Adobe.  I can&#39;t get past the first <br/>
chapter.  I cannot for the life of me remember what I was excited by when I <br/>
was little.  That is so sad to me.  ;-(   <br/>

Don&#39;t feel bad,  I&#39;m also reading it and I can&#39;t remember either,  and yes, it makes me sad also.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping if I keep reading there will be some other suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
This is probably why I&#39;m a bit over the edge on letting my kids pursue their passions.  I&#39;ll be darned if they are going to feel this way as an adult!!<br/>
<br/>
I know there are certain things that I love when I do get to do them, so that&#39;s a start,    I hope anyway.<br/>

What a great book though,   thanks Kathryn!<br/>

nite about what she said to a woman who said she liked to draw, but that she <br/>
didn&#39;t have the time.  She said to the woman, here&#39;s paper and a pencil, draw <br/>
my shoe, you have three minutes! lol  I loved that, because, it&#39;s a great <br/>
version of just do it. Practical, funny, and true.  <br/>

<br/>
One of the best dreams I ever had, and it was long and realistic (meaning <br/>
kinda mundane, real-time, not flashy and weird) was that I was the #4 Cartwright <br/>
child, a girl my age (12ish I think?) and had a smaller paint pony like Little <br/>
Joe MY BROTHER had, and he was helping me with a new bridle or something, in <br/>
the corral (exactly what&#39;s on the set) out front of the house.  Very routine <br/>
day, but I WAS THERE and always had been and always was going to be.  No other <br/>
details.  Hoss came by and talked to us, not about anything important just how <br/>
it was going and he was going to go in the house.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of kid memories.  <br/>

The only thing I could think of, and my mom confirmed that it was an interest of mine and couldn&#39;t think of others, was playing figures - like little people.  <br/>
<br/>
The sad thing about this is that Davan loves to do imginative play with figures.  I can&#39;t handle doing it for more than about a half hour and then I just feel my mind go to mush.<br/>
<br/>
So, what does that leave me to move on with from the whole what I enjoyed when I was little?  I can&#39;t figure it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061005901">This is such a huge issue for me.  I do NOT have a good relationship <br/>
with my parents.  I look back and see a very lonely childhood.  When <br/>
I was really young I remember taking 1-2 classes but there was never <br/>
any support or interest and then nothing.  I remember asking to join <br/>
the girl scouts when I was in second grade and my parent said no.  <br/>
So, personally I feel like there are so many things I was never <br/>
allowed to explore.  For example, My father had hoped he would get a <br/>
singer in the family.  Unfortunately, neither me nor my sister showed <br/>
promise by preschool age and so my father refused to teach us to sing <br/>
or have us learn any musical instruments.  He gave us such a Damn <br/>
complex that I refuse to sing out loud to this day.  LOL...I always <br/>
lip sync to songs &lt;g&gt;!  Realistically, I don&#39;t think we are that <br/>
horrible and certainly could have learned to carry a tune if he had <br/>
taken the time.  My sister was a great artist and my parents never <br/>
gave her the support to do something with it.  Her life is now a <br/>
basic mess with one career problem after another.  I was watching <br/>
Riverdance last night and felt a little sad that there were all these <br/>
amazing things I never got to try, things I may have loved or been <br/>
good at.<br/>
<br/>
Not to say I don&#39;t have interests now, but I lack that feeling of I <br/>
can conquer anything. Although, I am trying to fight that as I <br/>
deschool myself.  I think that is one reason I unschool, so that my <br/>
children get opportunities I never had.  <br/>

someone else&#39;s creativity, and not once, did I really *put myself* in the main <br/>
character&#39;s role.  More like admired from afar.  That in itself points to a <br/>
host of psychological problems.  *sigh*  But I&#39;ll keep thinking on that, thanks. <br/>

children get opportunities I never had.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hey, that&#39;s why most people used to force their children to go to school (and <br/>
some still do).<br/>
<br/>
But I know entirely what you mean, and I agree.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry your dad was a poot about music, Olga.  Do you sing in the shower?  <br/>
Bathrooms have fun acoustics.  Do you have a little electronic keyboard to <br/>
goof around with?  (Heck, you might have a grand piano.)   Just play with it, <br/>
and maybe, when/if you get braver, remember that John Holt learned to play cello <br/>
when he was QUITE grown. &lt;g&gt;    And he wrote about it, in Never Too Late.<br/>

mom always had stuff like paint, and clay, and tons of paper and crayons in the <br/>
house, and big cardboard boxes!!  We would play barbies, little people, cars <br/>
for HOURS outside...usually spend most of the time making their homes in trees <br/>
with pulleys and lifts and treehouses for the figures.  I can remember all the <br/>
kids in the neighborhood being excited (before the days of VCR&#39;s) because it <br/>
was the night &quot;the WIzard of Oz&quot; was going to be on TV.  For a week after <br/>
everytime we&#39;d all get together we&#39;d play wizard of oz.  I remember some older <br/>
boys having a haunted house every year at halloween time, and putting our hands <br/>
in wet spaghetti and being told it was worms, or peeled hardboiled eggs and <br/>
being told they were eyeballs...then all us little kids would go home and make <br/>
our own haunted houses.  So much fun!<br/>

lessons as a child (and hated it), I had always wanted to play violin.  I stuck <br/>
with the piano but quit about a year later.<br/>
<br/>
Well, about 3 years ago I started taking &quot;fiddle&quot; from a lady that teaches <br/>
traditional appalachian folk music.  I had a terrible time as a kid reading <br/>
music, still do, but she does all her teaching as it used to be done, by ear, <br/>
passing songs from one person to another.  I can play pretty darn good now!  Go <br/>
for it!  It&#39;s so much fun to learn an instrument as an adult when your heart is <br/>
all in it, than as a kid who is kinda being MADE to keep going, with a teacher <br/>
you can&#39;t stand, or who doesn&#39;t teach in a way that works well for you.  <br/>

I don&#39;t think John Holt ever read about Gardner&#39;s theories of intellience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Some people truly don&#39;t have that ability to match tones.  Some can&#39;t catch <br/>
