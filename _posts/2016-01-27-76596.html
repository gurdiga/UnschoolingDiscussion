<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385993341">-=- If your family has a roof , food , and more importantly, health that is already more than many people in the world.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And that can be seen in a negative way (this roof is old, that food is boring, we can walk but we can’t afford to go skiing0 <br/>
or in a positive way:  <br/>
this roof doesn’t leak (or hardly leaks; I have a leak in an enclosed porch)<br/>
if we can afford rice and spaghetti, we can do lots of things with those<br/>
no one is in the hospital, we can all function physically<br/>
<br/>
I had a broken leg when I was 32, and a broken ankle when I was 4…8? Marty was 13, and I broke my ankle.<br/>
Those involved hospitals, casts, wheel chairs, crutches, LOTS of inconvenience for me and for everyone around me.<br/>
<br/>
A mental inventory of what IS working, and what IS possible will help much more than money, even.  Beause clearly there are wealthy people who are unhappy.  And there are very poor people who are happy.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn’t work well with fear, so as team captain, a mom with a husband who is in a slump needs to generate enough cheer for the family, to bolster things until life is better.  Or to learn to see the “better” in life as it is.  Both, probably.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college, onr of our housematees one year was from New York City.  Her dad had been a television producer or director and his big-deal last show had been cancelled, or come to the end of a successful run, or whatever.  She had grown up with a maid and a cook and sometimes a driver.  Her dad didn’t pick up more work, and she had gone 2000 miles away to a university—transportation, housing, out-of-state tuition (over twice as much as in-state kids were paying). <br/>
<br/>
One day she got a phone call from her dad, and she sounded distraught, so I thought someone had been hospitalized or died.  She got off the phone and cried.<br/>
When I could ask her whether I could help, she said her dad had taken a job managing some apartments.  I asked whether he was living in them; no.  Did he need to fix things?  No.  Just handle leases and collect the rent, and order repairs.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
At that time, my dad was managing some apartments in Los Alamos, New Mexico.  He was living in one, and doing all the repairs on the others.  Someone else handled rental approvals and money and keys.<br/>
My dad was doing that because after all his very physical jobs—welding, construction, doing machinery set-up and repair for a mining company, repairing engines and machinery—he had developed arthritis and wasn’t able to do the kind of work he had done to support our family and put me in school and pay for my living with this other girl (and some less irritating housemates).<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that what one has is more than what another family has EVER had can be healthy, humbling, grounding.<br/>
<br/>
Marriage vows used to, and seems they should still, include something along the lines of “for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer.”   Impatience or frustration with the fear (and maybe depression and inertia) that can come with a layoff or a downturn or a lesser-paying job might be natural, but it’s possible to make higher and better choices, with practice, for good reasons.   The peace of children and the health of the marriage are good reasons. :-)<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/joy">http://sandradodd.com/joy</a> is one of the first articles I ever wrote about parenting, for a local parenting magazine many years ago.<br/>
It’s called “Rejecting a Pre-Packaged Life,” but I just remember it as “joy” and that’s its URL. :-)<br/>
Pam Laricchia mentioned the article to me yesterday—it’s going to come up in the first of the ten questions she’s asking me tomorrow, so I re-read it tonight in preparation for a podcast interview.<br/>
<br/>
I’ll bring a note here when she uploads the finished podcast. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It’s easy to panic and worry.  Anybody can do that.  <br/>
It’s possible to gradually learn to move toward joy.  Lots of people in this discussion have done that, but some don’t think it’s all that important. Some people don’t think it’s all that bad to remain negative.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that people are here because they want to become, and continue to become better unschoolers, I never stop recommending positivity.<br/>

to your kids at all (in terms of requests that had to go on wishlists, 
etc), and if so, how? I don&#39;t want them to feel burdened by money woes, 
but I don&#39;t know how to be honest about our budget limitations right now
 without projecting that anxiety.=</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style=""><br></span></p><div class="ygrps-yiv-2059227769ygroups-quoted"><br>Last year we lost almost all our savings, and my husband&#39;s income stopped. It has yet to return, though he is working hard to get it going. We moved house twice in one year, landing, finally, and very happily, in my mother-in-law&#39;s garage. We are living off what&#39;s left of our savings. There was no way of hiding the changes in our life from the kids, who are 8, 5 and 3. <br>We live in California, where we have been living with a pretty serious drought for several years. The kids understand conserving water, that the rains aren&#39;t there to replenish the reservoirs, etc. They have been living with the concept of drought most of their lives, and it hasn&#39;t really impacted them negatively, just something going on in the background of their lives.&nbsp; So I told them we were in a money drought, that droughts can last one season, or years, there&#39;s no way of knowing for sure. <br>I made sure to keep our social life going without much change. And we got creative with purchases, like other posters have suggested. We used airline miles to buy Christmas gifts. <br>At first my 8 year old talked of our drought, even told friends about it, very matter-of-factly, which I thought was sweet.There was no shame or sadness associated with it. It doesn&#39;t come up anymore. We adjusted to our new normal, which is still drought mode. <br>For me, this has been a huge learning experience, in many ways, and has made me a better parent and partner, forged by fire. <br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-2059227769ygroups-quoted">&nbsp;</div></div>
