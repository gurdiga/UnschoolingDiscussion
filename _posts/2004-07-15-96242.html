<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094635803">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I think I have lurked long enough to post intro so here goes.  My name is <br/>
Cassie.  Husband, Brian and I live on a little farmette in Kansas.  We have 6 <br/>
kids, 4 boys and twin girls from 11 to 1.  We are new to unschooling really but I <br/>
am loving it already.  Our oldest boy reads and writes pretty much all the <br/>
time and the others are starting to find their own interests.  <br/>
<br/>
I did want to tell ARLEE that I was laughing at her post.  You see, I am a <br/>
Christian and I smoke and have issues as well.  We do limit tv and video games,  <br/>
and are mindful to the music they are listening to and I hide the fact that I <br/>
smoke from not my friends but their kids.  What would be funny is if your <br/>
neighbor is a &quot;closet&quot; smoker as well!  I personally don&#39;t think anything (bad) <br/>
of a smoker, just be yourself!  It isn&#39;t worth the stress.  Tell her you won&#39;t <br/>
smoke around them and I am sure she will appreciate your honesty!  Anyway, I <br/>
just wanted to tell you that I was laughing at your post, it sounds like we <br/>
have things in common, too bad we aren&#39;t close enough to get together!!  <br/>
<br/>
Guess that is enough for now, Cassie<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
 &quot; We do limit tv and video games&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We used to limit until 8 weeks ago, when I found this site. I am still struggling to let <br/>
go! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ya know, if my kids had any other friends, I would probably do just that.  However, <br/>
being new to the state, they don&#39;t yet. I already feel bad that I am setting this bad <br/>
example for my kids and I would be just mortified if through my &quot;yuckie bad habit&quot; <br/>
(that&#39;s what we taught them when they were little) they lost the only friend they have!  <br/>
(And they play so awesomely well together) <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Anyway, I &gt; just wanted to tell you that I was laughing at your post, it sounds like we <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have things in common, too bad we aren&#39;t close enough to get together!! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanx Cassie.  I had a good chuckle at myself too.  We lived in our first house for 11 <br/>
years and coming out here has been quite a rollercoaster ride for me. I can <br/>
remember a time when I used to think, &quot;if I could just move away and start over&quot;!  <br/>
Now I think, &quot;boy how I miss the familiarity of home&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;You see, I am a Christian and I smoke and have issues as well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even though (or maybe, because &lt;g&gt;) I was raised Catholic and went to a Catholic <br/>
school for 7 years, I must say that I question religion itself.  I am the type of person <br/>
who questions the system rather than to just accept it and I have learned of many <br/>
atrocities done in the name of &quot;religion&quot;.  That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t have faith, but just <br/>
that I can&#39;t say that I am Christian or otherwise with conviction.  I have a half sister <br/>
who is Jewish.  My &quot;religion&quot; would tell me that her faith is misguided and she will not <br/>
be accepted into heaven without accepting Jesus as her saviour.  Anyway, that being <br/>
said, if you still think we might have a lot in common, you could email me off list and <br/>
we could chat.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx so much for your encouragement.  I really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Still trying to get it right, <br/>
Arlee</div>
