I just twenty minutes ago received an email from 999central saying they are <br/>
now giving away software for the cost of shipping. They have over a hundred <br/>
titles, but I am so busy, I didn&#39;t have time to do a thorough search to see <br/>
if they had Magic School Bus. Here&#39;s the link to my page and their link (you <br/>
may need to reload your browser if you&#39;ve been there before):<br/>

<br/>
From what I did search, I didn&#39;t see it, but they do have many other great <br/>
titles for just 4.99. There are other companies that offer software at that <br/>
price, though, so maybe someone else can let you know where. Good luck in <br/>
finding it! <br/>
