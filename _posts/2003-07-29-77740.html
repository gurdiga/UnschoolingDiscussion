<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549579966">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Well, I finally have a *new* computer and am back on line!  I have soooo much <br/>
to tell everyone, but so much to catch on (I lost EVERYTHING when my power <br/>
supply blew...it took EVERYTHING w/it including the motherboard and hard drive.  <br/>
There was no saving the old one).  Anyway, I do have so much WONDERFUL NEWS <br/>
to share about my daughter & the great things she is doing & what she gets to <br/>
do.  But, I need to do it in another e-mail (hopefully in the morning) as I&#39;m <br/>
really tired.  BUT, I promise to share w/all, as this mom just can&#39;t keep it in <br/>
anymore!<br/>
<br/>
Take Care, & can&#39;t wait to chat w/you all soon!<br/>
<br/>
