&lt;&lt; It&#39;s been a long long time since I let a stranger hurt my feelings with a <br/>
response on an email list. :::sigh::: Time to go no mail and deal with the <br/>
stress. &quot;See&quot; you all later. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now the person who made Deborah Cunefare grouchy enough to leave this list <br/>
has done a very bad thing, because Deborah has YEARS and years of good <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
SO... <br/>
<br/>
**She goes. Why would being unschooled all her life be a problem?**<br/>
**I never said it was a problem! That&#39;s YOUR interpretation. <br/>
<br/>
The person who  was tacky in that way will have LESS good input now, and so <br/>
will everyone else who comes here for a while.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a damned shame.<br/>
<br/>
You can pay for someone to help you with unschooling.<br/>
here are two places you can do so:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/consult.htm">http://www.holtgws.com/consult.htm</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.org/home/">http://www.naturalchild.org/home/</a>  (click &quot;counseling&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
OR you can politely and courteously accept the abundant and speedy FREE <br/>
advice you can get here.<br/>
<br/>
You also certainly have the option to be tacky and offend people who <br/>
volunteer to help you, but that&#39;s not your best choice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess what I don&#39;t understand here is why people have to be rude to others <br/>
trying to help.  If you don&#39;t agree fine great but no need to get rude.  I <br/>
have gotten some wonderful information on this list and some that I chose not <br/>
to use, it is my choice, but I hope I have never come across as rude to any <br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>
Take what you will and leave what you don&#39;t but always be polite.  You can <br/>
state you thoughts without hurting others.<br/>
