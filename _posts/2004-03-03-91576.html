<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043842607">Here&#39;s a tooth brushing trick, and a two-for-one for little kids.  I was <br/>
reminded of it just last week when Holly was talking about her teeth and started <br/>
off saying, &quot;I brushed my teeth for a month and...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I brushed the kids&#39; teeth when they were little, I would sing to the <br/>
tune of Yankee Doodle:<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, Monday Tuesday, Wednesday,<br/>
Thursday, Friday, SAaaaturday...<br/>
<br/>
And the days of the week fit perfectly into that tune four times--a month.<br/>
<br/>
So before they were old enough to know or care what day it was, they had a <br/>
song that was days of the week and the basic length of a month.  <br/>
<br/>
And I would tell them when they had more teeth they would have to brush MORE <br/>
than a month, and I would  hum while I brushed mine and it would take at least <br/>
two months. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;m really skeptical about the true value of the whole <br/>
toothbrushing package, the three times a day, floss, etc.   Not saying it&#39;s never good, <br/>
but I&#39;m absolutely suspicious that it&#39;s part of the problem itself.  Douching <br/>
every day is/was/has been a problem.  Some women got the &quot;cleanliness&quot; thing to <br/>
the point (years ago) that they would douche with vinegar LOTS.  Tons.  And <br/>
there are things supposed to be inside us.  We&#39;re not SUPPOSED to be <br/>
anti-bioticized.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly brushed with baking soda and salt.  She had before, but not <br/>
for a long time.  She was just skipping around saying &quot;That felt so good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, maybe, just mix it up and don&#39;t have the same routine, same <br/>
toothpaste, same place, same time.  And same toothbrush?  For how long?  People who <br/>
won&#39;t drink out of the same cup they used the day before without washing it will <br/>
use the same toothbrush for a year.<br/>
