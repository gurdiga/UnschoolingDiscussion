<div id="ygrps-yiv-737805147">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Recently I shared Laurie Chancey&#39;s website and writings with my son,<br/>
Zach 14.  He told me <br/>
he&#39;d like to read more essays like hers.  Essays written by unschoolers<br/>
about their life, being <br/>
unschooled, going to college or life after college.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone direct me towards any of these?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
