&gt; Insight on this?&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mary, I am new to fully unschooling, but I think the amount of time spent with<br/>
&gt; other children/families depends on each person&#39;s needs/wants.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The people who say that children need to &quot;be around others their age&quot; are<br/>
those who are pushing school. Even so, the children in schools spend almost<br/>
their entire day NOT interacting with their peers, but instead being made to<br/>
sit still and shut up and listen mostly to unwanted information doled out by<br/>
strangers with mediocre education, suspicious incentives and often unhealthy<br/>
attitudes -- operating under repressive rules.<br/>
<br/>
You are hurting your kids if you put them in those places. Almost anything<br/>
is a better experience than that. &quot;Being around other children&quot; is not what<br/>
school is for anyway, even though they use &quot;socialization&quot;  when all else<br/>
fails and we know the children are not happy or learning there.<br/>
<br/>
A child needs friends (at least one), not a room full of anxious same-age<br/>
&quot;others&quot; under artificial circumstances doing busywork isolated from all<br/>
other human life. In order to find a friend, interaction is required. Summer<br/>
is a good time for making new friends. So find ways to help them.  I gather<br/>
that there are no children living nearby, so it&#39;s summer camp for a week;<br/>
swimming lessons; baseball, hiking clubs, 4H, etc. Many towns have<br/>
recreation directors who run programs for kids all day, every day. Subscribe<br/>
to the homeschooler newsletters and find out what other parents are doing.<br/>
It&#39;s getting so big that people can&#39;t keep up with it all, there are so many<br/>
activities and day trips.<br/>
<br/>
Children find their own level of comfort. Ask them, and listen.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a start.<br/>

<br/>
Your being new to unschooling takes time to fully realize how much you are<br/>
now responsible for. I often ask in my programs, &quot;Did you have children so<br/>
that you can give your kids to the government to raise for you - badly?&quot;</div>
