<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569321569">That&#39;s a nice article.  I was uncomfortable about the praying for God to change him.  It&#39;s better that he changed himself, and he did.   I like the method, though, and the results, and it&#39;s good writing.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Keith and I have been married for 31 years, and it&#39;s the 31st. :-)  <br/>
(Kirby pointed out the 31 part; I wouldn&#39;t have thought of it.)<br/>
<br/>
This weekend, our oldest, Kirby, moved back home.  He&#39;s 28. He&#39;s brought his partner and her six-year-old daughter.  They plan to be here for many months, maybe a year or years. :-)  It&#39;s interesting for it to be so open-ended.   But the &quot;what can I do to make your day better?&quot; method can work with situations other than just marriage.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the idea of partnership with a child should include that thought, too, even if the children are little.<br/>
