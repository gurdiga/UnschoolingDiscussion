<div id="ygrps-yiv-242888002">My almost 10 yo dd just got glasses which she wears when she needs them mostly for reading and computer work. The optometrist had her sit and copy a few sentences. He commented on her posture--(cheek resting fist, not sitting centered on paper,) and on the way she holds her pencil (not using the &quot;ok&quot; hold). He is a developmental optometrist and uses exercises to work eye muscles. There was a lot I liked about him, but the pencil holding thing was irritating. Does anyone know if there truly is a correlation between pencil holding, posture, and vision?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-660954290">I think Dorothy and Raymond Moore&#39;s homeschool books dealt with this issue <br/>
years ago in one of their books.  I don&#39;t think there is much correlation, <br/>
though if you hold the pencil wrong you might get tired faster, thus have a <br/>
hard time writing.  Laying you head on your cheek would mean you were <br/>
looking at the page wrong but I think you brain makes adjustments for that.<br/>
<br/>
But this is just opinion.  I think the Optometrist may be well meaning but <br/>
uninformed.<br/>

  Hi, I am no expert but my oldest (17) holds her pencil in the &quot;incorrect&quot; way <br/>
  and as for posture we never worried about it, however she sat (or lay). No <br/>
  vision problems here. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889927836">My 6yo daughter also is holding her pencil &quot;wrong&quot; and when she writes the<br/>
letter O, she writes the letter &quot;incorrectly&quot;, not starting at the proper<br/>
place. This bothered me, for a bit, thinking that if she held her pencil<br/>
wrong she would have problems later, then if she wrote her O incorrectly she<br/>
would have problems with writing further down the road. Then I thought about<br/>
the poor writing of so many doctors, lawyers, etc. and also the way my<br/>
mother holds her pencil which is COMPLETELY bizarre, and she gets<br/>
COMPLIMENTS constantly on her writing which is very different and beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about it anymore and I know that with anything they possibly<br/>
can, my children take the most comfortable route so I&#39;m sure that what my<br/>
daughter is doing must be comfortable to her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587486422">When I worked in rehab they used lots of &quot;correct&quot; methods for different<br/>
stuff because it works with training brain patterns.  As to posture, it<br/>
effects breathing which effects how much oxygen gets to the brain and muscle<br/>
tissue, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So, to make it short and sweet, yes, posture can effect many things.<br/>

  I do know I hold a pencil wrong, sat up straight at reading the word <br/>
posture and wear glasses for very weak vision (past 3&quot; and things start <br/>
blurring.  I also hold scissors wrong.  i once asked my son&#39;s occupational <br/>
therapist if these were problems.  she said if people can read my writing <br/>
and i can cut there are no problems.  my dh writes from the bottom up and is <br/>
ambidexterous, he is good at math and lousy at spelling (i doubt there is a <br/>
correlation).<br/>

to the paper so that they can see it better.<br/>
