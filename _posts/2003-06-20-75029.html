plan. We did a huge Holy Union at our church many moons ago, then went to VT <br/>
and did it there...We&#39;ll have to go to Canada next.<br/>
<br/>
The US has policies which automatically approve marriages that have taken <br/>
place in other nations, as do most other countries. There&#39;s already a movement to <br/>
change that here. Sucks big time.<br/>
<br/>
Oh...a plug: if there are any gay, lesbian, bi, transexual, transgender <br/>
homeschoolers here, or if you have or suspect you have a gay child you are <br/>
homeschooling, or you are just interested: Think about joining my list <br/>
Gayhomeschoolers. It&#39;s a yahoogroup. We&#39;ve got over 60 members, and there&#39;s not tons of <br/>
traffic, but it&#39;s cool. We just had a neat woman join because her 12 year old <br/>
daughter came out and they decided school was a bad place for her, so they&#39;re <br/>
homeschooling. (Not unschooling, though)<br/>

<br/>
Julian, at 13, is starting to really get what it means that Beth and I can&#39;t <br/>
be legally married. Really pisses him off too.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will have to change Kathryn.   Banning same sex marriages violates the<br/>
&gt; laws against sexual discrimination.  <br/>
&gt; Not only that but the reasons they are using to keep same sex marriages<br/>
&gt; illegal have religious foundations and that seems to violate separation<br/>
&gt; of church and state. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry our government openly discriminates against you and Beth.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not right and it shouldn&#39;t be tolerated by anyone who believes in our<br/>
&gt; constitution.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to say that it means a lot to me that I can be upfront and open <br/>
about my family&#39;s life here, and get such support. Sometimes it&#39;s pretty <br/>
lonely in the Homeschooling world...t&#39;ain&#39;t many of us queer folks out there, and <br/>
certainly not many unschoolers.<br/>
