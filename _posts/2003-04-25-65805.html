 I&#39;m crippled!  But at least I&#39;m a hyperactive crippled unschooling <br/>
 missionary. LOL! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh gosh. First we have the church of the Holties (praise Dodd/Doddess!) and <br/>
now missionaries?  And is there a baptism ritual? <br/>
Let&#39;s see, we could make people join the &quot;full plate club&quot;, then affirm their <br/>
faith in unschooling by converting at least two other families and attend at <br/>
least one conference.<br/>
<br/>
Next we&#39;ll have pilgrimages to the Holy Land of Columbia SC. People will be <br/>
baffled by all the Holties touching a wet, outdoor carpet covered ramp at the <br/>
Clarion. <br/>
snark, snark<br/>

&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>
