&lt;&lt;  I think it makes much more sense towards a<br/>
 person&#39;s emotional health to teach them that it is OK to not do something<br/>
 anymore if it is not good for them, or they do not enjoy it.  There are so<br/>
 many people in this world who do not give themselves permission to stop<br/>
 doing things that are causing problems in their life.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a sil who is a professional hair dresser two days a week (for several <br/>
years now) and works as a checker in a grocery store the other four days.<br/>
She despises the grocery store, the customers are rude, the management is<br/>
ruder.  I keep saying quit, but she doesn&#39;t or can&#39;t and I can&#39;t figure it <br/>
out.<br/>
She is single, and can afford to try something different or just do hair<br/>
a few more days a week.  I just don&#39;t get how someone could be so <br/>
paralyzed like that to stay in a job situation that makes you so miserable.<br/>
I think maybe she thinks its her security, after X number of years get<br/>
retirement (been there for 12, only 13 more years to go!) plus health<br/>
benefits.  Just think that the world is wide open for different opportunities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348101388">I related to this topic well.  I tend to be a person who tries out many <br/>
things and jumps back and forth from interest to interest.  Some of these <br/>
stay with me for life and others just don&#39;t turn out to be a good fit.<br/>
     My 15 yr old son and I are taking a Physical Geology class with Lab this <br/>
semester (his first college class and my first in over ten years).  I am so <br/>
glad I am in it with him because the instructor is unbelievably difficult.  <br/>
He insults students regularly, including us, and seems irritated when we <br/>
actually try to learn the subject rather than just copy down the answers he <br/>
posts as the Lab progresses.  He&#39;s like a really bad high school teacher and <br/>
a great reminder of why I would never put my kids in public school again.  <br/>
Before this class, I had a very positive view of college teachers and <br/>
classes.  I had 59 units of general ed. and had actually loved every class I <br/>
had taken.  I had told Justin how great college is, how the teachers treat <br/>
you with more respect and aren&#39;t so discipline oriented and then we get this <br/>
guy.  We have chosen to finish out because we only have a month and a half <br/>
left for our credits but at least we both knew we could drop if we chose to.  <br/>
