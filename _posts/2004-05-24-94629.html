<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379098733">&quot;Keeping things nice will increase stress in yourself and your family. (How<br/>
much will depend on the personalities of the family members and how much you<br/>
enjoy maintenance.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told my very neat and tidy dh about this conversation today...his response was &quot;It basically comes down to this: you can have a nice house, or nice kids. One or the other, but not both&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought that was pretty good for a neat freak that has learned to adapt.:)<br/>

peace.  Peace is the way.&quot; <br/>
