It would be life affirming.<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t other families post their school schedules and good report cards and  <br/>
certificates?  <br/>
They  might have an honor roll student and a bumper sticker to prove  it, but <br/>
there&#39;s nothing unique about being an honor roll student.  There  are <br/>
millions of them, all look the same, like this:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747705190">Gee, that puts it in a different light - I was thinking more &quot;sneaky&quot; <br/>
than I needed to, I guess. Generally we do have DS&#39; artwork and stuff <br/>
up on the fridge anyhow - or more likely on the fishing line strung <br/>
across one wall of the kitchen so we can add and move stuff around by <br/>
simply attaching a paperclip to the piece and sliding it onto the <br/>
line - no pins or tape or whatever on the wall (well just what is <br/>
necessary to secure the fishing line in the first place) and stuff <br/>
doesn&#39;t slide around and fall off every time the freezer gets opened.</div>

This reminded me of a bumper sticker I saw last week.  It read, I love my kids whether or not they&#39;re on the honor roll.  It was a nice change from all the &#39;my child is on the honor roll at....&#39; stickers that seem to be everywhere.  I have to wonder how special the honor roll is when it seems like every mini-van in the parking lot at Wal-mart has that sticker?<br/>
