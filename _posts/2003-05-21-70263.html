<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369245107">I thought some may be interested in this one.<br/>
 It&#39;s not SC but might do for those that cannot make it to SC. <br/>
There looks to be some unschooling speaker/s coming.<br/>
This the on in Boxborough, MA &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fine-hotels.com/main.cfm?action=locate&id=location3&quot;">http://www.fine-hotels.com/main.cfm?action=locate&id=location3&quot;</a>&gt;Boxborough Woods Holiday Inn&lt;/A&gt;<br/>

<br/>
below a site for some info:<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Workshop topics<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have now been listed for most main speakers.  I&#39;m particularly happy<br/>
to announce that Nicky Hardenbergh, former NHEN board member, will<br/>
be presenting  a session on the history of compulsory education and how<br/>
it has impacted education (as well as homeschooling) in this country. Relaxed<br/>
and eclectic homeschoolers will learn much from &#39;homeschool guru&#39; (and<br/>
author of many books) Mary Hood, and unschoolers/child-led proponents will<br/>
enjoy unschooling spokesperson and author Alison McKee. By popular request,<br/>
Shirley Minster will be presenting her full two-session workshop on learning <br/>
styles - you&#39;ll<br/>
know all about yours and your children&#39;s by the end of this one!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone loves performer and storyteller Jim Weiss and one of Maine&#39;s<br/>
favorites, Ron St. Saviour - a long-time friend of homeschoolers who has<br/>
tailored his outdoor education programs to fit their needs.<br/>
<br/>
There are workshops on gifted education, parenting, much needed &quot;how-tos&quot; ,<br/>
meetings for leaders/organizers and  much more.<br/>
