                                      More Thoughts <br/>
                Jeanne Musfeldt <br/>
<br/>
                Hello again! I thought I would just take<br/>
                some time today to let you know more<br/>
                about our unschooling. The things we do<br/>
                and how the children learn. But first, let<br/>
                me elaborate on the general idea of<br/>
                unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
                Unschooling can mean something different to each and every<br/>
                person. There is no one universal definition. For our<br/>
family, it means<br/>
                that the children are permitted to learn what they want,<br/>
when they<br/>
                want, how they want. Of course, there are exceptions to<br/>
this. If<br/>
                Evan, who will be 10, would want to study flight by pushing<br/>
his<br/>
                sister off the garage, that would be denied. But if Brenna,<br/>
who is a<br/>
                6-year-old, wanted to learn about fractions today by making<br/>
some<br/>
                cookies, that would be fine. And if Evan didn�t want to<br/>
learn then,<br/>
                that would be ok too. If Cora, who is 8, wanted to do some<br/>
Krampf<br/>
                science experiments at 10:30 at night, that would not be<br/>
ok. But it<br/>
                would be fine for her to do them during the daytime.<br/>
<br/>
                Do you see what I mean? We do have some rules here, but we<br/>
still<br/>
                let the children learn, as they feel led. I know that there<br/>
are some<br/>
                radical unschoolers out there that would allow their<br/>
children to do<br/>
                things that are not permitted here. Our children have<br/>
chores and<br/>
                responsibilities they need to tend to each day, and breathing<br/>
                doesn�t count as one of them.<br/>
<br/>
                Unschooling means learning about history by going to the<br/>
                museums, by asking Grandpa about his childhood, by watching<br/>
                videos like Gone with the Wind. But not by forcing the<br/>
child to sit<br/>
                and do a chapter out of the history book and answer the twenty<br/>
                questions in the back.<br/>
<br/>
                Let�s compare unschooling to cooking. Let�s say you have been<br/>
                cooking everything for the children for a long time.<br/>
Suddenly, you<br/>
                want the children to cook (unschool) for themselves. They<br/>
won&#39;t do<br/>
                it, and you don&#39;t understand how they can eat peanut butter<br/>
and<br/>
                jelly for six weeks straight! (Play Nintendo and read comic<br/>
books.)<br/>
                After a while, they figure out that you are not going to<br/>
cook (teach<br/>
                them with curriculum) and they start cooking (learning) on<br/>
their own.<br/>
<br/>
                Soon, they are making gourmet meals, things you never thought<br/>
                they would! (Doing all kinds of educational things.) They<br/>
won&#39;t even<br/>
                be thinking of it as learning. It will be something they<br/>
want to do on<br/>
                their own. They will be on fire to learn more, and to share<br/>
the things<br/>
                they are learning with others. In the meantime, the<br/>
children did not<br/>
                starve, nor did they stop learning. They just needed to<br/>
find that<br/>
                something that they wanted to cook, or learn about. And<br/>
given the<br/>
                time and space, they will find that something. Now, let�s<br/>
get on to<br/>
                some hands on examples of our learning. Math at our house<br/>
is best<br/>
                done with board games: Monopoly, Rummikub, Uno, Chess, and<br/>
                various card games. Of course, there is a lot to learn<br/>
about in<br/>
                comparative shopping. And what child do you know that isn�t<br/>
going<br/>
                to become vocal over getting fewer cookies than the other<br/>
children<br/>
                do?<br/>
<br/>
                How about Language Arts? Well, reading naturally, is done with<br/>
                reading. Whether the child is reading Shakespeare or the<br/>
latest TV<br/>
                Guide, the reading skills are still being used. Writing a<br/>
letter or an<br/>
<br/>
                email to anyone, be it a pen pal or Grandma, is grammar and<br/>
                spelling. Scrabble is a great game for spelling practice, too!<br/>
<br/>
                For Science, we often do experiments at home. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Krampf@...">Krampf@...</a> <br/>
                emails out free ones every Monday morning. Drop him a line and<br/>
                ask to be added to the list. There are some really great<br/>
shows on<br/>
                PBS for science, too.<br/>
<br/>
                Social Studies are the easiest subject to cover for our<br/>
family. We all<br/>
                love those museums! We also read a lot of biographies. Which<br/>
                biography we read depends upon our interests at the time.<br/>
It could<br/>
                be Christopher Columbus one week and John F. Kennedy the next.<br/>
                I never know where the children are going to lead us next.<br/>
<br/>
                We do a lot of history learning with videos, too. Gone with<br/>
the Wind,<br/>
                Titanic, Roots, all of those are wonderful. But, watch<br/>
those with<br/>
                more than a grain of salt, as I am sure you realize.<br/>
Hollywood likes<br/>
                to embellish more than a little sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
                In the upcoming issues, I will be taking the individual<br/>
subjects and<br/>
                showing you in a deeper way how they play a part in our<br/>
every day<br/>
                lives.<br/>
<br/>
                The most difficult thing about unschooling is that YOU, the<br/>
mom<br/>
                and dad, must unlearn all that school stuff. Forget what is<br/>
                appropriate for a 3rd grader. Who cares if the 7th grader<br/>
is reading<br/>
                Good Night Moon? So what if the Kindergartner wants to work on<br/>
                dividing fractions? Just relax and let them do the<br/>
learning. They will,<br/>
                given the time and the room to do so.<br/>
<br/>
                 For unschooling to work, it is a matter of the parents<br/>
learning to<br/>
                trust the children with their own education. I know that is<br/>
a hard<br/>
                thing to do, but stop and ponder it for just a few minutes.<br/>
There is<br/>
                no proof for you to see that the children will learn<br/>
without you there,<br/>
                guiding them, and directing them. But, if you do take this<br/>
step, our<br/>
                family has found you will see results very soon.<br/>
<br/>
                When you became a Christian, it was the same way. You had no<br/>
                �proof�, yet you took that step of faith, and now look at<br/>
all the<br/>
                wonders in your life! Unschooling is just trusting God one<br/>
more<br/>
                time.<br/>
