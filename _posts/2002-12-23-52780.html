<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husband, who got teenagers before he got a baby, put it something like<br/>
&gt; this.  Parents only have a short time of control, but the opportunity to have<br/>
&gt; influence forever.  At some point, you have to give up control, because<br/>
&gt; through insisting on control, you eventually lose your influence, as well.<br/>
