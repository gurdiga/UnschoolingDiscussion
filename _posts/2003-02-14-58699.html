<br/>
&gt; The one that I enjoy, is taking someones post completely out of its<br/>

&gt; Another, is the &quot;I don&#39;t understand what you are saying game?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or the biggie, game of  YOU USED A WORD WE DON&#39;T APPROVE OF.<br/>
&gt;  Since when does someone dictate what words used in order<br/>
&gt; to convey ones thoughts Because Sandra sets the standards?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would think twice if I was following someone who set my standards.<br/>

umpty-gajillionth time) in the last month and I&#39;m lacking my usual patience<br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
The list is what it is and it isn&#39;t going to change because it does what it<br/>
does very well. Though some people find support here, it&#39;s not intended to<br/>
be a support list. It is a discussion list. We tear apart ideas to examine<br/>
their foundations.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to trust and respect their children, then this is a great<br/>
place to examine the entrenched ideas that society has filled us with.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t want to examine the ideas they hold, doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
examine the practices they have, then they&#39;re going to find this list a very<br/>
uncomfortable place to be.<br/>

enough numbers to start your own list, where you can give and get advice<br/>

[Unschooling-dotcom] fw:That&#39;s enough/<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;fw:&quot; indicates that these were responses to e-mails forwarded to you <br/>
specifically.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yep, it must be nice in Doddville!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, usually it really is.   We&#39;ve worked consciously to make it that way, <br/>
and have learned a lot of good things over the time Keith and I have had <br/>
kids, and had other unschooling and homeschooling families over.  And I&#39;ve <br/>
spent a lot of energy over ten+ years helping other people get to that point, <br/>
and a lot of people have gotten there, partly from online discussions <br/>
involving me and lots of other moms, from reading the books that keep being <br/>
recommended here, and from changing their lives for the sake of their kids, <br/>
from listening to their kids and BEING with their kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more than just &quot;being with their kids.&quot;  It&#39;s stopping and feeling their <br/>
*being* and synching that being with their children&#39;s *being* so that they <br/>
aren&#39;t just &quot;being in the same house,&quot; they are living connected lives.<br/>
<br/>
The issue of your comment about my education and your expectations I&#39;ll <br/>
address separately.<br/>
<br/>
But I want to mention &quot;projection.&quot;  It&#39;s a concept worth knowing.<br/>
<br/>
Teresa apparently called for backup, forwarded you the e-mails she wanted you <br/>
to respond to, and you responded hard and harshly in her favor, insulting <br/>
people who had defended me.<br/>
<br/>
What you have accused others of was exactly what you were doing.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s documentable at this point. <br/>
<br/>
So while you were making a public statement that I knew zip about special <br/>
needs and should shush up, while you were helping disrupt this list and <br/>
belitting people, I was working on getting some special needs articles online <br/>
where people could get to them easily.<br/>
<br/>
You can help other people unschool, or you can be neutral, or you can hinder <br/>
them getting help.<br/>
<br/>
I personally wish you had made better choices in that area yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Those articles are here, in case those e-mails weren&#39;t forwarded to you:<br/>

I counted two.<br/>
<br/>
But surely there are dozens of others e-mailing them supportively.   <br/>
(Now that was sarcasm, I admit it freely.  Joyce will probably slap my <br/>
cyber-hands.)<br/>
<br/>
Someone can probably direct them to the groups that split off a year or so <br/>
ago, if they&#39;re still operating.<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, there are other unschooling information sources, and some <br/>
PLENTY wimpy to allow anyone to claim unschooling.<br/>

The assumption that you, Teresa, did the forwarding might have been incorrect.<br/>

The fact that the responses were to forwarded messages was shown by the <br/>

Didn&#39;t you say it was your kids who are explosive and have anger <br/>
control problems?<br/>
This is just an email list - you can ignore what you don&#39;t like. Try <br/>
taking some deep breaths and remembering that nobody here has any <br/>
authority over you. If you really hate what they say, maybe you can <br/>
print out their posts and flush them down the toilet - that might make <br/>
you feel a little calmer.<br/>
