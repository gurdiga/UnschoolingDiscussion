<div id="ygrps-yiv-188878720">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Riley wants to know about stories where the &quot;bad guy&quot; wins. I know for him he is working something out here about himself. That part which is destructive,&quot;evil&quot;, unacceptable in our society. Any wisdom?<br/>
<br/>
I have enjoyed all the opinions about strewing.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite methods of strewing stuff is to clean out a spot. I have dumped entire boxes out to organize and everything is touched again in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
My kids naturally share things I would like as I share with them things I think they like. Riley was being read to at a friend&#39;s house the book Bud, Not Buddy. He told me we needed to get it. I brought it up the other day with him that we needed to remember that book to get and read and he said he didn&#39;t care for the story but he knew I would like it because it was about orphans and set in the past. My guy will be 8 next Tuesday and he is aware of me as I am him and unschooling had been the most wonderful experience with children and I have years more of this.<br/>

  Hi,<br/>
<br/>
  Riley wants to know about stories where the &quot;bad guy&quot; wins. I know for him he is working something out here about himself. That part which is destructive,&quot;evil&quot;, unacceptable in our society. Any wisdom?<br/>

  I found a list at Amazon.  I&#39;ve not seen all the movies, but the ones I have are way too disturbing for a child of 8 to see.  Most of the time when the bad guy wins, it&#39;s because society doesn&#39;t know he&#39;s bad, or he does his bad guy stuff covertly.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s something you want to tell a child either.  <br/>
<br/>
  Star Wars Episode I was on the list.  I don&#39;t remember how that ends, but you might want to check that one out.<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s the list: <br/>

<br/>
  It might spark some ideas for you.<br/>

<br/>
Fun book!  I need to pull it out and put it in the bathroom, maybe.  Marty used to love it and he&#39;s probably not thought about it for years. Holly might not remember it.   Too many books...<br/>

the Wolf&#39;s perspective.  Amusing:<br/>

The first book my husband brought into the house after finding out we<br/>
were expecting was &quot;The Stinky Cheese Man&quot; :-)  Happily, the children<br/>
appreciate it, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481935974">What about &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events?&quot;  We love those books.  They<br/>
have a dark humor and the good guys get out of one scrape only to get into<br/>
another.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-773983737">Some of my ds6&#39;s favorite comic book heroes deal with the not-so-perfect good guy vs. the not-so-purely-evil bad guy.  Not sure if that&#39;s exactly what you were looking for, but your post reminded me of the conversations these characters/stories have sparked for us about &quot;good guys,&quot; &quot;bad guys,&quot; and all.  <br/>
<br/>
The Incredible Hulk is the hero character but quite destructive.  The movie may be a bit intense but there are cartoons, books, and comic books geared toward younger kids.  <br/>
<br/>
The two Spiderman movies explore ideas about the choice to be a &quot;good guy&quot; versus to be a &quot;bad guy&quot;.  The dilemnas and choices that the villain has to make parallell those of  Peter Parker/Spiderman throughout the stories, obviously with one ending up the hero and the other the bad guy.  <br/>
<br/>
Not as familiar with X-men, but I think this is true for several of those characters, too -- choosing to do good things vs. harmful things with their powers/questions of what actually is the &quot;good&quot; thing to do versus what actually is the &quot;harmful&quot; choice -- and how that can depend on perspective.  <br/>

out this summer), and the really bad guy Saint Dane does win in some <br/>
of the books. And there are some situations where the main good guy, <br/>
Bobby, *thinks* he is doing the right thing, and it turns out it was <br/>
all part of evil Saint Dane&#39;s plan all along. (The series is about <br/>
time/space travellers called well...Travellers, who&#39;s mission it is <br/>
to save all the Territories before they are destroyed by Saint Dane. <br/>
The protagonist is a teenage boy who struggles with his destiny as a <br/>
Traveller and longs to return home.)We really enjoyed them, and they <br/>
are easy for me to read outloud.<br/>
