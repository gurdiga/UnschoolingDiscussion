&gt; What I&#39;d like to see is a one year after show to see if anyone actually got<br/>
&gt; any benefit from their sessions with good ol&#39; Phil.<br/>

it&#39;s been over 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
I would not volunteer to have my life taken apart on television, by Dr. Phil<br/>
or anyone else. I prefer to have my life taken apart in private &lt;g&gt;. I don&#39;t<br/>
imagine these folks have never seen a talk show before, so on some level<br/>
they&#39;ve GOT to know what&#39;s coming.<br/>
<br/>
And, more importantly, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s harder on TV than he is if you&#39;re<br/>
in a private room with him. I think he&#39;s pretty static in his abrasion, and<br/>
some people don&#39;t mind a good scrubbing if it leaves them thinking cleaner<br/>
at the end.<br/>
<br/>
These are adults freely choosing to enter that environment, knowing on most<br/>
if not all levels that it&#39;s going to be hard and public, who are free after<br/>
their session to do or not do what was suggested. These aren&#39;t children, or<br/>
spouses trapped financially in terrible abusive marriages, or employees who<br/>
can&#39;t afford to quit a verbally abusive boss, or mental patients who may be<br/>
stuck where they are for legal or other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t like the heat, they&#39;re free to leave the kitchen. It&#39;s kinda<br/>
like this list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847391234">Hey, guess the guy&#39;s gotta make a dollar.  he&#39;s finally found the very<br/>
public nitch he&#39;s been looking for.  Poor fellow, wonder what he would have<br/>
done if Oprah hadn&#39;t step on the toes of some of the big boys in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Although, I do understand that he isn&#39;t the same in a one-to-one session as<br/>
he is on television.  In fact, I understand that he is more like he was<br/>
before he got all caught up in being a star.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134208326"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This is why I&#39;ve avoided watching him,  I was a little <br/>
&gt; concerned that he might be like that?  Dang!   He is honest,  <br/>
&gt; but I think, again, he doesn&#39;t know-all and isn&#39;t the-end-all <br/>
&gt; on everything!!<br/>
&gt; Now, since he&#39;s on primetime TV,  tons of people will jump to <br/>
&gt; the conclusion that he is right!<br/>
&gt; Can you imagine,  making a child sit there when they are <br/>
&gt; throwing up????   That&#39;s where common sense and compassion is <br/>
&gt; totally absent.  &lt;sad&gt;  He&#39;s totally forcing them into their <br/>
&gt; narrow mind set!  Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kind of like the whole sleep training thing with babies (letting them<br/>
cry it out). On a parenting board I used to visit, they had to split the<br/>
sleep issues board into 2, one for sleep training and one for gently<br/>
parenting them to sleep because too many of us could not believe that<br/>
people would actually advocate letting their babies cry for hours on<br/>
hours (and were very vocal about it). One woman actually said that <br/>
if the baby vomited to clean him up and put him back in the crib to <br/>
cry some more, it was the only way that he would learn. Ugh!<br/>
