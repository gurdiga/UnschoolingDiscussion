<div id="ygrps-yiv-559558104">hi! belated reply to stuff from a month ago or so- thanks to the folks that <br/>
gave positive feedback about me writing here, i&#39;m never sure whether to jump <br/>
in especially in a discussion among parents, which i&#39;m not yet... someone <br/>
asked me what it was like coming to college after unschooling... it was like <br/>
everyone was getting used to an unstructured life while i had to deal with <br/>
more structure, i felt a little backwards of everyone, and there is a matter <br/>
of cultural history that i don&#39;t share to the same degree, when people bond <br/>
about middle or high school experiences, i used to feel left out some, and <br/>
shy about bringing up homeschooling, because while they can banter equally <br/>
about school back and forth, bringing up homeschooling turns the <br/>
conversation over to me answering questions a lot of the time... in a <br/>
receptive group that can be very rewarding though... and it is interesting <br/>
to listen to others&#39; culture, its just as when someone is talking about <br/>
people you don&#39;t know or tv shows you haven&#39;t seen or if someone comes here <br/>
from a different country without knowing the pop icons and such... i can ask <br/>
questions, to stay in the conversation, and learn more about other&#39;s point <br/>
of view.<br/>
academically i came to a school where there are no required courses and you <br/>
do independent work for each of your classes, so you make your own <br/>
curriculum, perfect for me... though i must say i am very bad at sticking to <br/>
deadlines, because i have a &#39;time is in our mind&#39; philosophy that whatever <br/>
doesn&#39;t get done today, can be done tomorrow or the next day... from <br/>
homeschooling, where this is true, it is hard to come to school where things <br/>
are run on a clock and calendar and if you don&#39;t get it done by x date you <br/>
don&#39;t get credit... i show up late for things and get extensions on <br/>
assignments, maybe more my personality but i think homeschooling let me see <br/>
time in an unclocked light and i&#39;ll always prefer it that way.<br/>
its good to keep reading this list, i&#39;ve been stuck in the book that i&#39;m <br/>
trying to write about homeschooling, its hard to write about myself and to <br/>
show how my journey t unschooling was natural and much better for me than <br/>
the huge institution of school- also i got a real mean letter from a teacher <br/>
threatening to take away credit if i don&#39;t write more, i think i want to put <br/>
that in the book, as an example of a school tactic that&#39;s counterproductive- <br/>
he made me too upset to write much at all! :-)<br/>
i am rememering lately the homeschooling ideas that helped me: keeping a log <br/>
of what i actually did in a day, rather than what i planned on doing... felt <br/>
a lot more productive that way... also, remembering to deschool every once <br/>
in a while, is very necessary... this college thing goes on too long, i <br/>
sometimes wish i&#39;d kept unschooling all the way, tho its been great to meet <br/>
teachers and lovers of learning and to get a whole new vocabulary in liberal <br/>
arts college, i wouldn&#39;t trade that.... its expanded my ideas politically <br/>
emotionally spiritually physically, put my energy into a broader context of <br/>
what the world is doing... how i can be of service to the world... <br/>
unschooling was sometimes too me-focused, i needed to learn how to network, <br/>
collaborate, and accept criticism: this is hardest, because for the past 12 <br/>
years i&#39;ve been the authority on my own work...<br/>
ay well i tend to ramble just wanted to say thanks for your feedback and i&#39;m <br/>
still listening... are there any unschoolers on  this list near portland, <br/>
oregon? i may be moving there come summer. i&#39;ve been in ny for far too long. <br/>
;-)<br/>
love and light,<br/>
