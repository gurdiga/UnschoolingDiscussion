<div id="ygrps-yiv-328945246">i dont know how big the chain is, but if you have a Hollywood Video nearby, <br/>
listen to this.  home educators can get a VIT &quot;very important teacher&quot; card <br/>
for free, which then allows us to borrow any video that we will use for <br/>
educational purposes!  FREE!  no charge, nothing, nada.  pretty great <br/>
service, eh?  they have travel videos, documentaries, and of course all the <br/>
regular stuff....<br/>
hope you can enjoy this too!<br/>
