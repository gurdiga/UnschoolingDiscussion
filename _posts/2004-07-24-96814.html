Just in case some of you have been thinking it would be easier if you were a <br/>
lesbian (I get this a lot from straight women LOL).... It&#39;s the same with Beth!<br/>

  So it may well be a partner thing, not a man thing. Might as well stick with the DH then.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Chinese have a theory about partners (if anyone knows terminology or has <br/>
websites, that would be cool) that you both create a whole (in a good <br/>
relationship).  So if one is quite one way, the other needs to be quite the opposite.  <br/>
If both are in the middle, that&#39;s another kind of match.  The symbol for it <br/>
is the yin/yang.   And it explains the phenomenon many of you might have <br/>
noticed that if one partner is fairly androgynous the other probably is too, and if <br/>
one is a total macho football captain, the other might be a totally pink and <br/>
made up cheerleader.   It&#39;s not &quot;opposites attract,&quot; it&#39;s that the two need to <br/>
add up to 100 (if it were done mathematically), 50 female-points, 50 <br/>
male-points (or whatever ends of spectrums you want to put in the equation).<br/>
<br/>
If that rings true, it should probably work out for communications methods <br/>
too, somehow...  thought it seems damnably inconvenient.   But the two of you as <br/>
a team would have the skills to deal with various outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jack Spratt could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean...&quot;<br/>
Perhaps a healthy relationship in terms of that Chinese theory.<br/>

Oh, honey, I sooo know that ain&#39;t so. (It being easier.)  I long ago <br/>
decided that although men are jerks, women are nuts.  Ok, this was during a <br/>
down phase in the dating world, but still.<br/>
<br/>
Having loved and lived with both, I have to say that while different in <br/>
&quot;feel&quot; the same issues remain.  We are all human after all.<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe not that one guy......<br/>

This is a consoling thought, and might explain why my husband and I have <br/>
lasted 21 years, although we are VERY opposite and drive each other crazy at <br/>
times. :o)<br/>
