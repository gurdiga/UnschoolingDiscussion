<div id="ygrps-yiv-336439630">it is very true that the children have no choice in their position as the younger, smaller least powerful members of a family.. but this is the the way it is. It&#39;s not going to change any time soon. and to be a human and a member of a human family is perhaps preferable to the choices of a baby aligator or turtle --(to mention species who do not have the demands of a family... only those of survival)....<br/>
<br/>
 i try to teach my kids a practical approach to life. They are a member of this family and therefore must do the best they can within that framework. <br/>
<br/>
None of us has total freedom in our life choices.  a child, especially a young child, is self centered--in their mind the world revolves around them.. as they SHOULD think, it is instinct. (species survival and all that). So we make many decisions for them and some of us try to give them the benefit of choices that do not affect their survival.  Of course they don&#39;t think this is fair. it is not fair. It is not necessarily meant to be fair. it is meant to be an effective means of surviving until it is their turn to reproduce. <br/>
<br/>
therefore, my children will help me with the chores... <br/>
<br/>
and they will be civil to each other.. and me.. <br/>
<br/>
rudeness is not tolerated (well, not quietly anyway).. and i yell and scream a lot and so do my kids (and we laugh and cry a lot). we are not a perfect family by any means.. nor I an example of parenting perfection.  ..we&#39;re all adequately neurotic.. (and have shrinks for that..)  but we are definitely and interesting bunch (including daughter and grandson.. and eight year old and fourteen year old)<br/>
<br/>
(oh, and yes, my husband has not given me sufficient choices .. so i&#39;m divorcing him... i&#39;m an adult and can do that. ) (thank goodness!!!!  lololll)<br/>

  &gt; it is my nemisis.. and i tend<br/>
  &gt; to order my kids to do it.. --my justification to them for these<br/>
  &gt; demands is that as a member of the family they enjoy the percs of<br/>
  &gt; their situation..i.e. lots of STUFF.. video games, food, shelter,<br/>
  &gt; computers etc.. so as members of the family that provides this for<br/>
  &gt; them they have a responsibility to contribute to said family at<br/>
  &gt; their own level of ability--  as do i and their father.. adn their<br/>
  &gt; older sister when she was living  here. this works very well.. IN<br/>
  &gt; THEORY<br/>
<br/>
  If you look at it from the child&#39;s point of view, or change it around to a<br/>
  new sitaution, it becomes clearer why the children don&#39;t see the<br/>
  reasonableness of this.<br/>
<br/>
  Adults get to choose where to live and pretty much dictate how money gets<br/>
  spent (or at least can veto any purchase). We may think we&#39;re pretty<br/>
  generous about kid choices but if we turn it around it is very controlling.<br/>
<br/>
  Imagine your husband deciding on his own where you would live, which house<br/>
  to buy (to primarily suit his needs but taking into account any needs of<br/>
  yours that he deemed worthy) and how the decor would look. He would listen<br/>
  to your suggestions but they&#39;d only be taken into consideration if they<br/>
  didn&#39;t interfere with his needs. Say he&#39;s a big sports fan (and you&#39;re not)<br/>
  and he decided the house would be a shrine to his favorite team.  If you had<br/>
  a special non-sports related picture he might suggest it could hang on the<br/>
  refrigerator or in a corner of your room so it didn&#39;t interfer with his<br/>
  decorating scheme.<br/>
<br/>
  All meals would conform to his idea of good with maybe a little concession<br/>
  to your tastes (potato chips instead of pretzels). You might get to go to<br/>
  your favorite restaurant once in a while but your order couldn&#39;t be too far<br/>
  off what he thought you should eat and couldn&#39;t be too expensive.<br/>
<br/>
  If you wanted to buy something outside your regular allowance -- like a book<br/>
  or something -- you&#39;d need to convince him that it was worthy of purchase<br/>
  and you&#39;d need to later demonstrate that you were using it enough for it to<br/>
  have been worthy of purchase or you&#39;d hear about it the next time you wanted<br/>
  something.<br/>
<br/>
  If you wanted to go somewhere or get something at the store, it would have o<br/>
  wait until it was convenient for your husband to take you.<br/>
<br/>
  In a way, ending up in a family is not unlike going to school. There&#39;s no<br/>
  choice about being born/going to school (at least not for most kids!) or<br/>
  what family/school you&#39;ll end up with. The adults are supposedly thinking of<br/>
  everything the kids need and supplying them with it and expecting the kids<br/>
  to appreciate it. The kids don&#39;t, of course, because what the adults are<br/>
  really supplying is what the *adults* want the kids to have, not what the<br/>
  kids want.<br/>
<br/>
  We may have decided what we wanted for our kids was a big backyard. Then it<br/>
  seems reasonable since the kids live there and should appreciate it, they<br/>
  should mow it when they&#39;re old enough. But as much as the kids might enjoy<br/>
  the backyard, they didn&#39;t choose it and knowing what they&#39;d need to do to<br/>
  &quot;pay&quot; for it (for the rest of their childhoods) they might have chosen --<br/>
  had they been able to be informed and been allowed the choice -- to buy a<br/>
  house with a miniscule yard next to a park. So why should they appreciate<br/>
  it?<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s sort of like getting showered by nothing but expensive Barbies and<br/>
  parephernalia at every gift giving occasion when you&#39;ve told people that<br/>
  what you really love is dinosaurs. Should you think it&#39;s wonderful and<br/>
  appreciate the &quot;thoughtfulness&quot; of the gift givers? Or are the &quot;gifts&quot;<br/>
  really forms of control?<br/>
<br/>
  But if we act as though our children are partners without demanding that<br/>
  they act as partners then they will be partners because it&#39;s more joy<br/>
  inspiring to be invited with open arms with no strings attached than it is<br/>
  to be required to uphold your membership in something you never asked to<br/>
  join.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326081418">This is a fascinating discussion.  <br/>
<br/>
My personal position is that God created us in such a way so that <br/>
children, being among the weaker, needier members of the human race, <br/>
have parents who will protect and care for them.  <br/>
<br/>
God gave parents a natural love and desire to care for their <br/>
offspring, and he gave offspring the gift of parents so that someone <br/>
who cares for their well being would be their first introduction to <br/>
the human race.  <br/>
<br/>
It is through parents that we are supposed to learn self-confidence <br/>
and healthy ways of dealing with things.  <br/>
<br/>
I have changed a lot in my parenting style.  I used to be a James <br/>
Dobson style parent and now I am at the point where I don&#39;t make my <br/>
kids do anything they don&#39;t want to do.  However, where I draw the <br/>
line is that I don&#39;t let them take advantage of me either.  For <br/>
example, if I am going to keep my house in a somewhat decent order, I <br/>
CAN&#39;T run around cleaning up after them all the time.  I have tried <br/>
and I literally cannot do it all.  So, each person in my family, <br/>
regardless of whether they are a child or an adult, must clean up <br/>
after themselves.  I am there to love and nourish my children, but I <br/>
won&#39;t be their maid for them unless it&#39;s something that they <br/>
physically can&#39;t do for themselves.  So, if they are going to <br/>
bake,they may bake as much as they want but I will not clean up their <br/>
mess.  And I won&#39;t allow them to force me to live in a house that is <br/>
filthy.  They must clean up.  If they don&#39;t clean up, then they can&#39;t <br/>
bake next time.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy for us to allow anyone, <br/>
even our children, to take advantage of us.  <br/>
<br/>
The same thing goes for bedtime.  They have rights, but they have to <br/>
learn to balance those rights by not taking advantage of someone <br/>
else.  It is unsafe for my 3 and 5 year olds to be in a house by <br/>
themselves unsupervised.  Therefore, they may stay up as long as I am <br/>
up.  If I&#39;m up until 3 am and they want to be up with me, that&#39;s <br/>
fine.  However, if I am going to bed at 11 they must go to bed then <br/>
too.  It wouldn&#39;t be safe for them to be up without me.  <br/>

<br/>
Doesn&#39;t this depend on their real abilities, though, and not what the parents <br/>
wish their abilities were?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not very tall. I can get things OFF a high shelf but can&#39;t put them back <br/>
up.  Three people in my family are taller than I am, and if I get something <br/>
down I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to ask one of them, when he comes by, to <br/>
put it back up.  I could get a chair and do it, but it&#39;s easier and safer to <br/>
ask one of them to do it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a kind of tradition in  many families that whoever cooks doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to clean up.  It doesn&#39;t apply in all instances, but I&#39;d rather have one of <br/>
my kids cook and me clean up than to never have them cook at all.<br/>
<br/>
If the whole task is too daunting, it might just keep them from wanting to <br/>
learn to bake.  <br/>
<br/>
And what an eight year old can do in terms of the operation of cleaning <br/>
supplies, etc., is not what a fourteen year old can do.  And the attention <br/>
span of an eight year old might not even make it to the end of the <br/>
peanut-butter-cookie-making project.  She might peter out about after the <br/>
first tray.  So I can finish the other batches and clean up, but she STILL <br/>
actually baked.<br/>
<br/>
I see my kids&#39; happiness and their learning opportunities as a much higher <br/>
priority than my own personal comfort and the cleanliness of the kitchen.  <br/>
<br/>
If the cleanliness of the kitchen were my first priority, they wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
allowed to use it at all.  But learning and joy come first here.<br/>
<br/>
(I think Sheila said the same thing in &quot;unless it&#39;s something that they <br/>
physically can&#39;t do for themselves,&quot; but for the idea-polishing benefit of <br/>
others who are still undecided, I&#39;ve presented the commentary above.)<br/>

<br/>
At what point does it become the parent taking advantage of the child?  It<br/>
seems in many families that the children are considered free labor.  What<br/>
level of *clean* is necessary and how much of that is the child&#39;s<br/>
responsibility?<br/>
<br/>
In our home I claim responsibility for the inside of the house, my husband<br/>
takes care of the cars and most of the yard.  We share the garage and I do<br/>
most of the garden because it was my idea anyway.  However, that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean I end up doing *all* the housecleaning.<br/>
<br/>
I used to require that my son keep his room clean.  He is 9. Well, that<br/>
wasn&#39;t working at all and we always ended up in terrible fights with me<br/>
screaming and him crying.  It was awful and it felt all wrong.  Now, I no<br/>
longer expect him to clean or help with anything.  His room is now his<br/>
domain.  It belongs to him, everything in it belongs solely to him.  His<br/>
belongings, his room are not extensions of my belongings.  Once something is<br/>
given to him, it is his.  I asked him if it was ok for me to enter his room<br/>
and keep it cleaned up.  He said that was fine.  I let him know when I am<br/>
going to clean and I usually ask him if he wants to give me a hand.<br/>
Occasionally he says no but you know what, he pitches in almost every time.<br/>
His room stays pretty clean most of the time now and I am not doing all of<br/>
the work.  Sometimes I go in there and he already has it done for me.  That<br/>
never would have happened before when it was *expected.*<br/>

alone too so we are trying to balance this out with the kids having a choice<br/>
of bedtimes.  The little one usually falls asleep by 9 or 9:30 so she isn&#39;t<br/>
an issue yet.  We have explained to our 9 year old that we need some time to<br/>
ourselves and he seems to understand so around 9 or 9:30 he hangs out in his<br/>
room and reads.  If we are just sitting around in the office playing games<br/>
or reading, we invite him to join us.  If we need to be alone he seems to<br/>
repect that too.  We let him know when we are going to bed and we turn out<br/>
the lights but we slip him a flashlight to read under the covers.  He thinks<br/>
it&#39;s fun that way.  I&#39;d love to hear how other people work this out.<br/>

&gt; room and reads.  If we are just sitting around in the office playing games<br/>
&gt; or reading, we invite him to join us.  If we need to be alone he seems to<br/>
&gt; repect that too.  We let him know when we are going to bed and we turn out<br/>
&gt; the lights but we slip him a flashlight to read under the covers.  He thinks<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s fun that way.  I&#39;d love to hear how other people work this out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Around 10 pm every one starts to go off on their own. In our house that means <br/>
get out of day time clothes and into what ever you sleep in or don&#39;t sleep <br/>
in. It means reading quietly, working on a puzzle, watching a program, <br/>
playing with something by ones self in their own room until you get tired and <br/>
decide on your own to actually go to bed. The reason we *choose* (for lack of <br/>
a better word) this particular time is when Darin gets home from work (12 to <br/>
15 hour days) he doesn&#39;t take any time for himself, he wants to spend time <br/>
with the kids, and by 10 he is ready for his own alone time, which means <br/>
computer or playstation, and the kids are ready to be apart from each other. <br/>
Also at 10 I like to watch reruns of Law and Order on A&E, and that is my <br/>
alone time. After 11 - 11:30 it is *our* time together. So far this has <br/>
worked out, but there is no hard fast rule either. No one is being told to go <br/>
to bed, everyone gets some down time before bed, and everyone chooses when <br/>
he/she wants to actually go to sleep. (I think it is better for their natural <br/>
body patterns as well.) The only person who goes by an alarm is Darin because <br/>
he goes out to work. I don&#39;t care if I go to bed before my kids, because they <br/>
know if they really need something they can get me or Darin. We had a family <br/>
bed up until Jack was about 4 and he decided he wanted his own bed and Moly <br/>
started kicking too much. I still wake up some mornings with one or both of <br/>
them in our bed. Moly is a late to bed, early to rise person. She doesn&#39;t, at <br/>
this time, require as much sleep as me. Why should I make her go to bed just <br/>
because it suits me? Jack is usually asleep by 10:30, he falls asleep fast <br/>
and hard. He will literally play until he is asleep. Then he gets up sometime <br/>
around 3am and plays some more, gets something to eat (P.B. and honey) and <br/>
goes to the bathroom. He never wakes us up, he is very quiet and the only <br/>
reason I know he does this is that I suffer from insomnia. Then he goes back <br/>
to bed (not his own, most times it is ours or the couch) and sleeps until he <br/>
gets up which varies and I never know if he is going to be up at 7 or at 10. <br/>
I have no clue why he gets up in the middle of the night. I think he may have <br/>
intense dreams like me and gets up to work through them, but I don&#39;t know. <br/>
All I know is that this *system* works for us, it gives us all time to <br/>
decompress, be apart (which I think is very important) and pursue our own <br/>
interests totally uninterrupted. <br/>

  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: family responsibility<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  This is a fascinating discussion.  <br/>
<br/>
  My personal position is that God created us in such a way so that <br/>
  children, being among the weaker, needier members of the human race, <br/>
  have parents who will protect and care for them.  <br/>
<br/>
  God gave parents a natural love and desire to care for their <br/>
  offspring, and he gave offspring the gift of parents so that someone <br/>
  who cares for their well being would be their first introduction to <br/>
  the human race.  <br/>
<br/>
  It is through parents that we are supposed to learn self-confidence <br/>
  and healthy ways of dealing with things.  <br/>
<br/>
  I have changed a lot in my parenting style.  I used to be a James <br/>
  Dobson style parent and now I am at the point where I don&#39;t make my <br/>
  kids do anything they don&#39;t want to do.  However, where I draw the <br/>
  line is that I don&#39;t let them take advantage of me either.  For <br/>
  example, if I am going to keep my house in a somewhat decent order, I <br/>
  CAN&#39;T run around cleaning up after them all the time.  I have tried <br/>
  and I literally cannot do it all.  So, each person in my family, <br/>
  regardless of whether they are a child or an adult, must clean up <br/>
  after themselves.  I am there to love and nourish my children, but I <br/>
  won&#39;t be their maid for them unless it&#39;s something that they <br/>
  physically can&#39;t do for themselves.  So, if they are going to <br/>
  bake,they may bake as much as they want but I will not clean up their <br/>
  mess.  And I won&#39;t allow them to force me to live in a house that is <br/>
  filthy.  They must clean up.  If they don&#39;t clean up, then they can&#39;t <br/>
  bake next time.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy for us to allow anyone, <br/>
  even our children, to take advantage of us.  <br/>
<br/>
  The same thing goes for bedtime.  They have rights, but they have to <br/>
  learn to balance those rights by not taking advantage of someone <br/>
  else.  It is unsafe for my 3 and 5 year olds to be in a house by <br/>
  themselves unsupervised.  Therefore, they may stay up as long as I am <br/>
  up.  If I&#39;m up until 3 am and they want to be up with me, that&#39;s <br/>
  fine.  However, if I am going to bed at 11 they must go to bed then <br/>
  too.  It wouldn&#39;t be safe for them to be up without me.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; body patterns as well.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds ideal.  I have to slowly work in these things with my husband.<br/>
He was raised by an army drill sargeant.  Everyone was on a schedule and<br/>
everyone stuck to it no matter what.  He has loosened up quite a bit over<br/>
the years and so I am not too worried about it.  He will get over the<br/>
&quot;bed-time&quot; thing too.  I am just so happy right now that he is ok with<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The only person who goes by an alarm is Darin because<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he goes out to work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband also.  Unfortunately he has to get up really really early to get<br/>
to work without spending hours on the highway in rush hour.  He likes to be<br/>
in bed by 10.  I would prefer to go to bed around midnight.  He feels like<br/>
he has to stay up if I do, then he gets all grumpy when he doesn&quot;t get<br/>
enough sleep.  We usually compromise and go to bed around 11.  I don&#39;t care<br/>
so much if we don&#39;t go to bed at the same time but it is important to him.<br/>
If I can&#39;t sleep, I just get up after he falls asleep (which is usually<br/>
pretty quick).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;Why should I make her go to bed just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because it suits me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  We do the lights-out thing because we have a small house and we<br/>
can&#39;t get to sleep with any lights on.  The flashlight thing was a<br/>
compromise that works for us because Connor thinks it&#39;s fun.  He still gets<br/>
to stay up as late as he wants but it doesn&#39;t keep us from getting to sleep.<br/>
He&#39;s happy - we&#39;re happy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt; All I know is that this *system* works for us, it gives us all time<br/>
to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; decompress, be apart (which I think is very important) and pursue our own<br/>
&gt; interests totally uninterrupted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Finding a good balance takes time, to understand that everyone&#39;s needs are<br/>
equally important and to find a way that works for everyone.  The parents<br/>
don&#39;t have to sacrifice their needs for the kids and the kids don&#39;t need to<br/>
be treated like second-class citizens.  Every family is different....I think<br/>
being flexible is important too because needs will change as everyone grows<br/>
and gets older.  Jobs change, schedules change, people change.<br/>

presenting one choice as being better than an obviously bad choice is a<br/>
popular argument tactic, e.g., &quot;to be a human and a member of a human family<br/>
is perhaps preferable to the choices of a baby aligator or turtle --(to<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but that IS the way it is! they are here.. we are here.. there must be some<br/>
&gt; kind of cooperation.. children or adult .. cooperation must prevail<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Making choices for children doesn&#39;t sound like cooperation to me. Unless<br/>
you&#39;re using cooperation in the way many adults do with children as in &quot;You<br/>
need to cooperate,&quot; which means, in other words, &quot;You need to stop trying to<br/>
do what you want and do what I want you to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any statement that includes &quot;must&quot; should set off alarm bells. Perhaps some<br/>
will turn out true -- as in we must have oxygen to survive! But our society<br/>
has unconsciously filled us with oodles of them so &quot;musts&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot; and<br/>
&quot;need tos&quot; are well worth examining. (For example: Children must go to<br/>
school to learn. We must have 3 meals a day. Children must have regular<br/>
bedtimes. Parents must present a consistent and united front.)<br/>
<br/>
(And I&#39;ve found the people who frequent here and the Unschooling.com message<br/>
board (and the old AOL HSing forum) like Sandra and PamS and PamH among<br/>
others have been invaluable in helping me examine those! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The point of these parenting discussions isn&#39;t that conventional methods<br/>
don&#39;t work but that they aren&#39;t the only choice available. So for people to<br/>
jump into a discussion and insist that their methods are valid and they&#39;re<br/>
going to stick by them is to miss the point. The purpose of the discussion<br/>
*isn&#39;t* to force people to think a particular way. The purpose is to<br/>
*provide an opportunity* -- by asking questions and saying &quot;that&#39;s not your<br/>
only choice&quot; -- for people to question themselves on why they&#39;ve made the<br/>
choices they have. Some people, because of that opportunity, may come to<br/>
realize that for them the pros aren&#39;t worth the price they&#39;ve been paying<br/>
and that by rethinking what&#39;s important to them and examining their<br/>
priorities they may increase family joy. Through the discussions some people<br/>
get the opportunity to realize that letting go of something that seemed so<br/>
important is a small price to pay to get something greater that they hadn&#39;t<br/>
realized existed.<br/>
<br/>
Some people may feel their level of joy the rest of the time is more than<br/>
sufficient to outweigh the moments of nonjoy or the results are worth the<br/>
negatives of the process so they&#39;re going to continue doing what they&#39;re<br/>
doing. That&#39;s fine. The discussion *isn&#39;t* intended to make them change what<br/>
they&#39;re doing so the effect of jumping in to declare that they aren&#39;t going<br/>
to change is in effect trying to stop an opportunity for *others* to grow<br/>
and change.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to change, don&#39;t change! :-) Just skip the discussion and<br/>
let it continue for those who are finding some benefit in it.<br/>
<br/>
There is no agenda to make everyone here toe a particular parenting line.<br/>
Yes, I know, it may seem that way since conventional parenting does get<br/>
questioned everytime it comes up. But that&#39;s because conventional (coercive)<br/>
parenting *isn&#39;t* unschooling. Which *doesn&#39;t* mean conventional parenters<br/>
aren&#39;t unschoolers! People can be unschoolers and parent conventionally.<br/>
There&#39;s nothing in the philosophy that says unschooling needs to apply to<br/>
parenting. But that means discussing conventional parenting *isn&#39;t*<br/>
discussing unschooling any more than discussing math programs is<br/>
unschooling. And there *is* an agenda to keep the discussion on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But some people *do* extend unschooling into parenting so discussing how to<br/>
unschool parenting *is* discussing unschooling. That doesn&#39;t mean people<br/>
can&#39;t question it! For example, &quot;How will they learn to be polite unless we<br/>
make them?&quot; or any other seeming impossibility. It doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t<br/>
disagree that it&#39;s possible. (But it&#39;s hard to make that argument valid<br/>
since there are parents and kids here who are living it.)<br/>
<br/>
So, what it boils down to is that for some parenting is separate from<br/>
unschooling so for those people discussing parenting is *not* discussing<br/>
unschooling. (There are *plenty* of places where people can get conventional<br/>
parenting and housekeeping advice based on conventional American<br/>
priorities.) Or unschooling *does* encompass parenting, In which case<br/>
someone will face a huge uphill battle trying to defend conventional<br/>
parenting as unschooling. Conventional parenting techniques don&#39;t apply the<br/>
concepts of child-led learning (or any other definition of unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
So for some people discussing parenting in an unschooling forum is an<br/>
opportunity to discuss a way of parenting that for some is a natural<br/>
outgrowth of letting children learn naturally. Forcing children to do chores<br/>
is not a natural outgrowth of unschooling so discussing that isn&#39;t<br/>
discussing unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t too many places where people have the opportunity to reexamine<br/>
their priorities from a &quot;children as fellow and competent human beings&quot;<br/>
(though not the best way to phrase it) point of view. So if people want to<br/>
continue with whatever conventional practices work for them, then they<br/>
should. But it denies others the opportunity to reexamine their priorities<br/>
and explore extending unschooling into parenting by insisting that something<br/>
that isn&#39;t unschooling should be acknowledged as valid.<br/>

In our old house everyone had to get REALLY quiet because the bedrooms all <br/>

We have the luxury in our bigger house of having some people asleep and <br/>
others awake and active because there are literally two different roofs, and <br/>
even the big main part of the house is big enough to get pretty far from <br/>
sleeping others.<br/>
<br/>
I realize it&#39;s a luxury, and we take advantage of it too!  People who have to <br/>
get up early are given isolation, alarm clocks, and consideration.  Those who <br/>
stayed up late are given  a lot of quiet until noon, when we can go ahead and <br/>
turn music on and make full-volume noise.<br/>

Those who get up early sneak out quietly. <br/>

&gt; physically can&#39;t do for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seeing you as their maid implies that they want the house to be the way you<br/>
make it but want someone else to do it for them.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that they may appreciate the cleanness -- a neat room does have a<br/>
sense of peace about it that most people notice -- but that they *don&#39;t*<br/>
expect you to do it.<br/>
<br/>
If someone in my family loved flowers and always had a fresh arrangement on<br/>
the table, I&#39;d certainly appreciate the flowers, but, since I don&#39;t<br/>
appreciate them enough to make the effort worth it for me to do it myself, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t expect them to keep doing it. In fact I&#39;d be a bit miffed to find<br/>
out that they expected me to appreaciate it. I&#39;d want them to be doing<br/>
things that they found joy in, not things that they wanted others to<br/>
appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
If we do do something for others, it should be because we find joy in<br/>
knowing they will (or might if we&#39;re guessing they&#39;ll like something)<br/>
appreciate it, *not* in *expecting* them to appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the housework discussion is about trying to get across the idea that<br/>
what we do *is* a choice. We shouldn&#39;t clean because others expect us to. We<br/>
shouldn&#39;t clean because we have to. We should work towards doing whatever<br/>
brings us joy. If working towards our joy is making others lives less joyful<br/>
then perhaps we should turn the problem upside down or rethinking what&#39;s<br/>
really important to us to find new ways of tackling it to increase<br/>
everyone&#39;s joy :-)<br/>
<br/>
(And it often helps to find joy in housecleaning to realize we don&#39;t ever<br/>
have to do it again. And that when we do it it&#39;s because we want to see the<br/>
toilet go from yucky to sparkling, a room go from trashed to orderly ;-)<br/>
Maybe it&#39;ll be every day. Maybe it&#39;ll be once a year. Whenever *we* want to<br/>
appreciate the transformation. It&#39;s our choice.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy for us to allow anyone,<br/>
&gt; even our children, to take advantage of us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In terms of unschooling, a childhood spent in a messy house where<br/>
exploration is free and joyful is way more valuable than a childhood spent<br/>
in neat house where the exploration is limited to what the children are<br/>
willing to set up and clean up.<br/>
<br/>
We have the rest of our lives after the kids are gone to keep the house<br/>
neat. The kids have only a few years of childhood. What is learned in those<br/>
times of joyful exploration is worth a great deal more than memories of how<br/>
neat mom kept the house.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, where I draw the<br/>
&gt; line is that I don&#39;t let them take advantage of me either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nor should we, then, impose our needs on our kids. Not forcing the kids<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be equated with letting their needs trample ours or others.<br/>
Letting kids have their way doesn&#39;t help them learn to resolve conflicts.<br/>
Imposing our way on them doesn&#39;t help either and, in fact, teaches them that<br/>
being in a position to impose your way on those who are less powerful is a<br/>
useful technique of getting your way.<br/>
<br/>
How would you resolve a conflict of interest with another adult? The ways<br/>
most parents choose to resolve conflicts between themselves and a child<br/>
would drive most friends away. :-/<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, if they are going to<br/>
&gt; bake,they may bake as much as they want but I will not clean up their<br/>
&gt; mess.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to be this way about art. It seemed like it took 15 minutes to set up<br/>
and a half hour to clean up for 10 minutes of painting. And it seemed like I<br/>
should insist that if she wanted to paint that she be involved in setting<br/>
and cleaning up. The result was she chose not to paint.<br/>
<br/>
So what was gained? 20 years later, what would be more important? She might<br/>
not remember every time she painted but she&#39;d remember an atmosphere of the<br/>
freedom to do so. Or she&#39;d remember an atmosphere of &quot;No, it&#39;s not worth it<br/>
to me.&quot; Even a dozen times of not cleaning up art materials isn&#39;t worth the<br/>
price of the memory of an atmosphere of &quot;Yes, let&#39;s eplore!&quot;<br/>

of us to have that alone time. But we don&#39;t do a lights out, simply because <br/>
one child is afraid of the dark, and so am I for that matter. And because I <br/>
believe that if a light on in one room is bothering someone in another room <br/>
then a closed door is an option. My son turns on a lamp and the room light in <br/>
his room. After he falls asleep Darin or I turn off his room light but leave <br/>
the lamp on. Moly turns her own lights off. I sleep with the light on in our <br/>
closet and the door cracked. It used to bug my husband, but he saw how <br/>
absolutely terrified I became if we tried to leave the light off. Then we <br/>
tried another solution, I would go to bed before him and he would turn the <br/>
light off when he came to bed. That didn&#39;t work either, because somewhere in <br/>
my subconscious I could hear that click and would wake up screaming. We were <br/>
able to make one compromise, we arrange the bedroom so our bed is very close <br/>
to the closet, we shut the closet door to a crack and if I wake up with my <br/>
frequent nightmares or insomnia, then I can stay on the bed and open the <br/>
closet door a little more. That way I don&#39;t turn on a light and wake Darin <br/>
up. <br/>

3.  My oldest wants to go to swimming lessons tomorrow morning.  If I <br/>
let my 3 year old stay up as late as he wants, he still has to get up <br/>

<br/>
That. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And drawing from my own experience (not that I haven&#39;t done all the above <br/>
too...):<br/>
<br/>
While the kids are still all awake, rent a (new! exciting!) video and tell <br/>
them you need to go hang out with their dad a while, but you&#39;ll be back when <br/>
the movie&#39;s over. Tell them since it&#39;s rented if there are any parts you&#39;d <br/>
really like, they can show you the next day.  (That will keep them from <br/>
coming to get you to show you something you&#39;d really enjoy.)<br/>
<br/>
I came to enjoy quickies.  Pre-kids, half hour and 45-minute sessions were <br/>
normal.   Sometimes wham, bam isn&#39;t so bad!  (Unless you&#39;ve always had wham <br/>
bam, in which case see some of the above.)<br/>
<br/>
When I had toddlers I would get &quot;touched out&quot; and so a lot of fondling and <br/>
random carress was NOT high on my needs list.    Now that they&#39;re bigger, I <br/>
like the long appointments better again.<br/>
<br/>
Usually after the conjugal deed was done, I&#39;d get back up and hang out with <br/>
the kids some more, or I would have arranged for Kirby to take care of <br/>
last-minute bedtime stuff and told them after the movie if they really needed <br/>
me to come back there and get me.<br/>
<br/>
Now that they&#39;re older I say &quot;I need to hang out with Keith a while,&quot; and <br/>
they don&#39;t need details.  <br/>
<br/>
For early morning stuff, I&#39;d carry the toddler to the car with a blanket and <br/>
a pillow and stay with that one while the older one did whatever (unless it <br/>
was the hottest or coldest part of the year).<br/>

&gt; &gt; believe that if a light on in one room is bothering someone in another<br/>
&gt; room<br/>
&gt; &gt; then a closed door is an option.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are all ok with the dark.  In fact, my little one has no problem<br/>
&gt; wandering through a completely dark house.  They *do* have a problem with<br/>
&gt; closed doors though.  Maybe it was seeing Monsters Inc?  I often wonder how<br/>
&gt; we develop our individual fears...<br/>

do, then there is a reason for it. When looking at a new house, one of the <br/>
first things I do is check to see where the light switch is in a bedroom <br/>
measuring the distance from switch to bed area. I check to see how many <br/>
outlets to plug lamps in, and I check closets for lights as well. All closets <br/>
must have a bulb. I am obsessive about it. Light in a bedroom is a must have. <br/>
It is the first thing I look for in a house and if the house doesn&#39;t fit the <br/>
bill in that area, I won&#39;t even bother looking at the rest. No sense falling <br/>
in love with a beautiful home when the lighting is inadequate.<br/>
