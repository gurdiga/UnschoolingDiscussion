&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a group of unschoolers that call themselves radical unschoolers<br/>
&gt;that will NOT suggest anything.  In fact, they won&#39;t sit down and &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
&gt;anything even if the kids ask.  They tell them to find a resource and figure<br/>
&gt;it out themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not how I define &quot;radical unschooler,&quot; and I&#39;ve been calling <br/>
myself one for many years now, mostly as a way to differentiate what <br/>
we do from what sometimes passes for unschooling amongst the unaware. <br/>
When I know I&#39;m with people who understand the meaning of the word <br/>
I&#39;m just a plain ol&#39; unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
But sending a kid off to find their own resources and figure it out <br/>
themselves? Sounds cold.<br/>
