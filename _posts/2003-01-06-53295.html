&lt;&lt; how important is <br/>
that kind of community to human development.  If we don&#39;t have it <br/>
naturally, should we try to create it?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By encouraging their children to play, unschoolers are coming closer than <br/>
anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
People running private schools have a financial stake in making parents feel <br/>
they&#39;re doing something &quot;natural&quot; by spending big bucks to have their kids <br/>
away for many hours, many days.  Nobody running a private school is likely to <br/>
say &quot;No, this is just a poor excuse for an enriched life, and you can do it <br/>
at home for free.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As kids get older, and parents give them more freedom, they&#39;ll do what kids <br/>
do in the early 21st century.  They  can&#39;t do what kids did in 1950, or 1930. <br/>
 That&#39;s gone. <br/>
<br/>
I think one of the most counterproductive things people can do is pine for <br/>
the good old days, instead of finding the joy in today.  <br/>
<br/>
Just about every sect or philosophy that pushes for &quot;getting back to...&quot; some <br/>
time or other is glorifying a time when the people of that time were wanting <br/>
to &quot;get back to&quot; some 70 or a hundred years before THAT.  The Amish are stuck <br/>
in a time; nuns dress like they&#39;re living in the Middle Ages, sometimes, if <br/>
their order was founded then.  Hippies wanted to live like pioneers.  Some <br/>
kids now want to live like 1970&#39;s hippies.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids went to play because their families were sadistic and they hid out <br/>
elsewhere when they could, or their moms told them to go away and not come <br/>
home until supper.  I have a friend whose mom did that in the 1960&#39;s.  &quot;GO <br/>
PLAY,&quot; by which she meant &quot;be elsewhere and do not be here&quot; on any days he <br/>
wasn&#39;t in school.<br/>
<br/>
I think idealizing other times and places is likely to give a sugared <br/>
version.  But I DO think playing is totally important, and I think <br/>
unschooling families should try as much as they can to find other families, <br/>
neighbors, friends who can be at their house as much as possible, and other <br/>
places for their kids to be--with other families in other houses, visiting to <br/>
the point that they&#39;re not treated like company.<br/>

***One argument a Sudbury guy made was that it used to be <br/>
that it was common for kids to leave their house during the day and <br/>
run around the village to play and create their own world apart from <br/>
the adults.***<br/>
<br/>
My aunt was born in 1917 the oldest of about six hundred siblings.   They<br/>
were required to get up early, do their chores, bring in water from the<br/>
spring, milk cows, etc, and then they were sent outside.   That was it.<br/>
Go outside.  Their mom just had too much to do to have that many kids<br/>
running around the house all day.<br/>
<br/>
Their mom was also a midwife and sometimes when they woke up in the<br/>
morning she wouldn&#39;t be there.  If their dad was off working, setting or<br/>
checking trap lines, and she got called to a birth, she would go and<br/>
expect her kids to fend for themselves for two or three days sometimes. <br/>
My mom remembers crying and wondering if they would be alone forever.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with Sandra on this.   The people who pine for how it used to be are<br/>
seldom the people who had to live through how it used to be.   <br/>

There are people who even pine for the 1950&#39;s!  YIKES.<br/>
Yes, the war was over.  Yes, lots of people had new cars and houses.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids&#39; clothes were awful.  Bikes were pretty crummy.  Television was in black <br/>
and white...<br/>
<br/>
But socially, it was not glorious.  <br/>

Keith said one of the humor shows Saturday had a sketch about a 50&#39;s diner, <br/>
and two couples go in and they won&#39;t serve the black couple, as part of their <br/>
&#39;50&#39;s ambiance.  And they wouldn&#39;t serve diet coke because it hadn&#39;t been <br/>
invented.  I&#39;m sorry I missed it.   Women were treated very badly then too.  <br/>
And their clothes were pretty awful too (except maybe rich women).  Too-tight <br/>
shoes, deformed toes, awful cotton bras made kinda like pointy pot-holders, <br/>
hooks and eyes on skirts, everything having to be starched and ironed, women <br/>
expected to wear curlers EVERY night or else all day.   People eating <br/>
breaded-pan-fried, deep-fried, jello-salad everything.<br/>

Yuck,   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
reminds me of Pleasantville,   had some good talks with my daughter about the ideas in that movie.  I thought it was kind-of dumb at first,  but then it kind-of came around.   Anyone else see is?<br/>
