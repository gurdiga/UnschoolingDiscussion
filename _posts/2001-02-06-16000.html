<div id="ygrps-yiv-564723499">I have subbed to this group about a week. Although the topics under<br/>
discussion are very interesting, I was wondering if I could get sme help in<br/>
actually the education of my high school son.<br/>
He has been homeschooling about a year. We have read the right books (How to<br/>
Quit School , When the Skylark sings , etc.) I have allowed him to deschool,<br/>
etc. He does however want to get into a good college and is interested in<br/>
learning science/math. My difficulty is on one hand allowing him to unschool<br/>
and on the other trying to document learning according to traditional<br/>
subjects especially in the Maths. As a result we actually bought our only<br/>
curriculum , he is completing Geometry with MathUSee. He would like to stear<br/>
away from the textbook approach however. When it comes to Algebra II, Trig,<br/>
and Calculus, does anyone have suggestions for making sure that he has the<br/>
knowledge base of these subjects down, but a way that he can learn them that<br/>
is more experiential/unschooling?This is a real tug of war that we are going<br/>
through trying to unschool but then trying to learn certain things.<br/>

Here they tell you how to use a protractor, and relate<br/>
it to building things. What better way to learn a<br/>
concept than to use it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016565243">I did a search on high school geometry and this is th<br/>
epage it gave me. There are TONS of websites for it,<br/>
and thats just one concept for high school math. Also<br/>
try askjeeves.com , I have found that site helpful for<br/>
EVERYTHING!<br/>

subjects especially in the Maths.&quot;<br/>
As far as putting it all on paper, you&#39;ll have to keep<br/>
track of the concepts he learns as you go. At the end,<br/>
you might present it like a resume-- thats really what<br/>
it is, anyway. He&#39;ll probably need a good SAT score,<br/>
too , if college requires, that. <br/>

Plural on maths means you&#39;re not in the U.S., so our advice on GED and SAT <br/>
and stuff might be worthless.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend, for the unschooling aspect, reading about math-related <br/>
subjects--physics, astronomy, architecture, physics of music and instrument <br/>
construction (if he has any knowledge of or interest in music), perspective <br/>
and tromp l&#39;oiel (spelling probably all wrong on that) in art, mechanics of <br/>
engineering (trains, airports, bridges, road construction), historic clocks <br/>
and their maintenance and repair, and pipe organs and their construction and <br/>
maintenance and tuning.  That would help bring in the usefulness and <br/>
applications of math, and he would start to make his own &#39;scaffolding&#39; of how <br/>
math lives in the world.  <br/>
<br/>
Next (not first) I&#39;d find him some cool websites or books on the history of <br/>
math and history of science.    <br/>
<br/>
Also, find whatever back issues of science magazines you can find (Popular <br/>
Mechanics, Popular Science, Scientific American or whatever equivalent <br/>
available to you) which should be available at thrift stores or from science <br/>
minded friends.  <br/>
<br/>
Once he&#39;s interested and starting to get it on his own, maybe find a course <br/>
at a local college for him to take just for fun (not for credit, if possible, <br/>
just to be in a college level math situation to see how he takes to it).  <br/>

At google.com I put in &quot;math history physics&quot; and got a REALLY cool site <br/>
(well, lots of them) but this one has all kinds of links and pictures and <br/>
connections.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717716884">Is he going to be going into an area that requires the use of the<br/>
fundamentals of these subjects?  If not, we use Multimedia from ProOne.  I<br/>
used WordPerfect to set up a chart and then filled in the titles from all<br/>
the menus and then filled in the dates he completed each and the &quot;grade&quot; the<br/>
computer gave him.<br/>
<br/>
For example, on Algebra, one section was about Graphing Linear Inequalities,<br/>
Forms of Linear Equation, Finding the Slope of a Line and Identying<br/>
Functions.  Each got a line with a date and a grade.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312706209">Just about anything and everything written by or about a scientist named <br/>
Richard P. Feynman is wonderful for sparking in interest in higher math and <br/>
science.  His autobiographical stuff like &quot;Surely you must be joking, Mr <br/>
Feynman&quot;  and &quot;What do YOU care what other people think&quot;  are wonderful <br/>
springboards into the life of this very interesting character.<br/>
<br/>
The best news is that if you even have a half way decent library in your <br/>
area you should be able to find most, if not all of the books.  After the <br/>
intro through the very fascinating autobio stuff, there are books and tapes <br/>
on his lectures.<br/>
<br/>
I never had much of an interest in physics, but this guy really is very <br/>
interesting.  It is a great read for teens as well as their parents (my <br/>
husband and I first read them in our early 20s).<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps someone out there!<br/>
<br/>
Sandi<br/>
<br/>
PS the title of the latest book published about him in 1999 was entitled <br/>
&quot;The Pleasure of Finding Things Out&quot;, I have not read it, but the title <br/>
alone screams out a must read!<br/>

Also Bucky Fuller has some works that are not *textbooks* but full of higher<br/>
maths.  Fuller&#39;s Earth is one we&#39;ve owned and used.  Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s<br/>
work would also be useful.<br/>
<br/>
And I think studying the history of math, how each invention/discovery<br/>
changed the world brings about understanding also.  It shows you what trig<br/>
was used for, thus making connections.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a poster in one of the math catalogs (sorry to be so vague) that is<br/>
just a big chart answering the question &quot;when will I ever use this math<br/>
concept?&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if it covers much higher level math, though.  But it seems<br/>
like an interesting road map or atlas for the kind of exploration Sandra is<br/>
proposing.  A way to quickly connect a particular math topic to a<br/>
scientific application.  (But maybe I&#39;m approaching it backwards.)<br/>
