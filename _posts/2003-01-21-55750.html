&gt; I just have a quick question.  I&#39;m a new subscriber to the list (referred by<br/>
&gt; a fellow unschooler from another list) and wondered if Christians are<br/>
&gt; welcome here.  Maybe I just joined at a bad time?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome, Liz. :) I&#39;m a Christian and they seem to like me okay. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve pretty much described the style of Christianity that you&#39;re not, the<br/>
precepts of which are likely to be challenged here. I think you&#39;ll find this<br/>
a pretty good list (you certainly have the requisite senses -- humor and<br/>
common! ;)<br/>
