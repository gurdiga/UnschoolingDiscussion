was and how to do it one day after hearing her cousin talk about &quot;awful <br/>
diagramming&quot;, but other than that, I haven&#39;t used it at all since I&#39;ve been <br/>
out o school.  : )<br/>

<br/>
I diagrammed tons of Russian and English sentences when I was a student in Slavic Linguistics. Although I know most of us aren&#39;t learning Russian and Polish and Czech, it *really* helped me to play around with the sentences. I have since diagrammed sentences with my university students (prospective teachers and graduate students in education) to explain to them why punctuation is important and how placement of phrases can be ambiguous. <br/>
<br/>
We talk so much about multiple ways of knowing and this is a really helpful way for visual learners to grab what&#39;s happening in a sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just an oddball (no one here would be the first to say so!), but I thought it was great fun and a terrific break from the ho-hum of regular work.<br/>
<br/>
A hint for those who might want to try diagramming in a new way, see what happens when you use colors to differentiate parts of speech. It can become another way for those visual types to see when to use &#39;who&#39; and when to use &#39;whom&#39; for example.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718095032">Well, as a visual learner, I learned a lot from diagramming sentences. <br/>
 It helped me &#39;see&#39; how modifiers related to the rest of the sentece <br/>
and understand about misplcing them and the effects that can have.<br/>
<br/>
I bought my girls a diagramming workbook and showed them a bit about <br/>
it, but they didn&#39;t find it as fun or interesting as I did, so I let <br/>
it go.  I guess it&#39;s useful to some and not to others.<br/>

<br/>
1.  Have you ever read Anquished English, by Richard Lederer? <br/>
<br/>
2.  Have you ever seen this one:<br/>

A woman without her man is nothing<br/>

Add the punctuation.  Men and women tend to add it differently.<br/>
