<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717751455">Today, Dd spent the morning collecting leaves and bark and twigs and<br/>
foilage.  She wanted to know what the different trees in our yard<br/>
were, so we went down to the library and got a few identifier books<br/>
for our area, and spent the afternoon pouring over, trying to<br/>
determine which trees were which.<br/>
<br/>
She wants to do flowers and bushes (shrubs?) next.  I think we can do<br/>
the shrubbery, but the flowers may have to wait until spring.  (Or--I<br/>
just had this idea--we may go to a nursery--I&#39;ll have to see what she<br/>
thinks of that).<br/>

You could look at gardening books too.  It&#39;s harder to identify a<br/>
specimen from those artsy photographs but it might be fun.  Flower design<br/>
books might be fun to look at too.<br/>
<br/>
There might be a garden club in your area that has free information or a<br/>
little library they&#39;d let you peek through.  <br/>
<br/>
Your county extension agent and your local Forest Service office will<br/>
have pamphlets and brochures about native trees and bushes and<br/>
wildflowers and noxious weeds in your area.   The county extension agent<br/>
can answer a lot of questions too or identify a specimen for you and they<br/>
sometime have brochures about garden/landscape plants that do well<br/>
locally - that might lead you to on-line pictures from which you could<br/>
identify your garden flowers.   An on-line search for annuals or<br/>
perennials for your location might get you some good pictures.  <br/>
<br/>
I envy you living where nurseries are still open!  Around here they all<br/>
shut down in the fall and we are greenless until spring.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
