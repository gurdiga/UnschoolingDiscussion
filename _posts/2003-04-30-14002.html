<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That would be falsification of documents.  Jesus.  I don&#39;t doubt some state<br/>
&gt; is doing it, but I doubt all states are doing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Common practice in virtually all states from when I was adopted, at least.<br/>
<br/>
My sister and I were both adopted in the 1960&#39;s, she from Washington state<br/>
and me from Illinois.  Both our birth certificates indicate city of birth<br/>
correctly, but mother and father are listed as our adopted parents.  The<br/>
original birth certificate is inacessible by court order.  I know, I&#39;ve<br/>
tried to get it.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re missing here is that it was (likely still is) within the bounds<br/>
of adoption law to do this.  If it&#39;s legal, it&#39;s not falsification of<br/>
documents.  There is a law permitting it.<br/>

Not if it was in WA state.<br/>
YOU can&#39;t get it, but you could hire W.A.R.M. for a mere $350.<br/>
They will access the court records and perform a search for you. If contact <br/>
is made, they will ask birth mother/parents if contact by adoptee is <br/>
acceptable. If it is, you will be given the information. If not, it&#39;s still <br/>
possible to have WARM ask some questions for you.<br/>
Depends.<br/>
WARM is Washington Adoption Rights Movement and they&#39;ve been doing this for a <br/>
long time. Other states are following their example and starting up mediator <br/>
programs that are similar.<br/>

<br/>
What I&#39;m missing is the principle of who made legal that what is still called <br/>
&quot;certificate of live birth&quot; or &quot;birth certificate&quot; is not that at all.<br/>
