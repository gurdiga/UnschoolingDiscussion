<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; really does not like to draw <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i cant see how it would be very inspiring to him if he doesnt care to draw!  <br/>
but i liked the suggestions of someone else who mentioned the picking out <br/>
things to keep, etc.  my kids didnt like to draw much at 5 but now (7.5 & 10) <br/>
really enjoy it and do it spontaneously for pleasure... (not neccessarily <br/>
nature drawing, just whatever they feel like drawing.  for my 7yo it is <br/>
egyptian people in ancient dress at the moment!)  i am reading &quot;the charlotte <br/>
mason companion&quot; (k. andreola) right now and enjoying it.  i dont plan to <br/>
follow the method, but enjoy hearing the philosophy, and parts of it i will <br/>
absorb i&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
i attended a raymond and dorothy moore seminar this wk and  couldnt believe <br/>
how &quot;unschooly&quot; they are!  many of you will be familiar with them, their <br/>
names have been around in homeschooling since the 70&#39;s-- and are both turning <br/>
85 this year!  they call themselves &quot;the grandparents of homeschooling&quot; (a <br/>
generous term) but in reality have had an influence and have some great <br/>
recommendations to share.  the &quot;moore formula&quot; includes a(n equal?) <br/>
combination of work, service and study with NO formal schooling til at least <br/>
10-13years old.  they share lots of research about the proof for delaying <br/>
formal studies including some interesting info from opthalmogists on the <br/>
development of the eye.  they encourage parents to listen to our children, <br/>
find their interests and let them be motivated to learn all they want!   i <br/>
did not agree with everything i heard (they promote ezzo and babywise for <br/>
babies!!  ugh.  ...and dont recommend reading fiction... ????)  but much of <br/>
what i heard was affirming and encouraging.    btw, i would recommend their <br/>
book or some tapes over hearing them in person-- they are a bit, well, <br/>
reflecting their age when they speak!<br/>
