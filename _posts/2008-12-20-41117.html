I&#39;ve added it to my  myths page<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/myths">http://sandradodd.com/myths</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141489631">I am one who used to believe that sugar was the culprit behind some of<br/>
my son&#39;s more rambunctious behavior. Until I read several articles<br/>
about the myth. I decided to observe more objectively to draw my own<br/>
conclusion on the matter. <br/>
<br/>
I began observation before reducing restrictions I had in place<br/>
regarding sugary treats. What I found is that even the mere mention of<br/>
something sweet caused a bit of excitement in my son. If I offered him<br/>
something sweet, he would get a bit fidgety with anticipation..<br/>
possibly break out in a little victory dance or hop up and down and<br/>
say &#39;goody!&#39; This is before he ever even accepted the treat.<br/>
<br/>
After I gave him the treat, the excitement of getting something<br/>
special and sometimes the frustration of still craving more remained<br/>
for a short period. In fact, if he asked for more and I replied with a<br/>
&quot;no,&quot; his behavior worsened. Not because of the sugar, but because he<br/>
wasn&#39;t permitted to have something he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, he would get excited over a sugar-free cookie. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
that he was behaving differently, just happy to get something<br/>
special.. like opening a christmas present.<br/>
<br/>
When I realized that it was not actually sugar and more just the<br/>
thrill of getting something special and subsequent frustration at<br/>
knowing he wouldn&#39;t get anymore for a while, I reduced restrictions on<br/>
sugary treats. Now, my son generally eats what he wants when he wants<br/>
it. I&#39;ve noticed that the excitement of getting something he likes,<br/>
that he&#39;s not normally allowed to have has diminished greatly and he<br/>
pretty much acts the same whether he&#39;s eating spinach or cookies.<br/>
<br/>
He still gets excited about special treats we don&#39;t often indulge,<br/>
like donuts for breakfast or holiday desserts.</div>

evidence to prove it!  <br/>

thanks sandra for adding it to your page of myths.  i really needed to read that page, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631521486">i thought i&#39;d share a recent example of the extinction of the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; syndrome that has come from eliminating controls on foods/desserts.  <br/>
<br/>
the kids have chocolate advent calendars, and my son was pretty excited about it when we first got it.  but the last three days, he has been happy to open it, but has wanted me or his dad or sister to eat the chocolate.  <br/>
<br/>
he told me today he is kind of sick of chocolate at the moment and also doesn&#39;t want to have too much before christmas so he will enjoy what&#39;s in his stocking.<br/>
<br/>
this is my child who i swore would eat sugar and ONLY sugar &quot;if i let......&quot;<br/>
<br/>
as a toddler he stuffed so many chocolate easter eggs in his mouth at once he gagged and threw up.<br/>
<br/>
now - he still loves dessert, but often chooses other things instead and even turns down desserts on a regular basis.  <br/>
<br/>
it took 9 months of trust to get there.  <br/>

You don&#39;t even have to leave the place you&#39;re sitting to make an  <br/>
internal change so that you can stop blaming anything or anyone.  If  <br/>
you move toward helping your child make choices and feel his own body  <br/>
and his own needs, and accept that it&#39;s by making choices that people  <br/>
learn to make better choices, you can let go of that harshness and  <br/>
negativity and resentment and fear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349831942">Yes.  Karl really has zero extra excitement about run of the mill sugar<br/>
treats.  Sugary muffins with icing for breakfast while we&#39;re visiting<br/>
relatives... no hopping and bopping.. just eating breakfast.  Yeh.  Then<br/>
there are certain things he likes especially that we might not always have<br/>
on hand (because we forget and he doesn&#39;t think of them or remember to make<br/>
requests of them or whatever) and when they suddenly show up he *is* like<br/>
&quot;oh cool!&quot; and will down 2 or 3 or however many.  We had a run on a new<br/>
discovery of marshmallows around Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
But as far as the sugar itself making Karl hyper.  Nah, he is himself as<br/>
usual after super sugar-sweetened muffins with icing.  It&#39;s pretty much the<br/>
same as eggs and bacon breakfast or cereal breakfast.  Not any different<br/>
that *I* can tell.  Brian swears that sugar makes kids hyper though<br/>
(probably because it&#39;s common so called wisdom that he wouldn&#39;t dream of<br/>
giving up considering the work done on Karl&#39;s teeth or something like<br/>
that).  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think any long range study of total dietary consumption of sugar would<br/>
be hard.  As a kid, I liked all sugar and sweet things.  As an adult, I<br/>
really don&#39;t like candy much at all, and since I can&#39;t eat gluten, I<br/>
rarely eat cookies and cakes and such because the gluten free kind are<br/>
expensive and more difficult to make myself.  I put sugar in my coffee<br/>
and that&#39;s about it, except the occasional goodie.<br/>
<br/>
So, even in a long range study, people&#39;s tastes change and their diets<br/>
change, so I think it would all balance out for each individual.  I<br/>
really don&#39;t think sugar is bad for people.  I think anything that is<br/>
overconsumed could be potentially harmful, but I know that if people can<br/>
eat what they want when they want, they won&#39;t overconsume, unless of<br/>
course they have had food issues in the past.</div>

 </span></blockquote>My son has been in a Trix cereal phase, it was almost all he was <br/>
eating until late in the day.  I didn&#39;t notice any hyperactivity, or <br/>
attention deficit, or anything generally associated to sugars and <br/>
artificial flavors and colors ... but by late afternnon he was <br/>
feeling very emotionally fragile, and I think this was more related <br/>
to lack of calories and protien than too much sugar.  So we started <br/>
talking about food choices, trying to work together to find some <br/>
additional foods.  He is pretty even keeled emotionally speaking, so <br/>
the extreme tears and screaming were quite a surprise for both of <br/>
us.  Both times, when I encouraged him to eat a little protien he <br/>
felt himself regain stability.<br/>
<br/>
But he really was wanting sweet foods, he said that his stomach was <br/>
only feeling good when he ate sweet foods and the cheese and salami <br/>
was making him feel nauseous.  I started to read all the nutritional <br/>
labels ... turns out 1/2 cup of HaaganDaz icecream has more protien <br/>
that 1/2 cup of yogurt.  If he eats 8 oz of icecream he will have <br/>
more protien than if he eats a 1&quot; cube of cheese (plus more calories <br/>
and fats -- which he can use given how active he is and the cold <br/>
weather).  It was perfect, now we know that if he is craving sweets <br/>
and needs a little protien to help balance him out, he can eat a bowl <br/>
of icecream and get everything he needs.  <br/>
<br/>
But then today he ate a soft boiled egg and a ton of bacon for <br/>
breakfast ... he listens to his body, the value of a sweet breakfast <br/>
versus a savory breakfast comes from his internal sensors not from <br/>
any external source.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124167802">I think our situation seems to point out- in moderation, everything&#39;s <br/>
ok. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re currently in the middle of diet elimination process coz DS has <br/>
been very high-energy for the past 3 weeks. <br/>
<br/>
We know for a fact that sugar doesn&#39;t make him hyper, BUT we&#39;re <br/>
suspecting the milk in his past 3 weeks or so&#39;s daily breakfast bowl <br/>
of his favourite Nestle Golden nugget might just be the culprit here. <br/>
Not saying DS is allergic to diary, but then maybe a daily bowl full <br/>
of milk might just be too much. DS likes Frosties too, and he seems <br/>
fine eating it. So we&#39;re alternating his breakfast between cereals and <br/>
eggs and toast and pancakes, like we did before. <br/>
<br/>
So, it&#39;s been a week now, we stuck to soft bowl eggs with cornflakes <br/>
(i know this sounds yukky, but it works coz the cornflakes is actually <br/>
salty). He&#39;s all of the sudden calmed yesterday and this morning, woke <br/>
up nice and easy (unlike the past 3 weeks whereby he literally sprung <br/>
out of bed the minute his eyes opened LOL!), able to focus on what <br/>
he&#39;s doing and able to &quot;hear&quot; what we&#39;re saying and glad to say, less <br/>
accident prone. <br/>
<br/>
Again, like yogurt especially the organic type. Strange when he had <br/>
those sugar loaded normal kiddie ones, he seems fine. But when we <br/>
swithced into an organic brand, if I remember correctly, too much of <br/>
it seems to coincidde with his erratic mood. So nowadays, he&#39;s only <br/>
have a small cup amount daily.<br/>
<br/>
Too much crisp and cornchips also trigger off his hyperness. But then <br/>
like i said, if it&#39;s there, it&#39;s meant to be eaten. So if we buy any, <br/>
I&#39;m prepared to let him go thru the whole bag until it&#39;s finished.<br/>
 <br/>
And chewing gum too. DS loves chewing gum, and i&#39;m convinced it&#39;s the <br/>
aspartame. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t seems to find aspartame free minty <br/>
gum here in UK.  <br/>

What&#39;s wrong with high energy?  Are you two introverted parents with  <br/>
an extroverted child?<br/>

Is Christmas exciting?<br/>
<br/>
Have you had company or been travelling?<br/>

There&#39;s nothing wrong with waking up happy and exciting and springing  <br/>
out of bed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But when we swithced into an organic brand, if I remember  <br/>

<br/>
Why not get chewing gum with sugar then?  It will be gone in the  <br/>
first few minutes anyway.  The sweetness is the first thing to be  <br/>
dissolved in sugary gum.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of mom-feeling  and mushiness in what you wrote.  &quot;I&#39;m  <br/>
convinced,&quot; &quot;if I remember correctly,&quot; and &quot;seems to.&quot;   Instead of  <br/>
trying to prevent his high energy, can you plan for it and count on it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222513595">A few things to look into:<br/>
Gums with xylitol: those even help avoid cavities and taste awesome ( we alwasy have a big stash)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Some people swear raw milk is better. We only drink raw but we have a dairy so its easy for us.<br/>
I can drink tons of raw milk and I get not gas or upset, if I drink homogenized milk I have LOTS of both.<br/>
here is more info:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.realmilk.com/">http://www.realmilk.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I also want to note that I see some parents always blaming a behaviour to some food. I am not saying that artificial dyes, or any food sensitivity are not a culprit. <br/>
I have come ,in my life, to figure its always a combination of factors that influence how one &quot;behaves&quot;.<br/>
Was your son excited about Christmas? a new game? any changes in his life?<br/>
How is his health? has he been eating  normal for him?<br/>
New development milestones being achieved?<br/>
Any changes in the weather? the household?<br/>
How are you interacting with him? Less time? More time? <br/>
any changes in your relashioship with him? or how you react to him?<br/>
Has he been drinking less water than he needs ? maybe a little dehydrated?<br/>
Have you had visitors in your home? has he made a new friend he is excited about?<br/>
Is he just energetic because his life is good and he is happy?<br/>
There is so much that can , together or not with a sensibility, cause changes in ones behaviour.<br/>
That is my opinion on it.<br/>

Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Merry Xmas and hope you and family had a wonderful day. <br/>
<br/>
LOL!! I&#39;m glad you wrote the above. Funny, I never thought of it <br/>
that way, but i&#39;m liking this perspective you&#39;ve switched me onto. <br/>
Yes, i agree, me and hubby is introvert and DS is definetelt an <br/>
extrovert. Which explain what you&#39;ve advise below, which i totally <br/>
agree. Nothing wrong with it. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There&#39;s nothing wrong with waking up happy and exciting and &gt; <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m trying very hard to source non-aspartame gums in UK but with no <br/>
success. Seems like the only option is to buy in bulk from a US <br/>
online site. They seems to advertise non-aspartame Wrigleys <br/>
doublemint and spearmint sticks. <br/>
<br/>
Well erratic mood for DS means, he&#39;s so high energy that he&#39;s easily <br/>
excitable by anything that he seems to want to do a million things <br/>
all at the same time, then get angry because he couldn&#39;tdecide. He <br/>
can also switched to low moods at any moment, due to either <br/>
accidently hurting himself or frustration over simple things, mostly <br/>
computer games. When he is in this frame of mind, he tends to jump <br/>
alot, on sofa, on floor, or on me, it&#39;s like he&#39;s on an obstacle <br/>
course through out the day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There&#39;s a lot of mom-feeling  and mushiness in what you <br/>

to.&quot;   Instead of  trying to prevent his high energy, can you plan <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I agree, there&#39;s alot of mum-feeling weariness and mushiness <br/>
above. Well, I guess, as much as I can plan and expect and <br/>
accomodate his energy, there&#39;s still a limit to however much knocks <br/>
i can take (today i got a busted lip coz DS decided to crash into me <br/>
for a bear hug and as I reciprocate his hug, he dedide to jump up <br/>
LOL!! hence a spliting my lips) and high emotional outburst to <br/>
placate when he is on the extreme end.   <br/>
<br/>
Have a lovely holiday and all the best for 2009.<br/>

I know it sounds sad, and yes, Ds is certainly full of purpose every <br/>
morning. But i would certainly think being woken up by someone jumping <br/>
and landing on me, or being kicked in the face by a jumping boy who <br/>
literally springs up from the bed (we co-sleep), EVERY morning is abit <br/>
too overzealous and over zest, don&#39;t you think?<br/>

enthusiatically, but with less springs.  <br/>

I avoid aspartame as much as I can... and sometimes I just gotta have bubble<br/>
gum!!  Commercial, current, Wrigley&#39;s, unfortunately, is no longer the<br/>
answer - most contain sugar, corn syrup AND aspartame...<br/>
I have found, when Hayden wants this kind of gum, that it&#39;s best for my<br/>
thoughts to turn to what is *good and right* about this situation instead of<br/>
focusing on the conjectured fears of the artificial sweetener -- &quot;My son&#39;s<br/>
Joy (my relationship with my son, providing him what he needs, etc) is more<br/>
important than what I fear.&quot;  (and *I* get it!! DH had a brain tumor, he<br/>
wasn&#39;t allowed aspartame even by accident because of the havoc it would<br/>
wreak with his brain&#39;s electricity).<br/>
Also, when I think of Fear, I think of Forgetting Everything is All Right,<br/>
and move back to remembering ;)<br/>

Diana, I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve replied back in a very self pitying way. I <br/>
didn&#39;t know about Hannah, but i do now. When I read your blog, i <br/>
broke down in tears, ashamed of myself. <br/>
<br/>
I truly see your point now, and yes, everytime when it gets too much <br/>
for me, I will remember Hannah.  <br/>
<br/>
My gratitude to you, for putting my perspective straight. Thank you. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
SharonBugs.</div>

&lt;&lt;&lt;(today i got a busted lip coz DS decided to crash into me  <br/>
for a bear hug and as I reciprocate his hug, he dedide to jump up  <br/>
LOL!! hence a spliting my lips)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Storm (4) does this to Dave and I a lot, and occasionally Wyl  (9), though <br/>
since he&#39;s smaller, Wyl doesn&#39;t get it as much. Over the last 3  years of <br/>
seemingly-unexpected quick movements, split lips and bitten  tongues, Dave and I <br/>
have learned to either &quot;chin up&quot; or turn our heads  aside. Sometimes I *do* <br/>
forget and then I just kick myself for forgetting!  :~)<br/>
 <br/>
Both my boys are high energy and constantly on the move. I was  like that <br/>
when I was younger, too. My need for movement was trained down into  vibrating my <br/>
leg or bouncing my knee because I moved &quot;too much&quot;, according to my  mother. <br/>
Even that eventually went by the wayside because she &quot;couldn&#39;t stand&quot; my  leg <br/>
bouncing. Now that I&#39;ve read how many calories that burns, I wish I could  <br/>
re-integrate it into myself! People often see my boys in public with their high  <br/>
energy and say something like, &quot;At least they&#39;ll sleep well, tonight&quot;. Well, <br/>
no.  They&#39;re always high energy. It doesn&#39;t wear them out-in fact, sometimes, I <br/>
think  energy begets more energy! But, I&#39;m glad they&#39;re in a family where <br/>
high energy  is cool and not something to be controlled or &quot;used&quot; as a sleep <br/>
inducer, and I  just smile at the other person. Sometimes I correct them, <br/>
sometimes I  don&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
When my boys&#39; energy seems to get to a frenetic level where  they seem to <br/>
feel *it* is controlling *them*, we try to do huge energy users  with them: <br/>
bouncing on the trampoline (uses *much* more energy than jumping on  the couch), <br/>
restraint games, full-out running-and-yellling-and-waving-of-arms  activity. One <br/>
of the boys&#39; favorites is one we call &quot;Escape&quot;. An adult wraps a  child (or <br/>
sometimes, big brother with little brother) in their arms and legs,  holding <br/>
snugly to avoid wiggle-out, and we gloat in an &quot;evil&quot; voice, &quot;I&#39;ve got  you, <br/>
now! You&#39;ll never escape!&quot; repeating as they struggle to force our arms  away <br/>
from them (as they giggle wildly) so they can get away. It used to be  easier <br/>
when we first started, but they are getting *strong*!! So, now we have to  play <br/>
several rounds, because they don&#39;t use the huge amounts of energy in one  round <br/>
that they used to. Tickling is a great energy-user as well... all that  <br/>
struggle and laughter... Dave and I just have to remember to listen well for  <br/>
&quot;stop&quot;, so that we can stop immediately. Which is often followed right up by  &quot;go&quot; <br/>
or &quot;tickle&quot; or &quot;more&quot;, because they enjoy it so much. But we only employ  <br/>
these techniques when they seem controlled by or overwhelmed by the extreme end  <br/>
of their energy. Most of the time there is lots of running, bouncing, yelling,  <br/>
wrestling, jumping-out-and-boo-ing, screaming with the thrill, sliding,  <br/>
tumbling, and other energy outputs here. It is just who they are and their  <br/>
activities are joyful to all of us (most of the time). Funny, they&#39;re happy to  sit <br/>
and paint quietly sometimes with Grandma... but maybe that&#39;s because they  <br/>
know they can be loud and active any time at home.<br/>
 <br/>
The unschooling groups really helped us adjust our thinking on  high energy, <br/>
*and* we got some ideas, but mostly it was seeing what worked in  our family <br/>
as we went along. &quot;Escape&quot; may not work for some kids just like other  kids&#39; <br/>
solutions don&#39;t work for our kids. <br/>
 <br/>
We have also made adaptations for our kids indoor energy  <br/>
expenditure-especially for wintertime. They also seem to see uses for things we  never would have <br/>
on our own! We put a loft bed above a double bed to get rid of  the crib, but <br/>
no one sleeps on it - however, it seems to have been obvious to  the boys <br/>
from the beginning that it was some sort of gymnastics equipment! :~) I  ask them <br/>
to keep it tamed down when I&#39;m still in bed, since it has escalated to  being <br/>
hit by flying feet, arms, heads, etc. before, but once I&#39;m awake and out  of <br/>
the way, they&#39;ve found amazing ways to use it for flips and hanging upside  <br/>
down, and hanging rightside up! We&#39;re in the process of putting in a rope  <br/>
swing/climber, as well. Having lots of space cleared for big body movements and  <br/>
activity is something I keep in the forefront of my brain to do. Big movement  <br/>
games like Twister and Hullabaloo are important, as well. And if all else <br/>
fails,  finding someplace outside our home and yard for huge activity works,  too.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

Thanks De, you&#39;ve given me plenty of ideas. We tickle alot too, a <br/>
great way to break the ice between DS and his dad, a great way to <br/>
shift my stress to a more positive grrrr...h, and we all end up <br/>
rooling over each other on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
We have an exercise gliding machine (tucked away for a while, i <br/>
believe it&#39;s time to bring it out again), a mini trampoline(that seems <br/>
to be more of a Lego play platform than a bouncing one LOL!) and a big <br/>
gym ball (DS loved to bounce and being rolled ontop of it).  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

Hi Sandra, it&#39;s one of those days when telling him doesn&#39;t seems to <br/>

&gt; Don&#39;t restrict his diet in hopes of a magical change.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or at least don&#39;t do it blindly.  My DD(6) was diagnosed with celiac disease and changing <br/>
her diet to exclude all gluten and gluten cross contamination DID result in a seemingly <br/>
magical change. I am not saying I think this child has celiac disease, but I am saying <br/>
gathering information and ruling things out to help a child feel better makes sense. The <br/>
more you can do this without seemingly randomly  (from the kid&#39;s point of view) <br/>
controlling your child&#39;s choices the better. <br/>
<br/>
Some kids are high energy and happily so.  My daughter was high then low and wanted <br/>
everything and nothing and when she had gluten in her system she was miserable with not <br/>
being able to make sense of any of it. With the gluten gone she has still has highs and <br/>
lows in energy and mood, but the energy behind them is different.  She can talk about <br/>
options and preferences and brainstorm solutions or take a step away and be with anger <br/>
or disappointment or choices or confusion or chaos or joy without  erratic energy making <br/>
her feel totally out of control and without resulting in physical outbursts that frequently <br/>
left her or others injured which only upset her even more, especially if she hurt others.<br/>
<br/>
I am sensitive to people seemingly randomly blaming food sensitivities and/or allergies on <br/>
normal healthy kid dispositions.  I am also sensitive to people dismissing the possibility <br/>
when others are exploring it. I am pretty sensitive to some things myself, but food <br/>
controls and judgements in my childhood meant that it took me many years into <br/>
adulthood to figure out things for my own body - I&#39;m still working on it. My own kids - <br/>
who eat what they choose- are pretty wise and very aware of their own bodies.  My 8 year <br/>
old eats very little dairy because she&#39;s found she does better without it and she&#39;s decided <br/>
that a lot of sugar without some protein makes her feel tired. She takes this info into <br/>
account when she makes her choices.  She sometimes chooses to eat these things anyway, <br/>
and she doesn&#39;t beat herself up when she does. I see my role as helping them navigate all <br/>
of this without clouding things with my own unresolved issues or prejudices.<br/>
<br/>
My DD with celiac is VERY careful to make sure she does not get any gluten! She is not <br/>
willing to suffer the consequences.  I do everything I can to make her life amazingly <br/>
yummy and abundant in a world that could easily look full of lack for her.  For her, not <br/>
following a lifelong gluten free diet could have dire health consequences. She is 6 and we <br/>
haven&#39;t really talked much about that.  Eventually she will have that info, but at this time it <br/>
is enough for her to eat this way to feel good now. And I&#39;m will be forever grateful that <br/>
someone suggested getting her tested even when she didn&#39;t have all of the &quot;classic&quot; <br/>
symptoms. With that stress on her body gone she can get on with  living a joyful life.</div>
