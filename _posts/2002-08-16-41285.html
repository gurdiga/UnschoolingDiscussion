<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  If you go there, just a mile or so down the street is East <br/>
&gt; Watertown and lots of little Armenian and Greek shops/bakeries.  Yum!  <br/>
&gt; Massis <br/>
&gt; Bakery, Sepal&#39;s Restaurant, and others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This sounds great. That&#39;s why the North End is so enjoyable, Italian <br/>
&gt; bakeries. Yum!<br/>

&gt; Has anyone been to the glass flower museum (all different types of flowers <br/>
&gt; blown from glass)near Cambridge? When I was a child, I remember reading <br/>
&gt; about it in a Nat. Geo. Thought it would be a fascinating place to go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;re going up there in September. Thought of getting Red Sox tickets, but <br/>
&gt; it looks as if that won&#39;t happen because of the strike.<br/>

to mind. Mineral room. Stuffed birds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972907944">We&#39;ll have to check out the musuem of natural history next time we&#39;re <br/>
there.  <br/>

I found this while I was looking for Boston info.  Perhaps others <br/>
will be able to use it.  They say you can visit 6 boston attractions <br/>
for $30. <br/>
