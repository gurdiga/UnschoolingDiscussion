<div id="ygrps-yiv-744786549">&lt;&lt; So, does inviting the unschooling philosophy into your life mean <br/>
 relinquishing all parental *controll*? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, what does control mean?  If it means I&#39;m not taking what my <br/>
children&#39;s <br/>
viewpoints are very seriously, or listening to them with equal <br/>
respect, then <br/>
no, control is not good.<br/>
But I think that&#39;s just semantics really. Because I do control <br/>
situations <br/>
every day.<br/>
Whether you want to call it control or just plain parenting, matters <br/>
not.<br/>
The fact is, I do control certains situations.<br/>
Which ones?<br/>
Well, first and foremost, safety issues.<br/>
I control my toddler if he wants to run in the street, grab a sharp <br/>
knife, <br/>
climb somewhere dangerous etc....<br/>
I control the older children by saying NO to something that is truly <br/>
dangerous....but I explain why and they usually understand. The key <br/>
here, is <br/>
to make sure it is truly dangerous, not just my own prejudice or <br/>
fears being <br/>
projected.<br/>
Like at the beach.....does my own fear of sharks or rip tides really <br/>
affect <br/>
them going out into deeper water? Or is the water fairly safe that <br/>
day and I <br/>
just need to shut up?<br/>
It&#39;s a constant questioning of myself and what the dangers truly are.<br/>
Letting them go out in the deeper water is probably safer than the <br/>
sun <br/>
exposure we get.....so some fears are just mine, and not reasonable <br/>
to apply <br/>
to them.<br/>
Regardless, I do control safetly issues. That&#39;s my job as a parent, <br/>
to keep <br/>
them safe and to point out ways they can keep themselves as safe as <br/>
possible <br/>
(after all, safety is something of an illusion in this dangerous <br/>
world!!).<br/>
<br/>
Second item of control, which sorta gets back to safety....<br/>
I control them if they are trying to verbally or physically hurt <br/>
anyone.<br/>
If there is conflict and they need help resolving it, I control the <br/>
situation.<br/>
For me, that does not equal punishment or my will over theirs. It <br/>
simply <br/>
means I may separate people or call a &quot;time out&quot; (meaning stop what <br/>
you&#39;re <br/>
doing right now so we can talk...like a &quot;pause&quot; button) to resolve <br/>
the <br/>
problem.<br/>
I don&#39;t let fighting spin out of control, or one person be rude and <br/>
mean to <br/>
another. I think it&#39;s taking everyone&#39;s needs into account and it&#39;s <br/>
my job to <br/>
make sure they have a safe venue for doing that.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on these other issues, I say I am indeed controlling the <br/>
situation, but <br/>
others may say no, that isn&#39;t control.<br/>
Like when we have a guest coming over, and I care that the house is <br/>
straightened up. I may ask everyone to pitch in and help me clean up. <br/>
Or if <br/>
I&#39;m just frustrated with it, I might be more pushy than usual.<br/>
I think that is a type of control, although if my kids said &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
going to <br/>
finish X,Y,Z and then I&#39;ll come help you Mom&quot; I would listen to them.<br/>
<br/>
Letting them choose how to spend their own money, how to dress, what <br/>
to eat <br/>
(I  have a big part in choosing what comes into the house and what to <br/>
cook <br/>
but they decide in the end), what to learn etc...<br/>
These are ways we can relinquish unecessary control.<br/>
The choices aren&#39;t to leave the kids on their own OR control them.<br/>
There is a happy medium, called dialoguing with them, working with <br/>
them, <br/>
respecting them while respecting yourself and giving them a variety <br/>
of tools <br/>
to use in different situations.<br/>
If I&#39;m trying to carry on a conversation with another adult, and my <br/>
kids are <br/>
getting too loud, I might suggest that they move it elsewhere <br/>
(outside maybe) <br/>
or remind them that I can&#39;t even hear the other person. So far <br/>
they&#39;ve been <br/>
willing to try and respect my request.....TRY being the key word. :)<br/>
I also don&#39;t expect to have much adult conversation if we&#39;re having <br/>
friends <br/>
over for them.  I know which kids they get all excited to be around, <br/>
and I <br/>
don&#39;t expect a quiet house.  Parental expectations can really mess <br/>
with how a <br/>
situation is viewed.<br/>
I don&#39;t hesitate to ask my children to respect me also...it&#39;s a give <br/>
and <br/>
take, not one sided.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, I still have parental control. I like to think of it as a <br/>
friendship <br/>
we&#39;re building together. I have more experience, so it&#39;s kind of like <br/>
having <br/>
a foreigner in my home that needs guidance.  Guidance is a good <br/>
thing, it&#39;s <br/>
all about how you approach it....with love and respect, or with anger <br/>
and <br/>
humiliation. (or anywhere in between).<br/>
I try for the love and respect, sometimes I fail, but it gets better <br/>
and <br/>
better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the point I always try to get across to my best friend when she <br/>
brings this issue up with me. I can&#39;t expect the kids to not be kids and be <br/>
quiet just so she and I can talk. We have her and her kids over so the kids <br/>
can play, not so they can tiptoe around us while we talk! She has this whole <br/>
puritan children should be seen, not heard issue hanging on in her brain, <br/>
although she would deny it, I&#39;m sure. I also have to remind her that a day of <br/>
play with her kids is not a typical day at our house. Nor is having her kids <br/>
over the same as having their neighborhood friends over. I use this analogy <br/>
for her all the time. *We have dessert almost every night, most nights it is <br/>
a handful of cookies, a small bowl of ice-cream or some fruit. (That is the <br/>
neighborhood kids.) Three or four times a year, we go to Kansas City and have <br/>
dinner and dessert at the Cheesecake Factory. (That is her kids.)* Her kids <br/>
are a special treat for my kids, her kids feel the same way about my kids, <br/>
and when they get together, my house shakes! The kids let their hair down, <br/>
the rules about jumping off the bed onto someone are still there. The rules <br/>
about playing in the street are still there, to me nothing has changed, just <br/>
the noise level. To her it is indicative of how things are 24/7 at our home. <br/>
I can, at any time tell my kids that things are getting over the top, and <br/>
they will respect that in an instant. BUT when they are having their special <br/>
treat friends over, I hate to do that. I would send them all to the park, but <br/>
that would involve her letting go of her parental control for too long. I <br/>
would suggest that she and I go to the porch swing if the kids are inside or <br/>
the couch if they are out side, but again that would be too much for her. She <br/>
has to be &quot;on top of the situation at all times&quot; as she calls it. So in the <br/>
end we agree to disagree. She can&#39;t imagine being with her kids as much as I <br/>
am with mine, and I can&#39;t imagine being on top of my kids as she is with <br/>
hers! <br/>
In our family, we all have a healthy respect for each other, Moly and Jack <br/>
know when too much is too much. They wouldn&#39;t want us nit picking at them <br/>
over every little thing, I wouldn&#39;t want to do that to them. They also know <br/>
that there are situations where it is better if Mom or Dad &quot;takes control.&quot; <br/>
Meeting new people, being in a really crowded, unfamiliar area, something <br/>
like that. My kids call it &quot;Mom&#39;s taking charge!&quot; :o)<br/>

for my reply.  It was all so good.  <br/>
<br/>
I loved what you wrote (probably because you had the good sense to <br/>
write what I believe. LOL)  <br/>
<br/>
I have never been able to put my thoughts into words as well as you <br/>
