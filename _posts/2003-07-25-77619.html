<div id="ygrps-yiv-434291217">Still exploring options for my family for next year, and was wondering -<br/>
do any of you find it &quot;necessary&quot; to make money on the side?  If so,<br/>
what are some ways that you do this (part time jobs, selling things on<br/>
ebay, etc.)<br/>
In order for me to stay home and for us to maintain our &quot;standard of<br/>
living&quot; which is not ridiculously high, but higher than some, I would<br/>
need to bring in approximately $850 per month.  At least for a few<br/>
months until dh gets his well-earned promotion or we move to get a<br/>
different job for him.  Not to say that I am not willing to cut way<br/>
back, just exploring options.<br/>
I have several ideas, but am looking for any creative solutions anybody<br/>
has found.<br/>

Thanks, actually this is high on my list of ideas.  I actually am<br/>
currently a teacher (algebra and pre-algebra) so I have a wide customer<br/>
base of people who would use/refer me for tutoring, math or otherwise.<br/>
I&#39;ve done tons of tutoring in the past too, and there is a local &quot;tutor<br/>
club&quot; that does afterschool tutoring that usually hires at the beginning<br/>
of the school years.<br/>
I also do freelance editing and proofreading (used to do it<br/>
professionally with a website before I started teaching full time) but<br/>
it takes awhile to build back up a customer base.<br/>
My ultimate plan is to write.  But I haven&#39;t gotten up the nerve to send<br/>
anything to anybody yet, lol.<br/>
Ok, I know that was a little too much information.  But thanks for the<br/>
idea!<br/>

Very good idea - we are near a state university and my husband is a<br/>
counselor at the local junior college so I have access to many students.<br/>
I&#39;m feeling better already!<br/>
Now, to get out of that pesky contract...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007873069">Hi Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
One thing that Laurie and I do, is to stop at the library and <br/>
Goodwill and buy books for almost nothing and sell them on half.com. <br/>
Our best yet was me finding a set of Arabian Nights at the library <br/>
for a dollar. I resold them for two hundred dollars. Last week, I <br/>
found a book for a dime and sold it for $12. Fiction is too <br/>
plentiful, so you won&#39;t make much on those. Textbooks right now are <br/>
starting to sell really well. We&#39;ve sold most of our old textbooks <br/>
for the same price we paid for them, but we buy them for a quarter at <br/>
the library and resell all the time.  For instance, if we had waited <br/>
on the Arabian Nights, there&#39;s a set just like it now for $350. At <br/>
the time, $200 was a decent deal (two months ago).  <br/>
<br/>
Be honest about the condition and value of the book. Package them <br/>
well to mail them, and your reputation at half.com will be set. :-)<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641918076">Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
Im not sure how long term you are looking for but here is what I did for a <br/>
couple years.<br/>
<br/>
I opened a .com.<br/>
Pick a name (free),buy your name (29-39.00) , register with the state (if you <br/>
have to)<br/>
Select a couple products you like and call the manufacturer and give them <br/>
your tax Id #. Some use ss #but the state will give u one.<br/>
Open a .com that allows you to upload your own Jpg photo&#39;s (29.-59.00)<br/>
The biggest expense is credit cards, Paypal is good or money orders.<br/>
Your income potential could be a couple hundred to several thousand a month. <br/>
(If you choose this route I can offer suggestions on what I did right and <br/>
wrong in the end)<br/>
OR<br/>
You could buy stuff at yard sales and places like Gap outlet and resell on <br/>
ebay that&#39;s the less stress way and no phone calls.<br/>

Dacyczyn&#39;s book, &quot;The Complete Tightwad Gazette.&quot;  It has so many great ideas <br/>
on how to save money if you can make a few lifestyle changes it&#39;ll be like <br/>
you&#39;re earning a paycheck.<br/>
