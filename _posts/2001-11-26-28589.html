<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911460191">&lt;&lt;wouldn&#39;t the blame for a child&#39;s outbursts belong to the child alone?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends.  By and large, children have less freedom to live their<br/>
lives as they choose than adults do.  My 3yo sometimes HAS to run errands<br/>
with me whether he wants to or not because there is no one to leave him<br/>
with.  He has a very serious medical condition and HAS to be forced into<br/>
medical procedures at times.  He is frustrated, has little understanding of<br/>
the need to endure pain to keep from getting sick, and has limited options<br/>
in his behavior.  If he has a fit because he had to go with me to the<br/>
grocery store, I cut him some slack.<br/>
<br/>
If dh threw a fit, it would be different.  He doesn&#39;t have to go with me if<br/>
he doesn&#39;t want, he is basically free to live his life exactly how he<br/>
chooses.  Major difference.<br/>
