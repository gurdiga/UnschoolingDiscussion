<div id="ygrps-yiv-465771682">Lisa, I want you to know you&#39;re not alone.  I struggle with my own issues<br/>
daily.  Luckily, I&#39;m at a place where I can recognize the voice in my head<br/>
(the one telling me to limit, create rules, become dictator, or knee-jerk<br/>
respond) as one I don&#39;t necessarily want to listen to.  The voice remains<br/>
there, I can choose to turn down the volume, however &lt;bg&gt;  Even sometimes as<br/>
that voice does sneak out of my mouth, I tell the kids &quot;that&#39;s MY issue, not<br/>
yours, don&#39;t worry about what I just said, here is how we&#39;re gonna handle<br/>
this: ________&quot;  Most of the time, I have to make up, right there on the<br/>
spot, how it is we&#39;re gonna handle the situation without a voice telling me<br/>
what&#39;s right.  Sometimes, and more often now, I hear a replay of the<br/>
Peaceful Parenting tape I picked up at the conference (Richard telling me to<br/>
return to breathing and Sandra telling me not to choose until my brain has<br/>
given me more than ONE choice).  You can create peace for yourself in the<br/>
midst of your chaotic moment ~ go to the corner and breathe, breathe in the<br/>
JOY you&#39;re giving your children and breathe out your self-judgement.  The<br/>
more you practice, the better you&#39;ll get.  You must have a peaceful, quiet<br/>
place within YOURSELF to return to in order to refill your *tank* so you can<br/>
share peace with your family.  Hold a family meeting when everyone is happy<br/>
and getting along, set up time for you to get your needs met (request some<br/>
time during the day as *quiet time* let the kids fill you in on which times<br/>
won&#39;t work because of favorite show conflicts ~ their needs treated as<br/>
important and yours will be too).  We&#39;ve been listening to the tape together<br/>
in the car... we&#39;ve had great talks about taking *time out* when we&#39;re<br/>
angry, about practicing what&#39;s important to us, the importance of breathing.<br/>
Not because they were forced to listen, but because it was there and it was<br/>
interesting and it applied to where we are right now.<br/>
I was also blessed with a copy of &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind&quot; which is an<br/>
amazing insight into beginning the journey toward peace. It&#39;s a little book<br/>
with great points, perfect to pick up when you&#39;re in need of calm but not<br/>
calm enough to focus on breathing (the 35 seconds you have before you say<br/>
something really horrible, run to the corner and open it anywhere and read).<br/>
The nominal cost of the tape (check out Sandra&#39;s website for it) and the<br/>
trip to the library/used book store to get the book are well worth the<br/>
investment into yourself and your family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-353438991">first of all, thank you so much for your kind words.  it means the world<br/>
to me that you&#39;ve taken the time to voice all of this and reassure me. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The voice remains<br/>
&gt;there, I can choose to turn down the volume, however &lt;bg&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i guess i just need to locate my volume knob? ;)  i seem to have a<br/>
constant stream in my head about how stupid i am and how nothing i ever<br/>
do is right, it&#39;d be nice to tun that down to an inaudible level.  i know<br/>
a lot of my problems stem from my belief that everything undesirable my<br/>
kids do is a direct result of me being a bad parent.  that&#39;s a huge load<br/>
of crap.  i do need to take responsibility for my own reactions and<br/>
choices, but my children should be allowed to make mistakes without me<br/>
freaking out.  even if it comes out in other ways, i&#39;m still somehow<br/>
punishing them by not feeling confident.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Even sometimes as<br/>
&gt;that voice does sneak out of my mouth, I tell the kids &quot;that&#39;s &gt;MY<br/>
 </span></blockquote>issue, not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;yours, don&#39;t worry about what I just said, here is how we&#39;re &gt;gonna<br/>
 </span></blockquote>handle<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;this: ________&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s often hard for me to recognize where i&#39;ve gone astray until i&#39;ve<br/>
gone too far.  it truly is a complete reprogramming of my responses.  and<br/>
i need to work harder on not beating myself up so much for making<br/>
mistakes.  i can do better.  it&#39;s important to me to give my kids the<br/>
gift of a conscious loving mother. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You must have a peaceful, quiet<br/>
&gt;place within YOURSELF to return to in order to refill your &gt;*tank* so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you can<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;share peace with your family.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is the hardest part for me.  i need to start with myself and let the<br/>
rest follow instead of thinking that telling my kids they can watch as<br/>
much tv as they want will solve anything.  i completely missed the point<br/>
in changing things around.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hold a family meeting when everyone is happy<br/>
&gt;and getting along, set up time for you to get your needs met &gt;&gt;(request<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;time during the day as *quiet time* let the kids fill you in &gt;on which<br/>
 </span></blockquote>times<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;won&#39;t work because of favorite show conflicts ~ their needs &gt;treated as<br/>
&gt;important and yours will be too). <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i like this idea.  but i&#39;m worried that it will be ill received.  i must<br/>
have a hard time communicating my feelings in an effective way.  no one<br/>
seems to want to sit and talk together unless it happens to be their<br/>
idea.  maybe when we&#39;re in the car together, it could more organically<br/>
happen.  i just want to avoid the scenario of *mommy&#39;s having a problem<br/>
with something so you need to change your life to accommodate her.* <br/>
actually, now that i try to articulate it, i can&#39;t find words for what<br/>
the problem is.  i want them to respect me as much as i respect them<br/>
because we&#39;re a family and we can work together.  i guess i just don&#39;t<br/>
want to dominate anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I was also blessed with a copy of &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind&quot; &gt;which is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>an<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;amazing insight into beginning the journey toward peace. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that sounds wonderfully soothing. soothing sounds good.  i&#39;ll look it up<br/>
at the library for sure. :)  thanks for the recommendation!<br/>
<br/>
just writing all of this helps me clarify a little more what my issues<br/>
are.  that&#39;s the first step in figuring out how to deal with them, i<br/>
guess. :)<br/>
<br/>
thanks again,<br/>
lisa<br/>
