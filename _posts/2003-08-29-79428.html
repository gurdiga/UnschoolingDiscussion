<div id="ygrps-yiv-88784905">I am trying to find an article I received a while back about the real cost of <br/>
two incomes to the family. A woman I know is being pressured to go back to <br/>
work by her partner, and I thought it might help them work it out. <br/>
Your help is appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82488781">The Tightwad Gazzette book had a good section on this.  And there was a book <br/>
called something like &quot;Two incomes and still broke.&quot;  Both were really helpful <br/>
to me.  But mainly it&#39;s been an adjustment from consumerism to living a calm <br/>
life.<br/>
