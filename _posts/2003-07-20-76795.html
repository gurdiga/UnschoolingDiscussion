<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476862586">Corrected:<br/>
<br/>
I had a dragging problem when I was young.<br/>
<br/>
I was dragged to church on Sunday morning.<br/>
<br/>
I was dragged to church for wedding and funerals.<br/>
<br/>
I was dragged to family reunions no matter the weather.<br/>
<br/>
I was dragged to the bus stop to go to school every weekday.<br/>
<br/>
I was dragged by my ears when I was disrespectful to adults and teachers.<br/>
<br/>
I was also dragged to the woodshed when I disobeyed my parents.<br/>
<br/>
Those draggings are still in my veins; and they affect my behavior in <br/>
everything I do, say, and think. And that&#39;s why I am an old fart and hate <br/>
everyone.<br/>
