<div id="ygrps-yiv-475461897">I just wanted to alert everyone that I seem to have a virus. My virus scan has quarantined this but I keep getting messages that I supposedly sent people with the &quot;could not send message&quot; or user does not accept attachments.<br/>
<br/>
In any case - to be safe please don&#39;t open mail from my address - I assume these messages must have an attachment to them - just don&#39;t  want to infect anyone!<br/>

  &gt; Do you mean &quot;Lack of consensus does not imply a lack of toleration?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  That is what I meant.<br/>
<br/>
  To predicate means to involve as a connotation; to imply; as, grass <br/>
  predicates greenness.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;Are you seeing intolerance because there is<br/>
  &gt; disagreement?<br/>
<br/>
  Not at all.<br/>
