&gt; kids, think they are so beautiful, and rave about them--they are trying <br/>
&gt; to prove to themselves that they are not racist but I see right through <br/>
&gt; them. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When people tell me Holly&#39;s cute and nice, I never wonder about their <br/>
&gt; motivations or beliefs.  I assume they think she&#39;s cute.   She&#39;s been <br/>
&gt; hanging <br/>
&gt; out a lot with Ramona King&#39;s family.  All of them are African American, and <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BOTH parents say Holly is great at their house, very helpful, good kid, <br/>
&gt; funny, smart.  Are they somehow being racist?  When Tam is here and I brag <br/>
&gt; HER up for getting Holly  more involved in art and music, am I being racist <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and Ramona can tell?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IF every contact is racist, I don&#39;t know what we can do but avoid contact.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That would be nuts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think trusting people until they prove untrustworthy is better than any <br/>
&gt; other considerations.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there&#39;s a difference. <br/>
I have a cute kid, and people comment on it all the time. I suspect there&#39;s a <br/>
different tone to the compliments one gets sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
As a lesbian family, when meeting new people, often people will volunteer <br/>
that THEY know a gay or lesbian person, or share that THEY believe &quot;All love <br/>
is good, and I always tell my kids that.&quot; I got that from a few people at the <br/>
conference in SC. It&#39;s not a BAD thing, and I know they meant well. <br/>
HOWEVER....<br/>
<br/>
One result is that I, and my family, are automatically separate, and <br/>
different. Most of me just accepts the good intentions of people, smiles, and <br/>
moves on, just a bit unconfortably. Part of me wants to ask them if they&#39;re <br/>
walking their talk, and fighting for the rights of gay people to marry in SC, <br/>
or wherever. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people share in a different way, though, which lets you know <br/>
they&#39;re on board, and that FEELS different. I imagine there&#39;s quite a <br/>
difference between the casual &quot;Oh, your child is so cute,&quot; that most of us <br/>
get, and a gushing OTHERNESS. <br/>

kids and say things like, &quot;Mixed kids are ALWAYS so beautiful.&quot;  And while on<br/>
the surface that sounds a bit better than what one mom told me once when her<br/>
daughter was dating a black schoolmate, &quot;You can&#39;t mix a skunk with a<br/>
raccoon.&quot; (as if interracial dating was inter species dating), it is still the<br/>
same &quot;Otherness&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s normal to feel a bit uncomfortable around folks who are not <br/>
&quot;like&quot; you. I&#39;ve felt welcomed, but different and not &quot;part of the group&quot; at <br/>
gay parties (how CAN I be?). Most of the public schools in our area are 99% <br/>
black--including teachers (who&#39;s the minority there?). My friend Hugh <br/>
McGlinchy lived in Japan for a few years--it&#39;s an understatement that he <br/>
stuck out---he&#39;s a 6&#39;8&quot; red-headed Scot! &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I think comments like &quot;I have friends that are...&quot; is often a way the speaker <br/>
uses to make the &quot;outsider&quot; more comfortable---but it often fails. It&#39;s an <br/>
attempt. Maybe they don&#39;t have the experience to say something <br/>
more....appropriate. That&#39;s the best they can come up with at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Cute children are cute children. I doubt ugly children get that comment. <br/>
Duncan&#39;s friend Lizzie was adopted from China by a lesbian couple (illegally <br/>
in SC , BTW). She is absolutely beautiful (and a pistol! &lt;g&gt;) and is told <br/>
very often how cute/lovely/beautiful she is. She&#39;s adopted; she&#39;s chinese; <br/>
and she&#39;s got two mothers. Three strikes. Good thing she&#39;s a pistol! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
She&#39;s also one of the luckiest children in the whole world! (well, she might <br/>
be luckier if I could convince Rebecca to unschool! &lt;beg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Prejudice is out there. And we could ALL be the recipient at some time. It <br/>
WON&#39;T go away, but we can help our own children see what&#39;s important about <br/>
differences and similarities. And what&#39;s not.<br/>

It&#39;s not swept under the rug. <br/>
It&#39;s just not going to become the main topic of this list.<br/>

Yahoogroups are free and easy to set up.  If you set one up to discuss that, <br/>

Only because at work, there is this very Southern Belle type woman (a <br/>
stereotype that has some truth to it) that I know has some racist feelings <br/>
due to comments she&#39;s made.<br/>
She&#39;s very, very syrupy and fake, I&#39;ve caught her lying to me while being <br/>
super sweet....gag.<br/>
Any obviously not white children get the MOST gushy response from her, as <br/>
though she&#39;s trying to convince herself.<br/>
It&#39;s bizarre, but it&#39;s made me aware of what you described above.<br/>
Growing up in a racially mixed family sheltered me from a lot of realities <br/>
that I&#39;ve had to face since leaving home, especially here in the South.<br/>

&lt;&lt; People fumbling all over themselves, gushing, &quot;some of my best friends<br/>
 are....&quot;, you know.  It really is different.  The radar goes way up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is different than anyone that gushes over your kids.<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are many moments that are going to make you wonder....but I <br/>
still thinks it&#39;s best to not assume some kind of prejudice unless it&#39;s <br/>
obvious.<br/>
I do understand the gushy thing, because of the lady I see at work that I <br/>
mentioned in a previous post. But in this life, assuming good will is far <br/>
better than other choices.<br/>
I hate to think that every mixed race parent that I say how cute their child <br/>
is, makes me out to be some suspect that has hang ups.<br/>
I say that to a LOT of kids, because I really think they are cute. White, <br/>
Black, Asian....it matters not one whit to me.<br/>
It just makes me think maybe y&#39;all would prefer us to not ever say anything <br/>
nice about your child?  I will just continue to be myself. I like children, I <br/>
think lots of them are cute, and I&#39;m not going to be afraid that someone <br/>
thinks I&#39;m trying to cover some racial feelings by saying their child is <br/>
pretty.<br/>
Mixed race is such a catch phrase too. Anglo people are usually a LOT of <br/>
races....so it all just seems so silly to me.<br/>
But I grew up rather sheltered from racism.<br/>
