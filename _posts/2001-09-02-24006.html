<div id="ygrps-yiv-9647696">Hi Guys:<br/>
<br/>
I need some suggestions.... I would like to get Zak (who just turned 6) <br/>
involved with some kind of volunteering that we could do together.  This is a <br/>
mother/child thing rather than an unschooling thing (although I&#39;m sure it <br/>
comes under that heading).  Zachary has an easy life compared to others and I <br/>
would like him to be exposed to helping other people.  Has anyone suggestions <br/>
of activiites or places they have been involved with, with their children?<br/>

<br/>
My son Matt helps me distribute food at our parish food locker one <br/>
afternoon a week.  We help everyone who comes to our locker -- <br/>
homeless, families in need, seniors on fixed incomes, etc.  He&#39;s 11 <br/>
yo now and has been doing this for the last three years.  <br/>
<br/>
We live across the street from the church and are also on call for <br/>
emergency food distribution in the evenings and weekends.  My older <br/>
son (16 yo) also helps me with these calls.  Both boys (and even some <br/>
of their friends) help load and unload food donations.<br/>
<br/>
Last May we received a huge donation of food from the local post <br/>
office food drive.  Matt joined twelve of our women to help sort and <br/>
shelf the food.  Now he has several new &#39;extra grandma&#39;s&#39; :)  <br/>

walking dogs and &quot;socializing&quot; cats. Our homeschool group also created a<br/>
community service project to clean up and restore an area of beach near<br/>
us, and is spending one morning a month pulling weeds, replanting, and<br/>
picking up trash. Cacie also started volunteering at a historic farm when<br/>
she was 8 (without me), doing various farm chores, including gathering<br/>
eggs, walking goats and sheep, harvesting potatoes, mucking out<br/>
paddocks... all of which she loves.<br/>
<br/>
I would start by looking at what your son is interested in, and go from<br/>
there. We&#39;re now temporarily living in your area code,  so maybe we can<br/>
share ideas... I had thought of checking with the zoo here, or maybe the<br/>
desert museum or the animal chelter, because Cacie loves animals... she&#39;s<br/>
been spending a lot of time with her 88 year old grand grandma as we&#39;ve<br/>
all worked to get her moved into a retirement community, and I anticipate<br/>
that we&#39;ll both also be spending time there, helping her adjust and find<br/>
all of the things that are offered there... and maybe we can help out a<br/>
bit there as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275796697">Something that we are going to start doing is making a weekly visit to a <br/>
local retirement home. I really feel this will benefit all parties. My <br/>
children don&#39;t have elderly family members. I personally feel that children <br/>
learning from thier elders is becoming a lost resource. There is so much <br/>
history to learn from the elderly, along with much more. Every single person <br/>
in this world has a life story. I would like my children to learn not from a <br/>
book, but from an actual holocost survivor, WWII vetran, etc. In return my <br/>
children can give these individuals their hearts, love, caring, someone to <br/>
talk to, someone who cares for them. There are elderly people in my <br/>
neighborhood who have no family. They love my children coming around to <br/>
visit. <br/>
<br/>
Another thought that came up when discussing what we were gong to start doing <br/>
with another homeschool mom was doing art sessions at the retirement home <br/>
with the residents and the children together. I&#39;m trying to decide where <br/>
would be best for us to go for our visits.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748878926">I take pictures of animals for the local Humane Society web site, and for the pet<br/>
of the week that goes in the local paper.  While I&#39;m doing that each week, the<br/>
kids play with all the kitties.<br/>
My Mom volunteers once a week, and when she isn&#39;t able to go we do it.  We wash<br/>
food dishes and clean cat boxes.<br/>
There is a worry of liability with these places, so there are strict rules on<br/>
where the kids can go.  My kids are really good at listening and understanding<br/>
why they can just go and play with all the dogs (we have had a bad year for<br/>
rabies around here).<br/>
It sometimes can take two hours to do the washing, and with the kids helping dry<br/>
the dishes and put them away, it cuts off 40 minutes.  That&#39;s nice!<br/>
We have also done meals on wheels.  The kids were younger, and it was just too<br/>
much to get everyone out of car seats at each house and then back in to go to the<br/>
next one.  I was also not really thrilled with the whole idea.  There were<br/>
several people on that route that could have taken care of themselves with<br/>
meals.  One lady even had private nurses.<br/>
We may try soon to do some volunteering with the local wildlife rehab people.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t contacted them yet, but I think we might all enjoy that too.<br/>
Just some thoughts...<br/>

<br/>
So they didn&#39;t want to cook, or their families didn&#39;t want them to have to <br/>
cook, and that offended you? Oh, maybe you thought they were &quot;getting over&quot; <br/>
on someone or taking something they weren&#39;t entitled to? Most meals on wheels <br/>
programs don&#39;t require their clients to be incapable of caring for <br/>
themselves. Most also have a sliding fee scale, with those who can afford <br/>
more paying more. I&#39;m confused by the private nurses comment, though.  ??  <br/>
<br/>
While my grandfather was spending his long time dying our family paid the <br/>
local meals on wheels to deliver to my grandmother on days she called and <br/>
requested, when she just couldn&#39;t face having to cook. Not that she used it <br/>
very much at all. She&#39;d spent her lifetime cooking and to not do it would <br/>
have meant having to deal with just how drastically her life had and was <br/>
going to continue to change. If it&#39;d been up to the rest of us we&#39;d have had <br/>
them there every day though we might have been wrong about that.<br/>
<br/>
Probably just as well you found another avenue to volunteer in.<br/>

come up today. Over the w/e we were looking for a<br/>
kitten. petfinder.org was  the first place I went -<br/>
but the places we contacted on that list would not let<br/>
us adopt because we allow our cat to go in & out on<br/>
her request. My current cat is 10 years old and never<br/>
had a problem. Our cats are always neutered so they<br/>
don&#39;t wonder far. Cars here are usually pretty careful<br/>
as there are lots of creatures (including children)<br/>
in/on the streets - it seems to me that if these pets<br/>
really need homes they should have a better reason<br/>
than that not to adopt them out.  (Although my niece<br/>
works at a shelter and says it is even worse there. <br/>
Not only will they not adopt to people who have in and<br/>
out pets, but you have to have had a pet before so<br/>
that they can call your vet for a reference!)  All<br/>
worked out well though - we got an adorable, fuzzy,<br/>
little black & white kitten (just not from petfinder!)<br/>
