Cocoa Mulch, which is sold by Home Depot, Foreman&#39;s Garden Supply and other Garden supply stores, contains a lethal ingredient called &quot;Theobromine&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It is lethal to dogs and cats.  It smells like chocolate and it really attracts dogs. They will ingest this stuff and die.  Several deaths already occurred in the last 2-3 weeks.  Just a word of caution -- check what you are using in your gardens and be aware of what your gardeners are using in your gardens.  <br/>
<br/>
Theobromine is the ingredient that is used to make all chocolate -- especially dark or baker&#39;s chocolate -- which is toxic to dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Cacao bean shells contain potentially toxic quantities of theobromine, a xanthine compound similar in effects to caffeine and theophylline. A dog that ingested a lethal quantity of garden mulch made from cacao bean shells developed severe convulsions and died 17 hours later. Analysis of the stomach contents and the ingested cacao bean shells revealed the presence of lethal amounts of theobromine.<br/>

My dh who works for Home Depot brought home some mulch so I read it <br/>
and it does have Theobromine in it.This is pretty nasty stuff so do <br/>
keep your pets away from it(if you can,I know how pets can be).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it is true, not an urban legend, from what i could find.<br/>
<br/>
my favorite urban legend site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/">http://www.snopes.com/</a> didn&#39;t have anything <br/>
with the words &quot;cocoa mulch&quot; or Theobromine.  however, those words typed <br/>
into www.google.com brought me to several sites including another urban <br/>
legend check site that i didn&#39;t know about before (hoaxinfo.com).<br/>
<br/>
if you want more details, check these out:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hoaxinfo.com/chocolate.htm">http://hoaxinfo.com/chocolate.htm</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ceinfo.unh.edu/Common/Documents/protpois.htm">http://ceinfo.unh.edu/Common/Documents/protpois.htm</a> (UNH Cooperative <br/>
Extension) had this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We called the national Animal Poison Control Center in search of more <br/>
&gt;information, not only about cocoa mulch, but about preventing pet <br/>
&gt;poisoning in general, and talked with Dr. Michael Knight, the Center&#39;s <br/>
&gt;medical director.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Knight said all parts of the cocoa plant contain a compound called <br/>
&gt;theobromine, a central nervous system and cardiovascular stimulant. &quot;There <br/>
&gt;are no hard numbers on just how much of the substance might be in a given <br/>
&gt;batch of cocoa shell mulch, but the caller&#39;s dog was exhibiting symptoms <br/>
&gt;consistent with theobromine poisoning - restlessness, panting, pacing, <br/>
&gt;anxious behavior.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other sites included some by animal rescue organizations, and one site i <br/>
scanned had a case report of a dog who was poisoned by eating cocoa <br/>
mulch.  all agreed that it&#39;s a danger.<br/>

<br/>
p.s. this was really cool in a weird way.  normally when i get email saying <br/>
&quot;i&#39;m not sure if this is true&quot; and i search the urban legend sites, i find <br/>
that indeed it isn&#39;t true.  :-)</div>
