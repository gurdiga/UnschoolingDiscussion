<div id="ygrps-yiv-720166091">We&#39;re in Florida, so we&#39;re not playing in the snow.  It was 39 degrees when I got up this morning so I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised to see snow!  My feet are freezing on this tile floor - sorry northerners, I&#39;m sure you all are a lot colder.<br/>
<br/>
Question:  Has anyone ever felt sick to their stomachs trying to figure out algebra problems?  I have, today.  David brought home a CD from a computer show last weekend and I thought I&#39;d sit down and &quot;play&quot; with it today.  I haven&#39;t felt this stupid for a while - and the cover says for ages 10 and up!  I did get the right answers eventually, but wow, it has been a while and Mama&#39;s math is rusty.<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think?  Is it just my feeble brain?  Am I just out of practice?  Math never was my best subject, but I can figure lots of stuff in my head at the drop of a hat.  Maybe, the truth is I don&#39;t really care about math and if I did, I&#39;d enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
Give me a good book with lots of words and day  :)  LOLOLOL<br/>
<br/>
Anybody have any math stories???????????<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212158708">I wish we were playing in the snow! No snow here, about 35 miles North of<br/>
Seattle. It does look like it might clear up a bit, and it&#39;s not raining, so<br/>
we might go play in the garden beds later!<br/>
<br/>
Any gardeners getting the itch?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461544032">Well, since we are NC, we have lots of growing time.  I haven&#39;t grown from<br/>
seed, since I can never find the time.  Last year we were doing an addition,<br/>
and renovations, so gardening was nil.  THis year I&#39;m concentrating on<br/>
landscaping all around.  I really enjoy it.<br/>
The kids do some, but they are still very young.  We are going to try a<br/>
sunflower house this year.  That should be fun.<br/>

I would think my berries were having an identity crisis if if weren&#39;t for<br/>

<br/>
Hey, you&#39;re not in school and there&#39;s no time limit or teacher standing over<br/>
your desk with a red pen. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I feel that way sometimes though lately when I&#39;m doing fractions with my 11<br/>
yo. He zips right past me and I&#39;m still sitting there trying to remember the<br/>
algorithms I was taught so long ago. He hasn&#39;t been taught any algorithms. I<br/>
think that&#39;s why he&#39;s faster than me. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
This gives me a chance to plug one of my favorite algebra resources<br/>
though...   &quot;The Algebra Survival Kit&quot; by Josh Rappaport. He sends out a<br/>
free email newsletter every month which you might enjoy. His website is:<br/>

Your kidlets are older than  mine! Nicholas, age 9, is planning on potatoes<br/>
with bachelor&#39;s buttons in between this year. He was a stickler on that.<br/>
Emily, age 4, has a few different things planned, but they are so excited.<br/>
:-) We have bought mostly Territorial, Johnny&#39;s, and Seeds of Change in the<br/>
past, but we are going exclusively with Seeds of Change, except for a couple<br/>
of things.... also, I just heard that Ferry Morse has a new line of strictly<br/>
open pollinated seeds. I think the website was FerryMorse.com.  not sure.<br/>

Your kidlets are older than  mine! Nicholas, age 9, is planning on potatoes<br/>
with bachelor&#39;s buttons in between this year. He was a stickler on that.<br/>
Emily, age 4, has a few different things planned, but they are so excited.<br/>
:-) We have bought mostly Territorial, Johnny&#39;s, and Seeds of Change in the<br/>
past, but we are going exclusively with Seeds of Change, except for a couple<br/>
of things.... also, I just heard that Ferry Morse has a new line of strictly<br/>
open pollinated seeds. I think the website was FerryMorse.com.  not sure.<br/>
Think I&#39;ll go check it out now......<br/>

We&#39;re gardening nuts here too.  I have a million seed catelogs but finally<br/>
found a couple that guarantee no genetic engineering and all organic!  Now,<br/>
I am waiting for the Brinks truck so I can order everything I want!  We&#39;re<br/>
still pulling carrots and cutting broccoli and cauliflower out of the<br/>
garden and my dumb, and I mean DUMB raspberries decided that they weren&#39;t<br/>
going quite dormant this year so I have about a half dozen raspberries to<br/>
pick (well, o.k., so I mean eat on the way into or out of the garden &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets each have their own garden section.  The 16 yo is a flower nut<br/>
and has all kinds of different flowers in his garden.  The 12 yo loves<br/>
beans, carrots and sunflowers in his.  He grows all kinds of different<br/>
beans and some I haven&#39;t the foggiest idea where he got them!  Youngest<br/>
kidlet is into strawberries and peas and whatever catches her fancy in the<br/>
books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113292272">We have been shoveling ...an hour and a half last night--we had at least 9&quot;<br/>
of snow yesterday, and it&#39;s still snowing--an additional 6&quot; this morning.<br/>
Got stuck in driveway yesterday afternoon--slid on top of a rock! Doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be any damage though...  Kids are playing playing playing (me, too)<br/>

&gt; I wish we were playing in the snow! No snow here, about 35 miles North of<br/>
&gt; Seattle. It does look like it might clear up a bit, and it&#39;s not raining,<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; we might go play in the garden beds later!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any gardeners getting the itch?<br/>

&lt;&lt; I would think my berries were having an identity crisis if if weren&#39;t for<br/>
 the fact that my trumpet fuschia are blooming and the hummingbirds haven&#39;t<br/>
 migrated.  I think we are in for a warm dry spell up here!  Dry for us,<br/>
 that is. &gt;&gt;<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed some spring-like things here (Eastern Iowa) as well.  For <br/>
instance, there have been flocks of geese flying back north for about a month <br/>
now.  That&#39;s really early!  Also, my crocuses are starting to nudge their way <br/>
up around my mailbox.  That&#39;s unheard of in the middle of an Iowa January.<br/>
