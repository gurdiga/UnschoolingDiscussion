<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122040533">I never even signed up for the Flymail.  TOO much!  Finally, I went out and <br/>
bought her book.  I love it.  No emails, and no trying to find the right <br/>
page on her website.  I can take what I like and leave the rest.  She really <br/>
does have some great ideas, though!<br/>

Jennifer, who never did get that shoe thing.  I never wear shoes unless I&#39;m <br/>
going to get kicked out of a place! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

LOL when I first found flylady, I did everything to the last letter, <br/>
every time it came up on my email! LOL Now I&#39;ve mellowed out. I still <br/>
shine my sink...about five times per week. And the laundry thing. One <br/>
a day does it, but on Saturdays I get caught up all the way, doing <br/>
four or five loads, and take the day off on Sundays, most weeks. <br/>
There&#39;s a comfortable level of clutter in the place, that easily <br/>
comes together to Having Someone Over If They Don&#39;t Peer Too Closely <br/>
in a half hour, and really deep, Company Party Feast Clean, in about <br/>
three hours. I&#39;m happy with it. I did go nuts at first, though, I <br/>
must admit! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Besides the laundry and shiny sink, the idea of doing things for 15 <br/>
minutes and then taking a break. That&#39;s a good idea. Spurts.<br/>

  Flylady saved my house. Seriously. A mountain was swallowing it up, <br/>
  sucking it down into the bowels of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
  Laundry. Her hint of doing one load of laundry every day SAVED my <br/>
  house.<br/>
<br/>
  Look up flylady. Good stuff.<br/>

  &gt; I realize this is long, but I just wanted to give you a taste of my <br/>
  short <br/>
  &gt; morning.  I&#39;ve had plenty of time to pursue my interests but I do <br/>
  it in <br/>
  &gt; spurts.  I also clean and do just about everything else in spurts.  <br/>
  If I <br/>
  &gt; didn&#39;t plan ahead it would take me 2 hours to get the kids dressed <br/>
  and ready <br/>
  &gt; to go.  Instead,I spend about 15 minutes after they head to bed to <br/>
  find <br/>
  &gt; everything we will need for the next day.  I HIGHLY recommend <br/>
  FlyLady to <br/>
  &gt; help you get organized.  It&#39;s for your home, but somehow it clears <br/>
  up your <br/>
  &gt; head, too!<br/>
