that miss out by working so much... I<br>can&#39;t imaging it any more.&nbsp; Not 
after I have experienced the difference in<br>the depth of my connection to 
them.&nbsp; In an ideal world I think both parents<br>should have the privledge 
of experiencing this closeness with their<br>children.&lt;</font></div>

<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I think that my children have learned 
so much this year by having Dad home. (DH was injured in an accident) With DH 
home, we have had more time to travel and not worry about time constraints. It 
also serves as a buffer when I need down time. I know that DH has loved the time 
he has spent with the children, and none of us looks forward to the day that he 
returns to the office. :( It is so great to have him here, and he has learned 
things about the children that I do not think he would if he were going to the 
office at 6:30am.</font></div>
