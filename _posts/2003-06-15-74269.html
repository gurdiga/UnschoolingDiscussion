<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826776187">I think it was Myranda who asked for advice on finding homes for stray <br/>
puppies.   <br/>
<br/>
Here is what I would do.    Start looking for a reputable animal rescue <br/>
organization in your area.  The Humane Society is good, BUT, they often get <br/>
overloaded with animals and it becomes difficult for them to place them all.  <br/>
Sometimes, you have to get on a waiting list for the Humane Society to take the <br/>
animal.  Often, there are other, privately ran, non-profit animal rescue groups <br/>
that can take the puppies.   Usually, these groups have several foster families <br/>
who care for animals until they are placed.  You may be able to foster the <br/>
puppies yourself until they are placed.. Or, if that is not an option, they will <br/>
place them with a family who is equipped to foster them.   Rescue groups <br/>
typically have the animals vaccinated, and have them sterilized.   If an animal is <br/>
sick, they nurse it back to health before they place it.   Usually, there is an <br/>
adoption fee that  helps them cover the cost of care for the animal.    A <br/>
good animal rescue group screens the adoptive familes, and has them sign a <br/>
contract stating that they can reclaim the animal if they find out the contract has <br/>
been broken.    Animal rescue groups place dogs through several avenues.  They <br/>
 may use the &#39;adopt-a-pet&quot; programs at pet supply stores.  Most of them also <br/>
have web sites with thier available animals listed with pictures.   Here is <br/>
the link to the rescue group I have worked with in my area.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Look online, in the yellow pages, and perhaps call local vets for referrals <br/>
for a good local animal rescue group.  Also, you may find some good resources <br/>
in some Yahoo groups.  I was once on an animal rescue group, but now I cant <br/>
remember the name of it.   Anyway, with a little research,  you can probably find <br/>
some folks who can help you out.  <br/>
<br/>
I think most anything is a better alternative to taking them to the pound.   <br/>
The rescue groups I know sometimes rescue animals from the pound if they think <br/>
they have a chance of finding a home for them.    Good luck!  <br/>
