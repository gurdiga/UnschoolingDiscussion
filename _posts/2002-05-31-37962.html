<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132996161">Hi!<br/>
My name is Kelly. Mark and I have a wonderful daughter , Caroline, who is <br/>
16. We are all de-schooling having finally taken Caroline out of PS in <br/>
February. Yes, I know... but we DID&#39;NT know until now. The best thing that <br/>
we ever did was remove her from that poisonous environment. We only wish we <br/>
had done it before and also with her older sister ( now 21).<br/>
I have been following the ADD thread with great interest and could not keep <br/>
out of it. Caroline is dyslexic, add, dyscalculic(?), etcetcetc. Also has a <br/>
very high IQ. You&#39;d never know to meet her that she had any difficulties <br/>
with traditional schoolwork. Except for a few years of elementary school <br/>
when she was with wonderful caring teachers working on the dyslexia, school <br/>
has been a form of torture for all of us - parents, sister, grandparents , <br/>
you name it.  The district , becasue of the obvious difference in <br/>
intelligence and testing abilites, suggested special ed classes - which as I <br/>
said  were great in lower grades. Middle school and high school she was not <br/>
taught much if anything . Mostly learned stuff at home ;-)We should have <br/>
caught on, right?<br/>
<br/>
Now to the point: these learning differences are very real. They do not have <br/>
to become excuses or labels to exist. The strengths and weaknesses occur in <br/>
any setting. Caroline simply cannot add, subtract, multiple or divide <br/>
without the use of a calculator and then she may or may not write the answer <br/>
down correctly: ex. 46 rather than 64. She is,on the other hand, perfectly <br/>
capable of doing geometry and algrbra if allowed the use of the calculator. <br/>
She reads any thing she lays hold of, pretty easily and with great <br/>
comprehension. However, she doesn&#39;t spell well and when she writes ( rather <br/>
than types) her writing is nearly incomprehensible. Allowances do have to be <br/>
made. She handles the stickier situations gracefully now, but when she was <br/>
younger she would become very frustrated and behave quite badly. This was <br/>
true whether she was playing on the weekends or in a classroom setting.<br/>
<br/>
If we hadn&#39;t had this information, she would have thought she was stupid, <br/>
instead of just learning in a different way. We would not have know how to <br/>
help her and may have done her serious harm emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
We do see a big change in her behavior and happiness since February. She is <br/>
looking forward to real life - college and beyond. She tells everyone that <br/>
she homeschools and is on the &quot; accelerated program&quot; so she can go on to <br/>
college in the fall of next year. So far she hasn&#39;t looked a textbook, but <br/>
has read up a storm on her own- worked a zillion hours on the computer on a <br/>
website a friend has- watched a bunch of neat movies.  Personally, I think <br/>
she can go on tomorrow. But then there&#39;s the pesky SAT.  That&#39;s a whole <br/>
nother thread ;-)<br/>
