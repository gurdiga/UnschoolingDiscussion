<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to wonder though how much of this is truly the natural order of<br/>
things. It seems that whenever I&#39;ve traveled to places where people are<br/>
still living the way many of our ancestors did, you see kids being very<br/>
independent and responsible for *so much*. It was interesting in Africa to<br/>
see 6 year old boys out in the field tending herds of goats, and only<br/>
slightly older boys with herds of cattle. And girls of this age are carrying<br/>
around their smaller siblings on their back, or pounding corn, or whatever.<br/>
I think our conception of childhood is largely a modern fabrication. Most<br/>
kids around the world don&#39;t get this amazing 18 year period to just be kids.<br/>
They have big responsbilities at a very young age, and are expected to do a<br/>
large part of the family work as soon as they&#39;re able. In many cultures,<br/>
when a child is weaned they move out into the world of big people. Those<br/>
first 4 - 7 years are all that they get to really *just* be a kid. In some<br/>
cultures if they&#39;re males they never do speak directly to their mothers<br/>
again after they&#39;re weaned.<br/>
<br/>
Now all that being said, I&#39;m not going to enslave my oldest or think he<br/>
ought to grow up too soon or tell him he can&#39;t speak to me. For good or bad,<br/>
we&#39;re living in the culture we are right now, and I value the fact that I<br/>
can give my kids the gift of a childhood that&#39;s relatively free from<br/>
concern. There&#39;s nothing like the day we spent yesterday, glorious sunshine<br/>
and we&#39;re out camping. The kids are playing with their friends in the mud<br/>
and sand and a creek and it&#39;s a school day in the middle of a workweek so<br/>
the campground is empty!<br/>

<br/>
The more complex the culture, the longer childhood needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
In a world in which a child might need to be a personnel manager, a systems <br/>
analyst or a jet pilot, he needs to have a greater range of experience, <br/>
thought, and play than if they&#39;re in a very localized agrarian or animal-based <br/>
culture.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t thin our kids are &quot;just being kids.&quot;  <br/>
I know mine, at 16, 14 and 11 are practicing for personnel management and <br/>
systems analysis!!<br/>
<br/>
Last night and this morning all three have done their part in trying to move <br/>
an orc ball game back up half an hour so Holly and two other homeschooled kids <br/>
can get to a bowling session, AND moving it to a different park (Holly <br/>
realized this part) because orc ball is usually on Sundays, but this week because <br/>
there&#39;s an out of town visitor they want to do it Friday, but Friday there&#39;s a <br/>
homeschooling meeting at that park.  Because the orc-ball crowd is made up of <br/>
mostly  homeschooled kids, if they go where there&#39;s  homeschool get-together, <br/>
they will be seen as homeschoolers doing something fun.  Either they let <br/>
everyone participate (though it&#39;s dangerous and most players are teens, and all the <br/>
players have experience and know the many rules) OR they say no, which won&#39;t <br/>
go over well.   So they&#39;ve contacted everyone necessary for moving it to <br/>
another park.  Holly has made the call she needs to make to say she might not be at <br/>
bowling or might be late.<br/>
<br/>
I helped on the side with logistics they were missing, but the awareness and <br/>
footwork was all theirs.<br/>
<br/>
If kids are given the opportunity to really affect their lives and others, <br/>
the &quot;just&quot; being a kid is also just being human, and they ease into adult <br/>
responsibilities gradually instead of being thrust into adulthood one day on a <br/>
birthday.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it has more to do with economics --even poor people in this <br/>
country have so much more materially than most people around the world. <br/>
The US is probably the only country in the world where poor people are <br/>
obese. Poverty elsewhere is not just scarcity of amenities or income <br/>
but scarcity of food, education and health care. And security as is the <br/>
case of not just most African countries but all the third world. Only <br/>
those with money can afford to pay their own police force (aka security <br/>
guards with real weapons and license to kill).<br/>
<br/>
If you are really poor you learn early on how to not just tend cattle <br/>
but tend to yourself --with food, clothes and plain old hustle. Where <br/>
there is extreme poverty there is rarely childhood beyond the age of <br/>
three.<br/>
