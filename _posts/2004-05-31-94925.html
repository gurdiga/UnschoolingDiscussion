<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883305998">Hi Alll,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you know about the Firemaker Primitive Skills Gathering<br/>
near Sooke, BC Canada this year, July 12-18. There are reduced rates for registering<br/>
before June 15th and cost includes camping and meals. I&#39;ve been going to<br/>
Primitive Skills Gatherings since my children were infants and every single<br/>
one has been wonderful--an incredible learning experience, community sharing<br/>
and safe, fun family event! This year Jean-Claude and I will be facilitating<br/>
several workshops again, including Nonviolent Communication, natural and compassionate parenting, <br/>
and &quot;growing without schooling&quot;, no-till natural farming and paleolithic eating.<br/>
<br/>
You can get details and see the whole program (there are usually last minute<br/>
additions and extras as well) here:<br/>
www.firemaker.org<br/>
I pasted an excerpt below. Every year there are a few homeschoolers at these<br/>
events--I&#39;d love to meet more of you there!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Every summer, the Firemaker Primitive Skills Society hosts Firemaker, a<br/>
gathering for those interested in natural and primitive skills as well as<br/>
the underlying philosophy of those skills and ways of life. At our<br/>
gatherings, we invite instructors to share their skills and love for<br/>
low-tech or no-tech ways of living and enjoying the outdoors. Click here for<br/>
this year&#39;s program and registration info.<br/>
<br/>
Firemaker gatherings are about more than just primitive skills; they&#39;re also<br/>
about friendship, fun, and community. Every evening there is singing,<br/>
drumming, and story telling around the campfire. Group camping, shared meals<br/>
and time to chat with instructors or to share the day&#39;s experiences with new<br/>
or old friends add to the feeling of community, There&#39;s also plenty of room<br/>
for solitude.<br/>
<br/>
Firemaker is an excellent opportunity to:<br/>
<br/>
-Learn to be more aware of the Natural world<br/>
-Make useful and beautiful objects with our hands.<br/>
-Know what, when, and how to gather and use what we gather<br/>
-Develop competence for survival and wilderness living.<br/>
-Connect with each other and our children in a beautiful natural setting.<br/>
-Make music and have fun together.<br/>
-Understand the unity of physical and spiritual.&quot;<br/>
