<div><font color="#000080" size="2">Welcome to the group!&nbsp; I have a 10yo 
daughter and 6yo son.&nbsp; We decided to homeschool when my daughter was in 
second grade - she was in public school and we took her out halfway through the 
year. She had a number of friends, but kept in contact with them.&nbsp; Over 
time, however, she has lost interest in those friends.&nbsp; She feels most of 
them are &quot;sheep,&quot; following along with others to stay popular.&nbsp; Just last 
night we had a conversation about her one remaining friend from school, who had 
always &quot;marched to her own drum&quot; like my daughter. My daughter had a 
conversation with her yesterday on Instant Messaging, and said even that friend 
has become too much like a sheep.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">She enjoys her new friends more - the ones she 
has met at church, the other homeschoolers she meets... she wishes she had more 
friends that live closer to us (our homeschool group is on the other side of 
town), but I do try and make sure she sees friends often. She also calls and 
instant messages them as well.&nbsp; We are fortunate that we found some other 
unschoolers that live close by, as well.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">I also have explained to my daughter that, in 
school, you may attend classes with your friends, but you don&#39;t really &quot;talk&quot; or 
&quot;play&quot; in the middle of class.&nbsp; There&#39;s lunch and recess, but that&#39;s about 
it.&nbsp; We can spend all day with friends if they want to... and our friends 
don&#39;t have to worry about staying home in the evenings to do homework, 
either.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">So, I guess my message is, yes your daughters 
may feel sad that they won&#39;t be spending as much time with their friends at 
school... but hopefully they will soon find friends that they have more in 
common with, and can actually spend more time with, in their &quot;new lifestyle,&quot; 
should you decide to homeschool them.</font></div>

drive the distance when we moved out here to the country, but it has been<br/>
worth it.  He sees one every week for several hours, and the other every<br/>
other week for most of a day.<br/>
<br/>
These are wonderful friends to him, and I like the way they can resolve<br/>
their differences.  They have been friends for over 5 years now.<br/>
