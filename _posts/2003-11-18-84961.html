<div id="ygrps-yiv-30517183">&quot;As someone who lives in Los Angeles, these prices sound like an absolute<br/>
bargain.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Croak!  Sounds similar to Alaska.....<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about Florida averages, Mary B. lives in a higher expense area than we do, but here in the NW of Florida a $200,000 home is very upper end. We payed $64,000 for ours and that is fairly common. Most homes in the average middle income type neighborhoods are between 80 to 120 thousand.<br/>
