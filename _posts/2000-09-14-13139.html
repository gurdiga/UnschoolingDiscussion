&lt;&lt; would it help any if she read into a <br/>
tape recorder?  ... Taping her reading might be <br/>
a fun way to encourage practice while also encouraging her to meet her needs <br/>
independently.  If you try this, be sure and save the first tape to listen to <br/>
somewhere down the road.  Just in case she needs to hear proof that she is <br/>
making progress. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
eiraul-- ty for the suggestions.  this one is intriguing, i especially like <br/>
the part about saving the tape as PROOF and reminder of progress!  so often <br/>
we are looking forward to what is still UN-done, or not-good-enough yet, <br/>
instead of looking back to how FAR we have come!  i am guilty of this daily <br/>
in many areas.  glad for the reminder myself...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487799794">Hey everyone!<br/>
I&#39;m slowly reading to catch up and re-enter the e-list after a short<br/>
e-sabbatical.<br/>
What I did on my sabbatical was get a few of the books from the unschooling<br/>
recommended reading list that I hadn&#39;t read yet.<br/>
If you have read me around here....you may know that I have struggled with<br/>
my eldest 10 yr old in regards to reading.<br/>
Kolleen describes it SO well....even when I tried to &#39;let it go&#39; and thought<br/>
I was unschooling &#39;well&#39;...I wasn&#39;t.  I STILL had my agenda to &quot;get her<br/>
reading.  I moved from overt attempts (before I was truly comfortable with<br/>
unschooling),  to covert attempts.....thinking it would help her.  I finally<br/>
*really* got it....that I was still subtly trying to steer her toward<br/>
reading....I don&#39;t think I was totally consciuos of all that I was<br/>
doing.....and she reacted consiusly at times unconsciously at other<br/>
times....but always resisting.<br/>
    I finally took the focus off of her completely.  I began examining *my*<br/>
thought,  feelings,  and actions.  And *finally* was able to get out of her<br/>
way.  It&#39;s been about 6 months since I&#39;ve let go of MY issues,  agenda,  and<br/>
desires about it.<br/>
    She has recently become comfortable enough to come ask me things about<br/>
words now.  And I&#39;m capable of simply giving her the information.  I have<br/>
worked through my feelings about it and she is healing from all my attempts<br/>
to turn it into a lesson,  or to please, dissappoint,  or try to control me.<br/>
She is making her way along,  though hasn&#39;t had a major breakthrough yet.<br/>
Somehow,  I&#39;m sure she has a better chance now...as she learns she can trust<br/>
me to facilitate,  not push or *teach*.<br/>
    It also helped me to read Holt&#39;s Learning all the Time.  He addresses<br/>
reading....and talks about &#39;immersing youngsters in written language&#39;  from<br/>
the grownup world,  not that dull kid stuff.<br/>
So I&#39;m trying to be creative in how to do this ....like putting &#39;menus&#39; on<br/>
the fridge,  hanging a calendar with activities spelled out clearly and<br/>
legibly,  copying words to songs family members like,  and changing<br/>
&#39;inspirational&#39; quotes I post on the fridge.   Though I&#39;m sure the *key* to<br/>
it all is my having moved past &quot;my problems&quot; about it.<br/>
<br/>
It also helped me to read Holt&#39;s description abput learning math....where dd<br/>
and I have had the &#39;opposite&#39;  experience.  I had a natural inclination to<br/>
simply be interested in her mathematical,  logical processing....and so have<br/>
been a much more capable facilitator......of course,  her confidence in this<br/>
area soars!<br/>
<br/>
Shew1  This turned out long!  Look out....maybe I&#39;m back!  :-)<br/>

&gt;How could you use trickery in regards to reading?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anytime your agenda, hidden or otherwise, superceeds the child&#39;s agenda<br/>
to just learn at their own pace, then you are out of the unschooling<br/>
realm. This may be an option for a parent, but they will get questioned<br/>
on those choices when in an unschooling forum.<br/>
<br/>
When the agenda is hidden, its trickery. And they will catch on. And<br/>
there will be resentment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I recommended a bringing some comic books and magazines but after reading<br/>
&gt;a few of the replies, I realize it is not the unschooling way to take the<br/>
&gt;lead with regard to a resistant reader.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, there are no resistant readers in the unschooling realm.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That being said, why can&#39;t we<br/>
&gt;look at it the same way we would look a feeding a child not thriving.  If<br/>
&gt;I was concerned about my child&#39;s health because he wasn&#39;t interested in<br/>
&gt;eating due to a health problem (here I am comparing the damage from ps to<br/>
&gt;a health problem), wouldn&#39;t I offer a good variety of food to help him?<br/>
&gt;Wouldn&#39;t it be ok in this situation to bring home some fun things to read<br/>
&gt;and let him know what you have?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, its the parent putting their agenda over a child&#39;s natural desire.<br/>
<br/>
Having stuff around the house is a far cry from going to a bookstore and<br/>
spending 3 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn to read because the written word is all around us. And they<br/>
will learn best at their own time, if given the space and trust.<br/>
