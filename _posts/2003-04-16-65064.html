has been diagnosed as being hyperactive, ADD, RAD, as well as just having bad <br/>
behavior...he is very rough, loud, gets &quot;sucked into&quot; anything (good or bad), <br/>
very uncoodinated, kinda clumsy...He was in 9 foster homes (and one failed <br/>
adoption) before he came to us.  He has come SOOOO far in the 2 1/2 years <br/>
he&#39;s been part of our family, but he is still very developmentally <br/>
behind...we call him our &quot;baby&quot; because so much of his actions and behaviors <br/>
are very &quot;toddler like&quot; (he will be 10 years old next month)...he sucks his <br/>
fingers and plays with the tag on his shirt with the other hand, LOVES baby <br/>
toys...I encourage it all....he never got a &quot;babyhood.&quot;  Can&#39;t wait to get <br/>
the addition built on so I&#39;ll have room for a rocking chair! :o)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, we went to his psychologist today, and I told her what I had read, <br/>
and it was like a lightbulb went on in her head (and mine) as she began <br/>
listing things that are common with children with sensory disorders, and <br/>
every single thing she listed described our son to a T.  He is still in <br/>
public school but we will be taking him out at the end of this year (he was a <br/>
foster child, we couldn&#39;t homeschool him at that time, but left him in school <br/>
after the adoption because he wanted to go...he is beginning to be excited <br/>
about homeschooling though.) He has been on (in his life) ritalin, Concerta, <br/>
and Adderall.  But she said, if we do an occupational therapy review, and see <br/>
if sensory deprivation is his condition, no meds will be needed....it is <br/>
pretty much taken care of with occupational therapy.  <br/>

Anyhow, sorry so long, but I just wanted to thank whoever it was who brought <br/>
this up to start with.  It might finally make a big difference.  <br/>

The tags in his shirt might be bothering him.  <br/>
For both me and Holly, I take tags out completely, of underwear and <br/>
especially t-shirts.  The tag is RIGHT there, where nerves are, and it seems <br/>
in a way to disturb the whole intersection of sensation up the spine, from <br/>
the head down, hands and arms to brain...   Busy neuro intersection to have <br/>
some scratchy itchy irritating thing Right There.<br/>
<br/>
Cutting them off sometimes isn&#39;t enough.  Depends on the material it&#39;s made <br/>
of.  Seam ripper taking threads out is what we have to do usually.<br/>
<br/>
Polyester and acrylic can be really uncomfortable too, and wool is right out. <br/>
<br/>
Used cotton seems least problematical. Holly also likes nylon, like swim-suit <br/>
material (lycra/spandex stuff?)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>With our son, I think it is more the silkiness of some tags.  He even has a <br/>
couple of old special shirts he sleeps with,..ones he had before he came here <br/>
that he pulled back out of the goodwill bag...falls asleep with his fingers <br/>
in his mouth and the other hand holding the shirt, rubbing the tag between <br/>
his thumb and fingers.  He also has a stuffed gorilla with a silky tag he <br/>
rubs when he sleeps.  Hard to believe he&#39;s almost 10 years old...I know he <br/>
gets a lot of comfort from these things so I don&#39;t bother him about sucking <br/>
his fingers.  The orthodontist also said it is not affecting his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
We have only had him since he was 7 1/2 years old.  He was extremely <br/>
neglected as a small child, and went into foster care for the first time at 3 <br/>
1/2.  It is too hard for me to fathom all that he went through his first 7 <br/>
1/2 years, but when we got him he was like a caged animal...totally out of <br/>
control.  More than once I had to put him in a basket hold to keep him from <br/>
hurting himself, as he would get mad and bang his head against things, dig <br/>
into his skin, and throw things.  I think the thing that finally, FINALLY got <br/>
him through the storm was when he knew we weren&#39;t going to pack him off to <br/>
someone else, no matter what.  He tested us unbelievably,...my husband <br/>
(ex-marine) finally looked him straight in his eyes, after a major meltdown <br/>
on son&#39;s part, and said, &quot;get it all out, give us all you&#39;ve got, but you&#39;re <br/>
not going anywhere.  You&#39;re stuck with us.&quot;  I guess I am sharing all this <br/>
because I really, REALLY believe unschooling and especially what I am <br/>
learning about peaceful parenting will be wonderful for him.  It has really <br/>
caused me to examine myself everytime I say &quot;No.&quot;   Why?  Why AM I saying no? <br/>
 What&#39;s the point of pointing out that someone has left their shoes <br/>
downstairs for the 20th time?  Who cares?  Why do I care?  LOL...throw them <br/>
up the stairs....And what is so nice, I see such a difference in the kids <br/>
faces when they come to me for a request, and I really take the time to <br/>
explain why it is a good idea or a bad idea, ask them THEIR opinion about <br/>
it...often they answer their own questions.  It&#39;s really cool.<br/>
<br/>
I shared about homeschooling/unschooling with his therapist today also, and <br/>
she thinks it will be the best thing for him...give him a lot of one on one <br/>
time for me to &quot;mother&quot; him...give him a lot he didn&#39;t get as a baby.  <br/>

Wow Nancy, good luck! I hope OT will help unlock some of the secrets <br/>
of your dear little boy. In the meantime, a good sensory diet can <br/>
benefit just about any child. Start keeping an eye on what movements <br/>
he seems to be craving and get him some more of those. The OT will <br/>
ask you all of those questions anyway, so you&#39;ll be ahead of the game.<br/>

<br/>
We also have these things happening at our house.   I&#39;m going to go buy The Out of Sync Child,  the library copies are lost.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering how to handle the lotion thing and for us also, lip balm.   My son hates the feeling of lotions or lip stuff.   He has dry skin and a huge crack in his bottom lip.   I have been just letting it go because he gets so upset.    Any suggestions?    With him he says it doesn&#39;t hurt,  so I leave it alone.     He also hates showers,  will tolerate a bath when I insist.   Which is usually not very often.     I know he&#39;ll grow out of the bathing thing,  but is there anything that could make these things be soothing to him instead of stressful?<br/>

<br/>
The type of lotion makes a big difference. The one we were using <br/>
yesterday was very thick and kind of greasy I think. Cheap sunscreen. <br/>
Casey has no problems at all using my Oil of Olay moisturizer with <br/>
SPF 15. So from now on, it&#39;s just worth it to let her use that on her <br/>
face and neck.<br/>
<br/>
Casey said that for dry skin, using lotions that dry quickly helped <br/>
her get through the sensitivities. She recommends Jergens Soothing <br/>
Aloe Lotion. She says it doesn&#39;t stay on your skin and bother you. (I <br/>
don&#39;t have stock in Jergens or Oil of Olay, I swear!)<br/>

<br/>
I have found that once the skin is damaged, the lotions and balms <br/>
become even more of an issue. When we first moved to bone-dry Utah, <br/>
Casey&#39;s hands were cracked and bleeding. That was tough to get <br/>
through. Do you think the crack will heal on its own once the weather <br/>
warms up? I&#39;d try different fun lip balms after that. Casey was <br/>
always willing to try funky, flavored chapsticks. I also increased <br/>
the amount of good fats in Casey&#39;s diet. More nuts, seeds and good <br/>
oils. That helps from the inside out.<br/>

He even has a couple of old special shirts he sleeps with,..ones he had <br/>

rubbing the tag between his thumb and fingers.  He also has a stuffed <br/>
gorilla with a silky tag he rubs when he sleeps. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Joseph just turned 11 and he still sleeps with a silky stuffed animal he got when he was a baby. He rubs the ears (he says thats the softest part) between his fingers as he goes to sleep. He says rubbing it also helps him concentrate.  You should see this thing now. It&#39;s been repaired many times over the years and there&#39;s not much material left to sew back together!  We were so excited when we found the same ones on ebay so he has a new one, but I notice he still takes the old one with him. ;)<br/>
<br/>
He also goes through various stages of sensory needs. Sometimes bumping walls, or me, or lots of rubbing, or lots of bouncing etc. I let him get whatever sensory input he seems to need.  I just bought a copy of the Out-of-Sync Child a couple weeks ago and am looking forward to getting into it. I&#39;ve been busy preparing for today, Alyssa&#39;s 9th birthday. Tonight it&#39;s a Hogwarts feast with roast beef, yorkshire pudding, roast chicken, chips, rice pudding, chocolate frogs etc. I&#39;m interested to see if there is any indication that OT may be helpful for older kids and some suggestions for additional activities I may be able to suggest to him.<br/>
<br/>
As for the tag thing, all three of my kids are really sensitive to those, as well as extra seams, zippers, buttons etc.  We stick to pretty basic clothes without a bunch of decorative detail, and sometimes I end up washing things 6 or 7 times to soften them up before they&#39;re worn (if they end up being worn at all).<br/>

  Mary,<br/>
<br/>
  We also have these things happening at our house.   I&#39;m going to go buy<br/>
The Out of Sync Child,  the library copies are lost.<br/>
<br/>
  I was wondering how to handle the lotion thing and for us also, lip balm.<br/>
My son hates the feeling of lotions or lip stuff.   He has dry skin and a<br/>
huge crack in his bottom lip.   I have been just letting it go because he<br/>
gets so upset.    Any suggestions?    With him he says it doesn&#39;t hurt,  so<br/>
I leave it alone.     He also hates showers,  will tolerate a bath when I<br/>
insist.   Which is usually not very often.     I know he&#39;ll grow out of the<br/>
bathing thing,  but is there anything that could make these things be<br/>
soothing to him instead of stressful?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

    &gt;&gt; The tags in his shirt might be bothering him.<br/>
    &gt; For both me and Holly, I take tags out completely, of underwear and<br/>
    &gt; especially t-shirts.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Casey hasn&#39;t met a tag yet that she likes. ::RIP:: They&#39;re outta<br/>
    there. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
    Yesterday she got completely thrown off for awhile by the sunscreen.<br/>
    I watched it happening as we applied it to her face. Nothing felt<br/>
    comfortable on her body after that...shoes, coat, shirt. She was<br/>
    right on the verge of a breakdown. I finally convinced her to go to<br/>
    the park anyway and the fresh air and movement made her feel better<br/>
    pretty quickly.<br/>

Brushing is a teqhnique we got when Conor was in OT. It has different <br/>
effects on different kids. The idea is that the brushing helps to <br/>
integrate the senses back to an acceptable (for the child) range. It <br/>
kind of gets all the senses going so one isn&#39;t firing too strongly.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, the brushing is supposed to provide firm pressure as well <br/>
as the brush sensation. It&#39;s not supposed to be a soft, tickly touch. <br/>
The real live sensory brush is just a surgical scrub brush. The kind <br/>
the hospitals use on infants even. It&#39;s very soft. But when you use <br/>
it, you give the child some pressure and then do joint compressions <br/>
afterward. Casey loves it and still asks to be brushed when she&#39;s <br/>
upset. For Conor, it was more of a stimulating experience. We haven&#39;t <br/>
done it for him since he was 9.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be giving an Out of Sync presentation with Anne Ohman at the SC <br/>
conference. Casey and I were planning on demonstrating some of these <br/>
techniques at some point.<br/>
<br/>
BTW if a soft, tickly brush helps someone&#39;s kid, that&#39;s great! I just <br/>
wanted to give the lowdown on the whole &quot;brushing for sensory issues&quot; <br/>
thing. :o)<br/>
