<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359844416">****Drat!  I need to move to some alternate reality where parking is not<br/>

going to be on the &quot;test&quot;.  With my limited parking skills I&#39;m doomed to<br/>

Ok, ok, I&#39;ll do the parking.  I lived and drove in San Francisco for<br/>
years without even so much as one accident.  Parking spaces were (and<br/>
are) hard to come by, but I always managed to find one and parallel park<br/>
just beautifully, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Just let me know where and when, I&#39;ll bring my drivers license and<br/>
handle the valet stuff.<br/>

Because you could park better?<br/>
<br/>
I can parallel park too.  Sometimes others expect you to ALWAYS do it <br/>
perfectly, or sometime they just get resentful that you can and they can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you didn&#39;t lose the friendship about unschooling.  That&#39;s my <br/>
suspicion.  I wonder if we should start warning potential unschoolers that <br/>
they might lose some friends over giving their kids so much freedom.  <br/>
<br/>
And if you didn&#39;t lose your friendship over parking OR unschooling, sorry for <br/>
guessing wrong.<br/>

Oh, I failed my drivers test three times because I couldn&#39;t parallel park<br/>
the LTD I bought for a hundred dollars.  <br/>
I think they only passed me the fourth time to be rid of me. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I park.  I get this wild feeling I can do anything and I park. <br/>
It makes me feel good about myself.<br/>
It&#39;s sad really.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ah, I lost one.   A woman I&#39;d known since I was ten.   A mom.  I miss her<br/>
every day.   I loved her.  But I wouldn&#39;t trade my sons happiness and<br/>
freedom to get her love back.<br/>
<br/>
Caution: may cause relationship irritation.   Flush with Merlot and call<br/>
for help immediately...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t lost any friends outright.  But watching how people treat children <br/>
has made me not associate with some people as much. A year or so ago I was <br/>
feeling quite alone.  Like I was the only one that could see children as <br/>
people with feelings and ideas all their own.  I felt that, other than <br/>
Jackson, I had no one that I could talk to about my boys. The people around <br/>
here seem very much the &quot;children should be seen and not heard&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t speak <br/>
unless you are spoken to&quot; kind.  That was what was so helpful about the <br/>
conference last year.<br/>
<br/>
I found that I was not alone.  Of course that led to this and a couple of <br/>
other E groups.  From the groups I have met a couple of other unschoolers.  <br/>
Although in this area they are a rare breed.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway enough rambling,<br/>
