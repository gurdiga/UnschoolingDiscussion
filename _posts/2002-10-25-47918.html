<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was driving home from a rehearsal tonight and listening to that <br/>
&gt; particular tape.  If someone asked me what I think every brand new parent <br/>
&gt; should receive, I&#39;d have to say a copy of that tape for sure, along with a <br/>
&gt; very, very few other things, namely the Womanly Art of Breastfeeding; a <br/>
&gt; sling in not too fruity a pattern so Dad will use it, too; and the book the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Continuum Concept.  I&#39;m sure there are a couple of more things, but I <br/>
&gt; just can&#39;t think of them right now.  Oh yes, a bottle of lavender essential <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; oil.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A good breast pump. I nursed both for so long, and never had a good pump. <br/>
Until Wednesday evening at karate, I always thought I just couldn&#39;t pump. The <br/>
Karate instructor&#39;s wife was sitting with me and we were chatting away about <br/>
her new baby. (who is the most beautiful baby!) We were talking about how <br/>
long we had nursed our children and I mentioned that the only drawback I ever <br/>
had was I couldn&#39;t be away from the kids for too long, because neither of the <br/>
pumps I had ever worked well. She told me something I never knew. She said <br/>
that the pumps you buy at the store are made by formula companies. I am sure <br/>
all you know that, but I never did. And I am mad! She said if I ever have <br/>
another baby I need to get a pump from a reputable company, and apparently <br/>
they are expensive. But I am just mad, so mad. Do you all see how mad I am? <br/>
Why are formula companies making breast pumps? How fair is that? So many <br/>
women, discouraged at the 1/2 oz. of milk produced after 15 minutes of <br/>
pumping! So many women who just quit out of frustration!  So, if you know a <br/>
woman who is about to have a baby, and she is going to breast-feed her baby, <br/>
help her get a really good pump! Not one of those cheepo Walmart ones! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a great suggestion!  But, it might be wasted on some moms, &#39;cause <br/>
not all breastfeeding moms ever have the need for a pump; I never did in <br/>
five and a half years of nursing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that you had such a crappy experience!  I can imagine how <br/>
absolutely frustrating that must have been.  I know that Medela makes good <br/>
pumps, and they are widely available for rental at drug stores and usually <br/>
from lactation consultants.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I only needed one with my first, who was 2 months early.  But the electric<br/>
ones then cost a fortune, and the manual ones were just awful.  I quickly<br/>
learned how to express manually.  She got mostly breast milk until she came<br/>
home from the hospital (when she got it exclusively) and I even had enough<br/>
to help out a new mother of twins at one point.<br/>
