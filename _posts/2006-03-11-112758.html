<div id="ygrps-yiv-573381848">A few days ago on this list, someone seemed unhappy with the way I  <br/>
used &quot;mindful.&quot;  For years, some of the regular writers here tried to  <br/>
find a good word for what we were trying to convey�a kind of  <br/>
mothering that involved making infintessimal decisions all the time,  <br/>
day and night, and basing those decisions on our evolving beliefs  <br/>
about living respectfully with our chidren, and giving THEM room to  <br/>
make their own decisions of the moment.<br/>
<br/>
We finally settled on &quot;mindful,&quot; in the sense of being fully in the  <br/>
moment.  Though &quot;mindfulness&quot; is used as a term in western Buddhism,  <br/>
the word they chose when they were translating from Japanese,  <br/>
Chinese, Hindu, Vietnamese and whatever all hodgepodge of ideas were  <br/>
eventually described in English, &quot;mindfulness,&quot; is an English word  <br/>
over 800 years old. It&#39;s a simple English compound, and has to do  <br/>
with the state of one&#39;s mind while performing an action.  It creates  <br/>
a state of &quot;if/then&quot; in one.  And IF a parent intends to be a good  <br/>
unschooling parent, a generous freedom-nurturing parent, a parent  <br/>
providing a peaceful nest, a parent wanting to be her child&#39;s  <br/>
partner, then the best way she can live in that goal and come ever  <br/>
closer to her ideals is to make all her decisions in that light.  The  <br/>
more mindful she is of where she intends to go, the easier her  <br/>
decisions are.<br/>
<br/>
When you come to an intersection, how do you decide which way to go?   <br/>
It helps, before operating a motor vehicle with all its attendant  <br/>
expenses and inherent dangers, to know where you want to go.  When  <br/>
you DO have a destination, then each intersection has some wrong  <br/>
ways, and some better and worse ways.    It&#39;s the same with  <br/>
unschooling.  If that&#39;s where you&#39;re headed, there are some wrong  <br/>
ways you can avoid simply by being mindful of your intent.<br/>
<br/>
So I was working on a webpage, as I do, and cleaning up some links,  <br/>
and came to this article by Danielle Conger, one of the owners of the  <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled list.   Every paragraph is powerful.  If you have  <br/>
someone to read it aloud to, that might bring it to life even better  <br/>
than just running eyes over it.  The writing is big, and it  <br/>
illustrates the concept wonderfully.<br/>

Mindful Mothering: The Art of Being Present<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mothers today juggle so many activities, appointments and duties that  <br/>
they may more closely resemble carnival entertainers than icons of  <br/>
love and calm. Of course, being an icon is over-rated, but we could  <br/>
all probably benefit from the ability to slow down some, become more  <br/>
focused and find a greater sense of calm and well-being.<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness�borrowed from the Buddhist practice of being present and  <br/>
aware of one�s thoughts, actions and environment�can add a powerful  <br/>
tool to our mothering repertoire, allowing us to take better care of  <br/>
ourselves and those around us.<br/>
<br/>
Each moment we spend playing with and caring for our children while  <br/>
thinking of what to make for dinner, the bills we need to pay, how  <br/>
many more minutes until we have to run out the door, the groceries we  <br/>
need to buy or anything other than exactly what we are doing with our  <br/>
child is a moment with them lost. Truth is, life with our children  <br/>
goes by all too fast. For many mothers, it seems like the time  <br/>
between birth and the first day of school goes by in the blink of an  <br/>
eye.<br/>
<br/>
More and more, mothers are choosing to slow down, reject the cultural  <br/>
values of multi-tasking and maximum efficiency, placing value instead  <br/>
in natural living and attachment parenting and homeschooling. Going  <br/>
back to the Earth and Mothering centers our Selves, revealing meaning  <br/>
and value that nourishes instead of fractures. Motherhood offers us  <br/>
the chance to rebirth ourselves through the birth of our children.  <br/>
Mindful mothering becomes the spiritual practice of our daily lives.<br/>
<br/>
Miniature Zen masters, our children offer us valuable insight into  <br/>
living with present awareness as well as the opportunity to practice  <br/>
on a daily basis. A smile, a laugh, the sense of wonder at each new  <br/>
experience call us back to the moment, back to ourselves, begging us  <br/>
to see the world through our child�s eyes, to re-experience and re- <br/>
awaken to the world around us.<br/>
<br/>
A squeal of delight as our child experiences the movement of a  <br/>
�kitty� invites us to look more closely at the cat, to see the  <br/>
texture and color of the fur, the suppleness of movement, the  <br/>
flexibility and focus the cat commands. We see with the wonder of our  <br/>
toddler�s eyes and the world is new. Our children generously lend us  <br/>
their perspective from moment to moment, renewing for us the miracle  <br/>
of living, if we only accept their gift as graciously as it is given.<br/>
<br/>
What does it mean to accept this gift? How do we live each moment  <br/>
more fully? We can begin by unlearning many of the lessons our fast- <br/>
paced society tries to teach. We can begin by slowing down, breathing  <br/>
deeply, focusing on the task at hand, and we can allow ourselves to  <br/>
experience the moment with all of our senses, bringing our body and  <br/>
mind together as one, united in common experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Becoming More Mindful<br/>
<br/>
Nursing mothers know the benefits of prolactin, �the mothering  <br/>
hormone� that�s released during breastfeeding, physiologically  <br/>
relaxing us into the moment of nursing�a perfect example of mindful  <br/>
mothering. Everything stops when we nurse our newborn in the days  <br/>
before it becomes as routine as brushing our teeth. Think back to  <br/>
those first weeks of nursing, sitting still, quieting mind and body  <br/>
as we cradle that new life against our skin, breathing deeply the  <br/>
smell of our infant and gazing intently at wondrous, tiny features.  <br/>
This is mindfulness. The key is to carry this sense of present  <br/>
awareness into all our actions and interactions throughout our days,  <br/>
but as mothers, we already recognize it.<br/>
<br/>
We can continue our mindfulness with something as simple as  <br/>
breathing. Buddhists have long known that focusing on the breath  <br/>
unites mind and body, bringing the Whole Self into present awareness.  <br/>
Thich Nhat Hanh, Buddhist monk and 1967 Nobel Peace Prize Nominee,  <br/>
has called conscious breathing the crucial bridge between mind and  <br/>
body, unifying the two and allowing us to become whole again. He  <br/>
recommends using the words, �Breathing in I calm my body; Breathing  <br/>
out, I smile.� Simply taking a moment to breathe, to recall our  <br/>
conscious mind and to relax our mouth into a smile enables us to see  <br/>
and experience life more clearly, richly and honestly.<br/>
<br/>
As parents of young children, we have countless opportunities  <br/>
throughout the day to practice this bridging, using conscious  <br/>
breathing to recall ourselves to mindfulness in stressful moments.  <br/>
More than the classic adage �count to three,� the practice of  <br/>
conscious breathing taps into our deepest awareness, refocusing our  <br/>
energy from reaction to recentering. Moving past reaction by  <br/>
breathing deeply, embracing our emotion and owning it, we can avoid  <br/>
horn-locking our energy with our child�s and focus instead on  <br/>
compassion and empathy, parenting our child through intense emotion  <br/>
rather than supplanting it with our own.<br/>
<br/>
We can continue with small moments, like giving a child a bath.  <br/>
Rather than sitting by the tub with countless obligations running  <br/>
through our mind, there in order to keep our child safe but not  <br/>
really there, we can join the experience, become really present.<br/>
<br/>
Climb into the tub, or roll up sleeves to feel the warmth of the  <br/>
water. Naturally scented bubble bath can augment the sensory  <br/>
experience, pulling us back into the moment with the foamy lightness  <br/>
of the bubbles, the soothing scent of lavender or chamomile, relaxing  <br/>
body and mind into the moment. We can compress a thick sponge,  <br/>
release, feel it drinking in water, becoming heavy, then squeeze,  <br/>
inviting warm water to rain down our child�s back. Being present and  <br/>
aware creates a moment of connection between ourselves and our child  <br/>
as together we live that moment fully.<br/>
<br/>
We can continue by truly listening to our children and viewing the  <br/>
world through their eyes. By allowing our child�s voice to be our  <br/>
clarion call back to the present, we can focus all our being on her  <br/>
wonder, curiosity and need to explore her world. We can look into her  <br/>
eyes as she tells us about the discovery she�s just made, rub her  <br/>
back as she describes the hurt she feels, get down to her height as  <br/>
she explains her needs and plans, shifting our perspective to meet  <br/>
hers as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
By making physical, emotional and spiritual connection with our  <br/>
children, we assure them that they matter in our lives, that they are  <br/>
more important than the book we�re reading or the phone call we need  <br/>
to make or the laundry list of things we need to get done. These  <br/>
connections, as they occur, make up the ongoing symbiosis of nurture  <br/>
and wonder between mother and child, weaving us together at countless  <br/>
points throughout the day, wrapping us both in the warmth, love and  <br/>
safety of togetherness in each moment, really breathing, really  <br/>
loving, really living.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Benefits of Mindfulness<br/>
<br/>
Living more mindfully brings us closer to our child�s perspective,  <br/>
allowing us to glimpse the world through his eyes, but more  <br/>
importantly, providing us insight into our child�s Self. Because we  <br/>
are able to view things more readily from our child�s perspective, we  <br/>
become an important ally, a trusted advisor and a partner in problem  <br/>
solving.<br/>
<br/>
Through the empathy gained by mothering mindfully, we can aid our  <br/>
children in fulfilling their dreams and desires in safe, productive  <br/>
and healthy ways. Because they trust that we understand them and can  <br/>
see the world from their perspective, they are more willing to turn  <br/>
to us for help, fostering the openness and communication essential to  <br/>
a positive parent/ child relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness also offers us a shift in our own perspective, enabling  <br/>
us to see life for what it really is�each moment a miracle. By living  <br/>
life moment to moment, we leave the regrets of the past behind us and  <br/>
the worries of the future for the day they may come to be. Moreover,  <br/>
we begin to see that each moment offers us a fresh opportunity to see  <br/>
what we have right now and enjoy it while it graces our life.  <br/>
Mindfulness centers us in the moment we are alive�breathing, living� <br/>
freeing us to see the joy that surrounds us in our child�s smile, the  <br/>
light catching the leaves in summer, snow crystals glinting in the  <br/>
crisp winter sun. We learn to see the joy that�s all around us.<br/>
<br/>
Practicing mindfulness is an excellent way to counter the fear-based  <br/>
culture in which we live, providing an antidote to each primetime  <br/>
newscast sensationally reporting yet another threat to ourselves and  <br/>
our children. Fear demands that we dwell in what-ifs and a false  <br/>
future, sacrificing the joy of the moment for the fear of someday. As  <br/>
we work to live in the moment, we recognize more deeply the worries  <br/>
and emotions that wrestle us out of the moment, seeing them for the  <br/>
chimeras they so often are.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the clarity that mindfulness brings to our perception of the  <br/>
world, it simultaneously offers clarity of Self. Fostering  <br/>
introspection and greater self-awareness, mindfulness can give us a  <br/>
deeper understanding of who we are and our place in this world. When  <br/>
we hold our mind in focus, we begin to prioritize our life by placing  <br/>
the people and the principles that are most important to us foremost  <br/>
where they truly belong. Too easily do we lose sight of the value our  <br/>
children bring to our lives, wishing away the moments of finding  <br/>
shoes and buckling car seats. Mindfulness brings that value back into  <br/>
focus, reminding us to treasure each moment we are blessed with them,  <br/>
however mundane, because it is a gift.<br/>
<br/>
When we can hold the truth of that gift in our minds, we can find a  <br/>
greater sense of peace within ourselves that allows us to respond  <br/>
with a greater sense of peace and gentleness to our children. How  <br/>
many times have we woken in the middle of the night to gaze upon our  <br/>
sleeping children, assuring ourselves that they are still breathing,  <br/>
whether they are next to us or in the next room, two or ten? How many  <br/>
times has the mother who lost a child wished for every moment back  <br/>
again? If we can hold that sense of mindfulness of life�s precious  <br/>
value, we hold the key to responding to our children with love and  <br/>
kindness instead of sharpness and exasperation.<br/>
<br/>
We can easily recall ourselves to this sense of mindfulness by  <br/>
practicing conscious breathing, recalling our priorities and clearing  <br/>
our perspective from the baggage we bring. When we can stop, focus on  <br/>
our breathing and re-center, we see the spilt milk for what it truly  <br/>
is: our child�s attempt to explore his world, to become more  <br/>
independent, to perform an act of thoughtfulness.<br/>
<br/>
Our practice becomes our child�s practice as well, as we model for  <br/>
them peaceful and empathetic response. By modeling conscious  <br/>
breathing before reacting, we show our children how to deal  <br/>
effectively with intense emotions without ever giving a lesson. Young  <br/>
children, too, can benefit tremendously from learning to breathe  <br/>
through their anger, frustration and disappointment. In my family, we  <br/>
call it �blowing bubbles��breathing in good energy and blowing out  <br/>
negative energy in tiny bubbles that float safely skyward, popping  <br/>
without harm to ourselves or others. Such deep breathing and  <br/>
visualization techniques give children positive and practical tools  <br/>
that stay with them through life.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the greatest benefit of mindful mothering is the joyful and  <br/>
compassionate home it creates. The ripples of our own mindfulness  <br/>
emanate, touching all members of the family. Our own empathetic and  <br/>
compassionate responses are rejoined by compassion from our spouse  <br/>
and our children. When we maintain perspective and clarity, we bring  <br/>
others back to mindful living with us, reminding them of their own  <br/>
priorities and the joy that surrounds them. When we feel peace, we  <br/>
become peace and embody the grace of that serenity, embracing our  <br/>
children with a heart of compassion and joy.<br/>
