<div id="ygrps-yiv-435551262">... one of them, I should say, as I&#39;ve several, has a very interesting <br/>
personality trait. She will take some portion of conversation, morph it in<br/>
her head, and come out believing (and saying) something that never happened.<br/>
(I don&#39;t have any idea what causes her to do this: habit, upbringing,<br/>
psychology, beats me).<br/>
<br/>
The most recent examples:<br/>
<br/>
1. Sil telling my husband (her brother) that on her next visit she&#39;ll be<br/>
ready to review our daughters&#39; homeschooling for us. My husband replied to<br/>
this something along the lines of, &quot;Huh?&quot; She repeated that, as they had<br/>
agreed, she would look over the girls progress and help us sort out any<br/>
problems. Wally assured her he had no memory of this agreement, and would<br/>
never ask anyone at all under any circumstances to do this. Sil became very<br/>
indignant.<br/>
<br/>
2. Sil telling my other sister-in-law, Heidi, &quot;remember when Judi told me to<br/>
&#39;just get over it&#39; about Mom dying!&quot;  Judi is their step-mother, a very kind<br/>
woman with a good relationship with all four of her daughters (natural and<br/>
step), and this confused Heidi who had no memory of such a conversation, but<br/>
Sil insisted it was true.<br/>
<br/>
After sorting through both situations, we did figure out what had happened:<br/>
<br/>
Wally was trying to explain homeschooling to Sil (a chemistry major, who is<br/>
about to get her PhD), using as an example that if our daughters ever got<br/>
the chemist&#39;s bug and went beyond what we knew to do or could figure out, we<br/>
knew who to call for advice and help, namely Sil.<br/>
<br/>
And, in a conversation about how difficult it would be for Sil to marry next<br/>
spring without her mother at the wedding, Judi (step-mother) had said<br/>
something in an attempt to comfort along the lines that it WAS very hard,<br/>
but she knew that Sil&#39;s mother would really want her to have a happy life<br/>
and that she, Sil, shouldn&#39;t feel guilty about being happy.<br/>
<br/>
Some recent conversations on this list are reminding me a lot of trying to<br/>
talk to my sister-in-law. The trouble is, she believes what she says, and no<br/>
matter who or how many say, &quot;you said this&quot; she says, &quot;No, I said that.&quot; It<br/>
makes for excruciating conversations with a person who is otherwise quite<br/>
pleasant to be around. And it is pointless to argue, as she really does seem<br/>
to think she&#39;s got the right of it and all the rest of the world is<br/>
persecuting her for reasons unknown.<br/>
<br/>
The only bright spot is that everyone around her figures it out pretty<br/>
quickly, and makes allowances for it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly the reason why I save my sent files for a while and why I<br/>
refer back to the archives to check what was actually said, before I say<br/>
that I didn&#39;t say something.  Sometimes, something comes across<br/>
incorrectly and I can correct it then, and sometimes people are<br/>
attributing things to me that I didn&#39;t say, and sometimes, someone will<br/>
just flat out insist that I said something and nothing will convince them<br/>
otherwise.  I feel sorry for those people because I bet they miss out on<br/>
a lot of interesting friendships.  They are so sure of themselves that<br/>
they refuse to review the conversation for themselves.<br/>
