<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591330027">Hey, all...<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, while we were *birding* at the Bronx Zoo in the rain, I <br/>
got *umbrella-ed* a couple of times by accident by my husband!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great birding discussions...but this list and my <br/>
unschooling life are not a good match!  <br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to post something that I posted on the message <br/>
boards...I signed up for the highly sensitive person book list at <br/>
yahoo, and received this message:<br/>
<br/>
***Hi Anne, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m taking the liberty of inviting you to HSCBOOK as well (as HPSBOOK <br/>
which you just joined) because I am hoping to change the flavor a <br/>
bit. <br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooling mom of a 4yo and it has been my contention that <br/>
HSCs and unschooling are a great match and that as an HSP parent, one <br/>
would be more inclined to homeschool in the first place. <br/>
<br/>
So this is my not-so-subtle effort to begin to influence the content <br/>
on this group. I am not expert on anything except my own daughter, <br/>
but I do hope you&#39;ll consider joining this group as well and posting <br/>
a bit on your beliefs. There are already a few homeschoolers but also <br/>
many who seem to have blindly internalized the mainstream views <br/>
(maybe &quot;It was done to us so we&#39;ll do it to them&quot; or something like <br/>
that.) <br/>
<br/>

Since I posted this at the boards, more unschoolers have joined the <br/>
list.  I just wanted to let other unschooling parents of highly <br/>
sensitive children know about it...Here&#39;s the homepage:  <br/>

Be Well ~<br/>
