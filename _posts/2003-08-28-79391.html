<div id="ygrps-yiv-519354764">***Suggestion for next conference -- a &quot;hang out&quot; location that stays open<br/>
until the wee hours of the morning for those of us who cannot stand to waste<br/>
a minute &quot;just&quot; sleeping!! As I said there - I can SLEEP when I get home!<br/>
&lt;G&gt;***<br/>
<br/>
I beat you to it, pam. &lt;G&gt;  I already suggested this to Kathryn while we<br/>
were still at the conference.  We had so many people that were from<br/>
different time zones plus we had so little time with each other that no one<br/>
wanted to go to sleep.  The adults were kicked out of the pool area at 11:00<br/>
and the kids kept getting kicked out of places all night long.  We<br/>
definately need two hang out rooms, one for the adults and one for the kids<br/>
that can stay awake that long.<br/>
