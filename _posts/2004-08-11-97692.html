That show is just scary.  $50,000 is not worth what it appears those  <br/>
families are going through.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939287182">When my 19-yo daughter Tammi first saw the show she said, &quot;Is that <br/>
show supposed to make you appreciate the mom you have by giving you <br/>
one who doesn&#39;t do anything with you or take you anywhere?&quot; &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen the show but my daughter told me that one mom was <br/>
blow drying her hair and the fuse kept blowing, so instead of using <br/>
a different plug, she made the kid stand in a closet where the fuse <br/>
box was so he could turn the circuit back on when it blew and she <br/>
could finish her hair!  What&#39;s even sadder is that the kid did as he <br/>
was told.  My kids wouldn&#39;t have done it.  <br/>
