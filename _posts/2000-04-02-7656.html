<div id="ygrps-yiv-966792112">Hey, I LOVE all the stories of pregnancy at 40+ too!!!  Keep them<br/>
coming.  So empowering and encouraging and such a testimony to<br/>
motherhood and women in a context we&#39;re not normally used to hearing in<br/>
society.  We&#39;re expanding the notion of YOUTH and VITALITY.<br/>

&gt; I had my first (and only) child when I was 40.  I never paid much attention<br/>
&gt; to all the huplah about age and pregnancy, just trusted myself and my body.<br/>
&gt; I am the natural as possible type so didn&#39;t get any of the tests, (amnio<br/>
&gt; etc.)  In fact did not see a medical doctor, just an at home mid-wife.  I<br/>
&gt; did have moments of fear when well meaning friends would tell stories of<br/>
&gt; worst case scenario&#39;s, but decided I wasn&#39;t going to create a dreaded<br/>
&gt; experience, and if I did have something happen it was for the highest and<br/>
&gt; best.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, I never felt better in my life during month&#39;s 4 to 9 of the<br/>
&gt; pregnancy,  I did have to go to the emergency room of the hospital for the<br/>
&gt; delivery after 4 days of labor, but left after 4 hours with a healthy baby.<br/>
&gt; The hospital story and process had some difficulty, but had much meaning and<br/>
&gt; learning for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everything is so individual, and I do not like to buy into statistics and<br/>
&gt; fear based decisions and was glad I didn&#39;t in this case.<br/>

&gt; &gt;       Thanks for your letter! I am 41 and though I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too<br/>
&gt; &gt; old, I sure do like to hear of  healthy babies being born to women in<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; 40&#39;s!  And I really love the stories about those  &quot;suprise babies&quot; born<br/>
&gt; &gt; after years of infertility!    jackie<br/>
