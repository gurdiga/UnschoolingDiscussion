&gt; &gt; &gt; 3  since she wanted more color in her outfits.  Now it is part of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fashion.  A couple of other girls she plays with have started it too.<br/>
&gt; One<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is older and she made the comment that she didn&#39;t have to sort her socks<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have to sort Megan&#39;s socks - they just go in a bin in her drawer<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; she picks out what she wants to wear that day.<br/>

another pair like it at home. Well, not really...but in theory...<br/>
