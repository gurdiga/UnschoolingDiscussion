<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734251515">Right, this is one of those &#39;off-topic&#39; things about kids which <br/>
someone saw fit to be so dismissive of.  I&#39;m asking here because i <br/>
really need some feedback on the whole emotional/empathetic/ <br/>
behavioural thing (basically I&#39;m looking for words of wisdom from <br/>
Susan &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Tuesday morning and once again I&#39;m mega-fed-up with the <br/>
whole tidying-up thing.  I don&#39;t know, what do you all think?  I need <br/>
to have one day a week when I get the whole house done.  If this <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen, it gets overwhelming and it doesn&#39;t get done for <br/>
weeks and weeks.  This includes the kids&#39; room.  So is tidying <br/>
their room their problem, since it&#39;s their room, or mine, since I&#39;m <br/>
the one who wants to vac the floor?  It doesn&#39;t help that I got fed-up <br/>
of them faffing about on a Tuesday morning so now they do it on <br/>
Monday night, and then my Tai Chi class moves from Thurs to Mon <br/>
so dh has the kids, and at the moment there seems a lot of <br/>
negativity from that corner.  Last night he told them that the tidying <br/>
up would be done before they played out, (in ultimatum format...) <br/>
so Heather said &#39;I&#39;ve changed my mind, I don&#39;t want to play out...&#39;  I <br/>
can&#39;t change how he is with them, but I can change how I am, and <br/>
something needs to give...<br/>
<br/>
Am I expecting too much of a 4&1/2 and 3&1/2yo, ther are capable <br/>
of doing the tidying up, apart from the books, which either me or dh <br/>
do?  The other problem is that when dh has the kids, he usually <br/>
has work to do (like last night,) so they do their thing while he does <br/>
his, or he wants peace and quiet to watch tv...  Can you tell it&#39;s not <br/>
the kids I&#39;m annoyed with???<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is off-topic, cause I don&#39;t see how we can all live <br/>
together (which is surely what home-ed is about) unless we can <br/>
manage these situations well.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I need to go finish that hoovering...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021857260">Hi, I&#39;m new to this list-so this is kind of a response/self-intro (although<br/>
I recognize a few names here from the huuh list, hem page and unschooling<br/>
page, which I frequent).  I&#39;m a homeschooler/unschooler (or learning to be<br/>
one), have 3 boys 7, 3, and 3 months, and live in Escanaba MI. We&#39;ve been<br/>
homeschooling for about 2 years, and my son has been gradually leading me<br/>
into unschooling, which is the best method for him to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m addressing your question, Tracy, because I just went through this with<br/>
my husband, Mike.  He&#39;s naturally a coercive parent. He does his best to<br/>
control it, but his childhood upbringing was based on authority and fear,<br/>
and he regresses.  We&#39;ve done a good job treating our kids like people and<br/>
not pets, so they are personality plus-especially our eldest boy. As a<br/>
result, Mike butts heads with our son, Seamus, rather often.  He&#39;s proud of<br/>
Seamus&#39; spirit, but frustrated that Seamus hasn&#39;t yet figured out how to<br/>
pick his battles. I admit, I get frustrated too, but I&#39;m more patient than<br/>
my husband.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had the same problems over house upkeep. We all live in this house and<br/>
avail of the advantages of living here, so I feel we all need to work<br/>
together in order to &quot;pay&quot; for the &quot;privilege&quot; of living in our home. I<br/>
explained it to my son by using the Little Red Hen story. It seemed to click<br/>
well in his brain, but his lack of helping didn&#39;t change-and I ended up<br/>
witnessing my husband coercing my son again to clean the house.<br/>
<br/>
In order to keep peace in the house, we had to create non-coercive, or at<br/>
least minimally coercive, consequences for my son.  Since we consider living<br/>
in our home a privilege, we decided to make a list of Seamus&#39; favorite<br/>
privileges.  We wrote them out on tickets and tacked them to our bulletin<br/>
board. When we find ourselves repeatedly requesting that he perform a<br/>
household duty and he fails to do it he loses a daily privilege-like<br/>
watching t.v., playing with his sega, using the computer, staying up until<br/>
9:30pm, getting dessert after dinner, and the absolute worst one we pull<br/>
last, playing outside. (This last one is the biggie-he knows he&#39;ll really<br/>
have screwed up if we have to pull that one as it&#39;s his favorite thing to<br/>
do.  The good thing is-we haven&#39;t had to pull it yet). I can usually tell<br/>
when it&#39;s time to take a ticket because I can feel my frustration level<br/>
increase-I have no set number of requests since every situation is slightly<br/>
different<br/>
<br/>
We also use the reward system, based on an idea I saw listed on another<br/>
homeschooling board.  When he performs each daily duty without being forced<br/>
to do it, he gets a star on his learning calendar.  When he gets 10 stars he<br/>
gets a ticket which he can use towards special privileges.  Right now he&#39;s<br/>
working towards getting Nickelodeon magazine-we&#39;ve placed a ticket value on<br/>
it based on the subscription price.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is true blue non-coercive parenting, but it&#39;s a<br/>
compromise that seems to be mutually beneficial.  Our son is learning that<br/>
there are expectations that need to be followed when you share your home<br/>
with others, and my husband is learning that children don&#39;t have to be<br/>
threatened with ultimatums in order to get them to clean up after<br/>
themselves. Most importantly, we&#39;ve learned how to talk with one another<br/>
about doing household chores without getting frustrated or angry. And our<br/>
home is staying clean without buildup for the first time since we&#39;ve had<br/>
kids.  It&#39;s amazing! I guess some people (like me!) are just slow. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway-that&#39;s an idea-something to chew on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When mine were small, I found it worked best to pick up with them, modelling<br/>
the behavior I wanted them to learn. A mess can seem so overwhelming to a<br/>
young person and most kids are not born knowing how to organize. Also, I<br/>
found that setting the timer for 10 minutes and making a game out of picking<br/>
up as much as we could in that amount of time was successful. After 10<br/>
minutes, we quit. We could always have another 10 minute session later in<br/>
the day. Another thing that worked for me was asking them to pick up a<br/>
specific number of things...   like 5 or 10 or whatever. Getting it done in<br/>
little chunks like that is doable and it really does make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, they grow up faster than you could ever think possible. Then you<br/>
will think back nostalgically to all those messes. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere that when living with kids, a day can seem like a year, but<br/>
the years seem like days.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your toddlers. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh! I just remembered a wonderful book about housekeeping written by a<br/>
homeschooling mom. It&#39;s &quot;Shelter for the Spirit: create your own haven in a<br/>
hectic world,&quot; by Victoria Moran. I found it very inspiring and it made me<br/>
actually want to clean and cook and create a haven for myself and my family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885310324">Thanks, Lee.  I don&#39;t want to start on the reward-system thing, <br/>
cos afaics, it just lends to bigger and bigger rewards, and more <br/>
and more reliance on external motivation, but since the kids have <br/>
no internal motivation to sort their stuff out, I don&#39;t know where to <br/>
start.  I think most of us were brought up with some coersion or <br/>
other (either reward or punishment or combination of both) and <br/>
the lucky ones who weren&#39;t are probably secure in themselves <br/>
enough to not need the suport of a list like this &lt;g&gt;  it&#39;s something <br/>
to add to the mix, though...<br/>
