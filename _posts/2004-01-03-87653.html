My friend talked her dad into helping her and by using their 4 hands instead<br/>
of her two, she was able to get to &quot;usable&quot; quality within a week.  My two<br/>
hands can&#39;t seem to get coordinated with the timing of the spindle<br/>

Check out what else you can do with wool.  These are not my creations, but I <br/>
took a class on needle felting and it&#39;s a lot of fun, barely uses any supplies <br/>
(I only used a couple of 1.00 felting needles and a piece of foam to put <br/>
under it so you don&#39;t poke yourself or the table) and just go where your <br/>
imagination takes you.  I made a possum that my mom&#39;s friends wouldn&#39;t touch, they said <br/>
it looked so real! :o)<br/>

stairwell to drop their spindles over to more easily get a really long<br/>

I sold a bunch of stuff on Ebay last year about this time and bought myself a <br/>
spinning wheel.  It is so enjoyable, and so addicting.  I haven&#39;t spun <br/>
anything in about 6 months but hope to get back into it when the snow really flies.  <br/>
We have sheep and angora goats.  If you go to Ebay and type in something like <br/>
spinning wool or wool fiber there&#39;s tons of it for sale on there, every color <br/>
of the rainbow imaginable, all ready to spin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944034078">I also just purchased a spinning wheel after spending a few months with a drop spindle.  I am still working on my technique with the spinning wheel so the drop spindle get used quite a bit still.  I even brought it with me on vacation and worked on spinning in the hotel room.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the mothers in our homeschool group taught a class on dyeing and spinning.  She made each participant a drop spindle for around $1 using two wooden &quot;wheel&quot; pieces and a dowel with a metal hook at the top.  Another of the mothers in our goup then followed up with a knitting class, with homemade wooden knitting needles.  It was a fantastic experience and my kids now love to work with wool.  We are planning a &quot;sheep to shawl&quot; project where we take a fleece, clean it, dye it, spin it and then knit it into a shawl or sweater.  Considering these are new skills for *all* of us, it will be interesting to see how it turns out!<br/>
<br/>
Using a drop spindle is quite easy, it took about an hour or so to master the technique.  It is slow going, but portable so you can keep it in the car and work on it at opportune moments (unlike a spinning wheel).  Some of the women I know actually prefer a drop spindle because of the portability.  I do love working on it, but really enjoy the &quot;zen&quot; of working on a spinning wheel.  <br/>

My eldest daughter has been lobbying hard to get a table loom.  Her interest is in weaving the product.  I told her we need to start a little smaller (and cheaper!).  <br/>
