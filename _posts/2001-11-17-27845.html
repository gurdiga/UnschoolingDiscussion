<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117949106">I have this certificate on the front of my log book.<br/>
It just became apparent to me that this was written by<br/>
Sandra. Some wise words here, to be sure. Perhaps the<br/>
distance between us on this group is not so far?<br/>
<br/>
These lines are of particular interest to me, in light<br/>
of the recent threads...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As bearer of this certificate you are no longer<br/>
required to depend on the advice of experts. &quot;  (Even<br/>
those who consider themselves experts on unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy<br/>
your kids; to rejoice when your children surpass you<br/>
in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make mistakes, and<br/>
to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; (And to share our mistakes and<br/>
wisdoms as just that, our own. Offer support, talk<br/>
about what worked for some, and encourage each other.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life,<br/>
and take what steps you feel necessary to protect your<br/>
children from physical, emotional or social harm.<br/>
(Setting boundaries, limits are healthy!)<br/>
<br/>
You have leave to think your own thoughts, and to<br/>
encourage your children to think theirs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We all are entitled to our own thoughts, and mistakes.<br/>
Just remember that it is in community that we find the<br/>
strength to grow.<br/>

Certificate of Empowerment<br/>

This is intended for those who want to be &quot;certified&quot;.<br/>
Feel free to print this out for yourself or a friend.<br/>

<br/>
Certificate of Empowerment<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As bearer of this certificate you are no longer<br/>
required to depend on the advice of experts. You may<br/>
step back and view the entire world-not just your<br/>
home, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth-as a<br/>
learning experience, a laboratory containing languages<br/>
(and native speakers thereof), plants, animals,<br/>
history, geology, weather (real live weather, in the<br/>
sky, not in a book), music, art , mathematics,<br/>
physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, and ideas<br/>
without end. Although collections of these treasures<br/>
have been located in museums for your convenience,<br/>
they are to be found everywhere else, too.<br/>
<br/>
This authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy<br/>
your kids; to rejoice when your children surpass you<br/>
in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make mistakes, and<br/>
to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may allow your<br/>
children to experience boredom without taking full<br/>
responsibility for finding them something to do. <br/>
<br/>
Henceforth you shall neither be required nor expected<br/>
to finish everything you start. Projects, books,<br/>
experiments and plans may be discontinued as soon as<br/>
something more interesting comes along (or for any<br/>
other reason) without penalty, and picked up again at<br/>
any time in the future (or never).<br/>
<br/>
You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life,<br/>
and take what steps you feel necessary to protect your<br/>
children from physical, emotional or social harm.<br/>
<br/>
You have leave to think your own thoughts, and to<br/>
encourage your children to think theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Each person who reads and understands this is<br/>
authorized to extend these privileges to others, by<br/>
reproducing and distributing this certificate or by<br/>
creating another of his/her own design. Those who<br/>
don&#39;t feel the need to obtain approval to experiment,<br/>
to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen others do<br/>
are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the<br/>
first place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=====<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m looking for other people who realize that the<br/>
universe is one big contradiction,<br/>
and the only true purpose to life is to smell the<br/>
flowers and hug your friends.&quot;<br/>
