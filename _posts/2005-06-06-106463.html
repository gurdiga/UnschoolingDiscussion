<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528641958">I don&#39;t know from Peets but...Back in the Philadelphia /South NJ area there<br/>
was a supermarket called Zagara&#39;s where they roasted the coffee beans in the<br/>
store.  There was *nothing* like fresh coffee brewed from beans roasted that<br/>
day!  Starbucks can&#39;t match it.  I miss it terribly!<br/>

I dimly recall that when Starbucks was a new company, they bragged that their beans were never more than a day past roasting, or was it a week ?? old.  Now you can buy it in foil packages with dates at least 6 months out.<br/>
