<div id="ygrps-yiv-386165268">Hello,<br/>
I am on digest mode of this list, and have not been active on the list<br/>
either, for some time, due to time constraints.  I am writing now to ask<br/>
for some much needed understanding and support(help?).<br/>
<br/>
Something happened yesterday, that made me realize my need for support,<br/>
which will require a bit of background information, so here it is:<br/>
<br/>
I live in WA state, and I have been homeschooling my 2 children(ages 8 &<br/>
6) for 2+years now.  Unschooling is an informed lifestyle choice I have<br/>
made for my family.  I am a very capable single mother, on a limited<br/>
income(disability).  My children&#39;s father is not, and never has been<br/>
involved in their lives.  They do have male role models, and their<br/>
absent biological father is not a problem or an issue in my life or my<br/>
children&#39;s at this time.<br/>
<br/>
I also have Bipolar disorder(otherwise known as manic depression), a<br/>
very serious, potentially life threatening(a shocking 15-20% of<br/>
untreated bipolar sufferers commit suicide), incurable, but highly<br/>
treatable(medication called mood stabilizers, are a must for this<br/>
illness) neurobiological disorder of the brain, which affects mood,<br/>
behavior, and thoughts.  It is also highly genetic and happens to run in<br/>
both sides of my family(and possibly my children&#39;s paternal line as<br/>
well).  I had childhood onset type(even more highly genetic) of bipolar<br/>
disorder, as did my maternal grandfather and a maternal uncle.  My<br/>
extended family, on both sides, is riddled with &quot;mental<br/>
illness&quot;(paternal grandmother & grandfather, my own brother & my<br/>
father).  As a result of all of this, I have educated myself about<br/>
neurobioligical brain disorders(otherwise called &quot;mental illnesses&quot;),<br/>
their symptoms, treatment, etc., and continue to do so.<br/>
<br/>
My son(age 8.5 yrs.), who is very intelligent, smart, and wonderful &<br/>
sweet, has been showing signs of A.D.H.D. since birth, basicly, nothing<br/>
for which I am too concerned about other than the fact that ADD is often<br/>
seen in children prior to onset of bipolar symptoms(a precursor sign). <br/>
Last year, I noticed some changes in my sons mood and behavior, which<br/>
had me concerned(he seemed depressed for about 2 weeks).  Knowing what I<br/>
know about Bipolar disorder and that it runs in my family, I chose to<br/>
speak to his doctor about my concerns at that time(last spring), who was<br/>
hesitant to refer me to a specialist, nonetheless I insisted upon a<br/>
referral.  I could not get him in at that time, since the doctor in the<br/>
next town refused to see him, and we did not have a psychiatrist in our<br/>
town then.<br/>
<br/>
We now have one (her specialty is even child psychiatry), she works at<br/>
our community mental health facility, who is also my own psychiatrist,<br/>
and my prescribing physician.  My sons doctor recently referred him to<br/>
her, and yesterday was his appointment.<br/>
<br/>
I went to this appointment, expecting to address my sons&#39; mood symptoms<br/>
and my concerns about his inheriting the family propensity for this<br/>
illness, particularly childhood onset bipolar disorder, and what I can<br/>
and can&#39;t do about that.  Like what can I do to help my son deal with<br/>
his emotions, what signs should I look for, when to seek treatment if<br/>
and when...., NOT to get him on medication(I am not even considering<br/>
that as an option at this time), for ADD or anything else.  I have been<br/>
told, and have read again and again, in my research on this topic, that<br/>
it is best to have a child seen as soon at the first sign of symptoms. <br/>
I have suspected for sometime with my son(he is so much like I was in<br/>
everyway-and so different from my daughter).  I just wanted some<br/>
professional advice/opinion, a professional to hear my concerns,etc., <br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t believe what I actually got instead and I am infuriated by<br/>
it.  I am also very confused, because she is my own doctor(my new pdoc),<br/>
and I don&#39;t want my feelings concerning this to interfere with my<br/>
developing relationship with her in that arena(because I need her to<br/>
treat me, she is the only pdoc nearby), right now, but perhaps that is<br/>
being unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my son&#39;s appt. was for an hour, and she spent the first part of<br/>
that time talking to him, while I was in the room, most of it talking to<br/>
me privately while he played in the waiting room, and about 3 minutes<br/>
speaking to him privately.  When asked about school, he told her he was<br/>
homeschooling.  He is kind of shy of strangers, so he was not real<br/>
forthcoming with her, and kept saying &quot;i don&#39;t know&quot; a lot.  During the<br/>
time she spent alone with me talking about my son, she asked me why I<br/>
was homeschooling my kids.  I told her it is a lifestyle choice I have<br/>
made, and something I thought about doing since Skyler was a baby. <br/>
(It&#39;s not like something happened to make me decide this or that it was<br/>
a sudden decision, you know?.)  She kept asking me questions like what<br/>
grade is he in(I said &quot;he would be in 3rd grade&quot;)?, if I knew what grade<br/>
level he was at(I said &quot;not really&quot; and was oviously not too concerned<br/>
about it)?, and if we use a curriculum(&quot;no, we do not&quot;)?, and what about<br/>
testing, etc.?   I was really caught off guard by this line of<br/>
questioning, I mean I took my son to her because of my concerns about<br/>
him having symptoms of a mood disorder!!!???  How in the hell does this<br/>
have to do with curriculum and testing and grade level?  I am just so<br/>
angry about this, and I feel I was discriminated against, although I am<br/>
not sure why.  She obviously doens&#39;t understand about homeschooling,<br/>
unschooling, or my decision to do so, and I certainly can&#39;t explain that<br/>
to her in a nutshell in less than an hour!  But, I also felt<br/>
discriminated against because of my having bipolar disorder and because<br/>
I am a single parent.  She also asked lots of questions about his<br/>
father, etc.,  She asked Skyler to list all the members of his family,<br/>
who lives in his house, etc, and then she said &quot;what about your Dad?&quot;<br/>
and he said &quot;I don&#39;t have a Dad.&quot;  She seemed very concerned about this,<br/>
but the fact is that he doesn&#39;t have a Dad, and it doens&#39;t bother him or<br/>
me(but it did bother her, it seems she didn&#39;t like his answer).  I have<br/>
told him about his biological father as he has asked, but he is just not<br/>
very concerned with that.  I&#39;m sure he will ask more questions as he<br/>
matures.  Once again, other than her asking for genetic purposes, I see<br/>
no point for her concern on this matter.    <br/>
<br/>
If you have followed me this far, please keep reading, because this is<br/>
the important part of my story.  Now, get this: by middle of our<br/>
converstation and her questioning, she &quot;professionally recommends&quot; to<br/>
me, that I enroll my son in p.s., if not full-time, then part-time,<br/>
because she says even though kids may not want to go to school all day,<br/>
for some kids, it is actually good for them(even if they don&#39;t want to),<br/>
because they get to be around other kids and develop relationships with<br/>
other adults,etc., AND because she can&#39;t really diagnose him as ADD(i<br/>
wasn&#39;t asking her to) if he&#39;s not in school, since the way that she<br/>
usually does that is to send forms/diagnostic tests, etc., for the<br/>
schools/teachers.  I was so shocked I could barely respond!  She could<br/>
see I was not pleased with what she had to say, and I just told her<br/>
plain and simple, that I was not even considering putting my children in<br/>
ps at this time, that this was not an issue at all with me.  She asked<br/>
if I ever planned to, and I told her if my kids ever decided they really<br/>
wanted to go to school, then they would go(they definately do not want<br/>
to now, I know this, and they know they can if they want).  I also made<br/>
it clear to her my ONLY reason for concern about &quot;testing&quot; is because it<br/>
is required by law, but not until 4th grade(am I right?).  She was<br/>
trying to tell me testing/grade level, etc., was important so he could<br/>
&quot;graduate&quot; from h.s.(???) and go to college.  My God, who is this woman,<br/>
and what does any of this have to do with why I took him there?  I feel<br/>
like I am in the twilight zone here or something, haha!  After her<br/>
continual questioning and focusing on this &quot;issue&quot;, I told her my son<br/>
reads way beyond his grade level(he can read anything he wants to read,<br/>
and does all the time).  <br/>
<br/>
So, I left there with her unappreciated and unasked for advice on<br/>
school, and that is it, basicly.  What a joke!  <br/>
Finally, she spoke to d.s. privately for a couple of minutes, and when<br/>
we left I asked him what she said, he told me that she asked him if he<br/>
thought he would like to go back to school or something to that<br/>
affect!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
What, if anything, should I do about this?  Is this sort of thing to be<br/>
expected from a psychiatrist?  I am just so shocked.  Maybe I am living<br/>
in a bubble and this is common discrimination.  Do the rest of you deal<br/>
with this sort of nonsense?  If so, how do you deal with it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who read this whole thing, and thanks in advance to all<br/>
who respond.  This has really upset me and I feel so alone right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413474549">Ok so I am responding and I left the whole message down there...hope that is<br/>
OK!<br/>
I had a similar problem...but it was with an ER doctor....and let me tell<br/>
you---it usually ends in Child Services getting involved---hence I NEVER<br/>
take the kids to the DRS except once a year and then I pretend that I am a<br/>
moron and they let me be!<br/>
You cannot make people &quot;understand&quot;---they DONT want to --it is my feelings<br/>
that if suddenly they let themselves see the light then they would have to<br/>
see all that is wrong in their world---OK yeah I know I am seeing it all<br/>
from my perspective but HEY when I challenge them to prove their side of the<br/>
story..........I get nothing!!...Anyways--so I took the baby to the doctors<br/>
ER cause his &quot;doctor&quot; could not see him---He was leaking fluid from his ear<br/>
(I was freaking out because none of my 6 children ever had this type of<br/>
infection)!--the doctor starts questioning my WHOLE belief system &quot;you are<br/>
strictly breastfeeding--he was only 6 months--shhh don&#39;t tell he is a year<br/>
and he almost still strictly breastfeeds---YOU don&#39;t have him<br/>
vaccinated...Homebirth and on and on--I was so upset and then she goes on to<br/>
tell me that I have to give my child IBUPROPHEN (SP I am sure) and I was<br/>
like NO WAY--you could tell they wanted to take my baby--they had all of the<br/>
hospital administration there in the room!--I said NO to the ibupro and they<br/>
were PISSED---So I had to go outside and call HUBBY (cell phone not allowed<br/>
in Hosp)--and they say to me you have to leave your child in here (I was<br/>
LIKE no way---like I am some moron (ok I act like on so they leave me<br/>
alone--but it wasn&#39;t working)...)--So my very BIG hubby comes and they let<br/>
me take the baby home and TADA children and youth come and they have this<br/>
whole paper FULL of lies--i.e.---the baby was VERY dirty and I said that I<br/>
would not treat him ETC...And this investigation went on for months--the<br/>
baby kept having recurrent ear infection---the second round of antibiotics<br/>
made him VERY sick after two doses---I don&#39;t use antibiotics and so I quit<br/>
all the medicine and got some cool stuff (herbal) and that cleared it up!!<br/>
So I finally had to write them a letter and say that Well I told them to FO<br/>
nicely<br/>
AND they did and to this day I ignore them and tell them to get a warrant<br/>
etc....It works!<br/>
But anyways, I know that feeling because my doctor that I use is affiliated<br/>
with them and he uses the same hosp etc...and he has a strong relationship<br/>
with C & Y and he looks at me strangely and so does the receptionist<br/>
etc....BUT I have to use them---I have the low income health insurance...AND<br/>
I just say to myself that I am doing what I know is good for my children,<br/>
but I do want to bawl my eyes out sometimes and I feel like the whole world<br/>
is working against me, but I think I know how you feel---like you can&#39;t<br/>
choose someone who would sympathize---well at least understand a little<br/>
I am sorry this happened to you, it is stressful and then you don&#39;t even get<br/>
the treatment you want!<br/>
The whole time that the DR was examining my child I kept saying &quot;are you<br/>
going to treat my child&quot;<br/>
UGH-----<br/>
Susan--Good luck---<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; I am on digest mode of this list, and have not been active on the list<br/>
&gt; either, for some time, due to time constraints.  I am writing now to ask<br/>
&gt; for some much needed understanding and support(help?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Something happened yesterday, that made me realize my need for support,<br/>
&gt; which will require a bit of background information, so here it is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I live in WA state, and I have been homeschooling my 2 children(ages 8 &<br/>
&gt; 6) for 2+years now.  Unschooling is an informed lifestyle choice I have<br/>
&gt; made for my family.  I am a very capable single mother, on a limited<br/>
&gt; income(disability).  My children&#39;s father is not, and never has been<br/>
&gt; involved in their lives.  They do have male role models, and their<br/>
&gt; absent biological father is not a problem or an issue in my life or my<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s at this time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also have Bipolar disorder(otherwise known as manic depression), a<br/>
&gt; very serious, potentially life threatening(a shocking 15-20% of<br/>
&gt; untreated bipolar sufferers commit suicide), incurable, but highly<br/>
&gt; treatable(medication called mood stabilizers, are a must for this<br/>
&gt; illness) neurobiological disorder of the brain, which affects mood,<br/>
&gt; behavior, and thoughts.  It is also highly genetic and happens to run in<br/>
&gt; both sides of my family(and possibly my children&#39;s paternal line as<br/>
&gt; well).  I had childhood onset type(even more highly genetic) of bipolar<br/>
&gt; disorder, as did my maternal grandfather and a maternal uncle.  My<br/>
&gt; extended family, on both sides, is riddled with &quot;mental<br/>
&gt; illness&quot;(paternal grandmother & grandfather, my own brother & my<br/>
&gt; father).  As a result of all of this, I have educated myself about<br/>
&gt; neurobioligical brain disorders(otherwise called &quot;mental illnesses&quot;),<br/>
&gt; their symptoms, treatment, etc., and continue to do so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son(age 8.5 yrs.), who is very intelligent, smart, and wonderful &<br/>
&gt; sweet, has been showing signs of A.D.H.D. since birth, basicly, nothing<br/>
&gt; for which I am too concerned about other than the fact that ADD is often<br/>
&gt; seen in children prior to onset of bipolar symptoms(a precursor sign).<br/>
&gt; Last year, I noticed some changes in my sons mood and behavior, which<br/>
&gt; had me concerned(he seemed depressed for about 2 weeks).  Knowing what I<br/>
&gt; know about Bipolar disorder and that it runs in my family, I chose to<br/>
&gt; speak to his doctor about my concerns at that time(last spring), who was<br/>
&gt; hesitant to refer me to a specialist, nonetheless I insisted upon a<br/>
&gt; referral.  I could not get him in at that time, since the doctor in the<br/>
&gt; next town refused to see him, and we did not have a psychiatrist in our<br/>
&gt; town then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We now have one (her specialty is even child psychiatry), she works at<br/>
&gt; our community mental health facility, who is also my own psychiatrist,<br/>
&gt; and my prescribing physician.  My sons doctor recently referred him to<br/>
&gt; her, and yesterday was his appointment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went to this appointment, expecting to address my sons&#39; mood symptoms<br/>
&gt; and my concerns about his inheriting the family propensity for this<br/>
&gt; illness, particularly childhood onset bipolar disorder, and what I can<br/>
&gt; and can&#39;t do about that.  Like what can I do to help my son deal with<br/>
&gt; his emotions, what signs should I look for, when to seek treatment if<br/>
&gt; and when...., NOT to get him on medication(I am not even considering<br/>
&gt; that as an option at this time), for ADD or anything else.  I have been<br/>
&gt; told, and have read again and again, in my research on this topic, that<br/>
&gt; it is best to have a child seen as soon at the first sign of symptoms.<br/>
&gt; I have suspected for sometime with my son(he is so much like I was in<br/>
&gt; everyway-and so different from my daughter).  I just wanted some<br/>
&gt; professional advice/opinion, a professional to hear my concerns,etc.,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just can&#39;t believe what I actually got instead and I am infuriated by<br/>
&gt; it.  I am also very confused, because she is my own doctor(my new pdoc),<br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t want my feelings concerning this to interfere with my<br/>
&gt; developing relationship with her in that arena(because I need her to<br/>
&gt; treat me, she is the only pdoc nearby), right now, but perhaps that is<br/>
&gt; being unrealistic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, my son&#39;s appt. was for an hour, and she spent the first part of<br/>
&gt; that time talking to him, while I was in the room, most of it talking to<br/>
&gt; me privately while he played in the waiting room, and about 3 minutes<br/>
&gt; speaking to him privately.  When asked about school, he told her he was<br/>
&gt; homeschooling.  He is kind of shy of strangers, so he was not real<br/>
&gt; forthcoming with her, and kept saying &quot;i don&#39;t know&quot; a lot.  During the<br/>
&gt; time she spent alone with me talking about my son, she asked me why I<br/>
&gt; was homeschooling my kids.  I told her it is a lifestyle choice I have<br/>
&gt; made, and something I thought about doing since Skyler was a baby.<br/>
&gt; (It&#39;s not like something happened to make me decide this or that it was<br/>
&gt; a sudden decision, you know?.)  She kept asking me questions like what<br/>
&gt; grade is he in(I said &quot;he would be in 3rd grade&quot;)?, if I knew what grade<br/>
&gt; level he was at(I said &quot;not really&quot; and was oviously not too concerned<br/>
&gt; about it)?, and if we use a curriculum(&quot;no, we do not&quot;)?, and what about<br/>
&gt; testing, etc.?   I was really caught off guard by this line of<br/>
&gt; questioning, I mean I took my son to her because of my concerns about<br/>
&gt; him having symptoms of a mood disorder!!!???  How in the hell does this<br/>
&gt; have to do with curriculum and testing and grade level?  I am just so<br/>
&gt; angry about this, and I feel I was discriminated against, although I am<br/>
&gt; not sure why.  She obviously doens&#39;t understand about homeschooling,<br/>
&gt; unschooling, or my decision to do so, and I certainly can&#39;t explain that<br/>
&gt; to her in a nutshell in less than an hour!  But, I also felt<br/>
&gt; discriminated against because of my having bipolar disorder and because<br/>
&gt; I am a single parent.  She also asked lots of questions about his<br/>
&gt; father, etc.,  She asked Skyler to list all the members of his family,<br/>
&gt; who lives in his house, etc, and then she said &quot;what about your Dad?&quot;<br/>
&gt; and he said &quot;I don&#39;t have a Dad.&quot;  She seemed very concerned about this,<br/>
&gt; but the fact is that he doesn&#39;t have a Dad, and it doens&#39;t bother him or<br/>
&gt; me(but it did bother her, it seems she didn&#39;t like his answer).  I have<br/>
&gt; told him about his biological father as he has asked, but he is just not<br/>
&gt; very concerned with that.  I&#39;m sure he will ask more questions as he<br/>
&gt; matures.  Once again, other than her asking for genetic purposes, I see<br/>
&gt; no point for her concern on this matter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have followed me this far, please keep reading, because this is<br/>
&gt; the important part of my story.  Now, get this: by middle of our<br/>
&gt; converstation and her questioning, she &quot;professionally recommends&quot; to<br/>
&gt; me, that I enroll my son in p.s., if not full-time, then part-time,<br/>
&gt; because she says even though kids may not want to go to school all day,<br/>
&gt; for some kids, it is actually good for them(even if they don&#39;t want to),<br/>
&gt; because they get to be around other kids and develop relationships with<br/>
&gt; other adults,etc., AND because she can&#39;t really diagnose him as ADD(i<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t asking her to) if he&#39;s not in school, since the way that she<br/>
&gt; usually does that is to send forms/diagnostic tests, etc., for the<br/>
&gt; schools/teachers.  I was so shocked I could barely respond!  She could<br/>
&gt; see I was not pleased with what she had to say, and I just told her<br/>
&gt; plain and simple, that I was not even considering putting my children in<br/>
&gt; ps at this time, that this was not an issue at all with me.  She asked<br/>
&gt; if I ever planned to, and I told her if my kids ever decided they really<br/>
&gt; wanted to go to school, then they would go(they definately do not want<br/>
&gt; to now, I know this, and they know they can if they want).  I also made<br/>
&gt; it clear to her my ONLY reason for concern about &quot;testing&quot; is because it<br/>
&gt; is required by law, but not until 4th grade(am I right?).  She was<br/>
&gt; trying to tell me testing/grade level, etc., was important so he could<br/>
&gt; &quot;graduate&quot; from h.s.(???) and go to college.  My God, who is this woman,<br/>
&gt; and what does any of this have to do with why I took him there?  I feel<br/>
&gt; like I am in the twilight zone here or something, haha!  After her<br/>
&gt; continual questioning and focusing on this &quot;issue&quot;, I told her my son<br/>
&gt; reads way beyond his grade level(he can read anything he wants to read,<br/>
&gt; and does all the time).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I left there with her unappreciated and unasked for advice on<br/>
&gt; school, and that is it, basicly.  What a joke!<br/>
&gt; Finally, she spoke to d.s. privately for a couple of minutes, and when<br/>
&gt; we left I asked him what she said, he told me that she asked him if he<br/>
&gt; thought he would like to go back to school or something to that<br/>
&gt; affect!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What, if anything, should I do about this?  Is this sort of thing to be<br/>
&gt; expected from a psychiatrist?  I am just so shocked.  Maybe I am living<br/>
&gt; in a bubble and this is common discrimination.  Do the rest of you deal<br/>
&gt; with this sort of nonsense?  If so, how do you deal with it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to all who read this whole thing, and thanks in advance to all<br/>
&gt; who respond.  This has really upset me and I feel so alone right now.<br/>
