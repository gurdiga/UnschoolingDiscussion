&gt; Teach arithmetic and it becomes as simple as 1,2,3!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To multiply by tens, open and close both hands rapidly {palms facing you}<br/>
&gt; saying 10, 20, 30,----up to 100.  Do this as a play thing NOT INSTRUCTION,<br/>

skills are so HARD for her. I do not understand why though......... Could it <br/>
be something that they did when she was in PS? I took her out when she ended <br/>
2nd grade. I had to reteach her how to read when I took her out because she <br/>
had such trouble.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe. Maybe not. Most people have had spelling in school but not all people<br/>
spell well.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that most people who avoid math do so because they have had bad<br/>
school experiences. But that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t people who just don&#39;t<br/>
get math. (If you haven&#39;t read anything about Gardner&#39;s 7 intelligences, it<br/>
might give you insight if you did. There should be articles on line and<br/>
Thomas Armstrong has written some popular books on the subject.)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your attitude towards math? Do you tackle a math problem (adding<br/>
scores, figuring out tax and tip and so forth) out loud so she can &quot;see&quot; the<br/>
process and without hesitation. Do you ever eagerly tackle a math puzzle?<br/>
<br/>
What is her attitude? Does she balk at it? Does she shut down? Does she want<br/>
to learn and has tried a number of ways and just can&#39;t get it? It could be<br/>
that she&#39;s internalized that math is some magic process that she&#39;s just<br/>
supposed to know how to do. It could be they jumped too fast from memorizing<br/>
the tables to doing it. If she didn&#39;t catch on that knowing how to do 17+25<br/>
was just a matter of having remembered what 7+5 was and wasn&#39;t something she<br/>
was just supposed to know, then it could be she&#39;s shut her brain down<br/>
whenver she&#39;s seen a math problem.<br/>
<br/>
If *she* wants to try something, there are resources out there. Otherwise<br/>
I&#39;d have a positive attitude towards math (or at least a positive &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>
going to let this beat me&quot; attitude), solve problems outloud, play games,<br/>
perhaps tackle some consumer math that has a purpose behind it, eg, talk<br/>
about credit cards (I stumbled on this:<br/>

into it yet), the stock market (there&#39;s a bunch of links to simulators for<br/>
kids at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.surfnetkids.com/stockmkt.htm">http://www.surfnetkids.com/stockmkt.htm</a> and over to the left is some<br/>
other pages of real world money links for kids), income taxes, shopping<br/>
bargains and so forth.<br/>
