 &lt;&lt;&lt; Here&#39;s something I gave to Laurie...in email and in life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This (the offering to Laurie in your post) was beautiful, Valerie. I hope <br/>
it&#39;s in your book.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; Mindful parenting wasn&#39;t exhausting to me. It was the easiest thing <br/>
 I&#39;ve ever done. If I can offer you one bit of advice... <br/>
<br/>
This, I can&#39;t grasp. It (mindful parenting) is a process for me. First, the <br/>
&quot;seeing clearly&quot; part. Weeding out memes, the old ways of accepting without <br/>
questioning. Then the search for the True ways of parenting, the ways that <br/>
speak to my heart. First comes this work, then contemplation, then action. <br/>
Yes, that part, the act of parenting mindfully, is &quot;easy&quot; in that it feels <br/>
right, knowing we are on the right path together. But without the work part <br/>
-- the questioning and contemplation -- I would still be mired in &quot;old <br/>
thought&quot; ways of parenting, doing what &quot;worked&quot; for my parents.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt; Trust yourself, believe in yourself and have faith that it will be <br/>
 okay. You&#39;re a great mom doing your best. That&#39;s all any of us can do.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who is a teacher at an elementary school. She works there <br/>
because her son is there. She has her master&#39;s in education and helps to <br/>
implement the new &quot;Standards of Learning&quot; tests here in VA. Her son, my son&#39;s <br/>
best friend, was a ball of energy, but having trouble sitting at a desk in <br/>
first grade. This showed up in reading where he was &quot;behind&quot; the other kids <br/>
in his class. (I don&#39;t have to state my opinion of all this crap, do I? You <br/>
know how I felt, hearing it, but I bit my tongue, so that my friend felt she <br/>
could confide in me.) Anyway, three weeks into the school year, the boy was <br/>
on Ritalin or Adderol or whatever. The mom said he was doing much better in <br/>
class, but, playing at our house, he was not the same child. Quiet, biddable <br/>
-- !! Oh, yes, I can see why it would be easier for a teacher to have a class <br/>
full of kids like this. Anyway, my point was -- this mom truly loves her <br/>
child. She did what she thought was best. In my opinion, she didn&#39;t &quot;do the <br/>
work&quot;. The questioning, the exhausting part. When the same first grade <br/>
teacher her little boy has, had my older son in class and mentioned ADD, I <br/>
went to the library, I called friends and family, my pediatrician (who, to <br/>
his credit, sent me some Xeroxed literature on ADD), searched the Internet -- <br/>
until I could put together the knowledge that I had gained with the feelings <br/>
in my heart. Mainly, why would ANYONE drug their child to fit a learning <br/>
situation, rather than change the learning situation to fit their child?<br/>
<br/>
This -- the gathering knowledge part -- SHOULD be exhausting. It&#39;s a <br/>
satisfying exhaustion, though. :) <br/>
 <br/>
 I asked once, over at the message boards, how some of the wiser mommas came <br/>
to unschooling. What was their path? Or were they, like Athena from the head <br/>
of Zeus, birthed from John Holt fully unschooled themselves. See, the <br/>
process, the path it took to get there, was of more help and interest to me <br/>
than talking about the end-destination -- how great everything was in <br/>
Unschooling Land. Not &quot;How to Do It&quot;, but &quot;What Caused You To Seek This <br/>
Path?&quot; Never Stop Questioning. (Hangs in our dining room next to Question <br/>
Authority. :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640496702">I read Summerhill, all of John Holt&#39;s books, Growing Without <br/>
Schooling newsletter, Magical Child, Deschooling Society...uhm... I&#39;m <br/>
sure there&#39;s more... BEFORE Laurie was born. I made up my mind that <br/>
my child/children would never attend school unless it was something <br/>
they vocalized wanting to try. <br/>
<br/>
My parents were such wonderful parents UNTIL I became a teenager and <br/>
my opinions differed from theirs. Their views are very narrow, <br/>
prejudiced and include no room for anything different. I vowed that <br/>
when I had children I would give them more room to grow. I vowed to <br/>
be friends with my children, giving them total respect and not <br/>
belittling any thoughts or dreams they had, no matter what they were.<br/>
<br/>
So, I did my homework before she was born. The searching had already <br/>
been done and my heart, mind and soul knew this was the only way to <br/>
go. There was nothing left to contemplate. Actually, just reading <br/>
that first book, Summerhill...I knew.<br/>

I spent hours/days/weeks/months searching the library, going to bigger city<br/>

All the scare tactics, he&#39;ll never [fill in the blank with hundreds of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476814877">Where were you in the 60s????  We&#39;d have had a ball making little ol&#39; ladies<br/>
faint &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first batch of kidlets (we raised our nieces and nephews for awhile, 10,<br/>
8, 7, 6 and 2) and I use to spend a couple of mornings each week in the<br/>
laundry mat playing games, flying paper airplanes, reading books, playing<br/>
patty cake and generally carrying on.  Ya know, unschooling, just having<br/>
fun.  I was Mamma-Lyn (19) and you should have been there the day the LOL<br/>
brigade was there!  One of the LOLs asked why my brothers and sisters<br/>
weren&#39;t in school.  I said we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school, and being young and having<br/>
a &quot;hippy&quot; moment, I said &quot;all the world&#39;s our school.&quot;  Tony (10) pipes up<br/>
with &quot;She&#39;s not our sister, she&#39;s Mamma-Lyn.&quot;  I&#39;m thinking, maybe I better<br/>
explain that one but they turned their backs on us with that weaned on<br/>
vinegar and using a lemon wedge as a pacifer look.<br/>
<br/>
Well, about then Nicki Jon (6) started asking when we were going home and if<br/>
we could have baby chickens (cornish game hens) for dinner.  I told him we<br/>
would stop on the way home and have Papa (what they called my fil, their<br/>
grandfather) give us some (he owned a butcher shop) so we would have dinner<br/>
ready when Uncle got home.  A little while later, Penny (2) asked<br/>
&quot;Mamma-Lyn, Mamma-Lyn, stories in bed?&quot;  I said, &quot;Yes, Sweetie, when Uncle<br/>
and I go to bed you can cuddle and I&#39;ll read you a story.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Only when I heard a LOUD gasp and turned to see the brigade go stomping out<br/>
the door muttering about &quot;can you image a child that age with children . .<br/>
.&quot; did I realise what our conversation must have sounded like to a bunch of<br/>
old biddies &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Evil and wicked enough that we didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school &lt;&lt;&lt;bewg&gt;&gt;&gt;  My poor fil<br/>
would have died if he had known what they must have been thinking!<br/>

I started with one pan and glass storeage bowls.  Slowly replaced all the<br/>

time he would rave about the taste of something, I would say, &quot;oh, well its<br/>
organic and cooked in stainless steel.&quot;  Or when he stopped complaining<br/>

I am so interested in how you have made all these changes and how you went <br/>
about it. My son&#39; rash was almost completely gone, then we ate some fries at <br/>
the beach, and I let him have a cookie, albeit an organic one from the health <br/>
food store (I read the ingredients and didnt think it would be harmful) and <br/>
the rash has reappeared on his arm. Sooo. . . back to the drawing board. And <br/>
ideas of recipe&#39;s and/or cookbooks and such would be so much appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128643758">Thank you Eileen.  That was so nice and not what most folks say about my<br/>
voice &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I shocked hubby by buying coffee filters and soaking them and then having<br/>
the kidlets use some of those tablets from their chemistry sets to show the<br/>
various chemicals in the water--ya know, water without coffee filters and<br/>
water with coffee filters.<br/>
<br/>
Then I bought some organic coffee and made up two pots and set cups from<br/>
each in the window so he could see the &quot;oil slick&quot; on the &quot;poisoned&quot; coffee<br/>
and the almost total lack of &quot;oil slick&quot; on the organic coffee.  Then the<br/>
kidlets did their thing with the chemistry set again.<br/>
<br/>
Then I bought him a new coffee pot (all stainless steal with no plastic<br/>
anywhere, the old fashioned kind) for Christmas &lt;g&gt;  I mean, what was he<br/>
going to do, throw away my gift &lt;&lt;&lt;bewg&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did the same with the iced tea, only used two different kinds of<br/>
containers.  His old faithful plastic one and the nice new shiney glass one.<br/>
Although it really was more steps than that, first I had to get him past the<br/>
instant iced tea thing, yuck, yuck, yuck!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to glass storage.  It is almost impossible to find any type of glass<br/>
container that doesn&#39;t have some type of plastic for lids.  We haven&#39;t got<br/>
the manufacturers  trained yet &lt;g&gt;  On lots of things I just use waxed paper<br/>
and when I really need a lid, I make sure that no food touches plastic, that<br/>
I don&#39;t use the ones with plastic lids for anything but over night in the<br/>
fridge (they don&#39;t off-gas to any measureable degree in the cold) and<br/>
absolutely no micro waving!!!!<br/>
<br/>
For long term storage I use old-fashioned canning jars, large pickle jars,<br/>
old mayo jars, glass cannisters, etc.  For freezing I use glass jars (don&#39;t<br/>
over-fill or even come close, they explode) or for stuff like strawberries,<br/>
I&#39;ll lay them out on a cookie sheet and freeze them and then wrap them in<br/>
freezer paper.  We dehydrate lots of goodies and those go in glass jars.<br/>
Though why I bother on some stuff is beyond me since they are gone within a<br/>
week (the kidlets will kill for dehydrated strawberries).  The thing about<br/>
canning, freezing and dehydrating your own stuff is that you don&#39;t get any<br/>
sulfites that don&#39;t occur naturally in foods (I&#39;m allergic to sulfa/sulfites<br/>
and it is everywhere and NOT labelled).<br/>

&gt; What sort of glass storage bowls do you use?  All the<br/>
&gt; ones I can find have at least some plastic around the<br/>
&gt; &#39;seal&#39; area of the lid, and I don&#39;t know how concerned<br/>
&gt; I should be about that...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just realized today that you *are* the Lynda on<br/>
&gt; another list I am on!  I *knew* that voice of reason<br/>
&gt; sounded familiar...  ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  he really noticed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; difference in the ice tea and coffee.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Aha!  An area of vulnerability for my dh as well... my<br/>
&gt; first plan of action is now in place...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165254675">I shocked hubby by buying coffee filters and soaking them and then having<br/>
the kidlets use some of those tablets from their chemistry sets to show the<br/>
various chemicals in the water--ya know, water without coffee filters and<br/>
water with coffee filters.<br/>
<br/>
Then I bought some organic coffee and made up two pots and set cups from<br/>
each in the window so he could see the &quot;oil slick&quot; on the &quot;poisoned&quot; coffee<br/>
and the almost total lack of &quot;oil slick&quot; on the organic coffee.  Then the<br/>
kidlets did their thing with the chemistry set again.<br/>
<br/>
***Mmmmm, yum. I _love_ that oil slick on my steaming hot coffee in the<br/>
morning. I know Rue does, also, right Rue? Oh, that&#39;s right...she likes hers<br/>
cold.<br/>

No, I&#39;m not implying that at all. But the idea that a fifty year old <br/>
woman who is walking burgers out to my car would call my six-year old <br/>
daughter a loser was a bit humorous. I have worked in fast food <br/>
restaurants myself.  I have also dug ditches, shoveled hot tar into <br/>
wheelbarrows, and worked with boilermakers. I have come home with <br/>
clothes so black that I had to throw them away. (I do not go to fast <br/>
food restaurants except on VERY rare occasions now btw.) I&#39;m well <br/>
aware of the job not being just &#39;flippin hamburgers.&#39; I can&#39;t think <br/>
of anyone working in ANY profession that I would not have found it <br/>
humorous that they were calling a six-year old a loser. They are <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419395849">i don&#39;t blame you for not wanting meds. My mom was recently diagnosed with irrepairable nerve damage. She will never play the piano again and has difficulty with most things requiring fine motor coordination. The source? Many years of supposedly safe anti depressants.

  &gt; I came to the conclusion that they have become so<br/>

  &gt; and relief for the &#39;magic&#39; answer .<br/>

  Reminds me of the time i went to the doctor becuse I was very <br/>

  I do agree that the comment that the woman made was unnecessary and<br/>
uncalled for.  If a banker or a company CEO would have made the comment<br/>

  The first batch of kidlets (we raised our nieces and nephews for awhile, 10,<br/>
  8, 7, 6 and 2) and I use to spend a couple of mornings each week in the<br/>
  laundry mat playing games, flying paper airplanes, reading books, playing<br/>
  patty cake and generally carrying on.  Ya know, unschooling, just having<br/>
  fun.  I was Mamma-Lyn (19) and you should have been there the day the LOL<br/>
  brigade was there!  One of the LOLs asked why my brothers and sisters<br/>
  weren&#39;t in school.  I said we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school, and being young and having<br/>
  a &quot;hippy&quot; moment, I said &quot;all the world&#39;s our school.&quot;  Tony (10) pipes up<br/>
  with &quot;She&#39;s not our sister, she&#39;s Mamma-Lyn.&quot;  I&#39;m thinking, maybe I better<br/>
  explain that one but they turned their backs on us with that weaned on<br/>
  vinegar and using a lemon wedge as a pacifer look.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, about then Nicki Jon (6) started asking when we were going home and if<br/>
  we could have baby chickens (cornish game hens) for dinner.  I told him we<br/>
  would stop on the way home and have Papa (what they called my fil, their<br/>
  grandfather) give us some (he owned a butcher shop) so we would have dinner<br/>
  ready when Uncle got home.  A little while later, Penny (2) asked<br/>
  &quot;Mamma-Lyn, Mamma-Lyn, stories in bed?&quot;  I said, &quot;Yes, Sweetie, when Uncle<br/>
  and I go to bed you can cuddle and I&#39;ll read you a story.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Only when I heard a LOUD gasp and turned to see the brigade go stomping out<br/>
  the door muttering about &quot;can you image a child that age with children . .<br/>
  .&quot; did I realise what our conversation must have sounded like to a bunch of<br/>
  old biddies &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Evil and wicked enough that we didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school &lt;&lt;&lt;bewg&gt;&gt;&gt;  My poor fil<br/>
  would have died if he had known what they must have been thinking!<br/>

  &gt; lol...try being an UNSCHOOLER in the 80&#39;s.. I had complete strangers<br/>
  &gt; get in my face and tell me I was ruining my child&#39;s life, and WHY<br/>
  &gt; would I want to raise a stupid child on purpose?  The funniest one<br/>
  &gt; was when a middle-aged woman working at a drive-in hamburger joint<br/>
  &gt; told me that I was raising a loser... I always just smiled when these<br/>
  &gt; people attacked me. Now, I&#39;m REALLY smiling...<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; love, Valerie<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; It&#39;s something like being a homeschooler in the 70&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; &gt; and 80&#39;s... so against the mainstream that you just<br/>
  &gt; &gt; have to assume that your stance is going to be met<br/>
  &gt; &gt; with incredulity and condescension because &#39;everybody<br/>
  &gt; &gt; knows&#39; better than you do.  That&#39;s okay, they can feel<br/>
  &gt; &gt; that way... you are the crest of the next wave!<br/>

a french press, but he says the coffee isn&#39;t as good<br/>
that way, he doesn&#39;t like it.  *sigh*  I don&#39;t know if<br/>
I&#39;m going to get him weaned...<br/>

I didn&#39;t know about freezer paper... is that at the<br/>
grocery store, or do I need to order it from<br/>
somewhere?   I&#39;ll experiment with freezing jars, but<br/>
our freezer doesn&#39;t have room for much.  We don&#39;t have<br/>
a microwave, so that&#39;s not a problem!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks...<br/>
