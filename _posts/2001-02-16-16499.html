<div id="ygrps-yiv-310584804">When I checked my email this morning, the first message I opened was <br/>
from a good friend with the subject line reading: ER!!!!!!  Oh no, <br/>
something happened to one of her kids or something!<br/>
<br/>
Oh no, what really happened is that she watched the show ER and had <br/>
to immediately contact me to question my decision to not give the <br/>
baby the HIB shot at the hospital.  Not seeing the show, but reading <br/>
her email and the posts out here, the propaganda would suggest that <br/>
parents who don&#39;t immunize are stupid and have, in effect, killed <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
She also stated that the there were commercials for immunization and <br/>
a news report on her local news after ER about a child dying from <br/>
meningitis & lack of immunization.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her how many drama shows, commercials, network news reports <br/>
or local newspaper articles she&#39;s seen about the adverse affects of <br/>
immunization or the death of a child DUE to immunization.  Or the <br/>
countless times, in the medical experiences of my husband and myself, <br/>
the doctor didn&#39;t &quot;always know best&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the many who have posted on this subject and raised my <br/>
awareness re: immunizations and have encouraged me to continue my <br/>
research into it!<br/>

<br/>
And the fact that a pharmaceutical company was sponsoring the show is a HUGE <br/>
flashing clue.<br/>
<br/>
The same way there&#39;s money in forumula and bottle manufacturing but none in <br/>
LLL (very little in the breast pump industry &lt;g&gt;), there isn&#39;t money to back <br/>
up NOT getting shots, but TONS of money (and factories, research facilities, <br/>
and the livilihoods of hundreds or thousands) tied up in wanting kids to have <br/>
them.<br/>

This, for me, is the perfect illustration of how the greater medical <br/>
community thinks of the average consumer.  They count on most people &quot;seeing <br/>
and believing&quot;.  If Marcus Welby said it&#39;s so....  (I guess ER has taken his <br/>
place, I&#39;m showing my age).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s insulting and unfortunately they are often right.  I respect any <br/>
informed decision about vaccines but most parents simply don&#39;t do the <br/>
research.  They&#39;ll take the word of a TV drama as if it&#39;s message and intent <br/>
is somehow sterilized of fallacy and greed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is what infuriates me the most!!!!!  I came away from ER, after the <br/>
child died thinking &quot;oh no- what if I AM making a big mistake!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had to stop and say- wait a minute, you&#39;re letting a corporate sponsored <br/>
TV show affect your thinking and decisions.<br/>
