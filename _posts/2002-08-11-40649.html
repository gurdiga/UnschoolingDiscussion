&gt;&gt; This said, I just don&#39;t understand any ideal or<br/>
&gt;&gt; moral code that would allow me to be so antiestablishment as to go as far as<br/>
&gt;&gt; having Moly and Jack removed from my home.<br/>

&gt; It ain&#39;t pretty, that&#39;s for sure. The repercussions were certainly far worse<br/>
&gt; than the crime. And i&#39;ve never had any illusions of the state of MA being a<br/>

Thanks, Joyce. <br/>
<br/>
Nobody should have illusions about their state, IMO. And I can&#39;t understand<br/>
why a court case about unschoolers is not appropriate for this unschoolers&#39;<br/>
list. If there was anything that&#39;s pertinent, that seems to be it.<br/>
 <br/>
This may not be the place for discussing the details, but it seems like one<br/>
good place to tell parents and others that there are people in power who<br/>
don&#39;t want us to be free, and are working constantly to find ways to<br/>
demonstrate their power over us. If we don&#39;t work for our rights -- even if<br/>
the restrictions seem minimal -- our freedoms will be restricted further<br/>
until they are all gone. Government hardly ever relinquishes its power<br/>
voluntarily. <br/>
