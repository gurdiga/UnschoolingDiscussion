<div id="ygrps-yiv-279407894">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
Every year I get very frustrated with Mothers&#39; Day. I stay away from the<br/>
shops unless necessary and throw away the junk mail unopened. I just can&#39;t<br/>
stand the message which is pushed at us of &quot;Buy, Buy, Buy or feel GUILTY&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Buy Mum a Microwave&quot;, &quot;Take Mum out to lunch&quot;, &quot;Have you got Mum&#39;s<br/>
chocolates and flowers yet?&#39;&#39;....and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in any of this. I wonder where Mothers&#39; Day came from<br/>
anyway. Who says we have to have a special day to appreciate our Mum, why<br/>
not just any old day? The big winner here is of course the shops. I feel<br/>
like a heretic if I mention this to anyone. My neighbour left the jeweller&#39;s<br/>
catalogue on her bench with the dinner set she wanted circled clearly so<br/>
that her husband and children would make the right choice!<br/>
<br/>
The trouble is, my Mum believes all this in a big way. So I dutifully go<br/>
shopping and wander around in circles, confused and vaguely cross about the<br/>
whole thing. What can I buy for my retired affluent mother that she can&#39;t<br/>
buy for herself? She spends loads of money on flashy-flunky stuff that I<br/>
can&#39;t see the point of. I end up buying something, just a token something so<br/>
that she won&#39;t feel entirely neglected.<br/>
<br/>
For myself, I tell my children not to ever feel that pressure to buy. I know<br/>
that when I am sixty, if not one of my children rang me or visited on<br/>
Mothers&#39; Day I would feel hurt, but I never want them wandering around in<br/>
circles &quot;having&quot; to buy something for their Mum.<br/>
<br/>
So on Mothers&#39; Day here, the boys came in with their home-made cards - all<br/>
very individual and precious. No present, because that&#39;s the way I want it.<br/>
Mothers&#39; Day at house is over in a half-hour.<br/>
<br/>
But then for the rest of the day, I had this kind of let-down feeling. I<br/>
guess I have been conditioned to expect the TV dream of children bouncing<br/>
into the room with large beribboned gifts and proceeding to all laugh and<br/>
toss their heads as though they are in advertisements for hair commercials.<br/>
That isn&#39;t real and I know it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else out there know what I am talking about?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114011407">A long time ago when Dylan was four or five and trying to remember days<br/>
of the week, he asked, &quot;what day is it?&quot;    I said, &quot;Sunday.&quot;   He said,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m a son.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He gave me a little gift on Mother&#39;s day and I gave him one for Son day.<br/>
<br/>
He tells me mom&#39;s have it rough, only one day a year, but son&#39;s do<br/>
alright with one every week.  <br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t get a gift every week, but he gets a &quot;happy Sonday&quot;, and we<br/>
all get to smile and remember.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
