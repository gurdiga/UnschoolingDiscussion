I CANNOT believe people would be sending rude emails about the time <br/>
of conference.  We talk about mutual respect here and such behavior <br/>
goes against the principles we are raising our children with.  I am <br/>
so sorry to hear about your problems with it.  I read and completely <br/>
understood your choice of time.  The reality is, NO time will work <br/>
for all of us.  Good luck planning and I am sure it will really be <br/>
appreciated by those that can attend.   You are making a wonderful <br/>
contribution to everyone here, and I just want to tell you I <br/>
appreciate and respect it.  I, for one, would be SCARED to death to <br/>
take on that challange.  I am way down in Florida, and have no idea <br/>
if I can attend but if you think I could be of some help planning <br/>
than feel free to drop me a line.<br/>

I think you are awesome to even attempt such a feat. I, like Olga, am shocked <br/>
that anyone would have the audacity to be anything but nice to you. I am <br/>
willing to go anywhere to finally see everyone. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t make this <br/>
years conference, so I was thrilled at the prospect of next years conference <br/>
getting underway, in hopes that I could begin to plan now. Of course there are <br/>
dates that don&#39;t work for everyone, but I think the date most definately has to <br/>
work for the planner. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and thank you in advance.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Laura B.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me, me! I&#39;ll share my best guesses and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
NFs tend to be the most empathic of the temperaments. They <br/>
focus on the feelings and needs of people primarily (over <br/>
organizations, institutions and dutiesiow, probably a lot fewer <br/>
NFs in the military, for instance! LOL).<br/>
<br/>
NFs make great therapists, counselors, sales people, actors <br/>
(ability to recreate other people&#39;s characters and emotions <br/>
accurately) writers, missionaries, martyrs, teachers, and any of <br/>
the helping professions. They feel most right with the world <br/>
when they have understood someone else (and how he/she <br/>
thinks and feels) and can respond to that person&#39;s inner life.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling focuses on the needs of the individualwe say <br/>
who the child is and how he/she interacts with the world is of <br/>
primary importance. We are also driven to see congruency <br/>
between what people say they feel/believe and what they do. If an <br/>
NF watches a child suffer through &quot;school work,&quot; the NF is more <br/>
likely to ask &quot;Why is my child suffering? How can I relieve it? <br/>
What is wrong with this situation that it is troubling my child?&quot; An <br/>
NF doesn&#39;t hold a curricula or method as the supreme good to <br/>
be adjusted to. And NFs tend to be people pleasers.<br/>
<br/>
How this works in unschooling may be like this:<br/>
<br/>
Child A is showing signs of boredom, distress or lethargy in the <br/>
use of &quot;X&quot; curricula. An NF mother will be more interested in what <br/>
the child is expressing and meeting that need/feeling than she is <br/>
in fulfilling the &quot;supposed requirement.&quot; That means NFs are <br/>
quick to switch curricula, to dump expectations, to find <br/>
alternatives so that child A will feel happier, more at peace.<br/>
<br/>
Because an NF trusts to her own intuition, she&#39;s also less <br/>
worried about outward manifestations/measurements of her <br/>
children and relies on her ability to perceive. She will &quot;know&quot; that <br/>
her child is fine, but may not be able to rpove it to someone who <br/>
is more measurement oriented.<br/>
<br/>
Many NFs tend to be frustrated by test-taking, requirements, <br/>
rules, organizational expectations and schedules. They need to <br/>
see meaning in what they do to commit to it. They are driven by <br/>
the quest for meaning more than any other drive. Parenting is a <br/>
powerful vehicle for discovering meaning and therefore, putting a <br/>
child&#39;s emotional and mental well-being first is enormously <br/>
satisfying for the NF mother.<br/>
<br/>
NFs also tend to be excellent parents in terms of their abilities to <br/>
hear their children, empathize and exhibit genuine caring. They <br/>
stay truly interested in who their children actually are rather than <br/>
being worried primarily about who they might become. NFs also <br/>
love a good cause and will fight against the traditional forces that <br/>
be to see to it that their cause is well-represented!<br/>
<br/>
I see unschooling as offering an NF a framework for focusing on <br/>
the child, meeting her needs at a primary level and giving the NF <br/>
mother the freedom to chuck obligations that don&#39;t make sense <br/>
to her. I also see unschooling being a good cause for the NF to <br/>
stand for and champion.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, many NFs are drawn to teaching as a profession. But <br/>
NFs don&#39;t thrive in the school system. They are there for the <br/>
people orientation and generally NFs burn out in the schools <br/>
and tend to leave or move on more than any other temperament. <br/>
They don&#39;t like beauracracy at all and happily buck the system in <br/>
favor of people concerns which then gets them in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
These are just some of the things I&#39;ve gleaned from my amateur <br/>
investigation into temperaments (another typical NF hobby. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Laura B.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is a description of the middle two quailities that I think help <br/>
expalin it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****Sensing (S)- Preference for taking in information through the <br/>
five senses and noticing what is actual. <br/>
<br/>
Intuition (N)- Preference for taking in information through a &quot;sixth <br/>
sense&quot; and noticing what might be. ******<br/>
<br/>
It would seem to me that people who are heavily S may never actually <br/>
consider or question the actuality of sending kids to school, or in <br/>
this sense, not doing &quot;school at home.&quot;  Maybe they are more the type <br/>
to &quot;go with the flow&quot; because that is just the way it is done instead <br/>
of thinking about the fact that there may be other ways to do <br/>
things.  (Obviously this does not apply to ALL people, otherwise <br/>
there would be not be any S&#39;s on this group. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
******Thinking (T)- Preference for organizing and structuring <br/>
information to decide in a logical, objective way. <br/>
<br/>
Feeling (F)- Preference for organizing and structuring information to <br/>
decide in a personal, value-oriented way. ******<br/>
<br/>
I think it is pretty obvious that the unschooling lifestyle would <br/>
appeal more to the F&#39;s than to T&#39;s.  T&#39;s would be more drawn (again, <br/>
typically, not always) to school at home.  Grades, workbooks, etc, <br/>
are all very logical and objective and appealing to T&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
F&#39;s are more likely to look at what is important to their family <br/>
(personal, value-oriented) and less at what some publisher thinks <br/>
their children should know.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is interesting that of all the responses (still only a <br/>
very small percentage of members of this group) 26 of 32 were N&#39;s.  <br/>
There were only 6 S&#39;s, and of those, only two ST&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
I am an NT, but I am strongly N and moderately T.  The &quot;intuitive&quot; <br/>
side is what I contribute to my ability to consider unschooling.  <br/>
Then I used my &quot;thinking&quot; quality to objectively and logically <br/>
research it and was able to intellectually believe its validity.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious about how some of the ST&#39;s come to unschooling.  I <br/>
wonder if it is due to them seeing that it is what their child needs, <br/>
as opposed to what may have initially felt right to them.  I started <br/>
with school at home, but it always felt so fake. (The whole 2 months <br/>
that I did it ;)  Living life feels so right.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just find the whole MB types discussion fascinating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303394976">I love at NF&#39;s are about &quot;emergence&quot; or &quot;becoming.&quot;  They ware never ever finished with growing personaaly or professionally.  They don&#39;t measure the world or themselves with numbers, but with exploration of new territory.  <br/>
<br/>
But it also makes us HARD to understand by non-NFs, even our spouses.  They all use a common measuring device and can interpret each other with it.  NT&#39;s and SF&#39;s can converse because they share the outer world.  Not us NFs.<br/>
<br/>
So no wonder we pick unschooling - we are and the kids are &quot;emerging!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This whole response was so well written, thank you for sharing it. This <br/>
paragraph in particular, hit a nerve of mine. When Kass & Kree were in the last <br/>
class in which they attended school, at parent teacher conference, their teacher <br/>
went on and on about Kree&#39;s inability to complete the timed multiplication <br/>
quizes. She had gone so far as to give her a &quot;D&quot; on her report card. Kree sat <br/>
with me in tears and was basically falling apart as the teacher went on and on <br/>
about the importance of knowing these tables. So, being my usual self, I turned <br/>
to Kree. &quot;Honey, please don&#39;t cry. If you want to work on them at home I will <br/>
help you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ms. White chimed in with, &quot;Kree, you are very lucky to have a mom who is so <br/>
understanding. Mrs. Hill you wouldn&#39;t believe how many parents I get who would <br/>
punish their kids for what I just told you.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Knowing this woman enough to know she was trying to tell me I should be more <br/>
upset and consider punishment, I turned back to Kree.  &quot;But if you just aren&#39;t <br/>
ready, that&#39;s ok too, because these grades mean nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ms. White&#39;s eyebrows rose and she asked Kree to leave so we could &quot;talk&quot;. I <br/>
said, &quot;No, this is Kree&#39;s education, so it&#39;s important that she know where we <br/>
each stand. And from where I stand, you haven&#39;t done such a hot job. If, in <br/>
fact, these timed quizzes have been something Kree has been having difficulty <br/>
with, why would you wait until now, at report card time to tell me about it. You <br/>
are well aware of how much time I spend with the girls and with the amount of <br/>
homework you send home, I wonder what it is you do all day in class. <br/>
Therefore, to assume I would be upset in any way with my child, you go too far in your <br/>
assumptions. I don&#39;t blame her for not doing well on your silly quizzes, but I <br/>
do blame you for putting far too much importance on such a trivial thing. So <br/>
I will work on them with her, if she wants to, but if she has been too <br/>
traumatized by the whole thing, why would I further traumatize her at home?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her answer: &quot;Because if she doesn&#39;t get them down, she will be held back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was shocked. &quot;Over the ability to quickly state times tables, you would <br/>
risk a childs psyche and love of learning? Not the fact that she knows them, but <br/>
that she isn&#39;t fast enough to write them? How pathetic is that?&quot; With that I <br/>
asked Kree to get her sister from the swings just outside of their classroom. <br/>
My question was retorical, so when she began to answer, she got the &#39;talk to <br/>
the hand sign, cuz these ears aren&#39;t listening&#39; sign. <br/>
<br/>
Huh!!! It was the following week I took them out of school to live a life of <br/>
peace and joy.<br/>

Maybe they&#39;re not. Maybe NF&#39;s are slightly more likely to answer polls. Maybe <br/>
they&#39;re more likely to take personality quizzes. Maybe they&#39;re more likely to <br/>

&gt; Tory<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tory, NTs can&#39;t be bothered with systems for systems&#39; sake. <br/>
They thrive when they are learning new skills, thinking new <br/>
thoughts and chewing on new ideas. NTs are best thought of as <br/>
tinkerers. They catch a vision for a new approach to something <br/>
and will endlessly fiddle with it to get it to work.<br/>
<br/>
NTPs are ever adapting and learning new skills. They love the <br/>
challenge of adding to their abilities and are the most <br/>
unitimidated of all the types when facing something new. They <br/>
are amazingly good at improvising and adapting and run with a <br/>
rought draft, eschewing the painstaking tedium of drawing up <br/>
plans. ENTPs are verbally adept and love word play and <br/>
conversations. (Typically NTs are college professors or <br/>
scientists and often hated high school because it was drudgery <br/>
and not challenging or creative intellectually enough.)<br/>
<br/>
NTJs are equally taken with ideas but are more interested in <br/>
finding exact systems that work. They like to be in control and to <br/>
find ways to achieve the end result that worksvery comfortable <br/>
delegating and enrolling people in their pet projects and <br/>
ventures. Don&#39;t BS the NTJ. They must have a system that works <br/>
and aren&#39;t interested in anything for the sake of tradition or <br/>
institutional regulation. (Notice that theme!!)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is an endless opportunity to tinker, to plan and <br/>
execute, to creatively problem-solve, to learn new skills and <br/>
ideas. And it&#39;s a place where what works is top priority, not what <br/>
is expected. That appeals to NTs very much. NTs are also <br/>
egalitarian in their approach to others. They aren&#39;t impressed <br/>
with credentials and are just as likely to chat intelligently and <br/>
non-judgmentally with children (as though they were adults) as <br/>
they are to look down on an esteemed adult who is <br/>
small-minded. They have little patience for pecking orders.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve noticed (being an ENFP married to an ENTP) is <br/>
that while I approach life from figuring out people and how to <br/>
enhance relationships, my dh is drawn to ideas and skills that <br/>
make life work. Together, we have a really good management <br/>
team approach to family life. I focus on drawing out the feelings, <br/>
on nurturing the relationships, on creating an atmostphere of <br/>
love and learning while he is ever on the look out for effective <br/>
models of communication, tools to enhance someone&#39;s interest <br/>
in a specialized area and finding games and activities that bring <br/>
us together. When we&#39;re clicking, it&#39;s a beautiful thing.<br/>

But we definitely also have conflicts. These generally come from <br/>
my profound attachment to protecting my kids from pain and his <br/>
need to see results. I&#39;ve had to learn how to adapt to seeing the <br/>

heart. It&#39;s been a good education for both of us.<br/>

And he is a part-time college professor, too, which helps with <br/>
unschooling since he thinks school is a total waste of time. He <br/>
has daily proof with his (as he calls them) &quot;braindead&quot; freshman <br/>
students! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Mrs. White should be slapped silly.  &#39;Cause she needs a lil silly in her life!  Congrat&#39;s on leading the charge in bringing the world back to sanity!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and see my rant (10 minutes ago) on scientific method - I could have included this as the case against metric-ing kids!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
My (glad-you-are-all-here-too & ENFP) thots<br/>
<br/>
Tim T<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When Kass & Kree were in the last <br/>
class in which they attended school, at parent teacher conference, their teacher <br/>
went on and on about Kree&#39;s inability to complete the timed multiplication <br/>
quizes. She had gone so far as to give her a &quot;D&quot; on her report card. Kree sat <br/>
with me in tears and was basically falling apart as the teacher went on and on <br/>
about the importance of knowing these tables. So, being my usual self, I turned <br/>
to Kree. &quot;Honey, please don&#39;t cry. If you want to work on them at home I will <br/>
help you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ms. White chimed in with, &quot;Kree, you are very lucky to have a mom who is so <br/>
understanding. Mrs. Hill you wouldn&#39;t believe how many parents I get who would <br/>
punish their kids for what I just told you.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Knowing this woman enough to know she was trying to tell me I should be more <br/>
upset and consider punishment, I turned back to Kree.  &quot;But if you just aren&#39;t <br/>
ready, that&#39;s ok too, because these grades mean nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ms. White&#39;s eyebrows rose and she asked Kree to leave so we could &quot;talk&quot;. I <br/>
said, &quot;No, this is Kree&#39;s education, so it&#39;s important that she know where we <br/>
each stand. And from where I stand, you haven&#39;t done such a hot job. If, in <br/>
fact, these timed quizzes have been something Kree has been having difficulty <br/>
with, why would you wait until now, at report card time to tell me about it. You <br/>
are well aware of how much time I spend with the girls and with the amount of <br/>
homework you send home, I wonder what it is you do all day in class. <br/>
Therefore, to assume I would be upset in any way with my child, you go too far in your <br/>
assumptions. I don&#39;t blame her for not doing well on your silly quizzes, but I <br/>
do blame you for putting far too much importance on such a trivial thing. So <br/>
I will work on them with her, if she wants to, but if she has been too <br/>
traumatized by the whole thing, why would I further traumatize her at home?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her answer: &quot;Because if she doesn&#39;t get them down, she will be held back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was shocked. &quot;Over the ability to quickly state times tables, you would <br/>
risk a childs psyche and love of learning? Not the fact that she knows them, but <br/>
that she isn&#39;t fast enough to write them? How pathetic is that?&quot; With that I <br/>
asked Kree to get her sister from the swings just outside of their classroom. <br/>
My question was retorical, so when she began to answer, she got the &#39;talk to <br/>
the hand sign, cuz these ears aren&#39;t listening&#39; sign. <br/>
<br/>
Huh!!! It was the following week I took them out of school to live a life of <br/>
peace and joy.<br/>

&gt;It would seem to me that people who are heavily S may never actually<br/>

&gt;this sense, not doing &quot;school at home.&quot;  Maybe they are more the type<br/>

&gt;there would be not be any S&#39;s on this group. :)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;I think it is pretty obvious that the unschooling lifestyle would<br/>

is the most vehement about never going to school. I found very little logic <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If the S personality type (or maybe more accurately, the ST type) are <br/>
*typically* the ones who do well in and like school, it would seem <br/>
they would also be less likely to question the need for it.  If my <br/>
daughter had always done well and had no problems with cow milk, if I <br/>
liked cow milk and never had any problem with it, I <br/>
may never have looked into soy or rice milk.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister is a very <br/>
school-loving ST.  Someone once asked her why she didn&#39;t homeschool <br/>
her boys.  Her answer was, &quot;Why should I?&quot;  (rhetorical question, she <br/>
was not actually looking for an answer.)  We can all sit here and <br/>
think of many reasons why she should, but since it worked for her, it <br/>
seemed to be working for her kids, and it fit her lifestyle, she felt <br/>
no need to consider doing anything BUT school.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The form of the word &quot;objective&quot; that I understood the description to <br/>
mean was, for example, multiple choice or true/false tests.  Tests <br/>
where the answers were either right or wrong.  (As opposed to essay <br/>
questions that are more subjective.)  At least in most of my school <br/>
years that was what I encountered.  That is also what the majority of <br/>
the school-at-homers that I know crave.  Workbooks with red marks for <br/>
wrong answers.  (Again, a generalization, no single description is <br/>
going to fit every person of a certain MB type.  After all, MBTI <br/>
tries to group all the people in the world into 16 categories, surely <br/>
not every person will completely jive with every portion of the <br/>
description.)<br/>

to be a common denominator.  But everyone has different levels of <br/>
their preference (hence the &quot;wimpy&quot; vs. &quot;balanced&quot; discussion.)  Some <br/>
are extreme ST&#39;s and others are more middle of the road.  Maybe it <br/>
is the extreme ST that this would be mostly refering to?  In looking <br/>
at the people in my life who are ST, I find it to be true.  <br/>

  Well, this doesn&#39;t make any sense to me, being an S. I have taken in with <br/>

  There is a flaw in the test.<br/>
<br/>
  It asks a yes or no question, but doesn&#39;t let you know there is another option below in a similar question.  Its a set up LOL!  I ended up contradicting myself in the last half of the test.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m an ESTJ according to the test and I came to unschooling because I&#39;m also a realist and a cynic.  I question EVERYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
  And I&#39;m an activist for change, so i&#39;m not even really a &quot;rule follower, supervisor/guardian type&quot; like the test suggests.<br/>

In the long versions, they&#39;ll ask you the same basic question four different <br/>

<br/>
And sometimes sifting through information back and forth gets better <br/>
information on yes/no than on multiple choice.  If you choose one that&#39;s not the same <br/>
as ranking the four.  But if you ask two at a time, you figure out what you <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75678463">I&#39;m an ISTJ. Bill and I took some of these when we were dating (he&#39;s <br/>
INTP) and found that the S/N and J/P questions were the ones we both <br/>
felt most strongly about (like duh! how could anyone choose THAT stupid <br/>
answer?!?) and differed on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If the S personality type (or maybe more accurately, the ST type) are <br/>
&gt;*typically* the ones who do well in and like school, it would seem <br/>
&gt;they would also be less likely to question the need for it.  If my <br/>
&gt;daughter had always done well and had no problems with cow milk, if I <br/>
&gt;liked cow milk and never had any problem with it, I <br/>
&gt;may never have looked into soy or rice milk. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did fairly OK in school, and it came easy to me. With my older (now <br/>
grown) son I did send him to school and took a very traditional route. <br/>
The thinking part of understanding and prefering unschooling didn&#39;t <br/>
occur until after the gut reaction of knowing how I felt walking into a <br/>
school. THAT was truly terrible, and I couldn&#39;t imagine anyone doing it <br/>
by choice.<br/>
<br/>
We had seven years of knowing we were going to homeschool before we had <br/>
kids, so I guess the idea of unschooling had more time to percolate and <br/>
the ideas of what we really wanted to do and not to do had time to develop.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From all the summaries I have read of the ST personality, that seems <br/>
&gt;to be a common denominator.  But everyone has different levels of <br/>
&gt;their preference (hence the &quot;wimpy&quot; vs. &quot;balanced&quot; discussion.)  Some <br/>
&gt;are extreme ST&#39;s and others are more middle of the road.  Maybe it <br/>
&gt;is the extreme ST that this would be mostly refering to?  In looking <br/>
&gt;at the people in my life who are ST, I find it to be true.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t retake this test this time around, but remember myself as <br/>
pretty strongly sensate. Like I say--duh! Of course I&#39;ll trust my five <br/>
senses. I always used to say on my attachment parenting boards that <br/>
instincts would never have been allowed in my family (of origin).<br/>
<br/>
I find the discussion interesting but somewhat hard to follow as it&#39;s <br/>
difficult for me to imagine what the &quot;N&quot; and &quot;P&quot; people are talking about.<br/>

No kidding about THAT.  I said once in a conversation about 15 years ago that <br/>
it was too bad that in the old days, 50 and 60&#39;s, schools and even <br/>
universities were teaching that humans had no instincts, that all we learned had to be <br/>
learned from books.  A younger friend, not even born until the 1968 or so, <br/>
looked at me quickly and said they were STILL teaching that in college, in the <br/>
1980s.  <br/>

he&#39;s weird.<br/>
<br/>
I always admire people who understand interpersonal relations--the <br/>
description of who ranked was SO valuable to me. I&#39;ve never done <br/>
introductions because it seemed SO difficult, but I can understand the <br/>
rankings now.<br/>
<br/>
I also never understood that you really were required to say &quot;hi&quot; and <br/>
&quot;bye&quot; to people and to acknowledge them as you pass, and it&#39;s still <br/>
difficult for me to remember to do so. As I passed some &quot;hallway <br/>
acquaintances&quot; who were conversing I couldn&#39;t decide whether it was <br/>
worse to interrupt their conversation with a greeting or snub them. <br/>
Aaarrgh. Yes, I would have appreciated some direct instruction <br/>
earlier--but my parents couldn&#39;t have provided it!<br/>
<br/>
My salvation was (believe it or not!) Amway. They are the only place <br/>
I&#39;ve found that actually offeres instruction on actual day-to-day human <br/>
interaction skills, and really changed my life for the better. They also <br/>
introduced my to _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ which is a <br/>
wonderful book on human interaction basics.<br/>
