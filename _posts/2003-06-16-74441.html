<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211772920">I find this form of communication THIN to say the least.  Me, I&#39;d phone them all.  But my wedding was small and special, so not too onerous.<br/>
<br/>
We never send Xmas cards - dead trees aren&#39;t THAT pretty and I live next door to millions of hectares of cut forests.  (Let&#39;s not even go there unless willing to stop using T. Paper too, and I&#39;m not!)  So useless cards with their thin/not-genuine communication - HUMBUG!<br/>
<br/>
For the kids, ASK them if they&#39;d like to do cards.  Grama/other person might enjoy hearing from them, whaddya think?  If they aren&#39;t into it, carry on with life. We only serve up society&#39;s expectations, we don&#39;t enforce them, IMHO!<br/>

I remember my dad always forcing us to write them, and we thought it was silly. Now as an adult, I can see how thoughtless it is for someone (say a bride) to overlook any money and time spent in chosing a gift by not responding with a card. In cases of gifts sent long-distance, a card let&#39;s the sender know that the gift was received. How do we teach our kids to show appreciation for gifts without forcing Thank You cards?<br/>

I LOVE Christmas cards.  I&#39;ve saved every one I&#39;ve ever gotten.  Some years I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My children are older now but have ALWAYS sent thank you cards, just a part <br/>
of their lives.  When they were little it was just what we did a day or two <br/>
after a birthday party, Christmas, or a visit to someone.  We choose a special <br/>
card and expressed our thanks for whatever it happened to be, a special lunch at <br/>
Chuck E. Cheese, a sparkly new pair of PJ&#39;s, whatever it was.  Of course I <br/>
was the one writing them at first, asking what would you like to say to Aunt <br/>
________ or Grandma ________ about our visit or their visit or the _____________? <br/>
 Sometimes THEY wanted to &quot;write&quot; the note, having no clue about spelling or <br/>
order of words so they &quot;wrote&quot; in their two or three year old hand and then I <br/>
deciphered it for the recipient.  One of my sisters still has every little <br/>
hand scribble note they&#39;ve ever sent her.<br/>
<br/>
Just as you say &quot;thank you&quot; to someone if they are brought up with notes <br/>
being a part of the event or process they continue it.  Flushing the toilet after <br/>
you use it is just something you do, writing a note just comes after a gift or <br/>
kindness the same way if that&#39;s how it&#39;s always been.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest graduated from high school and wrote her thank you notes for the <br/>
gifts and cards and money as each arrived.  I didn&#39;t remind her or ask her if <br/>
she&#39;d done it, I did buy her stamps when she asked.  My older boy kept a list as <br/>
his gifts and cards came in the mail and did his thank you&#39;s all at once, <br/>
again no reminders but I did mail them for him.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor complained to the high heavens about begging and prodding and <br/>
demanding her son write thank you notes for the very generous gifts he had <br/>
received.  He never did and finally she did it herself.<br/>
<br/>
She asked how I got MY children to do it, I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; them to do it.  If <br/>
thank you notes are important to you, then just let your children see YOU doing <br/>
it early on as a natural consequence of a gift or kindness.<br/>
<br/>
We always send flowers to our hostess after returning from a visit with <br/>
anyone as well.  My children still do this too.  My sons rarely stay overnight with <br/>
anyone but my older daughter often visits friends from college or a weekend <br/>
with another friends parents at the beach.  My sons might ask that I go online <br/>
and send _________ some flowers because (usually a Mom of a friend) put up <br/>
with them all weekend or cooked for them or something.  My daughter just does it <br/>
on her own. So it&#39;s just a nice thing to do when others have been kind to you <br/>
when they didn&#39;t have to at all.<br/>
<br/>
People like it when you remember kindness.  I&#39;m not saying a genuine thank <br/>
you given in person isn&#39;t enough, for some people it is.  I also don&#39;t think a <br/>
written note is any less genuine.  Are there gifts you are really unthankful <br/>
for?  I&#39;ve had gift that I didn&#39;t like or couldn&#39;t wear or use, but I&#39;ve always <br/>
been able to say &quot;thank you for the gift, it was very thoughtful of you to <br/>
think of me&quot; or &quot;thank you for remembering me on my birthday, it was very <br/>
special&quot;.  There are ways to get around sounding less than genuine if you absolutely <br/>
hated a gift.  Kids almost always LOVE every gift in someway.<br/>
<br/>
So the best way to get your kids to WANT to send notes?  Just have it be a <br/>
part of their growing up years.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a burden to send them but <br/>
just a part of receiving a kindness or gift.<br/>
