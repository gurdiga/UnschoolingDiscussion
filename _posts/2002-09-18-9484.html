depth of understanding. Less critical thinking. Canned answers. Canned<br/>
responses. Canned thinking. Now, who benefits from that? Those in power who<br/>
want an easily manipulated population. <br/>

<br/>
And this is admittedly a side rant but, another thing to think about is the<br/>
lack of the vigorous working class who rallied to change working conditions in<br/>
the early part of the 20th century. What happened to them? Why do people no<br/>
longer identify proudly as working class even if they obviously are? Why do<br/>
working class college students at state schools attending on economic <br/>
subsidies self identify as middle class? It seems a minor thing, after all,<br/>
what class doesn&#39;t want to move on to the next level of economic independence,<br/>
but, to me it is tied to the need of our economy for consumers. What kind of<br/>
freedom is it to be in thralldom for payments on a SUV? And, being in debt up<br/>
to your eyebrows keeps people down and quiet.<br/>

<br/>
Because in the U.S. we really have no &quot;leisure class&quot; or &quot;upper class.&quot;<br/>
And upper middle class is &quot;wealthy but working hard,&quot; so &quot;lower middle class&quot; <br/>
is working hard but not wealthy.   I guess our leisure class is &quot;money <br/>
earning interest sufficient to live on,&quot; but I have friends living in a tract <br/>
house smaller than ours whose kids are in that category, but they can&#39;t live <br/>
big, they can just be lower middle class without working.<br/>
<br/>
Our terminology always says things we as a culture (under the American <br/>
mythos) don&#39;t want to really say.  And with Brit-English culture and <br/>
terminology as a ghostly base, it makes it even worse.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was my point. And I find it interesting to look thorugh the curtain and<br/>
see what isn&#39;t being said. Why was my father (born in 1907) happy to identify<br/>
as working class and now we seem to have some nebulous sort-of-middle class<br/>
with all sorts of clear distinctions based on homes, cars, and salaries, but<br/>
no feeling of solidarity with those who are LIKE us. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is this really true? When what one drives says so much? I imagine there are a<br/>
few big urban centers and college towns where the car one drives isn&#39;t very<br/>
important, and one can use public transportation, but in many places, what<br/>
kind of a job you get or whether you are hired at all is dependent on your<br/>
vehicle and how it *looks*. Now, I&#39;ve worked in factories, in kitchens, in<br/>
schools, in corporations. A few of the jobs used education as a means of<br/>
sorting out the unworthy but for many of those places one&#39;s transportation<br/>
said a lot about who you were and what you could do/be for the company. It<br/>
isn&#39;t any wonder to me that people who live in cheap little rentals will drive<br/>
an expensive car. That car represents how people in the outside world will see<br/>
them... I guess my theory is that it keeps people busy. Busy working to pay<br/>
off their debts, and if they don&#39;t succeed then it keeps them convinced that<br/>
they are at fault. At any rate it helps to keep them un-empowered.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure myself. There just seems to be a real fundamental change in<br/>
thinking. Most of our sharing seems to be long distant and not intimate and<br/>
that is so different from much of the world or even our own history. Is there<br/>
anything lonelier or more isolated than the typical suburban dweller down on<br/>
their luck? <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for rambling,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In a culture (picture any ten or fiften really varied cultures--rainforest <br/>
tribe, desert nomads, ancient Athens, Chinese peasants in the 19th century... <br/>
 ) what is the opposite of being busy and at risk of failure being the fault <br/>
of each person?<br/>
<br/>
What religion or philosophy or culture gives people fault-free lives of <br/>
leisure?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s just part of being human.<br/>
