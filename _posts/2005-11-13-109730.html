<div id="ygrps-yiv-789949778">Hi- <br/>
I have never posted but have been around for some time and I just <br/>
wanted to say that there was a documentary done on feral children.  <br/>
Maybe it was on Discovery I am not sure but if you go to <br/>
www.feralchildren.com there are all of the case studys.<br/>
<br/>
Something to think on and very sad.<br/>
