<div id="ygrps-yiv-638805596">1970-1973 (the year he <br/>
resigned, right?) which would put the Head Start program in late <br/>
60&#39;s. Unless it already existed, and Pat (?) Nixon was the one who <br/>
pushed it back to the pre-K age. <br/>

<br/>
I was 2 in 1970, so began the first *early childhood* program in South Dakota <br/>
~ originally intended for *at risk* children, at or below the poverty line.  <br/>
In the years since, it has become a program for *developmentally delayed* <br/>
children, at least around here.  Early Childhood (now called Early Head <br/>
Start) was for 2-3 year olds and Head Start for 4-5 year olds.  Kindergarten <br/>
is still *optional* around here.  <br/>
