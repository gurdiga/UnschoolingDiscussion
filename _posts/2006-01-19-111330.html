<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192301587">Some of my favorite unschooling days are when we don&#39;t<br/>
even leave the house.  We are sticking close to home<br/>
this week because my daughter hurt her leg skiing on<br/>
Sunday.  After x-rays, we found out it is just a<br/>
bruised bone. But this has been good, and today is a<br/>
good stay-at-home unschooling day!<br/>
<br/>
It started off with a clean house.  I love that!<br/>
<br/>
This morning my girls and I sat on our couch and read<br/>
a huge stack of picture books from the library.  We<br/>
read My Rag Coat and Lentil and Bad Baby and Snap and<br/>
Pinkerton Gets a Rose, and some others I can&#39;t<br/>
remember right now.  We were all in our jammies and I<br/>
was thinking how great it was that no one had to hurry<br/>
off or get dressed or anything.  For some reason,<br/>
nobody got hungry right away so we didn&#39;t eat<br/>
breakfast when we usually do.  <br/>
<br/>
We watched all the Numa Numa videos. (Seamus is our<br/>
favorite, and Sophia makes everyone watch it.  He&#39;s<br/>
famous here.)  We&#39;re going to ask my husband, Glenn,<br/>
to help us make our own tonight.<br/>
<br/>
The girls wanted to get in the bath and we left out<br/>
the bubbles so they could use their goggles and<br/>
snorkle-thingers.  We had planned to go get some<br/>
snacks, but....<br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law brought over some Amish cinnamon<br/>
bread and a starter for us to do our own ten day bread<br/>
event.  Breakfast!  Yay!  We also ate the little<br/>
oranges we all love.  My youngest, Eva, peeled three<br/>
just because she can.<br/>
<br/>
Eva then dressed in her swimsuit and we played like we<br/>
were at the beach and used her huge ball to play<br/>
indoor beach soccer.  Very fun.  <br/>
<br/>
We watched lots of birds gather around the flower pots<br/>
we had filled with seed on our deck.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about our snowman.  Turns out, we need to<br/>
make another because he looks lonely.<br/>
<br/>
We watched a library movie and then I printed some<br/>
coloring pages which the girls liked but didn&#39;t choose<br/>
to color.  We all went our separate ways for awhile, I<br/>
made lunch, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
We had a good mail day.  I had ordered some kids art<br/>
books and history of famous people books.  My daughter<br/>
said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you got all those for $14.00.&quot; <br/>
She was thrilled with the Picasso book and we looked<br/>
at it for awhile.  Her all-time favorite painting is<br/>
Picasso&#39;s Girl Before a Mirror she told me.  We were<br/>
also glad to see a John Lennon book.<br/>
<br/>
My friend sent me a great package today, too.  It had<br/>
a Frida tote bag.  We remembered that our friend had<br/>
dressed as Frida for our annual Halloween party, and<br/>
we looked her up. Oh yeah!  We remembered her<br/>
paintings.  Interesting, we didn&#39;t get a Frida book<br/>
today so I put it on my wish-list.  I also got a teeny<br/>
golden Virgin Mary.  My daughter said, &quot;She *does*<br/>
know you&#39;re not religious, right?&quot;  &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; I<br/>
said, &quot;But I really like Mary.&quot;  Short religious<br/>
conversation followed.  I also got a metal mirror and<br/>
switch-plates, ceramic butterfly and an embroidered<br/>
tablecloth.  (My friend is from Tucson :)) <br/>
<br/>
And then I reminded Sophia, my 6 year old, that her<br/>
friend, Noah, was coming over.  She promptly asked for<br/>
a huge sheet of paper and drew him a pirate ship<br/>
poster with Jolly Roger and ghost pirates and spelled<br/>
the word girl and Noah.  <br/>
<br/>
When Noah got here, they decided to play a game they<br/>
invented two years ago, and they play whenever they<br/>
get together.  It has something to do with super<br/>
powers. That started two hours ago.  When they get<br/>
bored, Noah brought the Klutz bottle-cap craft book<br/>
over, and they want to make magnets and pins and such.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll pick up Papa Murphy&#39;s pizza tonight and chat<br/>
with Noah&#39;s Dad.  Noah&#39;s Mom is in New Orleans doing<br/>
clean-up.  She&#39;ll be gone for nine days.  (Last night<br/>
we had dinner with friends who talked about their trip<br/>
to France and the Tahiti trip they are planning.)<br/>
<br/>
My husband bought a new computer for a new programming<br/>
contract job and I guess we&#39;ll get it set up tonight. <br/>
We&#39;ll have four computers now.<br/>
<br/>
Eva, my little one, is asleep, and I am emailing, and<br/>
life is good!<br/>
<br/>
Its funny, I could keep adding little tidbits from<br/>
conversation or web-pages or books and it is only<br/>
3:27.<br/>
