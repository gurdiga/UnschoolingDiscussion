<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915851905">Hi everyone,<br/>
My name is Melissa, I am a SAHM to 2 year old Karen.  My husband and I<br/>
have made the decision to homeschool for a million and one reasons,<br/>
very similar to the ones you all have I&#39;m sure.  After doing A LOT of<br/>
reading on the different ways of homeschooling, I&#39;ve decided that<br/>
unschooling would work best for us.  But (here it comes) now what?  <br/>
<br/>
My husband is more unsure of unschooling than I am.  He still has this<br/>
idea that we&#39;re going to be sitting around the kitchen table learning<br/>
about math one hour and science the next.  When I try to explain to<br/>
him that unschooling is learning through living....he just looks at me<br/>
like yeah, when do the text books come into it?  :)  But, at this<br/>
point, he&#39;s willing to trust my judgement and go with the flow.  I&#39;m<br/>
hoping to get some support here plus I guess I&#39;m still trying to<br/>
figure it out myself.  I was brought up in the public school system<br/>
and am still wondering myself so....what do you do with you kids all day?<br/>
<br/>
I also have one other question.  We live in the Central Valley of<br/>
California (Fresno to be exact) and I was thinking of attending the<br/>
HSC conference in Aug.  Is anyone here going or have been in the past?<br/>
 My husband works nights and weekends so, in order for me to go, I<br/>
will have to leave my daughter with in-laws over night.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you and I look forward to the support offered here,<br/>

<br/>
For starters, maybe say you want to try unschooling for a year and see how it <br/>
goes.  Then he can have some hope that you&#39;ll go back to structure (if that <br/>
will make him feel better and keep you from having to defend it so hard.<br/>
<br/>
But ask him to NOT poke and prod it during that year, because if every day or <br/>
two people talk about &quot;what are you learning?&quot; and &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you rather be <br/>
doing curriculum?&quot; it&#39;s not going to work very well.  So ask him to go one <br/>
year just watching them be in a rich environment and seeing what they learn.<br/>
<br/>
But talking about it all the time, especially critically, is worse than <br/>
taking the lid off rice while it&#39;s steaming, it&#39;s like chucking in some ice, <br/>
some flour, a rock.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who won&#39;t agree to unschooling forevermore might agree to trying it <br/>
for a year, and by then you have some evidence and experience to ask for an <br/>
extension (if the dad himself doesn&#39;t say &quot;forevermore&quot;).<br/>
