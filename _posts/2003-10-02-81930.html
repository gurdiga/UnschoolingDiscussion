<br/>
Hidden in one of the most remote parts of New Zealand are a family<br/>
causing the Ministry of Education much concern because the children have<br/>
not attended school since 1996.<br/>
<br/>
The mother, father and four children live in a small log house in<br/>
Northland decorated with brightly coloured buoys collected from the sea.<br/>
There is no phone, a generator for power, and a long, bumpy road for a<br/>
driveway that stretches through a forest and across a beach.<br/>
<br/>
The house can be reached only by four-wheel-drive.<br/>
<br/>
The children seem friendly and happy at the house, which is surrounded<br/>
by patches of bush and grass, sand dunes, the odd bach and a wild coastline.<br/>
<br/>
The family are the only ones living on the vast block of Maori-owned<br/>
coastal land.<br/>
<br/>
Locals say the parents rarely venture out and are no problem.<br/>
<br/>
But the ministry is concerned about the children&#39;s education.<br/>
<br/>
The Northland manager for the ministry, Chris Eve, says that after years<br/>
of unsuccessful attempts to get the mother to enrol her children, the<br/>
ministry had no choice but to take the matter to court.<br/>
<br/>
This week, Judge Thomas Everitt found the mother guilty on four counts<br/>
of failing to enrol her children in a registered school.<br/>
<br/>
Judge Everitt dealt with the case behind closed doors in the Kaitaia<br/>
District Court.<br/>
<br/>
He ordered the woman to be convicted and discharged without a fine, and<br/>
that her identity and her family&#39;s identity remain confidential.<br/>
<br/>
But Mr Eve said the conviction did not necessarily provide power to<br/>
force the mother to send her children to school. All it meant was that<br/>
the case was proven.<br/>
<br/>
Now the ministry would have to review options as to how to ensure the<br/>
children were educated.<br/>
<br/>
Associate Professor Paul Rishworth of the Auckland University law school<br/>
said a judge could not make an order that required children to go to<br/>
school and there was nothing in the Education Act that said children<br/>
could be physically uplifted and made to go to a school.<br/>
<br/>
One would assume parents would start taking steps to school their<br/>
children after being convicted of failing to do so. An option for the<br/>
case, he said, could be mediation.<br/>
<br/>
The family, understood to have strong religious beliefs, are refusing to<br/>
talk about the matter.<br/>
<br/>
But a family friend said the couple were hard-working and they did not<br/>
want to send their children to school because they did not like the system.<br/>
<br/>
He said many people living locally thought that was their right.<br/>
<br/>
Other families had not been sending their children to school for<br/>
generations.<br/>
<br/>
Children were instead taught by aunts, uncles and other friends of the<br/>
family, he said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They just want to be left alone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Eve said the ministry did not know what sort of education the<br/>
children were getting because the family had not allowed its officials<br/>
to assess what the children were being taught.<br/>
<br/>
The last record of any children in the family attending school was 1995,<br/>
when two children were enrolled.<br/>
<br/>
This was an unusual case because usually a board of trustees had to<br/>
ensure a child was attending school. But there had been some records of<br/>
home schooling in 1996, so the matter fell into the ministry&#39;s hands.<br/>
<br/>
In 1999, a certificate allowing the mother to educate the children was<br/>
revoked after a routine assessment by the Education Review Office.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These kids aren&#39;t getting their legal right to an education,&quot; Mr Eve said.<br/>
<br/>
Professor Michael Townsend of the Auckland University School of<br/>
Education said it was important for children to attend school to learn<br/>
about the history of New Zealand, its place in the world and their place<br/>
in New Zealand.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is impossible for a family to isolate themselves from the world<br/>
around them.&quot;<br/>
