<div id="ygrps-yiv-992077165">I have homeschooled for 4 years. I have four boys. for the past year we <br/>
have been dabbling in unschooling. But I get soo scared sometimes <br/>
because I feel I am taking the lazy way out. We sleep till we wake up, <br/>
usually late morning. We take our time on everything through out the <br/>
day.And I see everyone else running crazy with there families that it <br/>
makes me feel lazy. I mean, we do lot&#39;s of things. We go on nature <br/>
trips,we are always looking for new things to do and my kids are <br/>
learning great enough on there own(with a little guidence).But I guess <br/>
I still get those&quot; am I crazy for doing this&quot; days. But I still wonder <br/>
sometimes if i should be doing more.<br/>
Thanks for listening to an unschooler who is having doubts!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385807385">My bad.   I shouldn&#39;t have let this post through, as the author only joined <br/>
the list today.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to have been happening a lot lately--not that I let them through, <br/>
but that people join and post without reading the intro or guidelines.   If <br/>
any new member would be willing to write to me on the side (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a>) <br/>
and let me know whether the new member welcome/intro e-mail is arriving I <br/>
would really appreciate it.   It&#39;s supposed to go automatically right as someone <br/>
joins.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Dabbling in unschooling&quot; won&#39;t work as well as really understanding and <br/>
committing to unschooling.   We can help you, but please read a while first.<br/>
