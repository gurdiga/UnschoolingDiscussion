<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683375709">Just thought I&#39;d share this funny story that just happened today, as I was <br/>
cooking spaghetti.<br/>
Kiere is 3 and loves to help.  So she was next to me browning the meat for <br/>
the sauce.<br/>
My hubby in the other room asked if I was leaving the paper strewn all over <br/>
(you have to understand, I ask him this when he leaves stuff out and goes on <br/>
to something else.. yes, we are both ADD..)<br/>
Anyway, getting back to the story, I went in the other room to get the paper <br/>
retrieved and left Kiere stirring the meat.<br/>
Meanwhile, my hubby asks, &quot;Is she okay in there by that hot stove?&quot;<br/>
I told him she helps me do the meat often.  So yes, she was okay.<br/>
I then finished up the paper, walked it to finish the meat up, and low and <br/>
behold<br/>
Kiere had added her idea of spices to the meat...<br/>
A full canister of pepper, just heaping over the meat..<br/>
I started laughing .... she didn&#39;t know why..<br/>
Hubby came in and said, &quot;I guess she is too young, huh, and need <br/>
supervised..&quot;<br/>
We laughed a good one!<br/>
<br/>
Happy cooking and adventuring this week with your families!<br/>
