looking to shake up my current blogroll and my mind some more. I <br/>
also like to read on a variety of different hs methods to yeah and <br/>
naysay - I&#39;d be very bored to just stick to filling my head about <br/>
one method, within one sect and so on - so that&#39;s why on my <br/>

get to reading more unschooling blogs!<br/>

Have you read Danielle Conger&#39;s?  <br/>
It&#39;s linked at the bottom of <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
I add to my website pretty regularly, and to subscribe to announcements of <br/>
new pages or entries, subscribe to the announcements list (link on that same <br/>
page). I send something out only about once a month.  It WON&#39;T fill your mailbox <br/>
up but it will let you see what&#39;s new on that site.<br/>
<br/>
One important thing I feel I should add, though, is you won&#39;t change your <br/>
beliefs just by reading what others say.  You need to see it in your OWN kids, in <br/>
your OWN house, so maybe you&#39;ve read enough and you need to let it play out.  <br/>

The last 3 or 4 entries don&#39;t say much since I&#39;ve been working a lot <br/>
but after that they become more involved.<br/>
