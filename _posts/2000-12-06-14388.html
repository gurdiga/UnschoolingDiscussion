My newspaper had one yesterday titled &quot;Study shows kindergarten benefits<br/>
all youngsters.&quot;  This Education Department study has NO CONTROL GROUP,<br/>
but will continue for six years.  They tested kids at beginning and end<br/>
of kindergarten and found out that they learned stuff!  If you ask me,<br/>
this only proves that kindergarten attendance doesn&#39;t prevent learning!<br/>
