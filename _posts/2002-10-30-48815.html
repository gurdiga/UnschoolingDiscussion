&lt;&lt; I really believe if we have gone to an actual school in our lives,then we <br/>
are brainwashed & programmed to think only one way. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep.  I went for fifteen years.  (no kindergarten, left high school early).  <br/>
That&#39;s a lot of programming.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just always believed the proof of learning was to see it written but <br/>
that&#39;s not true.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s one of the last blocks to fall with many people.  Even people <br/>
whose kids are great unschoolers and fascinating and what all, the parents <br/>
might want them to &quot;write a report&quot; someday.   It&#39;s as thought having a <br/>
solid, substantial THING that looks schoolish will make it all legitimate.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby wrote an inventory and needs report once for work.  I helped him format <br/>
it, and found a couple of things I could mention about grammar.  He was fine <br/>
with that help.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a practice report, though, as all the school reports are.  He was <br/>
actually providing information his bosses needed about the games he was <br/>
managing.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has written up games rules.  That&#39;s technical writing.  <br/>
<br/>
Both of them do a kind of writing we never had to do in school, and that is <br/>
the online role playing games which are run with text.  It&#39;s a little like <br/>
D&D--there are scenarios and each character decides what to say and do.  <br/>
There are some online dice, but they all stay in character, and it&#39;s pretty <br/>
dramatic and artsy.<br/>
<br/>
The closest we came to that in school was a short-answer test.  Even then, <br/>
though, you have time to proof-read and erase and change things before you <br/>
hand it in.  <br/>
<br/>
With these games they are writing JUST because they want to.  Nobody makes <br/>
them.  (Although one night Marty was on Kirby to &quot;get in there and rez some <br/>
people!  We can&#39;t play until you do this!&quot;  (Ressurect some, and record some <br/>
scores, for the people in his &quot;kingdom.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
They write and hit send.  It&#39;s gone.  Maybe one person sees it, or ten, or a <br/>
hundred.  Then someone responds, based on what they wrote.  Then they write <br/>
again.   There is a response.<br/>
<br/>
That kind of &quot;real-time&quot; writing wasn&#39;t part of any schoolwork I ever did.  I <br/>
got speed from taking notes in class.    So what they&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t fit on <br/>
a curriculum.  But it&#39;s better than most of the writing I remember doing in <br/>
school, and it&#39;s real, and live.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She even talks using big words i haven&#39;t taught her,so i do believe there <br/>
is learning going on all the time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Words come several a day to kids her age.  She&#39;ll pick them up from anywhere, <br/>
and once you&#39;ve heard a word used three or four times, you probably don&#39;t <br/>
need anyone to &quot;teach you&quot; what it means or how to use it.<br/>
<br/>
Good, Renee!  Sounds like things are about to be even better at your house <br/>
than they already are.   Welcome!<br/>
