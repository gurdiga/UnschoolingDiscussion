<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350264581">My Life as a Musical<br/>
 <br/>
A moment, just a moment ago. <br/>
 <br/>
Holly&#39;s in Kirby&#39;s room playing Halo II.<br/>
Kirby, Marty and five other teens and young adults are the other direction  <br/>
from me, playing some complicated game with cards and dice in the library.<br/>
 <br/>
I was playing Neopets at the kitchen table, and listening to my iTunes for  <br/>
background.  It&#39;s not on very loud at all, but when &quot;Build me up Buttercup&quot;  <br/>
came on, one of the boys in the next room started singing along softly.   He&#39;s <br/>
not one of the better singers, but was just singing to himself.  Kirby  joined <br/>
in, softly.  Another couple started humming along, but they were  still <br/>
playing their game.   Then I heard Holly from two rooms away,  come in on the second <br/>
chorus.<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t say a word, but wanted to share it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113969723">DD, DH & I are always putting life-situations into song.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
Driving around pot holes, after being asked how they are created- <br/>
&quot;Hole in the road, Hole in the road, Hole in the, Hole in the, Hole<br/>
in the, Hole in the, Hole in the, Hole in the road!&quot; OR<br/>
Our Street Address- &quot;442 What&#39;s-It Avenue!&quot;<br/>
It is incredibly silly & fun, and a great learning tool for all of us!<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, I spent a whole summer playing guitar and singing <br/>
multiplication tables with an 8 yr old niece (now grown with her own <br/>
kids). We kept singing upto only maybe the &quot;3X&quot;.  I don&#39;t believe<br/>
that rote memorization is best, but with her, it became a game that<br/>
enabled her to see the progression of number patterns, like the music <br/>
that she loved to sing. It took the fear of math out of her. For me, I <br/>
remembered having a very difficult time at that age, I even ran away <br/>
from school, after which my mom &quot;threatened&quot; to keep at home and school <br/>
me herself). Apparently more of my stepping stones towards unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Live, laugh, learn!<br/>

Our Street Address- &quot;442 What&#39;s-It  Avenue!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
 <br/>
I made a little song for Kirby, when he was little, to learn our address,  <br/>
because it was on the kindergarten &quot;expected competencies&quot; for the state.   He&#39;d <br/>
known the phone number for a long time.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I was a teenager my mom told me a story about one of her first school  <br/>
humiliations, and it was kind of a stunner because it affected my life  <br/>
negatively, and so I used it to affect my own kids&#39; positively.  She said  she was <br/>
six or seven, and playing on the playground during recess, singing the  days of <br/>
the week the way her mom sang them to her at home.  The teacher  overheard, <br/>
thought it was wonderful, and when they went inside, asked my mom to  sing it <br/>
for the whole class.<br/>
 <br/>
She didn&#39;t WANT to sing in front of the whole class.  She was really  self <br/>
conscious for being poor and impermanent (her family picked cotton and  didn&#39;t <br/>
often stay in one place long, living in cheap little rentals or  worse).  She <br/>
did, but it traumatized her, so she stuffed the whole thing  down.<br/>
 <br/>
When I was a kid I struggled to learn the days of the week just by  <br/>
recitation.  I used to be confused in the middle, because they didn&#39;t make  any sense <br/>
to me.  I asked her, those twelve years later, why she hadn&#39;t  taught ME that <br/>
song.  She didn&#39;t know.  Maybe because she had put it  where she didn&#39;t think <br/>
of it, or maybe because she was afraid it would end up  getting me embarrassed.<br/>
 <br/>
I taught it to my kids before they had any idea what it was about, using it  <br/>
for a tooth-brushing song for babies.  When they only had a very few teeth,  <br/>
I&#39;d do one quadrant with each line. <br/>
 <br/>
Oh!  The tune is &quot;Yankee Doodle,&quot; so if you sing the days of the week  to <br/>
each line of the song, you get four &#39;weeks,&#39; so the whole song is a month  long. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;   So as they came up old enough to wonder about the  order of the days, <br/>
they had that song already ingrained, and when they asked  what a month was, I <br/>
said four weeks, like the song (and usually a few more days,  but four weeks <br/>
exactly in February).<br/>
 <br/>
When they got older we brushed teeth for TWO months, one month on one side  <br/>
and one month on the other.  And if we weren&#39;t really done, the beginning  of <br/>
the last Saturday could be held out for a long, amusing time.    &quot;Thursday, <br/>
Friday, Saa...............turday.&quot;<br/>

When you started into the part about your mom in school, it reminded me of <br/>
something my own mother told me about.  She was a school bus driver when I was a <br/>
preschooler.  I remember riding the bus with her and the big teenage girls <br/>
holding me on their laps like I was a dollbaby.  <br/>
<br/>
All ages of kids rode her bus.  One morning a small kid got on, who was new <br/>
in the neighborhood.  That afternoon, after he got in to go home, she ran her <br/>
whole route and he was still on the bus.  She asked him why he didn&#39;t get off <br/>
and he said he didn&#39;t see his house. So, she drove the whole route again, <br/>
asking him what color his house was, and then again, trying to keep him calm.  Then <br/>
finally on the third time around, he spotted his mother standing in front of <br/>
a blue house waiving down the bus!<br/>
<br/>
Mom asked the boy why he didn&#39;t get off the first 3 times, and he said, &quot;My <br/>
house was yellow!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His mother, having her first new house, had the house painted while he was <br/>
gone at school.  Your story reminded me of that.<br/>
<br/>
I just want you to know, Sandra, that Will knows the days of the week only <br/>
because of the Yankee Doodle song, which you wrote about many years ago.  <br/>

Cool!<br/>
It&#39;s a sad story, and I feel sorry for the little baby my-mom in it.<br/>
And then I feel sorry for the baby ME in it.<br/>
<br/>
But my kids, and yours, they had an easy fun experience because of it,  <br/>
ultimately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573274121">We have a days of the week song too, we sing the days once in english and then once in spanish.  Also songs for the planets, continents, states, etc.  I think it is fun.  My public schooled niece who is 3 years older than my son often asks him to sing one of them for her to help with her homework.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139061881">LOL one of our family funnies,is that our daughter sings about peeing <br/>
and pooping A LOT and has since she started using the toilet. LOL <br/>
And it&#39;s not just random bits of songs, she has made up entire songs <br/>
about it. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve let her see us giggle about it, but it <br/>
really is funny and cute, and evidently she really does know how her <br/>
body works. (the pee song includes a little bit about her bladder <br/>
being full, and when it is, you gotta go pee. LOL)<br/>
