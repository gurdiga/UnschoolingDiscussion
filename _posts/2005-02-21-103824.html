And  growing up, transitions were always especially difficult for my brother. <br/>
  My mom&#39;s description is that he never wanted to get IN the bathtub and then <br/>
he  never wanted to get OUT of the bathtub. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
======================<br/>
 <br/>
All three of my kids are like that to some extent.  Marty,  particularly with <br/>
the bathtub when he was little.  Sleeping--staying up  late, sleeping late.  <br/>
Happy on both ends but little preference for change  just for the sake of <br/>
change. Content in the moment and hard to budge,  commonly.<br/>

transitioning kid is that sometimes all it takes is saying &quot;OK, we won&#39;t <br/>
go then.  Should I call Nana and tell her we&#39;re not coming?&quot;  For some <br/>
reason, the reality of not going isn&#39;t really there for him until I say <br/>
something like that.  Suddenly he doesn&#39;t want to NOT go even more than <br/>
he didn&#39;t want TO go.  Usually he&#39;ll say &quot;oh, all right.  Let&#39;s go.&quot;  Of <br/>
course, I am prepared to accept it if he says &quot;yeah, call her and tell <br/>
her we&#39;re not coming.&quot;  This has not happened very often though. <br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking that maybe this happens to kids because they really <br/>
do live in the moment.  Perhaps some of them just can&#39;t process feelings <br/>
of anticipation or reference past experiences very easily.<br/>

*I* do that. If I&#39;m feeling particularly presssured or obligated to go <br/>
somewhere, it often takes quite a bit to drag myself out of the house. <br/>
Sometimes, having the option of not going is enough to unstick me and <br/>
allow me to shift my perspective enough to embrace the trip.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times when dh has really wanted to go climbing on  the <br/>
weekend while the kids and I would be happier staying home. Just getting <br/>
him to shift his perspective to the possibility of going bouldering <br/>
alone or staying home and playing together on our climbing wall is <br/>
enough to let us begin thinking about all the reasons why we *would* <br/>
want to go with him and be outside near the river instead of home.<br/>
<br/>
I think the pressure and the obligation are enough to make those of us <br/>
who may be somewhat obstinate dig in our heals that much more. The <br/>
pressure shifts the focus of the trip from having fun somewhere to the <br/>
right of self-determination--not a good shift for anyone.<br/>

<br/>
BINGO!<br/>
<br/>
I think the trust thing is lost.<br/>
<br/>
Mine have realized eventually that I was right when I suggested that they go and that they would probably have a good time if they tried it. So I can use that later in negotiations.<br/>
<br/>
Had I tricked and tried to manipulate them, I doubt they would have ended up trusting my opinions and suggestions. They may eventually have decided I had no idea what I was talking about and refused to go or try anything new.<br/>

Last night there was a PBS show on gorilla habitats at zoos.  I didn&#39;t see all of it, just about half and that choppy. But one thing that was very cool was a discussion of giving them as many choices as possible.  They&#39;re unwilling to mate when they don&#39;t have choices in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Animal behavioralists have said for a long time that perceptions of safety and of plenty help animals in the wild to decide to mate or to raise litters/offspring optimally.  So it makes sense that with primates, one of their &quot;safety&quot; issues will be the feeling of power and choice.<br/>
<br/>
Giving them choices is another way we can empower our kids, respect them, and make them real. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914588069">-=-I have also offered websites and book titles to parents and<br/>
in-laws.  Now, they have chosen not to read anything at this point but that<br/>
is their choice.  At least I have offered information. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Last night I manipulated a situation for one half a second. I reached over with my &quot;manus&quot; (hand) and paused a movie, because Holly had come into the room.  It was the bloodily horrible, little Jody Foster screaming &quot;NO&quot; scene near the end of Taxi Driver, which I had never seen and decided to take off into Kirby&#39;s room and watch by myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s lately interested in Robert DeNiro, so I had earlier shown her a pleasant, happy scene with him and Jody Foster, mentioned that they&#39;re considered two of the best American actors, and there they were young and together.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want Holly to have that bloody picture in her head, especially out of context.  She asked me something, and I said I was sorry she had even seen THAT much, and turned to her in such a way that she wasn&#39;t looking at the screen anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t being sneaky about watching that movie, and I didn&#39;t know how loud and bloody it would get.  Holly really trusts me about movies and other things, though, because of years and years of my being honest with her, and compassionate when she insisted anyway, and willing to let her sleep with me if she was scared, and willing to help her talk through her concerns and fears and expressions of regret.<br/>
<br/>
That can all apply to karate lessons and playdates too, I think.  Trust is trust, separate from other things.  It&#39;s one measure of the relationship between two people, and maybe it&#39;s the main part.  So parents who have been manipulative or dishonest can change direction just a little, and avoid that in the future.  But first they have to see it, and so I think this conversation is probably useful to a few lurkers and will be helpful to some in the future who wander in there and find it in the archives, too.<br/>
