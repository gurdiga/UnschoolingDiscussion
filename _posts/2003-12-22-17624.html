<div id="ygrps-yiv-422529152">Hi everyone.  I hope your holidays are going well.  I have a question <br/>
for all of you.  Dh and I are  planning to go to Florida for the first <br/>
two weeks of January (we&#39;re in NY).  My mom called me tonight almost <br/>
hysterical because she saw on the news that another little girl, age 4, <br/>
died from the flu.  She said we really shouldn&#39;t go on vacation because <br/>
none of us, especially the girls (ages 7, 5, 3, and 1) have had flu <br/>
shots.  Instinctively, I  feel we should stay home, for that and <br/>
finances, but dh desperately needs a vacation due to mental health <br/>
reasons.  What would all of you suggest?  Those of you in Florida, what <br/>
are your flu stats?   I expect we&#39;ll go, but I am really worried about it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your advice,  Heidi</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275581213">hello Heidi florida here. this flu is nationwide. you have just as <br/>
much a chance catching it where you are! its widespread everywhere. <br/>
so please dont feel that just because you may come to florida your <br/>
chances are higher because there not. if your immune systems are <br/>
built up strong your chances of not getting it are definitely much <br/>
higher wherever your at. there are MANY who get the flu right after <br/>
taking it. (do you take health products) our family is 100% <br/>
holistic/alternative health. I know there are others on this group <br/>
alike also. if you need any advice ways to build your immune system <br/>
please ask us. take care!! BTW its always a good idea to follow your <br/>
intincts anyway. : ) peace, Sonja<br/>
<br/>
PS. BEWARE of the flumist..it carries 3 live strains of the flu!! <br/>
if your considering it PLEASE reconsider. (hospital employees are <br/>
being told if they are going to take the flumist it is mandatory <br/>
that they stay home for 3 weeks before returning to work!) <br/>

I find this little fact rather alarmist.  There&#39;s a good reason hospital <br/>
workers should be careful with Flumist, and it&#39;s not because the vaccine is so <br/>
dangerous to them.  It&#39;s dangerous to the very sick people that they care for in <br/>
their jobs.  <br/>
<br/>
From www.snopes.com:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But even for the healthy 5- to 49-year-olds, the spray vaccine poses a risk, <br/>
if not to them, then to those they come into contact with. In a few <br/>
instances, those who receive this live vaccine will as a consequence spread it to <br/>
others, so FluMist isn&#39;t recommended for people who take care of or live with <br/>
either the elderly or those at risk of severe flu complications. The live virus can <br/>
be transmitted to others by way of coughing, sneezing, or talking, or via a <br/>
fomite, an item touched by someone who has the virus. (Common cold, flu, and <br/>
stomach viruses can live on the fingertips for hours, and they can survive on <br/>
the surfaces of objects for days.) &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28709084">Sorry everyone...I forgot to mention we&#39;d definitely be driving to <br/>
Florida.  I do feel that if we use things like Purell hand sanitizer a <br/>

children dying, especially healthy ones who are dead within days.  But <br/>
we are all healthy and we&#39;ll just have to do our best to stay that way. <br/>
 Getting out of the crowded New York winter rooms would have to help a <br/>
little.  We really need a little heat and sunshine in our lives.  We&#39;ll <br/>
be staying with dh&#39;s parents, which can be stressful, but also means mil <br/>
will babysit so we can go to dinner and the beach til midnight.  Dh and <br/>
I desperately NEED that!<br/>

Thank you all for your advice.  Happy Holidays.  Heidi<br/>

all states.  I don&#39;t think limiting travel will necessarily lower your risk of <br/>
getting it.  My advice would be to go if your finances allow.  Practice good <br/>
hygiene with lots of handwashing, good nutrition, and staying away from people <br/>
who are sick.<br/>

Also, it&#39;s not too late to get a flu vaccine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486391600">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m just really worried about it&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why?  People die from flu EVERY year.  The media has a very sad way of<br/>
taking a little blip and turning it into a huge mountain.  I take everything<br/>
from the media with a grain of salt.  It is their job to get you to follow<br/>
more media stories.  The best way to do that is to keep a crisis going.<br/>
<br/>
Someone in your family is much more likely to die in a car crash going to<br/>
the grocery store than to die from the flu.  But I bet you still go buy<br/>
groceries.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry......didn&#39;t mean to rant but the media makes me nuts.<br/>
<br/>
If you are really concerned, take along some of that handwash gel that you<br/>
don&#39;t need to wash off and just do everybodies hands several times a day.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone.  I hope your holidays are going well.  I have a question<br/>
&gt; for all of you.  Dh and I are  planning to go to Florida for the first<br/>
&gt; two weeks of January (we&#39;re in NY).  My mom called me tonight almost<br/>

&gt; died from the flu.  She said we really shouldn&#39;t go on vacation because<br/>
&gt; none of us, especially the girls (ages 7, 5, 3, and 1) have had flu<br/>
&gt; shots.  Instinctively, I  feel we should stay home, for that and<br/>
&gt; finances, but dh desperately needs a vacation due to mental health<br/>
&gt; reasons.  What would all of you suggest?  Those of you in Florida, what<br/>
&gt; are your flu stats?   I expect we&#39;ll go, but I am really worried about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235409040">hello tuck. I agree its out of concern not to infect others. but <br/>
what is ALARMING to me is this also means ANYONE taking the flumist, <br/>
hospital emplyoee or not, could have a chance of infecting others no <br/>
matter where they go out in public or what their occupation is. <br/>
children & elderly are everywhere, and you dont have to be in that <br/>
age bracket to contract it, anyone is susceptible. anyone out there <br/>
could have a lower immune system, age doesnt matter. people already <br/>
sick w/whatever go out in public ALL the time and they would be a <br/>
real easy target for contracting it. the vague warning their giving <br/>
the general public is NOT enough. the same warning the hospital <br/>
staffs are being given should be the publics warning also! but as <br/>
usual they purposely dont want to alarm the public. hmm..even though <br/>
it could save lives. my reason for passing that bit of info on is <br/>
because MANY people dont know about it and its EXTREMELY important. <br/>
IMO (and others) those considering taking anything w/live strains, <br/>
especially like the amount in the flumist, definitely need to know <br/>
the REAL facts so their decision can be basd on truth. peace to all <br/>
and hoping everyone and their families stay healthy!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481548013">In my opinion you are just as well off without the vaccine because <br/>
most are saying it doesn&#39;t contain (vaccinate against) many of the <br/>
strains that are causeing the flu now. The best thing you can do for <br/>
your family is to keep a close eye on flu like symptoms and if they <br/>
do come down with it then call your doc for the medicine that makes <br/>
the flu shorter and less severe. So if I were you I would go about <br/>
my plans as usual. <br/>
     Now about the not enforcing a bedtime - WHY??? Your kids do not <br/>
need you to help them sleep and you being there probably actually <br/>
keeps them from sleeping well. It is not against the unschooling <br/>
train of thought to insist that your children be in their rooms by a <br/>
certain time each night. We have done this since the beginning with <br/>
our son and have never had a problem. We remind him about 7 <br/>
everynight that it is about time for bed, he knows the routine that <br/>
he needs to get his pjs on and clean up whatever he&#39;s working on (he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to put away stuff he wants to work on the next day but <br/>
he can&#39;t have toys everywhere) then he picks out a story for me <br/>
himself and dad, goes potty, brushes teeth etc. If he is not ready <br/>
by 7:30 then no stories and he has to put himself to bed and we do <br/>
only hugs and kisses, but ususually he is so we get to read the <br/>
stories and then do hugs and kisses. After we leave for the night he <br/>
is free to do whatever he wishes as long as he stays in his room, we <br/>
explain that this is Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s time to have some quiet time <br/>
and get ready for bed ourselves and he should only interupt us if it <br/>
is an emergency. We allow the light in his room to stay on because <br/>
he likes it that way. Sometimes he reads to himself, sometimes he <br/>
does a puzzle, etc. whatever he can understand that this is his <br/>
getting to bed time and not to disturb Mom and Dad, sometimes he <br/>
goes right to sleep - but it is his choice and usually within an <br/>
hour he is fast asleep. Since we have done this as he has grown up <br/>
(he&#39;s almost 6 now) it was very easy for us. I can see how your dh <br/>
could easily be stressed by the situation - I think I would be <br/>
also!!! Why not have a family meeting and come to a good agreement <br/>
on a bedtime, a time for the children to remain in their rooms and <br/>
get ready for sleep in their own way. Perhaps letting them <br/>
understand how to put themselves to sleep is a gift you could give <br/>
them now, and the gift to your family would be a stronger <br/>
relationship between you and your dh. Remember that freedom is no <br/>
longer freedom when it infringes on the rights of others. Good luck! <br/>

&lt;&lt;      Now about the not enforcing a bedtime - WHY??? Your kids do not <br/>
<br/>
need you to help them sleep and you being there probably actually <br/>
<br/>
keeps them from sleeping well. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have always, since they were babies, before we had any inkling we <br/>
would be homeschooling, gone to sleep when they were sleepy.  They needed my help <br/>
when they were nursing, because they nursed to sleep.  The needed my help <br/>
when I read or sang to them, when they wanted me to.  They needed my help to make <br/>
them a bed.  But they didn&#39;t need my help to say &quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; because every <br/>
single night, they went to sleep at some point, when they were sleepy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;you being there probably actually <br/>
<br/>
keeps them from sleeping well&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not a family bed advocate. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When babies sleep with their parents, it can be longer before they want to <br/>
sleep alone.  Mine all want to sleep alone now, but there were times for all of <br/>
them when they preferred to sleep with someone else.  Because they had <br/>
choices, we know they are sleeping alone now from choice, not because they gave up or <br/>
because they resent us and want us away from them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is not against the unschooling <br/>
<br/>
train of thought to insist that your children be in their rooms by a <br/>
<br/>
certain time each night.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might be against the attachment parenting train of thought, and for some <br/>
families there&#39;s not a difference.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If he is not ready <br/>
<br/>
by 7:30 then no stories and he has to put himself to bed and we do <br/>
<br/>
only hugs and kisses&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s more punitive than our family would ever have been comfortable with.  <br/>
That seems plainly &quot;training,&quot; and not offering choices in the most open, <br/>
positive way.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps letting them <br/>
<br/>
understand how to put themselves to sleep is a gift you could give <br/>
<br/>
them now, and the gift to your family would be a stronger <br/>
<br/>
relationship between you and your dh. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t &quot;put themselves to sleep.&quot;  Neither do I.  I fall asleep happy. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I was little, going to bed was often an unhappy thing, a <br/>
feeling-mom-is-mean thing, a scary thing, and a punitive-feeling thing.  I never wanted that <br/>
for my children, and they&#39;ve never had it.  Yet they sleep!<br/>
<br/>
All my children put together have had fewer nightmares than I had in any <br/>
single year of my childhood from the time I was seven or so.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Remember that freedom is no <br/>
<br/>
longer freedom when it infringes on the rights of others.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It has never seemed fair to me when parents claim many more freedoms than <br/>
their children have.  Adult understanding and compassion should be larger by far <br/>
than child-understanding and compassion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh man did that bring back a memory....wow.<br/>
<br/>
My mom, as I said earlier, was a &quot;because I said so person&quot;.  Bedtime was one <br/>
of those.  8:30 on a school night.  The LR was just below my brother&#39;s and my <br/>
bedrooms.  Our rooms were the only rooms upstairs and they were each on one <br/>
side of the stair landing.  If my brother and I were not sleepy we would try to <br/>
quietly talk across.  We were allowed to leave the doors open.  But sometimes <br/>
my mom would hear us and you could hear her feet pounding on the stairs and <br/>
she would come up to spank us for talking.  <br/>
<br/>
I also remember being home when she died.  My dh, I and our 2 boys slept in <br/>
my old bedroom, although it now had a bigger bed.  My brother and his family <br/>
slept in his old room.  Every time I heard my brother climbing those stairs my <br/>
heart would race and a feeling of panic would come over me.  Just that sound <br/>
brought back all those old memories of my mother.  <br/>
<br/>
I never want anything like that attached to me, as a mother.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812631860">Sandra,   YES, YES, YES.  To all of it.  We used to have an enforced <br/>
bedtime, which took about 1, 1/2 hours of fussing, crying, etc. and I <br/>
always ended up in everyones bed at some point during the night anyway.  <br/>
In the last six months of us all sleeping together, we are all SO rested <br/>
and get along so much better.  I know the girls trust me more and we&#39;re <br/>
all healthier for getting the rest we need.  Plus it&#39;s just darn fun to <br/>
cuddle up with them now and talk about whatever.  Sometimes, I feel like <br/>
I did at a sleepover with my friends when I was a kid.  We keep saying <br/>
we&#39;d better go to sleep and then one of us will come up with something <br/>
else to talk about.  We laugh.  We hold hands.  I know they won&#39;t be <br/>
sleeping with me, but I hope we always share secrets, feelings, and <br/>
laughter long into the night as we get older together. Getting to be <br/>
with my girls and being their friend is breathtaking.  Dh and I will <br/>
work things out somehow because we love each other, but even he <br/>
understands that at this point in the children&#39;s lives, their needs come <br/>
first.  I&#39;m a firm believer that everything is possible if you think <br/>
long enough and are willing to try hard enough.   And last week, Elysia <br/>
(5 yrs) told me that she can&#39;t remember the last time she&#39;s had a <br/>
nightmare.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Okey - let me just set the record straight here - we don&#39;t have <br/>
bedtimes but we have an approximate time that after which ds is <br/>
expected to stay in his room (or thereabouts he knows he can get a <br/>
drink or go to the bathroom, etc) so we can all have some getting <br/>
ready for bed time. I can understand the family bed (although we <br/>
didn&#39;t practice it) up until about 2 years of age and then it&#39;s just <br/>
not needed for most children, if any of you ever slept with my son <br/>
past the age of 2 then you would likely get kicked out of bed by all <br/>
his kicking about, elbow to the nose, etc. definately a lively <br/>
sleeper and always has been. I would get no sleep at all! <br/>
Understandably if my ds is scared of something or something is <br/>
really bothering him he will come to me and tell me about it, (and <br/>
if it is the case that he needs to fall asleep in our arms then so <br/>
be it, although that is rare and usually only when sick or something <br/>
abnormal happening) As far as punishment the only kind of punishing <br/>
we allow with our son is that of the natural consequences kind. If <br/>
you have a child under the age of 1 then no one can expect much <br/>
sleeping time, but after that you get a routine going so that <br/>
everyones life can fit together, when the child gets up at a routine <br/>
time then they are usually sleepy at a routine time. If the father <br/>
is in need of more time with the mother then that is something to be <br/>
addressed and not shoved aside as well, I understand unreasonable <br/>
requests on time but having the children develop their own sleeping <br/>
routine that fits into the family schedule is not an unreasonable <br/>
request. Most of the time my dh&#39;s day starts between 5-5:30and my ds <br/>
likes to be up to tell and hug him goodbye so you can seen that <br/>
starting our bedtime at 7ish is what is needed here and works for <br/>
everyone. If my ds were to be up in the middle of the night which is <br/>
very rarely the case (usually with a sickness as I noted earlier) <br/>
then usually a simple reminder that the other people in the house <br/>
are sleeping and need some quiet time is enough, or perhaps if there <br/>
was something that you needed to do the next day you could remind <br/>
the child of the need to be rested and that mom/dad need rest also <br/>
or they could oversleep and miss the important event, we use the <br/>
truth as reasoning here - we don&#39;t use &quot;because I said so&quot; to <br/>
explain things. As far at tears and fits we have not seen any, <br/>
sometimes my ds asks to leave the door open although nowdays he <br/>
likes to have the door closed, but it&#39;s his decision, he&#39;s not being <br/>
forced to go to bed, only that this is the time for him to be in his <br/>
room getting prepared to sleep, sometimes he plays with toys for <br/>
awhile, puts together a puzzle, sometimes he goes right to sleep. He <br/>
definately doesn&#39;t see bedtime as a punishment! We do hugs and <br/>
kisses everynight and stories on the nights that he wants to - again <br/>
I see nothing punitive there??? Now obviously what works for one <br/>
family doesn&#39;t work for every family I was only making a suggestion <br/>
to try and help out the person who origionally made the post.</div>

Personally I totally disagree with that statement, I think most children <br/>
would do much better if they shared sleep with their parents for much <br/>
longer than two years, until they self weaned, so to speak, from the <br/>
family bed. <br/>

the age of 2.<br/>
For my children they will decide when they are ready to sleep on their own or <br/>

What if he wants to stay up until 9:30 and then have a story?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re punishing him by not reading him a story if he doesn&#39;t go to his room early enough to suit you. The &quot;choice&quot; you say you&#39;re giving him is a false one - he can choose to do what you want or be punished. <br/>
<br/>
If Rain asks me to read to her and it&#39;s really late and I&#39;m tired, sometimes I&#39;ll tell her not now, in the morning, and usually that&#39;s okay. Otherwise we negotiate - once it worked out that her reading to me instead of me reading to her was okay, too, and so she read me the first chapter of Artemis Fowl and got me hooked :)<br/>
<br/>
But see, it&#39;s not her doing what I tell her to do, it&#39;s both of us working together to find a way of doing things that works for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
And she&#39;ll be 11 next month, and sometimes we still have a family bed. There are ways to mitigate the kick-factor - sticking two large dogs on top of her actually has done wonders for her blanket-pulling tendencies, but each of us having our own blankets worked too.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I can understand the family bed (although we <br/>
<br/>
didn&#39;t practice it) up until about 2 years of age and then it&#39;s just <br/>
<br/>
not needed for most children &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which child will be helped by such a statement about &quot;most children&quot;?<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter how many other children are hungry when my child is hungry.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter how many other children can read when my child isn&#39;t ready <br/>
to read.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter how many other children someone would like to think don&#39;t <br/>
need to be with their mom at the moment when my child DOES need to be with me.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t criticism of the quiet-time recommended, but just of that one <br/>
statement, and the possible thoughts behind it.<br/>
<br/>
I think it can be very difficult for a parent to relax about timeframes for <br/>
learning to read or to do things independently or when children can figure out <br/>
how to wake up on their own for work if the parents are pretty sure they know <br/>
when a child is too old to need to be with his parents.  And two years old <br/>
isn&#39;t the age kids can run, or are potty trained, or can speak clearly, or know <br/>
their phone numbers.  But a few might.  And some might not even be walking or <br/>
talking.  And for any one of them, &quot;most&quot; can&#39;t help but could be used to hurt.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, this is so profound!  It&#39;s like we really need to dig deeply into<br/>
what&#39;s going on underneath our actions/thoughts/beliefs so we can clearly<br/>
see and relax into the beauty of it all.  On the surface, we may think we<br/>
are helping... but really we are just getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
I think it can also be very difficult for the child to figure out their own<br/>
timing and readiness when they are being told, even if unconsciously, that<br/>
they are or are not ready for something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I remember once when my dd was just learning to walk and we were visiting<br/>
my brother.  My dd decided to stand up, walk a little bit, and then take<br/>
her first step downward (about 2 inches) onto the outside porch.  She<br/>
walked over to the house to hold on to the edge, and started the downward<br/>
motion.  My SIL saw her and called out &quot;be careful&quot; in a loving way.  My dd<br/>
immediately sat down, and didn&#39;t walk for the rest of our 2 day visit.<br/>
Here my SIL thought she was being helpful... expressing her concern for my<br/>
dd.  Her tone wasn&#39;t negative, or worried, but very matter of fact and<br/>
loving.  But, my in that moment my dd lost her own internal confidence that<br/>
she was ready to do this new move.<br/>
<br/>
It was much easier for me to see things like this with my dd when she was<br/>
really little.  Now I find it much trickier.  For example, I just caught<br/>
myself this morning making an assumption.  She wanted to play a computer<br/>
doll creating program that she hasn&#39;t played in several months.  This time<br/>
she wasn&#39;t willing to do many of the things she did totally on her own the<br/>
last time she played, all of them related to reading and typing in doll<br/>
names.  My first internal response was &quot;of course you can do this... you<br/>
did it several months ago&quot;, but then I caught myself and realized that for<br/>
whatever reason she wasn&#39;t ready to handle it today.  But what was really<br/>
helpful was for me to realize that the underlying reason I was resistant in<br/>
the first place is because she was asking for my help at a time that wasn&#39;t<br/>
good for me... it was much &quot;easier&quot; to just say - oh, you can do it.  But<br/>
in the long run, this isn&#39;t easy at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m really rambling now.  Thanks for listening.  I&#39;ve been reading on<br/>
this list for several months now, and I think little things are starting to<br/>
sink in.  Thanks to all the old-time unschoolers for your willingness to<br/>
share and help us newcomers dig deeper.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays<br/>

How can one understand something one hasn&#39;t practiced?  Perhaps it is more accurate to say that one has heard about the family bed than to say one understands it.<br/>

good point, Mary Ellen.  I mean, I have heard about people who withhold stories and let children cry themselves out, but I cannot understand whatever would possess someone to subject their child to such treatment.  I&#39;ve never had the whatever it takes to do that to my children.  They&#39;re young for such a short time -- at least to our perspective -- to theirs a night of crying alone is a huge chunk of time, and not quickly forgotten.<br/>
