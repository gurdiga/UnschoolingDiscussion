<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152878408">&quot;I have come to see that all children are born equal: full of<br/>
vitality, enthusiasm, curiosity, love, intelligence. It is a world of<br/>
abuse brought on by adults in the form of parents, school teachers and<br/>
others that neglect and thwart the child&#39;s bright spirit that makes<br/>
one dull, mediocre, depressed, helpless.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think what Barb meant (correct me if I&#39;m wrong Barb) is that all<br/>
people are not born with equal amounts of the positive, nor equal<br/>
traits, but ALL children have those wonderful qualities and a bad<br/>
environment is what squashes those positive traits.<br/>
<br/>
Because I doubt she really meant that all people are born with equal<br/>
intelligence and such.  ?? They are equal in that they are AlL born<br/>
with those traits.  There&#39;s always the caveat of severe brain damage<br/>
though, and those children aren&#39;t born with all of the positive traits<br/>
listed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing about foster care, is there has often been physical damage<br/>
or other issues at play you might not know about. My brother had FAS,<br/>
something that happens in the womb and sometimes no amount of nurture<br/>
can overcome that.<br/>
I think RU has the best chance for helping those children heal though.<br/>
My brother got the whole Ritalyn, schooling crap and whether or not<br/>
that&#39;s a cause, it sure was a contributing factor in his life<br/>
today...which is all about prison at this point.<br/>
<br/>
My other two adopted sibs had abuse issues when they came to live with<br/>
us, they live somewhat dysfuntional lives today...sadly. One more so<br/>
than the other.<br/>
<br/>
If I were going to choose foster care or adoption, I would be sure to<br/>
only get children that were younger than my own children. Messing up<br/>
the whole birth order thing ended up being really a difficult dynamic<br/>
in our family.<br/>

My brother got the whole Ritalyn, schooling  crap and whether or not<br/>
that&#39;s a cause, it sure was a contributing factor  in his life<br/>
today...which is all about prison at this  point.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
We are foster parents, and have adopted 3 of our foster kids, and are in  the <br/>
process of getting full custody of our 10 yo foster daughter.  The  first boy <br/>
we adopted had/has FAS and RAD.  It was a big struggle at first,  but the one <br/>
thing that probably made the BIGGEST difference was pulling him out  of <br/>
school as soon as the adoption was final.  It lifted this huge weight  off of him <br/>
and us.  He just couldn&#39;t handle the stifling environment and  needed freedom.  <br/>
He was always in trouble at school, it was awful.  We  know he will never be <br/>
&quot;normal&quot; but he has come so incredibly far.  He&#39;s a  very happy, busy kid.  <br/>
His biggest joy is untangling things, finding things  no one else can seem to <br/>
locate, and &quot;fixing&quot; things.  <br/>
 <br/>
The other two boys had &quot;learning disabilities.&quot;  Since we took them  out of <br/>
school, that has changed, though one still struggles to read.  They  blossomed <br/>
once taken out of school.  <br/>
 <br/>
At this time, our two foster children are not bothered that they have to go  <br/>
to school and the others get to stay home.  They do their homework if the  <br/>
want to, wear what they want to, go to sleep when they&#39;re tired, and do a good  <br/>
job ot if.  Our oldest foster son is about to turn 18, and will go to live  <br/>
with family.  So soon, we won&#39;t have to live by the school&#39;s schedule, as  when <br/>
we get full custody, we&#39;ll be able to take her out of school.  For the  <br/>
meantime, she&#39;s OK with it.  She has been in horrible situations, including  almost a <br/>
year in hospitalization, so live in our home has been the most stable  thing <br/>
in her life, probably since she was born.<br/>
 <br/>
I think a radical unschooling family can be wonderful for children who&#39;ve  <br/>
been in foster care.  They&#39;ve lived with so many rules, so much &quot;system&quot;  that <br/>
giving them a lot of freedom to make mistakes and grow from them gives them  a <br/>
chance to have a little control over their own world, something they&#39;ve not  <br/>
had in the past.  They were either controlled by abuse, or neglect, or the  <br/>
system.<br/>
 <br/>
Something else:  I&#39;ve noticed through the years, that many of these  kids <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;make it&quot; in strict, Christian or Fundamentalist homes.  We go  to Church <br/>
(Mass), but our kids have a lot of freedom, they can have their own  interests, <br/>
watch most movies, dress the way they want.  To look at our home  you would <br/>
never think we&#39;re religious.  In that way, the  unschooling/relaxed lifestyle <br/>
has helped these kids tremendously.  <br/>
<br/>

in our family.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have to second this.  I would never recommend taking in a child  older than <br/>
your youngest.  The only reason we had the 17 yo is because we  had known him <br/>
a long time before he was in our home, and we knew his issues were  very <br/>
minimal, and he still has a good relationship with his father.  Still,  it was <br/>
probably not the best choice, and I&#39;d never do it again.  I just  wouldn&#39;t bring <br/>
a teen into my home, you just never know.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think Sandra did have a point.  To have a child for years and years  who <br/>
has to go to school while the rest of the family is having a ball,  could be <br/>
cruel.  But with us, we were always open to adoption so there was  a light at the <br/>
end of the tunnel for our kids.  After our 10 yo girl, we  don&#39;t plan on <br/>
adopting any more, so we are not going to foster.  Sending  children from home to <br/>
home is the most damaging thing foster care does to kids,  so I really suggest <br/>
only doing it if you&#39;re in it for the long haul.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110075129">Of course.  Children are not born as &quot;empty slates&quot; and do not need adults<br/>
to fill them up to make them whole.  They are born with inherent<br/>
intelligence, curiosity, need to love and be loved.  When the love they<br/>
express is not returned, when their intelligence is dumbed down, when their<br/>
curiosity is thwarted as being mischievous or wrong in some way, then they<br/>
are insulted, slapped, punished, etc. they learn to respond accordingly.<br/>
The longer a child has had to adapt to such influences, the greater the<br/>
likelihood he has come to believe he is unworthy, stupid and unlovable.<br/>
<br/>
Any organism will falter under less than ideal growing situations and the<br/>
human is no different.  Anger, depression, illness, inflicting pain on<br/>
oneself and others are just some of the ways a human will learn to express<br/>
themselves under such circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Some children and some adults may be unable to recover.  Many can however,<br/>
especially with the influence of tender, loving people who can give them the<br/>
courage and freedom to express themselves in a hundred different ways and<br/>
begin to explore the world on their own terms.<br/>
<br/>
In the world of foster care, the system of &quot;care&quot; and &quot;treatment&quot; is<br/>
bureaucratic and cold and harsh.  Kids are expected to go to school as soon<br/>
as they are removed from their abusive homes, even though it may be a new<br/>
school miles from their former neighborhood, even though they are terrified,<br/>
hurt, angry and confused.  The system believes they need &quot;structure&quot;.  When<br/>
kids show how they feel by acting out, rebelling, etc. they system believes<br/>
they should be medicated into submission.  The list is long, and these are<br/>
just two examples. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s people who help people, not a system.  People respond to love, they<br/>
respond to freedom.  There are no other substitutes, and we are all capable<br/>
of change, rehabilitation, making a difference.<br/>

We may like to think it does not matter and maybe we&#39;ve never discriminated  <br/>
or segregated by age.  But being born first or last is just not something  <br/>
that can be changed, and I believe it DOES matter very much to the  children.  <br/>
Not adopting or fostering children older than your own, helps  prevent <br/>
resentment and &quot;pecking order&quot; problems.  I just think it&#39;s also  respectful of your <br/>
biological kids...they were there first and it&#39;s just better  to keep the order <br/>
that way.  I wish I could explain it more.  I think  it helped my biological <br/>
children to have a little more compassion for the foster  children...sort of <br/>
like the the way a big brother or big sister sticks up for  their younger <br/>
siblings.  <br/>

<br/>
It has nothing to do with unschooling or age segregation...it has<br/>
everything to do with sibling issues.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what happened in my life; We adopted two girls (birth sisters)<br/>
that had a history of abuse and an alcoholic Dad (the abuse mostly<br/>
came from him). Cindy was two years older than I, Dana was just a few<br/>
months older.<br/>
I had been the oldest in my family. My family had a middle class<br/>
existance, lots of love and nurture...I seemed to have everything in<br/>
their eyes. Being the oldest, then bringing in someone older than me<br/>
(these kids DON&#39;T have the advantage of being unschooled/non-age<br/>
segregated before they get to your home btw) meant all of her anger<br/>
and meanness got aimed at ME.<br/>
She hated me.<br/>
She destroyed things I loved, she wrote horrible things about me...we<br/>
also were friends at times, but the pain of being hated was horrible.<br/>
<br/>
I knew logically, that her hatred was not about me, but I was a kid,<br/>
with kid experience and it was hard to understand.<br/>
<br/>
The kids you get through foster care at older ages, usually have a<br/>
HOST of issues to deal with. You don&#39;t want that anger and hatred of<br/>
what happened before your family, getting taken out on your own<br/>
children. Please consider that carefully.<br/>
<br/>
You owe  your birth children FIRST and foremost. If there&#39;s room in<br/>
your family for adoption or fostering, I think that&#39;s awesome. Just<br/>
don&#39;t make your own children pay the price for shit done to kids by<br/>
crappy parents that you don&#39;t even know.<br/>

&quot;be a better parent&quot; by being a more diluted parent.<br/>
<br/>
I know a family with two children.  They adopted three--one between  <br/>
the ages of their two, and two younger.  The mother&#39;s attention went  <br/>
almost exclusively to those three, because they had problems, because  <br/>
they needed attention.  She called them &quot;my Russian&quot; and &quot;my Korean&quot;  <br/>
and such, but she wouldn&#39;t call her own children &quot;my own child&quot;  <br/>
because that would have seemed to set them apart.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t long at all before her original two children ALSO needed  <br/>
attention and had problems.<br/>
<br/>
She had something to brag about at church, at first, though.  She  <br/>
felt like more of a mom.<br/>
<br/>
But quantity isn&#39;t quality.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Were you involved in the process of the adoption, were you asked <br/>
what you wanted in a sibling? Did you meet the girls ahead of time, <br/>
and did they live with you for months before the adoption was <br/>
finalized? The reason that i ask is that it seems so hard to find <br/>
support for &quot;mindful parenting&quot; in adoption circles. I am on a <br/>
couple of lists, and the parents mostly talk about diagnoses, <br/>
medication, structure, time outs, etc etc. Its hard to know if thats <br/>
just alot of mainstream parenting BS, or if its &quot;necessary&quot; ya know? <br/>
So when i hear peoples&#39; stories about how it was really hard for <br/>
them growing up, its difficult (for me)to discern whether thats an <br/>
adoption issue, or a parenting issue. Thats why i specifically asked <br/>
about birth order. <br/>
  <br/>
Did your parents address the issues between you and your sister? Was <br/>
she allowed to get away with treating you badly because she was <br/>
adopted? Did SHE want to be adopted into your family? I think it <br/>
would be a terrible idea to adopt a child if the current kids in the <br/>
family didnt want to do it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Obviously i would not want to adopt a child that had any history of <br/>
acting out sexually. But in our unschooling home, where there is <br/>
such an atmosphere of openness, ANY inappropriateness would most <br/>
likely be dealt with right away. <br/>
<br/>
Were the kids in your family consulted at all about taking in the <br/>
extra family members? My son is desperate for a brother, he said he <br/>
would give up his computer to have a brother (and that&#39;s saying <br/>
something). I think if the current kids in the family really *want* <br/>
more siblings, are totally on board with it, thats got to be alot <br/>
better than being forced to share what you don&#39;t want to share by <br/>
parents who don&#39;t care about your opinions or feelings.<br/>
<br/>
It doesnt sound like your situation wouldve been made much better if <br/>
the cousins were a bit younger and therefore not messing up &quot;the <br/>
birth order&quot; though. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of <br/>
birth order being important. I think any time you change the family <br/>
dynamic in *any* way, there will need to be adjustment to that. My <br/>
son has been an only child for 9 yrs. I know it will be hard to then <br/>
have a new sibling (and not a little lump of a newborn but a fully <br/>
formed kid with likes and dislikes and fully formed personality), <br/>
and it will change our family forever. But he absolutely does not <br/>
*want* to be an only child so i believe its worth it for us. But <br/>
with regards to birth order, i&#39;m trying to figure how (for us)how a <br/>
child two years older would be a worse choice than one two years <br/>
younger. At this point i&#39;m thinking it might be easier with a <br/>
younger child (3-7 or so)because he could take the big brother role. <br/>
But he has stated he wants a brother closer to his age (he said &quot;I <br/>
want a 14 yr old brother!&quot; but i dont think i&#39;m up for that right <br/>
now) <br/>
<br/>
I know the most important thing (for us)in adopting would be to be <br/>
matched with a kid that has similar interests (i think a boy who&#39;s <br/>
main love was all things sports related, or NASCAR, or going to <br/>
church would probably not be so comfortable here....the SuperBowl is <br/>
here this weekend and i dont even know who&#39;s <br/>
playing!...thats..uh...football right?!?), a kid without significant <br/>
attachment issues or history of mental illness, and a child who will <br/>
be willing to try homeschooling. <br/>

Katherine - I think at first, especially if the child has attachment  issues, <br/>
there has to be a lot of firm structure.  Not because it&#39;s &quot;good  parenting&quot; <br/>
but because the child has to give up and give in and surrender their  control <br/>
to the parents, so that bonding can begin.  It sounds horrible, I  know.  But <br/>
in the children&#39;s past, controlling their own situations  (through whatever <br/>
means possible, usually negative ) was the only way they could  prevent <br/>
themselves being hurt, rejected, and disappointed.  They can&#39;t  trust adults because <br/>
everytime they have in the past, the adults have either  hurt them, or sent <br/>
them away.  It&#39;s sort of a &quot;strike first&quot;  mentality.<br/>
 <br/>
They have to see that there is someone whom they can completely  depend on, <br/>
who will take care of their needs, love them, protect them, and  especially who <br/>
won&#39;t abandon them.  And they will fight it every step of  the way..it&#39;s the <br/>
only way they have defended themselves in the past.  <br/>
 <br/>
But once our kids bonded with us, we were able to give their lives and  <br/>
decisions back to them.  I wouldn&#39;t say that we can give them as much  freedom as <br/>
the children we&#39;ve raised from birth, though 2 of our adopted sons  are very <br/>
close.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think a lot of adoptive parents do hold onto those parenting styles  <br/>
forever, which I think is a mistake.  The children may appear &quot;obedient&quot;  and healed <br/>
on the surface, but I have seen so many stifled and not allowed to  grow.  <br/>
They usually explode later.<br/>
 <br/>
Have you read anything by Dr. Keck and Regina Kupecky?  (Adopting the  Hurt <br/>
Child, Parenting the Hurt Child)  They are my favorite &quot;adoption&quot;  authors and <br/>
the books apply to foster care too.  They really  hit the nail on the head.  <br/>
Describes what does and doesn&#39;t work with  healing adoptive children, I can&#39;t <br/>
recommend their books enough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219795744">** So when i hear peoples&#39; stories about how it was really hard for<br/>
them growing up, its difficult (for me)to discern whether thats an<br/>
adoption issue, or a parenting issue. Thats why i specifically asked<br/>
about birth order.**<br/>
<br/>
My dad got remarried when I was 14 and my brother 12.  The oldest of my <br/>
stepsiblings (8) let us know that she didn&#39;t like being bumped out of <br/>
her role as the oldest responsible kid.  That was the role she had <br/>
played when her mom was a single parent, and she was pretty level <br/>
headed.  But no one was going to leave her in charge when they could <br/>
nominate a 14 year old for that task.  From her comments, it&#39;s pretty <br/>
clear that she felt she lost status, and I don&#39;t know how a parent could <br/>
minimize that effect.  (It&#39;s not like I belittled or patronized her, um, <br/>
at least not consciously.  Maybe IF I hadn&#39;t been schooled I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have thought I was way more evolved than her.  I don&#39;t know.)<br/>

<br/>
My middle daughter Shawna used intimidation and manipulation to <br/>
abuse her siblings. She was determined to show me (their anger is <br/>
usually directed at the mother) that she controlled her siblings, <br/>
not me. She constantly tested me to see if I was strong enough to <br/>
handle her, to see if I could take what she dished out. <br/>
And I was, and I did. <br/>
My mantra the whole first year to her was &quot;I will wear you down <br/>
before you wear me down. Give me all you got.&quot; <br/>
And she did. <br/>
But we survived and she&#39;s healing and learning to trust and loving <br/>
life every day. <br/>
This was a child who, on the first day I met her (and her siblings) <br/>
told me &quot;Don&#39;t lie to us&quot; when I asked thme if they wanted to get <br/>
together again the following week.   <br/>
<br/>
I hope Cimion will be at that level one day. His RAD symptoms are <br/>
more deep rooted that Shawna&#39;s. His abuse was also longer and more <br/>
severe. This is a child who told me he loved me an hour after he met <br/>
me.     <br/>
     <br/>

<br/>
Yes and this is where I&#39;m forever grateful to unschooling and the <br/>
voices who brought it to the front of my mind. As Shawna was making <br/>
progress and changes, I knew I had to change my parenting also. <br/>
That was VERY hard to do. It was at this point I found <br/>
unschooling.com and soaked it all in. I started applyling some of <br/>
the ways I was reading about with Jacqueline and she just blossomed. <br/>
I then started with Shawna, very slowly and started to really open <br/>
up. It was like the vehicle she needed to grow as a person.  <br/>
<br/>

With the first, yes.  With the second, no.  She was rescued from a  <br/>
county orphanage.  It was our house or Tarrant County social  <br/>
services.  Her mom (my mothers older sister) left her in a bar and  <br/>
didn&#39;t come back for her soon enough to suit the owners.  Because we  <br/>
already had her sister, it was just done.  Nadine didn&#39;t want it.   <br/>
She cried daily for a long time, and when she wasn&#39;t crying she was  <br/>
lashing out at the other kids.  I felt sorry for her, but it was like  <br/>

Are you sure he doesn&#39;t just want more friends?  Can you find 14 year  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you take in a 14 year old, I can almost guarantee you won&#39;t find that  <br/>
person.  I think if you are set on this, your hunch about a 6 or 7 year old  is a <br/>
better idea.  If a 14 year old has been moved many places,  there&#39;s a reason. <br/>
 If a 14 yo HASN&#39;T been moved a lot and has been  with his foster family for <br/>
a long time, then that&#39;s probably the best place for  him to stay until he <br/>
turns 18.<br/>
 <br/>
You will just have a better chance with a younger child.  We adopted  3, all <br/>
younger than our own.  The oldest (at the time he first came to live  with us) <br/>
was 9, he&#39;s 15 now, and he and my son are probably best friends (my son  is <br/>
almost 18).  They talk all the time about getting an apartment together  some <br/>
day, or starting a business.  This boy had no history of FAS or RAD,  and other <br/>
than the emergency shelter, ours was the first foster home he and his  <br/>
brother had been in.  So it CAN work, though I always tend to emphasize the  bad <br/>
(sorry) because I want everyone to know what they&#39;re getting into up  front. <br/>

what you wanted in a sibling? Did you meet the girls ahead of time,<br/>

<br/>
Yes on both counts. I could not have understood the affect of messing<br/>
with the birth order at my age (9), nor the dynamics my sisters<br/>
brought into the household. Could my parents have anticipated? Sure,<br/>
now that they&#39;ve lived through raising three high needs, previously<br/>
abused children.<br/>
<br/>
No, she was not allowed to continue with the meanness unchecked, but<br/>
what you&#39;re not understanding is how subtle it was. It was very<br/>
sneaky....so my parents couldn&#39;t just go off accusing her without<br/>
evidence that she&#39;d done it.<br/>
She lied of course. And that&#39;s the reason it would have been<br/>
impossible to understand whether they wanted to be adopted.For so long<br/>
in their lives, they&#39;d been trained to say what elicited a certain<br/>
response, they wouldn&#39;t tell you what they really felt.  <br/>
<br/>
We had them as foster kids for a couple of months before adoption was<br/>
discussed.  My parents had fallen in love with them by that time....as<br/>
had myself and my other sibs.  It&#39;s a lot more complicated than one<br/>
would believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905017268">The more I think about adoption and foster care, the more I think<br/>
wanting a sibling for your child is one of the WORST possible reasons<br/>
for doing it.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the resources to really GIVE an adopted child a wonderful<br/>
life, and you want to make a difference in a child&#39;s life, that&#39;s a<br/>
good reason to adopt.  An instant sibling is NOT what you get most<br/>
times, and is really a very selfish reason.<br/>
<br/>
That adopted child (if older) WILL come with issues. You need to be<br/>
prepared (as does your child) for dealing with those issues long term.<br/>
Social workers will NOT tell you every bit of detail about that<br/>
child&#39;s history...heck, they might not even know all of it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
There is a chance that the child will heal, become a very bonded child<br/>
and be wonderful friends with everyone in the family. But you need to<br/>
accept the fact that it may very well never happen and if you want to<br/>
adopt in spite of that fact, then you are in it for the right reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I am a big fan of adoption and long to adopt a child myself...so don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong, I&#39;m not against adoption at all. My dh was adopted and<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to find his birth mother for years....adoption has<br/>
been a big part of my life.<br/>
<br/>
Adopt a child to love them, nourish them and give them opportunities<br/>
they may otherwise never have. Plan to love them and nourish them in<br/>
spite of the fact that you may never get much back. If you can do it<br/>
for those reasons, you will be a great adoptive parent.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a sibling for your existing child, there are other ways to<br/>
address that need. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16949088">**** True, but it&#39;s bad enough that adults don&#39;t have  realistic <br/>
idea of   what they&#39;re getting into.  Kids have NO idea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t really have an idea of what you are going to get no matter <br/>
HOW you add a child to your family. <br/>
<br/>
.***** . . But he absolutely does not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *want* to be an only <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I felt that way when I was a kid as well. We adopted my sister when <br/>
I was 10 and she was 5. My advice is to make sure you include him in <br/>
all the steps that you can. Right down to taking him to court with <br/>
you when the papers are done. Also, something my parents didn&#39;t <br/>
know, make sure the adopted child knows that they have the option of <br/>
changing their name if they choose to do so. My sister is still kind <br/>
of  bitter about that one. :)<br/>
There are a lot of reasons why they tend to want you to adopt kids <br/>
younger than your born to you children. Birth order does matter in a <br/>
lot of ways. It really does influence a lot of things in your <br/>
personality. There tend to be less problematic issues with kids who <br/>
are younger than your birth children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Are you sure he doesn&#39;t just want more friends?  Can you find 14 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>year   old friends (give or take a couple of years for extended <br/>
visits,   overnights, long weekends?  He might want his personal-<br/>
fantasy   brother, but you won&#39;t find that person.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There will be adjustments, road bumps and friction. Even when you <br/>
want a sibling so bad you can taste it, the reality of it takes some <br/>
getting used to. But friends aren&#39;t going to cut it if he really <br/>
wants a sibling. I&#39;ve been there. I hated being an only. HATED it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You&#39;ll do what you do, but giving some serious thought to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>possible  longterm (LIFElongevery life involved) ramifications is <br/>
good.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My sister and I are now very close. We weren&#39;t always, but I am very <br/>
thankful to have her in my life. <br/>
<br/>
I was asked what I wanted from a sibling, whether I&#39;d prefer a <br/>
brother or sister, if I was aware it wasn&#39;t like a puppy, that we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to give them back. That I&#39;d have to share my mom <br/>
and dad. The psychologist from the adoption agency talked to me <br/>
alone as part of the screening process. There were several things I <br/>
could have done or said that would&#39;ve put a halt on the whole deal. <br/>
If I had said I didn&#39;t want a sibling, it would have been over.<br/>
I did.<br/>
We went to Kansas CIty to meet ANg a couple of times before we all <br/>
decided to go for it. She had some major issues, and still does if <br/>
I&#39;m honest. SHe was seriously mentally and physically abused, <br/>
abandoned by both her birth mother, (to her father) and then by her <br/>
father for her stepmother and her kids. He drove her to child <br/>
services and just signed away rights to her and her two sibs. So she <br/>
has some abandonement issues to this day. This all happened before <br/>
she turned 5. <br/>
 I don&#39;t think my parents really were equipped to deal with her <br/>
problems in a way that helped her at all. A more openly loving, non <br/>
punitive home probably would&#39;ve been better for Ang, but she&#39;d <br/>
already been in 6 foster homes in less than a year, and almost <br/>
adopted, and then had the family change their mind after they&#39;d <br/>
already told her she was theirs forever and she&#39;d lived with them <br/>
for weeks. THey were looking at her as being unadoptable and about <br/>
ready to write her off completely. So she came to us.<br/>
 It was a rough road, but like I said, I&#39;m glad she&#39;s a big part of <br/>
my life. She has said she feels the same way. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112820782"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &quot;You don&#39;t really have an idea of what you are going to get no matter<br/>
&gt; HOW you add a child to your family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not quite true.  It reminds me of the argument a month or two  <br/>
back that anyone&#39;s kids could run away, unschooling was no proof  <br/>
against running away.  It wasn&#39;t worded that elegantly, I don&#39;t  <br/>
think, but more like runaways could be anyone.  As though it were a  <br/>
random occurrence with no cause.<br/>
<br/>
When I had my children, I couldn&#39;t guarantee that they would be  <br/>
healthy, but I knew who the father was and I chose him.  I knew who I  <br/>
was.<br/>
<br/>
There are genetic tendencies still unidentified or unadmitted, and  <br/>
one seems to me to be a steadfastness and presence.  I think any  <br/>
child whose father just irresponsibly split and whose mother couldn&#39;t  <br/>
get it together to want to take care of her child is going to be less  <br/>
likely (for reasons of both nature AND nurture, for starters) to  <br/>
calmly work at staying focussed and attentive within a family, to  <br/>
WANT to stay there, and to become a really good mom herself.   I know  <br/>
for sure there are orphans whose parents would have been great; there  <br/>
are babies whose mothers wanted to keep them but whose parents  <br/>
cruelly chose for her, to give the baby away.  I&#39;m not talking about  <br/>
those babies, though the parents who adopt them don&#39;t then often know  <br/>
how the parents&#39; were.   I&#39;m talking worst case scenario, like my  <br/>
half brother getting someone pregnant and bailing. (The only  <br/>
pregnancy of which I&#39;m aware did not come to term.)  He doesn&#39;t stay  <br/>
and take responsibility; neither did HIS father.  Our mom wasn&#39;t all  <br/>
that great at that either, in the longrun.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about the bad adoption stories I know, and thought of  <br/>
two cases in which the adopted child was the star of the family.  I  <br/>
was visiting one of Kirby&#39;s friend&#39;s families a few months back.  I  <br/>
know the boy, who&#39;s the middle of three boys and was adopted from  <br/>
inside the family in some way (from a cousin or sibling of one of the  <br/>
parents, Kirby thinks).  He&#39;s the star of the show in every family  <br/>
photo.  The brothers have been in serious trouble (attempted suicide  <br/>
and alcoholism, and getting a girl pregnant); he&#39;s had no problems of  <br/>
any sort.  (They&#39;re all in their 20&#39;s.)<br/>
<br/>
Another family adopted one boy, an only child.  All they knew were  <br/>
the parents were musicians.  He is a stunning musician, a NICE guy,  <br/>
married a woman from Asia, helped her with immigration to Canada;  <br/>
he&#39;s impressive all kinds of ways, and was unschooled for most of his  <br/>
teen years, which gave him the chance to really focus on music.  (The  <br/>
adoptive parents are not musical at all.)<br/>

always things you don&#39;t expect, no matter how you add a child to your <br/>
family. <br/>
 Adoption isn&#39;t always horrible, it&#39;s not always great, but the really <br/>
bad ones are the ones that make the news or people tend to want to <br/>
want to pass along. Kind of like the stories that hit the news about <br/>
abusers who call themselves homeschoolers, or the HORRIBLE birth <br/>
stories people tend to tell pregnant women. Not that you don&#39;t need to <br/>
be prepared for any of it,not that there aren&#39;t bad things that <br/>
happen, but since there is so much that is unknown, you don&#39;t have to <br/>
expect the absolute worst either.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am amazed at how long this thread has gone on. I am<br/>
also amazed at lots of the negativity. I have seven<br/>
adopted and two birth sons. NEVER did I say WOW I<br/>
think we will create this really large family. It<br/>
happened one kid at a time and a choice at a time. I<br/>
would have one son that hated change and would baulk<br/>
each time and one that was all for it. Today they are<br/>
both grown men and they couldn&#39;t pick one sib that our<br/>
family could do without. They both live in another<br/>
state. Are some of my best friends and despite being<br/>
married and fathers and having their own lives call to<br/>
talk to their younger sibs. My eldest daughter  was<br/>
recently interviewed on tv. When she was asked about<br/>
living in such a large family her description was fun,<br/>
but loud. She is sixteen. Because we have so many<br/>
genetic packages we have kids of high intelligence and<br/>
kids who in ps would spend lots of the day in special<br/>
ed. That is why unschooling is the perfect thing for<br/>
us. It works so beautifully with each unique<br/>
individual in our family. When we stepped into the<br/>
world we live in we quit just being our genetic make<br/>
up. We became this whole new package each time a child<br/>
joined our family. My kids are best friends mostly. I<br/>
have several that have personality bump up against the<br/>
other and I use many of the ideas that Sandra has<br/>
shared for heading off conflict, especially with some<br/>
of my stronger personalities. <br/>
I need to clarify. Adoption is completely different<br/>
from foster care. I did that. It was great work.<br/>
Adoption is creating a forever family. A new family<br/>
from the family you are changing by adopting. A family<br/>
that may be better or worse , but for certain will<br/>
make the family you had become a memory. Exactly like<br/>
when you and your hubby had you first child and your<br/>
lives changed forever.<br/>
I also need to say adoption is in no way inferior to<br/>
birth. If any of my seven children had come from my<br/>
body I could not love them more. They are a much a<br/>
part of me as my bio children. In their imperfection,<br/>
just like mine, and their beauty they are not less. <br/>
I once had foster daughters for  year. I was lucky<br/>
enough to help them go home to their family. There was<br/>
one point that it appeared perhaps their mom would not<br/>
be able to get them home. I told my worker we would<br/>
not be able to adopt the  girls if they were<br/>
available. They were lovely girls. They would just<br/>
never be mine. Never get the status that every child<br/>
deserves being part of a forever family.<br/>
Our unschooling lives have allowed me to free my<br/>
children. To honor them for their uniqueness. My just<br/>
turned ten year old daughter learned how to write her<br/>
name is cursive yesterday. She wants to open a saving<br/>
account and someone told her she needed to sign her<br/>
name. In about five minutes she wrote her name<br/>
perfectly. Today we are opening an account.<br/>
Enough of my rant.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it isn&#39;t even horrible most of the time. :-) <br/>
<br/>
My youngest is living proof that removing a child early from an <br/>
abusive birth home and NOT giving their abuser another chance to <br/>
abuse them is in the best interest of the child. To many times the <br/>
system puts the abuser first and the child second. Although she grew <br/>
up in foster care, she was in a loving home, with loving people and <br/>
she grew up attached and secure. <br/>
Today she is a seven year old that is a joy to be around and is the <br/>
light of my life. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My middle child is living proof that trauma and hurt can be reversed <br/>
and that a child can heal, once they decide they want it. She <br/>
learned to trust again and because of that, she learned to love and <br/>
be loved again.   <br/>
Today my daughter is a loving ten year old that amazes me every day <br/>
with their strength of character. <br/>
<br/>
My oldest is living proof that abusers must NOT be allowed to have <br/>
access to their victims and that children should have the same <br/>
rights as adults when they&#39;ve been abused. Time and time again, he <br/>
was sent back to his hell, only to be abused again. His abuser was <br/>
given many chances, he wasn&#39;t even given one. The very people that <br/>
were supposed to protect him, were the ones who caused the most <br/>
suffering. The system needs to put the children FIRST. <br/>
Today my son is a 13 year old boy who hates himself. He feels <br/>
worthless and unlovable, not because he is, but because that&#39;s what <br/>
he&#39;s been shown. He&#39;s come a long way since we adopted him and he&#39;s <br/>
got a long, tough road of healing ahead of him. <br/>
<br/>
My brother, who we adopted in the 60&#39;s is living proof that back <br/>
then, they thought love healed all and they were wrong. My parents <br/>
were not prepared to help him, as I am with my children. They <br/>
treated him just as they treated me and it pushed him away. He <br/>
needed a different kind of parenting but there were no books or <br/>
classes available, like there is now. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there ARE horror stories but those cases are becoming less and <br/>
less as we learn more and more about hurt and traumatized (sp?) <br/>
children and what their needs are. Getting these kids out of abusers <br/>
hands and into a loving foster home as quickly and as early as <br/>
possible WORKS. Severing the parental rights of the abusers quickly <br/>
and getting these kids adopted within a reasonable amount of time <br/>
WORKS. Having parents who are prepared and educated on disorders <br/>
like RAD, works. <br/>
<br/>
When we stop putting the needs of abusers before the needs of their <br/>
young victims, cases like my brother will become less and less and <br/>
cases like my youngest daughter will become more and more.  <br/>
