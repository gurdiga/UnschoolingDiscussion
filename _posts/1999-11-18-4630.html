&quot;I guess I am not ready to give up my lifestyle in exchange for homeschooling my kids.&quot; is the basic challenge.  Yes some spirited kids need particular kinds of arrangements in their lives which may be different than more relaxed, at ease, types.&quot; People do<br/>
what they feel they must. and now I will say what I started to say.<br/>
<br/>
More than anything I would like all people who are Dx with ADD ADHD to research the topic more thoroughly.  I personally believe it is a psychiatric construct with about as much usefulness as most other psychiatric constructs which is to say not a whole<br/>
heck of a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I  think it is primarily, a pharmaceutical industry driven creation which is lining the pockets of stockholders and drugging needlessly tens of thousands of people.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it helps some people with alternate experiences and perceptions feel more comfortable in a world that is intolerant of diversity and shapes people for the heartless<br/>
needs of the military/medical/industrial/educational complex. Which services the need for power and control of a tiny fraction of the people at the expense of most people.  Hell no I won&#39;t go!<br/>
<br/>
And here ends the rant.<br/>
<br/>
If this perennial topic doesn&#39;t suit people&#39;s needs on the list I would be happy to chat privately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414814134">The condition whose current pc title is ADD/ADHD does exist.  These kids<br/>
were treated with diet change and cognitive &quot;training&quot; prior to the<br/>
pharmaceutical companies discovering a &quot;gold mine.&quot;  What is trully scary<br/>
is that 99.9% of the kids that are diagnosed with this are not and their<br/>
diagnosis comes from teachers who don&#39;t want to be bothered with &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
active little boys.  Shrinks and GP&#39;s have found a &quot;gold mine&quot; also and<br/>
don&#39;t even do testings, simply take referrals and pass out the pills.<br/>
<br/>
What is really interesting is that the condition was not &quot;discovered/named&quot;<br/>
until after the world went bananas vaccinating their children.  I read an<br/>
article about this a few years ago and the ol&#39; light bulb went on.  Here I<br/>
sat with four boys, three of whom fit the clinical discription of ADD/ADHD,<br/>
one who does not.  Guess who wasn&#39;t vaccinated.<br/>
<br/>
And the scariest thing of all is that now you aren&#39;t even given a choice<br/>
about some vaccinations, they do Hep B on defenseless little babies before<br/>
they even put them in the isolet in front of the viewing window!  Hep B, of<br/>
course, is whole other thread and one that makes my teeth grind!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975323641">Well, I have several problems with Hep B.  One has nothing to do with the<br/>
vaccine itself, simply how it was tested (which can be filed under<br/>
genocide).  The others are that they haven&#39;t a clue how long it lasts, they<br/>
know there are severe side affects that appear down the road (neurological)<br/>
and they are tooting it with scare tactics to folks that are not (using CDC<br/>
guidelines) even remotely likely to be exposed.  If you think your children<br/>
will be using I.V. drugs, if you think your children will be having sex<br/>
with I.V. drug users, if you think your children will be working in a<br/>
hospital and be exposed to bodily fluids, well then, think about it.  But<br/>
please tell me what new born is going to be using I.V. drugs or having sex<br/>
with an I.V. drug user?????  And why the push to have children have the<br/>
shot before starting school???  This is pure unadulterated $$$$ campaign by<br/>
the drug companies!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228279169">the newest is Hep A.  the last testing of Hep B was about 1990 and was done<br/>
without consent of all the children using IHS in Alaska.  These now young<br/>
adults are experiencing many, many neurological problems.  The Hep A had<br/>
its last testing done in about 1994.  Again, it was done without consent on<br/>
the children of the Four Corners using IHS services.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Hep A is the one most likely to be caught from unsanitary conditions<br/>
(restaurants, etc.).  It is also the easiest to cure if caught in a timely<br/>
manner.  Shot of anti-globulin and watch.  In fact, about 25% of the<br/>
population has been exposed to Hep A and doesn&#39;t even know it and has<br/>
suffered no ill effects from this exposure.<br/>
<br/>
Most of these vaccines are here to make drug companies rich and they use<br/>
scare tactics to accomplish this.  the numbers they use are skewed to sell<br/>
the drugs.<br/>
<br/>
For example, they quote somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 deaths a year<br/>
from Hep B in children.  They don&#39;t quote that these deaths occured to<br/>
children that had blood transfusions or were born to infected parents.  In<br/>
the later case, the vaccine wouldn&#39;t have done an ounce of good.  What they<br/>
don&#39;t quote is that more kids have died as a direct result of getting the<br/>
shots than ever did from the disease.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to work in public health -- specifically the body which made<br/>
state requirements on this subject, but I take a middle position on the<br/>
vaccination issue generally, and think they all should be evaluated<br/>
individually, although I have no answer to the argument that the total<br/>
load of vaccinations (rather than the negative effects of any individual<br/>
vaccine) is responsible for all kinds of ills, from autism to<br/>
auto-immune disorders.  This may be true, but is impossible to evaluate,<br/>
and impossible to separate out from effects, say, of living in homes<br/>
made of new building materials, or the fact that most of our food is now<br/>
filled with corn products (syrup and starch) to which many may have<br/>
minor allergies. I also have no problem with people who will not<br/>
vaccinate because they are ethically perturbed by animal testing.<br/>
<br/>
I would never allow my kids to receive hep B vaccine when they were<br/>
babies.  It is unnecessary and, since the problem years for contracting<br/>
hep B are ages 12-25, we don&#39;t really know whether successful<br/>
immunization would result.  Schools are now requiring hep B for school<br/>
entry (even though it is relatively expensive), because they figure that<br/>
is the time they can hang the school card over parents&#39; heads.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, at ages 9 and 10, I did vaccinate my kids for hep B (and<br/>
hep A -- we were going to India) -- there is no such thing as complete<br/>
control over teenage behavior, and hep B (and C) are much easier to<br/>
transmit than HIV, and can be just as lethal. As a rule, we immunize as<br/>
late as possible, only against conditions we figure it is likely the<br/>
kids will encounter, and only with those vaccines which we believe<br/>
actually work! (hence, no pertussis, or cholera), and, when given a<br/>
choice, only with those with the least known side effects (Salk versus<br/>
Sabin vaccine for polio.)<br/>
<br/>
A good rule is not to expect your doctor to explain all the options (in<br/>
some health systems, his &quot;quality&quot; ranking -- and hence remuneration --<br/>
may actually be tied to his immunization rates!)  You just have to do<br/>
the research yourself, and do the best you can.  I promised myself I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t get into another vaccination debate  -- so I won&#39;t (and won&#39;t<br/>
respond to people with other views on this subject, which may be just as<br/>
valid) -- just trying to tell you where my family&#39;s experience has led.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-40739849">My understanding of Hep B is that it is primarily blood borne.  Injection<br/>
drug users and health care workers being primarily high risk groups.  Other<br/>
than money I don&#39;t get the rush to immunize large groups of the population.<br/>
Pharmaceutical companies grow fat.   I was immunized because I work in a<br/>
high risk occupation.  I would not allow my kids to be vaccinated for this<br/>
one at all unless they were going to be involved in injection drug use<br/>
(specifically sharing needles or with habits so out of control that they<br/>
don&#39;t know they are sharing needles) or becoming health care workers.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t quite know why travel would be a risk factor.  Hepatitis A is can be<br/>
transmitted fecally and so is very contagious but is also not so serious as<br/>
B.  I could go look this up but am too lazy.  Why for travel?<br/>
<br/>
Is B sexually transmitted?.....I am blushing as I should know this but don&#39;t<br/>
remember.  I have only worried about the blood borne version of Hep B & C.<br/>
