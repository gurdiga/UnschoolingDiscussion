<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743383375">&lt;&lt;I HAVE let my son play video games for hours hoping he would tire of<br/>
them&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two thoughts:  We went through this with my 10yo dd and television.  We used<br/>
to control television and last Spring, I decided to give control to the<br/>
kiddies.  Adriane&#39;s behind stayed glued to the chair watching rerun after<br/>
rerun.  I am not a big TV person and it drove me nuts.  She was grouchy,<br/>
grumpy, complained of being tired all the time.  After about 4 months, she<br/>
announced &quot;I get real tired if I just sit and watch TV all the time.&quot;   She<br/>
now watches maybe an hour or 2 throughout the day but is also riding her<br/>
bike, spending time outside, playing on the computer, writing stories,<br/>
drawing, etc..  She was able to balance it herself, but it took a lot longer<br/>
for her to reach that conclusion for herself than it took me to want to<br/>
impose my conclusions on her.  Could the same apply to your son?<br/>
<br/>
Second, why do you want him to tire of the games?  Because he gets tired and<br/>
grumpy or because you think the games aren&#39;t &quot;educational&quot;?  I think it<br/>
makes a huge difference and can pinpoint a roadblock in unschooling success.<br/>
