<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981735507"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&lt;&lt;Actually, any<br/>
&gt;Californian has to declare themselves a private school if they want to<br/>
&gt;legally homeschool, so find a californian who&#39;d be willing to umbrella you<br/>
&gt;and willing to deal with any Michigan paperwork.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, okay... so there are four ways to homeschool in california, but I was <br/>
talking about umbrella opportunities.  I also included it as the THIRD <br/>
option after locals and established umbrellas and I admit I got messy, <br/>
linguistically!<br/>
<br/>
For any folks who are curious:<br/>
1.) The credentialed tutor option is very rarely done, I think because of <br/>
its expense.<br/>
2.) The public-school-at-home option isn&#39;t seen as &#39;real&#39; homeschooling in <br/>
some quarters as the children are public school students. It usually isn&#39;t <br/>
very unschooler friendly.<br/>
3.) The private-school-at-home/ISP option is done but sometimes is viewed <br/>
much as #2.<br/>
4.) Declaring yourself a private school (R-4) is very frequently done by <br/>
cali families and is very unschooler friendly.<br/>
<br/>
An non-cali unschooler looking for a way to unschool kids she is <br/>
responsible for, but under her states law is stymied because she&#39;s not the <br/>
blood-mother, wouldn&#39;t be interested in 1, 2 or 3.  They wouldn&#39;t do her <br/>
any good.  Option four, now...umbrella-ing...  That could work.<br/>
<br/>
So, I listed the one that could work and is most frequently used by <br/>
unschooling families.  I do apologize for misleading folks into thinking <br/>
that it&#39;s the ONLY way to homeschool here in Cali, it just seems to be the <br/>
most common way and the way most likely to help the searching mum.  I <br/>
should have said &#39;usually&#39; instead of &#39;has to&#39;.  Consider me linguistically <br/>
chastened.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Cali and I&#39;ve declared.  In the past, as a very exclusive private <br/>
school we&#39;ve umbrella&#39;d the child of a friend who wished to stay below the <br/>
radar.<br/>
No fuss, no muss.<br/>
