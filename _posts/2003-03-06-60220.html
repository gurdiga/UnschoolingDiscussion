<div id="ygrps-yiv-687288319">I was a flylady subscriber back in summer 2000 when she wasn&#39;t as widely <br/>
known. I learned a lot about getting on a consistent routine, and I would be <br/>
lying if I said it didn&#39;t make me nicer to be around. I could make excuses <br/>
all day long of why it&#39;s okay to live in a chaotic cluttered &quot;creative&quot; <br/>
house. The plain truth is our family does not thrive in such an environment. <br/>
It is very frustrating when you &quot;forget&quot; about an interesting book or project <br/>
because it gets lost in a mess. And if mom aint happy.......I took the best <br/>
parts of Flylady and discarded the rest. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s effective being <br/>
on the computer all the time receiving emails and reminders. I know myself to <br/>
know if I am on the computer too much, I am not available to my kids the way <br/>
I should be. There was a link to the message board about spending more time <br/>
being with your kids, and being on the computer too much is the biggest <br/>
saboteur. Ironic, isn&#39;t it?  Now I remember why I stopped staying caught up <br/>
on these email lists. If I really have to choose between spending time on the <br/>
computer and having an organized house, the computer would be the first to <br/>
go. Most of the time I can find a suitable balance, but I am not going to <br/>
delude myself that it&#39;s okay to have a crazy stressed house that leads to a <br/>
crazy stressed mom. I do not have the capacity to relax in the midst of mess <br/>
and pretend it doesn&#39;t exist. I am a better mom and more available physically <br/>
and emotionally to my kids when I take care of myself and my house. I do not <br/>
nag the kids to help me. Flylady teaches not to be a martyr about cleaning, <br/>
not to be resentful that no one helps out. I get the house on a consistent <br/>
routine because it feels good to take care of the people I love, and that <br/>
brings more results in them helping out than ordering and nagging. They <br/>
appreciate calmness and order and start to cultivate it for themselves. And <br/>
they spend time with me helping each other instead of hiding or avoiding what <br/>
needs to be done. I agree with the poster that said some things just need to <br/>
be done. <br/>
<br/>
Now I don&#39;t expect everyone to agree with me but it may be worth some <br/>
consideration especially if it evokes defensiveness to what I am comm<br/>
unicating. Here is what I have gotten from Flylady and adapted, so here it is <br/>
without having to subscribe to emails and reminders and so forth:<br/>
<br/>
Make a morning routine and evening routine ON PAPER, and do it. Spend however <br/>
many minutes in the morning and in the evening, and it prevents things from <br/>
building up, including panic and resentment. Keep your Paper handy until it <br/>
becomes engraved in your brain. If you stray from it, get back on it. Don&#39;t <br/>
say it doesn&#39;t work and abandon it. It works. Just do it. <br/>
<br/>
Keep a calendar, it saves time and money (i have spent so much in library <br/>
fines do to disorganization it&#39;s not funny) Flylady has a big notebook, I <br/>
have everything scaled down to fit in a few pages in a planner or even a <br/>
small packet. Go to fineprint.com and d/l a free program to scale down your <br/>
printable pages to save space, paper and ink. <br/>
<br/>
How I incorporated zones: Flylady breaks up each area of the house into 4 or <br/>
5 zones, working on one zone each week. I cannot neglect part of the house <br/>
for a month or longer, so I line them up to the days of the week, monday=zone <br/>
1, tuesday=zone 2 etc. Make a master list of things that are important to you <br/>
and then on that day, pick one and do it for 15 minutes, if you can&#39;t do it <br/>
for one week, no biggie, pick that zone up the next time. Do the same things <br/>
the same day every week, like pay the bills on friday, wash the towels and <br/>
whites on monday.... things won&#39;t have a chance to pile up...Practice the do <br/>
it now method, pick up things as you move through the house, put things away <br/>
as soon as you are done with them, open the mail over a trash can, you get <br/>
the idea.....it&#39;s rather simple but doesn&#39;t occur naturally in the <br/>
organized-challenged such as myself...<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t get up everyday and do the simple things like get dressed and <br/>
cleaned up and make my bed, I wander aimlessly the rest of the day. If I do <br/>
my routines consistently, I can forget about whether laundry is piled up, <br/>
what I am going to cook for dinner, etc and really BE with my kids. We can <br/>
just get up and go on a field trip when the mood strikes us or when the <br/>
weather hits 50degrees, like on tuesday. It works for us.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone needs help establishing routines and zones, you can go to <br/>
Flylady.net and get the info there, you don&#39;t have to subscribe to the email <br/>
list. The emails can be counterproductive IMO. They are designed to get you <br/>
into a habit then you need to unsub and do it yourself, no excuses. Or accept <br/>
the chaos you create. I&#39;m not the type to accept the chaos, I want something <br/>
better for myself and my family and it&#39;s not that difficult to attain once <br/>
you get yourself into a groove. HTH!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350078768">Hi Aug,<br/>
This is just what I have done with FlyLady. I still do get the reminders but <br/>
I don&#39;t open them anymore I just use them as an end of the day mintal check <br/>
list. I go down all of them, deleting as I go and saying to myself &quot;I did <br/>
that, I did that&quot;. It just gives me a little reward at the end of the day. <br/>
I, to, am finding that the week long zones are not working and I love your <br/>
zone a day thing! I will have to try that. Good thinking!<br/>

<br/>
Most of what you wrote makes a ton of sense, and it&#39;s not a problem, but this <br/>
is offensive to me, because the suggestion is that not doing flylady-type <br/>
cleaning is equal to the creation of chaos.<br/>
<br/>
And that either we all accept chaos or we clean as well as you do.<br/>
<br/>
And it suggests that we don&#39;t &quot;want something better&quot; for ourselves and our <br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
You probably clean lots better than I do, but maybe I read and write better <br/>
than you do.  And whether reading and writing are valuable or not *IS* <br/>
important when people are coming to a written-word site voluntarily and <br/>
asking in words for help, in words.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You probably clean lots better than I do, but maybe I read and write better <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I suck at cleaning LOL. But finding things that are helpful and passing <br/>
them along is part of who I am. I just try to share what works for me or what <br/>
has helped me. Not trying to offend anyone who is comfortable with a <br/>
different standard. If having organization that leads to patience is better <br/>
for me and my family, it doesn&#39;t necessarily imply that someone with a <br/>
different situation is worse.  How it relates to my attempt at an unschooling <br/>
life: if my daughter wants to get up and cook something, I am more likely to <br/>
relax and just let her if there is a clean counter to cook on. She almost <br/>
caught a notebook on fire once. I may not be as laid back as some of the <br/>
seasoned unschoolers here, but I am a lot more relaxed than I was before. I <br/>
am a perfectionist and I just want to help others like myself with common <br/>
goals or similar suffering.  I come here to contribute, not argue. Also to <br/>
learn and grow.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, maybe it&#39;s the way I come across, but <br/>
when I make a different choice for my family, I often get the &quot;are you saying <br/>
the way I do it isn&#39;t good enough?&quot; defense. ESPECIALLY among fellow parents. <br/>
My choice to homeschool implies schooling families are inferior, my choice to <br/>
breastfeed implies formula is inferior, it goes on and on.  Can&#39;t someone do <br/>
something that is best for them without apologizing for making others feel <br/>
defensive? I will never assert my way is the best way or the only way. I <br/>
honestly appreciate when someone can honestly tell me if I come across <br/>
offensive without taking it personally. I am eager to learn to communicate <br/>
more effectively, and am open to suggestions. <br/>

<br/>
Something is making my keyboard launch mail prematurely today.  Sorry about <br/>
the two blanks before this.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can DO it, but it&#39;s the way you chose to justify it that ended up <br/>
calling the rest of us names.<br/>
<br/>
When someone says to me (which they&#39;ve done lots, at conferences usually) <br/>
&quot;Unschooling is fine for you, but WE want our kids to go to COLLEGE,&quot; the <br/>
implication is that I don&#39;t want my kids to go to college, or that my kids <br/>
won&#39;t be college material and they&#39;re not willing to be the child-ruining <br/>
future-denying kind of person I am.<br/>
<br/>
Had they just said &quot;Can unschoolers go to college?&quot; and give me the <br/>
opportunity to say &quot;Sure, lots do&quot; they could still be thinking all they want <br/>
that I&#39;m a slacker and that they&#39;re never going to unschool, but they didn&#39;t <br/>
SAY by setting up a dichotomy and parking themselves firmly on the winning <br/>
side that I was the irresponsible mother of children who would never go to <br/>
college.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s subtle.  And I know I&#39;m guilty sometimes of suggesting <br/>
that a curriculum will kill a child&#39;s desire to learn.  And I know I&#39;m guilty <br/>
sometimes of saying that I really want my kids to have peace and confidence, <br/>
and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t make a bunch of rules (implying, when I&#39;m not careful, <br/>
that people with a bunch of rules won&#39;t have confident kids who are at peace.<br/>
<br/>
But really, I do believe that.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe my suggestion (so indelicately put) is not to make those statements <br/>
unless you MEAN to make them, and if you mean to make them, be willing to <br/>
defend them.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I was testy earlier.  I&#39;ve lived a full and happy life amidst clutter <br/>
and I know lots of happy people whose houses have piles of books and shelves <br/>
with great cloth half falling off, and drawers of trim and tools and <br/>
treasures and pretty rocks, and I&#39;d rather be at their houses than the clean <br/>
houses of boring people with nothing to talk about except there&#39;s a new <br/>
improved citrus cleaner (not that I don&#39;t love citrus cleaners, there&#39;s just <br/>
not a lot to say about them).  So maybe it&#39;s just that I&#39;m comfortable in <br/>
clutter.  I love Usborne books, and I&#39;ve heard people say they can&#39;t even <br/>
read them because they&#39;re cluttery.    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have lived a life choked by clutter and excess, and have trouble shining <br/>
through it. I can&#39;t talk with anyone about anything in my house if I won&#39;t <br/>
them in from embarrassment LOL. Flylady terminology: C.H.A.O.S.=Cant Have <br/>
Anyone Over Syndrome. My house is not perfectly cleaned, but it is under <br/>
better control than it used to be. You ought to see my basement where the <br/>
clutter still resides, coincidentally I named it the homeschooling room <br/>
because half the time I don&#39;t care what it looks like, as long as it is rich <br/>
in resources and inviting to explore. That&#39;s where the shelves of books and <br/>
tables covered with overflowing boxes of supplies and unfinished projects and <br/>
tubs of toys live. Sometimes we love spending time down there. Other times we <br/>
have to get the hell away to clearer, calmer areas of the house. Again, I <br/>
don&#39;t apologize for what I am trying to say, because I know my intent was <br/>
good,  but for the way I say it. Sometimes I just rub people the wrong way. <br/>
I&#39;ll work on it &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391839749">Hey, I resemble that statement.  LOL  I think Usborne books are a great<br/>
quality and I love the ones for little kids...great drawings, but the busy<br/>
ones are too cluttery for me.  I can&#39;t even focus on them to read them.  I<br/>
feel the same way about my house.   I feel way more at peace in neat (not<br/>
perfectly neat, but reasonably neat) surroundings.  I still let my kids<br/>
craft all over my kitchen, cook, play beanies all over the house, have<br/>
numerous pets, build box houses or fairy houses, etc. but I like to keep at<br/>
least one room a haven of peacefulness that I can hide in when I am feeling<br/>
overwhelmed by clutter.  I also like to find the floor of the house at least<br/>
every few days.  If the kids don&#39;t feel like they are done with something I<br/>
don&#39;t put it away, (think lincoln logs)  but if they don&#39;t play with them<br/>
for a few days, I do put them away.  I definitely get overwhelmed by too<br/>
much clutter.  I think it&#39;s all about finding a way to make everyone<br/>
happy...to find a common preference.<br/>

  I love Usborne books, and I&#39;ve heard people say they can&#39;t even <br/>
read them because they&#39;re cluttery.    <br/>

<br/>
Hi Ang,<br/>
I think it *is* okay to live in a &quot;chaotic cluttered &#39;creative&#39; <br/>
house&quot; if that environment and atmosphere is supporting a happy, <br/>
connected family.  Perhaps *your* family doesn&#39;t thrive in such an <br/>
environment (or perhaps it&#39;s just *you* who doesn&#39;t thrive), but <br/>
there is no reason for you to imply that others who do are <br/>
making &quot;excuses&quot; for the way they live.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; crazy stressed mom.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*If* a crazy stressed house does indeed lead to a crazy stressed mom, <br/>
but one does not necessarily lead to the other.  There are several <br/>
things that make me crazy and stressed, but a messy house isn&#39;t on <br/>
the list.  Also, I think it&#39;s important to emphasize that a messy <br/>
house isn&#39;t necessarily a &quot;crazy, stressed&quot; home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to pick apart everything you&#39;re saying, Ang, but I <br/>
think that it&#39;s worthwhile to emphasize that while you have an <br/>
opinion that mess = stress, that equation cannot and should not be <br/>
applied to all families and homes.  My sister is one of my dearest <br/>
friends, and she is one of the most unflappable, most comfortable-<br/>
with-herself people I&#39;ve known; a housekeeper she is most definitely <br/>
NOT.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cleaned up and make my bed, I wander aimlessly the rest of the day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now...don&#39;t you know that after 9:00 a.m. pajamas become <br/>
*loungewear*? &lt;g&gt;  And I couldn&#39;t wander aimlessly even if I wanted <br/>
to. Lucky you!<br/>

They are designed to get you <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; into a habit then you need to unsub and do it yourself, no excuses. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or accept <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the chaos you create. I&#39;m not the type to accept the chaos, I want <br/>
 </span></blockquote>something <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; better for myself and my family and it&#39;s not that difficult to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>attain once <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you get yourself into a groove.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, now...that sounds a bit judgmental, and I hope you didn&#39;t mean <br/>
it that way.  Why do you think your way is &quot;something better&quot; that we <br/>
should try to attain?  The implication is that those moms who <br/>
contentedly live in chaos don&#39;t want what&#39;s best for their families, <br/>
or are making excuses for their chaos.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lived in chaos...spending 5 months last year in the hospital <br/>
with Kevin was very stressful, and I can assure you that the <br/>
household mess was the last worry on my mind...but was content that <br/>
my children were being cared for and supported during the times I <br/>
couldn&#39;t be with them.  And I&#39;ve lived with neatness and order, and <br/>
I&#39;ve lived mostly in between the two...and I&#39;ve managed to maintain <br/>
my priorities (family first), my perspective (this too shall pass) <br/>
and my sense of humor during all of them.<br/>

I can wander but VERY FAST, like a pinball.  I go from room to room doing <br/>
part of something. &lt;g&gt;  I bring in a load of firewood, but leave the cart by <br/>
the fireplace because I see a video that goes into a case I saw in another <br/>
room, and when I get there I see laundry and then the phone rings so the <br/>
laundry pile ends up by the address book because someone called for someone <br/>
else&#39;s phone number, and then...<br/>
<br/>
Slowly I stir my stuff. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
