&gt;Subject: searching for homeschooling families<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a Littleton, Colorado, homeschooling mother working on a book <br/>
&gt;about homeschooling families and the home-based businesses they own <br/>
&gt;and operate. At this time I am looking for families to interview who <br/>
&gt;are engaged in both pursuits. Anyone interested may email me to <br/>
&gt;receive a questionnaire by return email; if the family would not <br/>
&gt;mind potentially being contacted by phone, please include a phone <br/>
&gt;number as well. All families highlighted in the book will receive a <br/>
&gt;free copy at publication time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I appreciate you making this available to your readership. If you <br/>
&gt;have any questions for me, please don&#39;t hesitate to write back. </span></blockquote></div>
