<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315318457">My kids have been collecting the state quarters as they come <br/>
out.  The holder they have for them has two slots for each state, one <br/>
for Denver minted coins and one for Philadelphia minted coins.  Thing <br/>
is that Philadelphia minted coins are pretty scarce out here on the <br/>
west coast.  The first couple of years we traded with a friend who <br/>
lived back east, but they moved back to California.<br/>
<br/>
So...I was wondering if some other east coast family would be <br/>
interested in trading us some Philly minted state quarters for some <br/>
Denver ones.  We recently had lots of coins come into our lives so we <br/>
have a pretty complete set of Denver ones.  Email me off list if <br/>
you&#39;re interested.<br/>
