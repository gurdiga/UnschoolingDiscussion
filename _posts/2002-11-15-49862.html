&lt;&lt; Wouldn&#39;t it be wild if musical intelligence turned out to be the greatest <br/>
 indicating factor for unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well....my dh is definitely more of a musician, and less into the whole idea <br/>
of unschooling. Although very free thinking in most ways, he still isn&#39;t into <br/>
the unschooling thing. BUT, he never, ever gives me grief. AND he doesn&#39;t <br/>
complain that the kids aren&#39;t learning, or they should get off the video <br/>
games or anything...<br/>
So maybe there is something to that. Hmmmmmmmm<br/>
<br/>
He is also adopted. Without that disorientation thing Betsy was alluding to.<br/>
He was very, very content to be adopted. They were his REAL parents and then <br/>
he had a birth mother. They talked about it from the time he could <br/>
understand, so he always knew he was adopted. Had a special &quot;chosen day&quot; (the <br/>
day they brought him home) which we still celebrate. Our kids got a half <br/>
Birthday thrown in because they thought it unfair that Daddy had a Birthday <br/>
AND a chosen day.<br/>
Aren&#39;t birth kids special too? :) so we have all kinds of things to celebrate <br/>
around here!<br/>
