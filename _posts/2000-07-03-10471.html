&lt;&lt; I have a question... How do any of you get anything else done in the house <br/>
 with having the kids there all day?  I need to clean out the freezer, <br/>
washing <br/>
 the windows outside.... Do you just include your kids in these tasks (then <br/>
it <br/>
 turns a 1 hour job into a 4 hour job) or what? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I recently stated an experiment which has worked well for me in this area. <br/>
First of all, the kids 9yod and 20mod, as well as stepsons when they are <br/>
here, are involved in lots of tasks. For example, the 9yo does lots of chores <br/>
independently while the 20 mo helps unload the dishwasher. The 9yo is also <br/>
great at distracting the baby so I can get other things done.<br/>
My experiment has been to limit actual housework to 2 hours in the morning <br/>
and 1/2 hour in the evening. I only do emergency stuff in between, i.e. <br/>
spilled food. It has worked well for me because part of this time can overlap <br/>
with my daughter&#39;s many projects and I can just lend an ear when she needs <br/>
it. I only run errands when I&#39;m on my way somewhere else. We have swimming <br/>
lessons at 9am so I leave at 8 and pick up dry cleaning and whatever else on <br/>
the way. <br/>
The best thing has been that housework no longer seems like a never ending <br/>
cycle. I know that once I start, I get off in 2 hours. (I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
reducing to 1.5 hrs in the a.m.) <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Am I just being overconcerned about<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps.    If they want to help you with projects  (some kids find window<br/>
washing fun)  then you can console yourself with the idea of future<br/>
competence.   Could be that the future reality is about as true as &quot;pie in<br/>
the sky when you die&quot;   but you might feel better for the moment.    On the<br/>
other hand they might be just as interested in following their own projects.<br/>
And yes,   5 year olds can definitely have their own projects.    You might<br/>
want to do a little research on the idea of &quot;benign neglect&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As for a toddler,   providing a safe environment for them to explore with<br/>
you in &quot;earshot&quot;   doing your own tasks  may allow them to &quot;entertain&quot;<br/>
themselves.    I can also remember actually &quot;hiring&quot;  my then 6 year old to<br/>
&quot;entertain&quot;  his toddler brother.    Sometimes the payment  involved a<br/>
promise to be sure the 6 yo  later had time to himself without interference<br/>
from toddler  &quot;helping&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You needn&#39;t feel your duty is to constantly entertain.   On the other hand<br/>
you might want to allow yourself to be entertained by them while they are<br/>
young.  Time will come that  you are not their most important audience.<br/>
Get it while you can!<br/>

&gt;Dawn F<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I don&#39;t entertain my kids, and I don&#39;t feel guilty about that.  I will play with them and read to them, some of the time, but when I have something that needs to be done, than they have to amuse themselves.  That&#39;s just the way it is.  If I need to do the dishes or mop the kitchen floor or clean out the refridgerator or oven, I ask them to leave the kitchen until I am done.  Period.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, they can do the same thing if they are playing and do not want to be disturbed, they are free to close their door and be left alone as long as they like.  I expect them to extend the same courtesy to me, to a certain degree.  I can&#39;t be expected to be completely left alone, given their ages.  I have to keep an ear on them at all times at least.  But if I am doing something and they are gumming up the works, I will ask them to please find something else to do until I finish my job.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, there are things that they can &quot;help&quot; with.  When we vacum, my 2 year old loves to go and get his toy vacum and help out.  They REALLY love to help me water the plants in the garden, or do any digging and weeding, etc.  When Dad is working on one of our many remodeling projects, the kids get their toy tools and &quot;help&quot; him.  When we do laundry they like to help throw the clothes into the machines and help me sort socks.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my jobs are done on a casual schedule, whenever the mood strikes me and the kids allow me the time.  Some are done at naptime (like maybe mopping) and some after they go to bed (like balancing the checkbook) but most are done around them as they buzz around like a couple of tornadoes.<br/>
<br/>
When they were not both walking well (2 year old took his time to learn that) it was nearly impossible to get any outside chores done, like running errands.  Now though, I can take them with me in our van and they hold my hand or ride in the carts and I am able to do a number of things.  We only do our grocery shopping once every two weeks and we both go, taking two carts, one for each toddler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557197261">Starting as soon as they could toodle they all had jobs--folding laundry,<br/>
putting away groceries, putting dishes away, pulling weeds in the garden or<br/>
simply fetching and carrying.  This continues with more as they grow. <br/>
Everyone has responsibilities from cleaning their rooms to cleaning up<br/>
after they haul out a project or games.<br/>
<br/>
Today middle kidlet learned how to adjust a carberator as he wanted to take<br/>
the mini-bike out.  He is twelve and was told that with age and wants come<br/>
the responsibilities of checking the oil and adjusting the carb (it is a<br/>
tempermental beast &lt;g&gt;).  Right now he is folding the newspapers that he<br/>
will deliver tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Youngest kidlet is eight and she is folding laundry (complaining like crazy<br/>
but she is a Taurus.  Anyone know why they are called bulls and not mules<br/>
&lt;g&gt;).  She also loaded the dryer with the next load.<br/>
<br/>
Eldest kidlet (16) pruned (sawed) the dead limbs out of the rhodie and<br/>
vacuumed the upstairs after he washed dishes from breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
When I clean the fridge or the freezer it is a family affair.  When I do<br/>
the intense vacuuming, everyone has a job moving and replacing so I get all<br/>
the nocks and crannies.<br/>

sometimes things aren&#39;t done the way I&#39;d prefer them to be, and I have had to <br/>
try to learn to accept it.  Also, when dh is home, I enlist his help to get <br/>
things done, which helps quite a lot.  Aside from that, I just have to live <br/>
with the fact that I am not going to have a house as clean as I&#39;d like all of <br/>
the time, and many things get accomplished at a much slower pace than they <br/>
might be if there was more available time.  I think it&#39;s an adjustment to the <br/>

Mine are nearly 5 and 9 mos and I think I&#39;m going to have to learn to give up <br/>
the perfectionism when it comes to keeping my house clean.  I&#39;m beginning to <br/>
see how it&#39;s a different lifestyle, not just keeping them home from school <br/>
and that&#39;s all there is.  We had a wonderful day yesterday... Zak was into <br/>
building all kinds of things yesterday... I gave them baths at 10am as that&#39;s <br/>
what Zak wanted to do so he could play &quot;boats&quot; and I put Max in there as <br/>
well.. I just sat and blew bubbles for them for 1/2hr, then put the baby down <br/>
for a nap and Zak wanted to build his train track.  I asked if he wanted me <br/>
to play he said &quot;no thanks I can do it all by myself&quot; so I got to go in my <br/>
office for 1 hour (it&#39;s in the house).  I called my best friend (whose <br/>
looking into the homeschooling now!!!!), then someone from the my local <br/>
homeschooling group to set up a swim date with our kids and then some <br/>
work.... <br/>
<br/>
I think that sometimes I still have a hard time going from being the woman <br/>
that was very organized in the working world and having to schedule <br/>
everything to just letting things happen now that I have 2 kids.<br/>

Thank you everyone for your input so far, it has been most helpful and useful <br/>

Usually I either let them help me or I get out the crayons,ect. for an art <br/>

my time too, this is a huge advantage of not living by school <br/>
schedules for me)  I get online and chat and email, and soak in the <br/>
bath with dh and watch unsuitable tv, LOL  I just don&#39;t do <br/>
housework at night.  Sometimes I might work on &#39;work,&#39; but not <br/>
often.  <br/>

<br/>
Not sure why they are not called mules, but they are definately headstrong <br/>
and once on a path will not get off it.  That makes them really good at <br/>
completing things, but when they don&#39;t want to do something, they become very <br/>
very stubborn.  My first husband was a Taurus and a nightmare to deal with <br/>

I try  to get them involved, I make a game of it, I help out, I even will tell them that the toy will be in time out for a few days if they cannot care for it properly by putting it away when they are done with it.  <br/>
<br/>
But they are at the unreasonable and emotionally explosive age when they cannot always be talked into something, no matter how sound the reasoning.  In the end, I get exponentially more stress and work than if I had just done it myself, and they seem to have gotten no easier to convince yet, most of the time.  Plus I have a very hyperactive three year old, which complicates things all the more.<br/>

I am not really all that anal about it, and I can leave things sometimes, but when it gets to be too much stuff I begin to feel disorganized and chaotic myself, in my mind.  I like to have the house reaonably clean and well ordered and I am an organizational person, so I look for ways to make it easier and quicker to keep things picked up and find what I need.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to have a very busy and stressful office job where I was responsible for keeping 100+ people on time, schedules sychronized, meeting scheduled and notified, mail delivered, messages given, filing done and interoffice library cataloged and tracked.  I have to relearn how to relax about scheduling and organization a bit.<br/>

&lt;&lt; OK...mine are toddlers.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Zak was 3, he went through the terrible twos!!! And we had all the <br/>
throwing toys etc... It was hard on my nerves, but I just persisted with the <br/>
picking up and engaging him in those activities... I was very glad when the <br/>
3&#39;s tantrums were over with, because now at approaching 5 Zak will say &quot;I <br/>
have too many toys out here I&#39;ll need to pick some up&quot;  Sometimes when it&#39;s <br/>
time for a bath I&#39;ll say &quot;what do you think needs to happen next?&quot; and he&#39;ll <br/>
say &quot;pick up my toys&quot;  (these are the ones in the living room, dining room <br/>
where everyone else lives)... <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there it does get a bit easier.  I just gave my 9 month old a bath <br/>
(very poopie diaper at 1:30pm) and of course he keeps standing up in the <br/>
bath, which is a safety issue and I have to keep sitting him down.  I forgot <br/>
I had to go through all of this again and I know it will be ok.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So what do you do when you ask them to take care of a chore (pickng up a <br/>
mess of toys, say) and they throw a tantrum and refuse? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My experience (such as it is, grain of salt, and all that) is that toddlers <br/>
-- 3 yo -- how far beyond??  -- just don&#39;t get the whole reason behind why we <br/>
need to clean up.  They just got the stuff out where they want it and now <br/>
this crazy woman (me) wants them to put it away??  This makes no sense.  Add <br/>
to this the attention span of a gnat, and you get a lot of toys out at once.<br/>
<br/>
No perfect answer here tho -- my house is a mess most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
I just think it is beyond the understanding of most 3 yo or younger children <br/>
to do anything as complex as &quot;pick up these toys&quot; or to see the need to do it <br/>
if they do understand.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I have pretty low standards of housekeeping.   But I just try to <br/>
keep a reasonable level of usability.  If there is so much stuff out that you <br/>
can&#39;t use the next thing, sometimes that actually seems to make sense to <br/>
them.  Of course, mine are a little older now -- 5 1/2 and 7 yo -- so that <br/>
helps.<br/>
<br/>
Or not.  My husband is a prime example of that.  (Maybe it&#39;s hereditary! :) )<br/>
<br/>
Low standards, that&#39;s my answer.  And patience.  Large doses!<br/>
<br/>
Well, good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008820038">If you have structured nap and bedtimes I can see this working.  <br/>
but my kids both outgrew naps ages ago, and they go to bed when <br/>
they&#39;re tired, which is not a good time to start tidying up, in my <br/>
experience.  Their room gets done once a week, and the rest of <br/>
the house that day (well the next day now...) but the living spaces <br/>
get down when I&#39;m sick of falling over stuff.  Dh complains about <br/>
some stuff, like the box of empty cardboard boxes and stuff (the <br/>
cutting and sticking box) in the living/ dining room (I really don&#39;t <br/>
like this house...) but never does anything about it himself.  I think <br/>
&#39;owning the problem&#39; can help figure out who should be doing the <br/>
tidying up &lt;g&gt;<br/>

No Stella you do something for yourself like reading these messages &lt;g&gt;  When <br/>
my hubby came in from work this evening he went straight for playing with the <br/>
kids and walked by the mess in the kitchen, plus the grocery shopping I&#39;d <br/>
just done... So I went in and said &quot;I know you want to play with the kids <br/>
because you haven&#39;t seen them all day, but right now I need you to clean up <br/>
the crap in the kitchen and I&#39;ll feed the baby&quot;  I felt so much better.  I <br/>
let my dh clean up as much as possible.  Having been in the airforce he&#39;s a <br/>
bit obsessed with having a tidy house and so my attitude lately is &quot;you go <br/>
for it Steve, I&#39;m going to sit and watch the Eastenders (British Soap))...<br/>
