<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824746513">&lt;&lt;&lt;Any of you ever deal with the friend issues and what did you do? Do I <br/>
speak<br/>
or zip it?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is extremely long, but here goes...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter had a friend, E, that lived just around the corner.  They became <br/>
friends around the age of 8 or so.  E always made me feel uncomfortable.  <br/>
She was a bit overbearing and pushy which irritated me a lot of the time, <br/>
but it never seemed to bother Haleigh at all.  I&#39;d ask if &#39;xyz&#39; bothered her <br/>
and most of the time she acted like she had no idea what I was talking <br/>
about.  There were a lot of little things that bothered me about E, so I <br/>
figured it was my own biases or experiences that were coming through...not <br/>
really reflecting E so much as myself.<br/>
<br/>
For example:  E always &#39;picked&#39; at her crotch.  Somewhat like picking a <br/>
wedgie but in a constant, obvious kind of way and up front, not behind.  I <br/>
know children who are sexually abused ten to have these sort of reactions <br/>
and that thought never left my mind.  She was also always dirty, wore <br/>
clothes that were either way too big or way too small.  She was overweight <br/>
and had very large breasts, in proportion to her overall size and never wore <br/>
a training bra.  She really needed one.  Much of the time, her breasts were <br/>
exposed through huge armholes of shirts without sleeves.<br/>
<br/>
There were other things that bothered us as well...my husband and I.  She <br/>
made a very big deal about whispering and telling secrets.  I realize girls <br/>
love to do these things and it is quite normal.  However, there seemed to be <br/>
something different about it with E.  Not really something I could put my <br/>
finger on, but something my husband and I just couldn&#39;t get past.<br/>
<br/>
She was ALWAYS at our house.  She would show up early in the am and I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t see or hear from her parents at all.  Many times we would call and <br/>
not get an answer.  I started to feel like a babysitter.  There were many <br/>
times I would tell E it was time to go home and she would say her parents <br/>
were at church, of all places!, and wouldn&#39;t be back until X time.  No one <br/>
even TOLD us we were babysitting!  Once, I sent her home and she came back <br/>
FIVE hours later and said her parents still weren&#39;t home and could she <br/>
please spend the night.  That was my last straw.  I called her mother and <br/>
had it out.  She made some excuse that E had said it was ok to stay with us <br/>
so I told her from then on, we...the mother and I...would have to speak <br/>
directly any time E came over.  We still had problems but nothing compared <br/>
to what started happening after that.<br/>
<br/>
Haleigh began to get very depressed.  I tried talking to er numerous times <br/>
and she would tell me it was nothing.  I knew better and gently prodded for <br/>
some idea of what was going on.  Turns out no one wanted to play with her <br/>
but E.  Everyone in the neighborhood disliked E and because Haleigh was her <br/>
friend they wanted nothing to do with her either.  I happened to be outside <br/>
once and overheard a huge fight between about 10 kids, all telling Haleigh <br/>
and E to get lost.  One of the kids belonged to my neighbor so I talked with <br/>
him, the dad, about it.  e called his daughter in and they explained that it <br/>
wasn&#39;t Haleigh that was doing anything.  E was calliing people names and <br/>
Haleigh just stood by silently and watched it happen.  I had a long talk <br/>
with Haleigh and E.  For a short while, things improved again.<br/>
<br/>
The last time they were together, Nicholette came in crying and screaming.  <br/>
She took me outside and showed me the most horrific thing I think I&#39;ve ever <br/>
seen a child do.  E had taken Nicholette&#39;s brand new doll and painted it red <br/>
with nail polish.  She drew a slash across the neck with blood dripping down <br/>
and cut it almost completely off with a pair of scissors.  It was tied with <br/>
a rope by the neck and hung on our back fence.  The entire doll was almost <br/>
completely covered in &#39;blood&#39;.  By this time, E was gone and Haleigh was <br/>
sitting in the treehouse crying.  She was afraid to tell me because she <br/>
thought I would think she did it!  That was totally unlike her!<br/>
<br/>
I ended up going to the police with the doll and my long story.  I was <br/>
traumatized and didn&#39;t know what else to do.  I explained the story, my <br/>
concerns, all the little things that bothered me.  The officer told me they <br/>
had  long history with E&#39;s family.  Her mother had just been committed to <br/>
the hospital for a suicide attempt.  E had told me her mom was in the <br/>
hospital but said it was for diabetes.  Her Dad told us the same thing!  The <br/>
officer als told us that there were &#39;suspicions&#39; of other &#39;inappropriate <br/>
activity&#39; in the home and they were under investigation.  I was appalled and <br/>
horrified.<br/>
<br/>
We sat down with Haleigh and tried to explain everything to her in terms she <br/>
would understand without overloading her with unneeded information that <br/>
might scare her even more.  By that time she was almost 10.  It was very <br/>
hard but once she was relived of the relationship, she blossomed and became <br/>
our happy child again.<br/>
<br/>
All that time, I thought I was helping by offering a positive environment <br/>
for E to be in.  I knew her parents weren&#39;t the most interested, but I also <br/>
had all those nagging thoughts which I tried to reason away.  Her parents <br/>
always seemed to have the right answer for everything and I know now I was <br/>
far too trusting of them.  I learned an awful lesson.<br/>
<br/>
We are now very careful about who our children have as friends.  I wish I <br/>
had trusted my own instincts and reported my suspicions in the beginning.  I <br/>
wish I had connected my daughters depression to her friendship with E.  I <br/>
wish I wasn&#39;t so hard pressed to &quot;save&quot; E that I let my own daughter suffer <br/>
as a result.  For some reason, I just didn&#39;t see it when it was hitting me <br/>
right in the nose.<br/>
<br/>
I want my children to be able to make friends and chose their own friends <br/>
but at the same time, I am now very aware of any warning signs and address <br/>
them immediately.  I follow my gut feelings and if things don&#39;t feel right, <br/>
I step in.  I&#39;m sure this is far more seious than what you are dealing with. <br/>
  I just wanted to share what happened to us because I think it is so easy <br/>
to want to &#39;save&#39; children in bad and unfortunate situations.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
*see* it for what it was until it damaged my child.  I think young children <br/>
are very imperssionable, especially those that have a narrower group of <br/>
friends, and are more willing to hang on rather than look away and find <br/>
someone else.  I find this true of a lot of homeschoolers I know...sometimes <br/>
my family included!  When you aren&#39;t involved in church or many outside <br/>
activities and the neighborhood isn&#39;t swarming with children it can be <br/>
difficult to provide a large assortment of friendly possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you WILL follow your instincts and get to the bottom of any problens <br/>
you have with this family.  I would definitely speak up and if the answers I <br/>
got didn&#39;t match what I was seeing I&#39;d throw up the red flags and monitor <br/>
closely and  wouldn&#39;t wait around until something really bad happened.  What <br/>
happened to us was very extreme, but even smaller things can be damaging to <br/>
a child&#39;s self esteem and reasoning abilities.  It sounds like the red flags <br/>
are going up for your son also.  Something I would for sure address.  I&#39;d <br/>
also check the status of the rabies shots on the dog and report it if he <br/>
isn&#39;t up to date.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I did address the doll issue with E&#39;s parents and she LAUGHED!  &quot;Kids <br/>
will be kids and they do silly stuff like that.&quot;  I told her I completely <br/>
disagreed and that E was no longer welcome in our home or allowed to contact <br/>
Haleigh.  It was one of the hardest things I&#39;ve had to do but I&#39;m SO glad I <br/>
did it.  Funny, SHE thought *I* was being overprotective!  Wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
hurt her to take a few pointers, if you ask me!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this went on so long!  I hope things work out for you and your son.  <br/>
It&#39;s hard being a parent sometimes, isn&#39;t it!?!<br/>

That was so sad. Tears came to my eyes for you and your daughter but also <br/>
that little girl &quot;E&quot;. <br/>
I really want to follow my instinct I know a few people who did not and had <br/>
awful situations.<br/>
I will be talking with him today, he was talking about it last night and <br/>
spoke of not playing with the boy again.  I will also add that he has been <br/>
barking at me the past several days and I have had to just stop and look at <br/>
him and ask him what&#39;s up. <br/>
Thank you for responding, thank you for sharing this experience.<br/>

LOL, okay, I&#39;m totally confused here, but are you referring to the child or <br/>
the dog??  Haleigh has LOVED dogs since shw was two.  We got a copy of 101 <br/>
Dalmatians and she fell in love!  It didn&#39;t take long for her to start <br/>
crawling around and barking.  It was cute for a while but within a year, <br/>
that was the primary use of her vocal chords!  The first time we met my bil, <br/>
Haleigh was 3.  She never spoke a word to him.  She was all barks!  I was <br/>
actually a embarassed (dumb) and kept trying to get her to say at least <br/>
&quot;Hi&quot;, but she would only bark.  So Micha, bil, just barked back!  For the <br/>
next year, he never heard her say a word!  Their sole form of communication <br/>
was barking!  Haleigh had been talking in sentences since well before her <br/>
first birthday, a very early talker, but Micha didn&#39;t believe me for the <br/>
longest time!  It was great to see him embrace her chosen form of &#39;talking&#39;. <br/>
  Really changed how I viewed the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
Up until about two years ago, Haleigh still barked a lot, though only during <br/>
playtime with her sisters.  Needless to say, I now have a houseful of <br/>
children who bark constantly!!  I know people must think our kids are very <br/>
odd. &lt;bwg&gt;  I remember thinking the same thing once!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is a useless story if you were talking about the actual dog <br/>
barking &lt;g&gt; but I just wanted to say that some kids just use it as an <br/>
outlet, I think, and it can become a habit, especially if they get a good <br/>
response, like an uncle barking back!  Maybe to get attention, maybe to be <br/>
funny or just to have fun, I really don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve tried to ask Haleigh <br/>
about it but she is &quot;too cool&quot; now to remember that fondly and rolls her <br/>
eyes when I talk about it.  Teenagers!  Well, ok, preteens, but she acts <br/>
like a teenager! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Haleigh was an only child until the age of 5.  My daughter, Hillary, was <br/>
born when Haleigh was 23 months old but she was stillborn.  I often wonder <br/>
if maybe this was Haleigh&#39;s escape...to act like a dog.  If memory serves <br/>
me, it seems like it was very near that time.  I&#39;m not sure, though, because <br/>
I have a bad habit of blocking out traumatic times in my life and sadly, do <br/>
not remember much around that time.  :(  Maybe this boy (*if* he&#39;s the one <br/>
barking &lt;g&gt;) just uses barking as an outlet.  A way to escape.  Or maybe I&#39;m <br/>
just going too deep and digging too much.   Something to consider, I guess!<br/>

<br/>
I guess I should have used a different word. He has been barking meaning <br/>
snappy,quick,grouchy since he has been hanging around this boy. My son that <br/>
is.<br/>
I called the town to find out if the dog is registered and they say no. So I <br/>
guess I will have to report the situation but then again his doctor will <br/>
today too. They said they will need to quarantine the dog for 10 days. Bummer <br/>
but its gota be. They also told me there three are two dogs running our <br/>
neighborhood which I knew but being that this dog is chained day and night <br/>
there is a good chance it needs to be looked at any way. Dustin says he look <br/>
like (sp) Cojo all nasty looking and dirty. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We shall see what happens.<br/>
I feel bad but you know what we ahve two dogs a shep/lab mix and a Brittany <br/>
we dont chain them out and they are clean and have never bitten anyone. I <br/>
also hope they never do I certianly wouldnt want to be in this position <br/>
myself. <br/>
