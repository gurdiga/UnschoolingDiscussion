<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036119835">Thanks so much for the advice and personal experiences with doing a <br/>
home business while homeschooling.  It has really helped me with the <br/>
decision making/information gathering process that I am currently in <br/>
right now.  And, the other topic that is being discussed about <br/>
bedtimes is also helping my decision making process believe it or <br/>
not.  I was thinking about the fact that if I have daycare children <br/>
during the day, my older two can choose to sleep if they want to and <br/>
we can most certainly do some one on one things together in the <br/>
evening.<br/>
On a side note, concerning the bedtime ritual: for our family the <br/>
younger children being in bed is helpful to me in that I can get <br/>
some time alone (or with hubby or older two) to be able to read, <br/>
think, meditate, plan, or watch an adult movie if I want to.  Some <br/>
days it is imperative to my sanity! :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636464769">I hear ya there for us &#39;not having a bed time&#39; doesn&#39;t mean sometimes <br/>
I don&#39;t suggest or insist that my daughter goto bed.<br/>
<br/>
It just means there is no set time each night.<br/>
<br/>
Not so much that I need down time (not that I don&#39;t appreciate <br/>
being &#39;alone&#39; at night) but when I can see her struggling with <br/>
behavior issues that show she needs rest or see her eyes fluttering <br/>
and don&#39;t want to have to carry her to bed later.<br/>
