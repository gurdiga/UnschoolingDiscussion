<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761001264">&lt;&lt;when we still lived in the yurt&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Todd, please tell more about this.  My dream as a child was to be a hermit<br/>
(at least that was the only term I knew then to partially describe my strong<br/>
desire for independence and self-sustenance).  Then I gave up &quot;childish<br/>
dreams&quot; and moved to the big city, met dh and had a pack of kids.  We now<br/>
(at my insistence) live on a couple of acres in a semi-rural area outside of<br/>
a city.  We partially homestead, raising much of our own food from the<br/>
organic garden, goats and rabbits.<br/>
<br/>
I daydream about living out in the middle of nowhere in a yurt.  When I talk<br/>
to dh about it, he looks at me from his &quot;brick home with pool, using the<br/>
corporate jet&quot; worldview and gives me a non-comprehending stare.  Sigh.<br/>
(Sadly, I love him dearly so spousal abandonment isn&#39;t an option &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
If others aren&#39;t interested, perhaps you could mail me off list.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re in the midst of relocating to a farm in NC. I&#39;ve looked into them, and <br/>
yurts are SO cool (and I LOVE round)---but a little &quot;too&quot; much for my mental <br/>
health and well-being! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve compromised on a round HOUSE with real walls and such! &lt;g&gt; Only three <br/>
interior walls, no doors. There&#39;ll be one great room:living/dining/kitchen, a <br/>
bath and our bedroom. We&#39;re planning a separate wing for the boys with a <br/>
living area, two small sleeping quarters and a bath. <br/>
<br/>
We thought about putting up a yurt for temporary housing while we build, but <br/>
it looks as if we won&#39;t need to :-(<br/>
<br/>
You could always get a small one on your two acres and have a suana in it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044052447">Hi everyone,<br/>
	Just a quick note since I just got home from a long day at work -<br/>
most of which was a ten-hour long meeting one of the outcomes of which was<br/>
that we&#39;ll be here at least 6 weeks longer than we originally intended<br/>
(but the longer we spend here the longer we get to stay home I suppose!)<br/>
	Anyway - I&#39;d be glad to talk about living in the yurt at some time<br/>
when I have more than a minute or two but in the meantime, you can read<br/>
the journal I kept while I was there at www.yurtsweetyurt.com.  We still<br/>
keep the site up as a blogger for us (mostly Sage is writing these days)<br/>
but if you click on &quot;yurt years&quot; to get to our older entries.<br/>
<br/>
-me<br/>
the only got to spend a total of fifteen minutes with his son before he<br/>
went to bed one :(<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Where are you putting your yurt? Do you have running<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On some very, very, very rural land we own.  (In winter, it&#39;s 40 minutes <br/>
from the hwy in a 4-wheel-drive truck then another mile in on an ATV.  In <br/>
summer, the road&#39;s okay for regular cars.)  It&#39;ll overlook a river, be <br/>
surrounded by mountain range and be just slightly above the fog belt so <br/>
things can get humid sometimes.  We&#39;re having mouse-problems in the <br/>
shack/cabin that was there when we bought the place, so one of my concerns <br/>
is about mice getting into the yurt.  Has anyone had to deal with yurts, <br/>
mice and/or humidity?<br/>
<br/>
We have a seasonal spring downslope and a 1500 gallon tank next to it, <br/>
already full.  We&#39;re hoping to solar-pump to a bigger tank upslope and <br/>
gravity-feed so I can have a real &#39;bathroom&#39; (ie, flush toidy and running <br/>
water!)  The water&#39;s fecal coliform contaminated because of deer and <br/>
ranging cattle, so we&#39;re filtering for drinking and eventually making a <br/>
fence to keep the cattle away.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a 21 footer.  I thought 18 feet would be too &#39;close&#39; when the inlaws <br/>
come to visit.  (grin)  We&#39;ll live in it off-and-on over the next few years <br/>
until we (hopefully) move up there full-time.<br/>

Well, I&#39;d highly recommend it, myself.  Even with all the difficulty we<br/>
faced in living there.  In fact, the actual living in the yurt bit was<br/>
fairly problem-free.  I think we&#39;d still be there now if things had worked<br/>
out differently with the people who owned the land.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I also like our current lifestyle of living in a small town much<br/>
of the year and travelling off to one city or another for a portion of the<br/>
year.  It gives our son a chance to see the world, different lifestyles<br/>
and people and still get home where we can all spend time together.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would have been particularly difficult for us to live that<br/>
isolated (15 miles from the nearest town) for long, though.  We didn&#39;t<br/>
realize just how much we thrive on other peoples&#39; company until we moved<br/>
into town after living in the woods for 2 years (27 days of which were<br/>
spent snowed in out there - we *still* have flashbacks ;^) )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140477856">Hi Todd,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d actually already seen your website!  Did you build your yurt yourself?<br/>
<br/>
So, did you ever have any problems with mice (deer mice/field mice/ etc) or <br/>
did your multiple cats take care of that?  (I&#39;m allergic to cats, so we <br/>
won&#39;t probably be able to use them for micing while we&#39;re there only <br/>
part-time unfortunately.   ...maybe when we get full-time up there.)  I&#39;m <br/>
getting *really* tired of cleaning up after the mice in the shack/cabin, <br/>
but with hantavirus and all, it&#39;s gotta be done.  Buy stock in Lysol.  I&#39;m <br/>
hoping the yurt will be easier to keep mice out of?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;d highly recommend it, myself.  Even with all the difficulty we<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good to hear!  We own the land, so I figure we won&#39;t have too many problems <br/>
with the owners. (grin)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;m coming at it from the other direction, though.  Years of living <br/>
on the SF Peninsula where you can always hear at least one freeway droning <br/>
on-day or night-no matter where you are, people everywhere you look, a <br/>
licensed-for-12 daycare right next door (Justin!  You stop that or I&#39;m <br/>
gonna smack you!) and a neighbor across the street who &#39;deals&#39; (and not in <br/>
grass, either.)  ...Believe it or not, we live in a *desirable* part of <br/>
town.  sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I figure I get out there, get the yurt up, build some cabins and when we&#39;re <br/>
ready, invite folks to come up and visit for vacation (or rent them out to <br/>
campers, or do an every-now-and-then Bed and <br/>
Breakfast-in-the-middle-of-nowhere, or women&#39;s solitude retreats... <br/>
whatever) and that might be enough social interaction to hold me.  Maybe <br/>
not, but how can a body tell?  There are even some decent neighbors (and <br/>
some real nuts) so maybe I&#39;ll make some friends of the locals...  I&#39;ve <br/>
already met one guy who grew up friends with Jerry Garcia.  He was nice <br/>
enough.  And Alice and her husband have already pulled one of our trucks <br/>
out of the muck, so they were lovely!...<br/>
<br/>
Is there a reason you didn&#39;t go with Satellite for your internet and phone <br/>
connection?<br/>

Bay Area, my older son was almost 2.  Now he&#39;s almost 25.<br/>

&gt; So.... You&#39;re saying that you&#39;re due for a visit, eh? (grin)<br/>
&gt; Yeah, yeah.  I&#39;m not holding anybody to anything at anytime.<br/>
&gt; No worries!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll bet the bay area&#39;s changed some in 23 years!  We&#39;ve only been here,<br/>
&gt; maybe 13 years and the changes are something shocking sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, my mom was down in Berkeley for a visit, must be 15 years ago now.<br/>
She said most of the big old houses like we lived in had been converted to<br/>
apartments with little houses in the back yards.  She said the traffic was<br/>
really awful.  I think it&#39;s funny the way people in Victoria whine about<br/>
rush hour traffic.  I&#39;ve still not experienced as bad a rush hour as the<br/>
ones I drove in during the late 60s in the Bay Area.  I almost burned out a<br/>
clutch once between one freeway exit and the next.<br/>

 I&#39;ll bet your cabin was awesome... I&#39;ve heard Prince William Sound is <br/>
 beautiful, but I&#39;ve never been, yet, that is.  ...didn&#39;t it get cold <br/>
 running to the outhouse? (or was it a summer thing?) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, summers only. The Island is only accessible by boat, very, very <br/>
isolated. So the boat goes into the water in Valdez around Memorial day and <br/>
comes out around Labor day. That&#39;s about all the &quot;summer&quot; they get anyway (if <br/>
you can call it that) lol.<br/>
It&#39;s a very rainy region of AK, so the forest is like the Olympic Peninsula <br/>
in a lot of ways...very deep moss and tall trees. It&#39;s gorgeous.<br/>
And there are mountains and rocky islands all around you, reflecting into the <br/>
ocean....absolutely breathtaking.<br/>
We boat up to the glacier, see Whales, Sea Lions, Bald Eagles and such. It&#39;s <br/>
an outdoors persons paradise.<br/>
We usually fish for Salmon and Halibut mainly....I caught an 80 lb. Halibut <br/>
once, my all time best. :)<br/>
The cabin is owned by my Grandfather (as is the boat) and there have now been <br/>
five generations of family visiting the Island. <br/>
The Island used to be Federal Land, but is now owned by an Indian tribe that <br/>
has a village across the bay from our cabin. My Grandfather has to lease it <br/>
from the chief, which has been a very interesting test of dipomacy.<br/>
The future of our little piece of paradise is unsure....so I value every <br/>
chance I get to be there.<br/>

 We&#39;re currently in the Bay Area, but the land is about 40 minutes northeast <br/>
 of Laytonville, which is 3 hours north of San Francisco, more or less. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can see making it up there sometime. We LOVE California and I have family <br/>
up in Portland, OR area....so I&#39;d really love to do a West Coast trip in the <br/>
next couple of years.<br/>

<br/>
Well, if you have a trip to Alaska planned anytime you should let me know. I <br/>
have family in both Wasilla and Fairbanks that would probably be more than <br/>
happy to have overnight guests. And I could see if there was a trip planned <br/>
to Valdez while you were there....that part is a bit more tricky since the <br/>
boat can only handle so many people and family is usually filling it up! But <br/>
sometimes Dad or Grandpa have a small trip planned and can take extras. It&#39;s <br/>
the BOMB!!<br/>
I&#39;ll share pictures if we meet up....are you going to the conference?<br/>
