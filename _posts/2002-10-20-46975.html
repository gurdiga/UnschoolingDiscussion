&lt;&lt; If a child has 20 new computer games to play, they&#39;re not going to <br/>
willingly leave the computer, no matter how tired they get of it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they have a hundred games, they will still leave the computer willingly.<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a child say &quot;I&#39;m really tired of this fun thing, but I&#39;m <br/>
going to force myself to keep playing it anyway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Computer game time is not limited, but we only keep maybe two games at any <br/>
one time, so when they get tired of those they leave the computer by their <br/>
own choice. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you only keep two books in the house too?  Two movies?  Because we&#39;ve <br/>
always had lots of all of those, and the kids don&#39;t spend their whole lives <br/>
at any one thing, or any two things.  <br/>

  **I have. Many times. I&#39;ve even done it myself. <br/>

  ** Nope, lots of books and they&#39;re never without one. Movies.... well, we have an extensive Disney collection that was gifts from grandma&#39;s before our oldest turned one, but otherwise we just check out one at a time from the library. Usually that one doesn&#39;t even get watched. To me though, books and movies don&#39;t compare with the computer one bit. My kids will run, jump, get up and move somewhere else (outside, kitchen table), etc while reading, and will usually be playing with toys or reading or eating while watching movies or TV. The computer though, one has to sit still and usually keep hands on the mouse or keyboard, has to sit in a chair and cannot really do anything else at the same time. Big difference.<br/>

  ** Well, I couldn&#39;t swear as to how much actually gets read &lt;g&gt;, but my oldest does seem to finish at least two small chapter books a day doing all that. Tells me all about them, too, so I know he&#39;s read at least enough to get the story line and ending. <br/>

arms have to be glued to your body, so the book moves the same as your eyes.<br/>
(The only way I can stand to exercise!)<br/>

Aunt Renee&#39; sent, you can bet my kids aren&#39;t totally glued to their seats, <br/>
never moving. Jack sits on his knees and bounces, the more he bounces, the <br/>
better the game. Bouncing also helps him in his frequent takeoffs. He bounces <br/>
up, runs to me to tell me all about the newest cool level with the gorgozon <br/>
flimflack eater that he just defeated and and and.... Moly sits with one foot <br/>
on the floor and one under her, I think this is to propel herself up to get a <br/>
running start on her brother to tell me that it was really SHE that defeated <br/>
the gorgozon cause she discovered the special amulet.... Then they are off to <br/>
use another color printer cartridge on a picture they just have to have to <br/>
show Dad, *why oh why can&#39;t they just put it in their favorite places?* and <br/>
Grandpa and Aunt Renee&#39; haven&#39;t gotten emails yet (this hour) so its back to <br/>
the keyboard with cookies and oops we forgot to ride our bikes around the <br/>
block three hundred times at breakneck speed. All the while, somewhere in the <br/>
back ground the loons are calling on Sim Park and a ranger is telling some <br/>
errant ranger that *You&#39;d better take care of your animals ranger...* I think <br/>
I will go check that one out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  when they need a bathroom (I fear the answer, break it to me gently).<br/>
<br/>
  ** My friends kids, because they told me so. My three nieces, because they lived with us for a pretty long while. I had three computers, and they were on them from the time they woke up til the time they went to bed. That didn&#39;t really bother me because it kept them from their other favorite passtimes - smoking, shoplifting, and ruining my pots and pans. Bathroom breaks are usually done as fast as possible (pants going down on the way to, and pulling up on the way back). My youngest son will actually go in his pants if I don&#39;t tell him to go when he starts squirming around. Meals? They&#39;d skip if I let them. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe it has something to do with only having two games and/or limits on<br/>
  computer time.<br/>
<br/>
  ** No, that 2 game limit came about as a way to deal with all the time spent at the computer, and it&#39;s worked nicely. Not even an objection from the boys - they just happily went and found other things to do. <br/>

their <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ll never know if they will regulate themselves (they will) until they<br/>
TRULY have the freedom to choose.  If you are withholding choices then<br/>
they are not free to choose, you are still controlling the activity. <br/>
Kids know when they are being controlled and besides the damge it does to<br/>
their relationship with you, it usually translates to an obsession with<br/>
the activity.  I would probably become obsessed with something that was<br/>
being controlled for me, look at how much people were willing to go<br/>
through to get alcohol during prohibition.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond all this, how can a parent know what will feed a lifelong passion<br/>
for their child?  If I limit my child&#39;s choices in computer games I may<br/>
leave out something that will be there at the right time for them.  My<br/>
daughter, Lanora - 12, is passionate about rock climbing and the thing<br/>
that sparked that passion was climbing up the walls in the hallway.  If I<br/>
had said, &quot;You may not climb up the walls, they get dirty.&quot;  she would<br/>
probably have missed the spark for an interest that still burns now.<br/>
