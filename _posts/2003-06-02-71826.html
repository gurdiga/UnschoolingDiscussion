<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552546881">My mother is still hovering, mostly not in her body but sometimes there.  My<br/>
sister had the idea when she went for a visit of singing some of the songs<br/>
we all used to sing as a family, and it seemed to go over well.  I&#39;d like to<br/>
do the same, but for most songs I only remember the first few lines.  And<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that looking over titles or first lines will remind me of other<br/>
songs I&#39;ve forgotten.  Anybody have favourite sites for finding folksong<br/>
lyrics?  Sandra?  Anybody else?  I&#39;m not looking so much for the traditional<br/>
folk songs that people collect, but more like girl scout or other camp<br/>
songs.<br/>

Mudcat Cafe is one a lot of friends of mine use.<br/>
<br/>
But you could also search Google with a line you know and the word &quot;lyrics&quot; <br/>
(which is what I usually do when I want to quote or find a song).<br/>

not find lyrics for using google.  I do a lot of lyric searches, too.<br/>
