<br/>
I felt compelled to respond immediately to your question about what adults <br/>
don&#39;t refuse to do.  I don&#39;t know how correct this is in the world of <br/>
unschooling, (yet) but if my child &quot;refused&quot; to get dressed then they would go in <br/>
whatever they were wearing.  And it would depend on how important it was where I was <br/>
going.  I look at it this way-I&#39;ve gone to the emergency in my pajamas <br/>
because it was necessary.  Mind you, I didn&#39;t say my teddy, I said my pajamas.  And <br/>
I did once run out of my house naked because it was on fire in the room my <br/>
clothes were in, but that is another story.  Consequently, my husband did not put <br/>
me over his knee and spank me.  I also have seen adults throw tantrums in <br/>
public-just go to the customer service counter once in awhile.  And if my <br/>
children are hiding under clothes racks in Walmart and running out in cars, my focus <br/>
obviously is not with my children and they should not be with me if I am not <br/>
prepared to watch them in public and protect from harm in the first place.  <br/>
That is just my take on it; I&#39;m interested to hear how others respond.<br/>

Thank you for your response.  I was the original poster &lt;g&gt;, but name <br/>
confusion aside, I found your points worth pondering.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

you a beer and you can tell me the whole thing. &lt;g&gt;  If I understand your <br/>
point, you&#39;re saying that when kids do these things, they have their own reasons, <br/>
and those reasons should be respected as much as our own?  I&#39;m not disagreeing <br/>
-- just want to make sure I understand.<br/>
<br/>
