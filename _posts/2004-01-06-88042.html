But I don&#39;t think your *someday* scenario is so far off, Sandra.  We already <br/>
have a significant number of teenagers who can be seen to be successful in <br/>
their various pursuits...writing, arts, historical reenactments, computers, <br/>
etc., <br/>
etc., etc.  We can show just how socially adept our kids are compared to ps <br/>
kids (and even school-at-homers).  There are a lot of ways that what we do <br/>
can <br/>
be evaluated from a sociological and psychological standpoint.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wish someone would do the legwork.<br/>
********************<br/>
I would love to hear from anyone who has teenagers who are unschooling who <br/>
are doing cool things. They need not to be terrified of speaking in public, and <br/>
need to be planning to attend the Unschooling Conference in August <br/>
(www.LiveandLearnConference.org) .  I have PLANS...<br/>

Seems to me one of the etiquette ladies, maybe Miss<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Manners, said there&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; need to write a thank you note if you&#39;ve said thank<br/>
&gt; you in person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Might be worth finding her book and copying the<br/>
&gt; page! ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joyce<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s true, and if I can do it without upsetting her, I<br/>
might.  <br/>
<br/>
She really is a wonderful person and usually so<br/>
supportive that she just caught me on a day when I had<br/>
very little sleep all week and was quite worried about<br/>
the 5yo being sick (we thought he had an appendicitis<br/>
but turned out to have an impacted bowel) but holding<br/>
all my worries in so as not to worry the children (or<br/>
her and my dad).  I guess I was as emotionally<br/>
constipated as my son was physically! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise I would have just blown it off as being her<br/>
old-fashioned southern upbringing (she is 69 after<br/>
all) would have made a joke about it and told her we<br/>
would get around to it eventually.<br/>
<br/>
But I think my 5yos take on the whole thing was way<br/>
funnier.  ;-)<br/>
***************************<br/>
Maybe she really wants something tangible from the kids that she can hold and <br/>
keep? Ask her. Maybe rather than worrying about notes, etc. they can make her <br/>
something periodically.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Although, we are fairly new unschoolers, my 14 year old daughter, Brenna, has <br/>
been doing very &quot;cool&quot; things since we came home from last years Unschooling <br/>
Conference.  She went with us loaded down with her academic books from a <br/>
homeschooling co-op which included<br/>
Anatomy and Phisiology, Geometry, and World History.  She truly came home a <br/>
changed child.  She quit the co-op and those textbooks are gathering dust . She <br/>
read Grace Llewlyns &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;,  made a quilt with <br/>
quilting pieces from the conference raffle, started sculpting,  became very involved <br/>
in photography, planted strawberry corn, which is in pots all over our house, <br/>
in preparation for a small green house she is designing,  went back to writing <br/>
poetry(which is all over her bedroom floor), decided to direct a play this <br/>
spring and has found the play and a facility as well as a group of homeschoolers <br/>
to act in it, became interested in vegetarian cooking and made a wonderful <br/>
dinner for us all last night.  She and I took a wheel building class and learned <br/>
to throw pots that we gave friends and family for Christmas gifts.  I <br/>
continue to just be in awe of her enthusiasm, energy and the joy she brings to her <br/>
days.  She has always been very self-directed and has homeschooled since she was <br/>
8 but her energies went into &quot;school-like&quot; pursuits.  There was very little <br/>
of the joyfulness evident that I now see in her every day.<br/>
<br/>
This morning , she has discovered boxes of pictures that I never got into <br/>
albums and is working on a scrapbook  of her life so far.  She is also involved <br/>
in community theatre and enjoys public speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Brenna asked if you could e-mail her as she would love to be involved in any <br/>
way at the Live and Learn Conference this year.  We will definitely be there.  <br/>
After the changes in our lives from last year, I wouldn&#39;t miss it for <br/>
anything.<br/>

conservative and religious homeschool community)<br/>
