<div id="ygrps-yiv-937625002">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have found a couple sites that have examples of portfolios. <br/>
Here is the stuff I dont understand....<br/>
When I am sitting there with all these other parents in a circle and have say <br/>
15 minutes how do I fill that? Do I get asked questions or am I to fill this <br/>
whole time with talk about my son? Just the thought of me sitting there and <br/>
all these people staring at me while I explain what we do is making me <br/>
nervous.<br/>
What should I bring? Measuring cups, computer, surf board, trampoline, Fox <br/>
news yearly coverage, VCR tapes. Kidding but really she wants to see <br/>
progress, what is considered progress. He didn&#39;t know A in September and now <br/>
he does? How many examples per subject? Is it really as bad as I am making it <br/>
out to be?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897466978">Laura, <br/>
Are you going to the CMSL portfolio review?  If you are, I have heard<br/>
they are really laid back.  They don&#39;t want to see progress, just what<br/>
you&#39;ve been up to this year.  (you can bring lists of books you&#39;ve read,<br/>
a photo album, or nothing and just talk.) Suzanne will put you with<br/>
other unschoolers if you ask her, I am sure.<br/>

What is CMSL? I know I have seen them I just cant recall? If it is the one <br/>
that had the web site, their site said local/20 mile so I didn&#39;t sign up.<br/>
Our group has one scheduled I just dont want to not have enough information. <br/>
I have been to three or four of there meetings but I dont really have a sense <br/>
of what they are all about.<br/>
They say some are relaxed and some are not.<br/>

Who wishes us New Englanders could create our own Unschooling group!<br/>
