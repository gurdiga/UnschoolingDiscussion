<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978164847">Kat, who is 12, wants to read &quot;better&quot; but I&#39;m having a hard time getting<br/>
out of her what she feels is wrong. She gets frustrated when she says &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t know&quot; about something and I try to draw out more information.<br/>
<br/>
She does have brand new reading glasses now but she isn&#39;t reading more now<br/>
than before.<br/>
<br/>
She seems to be able to process. She reads Captain Underpants and emails<br/>
from her friends, which have a high white space to word ratio. She reads New<br/>
Moon magazine cover to cover, which is relatively dense type, and has<br/>
discussed articles so it sounds like she&#39;s processing well what she&#39;s<br/>
reading. She reads gaming magazines. She goes through one in maybe half an<br/>
hour, just picking and choosing the stuff that interests her. But<br/>
occasionally I&#39;ve noticed what she&#39;s gotten from something isn&#39;t precisely<br/>
what it said. <br/>
<br/>
She apparently read every word in a gaming guide that she had while waiting<br/>
for a game to arrive in the mail, but usually she looks for specific<br/>
information. So she&#39;ll skim to find a word, but if there is contradictory or<br/>
preliminary information before the part she reads, she&#39;ll miss it because<br/>
it&#39;s more effort than it&#39;s worth to read for information that might not be<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
She read Harry Potter #1 out loud two (or three?) years ago and she read<br/>
well, with proper inflection so she was understanding what she read. She<br/>
stumbled over words here and there but they were irregular words she&#39;d never<br/>
seen written, and no pattern that suggested she was having problems<br/>
processing or decoding. She said it was hard for her, but the difficulty<br/>
wasn&#39;t apparent in her reading. Reading out loud *is* harder than reading<br/>
silently but this &quot;hard&quot; seems to apply to reading in general.<br/>
<br/>
She seems to be able to read teeny tiny print better than my old eyes can,<br/>
but perhaps not as well as I used to be able to. When she writes page length<br/>
stuff, her writing is larger than adult-level book type but it seems in<br/>
proportion to some writing I have when I was her age. And when she writes<br/>
the conversation balloons in her comics her printing is pretty small.<br/>
<br/>
She has started two adult-level novels that she really wants to read but<br/>
hasn&#39;t been able to get very far in. She says she &quot;doesn&#39;t like to read&quot;,<br/>
but since that doesn&#39;t seem to be true, she seems to be using that phrase to<br/>
mean something else, like it isn&#39;t as effortless for her as she&#39;d like it to<br/>
be. She seems basically to be stuck on the Captain Underpants level of print<br/>
for reading for fun for 2 years and hasn&#39;t moved beyond it and she&#39;s<br/>
frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I thought if I wrote it all out, I might see some clues that point in a<br/>
variety of directions but it&#39;s really sounding like vision. But not an<br/>
ordinary vision problem like blurry. She doesn&#39;t hold print up close. But I<br/>
remember years ago someone said her son had an eye tracking problem that<br/>
neither opthamalogists nor optometrists (Kat&#39;s seen both in the past 2<br/>
years) were trained to identify and he needed a specialist to figure this<br/>
out. Maybe there are other vision problems that don&#39;t get tested under<br/>
routine examinations. What should I be asking for? And how do I screen an<br/>
opthamologist to make sure they can test for the right things?<br/>
<br/>
And people have mentioned some people like colored films over their pages to<br/>
change the contrast. I *think* if that were the case with Kat, with all the<br/>
playing around she does with fonts and backgrounds, she would have hit on<br/>
something that she was drawn to. But, unless she&#39;s having fun, she sticks<br/>
with relatively small black type on white. But does anyone has information<br/>
about that? I could keep it as a second avenue of investigation.<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Joyce --<br/>
<br/>
On the old AOL forums, Lillian/Wrensong posted about vision therapy and <br/>
a parents group that promoted it, PAVE.  (Parents Active?... Vision... E?)<br/>
<br/>
I think reading lots of comic book type books COULD correlate to a <br/>
tracking problem as the text in thought balloons doesn&#39;t stretch as <br/>
widely across the page as chapter book text.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I chose to read my email and the unschooling.com message <br/>
boards in a narrow window, so that the text is more like a column of <br/>
text in a newspaper.  I find this more comfortable for my eyes.  The <br/>
full width of the computer screen is definitely too wide for me to scan. <br/>
  You could experiment with this.  Also, I think a bookmark run <br/>
horizontally under text might help someone with a scanning problem.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter&#39;s reading development sounds a lot like my son&#39;s.  Two and <br/>
a half years ago my dh was studying for his education credential, and as <br/>
a part of his homework he gave my son a &quot;reading test&quot;.  James read two <br/>
pages aloud out of Redwall.  He read smoothly and with expression and <br/>
only stumbled on &quot;dormitory&quot; and one other word.  For a kid who wasn&#39;t <br/>
reading nearly anything on his own, it was amazing the three and four <br/>
syllable words he could pronounce.  (He had a strong spoken vocabulary.)<br/>
<br/>
Two years followed this in which it seemed he read only Garfield books. <br/>
  OK, he read a lot of Garfield the first year.  The second year he also <br/>
read Calvin and Hobbes and Asterix and Tintin, but he still read a lot <br/>
of Garfield and didn&#39;t read &quot;chapter books&quot;.  (Unless you want to <br/>
stretch the definition and count Capt. Underpants as a chapter book.) <br/>
This was just a bit confounding to me, as I thought I had evidence that <br/>
he COULD read chapter books, he just didn&#39;t ever read them.  But the <br/>
amount of time he spent reading comic books steadily increased, and he <br/>
would fall on the daily newspaper and read the comic pages with glee.<br/>
<br/>
He told me a couple of times that his head hurt when he tried to read <br/>
books without pictures, so we did take him in for a conventional eye <br/>
test.  The eye doctor, without being a developmental eye specialist, <br/>
thought James eyes were tracking fine.<br/>
<br/>
James now sometimes reads a chapter of Harry Potter if I am busy.  This <br/>
only started within the last two months.  He has said that he likes <br/>
listening to me read and that it is easier for him to form mental <br/>
pictures if he is listening.  I have always thought his learning style <br/>
was very auditory, so I guess this makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing going on with James is that he has a strong preference <br/>
for books that are funny.  (Which isn&#39;t at all surprising, as our family <br/>
motto is &quot;Only when it&#39;s funny.&quot; from the handcuff escape scene in Who <br/>
Framed Roger Rabbit.)  I think funny books have a bigger &quot;payoff&quot; and <br/>
they really reward the effort of reading.<br/>
<br/>
I always thought Easy Readers were kind of lame, but maybe I should have <br/>
had more of that stuff around as James was easing in to reading.  I just <br/>
expected him, based on the &quot;test&quot; my dh had done, to be able to read <br/>
more complex stuff.<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re talking about a developmental/behavioural optometrist.  They do the regular eye testing that an optometrist does (clarity of vision), but they also test the rest of the vision system (clarity being just one component).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a page that explains what they look at in some detail: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vision-therapy.com/About_Vision.htm">http://www.vision-therapy.com/About_Vision.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a parent&#39;s support page: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pavevision.org">http://www.pavevision.org</a><br/>
<br/>
And in my quick search (I lost my favourites from when I originally researched this), I even found a homeschooling vision page with a story that sounds similar to the one you mentioned: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.besthomeschooling.org/vision_skills.html">http://www.besthomeschooling.org/vision_skills.html</a>  (Sandra, did you know you&#39;re linked from this site?)<br/>
<br/>
One thing to remember is that they will be comparing vision skills to the &quot;average&quot; kid at school, and it just may be a skill that a particular kid will develop later.  But if the child seems frustrated it could help out.  It&#39;s not label-oriented, but will give you an idea of how well your child&#39;s vision system is performing.<br/>
<br/>
The practitioner I dealt with and the ones I&#39;ve read about are very holistic in their approach (my impression was that they are to optometrists what chiropractors are to doctors).  I sat with them during the appointment and he patiently explained what he was testing and the results.  My kids thought the appointment was fun, and the therapy he suggested for improving my daughter&#39;s perceptual skills was some geoboard puzzle exercises we did at home, for as long as she was interested.  As an aside, sometimes the results are surprising.  My eldest was a very good reader with great comprehension though the examination revealed that he had very little peripheral vision (clear focus area only the size of a quarter).  He had never mentioned to me the headaches he was getting when he was reading ... he just really wanted that gaming info!  He did some vision therapy in the office for a few weeks, retesting after showed a marked improvement (I sat with him during that as well) and he got glasses which he can use if he chooses.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d offer up what I have learned about the subject.<br/>

No!  I&#39;ll go peek at my name (how vain, huh? &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
It&#39;s fun when little things can be a big thrill.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been a diamonds and pearls type of person.  I didn&#39;t care if my <br/>
boyfriends had cars when I was a teen, but I DID love to see my name in the <br/>
school paper.  (Even if I had to write something to get it in there! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My eldest was a very good reader with great comprehension though the <br/>

getting when he was reading ...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he didn&#39;t know others didn&#39;t have the same aftereffects of reading.<br/>
<br/>
I used to get headaches from reading when I was 11, and I got glasses which I <br/>
hated and they didn&#39;t help.  I quit wearing them, time passed, the headaches <br/>
stopped.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember lots of parts and systems hurting various ways when I was 10 to <br/>
13, and I think it was just different body parts growing at different speeds, <br/>
and the discomfort of  always feeling new and wrong and awkward.  &quot;Growing <br/>
pains&quot; were literal with me.  My arm and legs would ache.  And skulls and eyes grow <br/>
too.<br/>

<br/>
I might get my  name on the cover of Connie Colten&#39;s new book.  That was <br/>
interesting:  Read a book (manuscript) and write a report but a very TINY report, <br/>
and it needs to be profound, because it&#39;s for a kind of tiny-profound-report <br/>
competition.   I&#39;d hardly ever thought much about cover blurbs and testimonials <br/>

here know that I pushed him with phonics when he was 12, and he *did* learn <br/>

just wasn&#39;t much written material that was worth all that work and time to <br/>
read. He read magazines and websites, picking and choosing like Kat does. <br/>
Then this year (just turned 16) he took off. He read a Harry Potter book, <br/>
only the second book of any kind he had read. (The first one was read <br/>
during an unfortunately very boring visit with my mother while we were <br/>
trying to get her into a nursing home the year before.) Then he started <br/>
asking for books on various subjects - current events, weather patterns, <br/>
forests, light. He&#39;s been reading these books and websites that I found <br/>
him. I *think* he can probably now read whatever he wants to at a <br/>
reasonable speed, though reading is still not his first choice for <br/>
entertainment. The main difference I can see with Kat&#39;s situation is that <br/>
he never voiced a desire during those years to improve his reading. Anyway, <br/>

(Irlen&#39;s Syndrome) and sent us home with the correct colour of plastic <br/>

of glasses (almost always different than the overlay colour)  but we never <br/>
did that. He used the overlay some but said it only helped a little. I <br/>
think for him it was a matter of maturity rather than vision, and then I <br/>
probably pushed the real reading back for a few years by pushing him when I <br/>
did.<br/>

I would almost rather die than read John Grisham, although his writing<br/>

There are certain styles I can&#39;t read and I wish I could but my mind<br/>

Dylan used to cut a small rectangle out of the middle of a piece of paper<br/>
and lay the paper on the page he was reading and put one word in the<br/>
&quot;window&quot; at a time.  He did that for a year or so and it seemed to help<br/>
him.   I think he liked the white space.  I think he wanted to look at<br/>
every word at once instead of one at a time.   He can look at blue prints<br/>
that way sort of scan/absorb and he can figure out patterns and mazes and<br/>
building materials by looking at the whole thing at once and I think he<br/>
would like to be able to swallow up whole pages of text and then have the<br/>
words sort out automatically in his mind they way he can sort patterns.  <br/>

about it. You could sign onto the HSC email list and search the <br/>

and then she talks about reading more sophisticated books, and wants <br/>
to, but just doesn&#39;t seem to have it in her to get through them and <br/>
gets kind of down on herself and frustrated. Then - a while later - <br/>
months, usually, she WILL read them and seem to be totally fine. I <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And in my quick search (I lost my favourites from when I originally researched<br/>
&gt; this), I even found a homeschooling vision page with a story that sounds<br/>
&gt; similar to the one you mentioned:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.besthomeschooling.org/vision_skills.html">http://www.besthomeschooling.org/vision_skills.html</a>  (Sandra, did you know<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re linked from this site?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it was Lillian! (I was thinking Retromom/Christine Web, who, ironically,<br/>
also is on the main page of that site. And Pam Hartley&#39;s there too. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. Now at least I&#39;ll know what I&#39;m asking for. Holistic did pop up<br/>
in the reading so it sounds like it&#39;s part of being a<br/>
developmental/behavioral optometrist.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The other thing going on with James is that he has a strong preference<br/>
&gt; for books that are funny.  (Which isn&#39;t at all surprising, as our family<br/>
&gt; motto is &quot;Only when it&#39;s funny.&quot; from the handcuff escape scene in Who<br/>
&gt; Framed Roger Rabbit.)  I think funny books have a bigger &quot;payoff&quot; and<br/>
&gt; they really reward the effort of reading.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, more alike than you know. They seem to be separated siblings! Funny is<br/>
number one on her list of what makes anything appealing! I&#39;d forgotten the<br/>
Garfields. She&#39;s read every single one. (The other comics you mentioned I<br/>
read to her.) Part of the appeal of funny may be the feedback you get on<br/>
whether you read it right. But she (and the whole family actually) like<br/>
funny movies and TV shows so I think it&#39;s genetic :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I always thought Easy Readers were kind of lame, but maybe I should have<br/>
&gt; had more of that stuff around as James was easing in to reading.  I just<br/>
&gt; expected him, based on the &quot;test&quot; my dh had done, to be able to read<br/>
&gt; more complex stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had easy readers too. One of the problems has been is that if I pick out<br/>
a book she feels it&#39;s something for me to read to her and she finds browsing<br/>
at stores and libraries overwhelming so doesn&#39;t pick out stuff for herself.<br/>
Occasionally she has stumbled across a book she wanted so it felt like hers<br/>
to read but she never finished them.<br/>
<br/>
I let her know about the bookmark under the line. She says she&#39;s tried that<br/>
and it makes it go slower but she&#39;s going to try it again.<br/>
<br/>
Tia:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here&#39;s the Irlen Institute&#39;s website. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.irlen.com/">http://www.irlen.com/</a><br/>
&gt; She also wrote a book called Reading by the colors: Overcoming Dyslexia and<br/>
&gt; Other Reading Disabilities Through the Irlen Method (New York: Avery Pub<br/>
&gt; Group, 1991).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks! I&#39;d be really surprised if that turns out to be the problem but good<br/>
to have handy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Could it be that some things just aren&#39;t interesting enough to read and<br/>
&gt; she wishes they were?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I read a lot, but there are only certain things I can read.<br/>
&gt; I would almost rather die than read John Grisham, although his writing<br/>
&gt; style is changing a little and is better for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are certain styles I can&#39;t read and I wish I could but my mind<br/>
&gt; wanders away and I get annoyed and I end up skimming and missing much of<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s there.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s definitely true of me! I think I need it to sound like someone&#39;s<br/>
talking to me. Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;ve always been drawn to comics. (Though I<br/>
don&#39;t have problems reading dense text.) Of course comics are kind of like<br/>
movies, with that same connection between pictures and conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But - something that happens with Rosie is that she reads at a certain<br/>
&gt; &quot;level&quot; (Animorphs was one period and SaddleClub for another long time)<br/>
&gt; and then she talks about reading more sophisticated books, and wants<br/>
&gt; to, but just doesn&#39;t seem to have it in her to get through them and<br/>
&gt; gets kind of down on herself and frustrated. Then - a while later -<br/>
&gt; months, usually, she WILL read them and seem to be totally fine. I<br/>
&gt; think There is some asyncnroncity - different parts of her brain are<br/>
&gt; ready to move on at different times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s pretty much what I&#39;ve been going on that it would just take time, but<br/>
it&#39;s been at least two years since she read her first Captain Underpants so<br/>
it&#39;s seeming less likely now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, using the bookmark *above* the line is supposed to be a better <br/>
idea. I think it helps them move on to the eyes jumping ahead and back, <br/>
which is what good readers do.<br/>

I&#39;m a dabbler with a short attention span, so I like magazines.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had Muse magazine for awhile.  Of course, the only thing James <br/>
read for a long time was the Kokopelli comic strip in the front.  But <br/>
this week I saw him reading an article from it while eating cereal.<br/>
<br/>
Graphic novels are appealing, I just don&#39;t always know which ones are <br/>
kid-friendly and which ones are hideously violent and morbid. <br/>
(Adjectives I would use to describe some of the Batman comics that were <br/>
popular several years back.)<br/>
<br/>
We have some Star Wars and Star Trek graphic novels, and I&#39;ve been <br/>
thinking I should look for more in that vein.<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, I am a noodge.  Is there a chapter of Noodgeaholics Anonymous near <br/>
me?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167244765"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;The main difference I can see with Kat&#39;s situation is that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>he never voiced a desire during those years to improve his reading. <br/>
Anyway,  for what it&#39;s worth.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got one of each. Conor was slower to start reading. He was <br/>
labeled with all sorts of disabilities by the school system, and then <br/>
surprised me by reading Harry Potter at age 10, six months after I <br/>
pulled him out. He went through vision therapy while still in school, <br/>
but I never saw any great difference from having done it. He goes <br/>
through bursts of reading novels, but mostly prefers magazines, <br/>
comics, books on tape, Anime/manga, and non-fiction with lots of <br/>
pictures. He&#39;s content with where he is as far as his reading goes. I <br/>
do get the impression that too much print on a page still bothers him.<br/>
<br/>
Casey did lots of reading stuff early. I suppose if she had been in <br/>
school she would have gotten A&#39;s on her reading tests. BUT she is <br/>
like Kat and complains about reading anything with too much type. She <br/>
also prefers comics and Anime/manga like &quot;Spirited Away.&quot; Unlike <br/>
Conor, she is not always satisfied with her reading. I do wonder if, <br/>
like Sandra mentioned, her eye strain or whatever is keeping her from <br/>
print will just go away as she matures. FWIW she was evaluated for <br/>
vision therapy when Conor was and tested fine.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
