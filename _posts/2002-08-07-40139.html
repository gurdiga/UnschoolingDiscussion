You know what I have found out........People buy the would and have it <br/>
cut....They leave good size pieces behind..... For which I personally think <br/>
that it is nuts, because you are paying full price for that item, I mean <br/>
hey.......ya never know when you will need a piece for something.<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing.....Home Depot sells the piece that they leave anywhere from <br/>
$.91-$2.91.<br/>
There 2 sides I guess....... you can get some good deals, but Home Depot is <br/>
double profiting....<br/>
I guess that I have issues when companies double dip......<br/>
Oh by the way...have anybody gown to home depot over the past month for their <br/>
clearance sales? Things where 40-70 percent off.<br/>
I got light fixtures that where $30 bucks for $11, my son a lamp for his room <br/>
that was $29 original price for $9.96 and these are Hampton Bay lamps and <br/>
fixtures and a gallon of polyurethine for $8. It&#39;s just a WHOLE bunch of <br/>
stuff.....bathroom stuff, cabinets, tools, etc..........you name it.<br/>
Now if I had the money..........they had a sauna on sale for $1400 and <br/>
something. The reg. price was $2400.00 and something.<br/>
A lady told me that they have these sales twice a year in January and July.<br/>

Both sides of most deep disagreements will never get along, for the reason <br/>
that &quot;all&quot; are rarely ever accepted in any group, especially groups focusing <br/>
on eternity (I mean, would I want to spend an eternity with ME? (God must <br/>
certainly have a sense of humor, and a strong stomach.) <br/>
<br/>
We ought to favor as much freedom to be wrong as possible (I beg for this <br/>
freedom more than most), at least until things get ugly. In the meantime, and <br/>
just as someone here said this morning, we brighten the corner where we are.<br/>

I agree with so much of what you said....... I think so much about my  <br/>
ancestors and what they went through being forced to someones way of life and <br/>
thinking, often brutally done.<br/>
You have caused me to think again and have a  better about my decision to do <br/>
things or make the choices that I have made.I feel better about the road that <br/>
I am traveling.<br/>

a child - &gt;you can only lead them to the water - and let them drink - if they <br/>
so choose. You &gt;can&#39;t make anyone see your way -<br/>
Agree again........I see it all the time where people are forced to accept a <br/>
certain way or belief . It could be the choice of wanting to eat or <br/>
starve....if you want to eat or want this morsel of bread....it&#39;s my way or <br/>
if you don&#39;t starve.<br/>
It does not say to treat people this way......Where are the <br/>
teachings......true teachings......why won&#39;t they release the other <br/>
books/chapters of the bible?<br/>

non-educating insitution. We don&#39;t want the to be forced to be this and do <br/>
that. We don&#39;t want their education, non-values, non-morals forced on our <br/>
children so we have them home.......Isn&#39;t it the same with religion when <br/>
someone tries and force their ideas?<br/>

I have no doubt that both sides can and will debate in peace, if allowed to. <br/>

sameness. An impossibility in my opinion.<br/>
