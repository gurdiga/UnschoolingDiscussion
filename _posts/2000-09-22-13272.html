&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t you wish you could go back to the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Decisions were made by going<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;eeny-meeny-miney-mo.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mistakes were corrected by simply exclaiming, &quot;do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Race issue&quot; meant arguing about who ran the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fastest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Money issues were handled by whoever was the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; banker in &quot;Monopoly.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Catching fireflies happily occupied an entire<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evening.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It wasn&#39;t odd to have two or three &quot;best&quot; friends.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being old, referred to anyone over 20.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The net on a tennis court was the perfect height<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to play volleyball & Rules didn&#39;t matter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was magic when dad would &quot;remove&quot; his thumb.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was unbelievable that dodgeball wasn&#39;t an Olympic event.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Having a weapon in school, meant being caught with a slingshot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody was prettier than Mom.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dad was the strongest man alive - STILL IS!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scrapes and bruises were kissed and made better.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was a big deal to finally be tall enough to ride the &quot;big<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Getting a foot of snow was a dream come true.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Abilities were discovered because of a &quot;double-dog-dare.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No shopping trip was complete, unless a new toy was brought home.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ollie-ollie-oxen-free&quot; made perfect sense.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spinning around, getting dizzy and falling down was cause for<br/>
&gt; giggles.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The worst embarrassment was being picked last for a team.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; War was a card game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Water balloons were the ultimate weapon.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baseball cards in the spokes transformed any bike into a<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ice cream was considered a basic food group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Older siblings were the worst tormentors, but also the fiercest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protectors.<br/>
