During the 2005 Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC), tens of thousands  <br/>
of people had a great time counting birds, provided some fascinating  <br/>
information, and broke a few records. During the four-day count of  <br/>
February 18-21, birders across North America reported more than 6.5  <br/>
million birds, shattering the previous record of 4.8 million set in  <br/>
2002. Participants submitted nearly 52,000 checklists, up 22 percent  <br/>
from last year, and tallied 613 bird species, surpassing the previous  <br/>
record of 567. More than 1,000 photos were considered for the new  <br/>
online photo gallery, which features birds seen from around the  <br/>
continent during the count. At the GBBC web site, you can visit the  <br/>
photo gallery, explore the results, and view the top-10 lists.<br/>
<br/>
Participants recorded birds in all 50 states and all but one Canadian  <br/>
province and territory, capturing the tremendous geographic variation  <br/>
in birds across the continent, from the 10 species reported in the  <br/>
Northwest Territories to the 377 species reported from Texas.<br/>
