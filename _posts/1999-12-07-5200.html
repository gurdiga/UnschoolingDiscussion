&lt;&lt;My youngest dd is interested in Russia and is interested in paper dolls or <br/>
coloring pages with traditional costumes. does anyone know of any sources?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

books and paper dolls on historical and cultural subjects.  I would start <br/>
there.  Their prices are very reasonable.<br/>
