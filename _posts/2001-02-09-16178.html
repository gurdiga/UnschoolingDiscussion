<div id="ygrps-yiv-229696526">This is a topic that I&#39;ve stayed away from but will share my 3 real <br/>
experiences with guns, for what it&#39;s worth...<br/>
<br/>
As a child, my abusive, alcoholic, mentally ill father had a .12 <br/>
gauge shotgun for hunting.  He loved that gun and probably the <br/>
powerful feeling it gave him.  We have Polaroid pictures of the gun <br/>
and ammo and I keep those to this day as a reminder.  When my father <br/>
was &quot;in a mood&quot; and became abusive to my mother, with me as a captive <br/>
audience, he took out his loaded .12 gauge and would hold it up to my <br/>
mother&#39;s head.  She would do or say anything that he wanted to get <br/>
out of that situation alive and to prevent me from watching her get <br/>
shot.  This is not a scene from a movie or a dramatized portrayal of <br/>
reality, this actually happened.  My mother lied, &quot;Yes, I love you <br/>
and only you.  I will do anything for you.  You are a wonderful <br/>
husband and father&quot;  She would do ANYTHING to keep from getting <br/>
shot.  Did she set a bad example for me?  Or did she save her own <br/>
life?  This IS extreme, yet a lie had occurred.  I could care less <br/>
about her dishonesty because, &quot;No, I don&#39;t love you, I hate you.  You <br/>
are a horrible person.&quot; would have gotten her killed.<br/>
<br/>
A very similiar thing happened to my best friend when she was married <br/>
to an abusive alcoholic man (the father of her only child).  Jim and <br/>
I were playing cards at their house one night and we were all <br/>
drinking, having a good, but competitive time (spades, men <br/>
vs.women).  An argument broke out between her and her husband and <br/>
things got out of control very quickly.  Her husband, too, was a <br/>
hunter and had a rifle.  Right in front of us, he went and got his <br/>
shotgun and pointed it at her.  I do not know if it was loaded, but <br/>
all of us would have said or done anything to have him put that gun <br/>
away!<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, when Jim & I were teenagers we went to a quarry <br/>
with a big group of our friends and had a bonfire and a party that <br/>
night.  Two teenage guys that we didn&#39;t know came out of the woodsy <br/>
area and right up to us wondering what we were doing there.  One was <br/>
carrying a shotgun and the other an ax or hatchet.  They certainly <br/>
didn&#39;t look friendly, and we were on their &quot;turf&quot;.  Here we are, very <br/>
suburban, &quot;whitebread&quot; teenagers staring at two &quot;gang&quot; members.  So, <br/>
one of our very outspoken friends stood up, apologized for us <br/>
intruding, offered for all of us to leave, then offered a beer, and, <br/>
ultimately, diffused the situation.  I&#39;m pretty sure that lying <br/>
occurred here, too, because we weren&#39;t sorry for being there, we <br/>
didn&#39;t want to leave, and didn&#39;t want them to stay.  But, no one had <br/>
gotten shot, either.<br/>
<br/>
So, guns can leave you in very unexpected situations and getting out <br/>
of that situation, by any means, would be, in my opinion, by far, the <br/>
safest.  I believe that those who offered the opinion that, by <br/>
telling your children in advance about gun safety and that &quot;you have <br/>
to be home 10 minutes ago if a gun comes out&quot; is very sound advice <br/>
that could save a life.<br/>
