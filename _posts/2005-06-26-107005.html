<div id="ygrps-yiv-373065510">Hi everyone,<br/>
I need some advice, and I value what I read on this list so much that I decided to to see if anyone has some suggestions.  My youngest daughter is 12, she had a difficult time with lots of ear infections, needed tubes etc...until she was probably 8years old, when she finally out grew most of the issues.  This slowed down her speech and language development for some time, and we haven&#39;t worried about it, we&#39;ve just let her move along at her own pace.  All of her &#39;speech differences&#39; have worked themselves out on their own with no problems, and up until now caused her no difficulty.  The last remaining &#39;language difference&#39; that she has is causing some kids to not want to hang out with her.  I&#39;ve noticed kids giving her strange looks when she does this, and many tend to avoid her. I can tell she notices too and is starting to feel some rejection. Now this isn&#39;t true within our unschooling group, but it is when she goes to other activities.   She reverses words.  Here is an example:  We<br/>
 were leaving a social event and I noticed she was wearing a necklace.  I asked her about it and she said &quot;oh, a friend gave me a necklace Indian.&quot;  I thought a moment and said &quot;do you mean an Indian style necklace?&quot;  She says &quot;yea, I told her I liked native American art and she brought this for me.&quot;  She will sometimes reverse the syntax of the whole sentence.  &quot;The trampoline we jumped and had fun.&quot;  Instead of &quot;We had fun jumping on the trampoline.&quot;  It is inconsistent, she doesn&#39;t do it all the time, but it is frequent enough that it is affecting her social life.  What, if anything, should I do? Ideas?<br/>

<br/>
When a child has tubes, there can be all kinds of<br/>
issues with language development, ranging from Central<br/>
Auditory Processing Disorder to Visual Processing<br/>
Disorder. Sometimes these issues can be identified<br/>
with testing, other times they remain a mystery. I<br/>
would suggest that you speak to a speech therapist or<br/>
audiologist--it may be something easily solved. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck...<br/>

  Hi everyone,<br/>
I need some advice, and I value what I read on this list so much that I <br/>
decided<br/>
to to see if anyone has some suggestions.  My youngest daughter is 12, <br/>
she had a<br/>
difficult time with lots of ear infections, needed tubes etc...until <br/>
she was<br/>
probably 8years old, when she finally out grew most of the issues.  <br/>
This slowed<br/>
down her speech and language development for some time, and we haven&#39;t <br/>
worried<br/>
about it, we&#39;ve just let her move along at her own pace.  All of her <br/>
&#39;speech<br/>
differences&#39; have worked themselves out on their own with no problems, <br/>
and up<br/>
until now caused her no difficulty.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Are you sure? Maybe you&#39;ve just grown used to her mispronunciations? Do <br/>
you think maybe the other children aren&#39;t &quot;hearing&quot; what you&#39;re hearing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;s Gail? &lt;g&gt; She&#39;s our &quot;resident&quot; speech pathologist! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be by soon. I think she&#39;s en route from Albuquerque to <br/>
Jacksonville now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does she happen to know any Deaf people?  Is she interested in ASL?  Her <br/>
word order is very much like American Sign Language, it&#39;s been often <br/>
said that Yoda speaks ASL &lt;bg&gt;  It would greatly enhance her <br/>
understanding of ASL grammar, if her brain is already working that <br/>
way... maybe the comparison between ASL and English will put the word <br/>
orders where they belong.... and if not, she&#39;ll have an easy second <br/>
language :) <br/>
