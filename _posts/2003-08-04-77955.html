<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161884361">Hello.  Before I begin, I thought it would be best to introduce <br/>
myself.  My name is Stephanie and I have two daughters, ages 3 and 6, <br/>
who have never been to school.  I have been lurking here for about a <br/>
year, and haven&#39;t ever really mustered up the nerve to post.  I read <br/>
a lot, when I can, and this email list has been extremely inspiring <br/>
and helpful to me.  So a quick &quot;thank you&quot; to all who contribute:  <br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Now, the other bit.  I have been arguing with people I don&#39;t know <br/>
about homeschooling, unschooling, and schooling today.  This is <br/>
annoying in itself, but while I was mulling it over, this thought <br/>
came to me:  I think it is telling that whenever people argue with me <br/>
about school vs. home/unschooling, they always say, &quot;I will readily <br/>
admit that school has it&#39;s problems, but nothing is perfect.&quot;  Yet, I <br/>
have never felt the need to make a similar statement about <br/>
unschooling (school-at-home maybe, but not unschooling).  And <br/>
further, I don&#39;t think that many other unschoolers would feel the <br/>
need to either.<br/>
<br/>
But then I thought that maybe that wasn&#39;t entirely true.  Maybe other <br/>
unschoolers do find that unschooling has its problems, maybe even <br/>
ones I would agree with.  So, I decided to ask you all.<br/>
<br/>
Does unschooling have its own problems?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s perfect, <br/>
but I do think it &lt;i&gt;works&lt;/i&gt;, while school does not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there we go.  My first real post.  Any thoughts? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357767337">As a very new unschooler I have to say that I am having a problem with the contrast between what we are doing (attempting to moment to moment give our sons freedom and respect) and what the kids (parents) they are often around are all about.   When my 6 year old recently came back from a week long trip to the beach with his cousin, Aunt and Uncle I wished I could put him in a decompression chamber that would release him from all the negative influences he had experienced.   His cousin spends a lot of time in school, after school programs, camp and then doing parent created home work (even on vacation I found out).  They don&#39;t read to him (he is 6 as well); they have him read to them every night.  The uncle teased my son, after my son had been making friends with some girls and playing with them for a few hours, saying &quot;Gillen has a girl friend&quot;...  Now Gillen thinks he is not cool if he plays with girls (I know this is probably temporary).  He also learns a lot of school -like<br/>
 competitive stuff when he plays with school kids (some of them).  It takes him days or weeks to leave this stuff behind.  I am probably oversensitive to it, but this issue is the hard part to me.  I don&#39;t want to shelter my children.  I want to provide a model of staying true to myself so they will be true to themselves as well.   And I don&#39;t want them to feel that it is &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;.  But lately, I often feel that way.  When I am feeling judgemental I want to be able to inflence these people I&#39;m judging by my parenting rather than trying to recruit them, verbally,  to my way of thinking!  I guess this is all about unschooling in a society that has so many completely other end of the spectrum beliefs about education.<br/>

<br/>
I think the only problems I have had unschooling have been the ones I have<br/>

unneccessary clothes and I am gradually peeling them off. The sense of<br/>
freedom inside me is growing all the time.<br/>
<br/>
 My husband&#39;s problem when we first began was that unschooling was too much<br/>
like utopia for the kids and &quot;how will they learn to cope in the real<br/>
world?&quot;. He doesn&#39;t think like that now and wants  the kids to have the<br/>
happiest childhood they can.<br/>
<br/>
 I think when adults say that sort of thing, it comes from jealousy and a<br/>
resentment that they didn&#39;t have that freedom when they were young. Kinda<br/>
sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319602151">The biggest problem about unschooling is I cannot take off and do what I<br/>
want, when I want during the day anymore. My time is no longer just my time.<br/>
I really don&#39;t care, I love my kids but some days I miss getting grocery<br/>
shopping done without someone grabbing food I will not have in my house (Mud<br/>
and Bugs cereal comes to mind, I have one with a wheat allergy) and tossing<br/>
it in the cart. If that is the worst thing I can say about it then I think I<br/>
am on the right track.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121981918">Yeah, OK, unschooling does have its problems. Parents feel isolated <br/>
often, if all their friends and family are school/school-at-homers. Many <br/>
families find it difficult to carve out time/money issues. Parents often <br/>
feel a loss of free time (although I often think that&#39;s a <br/>
grass-is-greener issue in that few PS parents have much free time <br/>
between taxiing, working, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Kids missout on all kinds of experiences--I mean my kids may grow to <br/>
adulthood without ever knowing how to fake illness. They don&#39;t know you <br/>
have to drop whatever you&#39;re doing, no matter how interesting, every 50 <br/>
minutes, or keep doing something, no matter how dull, for 50 minutes. <br/>
They&#39;ll never understand that you can&#39;t get away from unpleasant, even <br/>
dangerous, people and that you have no power over where you go when or <br/>
who you associate with. How will they ever know that how you hold your <br/>
pants when you go to the restroom is a major issue you can hear about <br/>
for months (and hear in your head for the rest of your life)?<br/>
<br/>
And many more.<br/>

<br/>
but I do think it works, while school does not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was if the kids were in school I could have a job and we&#39;d <br/>
have more money, but that&#39;s not entirely a done deal.  School lets out early, <br/>
and lots of people have kids spread out in age, so it&#39;s either paying <br/>
babysitters, having latchkey kids, or afterschool programs or SOMETHING.  <br/>
<br/>
So cancel that disadvantage.  I would probably still be home if they were in <br/>
school, and there are lots of school expenses, even with public school, so we <br/>
would be poorer, not richer, if they were in school.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents think they would get tired of being with their kids every <br/>
day, but I haven&#39;t found that to be a problem at all.  In the same way if you <br/>
hang around with another friend (like an adult now, for me, or a kid when I was a <br/>
kid), if you see them every day you have LOTS more to talk about than if you <br/>
just see them once a week.   <br/>
<br/>
I had a long lunch with a friend from my home town on Friday, at the airport <br/>
as she was leaving New Mexico after visiting her mom.  We could have talked <br/>
for HOURS, but we had years&#39; worth of stuff to share.   I could have talked for <br/>
hours with my friend who was here Saturday, too, because I know about all <br/>
kinds of aspects of his daily life, and he about mine.   <br/>
<br/>
My kids and I talk about everything.  Their friends, mine; their collections, <br/>
mine; their childhoods, mine; their dreams and ideas and funny thoughts, <br/>
mine.   Yet I see people whose kids are in school, and they have very little to <br/>
talk about, and very little time to try to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Another advantage.<br/>

I do.<br/>

When they&#39;re with &quot;school kids&quot; I&#39;ve just said to the other kids that one of <br/>
the best things about my kids not going to school is they don&#39;t learn that <br/>
school-kid bullying, and I don&#39;t want them learning it at home (or wherever it <br/>
is) either.<br/>
<br/>
Most kids have been great about that when I pointed it out.  They do it <br/>
without thinking, so giving them reason to think isn&#39;t too bad!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could mention to your relatives the next time that you don&#39;t want <br/>
him coming back feeling like he&#39;s been to school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774582838">My neighbor, who has been hs her two ds ages 9 and 6 for three years is now<br/>
faced with having to put them in school starting Thursday.  Her Dh is the<br/>
one deciding that HE wants them to go to school.  He just doesn&#39;t feel that<br/>
she is doing an adequate job of teaching them.  Now the reason I&#39;m writing<br/>
to you all is because she wants me to convince her dh that hs is best for<br/>
them.  I&#39;ve already told her that if I talk to him, I&#39;m going to give him<br/>
the UNschooling slant.  My question to you is what do or can I say to him<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743253656">Not really sure you could say anything to make a difference. But if you want<br/>
to give it a try, I would compile some studies on homeschoolers, you know<br/>
how much better they do with testing and social aspects. I would get a list<br/>
of the famous homeschoolers throughout history, maybe even getting some<br/>
homeschoolers now of famous people if you think that might get to him. I<br/>
would find articles about homeschoolers winning spelling bees and science<br/>
fairs. Also look for some writings about kids learning at their own pace and<br/>
how important that is for them. Men, in general seem to be more impressed<br/>
with this kind of information regarding their kids education. Good luck.<br/>

Subject: Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Introduction and question: Is<br/>
unschooling perfect?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yeah, OK, unschooling does have its problems. Parents feel isolated<br/>
&gt; often, if all their friends and family are school/school-at-homers. Many<br/>
&gt; families find it difficult to carve out time/money issues. Parents often<br/>
&gt; feel a loss of free time (although I often think that&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; grass-is-greener issue in that few PS parents have much free time<br/>
&gt; between taxiing, working, etc).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kids missout on all kinds of experiences--I mean my kids may grow to<br/>
&gt; adulthood without ever knowing how to fake illness. They don&#39;t know you<br/>
&gt; have to drop whatever you&#39;re doing, no matter how interesting, every 50<br/>
&gt; minutes, or keep doing something, no matter how dull, for 50 minutes.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;ll never understand that you can&#39;t get away from unpleasant, even<br/>
&gt; dangerous, people and that you have no power over where you go when or<br/>
&gt; who you associate with. How will they ever know that how you hold your<br/>
&gt; pants when you go to the restroom is a major issue you can hear about<br/>
&gt; for months (and hear in your head for the rest of your life)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And many more.<br/>

What has prompted the change ?<br/>
Is there something he thinks they should know and don&#39;t ?<br/>
Has he been embarrased in front of someone else&#39;s kids by his own kids<br/>
apparent lack of education ?<br/>
Or is it a general reaction to HS ? Again it would be useful to find out<br/>
what&#39;s prompted the change.<br/>
Is it conceivable that it&#39;s nothing to do with education but just wanting to<br/>
have a go at her ?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My neighbor, who has been hs her two ds ages 9 and 6 for three years is<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; faced with having to put them in school starting Thursday.  Her Dh is the<br/>
&gt; one deciding that HE wants them to go to school.  He just doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; she is doing an adequate job of teaching them.  Now the reason I&#39;m writing<br/>
&gt; to you all is because she wants me to convince her dh that hs is best for<br/>
&gt; them.  I&#39;ve already told her that if I talk to him, I&#39;m going to give him<br/>
&gt; the UNschooling slant.  My question to you is what do or can I say to him<br/>
&gt; that would make any difference to him at this point?<br/>

Shan&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I wouldn&#39;t take on the job of convincing her husband, but you could give her some information that may help her convince him to continue homeschooling.  You mentioned he was worried that she wasn&#39;t doing an adequate job of teaching them.  Maybe she should try shift the focus from her teaching to what they are learning and point out all the learning that is happening at home.  Maybe if it doesn&#39;t look like school learning, he&#39;s not seeing it.  You can be supportive by being available to him for questions he may have about how it works in another family.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like he might benefit from a bit of &quot;academic&quot; support for homeschooling as well.  There&#39;s a paper that was published by The Fraser Institute (an independent Canadian economic and social research and educational organization) in 2001 that reviews homeschooling in North America entitled &quot;Home Schooling: From the Extreme to the Mainstream&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Executive Summary: This paper establishes that home schooling is a thriving educational movement both in Canada and the United States. It also empirically demonstrates that the academic and socialization outcomes for the average home schooled child are superior to those experienced by the average public school student. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link to the paper overview:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/shared/readmore.asp?sNav=pb&id=253">http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/shared/readmore.asp?sNav=pb&id=253</a><br/>
<br/>
It does state in the paper that of the two main &quot;strains&quot; of homeschooling, the second strain traces it&#39;s lineage to John Holt: &quot;Holt advocated educational democratization and greater parental autonomy (sometimes known as &quot;laissez-faire home schooling&quot;), more recently referred to as unschooling.&quot;  So it can&#39;t be claimed that the successful outcomes the author found were based exclusively on &quot;school-at-home&quot; environments.<br/>
<br/>
And a link to the actual paper - a pdf file (need Adobe Reader):<br/>

Maybe she can print it and read it to/with her husband, or at least ask him read it and discuss it after.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OK, so I went way off about me and mine, but the answer to your question is,<br/>
&gt; for US, unschooling is perfect. We can&#39;t imagine living any other way and<br/>
&gt; would never go back to a school mentality. We trust each other & our kids and<br/>
&gt; our <br/>
&gt; family trusts us. So we would call that perfect all by itself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in agreement with Rhonda about this.  If there&#39;s a way I find<br/>
unschooling imperfect, it&#39;s related to walking through life constantly<br/>
feeling out of step.  Even though I *choose* be be out of step, it&#39;s still<br/>
annoying sometime.  It&#39;s all that good socialization I got in school -- I<br/>
hear the drummer and start thinking conform, conform.  But my heart doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to.  So I like being out of step with the world, but it&#39;s also a<br/>
bother.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s a small thing, really, for the peace and joy that unschooling<br/>
brings us.<br/>

After 7 weeks in the NICU (he is due next week but came in May) everything<br/>
was looking good... then the projectile vomiting started. He is being seen<br/>

I&#39;m trying to think of what kinds of problems the projectile vomiting would<br/>
indicate at this point.  Hope it&#39;s minor, even if surgery is needed.<br/>

It is GERD. Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease. In preemies this is often<br/>
caused by a polyp growing the gastro-intestinal tract. You can feel it on<br/>
his little tummy. It feels like an olive (doctors description).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941226865">Well, when she mentioned it to me, my immediate response was that there was<br/>
no way he was going to listen to me.  I mean, who am I to him?  Ykwim?  But<br/>
she kept asking, so that&#39;s when I came here for some thoughts.  I didn&#39;t end<br/>
up being the bad person.  But like I thought, my being there and giving my<br/>
two cents has not changed his mind whatsoever.  It seems that she needs to<br/>
work on their relationship first, like having dinner earlier than 9pm and<br/>
having the house a little orderlier (is that a word?) and doing the wash a<br/>
little more often.  I think if she works on that, he would be more inclined<br/>
to think that she could handle the homeschooling part.  (because there is no<br/>
way they would even talk about my unschooling)  the one thing he mentioned<br/>
is that the 9yo doesn&#39;t read yet and she kept saying that yes he does read.<br/>
I interjected with a question &quot;what is the magic number that a person is<br/>
supposed to be able to read?&quot;  Of course he didn&#39;t have an answer for that.<br/>
So I said, then why is it a big deal that Kody can&#39;t read yet?  He&#39;s going<br/>
to learn to read but in his own time.  Well, that just wasn&#39;t good enough<br/>
for him.  I really didn&#39;t talk much.  They talked to each other and I just<br/>
kind of sat there most of the time.  It felt kind of weird listening to them<br/>
air out their dirty laundry in front of me.<br/>
So after about 30 minutes, Quinn got a dirty diaper and I had to go home.<br/>
It was good timing actually, because he wouldn&#39;t budge and I was getting<br/>
tired of listening to them blame each other.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for everyone&#39;s thoughts on this.<br/>

You are a braver woman than I.. I would run away from this cause you are<br/>
going to be the bad person no matter what (OK I am feeling pessimistic here<br/>
but we had some scary news about our preemie today so I am not the most<br/>
cheerful person on the planet). I avoid husband/wife debates LIKE THE<br/>
PLAGUE!!! but if you want to... I would find out what he thinks is wrong<br/>
with what they are learning now and how he expects school to fix it.<br/>

we&#39;ll see what happens.<br/>
