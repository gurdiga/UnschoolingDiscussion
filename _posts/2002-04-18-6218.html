<div id="ygrps-yiv-412567863">I&#39;m one of the people that rarely &quot;hops on board&quot; but I did take a few minutes to look at the pictures.  Wonderful pictures.  I&#39;m curious about Johanna&#39;s family.  It looks like you have four children around the same age as mine.  Do you have twins?  Mine are two years old and my other two are 8 and 6.  It seems that many of the folks on this board have one or two children.  In times of doubt it&#39;s nice to know others that are unschooling more than two.  Johanna, if you read this feel free to email me.<br/>

  WOW!! I had not seen all the pictures for a while..finally took the <br/>
  time to look.<br/>
  Joyce and Mary are NOT what I pictured!! It&#39;s very hard to match <br/>
  images in your brain with reality sometimes.<br/>
  I pictured Mary as this long, dark haired person....kind of asian <br/>
  looking. She looks a lot like ME!! LOL<br/>
  And Joyce I had an older image with dark hair...why do I always <br/>
  picture people with dark hair?<br/>
  It&#39;s so neat to see the happy smiling faces irl that I chat with here.<br/>
  And all those free and joyful kids!!<br/>
  I actually had a similar image of Sharon (of the swamp) in my <br/>
  head....amazing! So one out of three&#39;s not bad?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Catherine<br/>
No twins here.<br/>
Carly is 11, (but the size of a 8yo),Sam is 8, Jack is 5 and Jamie <br/>
will be 3 next month(MY BABY! Waaaaaaaa!).<br/>
I think there is a big difference in the relationship you can have <br/>
with an only child or two.<br/>
If even one of mine is gone, it makes a big difference in the time <br/>
spent with the others and the way they relate to each other.<br/>
It&#39;s different.  Not better or worse.<br/>
It&#39;s definatley not perfect and sweet here all the time.<br/>
Lots of high energy.  <br/>
Joanna(no &#39;h&#39;) ;-)</div>
