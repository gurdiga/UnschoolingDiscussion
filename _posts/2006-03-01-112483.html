<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092746961">Scientists observing how ant colonies learn the path<br/>
to a food source have an interesting definition of the<br/>
word &quot;teach.&quot; Check out this article:<br/>

<br/>
To them, the essence of teaching is that it requires<br/>
some sort of sacrifice on the part of the teacher.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928813317">-=-The researchers show that the lead ant in the tandem pair could  <br/>
reach the food stash four times faster when not slowed by a follower.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-But the follower ant finds the food faster than when searching  <br/>
alone and is ultimately able to quickly run solo errands. The process  <br/>
likely increases the fitness of the entire ant colony, the  <br/>
researchers say, by making the ants more efficient.<br/>
<br/>
-=-According to Franks, the lead ant&#39;s sacrifice is a hallmark of  <br/>
teaching that until now has been shown only in humans.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but ants are the friggin&#39; BORG (minus the assimilation and the  <br/>
cool ship).  It was no sacrifice for that lead ant.  He could get  <br/>
there faster, but he couldn&#39;t carry more.  They don&#39;t go out and  <br/>
eat.  They go out, get food, and carry it back to the collective.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-In addition, the Bristol researchers say that teaching involves a  <br/>
two-way relationship between the teacher and pupil.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well that&#39;s true.   Yet people say &quot;I taught him, but he didn&#39;t learn  <br/>
it.&quot;  Then the response has to be &quot;If he didn&#39;t learn it, you didn&#39;t  <br/>
teach him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because teaching is a paid profession here, it&#39;s something people do  <br/>
by showing up and performing behaviors and filing reports.  Only very  <br/>
secondarily do they measure the learning and compare it to  <br/>
anything.   Learning is a distant byproduct sometimes in the minds of  <br/>
those who say they are teachers.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For example, on the return trip the follower ant often takes a  <br/>
different, more direct path than the one it was taught.-=-<br/>
<br/>
They could have used &quot;shown&quot; instead of &quot;taught.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Franks and Richardson say the ants acquire knowledge about finding  <br/>
a food source, as well as gaining more general knowledge about their  <br/>
environment.-=-<br/>
<br/>
They could have said &quot;learn&quot; instead of &quot;acquire knowledge.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere in there, I think, did they talk about learning�about the  <br/>
ants being smart enough to learn, and needing to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105860821">&lt;&lt;Nowhere in there, I think, did they talk about<br/>
learningabout the  <br/>
ants being smart enough to learn, and needing to<br/>
learn.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I googled several articles about this study. The big<br/>
argument the scientists seem to be having with each<br/>
other is whether the ants KNEW they were teaching and<br/>
KNEW they were learning. <br/>
<br/>
And it seems that the scientists think the process has<br/>
to be painful or unpleasant on both sides--that&#39;s how<br/>
they&#39;ll KNOW it&#39;s intentional, rather than the ants<br/>
just working on instinct.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the leader ant finds it a JOYFUL experience to<br/>
go slower and bring the follower ant along. Maybe the<br/>
follower ant is having FUN following and feels really<br/>
good about the new knowledge it has gained.<br/>
<br/>
It just struck me quite strongly in all the articles I<br/>
read that the basic assumption the scientists were<br/>
making was flawed. And, of course, it&#39;s so ingrained<br/>
in them to think &quot;schoolishly&quot; that they aren&#39;t even<br/>
aware of the assumption they&#39;re making.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;m being anthropomorphic (had to look that<br/>
up to make sure I&#39;m using it correctly) here--I doubt<br/>
ants feel Joy or Pride.<br/>
<br/>
The question was, are the ants AWARE that they&#39;re<br/>
TEACHING. And I think the answer could be that it&#39;s<br/>
just a part of their lives to be mindful in how they<br/>
live and to make it possible for others can learn from<br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
The leader/follower thing was initiated by the<br/>
Follower ant. So it could be that the Follower ant saw<br/>
some knowledge out there in the colony that it knew it<br/>
needed. And it pursued that knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I think these scientists should talk to some<br/>
unschoolers before they design their next study.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the language is stymied because it is jargon. Probably (not<br/>
having read the articles, so entirely supposition on my part) the<br/>
researchers are arguing that there is a cost to teaching.  The lead<br/>
ant needing to slow up being the cost to her (right, workers are<br/>
female in ants?) efficiency at foraging. The cost isn&#39;t a massive<br/>
energetic cost, the second ant having to keep tapping being more<br/>
energetically expensive than the lead ant slowing down.  But, if a<br/>
cost is incurred it argues that this is an altruistic act.  And<br/>
altruism is a happy buzzword in evolutionary biology.  But, Sandra&#39;s<br/>
right, ants are Borgs.<br/>

Queen to make more babies.  Not mindfulness.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But that &quot;efficiency&quot; argument, they seemed to forget, doesn&#39;t hold.   <br/>
She&#39;s not being paid by the load.  She&#39;s not gathering her own  <br/>
personal food.  She/he/it is gathering for the common store.  So it&#39;s  <br/>
probably more efficient to get help.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I watched ants a lot.  I also dug them up to look  <br/>
at their rooms (not realizing until I was older that I was destroying  <br/>
many weeks of hard ant labor).  I especially liked to see the trails  <br/>
that were some distance from the antbed, where the ants would do a  <br/>
kissy-face thing with the ants they were meeting on the trail.  They  <br/>
would touch antennae at least, and then keep going.  I always figured  <br/>
they were just confirming that it was the right trail, and there was  <br/>
still some food over there or something.<br/>
<br/>
A friend showed me that if you camp near and ant bed, they won&#39;t  <br/>
bother you if you just give them so much food close to them that they  <br/>
would never leave for the whole weekend.  Makes sense!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if a particular ant isn&#39;t helpful the other ants will ignore  <br/>
it, or run it off or eat it.  Maybe it&#39;s self-preservation to be  <br/>
cooperative and not altruism.  Maybe even aphids don&#39;t like to be  <br/>
ignored.  Or maybe they don&#39;t care. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Read somewhere today that ants are descended from wasps (not 100% sure <br/>
that&#39;s correct). I know that lots of wasps reproduce by laying their <br/>
eggs in the eggs of other species. The wasp larvae eat the other <br/>
specie&#39;s larvae from the inside out. Ants are even more like the Borg <br/>
now!<br/>
