<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641710120">Hi All,<br/>
My name is Jodye and I&#39;m new to this list.  I&#39;ve got four kids - 12, 9, 5 and <br/>
13 months.  This is our second year of homeschooling, but we&#39;ve just recently <br/>
begun to venture into unschooling.  Everyone seems much happier when we just <br/>
kind of go with the flow, and I&#39;ve been okay with it until today.  I happened <br/>
to run into a lady I know (our kids would be in school together if we weren&#39;t <br/>
HSing)  and she asked how HSing was going.  I gave her the usual generic <br/>
speech I&#39;ve memorized for these occasions.  But it wasn&#39;t enough for her.  <br/>
She had question after question, and I&#39;m sorry to say I wasn&#39;t prepared in <br/>
the least to answer them.  After talking to her I don&#39;t feel quite as sure of <br/>
myself, or of my belief that unschooling is the way to go.  I know, I <br/>
know...I&#39;m a wimp.  Really, I don&#39;t want to feel this way.  I want it to be <br/>
true that I&#39;ve finally found a way of life that is comfortable and productive <br/>
for my whole family.  My daughter also expressed some doubts today about <br/>
whether she&#39;d be &quot;behind&quot; the other kids should she ever decide to go back to <br/>
school.  Although I knew the &quot;answer&quot; to her question, I found it very <br/>
difficult to articulate it.  Maybe I&#39;m still not confident enough in what I <br/>
believe.  Could it be that I don&#39;t even fully believe that unschooling will <br/>
work?  But, I do believe it!  Please help me out here.  Success stories would <br/>
be great, especially stories of older kids.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

My niece and her 3 siblings are unschooled and my niece went to <br/>
College this past year.  They are all quite acomplished young <br/>
adults.  They are a wondeful sucess story, I may write a book about <br/>
them one day.  They are the reason we are unschooling.  There is <br/>
nothing like having support.  I do not mean a support group, but just <br/>
a friend that also unschools, or an e-mail list!<br/>
Trust is what I always hear in anything.....and most of all in <br/>
unschooling.  We must trust ourselves and our children&#39;s abilities.  <br/>
There is always those times when talking to someone that does not <br/>
seem supportive that we sometimes feel our confidence wavering.  <br/>
Good Luck<br/>
