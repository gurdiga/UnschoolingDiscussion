<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016281426">My second son would never try watermelon. Then one summer we kept buying it <br/>
and his brothers kept eating, so he decided to try it. He loved it so much he <br/>
ate almost half of it.<br/>
What&#39;s really weird is that he had no problem trying this strange fruit from <br/>
China when we were in WDW. Which by unanimous family consensus is the worst <br/>
thing any of us has put in our mouths :o)<br/>

&gt;When Matt was very little and I was still mega-monitoring <br/>
&gt;food (making sure each child got a certain amount of foods from each <br/>
&gt;food group each day), I MADE him (shudder) eat a piece of cantalope.  <br/>
&gt;He told me he didn&#39;t want it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the other hand, my son was glad when I insisted he tried another <br/>
strawberry.  He had tried them several times and said he didn&#39;t like <br/>
them, but then I realised that he was actually only licking them!  Have <br/>
you ever licked a strawberry? No flavour, just sort of rough and <br/>
slightly well, almost hairy.  Blurk!  So, believe it or not, I peeled a <br/>
strawberry for him and once he had licked that there was no stopping him!<br/>
