My oldest was like that - he can&#39;t remember a time when he couldn&#39;t read.  <br/>
I&#39;m like you are about books.  I view a good book as a friend.  I think that <br/>
reading can be carried to excess like anything else, but I guess if I had to <br/>
choose a vice for my child (as if they won&#39;t choose their own! LOL) I would <br/>
choose too much reading.  I probably read too much as a child and teen.  I <br/>
always had my nose in a book.  My parents were wise though.  I can&#39;t remember <br/>
them ever once telling me to put the book down and go do something else.  I <br/>
think this is a good thing for me to remember as an unschooler.  I have to <br/>
admit that when my boys have been on the computer for several hours or have <br/>
been drawing comic books for a whole morning, I usually try to redirect them <br/>
to something else.  Maybe I should trust them to stop when they need to stop <br/>
but it&#39;s tough for me not to step in.  My folks must have really trusted me!<br/>

something my parents and extended family had been so tickled by.  Took me<br/>

<br/>
  It seems that everyone I talk to can remember a light bulb moment in the <br/>
  process of learning to read - that AHA where you went from painstakingly <br/>
  sounding out words to actually GETTING it.  It&#39;s as if the code is<br/>
finally <br/>
  broken and you&#39;re seeing the words on the page for what they really are. <br/>
<br/>
  Mine came while I was reading a Family Circus comic strip.  Thelma (Mom)<br/>
is <br/>
  standing in the bathtub holding a part for the plumber, who is working on<br/>
the <br/>
  faucet.  Dolly comes in and says, &quot;That was [so and so] on the phone.  I<br/>
told <br/>
  her you couldn&#39;t talk right now because you are in the bathtub with the <br/>
  plumber.&quot;  I sounded it out, then again, and suddenly I could just READ<br/>
the <br/>
  whole thing without sounding it out at all!   I just looked at all the<br/>
words <br/>
  on the page at once, and they stood on their own, as if they had come to <br/>
  life.  I was 4 at the time, I think.  We were on vacation in Kansas City,<br/>
at <br/>
  a hotel with a pool on the roof, and my sister threw up in the hallway on<br/>
the <br/>
  way back to our room after dinner that night.  She&#39;d had fish. </span></blockquote></div>
