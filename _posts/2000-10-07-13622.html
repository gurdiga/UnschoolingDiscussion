<div id="ygrps-yiv-517395286">Someoen just posted a link to an article about this bloke&#39;s work to <br/>
another list, and I was wracking my brain trying to remember who it <br/>

Anyone else know what I mean?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239798118">I don&#39;t know his website, but I&#39;ve shared the podium with Gordon Neufeld up<br/>
in British Columbia, and he is wonderful.  He has brought attachment<br/>
parenting to a largely very conservative Christian audience, some of whom<br/>
had been tempted to embrace &quot;Ezzo-related&quot; practices (which I personally<br/>
believe are a form of child abuse.)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, (and I know him personally), Gordon has been afflicted with<br/>
severe writer&#39;s block for years, and so you&#39;ll see very little in print.<br/>
But you can find similar material on the Natural Child Project website<br/>
(www.naturalchild.org) run by my old friend Jan Hunt up in British Columbia.<br/>

  I believe it was John Anderson who had read and worked with Gordon<br/>
Neufeld?  He&#39;s still around but I think he&#39;s current set to no mail.<br/>
