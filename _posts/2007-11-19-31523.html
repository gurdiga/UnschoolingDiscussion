<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050533692">My 14yo dd, Roxy, is going to be visiting with my sister for a week in St<br/>
Louis through Thanksgiving holiday.  She is wondering if there are any<br/>
unschooling teens that she might be able to connect with.  Perhaps go to the<br/>
City Museum? <br/>
<br/>

Email me off list.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Lmanathome@...">Lmanathome@...</a><br/>
