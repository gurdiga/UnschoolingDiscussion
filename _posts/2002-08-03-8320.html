<div id="ygrps-yiv-669640084">&lt;&lt;that or a Windjammer cruise&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We went on a Windjammer cruise 2 years ago.  I was sooo disappointed.  I<br/>
thought it would be much more rustic, much less touristy.  It was just like<br/>
a big cruise ship in all but the most superficial ways.  In the brochure, it<br/>
talks about working along side the crew, etc..  In reality, it was one<br/>
morning when volunteers were asked to all pull together briefly on one rope<br/>
to raise sails that aren&#39;t actually used anyway.  The boats are so heavy<br/>
with all the bathrooms, etc., they need motors.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, afternoon naps in the netting off the bow, hanging out over the<br/>
water, almost made up for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275062924">Thanks for the dash of reality. Is there a sailing line out there that lets<br/>
you crew? Maybe I was thinking of another, or maybe I just need my own<br/>
sailboat (as if!)<br/>
