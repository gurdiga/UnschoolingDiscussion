&lt;&lt; DON&#39;T CHEAT BY SCROLLING DOWN FIRST<br/>
 <br/>
 It only takes 30 seconds.  Work  this out as you read. Don&#39;t<br/>
 read the  bottom until you&#39;ve worked it out!<br/>
 <br/>
 1. First of all, pick the number of evenings per week that you would  like<br/>
 to eat out<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 2. Multiply this number by 2.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 3. Add 5.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 4. Multiply it by 50 (where&#39;s that  calculator?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 5. If you have already had your  birthday this year add 1749. If you<br/>
 haven&#39;t, add 1748.<br/>
 <br/>
 6. Now subtract the four digit  year that you were born.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 You should now have a three digit number:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The first digit of this was your<br/>
 original number (i.e. how many times you  want to go out each week).<br/>
 <br/>
 The second two digits are your  age.<br/>
 <br/>
 Neat, huh!<br/>
 <br/>
 This is the only year (1999) it  will ever work, so spread the  fun around<br/>
 while it lasts!<br/>
