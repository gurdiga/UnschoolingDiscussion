<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087845521">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I need some good motherly (Or fatherly!) advice.  My 22 month old has<br/>
croup again.  My other two children never had it and in my family I grew<br/>
up in none of us ever had it, so I&#39;m not overly sure how to treat it.  I<br/>
know about the steam and taking the child out into the cold air trick<br/>
but this is summer so what do I do?  Also, when he&#39;s had it before (this<br/>
might be his 4th episode), it&#39;s always happened at night and by day he&#39;s<br/>
fine.  This time it started at 8 this morning and is continuing through<br/>
the day...is it going to get worse tonight yet?  He seems basically<br/>
fine, is not breathing with great difficulty, just wheezing alot.  We<br/>
all do have bad colds right now so it&#39;s extra tough for him breathing<br/>
when he&#39;s so congested.  Any advice, information or tips please?  I&#39;d<br/>
appreciate anything anyone has to offer.  A friend in the past told me<br/>
to try homeopathy and I did try a couple of doses this a.m. and it did<br/>
not seem to help at all.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063971489">I don&#39;t know how to treat croup, but I do know how nasty it <br/>
sounds, from someone listening to kids who&#39;ve had it!  Hope you <br/>
find some good ways to cope...<br/>
