<div id="ygrps-yiv-710647684">A brief intro--I&#39;ve been lurking for a few weeks.  I&#39;m Liz (45) just<br/>
celebrated 27th wedding anniversary with Jac, parents of 6 kids (4-24, 3 of<br/>
each) grandparents of 1.  I am currently homeschooling 2 of ours, 2 are<br/>
older & out of school (well 1 is in college) and 2 are in public school.<br/>
The question of the good things about public school draws me into this<br/>
conversation. I know that this is antedotal and very personal.<br/>
<br/>
My 13 yo son is in a special public school that only deals with<br/>
multipl-handicapped children birth -21 yrs.  He has cerebal palsy, mental<br/>
retardation, attention deficit disorder, impulsivity, pervasive<br/>
developmental delays and AIDS.  We adopted him when he was three and had<br/>
lived in a hospital all of his life (they told us he wouldn&#39;t live to enter<br/>
school.)  The public school is able to offer him activities and equipment<br/>
that we could never access.  His needs are so great that I could never<br/>
homeschool him and meet the needs of the other children.  However, over the<br/>
summer I do see remarkable progress is some areas due to my focus on his<br/>
development.  But by the same token, I see remarkable progress during the<br/>
school year in other equally important areas due to their ability to work<br/>
with him.  His school has a adult child ratio of 6 adults to 1 child (this<br/>
includes speech & physical therapists, occupational therapist, councilors,<br/>
teachers, aids, etc.) So he gets the best of both worlds.<br/>
<br/>
My 15 year old daughter is in public high school after 1 1/2 years of<br/>
homeschooling.  Her social needs (she is quite an outgoing social<br/>
butterfly)are such that I could not involve her in enough outside activities<br/>
to keep her happy.  She needs to be with lots of people all of othe time in<br/>
order to be happy.  She is also bi-polar and just to be honest, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
deal with her mood swings and constant needs and demands on me.  Once back<br/>
in public school she and I both became much happier (even though I fought<br/>
putting her back in school due to academic problems).  She is better able to<br/>
deal with multiple instructors and such so much better than she can deal<br/>
with one on one instruction and guidance.  I feel that we made a lot of<br/>
progress during her time at home and probably could have made more progress<br/>
if her mental illness had not disrupted the family so severely, that I<br/>
really needed the respite from her.  This may sound like a cop out and<br/>
sometimes I feel that it is, however, it is reality for my family.<br/>
<br/>
So, I feel that there can never be a blanket answer to the question of what<br/>
is best for every child or every family.  Each child even within the same<br/>
family really needs to be treated individually and their educational options<br/>
left open to meet their needs. I believe that institutionally there is not a<br/>
lot of good about ps, but individually ps can be good for certain children &<br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
 Even in homeschooling I find that the 2 kids here must be dealt with very<br/>
differently, not just because of the 10 year span in ages, but in learning<br/>
styles & needs.  My 4 yo balks at being taught anything, he is more<br/>
interested in learning & doing on his own. Unschooling is the answer for his<br/>
education. My 14 yo needs structure and much more guidance in her studies<br/>
(may be due to the 7 years in ps), she isn&#39;t interested in learning for the<br/>
fun of it.  She hasn&#39;t developed any real outside interests that keep her<br/>
occupied. TV & rock music are her only interests at this time.  Yes, alot of<br/>
this is age appropriate for both kids.<br/>
<br/>
Just my $.02.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, <br/>
Liz</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just want to say that I think anecdotal and personal stories are the best!  <br/>
 So I&#39;m glad you posted some. <br/>
<br/>
I can really learn from hearing from other people&#39;s experiences.  They are <br/>
enlightening.  But I find I like to draw my own conclusions from them.  So <br/>
when the conversations gets philosophical, instead of personal, it sometimes <br/>
gets frustrating.  (Not your post, just in general.)<br/>
<br/>
My believe is that we need to give people information, and let them draw <br/>
their own conclusions.  If we push the conclusions on them, they are more <br/>
likely to fight us in frustration.<br/>

<br/>
This is so true, there are so many variations within a family.  My two boys <br/>
are a lot like yours, the older wanting and thriving on the structure, the <br/>
younger so creative and &quot;outside the box&quot;!  It takes all styles of learning <br/>
to and then some to keep these guys going!!<br/>
