&lt;&lt; What the heck is fabric softener for and why do so many people use it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It keeps static cling from forming, it truly makes the clothes ultra soft <br/>
(not so good for towels because they are also less absorbant) and they smell <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
I love Downy because my Mum used it and the clothes were so soft and <br/>
fluffy....it&#39;s true.<br/>
Vinegar works just as well to rid the excess soap and ph balance the water so <br/>
the clothes are softer.<br/>
But you don&#39;t have that wonderful Downy smell...sigh.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The smell makes me nauseous.  This smell is my main reason for not<br/>
buying many second hand clothes from consignment stores and garage<br/>
sales.  I do, on occasion, and I almost always regret it after washing<br/>
the item about 50 times and having it still reek of that Downy smell,<br/>
then I just get rid of the item.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lived in a very humid environment (summers in Iowa) and a very dry<br/>
desert environment (Tucson, AZ, currently) and I&#39;ve never had the need<br/>
for dryer sheets (these give me a rash and I hate their smell, too) or<br/>
any type of softener.  Our clothes are all great and clean and soft.  We<br/>
use Bi-O-Kleen (1 Tbsp, even on diapers with no rinsing) and an<br/>
occasional splash of vinegar at the beginning of a load with clothes<br/>
that have urine in them (mostly diapers).  White vinegar neutralizes<br/>
uric acid.  We use it on cat &quot;accidents&quot;, too.  You can use a black<br/>
light to see where all of the urine is and watch it go away with vinegar<br/>
(here&#39;s your fun science experiment!).  BTW, we own a washer/dryer combo<br/>
unit currently and we love it!<br/>

blankets, comforters, quilts, slip covers, mattress pads etc.  We have bad <br/>
allergies and need to wash all bedding weekly.  This stuff gets pet dander <br/>
and dust mites out and also kills all the smells somehow.  Smoke, Gain (the <br/>
smelliest detergent I&#39;ve ever seen), bounce sheets (we use unscented ones, <br/>
but are trying vinegar now).  Look it up at allergycontrolproducts.com if you <br/>
are interested.  It&#39;s expensive, but well worth what we save in clothing <br/>
costs.<br/>
