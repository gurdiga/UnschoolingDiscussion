<div id="ygrps-yiv-816979534">I&#39;d love to come to this year&#39;s conference, but the prospect of <br/>
driving two days with the kids is beyond daunting.  Are there plans <br/>
to have anywhere within one days drive of Albuquerque in the next <br/>
few years?  Or am I just going to have to suck it up and make the <br/>
drive?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been considering the Rethinking Education, only because it&#39;s <br/>
just one day&#39;s drive, but I think I&#39;d really like Live & Learn <br/>
better.  So, c&#39;mon guys, convince me it&#39;s really worth 4 days in the <br/>
car with two bored kids.  I may be able to talk my dh into coming <br/>
along, but it would mean burning up virtually all his vacation time, <br/>
and in St. Louis no less.  What else is there to in St. Louis?  Is <br/>
Charlotte, NC within a day&#39;s drive or a few hours of Memphis, so we <br/>
could combine other family visiting at the same time?<br/>

Suck it up and make the drive. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
How many hours IS it to drive? I do 12 hours easy in a car---some people wouold make that a three day trip.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to avoid boredom in cars: frequent stops, tvs, video games, new CDs, books on tape/CD, new toys (dollar store), maps----tons of ideas.<br/>

What do you MEAN &quot;in St Louis, no less&quot;????? COOL city! LOTS to do! <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What else is there to in St. Louis?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s all within a day&#39;s drive, depending on what you mean by a day! &lt;g&gt; I drive from Columbia, SC to St Louis easy in a day. I think it&#39;s 12 hours with stops. Memphis is closer by several hours (5?). St Louis is 5 hours from Chicago, Nashville, Memphis, Kansas City---kind of 5 hours from anywhere! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Go to the Live & Learn site and read the testimonials---if THEY can&#39;t convince you.....<br/>

<br/>
Tons of good St. Louis stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about the possibility of a conference using the Old Town Sheraton, <br/>
but I think it&#39;s just too small a hotel.  It&#39;s the only hotel I know of that&#39;s <br/>
within walking distance of really cool stuff, though.  Maybe a <br/>
mini-conference, but how would we keep it small enough for the hotel?  That I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Any hotel project anytime around balloon fiesta would be bad.  Hotels fill <br/>
up.  Off season (away from state fair or balloons or summer) should be cheaper, <br/>
I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540692471">If I had the money, I&#39;d be going - and I&#39;d be coming all the way from <br/>
New Zealand!  I found immense value in a couple of homeschooling <br/>
conferences that were held here years ago, and just KNOW that an <br/>
unschooling conference would be so wonderful that just one would see me <br/>
revitalized enough to want to carry on and unschool my grandchildren, if <br/>
my kids wanted that! I&#39;d drive for 2 weeks each way if it meant I could <br/>
afford to come.<br/>

kids and I still remember that trip.  We went up in the arch (no way <br/>
would I do that now) and saw a Cards game.  They happened to be <br/>
playing the Reds when we were there which was our &quot;home&quot; team. When <br/>
I mentioned to the boys the possibility of going to the conference, <br/>
their first ? &quot;Can you really go up in the arch?&quot; Those are the <br/>
highlights for me, I&#39;m sure there are many other things (I remember <br/>
a park along the river)but to tell you the truth, I don&#39;t know that <br/>
I&#39;ve ever been to any decent size city where I couldn&#39;t find <br/>
something that was fun.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a good 11 or 12 hrs to Oklahoma City, given how often we need to stop.  In our life before kids, it wwould probably  more like 9 hrs, but we find ourselves stopping much more often because of the boys.<br/>

We did St. Louis in &#39;95 -- the arch, etc. -- so I&#39;m not sure what new sightseeing appeal it would hold.  Also, even in October St. Louis is way more humid than we like, can be pretty hot and is that tornado season? <br/>
<br/>
You meant to tell me you come to Charlotte NC and don&#39;t call me???? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Will is in the Charlotte area -- as is my brother.  My sis in Memphis now, so if we&#39;re going to drive as far as St. Louis, we may as well go all the way to NC.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;d like to go -- looks like we still have until July to decide.  I&#39;d just love for it be closer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And you can never really exhaust the science center. No, that&#39;s not <br/>
really &quot;peak&quot; tornado season, although they can happen. I lived in <br/>
St Louis for a year (and visited a bunch more times too) and October <br/>
was one of the nice months - not sticky hot and not drizzly cold. <br/>
The Arch is probably the least of the attractions (IMO since I&#39;ve <br/>
been there a bunch of times) - the arboretum, zoo, science center <br/>
all are high on my list. For something else, did you &quot;do&quot; Laclede&#39;s <br/>
Landing? They&#39;ve renovated the waterfront area into a very cool <br/>
artsy area. PLUS your kids are almost 10 years older now - that <br/>
opens up whole new areas of interest and depths of exploration - I <br/>
don&#39;t plan on a lot of &quot;touring&quot; type stuff with DS when we&#39;re out <br/>
there but a teen might really get into browsing along some of the <br/>
artsy/craftsy shops on the waterfront.</div>

<br/>
I think there are a few other newer hotels downtown -- the ugly yellow one recently written about in the journal (like the Sheraton isn&#39;t an ugly yellow &lt;g&gt;) comes to mind.  You&#39;re right that it should be within walking distance of Old Town and the museums.  By next year, the revamped Tingley Beach area with the zoo and aquarium connected by train would also be nearby.  <br/>
<br/>
It would have to be some time other than September or October, with State Fair and Balloon Fiesta filling town.  Later October is just as pretty weather-wise most years.  <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t specifically wanting one in Albq, just something less than a two-day drive.  Maybe Denver or Phoenix/Tucson? San Diego in &#39;07 sounds good, but I thought someone had talked about &#39;07 being in Columbus, OH.<br/>

that&#39;s for summer. I lived there pretty much my whole life until I was <br/>
30 and I did not know how good I had it until I left. I had never lived <br/>
in a place where it was 75 degrees on Valentines day...guess I like the <br/>
south but I&#39;d rather have a real winter now and then. I cannot remember <br/>
fall being a time of tornados like it is here in Arkansas....<br/>
I know you are disappointed with the drive,  but I have to say it sure <br/>
is nice that a conference is less than a days drive from me. Normally <br/>
they are at either end of the country.<br/>
