<div id="ygrps-yiv-720192010">&lt;&lt; She has no need to write down the time.  She can *tell* time--that&#39;s <br/>
all she needs right now.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little, Kirby and Marty could tell time on a digital clock, <br/>
but not analog.  Holly, three years younger than Marty and five and a half <br/>
years younger than Kirby, came along and she could read an analog clock just <br/>
intuitively, it seemed, almost before she could talk plain.  And so when they <br/>
were out and about, if there was a digital clock they would tell Holly what <br/>
time it was, and if it was analog, they would ask Holly and she would tell <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I never worried about it because I knew they would figure both of them out <br/>
pretty easily, in their own way.<br/>
<br/>
We had a game (Playroom, I think) which had a whole section involving clocks <br/>
(both analog and digital) and they all played with that.  I had a &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>
clock in the boys&#39; room that showed the minutes by fives, and &quot;before&quot; and <br/>
&quot;after&quot; and &quot;quarters&quot; but they didn&#39;t care.  They just saw it as interesting <br/>
art.<br/>
<br/>
And of course now all of them can tell time on any clock, SET any clock or <br/>
brand-new watch (after they chuck the unread directions in the trash), and <br/>
can calculate different time zones.  It&#39;s more than many adults can do.   <br/>
(More than I can do; when I get a new watch or alarm clock, I ask the kids to <br/>
set it.)<br/>

I know there&#39;s a game like this in Trudy&#39;s Time and Place House.  We<br/>
bought the game 5 years ago, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still available. <br/>
(The animated clocks were called Analog Ann and Digitial Dan.)<br/>
