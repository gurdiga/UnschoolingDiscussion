<br>this is why we homeschool. My house doesn&#39;t look like a picture out of House 
<br>and Garden. Projects are all over the house. We have mud on the front door 
<br>and the wonderful sound of sqeals of delight and laughter punctuating many 
<br>conversations. Our children are only children once. Don&#39;t deny them that 
<br>wonderful opportunity. Of course there are always grandkids!</font><font COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">

<br>Yes, this is why I sent the poem, because children are only young once,
<br>and I am grateful for the opportunity to recognize that dirt and chips stuck
<br>in between the couch pillows are a once in a lifetime of my 3 children.
<br>Its also why I love HS, and treasure the thought of unschooling.
