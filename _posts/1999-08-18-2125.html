<br/>
I believe there have been studies done on this but I don&#39;t know the results.<br/>
<br/>
My friend&#39;s son stopped breathing four days after his first whooping cough <br/>
vaccine.  Luckily, the pediatrician took it seriously and reported it (most <br/>
don&#39;t after three days) and he also recommended no more whooping cough <br/>
vaccines for this child.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the whooping cough vaccine is too dangerous to toy with, so I did <br/>
not give it to my youngest child.  And, my other children did not have <br/>
preschool boosters. My oldest had the high pitched screaming for two hours <br/>
after his second whooping cough shot and the doctor wouldn&#39;t report it <br/>
because it wasn&#39;t three hours of screaming (sheesh).  Foolishly I consented <br/>
to his having the next shot, but luckily he was fine.  I have since read that <br/>
the high pitched screaming may be a form of encephalopathy. <br/>
<br/>
I believe there is much benefit to reading these anecdotal reports from <br/>
parents with children who they feel have been damaged by vaccines.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069130436">Back to the vaccination issue for a second. Here is an article I just came<br/>
accross in a hard to find place so I thought I would post it. It gives the<br/>
whole issue an international perspective as it is from New Zealand.<br/>
<br/>
Mary in Idaho (who sees vaccinations as highly relevant to unschooling)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OUR BABY STOPPED BREATHING!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     As dutiful parents, when our first child was born, we got all her shots<br/>
with no obvious side affects. Then Sara came along.<br/>
     It was much different this time. The day after her six-week<br/>
immunisation, I went to get something from a box beside her<br/>
     bed, and glanced at her. She was blue/grey and her eyes were open and<br/>
rolled back in her head. She was cold and not<br/>
     breathing. With my heart in my mouth, I picked her up and shook her.<br/>
She gasped. That was the best sound I have ever<br/>
     heard in my life! She went straight back to sleep, oblivious to my<br/>
turmoil. At that time I didn�t know that a large number<br/>
     of babies who are found not breathing die within 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
     A few weeks earlier I had felt to pray against cot death, and I really<br/>
believe this is what God used to save her. Needless<br/>
     to say, I did not sleep well for the next few days. I called the doctor<br/>
and couldn�t get into see him until the next day,<br/>
     despite my telling the receptionist that it was so urgent. After<br/>
checking, he could not find anything obviously wrong with<br/>
     her. In the meantime, we hired an apnoea monitor to keep an eye on her.<br/>
Five days later we got a phone call from the<br/>
     hospital giving us an appointment in six weeks time! With a lot of<br/>
persuasion, Michael managed to get them to bring it<br/>
     forward to three weeks. But the next day she stopped breathing five<br/>
times � one time for about one and a half minutes. I<br/>
     called the pediatrician and he said to bring her straight into the<br/>
hospital.<br/>
<br/>
     We spent a week at Timaru hospital, while our daughter had myriads of<br/>
tests. There were no answers and we felt they<br/>
     considered us hypochondriacs! That was until she stopped breathing in a<br/>
nurse�s arms. That put the wheels in motion.<br/>
     We were transferred to Dunedin, three hour�s south, for further tests.<br/>
Two weeks later, on Christmas Eve, we were sent<br/>
     home, knowing nothing, except that she had a slightly abnormal EEG, and<br/>
reflux. She was put on medication for both and<br/>
     we were told to come back the following month.<br/>
<br/>
     By January, it became evident that the anti-convulsant she was on was<br/>
not reducing the number of apnoeas by enough to<br/>
     warrant their use so we discontinued them. We were still no closer to<br/>
finding an answer.<br/>
<br/>
     All these trips were starting to stretch the old pockets, so before the<br/>
next appointment we moved to Dunedin. We had<br/>
     only been there one day and she was admitted early as she had an ear<br/>
infection which caused a marked increase in her<br/>
     apnoeas. She was normally having two to three a day.<br/>
<br/>
     She did not have her three-month shot until she was five months, due to<br/>
repeated ear infections. The night she had her<br/>
     shots, she stopped breathing five times � a significant increase. I<br/>
called the pediatrician the next morning and he told me<br/>
     that sometimes the whooping cough vaccine caused that! I wondered why I<br/>
had not been warned of this considering her<br/>
     history. Two months later when she went for her next jab, we omitted<br/>
the whooping cough one. She stopped breathing<br/>
     seven times! This time the pediatrician told me not to worry as one in<br/>
200 babies does this. And they don�t tell everyone?<br/>
     I�ve since met several people with the same story. Some of those babies<br/>
are not alive today.<br/>
<br/>
     In a New Zealand book of case studies on SIDS it is interesting to note<br/>
that a high proportion of cot deaths happened at<br/>
     six weeks, three months and six months. Do you see the same pattern<br/>
that I do? The other interesting thing is that SIDS is<br/>
     almost unheard of in those under six weeks. It used to be unheard of in<br/>
those under two months, before they changed the<br/>
     immunisation schedule.<br/>
<br/>
     I continued researching. Here�s a quote from the book, Vaccination: The<br/>
Hidden Facts by Ian Sinclair. &quot;�We began<br/>
     recording breathing patterns of babies after vaccination. The results<br/>
of these recordings were presented to the 2nd<br/>
     immunisation Conference, held in Canberra, 27-29 May 1991. We<br/>
demonstrated that microprocessor records of babies�<br/>
     breathing after DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus) injections reveal<br/>
a pattern of flare-ups of Stress-Induced Breathing<br/>
     closely following the dynamics of adreno-cortical activity in an<br/>
individual under stress and as observed and recorded by<br/>
     Selye.<br/>
<br/>
     We also demonstrated that flare-ups of Stress-Induced Breathing in<br/>
babies after administration of the DPT vaccine occur<br/>
     characteristically on certain days even though the amplitude of the<br/>
flare-ups varies from child to child. For 70 babies who<br/>
     succumbed to cot death, although babies could die on any day after DPT<br/>
injection, there were significantly more deaths<br/>
     on the days that closely correlated with flare-ups of Stress-Induced<br/>
Breathing after DPT injections� Yet, babies may<br/>
     and do die for up to 25 or more days after vaccination, and still as a<br/>
direct consequence of the toxic effects of the<br/>
     vaccines� Our conclusion is that if vaccination were to be suspended,<br/>
the cot death rate would be at least halved.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
     Sara is now six years and occasionally she still �forgets� to breathe<br/>
in her sleep. She still needs to be monitored every<br/>
     night. Sometimes she stops breathing long enough that she cannot walk<br/>
properly the next morning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231921173">Here are some links that may help you understand why some people choose not <br/>
to vaccinate. I have personally vaccinated my children, not really having <br/>
been read up on the subject at the time. My youngest was hospitalized at 2 <br/>
months old after a vaccination and had to undergo spinal taps, etc. He <br/>
fortunately, turned out fine. We did have a dog die after a vaccination. If I <br/>
were to do it again I would probably selectively vaccinate.<br/>

Yes, Imovax is the human rabies vaccine I was referring to. I&#39;ve received<br/>
it; matter of fact, was among the trial studies when it came out in the<br/>
early 80&#39;s. At the time, we (my classmates and I; student guinea pigs, you<br/>
know) were very grateful to not have to have the duck embryo vaccine, which<br/>
was much more painful and more susceptible to reaction. Cheaper, though.<br/>
<br/>
In general, viral vaccines are propagated on cell lines; if you read through<br/>
the others, there&#39;s monkey fetal cells, or kidney cells, or chick embryo,<br/>
etc. Embryonic cells are best for propagation and there is less chance of<br/>
vaccine reaction if you stay within the same species that will receive the<br/>
vaccine. Please note, I am not defending the decision to use diploid cell<br/>
lines, only pointing out why they&#39;re used. The vaccines that don&#39;t use cell<br/>
lines are bacterial vaccines, which don&#39;t need them.<br/>

vaccine.  If you join the military, you do in fact sign away some of your<br/>
rights regarding health care.  As active duty military, you do NOT have the<br/>
right to refuse treatment.  You can request a second opinion, but the<br/>
military has the final say.  My husband was vaccinated, because he wanted to<br/>
keep his job.  Period.  JAG (Judge Advocate General) corps will tell you<br/>
that, too.<br/>
