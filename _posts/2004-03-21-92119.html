<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915263814">You wrote in an earlier post to get together with another unschooling <br/>
family and start your own unschooling group.  I have a couple of <br/>
questions about this.  1. How did you meet the first family?  I have <br/>
been looking and can&#39;t seem to unearth anyone within an hour driving <br/>
distance of us.  2. What were some of the methods you used to get the <br/>
word out that you had a group to get others interested in attending?  <br/>
And, is it unschoolers only?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

And, is it unschoolers only?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ours is unschoolers only. Melinda and I were both members of and inclusive <br/>
group, INCH (Inclusive Network of Columbia Homeschoolers). At park days and MNOs <br/>
it seemed that she and I were the only ones answering questions----and always <br/>
about unschooling. We figured we should start our own support gruops for <br/>
unschoolers within INCH, so we came up with SOS (School&#39;s Out Support). It was <br/>
just the two of us for a while, but we &quot;converted a couple of families from INCH. <br/>
We started a yahoogroups (just like this one), and sent invites to all the <br/>
groups already established in SC----the inclusive groups, which had a few <br/>
unschoolers in them too. We &quot;advertised&quot; that we were here on Jon&#39;s homeschool page, <br/>
and listed ourselves everywhere there was a place to put our info out. <br/>
There&#39;s alos a network that you can register with that list other homeschoolers in <br/>
your state/city/county. (I can&#39;t remember anything about it, but we got a few <br/>
members from there. Ren, Do you know it?Anyway,they came out of the woodwork!<br/>
<br/>
We also posted flyers at the natural/health food stores. Our libraries won&#39;t <br/>
allow postings,  but that&#39;s a good place to post, if they&#39;ll allow it. When we <br/>
were out and about, we&#39;d always introduce ourselves to families that were <br/>
also out----they&#39;re more than likely homeschoolers, and if they weren&#39;t with a <br/>
group, they were probably unschoolers! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You have to be ro-active. Make yourself known. The only drawback is if I <br/>
wanted to go &quot;underground&quot;, it would be impossible! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where are you? Maybe we already know someone there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824289759">When advertising your group, people will come and then not come back. <br/>
You have to be okay with that - it is better not to try to talk someone <br/>
into staying or to modify what you want out of a group in order just to <br/>
have a &quot;group.&quot; Be clear what you want the group to be - write it down <br/>
so you can hand it to people.<br/>
<br/>
People will eventually come out of the woodwork if you are persistent. <br/>
But - you might have to show up for weeks or months of park days and be <br/>
all by yourself with just one or two other families. Be okay with that, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
You can list your new group in the NHEN support group database. Even if <br/>
your new group is really just you &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
