&quot;It is paradoxical, yet true: Children are the most in<br/>
need of loving attention when they act the least<br/>
deserving of it!&quot;<br/>
                     by Aletha Solter, 1998<br/>
    from the article &quot;Why Children Misbehave&quot;<br/>
                  www.awareparenting.com<br/>
*********************************************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things we&#39;ve seen before, but a unique comparison.  :o)  Drink up,<br/>
everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WATER<br/>
We all know that water is important, but I&#39;ve never seen it written down<br/>
like this before.<br/>
<br/>
a. 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. (Likely applies to half<br/>
world pop.)<br/>
b. In 37% of Americans,the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often<br/>
mistaken for hunger.<br/>
c. Even MILD dehydration will slow down one&#39;s metabolism as much as 3%.<br/>
d. One glass of water shuts down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of<br/>
the dieters studied in a U-Washington study.<br/>
e. Lack of water, the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.<br/>
f. Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could<br/>
significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.<br/>
g. A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory,<br/>
trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or<br/>
on a printed page.<br/>
h. Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by<br/>
45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less<br/>
likely to<br/>
develop bladder cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?<br/>
<br/>
COKE<br/>
No wonder coke tastes soooo good:<br/>
1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of<br/>
Coke in the trunk  to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.<br/>
2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two<br/>
days.<br/>
3. To clean a toilet:  Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl<br/>
and.......Let the &quot;real thing&quot; sit for one hour, then flush clean. The<br/>
citric acid in Coke removes<br/>
stains from vitreous china.<br/>
4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a<br/>
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.<br/>
5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola<br/>
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.<br/>
6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the<br/>
rusted bolt for several minutes.<br/>
7. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap<br/>
the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is<br/>
finished, remove<br/>
the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown<br/>
gravy.<br/>
8. To remove grease from clothes:  Empty a can of coke into a load of<br/>
greasy clothes, add  detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The<br/>
Coca-Cola will help loosen<br/>
grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield.<br/>
<br/>
FYI:<br/>
1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its Ph is 2.8.  It<br/>
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days.<br/>
2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate), the commercial truck must<br/>
use the Hazardous material placards reserved for highly corrosive materials.<br/>
3. The distributors of coke have been using it to clean the engines of<br/>
their trucks for  about 20 years!<br/>

Holly  just lost a tooth.  Maybe she&#39;ll be willing to sacrifice it.<br/>

It seems to me that if any of these things were true, we&#39;d all know for sure <br/>
because it would have dissolved many paper cups, plastic cups, straws...  it <br/>
doesn&#39;t dissolve aluminum but it would dissolve a steel nail?   It doesn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve heard &quot;my uncle dissolved a steak&quot; but as with much urban legend, it&#39;s <br/>
always &quot;my cousin&quot; and if traced back it&#39;s &quot;my cousin&#39;s neighbor.&quot;<br/>

I thought it was supposed to be the acid that was dissolving the nail, so why <br/>
would it matter if it&#39;s flat? Curious because my daughter has decided to try <br/>
this experiment and we haven&#39;t considered changing the coke. Daily? twice a <br/>
day? As soon as flat?<br/>
<br/>
And why would it be a surprise that citric acid could clean stains from a <br/>

eat them.<br/>

If the claim is coke will dissolve a steak in two days and a nail in four, I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-966000181">Not wanting to spend $2.50 on a case of Coke, and not trusting any of the <br/>
Coke-fearing people here to actually get scientific, I went to Google.com and <br/>
entered  &quot;Coke dissolve steak.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the first entry they listed that same list of Coke-things which was posted <br/>
here, and this note followed:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;While all of those stories sound great, Coke is not THAT acidic. In Biology <br/>
101 we tried to dissolve a bone, a tooth, and yes a steak with Coke, Dr. <br/>
Pepper, and Pepsi, none of them devolved anything after two weeks. Besides <br/>
before aluminum cans were popularized in the late 1970&#39;s Coke came in tin <br/>
cans! If it did not dissolve the cans that it sat in for months at a time, <br/>
how could it dissolve a nail in four days? This stuff is dangerous in that <br/>
stories like it hurt my Coke stock! -Dennis  &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283650243">My budding little scientists went down to the junkyard and got a dozen<br/>
bolt/nut combos.  They used diet coke, coke, 7-up, tap water, bottled water,<br/>

They have done several &quot;scientific&quot; experiments including a bunch of what<br/>
they call blindfold tests (taste tests) including which of the milks is<br/>
goat&#39;s milk.<br/>

&gt; Not wanting to spend $2.50 on a case of Coke, and not trusting any of the<br/>
&gt; Coke-fearing people here to actually get scientific, I went to Google.com<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; entered  &quot;Coke dissolve steak.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the first entry they listed that same list of Coke-things which was<br/>
posted<br/>
&gt; here, and this note followed:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;While all of those stories sound great, Coke is not THAT acidic. In<br/>
Biology<br/>
&gt; 101 we tried to dissolve a bone, a tooth, and yes a steak with Coke, Dr.<br/>
&gt; Pepper, and Pepsi, none of them devolved anything after two weeks. Besides<br/>
&gt; before aluminum cans were popularized in the late 1970&#39;s Coke came in tin<br/>
&gt; cans! If it did not dissolve the cans that it sat in for months at a time,<br/>
&gt; how could it dissolve a nail in four days? This stuff is dangerous in that<br/>
&gt; stories like it hurt my Coke stock! -Dennis  &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25555306">Ahhh, but also on the urban legends sites is a statement about sponges being<br/>
safe and that all the stuff that made the rounds of the internet about<br/>
deadly chemicals were urban legends.<br/>
<br/>
Not the case as the sponges themselves clearly state that they are<br/>
poisonious to fish.<br/>
<br/>
I can go on and on with this about how all these expert sites are not<br/>
correct.  The questions still remains unanswered as to point of fact.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, I know all about Goggle and Dogpile and Yahoo and AskJives and<br/>
about 20 other search engines that I use on a routine basis.<br/>
<br/>
And as I remember, the conversation was about removing rust from nails and<br/>
bolts, therefore I didn&#39;t think I needed to repeat the nature of the project<br/>
3 times.  They found a rusted together nut and bolt in the garden.  The coke<br/>
ate the rust away faster and more completely than the other products.  In<br/>
some cases the nut and bolt were reduced to a mere shadow of their former<br/>
selves.  Short of ultrasound and x-rays there would be no way to determine<br/>
in advance the degree of rust damage and as this was a project done by<br/>
children, not a scientific lab, AND they never thought they would have to<br/>
stand the scrutiny of nit picking, we didn&#39;t feel the expense of doing so<br/>
would be justified.  However, they did look into this area and had a nice<br/>
long conversation with a local lab who provided them with some sheet to fill<br/>
out that they use when doing double blind tests.  I thought this was kinda<br/>
nice of the lab folks.<br/>
