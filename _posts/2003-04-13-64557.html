<div id="ygrps-yiv-906685788">I had to leave the list temporarily. Kevin went into the hospital on <br/>
March 7, and we didn&#39;t come home until April 1.  I just skimmed over <br/>
the past two days of messages.  Ouch.  Some of it made me <br/>
laugh...kind of like when a Christian friend confided in me that she <br/>
felt comfortable with me even though I was Catholic.<br/>
<br/>
The kids were so great while Kevin and I were in the hospital that I <br/>
picked up the new Harry Potter: Chamber of Secrets DVD for them today <br/>
at Wal-mart.  Only $14.77...I remember when you couldn&#39;t buy a DVD <br/>
for less than $25.00.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have the Harry Potter Sorcerer&#39;s Stone video game?  What <br/>
is your child&#39;s opinion of it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The kids liked it but I found its lack of fire-power boring. Plus I was hopeless at the jumps and the fake accents grated. but aprt from that it was fun for a bit.<br/>

It might be especially helpful to compare the reviews of both games.<br/>
