<div id="ygrps-yiv-338384915">My mum (whose talent and job is cooking) has burned herself badly while<br/>
cooking - she moved to fast, or tried to do to many things at once, or<br/>
lost concentration - the point is, yes it can happen.<br/>
<br/>
Considering the possibility - what safety / first aid system do you have<br/>
in place in case you or some other adult burns yourself while cooking?<br/>
It might be time to investigate appropriate first aid and ensure that<br/>
anyone who cooks at your house knows that first aid procedure.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to go ahead with a step stool - this might be something<br/>
else that you could get safety advice on.  I am wondering if you would<br/>
need one big enough for Brett to take a step sideways and backwards<br/>
without falling off?<br/>

to the stove and helps stir and dump things (I tried getting him to stand on a chair<br/>

dinner ready if I didn&#39;t let him sit there). Both boys are very good around the stove<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I left the lid to the compost bucket on the stove yesterday, then went to<br/>
turn on a burner under a pot of water and accidentally turned on the one<br/>
under the lid. Then I left the room, and only came back when Rain called<br/>
&quot;Mom, there&#39;s a fire on the stove!&quot; Which there was....<br/>
<br/>
Rain never burns herself or sets things on fire, and she cooks when I&#39;min<br/>
another room (but not when she&#39;s home alone). She&#39;s 9.... I think it has<br/>
something to do with personality, she&#39;s less scattered and more focused<br/>
than I am. I did show her how to do things, and I was dumping heavy pots<br/>
of water until just recently.<br/>
<br/>
I burn my finger every so often, not badly but it hurts a bit. How were<br/>
these kids you know burned badly? I&#39;m trying to picture it - maybe<br/>
pulling pots of water onto themselves? I guess I&#39;d look at the specific<br/>
possible risks and deal with them individually - Rain started with eggs<br/>
in a frame (nest) and it&#39;s pretty hard to burn yourself making those...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785885673">I keep a pretty well-stocked first aid basket here, as I have a DH who I constantly threaten to buy him a spacesuit to wear because he is always hurt somehow. I do have some pads that you&#39;re supposed to put on if you get burned, but I&#39;ve never used them. <br/>
<br/>
We have a step stool in the bathroom, it&#39;s kinda small, but he&#39;s been using it since he was 2, so he knows exactly where he can put his feet without falling off. It&#39;s real sturdy and won&#39;t tip over no matter what. Easy to clean, too. <br/>

  ** Let&#39;s see... One was burned when she thought she&#39;d turned one burner on but turned the one beside it on instead, and laid her arm on the burner that was on. One was burned by an overfilled pot bubbling over and down her leg. My cousin was burned when he did pour hot water all over himself while taking the pot to the sink. A little girl of my dad&#39;s assistant manager at his furniture store died from burns she suffered when she dropped a pan of hot oil. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137012084">Burns are bad - and somewhat inevitable, even for me as an adult.<br/>
Cooking is good, and definitely inevitable.  The kids - even the<br/>
2 yo grandson have had pride of place on the counter next to the<br/>
stove everytime they are interested - which means most times<br/>
cooking is going on.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what we do - some of it may work for you.<br/>
<br/>
First, because we are in the middle of nowhere, we are prepared<br/>
to deal with burns and fires pretty much by ourselves. I have<br/>
confidence in my mix of fire extinguishers, baking soda,<br/>
smothering lids, sterile bandages, ice water, and clothing rules.<br/>
I could tell you exactly where they are and why, but those<br/>
decision are driven largely by how our home is configured.  You<br/>
would probably get better results by taking your 7 to the<br/>
volunteer (or &quot;real&quot;) firestation and asking questions about fire<br/>
and cooking safety.  It&#39;s a fun trip.<br/>
<br/>
Second, but related to the first, counter or no counter sitting,<br/>
there are things that require standing on a step stool.  Get the<br/>
very best no-slip leg taps for the kitchen floor you have.  As a<br/>
general rule, the tips of walking assistance canes are great, but<br/>
experiment until 60 pounds can stretch/bend with 10 pounds of<br/>
something in his hands and no unexpected stool scooting.<br/>
<br/>
Third, pick recipes together.  At 7 he probably can cook any meal<br/>
you can dream up - with the caveat that he needs a couple of<br/>
years of practice.  Having been through &quot;cooking 101&quot; (to be<br/>
schoolish) several times here, the general sequence that fits<br/>
with real food the child will routinely see on the dinner table<br/>
is (1) fruit salads, because fruit typically will not skid under<br/>
a knife is the angle of attack is bad (keep the knives as sharp<br/>
as you possibly can to avoid accidents) (2) vegetable<br/>
salads/dishes though more challenging to cut, still not much risk<br/>
of food poisoning and definitely doable in the microwave (3)<br/>
soups/stews/pasta sauces adds heat that might burn the child, but<br/>
little risk of spattering fat or boil over (4) grilled stuff (5)<br/>
high temperature syrup candy making (6) deep fat frying - I do<br/>
not think anybody under 18 should do that , LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Interspersed in that is oven work, both roasting and bread/cake<br/>
type stuff, microwaving, and assembling (e.g. sandwiches, stuffed<br/>
celery, antipasto).  At 8 months they can participate, if not<br/>
help, in making bread dough.  By 3 or 4 they can make a cake mix<br/>
cake - the in and out of the oven part IMHO ought to be driven by<br/>
what kind of oven you have.<br/>
<br/>
Reading over it, this sounds rigid - and I am not - so take it<br/>
with a grain of salt as a set of &quot;directions&quot; - perhaps more a<br/>
way of deconstructing how to think about the risks/strengths of<br/>
each step.  At 7, I put a meal on the table essentially every<br/>
Saturday night because I really liked to; age and experience have<br/>
to both be considered.  BTW - for anybody still reading, LOL, get<br/>

I can&#39;t put anything in front of the stove, it&#39;s on an island and there&#39;s barely room to walk around it as it is. Grrrr I hate itty bitty kitchens!!!

From: Stephanie Elms Hmmm...both boys help me with cooking on the stove. Jason (5.5 yo) stands on a little<br/>
kids size wooden chair (goes with the kids size table that used to be my moms and <br/>
then mine). It is very stable and puts him at a perfect height. He has been helping <br/>
add things since he was around 3 I think. Kyle (2.5) sits on the counter right next<br/>
to the stove and helps stir and dump things (I tried getting him to stand on a chair<br/>
but he is incredibly insistant on sitting on the counter...I would not be able to get<br/>
dinner ready if I didn&#39;t let him sit there). Both boys are very good around the stove<br/>
and I have never had any close calls. I would not let them cook by themselves however.<br/>

A step stool that&#39;s like steps seems like it would be a lot more stable<br/>
than a step stool that&#39;s like a stool.  (A step stool that&#39;s like a<br/>
ladder would be in the middle of the safety rankings.)<br/>
<br/>
We need more words in this language!  These three things shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
to share the same name.  (Wait - I guess the third one is actually a<br/>
step ladder.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091038478">&lt;&lt;Brett (7) wants to cook. He&#39;s helped me for years with the mixing,<br/>
handing ingrediants, etc, but now he wants to do on-the-stove cooking.<br/>
One problem is that he&#39;s not tall enough yet, and would have to use a<br/>
step stool. But my biggest problem is that I&#39;ve known several kids older<br/>
than him that were burned badly, even with mom supervising. That scares<br/>
me to death, especially since I don&#39;t even have a way to get him to the<br/>
hospital if he should burn himself. I was really hoping to wait at least<br/>
a couple more years on the &quot;real&quot; cooking, but if I&#39;m just being paranoid<br/>
I don&#39;t want to hold him back. Thoughts?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Myranda 8-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I spent many hours with a friend in the burn unit, her son was severely<br/>
burned by a cup of hot coffee in the church nursery.  Watching the<br/>
torture he and other patients there went through gave me a keen awareness<br/>
of the dangers out there.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I&#39;ve had to weigh this fear against the benefit of<br/>
children cooking.  I think the sooner they indulge the desire to<br/>
experiment with food the more comfortable they will be with cooking their<br/>
entire lives.<br/>
<br/>
I let both kids help, Lanora (12) is adept in the kitchen but still asks<br/>
for help with things like taking things out of the oven or draining hot<br/>
liquids.  She loves deep fried tortillas but won&#39;t cook them herself, she<br/>
is leery of the hot oil.  Jonathan (4) helps and has gotten tiny burns<br/>
doing so in spite of my diligence, what they have accomplished is a first<br/>
hand experience I couldn&#39;t replace with words.<br/>
<br/>
I tell him that it is safer if I drain the water from the pasta but he<br/>
can put the pasta in the water.  Just this morning he accidently touched<br/>
the edge of the pot, we immediately ran cold water over the spot and he&#39;s<br/>
fine.  However, I know he would never mess with the stove or the things<br/>
cooking there because he know how fast he can get hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes reasonable risk outweighs the concerns.<br/>

Hey, I have a counter sitter here too!! Alyssa loves to be up on the <br/>
counters. First thing she says is &quot;me up there?&quot; She loves the bathroom <br/>
counters and the kitchen counters. She&#39;d sit up there all day if I let her. <br/>
Of course when I leave the room, she has to get down, which she&#39;s not fond <br/>
of. I guess it is a height thing. Of course this is also the same 2 year old <br/>
that Monday at the park climbed the S shaped ladder that is 6 feet high by <br/>
herself.<br/>
