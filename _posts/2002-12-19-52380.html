&lt;&lt;  I agree, I think what <br/>
 is going on with JP is much deeper than parenting issues.   I think Yol was <br/>
 right on the money too, and I am to the point where homeopathy sounds like a <br/>
 viable option.  I hope to be visiting Yol soon :-)    I have heard lots of <br/>
 others testify to the success of homeopathy.  I really think that his <br/>
 behavior is some &quot;unbalance&quot; of some sort.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the advice about homeopathy is great! We use homeopathic remedies <br/>
around here for illness mainly, but I would like to understand the different <br/>
remedies better so we could use them more effectively.<br/>
For issues like what you&#39;re describing, I think it will make a huge <br/>
difference.<br/>
I think kids like your ds often have sensitivities to food or a chemical <br/>
imbalance...something that makes their coping mechanisms break down quickly <br/>
under pressure.<br/>
My nephew is like this. He is very intense over happy and difficult things <br/>
alike.<br/>
His intensity can be overwhelming, but he is the most interesting, creative <br/>
little soul!!<br/>
Anyway, I hope you can find a good remedy. I bet it will really help.<br/>
