I didn&#39;t criticize your grammar, but I feel guilty<br/>
because I brought up the Grammar issue.  I wasn&#39;t sure<br/>
how a child would learn grammar on their own.  <br/>
I sent a post asking and had about 3 mistakes in the<br/>
sentence. LOL  I was corrected to , but I thought it<br/>
was all in good humor.  I think people forget to type<br/>
LOL or other little notation they use to show it is in<br/>
good humor.  When I type I do not alway have my<br/>
sentence grammatically correct. Geez I have fragments<br/>
runons and what else you can get wrong.  When I am in<br/>
groups or chats I type the sometimes the way I talk. <br/>
Sometimes I think faster than my fingers can keep up<br/>
with. Don&#39;t leave.<br/>
