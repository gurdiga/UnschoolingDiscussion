<div id="ygrps-yiv-472103062">This is just a thought I have been tossing around for a week or so now...<br/>
<br/>
I am a nurse, and work nights in a nursing home, sometimes I fill in days on <br/>
the weekends. There is a mother and her daughter who come in every morning <br/>
around 5am and don&#39;t leave until around 10 at night, to take care of the <br/>
mother&#39;s father. The granddaughter looks about 12, very small and mousy, <br/>
extremely shy, you all know the type. Much to my surprise, I found out the <br/>
girl is almost 20! She is homeschooled still, (she has no disabilities) she <br/>
told me she doesn&#39;t participate in any activities, except helping her mom <br/>
care for her grandfather. She does her school work at a table in the common <br/>
area with her mom and grandfather sitting right there.<br/>
<br/>
Now I don&#39;t want to come across a judgmental, but do any of you ever meet <br/>
families like this? Families that personify the stereotype some of us still <br/>
battle against with some of our friends and families of the unsocialized <br/>
child who never goes anywhere or does anything and has no friends? And what <br/>
are your feelings about families such as this one?<br/>
<br/>
My MIL is constantly calling with the suggestion of this activity or another. <br/>
A common phone conversation with her goes something like this: <br/>
MIL: I read in the paper/saw on XYZ program that homeschooled children fall <br/>
behind in social skills...Blah blah blah... thank goodness you sent Jack to <br/>
school... how is Moly doing with her &quot;Little school&quot;....shouldn&#39;t you send <br/>
her with Jack too?<br/>
ME:  Thanks for the suggestions. I&#39;ll keep it in mind, do you want to talk to <br/>
Darin? <br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t worry about my kids socialization. Because mine are the type that if <br/>
there is nothing going on, (no music lessons to go to, or soccer or softball <br/>
or bowling teams practicing that day) they will inevitably find some <br/>
neighborhood child to play with, or some activity they want to go to at the <br/>
local community center. They are just very outgoing, friendly children who <br/>
will never lack for &quot;social skills&quot;  They could find friends in the backwoods <br/>
of Alaska.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my question is this, do any of you ever run across that odd family <br/>
who&#39;s children truly are unsocialized, and what are your feelings about that, <br/>
and what do you feel the impact on the rest of the homeschooling community <br/>
is? (homeschooling community as a whole, not just unschoolers) Or is this <br/>
just a non-issue for some of you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783716506">Addendum to my last post:<br/>
Do any of you ever notice how some folks equate social skills with having <br/>
friends? What I mean here is that sometimes people say &quot;What about social <br/>
skills?&quot; and immediately follow up with &quot;Don&#39;t you worry your kids won&#39;t have <br/>
any friends?&quot;  To me, having friends and social skills are two different <br/>
things. I know lots of folks who have really crappy social skills, but still <br/>
have friends, and I know others who have great social skills and no friends. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve met and talked to loads of homeschoolers and people who knew <br/>
homeschoolers.  I only ever met one person for whom I thought there <br/>
needed to be &quot;something done&quot; for the child.  In that case, I had <br/>
contact with an aunt by (recent) marriage who came to me for advice.  <br/>
The mother of the 12 year old girl was agoraphobic and never left her <br/>
house.  The reason she homeschooled was that her agoraphobia extended <br/>
itself to fear of her daughter leaving the house too.  The child <br/>
seemed miserable to the aunt.  My advice to her, was to try to get <br/>
close to the girl and see if together they could persuade the mom to <br/>
either seek treatment for herself or at the very least let the aunt <br/>
take the girl out sometimes.  It was IMHO a very precarious <br/>
situation.  I suspect CPS would have removed the girl had there been <br/>
a report filed, but I suspect that would have made the situation <br/>
worse.<br/>
Unfortunately, I lost contact with the aunt, so I don&#39;t know how it <br/>
all turned out.  The last I heard, her efforts to befriend them both <br/>
were looking pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I think a good rule of thumb is: Are the kids happy?  I too <br/>
have one who was a little less than talkative.  She is coming out of <br/>
her shell now though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can remember quite a few families that public or private school and <br/>
the kids don&#39;t socialize. Or worse, they don&#39;t associate with people <br/>
outside their culture.<br/>
<br/>
In the last place I worked full-time, the owner of the company had two <br/>
sisters and one brother. Everyone was over 40. Only one of the sisters <br/>
was married and had &#39;friends&#39;. The other three still lived at home with <br/>
mother and father. None of them really had any friends outside <br/>
eachother. All were public schooled. (Two of them never even been on a <br/>
date!)<br/>
<br/>
So, what I&#39;m experiencing is that the social thing isn&#39;t a product of <br/>
the school thing. These are two seperate issues.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This spurns in me prolly the ONLY concern I have with our home/<br/>
unschooling. My son is very outgoing and friendly. He makes <br/>
acquaintences whenever we go out.<br/>
<br/>
He has no siblings. And I find that age interaction and conversation is <br/>
one of the best ways to learn.<br/>
<br/>
When we were on the left coast, he was in a democratic school and had <br/>
conversation all day long with lots of other children. (I remember the <br/>
day he came home talking about his 10yo friend being &#39;Pissed Off&#39;. He <br/>
sat in the hallway talking until he finally exclaimed &#39;I got it!!! <br/>
Pissed Off has nothing to do with taking a piss.) [sorry for the <br/>
crudeness, its is the gist of the story] But I thought it was great.<br/>
<br/>
Now were on the other coast, in an area that isn&#39;t as safe and free to <br/>
let him roam up and down the block and the people we meet when we go <br/>
out isn&#39;t the same as being in an atmosphere of 5-10-15 kids of various <br/>
ages all having conversation throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
The karate, the basketball and the gymnastics don&#39;t seem to have the <br/>
same thing as days of just talking with other children.<br/>
<br/>
He tells me that he misses that atmosphere. As of now, I can&#39;t <br/>
duplicate it.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions anyone?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Couldn&#39;t let this one pass without comment. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know people have preconceptions, but I&#39;ve found some of the most <br/>
awesome socialization I&#39;ve ever seen in those so-called backwoods of <br/>
Alaska. Out there where cabins can be few and far between I&#39;ve been <br/>
privvy to a culture where people still care about each other, still <br/>
take soup to their sick neighbors, still gather for holidays, still <br/>
check to see if anyone needs anything before they head off to town - <br/>
because town might be a hundred miles away or more and involve a <br/>
major expedition. If there was ever a place where it&#39;s easy as pie to <br/>
find friends, it&#39;s those backwoods of Alaska.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m leaving for there this evening, and can&#39;t wait to get back and <br/>
visit friends I made when living in those backwoods 35 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
But I appreciated your post nonetheless, and have appreciated the <br/>
good replies it generated.<br/>

On a personal level, I have one extroverted kid and one introverted. <br/>
IMO, any outsider would say &#39;my, what a great socialized kid the <br/>
extroverted one is&#39; and the comments about the introvert would be <br/>
quite the opposite. They (the critics or outsiders) don&#39;t know enough <br/>
about our situation to judge either nor should they form an opinion <br/>
about homeschooling based on either single child. <br/>
I think lots of folks who are ignorant and against  homeschooling <br/>
will look for the odd, the peculiar and point to that child and say, <br/>
&quot;see?! I told you so. Those homeschoolers are an ODD bunch!&quot;.<br/>
Their problem, not mine.<br/>
