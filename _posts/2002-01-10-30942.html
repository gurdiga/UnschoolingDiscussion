&gt;Hello Faith,<br/>
&gt;glad you found the list... we need more teen parents here :-).<br/>
&gt;I have a 15 yr old daughter and there are several others here with teens <br/>
&gt;(boys and girls).<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;m not sure of your question, so I&#39;ll restate what you said how I <br/>
&gt;interpreted it.<br/>
&gt;You dd is not happy at school & isn&#39;t thriving in that environment.<br/>
&gt;You have taken her out but don&#39;t know what to do next.<br/>
&gt;Do you know what your local laws are that you would fall under? (do you <br/>
&gt;have to sign up with a charter school? do you have to test her annually?.. <br/>
&gt;.that sort of thing).<br/>
&gt;There are plenty of places to gather that type of information and I&#39;m sure <br/>
&gt;some can provide links for you. If you are thinking along the lines of <br/>
&gt;changing your whole outlook on learning and the goals your teen has, this <br/>
&gt;would be the place to hang out and ask questions.<br/>
&gt;Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;Sarah<br/>

&gt;   Hello....someone told me about this list. I&#39;m from Ontario, Canada. I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;   sure if some of you have teenagers also out of school or if this list is <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;   younger kids out of school, but I have a fifteen yr. old daughter whom <br/>
&gt;does<br/>
&gt;   not do well in the highschool system and has been leaving because<br/>
&gt;   emotionally she seems to not be coping, lots of circumstances of <br/>
&gt;violence<br/>
&gt;   from students and the toleration of it.. ..she is afraid to go, yet she <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;   not sixteen yet . Can anyone offer any substitute programs as the school <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;   not offering me much help. Kind of at my wits end. thankyou all  Faith<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238575723">Wow, Faith.. you&#39;re in between a rock and a hard place.:(<br/>
It is *never* too late to start unschooling and even though that isn&#39;t what<br/>
you&#39;ve initially started out to find, that is where you are!<br/>
Once you have gone over the legal requirements and know your options, you<br/>
may want to consider the bigger picture and that is that learning is a<br/>
life-long process and something that won&#39;t end at any particular age. With<br/>
that in mind, it might be helpful to quickly read up on what other kids have<br/>
done (I&#39;d suggest Real Lives by Grace Lewellyn once again &lt;g&gt;). From there,<br/>
you can talk with your daughter about how her education is just that...<br/>
*her* choices and responsibility and find out what she is interested in. If<br/>
she&#39;s been in a school setting all this time, she might not have any idea<br/>
what she&#39;s passionate about.<br/>
I guess the main thing is that you need to try to meet your legal<br/>
requirements (imo) yet not just purchase some curriculum recommended to you<br/>
and have her plow through it. It sounds like she&#39;s a bright girl so trust<br/>
her to make some choices about what she wants to study and go from there...<br/>
