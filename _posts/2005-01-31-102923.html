Your statement doesn&#39;t quite qualify for my collection (which might be a <br/>

one of your lists!  : )  I&#39;m a work in progress.  I appreciate your <br/>
comments greatly.<br/>

&quot;yeah, now get off my back!&quot; (with a smile on his face).  He&#39;s such a <br/>
sweety.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh man!  I didn&#39;t know I was going to have to do math today!  How <br/>
ironic that it came from an unschooling veteran.  heehee  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
make my son answer it!    He pretty much does what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to stop counting.  That will be tough to do until I figure a <br/>
way around the whole &quot;logging hours&quot; issue<br/>
