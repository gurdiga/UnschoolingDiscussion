<div id="ygrps-yiv-162575287">My kids, dd-15 and ds-12, like to stay up until 11:00 p.m. or <br/>
midnight, and sleep until 9:00 a.m. or later.  This is fine, and I&#39;m <br/>
just glad they&#39;re getting enough sleep.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that I wake up early in the morning, between 5:00 <br/>
a.m. and 6:00 a.m., and I need to go to sleep by 10:00 p.m., <br/>
sometimes as early as 9:00 p.m. if we&#39;ve had a really physically <br/>
active day.<br/>
<br/>
Many times dd-R. and ds-R. want to start games or discussions, or <br/>
start watching a movie together (meaning with *me*) at 9:00 p.m., <br/>
and I have such trouble concentrating.  It disappoints them and me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve explained my sleep needs to R. and R., and I&#39;ve asked that we <br/>
schedule stuff for earlier in the evening, but it seems that they <br/>
have a burst of energy right around 9:00 p.m., just as my energy is <br/>
sputtering to a stop.<br/>
<br/>
I have the most energy early in the morning and throughout the <br/>
morning, and my kids have the opposite.  Has anyone else experienced <br/>
this?  How did you resolve it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77072125">My kids both go to bed a lot later than I do.  I am<br/>
ready to hit the hay at 10-11, and my 6 yo is at least<br/>
midnight, and my 12 yo is 2-3am.  We just try to find<br/>
time during the day when all of us are awake and can<br/>
do something together.  Yesterday my 12 yo didn&#39;t get<br/>
up until 1:30-2 in the afternoon, and then we had to<br/>
go to the chiropractor and the store, but when we got<br/>
home we had time to read together :)  TODAY, though,<br/>
we are headed out to a homeschool rollerskating day,<br/>
and she has already popped her head out--and before 9<br/>
am!!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so similar to my situation.  My dd (15) stays up until 1:00 a.m. or <br/>
so reading and then gets up at 10 or 11 a.m.  My ds (11) stays up until 12:00 <br/>
usually and gets up a bit earlier around 9:30.  I&#39;m ready for bed at 10:00.  If <br/>
I&#39;m up at 11:00 p.m. they think its weird.  <br/>
<br/>
For us, we just know that our time is during the day.  I&#39;m available from <br/>
when they get up through early evening for pretty much anything they want.  I <br/>
take them places, <br/>
we watch our favorite shows, we play games etc.  If I do stay up late we <br/>
sometimes all watch a movie or play a game together.  Mornings I have my time to <br/>
work out or get on the computer before they get up.  It&#39;s been a gradual <br/>
process but it seems to be working out for everyone.  I get my rest and they have <br/>
the evenings to do other things that interest them.  I do miss some things but <br/>
they understand I&#39;m in a much better frame of mind the next day if I&#39;ve had the <br/>
sleep I need.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we&#39;ll watch a movie the next day that they have already seen the <br/>
night before.  They like watching it again and we still have time together just <br/>
not those late nights! My husband often stays up late with them if he&#39;s not <br/>
out of town on business.<br/>
He&#39;s one of those people who only needs 5 or 6  hours of sleep.  I need my <br/>
9!!!  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205469372">My son, Hayen (6) has taught me a whole new meaning to &quot;night owl&quot;  - <br/>
both dh and myself have never adapted well to *normal* hours, so we <br/>
anticipated we&#39;d have kids like us... Hayden LOVES staying up late, all <br/>
night sometimes.  For a while (about a month) he would ask me at 1 am, <br/>
as I was trooping off to bed, to watch a movie with him.  Every single <br/>
day, I found myself saying the exact same thing, &quot;every single day you <br/>
wait until I&#39;m going to bed to ask me to watch a movie, tomorrow ask me <br/>
at 9&quot; and not very nicely, either :&#39;( Then I realized he&#39;s only 6 and he <br/>
asks me when I&#39;m ready for bed because that&#39;s when I seek him out and he <br/>
has my, even momentary, attention.  So one day I sought HIM out at 11, <br/>
told him we&#39;d watch a movie together THEN I&#39;d go in my own bed.  What a <br/>
happy compromise!  I&#39;ve not said that line again, he&#39;s not had to be sad <br/>
and missing his mama, and we get some time together.  Hannah (8) is <br/>
happy to fall asleep between 10-11 and get up around 9 am; it&#39;s a sign <br/>
of their love when she is staying up really late with him [lately it&#39;s <br/>
been to do christmas letters while I&#39;m not around] and truly enjoying it. <br/>
Last night, I pooped out at 12:30 and began &quot;closing up&quot; by turning off <br/>
extra lights, blowing out candles, etc... Hannah asked to have the <br/>
lights ON and as I breathed in for my speil, she stopped me by offering <br/>
to take care of the lights herself.  They both came upstairs a few <br/>
minutes later, I heard all the lights turning off, they closed my <br/>
bedroom door and their own... Hannah came in to sleep with me an hour <br/>
later and it looks like Hayden fell asleep to Looney Tunes, Back in <br/>
Action &lt;bg&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953820324">I have experienced this...I&#39;m quite convinced I&#39;m the only morning person in<br/>
the house!  My boys usually head up to bed around 10:00....which is when I&#39;m<br/>
usually ready!!  My body wakes up between 6:30 and 7:00 every morning<br/>
regardless of when I go to bed!  And I have never been able to nap well.  I<br/>
just don&#39;t function well much past 10:00....and would love a 9:00 bedtime.<br/>
My girls are never in bed before 12:00, often even later....my husband is<br/>
also a night-owl who is forced to get up for work in the morning....he can<br/>
get by on less sleep than I can.  What we have done is compromise, they know<br/>
my wake/sleep cycle is just as natural for me as theirs is for them.  I will<br/>
try to stay up later for them, thus I get to bed between 10:00 and 11:00<br/>
most nights and the kids will try to be awake by noon so we can all be awake<br/>
together.  They don&#39;t expect me to engage in activities that require thought<br/>
or energy at night and I don&#39;t expect them to be up at 7:00 with me ready to<br/>
start the day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
I often use a yogurt starter called Yogourmet that I found at a <br/>
nearby health food store.  But you really don&#39;t need a starter <br/>
culture or a machine.  You can easily make your own yogurt using a <br/>
commercial brand yogurt as a starter.  I&#39;ve done this, and it makes <br/>
a fine yogurt, but a little on the thin side.  I use the recipe and <br/>
instructions from &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Living&quot; by Carla <br/>
Emery.<br/>
<br/>
Start by pasteurizing one quart milk by heating it to 150 F-<br/>
degrees.  Cool milk to 110 F-degrees.  I use organic whole milk.  If <br/>
you like really thick yogurt (the pudding-like kind), add about 1/4 <br/>
cup of powdered milk to the quart milk and mix well before heating.<br/>
<br/>
If you start from store-bought yogurt, make it an unflavored, <br/>
additive-free one.  Stoneyfield Farms is a good organic one, but <br/>
some people swear that Dannon unflavored makes the best yogurt <br/>
starter.  Once the milk has cooled to 110F, add 2 tablespoons of <br/>
yogurt to the milk.  Stir gently and completely, but don&#39;t whisk.  <br/>
Pour the mix into small, clean jars and cover loosely.  I use old <br/>
glass peanut butter jars because they have nice wide mouths.  Set <br/>
the jars in a warm place for several hours.  The mix needs to be <br/>
kept warm, as close to the 110F as possible.  An oven set at 150 <br/>
degrees, or an insulated cooler with a heating pad inside with the <br/>
jars will do fine.  Try not to jostle or move the jars while the mix <br/>
is setting.  Once it&#39;s cultured, refridgerate for about 12 hours, <br/>
and it&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>
Save about 1/4 cup of your first batch, and keep it sealed <br/>
separately in the refridgerator.  You want to keep it as fresh as <br/>
possible, because it will be the starter for your next batch.  But <br/>
you should really use it within a week.<br/>
<br/>
We use a LOT of yogurt, and this has saved me a lot of money.  Once <br/>
the yogurt is done, I add some honey to the yogurt I&#39;ll be using for <br/>
fruit smoothies.  The other yogurt I leave plain, and I use that in <br/>
baking and cooking.  I buy all-fruit butters from a local supplier, <br/>
and my kids add whatever flavor they want to their yogurt.<br/>
<br/>
My goodness, this got long.  I hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>

  Hi Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
  I often use a yogurt starter called Yogourmet that I found at a <br/>
  nearby health food store.  But you really don&#39;t need a starter <br/>
  culture or a machine.  You can easily make your own yogurt using a <br/>
  commercial brand yogurt as a starter.  I&#39;ve done this, and it makes <br/>
  a fine yogurt, but a little on the thin side.  I use the recipe and <br/>
  instructions from &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Living&quot; by Carla <br/>
  Emery.<br/>
<br/>
  Start by pasteurizing one quart milk by heating it to 150 F-<br/>
  degrees.  Cool milk to 110 F-degrees.  I use organic whole milk.  If <br/>
  you like really thick yogurt (the pudding-like kind), add about 1/4 <br/>
  cup of powdered milk to the quart milk and mix well before heating.<br/>
<br/>
  If you start from store-bought yogurt, make it an unflavored, <br/>
  additive-free one.  Stoneyfield Farms is a good organic one, but <br/>
  some people swear that Dannon unflavored makes the best yogurt <br/>
  starter.  Once the milk has cooled to 110F, add 2 tablespoons of <br/>
  yogurt to the milk.  Stir gently and completely, but don&#39;t whisk.  <br/>
  Pour the mix into small, clean jars and cover loosely.  I use old <br/>
  glass peanut butter jars because they have nice wide mouths.  Set <br/>
  the jars in a warm place for several hours.  The mix needs to be <br/>
  kept warm, as close to the 110F as possible.  An oven set at 150 <br/>
  degrees, or an insulated cooler with a heating pad inside with the <br/>
  jars will do fine.  Try not to jostle or move the jars while the mix <br/>
  is setting.  Once it&#39;s cultured, refridgerate for about 12 hours, <br/>
  and it&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>
  Save about 1/4 cup of your first batch, and keep it sealed <br/>
  separately in the refridgerator.  You want to keep it as fresh as <br/>
  possible, because it will be the starter for your next batch.  But <br/>
  you should really use it within a week.<br/>
<br/>
  We use a LOT of yogurt, and this has saved me a lot of money.  Once <br/>
  the yogurt is done, I add some honey to the yogurt I&#39;ll be using for <br/>
  fruit smoothies.  The other yogurt I leave plain, and I use that in <br/>
  baking and cooking.  I buy all-fruit butters from a local supplier, <br/>
  and my kids add whatever flavor they want to their yogurt.<br/>
<br/>
  My goodness, this got long.  I hope this helps.<br/>
