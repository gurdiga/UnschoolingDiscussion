<h4>The Mowery Family</h4>
<time>13 Mar 2000, at  2:11am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-625397824">&lt;&lt;What I mean ... is that I don&#39;t know if I want to spend that much time<br/>
with<br/>
them, but if not, why not, and I think it&#39;s societal conditioning against<br/>
being with one&#39;s children, I hope you all understand cos I don&#39;t know how<br/>
clear I&#39;m being...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of the social conditioning against moms spending lots of times<br/>
with kids came from Freud.  And he was wrong about a lot of things.  Let&#39;s<br/>
re-examine this idea of his and get rid of it if it&#39;s not valid.<br/>

I know, this may sound stupid, but I never thought about Freud.  The power<br/>
of that man&#39;s thoughts has loomed over generations.<br/>
<br/>
Was it good?  Was it bad?  I don&#39;t know, but he sure did affect the thought<br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
