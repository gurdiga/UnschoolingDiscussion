<br/>
Lots of people.  I&#39;ve been collecting stories of how children learn to read on their own for years.<br/>

-=Laura is energetic, loud and happy. She has an excellent memory and<br/>
doesn&#39;t miss a thing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t risk marring that by pressing her to read, and making her feel deficient, or &quot;disabled.&quot;<br/>

Advantages Discovered from Later Reading<br/>

<br/>
Schools want children to read early.  Too early.  We could discuss the reasons, but you can probably figure them out.  And it&#39;s not worth doing.  But school creates failures.  MANY, many (many) failures.  And school creates &quot;non-readers.&quot;<br/>

There are things on reading on Joyce&#39;s page, too., linked down the left side.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039122962">***My mother-in-law believe that Laura has a Reading disability. She also<br/>
believe that Laura memorizes books and guesses at what she reads. She<br/>
says that she sees other kids enjoying reading signs out loud. For Laura<br/>
it is obvious that reading is painful.***<br/>
<br/>
Has your mother-in-law ever been in a classroom of 7 yr olds reading aloud?  It <br/>
IS painful and forced.  Only a few kids can do it well, and even fewer can do it <br/>
under pressure.  I don&#39;t even remember reading aloud in the classroom until I <br/>
was about 9 or 10.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is painful for any kid that is being forced to read and simply can&#39;t <br/>
yet.  The kids that can&#39;t, and there are LOTS, in school are put in special <br/>
reading programs and caused to feel stupid and inferior for it.  If she&#39;s <br/>
reading some things and enjoying it, she&#39;s way ahead of about half of the kids <br/>
that are in school that are of the same age.  That age, 7 and 8, reading is <br/>
highly enforced because once kids hit the 8 yr range, at least in the US, they <br/>
use primarily reading as a form of education.  It&#39;s efficient to make sure that <br/>
all the kids can read on their own to make the classroom run better with the <br/>
least amount of individual attention.  <br/>
<br/>
Since she&#39;s not in school, she can have all the individual attention she needs <br/>
and requires to learn what she needs to learn.  She&#39;ll have a better <br/>
understanding of reading once she is there and her mind is ready to read.  It&#39;s <br/>
not something that can be forced.  It can be faked by kids in schools through <br/>
memorization and repetition, but the kid still won&#39;t get it before he gets it.<br/>

Some kids (and adult learners for that matter, I used to work in adult literacy) learn by memorizing words, sentences, whole books (or brochures or employment and tax forms) and then re-reading what they&#39;ve memorized to build up a sense of confidence in what they know before moving on. <br/>
<br/>
Guessing from context cues is a Good thing - but in schools its asigned to the &quot;reading for comprehension&quot; lessons, as if understanding is somehow separate from reading, so parents (and teachers) can get the idea that guessing is bad while sounding out without comprehension is fine. That&#39;s a little backwards! but that&#39;s how schools teach reading. It isn&#39;t necessarily how people Learn to read, though. <br/>

If you think your husband would be amenable to doing some reading of his own, I&#39;d get something like Much More than Just the ABCs or Literacy Through Play - both of which describe different paths to literacy and why its Not a good idea to either push &quot;sounding out&quot; or be fussy about correcting children when they &quot;mis-read&quot; something (the short answer is that if they care about what they&#39;re reading, they&#39;ll notice and either ask or self-correct). They&#39;re both books derived from research in open classrooms which makes much of the information applicable to unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131097648">There is also the Moore&#39;s Better Late Than Early books and philosophy that<br/>
is also supported by research.  Though they are also fairly religious in<br/>
context and since their deaths the Moore Foundation seems to have morphed<br/>
into a marketing group. The information, while not about unschooling, has<br/>
some interesting points and definitely gives sound arguments against forced<br/>
education.<br/>
