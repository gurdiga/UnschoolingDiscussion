<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t get this one.  The movies are designed for entertainment, <br/>
<br/>
not for historical accuracy.  That&#39;s obvious enough. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Historical fiction is often inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
NON-fiction is often inaccurate.<br/>

Michael Moore admits Disney &#39;ban&#39; was a stunt <br/>
<br/>
07.05.2004<br/>
By ANDREW GUMBEL in Los Angeles <br/>
<br/>
Less than 24 hours after accusing the Walt Disney Company of pulling the plug <br/>
on his latest documentary in a blata attempt at political censorship, the <br/>
rabble-rousing film-maker Michael Moore has admitted he knew a <br/>
Zyear ago that Disney had no intention of distributing it. <br/>
<br/>
The admission, during an interview with CNN, undermined Moore&#39;s claim that <br/>
Disney was trying to sabotage the US release of Fahrenheit 911 just days before <br/>
its world premiere at the Cannes film festival. <br/>
<br/>
Instead, it lent credence to a growing suspicion that Moore was manufacturing <br/>
a controversy to help publicise the film, a full-bore attack on the Bush <br/>
administration and its handling of national security since the attacks of 11 <br/>
September 2001. <br/>
<br/>
In an indignant letter to his supporters, Moore said he had learnt only on <br/>
Monday that Disney had put the kibosh on distributing the film, which has been <br/>
financed by the semi-independent Disney subsidiary Miramax. <br/>
<br/>
But in the CNN interview he said: &quot;Almost a year ago, after we&#39;d started <br/>
making the film, the chairman of Disney, Michael Eisner, told my agent he was <br/>
upset Miramax had made the film and he will not distribute it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Nobody in Hollywood doubts Fahrenheit 911 will find a US distributor. His <br/>
last documentary, Bowling for Columbine, made for US$3m pulled in US$22m at the <br/>
US box office. <br/>
<br/>
But Moore&#39;s publicity stunt, if that is what is, appears to be working. <br/>
<br/>
A front-page news piece in The New York Times was followed yesterday by an <br/>
editorial denouncing Disney for censorship and denial of Moore&#39;s right to free <br/>
expression. <br/>
<br/>
Moore told CNN that Disney had &quot;signed a contract to distribute this [film]&quot; <br/>
but got cold feet. But Disney executives insists there was never any contract. <br/>
And a source close to Miramax said that the only deal there was for <br/>
financing, not for distribution.</div>

[Sondra replies:] Actually - I&#39;m an artist - so I approach this from the<br/>
perspective of someone who actually would have to give up royalties - but<br/>
I&#39;m looking at a bigger picture and to be honest, for a long time (probably<br/>
because I DID have a vested interest like that) I couldn&#39;t see how much this<br/>
really hurts us - artists and laymen as a whole. But as an artist - or<br/>
thinker, writer, etc. - it&#39;s important that we see how too much copyright<br/>
protection actually hurts our ability to exchange ideas in the fluid way<br/>
needed for progress. I&#39;m not advocating no copyright protection - just sane<br/>
protection that helps those who have ideas and also continues the long<br/>
tradition we have had of allowing free exchange by relatively quickly making<br/>
ideas public domain. That doesn&#39;t take away the original artist&#39;s ability to<br/>
market his ideas - it just takes the exclusivity away. And as I said - I<br/>
would stand to lose that exclusivity myself as an artist - but I would gain<br/>
so much more by being able to tap that great conversation. <br/>

[Sondra replies:] This could well be - I wouldn&#39;t put it past Moore. I<br/>
haven&#39;t researched this - I was just offering it as one of the reasons<br/>
people feel they should boycott. I&#39;d have to research both sides of that<br/>
issue to really find what I believe. I&#39;d no more believe Disney reps than I<br/>
would believe Moore. They both has some heavy vested interest. <br/>

==========<br/>
<br/>
If people have bad reasons, then they should NOT boycott.<br/>
<br/>
They should spend that furious energy learning to research things before they <br/>
made decisions.  It&#39;s good for their families and for their kids and for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it&#39;s legal for homeschooling families to base their beliefs and <br/>
&quot;curriculum&quot; and all on whatever they want to.  Fundamental Christian homscholing <br/>
curriculae have set that precedent by using skewed history and very <br/>
questionable &quot;science.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hate to see liberals do anything even faintly resembling tht, but some do.  <br/>
Some people will get their information from e-mail chain letters and such <br/>
places, and not bother to check the sources for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Its not the best path to productive, flowing unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327426631">The only people I knew about in the past that boycotted Disney were  <br/>
fundamental Christians,...something to do with Disneyworld having a &quot;Gay  <br/>
Day&quot;....which they were never behind.  It was just a day that large groups  of homosexuals <br/>
and lesbians agreed to meet at Disneyworld and spend the day  there.  Disney <br/>
was never a &quot;sponsor&quot; of the event.  (They are very  fair, though, from what I <br/>
understand, about hiring Gays and Lesbians.)<br/>
 <br/>
I know that Disney employs many, MANY artists, musicians, actors...it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense to me to boycott them if you care about the  arts <br/>
and folks actually making a living with their trade.  <br/>
 <br/>
Lastly (and I&#39;m sorry if this sounds like I&#39;m a Disney cheerleader :o) I  <br/>
heard once on Paul Harvey&#39;s show (you know, &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot;) a long, sad  <br/>
story about a boy and his brother who were pretty badly abused, mentally and  <br/>
physically...locked in their basement for bad behavior, etc.  Turns out it  <br/>
was Walt Disney and his brother.  I know that his opening of Disneyland in  the <br/>
50&#39;s was because he wanted a wonderful, fantasy type place different  from <br/>
regular &quot;thrill&quot; type amusement parks...something more family friendly for  <br/>
people with young and older children.  Maybe it had to do with wanting to  <br/>
recapture his lost childhood...who knows....<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not starry eyed about the Disney Empire...believe me...I just think  <br/>
there are so many more &quot;evil empires&quot; out there...Disney is WAY towards the  <br/>
bottom of the list, if on the list at all....JMO<br/>

Worse, people don&#39;t know what parts are true and what&#39;s nonsense, so <br/>
everything is suspect.   They turn truth to turds.<br/>
