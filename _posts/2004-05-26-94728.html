<div id="ygrps-yiv-254939384">Hi, I am a few weeks new to navigating this site and have been mostly <br/>
confused as to how exactly to get around.  Alas, I fear not...I am as <br/>
new to unschooling and just as scared yet I am moving forward with my <br/>
fingers crossed and my intuitive ear pressed firmly to my childs <br/>
chest!  My 10 yo son came home to &quot;BE&quot; after attending a Waldorf <br/>
school since kindergarten. Although his coming home was a reaction to <br/>
a long overdue decision to finally let him be who He came here to <br/>
become..not who I or his father or even the well-intended teachers of <br/>
his school would have him be.  It was like my head all of a sudden <br/>
came bursting though the clouds that had surrounded my best intuitive <br/>
knowing about this child who came to me/us.  There was no turning my <br/>
back on this knowledge once I fully understood what was being asked <br/>
of me.  I was to bring my son home and allow him the opportunities to <br/>
grow and strive and succeed and falter and guess and know and not <br/>
know...to fully become who he decides to become!  As a mother who is <br/>
limited only by her humanness, I began schooling the way he and I <br/>
thought he&#39;d like it...it looked like school, but not like a Waldorf <br/>
school.  That was nice and it lasted a month or so, just until the <br/>
newness wore off.  Then I struggled and pressed him and fear welled <br/>
up in me about the unknowns and the what if&#39;s about his future.  He <br/>
fought back against my oppessive tendencies and reminded me on a <br/>
daily basis that I was turning into the teacher who&#39;d we just <br/>
released him from and he was hurting.  I stopped cold in my tracks <br/>
because I really heard him, I really saw his wounded boy spirit--I <br/>
wept alot that couple of weeks...<br/>
What I am so utterly grateful for is my intuitive nature and my quick <br/>
turn arounds...which have led me to find &quot;unschooling.&quot;  This feels <br/>
like all the &quot;rights&quot; that I&#39;ve felt with my son-from conception to <br/>
home-birthing, to not vaccinating, to homeopathy, to Waldorf (while <br/>
it held him and nurtured) and now to feel this newest path of seeking <br/>
and believing he will lead his own unique way to knowledge. <br/>
Unschooling is the YES in our lives today--thank you for being here <br/>
when I needed to find the defintion of my feelings.</div>
