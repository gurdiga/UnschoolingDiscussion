 I also see a much easier way out for me with this Fl. law.<br/>
 I have my babies at home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here Elissa!!<br/>
<br/>
Actually though, this legislation is being over reacted to.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary or good, so if people want to fight it, more <br/>
power to them.<br/>
I don&#39;t see how in the world (if you really think this through) the state can <br/>
follow every baby born until they are nine. There isn&#39;t the man power for it.<br/>
And usually these things ARE offered (as better for you of course) and you <br/>
can simply refuse them.<br/>
If I can refuse immunizations, I can&#39;t refuse social worker tracking of my <br/>
infant? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
