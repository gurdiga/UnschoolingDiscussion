<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883596012">I finally had to check this out - going to google search as you suggested!!  What I learned :  no one really knows & there are a lot of &quot;reasons&quot; people give for this trend.  So - I would go with this:  if my dd said that was why it was being done - I would believe her & believe that is what is going on in my area.  However, if I lived somewhere else, I don&#39;t think I would just believe this to be the case.<br/>
I have to agree with one statement that I read; if it is done to show drug dealers/gangs etc.....they are letting everyone know where they are - including the authorities!<br/>

I&#39;ve seen shoes on power lines since before I had children.<br/>
<br/>
If one of my children asserted that it meant something, I&#39;d ask why he <br/>
thought so.  If he heard it from another person, I&#39;d ask why he thought that person <br/>
knew.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah?<br/>
Do different gangs use different colored shoes?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you think gang members have better things to do than hang shoes on <br/>
power lines?<br/>
Don&#39;t you think crack houses and meth labs would prefer NOT to hang out a <br/>
marker?<br/>

I don&#39;t know what drug/gang people have time to do or not to do. Most people find the time to do whatever it is they want to do. I think they would be smart enough to not hang out a marker/sign whatever - but then again if they are in a gang or taking dope -  who knows what they would/would not do.<br/>

&quot;Wow&quot;?<br/>

There is no one I would believe about something that sounded nonsensical and <br/>
unproveable.<br/>
<br/>
I would believe that she thought what she was saying was true.  But I would <br/>
ask her to consider her own source, and how they might know something that is <br/>
nonsensical and unproveable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t know what drug/gang people have time to do or not to do.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But can&#39;t you consider whether something makes sense?<br/>
<br/>
For me, unschooling involves examination of ideas, or theories, information, <br/>
explanations...  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do you know?&quot;  &quot;What makes you think so?&quot;  Questions like those are <br/>
worth WAY more than just believing that a little girl is privy to the plans of <br/>
some non-existent interstate drug-dealer agreements.<br/>

Sandra thinking her daughter would be willfully lying to her.<br/>
<br/>
Have you never asked friends, your spouse, or even your children, when they<br/>
made a statement that sounded strange, &quot;Really? Where did you hear that? How<br/>
do you know?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By asking a child to cite her sources, we&#39;re asking her to think for<br/>
herself, not just randomly repeat what &quot;a friend&quot; (or even her sainted<br/>
parents) have fed her.<br/>
<br/>
Such children will, I dearly hope, grow up to be finer critical thinkers and<br/>
skeptics than 98% of the folks I run into on the internet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s kind of insulting, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
And where would she have checked it out?<br/>
Did you check it out?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
Believing something unless you can prove it wrong isn&#39;t consistent with <br/>
research or critical thinking.  If Holly tells me something she herself witnessed, <br/>
I have no reason or desire to even considering proving her wrong.  She&#39;s a <br/>
reliable, thoughtful person.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly tells me something she heard that doesn&#39;t sound right or doesn&#39;t <br/>
sound like something she should be believing without really considering it or <br/>
getting other information, I&#39;ll ask her more.  I would do the same for anyone <br/>
else.  I did it here on this list today.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect anyone to believe anything I say without checking, when it&#39;s <br/>
general or historical or not about my own very personal experience.  Even then, <br/>
I&#39;ll give more details if people need them.  And as with anything else in the <br/>
world, we learn which people are good sources and which are just chat without <br/>
substance.  People who know me and know my kids probably wouldn&#39;t suspect me <br/>
of not giving Holly credit.  But I don&#39;t consider Holly a reliable source of <br/>
gang practice and policy.  And she wouldn&#39;t make a statement about something <br/>
like that without qualifying it.  &quot;Logan says,&quot; or &quot;I heard on TV,&quot; or whatever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897945220">Tagging -- gang members paint markers around their areas. Everything from simple logos to elaborate mini-murals, many with very individual info that makes it clear who put it there.  Makes it really easy for the cops to know who to arrest. That alone is enough to convince gang-bangers aren&#39;t the most clever folks you&#39;ll ever meet.  Heck, if they&#39;ll paint their name on a wall or freeway overpass, why not hang shoes if it means something to them?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve seen the shoes on a line in front of our corner mid-school, making me think it&#39;s more about adolescent pranks than anything else.  I do see gang tags around the area on a regular basis, so I know there&#39;s gang activity -- right in our favorite park after dark if the graffiti is any indication.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437945494">Given a recent SWAT situation on our street, and the gang tattoos I see on the seemingly never-ending stream of guys age 18 to late 20&#39;s who visit the house next door, I&#39;m convinced there is some gang activity.  For several months in &#39;02, they were swapping/selling fancy wheels from their front yard.  Either the then-16yo kid next door was quite the entrepreneur, or the wheels were hot (they hid the wheels under their hedge, so something was not quite right).  What with his recent jail time, I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s not the next cover of Fortune magazine.  <br/>

  Did a little online research about the &quot;sneakers over the telephone wire&quot; <br/>
issue, since I was also once told that it meant gang or drug activity. Here&#39;s <br/>
what two websites found when they did an informal survey...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148666885">Sneakers on Power Lines <br/>
Apparently it means different things to different people.<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
But if none of them are objective truth, then it was false meaning.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s crazy for signs from God.  If a crow flies in front of <br/>
his car he thinks it&#39;s a message about what he should do.<br/>
<br/>
So crows mean different things to me and him, but that doesn&#39;t mean our <br/>
interpretations are equally valid.<br/>
<br/>
I think that as parents who have taken responsibility for our children&#39;s <br/>
educations (in whatever form we choose) we should be careful to help them learn to <br/>
reason and find truth, not to just say &quot;ooh, whatever, yeah, let&#39;s act on <br/>
crow flights and shoes hanging from phone lines and rumors and e-mail chain <br/>
letters.  Don&#39;t go trick or treating because some people put needles and razor <br/>
blades in apples.  Don&#39;t read or watch Harry Potter because they&#39;ll teach you how <br/>
to do real spells,and you&#39;ll be susceptible to Satan the whole time you&#39;re <br/>
thinking about Hogwarts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wish people like that would put their kids in school where at least the <br/>
kids would have a chance to meet people who would help them learn to be <br/>
analytical.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  When I taught in Houston, most of my kids would draw in<br/>
their free time, and they usually drew that stylized lettering that is<br/>
associated with tagging.  Very few were gang wanna-be&#39;s.  Many were<br/>
from a Latino culture that was filled with dramatic, religious, and<br/>
almost-Gothic art (not sure what to call that style, exactly).  The<br/>
art they drew was important not just to them and to friends, but also<br/>
to their families.<br/>
<br/>
I came to realize that it was another one of those things that kids<br/>
see and wonder, &quot;Can I do that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And by the way, so far, I can&#39;t. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
