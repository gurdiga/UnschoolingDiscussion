<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592457264">My Mom volunteers one day a week at the ps I used to go to.  Eons ago.  She&#39;s <br/>
in a 1st grade class.<br/>
<br/>
Well, they had their class play this past Friday and she got to see it and it <br/>
was fun.  But it was at the beginning of the day.  So the whole 1st grade was <br/>
all jazzed and my Mom asked the teacher how she expected to actually get <br/>
anything done during the rest of the day with her class of 28 wound up kids.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher just turned to my Mom and said:  &quot;Let me just say that I totally <br/>
understand why your daughter homeschools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mom volunteers but brags about her hsed grandkids!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah!!<br/>

could learn French, and I showed a video on transportation from the library<br/>
(in French). He wasn&#39;t too psyched, and it felt a bit like me imposing on<br/>

I am new to hs&#39;ing so I&#39;m not sure if I can help much. But, I&#39;ve noticed this <br/>
has happened to me with my son. I just don&#39;t press the issue. I sit back and <br/>
let him lead. My son wanted to know about the human eye and asked me how deep <br/>
the pupil goes in the eye ball and I had no idea. I told him that I didn&#39;t <br/>
know but that we would go to the library and check out some books on eyes so <br/>
we could find out about it. He was real excited about it. But, when we got <br/>
the books home, he barely even looked at them even when I tried to &quot;respark&quot; <br/>
his interest in the original question. He still didn&#39;t act like he cared <br/>
about the answer. I just let it be. I didn&#39;t mention it again to him and he <br/>
hasn&#39;t brought it up. I&#39;m keeping the books layed out on the table and maybe, <br/>
in his time, he will look it up but maybe not. I&#39;m just not going to worry <br/>
about it. If anyone has any suggestions or comments. Please, I&#39;d love to hear <br/>
them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098126716">Shannon,  I also have a 3 yr old, & I can relate to what you are saying.  He <br/>
has ideas that his attention span cannot keep up with.  He  told me one day <br/>
last wk how he wanted to make a castle.  By the time I could scramble up all <br/>
the materials, he was already interested in doing something else.  Oh well, <br/>
another day and our timing will click!                                          <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385690403">Dear Shannon and Lisa and all-<br/>
<br/>
This is such a hard issue. Because, I think, we are all so excited to see our <br/>
children learning...and we can identify gifts in them that we want them to <br/>
develop.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with parents directing and <br/>
suggesting a child&#39;s interest.  But where they go with it is something I <br/>
think we can&#39;t control.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when there is something that I think my children would be good at <br/>
or interested in and my efforts fall on deaf ears, I just try to tell myself <br/>
that it might not be the right time.  And I still try to expose my child to <br/>
that interest, only as you said Shannon-in different ways.  They may sometime <br/>
pick up on it and they may not.<br/>
<br/>
It always used to scare me that I would fail to introduce my kids to <br/>
something that they would benefit from.  Now I see that it isn&#39;t possible for <br/>
me to introduce them to everything, and I don&#39;t even try.<br/>
<br/>
It amazes me to watch what comes from influences outside of me.  For example, <br/>
my 11yo just happens to take piano lessons from a farmer&#39;s wife and now is <br/>
into everything related to farming. <br/>
<br/>
Trust, trust, trust, trust, trust, trust!  I can&#39;t say it enough.  It&#39;s the <br/>
only way I ever get any peace-to trust that what comes from their innate, <br/>
insatiable appetites to learn will lead and guide them to places beyond my <br/>
wildest dreams!<br/>
<br/>
I hope this isn&#39;t too disconnected or simplistic.  It&#39; s just that as my kids <br/>
grow and I see them coming around to things that I&#39;ve tried to get them to <br/>
&quot;know or do&quot; for years&quot; and they make these &quot;discoveries&quot; on their own, the <br/>
learning is so much more amazing for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t do a lot of subtle directing and exposing my <br/>
children purposely to things I think they might like.  We&#39;re all open to <br/>
different learning at different times. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me, sometimes, to realize that a child may want only a simple <br/>
answer to a question when I want to develop it into a passion!  Remember, <br/>
these things take time and they may come at a time when we least expect.  <br/>
Trust.<br/>
<br/>
Take care-<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s 3 -- French can wait.  <br/>
<br/>
He will show an interest in this and other languages if he&#39;s exposed to them <br/>
but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s time to worry yet.  Although, as a Mom, that is your <br/>
job!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21467113">Your post has made me think....I think because we need to do less, just<br/>
trust, that is why it is so hard.  We, as humans, have a tendency to<br/>
want to make mountains out of molehills.....do too much.  So when it<br/>
comes to just sitting back, being available, and trusting, it is very<br/>
difficult.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-313289262">Hi everyone, I think for me and my DD&#39;s the answer<br/>
here lies more in introducing what &quot;they &quot; want to<br/>
learn, not what I what them to know. Although<br/>
sometimes I can sneak in something I do &quot;what&quot; them to<br/>
know! For example we watched the movie &quot;a Mother&#39;s<br/>
Gift&quot; last night. It is based on the book &quot;A lantern<br/>
in her hand&quot; {please don&#39;t quote that book title as I<br/>
am only half sure it is correct!} Anyway yesterday<br/>
afternoon my DD&#39;s made mail boxes for their rooms so<br/>
they could write letters to me and each other, so in<br/>
the letters I wrote them ,I suggested we write to each<br/>
other as if we were living in the 1860&#39;s just prior to<br/>
the Civil War. They were all for it. And I know my<br/>
DD&#39;s, they will want me to make costumes for them to<br/>
wear and we will research the food to cook and so<br/>
on.This may last a week or a month who knows? But they<br/>
will come out of this experience knowing a little more<br/>
then they did.  <br/>
