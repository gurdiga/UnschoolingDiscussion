<div id="ygrps-yiv-378002880">My parents never did the tooth fairy or the Easter Bunny - but they <br/>
did do the Santa thing.  I did get my tooth exchanged for a few <br/>
*pence* but I always knew it was my parents.<br/>
<br/>
The same with my children. we only did the Santa thing.  My kids knew <br/>
Santa only came to those who believd in him - but they also knew that <br/>
Parents bought for those who didnt believe .......<br/>
<br/>
Believing made Christmas much more majical -<br/>
