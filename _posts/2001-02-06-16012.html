<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600041984">I personally don&#39;t believe that gun laws are going to make much of a<br/>
difference, because guns are not really the problem: people/kids with<br/>
repressed rage are the problem that needs to be addressed. My nephew was<br/>
just recently taken away from his mom, my sister, because over the course of<br/>
a few years three or four times someone called Social Services on her,<br/>
saying the boy wasn&#39;t properly supervised for example when he was riding his<br/>
bike outside his house by himself at age five or six. Another time he was<br/>
dropped off after school an hour early and my sister didn&#39;t know that he<br/>
would be home early. That time the was taken by the police to foster home.<br/>
That was before Thanksgiving and she hasn&#39;t seen her son since. She has had<br/>
no support or couseling over this. Social Sevices have made no attempt at<br/>
reuniting her with her son - the focus has been completely on keeping them<br/>
apart. I wonder how my nephew is going to feel when he is a teenager when he<br/>
looks back on this episode of his life, having had no help. The neighbours,<br/>
instead of calling Social Services might have offered to help my sister look<br/>
after her son (she is a single working mom), but no who would have thought<br/>
of that!<br/>
<br/>
Guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people; rage kills people.<br/>
<br/>
My ex is an engraver of guns, hunting rifles and such. He turns an ordinairy<br/>
gun into a piece of art so beautiful, the owners don&#39;t even want to shoot<br/>
with it any more, instead they just hang it over the fireplace to look at.<br/>

Yes, but if people with rage can&#39;t get guns they can&#39;t kill with them. It <br/>
takes a lot more energy to kill some other. more physical way. -Amalia-</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063820930">That is a VERY good point. I&#39;ve said that alot before<br/>
too. I really liked my dad&#39;s pretty antique pistol,<br/>
and told him not to get rid of it. I just wish that<br/>
SOMEONE (parents mostly) would do something (like<br/>
working on that whole repressed anger thing)that would<br/>
keep guns out of hands of people who want them as an<br/>
outlet for thier anger. Does that make sense? I can&#39;t<br/>
really say that i believe a certain law or one certain<br/>
thing would do the trick, cuz it is too complicated<br/>
for that. Just like I don&#39;t think the whole abortion<br/>
issue is as simple as saying &quot;pro-life&quot; or<br/>
&quot;pro-choice&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
That is sooo sad about your sister. It nearly made me<br/>
cry. I am always so worried about things like that. <br/>
When i was little, my little sister (I think she was 3<br/>
or so) and me were jumping on our bed and she got it<br/>
in her head to jump OFF the windowsill and onto the<br/>
bed where she would sommersault. Well, she tumbled<br/>
right off he bed and hit the corner of her forehead<br/>
*SMACK* against the side of the door. She got a HUGE<br/>
purple egg sized bruise/bump and the next morning her<br/>
eyes were swollen shut. It was sooo awful looking. The<br/>
doctor said she was fine, it just looked much worse<br/>
than it was, and so we still played with our next door<br/>
neighbors and told them the whole story. But they<br/>
still felt the need to call social services on my mom,<br/>
even though we were almost never even spanked or<br/>
hardly ever even got in trouble. An officer came and<br/>
we were outside playing and I went up to him (who<br/>
knows why) and he asked me all these questions about<br/>
getting spankings and where we got them and if she hit<br/>
us in the face, etc. Then talked to my mom and she<br/>
explained and he left. whew.<br/>
Then there are kids that truly are neglected and<br/>
unwanted that nothing is ever done about to help.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that things work out so that your sister can<br/>
have her son back.<br/>
