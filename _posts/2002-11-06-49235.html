 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a great book, for anyone considering this question.  It&#39;s called <br/>
_Disaster Blasters_ by Laura Szabo Cohen and Karin Kasdin.  It&#39;s a book about <br/>
what to do if you&#39;re home alone and certain things happen, like the commode <br/>
overflows or something.  It&#39;s very funny and informative.  Some of you might <br/>
remember Laura from the old AOL boards.<br/>
<br/>
My older children where in school for 6 or 7 years and I worked full-time.  <br/>
Starting at age 10 of the oldest, they were home alone for an hour and half <br/>
every day after school (latch-key children!).  I regret that all now, even <br/>
though nothing bad ever happened.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a 9 yo now, and I wouldn&#39;t leave him home alone at 10 or 11.  But <br/>
then, he&#39;s *alone* with no siblings at all.  He has asked me to do it a lot <br/>
of times, but there&#39;s no way I would.  Maybe about 12.  Perhaps in the next <br/>
couple of years I might run up to the store and to get a paper or something, <br/>
leaving him tucked in bed or something.  But not for an extended time.<br/>
<br/>
I often leave him early in the morning, sleeping, while his teenage brother <br/>
is sleeping in the next room.  The teenager always knows I&#39;m leaving, but the <br/>
9 yo usually doesn&#39;t.  He has been known to get out of bed, turn on the TV <br/>
and settle in while I&#39;m gone and not even realize that I&#39;m gone.  Sometimes <br/>
he doesn&#39;t even know if the teenager is home.  I think he&#39;d be okay staying <br/>
home alone for an hour right now, but I&#39;m not okay with it.  I would worry <br/>
about the house burning down or something.  (He hasn&#39;t read Disaster <br/>
Blasters, yet!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re working full-time and trying to make ends meet, those fears and <br/>
worries tend to scab over and you don&#39;t feel them as strongly.  That&#39;s how I <br/>
was able to do it when my olders were young.  That&#39;s the only way I can <br/>
explain it.  I wouldn&#39;t do it now.<br/>

I often leave my 9 yo and 7 yo alone while I drop the 10 yo off for <br/>
drama or girl scouts.<br/>
How does one find out what the law is in a particular state?<br/>

    My 11 year old daughter started staying home by herself for short periods <br/>
of time at age 10  (while I went to the store or the doctor etc).  She didn&#39;t <br/>
want to stay home longer, because noises in the house would start to frighten <br/>
her.  She is getting better though.  My 14 year old was staying home for long <br/>
periods at age 12, even at night.<br/>
It didn&#39;t bother him at all, but one of my oldest, when he was 12, got <br/>
terrified at night.<br/>
One time he wanted to stay home by himself while the rest of us went out.  <br/>
When we got home, he was sitting outside with our dog.  He was so scared of <br/>
the noises in the house, and we live out in the country, so he was scared <br/>
outside as well.  He used our dog for protection.  Now he looks back at that <br/>
and laughs.  LOL<br/>
    To me it depends on the child.  When they were mature enough to take care <br/>
of themselves, I considered them ready.  But I also wanted to make sure that <br/>
being home alone didn&#39;t scare them (I remember my parents leaving me home, <br/>
when I was sick, and they went to work.  I stayed under their bed terrified <br/>
the whole time.  I don&#39;t remember my age, but I didn&#39;t want that to happen to <br/>
my kids).  Usually, I would start with small periods (run to the store for <br/>
milk etc) and then if they did ok, leave them for longer periods of time.<br/>
