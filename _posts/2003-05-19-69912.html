<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587187673">How would some of you handle their unschooling child asking about starting <br/>
college at a young age?<br/>
<br/>
Most times I think I should honor her request, other times I think it&#39;s wrong <br/>
to jump back into the classroom, for lots of reasons, then I think I am just <br/>
being selfish because we are having too much fun right now.<br/>
<br/>
Her reasons for wanting to start now are that she will be finished sooner <br/>
than later, this is the only reason she can really give me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about taking one or two classes, she&#39;s considering a full load of <br/>
classes as a good &quot;starting point&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
What would you do?  Talk about it some more?  Go ahead and register her?  Try <br/>
a compromise with maybe a partial load?<br/>
<br/>
One day she really really wants to do this and then a few days later, she <br/>
changes her mind, which is fine with me, but I&#39;m really at a loss for which <br/>
way to best help her with this choice.<br/>
<br/>
My best instincts tell me that the REAL reason she is considering this is <br/>
that some of her friends who are in school have been talking about college <br/>
and expectations and who will and will not &quot;make it&quot;.  I think it&#39;s about <br/>
proving herself and her choices more than really wanting to begin a new part <br/>
of her life&#39;s journey.<br/>
<br/>
How would you approach this as a parent?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d talk her into trying one or two classes to see how she likes it, IF it&#39;s <br/>
something she can do from home, or at a community college or something local.<br/>
<br/>
If we were in a town without any college opportunity and Kirby wanted to go <br/>
to a college town to try it, I&#39;d help him do it but would discourage him from <br/>
doing any more than 12 hours at first, because it&#39;s EASY to take more on your <br/>
plate than you can handle when you&#39;re young and looking at a college <br/>
class-catalog.<br/>
<br/>
A successful first experience could move either way, then, either &quot;That was <br/>
fun, but weird&quot; or &quot;Wow!  I can do this!&quot;   An unsuccessful first experience <br/>
could be overwhelmingly discouraging.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess that would depend on where they were thinking of going to <br/>
college, how much it would cost, what the commitment would be, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If they were talking about going to a local community college and <br/>
were maybe serious about it, they could probably dabble easily <br/>
without it being too much of a problem. But if they were talking <br/>
about applying to $40k a year Ivy League college, than I think they&#39;d <br/>
have to be a lot more serious about wanting it in order to go through <br/>
all the application and cost hoops necessary to get there. <br/>
<br/>
I think some of it would dalso epend on how much of it she was going <br/>
to cover cost-wise, how much was refundable if she decided to drop <br/>
classes, etc. I&#39;d be pretty unwilling to shuck out a lot of non-<br/>
refundable dollars if a kid wasn&#39;t pretty committed to going. But I&#39;d <br/>
be more likely to do a trial effort of a certain number of classes. <br/>
Of course, if she&#39;s paying for the whole thing, then it&#39;s really her <br/>
decision completely. <br/>
<br/>
I went to college early and for me it was a very good decision. Of <br/>
course, my parents weren&#39;t able to help me out financially, so it was <br/>
completely up to me to get scholarships set up, apply for more <br/>
scholarships, financial aid, etc. and work 2 or 3 jobs at a time to <br/>
pay for it. So it was totally my responsibility, and thus I was <br/>
pretty invested in making sure I got the most out of it. <br/>
<br/>
I think it would be a lot different if a child was expecting a parent <br/>
to pay for it.<br/>

not. Is she asking for funding or transportation from you? If so, are <br/>
you able to provide them? If providing funding or trasporation is a <br/>
basic problem, then you&#39;d probably want to discuss that and make sure <br/>
she is serious. If not, why not let her play around with it? I guess <br/>
I see unschooling as supporting my kids decisions to the best of my <br/>
ability. Sometimes, as with funding and transportation issues, that&#39;s <br/>
not possible. Then we have to figure out what will work best to meet <br/>
as many of the needs as possible. That&#39;s what I would do in this <br/>
situation.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Glena,<br/>
<br/>
My reaction or response would probably depend on my child; <br/>
specifically, her age and maturity level.<br/>
<br/>
Some community colleges will not accept students younger than 16 <br/>
years old.  How old is your daughter?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Her reasons for wanting to start now are that she will be finished <br/>
 </span></blockquote>sooner <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; than later, this is the only reason she can really give me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has she mentioned what she&#39;d like to study in college?  My dd-17 will <br/>
begin full-time at our local community college in the fall (she&#39;ll be <br/>
18 by then), and we&#39;ve been having a lot of these discussions.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not about taking one or two classes, she&#39;s considering a full <br/>
 </span></blockquote>load of &gt; classes as a good &quot;starting point&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I think checking with the local community college about their <br/>
admission requirements would be a good place to start.  My daughter <br/>
has done all the phone calls, paperwork, collecting information, etc. <br/>
necessary to gain admission.  All I did was drive her to the college <br/>
for placement testing, and write a check for a down payment.  Does <br/>
your daughter exhibit this kind of determination and motivation, or <br/>
is it more idle thinking at this point? That might give you some <br/>
insight on how badly she wants to do this.<br/>
<br/>
I would certainly encourage her to take at least one class at the <br/>
community college for the experience.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-363419">**Her reasons for wanting to start now are that she will be finished<br/>
sooner <br/>
than later, this is the only reason she can really give me.**<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Finished sooner&quot; doesn&#39;t sound like a great reason to me. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard lots of people say that they didn&#39;t know what they wanted out<br/>
of college until after they had some work experience and really<br/>
identified their career interests in the &quot;real world&quot;.  Sometimes even<br/>
people who have graduated want to &quot;change their major&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, perhaps it would be helpful to talk to various people that you and<br/>
your daughter know about their college experiences: what was useful and<br/>
what was useless and what they would do differently if they had a second chance.<br/>
<br/>
Signing up for more classes than you really want and dropping the ones<br/>
where the teachers don&#39;t excite you is a valid way to sift through<br/>
courses.  You can&#39;t always tell a good course just from the description<br/>
in the book.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would give her information about pros and cons of different<br/>
approaches to college and let her make her own decisions (subject to<br/>
your approval if you have to chauffeur her).  But mark the drop deadline<br/>
in red on *your* calendar, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All of the advice is sound but does anyone think that at 14 it would be just <br/>
a step above high school but not so far different?  Well, dramatically <br/>
different in lots of ways but still sitting in classes all day type of the <br/>
sameness.<br/>
<br/>
I think she feels the need at times to prove to some friends she is still <br/>
learning, but maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
This is a back and forth things with her these days, so I guess we&#39;ll just <br/>
see where it leads us both.<br/>
<br/>
She knows I&#39;m open to considering it.  Are there times when you think your <br/>
children might be testing you to see if for once you might just say NO?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just that she really truly doesn&#39;t know what she wants, being 14 <br/>
(nearly 15 she would add) is a great time to be indecisive I think, so many <br/>
possibilities, so many infinite things to choose from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-324057632">Maybe you and she could both work on being more clear or more &quot;solid&quot; <br/>
about what you mean. Instead of saying she wants to go to college and <br/>
then saying she doesn&#39;t, flip-flopping like that, it would be a lot <br/>
more reasonable and logical for her to be saying, &quot;I might like to take <br/>
a college class and see how I like it.&quot; She sounds like she&#39;s picked up <br/>
your habit of saying something and then saying later that she didn&#39;t <br/>
mean it.<br/>
<br/>
What is more likely is that you two have not yet really come to terms <br/>
with unschooling. You still think, to some degree, in school-like terms <br/>
- you posted, for example, about her making a cake that was a model of <br/>
a cell. That&#39;s cute, but it seemed like you thought that was somehow <br/>
more valuable than just making a cake would have been, or making a cake <br/>
that was a model of a pokemon or a teddy bear or something else, <br/>
because learning the parts of a cell is more &quot;educational.&quot; Unless it <br/>
was for a biology party or something, that mostly sounds like a sort of <br/>
contrived way of getting &quot;educational content&quot; into a daily life. Now - <br/>
I&#39;m not saying it couldn&#39;t have come up very naturally - unschooled <br/>
kids can get some wild ideas and make some very interesting connections <br/>
- &quot;Let&#39;s make a cake model of a cell,&quot; isn&#39;t impossible to imagine, <br/>
that&#39;s for sure. But I&#39;m putting together the various things you&#39;ve <br/>
posted and it seems to me that you still put greater value on things <br/>
that look most like your child is learning traditional school lessons. <br/>
You also said that she&#39;s listening to schooled friends talking about <br/>
college and stuff like that. How old is she again?<br/>
<br/>
If you want to unschool, you have to deschool. You don&#39;t seem to have <br/>
really done that yet. You&#39;ve gone from worrying about how she&#39;ll learn <br/>
the math she needs to get into college to her wanting to go to college <br/>
now, but not because she wants to go, but because she wants to be <br/>
finished with it.<br/>
<br/>
My two older girls both take college courses - they did start at 13 and <br/>
14 years old. But they were never really, &quot;going to college,&quot; the see <br/>
the college as a vast cafeteria of incredible resources to learn things <br/>
they really want to learn and filled with people who are actually paid <br/>
to be resource people - to offer them new information and ideas and <br/>
supplies and studios - such as ceramics, photography, choral groups, <br/>
and so on. They don&#39;t want to be finished - they have no concept of <br/>
being &quot;finished.&quot; They want to learn and have discovered that the local <br/>
community college offers incredible learning opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; **Her reasons for wanting to start now are that she will be finished<br/>
&gt; sooner<br/>
&gt; than later, this is the only reason she can really give me.*<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sheesh - this is sad. It sounds like she thinks it is a sentence she&#39;s <br/>
doomed to have to live out and she wants to &quot;get it over with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be a whole lot less concerned with whether she should go to college <br/>
or not - and a whole lot more concerned with why her thinking is so <br/>
unclear and muddy and why she cares so much about what other kids are <br/>
talking about, etc. After all your concern about whether she&#39;d know <br/>
enough math for college and how she wants to be a doctor and so on - <br/>
this sounds just bizarre -- if she wants to be a doctor so badly, then <br/>
why isn&#39;t she saying she wants to go to college now so that she can <br/>
hurry up and get into med school because she just can&#39;t WAIT to be a <br/>
doctor. Or something like that?<br/>
<br/>
To me, it sounds more like a kid who isn&#39;t feeling entirely comfortable <br/>
in her own life and is thinking she ought to &quot;do something&quot; more <br/>
educational than she&#39;s doing. Where is she getting that idea? How can <br/>
you help her to find and pursue her own passionate interests? How can <br/>
you help yourself and her let go of the idea that the things normally <br/>
taught in school are more educational? How can you help her not care <br/>
what her schooled friends are doing?<br/>

for various sprinkles or candies to decorate the cake with.  I really wasn&#39;t <br/>
a part of that cake baking but in the end she told me it was a &quot;cell cake&quot;, <br/>
it had licorice whips and fire balls and gum drops and she pointed out what <br/>
she had used as various things, so I guess I could see that it was indeed a <br/>
&quot;cell cake&quot;.  Personally I don&#39;t have the creativity to even come up with an <br/>
idea like a cell cake, but I thought it was great that she did and it was a <br/>
great dessert too!<br/>

&lt;Sheesh - this is sad. It sounds like she thinks it is a sentence she&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
Not at all, it just as you suggested, that once she&#39;s gotten it &quot;over with&quot; <br/>
THEN she can do what she really wants in life, become a doctor and help <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I think lots of us probably had irrational thoughts at 14 and probably a lot <br/>
of indecision and probably to some extent wanting to have our future now, at <br/>
least some days anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
College isn&#39;t anything that is a requisite for ME at all, my oldest child <br/>
went to college because she wanted to, my next oldest didn&#39;t for the same <br/>
reason, next in line has gone for a year and thinks he might not go back in <br/>
the fall.  It&#39;s whatever they choose.<br/>
<br/>
I think you give me too much credit in the decision making process of my <br/>
kids.  They are very clear that it is THEIR life they are living and not <br/>
mine, nor for me, they are very independent thinkers.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought it was unusual for a 14 (nearly 15 year old) to be tossing <br/>
back and forth the idea of college full time and wondered what others <br/>
thought.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;How can <br/>
you help yourself and her let go of the idea that the things normally <br/>
taught in school are more educational? How can you help her not care <br/>
what her schooled friends are doing?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure she thinks things learned in the classroom have more value or <br/>
are more educational, I think she is simply weighing options, dreaming of <br/>
life as a doctor, wishing it were NOW. <br/>
<br/>
Of course college comes up often especially this time of year when kids are <br/>
getting acceptance letters and holding their breaths waiting.  Tales of great <br/>
times and wonderful preparations abound.  So I think maybe it&#39;s just like a <br/>
vacation you&#39;ve planned for a long time and you keep reading and getting <br/>
brochures and your friends who&#39;ve been tell you what a great time it will be <br/>
and you just wish it were July 8th and you were there already so you&#39;d know <br/>
how great it is yourself and you were home with memories and photos and can <br/>
talk about it with others who found it so wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly it&#39;s probably just being 14 and dreaming.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your input, I&#39;ve asked myself the questions you&#39;ve asked me and <br/>
looked for answers to them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad your daughters had such wonderful experiences with college.  I have <br/>
just found out that for the local colleges they &quot;encourage&quot; students to be 16 <br/>
or older because the enrollments are so high and classes are so full.  At <br/>
this point it seems to be out of my hands anyway.<br/>

College is something adults do.  High school is not.<br/>
College is not a government lock-up facility.  High school is.<br/>
Nobody is forced to go to college by the government.  High school kids are.<br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;re really different things.<br/>
<br/>
If SHE thinks college is just new-improved high school, maybe her motives <br/>
will be impure (as to whether she wants it herself or wants others to see her <br/>
being there) but so?  If she likes it, she&#39;ll know more; if she doesn&#39;t like <br/>
it she&#39;ll know more.<br/>
<br/>
If the family can afford it and the school is accessible, I would recommend <br/>
letting it be the teen&#39;s decision and not the parents&#39;, no differently than <br/>
if it were piano lessons or ice hockey that just happened to require cash, <br/>
supplies and transportation.<br/>

this point it seems to be out of my hands anyway.<br/>

Will you use the statement of what the local college &quot;encourages&quot; to say no <br/>
then?  Is that what &quot;out of my hands&quot; means?  Many places will make <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; In what ways?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would be the same as high school in the ways that it is classroom <br/>
learning, teacher directed learning, learning from books with set lessons and <br/>
goals in mind each day.  True often you get a syllabus with everything you <br/>
are expected to learn for the entire semester but that often happens in high <br/>
school too.  This would still be like high school in the way that Cait is <br/>
able to chose on her own whether she would go or not.  High school is forced <br/>
in a way but not for all children, children who&#39;s parents agree to not let <br/>
them go there.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t at all think it&#39;s a new and improved high school.  She thinks its <br/>
a grand adventure one minute and a way to get where she wants at another <br/>
time, I think it probably can be both to her at some point, IF she wants it.<br/>
<br/>
Money isn&#39;t the issue but now it looks like rules and regulations are.  Seems <br/>
it will be impossible to consider until she is 16 anyway, so it&#39;s really not <br/>
something that is possible presently.  She&#39;s back to happily chasing a ball <br/>
with the dog while her cheer uniform is washing.<br/>
<br/>
I guess maybe she just wondered what it would be like, if it were at all <br/>
possible and what my feelings were about it, maybe just wondering for the <br/>
sake of wondering about life.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your thoughtful replies.<br/>

it would affect a lot of things, but since they don&#39;t accept students under <br/>
16, it&#39;s no longer an issue.<br/>

anyone under 16. Classes are too full.  Maybe if I knew someone or a <br/>
professor it might be different but I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of community classes if she really wanted to explore a &quot;class&quot; <br/>
but she says she doesn&#39;t right now.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said previously, some days she&#39;s perfectly happy with things as they <br/>
are (most days) but she has asked about college and occasionally expressed a <br/>
desire to be there NOW.<br/>
<br/>
As for saying yes or no... I don&#39;t really do that about anything.  If she <br/>
decides she wants to pursue this, then she can contact someone at the college <br/>
and see what if anything they will do to accommodate her at her age.  I think <br/>
if she does the contacting they might take it more seriously than a mother <br/>
who might seem like she is just pushing her child into college early.<br/>
<br/>
For now, she&#39;s seems fine with the age limitations we found out about.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you think that most 14 year olds know what they want and are sure of it <br/>
all the time?  I know that some probably do, or they are sure about <br/>
something&#39;s but might change their minds about others. (especially what they <br/>
want to WEAR or how they want their hair to look)<br/>
<br/>
Should she be saying something and sticking to it?  Should I just go along <br/>
with her saying something and then later changing her mind about it?  Should <br/>
I try to somehow persuade her to say something and stick to it?<br/>
<br/>
I might be completely wrong with thinking it&#39;s perfectly OK for a 14 year old <br/>
to say something and then changing her mind about it.  I don&#39;t want her to <br/>
think she shouldn&#39;t come to me unless her plans are etched in stone and she <br/>
isn&#39;t wavering at all about them.<br/>
<br/>
Do those of you who have young teens do this?  I thought it was part of <br/>
dreaming of the future and deciding plans and changing minds.  If she were <br/>
twenty maybe I would think she needs to be more decisive, but then maybe I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t, maybe 25?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really curious to find out other&#39;s thoughts on this.  Should I just tell <br/>
her when she&#39;s decided for sure to let me know?<br/>
<br/>
I thought if she wanted to try it then she should go ahead and see what it <br/>
was all about.  If she wasn&#39;t fully committed to it, I doubt she would last <br/>
the tedious process of interviews and registrations and all the lengthy <br/>
process it seems to be here to get into a class schedule, so she&#39;d save it <br/>
for a later time when it was worth it to her.<br/>
<br/>
I remember my oldest looking forward to college but as the time drew closer <br/>
for her to actually move to another state, she had her doubts and I thought <br/>
that was normal, but she went.  She wasn&#39;t at all homesick until her junior <br/>
year for some reason.  Lots of things happened at college for her, some good, <br/>
some very bad, but all in all, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s glad she went.  She was 17 when <br/>
she went away though and seemed much older than Cait does. (well she WAS)<br/>
<br/>
Are other 14 year olds very set in thoughts and decisions?  I know one day <br/>
she might say that strawberry ice cream is her very favorite flavor, next <br/>
week she might say it&#39;s whatever is the specialty and I thought that was OK.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing what others experiences have been.<br/>

tuition, pay for every class I take, and forfiet my fees if I drop a class <br/>
after 7 days.  I&#39;ve dropped a lot of classes and lost a lot of money.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here in NC, a law was recently passed that will allow 14 year olds to go to <br/>
community college IF they pass some tests that prove they are above average <br/>
in intelligence... It&#39;t a pretty strict policy, like, you have to score in <br/>
the top 10% or something ( I cant find the exact details right now)  <br/>
<br/>
College is not like high school in all of the ways that Sandra mentioned.  <br/>
But, community college IS like high school in lots of ways too.( well, the <br/>
CC, I go to, that is)  Landon said there is a running joke at his high <br/>
school, Bandys High School, that our local CC is &quot;Bandys with ash trays&quot;..  <br/>
In lots of ways, that description is accurate.   There are attendance <br/>
requirements, senseless assignments, redundant material, and lots of &quot;busy <br/>
work&quot;.    I havent taken one class at CC college that an intelligent and <br/>
determined 14 yo could not pass.   BUT, lots and lots of folks over 18   fail <br/>
all the time.   Students can eat and drink in class, smoke outside, and no <br/>
one sends you to the office for cursing, but, aside from those things, the CC <br/>
in my area  is run much like high school.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915085075"><blockquote><span title="qreply">----- Original Message ----- &gt; So, perhaps it would be helpful to talk to<br/>
various people that you and<br/>
&gt; your daughter know about their college experiences: what was useful and<br/>
&gt; what was useless and what they would do differently if they had a second<br/>
chance.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would not have gone to college straight from high school.  I had no reason<br/>
for being there, other than I had good grades in high school and my parents<br/>
thought I should go and were willing to pay.  I withdrew from all the<br/>
classes I didn&#39;t like.  (That was probably good, as it kept my GPA up!)  I<br/>
didn&#39;t return for the second year, which classified me as a drop-out.  I&#39;d<br/>
gone to Kodiak, AK to earn money over the summer, and liked it so much that<br/>
I stayed there for 9 years.  It was quite a let down to my parents.  At one<br/>
time, I worked as a nanny for room and board only.  They really thought I<br/>
was a loser, but I was having the time of my life (including making the<br/>
acuaintance of some amazing people with children who helped to shape my<br/>
ideas of parenting.)<br/>
<br/>
Later, I became interested in something and got a job in that field.  I<br/>
studied the subject in my spare time, and on the job, which was encouraged<br/>
by management because they wanted their employees to be well informed.  I<br/>
decided to take a community college class for some science background that I<br/>
lacked.  That class led to another, then another.<br/>
<br/>
I took one class at a time.  Perfect for a 20 something with a full time<br/>
job.  I was able to do really well in each class (keeping that GPA up)<br/>
because I only had one class at a time to focus on.<br/>
<br/>
When I decided to return to school full-time, it was much easier to get<br/>
through the classes that I knew were only hoops to jump through, because I<br/>
had personal reasons and goals for being there.  I transferred with a high<br/>
GPA, so when I did get a couple of Ds (gasp!) they hardly effected my GPA.<br/>
<br/>
Please note, I only think the GPA matters if you will need it for<br/>
scholarships or future schooling.<br/>
<br/>
After graduation, I worked a fairly short time in my field, then had a child<br/>
and decided I&#39;d rather be home.<br/>
<br/>
If I really had to do it all again, would I have even got the B.S.?  Hard to<br/>
say.  University actually led to some of my ideas about the myths of the<br/>
importance of formal education.  I really don&#39;t think my field needs to be a<br/>
college degree.  Those with the credentials, of course, want to keep it that<br/>
way.<br/>

I was going to ask is there a specific thing she wanted to do as a career, <br/>
and if it required college.  That makes a big difference, wanting to be like <br/>
her friends is one thing, but a clear goal is another.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And from your other post, she said she wants to get it over with, in a sense? <br/>
 She may be very eager to learn everything she needs to be a doctor and start <br/>
practicing, and that kind of motivation sounds like a very positive thing.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily unusual, in fact, in one way, it reinforces my <br/>
idea that when children are unschooled, they could have very precise career <br/>

just found out that for the local colleges they &quot;encourage&quot; students to be 16 <br/>

My friends daughter went to college at fourteen.<br/>
<br/>
She started with two classes she was really interested in, did very well<br/>
and will be going back this year.<br/>
One of her professors did some kind of magic dance and she can even go<br/>
for credits this year if she chooses to.   The rule was a student had to<br/>
be sixteen, but they&#39;re waiving it for her, and I&#39;ll bet it can be done<br/>
elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
Lindsey has always been an unschooler though, has amazing confidence, and<br/>
went because she really wanted to take these particular classes, not<br/>
because she&#39;s defined a long term goal for herself.<br/>
<br/>
***teacher directed learning,***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little different though because nobody sends you to the principal<br/>
if you decide not to do the work&lt;G&gt;<br/>
She really will have all the responsibility of keeping up and doing the<br/>
work herself.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;d just go take a class or two she&#39;d have a better idea whether<br/>
it&#39;s something she wants to commit herself to full time.<br/>

find the information about it and offer to help if he got stuck with any<br/>
part of the choosing and/or registration process.<br/>
That&#39;s how I would honour his request.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I thought that was OK.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay if you think it&#39;s okay.  Our agreement or disagreement shouldn&#39;t <br/>
matter.  <br/>
<br/>
People can change their minds about ice cream no matter how old they are.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you think that most 14 year olds know what they want and are sure <br/>
&gt; of it<br/>
&gt; all the time?  I know that some probably do, or they are sure about<br/>
&gt; something&#39;s but might change their minds about others. (especially <br/>
&gt; what they<br/>
&gt; want to WEAR or how they want their hair to look)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Should she be saying something and sticking to it?  Should I just go <br/>
&gt; along<br/>
&gt; with her saying something and then later changing her mind about it?  <br/>
&gt; Should<br/>
&gt; I try to somehow persuade her to say something and stick to it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re reading &quot;stick to it&quot; but I wrote &quot;be more clear or solid about <br/>
what you mean.&quot;   For example, you said very explicitly that her only <br/>
reason was to get it over with: &quot;Her reasons for wanting to start now <br/>
are that she will be finished sooner<br/>
than later, this is the only reason she can really give me.&quot; But then <br/>
you say in another post that she thinks it will be a &quot;grand adventure.&quot; <br/>
   That is the LAST thing anybody could have gotten out of what you said <br/>
in your first post. Once again, you add information later that <br/>
completely changes the meaning of the first request for ideas. You <br/>
waste people&#39;s time that way.<br/>
<br/>
My comment was that MAYBE both of you could work on really being clear <br/>
in what you say - that it might help you communicate - maybe you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to guess what she means - like you say in this post: &quot;My <br/>
best instincts tell me that the REAL reason she is considering this is <br/>
that some of her friends who are in school have been talking about <br/>
college<br/>
and expectations and who will and will not &quot;make it&quot;.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
about proving herself and her choices more than really wanting to begin <br/>
a new part of her life&#39;s journey.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again, my response to you had absolutely NOTHING to do with 14 yo&#39;s <br/>
changing their minds.  Did you read the rest of the post or only the <br/>
first line?<br/>

&gt; her to<br/>
&gt; think she shouldn&#39;t come to me unless her plans are etched in stone <br/>
&gt; and she<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t wavering at all about them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do those of you who have young teens do this?  I thought it was part of<br/>
&gt; dreaming of the future and deciding plans and changing minds.  If she <br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; twenty maybe I would think she needs to be more decisive, but then <br/>
&gt; maybe I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t, maybe 25?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m really curious to find out other&#39;s thoughts on this.  Should I <br/>
&gt; just tell<br/>
&gt; her when she&#39;s decided for sure to let me know?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought if she wanted to try it then she should go ahead and see <br/>
&gt; what it<br/>
&gt; was all about.  If she wasn&#39;t fully committed to it, I doubt she would <br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; the tedious process of interviews and registrations and all the lengthy<br/>
&gt; process it seems to be here to get into a class schedule, so she&#39;d <br/>
&gt; save it<br/>
&gt; for a later time when it was worth it to her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember my oldest looking forward to college but as the time drew <br/>
&gt; closer<br/>
&gt; for her to actually move to another state, she had her doubts and I <br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; that was normal, but she went.  She wasn&#39;t at all homesick until her <br/>
&gt; junior<br/>
&gt; year for some reason.  Lots of things happened at college for her, <br/>
&gt; some good,<br/>
&gt; some very bad, but all in all, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s glad she went.  She was <br/>
&gt; 17 when<br/>
&gt; she went away though and seemed much older than Cait does. (well she <br/>
&gt; WAS)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are other 14 year olds very set in thoughts and decisions?  I know one <br/>
&gt; day<br/>
&gt; she might say that strawberry ice cream is her very favorite flavor, <br/>
&gt; next<br/>
&gt; week she might say it&#39;s whatever is the specialty and I thought that <br/>
&gt; was OK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I look forward to hearing what others experiences have been. </span></blockquote></div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some do and some don&#39;t; it depends on the personality of the child.  <br/>
My dd-13 (14 next month) takes a long time to make choices or <br/>
decisions, but once she does, she doesn&#39;t often change her mind.  My <br/>
dd-17 (18 in August) can change her mind as often as she changes her <br/>
clothes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should she be saying something and sticking to it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it depends on what she&#39;s saying.  If my daughter tells me <br/>
today that she wants to be a molecular biologist, I&#39;ll smile and tell <br/>
her that I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be a wonderful scientist; but I won&#39;t make <br/>
her &quot;stick&quot; to that statement.  If my daughter tells me that she&#39;s <br/>
volunteering to work at our church&#39;s vacation bible program this <br/>
summer, then I will ask her &quot;stick&quot; with it, if necessary.  It&#39;s <br/>
never been necessary, though.  The first statement was an projection <br/>
of a future event that may or may not take place; the second <br/>
statement was a commitment to a specific action, a promise to do <br/>
something, on which other people would reasonably rely and depend <br/>
on.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Should <br/>

dinner tonight; I changed my mind because circumstances changed...I <br/>
discovered I didn&#39;t have enough barbecue sauce for the pork <br/>
chops...then dh called to say he would be home earlier than usual <br/>
which wouldn&#39;t give me enough time to make and cook lasagna...then <br/>
the day was so nice that I took Kevin out for a walk and along the <br/>
way I decided it was a perfect day to grill turkey burgers.<br/>

I don&#39;t think you should do that.  Why would you close off the <br/>
opportunity for such wonderful conversations with your daughter?  I <br/>
love with my daughters talk with me, sharing their thoughts and hopes <br/>
with me, even if those hopes and desires change every day.<br/>
