hi gang PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THESE<br/>
TWO - WORST EVER VIRUS (CNN announced)<br/>
PLEASE SEND THIS TO EVERYONE ON YOUR CONTACT LIST !!<br/>
A new virus has just been discovered that has been<br/>
classified by Microsoft as the most destructive<br/>
ever!<br/>
This virus was discovered yesterday afternoon by McAfee and no vaccine has<br/>
yet been developed. This virus simply destroys Sector Zero from the hard<br/>
disk, where vital information for its functioning are stored.<br/>
<br/>
This virus acts in the following manner: It sends itself automatically to<br/>
all contacts on your list with the title &quot;A Virtual Card for You.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the supposed virtual card is opened, the computer freezes so that<br/>
the user has to reboot. When the ctrl+alt+del keys or the reset button are<br/>
pressed, the virus destroys Sector Zero, thus permanently destroying the<br/>
hard disk.<br/>
Yesterday in just a few hours this virus caused panic in New York,according<br/>
to news broadcast by CNN. This alert was received by an employee of<br/>
Microsoft itself. So don&#39;t open any mails with subject:&quot;A Virtual Card for<br/>
You.&quot;<br/>
As soon as you get this mail, delete it. Please pass this mail to all of<br/>
your friends. Forward this to everyone in your address book.<br/>
<br/>
I would rather receive this 25 times than not at all.<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
Intel announced that a new and very destructive virus was discovered<br/>
recently.  If you receive an email called &quot;An Internet Flower For You,&quot;<br/>
do not open it. Delete it right away! This virus removes all dynamic link<br/>
libraries (.dll files) from your computer. Your computer will not be able to<br/>
boot up !!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640041309">Is a hoax.  Before sending these along, please check with <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/</a>  Hoaxes are near the bottom of the page.<br/>
The tipoff is when the message says to send it to everyone on your mailing <br/>
list.  That turns it into a form of virus when so many people pass it on <br/>
without checking.<br/>
