<div id="ygrps-yiv-185302075">if we bug them all the time, if we say, &quot;You <br/>
can eat anything you want, but, oh, honey, do you really want to eat <br/>
just cake for breakfast, don&#39;t you think you should have some eggs?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This is a great parallel. Logically the best way to encourage them not to eat cake,(and eating cake for breakfast once in a while will certainly not kill you ;-) is to model healthy eating yourself. If your making a nice breakfast for yourself and them the likelihood of them choosing cake - is slim. It may happen, but it won&#39;t be the norm.<br/>
