<div id="ygrps-yiv-544067282">Where possible we use recycled paper and we recycle here. <br/>
My dd came up with this idea a while ago:  We get a large drop-sheet <br/>
(could use a sheet or calico) and the kids decorate it till their <br/>
hearts content.  Usually takes a week or so.  They use finger paint, <br/>
paint, textures, crayons, chalk, spray cans and pens - whatevers <br/>
going round.  When they are satisfied with the result I hang it up on <br/>
the wall - our own mural.  After a while they&#39;re ready for a change <br/>
and it is used as a cover for the table when they do their craft.  <br/>
Sometimes a part that they want to keep is cut out and edges sewn up. <br/>
(they would make excellent patches for a quilt someday!) Then they&#39;re <br/>
ready to start on the next masterpiece.<br/>
My ds 6 traced an outline of his body on the drop-sheet today and <br/>
wanted to know what the inside of his body looked like.  He wants to <br/>
paint his heart etc in the outline.  Back to the library - lol<br/>
We sometimes paint the window panes and they love to paint their <br/>
mirrors - self portraits.<br/>
Cardboard boxes are also great.  My kids did pictures on these with <br/>
stuff found outside (leaves, sticks and such)and it was strong enough <br/>
to hold the weight of the &#39;earth&#39;.<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to know of any other mediums people use.  Can always use <br/>
new ideas (g)<br/>

What a cool idea!<br/>
We are currently in a rental apartment and Max 3 is sharing a room with<br/>
Emily 8. We are looking for fun ideas to seperate a small part of the room<br/>
off, so Em can have some privacy. This is Excellent!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805178791">Hi Tuck<br/>
Calico is just a sort of material.  Please Tuck, tell me they&#39;re got <br/>
calico in the USA :)  Maybe you spell it different.  I think (though <br/>
I&#39;m not sure) that a lot of dresses were made of it in the pioneer <br/>
days and once when I lived in an old colonial house it had calico <br/>
curtains.  I also use this cloth to boil my xmas pudding in.  I hope <br/>
this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754546875">Yeah, we do, but I&#39;ve never heard of it used as a cover-up like that.  I <br/>
think of dresses and curtains, too.  :)<br/>
