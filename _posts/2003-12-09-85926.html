<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856128897">Thanks for all who shared what they do at bedtimes. I am &quot;new&quot; to <br/>
unschooling and somehow got the impression that I shouldn&#39;t have anymore rules ...about <br/>
anything. <br/>
But I understand now...after reading so much on unschooling.com and <br/>
sandradodd.com..that one gets rid of RULES but instead lives by PRINCIPLES.<br/>
Unschooling is so refreshing!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
~Marcia...who is reading The Unprocessd Child right now and loving it!<br/>
