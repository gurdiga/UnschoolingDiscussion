  &gt;We were created good--physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  We<br/>
  &gt;had the full range of emotions, but we used them for good, not for<br/>
  &gt;bad. I picture a level, perfectly balanced.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Then, Eve sinned.  God had told her not to, because when she did it,<br/>
  &gt;she would surely die.<br/>
  ==<br/>
  So why don&#39;t Christians worship Eve, since she was allegedly the first to <br/>
  sacrifice herself?<br/>
  Where did all those that died before Christ go?<br/>
