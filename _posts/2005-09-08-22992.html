Duncan understands movie/tv/game/ratings. He knows we don&#39;t forbid <br/>
anything, but some one rated them that way for a reason. Maybe not a <br/>
good reason! &lt;g&gt; But someone felt the need to rate it as such&such.<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t forbid anything either.  Richard (9, almost 10) and I watched Jaws today (he is on a shark kick right now).  We talked a little about the rating, it is rated PG.  I told him that I thought that if the movie had been made today it wouldn&#39;t be rated PG, but at least PG-13,  because of the gore.  There is not a lot of it, but what is there is pretty bloody, more than I remembered.  I remember thinking that it was really cheesy when I watched it originally, but I didn&#39;t think that at all this time.  He said that with the severed limbs that they show and the dead body that comes out of the hole in the boat he didn&#39;t think it would be rated PG, and we talked about how PG stands for Parental Guidance, and that the idea is that people should know their kids and be able to help guide them about whether a movie would be disturbing to them, and that different people find different things disturbing.  Both he and I were more disturbed by the disappearance of the dog in the movie than by the people getting eaten.  I am glad that they didn&#39;t show the dog being eaten.  <br/>
<br/>
Richard had watched all of the Shark Week shows on Discovery, and the Mythbusters episode about Jaws, and was pretty well prepared for the movie.  Before the movie he decided that he would probably want to sit on my lap while we watched, so we turned out the lights, cuddled up with a blanket and watched it.   I was there for him to cuddle into when he was scared and he even put the blanket over his head for one scene.   It was really nice and sweet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gore or not, they didn&#39;t have a PG-13 rating when &quot;Jaws&quot; was made <br/>
(1975).  The first PG-13 movie was &quot;Red Dawn,&quot; from 1984.  &quot;Indiana <br/>
Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; was so over-the-top, but rated PG, that <br/>
the new rating was created for that kind of film.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, &quot;Jaws&quot; is still considered the scariest movie ever made by some <br/>
sources.  (And yes, I&#39;m old enough to have seen it the first week it <br/>
came out -- and I did go back in the water.)<br/>

hardly bite.<br/>

(But I saw The Exorcist new and that was scary, but didn&#39;t have the scary <br/>
theme-bit.)<br/>
