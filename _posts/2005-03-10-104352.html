<div id="ygrps-yiv-668085031">Thank you all for your kind suggestions.  I guess once I&#39;m more confident things will get easier.  I spoke in more detail about this subject tonight with our nanny and she seems to be understanding.  She of course asked the usual questions..college, legality, ect.  But once I explained things to her a little more, she realized that doing this with the older kids is exactly what we&#39;ve been doing with the little ones all the long.  Also, she is rarely alone with the kids.  We have 8 children so she&#39;s around as a third set of hands.  I&#39;m sure that with my coaching and maybe a little help from this site (I took the advice and told her about it) she will be fine.<br/>
BTW my daughter has said &quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re actually being hs&#39;d.  Thank you so much!&quot;  half a dozen times today.  This definately reminds me that the questioning is worth it.<br/>
Again thank you so much for the support this site gives.<br/>
<br/>
Sadie</div>
