<div id="ygrps-yiv-124090112">I used to correspond with someone named Jean who had a homeschool theater group near Washington, D.C. We were about to exchange some video tapes of each other&#39;s productions when I had big computer problems and lost her address.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you heard of such a person? I seem to remember she got into some disputes with people who thought she was excluding kids who didn&#39;t homeschool--I think she was even mentioned in Newsweek at one time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any tips....<br/>
