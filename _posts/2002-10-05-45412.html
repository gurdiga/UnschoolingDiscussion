 </span></blockquote>Actually it isn&#39;t strong enough for her, that&#39;s our problem!!! LOL! She&#39;s 24 <br/>
lbs. and thinks she can hang onto the &quot;bars&quot; when getting in and out. That&#39;s <br/>
why we&#39;re falling apart already. That and of course our 16 year old has been <br/>
in it and me and my husband too. Doesn&#39;t help crawling our big butts inside! <br/>
It&#39;s about 7ft by 5 ft. and we have to squeeze by it in the playroom what <br/>
with all the other stuff, bean bag chairs and the table and all. And as I <br/>
write, Joseph and Sierra are having a blast tearing it down. They enjoyed it <br/>
for a couple of days but it&#39;s needing to be reinforced to often and it has <br/>
put a damper on their play space. Definitely a fun project though. If we had <br/>
more open room for it and maybe less baby activity, I&#39;m sure it would have <br/>
held up better. Not bad for first timers though!!!<br/>

As soon as my husband saw the finished product, he commented on making one <br/>
outside that would be permanent. I rolled my eyes because he has no time at <br/>
all left to such things. BUT, when someone sent the website with plans for a <br/>
permanent one, I saved it and showed it to him. He said thanks but with a <br/>
very sarcastic tone! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
