<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236380871"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I find it difficult to find the value in Spiderman, Superman, etc.  This is my son&#39;s current &quot;thing.&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son has always liked science fiction, shows and books -- Star Wars, Star Trek Voyager, Aliens v. Predators, Enterprise, Matrix, Stargate 1, etc.  I never used to be able to stand it, couldn&#39;t see anything &quot;redeeming&quot; about it.  However, after watching it with him over and over and reading the books to him, it kinda grew on me.  Actually, I sorta had to *decide to like it* or I&#39;d have gone nuts, since it&#39;s an almost daily thing.  It&#39;s still not what I pick when I sit down to watch, but it no longer makes me crazy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I&#39;m working on.  Not making me crazy.  I need to look at it like <br/>
Nathan&#39;s hair, which is really fairly long.  It&#39;s his hair, he can decide when <br/>
to ask me to cut it.  He calmly tells people he&#39;s a boy, when they are <br/>
mistaken.  Once he told a woman at the store (when she said &quot;What beautiful girls <br/>
you have&quot;) - &quot;But I have a penis!&quot;  His hair doesn&#39;t bother me.  I&#39;m working on <br/>
my superheroes hangups.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He just turned five.  I can&#39;&#39;t quite explain his inflection here, but he said <br/>
it slowly, loudly and deliberately, wtih the emphasis on I (pointing at <br/>
himself) and PENIS.  Poor lady was a bit fiberglasted, as a friend of our says, but <br/>
she&#39;ll survive.<br/>
