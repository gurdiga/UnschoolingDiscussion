<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627812327"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve never known a single unschooled teen (and by now I&#39;ve known pretty<br/>
 </span></blockquote>many) who was anxious and eager to leave home.<br/>
<br/>
That is so interesting to read, Sandra! I have been thinking about why it<br/>
is that my teens are so content here at home . . . and all the others we<br/>
know who are in school are itching to break away. People have accused me<br/>
(yep, accused) of making it too comfortable here for them - that they will<br/>
never want to go, be stiffled, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Just recently, my oldest, Sky 19, has been talking about how many of the<br/>
interests he has (SCA activities, Celtic arts, and many more) are not<br/>
available here on our gorgeous island of Kauai - and that he wants/needs to<br/>
experience the world and some of what it has to offer. But, he is reluctant<br/>
to leave home! He even suggested, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that we all<br/>
ought to just move, because it would not be an issue if we lived somewhere<br/>
else for him to find people with these interests. <br/>
<br/>
I am grateful to have provided a place in which my children feel so<br/>
respected, comfortable and content. <br/>
<br/>
Any others with similiar experiences? We walk a lonely path here - being<br/>
the ONLY unschoolers with teens on the entire island - there are two other<br/>
families with younger children! This list uplifts me and helps me every day.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Lee<br/>

If he&#39;s interested, he&#39;s welcome to stay with us for a while---just to get <br/>
out and meet some new people. That way he wouldn&#39;t have to move out, just <br/>
&quot;visit&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know!<br/>

<br/>
He could come visit in Albuquerque, too.  Two fighter practices a week, if he <br/>
does THAT sort of SCA. &lt;g&gt;  (My husband and older son do.)  Big SCA group <br/>
here.  I could introduce him to some artists doing museum-reproduction <br/>
quality stuff, too.  Viking and Saxon, more than Celtic, but still...<br/>

our group are. One family is pretty active in the Celtic festival here<br/>
(sometime in the summer, but I don&#39;t know exactly when but could find out).<br/>
We have a studio apartment in our basement, so we&#39;re pretty well equipped<br/>
for visitors.<br/>
Hey, he could do the unschooling house tour of the mainland! Now a cool way<br/>
to do it would be to have each family drive him to the next family&#39;s house,<br/>
then we could meet up with even more fun folks and road trip at the same<br/>
time.<br/>

to explore lots of the same things once we move this summer. They <br/>
could check out some stuff together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121826000">Many thanks to all of you who wrote about Sky visiting! I&#39;ve told him and<br/>
his response was really open and favorable. So, after his planned trip this<br/>
summer to Nova Scotia to attend the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts for two<br/>
weeks, he is looking at perhaps traveling some. We will be in touch with<br/>
those who so generously offered him &#39;shelter&#39; and experiences outside of<br/>
home, inside their homes and lives!<br/>

<br/>
When you get to scheduling it, maybe if you schedule around/through major SCA <br/>
events, we could get him tranported that way, in part (and he wouldn&#39;t miss <br/>
the big extravaganzas).<br/>
