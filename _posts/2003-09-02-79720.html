&lt;&lt; . Renee must have mentioned it to Jayn every time<br/>
she saw her, because Jayn kept on telling me, &quot;The Mary-Kate is for<br/>
Angel&quot;. Renee has repeatedly said that Jayn has all the toys she, ie<br/>
Renee, wants. I am convinced that she was only coming here in order to<br/>
use Jayn&#39;s toys. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you just buy her the Mary-Kate doll as a gift?  Poor thing.<br/>
<br/>
We have a kid who comes here to play video games.  I&#39;m the only person it <br/>
seems to bother, so I really try to just breathe through it and let it go. He <br/>
DOES do other things with the kids, but mostly he&#39;s here to wait his turn to play <br/>
the newest games Kirby has bought.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I felt like I was somehow letting down the philosophy of freedom if I<br/>
intervened. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But your focus should be your OWN child&#39;s freedom, and her own comfort in her <br/>
own home.   That&#39;s the problem with any discussions of &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;liberty <br/>
and justice,&quot; even.   21st century: Free to have a job one&#39;s not qualified <br/>
for?  Free to bug the heck out of other people?  Free to be a telemarketer?    <br/>
20th century:  Free to discriminate?  Free to have a segregated neighborhood?  <br/>
19th century:   Free to own slaves or lynch the neighbors?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sandra&#39;s posts from the past had<br/>
accounts of things she has said to other children, and there were<br/>
examples of Holly and others who seemed so clear eyed about the toxic<br/>
behaviors they encounter in non-unschoolers. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was often with Holly saying, &quot;I know, mom, but I want to go over there <br/>
anyway&quot; in response to me saying &quot;Well if they&#39;re being tacky, you don&#39;t have <br/>
to go!<br/>
<br/>
I had words again with Marty&#39;s friend Logan Sunday night who was <br/>
pontificating on his hatred of lesbians.  I wanted Marty to say sofriends of a lesbian <br/>
couple most of us know.  Logan knows them too, but probably didn&#39;t know they&#39;re a <br/>
couple because he&#39;s been around them separately at different times.  So I <br/>
slammed him with that news and told him to keep his bullshit at his own house.<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;Yes ma&#39;am&quot; and left (legitimately, to go on a Ticketmaster&#39;s run <br/>
with others) soon after.  I asked Marty the next day whether Logan survived.  He <br/>
said &quot;I was a conversation killer,&quot; but that Logan would be back.   I asked <br/>
Holly that night whether Logan would badmouth me behind my back, and she said he <br/>
never has before.  She said he did say to her one time that he was scared to <br/>
death of me, that if he said the wrong thing I would stab him in the face.  <br/>
&quot;In the back!&quot; I told Holly.<br/>
<br/>
My first goal is to change his thinking.<br/>
Second acceptable goal is to make him afraid enough that he&#39;ll be more <br/>
socially acceptable in my house.<br/>
Third Plan:  He won&#39;t come over.<br/>
<br/>
But Marty likes him, so if Marty suffers some embarrassment or killed <br/>
conversations for the &quot;freedom&quot; to keep having Logan in a house he shares with <br/>
others, I don&#39;t feel too bad about it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I wonder what she thinks<br/>
when she sees someone whom she admires using violent repressive<br/>
parenting - name calling, shaming, punishments, removal of &quot;privileges&quot;,<br/>
and control. Yet how can I ask Jayn about it without being leading or<br/>
seeming to be criticizing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know! I know!<br/>
Well maybe I have an idea.<br/>
<br/>
You could say casually, or in a comforting moment, &quot;I bet Tania&#39;s parents <br/>
were really mean to her when she was little.  That&#39;s too bad, because it makes <br/>
her kind of a mean mom.  We&#39;re trying to be really nice to you so it will make <br/>
it easier for you to be a nice mom someday.  Tania&#39;a probably nicer than her <br/>
parents were, and Renee will probably be nicer to her kids than Tania is, but <br/>
it&#39;s too bad they can&#39;t hurry and be nicer now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I wish the behavior influence could work the other way, as some<br/>
of you have witnessed in your dealings with other kids, but I just don&#39;t<br/>
think it will right now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think it does, depending on the personality of the kids.  I&#39;ve <br/>
seen Kirby and Holly both just SAY things to other kids about loosening up and <br/>
not being so controlling, or about learning things for fun, or about not being <br/>
critical (whatever the little situation was at the time), but Marty lets Logan <br/>
run his runny-mouth course.<br/>
<br/>
There was another friend Marty had from ice hockey years ago, and he kept <br/>
inviting Marty over, but the boy was mean to his younger brother and Marty didn&#39;t <br/>
like that at all.  Marty would try to include the younger boy, or just leave <br/>
and go play with him, because he didn&#39;t want to be an agent or the excuse for <br/>
that boy being sad or hurt or crying.  But the older brother was truly a <br/>
bully, so Marty said no to a couple of invitations, and then asked me to tell the <br/>
grandmother (GREAT grandmother, actually, who was raising them in a really <br/>
fancy house, well provided for, and she seemed really nice and bright, but <br/>
somewhere down the line things hadn&#39;t gone well) exactly what he didn&#39;t like, that he <br/>
would only go back if the older boy would be nice to the brother while he was <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
He did visit at least one more time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My husband kept saying that I should ask the group for advice, as I<br/>
frantically searched the archives and cried every night - this was weeks<br/>
ago before I made my fateful decision to try to control my child&#39;s<br/>
relationship with this other. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You were trying to maintain her peace and safety.  That&#39;s good.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Most shameful of all, I am glad that this child is going<br/>
to school. She will be away for hours every day, and then they will need<br/>
their family time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might be fun for her.  OR it might not, and that other mom might be coming <br/>
to you for homeschooling advice.  Then you won&#39;t be intruding if you give her <br/>
mothering advice.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I hope she makes a ton of other friends and drops<br/>
Jayn like a hot potato.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope she comes to realize how cool your house is and starts to act the way <br/>
you want her to!<br/>
<br/>
Kids get older, and many just drop their little-kid defenses in favor of more <br/>
mature interactions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-809208301">&lt;&lt;Can you just buy her the Mary-Kate doll as a gift?  Poor thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You know I have thought about this, since Jayn asked for and received<br/>
both, plus some other little ones as well. I feel awkward because for<br/>
all I know they may have purchased it and are hiding it for her birthday<br/>
in October, and if I ask if they have it, or would they mind if I got<br/>
it, (or indeed if I just bought it) they might feel it as a judgment of<br/>
them. (Let&#39;s face it - it would be!) I thought I would phrase it as<br/>
asking for advice on what I could get her for her birthday, because I<br/>
don&#39;t want to duplicate anything.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We have a kid who comes here to play video games.  I&#39;m the only person<br/>
it <br/>
seems to bother, so I really try to just breathe through it and let it<br/>
go. He <br/>
DOES do other things with the kids, but mostly he&#39;s here to wait his<br/>
turn to play the newest games Kirby has bought.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about trying to breathe through it. However Jayn<br/>
has been very willing to let Renee use anything. There are some special<br/>
things with many tiny parts or that are no longer available, that I put<br/>
up before they come, just because I don&#39;t want the distress of anything<br/>
lost or broken. Jayn is remarkably careful, and I am assiduous in<br/>
keeping stuff together - God bless the inventor of Ziploc baggies. Renee<br/>
has asked for them repeatedly, but I tell her they are not available, by<br/>
my decision. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But your focus should be your OWN child&#39;s freedom, and her own comfort<br/>
in her <br/>
own home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for this validation, and to all to have responded.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You could say casually, or in a comforting moment, &quot;I bet Tania&#39;s<br/>
parents <br/>
were really mean to her when she was little.  That&#39;s too bad, because it<br/>
makes <br/>
her kind of a mean mom.  We&#39;re trying to be really nice to you so it<br/>
will make <br/>
it easier for you to be a nice mom someday.  Tania&#39;a probably nicer than<br/>
her <br/>
parents were, and Renee will probably be nicer to her kids than Tania<br/>
is, but <br/>
it&#39;s too bad they can&#39;t hurry and be nicer now.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Jayn sees her as being a mean mom. I don&#39;t think she<br/>
realizes Renee is manipulating her. I  believe that Tania likes Jayn,<br/>
and feels sorry for her for having a mother who wants to limit her<br/>
playtime (for any other reason than being punished that is). Renee<br/>
started saying in my hearing how sorry she felt for Jayn, an idea I<br/>
think it is unlikely she developed for herself. People sometimes use the<br/>
expression of pity to feel better about themselves. Tania jumped on her<br/>
quickly to stop saying that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I hope she comes to realize how cool your house is and starts to act<br/>
the way <br/>
you want her to!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure my house is cool, although of course we have free access to<br/>
any snacks they like. I suspect that Renee knows she is being closely<br/>
watched, even if I am reading a magazine or doing e-mail. My husband<br/>
can&#39;t stand the way a mess is left, but I am perfectly happy to clean up<br/>
after them myself, rather than feel in any way obligated to &quot;force&quot; Jayn<br/>
to reciprocate tidying up at their house. Of course there is much less<br/>
mess there, because there are way fewer toys. The one time I tried to<br/>
please him by making Jayn put some tea set things away before she and<br/>
Renee were going over to her place, was a disaster of crying. I was<br/>
ashamed that I had allowed a feeling of being insufficient, of wanting<br/>
Jayn to be viewed as fantastic by this other parent, to overcome my<br/>
better judgment of what Jayn should be asked to do. It is not only<br/>
Jayn&#39;s behavior that is being negatively effected, it is mine and my<br/>
thinking!! This was before the shot in the arm of the Conference.<br/>
<br/>
Renee returned and helped me put the stuff away after Tania told her to<br/>
and sent her back. Actually Renee is very good about putting her trash<br/>
into the bin, and I always thank her. I figure Jayn will get that<br/>
eventually. This is one of the issues that some of the conference<br/>
speakers got me thinking about - the difference between the appearance<br/>
of being well-behaved, and the truth of feeling free and honest in one&#39;s<br/>
behavior and actions. <br/>
