<div id="ygrps-yiv-407671385">Several months ago Jayn wanted to make doll�s furniture for her soft<br/>
Madeline doll � about 16 inches tall. The only criteria was that is had to<br/>
be ordinary household objects. We used plastic chip packages, cardboard<br/>
boxes, sticky tape, straws and assorted containers. Together we made a<br/>
bedroom, bathroom with toilet, kitchen with fridge, stove and microwave,<br/>
living room, and a vehicle plus assorted small accessories. Whenever I<br/>
offered her one of her miniature doll things � for example a tiny teacup �<br/>
she would remind me that it *had* to be made from ordinary household<br/>
objects. This phrase she got from her Sleeping Beauty DVD.  <br/>
<br/>
At the time this struck me because I remembered being forced to use boxes<br/>
and scoops and old pincushions for my Barbie doll�s furniture because no one<br/>
would buy me the Barbie doll�s house I so desperately desired. There was a<br/>
kind of attitude from the adults (that I was supposed to emulate btw) that<br/>
�at least this forces her to be creative�, as if that were somehow lacking<br/>
in my life. I was always led to believe that Barbies were prohibitively<br/>
expensive at the time in the 1960�s � and now I wonder about that.<br/>
<br/>
After a few days I asked Jayn if I could put the stuff away, as it was<br/>
pretty much taking up all of her play area, and starting to get knocked<br/>
about but not used. This was approved provided it was not to be thrown out.<br/>
OK. I put it all in a box and put it aside. <br/>
<br/>
Well tonight she got it all out again, rearranged it, and is using it for<br/>
another doll under her table. Lucky no-one thought this precious stuff was<br/>
trash and accidentally tossed it!<br/>

<br/>
I have issues over Barbie too.:)<br/>
My Mom wouldn&#39;t buy us the Barbie dolls, she was convinced they promoted poor self esteem in girls, so we got the very mainstream, family looking &quot;Sunshine dolls&quot; instead.<br/>
I figured out later, that the poor self esteem she tried so desperately to help me avoid, but did indeed come along, was due to being told my interests weren&#39;t worthy.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing someone to be creative? ARGH. This really hits me between the eyes right now, as I&#39;m honing a 4 week course on creativity. This morning I awoke with an entire meditation flowing beautifully through my mind. It&#39;s fairly lengthy, but at one point involves removing the shackles around your ankles that your parents/teachers/ministers put there...the shackles of Fear of Criticism that inhibit true creativity.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s wonderful to know there are children that are free to be TRULY creative, using their own minds and materials in ways that they choose. I value creativity so much, and try to always provide an environment that allows for their unique explorations.<br/>
Like Jayn, I ADORED miniature worlds as a child...still do.  I used to build small houses out of shoe boxes with my dear Grandma. We&#39;d make little beds and curtains and all sorts of furniture, I LOVED this time with her. We had these little ceramic bears that lived in my built homes, she passed them on to me a few years ago...such sweet times. Ironically enough, the Grandma that generated some of my fondest childhood memories, is a total pain in the arse about homeschooling.:) Such is life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820798743">Jayn&#39;s creativity *does* sound wonderful, and isn&#39;t it even more so because<br/>
she chose it?<br/>
<br/>
FWIW....<br/>
Not to undermine the recycling, but something else just popped into my head<br/>
that she/you may or may not have fun with. Have you ever used Sculpey clay?<br/>
It&#39;s a polymer clay that can be molded, baked hard right in the oven and<br/>
then painted. That could make some really fabulous doll furniture, too. Only<br/>
if she&#39;s interested in it, of course. ;) Just thought I&#39;d pass along the<br/>
idea.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to think that myself, even with the example from my childhood of<br/>
having a pile of Barbie stuff yet still raiding moms fabric scraps and old<br/>
socks to make clothes and still going out to dads scrap wood to find couch<br/>
and bed sized blocks. My daughter has sooooo much stuff and I don&#39;t hesitate<br/>
to buy her more anymore. She still gets bored with it all and that boredom<br/>
breeds a lot of creativity. People that think kids need to be denied things<br/>
to be creative really don&#39;t get how a kids mind works.<br/>
