<h4>The Clifton&#39;s</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828440159">Boy did things end up unexpectedly blowing up tonight. I thought, all last evening and all today, about whether I should talk directly to Elliot or go to his parents. ( Side note: I&#39;ve only met his mom once. I know from what other neighbors have said that they go to church and are supposedly strict Christians. I should also note that we are military and live in post housing. We live in multiplexes, 4 units in a building, so we don&#39;t have much of a yard. The kids play up and down the whole street. The one thing about living in gov. quarters is that if the MP&#39;s get called a certain number of times on your kids they will evict you.) So I do have some recourse although I really don&#39;t want it to come to that.<br/>
<br/>
Well, tonight my choice was made for me. We had only been home a short time and the kids were outside playing. I went out and Elliot and Kyle were again in the same situation as last evening with Elliot taking the gun and running off with it. This time though I ended up jumping his ass. He is so disrespectful to everyone and it pissed me off. That is not how I had intended it to go. I laid it all out for him, why I had not jumped in before now and what I would no longer tolerate. I did tell him that I will call the MP&#39;s if it doesn&#39;t stop. He doesn&#39;t accept responsibility for any of his actions. All he kept trying to do was bring up old infractions that Kyle had done that had been handled a long time ago. I talked to his mom after I got done with him. She said that they are very open about what they discuss with their kids so that they can dispell what the kids pick up at school.  I can agree with that part, sounds rather unschooly. She said she would talk to him about the bully stuff and the overt sexual behavior. I don&#39;t know what will actually come of it though. On one hand, she was telling me all these things she didn&#39;t agree with him doing and then on the other, she said that&#39;s just how Elliot is. She didn&#39;t agree with any of the possibilities that I brought up, like him trying to get attention or him always trying to be the most powerful and on top.<br/>
<br/>
She said it is ironic that this is happening today ( last day of school) because everyone at school was telling her how good his behavior has been.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, at the end of the conversation, we saw eye to eye on what should be the end result of all of this but we will see if that actually happens. <br/>
<br/>
Deb L, you were right on with your post about the whole thing. I felt the same way that you were describing. I want to be able to help other kids when they need it but my kids come first. I&#39;m such a bleeding heart for people and especially animals. People don&#39;t act out for no good reason though so you know something has to be troubling him. It&#39;s sad though if his mom isn&#39;t willing to find out what&#39;s at bottom of his behavior. Part of me feels guilty about letting this go on for as long as it did. Kyle doesn&#39;t have any ill feelings toward me about it though. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your concern<br/>

Well at least the kid and the mom are on notice. I wish you had said you had <br/>
base housing earlier, because the civilian world does not always work the same <br/>
as the military world does. Code of conduct is extended to ones family should <br/>
they use base housing. I&#39;d say definately call the MP&#39;s and get in writing <br/>
what infractions are considered and what the reprecussions are. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>

I agree. Military housing can be quite a different animal when it comes to <br/>
behavior. He said she said can turn into the military spouse being reprimanded <br/>
by a superior if it gets worse. This way you can prove and remember all the <br/>
situations. A good paper trail is always nice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698871656">Yea, Sandra, I&#39;ve been saving this whole thread.<br/>
<br/>
This morning when they all came out to play, Elliot went up to Kyle and<br/>
stuck his hand out to shake Kyle&#39;s and called a truce. He asked Kyle if they<br/>
could be friends. I&#39;m going to keep my eyes and ears open but hopefully the<br/>
worst is behind us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Later after I posted that last message, he came to my door and apologized to<br/>
me. I apologized for yelling at him and told him that I do want to be his<br/>
friend. I&#39;ll try to reach out as much as I can and still protect my kids. As<br/>
far as I can tell, I&#39;m the only mom that sits out in the front yard talking<br/>
with all the kids on the street. Hopefully, that will make a difference for<br/>
someone.<br/>
