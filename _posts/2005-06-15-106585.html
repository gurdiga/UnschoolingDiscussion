&lt;&lt; So Holly, who still often will say &quot;You talk, mom,&quot; is at HesFes  <br/>
interacting <br/>
like CRAZY with lots of people she&#39;s never met before.  It will  be <br/>
interesting to see if she&#39;s more likely to do her own talking without even  <br/>
glancing <br/>
back at me (as Kirby does) when she&#39;s home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Update, on kid-confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a problem she wanted my help with before she&#39;d been home half a <br/>
day.  A little neighbor had come over to see her (he&#39;s maybe 8 or 9, and she&#39;s <br/>
known him a long time), and I told him she was in England and wouldn&#39;t be back <br/>
until the next day.  He came back.   She doesn&#39;t want to get involved with him <br/>
(or his family) again, and though she sent him away, he lurked in the front <br/>
yard, hiding, waiting for her to come out.  (He wanted her to go to the park <br/>
where the free lunch is and she said she would be there after a while.)<br/>
<br/>
She cried, though, after he had gone (she thought), because she has tried in <br/>
the past to tell him no, don&#39;t come over; no, I don&#39;t want to hang out.  She <br/>
said &quot;I wish Zeke (not his real name) didn&#39;t even know where I lived.&quot;  I said <br/>
it might be a better wish to wish Zeke had some friends.&quot;   She said &quot;Zeke <br/>
needs a family that knows his name.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She feels he&#39;s just neglected and ignored bigtime at home.  She&#39;s been there <br/>
lots, and would know.   <br/>
<br/>
We discussed strategies and the briefest, strongest things she might say <br/>
without being cruel.  She can&#39;t figure out a way that won&#39;t make her seem like a <br/>
horrible person.  She cried some more.   I asked if she wanted me to talk to <br/>
him if he comes back and she seemed really relieved.  It will make me seem mean <br/>
too, but Holly doesn&#39;t have an obligation to make him happy, and I do have <br/>
some obligation to help Holly live in peace.<br/>
<br/>
When she found out he was hiding in the bushes out front and had never left, <br/>
she was less sympathetic, but she went with him to the park and then hung out <br/>
with another family when they got there.  <br/>
<br/>
One reason he doesn&#39;t understand &quot;no&quot; is that he hears it too much at home.  <br/>
He has to remain hopeful in the face of &quot;no.&quot;   This is hard for Holly all <br/>
kinds of ways.<br/>
