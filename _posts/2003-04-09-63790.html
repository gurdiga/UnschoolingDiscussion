&lt;&lt; PLEASE forgive me for bringing this up again. But I just HAVE to say it. <br/>
Yoki <br/>
 (hi Yoki) has come to this list saying that she schools at home. No one has <br/>
 jumped on her, told her to just do it, been short or impatient with her,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But Yoki has been asking questions, NOT being defensive and telling us why <br/>
she should keep on schooling!!!<br/>
Why are you bringing this up again?<br/>
We don&#39;t need the little moral &quot;lesson&quot; you&#39;re trying to impart. Really.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Why are you bringing this up again? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just to point out an observation that I had; that maybe she wasn&#39;t being <br/>
defensive BECAUSE she was being treated respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We don&#39;t need the little moral &quot;lesson&quot; you&#39;re trying to impart. Really. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t implying (certainly didn&#39;t say it) that you do. Just making a timely <br/>
observation I had for anyone wanting to have some food for thought on the <br/>
heal of that loooong conversation. It&#39;s been made clear that anyone not <br/>
liking what&#39;s being said or the style of it, should just use the delete. So I <br/>
made my observation, and figured people could just delete it if they so <br/>
desired.    Lara...........</div>

responses to anyone&#39;s questions here.  It&#39;s usually the defensive response<br/>
to the answers that gets the unpleasantness going, and Yoki didn&#39;t do that.<br/>

<br/>
I read it and thought the writer was being complimentary to the list, not <br/>
critical. <br/>
I don&#39;t know who wrote it--didn&#39;t notice, but I saw it as &quot;SEE?  This list <br/>
CAN work right!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see it as a moral lesson.  One of us read wrong.  Could&#39;ve been me.<br/>

<br/>
But that implies that newcomers are all treated DIFFERENTLY!! They aren&#39;t.<br/>
Yoki got the same comments, questions and information anyone else gets. <br/>
REALLY.<br/>
She happens to be very open to learning, considering and asking more <br/>
questions.<br/>
That&#39;s the ONLY difference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186934811">Maybe its that Yoki has come here asking about unschooling instead of being <br/>
defensive. I for one admire the way she speaks to this group (poor <br/>
communicator here) and the way everyone has responded to her. Maybe <br/>
observations about her receiving different treatment than say you or I should <br/>
be kept to ourselves so that we don&#39;t make Yoki feel bad. Maybe we received <br/>
different treatment because we handled the way we spoke to this group poorly, <br/>
atleast I know I did. Thanks Yoki for being here, I&#39;m learning a lot from <br/>
you! (and everyone else)<br/>
