I also live in Missouri.  I just &quot;translate&quot; my kids lives into  &quot;education <br/>
instructional hours&quot;.  My kids have very limited knowledge of  what I develop <br/>
into our &quot;log&quot;.  The less my kids know about the  recordkeeping, the better it <br/>
is.  Just keep it simple in your mind and you  will be ok.<br/>
 <br/>
I understand what you are going through.  It gets easier.  The  ACME helped <br/>
me ALOT.  Also, I agree, I won&#39;t lie about what I write in my  &quot;log&quot;.  I also <br/>
keep a portfolio of different things that &quot;show&quot; educational  progress.<br/>
 <br/>
As far as HSLDA, I live in Missouri, and they represented me, and defended  <br/>
me, and we unschool.  Just had to throw in my personal 2c in on this  topic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107104192">Well, that&#39;s nice to know that HSLDA helped you out.  So do you still <br/>
have a membership then?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to have  my husband convert the ACME over so I can read it on <br/>
my iMac.  I feel a lot better after all the comments on this log issue. <br/>
  And the fact that I feel we can truly unschool now.  I can see now <br/>
that it was making us both miserable.  He freely played his games all <br/>
day without having to get some &quot;educational stuff&quot; in first so I would <br/>
have something to log in the book.  I sat with him for a long time <br/>
between playing with the other 3 kids and we were able to just openly <br/>
talk about what was going on in his game.  I never really sat down much <br/>
to watch him play-mainly because it makes me have motion sickness!  <br/>
But, I have to say it was a wonderful, relaxing experience and he was <br/>
SO happy to be doing what he loves to do.<br/>

Aha!  I&#39;ve never sent people straight there this way, and if you go without <br/>
the link you don&#39;t see that they were written by Pam Sorooshian.  I&#39;ll go in <br/>
and fix that.<br/>
