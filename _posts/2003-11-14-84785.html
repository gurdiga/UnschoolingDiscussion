&gt; &gt;you&#39;d cross one set of fingers because you wanted your wish to come true,<br/>

&gt;Life long Michigander, but I&#39;ve never heard of this one.  Maybe a west<br/>

fingers thing was a Southeastern-Michigan-learned thing.  We were a stone&#39;s <br/>
throw from the Ohio border, so maybe a Buckeye infiltrated and taught us to <br/>
do it wrong... come to think of it, the girl who was my bestest friend <br/>
then, lives in Ohio now...<br/>
Hmmmmn.<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s something to that...<br/>

Durn Buckeyes!  ;-)<br/>

heard of the crossing-for-the-opposite-wish thing! Gotta be a Michigander <br/>
thing (those folks who don&#39;t know how to drive!) LOL<br/>
