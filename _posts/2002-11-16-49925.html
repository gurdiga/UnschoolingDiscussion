Yes, that&#39;s the true beauty of homeopathy.  It treats the trauma and <br/>
the physical condition simultaneously.  Good to know there are other <br/>
homeopaths on this list.  I often hestitate to bring up homeopathy <br/>
because it is so unknown to most Americans.  It was/is very common <br/>
where I lived for 27 years, as it is all around the rest of the <br/>
world, but not where we are living now, the seat of conservatism in <br/>
Ohio.  <br/>
<br/>
If only more people knew more about it, so many problems, like those <br/>
who get labeled as ADD or ADHD, or autistic, or those suffering from <br/>
so many chronic complaints, could find gentle, safe relief.  <br/>

Basically in Ohio no one can practice medicine unless they are an M. <br/>
D., or equivalent (D. O., for example) period.  It is considered to <br/>
be &quot;practicing medicine without a license&quot; and the local medical <br/>
societies do initiate prosecutorial action regularly.  Funny how a <br/>
really bad M. D. is almost impossible to get rid of, but they will <br/>
attack with a vengeance anyone not in the &quot;club.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the good old boys medical monopoly that has dominated this <br/>
country since the Flexner Report in 1910 which was used to <br/>
conveniently support the move by the AMA to corner the market on the <br/>
American medical business.  This was one of the most <br/>
successful &quot;closed union&quot; coups, in terms of dollars, in American <br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
Even though homeopathy has continued to thrive and develop around the <br/>
rest of the world, especially in countries like the UK, France, <br/>
Germany, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand, and even more so in <br/>
India, the fall-out from the well-timed Flexner report has severely <br/>
crippled homeopathy in this country.  Some states have more liberal <br/>
laws and some recently have started to change their laws to <br/>
accommodate alternative practitioners.  I have always lived in those <br/>
other more liberal states.  So coming to Ohio has been a real <br/>
hardship for my family.  But we are only here for a few more years at <br/>
the most, so I will survive.  <br/>
<br/>
In general I find people here, at least in the Cincinnati area, are <br/>
very traditional about medicine, and very gullible, believing <br/>
everything that the AMA and its various government arms (FDA, CDC, <br/>
NIH, NIMH, etc.) tell them.  They will look me right in the eye and <br/>
tell me that if homeopathy really worked then they know that their <br/>
doctor would be suggesting it for them.  Okay.  At 57 I am old enough <br/>
to know better than to argue with them.  But having been a <br/>
practitioner for more than 30 years I guess I would have to discount <br/>
everything that I have seen, studied, researched, learned for the <br/>
past 30 plus years to accept that kind of argument.  <br/>
