<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031288421">I wanted something to read while I was having lunch, so I clicked on a <br/>
homeschooling blog ring and read something a little sad.   In the description of the <br/>
blog the mom had specified right early and clearly that her method was <br/>
eclectic.   After reading about another slightly younger child for whom she finds <br/>
reading and math instruction online, I read this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-My daughter, age 16, is going her own way, refusing to believe that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to attend public highschool to succeed in college. She&#39;s been a <br/>
rebellion factory for years now - this is nothing new. I know if I wanted her to <br/>
attend a public school she would be begging for homeschool.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Refusing to believe&quot;?<br/>
That phrase doesn&#39;t come up at our house.   <br/>
<br/>
I think mostly it&#39;s because I don&#39;t just TELL my kids that something is or <br/>
isn&#39;t true, I try to find evidence so they can see for themselves and believe it <br/>
because of proof.   There&#39;s no refusal to believe what is clearly shown.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby brakes quickly and later than I would, when he drives.   I&#39;ve told him <br/>
a couple of stories and reminded him that brakes CAN fail, and I told him that <br/>
I wished he&#39;d be careful BEFORE he experiences brake failure.   He didn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;refuse to believe&quot; it, he tries to do it my way, but his belief so far is based <br/>
on his own experience.   <br/>
<br/>
The other day he bumped the back of a pickup (or SUV or something high).   He <br/>
was in a big van.   They were big.   He didn&#39;t hit hard.   The other car <br/>
turned right from the middle lane, so Kirby followed figuring they wanted to pull <br/>
over and discuss insurance, maybe call the police, all that.   (For those <br/>
locals wanting to picture this, he was coming south/downhill on Juan Tabo and it <br/>
happened just before the light at Comanche; they turned right onto Comanche.)   <br/>
  So...   He&#39;s following politely as as he should, and they speed up and take <br/>
off.   He pulls into a parking lot to look at the van.   Some part of the <br/>
plastic edges of the bumper cover (aren&#39;t cars irritating sometimes!?) is gone, <br/>
so he went back to the scene and retrieved it.<br/>
<br/>
NOW Kirby knows what can happen if you count too much on the magic of brakes. <br/>
  Now he KNOWS.   He was lucky not to get a ticket and a moving violation.   <br/>
He felt it was the other driver&#39;s fault, for doing some weird <br/>
stop-and-start-and-hesitate thing about maybe changing lanes.   I reminded him it&#39;s his job to <br/>
give all the cars in front of him room to do that very thing.<br/>
<br/>
So back to the reported 16-year-old rebellion factory...<br/>
<br/>
The conditions required to create rebellion don&#39;t exist at my house.<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling provides a good environment for a rebellion factory <br/>
to emerge.<br/>
<br/>
Holly (14 now) very seriously considered going to 8th grade.   She talked <br/>
about it for over a year, and a dozen times, we lurked around the middle school <br/>
when kids were arriving or leaving.   (Cameron Lovejoy went with us one day, so <br/>
we have a witness to Holly&#39;s fascination.)   Holly wasn&#39;t doing that out of <br/>
rebellion or a refusal to believe.   She wanted to learn about school and <br/>
schoolkids.   She wanted to see what she was missing.   <br/>
<br/>
A couple of all-day visits to another school (Sandia Prep) satisfied a lot of <br/>
her curiosity.   Discussion with friends who had done school and homeschool <br/>
both convinced her that home was good for her.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby, at 19, isn&#39;t a rebellion factory.<br/>
Marty, 16, isn&#39;t a rebellion factory.<br/>
Holly, 14, isn&#39;t a rebellion factory.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d mention that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Next time I need lunchtime reading I&#39;ll go to the unschooling blogring!<br/>
