<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118997630">**On the other hand, I always worry, too, about the fact that so many adults <br/>
have math anxiety/issues/phobias/hatred/fears/etc. that even unschooling <br/>
parents will, inadvertently, pass their own feelings along to their kids <br/>
without even realizing it.**<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of people who have acres of books without a single book on math <br/>
to be found. Or maybe a few lonely textbooks. They&#39;ve got the range of human <br/>
knowledge and questioning pretty well sampled on those shelves *except* for <br/>
this gaping hole. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t read very much about math or science as an adult.  I have the<br/>
lingering idea that it&#39;s going to be unpleasant, and too hard, like<br/>
hiking uphill.<br/>
<br/>
Can you recommend some enticing math books for an adult dabbler?<br/>

better, usually, than the books written FOR adults.<br/>
<br/>
Theoni Pappas&#39;s books are good. I just bought her book of math poems in two <br/>
voices - it isn&#39;t very good poetry though, which is disappointing. But they <br/>
were fun to read together anyway - we&#39;ll probably do it again once in a while.<br/>
Here is a website that has descriptions of Theoni Pappas&#39;s books: <br/>

Look around their website - look under General Mathematics - they have some <br/>
good stuff in there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702267235">Math Poems?!  How cool!  Can you share a short one with us - or, would <br/>
that be against copywright laws?<br/>
