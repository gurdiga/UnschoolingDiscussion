                     truth about this war&#39;<br/>

                     Reporter Correspondent<br/>
<br/>
                     DUMMERSTON, Vt. -- Sam Smith, editor of The Progressive<br/>
                     Review (prorev.com), recently offered what he called the<br/>
                     &quot;Standardized Conflagration Competency Exam.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
                     His 10 questions should be asked of everyone in the Bush<br/>
                     administration.<br/>
<br/>
                          1. In order to get rid of Saddam Hussein it is likely that<br/>
                          some Americans will be killed as well. How many do<br/>
                          you think is a reasonable number? How many is too<br/>
                          many?<br/>
<br/>
                          2. Some reports indicate that there are other people<br/>
                          living in Iraq besides Saddam Hussein. How many<br/>
                          would be worth killing in order to get rid of Hussein?<br/>
                          How many is too many? Does this also apply to those<br/>
                          who have no weapons of mass destruction in their<br/>
                          homes?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                          3. When will the Afghan invasion be over? How can we<br/>
                          tell?<br/>
<br/>
                          4. If we bomb Baghdad, some targets in the U.S. may be<br/>
                          hit in retaliation. Which of the following are<br/>
                          expendable in order to rid Iraq of Saddam Hussein?<br/>
                               The Sears Tower;<br/>
<br/>
                               The New York Stock Exchange;<br/>
<br/>
                               Hoover Dam;<br/>
<br/>
                               New York City;<br/>
<br/>
                               New York City excluding Manhattan;<br/>
<br/>
                               The New York Times and Washington Post<br/>
                               editorial offices; or<br/>
<br/>
                               The headquarters of the Council on Foreign<br/>
                               Relations<br/>
                          5. List the names of all relatives you consider<br/>
                          expendable in the effort to rid Iraq of Saddam Hussein.<br/>
<br/>
                          6. List those cities that could be damaged by chemical,<br/>
                          biological, or nuclear attack without discommoding<br/>
                          the New American Century.<br/>
<br/>
                          7. After we obliterate Iraq, how many more countries<br/>
                          do we need to invade?<br/>
<br/>
                          8. Are the people selling their stocks in the various<br/>
                          markets appeasers, hippies, and Stalinists? If not, why<br/>
                          are they so worried about war?<br/>
<br/>
                          9. How did you get to be so smart about military<br/>
                          operations?<br/>
<br/>
                          10. What can high level military doubters do to reach<br/>
                          your level of proficiency in these matters?<br/>
<br/>
                     Smith may be arch in the extreme with this little quiz, but the<br/>
                     essential truth of this exercise is undeniable; namely, how<br/>
                     much are the people who are gung ho for war willing to<br/>
                     sacrifice?<br/>
<br/>
                     As has been pointed out many times in the past few months,<br/>
                     the architects of this war - President Bush, Vice President<br/>
                     Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary of State<br/>
                     Powell, National Security Advisor Rice and foreign policy<br/>
                     underlings Wolfowitz, Perle and Armitage - have, with the<br/>
                     exception of Powell, no direct experience with war. None of<br/>
                     them have family members in the military. None of them<br/>
                     have made any visible sacrifice in the &quot;war on terror.&quot; Yet,<br/>
                     they are determined to plunge this nation into war.<br/>
<br/>
                     Yes, Saddam Hussein is evil and the world would be better off<br/>
                     without him. But how many American and Iraqis will have to<br/>
                     die in a preemptive, unprovoked war based on a threat that<br/>
                     the U.S. created?<br/>
<br/>
                     A reminder of the nonsense that was fed to us during the<br/>
                     runup to the first Persian Gulf War in 1990-91 is needed here.<br/>
<br/>
                     Begin with the unpleasant facts regarding relationship<br/>
                     between the U.S. and Iraq in the 1980s. There was a reason<br/>
                     why the U.S. decided to remove 8,000 pages from the dossier<br/>
                     that Iraq presented to the UN Security Council before sharing<br/>
                     it with the council&#39;s non-permanent members.<br/>
<br/>
                     As reported in December by the German newspaper Die<br/>
                     Tageszeitung, dozens of American companies and the U.S.<br/>
                     government itself provided assistance to Iraq in developing<br/>
                     nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. When Iraq used<br/>
                     chemical weapons during its 1980-88 war with Iran, the U.S.<br/>
                     looked the other way since the U.S. was hoping Iraq would<br/>
                     destroy Iran, or even better, both sides would destroy each<br/>
                     other.<br/>
<br/>
                     There also wasn&#39;t much concern at first in the summer of<br/>
                     1990 when Iraq threatened to invade Kuwait. April Glaspie,<br/>
                     the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, told Saddam Hussein in July<br/>
                     1990 that the U.S. had &quot;no opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts,<br/>
                     like your border agreement with Kuwait.&quot; Not surprisingly,<br/>
                     Saddam welcomed that statement and invaded Kuwait the<br/>
                     following month.<br/>
<br/>
                     President George H.W. Bush&#39;s national security team at first<br/>
                     didn&#39;t make much of a fuss about Saddam&#39;s actions. But the<br/>
                     hawk faction, led by then-Defense Secretary Cheney,<br/>
                     recognized an opportunity. It had only been a few months<br/>
                     after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of Soviet control of<br/>
                     Eastern Europe. With the Cold War ending, a war with Iraq<br/>
                     would be the first step toward creating a &quot;new world order&quot;<br/>
                     where the U.S. would be the unquestioned leader.<br/>
<br/>
                     This meant two things had to happen. One was that any<br/>
                     attempts at a diplomatic solution that would avert war must<br/>
                     be discouraged. The other was that Saddam Hussein had to be<br/>
                     demonized to the extent of becoming a second Adolf Hitler.<br/>
<br/>
                     One of the lasting images from the propaganda campaign was<br/>
                     the tearful testimony of a young Kuwaiti woman before a<br/>
                     Congressional committee that Iraqi soldiers had tossed<br/>
                     newborn babies out of hospital incubators in Kuwait and left<br/>
                     them to die. It was a riveting tale; it just wasn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
                     It wasn&#39;t until after the war that we found out the young<br/>
                     woman was really the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to<br/>
                     the U.S., and that her testimony was arranged by the<br/>
                     Washington-based public relations firm Hill & Knowlton as<br/>
                     part of a PR campaign funded by Kuwait to bring the U.S. into<br/>
                     the war.<br/>
<br/>
                     But this was just the tip of the misinformation iceberg. You<br/>
                     may recall the stories of Iraqi troops - anywhere between<br/>
                     200,000 and 500,000, depending on whose account you<br/>
                     heard - that were massed on the Saudi Arabian border and<br/>
                     poised to strike.<br/>
<br/>
                     The U.S. satellite photos that allegedly showed these troops<br/>
                     were part of the evidence used to justify a war with Iraq -<br/>
                     except that Russian satellite photos taken of the same area at<br/>
                     the same time showed no Iraqi troops. The U.S. photos are<br/>
                     still classified, and you can probably deduce the reason why.<br/>
<br/>
                     When the shooting war finally began on Jan. 16, 1991, the<br/>
                     press was kept away and only a totally sanitized, heavily<br/>
                     censored version of events was shown. The dominant image<br/>
                     came from the gunsight cameras - video game-like footage of<br/>
                     laser guided &quot;smart bombs&quot; hitting their targets. The reality<br/>
                     was that more than 90 percent of the 142,000 tons of<br/>
                     ordinance dropped on Iraq were old-fashioned, unguided<br/>
                     dumb bombs.<br/>
<br/>
                     One of those &quot;dumb&quot; bombs hit a factory in a Baghdad suburb<br/>
                     that produced infant formula. The U.S. claimed it was a<br/>
                     military installation. While the Iraqis may have been clumsy<br/>
                     in their counter-propaganda (like the big sign out front of the<br/>
                     plant that read &quot;BABY MILK FACTORY&quot; in English), the reality<br/>
                     - according to declassified U.S. State Department documents -<br/>
                     was that the plant did indeed produce baby milk.<br/>
<br/>
                     But the U.S. won that propaganda battle and avoided the<br/>
                     scrutiny that should have come from deliberately and<br/>
                     systematically targeting civilian infrastructure in the<br/>
                     bombing campaign - something that&#39;s in total violation of the<br/>
                     Geneva Convention prohibitions.<br/>
<br/>
                     Even the number of Iraqi causalities in Gulf War I have not<br/>
                     been truthfully reported. Part of it is U.S. reluctance to admit<br/>
                     the lopsidedness of the war. While there were only 79 U.S.<br/>
                     soldiers killed in action, it&#39;s estimated that more than 45,000<br/>
                     Iraqi soldiers and civilians died during the war.<br/>
<br/>
                     Then throw in the 100,000 Iraqis who died from the<br/>
                     post-war violence and disease. Throw on top of that the more<br/>
                     than 500,000 Iraqi children that have died from starvation<br/>
                     and disease in the decade after the war. And don&#39;t forget the<br/>
                     five million refugees the war produced.<br/>
<br/>
                     Most of the cast of characters that shaped Gulf War I are on<br/>
                     the national security team of George W. Bush and they have<br/>
                     been planning for Gulf War II almost since the first war<br/>
                     ended. And the lies from the first war are being amplified as<br/>
                     we head into the second.<br/>
<br/>
                     Have we seen an honest accounting of the extent that the<br/>
                     U.S., Britain, Germany and other Western countries aided the<br/>
                     Iraqi weapons program? Or of how many Iraqis died in the<br/>
                     first Gulf War? Or of the extent of the damage done to Iraq by<br/>
                     the war and the 11 years of economic sanctions and periodic<br/>
                     bombings? Or why are there 160,000 U.S. veterans of Gulf<br/>
                     War I receiving medical treatment for a variety of ailments<br/>
                     related to the various toxins they were exposed to in the war?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                     The answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
                     And then there are the fresh lies. For example, the Bush<br/>
                     administration recently lowered the estimated cost of Gulf<br/>
                     War II down to about $60 billion. Not because the cost has<br/>
                     gone down, mind you. The new lower cost of the war is pure<br/>
                     fiction dreamt up because the more realistic $200 billion<br/>
                     cost we heard a few months ago was deemed to be too scary.<br/>
<br/>
                     There is little debate that the world is better off without<br/>
                     Saddam Hussein, but the big question remains unanswered<br/>
                     by the people who are rushing us off to war. Is the effort to<br/>
                     get rid of him is worth the price that other people - and not<br/>
                     the architects of this new war - will have to pay?<br/>
