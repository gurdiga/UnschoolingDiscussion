<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440041444">You&#39;ve got them in the bedroom? I&#39;ve got three in my living room. My son&#39;s <br/>
bikes are too expensive to be on the porch or in the unlocked shed, so I <br/>
get them in the living room . . . sigh.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES.. and for the same reasons your son&#39;s are in the LR.   Dh does not want <br/>
them to get stolen or for them to be in the elements.    He has a collection of <br/>
over 50 bikes ( LOL, they are not all in the BR).. Most of them are hanging <br/>
in our garage and workshop.  He has 3 he keeps in the BR, lovingly draped with <br/>
sheets to keep the dust off..   I am so accustomed to having them in the BR, I <br/>
don&#39;t think twice about it.. but when a friend saw them parked up here, she <br/>
was befuddled.. LOL.. She said &quot; uh, does he think he can ride them in his <br/>
dreams&quot;&quot;  LOL.    She also said &quot;My Dh loves golf, but he doesnt take his clubs to <br/>
be with him&quot;  .   He also brings his &quot;projects&quot; up here to work on in his <br/>
little bike corner. It&#39;s warm and dry and he has a nice place to sit and he can <br/>
watch TV.     Hey, if anyone is in the market for a restored vintage <br/>
lightweight bike, you know who to email !  :-)<br/>
