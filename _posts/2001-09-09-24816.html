&lt;&lt; I went to 2 of Richard&#39;s workshops at the conference........very helpful.  <br/>
I would love to see him online but he can&#39;t seem to find anything.....or <br/>
anyone I should say to motivate him to communicate online.  Do you know of <br/>
any good message boards or such for kids??  He is 9 years old. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t press a nine year old to write ANYTHING.<br/>
(But then I don&#39;t press my 12 and 15 year olds either, and they write for fun <br/>
among friends.)<br/>
<br/>
Holly has gotten e-mail this month, and send instant messages to her <br/>
brothers&#39; friends, who have been generous and corresponded with her.  She <br/>
gets the iMac to read her what they&#39;ve written and she responds in small <br/>
words, asking for help with spelling.<br/>
<br/>
There are the kids&#39; message boards at www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
What my kids do is on AOL, a kind of D&D-style game run through chatrooms.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know of any just walk-in things.<br/>
<br/>
If your son plays video games, there&#39;s a forum for every system out there (m<br/>
ore than one sometimes) with question and answer places of some sort (message <br/>
boards sometimes).   Whether he writes anything or not, he&#39;s see what writing <br/>
would be good for (leaving questions, or answering other people&#39;s questions <br/>
if he knows the answers).<br/>
<br/>
Marty liked Ask Jeeves when he was first online.  Questions and answers about <br/>
all KINDS of things.<br/>
<br/>
I bet others here will have lots of ideas for where a nine year old could go <br/>
online.<br/>
