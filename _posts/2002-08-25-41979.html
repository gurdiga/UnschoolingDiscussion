 I wasn&#39;t talking about you. But I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t have any. [Hint: because <br/>

<br/>
Wow! That was the most incredibly rude thing I&#39;ve read in a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I really, really wish that Ned and Bob would stay off the list for a while, <br/>
just quit posting all together and READ what gets posted here when people <br/>
aren&#39;t being purposely offensive.<br/>
If you want to see what the typical ebb and flow of discussion is, read some <br/>
of the archives right before Ned came on board. It was nice. People were <br/>
talking about what works in their homes, what unschooling really looks like <br/>
and the joyful day to day events that paint a life.<br/>
PLEASE!! If you don&#39;t understand what this list is about, or the discussions <br/>
here, just read for a while until you get the feel for it.<br/>
There is some really destructive criticism of Sandra, Joyce and even HELEN <br/>
going on here which really floors me.<br/>
This is Helen&#39;s list, can&#39;t you just respect her request for how the list is <br/>
handled?<br/>
Sandra has been on it for years and DOES understand Helen&#39;s request.<br/>
Joyce is the moderator and has done a fabulous job at every turn.<br/>
It makes me ill to see these fabulous, strong and wise women get so much <br/>
disrespect in a forum that people come to just for their (and Pam, Elissa&#39;s, <br/>
Tia&#39;s etc...) wonderful views of unschooling.<br/>
I beg you to quit with the meanness and let the list get back to the <br/>
wonderful discussions it was having. Really.<br/>

It wasn&#39;t the rudeness that got to me so much as the total stupdity of the <br/>
denial.  To put my FULL NAME three times and then say it wasn&#39;t about me is <br/>
just like a PeeWee Herman response.  &quot;I know you are, but what am I?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just the sort of nonsense I&#39;m glad my kids get to avoid in their everyday <br/>
lives.  They&#39;re pretty much surrounded by people of good will who make sense. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560009409">The post on *GANGSTA* rap that I originally replied to was at the time the <br/>
most recent in a thread on Eminem, Marylin Manson, and some of the crudities <br/>
and controversies in popular music. Helen mentioned a long conversation with <br/>
her son that was sparked by one of Eminem&#39;s songs. That song is truly <br/>
brilliant. She also seemed pleased that her son had settled some things about <br/>
it after the talk. I found what she said to be inspiring. She is also <br/>
probably familiar with Stanley Crouch. (Am I looking for some sort of <br/>
advocate at this list -- you bet your ass. I won&#39;t hold my breath.)<br/>
<br/>
Regardless. Helen and the woman&#39;s (Pumpkin?) posts hit home with me. I have <br/>
played drums for a living since I was 14, much of it jazz, and I think about <br/>
this stuff all the time. It is a subject close to me as a professional and as <br/>
a parent and as a critic (at least in my own mind). <br/>
<br/>
I replied to Pumpkin, who *insightfully* and first-handedly pointed out that <br/>
the type of rap the thread was talking about -- the lewd, vulgar, <br/>
misogynistic, perverted, and antihuman &quot;gangsta&quot; type -- was &quot;perhaps best <br/>
enjoyed by those who don&#39;t have to personally deal with the reality that <br/>
fuels the lyrics.&quot; Will any of you deny the truth of what the she said? Will <br/>
any of you dare to confirm it?<br/>
<br/>
An aside: Don&#39;t lay this &quot;Lauren Hill, et al. are positive&quot; bullshit on me as <br/>
if I don&#39;t understand that there is a related element -- hip-hop -- that is <br/>
redeeming. That&#39;s not what the conversation was about. I&#39;m not fucking <br/>
clueless. Are you?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra was the only one who took the woman to task, thus Sandra set herself <br/>
up -- which is what you do at a list like this when serious topics get <br/>
broached -- to be questioned in return. I did just that and she took it as an <br/>
attack, or rather, me trying to &quot;shame&quot; her. <br/>
<br/>
If you go back and reread the post, you will see that it was NOT about <br/>
Sandra. Three specific statements she made got addressed by me in three small <br/>
paragraphs out of a rather large email, one in which I set out to confirm the <br/>
woman&#39;s original point. For Sandra to reply and chastise me as if the post <br/>
were an attack on her and not an assent to the woman&#39;s point about the <br/>
vicious cycle that the gangsta rap culture has spawned, tells me that she saw <br/>
her name and figured it all must be about her. This thus tells me she that <br/>
has an inflated idea of her own importance. I also named and quoted Stanley <br/>
Crouch three times, shall I send him a copy, seeing how it must be about him <br/>
as well? He&#39;ll love it. I&#39;ll send him all your replies along with it. <br/>
<br/>
Someone asked what gangsta rap (or any other antihuman aberrant art form, <br/>
which includes NIN, Marilyn Manson, neo-Nazi thrash metal, etc.) has to do <br/>
with unschooling? Everything. It is all round us. It is where we work, where <br/>
we shop, what we see at the movies. It isn&#39;t a black thing, and if I gave the <br/>
impression that I think it is, and that I hate it for that reason, then you <br/>
again misread me, and also missed my point about the four black artists.  <br/>
<br/>
It appears there are some sacred cows, or visions, at this list that can&#39;t <br/>
handle contrary ideas without becoming offended. If I have done the verbal <br/>
equivalent of raping your mothers, selling drugs to your sons, or <br/>
prostituting your daughters (all subjects celebrated in gangsta rap), I would <br/>
love to hear about it. I will truly repent at that point. <br/>

done with this) as I was just about to unsub from this list.  I really want <br/>
to find a place that can help me as we find our way into unschooling (we are <br/>
starting from &quot;preschool&quot; age)...but not in an enviroment like this.  I can&#39;t <br/>
even understand some of the posts...but I can understand the tone and it <br/>
isn&#39;t nice.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anyone will care about this...but I am a &quot;newbie&quot; and I do <br/>
need my hand held...especially in dealing with family.  I don&#39;t need to read <br/>
a bunch of arguing...I don&#39;t have time for it.<br/>
<br/>
I have read the HEM webpages finally (and requested a sample copy as I didn&#39;t <br/>
even know this mag existed) and some great articles from Sandra&#39;s site and <br/>
I&#39;m excited to have the possibility to learn first hand from her and Helen <br/>
and all the other more &quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers.  I&#39;ve bookmarked Ned&#39;s site <br/>
and others that were refered to me.  Sandra has already helped me look at the <br/>
way I think of my boys by her refering to the article on &quot;spoiled rotten&quot; <br/>
children (as I was the the one who said they were spoiled...meaning they have <br/>
many more things than I think they need and are constantly given more by <br/>
their grandparents.)  I feel like I could really learn a lot here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just one small person who hasn&#39;t been here very long...I&#39;d like to be <br/>
here for years...But my life is stressful enough without this.  It makes my <br/>
stomach hurt :(<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll deny it.  Who is she to decide what should be listened to in the <br/>
black community?  We are responsible for our choices.  Rap music does <br/>
not make anyone do anything.  It is insulting to suggest it does.  <br/>
And it&#39;s a copout for people who don&#39;t want to go into the ghetto and <br/>
effect real change.  Abusive rap is a symptom and a story of a <br/>
community.  The point is the truth hurts and some people don&#39;t want <br/>
to acknowledge what history has wrought.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you should change your focus.  Listen to what it&#39;s telling you <br/>
instead of shutting down because it&#39;s not sweet and light.  Calling <br/>
it antihuman is stupid.  The artist are human.  Anger is human.  <br/>
Anger fuels angry art, in all mediums.  Maybe you should concentrate <br/>
on WHY the anger is manifest.  Instead of WHAT the anger produces.  <br/>
That&#39;s the only way to get to HOW to change society.  And some <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;It appears there are some sacred cows, or visions, at this list that <br/>

<br/>
Imagine if I ever wrote this in seriousness:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The pornography that is christianity.  Christianity is a cesspool of <br/>
hypocrisy, rapist, money-grubbers and charletans.  What are they <br/>
selling to our youth?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
All of the above can be found in christianity but to paint that as <br/>
the whole of christianity is wrong.  Tell me you wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
offended.  And if I said I wasn&#39;t referring to the UU&#39;s which has <br/>
redeeming qualities you&#39;d dismiss me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145493075">Calm down.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have time to figure out the nuances of who meant what when they said<br/>
what so this is directed at whoever is guilty. Don&#39;t assume I mean you just<br/>
because I&#39;m directing this generally. Check to see if the shoe fits. If it<br/>
does, it&#39;s yours.<br/>
<br/>
If you (general) say &quot;you&quot; (specific) or someone&#39;s name, they&#39;re going to<br/>
take it personally. That&#39;s not a directive to stop saying &quot;you&quot;. It&#39;s a<br/>
simple cause and effect for those of us who don&#39;t pick up interpersonal<br/>
stuff as quickly as others.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t intend for it to sound personal, remember intent doesn&#39;t<br/>
come acros. Only our words do.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s drop the personal stuff and discuss the ideas -- which *might* be<br/>
censorship and the effects of media on society. There seems to be some major<br/>
confusion about what anyone means, so stating clearly what you *do* mean<br/>
rather than arguing that you didn&#39;t mean what someone says you mean would<br/>
help a great deal in moving the conversation along in a effective direction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tanya. I am another lurking &quot;newbie&quot; but have been on the list for <br/>
a several months now. And I have to say that I have learned *so* much<br/>
so far. My oldest son is 5.5 and we are &quot;opting out of kindergarten&quot; this<br/>
year (will be &quot;officially hsing next year). This list truly is a wonderful <br/>
resource and I have been finding myself doing a lot of re-thinking about ways<br/>
that I do things. Funnily enough, unschooling does not seem like a huge leap <br/>
for me, as I have seen over and over again how much my son learns without<br/>
anything &quot;formal&quot; from me (not completely there, but it is mostly working on<br/>
my mindset rather then my actions). What has been really &quot;rocking my world&quot;<br/>
has been looking at un-ing other aspects of my parenting...like tv restrictions,<br/>
junk food limitations, chores etc. Kind of exciting but scary too.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say that there is a lot to be gained here in between the bickering.<br/>
So don&#39;t give up! You might also check out unschooling.com...you can search the <br/>
archives (I just got finished reading all the messages related to tv limits!).<br/>
<br/>
Just a little support from another newbie who has been here long enough to see the<br/>
benefit!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are right of course...I have to read every one of the 100+ messages I <br/>
have today because I might miss something vital :)  I have a problem with <br/>
filtering.<br/>
<br/>
This list has provided much info and the conversation on grandparents is <br/>
exactly what I need to hear.  My inlaws are planning on paying for private <br/>
school.  (As if the problem is just public schools.)  I had thought of <br/>
sending the boys to a Montessori or Waldorf school but I don&#39;t totally agree <br/>
with either approach.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, without arguing people wouldn&#39;t be able to change their mind.  <br/>
If we were all the same it would probably be boring wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand I feel so comfortable with unschooling...look at what my son <br/>
who isn&#39;t even 2 1/2 has already learned...letters and numbers, shapes and <br/>
colors.  He loves books.  I mean it is astonishing and he learned it all by <br/>
unschooling (although I didn&#39;t realize it could be called that.)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my brother&#39;s first wife was unschooled and she couldn&#39;t <br/>
read until she was 14.  Her mother didn&#39;t do anything to try to make their <br/>
lives interesting (like trips to libraries or museums or whatever.)  5 of her <br/>
kids had no problem this way but my sis in law did.  So I worry about the <br/>
what ifs...and what I would do then.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to prove to me that it will work even though I &quot;know&quot; it will.  <br/>
After all, I&#39;ve never gotten a 4 yr degree but I know I&#39;ve learned more by <br/>
reading lots then some with degrees.<br/>
<br/>
I like this list...and I&#39;m glad that it has people on it who have lots of <br/>
experience :)<br/>
