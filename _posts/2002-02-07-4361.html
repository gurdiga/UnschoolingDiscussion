<div id="ygrps-yiv-164910971">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I thoroughly enjoy listening in on the rich conversations, but have little time to contribute, so thanks for helping me to grow even (especially?) in my silence.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, however, I have a question. Do any of you know of published sources that deal with homeschooling, ideally unschooling, in places other than the US? I know they exist, but my university library either doesn&#39;t carry or index the sources or I am not using good search terms. Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated! I am trying to prepare a paper that looks at homeschooling comparatively.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d prefer to reply to me off list, my address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jdeets@...">jdeets@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Jennifer<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know that they exist.  <br/>
Maybe in England.<br/>
<br/>
In Japan, the author of the book will probably be Kyoko, at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:owj@...">owj@...</a>.  <br/>
What she has so far is a Japanese translation of Linda Dobson&#39;s Homeschooling <br/>
Book of Answers.<br/>
<br/>
There are online things in England, but I don&#39;t know what there is in the way <br/>
of a &quot;real book.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
I have some international links at sandradodd.com/unschoolingotherwise<br/>
