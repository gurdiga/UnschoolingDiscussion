<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137169320"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;April <br/>
&gt;..............I have issues with some modern stories<br/>
&gt;that assume both parents work full time and the <br/>
&gt;kids go to school.  There are always stereotypes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree April.  I am careful about the books I select<br/>
for the kids, and I try to explain things that I think<br/>
are not in line with the values I want them to learn. <br/>
However at this age I try not to read them things with<br/>
conflicting values, since they are a bit too young (at<br/>
3 and 4) to understand historical context, and related<br/>
issues.  But I do like to choose books, both modern<br/>
and classic, that reflect the values, behaviors and<br/>
attitudes that I want my children to soak in.<br/>
<br/>
I have issues with modern tv and other forms of<br/>
entertainment that makes assumtions too.  I don&#39;t like<br/>
my kids watching shows like Franklin.  Franklin is<br/>
nice in a lot of ways, mildly paced, good themes,<br/>
healthy relationships between the characters.  But to<br/>
my mind they focus much to heavily on school.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want my kids thinking that they are &quot;supposed&quot; to go<br/>
to school and that they are strange if they don&#39;t.  I<br/>
am glad my kids do not watch commercial television<br/>
programming, as I know that in both the shows and the<br/>
ads there is a great deal of school emphasis. <br/>
<br/>
I know that all the school touting (School&#39;s Cool<br/>
programs, etc) is meant to get preschool kids excited<br/>
about attending public school and feel positive about<br/>
their impending prison sentance.  But I would just as<br/>
soon not subject my kids to that kind of brainwashing,<br/>
escpecially since they will not be attending.<br/>
<br/>

PS: (can you tell I am feeling better?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nanci, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re feeling better! And you really said this so well,<br/>
this is how I feel. It&#39;s interesting how the television portrays school, as<br/>
opposed to how kids actually experience it. Even on PBS, there&#39;s a<br/>
commercial (Frosted Flakes I think) that shows all the happy kids running<br/>
like crazy off the school bus so they can eagerly get to their classes.<br/>
Funny, that&#39;s not exactly how I remember it :-). And then there&#39;s the Magic<br/>
Schoolbus - my son loves the books, but it&#39;s hardly likely that kids in<br/>
public school will be getting anything resembling Ms. Frizzle!!<br/>

<br/>
And Barney--hanging around a school for fun, with a dinosaur, getting to use <br/>
all the puppets and costumes and art supplies (especially fun when Tomie <br/>
DePaola shows up to paint to music!)  My kids used to watch it when they were <br/>
little and I occasionally felt the need to announce that school isn&#39;t really <br/>
like that.<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes Dragontales a lot.  I was surprised to see it described on the <br/>
PBS parents&#39; listings as something for school prep.  I think it has to do <br/>
with preparing kids for social problems (friends, strangers, <br/>
arguments--interpersonal stuff).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348781072">I had a psychology teacher and (even more so) a<br/>
British Lit teacher like this, and it was so<br/>
wonderful... kids who were taking the class because<br/>
the ones they *really* wanted were full, the slouching<br/>
slackers in the back of the room, perked up nearly<br/>
immediately and became as involved as those of us who<br/>
*wanted* to be there.  Those were the best classes I&#39;d<br/>
had... I actually fainted once in psych class because<br/>
I was so interested in what the teacher was saying<br/>
that I forgot to breathe!  :D  We may have spent a<br/>
some time &#39;goofing around&#39;, but we also did a<br/>
*tremendous* amount of learning...  Those are the<br/>
teachers who inspire kids to go on to college, the<br/>
ones who make kids understand how really interesting<br/>
learning can really be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-825068103">I remember three good teachers, one was algebra (he made us into human<br/>
computers, that was koooolllll), one was history (we choose what we wanted<br/>
to read and he brought buckets of movies, subjects per our requests) and a<br/>
science teacher.  Now we had plenty of noisy and smelly experiments (it was<br/>
chemistry) but the most interesting part was what we learned about the<br/>
government (he had been in one of &quot;those&quot; government projects as a<br/>
scientist).<br/>

Earth science teacher. I have a collection of rocks, crystals and I think <br/>
working in my herb or veg. garden is the best. Thankfully it is something <br/>
that has been passed on to my youngest, she was 3yo and could tell you what <br/>
all the herbs in the garden was :) My other 2 could take it or leave it, and <br/>
thats ok too.<br/>

&gt;   I had a science teacher in jr. high that was so ms. frizzle! we had <br/>
&gt;classes<br/>
&gt;   outside, experiments that were messy and loud :)  I just remember her as <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;   coolest teacher i ever had.<br/>
&gt;   She also was considered by the other teachers as a slacker as our class <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;   loud with laughter and such.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; I know that all the school touting (School&#39;s Cool<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; programs, etc) is meant to get preschool kids excited<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; about attending public school and feel positive about<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; their impending prison sentance.  But I would just as<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; soon not subject my kids to that kind of brainwashing,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; escpecially since they will not be attending.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Nanci, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re feeling better! And you really said this so <br/>
&gt;well,<br/>
&gt;   &gt;this is how I feel. It&#39;s interesting how the television portrays <br/>
&gt;school, as<br/>
&gt;   &gt;opposed to how kids actually experience it. Even on PBS, there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;   &gt;commercial (Frosted Flakes I think) that shows all the happy kids <br/>
&gt;running<br/>
&gt;   &gt;like crazy off the school bus so they can eagerly get to their classes.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Funny, that&#39;s not exactly how I remember it :-). And then there&#39;s the <br/>
&gt;Magic<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Schoolbus - my son loves the books, but it&#39;s hardly likely that kids in<br/>
&gt;   &gt;public school will be getting anything resembling Ms. Frizzle!!<br/>
