<div id="ygrps-yiv-176354242">One of my indispensables is an office paper cutter - varying the<br/>
size of paper helps you see other possibilities; a completed work<br/>
can be cropped neatly;  and some projects, like the around here<br/>
beloved, paper chains really aren&#39;t a pain with the cutting being<br/>
handled in one slice equals 8 strips fashion.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect other folks have indispensables, things that they have<br/>
found by experience to be consistently useful and fun to have.<br/>
Not that I am ever looking to spend money, LOL, but I would love<br/>
to hear what those indispensables are in other homes.<br/>
<br/>
SNIP for context<br/>
| My son went through a phase of tiny drawings in the middle of<br/>
the paper.  I<br/>
| just cut the pieces in quarters.  He loved the size, it was<br/>
&quot;just right&quot; for<br/>
| what he saw in his mind&#39;s eye, and we got four drawings per<br/>
paper without me<br/>
| nagging about using all of the paper.<br/>

Oh the hot glue gun, definitely. I had never used one before I had kids, but <br/>
now we use it for every kind of craft imaginable. And with Casey around, <br/>
that&#39;s a lot of crafts. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Other indispensables are art supplies, library cards, reference books, the <br/>
computer/internet, fiction books, magazines and passes to local museums, <br/>
pools, zoos, etc.<br/>
