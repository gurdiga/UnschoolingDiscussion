<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119315801">I think spelt is a word that was spelled -no pun intended-spelt until early <br/>
this century. You have just been reading those Little House books to the <br/>
littles and it stuck in your head!I always spelled color colour in school and <br/>
got it marked wrong but i thought it was prettier! Today my 5yo son asked for <br/>
the report card to put in the atm! i love this stuff and think life would be <br/>
pretty boring without it!<br/>
