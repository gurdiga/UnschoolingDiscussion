I have been lurking for a while, but I couldn&#39;t resist this. I decided<br/>
before I had my first child, who is now almost 21 y-o, that I would not mess<br/>
with &quot;training pants&quot;. I made that decision after only one time seeing a<br/>
woman at church change her child who was wearing &quot;training pants&quot; and he had<br/>
pooped them. In the process of removing them, the poop got smeared all over<br/>
his legs - it was an awful mess to clean up. I decided right then and there<br/>
that my kids would come out of diapers when they were ready and we wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be messing with poopy training pants. My oldest was the easiest. For some<br/>
reason, my ds didn&#39;t have a clue what I was talking about when I tried to<br/>
talk to him about the potty, even by the age of three, so I let him run<br/>
around the house one day with a bare bottom, and I followed him everywhere<br/>
he went. He started to potty while he was playing, and I said &quot;stop! do that<br/>
in the potty!&quot; Then I scooped him up and took him to the bathroom, sat him<br/>
on the toilet, and told him he could finish there. That was it! After that<br/>
he only wore diapers to bed or when we went on trips. The day my only<br/>
daughter turned two, she said that she wasn&#39;t going to wear diapers anymore<br/>
because she was a big girl. She did real good for about 2 weeks, then<br/>
decided that it was too much trouble to come in from playing everytime she<br/>
had to go. So she asked for her diapers back. Much to my mother&#39;s<br/>
aggravation, I complied. She still used the potty occasionally, but stayed<br/>
in diapers until she was 3. At that time, she wanted to take dance lessons.<br/>
I told her they didn&#39;t let kids in diapers take dance lessons. She never<br/>
wore another diaper! She had the physical ability before then, but not<br/>
enough desire. Her desire for dance lessons was greater than her reluctance<br/>
to have playtime interupted for the potty, so ... she gave up the diapers.<br/>
<br/>
So I can whole heartedly agree with Sandra, that they will use the potty<br/>
when they have both the physical/mental ability, and the desire.<br/>

I was reading your post and wondered if the women in<br/>
the church removed the training pants as if it was<br/>
underwear?   LOL My girlfriend did it that way and it<br/>
smeared everywhere.  I had to explain to her that your<br/>
supose to rip them on the side like you would diapers!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I loved them because I didn&#39;t have to worry about the<br/>
tape not sticking. Iused them instead of diapers.<br/>

is what has worked for me with diapers.  And as I said, I was presupposing <br/>
readiness.  Even when mine have been ready, there have been some messes.  <br/>
That just goes along with the territory, as far as I&#39;m concerned.  Diapers <br/>
weren&#39;t the point of my post.<br/>

You can &quot;make&quot; a child &quot;do math.&quot;  They do it all the time in school.  That <br/>
means you can cause them by threat or force or shame or whatever to sit and <br/>
put numbers on a piece of paper.  But they&#39;re not really doing anything <br/>
themselves, and you can make them loathe numbers on paper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976054005">Hazel, I did this too. I was home a lot when I had babies, so I mostly used<br/>
cloth, especially when they were infants. But when going out, changing a<br/>
poopy cloth diaper is the worst! A disposable is great for neatly<br/>
&quot;containing&quot; all the mess and then throwing the whole thing away. I feel I<br/>
at least did my small part for the environment using cloth diapers, as much<br/>
as I did. LOL!<br/>

  You can &quot;make&quot; a child &quot;do math.&quot;  They do it all the time in school.  That <br/>
  means you can cause them by threat or force or shame or whatever to sit and <br/>
  put numbers on a piece of paper.  But they&#39;re not really doing anything <br/>

  How true! How true!!  <br/>
   (example): My son was an A student in spelling when he went to public school, BECAUSE, we started on Sunday night MEMORIZING the spelling words for that week.  We studied EVERY NIGHT unbtil spelling test on Friday, using little rhythm games and such to instill these words in his mind.  FORCE!!  2 weeks later he couldn&#39;t spell 50% of them.  Force does not constitute LEARNING!   Being Forced  to put numbers on paper does not teach them to *THINK* math!  <br/>
  I&#39;ve found that building things helps us  to learn math better than anything we do.  We&#39;ve built Bluebird houses from old barn lumber, bird feeders, etc.  We even remodeled his bedroom and expanded it to include space for his personal things (stereo, computer, guitar amps, etc.)   He is so capable of doing almost anything when left to his own *drive* and interests.  Whereas now  it is next to IMPOSSIBLE to FORCE him to do anything  since he has experienced the joy of learning on his own.  The joy of UNSCHOOLING!!!!  <br/>
  Still haven&#39;t decided what I&#39;m to do about TN regulations next year but I know we&#39;re not going back to *structured* learning.  (Books and papers, tests and grades that sort of thing.)  <br/>
