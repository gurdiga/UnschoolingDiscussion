  I&#39;m pretty sure I tolerated dh&#39;s really, really Southern Gothic family long <br/>
enough to get &quot;hooked&quot; because everytime I visited them they served copious <br/>

&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president,<br/>
 or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only <br/>
unpatriotic and servile, <br/>
but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>
