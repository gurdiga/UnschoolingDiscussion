&lt;&lt; If you&#39;re ever near Portland (we&#39;re just south of there)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tigard, Lake Oswego?<br/>
I may have to look you up if we get up there one of these years, I&#39;ve never <br/>
done a factory tour!<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Technically we are in Lake Oswego, that&#39;s what the address says. LOL  We are <br/>
right across the freeway from Tigard and Tualitin, smack dab between both.<br/>
<br/>
We would love to hear from you if you&#39;re ever this way!  Patricia said she <br/>
would love to show other unschoolers around the plant and if you have time <br/>
come over to our place to visit.<br/>
