 <br/>
 No one has told me &quot;it&#39;s okay&quot;.  What they did was introduce me to an idea<br/>
 that struck me to the core, that resonated so deeply within me I knew it was<br/>
 Truth.  I have read many books on the topic because it is near and dear to<br/>
 my heart.  I point those books out to others because the authors express<br/>
 themselves so much better than I do.<br/>
 <br/>
 I am not a follower.  I am not a groupie.  I am not of the herd mentality.<br/>
 I am a seeker of Truth and trust my soul to recognize it when it is<br/>
 encountered.<br/>
