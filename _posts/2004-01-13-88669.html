OK I am on a messege board for people with small babies. I found that there <br/>
were some homeschoolers there, so we talked about our schooling and I told <br/>
them that I unschooled. Now some of the other group members have kinda told <br/>
me that its wrong and just now one of them told me that only people with <br/>
higher education should unschool, and that you must be a very smart person <br/>
to unschool. Do all of you have higher education and are you &quot;Gifted&quot;. One <br/>
girl told me that I was limited and that I shouldnt homeschool/unschool <br/>
cause Im holding my son back.<br/>
Im so hurt by these women. We have all been together since we got pg, last <br/>
dec!<br/>

*************************<br/>
These people are telling you that you&#39;re not SMART enough to unschool your <br/>
children?????<br/>
<br/>
Wendy, sweetie, the only response to that is &^%$#%^*))^% YOU!<br/>
<br/>
Dump &#39;em. Be where people are nice to you. Be where people respect you.<br/>
<br/>
Come to the conference if you can. Otherwise, find other places to be.<br/>

the car? We had to sing to him so much that first year that I actually got <br/>
sick of singing. &lt;g&gt; The radio or tapes didn&#39;t do it. It had to be real <br/>
live voices in the car.<br/>
