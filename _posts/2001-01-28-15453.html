<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733913768">Hi! I originally sent this message on the 17th, and have never seen it post.<br/>
I also sent another message to an indidual who never received it, at the same <br/>
time.<br/>
So.. I&#39;m resending, and if you&#39;ve all seen it before, I do apologize!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve got that &quot;coming home&quot; feeling right now.<br/>
The line from Rocky Mt High.. &quot;Coming home to a place you&#39;ve never been <br/>
before&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I am soooo glad to have found this group.  It feels wonderful.<br/>
My name is Laura, husband Chip, we&#39;ve been married almost 15 years.<br/>
We have three kids. Jeremy, 9.  Emily,7 and Luke 4 in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
My parents gave me this lifestyle the best they could in the 70&#39;s.  But it<br/>
was illegal in Illinois to homeschool.  So off I went to school, to get my <br/>
sleep.<br/>
When I got home, thats when the learning started.  <br/>
My mom is an artist, and I was constantly exposed to great works of art, <br/>
incredible<br/>
music and very eclectic forms of any kind of art.<br/>
We watched movies galore, classics.  Educational, historical, I LOVE epics.<br/>
(And Mel Gibson being in many epics these days kept that interest up..ahem.)<br/>
In 1976, they took me on the best vacation they could think of....<br/>
I was taken to Williamsburg Virginia for a re enactment of several battles<br/>
of the Revolutionary War.  I came home with a love for that period that has<br/>
remained my entire life.  I knew more about this time frame than did my<br/>
history teacher.  A fact that at first upset him, then he was intrigued and <br/>
was invited to my home for dinner.  He thanked my parents for instilling a <br/>
love<br/>
of  history in my life.  Maybe at the time, I didn&#39;t appreciate what he meant.<br/>
Now I do.  It was very touching.<br/>
<br/>
So, the minute Jeremy was born, I looked at this beautiful little boy and <br/>
thought..<br/>
&quot;No way will I turn him over to quacks in five years!&quot;  It was literally one <br/>
of my first<br/>
thoughts (after having cried my eyes out!)<br/>
<br/>
So we set out to learn about homeschooling.  I&#39;ve enjoyed the Charlotte Mason<br/>
method and a few pre packaged curriculums, and the book &quot;the Well Trained <br/>
Mind&quot;.<br/>
The book actually gave me great ideas on the kids keeping notebooks on worms<br/>
and such!  <br/>
But, I always fell away from what I was doing, no matter how much I enjoyed <br/>
it.<br/>
I found the kids saying &quot;Awwww&quot; when I called them to &quot;do school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I had heard of unschooling, but so many had acted like it was a &quot;too far out&quot;<br/>
idea ..that I had not looked seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s Jeremys year to be tested in the state of Colorado.  So I find <br/>
myself<br/>
getting nervous.  He does NOT know the things other third graders around here<br/>
know.  BUT.. he knows SOME high school level things, too.  I worried that<br/>
they would test him just like they test the others, and that the areas he is<br/>
truly talented in, would not even be asked about.  So, I looked into<br/>
West River Academy in Grand Junction, CO.  Peggy sent me info and told<br/>
me to look at the Unschooling.com website.  YIPEE!<br/>
(BTW, anyone here that uses West River Academy??)<br/>
<br/>
Like minded people!  I&#39;m NOT lazy!  hahhahahahha.. boy does that feel good!<br/>
A perfect example of how unschooling works.  We like the Math U See <br/>
curriculum.<br/>
Multiplication was just not clicking with Jeremy so I gave myself permission <br/>
to<br/>
just put it away.  I would simply ask him a question once in awhile, and if he<br/>
hesitated, I would supply the answer, offering a brief explanation of how I <br/>
got the<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
About two weeks after starting this, Jeremy was playing with his stuffed <br/>
animal<br/>
collection on his top bunk.  He began arranging them in groups of three.<br/>
At 11 pm that night, he came flying out of his room, yelling &quot;Three, Three <br/>
times!<br/>
That&#39;s NINE!&quot;  And took us in to show us the different groupings  and how they<br/>
represented numbers, etc.  <br/>
I was elated.  Not only did he know multiplication, but he SAW how it worked,<br/>
he didn&#39;t just blindly memorize answers!<br/>
The next day he happily sat down and filled in about 4 chapters of his math <br/>
book,<br/>
willingly, without being asked!<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE this!<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet you all!<br/>

I did see your intro the first time you posted it. We&#39;ll blame it all on<br/>
Yahoo :). Nice to meet you again!<br/>
