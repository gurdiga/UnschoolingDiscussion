<div id="ygrps-yiv-648306447">I disagree that anytime you physically touch someone without their<br/>
permission that this is abuse.There are many kinds of touch,Some good<br/>
,some bad.What about little kids who out of anger push or slap at their<br/>
siblings,etc..I am not saying this is right,but this is not abuse.<br/>
I am a survivor of abuse,I know what its like to have a parent<br/>
discipline out of his own issues,and sickness.I also know that I have<br/>
raised 4 sons,and when they were younger,did spank them occasionally for<br/>
major infractions.I don&#39;t believe a child should be spanked for every<br/>
little thing.I see a lot of teens today whose parents raised them with<br/>
no discipline,and just used the psychobabble approach,and they could<br/>
have used a good swat in my opinion when they were younger.Of course as<br/>
my sons got older a spanking was no longer necessary.Again,everyone is<br/>
going to have different opinions on this topic.However no one is going<br/>
to convince me that a spanking from time to time is going  to be<br/>
considered abuse....Deb<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225489124">Ok, yet another one here that was going to stay out of this one, but can&#39;t<br/>
help myself. I am not here to agree or disagree with anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I am here to say that even though I have been quite tolerant and patient of<br/>
these emails filling my inbox these last few days, it&#39;s a bit tiring seeing<br/>
some really judgmental and quite rude statements. Everybody does things<br/>
differently, and what works for some doesn&#39;t work for all. I can understand<br/>
soapboxes, and how people feel very passionately about certain things. But<br/>
all of the rudeness has gotten to the point that it&#39;s embarrassing to think<br/>
that anyone would visit this list to subscribe and see so much harshness and<br/>
downright meanness. It&#39;s one thing to make room for other&#39;s views and also<br/>
to disagree with them. It&#39;s another to be so intolerant and rude. I&#39;m weary<br/>
of all of this, and yes Dia, I have given you some attention that you seem<br/>
to be needy of by directing this email toward you, as it&#39;s mainly your<br/>
defensive, aggressive, condescension that I am addressing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m sure this email won&#39;t make a bit of difference to some, but there<br/>
are so many other topics that we can introduce rather then allowing some of<br/>
this rudeness to continue.<br/>
<br/>
Dia, could you possibly reply to someone&#39;s email without dissecting it and<br/>
flaming them? (and if you want to copy and paste this into an email with<br/>
excerpts from other emails that you have replied to without flaming someone,<br/>
feel free).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permission, it could be constituted as abuse&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;.  Accidental contact is one thing and that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is not what I was talking about.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; These are two different statements.  The first is what I was replying<br/>
to.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You said &quot;anytime&quot;.  On another list I probably would have realized that<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; writer was exaggerating somewhat, here I just don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s like<br/>
&gt; jumping<br/>
&gt; &gt; into a group of pirahnas.  I am very glad that you don&#39;t scream &quot;abuse&quot;<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone bumps you in line.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Spanking is intentionally hurting someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in a way that is not acceptable. &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It may not be acceptable in your opinion, that does not mean that it is<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; acceptable to everyone.  Your opinion is not the only one in existence.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You are humiliating your child any time you lay a hand on them.  Trust<br/>
&gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been one of those children.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am not humiliating my child, I am correcting my child.  I was beaten<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; child, and I know full well the difference between beating and spanking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; No, I don&#39;t trust you.  Not even a little bit.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;No, I don&#39;t ask my children&#39;s permission to correct them.  I also don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;correct them using physical means.  Accidental contact is one thing and <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;is not what I was talking about.  Spanking is intentionally hurting someone<br/>
&gt;in a way that is not acceptable.  I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t give in on this one.<br/>
&gt;You are humiliating your child any time you lay a hand on them.  Trust me,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been one of those children.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I disagree with you.  Anytime you physically touch someone without <br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; permission, it could be constituted as abuse.  Isn&#39;t that what we <br/>
&gt;teach<br/>
&gt; &gt;our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; children when they are playing with their friends?&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am not just one of my children&#39;s friends, I am their mother and it is <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt;job to train them and teach them.  I do not need the permission of my<br/>
&gt; &gt;children to administer correction.  Do you seriously ask permission from<br/>
&gt; &gt;your children before you correct them?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And no, I do not think anytime someone touches another without permission<br/>
&gt; &gt;it<br/>
&gt; &gt;is abuse.  I have been bumped into, had my feet stepped on, and hugged<br/>
&gt; &gt;without my permission, and would in no way consider those abuse.  People<br/>
&gt; &gt;accidentally bump into, step on, and even knock others over on a regular<br/>
&gt; &gt;basis.  It doesn&#39;t mean they are abusers.  Lighten up!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
