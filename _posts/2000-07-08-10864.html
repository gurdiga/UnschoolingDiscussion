&lt;&lt; Yes and doubly hard when this is my oldest and I can&#39;t very well leave the <br/>
baby to his own devices while brother calms down.  Also his over-stimulation <br/>
often happens when it is just he and I, or his brother and him, or the three <br/>
of us.  No tv, no radio on, no telephone ringing, a quiet <br/>
street/neighborhood, and maybe 1 neighbor child to play with, occassionally.  <br/>
He is Soooooooo sensative.  He needs to be alone, IMHO, because he was <br/>
already with us and that was too much apparently.  I hate to imagine what <br/>
would happen if I was going to send him to school.  Good thing I decided to <br/>
homeschool before he was ever concieved.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nanci, my oldest son is also extremely sensitive.  He actually does better on <br/>
days where my dh is not home-- sounds awful,  I know.  The thing is, he needs <br/>
the comfort of our routine, and when dh is home, the routine  is thrown off.  <br/>
Then my son gets easily overstimulated, and fatigued.   He is best in his own <br/>
surroundings with little interruption at this time in his life.  He loves to <br/>
be *in control*, because he finds security in that.  He enjoys having 1-3 <br/>
friends over, but again, wants to be &quot;in charge&quot; of what&#39;s going on! ~Karen</div>

high-end symptoms of autism, perhaps Aspergers.  Or maybe it&#39;s <br/>
just an &#39;eldest-child&#39; syndrome...<br/>
