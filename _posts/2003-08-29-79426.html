<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909269228">Hi<br/>
<br/>
You might remember that my youngest, Katie, is a &quot;late starting <br/>
reader&quot; whose lateness in reading has been something of a worry to <br/>
me, but not as much recently (since researching the subject)<br/>
<br/>
Okay. She has made friends with the lady who runs the concession <br/>
stand at the swimming pool. In the course of their visits, Katie <br/>
mentioned she doesn&#39;t read yet, which worried the concession lady. <br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong: I think she is just trying to help, and with my <br/>
permission, introduced me to a phonics teacher. (I like phonics. <br/>
Please don&#39;t jump me on this.) So I visited with the phonics teacher, <br/>
and thought her phonics program was pretty impressive (maybe I like <br/>
phonics because I like analyzing things, breaking things down to <br/>
minute details...maybe that&#39;s it...) <br/>
<br/>
The phonics teacher told me that she tutors adults. 18 to 68 year <br/>
olds who haven&#39;t ever learned to read.<br/>
<br/>
So, I know what this list would think of pushing the reading w/the <br/>
phonics program, no matter HOW much I like it &lt;G&gt; This is what you <br/>
would say &quot;She&#39;ll pick up the reading. Our kids all picked up reading <br/>
without formal reading instruction.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t panic&quot; &quot;Quite Stressing&quot; <br/>
and words much like these.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I trust that it will happen with Katie, and in fact am <br/>
seeing a little bit already, as she reads once in awhile, single <br/>
words or short phrases, without prompting from anyone.<br/>
<br/>
However, what about these adults who have never learned? If reading <br/>
is picked up freely, without lessons, why would some get to adulthood <br/>
unable to read? Pressure? Wrong teaching methods (the phonics lady&#39;s <br/>
answer, btw.)? This woman was hesitant to use labels...she wasn&#39;t <br/>
willing to accept &quot;dyslexia&quot; as a common problem, believing that <br/>
phonics instruction would eliminate 99% of &quot;dyslexia&quot; problems. <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is, she wasn&#39;t your typical &quot;Find a problem <br/>
and fix it&quot; type. She is just interested in people knowing how to <br/>
read, and frustrated that the school system doesn&#39;t teach English <br/>
phonically, seeing as how English is an alphabetic system. (as <br/>
opposed to pictographic)...which I agree with. Written English is <br/>
break-downable...letters, syllables, words...<br/>
<br/>
anyways.<br/>
<br/>
We won&#39;t be buying the system, I&#39;m almost sure, unless it be to <br/>
receive the training and me become a neighborhood reading tutor for <br/>
extra cash! LOL <br/>
<br/>
but what about these adults who can&#39;t read? how did that happen, if <br/>
reading is inevitable, lessons or no lessons?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe they were pushed into it too early.  Maybe they put up a huge <br/>
wall of resistance after being shamed and made to feel stupid and it <br/>
got thicker through the years.<br/>
Maybe no one ever valued reading in their lives.  <br/>
Maybe they were too busy avoiding abuse to give it much time.<br/>
Maybe they had horrible teachers that couldn&#39;t see beyond &quot;just one <br/>
way to learn&quot;, and gave up before even getting started.<br/>
Maybe they started believing that they were stupid or &quot;slow&quot; and <br/>
accepted it and gave up.<br/>
There are a multitute of reasons.<br/>
I have never heard of a child in a home where reading is a part of <br/>
their every day existance;  looked at as enjoyable and beneficial, <br/>
where the child is respected and valued and trusted, and that child <br/>
never learning to read. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reading is inevitable in a nuturing atmosphere where the person sees a need<br/>
to read.<br/>
<br/>
Adult non-readers are almost universally schooled and may come from homes<br/>
where reading wasn&#39;t valued or was looked down on.<br/>
<br/>
The single biggest factor I believe in kids not reading is pressure to read<br/>
too early. They pick up that they are dumb because they can&#39;t do what<br/>
&quot;everyone else&quot; can. So many decide they&#39;re too dumb to read or, to protect<br/>
their self-esteem, that reading itself is dumb.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers, even specialists in a particular field of learning, are experts<br/>
*only* on schooled kids who have school goals to meet by a specific age.<br/>
They don&#39;t realize that those kids aren&#39;t natural kids. They don&#39;t realize<br/>
that school is a huge contributing factor in the children&#39;s behavior because<br/>
school, like oxygen, is apparently universal. They have no idea what a<br/>
natural child is like.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with the list Joanna gave :)  and want to add: <br/>
What about the people for whom the accepted *system of teaching* at the time <br/>
did not work?  I was fortunate to learn to read at a time when *Whole <br/>
Language* was popular, I was able to combine sight words AND phonics, which worked <br/>
great for *me.*  I know the pendulum has swung aaaallll the way over to a <br/>
*Phonics Only* approach as of late, and as I don&#39;t see English as a phonetic language <br/>
(unlike Spanish, for example), this approach would not work for me ~ the <br/>
woman who claimed to really enjoy &quot;Choppin&#39;s&quot; music (I had only *heard* the name <br/>
Chopin, never read it, so I had no idea this word meant &quot;Show-pan&quot;), as an <br/>
adult, in front of other adult educators.  Had I been a child, the humiliation <br/>
alone would have stopped my desire to speak out.  There are so many examples of <br/>
this in our hodgepodge language, I think it is a disservice to children, or <br/>
people of any size, to expect them to know when to apply phonics and when not to, <br/>
if that is all they&#39;re offered.  <br/>
<br/>
(scooting my soap box off to the side &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I think, too, that children *do* learn what is important for them in their <br/>
lives at that moment.  I&#39;m sure the illiterate adults have amazing talents <br/>
(albeit survival talents for some) that replaced the need for or the time for <br/>
learning to read.  My dad quit school in 6th grade. His writing and reading are <br/>
awful, they were not valued in his community, but his storytelling is amazing!  <br/>
I&#39;ll fill out his paperwork for him, as long as he continues to talk :)  <br/>

Reading is inevitable if it&#39;s valued and if NOT-YET-reading is not shamed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50852028">This is a rough draft of an article I&#39;m writing for the HUG web site <br/>
that might be of interest.  I might add that I taught various foreign <br/>
languages through interaction to children for 4 years and I was the <br/>
director of the MetLife Learning Center at a Boys and Girls Club <br/>
where one of my responsibilities was to tutor the ps kids who were <br/>
having problems with reading.  That just strengthened by belief in <br/>
unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Reading Acquisition<br/>
<br/>
     I don&#39;t know how my children learned to read.  I certainly <br/>
didn&#39;t teach them in the traditional sense nor did I look closely <br/>
enough at the process to see exactly what was happening as they were <br/>
learning.  As an unschooler, someone who trusts in a child&#39;s ability <br/>
to learn, I just know that at three different ages my older children <br/>
began to read.   <br/>
<br/>
     Now my fourth and youngest child is learning to read.  As I <br/>
observe her, I realize that she is also progressing without <br/>
anyone &quot;teaching&quot; her.  When I began noticing how she was learning to <br/>
read, I didn&#39;t have a grasp of or a word for the whole process.  I <br/>
toyed with different terms and phrases such as &quot;discovering reading&quot; <br/>
but none of these seemed right.  I finally found the word I needed <br/>
quite by accident.  <br/>
<br/>
     As I was searching for quotes that demonstrated how children <br/>
acquire their spoken language, I found a study that described the <br/>
interaction involved with acquiring language. The process was exactly <br/>
like the process I was observing in my daughter as she began to <br/>
read.  She was &quot;acquiring&quot; reading.  And why not?  Reading is simply <br/>
written language.<br/>
<br/>
     We don&#39;t need to &quot;teach&quot; our babies to talk.  Human beings, <br/>
barring any great disability, are &quot;hard wired&quot; for language.  Grammar <br/>
isn&#39;t taught by understanding rules and memorizing exceptions.  Verbs <br/>
don&#39;t have to be conjugated in any tense.  If we were to try to teach <br/>
children their primary language in this way, language acquisition <br/>
would undoubtedly be stunted.  Language, including rules of grammar <br/>
and the meaning of words, is assimilated as children interact with <br/>
people who are using spoken language.  <br/>
<br/>
    My experience has led me to believe that reading, just like <br/>
speaking, is an innate ability of human beings.  Reading begins when <br/>
the level of mental and physical development is reached that allows <br/>
the assimilation of written language rather than any specific <br/>
instruction the child is given as long they are exposed to a literate <br/>
environment.  Instruction in reading may at times hinder this natural <br/>
process making reading seem difficult.  Children learn to read <br/>
despite, rather than because of, instruction.  <br/>
<br/>
     Although children cannot learn to read if they are isolated from <br/>
reading, they do learn to read by interaction with others.  Educators <br/>
already know that reading to a child will help guarantee reading <br/>
success.  They attribute this to the example that the parent is <br/>
setting.  But could it possibly be that this reading time, even <br/>
before the child starts &quot;learning&quot; to read, is the foundation for the <br/>
interaction necessary for reading acquisition?<br/>
<br/>
     So how does a child &quot;acquire&quot; reading through interaction?  <br/>
There are many ways and one of the problems with &quot;teaching&quot; reading <br/>
is that some of these methods get pushed to the side.  Allowing <br/>
children access to adults who will read to them, answer their <br/>
questions and support them in their endeavors will cover all the <br/>
bases of reading acquisition.<br/>
<br/>
     These are some of the processes that I have noticed as I&#39;ve <br/>
observed my daughter:<br/>
<br/>
     Asking what a word says.  This is not unlike the &quot;look-see&quot; <br/>
method that has fallen out of favor though it is less formal.  It <br/>
does, however, have its merits.  Every parent has been asked by their <br/>
child what a word says.  If by listening to whole sentences, children <br/>
can grasp the rules of grammar then there are also ways to start to <br/>
grasp the rules of reading by being told what a word says.  I have <br/>
never made my children sound out words when they asked what a word <br/>
was.  Many times they have repeated a word slowly after being told, <br/>
following the letters as they say the word.  This actually seems a <br/>
very pleasurable activity for them and goes against conventional <br/>
beliefs- the word is read and then the child sounds it out on their <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
     Asking what sound a letter makes.  This is informal phonics and <br/>
also has a place in reading acquisition.  No one can deny that the <br/>
letters correspond with sounds and that those sounds are the clue to <br/>
the meaning of what is written.  It is when we only concentrate on <br/>
letters that we don&#39;t allow children to learn the exceptions <br/>
naturally. Children seem more interested in words than letters when <br/>
they begin exploring written language.  This is just the opposite of <br/>
how reading through phonics is taught but it makes more sense.  Words <br/>
have meaning; letters do not.  As children search out meaning they <br/>
are going to look for the method that brings that meaning into focus.<br/>
<br/>
     Reading what a child already knows.  Children often read through <br/>
a book that they&#39;ve memorized because someone else has read it to <br/>
them over and over.  I watched as my children read through their <br/>
scripts for the many plays they did and, even though the words were <br/>
completely memorized, they read slowly, sounding out the words and <br/>
absorbing the rules of reading.  Sometimes they would ask for help <br/>
with a word that they were stuck on even though the entire passage <br/>
was memorized.<br/>
<br/>
     Real life reading.  Much of the way we use writing in real life <br/>
is not in book form.  Shopping lists, quick notes to tell someone we <br/>
love them, the entertaining comics in the newspaper or phone messages <br/>
are all good examples.  Our society is a literate one and a child who <br/>
is allowed a fulltime place in the real world will be surrounded by <br/>
positive and useful reading experiences.  ***Unfortunately, the <br/>
school classroom is one of the most literarily sterile environments <br/>
there is.  Perhaps this explains why there is a problem with teaching <br/>
reading in the schools.***<br/>
<br/>
     Writing.  Children have a strong urge to communicate.  They love <br/>
to their write names and their friend&#39;s names as well other words <br/>
that have meaning to them.  By giving them plenty of writing tools <br/>
and paper they will explore written language all on their own.  <br/>
Through this process, the whole reason behind written language <br/>
becomes obvious.<br/>
<br/>
     Treating reading mistakes positively. An observation by one <br/>
linguist struck me as interesting.  Adults tend to accept or treat <br/>
positively mistakes that young children make in speech.  One of the <br/>
sentences that was used as an example was &quot;There&#39;s a tree-knocker <br/>
outside.&quot;  When a small child makes this mistake we will either let <br/>
is pass (&quot;Oh, yes there is!&quot;) because the important part of this <br/>
communication is the excitement of a bird and the name doesn&#39;t matter <br/>
or we will use the word properly (&quot;Oh, yes!  A woodpecker.&quot;) to set a <br/>
good example without correcting the child&#39;s speech.  I have always <br/>
done the same with my children as they read to me.  The mistakes <br/>
weren&#39;t as important as the words they read correctly.  Frequently, <br/>
as they progressed through the story, their mistake became apparent <br/>
to them and they corrected it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
       My children are by no means the only ones I know who have been <br/>
allowed to learn to read.   Based on my experiences with dozens of <br/>
children who were not &quot;taught&quot; to read yet became fluent readers, I <br/>
have found that the age at which this innate ability comes into play <br/>
to vary widely.  I was reading at the age of four even though I had <br/>
not received any formal instruction.  My children have all become <br/>
readers at ages varying from six to 11 years old.  Just as babies <br/>
begin to walk and talk at different ages, children will learn to read <br/>
at different times.  <br/>
<br/>
     The former governor of my state, now president of the country, <br/>
declared that all children will be reading at the age of eight but <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that those children will be capable of reading.  To <br/>
declare such nonsense will only frustrate children and teachers as <br/>
well as create more problems that add to the myth that learning to <br/>
read is a difficult process.</div>

 I was just thinking this morning as Mia (4 yod) was showing me her<br/>
&#39;writing&#39; in her journal, that I have no desire to be intrusive in her<br/>
aquisition of the written word.<br/>
<br/>
 Both my boys have had two or more  years of phonics, narration and<br/>
copywork, so I am  enjoying watching Mia discover language on her own terms.<br/>
It&#39;s fascinating. I am finding too that because I&#39;m not interfering and<br/>
taking over, she is sharing so many of her discoveries with me and asking me<br/>
to show her things.<br/>
<br/>
 It makes me realize how closed she has been to me in the past and I&#39;m just<br/>
so thankful for the closeness that we have now. It&#39;s precious.<br/>
