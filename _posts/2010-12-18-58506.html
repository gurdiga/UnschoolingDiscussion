<br/>
Please tell us why home schooling was chosen for this student, and explain your <br/>
home schooling philosophy.***<br/>
<br/>
Individualized learning tailored to the child&#39;s needs.  The ability to think for <br/>
oneself being fostered outside of an environment that mass educates to the <br/>
middle.  The ability to explore opportunities that one couldn&#39;t do if in a <br/>
classroom environment.  Being able to intensely focus on areas of study without <br/>
needing to move on before finished.<br/>
<br/>
***Grading Scale<br/>
<br/>
Please explain the grading scale or other methods of evaluation.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Intimate hands on person to person contact between parent and child, no middle <br/>
man like a teacher keeping the parent informed.  Personal accomplishment and <br/>
garnering of skills until fully competent, visibly and tangibly attained through <br/>
the intimate contact between parent and child working together to achieve <br/>
educational goals.  Evaluation by the student of their own processes and <br/>
achievements and moving forward or continuing further in areas of study based on <br/>
their individualized learning tailored to their needs.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a start I guess... It&#39;s likely what I would say. I might come up with <br/>
more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here is part of what we actually wrote for Zoe&#39;s applications (and while I use the word &quot;unschooling&quot; in my actual life all the time, we chose not to use it in this context):<br/>
<br/>
Humans are natural learners. That is the basis of our household’s learning philosophy. From there, everything flows easily. Our homeschooling journey has been filled with work, surprise, frustration, but most of all, joy. Zoe has been able to have a wider variety of experiences, use more different modes of learning, and meet a more diverse group of people than she would have if she had been in school. We are especially lucky to be living in the great city of Chicago where we have taken advantage of its tremendous resources. In fact, for us the term homeschool is a bit of a misnomer; better labels for her process might be life learner or community-schooled.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Watching Zoe learn and grow through the years has confirmed that this philosophy is not just theoretical. All of the work you see in this transcript was freely chosen by Zoe; we acted as facilitators, chauffeurs, and sounding boards. Were we her teachers? Sure, just as Bill Nye, college professors, politicians, the neighbors, and our dog Steve, were her teachers. She was free to explore her many interests as deeply as she needed.<br/>

That is one brilliant answer.   Thank you very, very much.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924158298">This is what I have so far  as an introduction to my son&#39;s homeschool <br/>
portfolio for admission to college. It hasn&#39;t been submitted yet.<br/>
<br/>
We are home educating Arlo in a manner that puts a heavy emphasis on <br/>
interest based learning, learning in a variety of environments, and <br/>
personal exploration. We believe that individuals can best reach their <br/>
full potential and development as contributing and creative members of <br/>
society by being allowed to self determine and interact with the real <br/>
world, rather than being isolated with their peers in an institutional <br/>
environment with little choice of subject matter or method of learning. <br/>
We act as partners with our children in their exploration of  topics of <br/>
interest. We do not limit them to learning from textbooks and classroom <br/>
settings, though they learn in that way as well.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that his unique education, his  passion for performance and <br/>
composing, and his sense of personal responsibility will make him a <br/>
fully contributing member of the Berklee community. Arlo&#39;s primary <br/>
strength and passion is the electric bass. He has dedicated countless <br/>
hours to the instrument.<br/>
