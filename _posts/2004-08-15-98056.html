<br/>
There are movies I still warn my kids away from, or that I&#39;ll turn off if <br/>
they come in.   I have &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; rented.  I watched half, and will <br/>
watch half tomorrow.  I&#39;m not inviting anyone else to watch it with me.<br/>
<br/>
If one of them saw it and asked to watch it, I&#39;d give a light warning and let <br/>
them.   They&#39;re 12 and 15.  (The other&#39;s out of town until after the movie <br/>
goes back.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is there such a thing as age appropriateness regarding<br/>
TV/videos in the unschooling world?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an unschooling world.  There&#39;s just a world.<br/>
Within the principle of treating children as we would treat other people, is <br/>
there age appropriateness?   <br/>
<br/>
For me, no.  But that doesn&#39;t mean there is no criteria for making <br/>
recommendations.   <br/>
I have a 55 year old friend who can&#39;t see movies with snakes, so I let her <br/>
know if I&#39;ve seen one she should avoid, and I would never put a video with a <br/>
snake in it on while she was here.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 36 year old friend who was spanked, slapped and thrown around by <br/>
half a dozen parents and stepparents, and a show with any kind of child crying <br/>
from parental abuse is horrible for her.  I shelter her when I can.<br/>
<br/>
None of my kids mind snakes.  <br/>
Kirby (18) doesn&#39;t like horror shows or monster movies (avoids even light <br/>
creepiness).<br/>
<br/>
I see it as a case-by-case thing.  When my kids were little they liked <br/>
cartoons, and movies with pets and kids.   <br/>
<br/>
They still do, but they&#39;ve added other things gradually over the years. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I never did an age thing. Never anything like &quot;You can watch it when you&#39;re <br/>
12.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
We live near a video rental store, and I have the kids on the account, and <br/>
have them marked with their real birthdays, but also a note that they&#39;re not <br/>
restricted in what they can rent.   It&#39;s possible there for an account-holder to <br/>
put limits on what can be rented, even if the others are adults!!!   I could <br/>
prevent my husband from renting R rated movies, I guess.  Seems so.<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t sneaky, and they let us know what they&#39;re watching, or they <br/>
watch it with us.<br/>
<br/>
They will warn me about movies they think are too rough for me, too, or just <br/>
not the kind of thing they think I&#39;d like.   They recommend things they think <br/>
I WOULD like.   It works both ways, in all directions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. We are not hands-off parents. Don&#39;t picture our children alone <br/>
with a tv - that just isn&#39;t how it is.<br/>
We chose carefully what to watch ourselves when the kids were around. <br/>
We encouraged shows we thought were great by being enthusiastic and <br/>
enjoying them together - Mr. Rogers, Magic School Bus, etc. We chose <br/>
movies that we could all enjoy. We muted or switched channels when we <br/>
thought things were coming on that might be disturbing. My kids didn&#39;t <br/>
watch a lot of commercial tv, because there was just so much truly <br/>
great programming on PBS that it took up most of the time they had for <br/>
tv.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest thing for me was never what we watched, but has been that <br/>
my kids love to watch the same thing over and over - and I really like <br/>
to watch new stuff.<br/>

<br/>
When the world is divided into what we want them to see and what we don&#39;t<br/>
want them to see, the &quot;dangerous&quot; things become more attractive and they&#39;ll<br/>
want to check out what&#39;s so mysteriously threatening, and perhaps try out<br/>
whether they can handle it or not.<br/>
<br/>
When the world is divided into what they want to experience and what they<br/>
don&#39;t want to experience, why would they choose to experience what they<br/>
don&#39;t want to experience?<br/>
<br/>
I can watch porn. But I don&#39;t want to. So why would I watch it?<br/>
<br/>
They appreciate help in finding what they want and avoiding what they don&#39;t<br/>
want just as adults do. We can give them information and advice, but they<br/>
want to make their own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
And when they&#39;re allowed to make their own decisions, they learn more about<br/>
themselves and what they&#39;re capable of. *And* learn more about making<br/>
decisions.<br/>

We watched Haunted Mansion last night.  Or, 2 of us did.  When it  got to the <br/>
part when Eddie Murphy was in the crypt and the skeletons started  coming out <br/>
of the coffins, I had to leave.  I said, &quot;I have issues.&quot; and  grinned at my <br/>
husband and left the room.<br/>
 <br/>
It reminded me of a really traumatic nightmare I had when I was a child,  <br/>
after watching, of all things, &quot;Abbot and Costello Meet Dracula and  <br/>
Frankenstein.&quot;  That day my mother had really scrubbed my room, and  rearranged it, and <br/>
moved the bed so it was at an angle, sticking out in the  middle of the room <br/>
from the corner.  I remember I had sponge curlers in my  hair for some reason, <br/>
and clean summer cotton pajamas.  So that night we  watched the movie, and I <br/>
went to bed in my spotless room and the light was still  on when I had the <br/>
nightmare about Dracula and Frankenstein, in their coffins, on  either side of my <br/>
bed.  They came out of their coffins, of course.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a vivid dream, even still, and I can still see my room and feel that  <br/>
lurch in my chest from when you sob in your sleep.  And when I saw that  scene <br/>
in Haunted Mansion it all came back.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, warn me if there are skeletons coming out of coffins.<br/>

Tolkien movies or The Sopranos when he&#39;s  awake.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
But do they ASK to watch these movies? Would they want to? I&#39;ve never met a  <br/>
three year old who would spend more than a minute or two in front of The  <br/>
Sopranos, for example, without leaving the room or doing something else. And if  <br/>
the &quot;something else&quot; would be to play with me, then The Sopranos could  wait.<br/>
 <br/>
Most three year olds would rather watch what IS considered &quot;age  appropriate&quot; <br/>
shows like Teletubbies and Mr Rogers, and Robyn&#39;s favorite, Max  & Ruby. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
What did *we* watch? We only had Captain Kangaroo in the morning and Mr  <br/>
Rogers & Electric Company in the afternoon. I&#39;d watch The Lone  Ranger  (age <br/>
appropriate? I don&#39;t think so!) and Batman and Zorro. I  loved Dark Shadows---and I <br/>
was six when I started watching that. And all those  westerns.<br/>
 <br/>
Duncan (8) went to Blockbuster the other day with my father. He picked up  RL <br/>
Stine&#39;s &quot;The Werewolf of Fever Swamp&quot;. He asked that I watch it with him, so  <br/>
we snuggled up on his bed. We didn&#39;t get three minutes into it when he says, <br/>
&quot;I  can&#39;t watch this. Too scary. Want to play chess?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I reminded him that *I* was there, that it was only a movie with actors and  <br/>
make-up, and that he did NOT have to watch anything he didn&#39;t want to. No  <br/>
problem. We played chess.<br/>
 <br/>
The next day, he asked again that I watch it with him. Before he  put it in, <br/>
he asked a little more about actors and make-up and RL Stine and  stuff. Then <br/>
we got down to watching it. Several times, I saw him lips mouthing,  &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
just a movie. It&#39;s just a movie.&quot; I&#39;d also point out how silly something  <br/>
was---like when they&#39;re walking through the dark house without turning on ONE  light. <br/>
I said, &quot;Would YOU do that?&quot; It&#39;s, of course, scarier when they DON&#39;T!  &lt;G&gt; <br/>
And that&#39;s the point----to scare you. After a while, he started to  laugh and <br/>
point out other silly things and how girls HAVE to trip and fall in  each and <br/>
every scary movie. &lt;g&gt;.We figured out *who* the werewolf was, and  laughed <br/>
about that too.<br/>
 <br/>
His brother&#39;s out of town so he slept downstairs that night, and with me  and <br/>
Ben last night. But he&#39;s OK with werewolves today. We might even watch it  <br/>
again! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Sure. In *my* little unschooling world. &lt;g&gt; Everyone decides  when he&#39;s ready <br/>
to watch whatever he wants to. Here, little kids prefer cartoons  and shows <br/>
about animals. Bigger kids watch cartoons  and adventure. Teens like comedy and <br/>
music. Adults like all of  these &lt;g&gt; Plus the Olympics, the Hitler Channel <br/>
and House Porn.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Without choice, there is no choice.<br/>
Without options, no one can make a good decision.<br/>
No one can make a generous decision, or a gracious or mature decision, unless <br/>
they have the leeway to decide.<br/>
<br/>
And unless a parent loosens up, she will assume her child is being the way <br/>
she is because the mom set her on a narrow path.   If she takes the reins off, <br/>
the child will probably not run crazy and leave.<br/>
<br/>
Which children DO run crazy and leave?<br/>
Those whose reins were too tight for too long.<br/>
<br/>
We have a dog who can get out of our yard but doesn&#39;t.  Or she does, but she <br/>
doesn&#39;t go away.    We don&#39;t even have a fence or wall between the front and <br/>
back on one side anymore.  She has a dog door, and we have no fence.  Yet she&#39;s <br/>
always home.  She might be in the front, if something exciting is happening, <br/>
but she doesn&#39;t have the urge to run away.    She used to explore the vacant <br/>
lot, but as she got older she quit.  We take her on walks without a leash and <br/>
she stays with us.<br/>

&lt;&lt; When the world is divided into what they want to experience and what they<br/>
don&#39;t want to experience, why would they choose to experience what they<br/>
don&#39;t want to experience?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last Friday night began a new era for me as a mom.   I had an experience.<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me of the very first time all three of my children walked away <br/>
from my house together, toward the busy road, to go to the convenience store.  <br/>
The boys were taking Holly, for the first time, without me.  I took a photo of <br/>
them walking away.  I don&#39;t know where it is and that&#39;s fine, because it used <br/>
to make me cry and still might.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was barely three or nearly, and holding both their hands, so I guess <br/>
Marty was five and Kirby was seven.<br/>
<br/>
Flash forward to June 11, 2004.<br/>
Kirby, 18 was at work.  Took the big van.  He works a mile away.<br/>
Marty, 15, had gone to a gaming tournament across the valley, maybe 15 miles <br/>
away.  Drove my Dodge Caravan.  First time driving all by himself, not <br/>
counting once to the nearest grocery store and once to the post office this week.<br/>
Holly, 12, said, &quot;I&#39;m bored.  I wonder if  Crystal would want to hang out?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Crystal is 18, someone they&#39;ve known since Kirby was seven (that same going <br/>
to Circle K season), and she&#39;s lately moved back here after a stint in <br/>
California which all the kids followed like a soap opera.   She called Crystal, who <br/>
(surprisingy for a Friday night for someone as 18 and good looking as she is) <br/>
said, &quot;Sure!  I&#39;ll be there in fifteen minutes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So Crystal came and she and Holly went off to find something fun to do.<br/>
<br/>
All three of my children were gone at once.  They were in three different <br/>
places. They were not in the homes of other families.  They were all going to <br/>
come home at some point.  Kirby, 12:30 after he cleaned the shop.  Marty, before <br/>
12 because he has a provisional license and isn&#39;t supposed to drive after <br/>
midnight.  Holly, whenever.<br/>
<br/>
It was scary for me.  My husband was really comforting, said Crystal&#39;s great <br/>
with our kids, that Marty&#39;s fine to drive that.<br/>
<br/>
I went to sleep without any of my kids home.  <br/>
I woke up and they were all in their beds, the van was fine.<br/>
<br/>
Holly told me the next day that at one point it occurred to her that I might <br/>
be worrying and thinking they were all in different places, but that she and <br/>
Crystal were (at the moment she thought of it) with Kirby, where he works.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Marty returned from having seen a movie at the dollar movies with <br/>
friends, and left again to hang around the new apartment of a friend of his.  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have cared how late he was out.  He was back within an hour.<br/>
<br/>
They are real-live evidence (not proof, that takes more than a single-family <br/>
sample of three) that children who have grown up with freedom can be given <br/>
LOTS of freedom as they get older without going crazy or living dangerously or <br/>
&quot;running wild.&quot;<br/>

===================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;This hasn&#39;t always been the case for us, as I touched on a bit in my <br/>
tv post. For a long time we didn&#39;t have tv. When the kids were really <br/>
young--when my oldest was 3 or under--I limited the amount of time they <br/>
watched videos to an hour or under a day. By the time she was 4, though, <br/>
she had free access to the videos and could pop them in when she wanted, <br/>
though that was still pretty controlled and limited by what we had in <br/>
the house. I remember lots of Teletubbies, Dragon Tales, Bear in the Big <br/>
Blue House, Masie, countless Disney movies. We have a *huge* video <br/>
collection because of those years without tv.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started reading here (a year ago in November, I think), I <br/>
began rethinking my approach to tv (and bedtimes and food). We had <br/>
gotten cable several months before, so the kids (6, 4 and 3 at that <br/>
point) were watching tv as well as videos, though still more often <br/>
videos. I remember I had been wondering for a while when it would be <br/>
&quot;okay&quot; to let my kids watch Star Wars, which I couldn&#39;t wait to share <br/>
with them because it&#39;s such an interest for dh and I. Emily had seen <br/>
bits and pieces of the Phantom Menace, the parts that weren&#39;t too scary, <br/>
but it was still something that dh and I watched after the kids went to <br/>
bed. For us, that&#39;s how it started--with Star Wars. After Star Wars, we <br/>
began watching other things as well. It was gradual, not an <br/>
in-your-face-violence kind of thing. Em had also seen parts of Lord of <br/>
the Rings, so we were soon sharing that with her as well. At first, she <br/>
got really upset by the dead dwarves in the mines and stopped watching. <br/>
It took her several months before she was comfortable trying again. Same <br/>
thing with Spiderman--it was just too realistic when we first rented it, <br/>
maybe 6 months ago so we turned it off. We tried again a couple of weeks <br/>
ago, and they loved it--even the 4 year old. (A friend of mine has <br/>
gotten quite a bit of grief from her 8 year old because he&#39;s not allowed <br/>
to watch it but knows that Sam has.) We&#39;ve shared lots of really great <br/>
movies over the past year, but we still enjoy watching Disney movies, <br/>
cartoons or whatever. We&#39;ve watched all the Star Wars, Lord of the <br/>
Rings, Indiana Jones, Men in Black, X-Men. We&#39;ve also watched Crouching <br/>
Tiger, Hidden Dragon; The Last Samurai; Sound of Music; Peter Pan; Harry <br/>
Potter and many others.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, this has been gradual. The kids probably don&#39;t even <br/>
remember not having free choice because it went from being very young to <br/>
free choice of videos to free choice of tv and movies. But, that doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean that they watch whatever they want without any parental input or <br/>
presence. Emily watched the Last Samurai in our bed with us, and she <br/>
watched me sob at the end when the Samurai get massacred. We talked <br/>
about *why* I was crying so hard and what it meant to me to watch that. <br/>
They haven&#39;t seen The Matrix yet, but they haven&#39;t asked to see it <br/>
either.  When Dh rented Kill Bill, we told the kids that it was an adult <br/>
movie, same thing with Fight Club. There are movies that I don&#39;t think <br/>
they need to see, and, yes, I&#39;m the one making that decision.. Kill Bill <br/>
was a movie I don&#39;t think *I* needed to see! We watch those movies in <br/>
our room with the door closed. In the past we would have watched <br/>
something like that after they went to bed, but because our kids no <br/>
longer have a bedtime, they&#39;re still awake. We just point that out and <br/>
remind them that they&#39;re free to watch something else downstairs, play <br/>
the computer, play in the playroom, any number of other things, and <br/>
they&#39;re fine with that because it doesn&#39;t happen very often. They <br/>
realize that we&#39;re not telling them no just for the sake of controlling <br/>
but because it&#39;s something that is genuinely too much for them.<br/>
<br/>
The gradual part is really important, I think. Several months ago, I <br/>
made an analogy to someone who was throwing off controls left and right <br/>
and whose children didn&#39;t quite know what to do with the new freedom. I <br/>
suggested that it might be a lot like being in a closet and having <br/>
someone suddenly fling the door open wide, letting flood in the very <br/>
bright light outside and how much that must hurt their eyes!  It&#39;s not <br/>
about flinging the door open as quickly as you can just because it&#39;s <br/>
been closed for so long; it&#39;s more about gradually opening the door, <br/>
using your children&#39;s comfort levels to guide you. Like several of the <br/>
experienced folks here often say, it&#39;s not about never saying no but <br/>
about saying yes more often.<br/>

We have  a dog who can get out of our yard but doesn&#39;t.  Or she does, but she <br/>
 <br/>
doesn&#39;t go away.    We don&#39;t even have a fence or wall between  the front and <br/>
back on one side anymore.  She has a dog door, and we  have no fence.  Yet <br/>
she&#39;s <br/>
always home.  She might be in the  front, if something exciting is happening, <br/>
but she doesn&#39;t have the urge  to run away.    She used to explore the vacant <br/>
lot, but as she  got older she quit.  We take her on walks without a leash <br/>
and <br/>
she  stays with us.<br/>

My dog Percy and my cats have no good reason to leave. There&#39;s always food,  <br/>
clean water and a warm bed, someone to scratch an ear.  My neighbor&#39;s dog  <br/>
used to get off his chain and he&#39;d come straight to my house.  I put him  back on <br/>
the chain (reluctantly), until finally I just left him in our yard until  his <br/>
owner came looking.  He was small, so he could have snuck under the  fence <br/>
back to his own house, but he knew how to work the doggie door and where  the <br/>
food was and that there were people here who paid attention to him.  He  was at <br/>
our house for 3 days before the owner came to get him.  I  didn&#39;t want to give <br/>
him up at all.  When the guy found out I&#39;d like to keep  him he didn&#39;t bring <br/>
him back.  I hope he put in a doggie door for the  little guy.  <br/>
 <br/>
Will would rather be here than at someone else&#39;s house, too.<br/>
