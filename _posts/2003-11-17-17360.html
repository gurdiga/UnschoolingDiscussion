explain just &quot;how&quot; that learning is taking place in the family - as we live our <br/>
lives.  You did a great job of it.<br/>

It IS a really hard thing to explain, and the best I&#39;ve found to do is gather <br/>
with others who explain it differently so that people who are figuring it out <br/>
can get a fuller picture because they get MORE pictures, and if one person&#39;s <br/>
analogies or examples are baffling, someone else can reword it or come to it <br/>
from a different angle and they might get it!<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU all of you who post and help others, and THANK YOU those who come <br/>
and lurk and take good parts away and live them, because the collective set of <br/>
all that we&#39;re all doing is changing the world, maybe just a little, but in a <br/>
profound little way.<br/>
