 </span></blockquote>This is something I hear alot, from people in many states! (My area is, my <br/>
district is)<br/>
Now granted, in some states the law is written so that local districts get <br/>
&quot;leeway&quot; but a state law is a state law.  If one&#39;s county is &quot;bad&quot; and <br/>
umbrella school is not an option, one must be particularly vigilant about the <br/>
requirements.<br/>
Don&#39;t do mare than the law requires. Unless you want the law to change and <br/>
the recommendations to become requirements! (as some groups we know DO)<br/>
