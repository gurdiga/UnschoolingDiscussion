<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895352882">I would like to share one moment that happened today. Our kids have been playing D&D with us. Mydh made up an adventure from his old books.He made it without considering the impact on the characters dieing and how hard the adventure was. When their characters got killed by a monster everyone was crying and very upset. This provided us with a time to explain the real rules of the game then brainstorm to change it to the way that we were all ready for. My dh mentioned that the books were so poorly organized that there was no index to look for a weaker monster and so it was difficult and time consuming for him when he was trying to prepare. The next afternoon dh is painting and I am at work and suddenly the 3 kids have the books out and are going through categorizing the monsters onto another paper so they are readily available to dh. Wow! No input or expectations from us.It is so amazing to see the skills when they are motivated and left to do it as they see fit.<br/>
