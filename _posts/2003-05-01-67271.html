&lt;&lt;My ds is 12 and wanting to find some kind of job....other than lawn mowing<br/>
or a paper route.  We live in a very rural area and these are not really<br/>
options available to us.   Does anyone have suggestions for places willing<br/>
to hire a 12 year old for a couple of hours per day?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would think the best place to start is with people you know. Either<br/>
relatives or friends who work. Put the word out that your son is interested<br/>
in working. Tell them the hours and days he&#39;s willing to work and possibly<br/>
what he&#39;s interested in or maybe just willing to do pretty much of anything.<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are a lot of people out there who could find something for<br/>
him and also be thrilled with a helping hand. If nothing comes of that, just<br/>
start to go store to store in town. If that&#39;s an option<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669099514">Here&#39;s a few things my ds did for money last summer:<br/>
<br/>
Did odd jobs for the neighbors - took out trash, washed cars, waxed floors, washed walls<br/>
Ran errands for the people in the senior complex<br/>
Spent one day a month writing checks and paying bills for a lady with arthritis<br/>
Helped a guy with major ebay issues pack and mail stuff<br/>
Trained a neighbor&#39;s dog (basic commands, nothing fancy) <br/>
Burned cd&#39;s and made mix tapes for people who wanted 2 songs of this cd, 3 songs from that one, etc<br/>
Taught kids at the community center how to play chess<br/>
Painted stencils on a friend&#39;s wall<br/>
<br/>
******I would think the best place to start is with people you know. Put the word out that your son is interested in working. ******<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty much how ds found all his jobs -- telling everyone he saw that he was looking for work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141100011">Hi Jinger,<br/>
<br/>
A fellow homeschooler was just telling me about her son.  He is 14 <br/>
and was in the same situation.  He is very interested in gaming with <br/>
cards---my kids are too young so I cannot remember the name <br/>
(something like pokeman but much older, more history, weekly games <br/>
with strategy).  Anyway, he competes weekly and researched strategies <br/>
on the internet.  He won the competition by creating his own &quot;cards&quot; <br/>
or &quot;play&quot; based on his research as he said the cards he needed were <br/>
too hard to get.  He ended up finding a job writing a column for a <br/>
gaming site for this particular game through the internet!  Besides a <br/>
great unschooling story, I though maybe your son could really delve <br/>
into his personal interests.  I think the internet has alot of <br/>
opportunities if you are willing to scan (which can be terribly <br/>
overwhelming).  Maybe if there is something he really loves, this can <br/>
inspire him to think out of the box because ironically his parents <br/>
were giving hom the same ideas about mowing lawns and stuff.  Anyway, <br/>
sorry to ramble but I hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>
Olga :)<br/>

I don&#39;t know if this would be his cup of tea, but how about something<br/>
enterpreneurial? My son (6) grows plants from seeds and cuttings and then<br/>
sells them at plant sales (usually at other people&#39;s garage sales that he<br/>
knows, he sets up a table). Another friend of mine has a son who is looking<br/>
into owning a vending machine (like a small candy or toy machine) and<br/>
eventually maybe video game machines or similar. Just some ideas. I think<br/>
there&#39;s a book called something like &quot;The Lemonade Stand&quot; that talks about<br/>
kids as enterpreneurs.<br/>

If you&#39;re in a rural area, what about local small farms?  The farmers around<br/>
here always need help with haying, for instance, but he&#39;d have to be strong<br/>
for his age.  (My son was helping with haying at that age, but he&#39;s got a<br/>
lotof upper body strength.)  But there are always jobs to do on a farm.<br/>
