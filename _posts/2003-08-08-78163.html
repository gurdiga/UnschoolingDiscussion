<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808253784">**It&#39;s a shame that some people spend their time trying to help other <br/>
families<br/>
be more at peace and live in more freedom, and then once in a while someone<br/>
feels compelled to spend some of THEIR time undermining that.  It&#39;s not <br/>
worth<br/>
doing, really.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a new metaphor -- brace yourself.<br/>
<br/>
The internet &quot;ice cream shop&quot; of email groups offers 31 million flavors. <br/>
  If you don&#39;t like the one you just tried, then put down the little <br/>
plastic spoon and take a taste from another one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or one can try adding chocolate sprinkles or maraschino cherries or oat <br/>
bran or a shot of tequila as a chaser, whatever.  But it&#39;s unkind to <br/>
those who do like the flavor to get all indignant and start picketing <br/>
the corporate headquarters and chanting &quot;yuck&quot; in attempt to get the <br/>
flavor reformulated.  Some of us LOVE chunky-funky-unskunky-unschooly <br/>
ripple.<br/>
