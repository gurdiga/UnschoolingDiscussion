<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762878088">Hi <br/>
<br/>
I just recently found this site that has a new, wonderful photo<br/>
every day.  For those hs/unschoolers who are interested in  astronomy,<br/>
a wealth of information can be had here!  There are archives to view<br/>
the photographs of past days.  I think it is an exciting site<br/>
-if only to see the beauty.<br/>
<br/>
check it out here:    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod">http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41018964">I love this site, thanks so much for sharing.  Me and my son started our <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling adventure last fall pouring over the astronomy <br/>
info.  I think we both learned a lot.  This looks like a sight to be checked <br/>
every day.  Cool.<br/>
