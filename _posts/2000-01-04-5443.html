<div id="ygrps-yiv-448677753">I just wanted to let you all know that I have my website to a point that I wouldn&#39;t be too embarrassed if any of you looked at it :)<br/>
The address is:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.angelfire.com/fl3/homeschoolingwrights/">http://www.angelfire.com/fl3/homeschoolingwrights/</a><br/>
<br/>
Also I have begun a year long journal (updated daily) chronicling our venture into unschooling/homeschooling.  I hope it is interesting to someone elso beside me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed reading all your posts and will jump in as I can.<br/>

What program are you using for your web page?  Are you using html?  Or<br/>
templates provided by your ISP?<br/>
I am trying to make a web page too, but it is SLOW going.  Thank you for<br/>
sharing yours!<br/>
