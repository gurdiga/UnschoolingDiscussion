<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143960564">Care to skew the polls a bit more?  Today&#39;s Daily Poll at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.att.net/">http://www.att.net/</a> asks whether homeschooling hurts a child&#39;s social development.  Apparently homeschoolers have been clicking on the &quot;not at all&quot; vote since the poll&#39;s presence started circulating among homeschool groups this afternoon, flip-flopping the not-at-all vote to 40% from 20%, and the very-much vote from 40% to 25%! <br/>
