<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178501266">I just found out that next year when I fill out a statement of <br/>
intention with the local public school for my now-6 year-old, I will <br/>
need to attach either an immunization schedule or a medical <br/>
exemption card or a religious exemption card.  (no philisophical <br/>
exemptions in Iowa, yet that is what mine is)  The next two children <br/>
have no immunizations and this seems to be a new law someone snuck <br/>
in as I haven&#39;t heard of this before.  Does anyone know where I can <br/>
start looking into this as I am already worried and scared someone <br/>
is going to come and take my children away from me over this. (yes, <br/>
a fear I live with every day) My doctor has &quot;allowed&quot; me to skip the <br/>
vaccinations because after listening to me (and he did actually <br/>
listen) he said I was the only parent he met who actually knew WHY <br/>
she didn&#39;t want immunizations and he couldn&#39;t promise me I wasn&#39;t <br/>
right.  However, a medical exemption would mean that he would have <br/>
to agree and sign a paper saying the immunizations <br/>
were &quot;contraindicted&quot; (please forgive spelling, I&#39;m in a hurry, <br/>
don&#39;t tell me I spelled it wrong and make me feel bad, I&#39;ve seen <br/>
that done on here at least once).  Anyway, any websites that might <br/>
help me, any advice, and been-there-done-that stories?  (and yes, I <br/>
will Google, too!)  :o)<br/>

There are lists at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org">http://www.nhen.org</a> Go to your state group&#39;s website and<br/>
see what they have to say and how others are handling it. (Obviously may not<br/>
be a big deal to most people in your state.)<br/>

informed is the best defense against fear! You might try including your<br/>
state in your Google search to find state specific information about what&#39;s<br/>
going on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012877238">Hi Mary, it&#39;s probably not relevant to you in the US but our organisation here called Australian Vaccination Network has a website www.avn.org.au  and they will sell you a conscientious objector pack which is what we need to do here. It may have helpful ideas in for you. It&#39;s a terrible fear to live with that by doing what you believe to be right you may lose the ones that you are working so hard to protect. I send you a &quot;spirit link&quot; to the universal parents of all places and ages who I call upon whenever I need parenting help of the most dire kind. They have helped me frequently. All the best to you in your difficulties.<br/>

Sometimes something I post doesn&#39;t show up for hours or even a day, but I get <br/>
replies to it. Sometimes, I see replies to others posts but don&#39;t see the OP <br/>
until much later. And sometimes I don&#39;t see a post others are replying too <br/>
ever! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399144965">Maybe one option to consider is to find a different doctor.  Check at <br/>
your chiropractor&#39;s office to see if they know of a doctor who will <br/>
write you a medical exemption to vaccinations.  A naturopath who is <br/>
an MD would do that, as would a MD who is a homeopath or anyone who <br/>
supports alternative medicine.  I found two doctors who would be <br/>
willing to do that.  One lives an hour and a half away, the other <br/>
lives 45 minutes away, but they&#39;re both worth the drive. <br/>
