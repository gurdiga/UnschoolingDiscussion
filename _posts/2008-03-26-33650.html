<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072951389">My oldest and I seem to struggle with communication.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
She will start talking to me while I am reading emails and then wonder why I<br/>
am not listening. She didn&#39;t try to get my attention. When I am reading I am<br/>
really focused and it is the only time I can&#39;t multi task so I didn&#39;t hear a<br/>
thing she said. She often times will get upset when I finally do hear her<br/>
and I say &quot;What?&quot;. I can understand that. I have asked her to try and get my<br/>
attention before talking to me and sometimes she does, but sometimes she<br/>
doesn&#39;t. Since noticing this, I have also tried to &quot;keep one ear open to<br/>
her&quot; so to speak, which helps, but not always.<br/>
<br/>
Something else:<br/>
Often times when she is playing video games (which she does a lot and that<br/>
is fine) I will ask her if she wants to do something with her sister and I.<br/>
She is of course free to say no and I only ask because Lil and I are already<br/>
doing said thing. However, when she wants to do something with me, she<br/>
doesn&#39;t get that I need time to finish up what I am doing to be with her.<br/>
Just now she said &quot;Let&#39;s go downstairs.&quot; I told her that she could go<br/>
downstairs if she wanted to, but I was sewing.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently she wanted me to go downstairs and play Candy Land with her, but<br/>
it took me a minute to figure that out. She was on her way downstairs (by<br/>
herself) when she said &quot;you just get to into your sewing&quot;. Which made me<br/>
think of her video games. If I would have known she wanted to go down and<br/>
play Candy Land I would have just said &quot;Just a minute, let me finish this<br/>
up&quot;, but I tried to explain to her that she doesn&#39;t want to do things with<br/>
me when she is into her video games. I don&#39;t think she completely saw the<br/>
connection that I was trying to make and it was probably a bad example<br/>
anyway because it may have suggested that I didn&#39;t want to go play Candy<br/>
Land, which wasn&#39;t the case.<br/>
<br/>
Also, another issue we have is when we try to problem solve.<br/>
<br/>
I will be talking to her trying to figure out how I can make something<br/>
better (like today with the Candy Land/communication thing, or the other day<br/>
when I was trying to see if there was a way to make baths more appealing to<br/>
her) and she will come up with reasons (sometimes crazy, imo, but I don&#39;t<br/>
tell her that) why my said idea won&#39;t work. But then, when I ask her what<br/>
she thinks, she just says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I can think of is that I am expecting too much of her. She<br/>
will be 8 in July.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099771680">===================<br/>
<br/>
My oldest and I seem to struggle with communication.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
She will start talking to me while I am reading emails and then wonder why I<br/>
am not listening. She didn&#39;t try to get my attention. When I am reading I am<br/>
really focused and it is the only time I can&#39;t multi task so I didn&#39;t hear a<br/>

doesn&#39;t. Since noticing this, I have also tried to &quot;keep one ear open to<br/>
her&quot; so to speak, which helps, but not always.<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
As soon as you notice that she is talking to you can you say sorry and ask her to repeat what she was saying. I do that a lot. I did it today when David was telling me a good route to walk the dog. I spaced out and started thinking about what to feed Linnaea and her friend and completely didn&#39;t hear the last things he was saying. I apologized and asked him to repeat himself, and he did. I try not to drift away, but when I do, because I really do want to hear what was said, I ask to get the information, or the story, or the request again. <br/>
<br/>
================<br/>
Something else:<br/>
Often times when she is playing video games (which she does a lot and that<br/>
is fine) I will ask her if she wants to do something with her sister and I.<br/>
She is of course free to say no and I only ask because Lil and I are already<br/>
doing said thing. However, when she wants to do something with me, she<br/>
doesn&#39;t get that I need time to finish up what I am doing to be with her.<br/>
Just now she said &quot;Let&#39;s go downstairs.&quot; I told her that she could go<br/>
downstairs if she wanted to, but I was sewing.<br/>
<br/>
=====================<br/>
Was she alright with your answer. Often if I&#39;m invited to do something with Simon or Linnaea I try and make that a priority over whatever it is I&#39;m doing. If it is something that will only take me a few minutes to complete and I know I&#39;d feel better I&#39;ll ask if they want me now or if I can finish what I&#39;m doing. I figure in not too many years they aren&#39;t going to be inviting me to so many things. It seems like such a gift to be asked to do something now, whatever else can wait. <br/>
<br/>
==================<br/>
Apparently she wanted me to go downstairs and play Candy Land with her, but<br/>
it took me a minute to figure that out. She was on her way downstairs (by<br/>
herself) when she said &quot;you just get to into your sewing&quot;. Which made me<br/>
think of her video games. If I would have known she wanted to go down and<br/>
play Candy Land I would have just said &quot;Just a minute, let me finish this<br/>
up&quot;, but I tried to explain to her that she doesn&#39;t want to do things with<br/>
me when she is into her video games. I don&#39;t think she completely saw the<br/>
connection that I was trying to make and it was probably a bad example<br/>
anyway because it may have suggested that I didn&#39;t want to go play Candy<br/>
Land, which wasn&#39;t the case.<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
Next time say dang, I want to play Candy Land way more than I want to finish this curtain or skirt or shirt or whatever else it is. Thank you for inviting me. There is no real gain by trying to show her that sometimes she doesn&#39;t do what you invite her to do with you. You don&#39;t really want parity, do you? <br/>
<br/>
=========================<br/>
Also, another issue we have is when we try to problem solve.<br/>
<br/>
I will be talking to her trying to figure out how I can make something<br/>
better (like today with the Candy Land/communication thing, or the other day<br/>
when I was trying to see if there was a way to make baths more appealing to<br/>
her) and she will come up with reasons (sometimes crazy, imo, but I don&#39;t<br/>
tell her that) why my said idea won&#39;t work. But then, when I ask her what<br/>
she thinks, she just says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;<br/>
====================<br/>
<br/>
Baths are easy, go swimming more often. At 8 it isn&#39;t that big a deal. Simon, my 10 year old son, doesn&#39;t bathe that often. But we go swimming at least once a week and we have a hot tub. He doesn&#39;t stink, nor does he complain of any discomfort based on personal hygiene issues. About problem solving, often making sure it is a problem, really, is a good thing. The Candy Land thing seems like you were the problem, not your daughter. If you&#39;d asked why, instead of dismissed her, you wouldn&#39;t have had the problem. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I want to say more, but Linnaea wants the computer to play WoW with her brother.<br/>

It shouldn&#39;t be her job or her responsibility to get your attention,  <br/>
though.  She&#39;s only seven?  You should be listening for her and  <br/>
watching her and looking out for her all the time, reading e-mail  <br/>

<br/>
While I was reading that post, Holly came into the room, and I looked  <br/>
straight at her until she made eye contact.  She was coming to talk  <br/>
to me.  Had she just been passing through, I would&#39;ve known and then  <br/>
looked back at the mail, but she didn&#39;t have to call me or ask to  <br/>
talk to me.  She came into the room.  I&#39;m on  duty here.  I&#39;m the  <br/>

I telecommute fulltime, from home, so focusing on work is what I&#39;m supposed<br/>
to be doing (my hubby is a SAHD). But my door is always open, unless I&#39;m in<br/>
a meeting. Rowan (5) and Kestrel (2) are both super-good at coming up and<br/>
touching my arm to get my attention. I think the reason it works so well for<br/>
us, though, is that their father and I model the same thing with each other,<br/>
and the idea is not that this thing might be more important than you, it&#39;s<br/>
that you&#39;re most important, and I want to put this thing firmly aside so I<br/>
can focus and really hear you. Same thing goes with video games, movies,<br/>
intense cooking, working on boat engines, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I think when you&#39;re really engaged with a thing, you tend to zone in<br/>
(especially since we live in supersmall quarters here on the boat, and<br/>
sometimes someone needs to be in the room you&#39;re in, but doesn&#39;t need<br/>
anything from you), and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad message to send that<br/>
getting someone&#39;s attention definitively is important. But the underlying<br/>
assumption, that the real live person wanting your attention and focus is<br/>
the most important thing, is critical. It&#39;s not a get-out-of-jail-free card<br/>
to ignoring each other.<br/>

I do get the sense that you are expecting too much of her.  It might be easy to put too much <br/>
on the older child because they seem so much more capable every year that passes, but she <br/>
has a long way to go before she can be so responsible for keeping the communication lines <br/>
clear with you.  I don&#39;t have grown kids, but my sense is that it will be more our job than <br/>
theirs for a long time.  It seems, from what you wrote, that she is supposed to be <br/>
communicating with you in some very clear ways, but as a parent you need to be reading <br/>
everything she does give you, even an &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; --and interpreting it as useful <br/>
information.  Even the way you said, &quot;My oldest and I seem to struggle with communication,&quot; <br/>
could have been worded, &quot;I am struggling with communications with my oldest.&quot;  I think the <br/>
struggle should be more yours than hers.<br/>

Was she alright with your answer. Often if I&#39;m invited to do something with<br/>
Simon or Linnaea I try and make that a priority over whatever it is I&#39;m<br/>

<br/>
I will have to think more on this. I didn&#39;t know she wanted to do something<br/>
with me, but I should have figured that out. Had I known (or figured) I<br/>
would have said, &quot;Just a minute.&quot; which would have been fine for her.<br/>

Next time say dang, I want to play Candy Land way more than I want to finish<br/>
this curtain or skirt or shirt or whatever else it is.<br/>

<br/>
Will do!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Baths are easy, go swimming more often.<br/>

<br/>
Not easy in Michigan right now and with no car and next to no money, that is<br/>
not so easy. Any ideas for improvising here?<br/>

You should be listening for her and<br/>

Wow. That is a tough one to swallow. My gut reaction would be to say &quot;then I<br/>

I totally agree with you here. I thought of that after I posted.<br/>

What are your priorities?  What is your purpose?  If you want to be  <br/>
an unschooling mom, too much e-mail can be detrimental.  If you want  <br/>
to be an e-mail reader, having children might prove to have been  <br/>
detrimental.<br/>

class skiers both.  So in a less extreme way, look at your options  <br/>
and decide what you are.  If you&#39;re a mom, that&#39;s first!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And my ds(6) and DD (8) love to put on their bathing suits and <br/>
go &quot;swimming&quot; in the bathtub.  I get out their goggles, snorkles and <br/>
some small plastic sea animals and fish nets and they go &quot;snorkling&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, Megan likes to pretend to be Laura Ingles taking a bath.  I <br/>
put a large rubbermaid container (one of the really, really big ones) <br/>
in the kitchen, fill it with warm water, drape a quilt across two <br/>
chairs (just like in the book) and she takes her bath that way.  I pour <br/>
the water over her like Ma did for Laura.  Of course, I have to call <br/>
her Laura the entire time!<br/>
<br/>
My children also like to take turns playing in the shower with their <br/>
umbrellas.  They pretend they are in a rain storm.  Of course, they <br/>
soon get tired of the umbrellas and I take them out and they continue <br/>
to play in the shower.  Sometimes, they even want to use the squeegie <br/>
thing and wipe the shower doors and walls while the shower is going. I <br/>
also have let them use clean paint brushes to &quot;paint&quot; the walls of the <br/>
shower (or tub) with water.  Also, those small paint rollers work well, <br/>
too.  <br/>
<br/>
My only problem for my kids is that they are allergic to soaps.  Both <br/>
have eczema really bad so they just take water baths and showers. No <br/>
fun bubbles or soaps for them. <br/>

pudding. I&#39;d put a bowl of it in the bathtub along with some  <br/>
paintbrushes and kitchen utensils (like the turkey baster and egg  <br/>
beater). The kids would sit and play, then we&#39;d rinse them and the tub  <br/>
off. A few times we used a big tube of toothpaste to play with in the  <br/>
tub. If you get it at the 99 cent store it costs - only 99 cents! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Be creative.<br/>
<br/>
Get one of those hand held shower thingies so you can rinse from their  <br/>
level, not from above their heads.<br/>

Little ice melts too quickly.  Freeze something big.<br/>
<br/>
We have an aluminum fish mold . There are lots of molds made a few  <br/>
decades back that were for jello or aspic dishes or sometimes people  <br/>
used them for meat loafs and such.<br/>

It really isn&#39;t necessary unless you have greasy dirt that won&#39;t wash  <br/>
off in just water.<br/>
<br/>
Use a very mild gentle shampoo if you need soap - just a little bit on  <br/>
one of those fluffy scrub thingies to make lots of suds.<br/>

Use a very mild gentle shampoo for bubble bath, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41681011">My son had chronic eczema--the kind that got bloody--for 10 years, until he stopped <br/>
eating any soy. We had previously been focused on the outside--soap, laundry detergent, <br/>
etc.   And then, like magic, it was gone.  I&#39;ve since heard from many sources that eczema is <br/>
commonly a food sensitivity, but our doctor never mentioned that possibility.  Looking back <br/>
it should have been more obvious--I drank a lot of soy milk while nursing, and then he <br/>
drank gallons of the stuff after he weaned--and then lots in other forms too.  Now we don&#39;t <br/>
use it and it hasn&#39;t come back.  (I had some mysterious stuff that cleared up too.)<br/>

Don&#39;t know if that will help, but I thought I&#39;d throw it out there....<br/>
