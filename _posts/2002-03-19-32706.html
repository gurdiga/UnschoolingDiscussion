Haha, stepford mom!  I&#39;m going to call myself that everytime I&#39;m doing<br/>
things I don&#39;t feel like doing.  Sometimes I need to remember that I&#39;m<br/>
doing it because I want to, not to satisfy someone else&#39;s selfish ways. <br/>
I am learning that there are ways to ask my kids to do things without<br/>
actually asking and without threatening.  If there is something to do, I<br/>
can just describe it.  Usually, someone will volunteer.  I learned this<br/>
from a book called How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids<br/>
Will Talk.  But the reason I read it was because my kids would not<br/>
cooperate with their chore charts.  We still have charts as guidelines in<br/>
case they want some guidance, but not as a must.  Also, walking them<br/>
through is another way to engage cooperation.  I really have found that<br/>
if I ask the kids to do something without me they will try and avoid it. <br/>
If I say, &quot;The recycles are on the back porch, I want them in the car.&quot;<br/>
to my two oldest, they will usually go and do it willingly.  If I say,<br/>
&quot;Go and do this,&quot; they often find excuses or make themselves scarce.  If<br/>
I describe the situation and describe my feelings, and they still don&#39;t<br/>
do it, then I know they probably not only don&#39;t want to but may feel<br/>
overwhelmed by the job.  So, I&#39;ll say, &quot;It seems to me that you don&#39;t<br/>
want to do it?&quot;  And they will say, &quot;Not now, I&#39;m really interested in<br/>
this book&quot; or something like that.  Or they might say, &quot;Can I do it<br/>
later?&quot;  Then we agree on another time and if they avoid it, I say, &quot;We<br/>
have an agreement.&quot;  Or, if it can&#39;t wait, I will say, &quot;I really need<br/>
your help with this.  I don&#39;t have much time and I&#39;m worried I won&#39;t get<br/>
done in time.&quot;  Then, instead of expecting them to do it alone, I do it<br/>
with them.  Doing things with them is always more enjoyable than barking<br/>
orders at them and expecting them to do things on their own, or me doing<br/>
it alone.  I used to hate it when my Dad, a rancher, would interrupt my<br/>
play for hard, &quot;men&#39;s work&quot;.  But I didn&#39;t mind as much when we were<br/>
working together, in fact, I looked forward to doing chores together with<br/>
him.  I have learned a lot about boundaries since realizing I have<br/>
&quot;codependency issues&quot; a few years ago.  That I am me and others are not<br/>
me.  Part of this involves not demanding things of others, but part of it<br/>
also is self-respect, and expressing my desires and opinions.  The fine<br/>
line between not being controlling and not being passive and overly<br/>
tolerant was interesting to find, and I am still finding it.  <br/>

Perfect way to phrase it.  I guess it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to say, <br/>
that some people here sound like they are a little too far down the <br/>
passive side of the scale.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Bonni, your family sounds a lot like mine.  Lots of stuff gets <br/>
done, with or without the job list, but without the job list, things <br/>
were just not flowing smoothly.  Now, with it, they do because <br/>
everyone knows who&#39;s doing what and what still needs done, etc.<br/>
