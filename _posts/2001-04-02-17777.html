<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168936689">Early morning, warm horses, digging in the feed bins, tossing alfalfa hay<br/>
and mixing chopped alfalfa/molasses with horse granola (rolled oats, barley<br/>
and corn mixed with molasses).  Almost as good as my flower boxes which have<br/>
sweet peas and stocks and growing underneath are old fragrant roses and<br/>
scented geraniums.  Or walking out to our deck where all the herbs are<br/>
growing--lavendar, lemon balm, rosemary.  Yum!!!!<br/>

Me too.  Only its my dd who keeps telling me she will not move to the <br/>
country - even bribing her with a dog wont change her mind!!!!!<br/>
Of course if we ever did get the opportunity to move out of town, she <br/>
would have little say in the matter - well actually she would <br/>
probable have a *LOT* to say about it!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455302112">We technically live in a city now, if you count 30,000 a city but it is the<br/>
biggest city in this county.  However, we have all kinds of ranches and<br/>
farms through out the city and deer, bear, raccoons, fox, skunks and various<br/>
and sundry other wildlife that wander the streets.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for a place in the boonies right now.<br/>

Don&#39;t give up hope, Melanie, it took me forever to &quot;retrain&quot; dh and now he<br/>

off the grid!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734065803">We had several stallions, 40 head of broodmares, the string of show horses,<br/>
young horses getting ready for sales plus we ran herefords (both polled and<br/>
horned), black baldies, Suffolk and Hampshire sheep and about 50 milk goats.<br/>
The kidlets were all into 4-H and FFA and each had several project animals<br/>
going.  Yes, it was hard work and a real commitment but we still loved it,<br/>
hard work and all.  In fact, I&#39;d trade this for all the work in a hot tick.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the love of those smells might be an indication of a love of<br/>
that kind of life even if you don&#39;t live that way at the time.  Maybe it is<br/>
something one could use to judge with or not one should live in the country?<br/>
Love the smells and it works, don&#39;t mind the smells and it might work, hate<br/>
the smell and stay in the city &lt;g&gt;<br/>

us.  We have horses, ponies, cats, dogs, chickens...(we used to have<br/>
goats(angora), and a pet Peacock named Peaky)<br/>
We spent at least two hours this afternoon waist deep (the kids) in mucky algae<br/>
water collecting salamander eggs and tadpoles, and peeper frogs.  They are all<br/>
in an aquarium on the dining room table now!  I wasn&#39;t wet but to the ankles,<br/>
but the the kids were soaked and very, very happy.  This is true living, and I<br/>
wish I would have remembered to bring the video camera.  They were some very<br/>
happy children today.<br/>
I feel very lucky that we have the chance to do this type of thing.<br/>
Yes, it was smelly, and yucky, and messy, and slimy ect....  but they had an<br/>
absolute blast, and it was &quot;real&quot;.<br/>
