&gt; I&#39;ve gotten this from several unschoolers at one of my local homeschool <br/>
&gt; groups. I spoke to them about bringing my children with me when I volunteer <br/>
&gt; at our local elderly home and how I was hoping to expose my children to <br/>
&gt; people of different generations as we dont&#39; have elderly family members in <br/>
&gt; our lives. I was told that if my children needed the elderly contact they <br/>
&gt; would let me know. They way I saw it my children wouldn&#39;t feel the want for <br/>
&gt; contact with elderly people if they haven&#39;t been around them. There are <br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; examples, but that is the one that stood out in my mind of unschoolers <br/>
&gt; feeling children will let parents know when they need something and that <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; children don&#39;t need exposure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son&#39;s favorite book in the whole world is The Giver. He read it because I <br/>
suggested that I thought he&#39;d like it. It awakened a passion for Utopian <br/>
novels I don&#39;t think he would have gotten otherwise at age nine. If he&#39;d <br/>
started the book and hated it, or just said that it sounded awful, I <br/>
certainly wouldn&#39;t have MADE him read it. But he did, and he loved it. <br/>
<br/>
Adults have certain advantages in the world. We&#39;ve experienced more of it, <br/>
and we often have cars and money. We also are sometimes good at finding <br/>
resources that kids might not otherwise have.  My vision of unschooling is to <br/>
use my knowledge of the world, and my own curiosity, to learn myself and to <br/>
support my son in learning.  Just like if I read a book I thought a friend <br/>
would love, I share these things with Julian. Why deprive him of meaningful <br/>
experiences because he just hasn&#39;t stumbled across something? He also finds <br/>
things in the world that he shares with my partner and me. We don&#39;t alway <br/>
love the same things, but our relationship open the world more to all of us.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of whether your kids &quot;need elderly contact&quot; is a bizarre one. You <br/>
want to bring them to a place where they can possibly meet some cool people.  <br/>
Your kids might find a great friend. If not, it&#39;s not that big a deal. If <br/>
they hate it because that particular place has only grumpy people, but you <br/>
still want to do it, maybe you&#39;ll get a sitter next time. I think sitting <br/>
around and waiting for your kids to become divinely inspired will drive all <br/>
of you nuts. See the world! Try things! Meet people! Get dirty! I personally <br/>
think &quot;exposure&quot; is a Very Good Thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think these people have too much time on their hands. <br/>
