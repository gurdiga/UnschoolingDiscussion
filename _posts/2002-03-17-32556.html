<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514167684">this is archaic.......BUT mine fight like that and they are still young <br/>
enough to &quot;need pracitce&quot; writing.even though we unschool so much......My <br/>
friend had 6 biological kids and a slew of foster kids as a single mom. SHE <br/>
has them write...like the old-fashioned way from school&gt; I WILL BE NICE TO MY <br/>
BROTHER&gt;  i tried this the other day .and they were alone in the kitchen <br/>
doing it (4 and 6 times according to age) AND THEY ENDED UP LAUGHING AND <br/>
haivng a great old time.kinda  made me laugh. It breaks the mood they are <br/>
in.for sure!!!!  ALSO~ becuase the older one really IS protective of the <br/>
younger ones, and they often play NICELY tog. too, i think they will outgrow <br/>
this??? HOPING SO!!!!! DENISE</div>
