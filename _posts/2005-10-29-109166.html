<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Almost all carts that i&#39;ve seen have a little diagram showing how a<br/>
&gt; child is NOT to sit in the cart, just in case a parent is scratching<br/>
&gt; their head going &quot;hmmm....where do i put the baby? On that tray<br/>
&gt; underneath???&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>NO store,   no human, would pay for little diagrams if a real child had not <br/>
been   hurt in those ways.<br/>
<br/>
There is no law in the history of the world that came about without someone <br/>
having done the thing there&#39;s now a law against.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Most of those ladder stair thingys say &quot;employee use<br/>
only&quot;...i would think that these precautions would relieve them of<br/>
responsibility if you choose to ignore the warnings.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Lots of kids can&#39;t read.   Some adults can&#39;t read English.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yes, i think walmart doesnt want kids to be hurt in their stores.<br/>
But i also think walmart employees have a huge expanded view of what<br/>
will hurt a child.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter.   Walmart isn&#39;t a playground and even if they &quot;only&quot; cared <br/>
about their stock or about the peace and quiet for other customers, that&#39;s <br/>
enough reason to ask kids to behave in store-visiting ways when they&#39;re in <br/>
stores.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. Info i&#39;ve<br/>
tried to give is how to meet your child&#39;s needs to explore the store<br/>
without making him feel bad about it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If his &quot;need to explore&quot; includes doing things that are against store policy <br/>
or advice, maybe he shouldn&#39;t feel bad about it, but maybe the MOM should.<br/>
<br/>
There was a huge blowup a few years back when someone who was more into a <br/>
movement/philosophy called NCP (Non-coercive Parenting) came and assured us all <br/>
that if they were visiting and her child wanted to walk on the coffee table, <br/>
she would try to find a way for him to do that.    Some people said she should <br/>
not even THINK about trying to persuade a hostess to let a visiting kid climb <br/>
up and walk around on her coffee table, but somehow this mom was fully <br/>
convinced that her child&#39;s &quot;need&quot; to have his way was more important that coffee <br/>
tables or property laws or courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve also experienced enough times, a store employee telling my son<br/>
to stop doing something when IMO it wasnt a safety issue, that i<br/>
think it becomes sort of a discrimination-against-kid-behavior<br/>
issue.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Was he doing something an adult would not have done?<br/>
Had an adult been doing that same thing, would the employee have asked the <br/>
adult to stop?<br/>
