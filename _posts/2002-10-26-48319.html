<br/>
You can&#39;t keep him any longer than he&#39;s willing to be there.  Two of my <br/>
friends killed themselves, one at 14, one at 15.  Many people I&#39;ve known<br/>
have <br/>
run away.  They would rather sleep in an alley in a scary city than stay<br/>
with <br/>
their overbearing parents.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have watched several families who raised their children with this<br/>
strict and overbearing mindset.  When the children were able to leave<br/>
they did and lost all control.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra posted on this, I think.  They have had no practice thinking for<br/>
themselves and they seem to think that if they aren&#39;t &quot;obedient&quot; in every<br/>
way they must be totally &quot;forsaken&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The parents, in all cases, decided that Satan had just &quot;gotten&quot; them.<br/>
