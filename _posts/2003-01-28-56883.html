<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-251722818">Just going to jump in here with some quick thoughts.  It seems as though you need to reorient your thinking about math first, and then take whatever steps necessary to satisfy the college (play the game).<br/>
<br/>
Remember that mathematics is a SCIENCE.  Any real mathematician will tell you that.<br/>
<br/>
Arithmetic is a FOREIGN LANGUAGE and by itself has very little to do with mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematics is ALL AROUND you.  Arithmetic is just the language used to express the mathematics that is ALREADY THERE.<br/>
<br/>
What happened when we didn&#39;t have arithmetic?  How did arithmetic come into existance?<br/>
<br/>
Did you know Gallileo invented the first thermometer and it did not have numbers?<br/>
<br/>
Ponder that for awhile.<br/>
