<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347875483"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;DEBI WROTE: We play the rest (except for backgammon -- I never <br/>
 </span></blockquote>really understood it myself, so I can&#39;t help the kids with it, and <br/>
haven&#39;t come across a rulebook for it in the second hand store yet.)<br/>
FWIW, I already knew how to play, but I found backgammon on <br/>
playsite.com.  there is a link to the rules, plus your kids could <br/>
just dive in and TRY to play with other online gamers and figure it <br/>
out on their own.  It&#39;s really not that complicated a game.  I think <br/>
there&#39;s even a way to watch another game in progress!  <br/>
I just signed on with pogo.com as well.  They have the rules to <br/>
backgammon, if you or your kids are interested!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NED WROTE: If you want to quit smoking, do you smoke the rest of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the pack just because you&#39;ve paid for them?  -- Yup!  I have done <br/>
that several times (hopefully I&#39;m really off them now!) *wink*<br/>
<br/>
I know this has nothing to do with swim classes, I just thought it <br/>
was funny!  *L*<br/>
