<br/>
Sounds like my dh and yes, Multiplication tables was big on his list.  We<br/>
talked at length about WHY the kids need to know those things (so they can<br/>
hurry up and finish math tests) and do those reasons continue to apply if<br/>
the kids aren&#39;t subjected to things like tests.<br/>
<br/>
It also helped that we set a time limit (2 years) when we would reassess how<br/>
things were going.  I asked him to trust me not to do things that were<br/>
hurtful to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Then he watched the kids grow.  My now 5yo who has never had any kind of<br/>
&quot;instruction&quot; from me knows her colors and numbers and letters.  She knows a<br/>
few words to sight read and can do simple addition on her fingers (She likes<br/>
to announce &quot;I know what plus 2 is 2 is --meaning what 2 +2= ).  I think the<br/>
biggest thing is that people never seem concerned about our kids being<br/>
dullards (OK, Zach&#39;s sunday school teacher thinks he should be reading by 8)<br/>
but mostly people comment on how bright our children seem to be..<br/>

think he should start that year, because he wouldn&#39;t even be 5 yet. <br/>
(October birthday)  He didn&#39;t hesitate about that.  &quot;Oh no, he shouldn&#39;t <br/>
start this year.&quot;  I figured we&#39;d probably have to have the big talk about <br/>
it at some point, but I just acted as if we were homeschooling.  (Of course <br/>
I secretly hoped that Lars would be an early reader, thinking that would <br/>
help with the discussion.)  Well, the discussion never happened.  Lars was <br/>
obviously doing fine (even though he didn&#39;t read for ages) and that was <br/>
that.  Now dh is a big unschooling fan.  He says he thinks that Lars would <br/>
have ended up being a bully if he went to school.  (Big strong kid, already <br/>
showing some aggressive tendencies in preschool)<br/>

preschool kids did.  I made a mental note to play colour lotto or something <br/>
but never got around to it.  A couple of months later, I realized that he <br/>
knew them.  I suppose maybe I started using the words in conversation more, <br/>
but not consciously.<br/>
