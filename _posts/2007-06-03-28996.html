<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169560510">So the other day we went to the mall to meet up with some friends to <br/>
play. We stopped in a coffee shop and I bought all my children <br/>
chocolate milkboxes. I put the straws in and my son wigged out b/c <br/>
he wanted to do his own. I didn&#39;t know this and was very sorry. But <br/>
this led to a 1/2 an hour long fit. He wanted me to buy another one. <br/>
I didn&#39;t want to buy another one but wished I did just to save us <br/>
from his wig out session. After a half an hour he finally accepted <br/>
it asked for it back to drink it. <br/>
My son has outbursts when something doesn&#39;t go the way he thinks it <br/>
should and he has very intense emotions. He gets frustrated very <br/>
easily. When this happens the only thing I can do is to leave him <br/>
alone to cool off. And Im OK with that. I know some people just need <br/>
time. <br/>
But is the yelling and screaming at everyone something that he will <br/>
grow out of? He is only 6 now. My cousin was like this and is now 18 <br/>
and still has the problems. He&#39;s even gone to jail for having an <br/>
outburst on a police officer. I guess Im just worried. B/c I want <br/>
him to be able to have healthy relationships where he can work <br/>
things out in a healthy way. And I want him to be able to accept the <br/>
things he cant change and not let it take away from his enjoyment of <br/>
life. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can help? And what to <br/>
do in these situations?</div>

Think of the cost of counselling or psychiatry, and consider that a  <br/>
carton of milk is practically FREE compared to that.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask him more often what he wants.   Moms sometimes just do  <br/>
things automatically without even looking at the kid to see what he  <br/>
wants, and then they justify it and blame the kid.<br/>
<br/>
There were probably other factors involved too, stressing him out,  <br/>
but I would guess he felt ignored and disregarded.<br/>

The less ignored your son is now, the more he will learn to be  <br/>
generous with others. He might forever have very quick biochemistry,  <br/>
but if he knows what it feels like for people to be compassionate,  <br/>
he&#39;ll be more likely to want to show compassion too, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when he&#39;s calm, talk to him about ways to calm down if he&#39;s  <br/>
feeling frustration or fury.  Breathing.  Walking away a little ways  <br/>
and breathing, maybe.  Going to the bathroom and washing his hands  <br/>
while he breaths.<br/>

Maybe talk to him about your own frustrations and how you&#39;ve dealt  <br/>
with them, but conversationally as they come up, not as a big lecture.<br/>
<br/>
Are you considering your not getting him another carton in the  <br/>
category of things he can&#39;t change?  If his requests and persuasion  <br/>
and words can&#39;t make a change, is it fair to say &quot;things he can&#39;t  <br/>
change&quot; about it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354941869">Hi,I&#39;m new to this group and haven&#39;t introduced myself yet but want to respond to this post if I may.<br/>
  I too have a son who is quick to have meltdowns. He will melt over seemingly insignificant things. BUT,they are not insignificant to him. I&#39;ve been a mama for 27 years,5 children and he is by far the most emotional,sensitive child I have. <br/>
  It may seem to the world outside that I *give in* alot. Contrary,it&#39;s not giving in,it&#39;s being mature enough myself to see my *child* having a hard time with emotions he couldn&#39;t explain if he tried(being a child) that I find the best way to help him not explode. If I see an explosion starting to brew I do whatever I can to dissuade it.<br/>
  For instance,he wanted to wear his underwear underneath his swim trunks. My husband told him to take off his underwear,that he didn&#39;t need them with his trunks. Kenny started to cry,my husband saw that it mattered to Kenny to have his underwear on,so he said hey son,it&#39;s alright if you want to wear your underwear too,no big deal. That was it. Kenny didn&#39;t meltdown. We went to the pool and had a great time.<br/>
  We have potential meltdowns everyday,or meltdowns period. I just go with the flow,love him,try to validate his feelings,and take nice  naps when I can so I can recharge. <br/>
  I&#39;ve learned alot from this little guy. Mainly to be flexible in my thinking,to be more compassionate,to truly *see* through a childs eyes and heart.<br/>

If you want to call a candle a &quot;hammer,&quot; that doesn&#39;t make it a <br/>

&quot;giving in,&quot; and they like to call them &quot;power struggles,&quot; but that <br/>
does not make it so!<br/>
<br/>
The beautiful look of gratitude and appreciation on my son&#39;s face <br/>
when he understands that I hear him and am helping him get what he <br/>
needs is worth, to me, a whole case of milk boxes.  That look on his <br/>
face tells a deeper story of learning compassion and understanding <br/>
(for me and for other folks).  Who knew that a simple three-letter <br/>
word could have such a profound effect!?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  First...was the 18 year old unschooled? Did he get lots of  undivided attention from his parents?  I think often when children are raised being told what to do and when to do it with little regard for what they want and how they feel , they do not learn to consider other peoples feeling, wants, needs, very well. <br/>
   <br/>
  I was a bit worried about my 4 year old.....she had been in school a short time while I was having to work then i quit and we pulled the girls out, She asked permission for everything. <br/>
  I have to admit I felt annoyed by all the can I ........questions at first. Then they changed she was no longer asking can i watch tv , or go to the bathroom its can I give you a kiss , can I pour the milk for you when I was getting a bowl of cereal. I believe she has seen me care about what she wants and thinks to ask me because maybe *I* wanted to pour my own milk :) <br/>
  My 4 year old is very spirited and we have had this same drink problem only with a straw in sprite. Finances are very tight and I truly didnt have money to buy a new one but would have if I did .....so i removed the straw and offered a new one. This compromise was accepted and we went on with our lunch. <br/>
   <br/>
  In your post you said I want him to accept the things he cant change. Some things cant be changed, like the death of a relative. Getting a new milk , or a new straw and milk closed and re-open can be changed ....either by doing it yourself or persuading another to do it for you.<br/>

<br/>
I know exactly what you are talking about here. My oldest is exactly<br/>
the same way. Can you tell at the very beginning of the day whether<br/>
it&#39;s going to be a &quot;good&quot; day or a &quot;bad&quot; day? I can tell with Karlos<br/>
from the minute that he wakes up whether he will fight me about<br/>
everything all day long or whether we can all get along famously.<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to give you advice, because every family has it&#39;s own<br/>
way of doing things and what works for me might now necessarily work<br/>
for you. What I will do is recommend the book &quot;Raising Your Spirited<br/>
Child&quot; by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka. I wish someone would have given me<br/>
that book to read when I first got married before I even thought about<br/>
having children. It would have saved us so much struggle and<br/>
heartache. I found it so helpful in addressing my concerns, helping me<br/>
to move past my frustrations and actually having solid steps for me to<br/>
take to understand and help my child instead of just mindlessly<br/>
disciplining him.<br/>
<br/>
Be encouraged, our kids are going to be the movers and shakers in the<br/>
adult world if we can help them to use the gifts and talents they were<br/>
given for good instead of for ill. I believe in you Tina, you are a<br/>
good mother and you are going to make it through, and so are your kids.<br/>

On behalf of Karlos, I wish to object to this statement.<br/>
On behalf of all other children whose parents read this list, I wish  <br/>
to say that declaring a whole day good or bad is a fallacy and a trap.<br/>
<br/>
If one moment isn&#39;t good, the next moment can be better.<br/>
If a mother decides that she knows at the beginning that something  <br/>
will be &quot;a bad day,&quot; why should she take any responsibility for  <br/>
improving 8:20 or 9:10, or to wait just another couple of seconds  <br/>
before she decides how to respond to someone or something?<br/>
<br/>
One of the most valuable things I&#39;ve ever learned in the unschooling  <br/>
discussions online was someone years ago who said she never thought  <br/>
of &quot;a bad day,&quot; but thought there were bad moments.<br/>
<br/>
People can live with bad moments, and overcome them, and move on to  <br/>
much better moments.<br/>

We can&#39;t really tell from a distance whether someone&#39;s a good mother  <br/>
and their friends will make it through, can we?<br/>
These kinds of affirming statements are really common on some women&#39;s  <br/>
discussion lists, but I&#39;d prefer to keep this list to ideas about  <br/>
learning and unschooling.  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and not about  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898180084">Hey, everyone, thanks for the responses. I want to let you all know <br/>
that I do spend alot of time with Isaiah. We watch tv together, we <br/>
cuddle alot, read stories, play outside. As much as possible with <br/>
the other 3. I felt like some people were making it sound like I <br/>
ignore my son and neglect his needs.  <br/>
I knew I should&#39;ve got him the other milk. No the other kids would <br/>
not have drank it. I thought I was being sensitive to his needs when <br/>
I bought him what he asked for. But it would have made him feel like <br/>
I cared a/b his feelings if I bought him the other one- I agree with <br/>
you all on that. It was my mistake. It is difficult when I go out to <br/>
make sure I am meeting every single childs needs all of the time. <br/>
And I do try. I was standing in line at the coffee shop with the <br/>
baby in my arms. my 2 yr old in the stroller trying to distract him <br/>
so he wouldnt climb out and run off and the other 2 who are prone to <br/>
wondering. So when I got them their drinks I was hurrying to get <br/>
them to them so we could make it to the play area before my 2 babies <br/>
started to cry. <br/>
Even today when we went to the mall to get some toys and some <br/>
icecream. My older 2 take off running when we get in the mall and I <br/>
have my toddler in my hand. ( My hubby kept the baby) Maya won the <br/>
race and Isaiah wigged b/c he wasnt first and sat down in the chair <br/>
and threw his money down and said he wasnt going anywhere. I got on <br/>
his level and asked him if he would like to be the leader on the way <br/>
to the icecream and he said no. Meanwhile Mayas wondering off into a <br/>
store and Ezra is fighting me to run off as well. So I was being <br/>
very sensitive in this situation but still didnt know what to do. Im <br/>
trying the best I can-the best I know. That is why I come here to <br/>
get suggestions and different ideas. <br/>
We want to go out and enjoy our time together but I usually end up <br/>
feeling frazzled and like I cant handle it. I try explainig and <br/>
suggesting and distraction but sometimes it is so overwhelming.<br/>
I am not into controlling my kids or bossing them around and think <br/>
of them as people not as objects at my command. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The feeling I&#39;m getting from your post is that this is all very<br/>
overwhelming and chaotic, not only for you but also for Isaiah.  I<br/>
understand that you all want to go out, but perhaps you could pick<br/>
less stimulating, intense destinations than the mall (just for now)?<br/>
<br/>
In this example you gave, it sounds like Isaiah has a hard time with<br/>
competition.  I forget how old he is, but some folks just don&#39;t do<br/>
competition well (and they usually, but now always, grow out of it). <br/>
I would be on the alert for these kinds of situations and try to head<br/>
them off with whatever tool I could find.  My goal would be to replace<br/>
the yucky feelings with Joyful times.<br/>
<br/>
For example, my son has never done competition too well and would get<br/>
very upset if someone else won.  So, we defuse competitions by goofing<br/>
about it.  He and my husband came up with changing things up so that<br/>
the *last* one there wins, or you don&#39;t win unless you&#39;ve cheated. <br/>
Now, instead of getting hot under the collar and taking things so<br/>
seriously, there&#39;s gales of laughter around races to the car, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Other games like chess and Monopoly and poker are more fun now because<br/>
Liam (now 12) sees how he can learn from playing with someone who is<br/>
more adept at the game than he is.  But, this is a recent change, and<br/>
we just stayed away from stuff like that until now.<br/>
<br/>
Our situation is different than yours because our son has no sibs to<br/>
measure himself to, but perhaps you and Isaiah and Maya can come up<br/>
with creative ideas (during calmer times) to eliminate competitive<br/>
situations and replace them with fun for fun&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
But, I would really consider toning down the outings to keep Isaiah in<br/>
less stressful situations until you feel that he would be better able<br/>
to handle them.  Or, perhaps consider going on special outings with<br/>
just him sometimes and just Maya sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am not into controlling my kids or bossing them around and think <br/>
&gt; of them as people not as objects at my command. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the only two choices you have are either allowing chaos<br/>
or being authoritarian.  If you can look at situations that arise<br/>
through a lens of how you can best help your kids get what they need,<br/>
and if you keep Joy as your goal for you and for your kids, you&#39;ll<br/>
probably come closer to finding solutions for this dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644947805">There is a lady on unschooling basics who has 6...I think 6 kids. How do you feel about your e-mail being posted there to see what suggestions she or maybe someone else has?<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Is a mothers helper an option? An older child who could go with you on some trips and help keep an eye on kids in exchange for a small payment or treat while you are out shopping?<br/>
   <br/>
  Is going other places besides the mall an option? Not saying thats all you go to but perhaps leaving most or all kids with dh to get something you need at the mall and taking the kids somehwere a bit less crowded with more room to run around?<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699056399">Don&#39;t go to the mall with all those little kids - that is  <br/>
overwhelming for you AND them.<br/>
You could have stayed home with all of them and your husband could  <br/>
have run out for some ice cream. Malls are awful for those of us who  <br/>
are more sensitive to sound and lighting and temperature and have a  <br/>
smidgen of claustrophobia and feel crowded by too many people all in  <br/>
one place. I&#39;m 55 and can barely be in a mall for an hour before I  <br/>
feel the effects - I start feeling impatient and cranky.<br/>
<br/>
Really - I&#39;d bet my house that your real problem is that you&#39;re  <br/>
trying to do too much with those young children and your son is the  <br/>
one who is sort of the &quot;lightening rod&quot; of the family - all the  <br/>
tension and stress comes out in him.<br/>
<br/>
  Read, &quot;The Explosive Child,&quot; by Ross Greene, focusing on the parts  <br/>
about setting up a working environment. Try to create a calm oasis in  <br/>
your own home and yard - make it possible for him to play with and in  <br/>
water a lot (very soothing), to always have the option of spending  <br/>
time alone (so he never has the feeling of being trapped in close  <br/>
proximity to other people, including siblings), give him hours and  <br/>
hours of uninterrupted pretend-play time (this is the time he  <br/>
desperately needs for working through all kinds of anxieties).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590375952">We took them to see Shrek 3 today and Maya wanted to get a toy so we <br/>
told her wed take her later. We went home and counted her money and <br/>
went to the dollar store which is in the mall and she wanted <br/>
icecream which was in the mall as well. Isaiah wanted to join in so <br/>
Im being sensitive to thier needs planning to do things they want to <br/>
do. I personally cant stand going to the mall. But went for them.<br/>
We go out and do lots of things. They like to go to the science <br/>
center,the park, the coffee shops, the zoo.<br/>
I think that is part of unschooling-being ready to open up the world <br/>
for our children to learn. If we stayed home he would be asking to <br/>
go somewhere and my hubby works so it is always me and the children.<br/>
No, Isaiah doesnt deal with competition well or taking turns. He <br/>
gets severely pissed off and doesnt understand why he cant go.<br/>
We went to a rocketry presentation with our homeschooling group and <br/>
they were taking turns finding the rockets in groups and Isaiah got <br/>
so angry that he couldnt go every time. He walked off and was <br/>
screaming. But I cant talk to him when he gets like this, it just <br/>
escalates so I watched from a distance giving him the space to cool <br/>
down. This is something he wanted to go to and once we got there <br/>
Maya and Ezra enjoyed it so much. Just another example. This is a <br/>
regular thing when we go out. And I feel so bad when he gets upset. <br/>
I just want him to be able to enjoy the things he wants to do. It <br/>
makes me sad b/c I feel like I should be able to help him but dont <br/>
know how. :(<br/>

I think your son was indicating it very, very clearly but you hoped  <br/>

<br/>
Instead of blaming your son for being too quick to be upset, what if  <br/>
you start to look at that as reasonable communication in the only way  <br/>
he can find to get your attention?<br/>
<br/>
The suggestions about not going to the mall are sound.<br/>

If he has two or three younger siblings, he might have been feeling  <br/>
left out and needy since the first one of them was born.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to have so many children so quickly that the mom can&#39;t  <br/>
provide them all with the touch and direct attention and mom-gaze  <br/>
that they would like to have (or need).  I know it&#39;s not popular or  <br/>
politically correct to say so, but if four isn&#39;t too many, would five  <br/>
be?  Six?  Seven?<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t reason away the fact that he&#39;s needy.  More of his needs  <br/>
need to be met somehow.<br/>

much. You don&#39;t have to go out to all those activities, now. They&#39;ll  <br/>
all be there later, too. The kids will get even more out of them as  <br/>
they get older. Create a warm and cozy nest, first and foremost.<br/>
<br/>
When they ask to go out to a museum or movie or to buy a toy or  <br/>
whatever, you can accommodate that, but it doesn&#39;t have to be today  <br/>

I think four is too many if the children aren&#39;t getting the attention  <br/>
they want and need.  I never said four weren&#39;t enough.  Perhaps you  <br/>
could read back through the posts of today and see if you were  <br/>

There are hundreds or thousands of places moms can go for other moms  <br/>

There are very few places moms can go to get free advice from people  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327176032">I wasnt looking for soothing. And I did read the suggestions and <br/>
thought about them and am still thinking about them. And I am <br/>
grateful for the advice. <br/>
But my situation is what it is. I am a young mom doing something I <br/>
have never seen modeled before and I have four children. I cant do <br/>
anything about that. I cannot go back in time and say oh, I only <br/>
want one child for now. It is what it is. And after Isaiah had his <br/>
fit we went and played in the play area and he had a great time. <br/>
They all did.It was fun and the only thing I would change is buying <br/>
him that other damn milk box. Im sure he was frustrated and I see <br/>
how he may have felt like I wasnt hearing him. But I am not going to <br/>
stop taking them to the play area. They really enjoy that even if <br/>
there are a few mishaps on the way. But I know that I pay attention <br/>
to him and my others as much as I can. My house is pretty much <br/>
trashed all the time b/c I am either with them or researching <br/>
unschooling on the net to get more ideas. I am putting a great <br/>
effort into this. I was just wondering if anyone else has gone <br/>
through this and could make some suggestions. Which some of you did. <br/>
I do believe that some things are just growing and learning for the <br/>
child. That you cant blame the parent for everything. You can blame <br/>
the parent for how they handle the situation but the child still has <br/>
the choice to make and that is something you can never change. <br/>
Influence-yes but change, no. You can give the child all the <br/>
attention in the world and they will still have outbursts and fits. <br/>
It may not be as frequent but Im sure it will happen sooner or later.<br/>
My children are happy and I enjoy them very much. And this is <br/>
something that happens when we go out but Im sure with more work and <br/>
more sensitivty it will change over time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332939912"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;It is possible to have so many children so quickly that the mom can&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>provide them all with the touch and direct attention and mom-gaze<br/>
that they would like to have (or need).&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read beyond this post, but had to say a resounding YES!! to this<br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
Having had 4 in 5 years, it WAS impossible to meet all their real needs all<br/>
the time. And while I know there is value in having siblings and even maybe<br/>
having to wait on occasion, each one of my kids was definitely shortchanged.<br/>
&quot;It takes a village&quot; means to me that the more trustworthy, loving adults in<br/>
our kids lives, the better. I once read a study that concluded that for each<br/>
member of a family to have their needs well taken care of, every child had<br/>
to have four caring adults taking care of them.<br/>
<br/>
So our individual families in our individual homes with one or more working<br/>
parents may not be the best scenario for having many children.<br/>
<br/>
Mine do seem to be doing well though :o) If we chose another lifestyle, they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be as whole and healthy as they are.<br/>
<br/>
With lots of young kids in a family, simplifying life seems pretty<br/>
important. No malls with all of them. I used to sit on the front lawn with<br/>
baby on the blanket and siblings blowing bubbles, dancing, picnicking, etc.<br/>
Most of our activities and excitement were within our own home-made space.<br/>
Our outings in public were usually not much fun for anyone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;You can&#39;t reason away the fact that he&#39;s needy. More of his needs<br/>
&gt;&gt;need to be met somehow.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of my kids was very needy emotionally, and had different and more<br/>
immediate and intense needs than his siblings.<br/>
<br/>
I think one key is to find the space, energy and time to be with each child<br/>
alone, and see through their eyes. Give them sole and undivided attention.<br/>
We made sure that one of us (dh and I) had alone time with each child each<br/>
day. That made a HUGE difference in our kids&#39; lives...they knew that if<br/>
their needs weren&#39;t met at some point during the day because mom was taking<br/>
care of someone else, they would get their time soon.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to always support each one completely all the time though, even<br/>
with a brood.<br/>

had more children than you can take care of.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She meant there is a reality in your life that your children&#39;s needs  <br/>
exceed your ability to meet them all.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean give up. It means putting them in a stressful  <br/>
situation is not only going to be too much for you and them, it&#39;s  <br/>
going to be *way* too much.<br/>
<br/>
You need to pull back to the point where you can meet your children&#39;s  <br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So your kids never had an outburst?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A mom with a single child having an outburst is a different situation  <br/>
than a mom with two kids, one of which is having an outburst. It  <br/>
isn&#39;t even in the same book as a mom with more kids than she can  <br/>
handle at a mall that&#39;s stressing them out with a child having an  <br/>
outburst.<br/>
<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t the outburst. The problem is all that lead up to  <br/>
the outburst. One problem is lots of kids. That&#39;s just your reality.  <br/>
Right now it&#39;s raining. That&#39;s my reality. It means if I go outside  <br/>
without adequate protection I&#39;m going to get wet.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is adding to the stress.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My son has outbursts when something doesn&#39;t go the way<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is also part of your reality.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra just posted a bit of what I wrote on this but sometimes advice  <br/>
for others seems like it isn&#39;t meant for our particular situation.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting advice focuses on children&#39;s behavior and what  <br/>
to do in a particular situation. If a child is having a melt down, do  <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parenting advice focuses on the cause of the behaviors and  <br/>
helps parents figure out ways to adjust their environments to prevent  <br/>
as many of the problems as possible. An outburst is an opportunity to  <br/>
figure out what went wrong and what you might do next time to avoid  <br/>
what lead up to it. Sometimes you have to move many steps back.<br/>
<br/>
Meltdowns will happen and you deal with them as best you can, giving  <br/>
a child as much love and attention as he needs. (And if a new milk  <br/>
will help, a new milk.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We want to go out and enjoy our time together but I usually end up<br/>
&gt; feeling frazzled and like I cant handle it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is the crux. Some mothers will be able to take 4 kids to  <br/>
the mall and all will have a great time but that&#39;s because she has a  <br/>
different mix of personalities.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s way easier to help someone who has a small problem in a  <br/>
particular situation than to help someone who is putting themselves  <br/>
in a situation where there are so many problems that it leads to her  <br/>
being frazzled. The *real* problem is going into situations that  <br/>
create way more problems than you can handle.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way. You can adequately juggle 4 balls. You&#39;re  <br/>
trying to add 20 balls (by going to the mall or whatever situation  <br/>
creates frazzlement) and then asking for advice on how to handle the  <br/>
20 balls.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re saying, don&#39;t add so many balls! Try one more ball. Try putting  <br/>
down three balls and adding a plate.<br/>
<br/>
If kids + mall = crying kids and frazzled mom, take out the mall! ;-)  <br/>
Take one or two children to the mall. Take all the children to the park.<br/>
<br/>
Your reality is that all going out together *is* going to be  <br/>
stressful. There isn&#39;t a way around that with your particular  <br/>
children and your particular situation. Rethink where you take them  <br/>
for now. It might have been better for dad to take 1 or 2 kids to the  <br/>
movies and you take the others somewhere else. It might have been  <br/>
better to wait until Shrek came out on DVD.<br/>
<br/>
Engage your kids in the process. Approach it with a &quot;Let&#39;s see how we  <br/>
can work this out&quot; attitude. This might take some practice.  <br/>
Especially if kids feel their needs aren&#39;t being met, they won&#39;t care  <br/>
about stepping on the toes of others to get what they want. They  <br/>
might feel the youngest&#39;s needs for less stress aren&#39;t as important  <br/>
as their need for a toy. Rather than an indication of selfish  <br/>
children, it&#39;s an indication of needs that aren&#39;t being met. When  <br/>
kids are full and know they don&#39;t need to worry about not being full,  <br/>
they don&#39;t need to fight each other to get what they need and can in  <br/>
fact be generous and give up something for someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Kids need to know that the parent takes the request for a toy  <br/>
seriously and will get it for them when the situation will be good  <br/>
for everyone. It can take a while of doing that in order for kids to  <br/>
trust that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742710551">-=-When kids are full and know they don&#39;t need to worry about not  <br/>
being full,<br/>
they don&#39;t need to fight each other to get what they need and can in<br/>

<br/>
This is my experience with food, toys, space, time...<br/>
My kids hang out together quite a bit, but not always.  Because they  <br/>
know (because Holly, the youngest, knows, mostly) that there will be  <br/>
another time soon that they&#39;re all included, none of them get jealous  <br/>
or angry when one or two of the others do something they&#39;re not in on.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly were left out all the time, she would be really needy and  <br/>
clingy, but they include her most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
The prom I wrote about (I think on this list) came off, and I think I  <br/>
had said four of the 22 were unschoolers, but there were five, and  <br/>
then another showed up.  So six kids of 23 were unschoolers.  (Just  <br/>
for the record, and I think that&#39;s part of what has caused that group  <br/>
to include such a wide range of ages, because my kids are willing to  <br/>
share with each other.)<br/>
<br/>
It was hard when Kirby was five and Holly was born.  There were  <br/>
things I couldn&#39;t do with three children.  Kirby needed more time and  <br/>
touch and attention that he didn&#39;t get, and it showed then and it  <br/>
shows now.  If I was  holding Holly and Holding Marty&#39;s hand, Kirby  <br/>
held onto the diaper bag.  A diaper bag just isn&#39;t a mom.  Kirby had  <br/>
to keep his toys up from the other kids, and defend his fragile  <br/>
things, and that was hard for him.<br/>
<br/>
When people live in very small houses, the advice is often for them  <br/>
to get out and about into larger spaces.  When people have very  <br/>
little money, the advice is about finding interesting things to do  <br/>
that are stimulating but not expensive.  People who live in cities  <br/>
need to find time to get to a park, at least, if not out of town into  <br/>
the mountains or desert.  People who live way out of town need to  <br/>
find time to get their kids into town sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
The more balance a family has, the more peaceful and calm they are.   <br/>
Too much quiet and boredom doesn&#39;t contribute to learning, but  <br/>
neither does too much stimulation and stress.<br/>
<br/>
I have three short pieces that touch on the things above, and the  <br/>
&quot;nest&quot; page (Pam Sorooshian wrote something very helpful), if  anyone  <br/>
wants to read some more.<br/>

<br/>
A parent came here for ideas, the child didn&#39;t.<br/>
If the parent expects the child to go 50/50 on solutions, that&#39;s not  <br/>
going to work.<br/>
If the mom can change her actions or expectations, the child will  <br/>
benefit.<br/>
If the parent expects the child to change, or understand things at an  <br/>
adult level, neither child nor parent benefits.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You can blame<br/>
the parent for how they handle the situation but the child still has<br/>
the choice to make and that is something you can never change.<br/>

<br/>
The more ideal the situation for the child, the better choices he can  <br/>
make.<br/>
The more choices the child has, the sooner he will learn to make  <br/>
better choices.<br/>
The better choices he makes now, the better choices he will make in  <br/>
the future, when he&#39;s older, when he&#39;s a parent.<br/>
<br/>
For me (and some others, I know), having children was a catalyst or  <br/>
tool for working through and recovering from some bad parenting from  <br/>
childhood.  Giving my children opportunities and choices I didn&#39;t  <br/>
have when I was their age made me feel better about the world and  <br/>
about the value of experiences and advantages.  I could have just  <br/>
justified my mom&#39;s choices and repeated them, but it hadn&#39;t been good  <br/>
for me, and I didn&#39;t want to pass that on.<br/>
<br/>
Most people on this list and in similar discussions are also looking  <br/>
for ways to make more compassionate and generous decisions in their  <br/>
parenting.   There are lots of people here with lots of experiences  <br/>
to share, and ideas to offer.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You can give the child all the<br/>
attention in the world and they will still have outbursts and fits.<br/>

<br/>
This sounds like justification and self comfort, but not logic.<br/>
It sounds like &quot;it&#39;s not my fault,&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t change it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When a mom feels helpless, she becomes helpless.<br/>
When a mom sees  her choices, she can make choices.<br/>
The more choices the mom has, the better choices she can make.<br/>

He usually sleeps later than me and has also never expressed any<br/>
interest in helping me with that so he was pretty upset.  I sat with<br/>
him and talked to him and we talked about him helping me set up the<br/>
coffee pot in the evening so that he won&#39;t miss out on it in the<br/>
morning while he&#39;s sleeping.  He was still a little grumpy though, not<br/>
my happy, smiley guy so I decided to try something new.  I said &quot;where<br/>
is Trevor&#39;s joy?  did someone take his happy&quot;? and I started looking<br/>
under things and behind things saying &quot;where did his happy go?&quot; and he<br/>
started to smile and laugh and was saying &quot;Mom, your silly&quot; but he was<br/>
enjoying it and brightening up.  We finally found his joy in a shell<br/>
and he listened to the ocean and the joy went back into him through<br/>
his ear. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Its a little silly but I&#39;m finding more and more that I have to be a<br/>
little on the unconventional and silly side to help us all find joy in<br/>
our days.  Don&#39;t think of it as a prelude him &quot;fighting with you or<br/>

able to find a way to bring joy into your day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245190165">Hi Tina, <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read any of the other posts so I apologise if I repeat <br/>
anything. <br/>
<br/>
As someone who&#39;s only been on this planet for six short years, he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have it all figured out yet. Give him some time to grow and <br/>
mature. What type of behavior do you and your husband model to him <br/>
when things don&#39;t go your way? I myself have a quick temper when <br/>
things don&#39;t go the way I&#39;d planned and I&#39;ve had to really examine <br/>
that because I don&#39;t want the same for my daughters.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, please don&#39;t compare him to someone else. Every situation is <br/>
different. Who knows what your cousins life was like? <br/>
<br/>
How much were the milk boxes? Were they that expensive that your son <br/>
being upset for 30 minutes was more important? Or were you trying to <br/>
teach him a &quot;lesson&quot;? Do you think maybe the lesson was that (in the <br/>
mind of a six year old upset boy) &quot;Mom doesn&#39;t care how I feel or <br/>
what I want. She doesn&#39;t understand how important it was to me&#39;. Did <br/>
he finally give up after 30 minutes, thinking you didn&#39;t care what <br/>
he wanted. <br/>
<br/>
Just some food for thought. Please don&#39;t take it as an attack <br/>
because it&#39;s not meant to be. Imagine us just hanging out and having <br/>
a conversation. :-)<br/>

&gt; So the other day we went to the mall to meet up with some friends <br/>
to <br/>

&gt; he wanted to do his own. I didn&#39;t know this and was very sorry. <br/>
But <br/>
&gt; this led to a 1/2 an hour long fit. He wanted me to buy another <br/>
one. <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t want to buy another one but wished I did just to save us <br/>
&gt; from his wig out session. After a half an hour he finally accepted <br/>
&gt; it asked for it back to drink it. <br/>
&gt; My son has outbursts when something doesn&#39;t go the way he thinks <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; should and he has very intense emotions. He gets frustrated very <br/>
&gt; easily. When this happens the only thing I can do is to leave him <br/>
&gt; alone to cool off. And Im OK with that. I know some people just <br/>
need <br/>
&gt; time. <br/>
&gt; But is the yelling and screaming at everyone something that he <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; grow out of? He is only 6 now. My cousin was like this and is now <br/>
18 <br/>
&gt; and still has the problems. He&#39;s even gone to jail for having an <br/>

&gt; things out in a healthy way. And I want him to be able to accept <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; things he cant change and not let it take away from his enjoyment <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; life. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can help? And what <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; do in these situations?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969643196">Thank you guys so much for your suggestions. It has cuased me to <br/>
reevaluate my life with my children and make the changes that need <br/>
to be made to meet their needs better. I have already begun to do <br/>
some things differently and have seen a change. I appreciate all the <br/>
time put into responding to my questions. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Erica I love that . <br/>
   <br/>
  I &quot;superglue&quot; my kids hands to the car. one hand each when we get out of the van . It keeps them from running out into the parking lot and I know all hands are away from the sliding door when I close it. Then i make a big deal out of pulling them free and we hold hands and laugh and giggle our way into the store. <br/>
   <br/>
  ps...when hot in the summer I spray the &quot;superglue&quot; on their feet<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219813325">Ah, yes. Power struggles. What are those things exactly? I never have <br/>
found out. I&#39;m the World&#39;s Biggest Softy as far as my children are <br/>
concerned - I give in every time. And my children are two of the most <br/>
delightful people I&#39;ve ever known. I wonder if there&#39;s a connection.<br/>

&gt; If you want to call a candle a &quot;hammer,&quot; that doesn&#39;t make it a <br/>
&gt; hammer!  Folks see situations like kids having meltdowns and moms <br/>
&gt; &quot;giving in,&quot; and they like to call them &quot;power struggles,&quot; but that <br/>
&gt; does not make it so!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The beautiful look of gratitude and appreciation on my son&#39;s face <br/>
&gt; when he understands that I hear him and am helping him get what he <br/>
&gt; needs is worth, to me, a whole case of milk boxes.  That look on <br/>
his <br/>
&gt; face tells a deeper story of learning compassion and understanding <br/>
&gt; (for me and for other folks).  Who knew that a simple three-letter <br/>
&gt; word could have such a profound effect!?<br/>
