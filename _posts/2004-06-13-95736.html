<div id="ygrps-yiv-383909804">My husband turned 50 this week too!  I had a small party with just <br/>
our &quot;neighborhood group&quot; and made prime rib for the first time. <br/>
(Recipe in Cook&#39;s Illustrated magazine - it was EASY!!!)<br/>
<br/>
But I did have a cool idea (I&#39;m sure I read it somewhere) when he <br/>
turned 40.  I asked all the guests to bring him 40 of something.  He <br/>
got stuff like 40 screws (not from me - at least not then  :-), 40 <br/>
pennies (from a favorite neighbor child), 40 feet of dental floss, 40 <br/>
ounces of BBQ sauce, 40 nails, 40 beers, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It was really fun.  Best gift was 40 winks - my friend had taken 40 <br/>
different pictures of people winking - she said he figured he could <br/>
use the rest. . . <br/>
<br/>
Anyway - maybe someone can use that idea. . .  it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
Mercedes<br/>
lots of math in counting to 40 (or 50)</div>

Hey thanks, I&#39;ll keep that one in mind!<br/>

Kristen, who might lose the eulogy and keep the &quot;black&quot; theme.<br/>
