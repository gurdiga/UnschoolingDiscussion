<div id="ygrps-yiv-462875229">When I was growing up there were never any cakes, cookies, or candy in the house. <br/>
Not even any sugar. If I was left alone, even for just a few minutes, I would sneak <br/>
honey, the only sweet thing available. <br/>
<br/>
When I was old enough to get an allowance, I spent it all on candy and cookies and <br/>
snack cakes. I would come home from school (mom was still at work) and pig out on <br/>
junk.  <br/>
<br/>
I started to have a weight problem when I was 11 or 12, around the same time that I <br/>
started getting enough allowance to really go crazy on the junk food. I would buy a <br/>
box of cookies and hide it under my bed. <br/>
<br/>
This was also the time when I was given lunch money instead of a bag lunch. I would <br/>
go to the school cafeteria, buy coffee and cookies, and dunk the cookies in my light <br/>
sweet coffee and that was lunch. Needless to say, I suffered from chronic headaches, <br/>
and would sometimes be passed out on the couch when my mom came home from <br/>
the sugar crash.<br/>
<br/>
I have been struggling with my weight ever since and I have a terrible sweet tooth. I <br/>
could eat cookies cake and ice cream all day long and it&#39;s very hard to control my <br/>
impulses. The only thing that helps is to eat a high-protein, moderate fat, low carb <br/>
diet. This helps even out my blood sugar and keeps the cravings at bay. <br/>
<br/>
I still have to fake out my sweet tooth with lots of artificial sweetener in my coffee, <br/>
sugar-free jello and pudding, etc. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that healthy to consume so much <br/>
aspartame and Splenda, but I&#39;d be 300 pounds otherwise. As it is, I am about 50 <br/>
pounds overweight (20 of it is baby weight, but my baby is 7 months old!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure, but perhaps if sweets had been treated with more of a &quot;no big deal&quot; <br/>
attiude (rather than as forbidden fruit) I might not have such a problem now. I could <br/>
be wrong. Just thought I&#39;d offer one perspective. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t understand. My family ONLY liked things that are good for you. We <br/>
ate healthy cereals in the morning, hot and cold. My lunch was peanut butter on <br/>
whole wheat bread, apple juice, and a piece of fruit every day from the first day of <br/>
kindergarten to the last day of 5th grade. I looked enviously at my friends who had <br/>
twinkies or puddings in their lunches. Dinner was stir fried vegetables with rice or <br/>
pasta with clam sauce or some other reasonably healthy food.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Growing up, I&#39;ve had very little sweets. But my parents<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love vegetables too! It&#39;s hard to be vegetarian if you don&#39;t like them, LOL. It&#39;s just <br/>
that everywhere I go I am tempted to indulge in unhealthy sweet stuff. If I am waiting <br/>
for a bus or subway I see the news kiosks selling candy and it&#39;s hard to resist. When I <br/>
am at the grocery store I try not to, but sometimes I buy cookies or ice cream. Once <br/>
they are in my house, I can&#39;t eat just one or two bites like some people can. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe just through example or maybe through talks on nutritional<br/>
&gt; value of food... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know what foods are nutritious, and I knew when I was a kid. It&#39;s not ignorance that <br/>
drives me. I know perfectly well that the junk food I crave is, well, junk. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I remember liking candy and pastries and even eating<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Inna (ee-nah, not ai-nah)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, not a freak of nature. LUCKY. I would give anything to be one of those people who <br/>
can just have a few bites of cake and leave the rest. Who knows, maybe I would be <br/>
even more overweight than I am if my mother had kept the house stocked with <br/>
sweets. <br/>
<br/>
My half-sister (on my dad&#39;s side) is allowed to eat whatever she wants whenever she <br/>
wants and is quite chunky and obsessed with food. My stepmother is hoping that not <br/>
restricting her intake or making her feel self-conscious about it might help her not be <br/>
so obsessed. <br/>
<br/>
She is only 9 and watches cooking shows (has been for years actually) and loves to <br/>
cook. The amount of tasting she does when preparing a meal is positively comical. <br/>
Stir, lick, stir, lick LOL. She&#39;s very athletic, and healthy, but she&#39;s big for her age, and <br/>
looks chubby. She may have a struggle ahead of her to stay within a healthy range, <br/>
she may outgrow it. <br/>
<br/>
I also have an aunt on my father&#39;s side who was extremely obese (at least 300 pounds <br/>
and only 5&#39;3&quot; or so). She&#39;s lost a lot of weight, but only after she turned 40 or so and <br/>
she&#39;s still above her optimal weight. So maybe it just runs in my family. <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to give my story so that people can weigh all of the different theories <br/>
when it comes to food and kids. Mine is just one possible outcome of one technique. <br/>

help with seasickness too. There must be something to it, people have been doing <br/>
Shiatsu and acupressure for thousands of years. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m doing better and better with the cravings as time goes on. I have been on a low-<br/>
carb diet since Jan 1st. I find the only thing that gets rid of my cravings for sugar is <br/>
eliminating it from my diet. Once I&#39;m a few more weeks into the diet I will be out of <br/>
the habit of having dessert every night and I won&#39;t rely so heavily on artificial <br/>
sweeteners. But I&#39;ll definitely try Stevia, it sounds more natural. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
