<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899075783">Joseph and Sierra both had trouble with those letters also. They even had a hard time with lower case Q because some books didn&#39;t even have a little tail on the bottom and it looked the same as a P but turned the other way. So between B, D, P and Q, it was confusing to them. This was before they were reading much. Just words really. So when I would write something for them, I would print in all caps which I always do anyway unless I force myself to do it right. &lt;bg&gt; That way they always knew what the letter was. I never printed in smaller case and the kids picked up knowing what those letters were anyway. When they would write something out, I would just mention that something was backwards. Never made a big deal out of it and they never were really frustrated with it either. If you don&#39;t see it as a big deal, they won&#39;t either. If they struggled with something, I never went through how they could remember or the differences, I would just tell them what the letter or word was. Same as when they asked me what a word was, I never made them sound it out. I use to hate that as a child. Just tell me what the freakin word is. So that&#39;s what I do with my kids. Somewhere along the way they learned. <br/>
<br/>
Every now and then, Joseph or Sierra will still turn a letter or number around. And when they play Twister, I still have to watch because they get right and left confused sometimes. Mostly Joseph. He&#39;s a lefty and Sierra is a righty so if they try to see what the other is doing, that doesn&#39;t work either!!<br/>
<br/>
My mom was an elementary teacher and also a nurse and she told me from the very beginning that it was very normal for kids to do that. Just keep telling your son it&#39;s no big deal and he will get the hang of it. All kids do.<br/>
