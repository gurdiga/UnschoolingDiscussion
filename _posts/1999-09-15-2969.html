<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407691536">thank you David, your first paragraph was interesting to me. i was thinking<br/>
the same thing.<br/>
Lisa, yours was a good perspective to, thanks.<br/>
Sam, my dd also has taken to spelling with more care because of email and<br/>
lettter writing, she asked my for a spelling book. i bought the natural<br/>
speller off a swap board<br/>
for her. she didnt want a workbook and she picked out the natural speller from<br/>
a catalog and i found it used.<br/>
i think my dh is an unschooler and doesnt know it, he just has periods of<br/>
&#39;freakoutness&#39;,<br/>
like alot of us have at times. him being the dad though it makes us all very<br/>
nervous when he does it!!<br/>

&gt; I guess I now qualify as a &quot;professional homeschooling dad&quot; and I would<br/>
&gt; have to agree that, for me, commitment to homeschooling came (comes?) a<br/>

&gt; man, much (too much) of my early self-esteem was tied up in making it in<br/>
&gt; the &quot;outside world&quot;, and &quot;making it&quot; was often seen (and often<br/>

&gt; other men who have come to understand similar damage in themselves.  I<br/>
&gt; would be careful in asserting that this damage is caused by schools --<br/>
&gt; it is definitely assisted and reinforced by schools -- but I think it<br/>
&gt; has much deeper cultural roots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the other reason (and I don&#39;t think this is a bad thing) is that my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182068995">I think it may be difficult for men who are still working and who have to<br/>
put up with the schooling attitude day in and day out. I know fathers who<br/>
say that the kids need to learn how to sit properly and how to follow<br/>
orders, etc. because that is what is needed in the &#39;real world&#39;. However,<br/>
SAHMs are removed from that world and can concentrate on learning. My dh is<br/>
primarily in charge of unschooling our kids so he is more relaxed and is<br/>
even more into it than I am, I am the one who works outside the home and<br/>
find myself getting caught up in the ps mentality (I teach at a community<br/>
college). Luckily my schedule is relaxed so my dh and I actually share the<br/>
unschooling aspect, but I am the organizer, motivater, mover alonger, while<br/>
he is the hanging out let the kids do it one. Just remember that the dhs<br/>
don&#39;t have the advantage of staying home and watching the kids live and<br/>
learn over time (weekends and evenings aren&#39;t enough, the dhs aren&#39;t<br/>
immersed in it then).<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I don&#39;t think it has to do with men so much as that they are the<br/>
ones working outside the home usually.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

Do you think it&#39;s because we moms are always with the kids?  I mean, I learn <br/>
about what my dd has learned/is learning from just listening to her everyday <br/>
conversations ... not about &quot;schooling&quot;....just everyday things......like <br/>
today, for instance, she had written a note to herself in ink on her hand (!) <br/>
and I happened to notice it......the child did not make even ONE mistake!!!  <br/>
Now, maybe that&#39;s not a big deal to some of you, but spelling has always been <br/>
a weakness for her.....she can read very well, but when asked to turn the <br/>
process around and spell, she had trouble.  Let me tell you all....this took <br/>
a LOT of faith on my part to just let it be and believe that it would work <br/>
itself out eventually.   Actually, she attributes it to the increased time <br/>
she spends on email.....she uses spellcheck sometimes, but on IMs (instant <br/>
messages), it takes too long...so she learned to spell when it was necessary <br/>
to learn how to spell!!!!!   Ahhhh, unschooling!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-251354396">My DH does great!  in the beginning i explained what i want to do and why i <br/>
want to &quot;teach&#39; them in the &quot;natural learning&#39; way...he exclaimed &quot;you&#39;re <br/>
preachin to the choir, i&#39;m with you on this...&quot;<br/>
I guess I anticipated that i would have to convince him since any incident <br/>
of asking a math or physics or computer question leads into a 5-10 minute <br/>
discussion of why/how/when/etc...<br/>
(although i&#39;ve caught him giving our 6yo dd a mini lecture about some nature <br/>
question she had...i did step in and reply with &#39;...because that&#39;s the way <br/>
the world works&#39;) which is all she needed --not the lectures he sometimes <br/>
catches himself giving...<br/>
I think he realizes that it&#39;s a way of life-not a &quot;teaching <br/>
style&quot;...education is all around us<br/>
All we ~need~ to do is say &quot;hey, isn&#39;t that neat&quot; and off they&#39;re minds fly! <br/>
  (that&#39;s my idea of &quot;pushing&quot; too...a stop to smell the roses kind of nudge <br/>

the idea of unschooling at about the same time but in our own<br/>
ways.  <br/>
<br/>
He is dyslexic and had a horrible time in school -- until in junior<br/>
high he was diagnosed with the problem/gift.  He now perceives<br/>
his reading difficulty as a gift since he knows his mind works <br/>
differently from other people&#39;s and he sees that as an advantage!<br/>
Maybe that has some bearing on his views about education!  <br/>
