<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898834693">I never understood what an IQ was until I read &quot;Rich Kid, Smart Kid&quot; by Richard Kiyosaki last year.  He talks about how IQ is how you perform on a test related to your age.  Three conclusions can be made from the way IQ tests are done.  1)  If you do not perform well on tests - for whatever reason - you will &quot;test&quot; at a low IQ.  2)  As you get older, if you do not continue to learn and increase your knowledge your IQ will decrease simply because you are getting older.  3)  If you happen to be smarter in an &quot;intelligence&quot; other than reading, writing and arithmetic then you will show to have a lower IQ even though you may have more common sense or life-knowledge.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, if you&#39;ve never read this book you should!  It is a great book about teaching our kids to be smart about money so they can survive without depending on the government system.  He is pro-homeschooling and has some great ideas.<br/>
