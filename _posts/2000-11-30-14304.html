<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045946285">This landmark novel which first appeared 77 years ago, is as relevant today<br/>
as it was in the 1920s.  The main character, George F. Babbitt, the<br/>
consummate company man (or robot, you take your pick), is the type of person<br/>
Thoreau would say leads &quot;a life of quiet desperation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great read.<br/>

P.S.  According to Webster&#39;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, a babbitt is<br/>
&quot;a business or professional [person] who conforms unthinkingly to prevailing<br/>
middle-class standards.&quot; To this I would add: an excessively teamplayerish<br/>
person who seems incapable of expressing even the faintest glimmer of<br/>
individuality.</div>
