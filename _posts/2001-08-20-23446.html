<br/>
<br/>
Dear Editor(s):<br/>
<br/>
I read with interest your recent article on homeschooling. While I<br/>
appreciate the breadth of research that must have gone into it, I didn&#39;t<br/>
appreciate the editorial tone of the article. Perhaps I&#39;ve got it wrong - I<br/>
read the article on line, so perhaps it really WAS an editorial, but it<br/>
seemed to be crediting a host of reporters at the end, not editors.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, such opinions that &quot;it takes a galactic commitment of time and<br/>
money and patience for a parent to spend all day, every day, relearning<br/>
algebra&quot; do your magazine no credit. Many homeschoolers do not find spending<br/>
their time with their children a hardship at all, much less a galactic one.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the disparagement of the unschooling approach is uncalled for.<br/>
At a website called Unschooling.com your reporters could have found many<br/>
intelligent and eloquent parents (and children) who unschool and would have<br/>
been pleased to tell about their actual difficulties and successes, not the<br/>
ones in your reporters&#39; overactive imaginations.<br/>
<br/>
I can see that it&#39;s a simple matter to dismiss what you do not understand -<br/>
such was the case with homeschooling until we (homeschoolers) proved that<br/>
our children would learn at home, and learn well. Now your target, and the<br/>
target of other media, seems to be unschooling. Take care what you disparage<br/>
today, especially without really looking at who unschoolers are and what<br/>
they do. You may be changing your tune in a future homeschooling article,<br/>
and wouldn&#39;t that be a bit embarrassing?<br/>
<br/>
My family&#39;s reason for homeschooling is very simple, and coincidentally very<br/>
American. It is the self-same reason we own a home business. The reason is:<br/>
freedom. My family is free to choose what we will learn, what hours we will<br/>
work or study. We are free to discover for ourselves what is the most<br/>
important work of any given day. We are free to discuss multiplying by 11&#39;s<br/>
at 11:59 p.m., without worrying that someone will be late for school or<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Such freedom looks like madness or a fairy tale to most Americans who are in<br/>
the 9-5 work-and-school grind. I&#39;m sorry for them, but I won&#39;t join the pack<br/>
to make them feel better about their choices. They have the same<br/>
opportunities. This  is, after all, still America, and freedom still means<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Should you wish to do a follow-up article on unschooling, I&#39;d be happy to<br/>
put you in touch with some sources.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
