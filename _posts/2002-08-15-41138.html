<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140056298">Ned, Thanks for the comments.  Loved them.  Made me feel better about <br/>
all of this.<br/>
<br/>
Bob, Alittle info I can share.  I feel as though not only have I been <br/>
struck re:unschooling, but about 2 yrs ago I went thru a <br/>
transformation.  Grew up in a fundamentalist family who lived at <br/>
church.  My father is a big hypocrite in the faith.  Started my <br/>
family knowing the kids needed to church as I have always done.<br/>
Quickly realized thru various episodes that church isn&#39;t always the <br/>
answer.  We quit our church about 2 yrs ago and lost quite a few <br/>
friends/contacts.  I can honestly say that all of my family are born <br/>
again followers of Christ.  But we won&#39;t look like the typical <br/>
fundamentalist family.  We no longer go to church, we don&#39;t have <br/>
regular bible devotions, and we no longer school at home.  Of course <br/>
our families think we have lots of to answer for but I have seen the <br/>
light.<br/>
My kids are happier now.  There biggest complaints about church was <br/>
the rules and the constant skimming of the bible stories.  After all <br/>
how many times can you talk about Noah and never get past the story.  <br/>
My kids want to know how bad that ark smelled and who cleaned up the <br/>
poop.  Not there was once a man.....<br/>
I&#39;m sure I will lose a few more friends when they find out I no <br/>
longer school at home.<br/>
But I know that I love Jesus and that my kids do too.  Isn&#39;t that <br/>
what is the most important message in Christianity?<br/>

I will get back to you. That is very interesting and I think I can relate. <br/>
But I fear if I respond just now, I&#39;m gonna ramble, ignore what needs to be <br/>
done here at home right now, and well, you get the picture ...<br/>
