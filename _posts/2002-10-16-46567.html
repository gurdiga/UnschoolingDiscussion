<div id="ygrps-yiv-203316282">Hi my name is Heather and I want to tell everyone about a BRAND NEW, <br/>
AWARD WINNING, educational series available to the <br/>
homeschool/unschool market called &quot;Under The Waves&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Under The Waves&quot; is a marine educational series that is currently <br/>
being produced in the Cayman Islands by Executive Producer & Olympic <br/>
Gold Medal swimmer, Mike Barrowman. Mike has combined his love of <br/>
swimming, and the ocean, to teach children about all the neat stuff <br/>
that lives &quot;Under The Waves&quot;.  Each fun, zany, half hour is packed <br/>
with great underwater footage, lots of interesting sea creatures, and <br/>
a review session that keeps children wanting to learn and see more.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Under The Waves&quot; was awarded Best Educational Series at the <br/>
Yellowstone Film Festival held last month. In addition it has also <br/>
received a prestigious Telly Award, rewarding excellence in <br/>
children&#39;s broadcasting, as well as endorsements from Kids First and <br/>
The Dove Foundation for quality children&#39;s and family programming.<br/>
