<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876091842">I am certain many of you have<br/>
seen this. However, I watched a wonderful You Tube video lecture by a young woman named Astra Taylor. It was so informative and such an encouragement when we have those doubting moments. She was unschooled. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842152740">It was a wonderful talk and examination of the unschooled life.  The question and answer period was great too.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a series of videos on you tube based on her book &#39;The Examined Life&#39;.  There is also some &#39;mock&#39; videos, so you may have to do a little &#39;hunting&#39;.<br/>
