children just so they can get used to it.<br/>
<br/>
My greatest spiritual growth and best life lesson came with the deaths of my <br/>
two brothers. No one could have protected me from that. Life happens, <br/>
suffering happens. Seeking out difficult experiences for our kids to give <br/>
some sort of mini-lesson for when and if suffering might come up later seems <br/>
to me to be a pointless endeavor. A secure, trusting and whole child is the <br/>
one who will best weather life&#39;s lessons as they come.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe anyone needs to practice being bored. I&#39;d like to help my <br/>
children learn ways to alleviate their boredom. If they learn to keep the <br/>
boring bits to a minimum, then those times will be that much easier to deal <br/>
with and move through. My greatest hope for them is that they are able to <br/>
choose a path in life that lets them do something they love.<br/>

<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355478942">I agree whole heartedly about learning from life lessons.  My daughter is now 17,  we have only homeschooled her for the last 2 and a half years.  She was in PS and met this guy a year older and she said in love w/, well they both got into some troble w/ the law.  She has learned to deal with what has come.  I feel that she is a better person because of it and whatever happens in the future I stand behind her, because it is her life and she has learned from mistakes.  PS is not the greatest, I know.<br/>
