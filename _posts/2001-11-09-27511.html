Jeremiah the Just Plain Wonderful. She is famed throughout the internet<br/>
for her capsule reviews of storybooks, posted to lucky readers at erratic<br/>
intervals. She does other cool stuff at http://www.wearsthebaby.com, and<br/>
I think she should post a page of book reviews there too. :-)<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s that?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>yes, amy&#39;s reviews of books are just super.  and she also have neat ideas<br/>
for organizing craft stuff and such. I was so impressed to see how<br/>
organized her kids&#39; arts and crafts area is.  and her kids are pretty<br/>
fantastic, too:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348557195">OK, guys, I&#39;m blushing. You must come clean with the reality about these<br/>
book reviews!<br/>
Thanks for intro-ing me. It was by far the easiest one I&#39;ve ever done.<br/>
