<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047585326">&quot;I wonder, in this thread about tantruming, either ourselves or our <br/>
parents...is alcoholism or drug use part of these lives? My dad was <br/>
the &quot;town drunk&quot; as I was growing up and I know my mom&#39;s stress had <br/>
its roots in that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was zero drug or alcohol use in my home, and my Mum had regular tantrums. <br/>
 I had it pretty good when I was very little, but once my family had grown<br/>
 rather large she didn&#39;t have much calmness or patience. She was raised by a Dad<br/>
 that had grown up with an alcoholic mother though, I wonder how many of those<br/>
 traits filtered through?<br/>
My Grandpa left his dysfunctional home at 14y.o. to make it on his own, that&#39;s<br/>
 how bad it was.<br/>
My Mum and I had a lot of fighting in the teen years, mainly because she was<br/>
 trying to control me in ways she should NOT have. How I dressed was a huge<br/>
 issue, related to the cult I was being brought up in also.<br/>
As my mother grew personally, more and more of her joyful side came out. She<br/>
 eventually was doing work she LOVED and growing and learning to the point that<br/>
 her and I became very, very close...not just on the surface.<br/>
She was a huge advocate for homeschooling and encouraged all of us to be gentle<br/>
 parents and try to get help for the anger issues and yelling she passed on to<br/>
 us. She did better than her Dad (her Mum was very calm, although controlling) I<br/>
 am definitely doing better than her and hopefully this is the final wall for<br/>
 all this family anger being passed down. I fervently hope for my kids to be the<br/>
 kind of parents I always wanted to be, from the very beginning.<br/>
So do the alcoholic behaviors pass on even when there is no drinking involved<br/>
 with the next generation? Interesting to ponder....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was a book about this.  A friend of mind had one; that was her <br/>
situation, that her mom was raised by alcoholics and wouldn&#39;t touch alcohol, but <br/>
treated her children consistently horribly instead of randomly unexpectedly <br/>
horribly.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s out of print, but there are used copies for sale online (I looked on <br/>
google for &quot;grandchilden of alcoholics&quot;) and here&#39;s info about getting it in <br/>

Family pain can pass through generations, from grandparent, to child, to <br/>
grandchild, in sometimes invisible ways.  The &quot;Looking Good Family&quot; is a concept <br/>
Ann Smith has developed to describe what happens when dysfunction goes <br/>
underground, and issues such as Alcoholism skip a generation.  Things are not always <br/>
what they seem and dysfunction can reappear in a new form despite efforts to <br/>
bury it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  with the next generation? Interesting to ponder....<br/>

&gt; Ren<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, they do. I&#39;m not an alcoholic, and neither is my husband, but we <br/>
both grew up in households with drinking. I, with my jolly dad, he <br/>
with a dad who got angry when he was drunk.<br/>
<br/>
We have a hard time with lots of interpersonal stuff, such as eye <br/>
contact, open communication, honesty...not that we lie, but that we <br/>
have a hard time telling each other when we are either pleased OR <br/>
displeased with something the other is doing. <br/>
<br/>
When my oldest son was here, and there was some fighting between him <br/>
and my hubby, my oldest daughter (like, six or so at the time) would <br/>
get into this incredible co-dependent behavior of trying to be good <br/>
enough to make everything better. A child in a home with alcohol <br/>
abuse will sometimes try to be SO good that daddy stops drinking or <br/>
mommy keeps her promise this time. When daddy DOESN&#39;T stop or mommy <br/>
breaks her promise...the good child thinks it&#39;s his or her <br/>
fault...and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
With neither I nor hubby drinking, when the fights would start, my <br/>
little girl would DO this good girl stuff...very alarming. Very much <br/>
a behavior from alcoholic homes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to wait and see how her parenting is. Will she bring some <br/>
co-dependent things into her children&#39;s lives, even though there&#39;s no <br/>
alcohol abuse in our house?<br/>
<br/>
hmmmm<br/>

when we argue (which isn&#39;t all that often) I notice that all three of my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897822424">My Mom never drank much but when she did (1-2 times a year) she was mean or <br/>
cried. <br/>
Throughout our child hood she gradually would add words that my Nana would <br/>
say like: Maybe I&#39;ll just kill myself or use words like slut, brats and what are <br/>
you on? It was like she was driving us to make mistakes. Many accusations <br/>
where educational well before we even knew what this and that was. She sheltered <br/>
us but accused often. But again you wouldn&#39;t know it even to this day. Laura<br/>

always know better than to blame the kids for their drinking or their <br/>
fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of &quot;No, it&#39;s not your fault,&quot; they might say things like, &quot;Well why <br/>
SHOULD I stop drinking, if this is all I have to look forward to?&quot;  So the kids <br/>
try even harder.<br/>
<br/>
Alcoholism is like alien possession.  The alcohol itself defends its <br/>
host-creature&#39;s freedom to consume more alcohol, and the alcohol doesn&#39;t care about <br/>
the kids.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very common for children of alcoholics or druggies to have the thought <br/>
&quot;My mom loves alcohol more than she loves me.&quot;   That hurts.  I&#39;ve thought it.  <br/>
 But more objectively, I think the alcohol loved my mom and didn&#39;t give a <br/>
rat&#39;s ass about me.<br/>
