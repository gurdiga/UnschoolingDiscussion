<br/>
That&#39;s a site full of criticism of Waldorf education.<br/>
<br/>
But compared to natural learning using the whole real world, Waldorf <br/>
philosophy is against electronic media, against plastic toys, against wooden toys if <br/>
they&#39;re too realistic or have facial expressions, children aren&#39;t to color or <br/>
paint with a full range of colors, just one at a time (and in the right order). <br/>
 They should play with cloths, but there are right ways, and there are right <br/>
and wrong kinds of cloths, and colors of cloths.   Music MUST be learned, but <br/>
only certain kinds of music, and in the right order.   <br/>
<br/>
As with all schools, the school itself becomes the most important organism, <br/>
not the children.  And there&#39;s a culture to it, with a lot of pressure.  One of <br/>
the testimonials from a former parent had these two simple paragraphs which <br/>
are telling:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your life gets intertwined with the school and it can make it very hard to <br/>
leave. I do miss the festivals and the comradery but was able to look at what <br/>
was happening to my child. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I believe parents enjoy their life at the school so much that they stop <br/>
listening to their child. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
The schools not only control the children and what they can play with and do, <br/>
they intend to control the families as well.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some pro-Waldorf parental testimony:<br/>

<br/>
&quot;I am fascinated by Steiner’s approach to education. It seems to unfold in a <br/>
magical, beautiful and natural way that I couldn’t have imagined possible. I <br/>
appreciate the way all subjects are taught in an interconnected fashion. As <br/>
delivered by the sensitive teacher, the curriculum meets the child right where <br/>
that child is. I appreciate the marvelous specialty classes: two languages, <br/>
strings, handwork, and Eurythmy. They bring depth and breadth to the child’s’s <br/>
education. My husband and I wish that we could return as grade school students!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s better than many other kinds of schooling, but it&#39;s still very <br/>
prescribed and narrow.<br/>
And the good parts described above can all happen with unschooling.  But the <br/>
narrowness of Waldorf-World is specific to their philosophies, and aren&#39;t <br/>
&quot;natural&quot; outside of their whole gnome and magic thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879267104">I was looking for some policies online that tell parents how to arrange their <br/>
homes and schedules to suit the school, and haven&#39;t found an example yet, but <br/>
did find this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AUSTIN WALDORF SCHOOL SUMMER PROGRAMS <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CAMP ROADRUNNER POLICIES AND RULES<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Austin Waldorf School strives to be a healthy, loving environment for <br/>
every child.  To assist in making this camp successful the following rules will <br/>
be applied: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CLOTHING<br/>
<br/>
Campers should attend the camp in shorts, t-shirts and sneakers to be <br/>
prepared for most camp activities. Swim gear and specific clothes may be needed on <br/>
specific days and will be presented in Camp Details (to come out a few weeks <br/>
before camp).<br/>
Preferred: Solid colors (not neon), stripes, calico, gingham, repeating <br/>
prints, and plaids. Moderation is encouraged in style and length of dresses. Shoes <br/>
should either by lace up athletic shoes or sandals with back straps (during <br/>
most activities lace up athletic shoes will be required).<br/>
Acceptable: Clothes with nature scenes. <br/>
Unacceptable: Thongs, flip-flops, T-shirts with prominent advertising (not <br/>
including small manufacturer’s labels), writing, pictures of musical groups or <br/>
cartoon like characters, sports jerseys, neon colors (even if solid), <br/>
camouflage, bare midriffs, sport-cut tank tops, low-cut necklines, electro-magnetic <br/>
wirings (e.g. lights and/or sounds) or mechanical devices on any clothing, <br/>
including shoes is unacceptable.<br/>
Note: Unacceptably attired children may not be allowed to participate in all <br/>
camp activities. <br/>
<br/>
FOOD<br/>
<br/>
Lunch is to be brought in a small cooler.   Please do not send lunch coolers <br/>
decorated with media/commercial characters.  Please send wholesome, nutritious <br/>
lunches. Junk food, candy or gum, and caffienated beverages are not to be <br/>
brought to the camp.  <br/>
<br/>
MEDIA <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The AWS Summer Program seeks to provide your child with a real experience of <br/>
nature, the arts and physical activity separate and apart from current media <br/>
images. Therefore, we ask that you limit your child’s media exposure during the <br/>
camp in order to create the place for this experience for your child. <br/>
Electronic communication and entertainment devices are not permitted at summer camp.  <br/>
Media is not to be discussed or promoted at the summer camp and camp <br/>
counselors will ask campers to refrain from discussing it while at the camp. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688935801">Waldorf and TV, long article, one paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf Education, never experienced <br/>
television, but he did know about the silent movies popular in the early part of the <br/>
twentieth century. Steiner recognized the medium&#39;s potential as a new art <br/>
form and realized that technologically based entertainment would develop and <br/>
spread. But he was aware of the negative effects and had serious reservations <br/>
about such entertainment. In a conversation with a stage designer of the time, <br/>
Steiner cautioned that film corrupts people&#39;s relation to time and space and <br/>
spoils their ability to have a real imagination. For these reasons, he was <br/>
concerned about adults who watch too many films. -=-<br/>

The Cape Cod Waldorf school has no mention of this on their website, but <br/>
there is a $55 non-refundable fee just to apply to attend the school.   And so it <br/>
the family applies but then doesn&#39;t agree with the no-TV policy, they&#39;ve just <br/>
lost $55.  The school has just gained $55 without a warning (going by the <br/>
website) that this will be a stipulation.<br/>
<br/>
And if a family has more than one child, turning 13 won&#39;t give a child access <br/>
to TV or computer either, if there are younger children to shelter per the <br/>
school&#39;s requirements.<br/>

Our daughter is currently in fourth grade at River Song Waldorf School. She <br/>
has the perfect teacher for her, a woman who combines thoughtful creative <br/>
teaching with great enjoyment in carrying through various activities. In some ways, <br/>
she knows my daughter better than I do, and she is acutely aware of where she <br/>
and the other children are in different areas of development. The genuine <br/>
love between herself and the children is wonderful. Times where I have been <br/>
over-stressed at work, and later when I had cancer-related surgery, I was assured <br/>
in the stability and care that she received from her teacher.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144118358">Thanks. I&#39;ll look through those. Like I said I hadn&#39;t<br/>
seen too much of it, but what I&#39;d seen had &quot;seemed&quot; to<br/>
be pretty nice and open and relaxed and caring. If<br/>
there is only one &quot;correct&quot; way to play with<br/>
something, or draw or paint then that is definitely<br/>
not something I&#39;d want my kids to be a part of!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283879">I have always loved the &quot;crafty&quot; areas of<br/>
Waldorf--since it&#39;s big on fiber arts, knitting with<br/>
wool, weaving, etc.  These are things that my kids and<br/>
I both enjoy, so we hung out in Waldorf chatrooms and<br/>
on Waldorf sites to get fiber arts ideas.  I can tell<br/>
you, like everything else, a little Waldorf can go a<br/>
long way ;)  SURE, it&#39;s fun to play the recorder...but<br/>
is it fun to play only the notes that you are &quot;old&quot;<br/>
enough for?  Sure, it&#39;s fun to paint, but is it fun to<br/>
only paint in the color you&#39;re &quot;ready&quot; for? <br/>
Eventually I got sick of struggling through, and we<br/>
get our fiber arts info elsewhere now ;)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many years ago my friend and her son went along to look at the local <br/>
waldorf preschool.  She is the most amazing, talented arty / crafty <br/>
person and it really appealed.  After a while, though, she noticed <br/>
something and asked about science / technology activities.  She was told <br/>
that children aren&#39;t interested at this age.  She said yes, her son was, <br/>
but was contradicted.  If he was interested, it was because she had <br/>
influenced him that way.  No, she said, it was the reverse - she kept <br/>
trying to get him interested in the arty / crafty stuff.  They just <br/>
didn&#39;t believe her, basically called her a liar.<br/>
<br/>
She kept him home. She filled his environment with arty / crafty stuff, <br/>
AND science / technology stuff - and at 19yo he is still immersed in <br/>
science and technology.  He did screen print a t-shirt once, with a <br/>
drawing of a gecko he found in the garden.<br/>
<br/>
Any philosophy which denies the individuality of children is not a <br/>
healthy one, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
But yes, I, and SOME of my children have also enjoyed many of the crafty <br/>
ideas from waldorf, and thinking about some of their philosophy helped <br/>
me organise my own philosophy about learning a bit more clearly - even, <br/>
or maybe especially, the bits I disagreed with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110271404">I&#39;ve been having a hard time not laughing a little during this discussion -- <br/>
particularly on the basic question of Waldorf being controlling.  I laugh<br/>
because Sandra has really been being so restrained.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m also laughing because of the coincidence of a parallel discussion<br/>
about ecological concerns.  Interestingly, Rudolf Steiner, the founder of<br/>
the Waldorf method in Germany during the pre-WW2 years, had some very strong<br/>
feelings about ecology and a mystical reverence for the natural world that<br/>
are expressed in his educational philosophiesand are still taught today, but<br/>
have also been linked by some to the modern skinhead movement and a new,<br/>
rising interest in Germany in what is being called &#39;eco-fascism.&#39;  That&#39;s an<br/>
interesting little connection for you, and a fascinating argument.  (For<br/>
more, and I DARE you to read the whole thing and give it some honest<br/>
thought, see an admittedly left-wing perspective at<br/>

<br/>
At any rate, back to the basic question...Waldorf...not controlling?  This<br/>
school of thought came out of the mind of a nationalistic, racist, religious<br/>
fanatic German philosopher whose works were eventually adopted by some of<br/>
the major figures in Hitler&#39;s regime, Rudolf Hess among them.  By the very<br/>
nature of the Teutonic/Aryan beast that grew during the Weimar Republic and<br/>
exploded upon the world scene during the years of the Third Reich, the word<br/>
&#39;controlling&#39; is as integral a part of the equation as is &#39;anti-Semitic.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Keyword search Anthroposophy as well as the obvious search words, and see<br/>
for yourself.  It makes for interesting reading.<br/>
<br/>
Of COURSE Waldorf is controlling.   It came from Germany in the early part<br/>
of the 20th Century.  Come ON!!  &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There may be good things that can come from the movement, but I would tread<br/>
VERY carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Laura B.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Oh, and Cally, I agree with you wholeheartedly, btw.  That&#39;s what drew<br/>
me so powerfully to unschooling -- it&#39;s demand that we see each child as a<br/>
unique individual.<br/>

Yeah, but that&#39;s like saying my New Beetle is a Hitler car (which people  <br/>
have said to me at the gas pump).  The families I know who are Waldorf are  so <br/>
far removed from skinhead neo-facists as to be on two different  planets.<br/>
 <br/>
I wonder what methods Steiner used to get to his conclusions about  child <br/>
development, especially in an era experiments were done on people thought  to be <br/>
sub-human.  Yet, I find some truth in some of the ideas, like the  9-year <br/>
change.  Still...lots of the things I know about child development  anyone can <br/>
observe if they know lots of children, so I&#39;m inclined not to  believe there&#39;s <br/>
some great revelation to be found in Steiner&#39;s work.  The  Waldorf families I <br/>
know believe in it, but they&#39;re not neo-facists.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In a way I agree with this.  It&#39;s like people telling me they don&#39;t <br/>
believe in unschooling because they think Holt was a socialist.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter to me whether he was or not, I know a good thing when <br/>
I see it.  Having some bad ideas doesn&#39;t negate the good ones.  It&#39;s <br/>
a moot point.  <br/>
<br/>
However, using a machine that was built to the standards of Hitler is <br/>
not the same as sending a child to a school where his philosopies are <br/>
taught, even subtly.  Would drive a beetle if there was tape of pro-<br/>
Nazi proganda playing the whole time you were in it for your children <br/>
to hear?<br/>
<br/>
What you have with families using Waldorf in the home is a school <br/>
more or less built to the standards of Steiner without the <br/>
propaganda.  I did it to a limited extent and I loved it.  It&#39;s when <br/>
I became involved with the schools and the propaganda that I could <br/>
see that it wasn&#39;t about wool dolls and watercolor.<br/>
<br/>
The families I know who are Waldorf are  so <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; far removed from skinhead neo-facists as to be on two different  <br/>

<br/>
Then they&#39;re probably far removed from the schools and anthropo-<br/>
whatever.  I had a single mom friend whose son had brown eyes.  She <br/>
was told the brown hid the evil that was in her son and they (a group <br/>
of Steiner followers) offered to send the boy out west to live on a <br/>
farm with people who could handle that.  Rasist, cultist and <br/>
controlling- all in contempary American.  <br/>

They don&#39;t decide when a child is ready for a color. <br/>
It is pre-declared at what age ALL children are ready for the same color.  <br/>
It&#39;s not an individual development decision.<br/>

No.  But the machine I drive today is not built on the standards of  Hitler.  <br/>
That was then.  This is now.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve never encountered racism in the Waldorf families I know.  At  least one <br/>
of them is mixed race couple.  Again, I said they were isolated  from Waldorf <br/>
communities, because of their location in the South.  Those  families you <br/>
speak of wouldn&#39;t want to be around our brown eyes, I guess, even  if we are lily <br/>
white.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not really defending the Waldorf philosophy.  There&#39;s truth in  it.  I <br/>
think the Waldorf families I know take the best parts and leave the  rest.<br/>

I totally agree with you.  Like I said, I still do some Waldorf <br/>
things.  The difference though is that once the kids are in the <br/>
school, the things you&#39;ve left out are given to them everyday whether <br/>
you like it or not because the teachers are so indoctrinated.<br/>

Holly, <br/>
This is exactly my experience too. I know Waldorf critics love to pull out all of the Hitler references and such...but like I said before there is good in Steiner&#39;s work. He lectured on so many subjects from agriculture, occult sciences, religion, education, social issues, and so on. People that I know that study Anthroposophy tend to focus on one or two areas that they gravitate towards.<br/>
 <br/>
To me, it&#39;s like I said before, take what you like and leave the rest. <br/>
 <br/>
Also, those who consider themselves Waldorf unschoolers don&#39;t tell their kids which colors to use, which order to learn letters, etc. This is just a school thing, from my experience. Those who unschool with Waldorf, the ADULTS live their lives guided by some of Steiner&#39;s principles and to a large extent just let their children be. BUT, like our earlier conversation, the kids are limited to what the parents have exposed them to (this is where I&#39;m finding myself now). <br/>
