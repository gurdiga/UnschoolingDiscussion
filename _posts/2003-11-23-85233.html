&lt;&lt;Do you have one that would work for a cat? We have a VERY spirited kitten. <br/>

As he&#39;s gotten older he sticks his claws into me much less, and after he <br/>
trained me to clean his litter box better, he never went on the carpet again.<br/>

She&#39;s not too bad. She&#39;s just young and crazy-bouncy-playful, and pretty hard <br/>
on the furniture. mostly I think we&#39;re out of practice with wild young <br/>
beings, after being around old, docile cats. She&#39;s also the sweetest, most adorable <br/>
thing. The cutest is when she runs into the bathroom whenever anyone goes in <br/>
at night. She hops in the tub and chases the shadow of her tail. <br/>

We have 4 cats here. The old man (Rusty) just turned 9 and looks on us all<br/>
with bewilderment and disgust. My daughter&#39;s cat (Chanel) is not quite 2 and<br/>
still spastic. Cody is not quite 6 months and really spastic and the new<br/>
one, (yes we got another) is only about 8-9 weeks old. That&#39;s Teddy and is<br/>
adjusting to the house as he&#39;s only been here for days. He&#39;s spastic in his<br/>
own right just not all over the house yet. He should be ready by Christmas.<br/>
&lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the spray bottle works for them all except Chanel. She loves water.<br/>
Her and Rusy have learned to stay off the kitchen counters though. Cody<br/>
hasn&#39;t got that lesson yet. I&#39;ll squirt until he does.<br/>
<br/>
As far as furniture goes, they have spray stuff you can use that has worked<br/>
for me in keeping the cats from scratching the couch. I also found that<br/>
clear strapping tape is great to put on the ends of the sofa where a cat<br/>
would want to scratch. You can&#39;t really see the tape as it&#39;s clear and the<br/>
cats don&#39;t like the feel of it and don&#39;t scratch there.<br/>
