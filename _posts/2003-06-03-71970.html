<div id="ygrps-yiv-573091124">Hi again   : )   Well, I just realized I have an awesome opportunity that I <br/>
would like to take advantage of.  Someone here recommended I find an <br/>
&quot;unschooling friendly&quot; evaluator.  Well, I know of none... however, I do know a woman <br/>
(sort of well) who just got her Florida teaching certificate.  I was thinking I <br/>
would encourage her to (over the summer... my evaluation isn&#39;t until Aug) read <br/>
a book that would make her comfortable with the way I homeschool.  Is there a <br/>
book that would be best for this?  Thanks.  ~Kris<br/>

If you are going to do the portfolio, that sounds like a great idea if she<br/>
will go for it. Try the Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith. It&#39;s very<br/>
interesting and a very easy read. You can skip all around the book and not<br/>
get lost.<br/>
