<div id="ygrps-yiv-447567899">Ok, I&#39;m proud of myself.<br/>
<br/>
We were at my in-laws last night.  They are wonderful people and very<br/>
supportive of most of what we do, even when they may not get it.  (They are<br/>
Christian, we are pagan, they are more traditional, we are, well, not!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they asked if 7 year old DS was going to school this year or if we<br/>
were keeping him home again.  (Last year was first year home--after pulling<br/>
him 3 weeks in.)  I said we were keeping him home and planning, with his<br/>
agreement, to do so all the way through.  MIL asked DS what he thought of<br/>
that and he just grinned and gave a thumbs up.  (Love this kid!)<br/>
<br/>
So then she asked, &quot;Well how do you know he&#39;s learning what the other kids<br/>
are?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I swear to you this answer was out of my mouth before I realized how bitchy<br/>
I might sound, but I just said, &quot;Who cares?&quot;  She gave me such a shocked<br/>
look!  I added, &quot;I care what HE&#39;s learning, what HE needs to know, not what<br/>
they are doing in school.&quot;  Then she sort of laughed, nervously, and said,<br/>
&quot;Well, I mean can he READ?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At this point I got a little annoyed, but said, &quot;Of course he can.  He reads<br/>
very well.&quot;  And went on to explain how I knew he read well because he reads<br/>
his gaming books and reads things off the TV and games and....THEN she<br/>
quized him, &quot;Well read something for me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I defended him and said, quite honestly, &quot;He doesn&#39;t PERFORM.&quot;  And he never<br/>
has, it&#39;s part of why &quot;school at home&quot; doesn&#39;t work for us.  He can do it or<br/>
he can&#39;t, put he won&#39;t put on a show of it either way.  I told him outright<br/>
he didn&#39;t have to do it.  About a half hour later he picked up the sample my<br/>
FIL had given him and read it out, clear as a bell.  MIL teased that he&#39;d<br/>
memorized it.  Uhm, something off the back of a phone book???  Why would he<br/>
read it at all?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they have a clue they were being rude about it.  -sigh-<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, they have a pair of new pet turtles and spent hours with<br/>
him talking about them and playing with them, catching minnows to see if<br/>
they&#39;d eat them (they did) and MIL printed out a few pages from the internet<br/>
abou them and just handed them over with no pushing.  She joked, &quot;Ok,<br/>
school&#39;s over.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I sort of sat there and went, &quot;Hey, I can enter this in my log and it&#39;s<br/>
school.  Cool.&quot;  Have to start thinking that way, &#39;cause we are in PA.<br/>
Didn&#39;t have to do ANYTHING, but we can call it school.  Gotta love it.<br/>

When Marty was five or so he could roller blade really well, and I wanted him <br/>
to show his grandparents, but he wasn&#39;t in the mood.  I pressed.  Keith <br/>
(whose parents they actually were!) said &quot;He&#39;s not a performing monkey&quot; (to me, to <br/>
remind me I was getting a tad pushier than usual &lt;g&gt;).   <br/>
<br/>
Good point!<br/>
<br/>
I remember my mom making me play piano for company.  Gross!<br/>

He was happy I defended him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911869768">I have to remind dh of this alot with his parents. We havent exactly told them that we are planning on homeschooling (never mind unschooling!) so we leave out books on the issue and have dropped some subtle hints, my MIL thinks that I am ruining my child forever by not placiong her in preschool, so whenever we are out with them and Sadie says something &quot;profound&quot; dh will say &quot;oh ya, we taught her that&quot; Ugh, it&#39;s hard ! <br/>
