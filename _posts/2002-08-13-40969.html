<div id="ygrps-yiv-837352438">Hi,<br/>
Just want to thank those of you who took the time and did reply with history <br/>
ideas.<br/>
My 9 yr. olds favorite, at the time, is Civil War.<br/>
We just aren&#39;t that keen on all the death and killing.  (But that is war, <br/>
right?)<br/>
Brenda, it is funny what they DON&#39;T teach you in school  You are right!<br/>
