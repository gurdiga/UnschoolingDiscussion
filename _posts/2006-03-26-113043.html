<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590684667">I believe I actually started reading about Colonial Williamsburg <br/>
based on a post that I read on here a while back.  Well, we finally <br/>
made a trip there last Nov and we LOVED LOVED LOVED it!  We ended up <br/>
buying their version of the season pass (we live in NC so it&#39;s only <br/>
about a 3 hour drive) and have gone back 4 times since then!  We <br/>
just went this weekend for a quick overnight trip.  There is always <br/>
something new to do and discover when we go.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don&#39;t know what it is; it&#39;s the largest outdoor <br/>
meseum and the setting is 18th century VA.  The town is set up just <br/>
as it was in the 18th century and the people who work there are all <br/>
in costume.  We usually just wonder around, chatting with the people <br/>
who work (and, in some cases, live I think?) there about their trade <br/>
and what daily life is (or was in the 18th century) like.  <br/>
<br/>
The first time we went there was Ventran&#39;s Weekend and they had a <br/>
camp set up with General Washington and his troops (can&#39;t remember <br/>
the year it was supposed to be).  We spent 2 hours there, talking to <br/>
the soldiers, the general, and the &quot;camp followers&quot; aka the women <br/>
who traveled with the camp.  This time, we spent 2 hours talking to <br/>
the people who are running a VA plantation (the wife, slaves, and <br/>
carpenters building the out buildings).  <br/>
<br/>
We are all more interested in history than any of us have ever been <br/>
and I know the reason is the way Colonial Williamsburg brings it all <br/>
to life.  I&#39;m not doing the place justice.......in case you can&#39;t <br/>
tell, we love it there!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384532497">I have a record album of children&#39;s games songs (play party songs,  <br/>
actually, but they eventually became associated with children though  <br/>
they were originally more for young adults) I got there, and a CUTE  <br/>
little leather dice cup I brought my husband, and a deck of  <br/>
reproduction playing cards he never opened; they&#39;re still in the  <br/>
wrapper because the wrapper was cool.<br/>
