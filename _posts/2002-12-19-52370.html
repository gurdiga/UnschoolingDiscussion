I am pretty sure I have a worm in my email.   I am working on the problem <br/>
right now.  You could get mail from me that I didnt really send.  UGHGHG.. I <br/>
hate this..  So sorry, I guess its virus season.  <br/>

won&#39;t be any viruses spread through this list.<br/>

(Of course people said email was perfectly safe one time too. ;-) So that&#39;s<br/>
not saying that someone couldn&#39;t eventually find a way around whatever<br/>
processing Yahoo does.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827242469">I think this worm goes through your address book ( and mine is set to <br/>
automatically store addresses that I reply to) and just randomly sends out <br/>
email.  I dont even know what the content of the attachement is..  I think <br/>
there must be some sort of virus epidemic.. I have heard LOTs of folks saying <br/>
they&#39;ve got infected lately.. I scanned my system but it found no virus but I <br/>
KNOW there is one here somewhere, I will find that bugger and anniliate him.<br/>

Eep!  Sorry!  I have a Mac and I never open attachments.  I thought I<br/>
could sail through life virus-free.  Anyone got any tips for me?<br/>

There&#39;s a mail thing that doesn&#39;t come from people&#39;s own computers, but seems <br/>
to come from their e-mail addresses.<br/>
<br/>
The message is always just three lines, shows (on my e-mail) as some html <br/>
code, and there&#39;s an attachment.  The subject of the e-mail is always <br/>
different and usually something totally plausible, and they come from various <br/>
people you actually have gotten e-mail from before.  I just delete them and I <br/>
showed the kids to delete them too.  <br/>
<br/>
For AOL people, there&#39;s another bit of crap coming around, and that is that <br/>
someone has sent you an InstaKiss, but if you go there they want your <br/>
password.  So warn kids, if you have AOL, to delete instakiss stuff.  Those <br/>
come from people you never heard of.<br/>
