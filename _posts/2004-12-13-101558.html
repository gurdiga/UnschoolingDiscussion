When my  kids were two years old, I <br/>
kept waiting for the &quot;terrible two&#39;s&quot; which  everyone assured me were <br/>
just a forerunner of the &quot;terrible teens&quot;.   The &quot;terrible two&#39;s&quot; <br/>
never materialized, and neither did the &quot;terrible  teens&quot;.  I loved <br/>
having a two-year old and I love having  teens.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Me too. In fact, these are my favorite ages/stages. Toddlers and teens.  <br/>
Can&#39;t get enough! &lt;BWG&gt; Eighteen months to three years and 14-17. What  exciting <br/>
ages! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
