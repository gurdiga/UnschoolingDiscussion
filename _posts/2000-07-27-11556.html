therapies that can be tried and also has letters from some older kids with <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;Just wondering, anyone out there homeschooling a bipolar child, or a really <br/>
&gt;ADHD<br/>
&gt;type, or ODD, OCD, Asberger&#39;s Syndrome, or any other sort of really <br/>
&gt;difficult,<br/>
&gt;spirited child that is way beyond your average/normal/ <br/>
&gt;wonderful/incredible/<br/>
&gt;unique/regular kid? Particularly an older child - like a teen? There are <br/>
&gt;books for<br/>
&gt;the younger ones, but I seem to be left high and dry with this age group. <br/>
&gt;Luckily<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s mellowed somewhat, but some of the mellowing is depression. He&#39;s <br/>
&gt;particularily<br/>
&gt;challenged with oppositionality, and homeschooling has been a lifesaver for <br/>
&gt;him. But<br/>
&gt;he is oppositional even to his own goals, and I / we would sure appreciate<br/>
&gt;communicating with someone who can relate. Are we all alone here?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669242450">You are not alone. My daughter has ADD, dyslexia, and processing speed<br/>
disorder. Unfortunatly, I can not give you too much advice on the teen<br/>
aspect, because she&#39;s only 7. I wish I could be of more help, but i did want<br/>
to let you know that you are not alone.<br/>

I have a 14-year-old daughtered labeled severely ADHD and PTSD, &quot;borderline&quot;<br/>
OCD, possibly PPD and a list of others.  She has periodically been dx with<br/>
depression.<br/>
<br/>
How old is your son?  How long have you homeschooled?<br/>

You are not alone.<br/>
