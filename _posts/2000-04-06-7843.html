<div id="ygrps-yiv-994504831"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; YES! Waterworld...opens up some great eco-disaster discussion areas.<br/>
&gt; There is only one slightly racy scene I can recall and it only lasts 2<br/>
&gt; minutes anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think the title to an early Costner movie of &quot;Foreign Affair&quot;.   Great<br/>
story on US/USSR spying and counterspying and how afraid everyone was of<br/>
everyone else.  First part begins with a Senator having an affair and a<br/>
death, so maybe for older kids----<br/>
