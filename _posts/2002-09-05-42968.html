&gt; Ok, I made myself make the rules. We&#39;re new at this &quot;un&quot; stuff, I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; trying to get over my fear of letting them do whatever they want! You&#39;re<br/>
&gt; right about the worst stuff being on at night ( and I hate to say I got<br/>
&gt; addicted to American Idol), I guess the point is to get them out of the<br/>
&gt; house and into the world, doing &quot;stuff&quot;, playing etc. etc.<br/>

<br/>
I think it helps if you think about the things the kids DO like to do<br/>
(including things in and out of the house) instead of thinking of ways to<br/>
take them away from what you DON&#39;T want them to do. It creates a more<br/>
positive atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you actively seek out all the things you can think of that they might<br/>
like...<br/>
<br/>
:::Segue::: (I went to three stores today looking for the new Hamtaro TV<br/>
tie-in merchandise that is supposedly out; last night, I showed the girls<br/>
how to make boxes so they could fill them with paper cut-out sunflower seeds<br/>
for pretending that they were animated hamsters &lt;g&gt;; today, they are<br/>
outside, the 4 year old with a 10-inch sunflower seed her sister made for<br/>
her out of paper so that she&#39;s &quot;in scale&quot;, as if she were hamster-sized,<br/>
playing Hamtaro games. Michael-Anne is Oxnard and Brittany is Hamtaro, for<br/>
fellow fans of the show &lt;g&gt;):::End of Segue:::<br/>
<br/>
...you will, IMHO, be doing what you can to add to their peace, happiness,<br/>
and learning, while if you are just frantically leaping out of the house to<br/>
get them away from the TV &lt;g&gt;, you&#39;re not.<br/>
