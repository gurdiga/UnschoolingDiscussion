<div id="ygrps-yiv-648454035">My husband just read me this quote from a book he is<br/>
reading. He describes it as a book kind of like the<br/>
&#39;The lies my culture told me.&#39; Daniel Quin, author of<br/>
Ishamel and others, fans might find this book<br/>
interesting. It challenges our perceptions of the<br/>
world. I thought this quote would be apprecited by<br/>
unschoolers:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve since come to understand the reason school lasts<br/>
thirteen years.  It takes that long to sufficiently<br/>
break a child&#39;s will.  It is not easy to disconnect<br/>
children&#39;s wills, to disconnect them from their own<br/>
experiences of the world in preparition for the lives<br/>
of painful employment they will have to endure.  Less<br/>
time wouldn&#39;t do it, and in fact, those who are<br/>
especially slow go to college.  For the exceedingly<br/>
obstinate child there is graduate school.&quot;<br/>
