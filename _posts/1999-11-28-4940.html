<br/>
&lt;&lt;My sons both participate in theatre class with 2 productions each year (all <br/>
of the cast members are also home educated).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting to me, since we began a homeschool community theater group <br/>
about five years ago.  We also do two productions a year and all our cast <br/>
membrs are homeschooled.  In fact, we&#39;re hard at work rehearsing/preparing <br/>
for our next show which opens (gulp) THIS week.  <br/>
<br/>
Are there other hs theater groups out there that anyone knows of (I <br/>
correspond with a great woman in Wash. D.C. who has had a group for a long <br/>
time)?  It would be fun to start a loop or at least exchange some <br/>
information....<br/>

had set up their own theater group.<br/>
