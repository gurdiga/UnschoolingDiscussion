<div id="ygrps-yiv-195413952">One of my favorite novels is set mostly in New Zealand in the 1700s <br/>
or 1800s (I can&#39;t remember which right now)and is wonderful. Green <br/>
Dolphin Street by Elizabeth Goudge. Both of my daughters loved it <br/>
when they were teenagers and they still count it as one of their <br/>
favorite books. You probably couldn&#39;t find a new copy but your <br/>
library might have it and used copies are pretty easy to come by on <br/>
eBay and half.com. There&#39;s a pretty good bit of history in it and <br/>
perhaps it&#39;s well researched! I&#39;m not sure about that but it&#39;s a <br/>
great read anyway.<br/>
