    ***So I was wondering if there might be value in re-casting the <br/>
    development of reading not as pre-reading but as a properly indeterminate and personal <br/>
    time of &quot;peri-reading&quot; ?  Only half-joking, JJ***<br/>
    I actually kinda like this idea!  I think I may start using it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330225120">Well, peri-menopause feels to me like it will never end  :-(   so maybe <br/>
peri-reading never will!  But what I&#39;d really like is for the learning <br/>
to never end, but the *6#$%^&^ hot flushes etc. to take a hike!<br/>
