<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055367337">I have been reading a great book by the Dalai Lama called &quot;The Art of <br/>
Happiness, A Handbook for Living&quot;. So much of it reminds me of what we <br/>
discuss here. The central idea is that the very purpose of our lives is to <br/>
seek happiness. Not happiness in a hedonistic sense, but in an ultimate <br/>
contentment, life worth living sense. Even though he&#39;s obviously a devout <br/>
Buddhist, he removes religion from all discussions and just talks about <br/>
humankind.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as I was reading along, I found myself agreeing with everything he <br/>
was saying. That is until I got to this paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...And knowledge does not come by naturally. We have to train; we have to <br/>
go through a kind of systematic training program and so forth. And we <br/>
consider this conventional education and training to be quite hard; <br/>
otherwise why would students look forward to vacations so much. Still we <br/>
know that this kind of education is quite vital for ensuring a happy and <br/>
successful life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was using this as a demonstration of why we need to train ourselves <br/>
towards using positive emotions in our lives. I don&#39;t disagree with that, <br/>
but as an unschooler I have obvious problems with the idea that learning <br/>
must be structured, systematic and difficult. And that knowledge can not <br/>
come naturally.<br/>
<br/>
So, I was thinking, maybe I should write a letter and share with him some of <br/>
the ideas currently floating around the west about children and education <br/>
and all. I mean, think of how cool it would be to start a letter to His <br/>
Holiness the Dalai Lama with &quot;Allow me to enlighten you...&quot; :o)<br/>
<br/>
And how would you address such a letter? Why &quot;Hello Dalai&quot;, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Which further got me thinking that if the refugee Tibetans are ever allowed <br/>
back into Tibet, the only appropriate song to sing would be the first verse <br/>
of &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hello Dalai, well hello Dalai, it&#39;s so nice to have you back where you <br/>
belong...&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; as an unschooler I have obvious problems with the idea that learning <br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s the main argument between Buddhists who believe that the <br/>
method is important to enlightenment, who meditate just so, sitting just so, <br/>
go through the same readings and exercises as everyone else, etc.<br/>
<br/>
They seem to despise other schools of Buddhist practice, and to condemn <br/>
people who just dabble.<br/>
<br/>
I read TriCycle, which is kind of a trade journal for teachers of Buddhism <br/>
(or so it seems sometimes) and there&#39;s a lot of hostility and defensiveness <br/>
of &quot;method.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-And we <br/>

<br/>
Is that a reason to make life hard?  So two weeks vacation will seem great?<br/>
<br/>
(Or four weeks for Germans.  Maybe their vacations are twice as long because <br/>
their lives are twice as hard! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. I would think that from the Dalai Lama&#39;s perspective, structure is all <br/>
he has ever known. I believe he was brought up in the monastery since he was <br/>
4. I do get the feeling, though, that he&#39;s not terribly hostile about it <br/>
all. Peace just radiates from the man.<br/>

my need to enlighten His Holiness on learning (from my POV).<br/>

Last week he was in a hospital in India.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s fine and out.<br/>
<br/>
No doubt he has e-mail. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He is fine and he&#39;s out.  I believe he&#39;s resting in Dharmsala.<br/>
<br/>
He was identified as the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama when he<br/>
was a little over two.  At that time he could talk in the Lhasa dialect<br/>
of Tibetan (which his mother had a hard time understanding).  He was<br/>
a serious child who didn&#39;t like quarrelsome people - he&#39;d pick up a<br/>
stick and try to hit them.  He also didn&#39;t like smoking.  If anyone<br/>
is interested in His Holiness&#39;s life from a mother&#39;s viewpoint, his<br/>
mother&#39;s biography is quite good - _Dalai Lama, My Son, A Mother&#39;s<br/>
Story_ by Diki Tsering.  She gave birth to two other tulkus (reincarnated<br/>
lamas).  I found her lifestory to be quite inspiring - she started<br/>
out a Tibetan peasant woman with no expectation that she&#39;d ever leave<br/>
the region of Tibet in which she&#39;d been born; by the end of her life <br/>
she&#39;d travelled the world as an emissary for the Tibetan government in<br/>
exile.<br/>
