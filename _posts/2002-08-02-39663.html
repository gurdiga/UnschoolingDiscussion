<div id="ygrps-yiv-493644430">Ren wrote this about last year&#39;s conference.  She and I thought we&#39;d share it <br/>
here and at the other unschooling sites to give those of you who weren&#39;t <br/>
there some idea of what you missed---and to give those of you who were there <br/>
a few memories. It&#39;ll give those who *are thinking* about coming some <br/>
incentive, maybe! *G*<br/>

<br/>
Live & Learn Unschooling Conference 2002, Columbia SC<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler, it’s easy to feel like the lone misfit in a society that <br/>
that has no<br/>
concept of your lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
At work, with neighbors, in church, or anywhere daily living might take you, <br/>
there is a<br/>
wide gap between your reality and how other people live.  Even among other<br/>
homeschoolers there can often be a lack of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
There are some lucky folks (like myself) that enjoy the company of one or two <br/>
other<br/>
families that embrace this lifestyle, but it is the rare family that would <br/>
find themselves<br/>
surrounded by the freedom loving, natural learning, radical type of people we <br/>
call<br/>
unschoolers. Rare that is, until one fine day dawned in South Carolina last <br/>
October<br/>
unlike any that had dawned before.  A day that my children and I had planned<br/>
months for. A day I had dreamt of and could only try to imagine, but in which <br/>
my<br/>
imagination (for once) fell short of reality.  A day that for the first time <br/>
ever, I was<br/>
no longer a minority, no longer the odd one in a society that I felt <br/>
distanced from,<br/>
but a part of a group.<br/>
<br/>
It isn’t easy to describe the feeling of finding one’s own people.  We had <br/>
come<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
There was a sense of expectancy as we made that last leg of the journey into<br/>
Columbia.  We pulled up to the hotel, weary and excited...we were finally <br/>
there,<br/>
unschoolers paradise!  It warmed my heart to think of my comrades flying and <br/>
driving<br/>
their way towards the same location.<br/>
<br/>
Upon registering, we heard the bad news that Sandra had fallen, breaking her <br/>
leg<br/>
and landing herself in the hospital.  I had missed her by less than an hour!! <br/>
 Everyone<br/>
was mourning the loss of her presence and scrambling to fill in her time slot <br/>
with<br/>
another speaker. Fortunately for all of us, her son Marty had come along.  <br/>
The conference wouldn’t <br/>
be totally Doddless after all.<br/>
<br/>
Every time I turned a corner there was another familiar name....Anne Ohman, <br/>
Joyce<br/>
Fetteroll, Zenmomma (Mary Gold), Tuck, Marji, Karin, Elissa, Kathryn and <br/>
Kelly Lovejoy of <br/>
course....these were my heroes, my sanity and my sage matriarchs.  I had <br/>
read,<br/>
re-read, questioned and been utterly charmed by their words.  And here they <br/>
were, in<br/>
the flesh, looking so, well...so NORMAL!<br/>
<br/>
The magic of meeting other unschoolers, especially those you’ve known from <br/>
the<br/>
internet, is the immediate connection.  There is a common bond, a feeling of <br/>
easy<br/>
comeraderie one doesn’t find so common in this world.<br/>
<br/>
After dinner, we all headed for the Pajama party. Elissa saw my street <br/>
clothes and<br/>
insisted that I actually wear pajamas...it was a PJ party after all, everyone <br/>
ELSE would<br/>
be in sleepwear right? HA! We were the only two adults in the entire room <br/>
that actually <br/>
wore our nighttime clothing.  Fortunately it was a room of free thinkers, <br/>
they didn’t even<br/>
give us a second glance.  Fun, laughter and talk flowed into the room as <br/>
naturally as <br/>
wine into a sparkling goblet.  Children and adults, enjoying, learning and <br/>
playing <br/>
together. And we’d barely gotten started.<br/>
<br/>
Some tired, but brave souls greeted Saturday morning barefoot by the pool as <br/>
Luz<br/>
Shosie led us through a Tai Chi class. As the cool morning air kissed our <br/>
skin and<br/>
the earth spun it’s way to light, I couldn’t help but think of the other <br/>
sane attendees<br/>
snuggled warmly in their beds.  Either they were all being considerate, and <br/>
trying to<br/>
let us have a small, intimate class or ....AH, who was I kidding?  They were <br/>
too dang<br/>
tired to come!!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday passed in a jubilant, magical haze of activity.  Chasing a small <br/>
toddler all<br/>
weekend kept me more distracted than most, but also allowed me to catch <br/>
snatches<br/>
of many different Funshops and speakers.  I see colors, happy faces and <br/>
dreamy<br/>
moments all jumbled up in my mind like blankets during the building of a <br/>
fort.<br/>
There was soul food, a feast that seemed unending and in between courses we<br/>
paused from gorging and found quiet moments in which life long friendships <br/>
were<br/>
formed.  As we dabbled and played our way towards Sunday, many forces pulled <br/>
us<br/>
together and etched people and events on our hearts that we will never <br/>
forget.<br/>
The buffet included some unique experiences that will undoubtably stay with <br/>
us for<br/>
always. <br/>
<br/>
There is a snapshot in my mind of the concentration my nine year old <br/>
possessed<br/>
during the “Unweaving” funshop with Errol Alger. Participants wove a floor <br/>
to ceiling<br/>
sculpture with colorful rope, twine and yarn.  This fantastic sculpture took <br/>
on new life<br/>
every hour or so as each child imbued it with their own version of perfection <br/>
(until<br/>
the poor sculpture had enough perfection and finally collapsed).  On Sunday <br/>
he<br/>
charmed us with “Unequilibrious Art”, unique mobiles made from common <br/>
kitchen <br/>
tools. The room was awash with ethereal, colorful tools hanging from the <br/>
ceiling!<br/>
<br/>
It was my privilege to witness joy firsthand in my Fun and Games on a Budget<br/>
funshop as children sculpted (and ate) with marshmallows, squished their <br/>
hands in <br/>
shaving cream and erected a geodesic dome of newspaper logs. The logs were <br/>
rolled<br/>
in solitary confinement in my hotel bathroom the night before out of respect <br/>
for the<br/>
wimps that feel asleep before midnight. My late night meeting with the <br/>
newspaper<br/>
contributed immensely to the foggy brained feeling during Tai Chi.(I take no<br/>
responsibility for any inane comments I may have made during that time.)<br/>
<br/>
Nancy Basket patiently led us through stories of Native American lore, shared <br/>
tribal<br/>
art and showed us how to use Kudzu in the most amazing ways.  There were<br/>
mini-baskets and hand-made paper created by even the youngest attendees. It’s<br/>
pretty amazing to see nature shoved into a blender!<br/>
<br/>
Kevin Dunn opened the doors of fascination with his static electricity <br/>
funshop.  The<br/>
children especially loved turning the lights off to make static sparkle in <br/>
the dark. <br/>
You could almost see the neural pathways growing right in front of your eyes <br/>
as<br/>
everyone made connections through play.<br/>
<br/>
A particularly joyful escapade was the “Play with your food” funshop in <br/>
which<br/>
children delighted us with food that looked like people and things. Funny <br/>
faces and<br/>
funky arrangements bedecked the room for hours. We had the best decor in the<br/>
hotel!<br/>
<br/>
Other workshops included soapmaking, handspinning and even Mother Goose <br/>
flying<br/>
by to share a few of her favorite tales!<br/>
<br/>
The room was jammed full when Christian Thee shared slides of his artwork. He <br/>
has<br/>
a deep passion for magic and art, which he manages to blend seemlessly in the <br/>
most<br/>
amazing ways. You could actually hear the gasps in the audience when he <br/>
shared a<br/>
piece of art that changes, as if it were truly enchanted, right before your <br/>
unbelieving<br/>
eyes. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the speakers upstairs were telling their truth from the heart. <br/>
Enlightening<br/>
and charming the audience, sharing with thirsty souls and causing us to think <br/>
deeply<br/>
about important issues.<br/>
<br/>
Like an enchantress, Anne Ohman waved her magic wand of trust and joy, <br/>
dispelling<br/>
the darkness of fear.  We left calmed, hopeful and healed as her empowering <br/>
words<br/>
penetrated our being.  The love she feels for children is evident not only in <br/>
her<br/>
speaking, but in the natural flow of trust exhibited with her own children. <br/>
She<br/>
reminded us of just how incredibly important it is to live mindfully and what <br/>
the<br/>
rewards of living mindfully with children are when she said,<br/>
“Discover the joys of learning FROM the children, the joys of seeing the <br/>
world<br/>
through their eyes and their hearts. From their earliest days, the children <br/>
are the<br/>
masters at living in the present moment! Also....are you on you very own path <br/>
in life? <br/>
Have you ever been on someone elses idea of what your path should be? <br/>
Choosing to live mindfully develops your True Self, as you discover or <br/>
re-discover<br/>
your passions, and as you continually define who you are as you change and <br/>
grow. <br/>
Wonderful things are waiting to happen.”<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful things indeed........<br/>
<br/>
Fiona Hutchison is an actress that reveled us with her stories of freedom in <br/>
New<br/>
York at age 13, when she left school.  In her charming English accent she <br/>
reminded<br/>
us just how important the attitude of her parents was in trusting her to find <br/>
her own<br/>
path. “I certainly don’t have all the answers to how unschooling works, but <br/>
I can tell<br/>
you what worked for me when I was given the freedom to pursue my dreams.”<br/>
My favorite story was about her failing grades before leaving school, and her <br/>
father<br/>
saying “F is for Fantastic, my dear!”<br/>
<br/>
We were reminded of the potential for social change when Lisa Bugg shared her<br/>
experiences of answering questions to outsiders that have no idea what<br/>
homeschooling, much less unschooling looks like from day to day.<br/>
“When asked if homeschooled children are successful, I alway ask the <br/>
questioner to<br/>
define success.  I scare a few people.  I make a few others angry.  But more <br/>
often<br/>
than not, I plant seeds.  Re-evolutionary seeds that will sustain the future <br/>
growth of<br/>
a changed society.” and “They have spent their lives thinking for <br/>
themselves.  I can’t<br/>
wait to watch as thousands of homeschooled young adults begin to move out <br/>
into<br/>
the adult world.  We should be in store for some wonderful changes.”<br/>
<br/>
And Joyce, as usual, had straight forward, balanced advice on how to get to<br/>
unschooling. Five seemingly simple steps that held an abundance of wisdom.<br/>
In step Five she comments “More often kids will slowly gather interesting <br/>
tidbits,<br/>
making connections as things occcur to them to create a foundation.  They’ll <br/>
add<br/>
pieces here and there over the years to build on that foundation.  This is <br/>
not easy to<br/>
see going on...and very easy to undervalue.” <br/>
<br/>
The people at the conference with the most years of experience in the world <br/>
of<br/>
unschooling, Ned Vare and Luz Shosie, shared stories of their now grown son <br/>
and<br/>
what it was like in the early years, before homeschooling was common place. <br/>
About<br/>
raising their unschooled-from-birth son Cassidy, Ned said “Our role was to <br/>
make as<br/>
much of the world available to him as we could, and then keep out of his way<br/>
intellectually--to let him get his own impressions, and make his own choices <br/>
and<br/>
decisions.”<br/>
<br/>
Another forceful presence was Ben Lovejoy.  I suppose because men seem to <br/>
have<br/>
a harder time accepting unschooling over all, his fierce conviction was <br/>
deeply<br/>
appreciated.  Several people joined him Saturday night to view the movie “<br/>
Dead<br/>
Poets Society” and discuss the implication of the theme as related to <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
Earlier in the evening he held a discussion for the Dads, “Reluctant<br/>
Husbands/Reluctant Fathers” which I heard had many of the participants left <br/>
with<br/>
new insight and understanding of what unschooling is really all about.<br/>
<br/>
The common thread that wove all of these speakers together was the theme of<br/>
trust. Trusting in children, trusting that they will learn and that they know <br/>
best what is<br/>
needed for their unique life journey.<br/>
<br/>
Even Sandra was present in thought as each visitor to the hospital brought <br/>
back<br/>
tales of her fiesty defiance in the face of disaster.  Up until Sunday <br/>
evening she was<br/>
convinced (and trying to convince us) that she would indeed make an <br/>
appearance<br/>
pins in her leg or not, THANK YOU! I think the morphine may have had some<br/>
influence, but then, knowing Sandra, perhaps not.<br/>
<br/>
I’ll never forget the looks of awe during the talent show Saturday night as <br/>
Kevin<br/>
Dunn told the Dr. Suess tale “The Pale Green Pants” with the help of young <br/>
Will<br/>
Tucker on Kevin’s eerie music machine.  We were held captive in the darkened <br/>
room<br/>
as his voice rose and fell with the passion of a true storyteller.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet melodies and angelic voices enchanted us. Magicians astounded (the<br/>
youngest was only 6 years old) and dancers entertained.  There was so much <br/>
energy<br/>
in the room it positively crackled with electricity.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday brought more of the same. A panel discussion had questions flowing and <br/>
an<br/>
interesting variety of unschoolers represented...the youngest (Marty Dodd) <br/>
was 13<br/>
years old, the oldest (Ned Vare) I’m not going to guess at his age since he <br/>
seems<br/>
so young at heart in spite of the grey hairs.<br/>
<br/>
The energy that flowed between panel members and audience affected all. <br/>
Sandra<br/>
says of Marty’s experience: “Since I wasn’t there to be on a panel, Marty <br/>
sat <br/>
(I heard) and said people shouldn’t listen to those voices in their heads.  <br/>
He’s a fairly shy guy.  He missed hearing mespeak, and I missed his speaking, <br/>
<br/>
though it wouldn’t have happened if I’d been there. At the end of the <br/>
weekend Marty <br/>
was bigger and different.  Something we couldn’tand wouldn’t have planned <br/>
lifted <br/>
him to another level of self-hood.  He’s been ready to return since we left.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
During the weekend of bonding, of learning, of growing, there was a feeling <br/>
of<br/>
safety.  We had found our tribe and we knew it.  The children knew it too and <br/>
they<br/>
reveled in the freedom. In Jake Ohmans’ words “At the unschooling conference <br/>
I felt<br/>
free. For the first time I was surrounded by people like myself, other kids <br/>
who understood <br/>
what it means to learn from life. The friends I made at the conference were <br/>
unlike other<br/>
children that you meet every day because they seemed more intelligent, like<br/>
their minds had been free to think all their lives. “  <br/>
<br/>
I wish I could put into words just what it is like to be utterly surrounded <br/>
by these<br/>
amazing, unschooled children, the openness with which they approach adults <br/>
and the<br/>
respect the adults had for everyone, regardless of age.  But anything written <br/>
can not<br/>
recreate the feeling of being with one’s own people.  The magic and aura of <br/>
that<br/>
spectacular weekend will be with us forever.<br/>
<br/>
The end of the conference brought a sense of sadness at the parting.  We were<br/>
going back to our homes, our lives, but we were going back with a sense of<br/>
renewed purpose and joy (not to mention a deep gratitude for Kelly, Melinda <br/>
and<br/>
everyone that made the conference possible!!)<br/>
<br/>
There is a special shelf in one corner of my house.  It holds some pressed <br/>
leaves, a<br/>
piece of tumbleweed, a cotton plant, a bundle of sage, a sprig of creasote, a <br/>
kudzu<br/>
basket and some handmade paper. It is pieces of these people that have found <br/>
their<br/>
way into my heart and I am reminded of one magical weekend and these very <br/>
special<br/>
souls each time I look at these items.<br/>
<br/>
It represents their homes, something unique to the region where they live.  <br/>
They<br/>
gifted me with these pieces of their lives, something tangible to remind me <br/>
that I am<br/>
surrounded by likeminded souls, scattered though we may be.  They gifted me <br/>
with<br/>
so much more than those fragile pieces of nature, the true gifts are perhaps <br/>
harder<br/>
to see until closer inspection.  Because if you looked hard enough, you could <br/>
see<br/>
that the true gifts were their time, their wisdom and encouragement.  Their <br/>
gifts show <br/>
through each day, not so much on that special shelf, but in our lives as we <br/>
live more <br/>
peacefully, more aware and more enriched.  I sniff my bundle of creasote <br/>
today as <br/>
I write and I know that anotheropportunity lies just around the corner, an <br/>
opportunity <br/>
that should not be missed. <br/>
<br/>
Smiling, I think of my tribe, even those I’ve not yet met and how wonderful <br/>
it will be<br/>
to see them all.<br/>
