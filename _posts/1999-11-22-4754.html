<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392104005">Hi Susan - Before I answer,  I should say that I had a teenage <br/>
daughter who was a major handful - free spirit - always hated <br/>
restrictions - loved excitement.  That combination made for some <br/>
exciting times,  but she&#39;s 19 now,  lives on her own and her <br/>
judgement seems to have improved.  She&#39;s the reason we started <br/>
hschooling when she was 15.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How late to you allow your dd/ds to be out at night?   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have a city-wide curfew of midnight 7 days a week,  so the police <br/>
can pick our kids up if they&#39;re out after that.  We used that as <br/>
well as an earlier one on weeknights (11 or so).  That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
she always followed it.  With my 13 year old,  I plan on <br/>
individualizing for the situation and negotiating,  but we&#39;ll <br/>
probably still have to stick to the midnight because of the city <br/>
ordinance.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you wait up for your dd/ds to get home when s/he is out for the evening?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was usually up,  but if not,  we had an agreement that she would <br/>
wake us up when she came in.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you ask your dd/ds to call you during their evening out?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes - we asked her to check in frequently, especially since kids <br/>
seem to move around alot,  and sometimes when they leave home,  they <br/>
have no idea where they&#39;ll actually end up.   I&#39;ve got to say - <br/>
Caller ID is a real plus here.  You know where they&#39;re calling from <br/>
and who&#39;s calling them.  Granted,   they can block it,  but that <br/>
would immediately raise my suspicions.  A cell phone wouldn&#39;t be bad <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How far away are you comfortable allowing your dd/ds to drive?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We live in a college town and everywhere she needed to be was within the city <br/>
limits.  We tried to keep her from leaving town until after she was <br/>
about 18 :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If your dd/ds is going to a party at the house of someone you don&#39;t know, do <br/>
&gt; you call the parents to make sure an adult will be there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done this with limited success.  It takes cooperation from other <br/>
parents who sometimes hold different values from ours.  I still think <br/>
it&#39;s worth trying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling complicates the decision-making on some of these issues (a week <br/>
&gt; night isn&#39;t a &quot;school night&quot;, for example) and I&#39;m curious about other <br/>
&gt; unschooling families.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter&#39;s friends were all in ps,  so we ended up sticking with a <br/>
more normal week.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  I think one of the most important things is to let your <br/>
daughter help you set the limits.   Some kids,  like my daughter are going <br/>
to push whatever limits you set.  With those kids,  you kind of hold <br/>
your breath and keep your fingers crossed.   My 13 year old has a <br/>
completely different personality and I think,  will need less in the <br/>
way of restrictions.  We&#39;ll see,  I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118379197">My16 (almost 17) year-old daughter is feeling somewhat constricted by me and <br/>
I&#39;m wondering how other parents of older teenagers handle this age of <br/>
beginning the transition into adulthood: <br/>
<br/>
How late to you allow your dd/ds to be out at night?   <br/>
<br/>
Do you wait up for your dd/ds to get home when s/he is out for the evening?<br/>
<br/>
Do you ask your dd/ds to call you during their evening out?<br/>
<br/>
How far away are you comfortable allowing your dd/ds to drive?<br/>
<br/>
If your dd/ds is going to a party at the house of someone you don&#39;t know, do <br/>
you call the parents to make sure an adult will be there?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling complicates the decision-making on some of these issues (a week <br/>
night isn&#39;t a &quot;school night&quot;, for example) and I&#39;m curious about other <br/>
unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
