<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655632184">&lt;&lt;What made you change your mind? I&#39;m interested. Usually people <br/>
go the other way. They discover science and realise that <br/>
regardless of whether god did the creating or not, the earth is well <br/>
older than 12000 years.<br/>
The aborigenes reached Australia 30,000 years ago. Hard to do if it <br/>
weren&#39;t there yet....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have much more to learn on this issue but I have heard, from several<br/>
sources, that carbon dating is questionable.  One reason being that it is<br/>
based on preset dating based on fossil levels.  It&#39;s a form of circular<br/>
thinking, &quot;This fossil is 10,000 years old because it was found in a<br/>
layer which is 10,000 because it has a fossil which is 10,000 years old.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If carbon dating is based on a pre set idea of how old things SHOULD be<br/>
it may not be accurate.  It has been a while since I read anything about<br/>
this and if anyone knows more on the issue I would be interested in<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, if I thought carbon dating was reliable I would be open to the<br/>
idea that creation took place over time.  However, that would still be a<br/>
long way from dismissing creation altogether.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>C14 is not entirely precise.  It&#39;s based on carbon 14 levels in plants<br/>
and animals, in all living things and it accumulates at the same rate as<br/>
other carbons but upon death of the living organism C14 stops<br/>
accumulating and starts to decay.  The rate of decay is known but the<br/>
problem is in the rate of absorption while the critter or plant was<br/>
alive.  C14 dating assumes atmospheric radiation levels have remained<br/>
relatively the same throughout history.  Not exactly the same, but<br/>
relatively the same.  Scientist have taken steps to adjust for<br/>
atmospheric difference and there are standards for C14 dating.    <br/>
<br/>
We should remember this is only useful for about 60,000. years.  Most C14<br/>
labs agree that they can be accurate at 70,000 years to within 1,000,<br/>
years.  I think I can live with that.  A thing could be 70,000 years old<br/>
plus or minus 1,000 years.  Good enough for me. Later than that the rate<br/>
of decay is to narrow to be measured, and other means of dating must be<br/>
used. ( hotdate.com?&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
There is something to be said about dating according to the material a<br/>
thing was found in.  If were talking about rock that is a certain age and<br/>
a fossil in that rock, we certainly know the animal didn&#39;t crawl into the<br/>
hardened rock to die.  We certainly know the two existed at the same<br/>
time.  If rock can be dated (that&#39;s radio metric dating, which is<br/>
probably not a respectable measurement either according to creationists) <br/>
than it&#39;s reasonable to assume a fossil within that rock wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
younger.  Radio carbon dating is not used for rocks.  <br/>
<br/>
And also let&#39;s remember many useful instruments of measure are not<br/>
entirely accurate yet we use and rely on them every day.  A thermometer<br/>
measures the temperature at a given location but can&#39;t measure the<br/>
temperature three blocks away nor adjust for wind chill.  Our clocks and<br/>
calendars are imperfect and need adjustment.  The Earth&#39;s rotation is<br/>
slowing, the moon continues to move away from us, there are many, many<br/>
methods of measure we use that have to be adjusted and perfected yet we<br/>
accept them as useful for us right now.  <br/>
