<div id="ygrps-yiv-517546531">Recently I have been spending a lot of time with my daughter in<br/>
law.  She was commenting (with some exasperation) on our son&#39;s<br/>
insistence on having the latest greatest gaming stuff - PS2,<br/>
computer etc....lots of &quot;stuff&quot; that has to be cleaned around,<br/>
runs up bills and so on.  I explained it to her.  When he was a<br/>
little kid, he was a boy.  In school they would call that slow to<br/>
read and not terribly good at small motor tasks.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t take me very long at all to notice that he could trade<br/>
games for the TRS-80 with his uncles - usually with accompanying<br/>
instructions about how to load the disc - and was learning all<br/>
kinds of long sequences of actions from the Atari.  We kept it<br/>
up, making sure he could always buy any gaming stuff that crossed<br/>
his interest.  When he got over being a boy and became a young<br/>
man, he was a confident, literate guy who can hold his own in any<br/>
field that interests him.  I really do credit video games and<br/>
comic books for the bulk of his skill acquisition.</div>
