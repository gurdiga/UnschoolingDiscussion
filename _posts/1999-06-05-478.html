But, now my question is &quot;why must we test our children if they don&#39;t<br/>
want the results?&quot;  who are the tests for?  Where do I get one?  And,<br/>
when/how often am I required to test test/evaluate?  What do they do if<br/>
you just don&#39;t do it?  Just curious.<br/>

<br/>
I am not going to venture what the intentions were of some legislators<br/>
in the distant past, some of them now dead.  One could be charitable and<br/>
say they believe that you, as your child&#39;s educator, would want the<br/>
results, and since they are not the primary educators, they don&#39;t need<br/>
them.  Of course, one could be uncharitable too.  Tests/evaluations are<br/>
required annually until the child reaches 15.  Family Learning<br/>
Organization in Spokane (they have a website) sells tests.  Doubt you&#39;d<br/>
get capital punishment if you didn&#39;t do it, but then again, I haven&#39;t<br/>
been so convicted.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
