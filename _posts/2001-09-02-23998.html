<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037042886">&lt;&lt; there are only 2 people <br/>
in my personal environment who i relate to on parenting issues, and they&#39;re <br/>
anti gun.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Brenda, <br/>
<br/>
Part of it is probably regional and cultural as well.  My parents and all my <br/>
grandparents were rural Texans.  I grew up in northern New Mexico (where all <br/>
the bears are coming into people&#39;s yards and kitchens this season).  Both my <br/>
parents hunted every year and we ate the meat.  They were hunter safety <br/>
instructors for kids.<br/>
<br/>
I never had a personal interest in guns, but I also *know* (not kinda think) <br/>
that playing with guns does not make a child violent.  In fact (not theory) <br/>
it is my direct and long experience that the most acting out and desperate <br/>
kid behavior seems to come from being ignored by parents or over-controlled <br/>
by them.  Kids whose parents tell them everything to do and how and when tend <br/>
to do and be all those forbidden things when thd parents aren&#39;t around.  I&#39;ve <br/>
seen it repeatedly in schools, with friends and relatives, in large-kid <br/>
gatherings and small overnighters.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if I were of several generations of Jewish parentage and <br/>
lived in an apartment in Manhattan, I am assured by my friend Jack Goldman <br/>
that I would HATE guns and totally forbid anything like a gun.   (And when <br/>
Jack moved to Arizona as soon as he could, and bought a handgun and learned <br/>
to shoot it, that could have been a good secret if he 1) hadn&#39;t left the <br/>
receipt in his backpack when he visited his mom and 2) if his mom hadn&#39;t been <br/>
such that she went through the backpack of a son who was about 24 and had <br/>
just finished a Master&#39;s Degree in physics.   So she flipped out over a <br/>
receipt for a gun.<br/>
<br/>
If I were a German-surnamed Lutheran whose ancestors had been in Philadelphia <br/>
for three hundred years and my mom lived next door, I would be unlikely to <br/>
buy my son a cowboy outfit and cap pistols.<br/>
<br/>
One size doesn&#39;t fit all in the U.S.; one U.S. size doesn&#39;t fit Canada, <br/>
England, South Africa, Japan or Australia [are there others on this list? :-) <br/>
 ]<br/>
<br/>
But the idea that forbidding something makes it disappear from the outside <br/>
world or forbidding something banishes it from our child&#39;s thoughts and <br/>
awareness is an invalid idea.  Something totally forbidden becomes a major <br/>
factor in a child&#39;s life.  Families who ban any mention of evolution and who <br/>
are derisive of any &quot;idiot&quot; who could possibly think it had validity are <br/>
raising kids much more likely to read Darwin than kids who were presented <br/>
that as something lots of people believe and creationism as something lots of <br/>
Christians believe because of the Bible.  And when the kids are exposed to it <br/>
and might not think one would have to be an idiot to see the potential and <br/>
the evidence, their faith in their parents is going to erode a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
There is a world of difference out there.  At one end might be a paranoid <br/>
family that bases their choice of housing, car and fence wire on a paranoid <br/>
fear of the government teaching all their children to recognize uniforms of <br/>
different law enforcement agencies, teaching their children what their rights <br/>
are about letting FBI agents on the land or in the house, and then teaches <br/>
them to shoot guns and makes them keep loaded guns by each door.  <br/>
(Undoubtedly they&#39;re homeschoolers.)  At the other end of the <br/>
kid-has-touched-a-gun scale is a kid like mine, who has a thrift store cap <br/>
pistol, somewhere; a pirate pistol from Disneyland; a kinda star-trek <br/>
phaser-like noise-box, a super soaker (broken), and no fascination with guns.<br/>
<br/>
Then there seem to be some families who forbid guns altogether and don&#39;t <br/>
distinguish between the two examples above.<br/>

Right.  My Quaker friend&#39;s son was forbidden to play with guns so he handled <br/>
the problem by holding his beloved stuffed bunny wabbit like  a rifle (on <br/>
it&#39;s side, ears extended in front, legs behind) and supplying the sound <br/>
effects.    Worked for him...<br/>
