<div id="ygrps-yiv-173842694"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But, my reality was that the time I spent in the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>kitchen or cleaning <br/>
house was time away from my kids unless it just<br/>
happened to be a time <br/>
when they felt like joining me in the kitchen. And,<br/>
when I had three <br/>
kids under 6 years old, I was tired a lot. When the<br/>
kids didn&#39;t need <br/>
me, I needed to sit and rest.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I think a happy unschooling home is more likely<br/>
than not to be <br/>
a messy one. And I think anybody with a bunch of<br/>
little children <br/>
should give themselves permission to use disposable<br/>
dishes, <br/>
convenience foods, and household help. And they should<br/>
not feel <br/>
guilty about needing these things.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for this Pam. I always particularly<br/>
love posts from you folks with teenagers because you<br/>
have a perspective I can&#39;t have yet.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest of three kids is six, and we have had a<br/>
housecleaning for four years now. I often feel<br/>
uncomfortable about it; kinda like, &quot;I&#39;m not bringing<br/>
any money into this household; the least I can do is<br/>
cut expenses by doing the housework myself.&quot; I feel<br/>
the same way about going through the KFC drive-thru,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently been re-reading a book that I really<br/>
like, yet at the same time it always makes me doubt<br/>
myself. It&#39;s called the &quot;Complete Tightwad Gazette.&quot;<br/>
The author has six children, washes all the dishes by<br/>
hand, hang-dries all the laundry, and cooks all their<br/>
meals from scratch. (And she did that when the kids<br/>
were young as well.) It just blows my mind. <br/>
<br/>
I also take a short nap every single day. It&#39;s good to<br/>
hear other people with small children were/are tired<br/>
as well.<br/>

   <br/>
  I bought this at a yard sale to take some ideas from it.  My dd saw it and started leafing through it.  She turned to me and said, &quot;Mum, this women is nuts!&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
  I have to agree with her.  Some of the ideas are really good, but sometimes she goes too far!  As usual, I will take what is useful and leave the rest.  <br/>
  I believe she was/is not a homeschooler.  She talks about school supplies, kids lunches and after school activities.  I wonder what she does with her small kids while she&#39;s doing all this.  Oh!  That&#39;s in the chapter about duct tape &lt;beg&gt;.<br/>

lots of money but did she pay the price in other ways?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a given, of course, that her kids felt saving money was more  <br/>
important than they were. It could be she had a personality that  <br/>
could draw people in and all her kids were crazy about the lifestyle  <br/>
because of her personality and theirs.<br/>
<br/>
But the same lifestyle would not have the same effect on every  <br/>
family ... because of the personalities involved.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve now been sitting here for two hours. (I took a little break to  <br/>
go to the bathroom and get some cereal that I ate at the computer.)  <br/>
I&#39;ve produced 3 posts. None of them particularly long. I suspect  <br/>
Sandra wouldn&#39;t take nearly that long to produce the number of words  <br/>
that I did. She&#39;s fast :-) It isn&#39;t like I haven&#39;t practiced! ;-)  <br/>
I&#39;ve been answering posts for nearly 11 years! My speed is what it  <br/>
is. I think and ponder. and reread and rewrite. It&#39;s how my brain  <br/>
works. I can either accept that my speed is uniquely my own and that  <br/>
my need for prolonged concentration is my own. Or I can beat myself  <br/>
up because Sandra can send out the words (at least I&#39;m guessing)  <br/>
three times faster than I can and can do it when she knows she only  <br/>
has a few minutes to read and respond. (There&#39;s more choices, but  <br/>
that would just muddy the point ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a faster route to happiness to be aware and accept our own  <br/>
unique talents than to beat ourselves up because we don&#39;t have  <br/>
someone else&#39;s talents.<br/>

I was thinking how WONDERFUL your posts were, Joyce, and how I should  <br/>
make a page to put them on so they can be referred to, and then I  <br/>
thought we can just recommend that people go to the archives and read  <br/>
just your responses. &lt;g&gt;   Quality over quantity.  I&#39;m fast, but not  <br/>
as thoughtful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think and ponder. and reread and rewrite.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And people&#39;s lives are improved by reading what you write, Joyce.   <br/>
You can state something clearly and logically that&#39;s swirling around  <br/>
inside me without taking form.  I love to read what you write.  Thank  <br/>
you for writing and posting.<br/>
