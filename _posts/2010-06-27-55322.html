<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151095809">TOO many posts from the same people today (some returned); too many  <br/>
posts not about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone at all new to the list who intends to post should review these  <br/>
two pages.  They&#39;re also in files at the group&#39;s main page, but those  <br/>
are hard to read.<br/>

Or here, if you want proof that they were at the group site already:<br/>

17 new members and 204 new messages this week.<br/>
No filler, please.  Only carefully considered substance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86065264">I&#39;ve returned two posts today that were thank you notes.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, PLEASE, Nobody, not anyone, should be posting who is  <br/>
unwilling to read the list guidelines or unable to follow them.<br/>
<br/>
One said:<br/>
-=-Thanks... I really do appreciate your thoughtful and experienced  <br/>
response - -<br/>
it helps so much to get others feedback.-=-<br/>
ANY post that has that information and nothing interesting or new or  <br/>
helpful to other posters will be returned.  We KNOW it&#39;s helpful.  We  <br/>
assume people appreciate it.   IF every poster is thoughtful and only  <br/>
unschoolers give advice, then all posts will be thoughtful responses.<br/>

I sent these links last night.  If I feel the need to send them again  <br/>
tomorrow, I might turn cranky.<br/>
