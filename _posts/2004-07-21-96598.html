<div id="ygrps-yiv-434226855">I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who wrote for your help and<br/>
also kind words.  I found a beautiful quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.<br/>
and am using my aunt&#39;s favorite Carole King song, You&#39;ve Got a Friend, for<br/>
my younger cousin&#39;s journal.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how much all the suggestions helped.  Looking them all up<br/>
and making the journals has consumed most of the last two days.  Being able<br/>
to focus the grief is such a wonderful thing.  As a sort of unschooling<br/>
note; I&#39;m prone to either ignore my grief or spend too much time feeling it,<br/>
and I would be prone to do the same thing w/my kids&#39; grief.  I&#39;ve learned a<br/>
lesson about putting grief into action and I hope that I&#39;ll remember that<br/>
the next time my kids express grief of any sort, to offer a way to express<br/>
it or create some tangible expression for themselves or somebody else.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again. <br/>
<br/>
With care, <br/>
<br/>
Kristi <br/>
