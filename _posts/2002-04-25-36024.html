<div id="ygrps-yiv-200676458"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;We really have already begun to relax a little more - we don&#39;t do formal <br/>
&gt;&gt;spelling, and history&#39;s just &quot;real books&quot; the kids  choose, and we&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;&gt;thrown out the idea of diagramming sentences and memorizing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>much of anything but math facts.  *But* it&#39;s still too stressful and<br/>
overwhelming, which is why I feel we need to seriously relax right now.  : <br/>

<br/>
So give yourself permission to relax! Take a break. Take a vacation from the <br/>
teaching and expectations of learning. It&#39;ll all be there when, and if, you <br/>
want to return to it. And while you&#39;re relaxing, keep reading here. You may <br/>
never want to go back. ;-)<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
