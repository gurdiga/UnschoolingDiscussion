<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691625183">I am hoping to get some fresh perspective on a stuck spot for me. My oldest is a big nose picker (actually picker and eater). It grosses me out a bit, but I know it&#39;s a pretty normal thing, so I&#39;ve worked on relaxing around it. He has suffered from several bouts of impetigo around his nose and mouth which the doctor explained is from his habit. For a long while I tried to get him to stop, but he seemed to become anxious and embarrassed around it, so I stopped about six months ago. 

I am finding myself unhappy with the nose picking again, mainly when I see him picking his nose and using the family computer (or iPad, or my phone...things that we all touch and I&#39;d rather not directly be touching someone else&#39;s snot). It *really* bugs the other adults in the house. I have asked him to wash his hands before using the computer, and he will if I remind him, but then his finger is up his nose again within minutes. His brother has now started as well, and I can feel tension building inside of me around it again. 

He has told me that it&#39;s just a habit, that he doesn&#39;t think about it. I have offered kleenexes when I see him picking, I even convinced him to try rinsing his nose everyday (which really helped) but he HATED it so quickly stopped. 

How can I approach this in a way that reduces everyone&#39;s stress around it?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146052130"><div dir="ltr"><div><div>I agree that he &quot;should&quot; think about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it should be done ONLY privately.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you &quot;know&quot; of his habits, then it does not solve your issue of feeling contaminated at the computer.&nbsp; Perhaps have a bottle of hand sanitizer at the computer that EVERYONE uses before using the mouse or keyboard?&nbsp; After all, you cannot know where else anyone&#39;s fingers may have been that day.&nbsp; It is services cleaning public buildings are supposed to pay close attention to disinfecting doorknobs and light switches. <br>
<br></div><div>I disagree that it is sufficient to just say Stop It. <br></div><div><br></div>Since you say that daily rinses helped I wonder if much of the need is environmental. Especially since his brother is also cleaning out his own nose. &nbsp; Full out rinses might be more invasive and uncomfortable than he is willing to do but there are milder things to try.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just returned from 10 days in frozen New England where I stayed in a residence using a wood pellet stove.&nbsp; Left me with itchy dry skin, dry cracked lips,&nbsp; and dry nasal passages clogged with dry boogers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I am not usually a fan of nasal sprays I found that using saline nasal spray (like Ocean or Ayr or various generics) several times a day cut down on how much dried blood came out when I would blow my nose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I normally live in Austin, which is Allergy Central particularly&nbsp; in the winter, I also need to deal with dryness brought on by frequent antihistamine use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides saline water sprays to moisturize, a barrier ointment rubbed inside the nostrils can be both soothing and long lasting.&nbsp; If nothing else it softens boogers so that &quot;mining&quot; them is not as necessary since they aren&#39;t &quot;stuck&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am surprised the doctor did not prescribe him ointment suitable for mucous membranes when he had bouts of impetigo.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a staph infection and highly contagious and probably harbored inside his nose.&nbsp; Special ointments are nice but over the years I have used &quot;regular&quot; Neosporin or Bacitracin.&nbsp; Or even lip ointments, or baby oil.&nbsp; <br>
<br></div>In my opinion, digging out dry boogers is akin to scratching chigger bites.&nbsp; Sometimes not very attractive but often having a &quot;reason&quot; to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><div><br></div><div>vicki<br></div><div><br></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-334683385">Thanks for the great ideas. It is hard for me to think about how to approach behaviors that I really dislike with my kids without falling right back into a mindset of coercion, lots of habits of my own to notice and unwind!

He is 6.5 years old, and does a lot of chewing and mouthing on things, and touching things around him in general (this combination is a bit unnerving in airports and other very public places!). I am thinking back to when he wore a &quot;chew bracelet&quot; all the time, and I think he may not have picked so much; I&#39;m going to get another and see if it helps. 

His little sister (19 months) has been suffering from horrible ear infections and we met with the surgeon who will put tubes in her ears after this current infection clears up, and she wants us to do saline sprays twice a day with her. I remembered how my daughter wanted to do the nasal rinses when her brother was doing it.  She actually did it repeatedly! The ENT said that the sprays are totally different and gentle. I am going to see if my son would be willing to try them; he is her sun and stars, and knowing that it might make it easier for her could be all it takes for him to try. He has said that he doesn&#39;t like using Kleenex because his boogers are &quot;too stuck&quot;, so this might be really helpful. 

Thanks again!

I&#39;d definitely watch for patterns with food and stuffiness or excess mucus.&nbsp; A couple years ago, my younger son and I started watching how he felt after eating casein (especially cheese). We&nbsp;found by eliminating&nbsp;cheese and other&nbsp;foods containing casein&nbsp;from his daily diet, his perpetually runny nose immediately ceased being an issue and his periodic phantom stomach aches disappeared.&nbsp; Now he&nbsp; chooses to only eats cheese and other casein products when&nbsp;it&#39;s&nbsp;something he really wants and if&nbsp;he&#39;s willing to &quot;not feel good&quot; the next day. Pizza is pretty much the only&nbsp;cheese-related food he chooses to eat. The rest of the time he reminds us, &quot;remember, I&#39;m allergic to cheese.&quot;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97024182"><div dir="ltr">The &quot;allergy&quot; to cheese could actually be a reaction to something else, like the bacterium that makes the cheese. &nbsp;My husband developed an allergy to penicillin and was warned to avoid blue cheeses because the blue veins are pencillium and so could cause him to have an allergic response. &nbsp;<div>
<br></div><div>I used to think that I was allergic to grass because I would get red, runny, swollen eyes when I mowed grass or was near grass being mowed. &nbsp;One year, after a 3 year drought, I noticed that I wasn&#39;t being bothered by mowed grass, a friend with multiple allergies (due to immune issues) suggested that it has more to do with my mold allergies and the fact that the drought killed off most of the mold in the grass. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>Just pointing out that correlation of events (eating cheese and runny nose) doesn&#39;t prove causation and that if the effect is serious enough, testing isn&#39;t always bad.</div><div>chris&nbsp;</div></div>
