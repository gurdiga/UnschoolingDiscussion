<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619464524">Disclaimer right off the bat: I *KNOW* I&#39;m a control freak but I&#39;m trying everyday to keep it within reasonable boundaries. Now, on to my post:<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting how homeschoolers (nobody in particular here) take their kids out of schools,thinking to themselves &#39;nobody&#39;s going to tell *me* how to raise my kids, etc&#39; and then get on lists, such as this one, and talk all day about not controlling their kids.  Brain-f*rt ;-).... they just *did* by taking them *out* of school. They have now altered their childrens&#39; path in  numerous and postive ways, I might add.  A child of 5 or 6 cannot begin to understand the vast differences he will experience if he takes path a). public school or path b). unschool.  As the parent of this child, *we* have controlled some of his destiny already.  Was this a *bad* thing to do? No, I don&#39;t think so!  Is control a bad thing? No, not if it&#39;s kept within certain limits. I believe the goal is to raise happy, healthy children. To do so, we have to give them choices as they are able to understand the various  outcomes... it&#39;s a maturity thing. <br/>

  &gt; Oh my. It&#39;s taken me an hour of reading, but I think I&#39;m up to speed <br/>

  &gt; people drove Sandra off, <br/>
<br/>
  Isn&#39;t calling people &quot;obnoxiously snarky&quot;, well sort of obnoxiously <br/>
  snarky? We&#39;re lucky there&#39;s no trap door, just name calling, and more <br/>
  blame.<br/>
<br/>
  Really I think that snarky phrase is funny. I don&#39;t know exactly what <br/>
  it means, but it sounds funny. How many of us are snarky here? Don&#39;t be <br/>
  shy. Aren&#39;t we all snarky once in a while? But <br/>
  never obnoxiously so. Well maybe right now, but otherwise never.  <br/>

  With reason <br/>
<br/>
  well ok, I admit my feelings are hurt by the whole thing. Hurt by <br/>
  Sandra&#39;s seeming belittling of my allergy posts (maybe I completely <br/>
  misunderstood her), hurt by the continued bringing up <br/>
  of others&#39; old perceived wounds and name calling (not me personally, <br/>
  but a few on the list,) and still not understanding if Sandra left <br/>
  because I was too harsh. Big ego I have, huh. It&#39;s all <br/>
  about me. That I&#39;m so powerful that I could &quot;drive Sandra off&quot; without <br/>
  meaning to at all. Such a beloved and respected veteran, the &quot;female <br/>
  John Holt&quot;. The leader, in spirit, of this list. The <br/>
  one who has meant so much to so many, was driven off by snarky me.<br/>
<br/>
  Or maybe she got tired of not being in charge, and tired of the <br/>
  &quot;general topic&quot; nature of this list. That&#39;s cool. I can&#39;t say she <br/>
  wasn&#39;t hurt, and I can&#39;t say that she didn&#39;t hurt others. It happens. <br/>
  It&#39;s over. Isn&#39;t it?<br/>

which is all any of us can really do. The long-term implicatiosn are just<br/>

kindergartens, actually. She freely chose unschooling, since we&#39;d been<br/>
hanging with homeschoolers and unschoolers since she was tiny she knew<br/>
that option pretty well. She&#39;s always free to go back, too, today, next<br/>
year, in 5 years. <br/>

I think you&#39;re underestimating young children. Children who are<br/>
underestimated frequently live up to that underestimation....<br/>

what it might be like - we talked, she knew other unschooled kids, stuff<br/>
like that - but really, she just made the decison that seemed best to her<br/>
at the time, and knew that she was always free to change her mind. <br/>

<br/>
  Not if the child requested to be taken out of school. My son recognized before I did that school was not the right place for him to be. My daughter went to Kindergarten (she wanted to) and was appalled at the injustices of the system--the senseless rules, the lack of respect...I think that when a child is used to being treated with respect and consideration, they are very aware and sensitive to what is not &quot;fair,&quot; regardless of their chronological age.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;...A child of 5 or 6 cannot begin to understand the vast differences he will experience if he takes path a). public school or path b). unschool.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  I think this has less to do with age and more to do with not being able to see the future. When I make a decision for myself, *I* can&#39;t foresee the vast differences I will experience if I take path &quot;a&quot; or path &quot;b&quot;. (I&#39;ve often thought that decisions would be easier to make if I could see the outcomes--but then life would be far less interesting too!)<br/>

as controlling, and I&#39;ve hung out with the TCS crowd for years now. I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine a person who doesn&#39;t make part in any &quot;controlled&quot;<br/>
activities, if this is the way you&#39;re defining them. Watching tv requires<br/>
following prescribed rules - otherwise, the tv won&#39;t go on and the<br/>
channels won&#39;t turn. So do writing a letter, or emailing, or playing a<br/>
CD, or doing laundry. The difference is in whether the person is freely<br/>
choosing to participate or not, and if it&#39;s okay to deviate from the<br/>
&quot;rules&quot; - although your results may not be guaranteed if you do...<br/>

toddler, so the concepts weren&#39;t new to her. We talked about it before<br/>
and during that year, so many of her friends weren&#39;t in school that it<br/>
was just sort of natural. I don&#39;t think she was real clear, at that<br/>
point, that there were people who homeschooled but didn&#39;t unschool - the<br/>
only homeschoolers we were friends with were unschoolers -  so I think<br/>
she said she wanted to homeschool &quot;Like Annie and Joe and Leesie and<br/>
Aliyah&quot;, rather than unschool...but she meant unschool...<br/>
