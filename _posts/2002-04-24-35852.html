&lt;&lt; My second thought is that you seem to be saying that any homeschooler <br/>
or parent for that matter who doesn&#39;t take to unschooling must not <br/>
respect their children properly.  So is that really what you think? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is asked in such a way it might be hard for it to be answered calmly.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t (nor can any one person among us) make everyone happy.  The world is <br/>
a big place, and luckily we&#39;re not responsible for making even any one single <br/>
person happy on this list, or in our homes, or anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
People are free to move around (especially those on the internet!) and if <br/>
they&#39;re in pain, one click of the mouse takes the stimulus away.  (Remember <br/>
Bill Cosby&#39;s &quot;Chicken Heart&quot; routine?  The solution was &quot;TURN OFF THE RADIO!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
On a clearly marked unschooling list, unschooling advice is to be expected.  <br/>
If in a specifically discussed incident (like &quot;I make my kids practice piano <br/>
an hour a day&quot;) it would not be unreasonable for someone to say &quot;If a child <br/>
is wanting to take a two week or two year break from piano, couldn&#39;t you <br/>
respect the child&#39;s wishes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That would be a definite suggestion that putting the hour of practice ahead <br/>
of the child&#39;s feelings about the practice could be disrespectful.  It&#39;s a <br/>
definite invitation for the parent to reconsider priorities.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t be expected to make all UNSCHOOLERS happy, so let&#39;s not move toward <br/>
wanting to make all unschoolers AND structured schoolers happy.  Nobody&#39;s <br/>
doing that.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be okay to interrupt church to say &quot;So are you really saying that <br/>
those who don&#39;t believe as you do could go to hell for it?&quot;   Or to interrupt <br/>
a Kirby vaccuum sales pitch to say, &quot;SO, you&#39;re saying these are stronger and <br/>
better made than Hoovers?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If someone believes something strongly, they believe it to be better than <br/>
those other options they considered and moved away from to get where they <br/>
are.  Those who have stopped smoking think that is a better thing than two <br/>
packs a day.  Those who used to drink but have stopped probably do NOT sit <br/>
around thinking, &quot;Gee.... I&#39;m sure I&#39;m no better off than when I was drinking <br/>
a case of beer a day...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those who go to AA could come out and say &quot;He called me a drunk!  He <br/>
suggested perhaps I&#39;m not as respectful to my family while I&#39;m drinking as I <br/>
could be!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
AA sponsors don&#39;t go door to door in pairs saying, &quot;Do you know about <br/>
Alcoholics Anonymous?  Would you like to know more?&quot;  People go to them.<br/>
<br/>
And people come to unschooling lists to find out about unschooling.  If we <br/>
water it down to a really comfortable, evasive, mushy vague thing, they won&#39;t <br/>
learn bout unschooling.  If we don&#39;t ask them to question their attitudes and <br/>
priorities, they might not come to question them.  <br/>
<br/>
For personal enlightenment, people have their whole lives.  <br/>
For getting from a frustrating place of homeschooling not working to a <br/>
comfortable unschooling place, some families have fifteen years stretching <br/>
out in front of them.  Some have three, and they need some quicker advice.<br/>
<br/>
If this were run as a school-style course of study, we would have a new batch <br/>
of people all at once, and the first week could be really soft and gentle, <br/>
and we could build up to the hard stuff gradually over twelve weeks or <br/>
whatever.  But people come here for a day, or a year.  We don&#39;t know how long <br/>
they&#39;ll be here.  Some people come for a while, go away and think, and come <br/>
back.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people (in any class, or at any AA, church, piano school, work party) <br/>
don&#39;t REALLY intend to learn in good faith.  They&#39;re there because someone <br/>
made them be, or they&#39;re there because their friend is, or because they want <br/>
to go, check it out, prove they don&#39;t like it, and tell someone (mom? <br/>
husband? kids?) &quot;Okay, I tried it.  It&#39;s stupid.  I&#39;m not going back.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329909147">Sandra&#39;s response struck me because of what I&#39;ve noticed in the neighborhood. One 8-year-old girl who hardly every plays outside but who has been out more recently said to my 8-year-old daughter, &quot;My mom [a high school teacher] said that homeschool kids don&#39;t really learn anything.&quot; I asked, with more trepidation than I expected to feel, &quot;So what did you say to her?&quot; Alexandra replied, &quot;I told her, &#39;That&#39;s not true.&#39;&quot; And off she ran.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my hunch. Because homeschooling, and especially unschooling, is a life choice that implicitly judges schools as not optimum places for kids and their learning, folks who send their kids to schools might feel that we who don&#39;t are thereby judging them. They respond to percieved criticisms of their choices by becoming defensive or by attacking. <br/>
<br/>
It may be true that I think our choice is best for us, but I also think it&#39;s a pretty good choice in general. I see many families who could probably be happier if they let go of the expectation that learning happens best in schools and if they rid themselves of this idea that it&#39;s not fun to be with their children most days. So, in a sense, my actions do reflect a judgement. I don&#39;t, however, tell my kids that &quot;school kids don&#39;t learn anything.&quot; We talk about freedom and choices more than academic-type stuff. I don&#39;t want them to dismiss or to be afraid of school because the day might come when they want to go. Plus, to think of schools that way is mighty disrespectful of all the people who have been schooled and who have done great and wonderful things, so we try to focus on balance. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m betting that everyone here is here because *something* about<br/>
Unschooling piqued their curiosity.  Even if inside their heads they are<br/>
thinking &quot;Damn, I can&#39;t imagine how that could work!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A desire to lift the veil and see the inner mechanisms and poke around<br/>
and try to see if they truly work seems to me a pretty good start for<br/>
learning.  Curiousity and faith aren&#39;t the same things, but curiousity<br/>
strikes me as a reasonable attitude to bring to this list.<br/>

I feel that same way.  Since I had fun in school and learned lots (in and out <br/>
both, and by reading the library for sure), I don&#39;t badmouth school to the <br/>
kids, but I do remind them of the realities of not getting to get up and <br/>

Anyway, I hadn&#39;t even thought of the possibility of leaving them without parents, nevermind all relatives...(delusions of immortality?). But you bring up a good point. <br/>
<br/>
Lisa Delpit, in &quot;Other People&#39;s Children,&quot; writes about the &quot;culture of power&quot; in schools. She is addressing the needs of children who are not raised in middle-class, Standard-American-English-speaking homes (an issue unto itself). Her basic point is that teachers need to be explicit about what the &quot;rules&quot; of this culture are and they need to tech the rules explicitly to all kids. Extending that to unschooling, if we are explicit about what schools are, what teachers typically expect, and how to get by, our kids&#39; real learning can still happen whenever and however they want it to even if they have to go to school.... I&#39;m sure some of us spend the better portion of our days at jobs that serve the purpose of providing needed income while the rest of our time is spent pursuing our real interests....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844178272">This post has made me ponder about cultural differences a bit and <br/>
wonder how muchof the misunderstanding here is rooted in cultural <br/>
differences between us.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking alot about this this year because of our exchange <br/>
student.  He&#39;s been here 8 months now.  He still asks if he can take <br/>
juice or the fruit that is out specifically so it can be had by any <br/>
who want it.  He still asks if he can take a shower.  He still says <br/>
thank you every night to whoever cooked and to me (for allowing it) if <br/>
he heated something up for himself.  IT DRIVES ME NUTS!!!  I keep <br/>
telling him it is not necessary to ask about the things he knows are <br/>
there for all, like the fruit.  And some day, I&#39;m going to break and <br/>
tell him he can&#39;t have a shower &#39;cuz I like him stinky! <br/>
<br/>
But the thing is, I know that this is because for 18 years he was <br/>
raised in a culture where this sort of thing is expected or even maybe <br/>
required.  Gender roles are different in his country and I can see the <br/>
effects (less now than when he first got here but still some effects <br/>
are there.)   And I wonder what he will take home with him?  We he <br/>
have a difficult time because we are so different and he has gotten <br/>
used to our much less formal ways?<br/>

I think thanking the cook is a really good thing.  <br/>
The others could be handled by a response like &quot;You can eat this stuff <br/>
ANYtime,&quot; and even if you have to say it for months, you&#39;re being gracious to <br/>
someone who was being gracious to you and showing honest gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have always said &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; to each other.  <br/>
The kids picked it up easily, before they were aware.  <br/>
<br/>
And still, anytime someone makes food here and we sit down together and eat, <br/>
there&#39;s going to be honest commentary if something is especially good, and a <br/>
definite &quot;thanks for making the lasagna!&quot; or &quot;Thanks for doing the salad, <br/>
Holly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Holly has friends leave she says &quot;Thanks for coming over!&quot;  and when she <br/>
leaves friends&#39; houses, she says &quot;Thanks for letting me play,&quot; or &quot;thanks for <br/>
having me over--I had a good time,&quot; or some such.  We didn&#39;t coach her or <br/>
&quot;make&quot; her say these things.  She has asked sometimes things like &quot;What <br/>

permission to take a shower. I think it&#39;s his culture&#39;s way of making sure<br/>
his plans aren&#39;t interfering with someone else&#39;s plans. If you told him no<br/>
he can&#39;t take a shower in order to get him to stop asking, it would be like<br/>
telling him to stop being considerate of others. It might be on the same<br/>
level as telling you to stop informing your family you&#39;re running down to<br/>
the store for a minute.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes Sandra, that&#39;s right.  But, I don&#39;t know that picking semantics apart <br/>
(and I&#39;m not talking about defining the word unschooling) is the same as <br/>
trying to turn the list into a comfortable, evasive, mushy, vague thing.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when I&#39;m trying to describe some feelings I&#39;m having about <br/>
letting go and the general idea is that it&#39;s good and somebody takes the <br/>
trouble to write and point out that the full moon was not that day but the <br/>
next, I think that&#39;s nitpicking.  <br/>
<br/>
And when someone either purposely or by accident writes &quot;do respect&quot; and is <br/>
corrected in front of everyone, I  think  this also has little to do with <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I can only speak for  myself.  But, frankly, it is intimidating for me to <br/>
write when I have to worry that every thing I say is going to be scrutinized <br/>
so carefully.  To me, that whole attitude is very &quot;schoolish.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree completely with you that there needs to be definitive reasons for <br/>
this list existing and  that there are standards of unschooling to uphold.  I <br/>
also don&#39;t think this list should be vague and mushy, because then it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t help anybody.<br/>
<br/>
I have found yours and other people&#39;s straightforward, frank comments very <br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
 But I also think that words are powerful things and that sometimes we need <br/>
to measure whether something we&#39;re about to say (write) is really necessary <br/>
to get our point across.  I think sometimes the temptation to be sarcastic or <br/>
to point out things that really aren&#39;t pertinent to the writer&#39;s message can <br/>
be hurtful and that as fellow human beings, we need to think about that.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the old adge is...If you can&#39;t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.  <br/>
And I do agree with that.  We&#39;re all here by choice as far as I know.  I am.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t stop me from thinking that we can disagree in a respectful <br/>
way and that we can refrain from pointing out small idiosnycracies in <br/>
people&#39;s posts that don&#39;t really have anything to do with the whole picture <br/>
of unschooling.  That&#39;s much different, I think, than turning the list into a <br/>
mushy, vague, thing that has no definitiveness.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid to hit the send button on this, because it&#39;s been really nice to <br/>
sort of sit out of this discussion.  But, I really feel it is important that <br/>
I learn not to be afraid to stand up for what I think, and that I will not <br/>
become confident as an unschooler, until I am able to defend my own actions.<br/>
<br/>
So, here goes!  I&#39;m sticking my neck out (a bit anyway!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631132664">Oh, Caro, I hate to disagree with you after you stuck your neck out and<br/>
everything!<br/>
<br/>
By saying we could disagree respectfully -- which *is* a great idea! -- that<br/>
is assuming that some are being deliberately, maliciously disrespectful.<br/>
Yes, I know, I know, it&#39;s impossible to read some people&#39;s style or what<br/>
some people say as anything other than disrespectful. But we have to *trust*<br/>
that people are honestly and sincerely trying to help. (And it&#39;s my job to<br/>
get rid of the ones who aren&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
But, and this is hard, if people are being who they are and how they are<br/>
bothers some people, well ...<br/>
<br/>
We could jump on them to shut them up by pointing out how rude we keep<br/>
reading their words. But then we&#39;re saying it&#39;s right to silence or change<br/>
someone for expressing themselves the way they find most helpful just<br/>
because that style bugs us. And what about the next person who bugs us? Do<br/>
we silence/change them too? And the next person? And the next person?<br/>
<br/>
Or we can learn to ignore those who (unintentionally) bother us and allow<br/>
them the same right of free speech that we appreciate others give to us.<br/>
<br/>
It can seem like strong voices can take away our right to speak because we<br/>

stop ourselves from speaking because we don&#39;t want to feel that<br/>

That&#39;s a problem in *us*. We can&#39;t stop people from doing something we feel<br/>
is intimidating if they aren&#39;t doing so deliberately and maliciously.<br/>
<br/>
But we *can* fix ourselves. We can decide their words aren&#39;t going to bother<br/>
us. We can decide to read their words another way. We can ignore them. We<br/>
can choose not to allow thier words to have power over us anymore. We have<br/>
that power.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a really LOOOONG time email discussion list afficionado -- let me just say <br/>
that most of us refrain from pointing out small indosyncracies. Most of us <br/>
refrain from commenting on other people&#39;s posting styles. Most of us try <br/>
really hard to understand the REAL point of what someone is writing.<br/>
<br/>
But - there will almost always be people around who are either fairly new to <br/>
email list discussions or just never caught on that nitpicking is <br/>
discouraging and destructive. So - another thing we&#39;ve learned is that it is <br/>
almost always better to just ignore such comments.<br/>
<br/>
SOMETIMES comments are called nitpicking when they are really not - sometimes <br/>
they are very very much to the point. And sometimes someone is just pointing <br/>
out something, because it is extra information, not realizing that it is <br/>
going to feel like criticizing to the person they are correcting. I think the <br/>
full moon thing was probably like that - that it was just a fyi thought - I&#39;m <br/>
sure it wasn&#39;t intended to detract from your real point, which was poignant <br/>
and came across loud and clear, by the way!!!<br/>

No spelling is not important.  At least most of the time.  I did <br/>
explain to Rachel that her jobs apps would be taken less seriously if <br/>
there were loads of misspelled words.  But in a forum like this it is <br/>
irrelevant.<br/>
My comment goes back to a thread from a day or two ago.  Someone was <br/>
saying that spelling was important and happened to misspell something <br/>
in the post.  Someone else pointed it out saying that it&#39;s only to be <br/>
expected that if you misspell a word in a post about spelling you <br/>
should be corrected.  <br/>
Today, it occurred to me, that by doing that, the second poster <br/>
probably reinforced the first poster&#39;s belief that spelling is <br/>
important, unintentionally, but in a way that probably hit home <br/>
nonetheless.<br/>
Again, I&#39;m just pondering and wondering.<br/>

difference between being understood and being misunderstood, or, worse, being <br/>

<br/>
I do not believe that children &quot;will naturally spell well in the end&quot; if the <br/>
child has not chosen to focus on spelling at some point in time.  Spelling, <br/>
in my opinion, is counter-intuitive.<br/>
<br/>
And, although I very strongly believe that spelling is important, I generally <br/>
try to look past spelling, and to read for content.  Words in a properly <br/>
spelled sentence are easier to read than are words in an improperly spelled <br/>
sentence.  Similarly, diction, accent, and intonation are also important in <br/>
spoken language.  A speaker delivering a most important speech might lose <br/>
many in the audience if the spoken words are monotonous, or slurred.  It is <br/>
my opinion that if one really desires to be heard or understood, then one <br/>
should at least attempt to present the materials in a &quot;proper&quot; manner (that <br/>
is, &quot;properly spelled&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Fur exsample, if i were to tryto make my point about spilling by misspleelin <br/>
words, then most people reading the sentence would, I think, dismiss the idea <br/>
as hogwash, or goobeldygock.  And I would have just wasted my time trying to <br/>
make a point that nobody even considered as a result of the poor <br/>
presentation.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, I have &quot;strewn&quot; spellers throughout the bookshelves in my home, <br/>
and hope that my children determine for themselves at some point in time that <br/>
spelling well is a good idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383097355">Let me clarify what I said before a bit.  I don&#39;t think spelling is <br/>
always unimportant.  I just think that in this context and in many <br/>
others it should not be considered important.  <br/>
<br/>
But I do believe spelling and grammar are important for some <br/>
documents.  That&#39;s why it is important to learn where to get help.  <br/>
How to proofread, use a spell checker and grammar checker, things like <br/>
that, are important if you are going to be a writer or in business or <br/>
a lawyer, etc. when you grow up.  I don&#39;t really care if my mechanic <br/>
uses proper grammar though, I only care if he can fix my car.<br/>

possibly learn to spell because English wasn&#39;t regular so kids obviously<br/>
needed the rules explicitly taught. She insisted there wasn&#39;t any way the<br/>
kids could possibly figure them out on their own. And she had all sorts of<br/>
studies that proved her point and a program she used. She couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand why anyone wouldn&#39;t just use it rather than leaving things to<br/>
chance that couldn&#39;t possibly happen anyway.<br/>
<br/>
We gave her plenty of examples of how it worked with our kids, pointing out<br/>
that inventive spelling was a stage they go through and they do figure out<br/>
the rules unconsciously even without being able recite them. But studies are<br/>
obviously are a more reliable indicator of reality than observed reality ;-)<br/>
<br/>
In this barrage of how important spelling is, she did make a number of<br/>
spelling errors. It was just an irony that someone pointed out to her.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, don&#39;t worry about pointing out spelling errors. They&#39;ll learn in<br/>
their own time. :-) Just help them how ever they want to be helped.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am not sure were the conversation started but I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to jump in.  Is spelling important?  I<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; as unschoolers we did not emphasize in spelling<br/>
&gt; &gt; corrections in our children&#39;s writting.  I<br/>
&gt; certainly<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t.  Now I am wondering if I am suppose to.<br/>
&gt; Most of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the literature i read on spelling including school<br/>
&gt; &gt; type literature speaks about not correcting<br/>
&gt; grammer<br/>
&gt; &gt; and spelling.  They will naturally spell well in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; end. Every time they write children will spell<br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Every time we point out the errors we block their<br/>
&gt; &gt; creativity and lower their trust in the writing<br/>
&gt; &gt; process. Am I wrong?  Is it just by preference of<br/>
&gt; &gt; choice?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was a special instance. The poster was asking<br/>
&gt; how unschooled kids could<br/>
&gt; possibly learn to spell because English wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; regular so kids obviously<br/>
&gt; needed the rules explicitly taught. She insisted<br/>
&gt; there wasn&#39;t any way the<br/>
&gt; kids could possibly figure them out on their own.<br/>
&gt; And she had all sorts of<br/>
&gt; studies that proved her point and a program she<br/>
&gt; used. She couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understand why anyone wouldn&#39;t just use it rather<br/>
&gt; than leaving things to<br/>
&gt; chance that couldn&#39;t possibly happen anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We gave her plenty of examples of how it worked with<br/>
&gt; our kids, pointing out<br/>
&gt; that inventive spelling was a stage they go through<br/>
&gt; and they do figure out<br/>
&gt; the rules unconsciously even without being able<br/>
&gt; recite them. But studies are<br/>
&gt; obviously are a more reliable indicator of reality<br/>
&gt; than observed reality ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In this barrage of how important spelling is, she<br/>
&gt; did make a number of<br/>
&gt; spelling errors. It was just an irony that someone<br/>
&gt; pointed out to her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, no, don&#39;t worry about pointing out spelling<br/>
&gt; errors. They&#39;ll learn in<br/>
&gt; their own time. :-) Just help them how ever they<br/>
&gt; want to be helped.<br/>

&lt;&lt; In this barrage of how important spelling is, she did make a number of<br/>
spelling errors. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was more than just how important spelling was--it was a continuing <br/>
assertion that there were rules to cover all the words, and we needed <br/>
seriously to get those rules into our children.  The mistakes she made were <br/>
simple words, too--and things readers can recognize from seeing them <br/>
repeatedly.  They were things my own kids with never a spelling lesson could <br/>
have spelled (not Holly, maybe, but the boys could have).  <br/>
<br/>
Because her posts were a steady stream of challenging our ignorance while <br/>
trying to promote her own narrow view of the only one way, and I read every <br/>
single word of her posts, it was my personal choice (not a list policy, not <br/>
the work of a committee) to ask her questions to draw out how much she might <br/>
know about the history of those spellings (none that she ever admitted to), <br/>
and to point out that her rules might not be working.  I think I noted three <br/>
of her errors, over two posts.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe she left the list rather than defend her claims anyway.<br/>

to grasp. That someone would actually observe misspelling and come to the<br/>
conclusion that if they want to avoid confusing people that using standard<br/>
spelling is a good idea. That kids would actually care about how well<br/>
someone is able to read what they write.<br/>
<br/>
But of course in school, the kids often don&#39;t care, neither about how well<br/>
they&#39;re communicating or what they&#39;re communicating. So it&#39;s presupposed<br/>
that lack of interest is inherent in the kids, not a product of school.<br/>

&gt; saying that spelling was important and happened to misspell something <br/>
&gt; in the post.  Someone else pointed it out saying that it&#39;s only to be <br/>
&gt; expected that if you misspell a word in a post about spelling you <br/>
&gt; should be corrected.  <br/>
&gt; Today, it occurred to me, that by doing that, the second poster <br/>
&gt; probably reinforced the first poster&#39;s belief that spelling is <br/>
&gt; important, unintentionally, but in a way that probably hit home <br/>
&gt; nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - except the discussion wasn&#39;t about whether or not spelling was <br/>
important - it was about whether or not kids must absolutely be taught some <br/>
full set of &quot;spelling rules&quot; - in a formal way - in order to become good <br/>
spellers. <br/>
<br/>
The poster was arguing that good spelling came from knowing all those <br/>
spelling rules, but she, herself, had misspellings (not typos) in her post. <br/>
So pointing that out was a way of pointing out that knowing all those <br/>
spelling rules was NOT going to guarantee good spelling.<br/>

My 14 and 17 yo&#39;s spell extremely well. They have extensive vocabularies and <br/>
seldom, if ever, misspell a word. Neither has ever focussed on spelling - it <br/>
just came naturally to them.  <br/>

My 11 yo does not spell well, yet. Maybe she will, naturally, or maybe she <br/>
won&#39;t. But I doubt that any sort of &quot;spelling lessons&quot; are going to do her <br/>
much good unless SHE decides that that is something of great interest to her.<br/>
