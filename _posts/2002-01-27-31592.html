<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074497665">Only if it was sex with his mother or himself... ewww. He went a little<br/>
overboard with all that in Number of the Beast. I had a psychologist friend<br/>
of mine who had heard (how&#39;s that for &quot;has to be true&quot;?) that RAH had<br/>
developed some sort of personality disorder/brain problem in his last few<br/>
years that led to his increasingly odd later novels. He is one of the few<br/>
writers that have distinct periods; his juvenile novels, the transition<br/>
ones, the adult, and then what I think of as the weird period. Speaking of<br/>
&quot;grok,&quot; there&#39;s a Napster-type service dh uses called &quot;grokster&quot; and he<br/>
pronounces it with a long O instead of rhyming with clock. Drives me crazy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s times like this that I realize... I must have been a nerd as a kid.<br/>
Everyone was so polite that they didn&#39;t tell me, but there&#39;s no other<br/>
explanation! :)<br/>

Floated him a bunch of money too!<br/>
