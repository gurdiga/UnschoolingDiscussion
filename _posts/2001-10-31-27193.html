<br/>
Well, I am not a fan of our government but I will proudly stand up for<br/>
George for something he did while governor of Texas.  We had a horrible<br/>
foster care system here (still do in too many ways).  Kids would come into<br/>
the system and just stay there....for years....until they simply got too old<br/>
for foster care and were sent out into the world.  George passed a couple of<br/>
laws that meant the world to these kids.  First, he championed a law that<br/>
limited the time the state could keep a kid in foster care to 1 year with a<br/>
maximum one time extension of 6 months.  At the end of that time, either a<br/>
kid must be returned home or if the state could prove the home had not<br/>
improved and the kids would continue to be unsafe there, parental rights are<br/>
terminated and the kids are placed for adoption.  The second law was that<br/>
any kid that grew up in foster care was eligible to have their college paid<br/>
for by the state.<br/>

Hi Nikki,<br/>
If you go the website,<br/>
www.csMonitor.com<br/>
 there are things for all different ages;however,<br/>
 I am not sure if there is similar article geared more for kids.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any photographers lurking, there is also a place to click BUY<br/>
MONITOR PHOTOS. Awesome photos to view.<br/>
<br/>
It is also interesting to me is why an 86 year old lady even started this<br/>
paper.(copied and pasted a little, but more info at site)<br/>
About Us/Help &gt; About the Monitor<br/>
About the Monitor<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is the paper a religious periodical?<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s a real newspaper published by a church - The First Church of<br/>
Christ, Scientist in Boston, Mass., USA. Everything in the Monitor is<br/>
international and US news and features, except for one religious article<br/>
that has appeared each day in the Home Forum section since 1908, at the<br/>
request of the paper&#39;s founder, Mary Baker Eddy.<br/>
<br/>
In an age of corporate conglomerates dominating news media, the Monitor<br/>
combination of church ownership, a public-service mission, and commitment to<br/>
covering the world (not to mention the fact that it was founded by a woman<br/>
shortly after the turn of the century, when US women didn&#39;t yet have the<br/>
vote!) gives the paper a uniquely independent voice in journalism.<br/>
<br/>
How do you compare to other newspapers covering international news?<br/>
<br/>
Unlike most US dailies, the Monitor does not rely on wire services, like AP<br/>
and Reuters, for its international coverage. We have writers based in 11<br/>
countries, including Russia, China, France, the UK, Kenya, Mexico, the<br/>
Middle East, and India, as well as throughout the US.<br/>
<br/>
Why does the Christian Science church publish a newspaper?<br/>
<br/>
One answer might be found in a story the Monitor&#39;s Washington bureau chief,<br/>
David Cook, told in a recent talk he gave:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Consider this case. It is 1907. An elderly New England woman finds herself<br/>
being targeted by Joseph Pulitzer&#39;s New York World. She is 86 years old and<br/>
holds some unconventional religious beliefs that she expounds in a book. The<br/>
book becomes a bestseller, making her wealthy and a well-known public<br/>
figure.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The New York World decides she is incapable of managing her own affairs and<br/>
persuades some of her friends and her two sons to sue for control of her<br/>
estate.<br/>
<br/>
Although Boston and New Hampshire newspapers and major wire services<br/>
interview this person and find her competent, the New York World is<br/>
unrelenting. The lady in question finally is taken to court where the case<br/>
against her is dropped.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And the next year this woman, Mary Baker Eddy, founds The Christian Science<br/>
Monitor.<br/>
<br/>
I read this as I was thinking about whay Lynda was saying about Patty Hearst<br/>
and the Hearst&#39;s owning the news.<br/>
