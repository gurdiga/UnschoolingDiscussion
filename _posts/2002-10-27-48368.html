 Thank you Pam for writing this,  I agree with you on the Jesus point,  I can <br/>
see him loving unschooling!<br/>
 I&#39;m going out on a limb now, look out,<br/>
 If I were a &#39;better&#39; Christian my signature line might read:<br/>
 Jesus was an unschooler!<br/>

<br/>
Yep, yep, yep!!!<br/>
I often think of the story of his parents discovering he wasn&#39;t with them as <br/>
they left town (after passover I believe) and finding him with the sages and <br/>
wise men of the Jewish faith...learning from them.<br/>
He didn&#39;t ask his parent permission apparently, they were upset to discover <br/>
he was missing.<br/>
And I don&#39;t read of him getting beaten or berated for choosing his own path. <br/>
He answered them in a very adult manner and we don&#39;t read that he was taught <br/>
to &quot;answer the first time they call&quot; or anything.<br/>
Interesting food for thought for the spanker out there.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924178725">Yep!<br/>
And this is exactly why I am having a hard time going to church right now!  <br/>
I hear such contradictions.  And I am way to honest for them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80185015">Jesus really did personify the essence of unschooling, IMO.  He spoke<br/>
about LIVING the word of God and having it written on your heart.  He<br/>
showed the difference between what the power mongering religious leaders<br/>
of the day were doing and what true belief was.<br/>
<br/>
I have used His example many times to illustrate how unschooling works. <br/>
Jesus didn&#39;t hand out curriculm to his disciples, He lived life with them<br/>
and guided them through the experiences.  He didn&#39;t wait for &quot;lesson<br/>
time&quot; to teach, it happened constantly, whenever and wherever, He was<br/>
always ready to discuss and explore.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I often think of the story of his parents discovering he wasn&#39;t with them <br/>
as <br/>
they left town (after passover I believe) and finding him with the sages and <br/>
wise men of the Jewish faith...learning from them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it says he was teaching them.  <br/>
<br/>
In an early-20th century children&#39;s literature series, there was a retelling <br/>
of that tale and they said Jesus was with his schoolgroup, and that of course <br/>
Jesus  had to go to school, just like you do (addressed to the reader).  They <br/>
showed the trip to Jerusalem as some sort of school field trip, if I remember <br/>
correctly.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t go find it for a few months, but if someone reminds me I&#39;ll try to <br/>
quote the whole thing here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I don&#39;t read of him getting beaten or berated for choosing his own <br/>
path. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an English ballad about Jesus getting a spanking.<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s called The Bitter Withy or The Rainbow Bridge--the title and <br/>
texts aren&#39;t always even similar, but Jesus goes and asks some kids if he can <br/>
play ball with them, and they say <br/>
O we are Lords and Ladies&#39; sons<br/>
Born in bower or in hall, in hall,<br/>
And you are but a poor maid&#39;s child<br/>
Born in an ox&#39;s stall<br/>
<br/>
Well if you are lords and ladies sons<br/>
Born in bower or in hall, in hall,<br/>
Then at the very end I shall make it appear<br/>
That I am above you all<br/>
<br/>
So our Savior built a bridge of the beams of the sun<br/>
Over it gone, he gone, gone he,<br/>
and after followed the three jolly children<br/>
and drownded were they all three.<br/>
<br/>
(It was upling scorn and downling scorn)<br/>
The mothers of them did whoop and call<br/>
Crying out,  &quot;Mary Mild, call home your child<br/>
For ours are dronwded all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mary Mild, Mary Mild called home her child<br/>
Laid our Savior across her knee<br/>
And with a whole handfull of bitter withy<br/>
She gave him slashes three<br/>
<br/>
(And the last verse is jesus speaking)<br/>
...the withy that causes me to smart, to smart<br/>
The withy it shall be the very first tree <br/>
That perisheth at the heart (or hearth, in some texts)<br/>
<br/>
So Jesus got spanked with willow and cursed the willow tree.  Those kinds of <br/>
stories are called apocryphal stories, and in the Middle Ages many of them <br/>
were believed just as surely as if they had been in the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
So that would justify spankings, since Jesus even got one.  (For murder, but <br/>
the song doesn&#39;t discuss that.  They should have let him play ball and not <br/>
insulted his mother, I guess.)<br/>

<br/>
So not telling your parents where you are going, and making them worry about <br/>
you needlessly, would not be deemed worthy of a spanking by most Christians?<br/>
I think he was probably a pretty normal baby and toddler that got into stuff <br/>
and all.<br/>
A Christian family today that believes in spanking, would have found cause to <br/>
hit I&#39;m sure.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe.  Most Christian spankers I know only spank for outright <br/>
disobedience.  Like, &quot;Don&#39;t go anywhere other than here&quot; and the <br/>
child goes there anyway.  Something like this may or may not be just <br/>
considered a misunderstanding.  However, Mary and Joseph knew who He <br/>
was.  They knew that He was not only their son, but their Savior and <br/>
Master as well.  Their son created them.  Weird situation, huh?  <br/>

just getting into stuff out of normal toddler curiousity.  Only when <br/>
the child is told, &quot;Don&#39;t get into that cabinet&quot; and the child says <br/>
no and goes into teh cabinet anyway.  <br/>
