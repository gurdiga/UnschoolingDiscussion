<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104266094">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking for something, or at least wanting to and thought I&#39;d <br/>
check here first since a lot of you seem so well read. Do any of you know <br/>
about a book that deals with anal people? I&#39;m serious here, like a book <br/>
about how to let go and deal with things that bother people who can&#39;t just <br/>
let go and live life? Like a Dr. Phil book or something that gives people <br/>
the tools to get over it. Whatever it may be?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hopeful so I&#39;m thanking in advance.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how well this book deals with anal people, but I have heard good <br/>
things about it. It is called *Who Moved My Cheese* by Spencer Johnson and <br/>
Kenneth Blanchard. It discusses ways to deal with change in your work and <br/>
life. I think it goes into ways to plan and organize your day. Not too <br/>
unschoolish. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493971921">Mary, <br/>
I don&#39;t know an exact title but I&#39;m thinking that maybe books with dealing with controlling and co-dependency might fit the bill,  maybe?<br/>
I&#39;m dealing with the same issues in my life and everything is coming back to how controlling my mother was with me, hence it created other controlling people that are very anal,  my siblings and me,  which I am trying to change.  For me its really just helped to recognize these things.<br/>
Don&#39;t know if that was much help, but maybe others know more about control issues and co-dependent behavior and what it creates in people? <br/>
Take Care,<br/>

I&#39;m currently reading the &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;, and it tells you <br/>
about why &quot;school&quot; isn&#39;t good for most people, and what the real agenda of <br/>
it is.<br/>
