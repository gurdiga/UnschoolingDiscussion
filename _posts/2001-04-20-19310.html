<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037688917">I&#39;m getting repeated mailings (five just now) from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:livinglighthouse@...">livinglighthouse@...</a><br/>

and each is just a post from me, sent back privately, with that screwfile as <br/>
an attachment.<br/>
<br/>
What should I do?  <br/>
<br/>
I deleted some of the earlier virus-topic posts, but now I&#39;m getting this <br/>
thing over and over in e-mail.  It can&#39;t be detached from forwards so I sent <br/>
it to KaeKaeB to complain (Sorry Lisa!)<br/>
<br/>
If I just don&#39;t try to download it is it okay?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767003483">Yes, as long as you don&#39;t try to open the attachment, you&#39;re fine. Just <br/>
delete the message, and if you&#39;re e-mail program has a trash folder, delete <br/>
them from there as well (just to be safe). Try to avoid sending the <br/>
attachment on to anyone else, as you don&#39;t want them to open it either.<br/>

A computer tech friend told me that it&#39;s ONLY when the file is &quot;opened&quot;. <br/>
Since it is an &quot;exe&quot; file it will begin &quot;running&quot; when you open it.  He<br/>
said the file could even be downloaded with no harm as long as it isn&#39;t<br/>
opened.<br/>
<br/>
I will post a very good outline of what to do if infected.  It will<br/>
include the file names to look for.  You could do a search to see if they<br/>
are on your computer.<br/>
<br/>
One clue is, don&#39;t shut down and restart your computer until you know you<br/>
don&#39;t have the virus.  It will automatically open itself when you<br/>
restart.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  If it&#39;s causing your computer to send it out you have the virus.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;Would the computer replicate the attachments if there were not a<br/>
problem?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  On the other hand if no one gets an email from you you could still<br/>
have the virus.<br/>
