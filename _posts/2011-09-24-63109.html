<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933604757">hi laura - we just experienced this last week when our 15 year old dog died.  our 13 year old dog died very suddenly back in january, as well.  my boys are 4 1/2 and 2 and while the first death in january was handled well by both, i felt like last week&#39;s death was tolerated better as the boys were able to spend time w/her as she died peacefully, here at home, of old age.  periodically, they would go in and pet her or bring her their toys.  i have some links i can pass along about handling pet death w/kids:<br/>

Is she still very upset about it? Why do you feel you need to &#39;work&#39; at it?<br/>
<br/>
My children started to ask about death when they were around three or four;<br/>
they&#39;ve always known that their brother died so when they got old enough to<br/>
start understanding death they&#39;ve had a lot of questions about it. I&#39;ve<br/>
answered their questions as simply and directly as I can, trying to be<br/>
matter-of-fact and calm; when they stop asking I stop talking until they<br/>
bring it up again. That&#39;s all they&#39;ve needed, so far.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729690666">I would let Caitlyn ask you the questions. I would let her lead the discussion. <br/>
I would cry my heart out over my sense of loss and I would hold her as she <br/>
needed, or not. She may not actually feel that sad about it. I would be fine <br/>
with that, as well. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When our dog died a few years ago mostly it was David and I who were bereft, <br/>
even though he&#39;d been there for all of Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s memories. They&#39;ve <br/>
seen lots of animals die as we&#39;ve attempted various rescues from our flock of <br/>
cats. They sat with me and held one of our cats as she breathed her last <br/>
laboured breath. When Pickle died they were sad, but their grief was their grief <br/>
and it wasn&#39;t mine or David&#39;s and it wasn&#39;t the sense of loss that I had <br/>
remembering him as a puppy waiting for toddler Simon to drop a bit of food. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the death of animals they have known does for shaping their <br/>
vision of death. Reading over the webpages on pet death there is a sense that <br/>
this is a learning opportunity, a learning moment to be caught by the parent and <br/>
handed on to the child.  I think each person has a pretty personal understanding <br/>
of death and life and I can&#39;t imagine how the death of a pet will make it easier <br/>
to face your own mortality or the mortality of those around you. <br/>
