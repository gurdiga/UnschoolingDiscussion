<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207041461">Our family is considering a move.  We are currently looking at NY, <br/>
PA, or VA.  I have read the laws but would love to hear from some <br/>
unschoolers in those states about how they actually function with the <br/>
laws.  I am not asking about the day to day living stuff, more how <br/>
you comply with these laws.  Are there many who just go underground?  <br/>
I realize these states are varied from one side to another, and it <br/>
probably depends on the district.  I&#39;m just looking for as much <br/>
information as I can about the actualities of the law enforcement.  <br/>
How hard is it to make unschooling fit the descriptions and <br/>
requirements to be &quot;legal&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help and information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328052325">Just a question as to why you are not considering NJ.  We have great laws <br/>
here.  All I had to do was write a letter to my school district with my <br/>
intention to homeschool.  They told me that I had to provide them with a <br/>
curriculum or use theirs.  So I picked up a copy of theirs (which is nice to <br/>
have for reference anyway and is free) and that&#39;s it.  The burden of proof <br/>
is now on the state to prove that I am not educating my children, if they <br/>
wanted to give me trouble that is.  But usually, if you let the district <br/>
know that you are homeschooling, they leave you alone.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought!<br/>

<br/>
NJ hasn&#39;t been ruled out completely!  The reason I didn&#39;t ask about it was <br/>
because the laws there don&#39;t sound difficult to follow. Thanks for the <br/>
reminder.<br/>

<div><font size="2">wow, funny you should ask that!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I live in PA.&nbsp; PA and NY have the most difficult hs laws 
of the three.&nbsp; Here is what I do as an unschooler complying with the 
law:</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">By Aug. 1st I must turn in objectives ( a tentative idea of 
what I plan to teach) for each child.&nbsp; The school cannot hold me to these 
objectives and if they change I don&#39;t have to notify anyone.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I keep these objectives very vague and broad..open 
ended.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">By Aug. 1st I have to turn in an notarized affidavit, 
attesting that I do have a high school diploma, that I have not been conviced of 
abusing children, and some other information that is common.&nbsp; I do not turn 
in my diploma or copy of it.&nbsp; Districts have come to expect this but the 
state dept of ed has said it is not necessary bec. the affidavit attests to 
that.&nbsp; I also do not turn in my record of immunizations or other medical 
records, but simply state in the affidavit that a medical file is being 
maintained.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2"><strong>How to make our law conducive to 
unschooling:</strong></font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Throughout the year I take pictures of what they do, keep 
pamphlets, and keep some of their projects, etc.&nbsp; They go in their 
&quot;portfolio&quot;.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I also keep a &quot;log&quot; (a list of reading materials &quot;used 
contemporaneously with instruction)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">And I keep a record of daily activities.&nbsp; I watch what 
they do, write a short narrative, and label it with all of the subjects that it 
covers.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">At the end of the year, I go to an evaluator with all of the 
above in hand, she looks through it, talks to the kids, and writes a letter or 
uses a checklist to say that my kids have made &quot;sustained progress&quot; in the 
overall program.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I&nbsp;take out a few samples, make copies and send them to 
the district by certified mail so I have a receipt.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">A few things:</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">1.&nbsp; You do not have to cover every subject listed in the 
law every year.&nbsp; You need only cover every subject listed in the 
&quot;level&quot;&nbsp; There are 2 levels:&nbsp; elementary and secondary.&nbsp; Each has 
its own list of required subjects.&nbsp; Elementary is grades 1-6.&nbsp; 
Secondary is 7-12.&nbsp; You have the entire time span of the level to cover all 
the listed subjects.&nbsp; That means if you only want to do English and Math 
this year, and nothing else, you can.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some districts dont&#39; think you 
can, but you can.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">2.&nbsp; The law does not say anywhere that we have to turn in 
a record of daily activiites, but most districts expect it because of the 
statement in the law that says we must teach for 180 days.&nbsp; I turn one in, 
you do what you think is right, but just know that the district will probably 
ask for it and there is no court precedent to&nbsp;support us if we dont&#39; turn 
it in.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">3.&nbsp; There is a large group of us trying to change the law 
right now.&nbsp; We are working together to make the law less restrictiive, we 
have done a state wide poll which has resulted in an overwhelming support of 
changing the law. There are 4 legislators who are involved, who also 
homeschool.&nbsp; We think we have a good chance of at least getting a less 
restricitve law, if not just a &quot;notice of intent&quot; law.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">The hardest part of homeshcooling in PA is educating the 
school districts about what the law actually says and requires.&nbsp; Many times 
districts think there is more required than there is.&nbsp; The other difficult 
part about living here is that there are so many homeshcoolers here who 
misktakenly think that our law prevents &quot;educational neglect&quot;.&nbsp; We are a 
community divided right now.&nbsp; Howard Richman is responsible for the notion 
that we need to police parents with laws requiring all this documentation.&nbsp; 
If you move here, I do not recommend using his materials to get started because 
they reflect his political view, not what the law actually requires.&nbsp;

are.</font></div>
