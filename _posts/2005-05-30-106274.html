<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529382208">today, at the thrift store, a friend of my sister&#39;s came over to say hello <br/>
to me. She has a 4 year old, and is going to be homeschooling him, and asked <br/>
if we could hang out, so she could get some of my wisdom (LOL). I really do <br/>
want to get together with this mom, but while we stood in the store, I told <br/>
her my advice for right now: Play. Let him play. Be with him. Building the <br/>
relationship is more important than anything &quot;academic&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s already getting grief from those who don&#39;t think homeschooling is <br/>
good, as well as from the School At Home people. I said &quot;Don&#39;t do school at <br/>
home&quot; and she agrees, and says her hubby wants her not to do that. I was so <br/>
glad she said hello to me. I didn&#39;t even remember her (to my embarassment. <br/>
I&#39;m horrible with faces and names. Introvert bleh)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was a good conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, heidiC</div>
