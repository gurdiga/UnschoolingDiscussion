 I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only<br/>
the<br/>
 essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,<br/>
 and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.<br/>

     I enjoyed it very much!  Thanks for sharing it.  And I LOVE<br/>
Thoreau...nothing quite like him!  His writing has inspired me more than any<br/>
other author&#39;s.<br/>

Thank you Lucy.  I would have to say that reading Thoreau has made me as<br/>
much of who I am than any other outside influence.  There is not an author<br/>
that I personally appreciate any more than him.<br/>
<br/>
Many Blessings!<br/>
