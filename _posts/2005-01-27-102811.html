<div id="ygrps-yiv-695128029">Hi everyone.  I&#39;ve been reading on this group for years.<br/>
Dh and I unschool our family (10ds, 7 & 8 dd, 1 baby).  My<br/>
name is Krista and I have a dilema...and would like other<br/>
opinions. I also hope to become an active part of the group ;-) <br/>
<br/>
Our older 3 kids take horseback lessons.  Yesterday at their<br/>
lesson our 7 year old daughter was having trouble w/the horse<br/>
and the trainer yelled at her &quot;Don&#39;t be scared, don&#39;t be a <br/>
chicken!  Chicken, chicken!  Chicken, chicken! Chicken, chicken!&quot;<br/>
That is a quote.  Then dd started to ride over towards dh and I<br/>
and the trainer told her to listen to her.  My dd yelled,<br/>
&quot;NO! You&#39;re mean!&quot; through her tears and came over to me. I stayed<br/>
by my dd&#39;s side until we walked the horse back to the barn.<br/>
<br/>
Then my dd got down and started to walk to our truck.  The<br/>
trainer yelled at her &quot;Don&#39;t you walk away from me, don&#39;t you <br/>
disrespect me like that!  You say yes ma&#39;am!&quot;  BLah, blah....it&#39;s a <br/>
long story, I&#39;m<br/>
sorry......bottom line is I had to explain to the trainer that <br/>
we didn&#39;t send our kids to school, partly so they didn&#39;t have to<br/>
be treated like that and called names.  I said especially with our<br/>
girls that we want them to be strong and stick up for themselves in<br/>
these situations.  That went over like a bag of crap w/the trainer.<br/>
<br/>
I was nice at the time, but am steaming mad now that dh and I had<br/>
the night to process it.  We&#39;re new to southern Alabama, and not <br/>
used to this kind of &quot;yes ma&#39;am&quot; atmosphere.  Obviously we are not <br/>
going<br/>
to spend our money at their barn anymore......should we leave w/out<br/>
an explanation, or tell the owner how uncool our experience with<br/>
her employee was?  There has been no previous problems there, but I <br/>
find this verbal abuse of my child 100% unacceptable.  Thanks in <br/>
advance &quot;y&#39;all&quot;!  ~krista<br/>
<br/>
PS....dh and I are actually proud of dd for not letting someone <br/>
talk to her that way.  DD is trying to save up for a nintendo ds and <br/>
has asked for ways to make extra money so she can get it faster.  Dh<br/>
told her good job for sticking up for herself and gave her some <br/>
money towards her ds.  So, we are not upset w/her....at all...just <br/>
wanted to clarify that :)</div>

You may find that the trainer is fired for that *one last transgression* (it could be the last straw she was looking for). Or not. But I think the owner would appreciate knowing about your experience. <br/>
<br/>
The owner may support the trainer completely, but this could be what causes some changes to occur. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say something.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m sorry for your daughter. She seemed to handle it well though! And people ask what will unschooled children do when faced with a situation with an asshole....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543712890">I would definitely speak to the barn owner and tell her why you are not<br/>
coming back.  Are there other trainers at the barn to choose from?  I&#39;ll bet<br/>
there are other barns within driving distance that are much more<br/>
professional.  It isn&#39;t worth putting up with that and if you leave without<br/>
telling them why, the woman isn&#39;t going to learn anything from it.  My<br/>
girls&#39; instructor is just great.  She is gentle yet straight forward.  She<br/>
is always respectful of the girls.  She pushes them just the right amount,<br/>
based on how they respond to her.  They have learned so much from her.  I<br/>
hope you can find another instructor who will be respectful of your<br/>
children.  We used to go to another barn and the instructor was very nice,<br/>
but I didn&#39;t know what we were missing until we switched barns.  The owner<br/>
at the barn we go to know really knows her stuff and she asks a lot of the<br/>
kids but within the limits that they can handle it.  Sounds like it&#39;s time<br/>
to move on.<br/>

I would be very proud of my daughter, too!  This is exactly what i <br/>
want for my kids!  By the way, my children have never been asked to <br/>
say Yes ma&#39;am to me or my husband.  But lately, Nola (dd10) has <br/>
started saying it in just the right circumstances.  I think she <br/>
likes the effect it has on older people and other &quot;authority <br/>
figures.&quot;  Also, they yell this at their &quot;sensei&quot; in karate.  Maybe <br/>
that&#39;s where she got the idea.  But back to the horseback lessons, <br/>
Krista... I agree with you that&#39;s the last time I&#39;d let that foul <br/>
woman near my kids.  She&#39;s got big problems and I&#39;d let her employer <br/>
know.  Deirdre<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322952842">Thank you everyone for your replies.<br/>
Our plan is for my dh to leave a message(they never answer<br/>
their phones) when he comes home tonight saying that they<br/>
do not need to plan on us for lessons anymore, as we will <br/>
not pay to have our daughter called names.  If Miss Mimi(the owner)<br/>
would like to discuss this further, she can call us when <br/>
we return from a few days away next week.  That is what dh<br/>
said he would say.  It will be interesting to see if she calls<br/>
or not.  I&#39;ll bet not.  <br/>
<br/>
I am just happy that dd has gone from &quot;I&#39;m never horsing again mom!&quot;<br/>
to &quot;I really do want to continue horsing, just not w/miss amy mom.&quot;<br/>

The baby is running a fever today and just wants to be held, so<br/>

It was still culture shock!! My kids call everyone &quot;miss&quot; so-and-so <br/>

I agree. You are leaving because of this person&#39;s rudeness to your <br/>
daughter. If they don&#39;t know there is a problem, they can&#39;t fix it.<br/>
I&#39;d write it down in a letter if it was me, as well as ask for a <br/>
response, in writing. I tend to get flustered in person, and on the <br/>
phone, so I like to do things in writing. That way everything is <br/>
said exactly how I want it to be said.<br/>
ALso, the response you get is a better measure of the place than <br/>
when everything is going hunky dory.<br/>

About the ma&#39;am thing. I&#39;ve lived with a career military man for the <br/>
last 15 years. ANd I was raised in the south, by someone who was <br/>
raised in a military family. The ma&#39;am thing is just ingrained in <br/>
me. I can&#39;t NOT do it. LOL I can&#39;t call someone who is considerably <br/>
older than me by just thier first name either. Cultural things. I <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;require&quot; my kids to say ma&#39;am and sir, but they seem to do <br/>
it, mostly because they hear it, I think. Same with please and thank <br/>
you. I say them, and I like to hear them, and the kids use them. I <br/>
do have a personal bias against yeah, yep, nah and nope. I just <br/>
