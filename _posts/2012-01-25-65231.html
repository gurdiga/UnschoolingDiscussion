<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937799651">I was wondering if anyone has experience with their teens flying alone, specifically with them having to navigate unfamiliar airports. My 14 yr. old daughter wants to go to the Not Back To School Camp in August and we are trying to figure out how to get her there. I believe registration is next month so we are trying to figure this out now. She is old enough to fly without using the unaccompanied minor service but that leaves her on her own. Would this work? I am sure it would depend on the individual teen and she is quite independent but she&#39;s nervous about handling all of that herself, which I understand. She is hoping that someone else has gone through this and can give her any tips on what to expect. Thank you.</div>

go over them before hand. She can always ask for help as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter flew home alone from Detroit from a car design camp when she was 14. (Her dad drove her out since it was rather nerve wracking thinking of dropping a 14 yo off in downtown Detroit! ;-) It turned out to be a very nice place.) She even had to change planes and everything went smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
It helped that she had flown before so knew how to check flight boards and navigate to terminals and gates. It helped us and her a lot that she had a phone. (One she had just for the trip.) Then her next trip 2 years later was to Poland on her own. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s scary the first time! But when they make thoughtful decisions while on their own it gets much easier. :-)<br/>

Most airlines have good info on their website about what to pack where and<br/>

If at all possible I recommend Southwest since they do not charge for even<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151917124">My son flew by himself (without needing to have the unaccompanied minor person) at 12 on Continental. He flew from SEATAC (in WA) to Houston, then to his final destination in North Carolina, where he was visiting a friend who had moved there. <br/>
<br/>
I was a bit nervous because he only had about 30 minutes to make his connecting flight in Houston, and he wasn&#39;t a bit of a beginning reader at that time. <br/>
<br/>
He had experience flying before with me and his dad and grandparents. He wasn&#39;t worried at all, and chose to do it this way. <br/>
<br/>
I did purchase him a cell phone with 100 minutes or something like that for $30, I think. He called me when he landed in Houston and said that his gate was right next to where he had gotten off the plane. He was very relaxed about it and had no problems. He called again when he arrived in North Carolina. No problems. <br/>
<br/>
He wants to fly there again, and anywhere else for that matter. <br/>
<br/>
He also attended the 2-week session of NBTSC in Oregon last year for the first time (at 13) and he loved it. He is planning on going again this year - so he&#39;d probably say it is totally worth it! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796172803">Nice to know about Southwest not charging for bags.  I will remember that!<br/>
I have flown a lot in the past year with my daughter and don&#39;t know how<br/>
familiar you are with the new x-ray scanning at most major airports.  From<br/>
what I have read, I had no interest exposing myself to questionable risk and<br/>
always refuse it when told to do so.  They then do a full body pat down -<br/>
not fun but I am getting used to it!  Just good to know your options before<br/>
you fly.  I had a TERRIBLE experience in Seattle airport last year where<br/>
they herded me into a machine which I thought might be the x-ray machine but<br/>
wasn&#39;t sure.  When I asked if it was (twice), they refused to answer me,<br/>
just kept telling me to put my hands up and stand still.  I felt so violated<br/>
and angry and upset.  I complained to four agencies when I got home and<br/>
heard little back.  But I was glad I told my story.  The machines are fine<br/>
for those who want them, but it is completely legal to refuse, and totally<br/>
uncalled for that they would not even answer my questions.  My daughter<br/>
doesn&#39;t mind them at all, so it isn&#39;t an issue for her.  Good luck to your<br/>
traveling daughter!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192380998">Ah, thank you for the replies. She is reassured by the stories and thinks she can do it. She would be flying from Atlanta to Eugene, Oregon (I hope that&#39;s right for the camp. She wants to attend the 2-week one). We found a map of the Atlanta airport but not one of the airport in Eugene. We haven&#39;t looked at the ones for changeovers yet.<br/>
<br/>
I do know the camp releases information about other campers in case people are looking for travel buddies. From what I understand though, the information is only released after registration and we don&#39;t want to register her unless we are certain she can get there and back relatively easily. Being able to find someone to travel with would be fabulous but we wouldn&#39;t know of anyone until after she registered.<br/>
<br/>
She barely remembers the one time we did fly so this would be a mostly new situation for her.</div>

If she will need to get to baggage claim on her own, I&#39;d definitely go over the airport map with her beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
What about going ahead and registering her, then if she decides she&#39;s not comfortable with the idea of traveling on her own you can cancel and get a refund? It might put stress on her shoulders for her to have to make that decision *before* registering.<br/>

following the crowd to baggage claim is usually not that difficult.<br/>
 You might also ask the NBTSC folks if flying into Portland is a<br/>
possibility.  Southwest has some specials now to September where you can<br/>
fly WITH  2 CHECKED BAGS  INCLUDED  from Atlanta to Portland for under $300<br/>
with only one stop/ plane change.<br/>
Another poster said that some kids travel from Portland to meet the bus in<br/>
Eugene.   NBTSC folks could probably tell you the possibilities for doing<br/>
that and you could learn if there is shuttle service from the airport to<br/>
Amtrak station or bus station.   With shuttle, there is usually a set fare<br/>
and one is less likely to get ripped off by a cab driver recognizing a<br/>
greenhorn.<br/>
<br/>
And make sure she has a cellphone with her! :-).  It will lessen anxiety<br/>
for BOTH of you. :-).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-855809018">I started flying alone around 12 (without unaccompanied minor services). In<br/>
countries where you speak the language, airports are the easiest places.<br/>
There are nice big signs everywhere, and information desks with people to<br/>
help you of you have a question.  People have always been kind, helpful and<br/>
friendly when I had questions in an airport. So if she feels confused at<br/>
anypoint, she can just ask pretty much anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Will she have a connecting flight in a major hub? Will there be someone to<br/>
get her at the airport and take her to camp?<br/>
<br/>
If the airport she will be flying from is close enough to your place, you<br/>
to could go there for lunch and look around the place and she could get a<br/>
feeling for what the signs look like and look for a specific flight on the<br/>
screens and pay attention to the differences between the arrival screens<br/>
and the departure screens...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789449495">Hi:<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter, Anna, traveled to Sweden on her own when she was 14.<br/>
Her closest friend has dual citizenship and spends the summer there, so<br/>
Anna flew there to visit her.<br/>
<br/>
We paid a little extra to get her on a direct flight to Stockholm and<br/>
instead of flying out of Boston (no direct flight) I drove her down to JFK<br/>
airport. So I saw her off at the NYC terminal, and our friends met her at<br/>
the Stockholm terminal. It all went really smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home her direct flight was canceled, and she was routed to<br/>
Amsterdam. She had to wait there for four hours and then get on a plane for<br/>
NYC, (where I was going to pick her up). The airline staff was wonderful,<br/>
according to Anna. I think it helped that there was a group of adults and<br/>
teens who were also going to NYC, and she spent the time with them.<br/>
<br/>
Since then she&#39;s flown on her own to Washington DC. We flew to Albuquerque<br/>
in December (to go to Sandra&#39;s symposium and visit family). She and her<br/>
sister (who is 13yo) were better at navigating the plane changes and<br/>
terminals than I was.<br/>
<br/>
Things that I did for her on her trip to Sweden were to make sure she had<br/>
not only her US cell phone, but one that would work in Sweden. I booked<br/>
direct flights, so she wouldn&#39;t have to deal with changing planes (that<br/>
didn&#39;t work out), and I tracked her flights through the airline websites.<br/>
Our Swedish friends called me when she arrived and when she departed.<br/>
<br/>
I think airline staff are pretty used to helping people. As long as your<br/>
teen has a cell phone and is comfortable approaching and asking airline<br/>
staff for help, she&#39;ll probably have a smooth trip.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll ask Anna if she has and words of wisdom on flying alone for the first<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This will sound odd to downplay the map, but a map can give someone a false sense of knowledge. Getting off the plane you don&#39;t know where you are on the map. And, even if you did, the airport doesn&#39;t look at all like the map!<br/>
<br/>
Better is skills that will help someone navigate any airport. Like knowing to look for and being able to read the flight board. Looking for signs and knowing what what words you&#39;re looking for on those signs (Like Gate B57, Baggage Claim, Transportation). Knowing who to ask for help.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s flying into an airport where connecting flights might be in a different terminal (even if you&#39;re on the same airline), it&#39;s helpful to know that&#39;s possible. (Like Dallas which has 5 terminals connected by trains and the big Chicago airport (I think).) But a map might be more confusing than helpful if she thinks she &quot;knows&quot; how to get around after studying it.<br/>
<br/>
A map is sort of like a rule. It works in one case. Skills for navigating work anywhere :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631344186">Tip from a  person who used to be a flight attendant.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as you exit into the terminal from your first flight  there should be an agent there with a list of connecting flights. Ask her/him.<br/>
They can direct you to the right gate and maybe even have the cart take you.<br/>
I also suggest talking to your flight attendant during the flight telling her you are travelling alone and will need help with a connecting flight.<br/>
She/He will help you when you get there.<br/>

This means that my daughter will have to go through security on her own and then find her own terminal. Gosh, when I was very young, my parents would walk me onto the plane and help me find my seat. :)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t believe we can use the unaccompanied minor service because there has to be a specific person they can release her to when she gets to where she&#39;s going. And then they would have to help her check in when it&#39;s time to come home. I can&#39;t imagine the camp being able to do that, although I did send an email asking about it.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re kicking around ideas. She really wanted to go to the camp in Oregon but now she&#39;s considering the one in Vermont because her dad offered to drive her. We live in Georgia. We still have time to decide. All of the stories and advice you are sharing is very helpful. At first, she loved the idea of flying alone but the more she thinks about it, she&#39;s not sure she feels confident enough to navigate through everything. Our airport is so large and busy and she says just thinking about it is intimidating.<br/>
<br/>
We thought about the train, but that takes 4 days of traveling. I took the train between New Orleans and Atlanta when I was a kid and I loved that ride. But it was only like 12 hours or so.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045429431">I&#39;d definitely talk to the airlines. When I took my son to SeaTac, I was able to get a security clearance and I went with him to the gate and stayed there with him until he boarded. They only allowed me to do that, and not my partner (not his dad), due to a 1-person limit rule. In fact, using that pass we by-passed all the other people in line and went through some special entrance, usually reserved for first class folks or something like that. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like more might be going on for her about traveling, but certainly some of the unknowns could be investigated. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps on the Portland or Eugene side, she could be met at the airport and taken to the drop-off spot in Eugene by some unschooling family attending camp. <br/>

&gt; Better is skills that will help someone navigate any airport. Like knowing to look for and being able to read the flight board. Looking for signs and knowing what what words you&#39;re looking for on those signs (Like Gate B57, Baggage Claim, Transportation). Knowing who to ask for help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My parents-in-law live in Poland, and we in UK, and they used to travel to us by coach (40+ hours) because they were too scared to fly (and don&#39;t speak English). I was concerned that these journeys were increasingly bad for their health.<br/>
<br/>
One time, while they were staying with us, we went online and booked the cheapest flight to anywhere, and traveled with them. At each stage of the journey we stopped and let them get a sense of what was happening and what to do next. We reassured them that airports do not want people getting lost and wandering about and, if you stop and take a deep breath, you can see how well designed they are amidst the apparent chaos.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, this strategy worked for them and they&#39;ve flown ever since :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127363891">I&#39;ve spent a lot my life traveling and in airports. My work involved lots of travel - sometimes multiple times a week. There were times when the attendant at the check-in counter would ask people in line if someone could help with translation, and I would always volunteer if I knew the language (I&#39;m multi-lingual). Sometimes a young, overloaded mother (or father) traveling alone with her children would ask if I could help her navigate through the airport. <br/>
<br/>
Most times I would offer help before someone had to ask me, especially if I saw someone that looked like they needed assistance. On my last flight, I was the (not so) young, overloaded mother traveling alone with two children and a teenager traveling alone played with my children on the international flight and we all walked together through the airport and parted ways at the baggage claim.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite possible that the check in attendant wouldn&#39;t mind asking a person on the same flight if your daughter could tag along with that passanger. Or maybe for your daughter to ask a young mom (or someone else that will probably be traveling at a slow pace) if she could follow them through both airports, if they have the same end destination.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411409507">I agree with Rippy. The flight attendant usually has a list of people and where their connecting flights, so does  the gate agent. The Flight Attendant and the gate agent can definitively help you get to you gate and connecting flight.  I have been called up from the Flight Attendant lounge to help translate  because the agents knew I spoke Spanish and Portuguese. The are willing to help. specially in your daughters case being a young girl flying alonr<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820724600">At LAX in Los Angeles, they wont let you in without a ticket if you ask the security guard but if you tell the agent when you check in that you need a pass to accompany your minor to the gate they will print you one.  I don&#39;t think you can get one if you check in electronically from home or from your smart phone though, so it&#39;s best to go to the old fashioned baggage check line to check in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595329737">I work part-time for jetBlue and they offer assistance at no charge to customers that need it (young adults, people flying for the first time, elderly, ect..).  You could ask the airline she is flying with if that is an option.  It&#39;s just someone to meet them at the ticket counter and to assist as need be getting through security and to the gate and then they will meet them when they deplane and assist them in getting to the baggage claim area and to whom they are supposed to be meeting for pick up.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it is true that no one without a ticket is allowed past security, but sometimes you can request a &quot;gate pass&quot; that will allow you to accompany someone to the gate.  Them granting you one will just depend on the airport, the TSA and how busy they are that day.<br/>

Her friend picked her up at the San Francisco airport and brought her back the next morning for the last leg of the trip.  It all worked out fine and was a big adventure.
