<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694530124">Hi Danielle,<br/>
<br/>
  I am looking forward to checking out the letterboxing - it sounds<br/>
intriguing.  Thank-you for the suggestion!<br/>
<br/>
  I am wondering how/where you go rock climbing, and also how did you build<br/>
a rock wall off of your climber?  I have been pondering this ever since I<br/>
read your post!<br/>
<br/>
  Thank-you so much for responding with specific suggestions - it is really<br/>
helping me to find new ways of living, learning , and connecting with my<br/>
kids!<br/>

<br/>
Rock climbing is great fun, and it doesn&#39;t have to be scary or dangerous if<br/>
you stay roped up or close to the ground. It makes a great sport for<br/>
unschoolers too, because you don&#39;t need a team and you can travel! It<br/>
teaches self-reliance and good decision making, builds trust and<br/>
relationships within the family, and I could go on...<br/>
<br/>
Building the climber and the climbing wall was a great unschooling project,<br/>
too--from the design and research stages, to engineering, building and<br/>
playing! We&#39;ve also started a homeschooling 4-H Rock Hounds club, which is<br/>
turning out to be quite popular. I have about 30 kids at my house every<br/>
other week (except for field trips to real rock and other cool places).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s tons of info on home climbing gyms online. You can also check out<br/>
our climbing log, which has pictures of the kids climbing and a link to our<br/>
home climbing wall about midway down, I think. Dh keeps this page, so<br/>
content is all his. *g*<br/>
