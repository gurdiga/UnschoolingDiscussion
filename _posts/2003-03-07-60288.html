<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727059974">Sorry about that last blank message. I got mixed up.Then I lost what I wrote. <br/>
I am sure it was quite profound.<br/>
My journey to an unschooling way of life continues.I have been reading <br/>
everything on this list and at sites recommended here and can see that I have <br/>
a long way to go. <br/>
I seem to struggle with controlling my children. I have done a lot of work in <br/>
this area since the birth of my first child, but I can see that there are <br/>
many things I can do differently. I am appreciating what I read on this list, <br/>
keep it coming!!<br/>
I am reading John Holt&#39;s&#39;&quot;How Children Fail&quot; and find it very interesting. I <br/>
see myself as a child in school in this book, and I also see the mistakes I <br/>
have made with my son. He is seven, and I hope I can make up for these <br/>
mistakes from now on.<br/>
Thank you for your collective wisdom.<br/>

there ages. I try to treat my daughter as an equally and talk to her as much<br/>
as possible. i believe in time out when nessisary. She pushes my buttons and<br/>
is clever. I find the more i get mad or fustrated they get worse. I<br/>
sometimes put on a movie or get them etertain  a walk out of the room and<br/>
make a tea. My patience level has change the more I talk to other parents<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116981713">It&#39;s good to know I&#39;m not the only &#39;newbie&#39; out there! Control is something<br/>
I&#39;ve had to work on heaps too.<br/>
My oldest (8yrs) is a control freak and I know I helped create that in him.<br/>
Seeing my kids relax and enjoy making their own choices and at times<br/>
reveling in new found freedoms has been joyous!!<br/>
I&#39;m finding too that as I seek to undo what I&#39;ve done to my kids, I am<br/>
freeing myself at the same time.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My oldest (8yrs) is a control freak and I know I helped create that in <br/>
him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could be only by genetics, though.  Some people really like to line stuff up <br/>
parallel to edges and make schedules.<br/>
<br/>
We have a young friend who&#39;s one of four, and ever since she was tiny, <br/>
pre-verbal toddler, her thing was putting things where they went.  When moms <br/>
and kids were at the park, she would toddle around putting the right baby <br/>
blanket with the right diaper bag, and handing people their own car keys if <br/>
they had been lying on the table, and putting trash in the trash can.  <br/>
Patiently and happily, but always sorting, sorting, matching, replacing.   At <br/>
the children&#39;s museum her fun was putting the blocks back up, putting the <br/>
markers back up, stacking the papers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Her siblings were merrily messy, but Hana persevered in bringing order to the <br/>
world.<br/>
