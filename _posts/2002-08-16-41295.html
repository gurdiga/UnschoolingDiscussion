<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009194908">I haven&#39;t personally called the phone numbers below to verify them.  But <br/>
making photo copies of your credit cards is a good idea even if the phone <br/>
numbers below are bogus.<br/>

&gt; &gt;For once here is some Internet info that may actually be helpful to us<br/>
&gt;:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine, do<br/>
&gt; &gt;both sides of each license, credit card, etc.  You will know what you<br/>
&gt;had<br/>
&gt; &gt;in your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;cancel. Keep the photocopy in a safe place.<br/>
&gt;A corporate attorney sent this out to the employees in his company. I<br/>
&gt;pass<br/>
&gt;it along, for your information.<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ve all heard horror stories about fraud that&#39;s committed<br/>
&gt;us in your name, address, SS#, credit, etc.  Unfortunately I (the author<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;this piece who happens to be an attorney) have firsthand knowledge,<br/>
&gt;because<br/>
&gt;my wallet was stolen last month and within a week the thieves) ordered<br/>
&gt;an<br/>
&gt;expensive monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,<br/>
&gt;had a<br/>
&gt;credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number<br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;DMV to change my driving record information online, and more.<br/>
&gt;But here&#39;s some critical information to limit the damage in<br/>
&gt;case this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always<br/>
&gt;advises,<br/>
&gt;cancel your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll<br/>
&gt;free<br/>
&gt;numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those<br/>
&gt;where you can find them easily.   But  also file a police report<br/>
&gt;immediately<br/>
&gt;in the jurisdiction where it was stolen, this  proves to credit<br/>
&gt;providers<br/>
&gt;you were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there<br/>
&gt;ever is one).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But here&#39;s what is perhaps most important: (I never ever<br/>
&gt;thought to do this)  Call the three national credit reporting<br/>
&gt;organizations<br/>
&gt;immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#.<br/>
&gt;I had never heard of doing that until advised by a bank that<br/>
&gt; &gt;called to tell me an application for credit was made over the Internet<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt;my name.  The alert means any company that checks your credit knows<br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt; &gt;information was stolen and they have to contact you by phone to<br/>
&gt;authorize<br/>
&gt; &gt;new credit. By the  time I was advised to do this, almost 2 weeks after<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;theft, all the damage had been done.<br/>
&gt;There are records of all the credit checks initiated by the<br/>
&gt;thieves&#39; purchases, none of which I knew about before placing the alert.<br/>
&gt;Since then, no additional damage has been done, and the thieves threw my<br/>
&gt;wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in).  It seems to have<br/>
&gt;stopped<br/>
&gt;them in their tracks.<br/>
&gt;The numbers are:<br/>
&gt;         Equifax: 1-800-525-6285<br/>
&gt;         Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742<br/>
&gt;         Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289<br/>
&gt;         Social Security Administration (fraud line):  1-800-269-0271<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;We pass along jokes; we pass along just about everything. Do<br/>
&gt;think about passing this information along. It could really help<br/>
&gt;someone.<br/>
&gt;I have copied all the addresses, account numbers, and phone<br/>
&gt;numbers of all my credit cards, driver license, debit cards, etc. and<br/>
&gt;placed<br/>
&gt;a copy in my important papers and on my computer.  Very similar to the<br/>
&gt;above<br/>
&gt;information. I&#39;ve also made copies and gave to my wife, in case<br/>
&gt;something<br/>
&gt;happens to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah, I can hear some of you say, &quot;That will take too much time to do&quot;!<br/>
&gt;Imagine the time it&#39;ll take you to do it after something happens.<br/>
&gt;The 30 minutes it took me, is well spent.<br/>
