<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481658048">The food scenario thread was interesting, and it motivated me to post a <br/>
question/concern about my girl&#39;s eating habits.<br/>
<br/>
I think I described her here not too long ago as eating lots of sugary <br/>
stuff. She even went through a phase of stealing money from family members, <br/>
and using it to buy candy. Well, about a week ago, she went through many <br/>
otter pops in the late evening(I didn&#39;t count them, but it was a lot). About <br/>
1:30 in the morning, she had an anxiety episode, where her chest was <br/>
hurting. This came about because she had gone out to call the dog, and the <br/>
dog didn&#39;t come to her. The dog was in her brother&#39;s room. This missing dog <br/>
caused Katie to worry, and her heart to thump and she felt like she was <br/>
going to throw up (reflux). I think the combination of all the sugar from <br/>
the many otter pops made her active and even hyper-active, then not finding <br/>
the dog caused the anxiety feelings. I told her all of this, and said &quot;If <br/>
you eat sugary things this late at night, you&#39;re setting yourself up for <br/>
sleeplessness.&quot; Gave her some Pepto Bismol, stroked her back a little while, <br/>
and had her sleep in a reclining chair, to avoid any more reflux. She slept <br/>
fine after that.<br/>
<br/>
Well, day before yesterday, she ate a ton of otter pops AGAIN. Not late at <br/>
night, it was in the afternoon. It didn&#39;t affect her emotional state or her <br/>
behavior, but it ticked me off, because she consumed more than two dozen <br/>
otter pops, leaving only three when we got home from running errands. I let <br/>
her know that I was quite angry about that, and considered it to be <br/>
extremely inconsiderate of the rest of the family for her to eat them up <br/>
like that. I didnt&#39; shout, but I was adamant and my tone of voice was firm. <br/>
Her chin wobbled a bit and she said she was sorry, and had the brilliant <br/>
idea of making popsicles out of kool-aid.<br/>
<br/>
They were YUMMY. She made probably 30 of them, and everyone had some...and <br/>
she sucked down by far the most of them. At one point she said &quot;My lips are <br/>
burning!&quot; but after a brief rest, she went back to chomping down on the <br/>
homemade popsicles. Again, she was consuming a lot of sugary stuff in the <br/>
late evening. I brought up the incident from last week, and I also asked <br/>
about her burning lips, but she wanted some more, so she had some more.<br/>
<br/>
And at 4 o&#39;clock this morning, she came to my bedroom and said &quot;I haven&#39;t <br/>
been able to fall asleep all night. Can I sleep in here?&quot; (hubby has a night <br/>
job) so she got in bed with me and wiggled around quite a bit, and fell <br/>
asleep eventually.  I did say to her then, half groggy &quot;it&#39;s all the sugar <br/>
in those kool-aid popsicles&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay. We took the controls off the food a long time ago, and I&#39;ve watched <br/>
her gain some weight (though she always has been a hearty eater) I haven&#39;t <br/>
told her &quot;you can&#39;t have those otter pops&quot; and have even bought more, when <br/>
the current box has run out (pretty stinking fast). I didn&#39;t tell her last <br/>
night NOT to eat the homemade popsicles.<br/>
<br/>
What should I do, if anything, the next time she starts sucking down the <br/>
otter pops, or the kool aid or whatever? Even the burning lips last night <br/>
didn&#39;t stop her from continuing to eat the popsicles. Should I have said <br/>
&quot;Hey, slow down there, girl&quot;? This child is not exhibiting much self control <br/>
here. Do I need to do something/say something to stop her? I think she&#39;s <br/>
hurting herself.<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

<br/>
HEY!  I just wrote something about this, but not because I read  this.<br/>
Sugar doesn&#39;t make kids hyperactive.<br/>
 <br/>
Caffein doesn&#39;t stunt their growth.<br/>
 <br/>
Old wives&#39; tales.  Old mean mom tales.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I told her all of this, and said &quot;If <br/>

sleeplessness.&quot;=-<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think this is true.  It&#39;s worth looking into the blind studies  done <br/>
with moms who were sure sugar caused hyperactivity.  It didn&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Well, day before yesterday, she ate a ton of otter pops AGAIN.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Otter pops are some of the cheapest things you could possibly buy, aren&#39;t  <br/>
they?  For anyone unfamiliar, an otter pop is a tube of plastic with  flavored <br/>
water in it you freeze in the freezer, cut the end of the plastic off,  and <br/>
squeeze the stuff out and eat it.  It&#39;s like a popsicle in a tube, but  not as <br/>
thick as popsicles (not as much flavor or sugar).  They&#39;re unfrozen  when you <br/>
buy them, so they&#39;re cheap to ship.  You can freeze and melt and  re-freeze; it <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I let her know that I was quite angry about that, and considered it to  <br/>
be <br/>
extremely inconsiderate of the rest of the family for her to eat them up  <br/>

-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Your response probably did her more damage than 200 otter pops would&#39;ve  done.<br/>
Was the rest of the family really wanting Otter Pops?  We have some  we&#39;ve <br/>
had for over a year; send them over here.  I moved them from the  storage <br/>
freezer into the kitchen to try to get rid of them.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-I haven&#39;t told her &quot;you can&#39;t have those otter pops&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
WHAT?  You just did.  You told her she was extremely  inconsiderate to have <br/>
had those otter pops.  If you say &quot;yes you can&quot; and  then get angry, that&#39;s <br/>
bigtime entrapment.<br/>
 <br/>
Can you make popsicles with juice instead of koolaid?<br/>
We use ice trays and the rings from Discovery Toys called  &quot;Boomerings.&quot;  Put <br/>
the juice in the ice tray, stick a ring in each one, and  it takes four or <br/>
five of them to be the equivalent of a small glass of  juice.  My kids will <br/>
still eat those, even though they&#39;re big guys.   It&#39;s a quicky little bit of <br/>
coolness and juice.  (other kinds of plastic  rings would work, and then you can <br/>
wash the rings in the dishwasher by putting  them over two posts, or in with <br/>
forks and spoons)<br/>
 <br/>
-=-What should I do, if anything, the next time she starts sucking down the  <br/>
otter pops, or the kool aid or whatever?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe find a happier healthier substitute, or just don&#39;t worry about  it.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think otter pops could make anyone gain weight.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-This child is not exhibiting much self control <br/>
here. Do I need to do  something/say something to stop her? I think she&#39;s <br/>
hurting herself-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Is she eating those things because she&#39;s bored?<br/>
Find something to do that&#39;s fun that gets her busy, uses her hands, or gets  <br/>
her out of the house where the otter pops aren&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948654793">I have a 3 year old who is well into popsicles and ice cream so I know <br/>
what it feels like! He wants several a day but I find myself having to <br/>
limit him to 3 or 4 (if we go to Grandma&#39;s she has some). I make them <br/>
and buy them but we don&#39;t have a huge freezer and I have 3 other kids <br/>
who want them too. I wish I could let him eat as many as he wants but <br/>
he also has tooth decay on his top teetht that I don&#39;t think the sugar <br/>
(even juice sugar) will be helping. I wonder if he could eat them as <br/>
often as he wants would he slow down, but I can&#39;t because of the <br/>
situation. He does get upset when he&#39;s had his three though and that I <br/>
find really hard. I offer other stuff and usually he will have some <br/>
fruit instead. I wonder if he is bored too as he seems to wander to the <br/>
fridge regularly - but he also doesn&#39;t eat big meals but lots, little <br/>
and often so maybe he is hungry?</div>

If your dd ate 10 of them in one sitting, it&#39;s like drinking a tall glass of<br/>
cool-aid. (2 cups)  Not so bad when you look at it like that.  And they are<br/>
really cheap.  <br/>

I am so glad Sandra took the moment to define these because I was <br/>
reading it and couldn&#39;t for the life of me figure out why anyone was <br/>
eating &quot;otter pups&quot; and so many at one sitting! Ewwww...<br/>

You choose to.  You don&#39;t &quot;find yourself having to.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It will make a difference in your thinking and your relationship with him  if <br/>
you view it all in terms of your decisions rather than casting yourself in a  <br/>
more helpless position, controlled by forces outside of you.<br/>

If you&#39;re worried about sugar on his teeth, you could have him rinse his  <br/>
mouth after each one, or brush his teeth (toothpaste wouldn&#39;t be necessary; it&#39;s  <br/>
never necessary).<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I offer other stuff and usually he will have some <br/>
fruit  instead.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Fruit sugars will do teeth in too.  <br/>
Bread/carbohydrate turns to sugar in the mouth (famous kid-demo, chew a  <br/>
saltine cracker without swallowing and it will turn sweet).<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I wonder if he could eat them as often as he wants would he slow down,  <br/>
but I can&#39;t because of the situation.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
You could if your priorities are different.  I&#39;m not saying your  priorities <br/>
should be different, just saying it&#39;s a choice and not a  &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
What dentists say about teeth and what is biochemically true about teeth  <br/>
aren&#39;t always the same thing.  Teeth and mouths can&#39;t hear dentists  talking, <br/>
they don&#39;t read dental journals, and dentists change their minds (not  very <br/>
swiftly, because they have huge investments in all their equipment and  decades-old <br/>
knowledge).  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly&#39;s friend in England who also just got braces (not suspenders, and not  <br/>
a garter belt, and I don&#39;t know what they call  <br/>
tooth-bracing-orthodontic-applicances in England), and they were comparing care  routines and directives.   <br/>
Jasmine&#39;s orthodontist told her not to  floss, as her gums are too immature <br/>
for floss.  (She&#39;s 14.)  Holly&#39;s  is always reminding her to floss, giving her <br/>
more threaders and floss every time  she turns around.  (She&#39;s 13, and as <br/>
prematurity goes, was a preemie and is  not &quot;precocious&quot; biologically speaking.)<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I wonder if he is bored too as he seems to wander to the <br/>
fridge  regularly - -=-<br/>
 <br/>
If you beat him to the punch by having little platters of snacks out (cut  up <br/>
cheese, nuts) he wouldn&#39;t get up and go to the fridge.  If you&#39;re all  out of <br/>
the house doing something cool, he can&#39;t reach the fridge.  But  eating <br/>
frequently is probably healthier than three big fill-up meals.<br/>

platter. He loves cheese too but I again restrict that somewhat (He <br/>
is prone to eczema)as I&#39;m not sure a lot of it would be good for him. <br/>
I would have some cheese and some other stuff, ready done and left <br/>
out for him. <br/>
I agree his way of eating is best for him. He is a little guy with a <br/>
big personality who loves to grab a snack and run!</div>

I think this contradicts why you said you had to in the earlier post.<br/>
 <br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter to any of the rest of us, but it&#39;s still a choice and it  <br/>
will help you not just with this but with all kinds of decision making if you  <br/>
can try to see the choices you make and decide on what basis you&#39;ll make  <br/>
them.  That&#39;s living by principles instead of by rules.     Both Danielle Conger <br/>
and Ben Lovejoy have written on that, and are linked  here:<br/>
