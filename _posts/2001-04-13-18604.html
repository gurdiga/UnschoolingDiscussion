<div id="ygrps-yiv-908032569">Is it an American tradition to have a special cake at Easter?<br/>

<br/>
I remeber as kid mum giving us hard boiled eggs to paint.  We would <br/>
usually paint faces on them.  We always got a chocolate egg or 2 as <br/>
well - actually we got a *lot* of chocolate eggs as we had lots of <br/>
aunties and uncles who had no children of their own........<br/>
<br/>
My father would not allow us to hang washing on the line on Good <br/>
Friday, he told us the blood of Christ would drip on it.<br/>

<br/>
The cakes are special at Easter, but it&#39;s not traditional for all families to <br/>
have them.  There are molds shaped like a lamb.  They even sit up, like <br/>
they&#39;re kneeling (what&#39;s that position in animals called?  Still upright but <br/>
&quot;knees bent&quot;?)<br/>
<br/>
I think a stronger American Easter tradition is to eat ham for Easter dinner. <br/>
  It&#39;s like the supreme moment to declare &quot;We are Christians.  Jesus is <br/>
risen, we can eat pig.&quot;  Do they do that in England too?<br/>
<br/>
Chocolate bunnies are more common than chocolate eggs, as the centerpiece <br/>
candy-gift for kids.  Some families do (used to, anyway) the panorama <br/>
sugar-eggs but I think that&#39;s more German.  There are some very German towns <br/>
in Texas and lots of them in the MidWest.  Can anyone confirm those as more <br/>
common there?  I could be wrong.<br/>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am getting tired of all these candy holidays!&nbsp; Valentine&#39;s Day, 
Easter, Halloween, Christmas, then all those birthday parties in-between!&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, I can&#39;t seem to quite let go.&nbsp; My dd&#39;s each have a very 
special, tiny, Easter basket from grandma.&nbsp; This year I bought little 
bottles of lotion, lip balm, sugarless gum, and a silly putty (egg shaped - 
these seem to be more prominent in the stores at Easter time).&nbsp; Then I felt 
like they would be disappointed if there was no chocolate.&nbsp; So I went to a 
candy store that had some tiny foil wrapped chocolates shaped like flowers, 
bunnies, and baseballs and got a few for each.&nbsp; (The store did have lots of 
chocolate bunnies and chocolate eggs.&nbsp; Jelly beans are very popular 
too.&nbsp; The grocery stores all have big bags of egg shaped candy bars - 
snickers, etc.)&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We also dye hard boiled eggs and blown-out egg shells and hide them in the 
back yard.&nbsp; So we eat lots of eggs this time of year!&nbsp; We all love the 
dying, hiding, and hunting part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, Easter is one time of the year when LOTS of people who normally don&#39;t 
go to church will go to a service.&nbsp; Most churches add an extra service or 
two because of the crowds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Mary Ellen in the USA<br>PS.&nbsp; maybe I get so annoyed about &#39;candy 
holidays&#39; because I&#39;m not the one getting the chocolate.&nbsp;

He is risen!). Lamb was the traditional meal, served with an egg rich bread

Ham is more traditional for Boxing Day, I think, <br/>
presumably for the reasons mentioned before, about <br/>
being cured and therefore available...  The shops close <br/>
here for Easter Sunday, not Good Friday.  Hot cross <br/>
buns, now there&#39;s a tradition I can live with!  I saw a <br/>
headline for a piece in the newspaper, some clergy-<br/>
person lamenting the fact that Christmas is the bigger <br/>
celebration now, even though Easter&#39;s the bigger <br/>
&#39;miracle.&#39;  The thing is that so many of the traditions <br/>
for both holidays are ones co-opted from Pagan <br/>
celebrations, eggs and spiced buns from Oestra, <br/>
evergreens and carolling from Yule...  Yule needs to be <br/>
a bigger party, to raise people&#39;s spirits in the depths <br/>
of Winter, with Easter, Spring&#39;s on it&#39;s way so it&#39;s <br/>
not so necessary to get drunk and light candles and <br/>
fires...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the traditional cake for Easter is called Simnel <br/>
cake, I&#39;ve no idea what&#39;s in it or how different it is <br/>
to any other kind of cake...<br/>

We got some wonderful baskets from my inlaws yeaterday.  They had not a sweet in sight, but a nice new outfit for each, stuffed bunnies (they give them every year), and a few little cars and trucks.  The boys were very happy with all of it, even the baskets.  The carry their things around in the litle baskets, went to bed with the bunnies and went everywhere, even the shower, with their new vehicles.  Maybe it is because of our older boy&#39;s allergies that they leave out the sweets, but either way it was appreciated.<br/>
