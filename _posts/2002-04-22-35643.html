<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336724753">Definitely!  I am trying to let go more and more each day, to trust my children, and come closer and closer to unschooling.  I value the opinions of veteran unschoolers as a sort of beacon lighting the way.  When I entered &quot;homeschooling&quot; at yahoogroups.com, hundreds of choices were available.  I chose this list, and others for their unschooling perspective.  If I were to ask the same question on a non-unschooling list, I would get a wide range of answers/opinions.  But I am specifically searching for feedback with an unschooling perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Keep it coming Sandra and others!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

  I thank God for the folks who were bold enough to tell me &quot;that&#39;s not<br/>
  unschooling&quot;!  For unschooling to work there has to be a leap of faith<br/>
  and it&#39;s all about trusting your child/ren to learn.  When I first<br/>
  studied unschooling my gut told me it was true but I clung to my &quot;school&quot;<br/>
  mentality.  Until I let go completely I didn&#39;t see it work, since I did I<br/>
  know that I know it happens.<br/>
<br/>
  Folks, like Sandra, who held up the standard in spite of the torpedos<br/>
  gave me a vision to focus on.<br/>
