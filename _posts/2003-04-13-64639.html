 Actually, that&#39;s only the first book.  It goes from the big bang to<br/>
 Alexander the Great, right?  I have the second book that goes up to about<br/>
 Roman times.  Now I find there&#39;s at least one more.  Yay! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, ok. I wondered when it said Vol. 1-7, just exactly what that meant. It <br/>
goes to Athenian times so I guess I&#39;ll have to look for the rest now. :)<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
