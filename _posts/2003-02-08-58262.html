&lt;&lt; a Bazaar game very kindly<br/>
given to us by Sandra in August (it is easily one of our favorite games,<br/>
which Michael-Anne nearly always manages to win in spite of her magpie<br/>
tendency to hoard jewels &lt;g&gt;) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good.  We love that game too.  It&#39;s art.  And math without numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Today I sewed.  I made Holly a skirt.  It has four sections, centered in <br/>
front (so five if you count I split the back section to put in an invisible <br/>
zipper, for which they have changed the plastic zipper-foot assortment and it <br/>
took me a long time to figure out which one my machine needed), with two <br/>
inset gores coming out from each side in the back.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s waist is 24&quot; and I hadn&#39;t made a skirt with a waistband for years.  <br/>
Buttonhole.  Whole shebang.<br/>
<br/>
Not only without a pattern, but as I went I changed my plan.  <br/>
<br/>
I did it all by machine, even finishing edges (because it&#39;s silk and will <br/>
ravel to nothingness otherwise) and hemming and finishing the waistband (used <br/>
selvage for inside edge, sewed in the gutter of the waistband/skirt in <br/>
front).  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s for her graduation from a modelling class tomorrow.  Yick, but she&#39;s <br/>
happy.    Three outfits, and two she had come up with on her own, but for a <br/>
color, she had a lavender top from a thrift store, we bought 50cent crafts <br/>
paint and painted a worn out pair of blue platform sandals purple, and now <br/>
she has the two-colors of purple skirt, below knees in the front, full and to <br/>
ankles in the back.<br/>
<br/>
Too much work and it will fit her once or twice more.<br/>
<br/>
But part of the time I was working on it there was flow and I didn&#39;t know <br/>
what time it was and didn&#39;t care and that can be really nice.<br/>
<br/>
I repaired a pair of pants I made for Keith years ago (to go over his SCA <br/>
armor) and I need to copy them in black (they&#39;re gold/yellow), and make a <br/>
pair for Kirby.  Before Monday.  Right.  <br/>

Don&#39;t ya just hate when they change things like that! I&#39;m sewing my girls<br/>
dresses for Valentines day, and went through a pile of bobbins looking<br/>
for the flat ones. Apparently they are made taller now. Geesh.<br/>

an all-new machine.  but if I got a new one (I have a mid-80&#39;s Kenmore which <br/>
is okay), I&#39;d probably need all new bobbins and to learn lots of new stuff.  <br/>
But the zip  and power of a new machine...<br/>
But knowing how to oil the one I have, and how to go backwards without <br/>
thinking...<br/>
But the excitement of new equipment which would make me want to sew more!<br/>
But not knowing how to thread it quickly...<br/>
<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
I just hope when this one does give up its mechanical ghost that we can <br/>
afford another one.<br/>

I ended up buying a gorgeous, drool worthy Viking machine, but I did<br/>
shop around first, and found a sewing machine and vaccuum cleaner repair<br/>
place that had a really cool range of machines available.  It was like a<br/>
museum.  Prowling around and checking out your options could be fun.<br/>

&gt; I equally wish my 1952 Singer still worked well, and that I would need to buy <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why not get the &#39;52 working again? The parts were simple and for the <br/>
most part replaceable. It has a pretty stitch the new ones probably <br/>
won&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;d love a new 2 or 3 thousand dollar ones that does <br/>
*everything*. Still happy with my old ones though.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s skirt sounds very nice. Does she need jeans? I&#39;m always buying <br/>
nice jeans at the thrift store that my oldest won&#39;t wear. Cute ones too. <br/>
I&#39;ve got a few to send if you want, I think Holly is right between the <br/>
two of mine in size. And my youngest has this hang up about pants with <br/>
zippers that I don&#39;t know if she is ever going to get over. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-723232801">If you do a lot of sewing and have a serviceable machine, why not try a<br/>
serger (or as we say in Australia, an overlocker ) I have one that I<br/>
just adore. They are really zippy. Of course you have to follow the<br/>
diagrams exactly for the different threadings, but it is worth it for<br/>
me. <br/>
<br/>
BTW you can turn those jeans into jean skirts pretty easily.<br/>

She&#39;s tall and size ten.  That would be good if you&#39;re willing.  Thanks!<br/>
