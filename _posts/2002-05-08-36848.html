<div id="ygrps-yiv-627858413">Thank you for this whole thread Pam!!!<br/>
Whether or not I ever use the negative/positive IRL matters not a bit to <br/>
me....I have another tool at my disposal and I&#39;m really grateful for that. <br/>
Because you just never know.<br/>
It seems to me that at the edge of my consciousness there is this little <br/>
tickling going on, like I can almost understand why you would use that to <br/>
explain stuff irl, but then it just goes away.<br/>
I&#39;m not quite there.<br/>
I still need to sit and read it over again to really let this all sink in.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the positve/negative thing could be useful to just explain <br/>
relationships between things? But I&#39;m still so math phobic I actually get a <br/>
ball of frustration ( I can physically feel it) in the pit of my stomache.<br/>
I have to really put an effort forth just to read the type of post you used <br/>
to explain this.<br/>
And yet, I find it fascinating.<br/>
Fascinating that there is real math, useful ways to learn this, not the <br/>
stressful experience that was mine in school.<br/>
Just writing this makes me get that feeling in my gut....very uncomfortable.<br/>
The word &quot;math&quot; does it to me.<br/>
Thank you for helping us nonmathies!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
I provide tools for my kids, but so far they are very self taught....I really <br/>
want to be more creative with my use of numbers to be more help to them!!<br/>
Keep it coming....please.<br/>
I need math therapy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
In fact that&#39;s what *all* (or lots) of math is. Math helps us to compare<br/>
things, to see how two things relate to one another, how changing one thing<br/>
affects the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
If, for instance, you&#39;re traveling from Tampa to Miami, if you set your<br/>
reference (zero) point at Tampa, you&#39;ll know how far you are in relation to<br/>
Tampa. That isn&#39;t really very useful. But if you set your reference point as<br/>
Miami, then you know how many more miles you have to go.<br/>
<br/>
With positive and negative numbers you get more information than just how<br/>
far it is related to the zero point. It tells you *where* -- which side --<br/>
in relation to the zero point. So if a train engineer tells the dispatcher<br/>
they&#39;re broken down 10 miles from Miami that isn&#39;t enough information for<br/>
the dispatcher to send out a repair crew. But the plus or minus (or east or<br/>
west, or before or after (which the dispatcher will need to *relate* to<br/>
which way that particular train is heading) - those are all just different<br/>
ways of telling where) tells the dispatcher which side of Miami they&#39;re at.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s even more useful when you get x-y coordinates -- which is shut down<br/>
time for some people ;-) -- so you can locate things on the surface of the<br/>
earth (or the moon or Mars) rather than on a train track.<br/>
<br/>
Say you wanted to tell a robot how to get to a meteor that hit Mars.<br/>
(Admittedly not an everyday household use, but nonetheless a real life use.<br/>
;-) Telling the robot the meteor hit 5 miles from the robot&#39;s landing site<br/>
on Mars means it could be *anywhere* on a circle of points that are 5 miles<br/>
from the landing point. But saying it hit 4 miles east and 3 miles north<br/>
precisely identifies exactly one of those points. Or 4 miles east and 3<br/>
miles south pinpoints another unique point.<br/>
<br/>
(Choosing the landing site as the zero or reference point is just for<br/>
convenience sake. It&#39;s just whatever will make talking about hoe onr thing<br/>
relates to another easiest. What reference point to choice would be obvious<br/>
to anyone actually immersed in a real life problem because you&#39;d know what<br/>
information you wanted and what you wanted to do with it. Which is a major<br/>
weakness of made up problems because you aren&#39;t gathering and manipulating<br/>
and *relating* the information for any real personally meaningful reason.)<br/>
<br/>
If we say that north and east are positive and south and west are negative.<br/>
(Again, choosing that is *just* another convention because it&#39;s less<br/>
confusing. There&#39;s nothing negative about south or west. It&#39;s just<br/>
convention to put North up and East right, South down and West left. And<br/>
it&#39;s just convention to put positives to the top and right and negatives to<br/>
the bottom and down. Being conventional just makes communicating less<br/>
confusing.)<br/>
<br/>
So we can say the meteor is at coordinates 4,3 for the north east one and<br/>
-4,3 for the south east one. (And 4,-3 would put it in the north west<br/>
quadrant and -4,-3 would put it in the south west quadrant.)<br/>
<br/>
All that does is tell the robot how the meteor&#39;s location relates to the<br/>
zero point set at the landing zone.<br/>
<br/>
Of course nonmathies would say why not just stick with north, south, east<br/>
and west. ;-) For *that* example with the robot sitting at the landing site<br/>
the north-south reference is probably easier to understand than x-y<br/>
coordinates and therefore better. *But* if you start needing to know<br/>
something about -- relate -- the distance between two meteors rather than<br/>
between one meteor and the zero point, or relate the distance between where<br/>
the robot is and where it wants to go, or relate how far the robot who has<br/>
moved from the landing zone is from each meteor to figure out the closest<br/>
meteor, then the positive and negative numbers make the calculation<br/>
incredibly easy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032135316">Thank you Joyce, for this explanation.<br/>
It&#39;s beginning to sink in now.<br/>
It definitely leaves a &quot;friendlier&quot; impression in my brain about positive<br/>
and negative numbers.<br/>
I think some of the math wall is starting to crumble. :-)<br/>
