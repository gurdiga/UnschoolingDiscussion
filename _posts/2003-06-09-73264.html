&gt; Heidi, I just wanted to say that I am amazed by you. On the whole <br/>
&gt; unschooling <br/>
&gt; spectrum, most of the things you&#39;re struggling with are not huge, <br/>
&gt; disempowering things, but you keep at it. You mention something, get <br/>
&gt; feedback, and mostly <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t take it personally, but really think about it and re-evaluate your <br/>
&gt; stance. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are so many people who come in SURE they&#39;re right, never think about <br/>
&gt; anything anyone says, and either stay here, huffy, or go off in a huff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You never do that. I&#39;m impressed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I want to second what Kathryn said here. You ARE very open minded to take all <br/>
of our advice and think it through instead of taking it personally.  <br/>
Sometimes when your ideas and beliefs are torn apart it feels like it&#39;s about you, but <br/>
it really isn&#39;t.<br/>
I think it&#39;s awesome how you sift through all of it!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Newbies would probably just think we weren&#39;t talking about learning, though, <br/>
that we were talking about food.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a while for people to deschool enough to see that learning about <br/>
tasting foods and saying thank you is just like learning about multiplication or <br/>
the kings of England.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a pretty advanced unschooling concept.<br/>
