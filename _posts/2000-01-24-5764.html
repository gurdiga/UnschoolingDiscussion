I do keep a journal sporadically, and I try to get quiet <br/>
and pray in the morning, but often worry crowds out these<br/>

about my husband teaching the kids about the recent eclipse,<br/>

I would encourage Beth(new to list and unschooling) to go back<br/>

in knowing unschooling offers the best for my kids.Thanks all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053472372">Wise words, Teresa. I have found that writing down just why we have chosen<br/>
this path is helpful during the rocky times.  And when I get anxious, my dh<br/>
is often the one to tell me to relax, we&#39;re all doing a great job, the kids<br/>
are great etc.  I think that John Anderson posted the quote from Rudyard<br/>
Kipling--one worth repeating, I think:<br/>
 &quot;The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed<br/>
by the tribe. To be your own man is hard business. If you try it, you will<br/>
be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay<br/>
for the privilege of owning yourself.&quot;<br/>
