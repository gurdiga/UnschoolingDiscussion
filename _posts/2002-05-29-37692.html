&gt; watching the same movies to point out the errors in how the<br/>
&gt; scenes were shot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>So are you saying that the child who suffered through a tramatic event (WTC, <br/>
for example---or bad auto crash) shouldn&#39;t be allowed to watch certain <br/>
things? <br/>
<br/>
When Cameron was in kindergarten, his best friend, also five, was killed in a <br/>
bus crash. There were more than a dozen other children injured in that bus <br/>
too. The school had therapists galore to help the children and parents deal <br/>
with this loss.<br/>
<br/>
Several weeks later, the most popular &quot;game/activity&quot; that the children <br/>
initiated was &quot;Car Crash&quot;. They would line chairs up with an aisle in <br/>
between. Someone would be the driver; several children &quot;played&quot; themselves. <br/>
Many wanted to be Jacob (the child that died). A &quot;semi&quot; would hit the side of <br/>
the &quot;bus&quot;, and all the children would fly across the room. The older children <br/>
&quot;directed&quot; the action. After the &quot;crash&quot;, they&#39;d set the chairs back up and <br/>
do it all over again. This went on for more than two months.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron wasn&#39;t on the bus, so he wasn&#39;t involved with these crashes---he just <br/>
watched. He DID have many, many questions about death and dying and the <br/>
&quot;thereafter&quot;---a whole &#39;nother thread.  <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m guessing those children that were on the bus probably *needed* some <br/>
kind of  (light) violence in their lives at that time. Maybe it would have <br/>
been beneficial for them to see a movie where the actors did get back up. <br/>
They watched a friend---a FIVE year old--- NOT get up. I think some of it is <br/>
therapeutic in an odd sort of way that I don&#39;t know I&#39;m explaining well.<br/>
<br/>
Just because YOU think it might be a bad idea to let them watch it, doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean the child might not NEED it.<br/>

This happened, then this, then my friend died, the rest of us are still here <br/>
and okay. I feel bad my friend is dead, why didn&#39;t I die? Survivors guilt and <br/>
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder are difficult to deal with. <br/>
Sometimes children, adults too, can&#39;t articulate how they feel about events <br/>
in their lives. I know if something happens in my life, my friends and I <br/>
might rehash it over and over trying to make some sort of sense out of the <br/>
trauma. We might keep going over something to *make it right* in our minds. <br/>
If children, especially very young children can&#39;t *rehash* verbally with each <br/>
other, they very well might benefit from acting the events out. Although I <br/>
doubt they *needed* some light violence at that time, I think it was more <br/>
them trying to sort everything out, to set things right. <br/>
