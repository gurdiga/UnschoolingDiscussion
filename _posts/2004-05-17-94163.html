<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255033697">My parents were kind and would never have said such things to us. They <br/>
also never spanked us and the worst punishment we ever got was being <br/>
told to go into our room until we calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
But, thinking about the neighborhood where I grew up, I can very <br/>
quickly name off a number of parents who said these kinds of things <br/>
regularly to their kids. I was a very sensitive kid and I was sometimes <br/>
in agony worrying they&#39;d say something mean directly to me. When Sandra <br/>
talks about her mother, I always picture our next-door neighbor who <br/>
used all those same phrases on her kids. There was also a neighbor man <br/>
who had mounted a belt above a hall doorway and he&#39;d point to it and <br/>
everybody in the family would go silent. It really creeped my sister <br/>
and me out a lot. There were a number of other parents who seemed <br/>
&quot;mean&quot; to me and my sisters. We were scared of quite a few of them.<br/>

my writer&#39;s group.  So might such and upbringing create unschoolers <br/>

more maltreatment across the board going on than any of us realize? <br/>
<br/>
My experience growing up would qualify more under the horrifying <br/>
category. :)  So I write (not just the cheesy articles, but dark <br/>
fiction that as yet has been unpublished - I&#39;ve been ambivalent <br/>
about exposing that side of myself, frankly) and I unschool... and <br/>
try for all the world to make sure my kids know how worthwhile and <br/>
wonderful they are.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been realizing that there are just a lot more people in this <br/>
world who came from dysfunctional or emotionally abusive families <br/>
than I ever would have imagined.  Not just on this list, but <br/>
everywhere.  <br/>
<br/>
I think one difference is that on this list, people tend to recognize <br/>
what the not so good parts about their childhoods were, realize that <br/>
they weren&#39;t right or normal, and determine to not pass them on to <br/>
their kids.  Maybe the awareness comes from mindful parenting.  I&#39;m <br/>
not sure if you have to be more aware in order to get unschooling, or <br/>
if being more aware leads you to unschooling.  A little of both <br/>
maybe.  I think it&#39;s really sad when people treat their children <br/>
poorly just because that&#39;s what was done to them.  They never <br/>
realized that there was anything wrong with it when it was done to <br/>
them, so they continue the behavior because that&#39;s what they think is <br/>
normal.  <br/>

<br/>
Not me either.  My childhood was pretty typical with school, bedtimes,<br/>
finish your plate, and do what you&#39;re told but no spanking (maybe one or two<br/>
swats in frustration that I can remember).  I remember it happily with lots<br/>
of summers spent swimming in our pool, quite a few family vacations, and<br/>
being actively involved in dancing for all my childhood.  And I was<br/>
definitely a &quot;good&quot; student.<br/>

  ****It is definitely a big reason why we chose this life. I grew up very angry and rebellious, broken home, step parents, verbal abuse and step father punched me and I ran away, lots of stuff. We chose to have me stay home and be here with the kids, we chose home ed before we had kids. We naturally followed a path to unschooling about 2 years ago. I just usually read and absorb on lots of these lists.<br/>

over, anticipating the new school year. BUT - I can&#39;t really think <br/>
clearly about it. We didn&#39;t have a choice. I never even considered the <br/>

I certainly do remember watching the clock and waiting for those last <br/>
minutes of the day to click off and feeling like I was just exploding <br/>
into the freedom of &quot;after school.&quot; Every day! I never regretted the <br/>
school day ending, that&#39;s for sure. So in spite of the fact that I <br/>
remember thinking I liked school, I think I was simply a positive <br/>
optimistic kind of kid who bloomed where she was planted.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I Don&#39;t think my childhood was dysfunctional, though it was fairly unusual.<br/>
and I think it had a lot to do with what led me to unschooling. My mom<br/>
worked in Education - teaching, college admissions, then school<br/>
administration. We moved a LOT when I was growing up so I had the<br/>
opportunity to attend a lot of different kinds of schools - large, small,<br/>
public, private, even boarding school. I learned quickly that schools were<br/>
just a game to be played and they just had different rules. I abandoned the<br/>
myth of the &#39;good school&#39;. I mastered the rules and even used them to skip 2<br/>
grades and graduate at 16 (I wanted OUT). I was also in the habit of missing<br/>
about 30 days of school every semester. My mom let me stay home almost any<br/>
time I wanted, and she would also pull me out to take me on business trips<br/>
with her whenever she could, because she felt I&#39;d get a lot more out of it<br/>
than the school was offering me. My mom would even have done my homework for<br/>
me if I had let her (pretty funny for someone who later became a school<br/>
principal). My mom would have been a perfect unschooling mom, but she never<br/>
realized it.  I was treated with a lot of respect and given a lot of freedom<br/>
and responsibility. I think it was the taste of freedom and adventure I had<br/>
growing up that lead me to seek it out more for my kids - I wanted them to<br/>
have the complete experience - that for me, was only hinted at.</div>

I wanted to be a teacher and I did that, and from that I saw LOTS of familes, <br/>
worse than mine.  I saw how a child who&#39;s had a REALLY crappy overnight at <br/>

Not that I know of.  It seems the proporion of dysfunctional people is about <br/>

<br/>
Oh no, that&#39;s not horrendous.   Horrendous is two alcoholic parents, not just <br/>
one.  Violence between parents, which I never had.  Incest or other sexual <br/>
abuse, which I never had.  Being forced to lie to cover family crap, which I <br/>
never had.<br/>
<br/>

Good point.<br/>
<br/>
There are people in ear shot of our house who were raised badly and are <br/>
passing it right along, phrases verbatim, hateful screaming and shaming that the <br/>
neighbors can hear.  Our house is trying to NOT pass on those same kinds of <br/>
behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
At Keith&#39;s house it was all very quiet.  His mother&#39;s meanness was more <br/>
likely to be silence or a snort than a phrase.  Similarly cruel, just not as <br/>

Right. &quot;And *I* turned out just fine&quot; seems to be the mantra.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****************<br/>
<br/>
       DD14 just told me about a conversation along these lines.<br/>
<br/>
       She performed in a recital/musical theatre revue on Saturday. It <br/>
involved all ages, but her own peer group within the &quot;company&quot; is six or seven <br/>
girls and a couple of boys, age 13-16 or so. (A couple are homeschooled, none is <br/>
unschooled except DD, but a few others do have thoughtful, mindful parents.) <br/>
They&#39;d been together in the theatre almost around the clock, what with dress <br/>
rehearsal and an earlier show that day, and they were cooling their heels in the <br/>
wings in costume, before the first number of the second show. <br/>
<br/>
       As DD tells it, someone mentioned what a brat one of the youngest <br/>
dancers was, what a pain, why didn&#39;t her parents make her behave better, be <br/>
quieter and less of a prima donna.  DD helps work with the younger ones and knows <br/>
them pretty well, so she said oh, no, really they&#39;re all great kids. <br/>
<br/>
       Several of the others turned on her and said not this one, this one <br/>
needs lots more discipline, her parents spank her but apparently not hard enough <br/>
or often enough (shocking the few who it seems, like DD, had never been <br/>
spanked or slapped or even given a &quot;time-out.&quot;.) <br/>
<br/>
       One of these girls suggested maybe all the spanking and swatting could <br/>
be part of the problem rather than the answer, to a chorus of angry denial <br/>
from those who grew up being hit by their parents. They started telling stories <br/>
to show being spanked was necessary to being raised right, saying &quot;DUH - <br/>
that&#39;s why they call it *discipline*!&quot; and that it had made them moral and <br/>
well-behaved -- if ganging up to make mean remarks about some smaller child in your <br/>
circle can be considered moral or well-behaved &lt;grrr&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       What was really interesting though, and the reason I bring it up now, <br/>
is that DD said she realized at that point there was nothing to say. At least <br/>
there was nothing anyone who&#39;d never been hit or punished could say. Her few <br/>
gently parented peers there just seemed to sense that anything they said would <br/>
sound like a put-down of someone else&#39;s parents. And that it wouldn&#39;t help <br/>
anybody, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
       Here is the Power of Story I see in this. By the teen years, being <br/>
spanked and smacked becomes something its victims must either internalize and <br/>
defend, or break from their family&#39;s teachings to reject (two really poor life <br/>
choices for a young teen, imo). But NOT being smacked and spanked seems by the <br/>
teen years to foster a natural, internal kind of moral, well-behaved <br/>
sensitivity (one that even the girls themselves weren&#39;t conscious of). <br/>
<br/>
       These lovely, thoughtful, beautifully mannered, compassionate and <br/>
happy girls were just sad and felt sorry about what others had been taught to <br/>
believe, and so today I&#39;m thinking of this as one of the first world windows <br/>
through which DD and her similarly parented peers are seeing for themselves the <br/>
logical results of how humans treat each other --  and DD and I both are <br/>
despairing  of how to ever share this with those who&#39;ve had other sensibilities beaten <br/>
into (or out of) them. JJ<br/>

<br/>
When I was a teenager and in college, I defended my mom&#39;s spanking of my baby <br/>
brother, figuring that he wouldn&#39;t remember and so she could train him so <br/>
that when he was older she would never need to spank him.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t take too long for me to change my mind, but I remember I defended <br/>
that position IN WRITING, in a journal for a professor to read, and I have it <br/>
somewhere.  And the professor didn&#39;t say &quot;Are you nuts?&quot; to me.  Maybe <br/>
should&#39;ve. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I got over defending my mom.  But even then I could tell it was a <br/>
justification or a soothing of my own life.  I was explaining why MY life was as <br/>
it was, and I wasn&#39;t prepared mentally or emotionally to start deconstructing <br/>
it to look carefully.    Some people never want to be.   Or maybe they don&#39;t <br/>
have that intrapersonal thing Gardner talks about and so no interest, no <br/>
wish/ability (wishability! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565853496">I think that everybody probably knows way more people who had crappy <br/>
childhoods than they realize. Most people don&#39;t go around telling other people about <br/>
their childhood traumas unless there&#39;s a good reason to share, for instance <br/>
parents trying to figure out how to make their children&#39;s lives better. So it <br/>
stands to reason you hear more about this on unschooling lists, and parenting <br/>
lists, (and even on writers lists where folks are getting in touch with their <br/>
inner selves).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that more unschoolers came from dysfunctional families, it&#39;s that <br/>
the conversations unschoolers have about children and respect allow those who <br/>
did have crappy childhoods to talk about them and encourage others and <br/>
themselves to consider how not to mess up their childrens lives without thought.<br/>

I think it&#39;s much LESS common on this list than in real life.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Sadly, I also think this is true.  We recently had a spammer get past<br/>
the moderators on the positive discipline list I am on.  He invited us<br/>
to a yahoo group that he had set up that was basically a forum for<br/>
discussing a disturbing fetish involving children.  I checked out his<br/>
group, and the scary thing was that there were over 300 members already,<br/>
and it was a new group! And the moderators said that they get at least<br/>
one of these every month (because the word &quot;discipline&quot; is in the name<br/>
of the group). Then you look at some of those daytime talk shows, or<br/>
watch the news, and you can&#39;t help but think that there are a LOT of<br/>
messed up people out there, and few people are able to rise above the<br/>
continuing cycle of abuse and neglect, for whatever reason.  I even have<br/>
a friend who uses all the attachment parenting practices with her babies<br/>
and seems very progressive in her parenting philosophy, but who stunned<br/>
me the other day by saying that she thinks that spanking is necessary<br/>
sometimes.  <br/>
 <br/>
I actually don&#39;t know ANYONE in real life who I would feel comfortable<br/>
appointing as a guardian for my kids if anything were to happen to Chris<br/>
and me(a dilemma that has been bugging me lately).  None of my friends<br/>
or family members really &quot;get&quot; the way we are trying to raise our kids,<br/>
although they do support my efforts.  Not that they all had horrendous<br/>
childhoods, but they were raised with a system of punishments and<br/>
rewards, some were spanked, some were emotionally abused, they all went<br/>
to school, and very few of them seem to be open to alternatives to the<br/>
above.  <br/>
 <br/>
OK, so before you all get the impression that I am always this gloomy, I<br/>
also want to say how totally mind-blowing and inspiring I am finding<br/>
this list!  Last night as I did the dishes my mind was racing as I<br/>
thought about several of the recent topics.  I just love it when I think<br/>
I know it all and then I find out that so very much more is out there.<br/>
You all are amazing!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Gotta go, my son needs me...<br/>

All this talk about parents demeaning their children makes me wonder if many <br/>
people move to unschooling and respectful parenting as a reaction against <br/>
abuses they received as a child.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if a disproportionate number of unschoolers come from dysfunctional <br/>
childhoods.<br/>
<br/>
The childhoods many people describe on this list are horrendous....I just <br/>
can&#39;t imagine the &quot;Miss Aster&quot; stuff....and I&#39;m very sad that anyone had to go <br/>
through that.<br/>
<br/>
But it seems much more common on this list than in real life....or at least <br/>
my real life.  Any thoughts?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My parents spanked. A lot. It&#39;s still *my* first reaction when extremely <br/>
stressed. It takes everything I have sometimes not to strike out. Just the way I <br/>
was brought up. I was hit with hands, belts, switches, hairbrushes---probably <br/>
other things I can&#39;t quite recall. Cameron was spanked a little. Duncan, not at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
I was eleven before I knew someone who was NOT spanked! Really. Just the way <br/>
things were/are here. I was floored when I learned that she hadn&#39;t been <br/>
spanked. And SHE turned out just fine too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I wasn&#39;t shamed, that I remember. I was always told that I was <br/>
loved----and frequently. I was also told I was beautiful, smart, and that I could be/do <br/>
anything I wanted. I was given everything I asked for---within reason ( I <br/>
never got that black Arabian stallion! &lt;g&gt;). Sometimes I had to wait, though. My <br/>
father would go without in order to make sure Johnny and I had everything we <br/>
needed/wanted. I honestly can&#39;t remember being told &quot;no&quot; by my father.<br/>
<br/>
I was always held to higher expectations. I was fine in school. Liked it <br/>
mostly, though I had no options. Homeschooling was illegal here in SC until 1985 <br/>
(and I was married by then!).<br/>
<br/>
I know of a few families that were kinder, gentler than mine and a whole lot <br/>
of families that were meaner. Ben&#39;s family comes to mind. They&#39;re just MEAN!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39309640">Is seems likely that the people who question norms enough to consider<br/>
unschooling have spent a considerable amount of time reflecting on other<br/>
societal norms like mainstream parenting.  I think these people are just<br/>
more likely to understand that the way they were parented affects their<br/>
adult lives because they&#39;ve spent more time thinking about it.  <br/>
 <br/>
Most of the people I know in real life were parented the way most mainstream<br/>
parents parent.  They were shamed (at least to some degree), made to follow<br/>
rules blindly (because I said so), and talked down to because they were only<br/>
children.  Most were spanked and dealt self- defeating comments of a regular<br/>
basis.  <br/>
 <br/>
I know that my own parents, although not perfect parents, did better than<br/>
their own parents.  I, in turn, have already improved upon their parenting<br/>
and I hope my own children improve upon my parenting.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think that more unschoolers come from dysfunctional homes.  I agree<br/>
with Deborah, I think they are just more aware of it and more willing to<br/>
talk about it in order to improve upon their own lives and the lives of<br/>
their children.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But I wasn&#39;t shamed, that I remember.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, I got that, big time. After a while, I refused to play the shame <br/>
game-like the time my mother came down to my track practice and tried to goad me into <br/>
running faster by &quot;out running&quot; me (and she was quite a bit older and quite <br/>
fat). I just kept joggin along at my pace, even though all the other girls were <br/>
yelling for me to &quot;run! beat her!&quot;-because I was damned if I was going to let <br/>
her win-which was what would have happened if I had let her goad me into <br/>
playing her game. That was her way of &quot;controlling&quot; me whenever there was someone <br/>
around to shame me in front of. Otherwise, she just beat me. I think that&#39;s <br/>
why I don&#39;t embarrass, now. I was completely humiliated as a kid and a teen <br/>
(puberty was a horror), so not much can bother me, now-except my own dumb <br/>
mistakes! LOL It also affects the way I parent. I go out of my way to make sure I <br/>
don&#39;t humiliate him in public-well, anywhere. Which would be easy to do with <br/>
probably any other kid, since I&#39;m such a goof! LOL But he&#39;s so much like me, that <br/>
really isn&#39;t an issue, much.<br/>
I was also told I was beautiful, smart, and that I could be/do <br/>
anything I wanted.<br/>
I got called fat (I wasn&#39;t-but the power of a mother&#39;s words convinced me I <br/>
was), and got those &quot;backhanded&quot; compliments: you have such a pretty face-if <br/>
only you&#39;d lose weight! Got told I could never be ____ (such as a vet) because <br/>
_____ (I could NEVER get good enough grades-even though I was SMART enough to <br/>
get them-I was just LAZY)... but that just helps to influence my parenting. <br/>
Unfortunately, when I&#39;m upset or frustrated, sometimes my mother&#39;s parenting <br/>
surfaces. I hate that. It doesn&#39;t happen often, and so far, it hasn&#39;t been &quot;the <br/>
worst&quot; of it-and it gets better as time goes by and I make my own way. I think <br/>
that is my greatest fear-is becoming my mother. (as a parent.) That&#39;s one of <br/>
the reasons I like this group so much! I get positive reinforcement for that <br/>
good, gentle, supportive parenting that I am aiming for and working at! :~)<br/>

<h4>Sylvia Toyama</h4>
<p><small><time>19 May 2004, at  9:34am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361556148">A quick intro first -- I&#39;m Sylvia, an unschooling Mom to 3 boys (one grown & gone), living in Albuquerque, with my husband Gary and our two younger boys.  Andy&#39;s almost 8, and Dan is 3.  <br/>
 <br/>
I grew up in a house where my parents spanked, grounded, confiscated stuff, and the like -- but that was pretty much the way everyone I know was raised to some degree.  I don&#39;t know anyone who was never spanked.  I was also told often (by my Mom) that I was loved, beautiful, smart, and so on, and wasn&#39;t really shamed.  Never heard it from my Dad, but I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s incapable of actually feeling love in the way I do (he&#39;s just way too damaged), so I&#39;ve been able to move past that. Sure, our house was dysfunctional, but I knew lots of kids whose homes were much worse than mine -- kids in foster care because their parents abused them horribly, kids still in a home where Dad got drunk and beat everyone in sight.  Some of them turned out okay, some not so okay.<br/>
 <br/>
Looking back, I know my Mom did a better job than her parents did.  Even my Dad did a better job (he was actually tied to chairs as a young child to make him behave!).  I&#39;ve improved on that -- even my siblings who still spank and ground, have improved on our parents&#39; methods.  <br/>
 <br/>
Like Jenny, one thing that really troubles me is that we don&#39;t have anyone in our family who could be trusted to raise our kids should something happen to us.  The inlaws aren&#39;t abusive, but guilt and shame are their favorite parenting tools, and everyone is very school-oriented.  I&#39;ve actually thought I&#39;d choose my oldest son -- even with the usual challenges of being 19 -- to raise his brothers before anyone else.  Being a firstborn myself, I shudder to think of asking him to ever take on such a responsibility.   He&#39;s enough like me to want better for the boys, just way too young to have to do it.  I guess I&#39;ll just hold to my conviction that we&#39;ll both be just fine.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t know anyone who didn&#39;t have a dysfunctional childhood when I was a kid (it was the 70&#39;s after all) and no one I knew then unschools, or even homeschools.<br/>

I agree.  I&#39;ve instructed my daughter to get online to my unschooling <br/>
message boards and request a new family should something happen to <br/>
me.  There is no one in my family now that would want her even for <br/>
overnight, never mind the rest of her life.  She has Aspberger&#39;s and <br/>
could never make it in school.  My family just thinks she&#39;s spoiled.  <br/>
Also, she&#39;s had the taste of freedom.  I doubt she would be capable <br/>
of giving that mindset up to go along with the flow of school.<br/>

<br/>
me.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have thought that too.  Fantasy/daydream kind of way, like.... &quot;Hmmmm.  <br/>
Maybe the Sorooshians could take Holly, and Marty could move in with Anne for a <br/>
while; he&#39;s nearly grown... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had someone chosen before I knew I was pregnant with Holly, but now I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t like that deal anymore.   We had paperwork, too.  But since then he <br/>
married and has two younger kids, and his wife has a master&#39;s in early childhood Ed <br/>
(one of the rush-jobs the NEA is pushing through so they can get stats on how <br/>
many unemployed MAs there are and how the government NEEDS to have public <br/>
school for toddlers).  They spank, too.  Blah.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s Wendy, who lived here a while and would have kept them, but <br/>
she&#39;s moved to Denver with a girlfriend, and so it wouldn&#39;t quite work.  They&#39;re <br/>
buying a house there.   But for a while they were our backup plan.  They would <br/>
come and live here and let things procede as usual until the kids were grown <br/>
or got other plans, and then help them divie up assets.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby will turn 18 this summer.  He would be fine.  He could probably help <br/>
take care of the other two, or the three of them could agree on an adult someone <br/>
to live in the house with them and be guardian.  <br/>
<br/>
The courts would turn to my sister or Keith&#39;s parents.  Keith&#39;s parents are <br/>
too old and the kids wouldn&#39;t want to live with them anyway.  My sister would <br/>
flutter around panic-like and ask the kids what they wanted to do, and help <br/>
them do it.<br/>
<br/>
I should talk to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
The one panicky thing I personally have is having too many of my kids in one <br/>
automobile on road trips.  We went on a family trip, all five, with Kirby and <br/>
Marty doing some of the driving.  I had to breathe deeply and think other <br/>
thoughts sometimes not to have visions of wondering whether a flaming rollover <br/>
would take some of us out, cripple some physically, cripple survivors mentally to <br/>
the point they couldn&#39;t take care of the surviving cripples.  Bad, bad <br/>
visions.    Too many of us in one car at once.<br/>
<br/>
Though it wasn&#39;t a homeschooling situation, I  married a friend of mine when <br/>
I was 21 so that his 10 and 7 year old siblings wouldn&#39;t be taken away.  Their <br/>
dad died and less than three years later their mom died.  The brother (#2 of <br/>
6 siblings) who had already been taking care of them even when she was living <br/>
was 23 and the only thing keeping the courts from approving him as guardian <br/>
was that he was unmarried.  So I married him.  <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;ranking&quot; relatives on both sides of the family had to agree to Jimbo <br/>
being guardian.  They were glad to.  The state required that we both be bonded <br/>
for three  years, because of the money management involved.  We were physical <br/>
guardians (as a couple), an uncle was financial guardian.<br/>
<br/>
So of all the weird reasons to get married, I got married to help babysit.  <br/>
<br/>
It lasted three years and some, and I learned some things that help me now.  <br/>
I could&#39;ve done better, as a foster mother, but I did better than either <br/>
alternative family would&#39;ve done.  I did better with the girl than the boy (younger <br/>
kid) who, poor guy, was traumatized.  We went with the therapist his <br/>
financial-guardian uncle had chosen, and I regret that.  The guy was a long-term <br/>
Freudian guy.  We did every other session Andy and the others another family member <br/>
or combo.  He gave us a few pieces of useful advice, but mostly it was TOO <br/>
slow to do us any practical good.  We needed something QUICK and helpful and <br/>
useful.  Now &quot;how do you feel when&quot; but &quot;here&#39;s what might help between now and <br/>
next week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then for a while my mom and brother lived there.  She went away and left him <br/>
with us for most of a year.  He was 4 and 5 in those days.  So I was 21-24 and <br/>
had two and three kids for a few years (without the benefit of personal <br/>
childbirth experience), and was teaching Jr. High the whole time.  Trial by fire. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t talk about that much.  It&#39;s so complicated, and I have wishes for <br/>
having done some things better.  Other things were great.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the house and the relatives of the story of the little girl raised <br/>
without sugar who took a sack of sugar into the garden, squatted between rows of <br/>
vegetables and was eating sugar out of the bag with both hands as fast as she <br/>
could before she got caught.<br/>
