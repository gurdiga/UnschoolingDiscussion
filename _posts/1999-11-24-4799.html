<br/>
Can you tell me more about the master&#39;s program in educational alternatives.  Sounds<br/>
like something I would like to pursue!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I have been lurking for a while, and this email made me brave enough to<br/>
introduce myself.  My name is Erin.  I am relatively new to unschooling and have<br/>
been searching the web for everything I can find in relation to this.  We have been<br/>
homeschooling our children for five years, with various success, but normally I<br/>
would last about til November with a curriculum and then just do bits and pieces<br/>
through the rest of the year.  We usually just kept up the reading, writing,<br/>
arithmetic.  But, I am now empowered and have determine not to even keep up with the<br/>
math (which was my hardest battle, internally of course).  Both children love to<br/>
read, and they are definitely more educated than I was at their ages. (They are 11yo<br/>
ds, 10yo dd).  My son hates to write, and hates math, but I am hoping this will<br/>
change without my pressure.<br/>
<br/>
I have appreciated the list so much, thanks for all of your input!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Sort of puts it all in perspective doesn&#39;t it?  Most folks though, have<br/>
trouble remembering what it was like to be a child at various ages, let<br/>
alone how educated they actually were (not to be confused with remembering<br/>
how much they thought they knew at the time.)  I am one of those people who<br/>
has TOO vivid a memory, and often remember things I don&#39;t want to.  As a<br/>
result, I decided to homeschool long before I ever had children, just<br/>
because I remember how much I hated school and am not going to do that to<br/>
my own kids.  Regardless of where you live and what the schools are like,<br/>
David id right, there are those key elements that never go away.  It is the<br/>
nature of the IS system to keep kids helpless, voiceless, passive,<br/>
receptacles.  The old common image of the children as empty cups for the<br/>
teacher to fill.<br/>
<br/>
This of course does not give the children credit for even being people and<br/>
having anything important to share or add, even to their own education.<br/>
It&#39;s the same old addage about children being seen (looking cute) and not<br/>
heard, being unformed, incomplete people who are usually not worthy company<br/>
for us lofty adults, and aren&#39;t we all grateful to, and in awe of teachers,<br/>
who CHOOSE to associate with hordes of the little monsters every day and<br/>
make it their life&#39;s work?<br/>
<br/>
I for one have a great deal of respect for children, for what they know and<br/>
for their feelings.  I don&#39;t like jokes at children&#39;s expense either.  Some<br/>
people call it teasing, but if it is something you would not do to an<br/>
adult, than it is an abuse of power.  It is our job to protect and guide<br/>
children, not mislead and make fools of them.  I remember what it felt like<br/>
to be made fun of by an adult, and it was awful and humiliating.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the trouble with our culture, we forget what it was like to be<br/>
a child and so perpetuate behaviors that are unhealthy.  What do you all<br/>
think?<br/>

   Hi Erin,<br/>
   <br/>
    Welcome!  I can relate to this because we used to do it this way, too.  <br/>
We were unschooling most of the year before but the difference is that now we <br/>
embrace it instead of feeling vaguely guilty about it!  <br/>

<br/>
   So true, Nanci.  I always wonder how any adult can say they don&#39;t like <br/>
kids; it&#39;s like saying they don&#39;t like humans or themselves.  A lot of adults <br/>
seem to want kids to behave like miniature adults.  Even those who remember <br/>
their childhoods don&#39;t always apply it to the kids now.  They&#39;ll tell stories <br/>
about things they did or adults who they thought were mean and then get mad <br/>
at a kid for doing something very similar to what they did AND end up acting <br/>
very similar to the adult in their story whom they disliked as a kid.  <br/>
    Too often we don&#39;t see kids as full human beings.  We focus too much on <br/>
how they affect us at any given moment.  Of course, we do that with adults, <br/>
too, but kids have far less power than adults so they&#39;re much more apt to be <br/>
victimized by this.  When we deal with a particular kid, maybe we need to <br/>
focus on remembering how we felt at that age, what we were like, and then <br/>
keep relating it back to that kid.  <br/>
    I remember when I was a kid, there were certain adults who I found it <br/>
impossible to ever envision them being young.  It wasn&#39;t because of their <br/>
age.  My grandmother looked plenty old to me but when I listened to her <br/>
stories or played games with her, it was easy to imagine her young.  But <br/>
there were some people who seemed so mean, so lacking in any sense of humor, <br/>
so rule oriented, that it seemed like they must have been born that way.  I <br/>
remember those feelings a lot and when I do, I always think, &quot;Ugh!  I hope <br/>
I&#39;m not being that way now!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It amazes me that a teacher would rather spend the day with 20-30 other<br/>
children than to stay home with their own.  OTH, they don&#39;t have to<br/>
connect emotionally with the students.  If a student doesn&#39;t do well,<br/>
isn&#39;t it usually because &quot;their parents aren&#39;t involved enough in their<br/>
education&quot;?   They manage to put the blame elsewhere.<br/>

I was raised with a lot of sarcasm, and sometimes find myself using it. <br/>
I really have to work on that.<br/>
