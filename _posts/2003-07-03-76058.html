<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070304134">This reminds me:<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows an inventor or has a darling inventor (di?) in the family, those late night invention submission/marketing comapnies are a scam.  The USA FTC took them on and it&#39;s illegal there.<br/>
<br/>
Here in Canada, the goberment is staying with &quot;buyer beware.&quot;  Not illegal, because they do give you something - it&#39;s just Grade A1 useless information.<br/>
<br/>
Having worked with inventors who dumped $15,000 (i.e. all their retirement money) into these people, I love to tell anyone who will listen.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening and spread the word on these predators!<br/>
