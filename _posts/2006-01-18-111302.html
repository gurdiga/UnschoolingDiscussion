<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453108697">My daughter keeps saying she wants to go back to school, she misses her <br/>
school girlfriends and is still unhappy with the lack of homeschool girlfriends <br/>
her age she had made. I cannot keep up with her social needs even though <br/>
we do have playgroup twice a week and playdates another 1-2 times a week! <br/>
I am considering giving into her and letting her try it again in the fall, although <br/>
it feels ridiculous for her to be in and out and in and out of school! (she went in <br/>
K and 2nd) I would still homeschool my son, so I&#39;d have to deal with the early <br/>
mornings and the homework and the PTA and all the other stuff I hated about <br/>
school, but I&#39;d also have one at home, so I wouldn&#39;t have the advantage of <br/>
time to persue my interests. It doesn&#39;t feel good to me, but I don&#39;t want to insist <br/>
that she stay at home!<br/>
I need two things, one is to ask if anyone has had the experience of your child <br/>
wanting to go to school and you telling them no, they can&#39;t? How did that work <br/>
for you? I am considering it but it doesn&#39;t follow my phiolosophy of &quot;child-led <br/>
learning&quot; at all!<br/>
The second is that I have told her that if she wants to go back to school she <br/>
needs to catch up in reading and writing (her math is fine!). Is there a web site <br/>
where I can get worksheets for 5th grade level writing and a list of 5th grade <br/>
level reading so she can get an idea of what she will be expected to do so <br/>
she can go into this either prepared from spending the next 6 months studying <br/>
hard or she can realize that school is not as understanding as I am about <br/>
letting her learn at her own pace (unschooling/child-led learning) I&#39;m not <br/>
really trying to scare her into giving up the idea of school, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>
go to all the trouble of getting her back into school for her to then realize how <br/>
good she has it at home and ask to homeschool again! I&#39;m tired of the back <br/>
and forth!!!<br/>
Also is there anything else like social scinces, sciences, etc... that you all think <br/>
she should definately know by now that she might still be scetchy on that I <br/>
need to insist she learns before she goes to school? Like do they have to <br/>
have memorized the names of the 50 states or names of presidents or <br/>
anything like that?<br/>
I love the idea of child-led learning, but the whole concept I believe is <br/>
contigent on long term homeschooling, not going back and forth in and out of <br/>
school! Am I wrong? <br/>
Thanks for any help!<br/>

<br/>
Really?  If I had to do this with my kid, I would be rooting for him to <br/>
come home soon and find a different way to meet his social needs.<br/>
<br/>
I support supporting her urge to go to school, but I don&#39;t support the <br/>
idea that if she chooses school she HAS to stay.  Why?  You want her to <br/>
be serious, goal-oriented and stoic at a young age?  Is that it, or is <br/>
it something else?<br/>
<br/>
I understand some of the inconveniences that school will impose on your <br/>
family.  But I hope you will relax and let stuff happen without being <br/>
really attached to one outcome or the other.  It&#39;ll be less stressful <br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Not at all.  Most of this stuff is learned about and tested about in <br/>
separate chunks.  Very little of it builds up cumulative understanding.<br/>

said she wanted to homeschool again! It&#39;s just that it&#39;s a lot of work to prepare <br/>
her for school and traumatic emotionally, I know, we&#39;ve been down that road <br/>
twice already! It&#39;s hard and I don&#39;t want to go through it again.<br/>

You don&#39;t have to prepare her.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s happened twice and is happening again, change your unschooling!<br/>
Make your life at home way more interesting than school is.<br/>
<br/>
Your first post was all about how much work it was for you and this  <br/>
one is about you too.  That&#39;s fine, but if you spent that much energy  <br/>
on what your daughter would really enjoy, what would light up her  <br/>
world, she probably wouldn&#39;t want to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Can you get out of town?  Can you get in the car and drive as far as  <br/>
you can drive, eat in an interesting little local restaurant  <br/>
somewhere and get a motel room?   Can you head for a town with a play  <br/>
or museum or something exciting and memorable to see?  Waterfalls,  <br/>
ghost towns, skiing, or a circus?   Something needs to change  <br/>
dramatically and merrily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352139262">Have you asked *HER* what possible ways she might meet more kids her <br/>
own age to do stuff with? There are usually lots of afterschool <br/>
programs in most areas. You don&#39;t actually have to be in school to <br/>
participate in those most of the time.<br/>
They typically go from 3-5 M-F and are fairly reasonably priced. That <br/>
would probably be where I&#39;d look for that kind of thing first. <br/>
Classes, if she wants that type of thing, might be good too. Art <br/>
classes, music lessons, community sports programs, even girl scouts or <br/>
something similar. That way she gets to interact with the kids she is <br/>
wanting to, follow her interests, and take responsibility for at least <br/>
part of her own social life. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter also mentions sometimes that she would like to go back to <br/>
public school.  When we get down and really talk about it we realize <br/>
that it is the fun with her friends that she misses.  We talk about <br/>
what it was like to sit in a class with 27 other students, bored out <br/>
of your mind and getting in trouble at every instance of boredom.  <br/>
When she remembers those days, then we are back on track.  I have <br/>
found a lot of resources at the YMCA.  Their membership is reasonable <br/>
and they have a lot of youth oriented programs.  I have found that if <br/>
we get to the Y at least 3 times a week with a good hour or so of <br/>
physical activity she feels much better.  It is a lot of work to make <br/>
sure they have good social contact.  To me that is the hardest part <br/>
of homeschooling.  Take a close look at your community and your <br/>
homeschooling community and make the committement to find a group <br/>
that has children her age.  It will come together.</div>
