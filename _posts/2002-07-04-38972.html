&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just looking into the UU church but the information the church sent to<br/>
&gt; me is that their roots are from pre-Constantinian Christianity.  When<br/>
&gt; Constantine declared Christianity the official religion they needed to<br/>
&gt; define it.  So the Nicene creed appeared and at this time the Trinity was<br/>
&gt; &quot;established&quot;, for lack of a better word.  Someone else may know better than<br/>
&gt; I, but this is the information I got.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Trinity goes back before the Council of Nicea (who wrote the Nicene<br/>
creed), since Jesus existed before then; and the Bible has him sending the<br/>
Holy Spirit to the disciples, and the New Testament writers also predate<br/>
Nicea.  But certainly there was a time when Jesus and the Holy Spirit were<br/>
not so closely linked with God as they have been in the Trinity.  The<br/>
Unitarians can reasonably claim that earlier time as their roots, and that<br/>
would make sense.  <br/>
<br/>
However, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that virtually all Christian churches<br/>
today accept the Trinity, and consider those who do not (like the<br/>
Unitarians) &quot;not Christian&quot;.  That isn&#39;t intended as a personal opinion, but<br/>
just an observation of how it is.  Unitarians are not constrained to accept<br/>
other churches&#39; opinions of them, of course.  The Mormons don&#39;t....they<br/>
continue to consider themselves Christian, even though other churches don&#39;t<br/>
think they are.  That&#39;s their perogative.<br/>
<br/>
And in the end, if you decide the UU church is the right place for you, what<br/>
does it matter what other churches think it is, anyhow!  :)<br/>
