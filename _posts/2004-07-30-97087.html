&lt;&lt; At first when I read your<br/>
<br/>
suggestion that I should replace the voices in my head with more helpful,<br/>
<br/>
soothing voices, I thought to myself, &quot;Yeah, OK, but I was just joking to<br/>
<br/>
illustrate my occassional state of mind.&quot;  But then I realized, that IS my<br/>
<br/>
state of mind and it&#39;s no joke!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is the crux of much of the success and the frustration on this sort of <br/>
online unschooling discussion.   It fascinates me.  I used to try to control it <br/>
more and worry if someone&#39;s feelings were hurt, and try to find them and <br/>
explain more, but the I started to think of it as a river.  This list is like a <br/>
river of information flowing all the time.  (Unschooling.com is like a lake with <br/>
infusion and evaporation, I guess. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
If we dam up a river or try to channel it, that&#39;s more work than it&#39;s worth.  <br/>
If some people come along and say &quot;I hate rivers, I want a little baggie with <br/>
a small amount of clean water and one easily-seen goldfish,&quot; they&#39;ve come to <br/>
the wrong source.<br/>

People will blurt out what they don&#39;t even know they believe sometimes.<br/>
People will reveal their deep hurts in the words they choose.<br/>
Some will deny it, some will even deny having written what we respond to.<br/>
<br/>
My least favorite (but fascinating like a train wreck &lt;bwg&gt;) is when someone <br/>
posts something like, &quot;My kids are lazy brats . . . &quot; in the midst of 300 <br/>
words, and then not notice th &#39;brats&#39;,&quot; we can EASILY be in for 300 e-mails of <br/>
them saying &quot;I love my kids unconditionally and think only the best of them, how <br/>
could you think otherwise, you meanies!?&quot; and others saying &quot;You were so MEAN <br/>
to that mom who just needed support.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But nobody held a gun to her and said &quot;Type L-A-Z-Y and call them BRATS.  NOW <br/>
HIT SEND.&quot;    Out of her own mind and fingers came the words.<br/>
<br/>
And how much worse when it&#39;s the voices of our parents, grandparents, <br/>
teachers, critics, who squeak out their little messages when we&#39;re asleep or <br/>
distracted or angry?   Those can come out too.<br/>
<br/>
So yes!  I&#39;m glad you wrot what you wrote, Andrea.  Because people&#39;s &quot;just <br/>
jokes&quot; are often not funny at the level at which they reveal fears and beliefs <br/>
that weren&#39;t in their top-100-conscious-thoughts.   <br/>
<br/>
And who, with young children, can easily HAVE 100 conscious thoughts!?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=- Can&#39;t really explain, but I was being hard<br/>
<br/>
on myself, and not taking myself seriously at the same time. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Many of the voices I have gradually captured and encapsulated in my mind were <br/>
telling me I wasn&#39;t worth taking seriously.   My granny&#39;s declaration &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
booksmart, but you just ain&#39;t got no horse sense&quot; (said in different ways at <br/>
different times).   My mother&#39;s &quot;I love you but I don&#39;t like you sometimes&quot; <br/>
(when she couldn&#39;t control me to cater to my preschool sister when I got back <br/>
from school, so that she/mom could sit and smoke cigarettes, drink beer and <br/>
listen to the radio as though she had no children at all).   <br/>
<br/>
I caught them, examined them, figured out why each individual would have <br/>
thought that was a good thing to choose to say (sometimes the explanations are <br/>
weak &lt;g&gt;), and I forgave them and turned off their tape!  Now it&#39;s just a museum <br/>
piece in my head, a reminder of what not to say to my kids.<br/>
