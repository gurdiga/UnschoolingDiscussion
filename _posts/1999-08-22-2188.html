I read this on another list and thought you guys might like to respond, too.<br/>
Please forward to other homeschoolers if you wish.<br/>

Apparently, the following was a 1/4 page comic that appeared in the<br/>
Stillwater Gazette (Stillwater, MN) last Thursday; there were no <br/>
accompanying<br/>
articles, just this comic:<br/>
<br/>
  1st frame:  (Mom sitting in chair reading a book to child on the floor)<br/>
  &quot;My mother says schools are too dangerous, so I go to school at home&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  2nd frame:  (Child standing outside, looking bored) &quot;At recess I go out<br/>
  and stand in the back yard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  3rd frame:  (Child going inside) &quot;Then I go back inside&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  4th frame:  (Mom sitting reading again) &quot;And we do more lessons&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  5th frame:  (Child looking out window) &quot;Other recess times I just stare<br/>
  out the window&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  6th frame:  ( From the outside we see child staring out the window)<br/>
  &quot;It&#39;s very safe here, away from the world.  My mother says I can have my<br/>
  childhood later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  End of comic-<br/>

The email address for the newspaper&#39;s editor is:(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:stwgztte@...">stwgztte@...</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Please take a moment to let the editor know how you feel.  I think a calm <br/>
and<br/>
reasoned response reflects better on homeschoolers as a group.<br/>
