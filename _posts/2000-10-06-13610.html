<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139683448">Hi again everyone,<br/>
<br/>
One doesn&#39;t know whether to cheer on the Japanese girl in the following <br/>
story, or weep for her. Perhaps both.<br/>
<br/>
I share the following brief article that appeared yesterday in a Japanese <br/>
newspaper not out any kind of shock value, but just to let folks know the <br/>
truth of what is happening here in Japan. I apologize in advance if <br/>
posting this particular story offends anyone&#39;s sensibilities.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I fear this kind of situation is only the tip of the <br/>
iceberg where public education in Japan is concerned. Hardly a day goes <br/>
by these days without this kind of depressing story appearing in the <br/>
Japanese media about severely traumatized schoolchildren.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing left to wonder is: How many other emotionally traumatized <br/>
Japanese schoolchildren are out there who *never* get their stories into <br/>
the papers?<br/>

Balding 12-yr.-old sues over school bullying<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TAKATSUKI, Osaka -- A 12-year-old schoolgirl has filed a 115 million yen <br/>
suit against a former classmate&#39;s parents and her school, claiming she <br/>
lost all her hair due to stress brought about by bullying.<br/>
<br/>
The bully allegedly began teasing her and pulling her hair in April 1998, <br/>
when they were fourth graders. In July of the same year, she began losing <br/>
her hair on her head -- and all of it, plus her eyebrows, came off around <br/>
November.<br/>
<br/>
Her doctor said these were symptoms of a disease called intractable <br/>
multiple alopecia areata and that it may have been caused by stress.<br/>
<br/>
Fearing further hassling, she always stayed at the nurse&#39;s office <br/>
throughout the third trimester at school. The bullying stopped when the <br/>
next school year began as the boy was sent to a different class.<br/>
<br/>
But the scars of the alleged bullying remain. Part of her hair is still <br/>
missing, and her doctor says there is a possibility it will not grow again.<br/>
