<div id="ygrps-yiv-588434286">Dear Ones,<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate that there are various points of view<br/>
here re. what may be the &quot;reality&quot; of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to address some of the specifics of this post<br/>
because they sum up some of the issues in the relating<br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t take offense, Amy.  Since we just met, ;<br/>
*)  I&#39;d hate to offend you.  <br/>
<br/>
I tend to be Direct.   Having been a victim of family<br/>
&quot;concern&quot; has lead me to be rather pro-active in<br/>
addressing this issue.<br/>

&gt;    From: Amy Thomlinson &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:diamond_h2o@...">diamond_h2o@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Subject: Re: help with responding<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do know a family around where I live that has an 8<br/>
&gt; year old boy and a 5 year old girl and the parents<br/>
&gt; &quot;homeschool&quot;, but I know that the only schooling the<br/>
&gt; kids get is from chores such as feeding the dog and<br/>
&gt; folding laundry <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***  How do you &quot;know&quot;?  Unless you move in with the<br/>
family, you have Very Limited knowledge of what goes<br/>
on in the home.  A neighbor&#39;s knowledge.  You can&#39;t<br/>
possibly know what living there is like.<br/>
<br/>
I think that household chores are a fine place to<br/>
start learning responsibility.  Unless they become<br/>
wealthy enough to hire servants, all children will be<br/>
doing chores for the rest of their lives.  This IS<br/>
real learning.<br/>
<br/>
You mention that this is the only &quot;schooling&quot; they<br/>
get.  I am an unschooler.  I don&#39;t want to provide<br/>
&quot;schooling&quot; for my children.  If you mean that that&#39;s<br/>
the only learning that is taking place, I&#39;d say that<br/>
unless the children are locked in closets that is<br/>
Impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Learning happens constantly.  That they are not<br/>
learning what you or I or anyone else thinks is<br/>
&quot;appropriate&quot; is not &quot;child abuse&quot;.   And who are you<br/>
or I or anyone else to make that Judgment in the first<br/>
place?<br/>
<br/>
I realize that some unschoolers believe that our<br/>
choice is only for the &quot;right&quot; kind of parents.  Those<br/>
with &quot;good&quot; educations, nurturing &quot;mom&quot; personas, and<br/>
enough cash to provide ample &quot;stimulation&quot; and<br/>
exposure to &quot;opportunity&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have placed  &quot; &quot;  around those words because I think<br/>
that they are all about personal judgment.  Which is<br/>
something I become less and less tolerant of the older<br/>
I get.  (How ironic is that? &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I flatly reject that point of view. <br/>
<br/>
I firmly believe that children that are physically or<br/>
emotionally abused should receive intervention as<br/>
prescribed by law.  Even child advocates will tell you<br/>
that the removal of a child from their parents is<br/>
,short of death, about the most harmful action that<br/>
can be done to a child.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s be very, very careful that we don&#39;t injure<br/>
those we aim to protect in the name of &quot;appropriate<br/>
homeschooling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Abused children need to be aided and protected and<br/>
sometimes completely removed from their parents<br/>
forever.  Yes, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
But government agencies ought to be spending their<br/>
time on enforcing the laws that protect abused<br/>
children. They oughtn&#39;t be used to interfere with a<br/>
family simply because they don&#39;t &quot;measure up&quot; to the<br/>
standards of another.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe those children have long conversations with<br/>
their parents regarding the weather, the formation of<br/>
ant hills and wasp nests, politics, dad&#39;s job, current<br/>
events, what causes the seasons to change, why the<br/>
neighbors go-go-go all the time and they don&#39;t ...<br/>
<br/>
Who knows?  Only they do.<br/>
<br/>
That they or any children are &quot;better off&quot;  confined<br/>
to a single building 180 days a year, age-segregated,<br/>
vulnerable to bullies and (often) apathetic teachers<br/>
and administrators, who will daily assess their value<br/>
with numbers and letters, monitor their every move, be<br/>
inflexible to their changing interests, require them<br/>
to ask to use the restroom, rush them through gobbling<br/>
down their lunch, arbitrarily enforce their silence<br/>
and attention, show them no individual respect and<br/>
attempt to quash their very uniqueness and mold them<br/>
into a &quot;productive citizen&quot; in accordance with<br/>
whatever the prevailing methods and systems are<br/>
currently eschewed by the head educrats   ...   is a<br/>
belief that I will never be sold on.<br/>
<br/>
It counters everything I personally know to be true:<br/>
<br/>
-Children, all humans, have innate curiosity that<br/>
flourishes in an environment of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
-Institutions are about producing products, not about<br/>
growing children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 and the parents don&#39;t incorporate<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; any<br/>
&gt; creative teaching methods into it<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Why should they?  Why should they be expected to<br/>
adapt methods that were created for an environment<br/>
they are not in?  Those methods are part of a system<br/>
that they have elected not to participate in.<br/>
<br/>
For that matter,what is creative?  Making dinner is<br/>
creative.  Painting a room and arranging furniture is<br/>
creative.  Making castles out of mud in the backyard<br/>
is creative.  Having a boat parade in your bathtub is<br/>
creative.  Coloring outside the lines is creative. <br/>
Taking information and forming a question about<br/>
potential outcomes is creative.<br/>
<br/>
A take-charge attitude is a take charge attitude.  It<br/>
may or may not assist in learning.  Manipulatives and<br/>
books and art supplies are all just that.  They may or<br/>
may not lead to forming creative thoughts and<br/>
pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
Without &quot;educational&quot; toys, children are very good at<br/>
using their fingers, verbal story telling and writing<br/>
on walls.  Creativity is virtually indestructible.  <br/>
<br/>
Inspiration is everywhere.  Adults realize the power<br/>
of Nature.  Adults pay big bucks to go do &quot;nothing&quot; in<br/>
the mountains, at the beach, on a lake.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, unless they are locked up,(as they&#39;d be in<br/>
school), all children are constantly learning.  Maybe<br/>
they are learning about the bugs in the backyard. <br/>
Maybe they are learning about what&#39;s going on in the<br/>
world as CNN plays all day, maybe they are bored and<br/>
spend hours creating stories in their minds.  When<br/>
they leave home, maybe they will become ornothologists<br/>
or investigative reporters or novelists.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Most adults hone in on one or two interests that they<br/>
spend their lives pursuing.  A home that has TV and<br/>
internet access pretty much has opened up the world<br/>
for its&#39; children.<br/>
<br/>
Are the parents not responsive to the children?  Do<br/>
they ignore their questions?  Meet them with silence.<br/>
Probably not.  If they are not ideal, are they less<br/>
caring than the foster parents they are likely to end<br/>
up with ... or the classroom teachers they&#39;ll be<br/>
shuffled among?  How much time and attention could<br/>
those children expect to receive from the alternatives<br/>
the government can provide?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  they just use the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids as little slaves. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***They beat and chain them?  Starve and demean them?<br/>
Is &quot;slaves&quot; really accurate?   Or do they make them<br/>
take out the trash, get the mail, feed the pets, fetch<br/>
dad&#39;s beers ?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they parent inconsiderately.  They are rude<br/>
obnoxious people.  Do they arbitrarily demand More<br/>
than a school would. Do they offer less care and love<br/>
than a paid stranger would?<br/>
<br/>
In judging any situation, considering the alternatives<br/>
has to be factored in.  <br/>
<br/>
Very few children are better off in the government&#39;s<br/>
care- during or after &quot;school hours&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Are some individuals more worthy of &quot;Mother of the<br/>
Year&quot; honors?  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Do some kids get a wider variety of experiences that<br/>
may lead them to more options in their learning?  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Do we, as individuals, have the right and<br/>
responsibility to provide our children with the best<br/>
that is available to us? Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean we have the right to judge and attempt<br/>
to force our particular ways and means on others we<br/>
deem &quot;less than the best&quot;  ?  No.<br/>
<br/>
Not in my view.  <br/>
<br/>
My view is that intelligent people recognize that<br/>
acknowledging and accepting diversity is an evolved<br/>
trait.<br/>
<br/>
And that compassion is more productive than<br/>
persecution.<br/>
If one is interested in the lack of experiences<br/>
offered to a child, offering to provide alternatives<br/>
is a positive action.<br/>
Whether by a grandma or neighbor.  <br/>
<br/>
If grandma is really interested in the children<br/>
learning, she could ask the parents in what way she<br/>
might assist within the family&#39;s parameter&#39;s.  Can she<br/>
pay for a zoo membership, National Geographic<br/>
subscription, movie passes, dance lessons?   Will she<br/>
babysit on a regular basis so that mom can recharge<br/>
her batteries?  A neighbor can invite the children<br/>
over to help bake cookies or make holiday cards or<br/>
play legos.  If she is really interested in the<br/>
children&#39;s best interests.<br/>
<br/>
In 11 years of homeschooling- on and off in the early<br/>
years- and after 2 years of full time substitute<br/>
teaching at a wide variety of schools k-12 in a Large<br/>
urban/suburban school system ...   I have come to the<br/>
conclusion that MOST of the time criticism is leveled<br/>
against homeschooling/unschooling parents ...  that<br/>
those making the judgments are doing so out of ego<br/>
rather than concern.<br/>
<br/>
Grandmas tend to ease away from &quot;concern&quot;  when given<br/>
the option of contributing resources to the children&#39;s<br/>
learning opportunities and neighbors/friends always<br/>
have some area of contention regarding how the other<br/>
does it &quot;wrong&quot;.  This is not particular to<br/>
homeschoolers- though we are easier  and more likely<br/>
targets. And tend to want all our cohorts to make us<br/>
look good so we don&#39;t have to defend ourselves to<br/>
outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
Granparents see homeschooling as a double rejection. <br/>
invalidating what they lived and the choice they made<br/>
for their own children.  If you are right; they must<br/>
have been wrong.  If you are doing better; they are<br/>
less-than as parents.<br/>
<br/>
It is a ridiculous dichotomy to employ. But they do<br/>
and they attempt to redeem themselves by denigrating<br/>
you. <br/>
<br/>
For those of you with parents able to utilize logic<br/>
and critical thinking skills ...  be grateful.  Some<br/>
of us have children with grandparents who are so well<br/>
indoctrinated ...  that we will forever be viewed as<br/>
&quot;neglectful&quot; due to our choice to not &quot;educate&quot; our<br/>
children.  I imagine that my mother will someday<br/>
breathe a sigh of relief that my children managed to<br/>
have such &quot;successful&quot; lives despite the poor<br/>
upbringing I gave them.  I know that the possibility<br/>
that their brightness may actually be Connected to our<br/>
lack of schooling ... is not one she will Ever<br/>
entertain. <br/>
<br/>
 The mother used to visit us<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all the time when my kids were little  but the last<br/>
&gt; time she visited my 3 year old wrote his name on the<br/>
&gt; wall  and she was embarrassed because her kids<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how to write their names yet so she hasn&#39;t been<br/>
&gt; back.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Are you sure this is why she hasn&#39;t been back? <br/>
It&#39;s hard to be embarrassed if you think the other<br/>
person isn&#39;t judging you.  Maybe she hasn&#39;t been back<br/>
because she knows what you think of her.  People tend<br/>
not to socialize with those who look down on them.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I have often thought of contacting someone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; about the situation (I know what goes on because I<br/>
&gt; live next door to this family)  but would the<br/>
&gt; consequences be worse than the problem now. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Unless you know more than you&#39;ve written here-YES.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; finally<br/>
&gt; just decided it wasn&#39;t my business and since they<br/>
&gt; stay<br/>
&gt; away from us  I don&#39;t worry about it anymore<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unless they are comitting criminal acts, it isn&#39;t your<br/>
business to contact authorities.  <br/>
<br/>
Nothing prevents you from being  compassionate,<br/>
friendly, helpful and caring toward the children.  Or<br/>
the parents.  If you so choose. <br/>
<br/>
Again,  please don&#39;t take this personally.  I have had<br/>
conversations re. homeschoolers that make choices that<br/>
I don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
There is a woman in a group that I used to be involved<br/>
with that keeps a house that would not pass a health<br/>
inspection.  Numerous pets, little care to clean-up,<br/>
etc...  IMO, it is really BAD.  In the opinions of<br/>
every other mom in my group who discussed it, it is<br/>
BAD.  Even tour children think it is BAD.  Are they<br/>
abusive?  No.  The family spends lots of money, which<br/>
they have a good supply of, on activities/lessons for<br/>
their 7 children.  The children are bright and<br/>
interesting.  But, the house is an unqualified MESS. <br/>
<br/>
Turning her into authorities for the mess was brought<br/>
up among those of us who discussed the situation.  It<br/>
was quickly eliminated as a possibility.  This is a<br/>
happy family living in a very filthy home.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have lunch there, but they are not criminals. <br/>
<br/>
Today, I wouldn&#39;t even consider that kind of<br/>
interference.  It is much easier to criticize than to<br/>
compassionately act, but why?  Who benefits? <br/>
Certainly not the children.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the critical one is Genuinely interested in<br/>
providing -welcomed-  assistance,  I find it<br/>
exceptionally easy to call a spade a spade. <br/>
He/she/they aren&#39;t doing it your way, Grandma?  So<br/>
what!  MYOB.The best advice Ann Landers ever gave.<br/>

parenting decisions we make every day.  My MIL<br/>
screamed at me when I refused to give my daughter her<br/>
first set of shots...9 years or so ago, and told me<br/>
she would be dead by the time she was two.  She has<br/>
told me that breastfeeding is only for people too<br/>
stupid to sterilize bottles.  She has told me that<br/>
wearing a baby in a sling makes one look like an<br/>
&quot;African or a poor person&quot;.  She insists on serving<br/>
meat for every meal we share with them.  If *I* am<br/>
doing what I think is right, then what she did must be<br/>
*wrong*, or at least I must think it is, and that IS<br/>
very threatening to her.  This is what I see to be the<br/>
biggest problem with explaining my choices to<br/>
people--they often times take it as a personal affront<br/>
to THEIR choices.  I am so glad to see you mention<br/>
this--it rings so true!<br/>
<br/>
I had an acquaintance come to me with questions about<br/>
homeschooling, because his 6 yo daughter was having<br/>
problems with the teacher.  I didn&#39;t see him again for<br/>
a couple of months, and when I saw him again I asked<br/>
about his daughter.  They had supposedly worked out<br/>
the problems, and wanted to know if we were still<br/>
homeschooling.  When I said yes, he got quite<br/>
outraged, saying &quot;Oh, it&#39;s good enough for MY kids,<br/>
but not for yours?  Do you think you&#39;re better than<br/>
us?&quot;  He came to ME about homeschooling, but now I was<br/>
the &quot;bad guy&quot; because he had chosed something<br/>
differnt, and he saw me &quot;judging&quot; his choice...<br/>

Oh yeah, Dana. <br/>

missed the <br/>
call on that one.<br/>

After marrying into a family where everyone nursed their babies, she<br/>

that it was OK.  Now that it&#39;s en vogue, it&#39;s a &quot;good thing&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I liked it too, but we have a neighbor&#39;s knowledge of the little girl across <br/>
the court, who cries so loudly we can hear it from our house.  When Holly <br/>
visited once, the girls were locked IN the girl&#39;s bedroom with a mean <br/>
full-grown Husky, and nobody rushed to save them.<br/>
<br/>
We only have a neighbor&#39;s knowledge of the family behind us, with the <br/>
swimming pool and the several little kids and lots of cousins and guests.  <br/>
When company&#39;s there, the kids are yelled at worse than any kids should be.  <br/>
When company&#39;s NOT there, they&#39;re full-on abusive, cussing them out and <br/>
insulting their native intelligence and honesty about the least little thing. <br/>
 The kids have been mean to Holly as she passes by.  I wonder where they get <br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
We have a neighbor&#39;s knowledge of the kids next door.  They&#39;re rarely playing <br/>
outside.  They had a puppy but he was never allowed inside.  He was chained <br/>
in the yard for months and months, looking so sad we thought of stealing him <br/>
but they might notice.  A German Shepherd mix.  When he was tiny they played <br/>
with him lots.  When he was grown, they hardly seemed to feed him.  Holly has <br/>
visited and had their mid-of-three over, but the conversation starts over <br/>
every time, and it scares Holly like the Twlight Zone.  &quot;Where do you go to <br/>
school?&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t.&quot;...  every time, the same.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just neighbor&#39;s knowledge, but it&#39;s real.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I do know a family around where I live that has an<br/>
&gt; 8<br/>
&gt; &gt; year old boy and a 5 year old girl and the parents<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;homeschool&quot;, but I know that the only schooling<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids get is from chores such as feeding the dog<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; folding laundry <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***  How do you &quot;know&quot;?  Unless you move in with the<br/>
&gt; family, you have Very Limited knowledge of what goes<br/>
&gt; on in the home.  A neighbor&#39;s knowledge.  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; possibly know what living there is like.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know because the mother cannot read or write and she<br/>
never reads to the kids, never takes them to the<br/>
library  the family doesn&#39;t have a computer or<br/>
television, they don&#39;t have field trips because the<br/>
family has no car and in the homeschool lesson plans<br/>
we have to fill out in Missouri  her husband makes up<br/>
stuff that the kids do all day.  He says he doesn&#39;t<br/>
believe in school because the government brainwashes<br/>
children there.  So there is probably learning about<br/>
how to fold laundry and wash dishes but since the wife<br/>
and kids never leave the house except to go to church<br/>
I have a difficult time finding ways the kids would<br/>
learn things such as the monetary system etc.&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; You mention that this is the only &quot;schooling&quot; they<br/>
&gt; get.  I am an unschooler.  I don&#39;t want to provide<br/>
&gt; &quot;schooling&quot; for my children.  If you mean that<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the only learning that is taking place, I&#39;d say that<br/>
&gt; unless the children are locked in closets that is<br/>
&gt; Impossible.  The children spend 24/6  locked in a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>house and on sundays they go to church  where children<br/>
are seen and not heard.  They are not allowed to go<br/>
outside and play because they might get dirty  and I<br/>
might read them a book---something I have done before<br/>
and been lectured to for over an hour that if the<br/>
father wants his kids brainwashed by those books he<br/>
would read them to the kids himself.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Learning happens constantly.  That they are not<br/>
&gt; learning what you or I or anyone else thinks is<br/>
&gt; &quot;appropriate&quot; is not &quot;child abuse&quot;.   And who are<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; or I or anyone else to make that Judgment in the<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt; place?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said  I haven&#39;t turned them over to DFS but I<br/>
assume that someday  someone probably will.<br/>
<br/>
I live in a neighborhood full of homeschoolers <br/>
because our school system doesn&#39;t work.   We have<br/>
fundamental christian homeschoolers, 3 unschooling<br/>
families, a family that uses strict curriculum  much<br/>
like school but done by the parents.   All of the<br/>
children in those families seem like &quot;normal kids&quot;   <br/>
Then there is the &quot;other family&quot;   The kids act like 2<br/>
year olds.  They fall on the ground and throw a fits<br/>
banging fists etc  they scream all hours of the day<br/>
and night  loud enough for neighbors to be concerned <br/>
when they used to come to my house  I had to &quot;baby<br/>
proof&quot;  my house before they got there because they<br/>
didn&#39;t understand how to interact and function in a<br/>
setting other than their own home.   It was like<br/>
having two babies in my house  but their motor skills<br/>
are well developed.  If the children were diagnosed<br/>
with a learning disability I would understand,  but<br/>
they appear that they would be normal  if they were<br/>
allowed.  <br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooler I consider learning  schooling<br/>
because I have to document all the hours my children<br/>
learn  and we call it school  although we have  no set<br/>
hours or books or anything else   Just a lesson plan<br/>
and a journal  required by Missouri.   You haven&#39;t<br/>
offended me  but you have to realize that some places<br/>
have people that really do not want their children<br/>
exposed to learning because as long as the children<br/>
don&#39;t learn how to function outside of the home/church<br/>
the parents and church can control them better.  My<br/>
whole point to the original story being that maybe the<br/>
mother so wants to control her children  she fails to<br/>
help them learn.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been turned into the DFS  many times  because I<br/>
own exotic animals and people think that snakes and<br/>
spiders are more dangerous to my children than dogs or<br/>
cats would be, so I know what it is like to have the<br/>
government try to take my children away so I don&#39;t<br/>
take turning families in for things  lightly.<br/>
