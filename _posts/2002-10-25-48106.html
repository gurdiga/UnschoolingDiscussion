<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181428462">This reminds me of the way some people think that having no limits or rules for your children mean that they run around wild, leaving a trail of chaos and destruction in their path. Supporting parental rights is no different. It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean hurting or abusing your children, any more than not limiting children means ignoring and neglecting them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155701727">Bridget, your post made me very sad, not just for your children, but for you and your<br/>
husband as well. I don&#39;t think that you really realize what kind of relationship you are<br/>
missing out on with your children. I speak from experience here, not with spanking but<br/>
with another form of coercive parenting in the guise of teaching our children.<br/>
<br/>
In our case it was ferberizing. Jason had started sleeping longer stretches when he<br/>
was 10 weeks old, so when he started waking up during the night when he was around 6 or <br/>
7 months old I didn&#39;t understand why. One of my friends gave me Ferber&#39;s book and told<br/>
me that it worked great and that I needed to do it, he would not learn any other way. <br/>
I read it and did not like the sound of it. But at around 8 or 9 months I finally<br/>
gave in and we did it (after all, all the parenting mags and experts said we had to<br/>
do it). It &quot;worked&quot; like a charm. First night he cried for 30 mins <br/>
(the longest 30 mins in my entire life), the second for 15 mins, the 3rd for 5 mins <br/>
and after that all we had to do was read a book or 2, put him in his crib  and he <br/>
would go to sleep by himself. No fuss, no muss. We had our evenings to ourselves and<br/>
a very &quot;good&quot; baby. <br/>
<br/>
Luckily when he started waking at night again at 12 months, I had found an Attachment<br/>
Parenting board and found out that there *were* kids who were never left to cry it out<br/>
and who did learn to sleep on their own. That it was extremely normal for babies to<br/>
start waking when they had been sleeping well previously (due to a variety of<br/>
developmental and physical reasons). I was so relieved to have people tell me that my<br/>
instincts were correct and that there were other options. It took three months of<br/>
me trying different things and reading a lot before we got to a manageable balance for<br/>
both of us. <br/>
<br/>
Those were extremely tiring and frustrating times for me. And I would not trade them<br/>
for the world. I learned so much about my son and about myself during that time. I<br/>
grew as a mother and as a person. Some of my favorite memories of Jason as a baby are<br/>
from that time. I learned that sometimes you just have to surrender yourself to your<br/>
reality (not give up, but rather accept it for now). Realize that some things are beyond <br/>
your control. And that your children are worth it.<br/>
<br/>
I also learned what I was missing those 4 or 5 months that Jason put himself to sleep.<br/>
I missed rocking and nursing him to sleep. One of life&#39;s few remaining simple pleasures<br/>
and I had been quilted into thinking that it was wrong. I also found that by gently<br/>
parenting him to sleep and by responding to him at night that our relationship was taken<br/>
to a new level. During the months that Jason went to sleep alone, I thought that we<br/>
had a wonderful relationship. You could not have told me that we could have an even<br/>
better one. We cuddled a lot during the day, read a lot, had fun a lot. But after I started<br/>
responding to his needs at night, we got to know each other on a deeper level. I learned<br/>
things about myself and about him (including that he had a dairy intolerance problem that <br/>
we had overlooked before and was a large cause of the nightwakings) that I never would<br/>
have found if he had continued to be that &quot;good&quot; baby. By forcing myself to look at<br/>
other options that respected him as a person, I grew as a parent. When Kyle was<br/>
born, I was better able to enjoy our night times together from the start. I did <br/>
not worry about getting him on a schedule or getting him to sleep longer. I trusted<br/>
that he would. And he did. He has always been a &quot;better&quot; sleeper then Jason. Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, in the short term, spanking does create obedient kids (for some, for others <br/>
it creates rebellious kids). But what are you missing? I put a lot of thought into<br/>
how I parent, try to figure out what is really going on to make Jason act the way that<br/>
he is acting. Many times it is in reaction to something that I am or am not doing. <br/>
Sometimes he is in a  bad mood. I am striving to handle things better every day. The<br/>
advice that I have gotten on this list has made me a more responsive parent and I<br/>
believe that is helping my relationship with both of my boys. I look at the old timers<br/>
and see wonderful relationships with their kids. That is what I want. I want a child<br/>
who respects me because I respect him. I can only respect him by treating him how I want<br/>
to be treated. So I do not believe in spanking.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that you feel that you have a great relationship with your children. But what<br/>
if that relationship could get even better? There are people telling you that it can.<br/>
I learned this lesson when Jason was little and I am so thankful.<br/>
<br/>

Stephanie, I enjoyed what you had to say about all of this. Glad you ended <br/>
up with joyous experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when that Ferber crap came out. Heard rave reviews about it from <br/>
all kinds of people. I also remember when Joseph was waking often as a baby <br/>
after sleeping so well from the start. My husband Joe and I discussed the <br/>
Ferber thing. He thought maybe we should try it and I was saying no way. So <br/>
one night Joseph starts to cry after sleeping maybe an hour and Joe heads <br/>
off to make sure he was okay and then to let him &quot;cry it out.&quot; I&#39;m in the <br/>
bedroom listening on the intercom. I hear him go into the room and tell <br/>
Joseph it&#39;s sleep time. I hear the door close and total quiet. I&#39;m waiting <br/>
for the crying to start and nothing. But no Joe either. I get up and go into <br/>
the living room and there&#39;s my husband sitting with a very happy baby on the <br/>
couch!!!! Big old lug didn&#39;t have the heart after all. Couldn&#39;t help but <br/>
love him all over again!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am sure that you feel that you have a great relationship with your <br/>
children. But what if that relationship could get even better? There are <br/>
people telling you that it can. I learned this lesson when Jason was little <br/>
and I am so thankful.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just tonight I asked my 2 year old to &quot;come here&quot; and she was dawdling over <br/>
something much more interesting than me wiping chocolate ice cream off her <br/>
face. I repeated twice more and ended up meeting her half way. First thing I <br/>
thought of was some kids would get a spanking for that. I hugged her before <br/>
the chocolate was wiped off!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So am I. I learned a lot. This is still one of my biggest parenting regrets. That<br/>
I did not listen to my instincts that knew it was wrong. Hadn&#39;t realized that most<br/>
parenting experts have no idea what they are talking about. So hard to ignore when<br/>
it is all you hear. And it is your first baby so you do not realize that most<br/>
children go through this and grow out of it. :o)<br/>

to the point where I do not feel like I need to be a policeman with my kids.<br/>
I am starting to relax on things. I realized today that I have been yelling a lot<br/>
less lately...making small steps...<br/>

I like your story!<br/>
I had one yesterday too that made me think of this discussion.<br/>
Sierra and I had some time alone, Baby was sleeping, Trevor and Jared had <br/>
walked up to Toys-R-Us. She got out a bunch of art stuff and we painted <br/>
together for a while.<br/>
She kept at it another  hour after I gave up....<br/>
Later, I went to clean up the mess and asked her to &quot;please come here&quot; She <br/>
said &quot;Ok, Mom&quot; and walked over to me (I had to wonder if she&#39;d want to come <br/>
if I was a spanker that scared her all the time). I asked her to help me get <br/>
the paint stuff cleaned up and she said &quot;sure&quot; and then &quot;but Mom, I&#39;m playing <br/>
with Jalen right now&quot; (who had woken up and was in the middle of a pile of <br/>
hand puppets Sierra had gotten out in the meantime).<br/>
They were so happily playing together, and it was a big help for me to have <br/>
her keeping him entertained, so I said I&#39;d clean up the messy stuff and would <br/>
she please just put the paintbrushes and paint away later.<br/>
She was happy to oblige.<br/>
A spanked child might have done it out of fear.<br/>
I prefer her doing it with joy, just because we work together and help each <br/>
other frequently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204598335">That makes me think about how I&#39;d ask my husband for help.  I would <br/>
never just demand that he drop what he&#39;s doing instantly to help me <br/>
with something.  If I DID, he might *sometimes* say ok right away and <br/>
he might sometimes say that he&#39;ll be there when he&#39;s free. So now I&#39;m <br/>
learning not to demand things of my kids like that.  I&#39;ve been asking <br/>
myself, &quot;How would I ask another adult for help in doing that?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think that sometimes people forget that what our kids are doing is <br/>
important and valuable even when it doesn&#39;t seem important through <br/>
our adult eyes.  <br/>
