<div id="ygrps-yiv-104375063">Hi Tamara,<br/>
Welcome.  This is a great list.  Lots of help here.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for you and anyone else in Indiana.  we are headed to<br/>
Bloomfield, (near Bloomington) to take care of my 93 yr old Grandmother for 10<br/>
days.  She hardly ever gets out of the house, and I would like to find some<br/>
places to take her.  I&#39;m thinking of maybe some state parks that might have a<br/>
playground.  She is not very mobile, but I don&#39;t see why we couldn&#39;t take her in<br/>
a wheelchair a bit.<br/>
There was also some place we had been maybe within an hour or two that was some<br/>
kind of living history place.  I think it might have been  Amish????<br/>
Who has some ideas?<br/>
Thanks guys.<br/>
Ann</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711213367">Ann, I have  90 year old grandmother, who is now pretty much confined to<br/>
bed. But when she was able to get out, about an hour or two was all she<br/>
wanted at a time.  What she might like to do instead of sight see, is go by<br/>
places that meant a lot to her.  Her church she attended. or the schools, or<br/>
even just the local park.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902911859">Hi Ann!<br/>
    Thanks for the welcome:)<br/>
    If you are going to be near Bloomington, I guess I&#39;d suggest Brown<br/>
County State Park. Truthfully, I&#39;m not that sure how close it is -- but they<br/>
are both in the same general area & distance from me (I live in<br/>
Indianapolis:)<br/>
    Another possibility there would be Nashville, they have (had at least --<br/>
it&#39;s been a couple of years since I&#39;ve been down there...) lots of<br/>
interesting little shops for window shopping, and a place that sells<br/>
*wonderful* icecream cones:D Lots of places to sit and rest for a few<br/>
minutes too.<br/>
    I liked the suggestions someone made about taping stories or<br/>
conversations - also, don&#39;t forget to take a camera and plenty of film!<br/>
Enjoy your time with her!<br/>
Tamara &lt;who always forgets the camera&lt;sigh&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The living history place you&#39;re thinking about is probably Connor Prairie<br/>
near Noblesville.  I highly recommend it.  Their website is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.connerprairie.org">http://www.connerprairie.org</a><br/>
<br/>
I also recommend the Indianapolis Children&#39;s Museum.  That is a must see.<br/>
<br/>
Great state parks which are not far from Indpls include Turkey Run which is<br/>
adjacent to Parke County, the covered bridge capital of the world, and<br/>
Spring Mill which is south of Bloomington off of State Road 37.  The latter<br/>
has a museum dedicated to Mitchell, Indiana&#39;s famous son, Gus Grissom, and<br/>
a very interesting pioneer village with a working water mill.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey! We honeymooned at Turkey Run State Park! Great hiking, really<br/>
beautiful. The restaurant service was so slow, however, that we took to<br/>
going to the local Pizza Hut buffet, where we were the only people in the<br/>
place who didn&#39;t know everybody else, or so it seemed. Fun memories... We&#39;ll<br/>
have to go back sometime with the kids.<br/>

We visited this museum when we were in Indianapolis for a gymnastics <br/>

there...they were having an international &quot;festival&quot;...unbeknownst to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479053920">I&#39;d definitely recommend the Childrens Museum, but there is usually a<br/>
lot of walking involved - unless your kids won&#39;t let you leave a particular<br/>
area they get interested in! Then you may end up sitting all day!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
    But just be warned - they are not cheap. I think adults are almost $9<br/>
now, and kids $6something. Depending on how long you&#39;ll be in the area, it<br/>
may be cheaper to buy a membership! Unfortunately, they no longer have a<br/>
reciprocal agreement with anyone anymore....:(<br/>
    We haven&#39;t been to Richey Woods yet, but I think it&#39;s right behind where<br/>
my best friend used to live - if so, it&#39;s pretty cool. I really need to<br/>
check this out sometime....<br/>

I&#39;ll have to see how far that is.<br/>
