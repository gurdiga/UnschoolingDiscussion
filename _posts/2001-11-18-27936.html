Just wanted to say &quot;thanks&quot;.  You have provided much more helpful and<br/>
in-depth information than I knew....and I knew some.  To me,  this<br/>
represents how good this list CAN be!<br/>

Peanut and NSAID allergies are a bit different than most allergies.  Perhaps<br/>
folks would better understand these things if they thought of them as being<br/>
in three categories:  1) Sensitive to; 2) Allergic to; and 3) Severely<br/>
allergic to.<br/>
<br/>
Most food &quot;allergies&quot; are really sensitivities to foods.  One can live with<br/>
it and not really do too much to change one&#39;s environment.<br/>
<br/>
Category 2&#39;s must make changes and frequently must have epi-pens.<br/>
<br/>
Category 3s are immediately life threatening and the epi-pens only give you<br/>
a reprieve, hopefully long enough to get to a hospital.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is a Category 3 reactor, then you are presented with numerous<br/>
other problems the most important of which is the fact that you can&#39;t always<br/>
know that you have been exposed until it can be too late.<br/>
<br/>
With a bee string, for example, you generally know if you have been stung.<br/>
So your brain processes &quot;sting&quot; and then one goes for the epi-pen.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t know you have somehow ingested peanuts or NSAIDs, then you<br/>
don&#39;t have that window of opportunity to use that epi-pen when it is most<br/>
effective.<br/>
<br/>
Say you take your child to a park, the child runs around playing, climbs on<br/>
a table where another child has been that ate a peanut butter sandwich.  You<br/>
could be 25 yards away when your child suddenly drops to the ground and by<br/>
the time you get to the child it might be too late.<br/>
<br/>
I realise that Category 3s are, thankfully, relatively rare but they are a<br/>
fact of life.<br/>
<br/>
The only positive about the allergy and living in the US is that companies<br/>
must now clearly label their products if there is any chance peanuts might<br/>
be in the product OR if they use the same equipment to make something with<br/>
peanuts.  In other countries they mix up their oils and nothing is labeled.<br/>
<br/>
Also, most folks aren&#39;t aware of just how many things peanuts/peanut<br/>
oils/peanut fibers are in.  Here&#39;s a short list:  shampoo, face cream, hand<br/>
lotion, baby massage cream, cooking oil, vegetable oil, salad oil, medicine,<br/>
goiter treatment, laxatives, axel grease, hand cleaners (like mechanics<br/>
use), laundry soap, wood filler,  insecticide, insulated boards, Kraft<br/>
paper, glue, plastics, and the list goes on.<br/>
<br/>
As to moving where there aren&#39;t peanuts, well that leaves nowhere on earth.<br/>
Peanuts are a legume and they grow like a weed in almost any climate.  They<br/>
have been exported to all countries and now play a part in the cooking of<br/>
almost every ethnic group.  And, as you can see from the very short list<br/>
above, one simply can&#39;t escape the presence of the lowly peanut.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145465498">&lt;&lt;quite willing to lie about the food our daughter eats&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yuck.  Then hypothetically  :),  I would have to say these &quot;friends&quot;<br/>
would not be in a situation to be responsible for my daughter again.<br/>
<br/>
Again hypothetically, isn&#39;t a 7yo old enough to monitor the ingredients of<br/>
their own food?  My youngest had serious allergies beginning as a newborn,<br/>
side of face swelling up, skin sloughing off, etc..  We were able to narrow<br/>
it down to insect bites, milk and soy.  We discussed the situation with the<br/>
kids and we all agreed to stop bringing food with those ingredients into the<br/>
house.  Even my 5yo, who at 8yo still struggles to read, would scour the<br/>
ingredient lists for M-I-L-K or S-O-Y.  He would readily put things he liked<br/>
back on the shelf because he was concerned about his sister&#39;s safety.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t this hypothetical child be interested in avoiding life threatening<br/>
situations for herself?<br/>
<br/>
Same son, now 8yo, voluntarily avoids chocolate because he feels it upsets<br/>
his stomach.  He made the connection completely on his own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940591320">I know what you mean about the shaking. I was diagnosed finally at 11y <br/>
after my pediatrician refused to see me any more until my mom took me <br/>
to the allergist for asthma management. She was in denial about it. <br/>
Can&#39;t blame her, asthma still seems so mysterious, and I&#39;ve had it for <br/>
26 years. As a kid I was in and out of the ER until we gave the cat to <br/>
a friend, and changed all the carpets. Very sad. I also couldn&#39;t raise <br/>
puppies for Guide Dogs for the Blind anymore. At least the one puppy I <br/>
did raise graduated and worked with a person who needed him in Modesto.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know you are all waiting for this. Here it is. I found out <br/>
after being on stronger and stronger meds for 24/7 and the occasional <br/>
bout with prednisone (yucch) for 25 years, that (ta da) it was mostly <br/>
from a milk allergy! Ha. That&#39;s nuts. I loved milk! I drank 3 or 4 <br/>
glasses a day! Cereal, ice cream, and pizza were my favorite foods! Of <br/>
course everybody is different, and asthma is complex and mysterious. <br/>
Just for me it felt like sprouting wings when I weaned myself of the <br/>
meds. I am free now. Except that I still try, once in a while, to eat <br/>
pizza, or some goofy thing and pay for it later. <br/>
<br/>
There it is. That&#39;s all. Short and sweet.<br/>

do but I have a different mind set about it now. I haven&#39;t used an inhaler in <br/>
over a year. I have had 4 major attacks this year too. I used Rescue Remedy <br/>
(Bach flower) for all but one. I didn&#39;t have a thing on me including my cell <br/>
phone and I was half way up a mountain mountain biking. I started to panic <br/>
and imagined the worst but I made my self do what I know how to do. I <br/>
mentally bring myself out of my attacks. I have done this since I was a child <br/>
b/c I was petrified of hospitals. I also have a personality flaw where I <br/>
don&#39;t want anyone to know I need help,let alone help me. @@<br/>
<br/>
   I even worked for a Respiratory specialst at one point and I became really <br/>
paranoid during that time. Later returned to my mental abilities to help <br/>
myself. My mother also never made a huge deal out of my being an asthmatic,I <br/>
ran around and played as much as any other child. One thing I did get out of <br/>
in HS,swimming the chlorine really triggered a reaction. I do use pools now <br/>
but they do make my lungs sensitive. I have difficulty w/ chemicals esp. and <br/>
icecream,and Beer or winecoolers. I have gotten to know my body very well and <br/>
I have learned how to handle asthma very well. <br/>
<br/>
   I am very active, I run,mountain bike,snowboard,and climb mountains. it <br/>
hasn&#39;t stopped me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Haven&#39;t asthma meds come a long way since then?  I used to react that <br/>
way to theophylin too.  I take Accolate now.  Other than the fact <br/>
that my new doctor and I have yet to come to an agreement about what, <br/>
when and how much I medicine I need, my asthma is in control and the <br/>
side-effects are minimal.<br/>
<br/>
As for the thing about not treating early signs of asthma with <br/>
ventolin.  I agree whole heartedly.  Wyndham had a major attack when <br/>
he was 18 months old.  He was hospitalized and all that.  After he <br/>
got home, his doctor slowly with drew all the meds.  He had one other <br/>
major attack and a new round of treatment and withdrawal of <br/>
treatment.  He hasn&#39;t needed anything stronger than anti-histamines <br/>
since (they will help allergy related asthma) which is good because <br/>
most of the medicine, even the prescription meds have dye in them.  <br/>
He still wheezes occasionally, but not much.  I&#39;m keeping my fingers <br/>
crossed that he will never need as much medicine as I do.<br/>
<br/>
Jenni also had an attack at a very early age.  Just one.  She too <br/>
lives med free.  I do think there is a connection between treating <br/>
with more drugs than absolutely needed and dependence on the drugs <br/>
later.  But I can&#39;t offer anything more than anecdotal evidence.  <br/>
Does anyone know if there have been any studies?<br/>

I am from NC. We have been hs for a couple of years. We do unschooling with<br/>

NC is not too bad for hs laws. You register with the state and give the kids<br/>

NC is a great state with lots of universities, diverse landscape, a couple<br/>
