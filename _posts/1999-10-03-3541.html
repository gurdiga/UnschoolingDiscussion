In our family our six year old insisted on knowing what the Easter Bunny was all<br/>
about.  She was asked what she thought and she said that she thought that Mama was<br/>
doing it.  This was confirmed and my daughter chortled with laughter she thought it<br/>
was wonderful that mama was going around the house doing all this Easter stuff.  She<br/>
thought it was funny too.  No resentment or upset re: being &quot;lied&quot; to.  She saw it<br/>
for what it was,  an attempt on the parents part to delight their children with a<br/>
magical play (which for us has little religious significance).  We have talked a<br/>
little bit about the many world religions which have their god figure either die or<br/>
be killed, and who then comes back to life.  She is only moderately interested.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;  We do not do Santa (or<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that bunny or fairy either) just cause it is like lying.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &lt;&lt;When children realize that adults have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been lying to them about the easter bunny and Santa Claus,  they<br/>
&gt; &gt; inevitably wonder what else they have been lied to about.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A true story:<br/>
&gt; I knew a mother that told her son about Santa and the easter bunny.  One day,<br/>
&gt; when he was about 4 or so, he heard that they weren&#39;t real and wanted an answer<br/>
&gt; out of mommy.  She told him that Santa was just a story and all of the good stuff<br/>
&gt; about the giving spirit.  But the question he came back with left her<br/>
&gt; speechless!  He asked her, &quot;Then is Jesus real?&quot;  She realized that, as most<br/>
&gt; children can&#39;t, her son couldn&#39;t differentiate between real and make-believe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just something more to add to the conversation.<br/>
