<div id="ygrps-yiv-967875923">Dear one,<br/>
<br/>
Breathe deeply and relax.  My take on Koleen&#39;s post was that the &quot;war&quot; was<br/>
basically a misunderstanding over a misunderstanding.  That you handled<br/>
yourself with aplomb(is that a word?) and that you had already apologized<br/>
for any feelings you might have accidentally hurt so what were people<br/>
fighting over?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps I misunderstood the entire post and Kolleen is just a big old<br/>
meanie  &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
If this post makes it, I&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised. I&#39;ve posted 15 <br/>
times on three different groups collectively in the past two days and <br/>
nothing has gone through. I&#39;ve added a yahoo address to my account <br/>
and hoping this will do the trick since I&#39;m still on the road.<br/>
<br/>
It was originally a misunderstanding. And then it snowballed. And I <br/>
think the war was over a post that never existed. What a misagosh!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my cursive, answering, math and another post never made it <br/>
here. Oh well, there was some great reads on it!<br/>
<br/>

So it doesn&#39;t matter. Sometimes, a lot of times, I don&#39;t answer if <br/>
someone posted something that I would of. I figure why duplicate the <br/>
same thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534119772">Quite a few of my posts never showed up either.  Including the one to <br/>
Elissa to encourage her to keep on posting.  <br/>
Are they lost forever, or will they show up eventually?<br/>

I understand all that. I just felt very uncomfortable with my name repeating<br/>
over and over in an email, especially when alot of what was written seemed<br/>
attributed to me and was incorrect.<br/>
Why was it necessary to &quot;sum it all up&quot;?<br/>
