<div id="ygrps-yiv-393512372">Hi Brenda,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this response is a bit late - I&#39;m just catching up on reading my <br/>
digests for this list.<br/>
Your e-mail caught my eye because I live in Arizona, in the Phoenix area.<br/>
I have two boys - 14 and 12 - and they&#39;ve always been homeschooled. We&#39;ve <br/>
unschooled for the past 4 years.<br/>
<br/>
Like some others have said, homeschooling is pretty easy here. You need to <br/>
notify the county of your intent to homeschool and that&#39;s it. There are LOTS <br/>
of homeschooling groups here, both secular and religious. There are also a <br/>
few unschooling groups around town. I am the listowner of <br/>
Phoenix_Unschoolers and here&#39;s your invitation to join if you&#39;d like.<br/>

<br/>
If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

ps- that invite for the Phoenix_Unschoolers list is good for anyone else on <br/>
this list, as well! :-)<br/>

&gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been reading all your emails for over a year now, I guess.  Anyhow, I <br/>
&gt; love this group and have gotten such wonderful inspiration from you all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My name is Brenda and I have a wonderful dd R who will be 5 next month. <br/>
&gt; We will be unschooling, continuing our path of life long learning.  I am a <br/>
&gt; single mom currently living in So Cal.  But, I&#39;m planning to move out of <br/>
&gt; the area as I just can no longer afford to live here and unschool.  Being <br/>
&gt; able to work at home is my priority, so that I can be with my daughter and <br/>
&gt; she can continue to learn whatever she desires.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am seriously considering moving to Arizona, the Phoenix area.  I thought <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d ask here first if anyone knows of any unschooling groups in that area, <br/>
&gt; or even a good secular homeschooling group would do too.  Also, if anyone <br/>
&gt; has any idea about the homeschooling laws in AZ?  Is it a hs friendly <br/>
&gt; place to live?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brenda<br/>
