<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565280874">When I was a kid, if there was something on my plate that I didn&#39;t like I&#39;d <br/>
have to sit there until it was done.  No matter if it would make me sick or it <br/>
was cold or if I really, really hated it.<br/>
<br/>
I think those times when that would happen and I would try to sneak it to the <br/>
dogs or wrap it in a napkin, etc., that&#39;s when I would feel ashamed for being <br/>
sneaky and it ended up being a crappy day or night.<br/>
<br/>
With my kids, I don&#39;t choose how much or when or what.  Kids are born knowing <br/>
what they need and when, and mine are still pretty much self limiting.  I can <br/>
lay out an entire bowl of something they love but when they are done, they <br/>
are done.  I think this is because they know it isn&#39;t a one time thing.  The <br/>
option is always there to enjoy things, so they don&#39;t gorge when something is out <br/>
that they love.  When they are full, they&#39;re full.  We are by no means rich <br/>
and the stuff they like isn&#39;t always here but they have other things and know <br/>
more is coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
They only thing I&#39;ve ever asked of the two of them (6 and 2.5) is that they <br/>
try things. I don&#39;t make them but I ask that they do it.  My little one was <br/>
always interested in bagels and cream cheese and I&#39;d ask if he&#39;d like to try it <br/>
and he would say, &quot;eewww yukky, NO&quot; and run away.  I knew he&#39;d probably enjoy <br/>
it but he had to do it on his terms and he finally asked to try it and LOVES <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
In the back of my mind I feel like maybe sometimes future weight problems and <br/>
eating disorders can come from the stress of controlled eating as a child.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any thoughts on that?<br/>
<br/>
I look at my young children everyday and I am amazed at how they choose for <br/>
themselves what they need and/or express openly what they&#39;d like.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like when they are born and we provide for them the breast or bottle at <br/>
any time, why would that change?  They know then what they want.  When table <br/>
foods are introduced and peas or something gets spit out, usually they&#39;re not <br/>
given again for a while because it&#39;s obvious that the baby doesn&#39;t like it.  So <br/>
why, when a child is a bit older, when a parent or adult assumes NOW the <br/>
child can understand or be told what to do, that they force these foods?  Is it <br/>
control?   A friend of mine has been trying desperately to get her new 3 week <br/>
old baby on a schedule and it flips me out.  I can see wanting to maintain a <br/>
pre-baby life but it&#39;s just not possible after they are here.  The baby is always <br/>
upset and so is she.  She is not yet working again and may not return at all. <br/>
 How can I help her make this easier?  She is stubborn about the schedule <br/>
thing but I have told her he&#39;ll have his own schedule and you follow that.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to feed on demand and is ready to go to the bottle and formula <br/>
now.  I said that&#39;ll be more hassle with the cleaning of bottles and preparing <br/>
the formula, not to mention breast is best for them both. <br/>

Warn her the poop of formula fed babies smells about 6 times worse than <br/>
the poop of exclusively breastfed babies.  I&#39;m not making this up.  My <br/>
infant wasn&#39;t gaining weight and I ended up supplementing for awhile, <br/>
and the smell of the formula-fed poop is truly repulsive.<br/>

Give her a copy of the Baby Book by Sears.  Or one of the LLL books.  <br/>
She is obviously reading some book (or listening to people) that is <br/>
telling her babies need to be on a schedule.  Maybe by giving her <br/>
opposing information also from experts she will see that putting a <br/>
baby on a schedule isn&#39;t the way to go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK, not technically an unschooling topic but if she is unschooling <br/>
older children it becomes an unschooling-related issue?  Am I right <br/>
in thinking this (moderators)?<br/>
<br/>
I think the way to help others parent in a more gentle respectful <br/>
was is to support them in a kind and as much as possible <br/>
nonjudgemental way.  American culture is loud and hard to turn your <br/>
back on; obviously right now it&#39;s what she&#39;s hearing.  I tend to <br/>
tune out people who &quot;tell me&quot; to do something, but take gentle and <br/>
constructive  suggestions to heart.  Having a new baby is <br/>
overwhelming, and it&#39;s a lot to ask somebody to buck the &quot;experts&quot; <br/>
that havew shaped mainstream mothering.  There are lots of ways to <br/>
support and guide a friend (perhaps imagine how you might try to <br/>
steer you kids of a path you thought was hurting them or someone <br/>
else?)<br/>
