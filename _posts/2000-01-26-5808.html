<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575527005">Hi everyone!!  I am just bursting with good news and wanted to share with<br/>
all of you folks.  For those of you who do not know it, we are in the<br/>
process of adopting from foster care.  After months of discouraging<br/>
negative responses from Case Workers all over the country who have truned<br/>
us down for children we were interested in, we finally have some good news.<br/>
<br/>
We are being considered for a sister pair in Louisianna!!  We are also<br/>
being considered for a little girl in Ohio!!<br/>
<br/>
I have pictures and more info, but I cannot send attachments to the list,<br/>
so anyone interested in Oooohing and Aahhhing with us, just let me know!!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, if either of these come through for us I will need to be<br/>
preparing a home for these girls and I need help from you experienced<br/>
parents of girls about what kinds of things I will need for them.  I<br/>
realize it depends on their personalities and interests, but what kinds of<br/>
books, toys, games, etc do your girls like?  The sisters are 4 and 7 and<br/>
the other little girl is 8.  <br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things do kids these ages do for schooling?  They are coming<br/>
from IS and I will probably need to begin with some structure for their<br/>
comfort and ease out of it as they deschool and settle into the family.<br/>
Also we will be dealing with attachment and placement issues, and showing<br/>
visible schooling results to the state while the adoption finalizes.  After<br/>
that we can relax more.  Help me out here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622690380">Well, all little girls are different but most love Barbies, coloring,<br/>
reading, music, Disney videos, dress up and aren&#39;t too old for cuddle time<br/>
at night.  Our youngest female kidlet is 7 and eldest will be 30 next month<br/>
but the time inbetween these two hasn&#39;t made too much difference to what<br/>
they like in general.  Of course, youngest kidlet is 7 going on 42 (or she<br/>
thinks so &lt;g&gt;) and eldest is 30 going on 16, so you just never know.  We&#39;re<br/>
all reading Harry Potter and Little Women right now.  She is reading the<br/>
American girl books.<br/>
<br/>
Lot&#39;s of luck with the red tape and hope you have someone home with you<br/>
soon!!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70361303">Nanci, how wonderful for you.<br/>
I have two boys, and one girl.  Although they are young the only difference I<br/>
see so far, is she likes to do crafty type things, and she will sit and play by<br/>
herself for much longer than the boys.  She is only 3, but loves to sit and do<br/>
puzzles forever.<br/>
My inclination is to say just wait and see what develops, and how they are.<br/>
They will let you know quickly I&#39;m sure.<br/>
Just enjoy and adapt for awhile first.<br/>
Though, I have no experience with this whatsoever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409587115">I try for plenty of unisex toys for my girls 4 & 7.  They play with cars<br/>
and with dolls.  They like puzzles, blocks, balls, little animal and<br/>
people figures, helping me, playing with bread dough.  Paper, pencil,<br/>
pen, & marker.  We are enjoying American Girls books and dolls, Little<br/>
House on the Prairie series, and Harry Potter.  Science experiments are<br/>
always a hit.  Reading, reading, books on tape, listening to music, and<br/>
dancing.  Dress-up.  Pretending!!!!<br/>
I don&#39;t have boys, but it seems that most of what my girls like is<br/>
similar to most of what boys like.  They will wrestle, but they haven&#39;t<br/>
ever made weapons of anything, that I&#39;ve noticed.  They do wiggle and<br/>
shout, sometimes act wild and other times sit still and focus.<br/>
I&#39;m excited for your family, Nanci, and send many best wishes for the<br/>
adoptions!  My brother adopted a foster child, and then his sister about<br/>
6 months later.  They are pre-teens now.  There were some issues at the<br/>
time of adoption due to the children&#39;s Native American heritage.<br/>

That is great news congratulations getting your girls. My daughter Melissa<br/>
will be 8 on Sat. and is having a fancy  tea party this year; She loves<br/>
Winnie the Pooh  who is also invited (it is her first dress up fancy party!)<br/>
Her friends are all bringing their favorite doll or stuffed animal!  The<br/>
best thing she loves the most aside from stuffed bears and American Doll<br/>
type stuff is anything to do with art especially markers. Last year kids<br/>
gave her things for gifts that shocked me like lipstick and nail polish<br/>
something I no way wanted her to get into so young but i held my breath let<br/>
her do it she only did it twice and she also painted her 6 year old<br/>
borhter&#39;s toes (which he later regretted asking for it!) (esp because he had<br/>
to go swimming LOL) Thankfully now she isn&#39;t so far  into makeup stuff the<br/>
way some of the girls are! I hope that helps answer some of your questions.<br/>
She also loves Brownies and dance and singing and anything to do with<br/>
performing arts. Hence the dressup stuff! I imagine your girls will have<br/>
lots of their special interests that they will let you know about as well.<br/>
