<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587561682">Everyone-<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a great 4th and are looking forward to a great July.<br/>
<br/>
Just sending out an update on rooms for our conference together in <br/>
Albuquerque.  We still rooms available, but we&#39;e getting close to <br/>
running out of rooms on the conference nights (Wed-Sun, 6-9 Sep).  As <br/>
of today, we have 28 rooms left on each of those days.  While this may <br/>
seem like plenty, we&#39;ve already made reservations for 141 rooms for <br/>
each of those nights.  With the 6 August deadline for the group rate <br/>
coming in 32 days from today, this e-mail is to remind those who <br/>
haven&#39;t made reservations to do so.  Even if you&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re <br/>
coming, I&#39;d make the reservation to ensure the conference group rate; <br/>
you can always cancel the reservation.  I&#39;ll send out several more <br/>
e-mails before the deadline date.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing: if I&#39;ve missed an e-list in your state, area, etc., <br/>
please forward this on.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone-<br/>
<br/>
Ben Lovejoy<br/>
Hotel Coordinator<br/>

Another update on rooms for our conference together in Albuquerque. We <br/>
have rooms available -- some even on the main nights (Wed-Sat, 6-9 <br/>
Sep). As of Tuesday, we were down 24 (of 169) rooms left on each of <br/>
those days. 6 August is our deadline with the hotel for the group rate; <br/>
we have 24 days from today to make reservations with that group rate. <br/>
Again, even if you&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re coming, make reservations to <br/>
ensure the conference group rate; you can always cancel the reservation.<br/>
