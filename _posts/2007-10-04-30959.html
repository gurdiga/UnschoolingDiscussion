get too irritated.  And I know...people say, &quot;Well, it&#39;s good for a<br/>
mainstream paper...for a mainstream audience.&quot;  But it&#39;s *never* good enough<br/>
for me, unless it&#39;s 100% spot on.  I want a rebuttal!! &lt;&lt;<br/>

unschooling article formula that we see all the time.  It has one<br/>
educational expert giving that old argument about how it might work for some<br/>
kids, if the parents and/or kids are interested in learning, but that for<br/>
kids that aren&#39;t, it&#39;s not going to work. &lt;&lt;<br/>

I have the same reaction as Anne and I&#39;ve noticed the &quot;formula&quot;, too. I<br/>
wrote a piece about the &quot;typical&quot; article a while back.<br/>

There isn&#39;t much content on the blog yet because I&#39;ve got stuff spread out<br/>
all over the web in various places and I&#39;m slowly condensing it all into one<br/>
site as I have time. I was starting to feel quite fractured there for a<br/>
while - one blog about unschooling, one about daily life, a photo journal,<br/>
writings on spirituality, a few sites that I started and grew disenchanted<br/>
with, etc. It&#39;s good to be putting &quot;me&quot; back together, lol, however slowly<br/>
it&#39;s coming along.<br/>

it out, and then I started seeing it everywhere!  I just noticed that <br/>
it was always one of the same old same old arguments, repeated almost <br/>
verbatum by one educational &quot;expert&quot; after another.  <br/>
<br/>
I just always found their arguments very lame and not really well <br/>
thought out, and so very frustrating to read because there were no <br/>
rebuttals!<br/>
<br/>
This article has one and that&#39;s cool!</div>
