<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748039100">As A child I always wated to be a secretary/typist. Due to family <br/>
circumstances I had to leave school at 15yrs and look after the <br/>
family.  I did work in a ladies clothes shop for a while and then got <br/>
married and had children.  My dream of being a secretary/typist never <br/>
eventuated.<br/>
When my youngest started ps I volunteered to help at the local <br/>
Community Centre - I worked my way up from volunteer, to paid <br/>
assistant, to second in charge, and now to Centre Administrator - <br/>
which is a job share position.<br/>
OK I will never make a 100 words a minute - or even 50 words a <br/>
minute!!  But I do do a lot of *computer* work as well as other <br/>
things.<br/>
So, I count myself lucky as I am sort of doing what I always wanted <br/>
to do - Well, at least one of the many things I wanted to <br/>
do ............<br/>
