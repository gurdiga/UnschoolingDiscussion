<div id="ygrps-yiv-758543993">My daughter&#39;s name is short and simple, with an L in the middle.  She used to say Ls as if they were Ys.  When we moved to a new town, I noticed that when she would introduce herself to other kids at a playground they wouldn&#39;t know what her name was, and I would clarify for her.  I offered the suggestion that we could practice saying Ls so she could tell other kids her name all by herself, and she was highly motivated.  Within 2 weeks of being shown where to place her tongue and practicing, she could say her name.  She was also really excited to say &quot;I love you&quot; clearly.  The Ls in other words slowly filtered in. <br/>
As with all learning, motivation was the key. <br/>
What is your son&#39;s motivation?  Does he want you to point out when he&#39;s mispronouncing something even if you can understand?  Are there a few words to start with that would be most helpful, and then the concept can spread out across his language naturally?<br/>
I like the idea of recording his voice so he can hear what others hear, and if he wants he could hear his progress as he practices. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16053828">I have a slight hearing loss. &nbsp;I say slight because I have never needed hearing aids but it did affect my ability to learn how to speak clearly and was only picked up when I was about three which is rather late considering children these days are tested not long after birth.<br><br>Up to about the age of 10 I went to a speech therapist. &nbsp;Most of what I remember doing is being given each month a &nbsp;number of different tongue twisters that I had to say at home in between visits. &nbsp;They were pasted in to my big folio book. (Just a cheap book big enough to paste A4/letter size print out in). &nbsp;I do remember that r is actually a hard letter to pronounce and can be early teens before it is mastered so he is doing well if he doesn&#39;t have problems with it.<br><br>I remember having to do She sells sea shells on the sea shore for example. &nbsp;Possibly if we hadn&#39;t moved at age 10 I would have kept attending but service provided in the new town was more focused on public speaking rather than the mechanics of speach which I needed.<br><br>As for getting him to listen to himself it isn&#39;t vital to improving speech. &nbsp;I only remember hearing myself once when younger and that was when a specialist my uncle knew came over for dinner so he could give some feedback to my parents, having listened to me without me being on my best behavour because I knew I was being listened or watched.<br><br>Latter as a teenager my grandmother lost much of her sight and Mum decided it would be a good idea to have all of us talk on a cassette and send it too her. &nbsp;Even though it was years latter I remembered what I sounded like the last time I had heard my voice, yuck. &nbsp;Just one more go listening to myself was enough that I refused to again. &nbsp;If I wanted to change something I had said I would go get my Mum to rewind it to the right spot with me out of the room. &nbsp;I hated how I sounded and got really upset that I might hear myself against my will. (Your son may not react like this, my sister and her best friend who lived next door loved recording and listening to themselves, I think they were encouraged in case I might join in what my big sister was doing but I never did as my feelings on the subject were that set)<div><br></div><div>The reason we hear ourselves so differently to how others do is we are picking<span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">&nbsp;</span><span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">up&nbsp;</span><span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">the sound of our voice from the vibrations along our jaw bone as well as through the air. &nbsp;When we hear others we are picking up the vibrations only coming to us through the air.</span></div><div><br>It might be worth your time contacting a therapist so you can discuss ideas direct with them and tell them which letters you are wanting to work with your son on so you can get some suggestions on how to help him.<br><br>Catherine</div><div>&nbsp;</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113186082"><font color='black' size='2' face='Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'><br>
My ten year old has a lot of pronunciation difficulties... mainly, he drops the second letter of any blend, struggles with l, and several other sounds.&nbsp;
<div><br>
</div>

<div>However, he also cries at the mere mention of speech therapy (so I don&#39;t bring it up), and I tried to direct him to google voice search as a way to work on his pronunciation but that just really upset him as well.&nbsp;</div>

<div><br>
</div>

<div>Ultimately, my husband told him a story about Jonathan Ross (an English TV celebrity) and how he made it big in spite of not being able to pronounce his r&#39;s, and although it didn&#39;t help with pronunciation, it made my son feel better and put the issue to rest for us until Toby (my son) decides he wants to change how he speaks.&nbsp;</div>

<div>We can become clearer writers without losing our own style.&nbsp; Similarly, I think we can become clearer speakers without having to ring out the King&#39;s English.&nbsp; </div>

When my son (unschooled) was younger (six or seven), he had a lot of trouble with s, z,, j, ch, and sh. We worked on them occasionally, if he expressed frustration at not being understood with a certain word, but I didn&#39;t push it. What helped most, honestly, was losing all his front baby teeth and having the bigger second teeth come in. His baby teeth had lots of gaps between, making those sounds lispy. Not sure if this is the case for you, but figured I&#39;d mention it. <br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23552" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23553" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23554"><span></span></div><br>  <div id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23558" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23557" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23556" dir="ltr"> <hr id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23555" size="1">  <font id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23561" face="Arial" size="2"> <b id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23560"><span id="ygrps-yiv-1849857554yui_3_16_0_1_1431548482254_23559" style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> &quot;judyw0607@...
