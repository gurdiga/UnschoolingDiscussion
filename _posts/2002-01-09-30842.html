<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758497119">Dear List,<br/>
  I&#39;ve been wanting to find a book I read when I was a kid, but I don&#39;t<br/>
remember the title or author.  I do remember the general idea of the<br/>
story, though.<br/>
<br/>
  The book was about a couple of kids who move into this old house with<br/>
the rest of their family.  In exploring the house they end up in the<br/>
attic and meet this ghost cat named Ophelia.  She has lived in the house<br/>
since it was built a long time before.  The kids go up in the attic all<br/>
the time to hear the ghost cat tell them stories about the people who<br/>
lived in the house over the years.  I think it was a pretty long book.  I<br/>
remember feeling really grown up reading such a &quot;big&quot; book!  <br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s all I remember!  Does this sound familiar to any of you?  I<br/>
read this when I was about 9 or 10, and would really enjoy reading it<br/>
again, maybe to my kids someday.  It&#39;s kinda like having an itch I can&#39;t<br/>
scratch, not knowing the title!!! LOL!!  Thanks in advance for your<br/>
help!!!  Djuana</div>
