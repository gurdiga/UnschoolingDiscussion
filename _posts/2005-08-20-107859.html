<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938294266">Well, well, well. I guess this was a real desire on my son&#39;s part. I<br/>
have not reminded him once or asked about his writing. Meanwhile, at<br/>
night before bed he&#39;s been copying poetry into his little notebook. He<br/>
just showed me the results the other day. His writing is looking<br/>
smaller and neater too, amazingly enough! He&#39;s really trying.<br/>
<br/>
My dd who has had a hard time reading (she&#39;s 8, almost 9) is suddenly<br/>
writing constantly using phonetics that she&#39;s made up, and they work.<br/>
The two of them have been staying up really late (which is hard on my<br/>
dh, he likes them in bed earlier). We&#39;ve been &quot;letting&quot; them stay up<br/>
(I would love to not even think about the bedtime issue but it&#39;s ben<br/>
an issue for my dh). But now, the two of them are so happily busy<br/>
after we&#39;re in bed and they&#39;re in their rooms alone or together, that<br/>
even my dh is seeing how beneficial it is to just let them sleep when<br/>
tired.<br/>
<br/>
I am getting a kick out of the ways they are &quot;doing schoolish things&quot;<br/>
withouth anyone askiing them to in the middle of the night. This is<br/>
what I&#39;ve always thought unschooling would be - a seamless whole - TV<br/>
all day, reading and writing all night. :) Seems to be working.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the support when I hit panic mode about once a month.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-256956995">Sorry about the typos! I forget to check my writing before I hit post.<br/>

and have lots of projects going (arts and crafts and X Box and<br/>
computer...) But they love TV in the heat of summer so there&#39;s lots of<br/>
that too.<br/>
