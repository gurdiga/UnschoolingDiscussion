<div id="ygrps-yiv-944681557">I&#39;m going back into Lurkdom now, since my true unschooling journey is only 6 months old, even though I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 9 years, and all nine have been stepping stones to where I am now...I still have much to learn from this list before I will feel comfortable commenting or offering my thoughts here.<br/>

Peace,<br/>
