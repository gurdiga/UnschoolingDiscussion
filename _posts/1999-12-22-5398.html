<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402483242">hi,<br/>
<br/>
this year i&#39;ve been focusing on aquiring a more conceptual understanding<br/>
of mathematic.  i know math is a perennial topic and has been covered at<br/>
great length in many many homeschool groups, but i want to understand<br/>
math beyond the popularly accepted notion of number crunching.   so this<br/>
email is for anyone interested in math as something like a &#39;science of<br/>
patterns&#39;, where numbers are just one on the many &#39;mathematical objects&#39;<br/>
used.<br/>
<br/>
i have a long way to go before i have any real grasp on this, but i<br/>
thought i should pass on what i&#39;ve found to date.<br/>
<br/>
first there are some very good software programs which i found (among<br/>
the miriade out there) that break away from the traditional approach to<br/>
math.<br/>
Like science, mathematics is taught more as an array of facts and<br/>
algorithms to memorize than as a habit of inquiry that includes<br/>
discussion, argument, and exploration.<br/>
programs we have and like are:<br/>
by lucas learning - pit droids & yoda&#39;s challenge<br/>
by broderbund - logical journey of the zoombini<br/>
i&#39;m sure there are more but so far this is what we have found.<br/>
<br/>
in the back of the pit droids &#39;owner&#39;s manual&#39;  there are some very<br/>
interesting web sites and i think that they are all well worth a look<br/>
(also free stuff available).<br/>

Perhaps one of the best-kept secrets about mathematics is that it is<br/>
easy to get a feel for the kinds of questions that are at the wide-open<br/>
frontiers of knowledge. We already know that students enjoy speculating<br/>
about what happened to the dinosaurs, pondering the shape of the<br/>
universe or imagining the Big Bang. We think that they can get as much<br/>
intriguing puzzlement from wondering about the size of infinity and<br/>
finding out that there are some very simple-sounding problems that would<br/>
take huge computers longer than the estimated age of the universe to<br/>
solve. We are concerned that so much of the ``good stuff&#39;&#39; doesn&#39;t make<br/>
it&#39;s way into the math classrooms until graduate school.   -mike<br/>
