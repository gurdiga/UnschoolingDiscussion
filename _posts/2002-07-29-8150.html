<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832334682">Hi  all,<br/>
<br/>
It has been 5 months now since we changed from structred school at home to unschooling.  The academic implications of this decision have been easy to adjust to; it is the extension of this philosophy into our every day life that is causing me concern.  <br/>
<br/>
I now allow my kids complete access to TV.  The problem is with my 7 year old son.  He has hardly come away from the TV for the past 5 months.  My expectations are reasonable; I think he would naturally want to watch TV if there is nothing more interesting to do.  But, I have exhausted my creative abilities in finding things that interest him.  I have taken the advice to do what interests me and the other kids, and  still, he cannot pull himself away form the tv.   He no longer wants me to read to him.  He absolutely refuses.  His personality is changing.  He has always been more intense than his sisters, but now he is completely unable to handle any stress or frustration.  He may run upstairs for a snack and find that his 2 year old sister has moved his booster seat to another chair at the table, and break into a screaming fit, teeth clenched, hands fisted, veins in neck extended.  This is just one example of mild stress that he cannot handle.  I cannot take him out often.  He is So extremely sensitive to the feel of clothes on his skin that NOTHING is comfortable.  So if it is a place that accepts no shirts, we are OK!<br/>
<br/>
At first I told myself he will learn from all he is experiencing; he will learn to take food when offered, so he won&#39;t become famished before breaking away from the tv for nourishment. (I do now let him eat at the tv)  I told myself he will become weak from lack of movement, and will naturally crave exercise or activity.  Has not happened.<br/>
<br/>
I try to join him at the tv when I can.  I have a 14 year old daughter with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome who is ill in bed and needs some attention, and then the two year old who naturally demands attention, and a 10 year old girl. So it is difficult to find the time to join him alone.  If I join him with  the others, he cannot handle the noise or distractuion of the two year old.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear how others have handled similar situations.  I want this to work.  I even believe it can, but we have to work through the rough patches. I believe the rough patches are where the discoveries and learning happen.  My biggest worry is wondering if having siblings that need my attention will hinder the process.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice or opinions will be appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I get the message, through your post, that you fret over his lack of<br/>
interaction away from the TV a lot.  This probably means that he is<br/>
getting the message as well.  It sounds as though he is asserting his<br/>
independence and right to choose via the TV by making a choice he knows<br/>
you don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that he would find other things more interested if he knew<br/>
you were not going to urge him to do so, no matter how subtilely. <br/>
Letting go of things like this, in  my opinion, is the hardest part of<br/>
unschooling for parents.  However, when you do let go it opens up a whole<br/>
new world for the entire family.<br/>
<br/>
Lanora resisted spelling and handwriting for a LONG time and it was due<br/>
to my fretting over them.  When I stopped, truly stopped (not even<br/>
fretting silently) she was free to explore them without my fingers on her<br/>
back.  She mastered them so fast it made my head spin and I wasn&#39;t<br/>
pleased because she knew them, I was pleased because she was enjoying it<br/>
so much.<br/>

<br/>
I trust that eventually Adam will come away from the TV at times, after I let go of my fears and subtle coercion.  But what I am most worried about is his change in personality, or the intensity of his personality.  I noticed it after he started watching so continuously.  It is not the TV watching I object to; it is the effect it has on his personality, and his lack of interest in other areas.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She mastered them so fast it made my head spin and I wasn&#39;t<br/>
pleased because she knew them, I was pleased because she was enjoying it so much.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love this statement!  I&#39;m fairly new to unschooling, but already my attitude has changed a lot towards this direction.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you have a VCR....and some NEW (to him) video<br/>
movies? Libraries have some...let him pick...you could<br/>
put some more on the stack.  You have to get out of<br/>

<br/>
Yes, if only we could get past the clothing sensitivity issue.  At first I thought I lucked out with a boy, saving money on his wardrobe as compared to his sisters.  I&#39;ve probably spent twice as much on him, trying to find comfortable clothes.  Right now he can wear Target bathing suits; I guess the mesh lining is soft enough. (It has to be the small mesh, though) That&#39;s all. Haven&#39;t found a shirt he can tolerate, besides the one tie dyed his two older sisters have gone through and passed down.  I  buy used so it&#39;s softer, but it is still difficult.  I&#39;ve tried turning them inside out..nothing helps.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You could have taken just a moment to hug him...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I did!  He is my most snuggly child. Now though, most snuggles take place first thing in the morning, or in front of the TV.  But they&#39;re still great!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you take a step it doesn&#39;t help to say &quot;I have 900,000 steps more to take and the last three haven&#39;t been so big.&quot;  Just take your best step.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess that is what I have to do, and trust things will eventually even out.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight he asked me to use the computer with him...Clue Finders.  He was frustrated at the dialogue when he was ready to continue.  He blurted out &quot;shut up!&quot; at the computer, a phrase he has NEVER used previously.  So, do I just assume some violence and negativity will be witnessed while watching TV, and this could be a good thing because it brings the issue to the forefront to be discussed?  In other words, instead of sheltering him, he sees things and we talk about it?  I want him to have choices in what he watches, not only when he watches.  Maybe I&#39;ll let him watch upstairs with the rest of the family at least some of the time, so I can be there to observe.  I just hate the 2 year old being enticed by it all the time when there are so many other interesting things she might choose.  Maybe she&#39;ll still choose them!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Tiffany is still in bed.  We see a new doc in a week...hoping he knows SOMETHING more than the ones we have already seen.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lisa, my older son, when we first began unschooling,<br/>
watched an unbelievable amount of TV and spent an<br/>
enormous amount of time being semi-inanimate :)<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion ... and what worked for my son ... is to<br/>
get him out of the house. There&#39;s no TV at the art<br/>
museum, the beach, the library, the zoo, the aquarium,<br/>
the park, or lots of other places. My son Andrew<br/>
really needed a change in environment to &quot;jump-start&quot;<br/>
some of his interests. Andrew is 12, and my younger<br/>
son Will is almost two, so it can sometimes be hard to<br/>
find places that are fun for both of them, but not<br/>
impossible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never personally heard of a kid who spent their<br/>
entire childhood doing nothing but watching TV. I<br/>
doubt your son will end up being the first :) But ...<br/>
TV&#39;s not all bad, in my opinion. My son still watches<br/>
more TV than I would personally choose for him, but he<br/>
actually learns quite a bit from TV. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s very mechanically inclined, and learns a lot from<br/>
Junkyard Wars that he applies to projects that he&#39;s<br/>
working on. We just got two new puppies, and he&#39;s been<br/>
learning about dog training on Animal Planet. He knows<br/>
all about Macchu Picchu (I&#39;m sure I blew the spelling<br/>
on that one ...) from a special on Discovery Channel.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you! I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll all work out, and,<br/>
left to explore their own interests in their own time,<br/>
your children will learn.<br/>
<br/>

Seven is very little.  They forget to eat until they&#39;re too hungry and<br/>
worn out.  Make him snacks when he&#39;s glued to something good and take<br/>
them to him and see that he gets something in him.  It will help.  His<br/>
personality is probably not changing, he&#39;s probably just worn out and<br/>
needs a little extra attention from you to make sure he&#39;s getting enough<br/>
to eat.  Honestly they forget to eat, and don&#39;t understand they&#39;re<br/>
feeling crabby and miserable because they need food. <br/>
<br/>
Did you go from a house where TV was very limited or forbidden to this<br/>
new unschooling freedom?   If so you&#39;ll have a process like deschooling. <br/>
Someone who wanted to watch TV but couldn&#39;t will watch a lot once they<br/>
can.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, when there is something difficult going on in a family ( a sibling<br/>
with fibromyalgia ) a well kid can get lost.  My son watched a lot of TV<br/>
when I was taking care of my dying father.  Sometimes that escape was<br/>
really what he needed.  Sometimes life in our house was just so sad he<br/>
needed to get away and TV took him where he needed to go.   I&#39;m glad it<br/>
was there for him to use when he needed it.<br/>
<br/>
Go places.  Take him away yourself if you can. Go out for a picnic every<br/>
weekend.  Go to the park one or two days a week.  Go see a friend or a<br/>
Grandma or the guy at the rock shop.  Go swimming, ride your bikes, or<br/>
what ever.  If he sees lots of things and places he&#39;ll know some of his<br/>
own world is just as interesting as the worlds on TV.   Get a trampoline<br/>
( man, I should get paid for promoting these things)  no one can think of<br/>
anything else when there&#39;s a trampoline in the yard.  Watch out, your<br/>
home owners insurance will go up!   <br/>
<br/>
What does he like to watch?    Can you link what he&#39;s watching to an<br/>
activity outside the house?   Can you go to a Nature Center or toy store<br/>
or whatever that has a tie in to what he&#39;s really liking on TV?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can find someone who will come and visit with your 14yo while<br/>
you take the other kids out.  I know she&#39;s stuck there but she&#39;s also old<br/>
enough to understand the little kids are stuck too, unless you can take<br/>
them away.  Find a friend who will come and visit her and get out as much<br/>
as you can.  <br/>
<br/>
If his world is a sick sister and a worried and stressed mom he&#39;s going<br/>
to look for a more interesting one on TV.   And I&#39;ll bet, from his<br/>
perspective your personality changed a lot when his sister went to bed<br/>
and didn&#39;t get up.  I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to blame TV when there are<br/>
other serious family factors.  <br/>
<br/>
I worried a lot about my little guy when I was taking care of my dad. <br/>
Just a few months after my dad died my father in law was very ill and we<br/>
were taking care of him.  He died only seven months after my dad and I<br/>
wondered if my little son would ever be able to sort through it all.  But<br/>
he did and he&#39;s wonderful.  Still you have to make an effort to get<br/>
friends over and get out and let him know he&#39;s just as important as the<br/>
sick person. <br/>
I know it&#39;s not easy.<br/>

Holly&#39;s toys are all new when another kid sees them that way.<br/>
<br/>
Marty can just sit and watch TV (seems to be &quot;just sitting&quot; from the outside) <br/>
but when he has company they play games or roller blade or joke and wrestle <br/>
and play with the dog.<br/>
<br/>
But around the strategies to give him opportunities, don&#39;t forget to support <br/>
him instead of criticizing him.  Maybe he is learning a gigantic amount from <br/>
what he&#39;s watching and what he&#39;s thinking, and your idea for how his life <br/>
should be isn&#39;t necessarily better than HIS idea.<br/>

<br/>
Lisa, I would really think about this.  I&#39;m thinking personality changes<br/>
have way more to do with how one feels physically and emotionally and NOT<br/>
what one is seeing on TV.  <br/>
What is he watching?   If it&#39;s troubling then he needs help from you to<br/>
understand.  If it&#39;s scary then he needs reassurance from you to feel<br/>
safe.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe I&#39;ll let him watch upstairs with the rest of the family at least<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some of the &gt;time, so I can be there to observe. <br/>
<br/>
This probably isn&#39;t the case but I&#39;m thinking dark and lonely basement. <br/>
That&#39;s horrible.<br/>
YES bring him upstairs and let him watch where&#39;s he&#39;s close to all the<br/>
lively action of the two year old and where he can ask questions and<br/>
where YOU can hear the TV and stop by and say &quot;Well, that guy sounds<br/>
mean, why would he say that?&quot;  Or whatever.   And where you can have a<br/>
better idea of when he needs something to eat, or a hug or whatever he<br/>
needs.  My husband sometimes shoots peanuts or popcorn into my son&#39;s<br/>
mouth from across the room.  This can be a funny and wiggly break from a<br/>
long TV session.   It&#39;s better if you have a dog or two who will gobble<br/>
up the misses.   He also comes in with the squirt gun sometimes and<br/>
THAT&#39;s some physical activity for you!   Maybe there&#39;s not another list<br/>
in the world that will tell you to shoot your child ...Just be ready for<br/>
the retaliation. ( I have banned the super soaker from the house. Man,<br/>
there&#39;s a lot of water in those things! )<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We do use one for his allergies. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he has allergies maybe they&#39;re not under control as well as you think<br/>
and he&#39;s feeling yucky and that&#39;s why he&#39;s acting crabby.  <br/>
Also, two year olds make grown up loving moms feel crabby sometimes, that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean moms personality is changing.   I say SHUT UP to the<br/>
computer every day.  I even smacked it this morning.  ( I hurt my hand! )<br/>
  I don&#39;t watch much TV.  At least not in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
My son likes to sleep with us.  He especially likes it when there&#39;s been<br/>
a lot of activity and we maybe haven&#39;t had as much close and snuggly time<br/>
as he usually gets.  Maybe you could tell him you&#39;ve been missing him and<br/>
see if he&#39;d like to sleep with you??  You&#39;ll have to get used to having<br/>
feet in your hair but if you have a two year old you most likely already<br/>
are.<br/>

Kirby was the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Now at 16 he wears nylon pants and camouflage pants that would bug the heck <br/>
out of me, no longer needs the tags cut out of his clothes (I still do, at <br/>
49; Holly does; Marty never has, he laughs at us), and can handle a lot of <br/>
change.  <br/>
<br/>
When he was little he didn&#39;t want rooms rearranged, dishes switched out, new <br/>
toothbrushes... Part of our clutter is he would accept a new thing as long as <br/>
the old one stayed too.<br/>
<br/>
He still owns some of his childhood clothing because he&#39;s unwilling not to <br/>
have it.<br/>
<br/>
But he&#39;s much easier-going than he used to be for SURE.<br/>

information for you - TV is probably not at all &quot;the cause&quot; of the <br/>
personality stuff -- it may be encouraging him to act it out more openly, <br/>
aggressively though. But - you wouldn&#39;t want to just stifle that - you want <br/>
that information. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like he has other major stuff going on. Do you ever have time to <br/>
really just BE with him? Without distraction? Even if what you do is watch TV <br/>
together? My gut feeling reaction is that he is really really needing <br/>
support.<br/>
<br/>
Read &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; -- you&#39;ll get a lot of great ideas there of how <br/>
you can support a kid who is difficult to live with.<br/>

Tiffany and Mariah sleep there with me, but I&#39;ll invite him to camp out on the floor, or put the baby on the futon for as long as she&#39;ll sleep there and have him in bed.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750009147">&lt;&lt;I trust that eventually Adam will come away from the TV at times, after<br/>
I let go of my fears and subtle coercion.  But what I am most worried<br/>
about is his change in personality, or the intensity of his personality. <br/>
I noticed it after he started watching so continuously.  It is not the TV<br/>
watching I object to; it is the effect it has on his personality, and his<br/>
lack of interest in other areas.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Jonathan first got his Nintendo and began to play the Zelda games<br/>
his personality became very intense and less aware of others around him. <br/>
He was impatient and hard to reason with.  I got a LOT of advice from<br/>
friends and family about how I should limit his exposure, even cut it off<br/>
entirely.  I listened to myself and what I&#39;ve learned from other<br/>
unschoolers which was that, if allowed to find his own way, he would find<br/>
a balance on his own.  It wasn&#39;t easy with others shaking their heads at<br/>
me and it felt like it would go on forever.<br/>
<br/>
If I had tried to control it for him it would have become a power<br/>
struggle and who knows HOW long it would have gone on.  Instead he found<br/>
his own balance, his behavior returned to peaceful and he realized that<br/>
the people around him were more fascinating and important.  This took<br/>
about two months but I&#39;m sure glad I stuck to my guns.  Now he has gained<br/>
the skills to prioritize what he values.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa, I&#39;m impressed by how open you are to all the advice you&#39;ve gotten<br/>
here, seems to me you&#39;re doing a great job, hang in there.  Unschooling<br/>
can seem so far off the beaten track at times and it feels like you&#39;re<br/>
&quot;way out there&quot; but it proves itself every time for me.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have another suggestion for the sensitivities-lots of big body movements. <br/>
Try reading the Out Of Sync Child by Carol Kranowitz. In fact, here&#39;s a <br/>
website introduction if you&#39;re interested. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.out-of-sync-child.com/introduction.html">http://www.out-of-sync-child.com/introduction.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also suggest Raising Your Spirited Child by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka.<br/>
<br/>
My Casey was born without a filter to outside sensory stimulation. Well, it <br/>
*seemed* that way to me anyway. ;-) Let&#39;s just say she was extremely <br/>
sensitive to everything external-light, sound, texture. All of it bothered <br/>
her and produced an extreme reaction.<br/>
<br/>
What seemed to help her (and me) most was lots of understanding, keeping the <br/>
environment from being too overwhelming for her if I could, and finding the <br/>
sensory input that help her integrate the best. This is not as compicated as <br/>
it sounds. Some kids seem to always be on their heads, some are always <br/>
swinging or hanging, some are jumping off the furniture and slamming around. <br/>
The idea is that they&#39;re looking for the sensory input that makes them feel <br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
For Casey it was swinging like a monkey. She was always hanging from stuff. <br/>
I started making sure she had every opportunity to do this. We got a chin up <br/>
bar so she could hang from the doorways. We went to the park to use the <br/>
monkey bars. She started gymnastics. The sensory input helped her feel <br/>
better which helped her behavior. Actually, any big body movement is a good <br/>
idea. It doesn&#39;t have to be much, but runnning, jumping, wheelbarrows <br/>
through the house, etc. spaced at regular intervals through the day can work <br/>
wonders. There are also calming techniques, deep pressure backrubs, etc. <br/>
(not much different from what we parents do anyway).<br/>
<br/>
I should point out that maturing into their own nervous systems works <br/>
wonders too. Casey rarely needs the tags cut out of her clothes anymore and <br/>
her explosive reactions are to a minimum a now. Yet another reason why...<br/>
<br/>
Life is good. :o)<br/>
