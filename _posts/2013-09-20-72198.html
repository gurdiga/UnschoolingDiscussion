<div id="ygrps-yiv-562829716">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
We are unschoolers, learn through life, observing our kids&#39; lives and I <br/>
admit I do suggest things....sometimes I direct what we&#39;ll do like let&#39;s <br/>
read this....but I wanted to respond to the thread about the 16 year old <br/>
as I also have a 16 year old who has been doing more household <br/>
activities than anything &quot;educational&quot;, and I do get concerned about the <br/>
diploma thing, too, but I have a friend who got hers after a few years <br/>
of having dropped high school - in fact, she gave us her books that she <br/>
had bought for a high school diploma course she completed by <br/>
correspondence. I figure if and when my teen decides to get a diploma <br/>
she can do it that way, and if she does decide to go to a college there <br/>
are many who accept homeschoolers - more all the time, I&#39;ll bet.<br/>
<br/>
I sure do understand the angst about what does she do all day....but <br/>
this very morning I was thinking how we have the wonderful freedom in <br/>
our family to sleep when our bodies want to, from waking to going to <br/>
bed, we don&#39;t schedule ourselves. My 16 year old looked at nutrition and <br/>
health over the last couple of years, (mostly trying to combat her acne) <br/>
- I do observe learning occurring and we have conversations about any <br/>
number of things, and we work on our attitudes and being thankful for <br/>
many things.<br/>
<br/>
Grateful for the support we share online!<br/>
<br/>
I am actually finally submitting our reports from last year and <br/>
registering for this year for ages 7, 9 and 16.<br/>
It is often a stressful time for me but I am going to submit what I have <br/>
written. I am grateful that in Nova Scotia, Canada, currently, there is <br/>
an examination of homeschooling in an open minded older provincial <br/>
educational program overseer, who met with homeschoolers last spring and <br/>
put our minds at ease about the attourney general&#39;s inspection of the <br/>
educational system and homeschooling! Gratefully we have the support of <br/>
the powers that be, who know something isn&#39;t working in school and are <br/>
willing to look at what we are doing with open mindedness. It helps me <br/>
to relax and go with the flow.<br/>
<br/>

Peace be with you!</div>
