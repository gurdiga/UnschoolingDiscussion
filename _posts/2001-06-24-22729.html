<br/>
Thank you so much for the book &quot;The First Year of Homeschooling Your <br/>
child&quot;!!  And thank you so much for letting me be a part of it!<br/>
<br/>
I had just arrived in Lake George, NY (where I&#39;ll be spending the <br/>
summer), after a two-week trip from Florida. My husband was already <br/>
here, and had brought up the mail that had piled up over the two <br/>
weeks. When I saw the book package, I was surprised, as I have been <br/>
trying to be good about not buying so many books (my addiction). And <br/>
imagine my surprise when I opened it, and realized it was the book to <br/>
which I had emailed a contribution over a year ago!<br/>
<br/>
I turned to my husband and said &quot;Did you see the book package?&quot; He <br/>
frowned and said he had, and I was pleased to tell him that not only <br/>
didn&#39;t I buy it, but that I/we were in it!<br/>
<br/>
It looks like a wonderful book (with all our unpacking I haven&#39;t had <br/>
a change to read it yet)!  I actually &quot;counsel&quot; homeschool moms <br/>
through our church, and I look forward to sharing it with them and <br/>
many other homeschool moms!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

The book is great!!!!!  Read mine from cover to cover.  Hubby is actually<br/>
reading it and he doesn&#39;t read &quot;that kind of stuff&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
