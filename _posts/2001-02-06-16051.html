<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137596248">Thanks for your quick reply. We have been always told taht in order for him<br/>
to really understand physics, he needs to have the higher math. Are you<br/>
saying he can learn the math that he needs to learn the science while he is<br/>
doing the science? And that while he is learning the science in effect he<br/>
will have learned the higher math? If so, then I am liking this better<br/>
already!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; So Algebra II, Trig and Calculus, I have no idea what they<br/>
are used for in the &quot;real world&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re used for science.  That&#39;s why all the science recommendations.<br/>
He&#39;ll<br/>
find/discover the math in there where it actually lives, rather than in a<br/>
math book!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pretty much.  A good deal of actual LEARNING come from a need to know <br/>
basis.  If he has a real interest in physics, he will learn the math he <br/>
needs.  It is all interconnected, and once he sees that, he will either <br/>
learn the math or find something else that interests him.  I was interested <br/>
in meteorology for a long time, but once I found out how much math was <br/>
really involved (talk about some ADVANCED calculus!), I decided that I <br/>
really did not want it that badly.  That might sound bad, but sometimes a <br/>
general interest in something is really not enough to carry you through to <br/>
a career.  But that is ok, it is better to find out early than spend four <br/>
years trying to get through it in college just to find out that you hate it!!<br/>

you have no real interest in the science you were building up to <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
There are websites galore about astronomy (electric astrolabe, and lots more) <br/>
and weather (intellicast.com) which would get him THINKING about what the <br/>
math is good for, because he could go a year or two without doing anything <br/>
that looked to you like math, and be gathering up a world (literally) of <br/>
understanding of the concepts.<br/>
