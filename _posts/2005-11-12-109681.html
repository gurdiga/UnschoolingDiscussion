Your resume is on a public web page, easily found with google.   You don&#39;t <br/>
have to leave it there, but you chose to do so.<br/>
<br/>
You were never disallowed to reply, though you reported falsely to another <br/>
list (with copies to this list&#39;s owners) that you had been banned from this <br/>
list.   That was a lie.<br/>
<br/>
Stop your unsolicited e-mails to members of this list.   You wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
had their addresses at all had you not joined the list.   I&#39;m asking you on <br/>

I&#39;m wondering why you&#39;re p.o.&#39;d about your resume being posted here if it&#39;s  <br/>
available for all to see online?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698426593">If Ms. Dodd finds my email treating or harassing, she or anyone,<br/>
need only send me a personal email stating that they no longer<br/>
wish to receive personal email, however this does not apply to<br/>
posts that you are free to filter or delete without reading them.<br/>
Ms. Dodd also does not have any right to speak univerially for<br/>
all members of this group.  <br/>
<br/>
The point of my email to Ms. Dodd about Pandora (the first <br/>
possibly being too poetic and abstract) was that controlling <br/>
what people read here is, in my opinion, unethical.  Allowing <br/>
children to make their own choices is the foundation of Unschooling.  <br/>
I believe that not allowing parents to see and choose among competing <br/>
alternatives is unethical.  <br/>
<br/>
So someone posted my vitae.  Anyone from this group could have<br/>
found it and more by clicking on my Yahoo id.  I&#39;m not attempting<br/>
to hide anything.  There are a few details that I&#39;ve not been<br/>
allowed to post and are not on my webpage:<br/>
<br/>
1. My personal experience with American public and private<br/>
schools have been overly negative.  I was held back in third<br/>
grade because I was not &quot;getting&quot; reading and as I discovered<br/>
later I&#39;m phonologically dyslexic.  I dropped out of high<br/>
school and later came back to higher education.<br/>
<br/>
2. I have both personal and professional interests in understanding<br/>
unschooling.  Personally, we are homeschooling two young children.<br/>
Professionally, I think that it&#39;s important to understand all<br/>
approaches to education.<br/>
<br/>
3. Although I am a graduate student in education, I have vocally<br/>
and publicly expressed my opposition to contemporary educational<br/>
methods and philosophies, which is not to say that I endorse<br/>
unschooling.  I see some value in unschooling, but I have a<br/>
number of reservations which I was trying to explore in this<br/>
group (which I believe was completely within the rules).<br/>
<br/>
It is unlikely that I will continue to pursue my questions<br/>
about unschooling in this group because my posts and replies<br/>
are selectively filtered.<br/>
<br/>

is welcome to join us in Homeschooling Discussions:<br/>

Had people come to a party at my house and you came because you heard the <br/>

effect, when you&#39;re e-mailing people off list, that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing.    <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it unethical for a periodical to have an<br/>
editorial policy and not publish every single<br/>
article that is submitted to it but only those<br/>
that meet its editorial standards? That&#39;s what&#39;s<br/>
going on here. There is no obligation for any<br/>
private publication or forum to allow absolutely<br/>
anything to be published. Different publications<br/>
will have different purposes in mind and publish<br/>
different content accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Censorship&quot; is more properly understood to be<br/>
something that governments do, by preventing<br/>
particular viewpoints or material to be released<br/>
into the public sphere altogether. If the owners<br/>
of this list were government officials and they<br/>
were successfully preventing the general public<br/>
from even finding out that some kids go to school<br/>
or learn from curricula, then you might have a<br/>
point. Since that&#39;s an extremely well-known fact<br/>
and in fact is common wisdom, it&#39;s a little<br/>
difficult to understood your complaint that<br/>
members of this list are somehow being denied<br/>
access to alternative viewpoints. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I believe that not allowing parents to see and<br/>
&gt; choose among competing <br/>
&gt; alternatives is unethical.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is crazy. Do you think this list is our only<br/>
source of information? Do you think we don&#39;t live<br/>
in the world, and see kids going off to school<br/>
everyday, and hear about how great school is and<br/>
how necessary formal education is to the<br/>
well-being of our children? Believe me, all of us<br/>
are well aware of exactly what the alternatives<br/>
to unschooling are. <br/>
<br/>
We deliberately chose to read this list as one<br/>
among many sources of information we have about<br/>
education, in order to receive more information<br/>
and support for our decision to unschool our<br/>
children. We didn&#39;t choose unschooling because we<br/>
didn&#39;t know about the alternatives. We&#39;re not<br/>
here to read about how great formal education is<br/>
-- we can read about that anywhere. It&#39;s just not<br/>
in the scope of this list to talk about that, any<br/>
more than it&#39;s in the scope of Popular Science to<br/>
discuss the value of creationism. It&#39;s an<br/>
editorial decision for the listowners to exclude<br/>
those kinds of posts, not an attempt at<br/>
censorship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695738969">***I have a number of reservations which I was trying to explore in this<br/>
group***<br/>
<br/>
People were trying to communicate with you, but it soon became clear you<br/>
were not asking questions to gain an understanding of unschooling, you<br/>
were asking questions to ferret out targets for your diatribe.  You<br/>
didn&#39;t come here in good faith. <br/>
<br/>
When specifically asked what you&#39;d like to know you said you didn&#39;t want<br/>
to hear about individual children but about unschoolers as a whole.  <br/>
&quot;The forest&quot; you said, not the trees.    The forest is made up of<br/>
individual, living, growing trees, not one kind of tree at one stage of<br/>
growth.   Without the trees there is no forest.  <br/>
<br/>
Without the individual stories of how unschooling children learn there is<br/>
no whole of unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
If you would participate in good faith and ask honest questions you&#39;d<br/>
find the list members here very generous.  But most members have endured<br/>
more than enough ill mannered nonsense from unschooling opponents they<br/>
don&#39;t want to see it here.  This isn&#39;t &quot;the opposition to unschooling&quot;<br/>
discussion  list.  This is a list for unschoolers to discuss the<br/>
philosophy in order to apply it&#39;s principles more deeply in their lives. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It would be very ill mannered to go to a vegetarian list and tell the<br/>
members they&#39;re sheltered because they don&#39;t know a whole world of tasty<br/>
critters exists out there.   It should occur to any thinking person that<br/>
they are vegetarians because they have chosen to stop eating meat.   <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers aren&#39;t unschoolers because they don&#39;t know about anything<br/>
else.  They&#39;re unschoolers because they know all too well the other<br/>
views.    <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read at your e-mail list and it&#39;s very clear you know almost nothing<br/>
about unschooling.   You&#39;ve written to list members privately to tell<br/>
them how sheltered and ignorant they are.   I&#39;m stunned at the rudeness<br/>
of it and since you&#39;ve tossed the word &quot;unethical&quot; around lately, I hope<br/>
you can take the high road here, ethically speaking and either leave<br/>
these good people in peace or participate with some dignity and<br/>
integrity. <br/>
