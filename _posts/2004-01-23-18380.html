<div id="ygrps-yiv-21503707">We just got a gamecube in October. My boys are 7 and 4 and at first<br/>
there were LOTS of arguments. What I did was to re-read my Siblings<br/>
without Rivalry for ideas. One that worked great for us was to let the<br/>
boys work out a decision...not have them set up hard and fast &quot;rules&quot;<br/>
(like time limits etc) but rather taking each disagreement individually.<br/>
Each circumstance will be different...Jason might be really working on<br/>
getting to a new level and need some uninterrupted non-sharing<br/>
time...Kyle may not want to play against Jason any more because he is<br/>
tired of loosing.<br/>
<br/>
If the boys seem to be arguing and not working it out, I will go in and<br/>
play facilitator. I have told them that if they want me to decide, I<br/>
can, but that means that 1 of them will be upset and that I think they<br/>
can come up with something better between themselves.  Then I start<br/>
helping them see the others point of view and putting their feelings<br/>
into words (especially my 4 yo)...saying things like, well, I think that<br/>
Kyle is upset because you have been on for a long time...I think that<br/>
Jason is worried that he will never get a turn if you play now...and I<br/>
have been pleasantly surprised at how much this has helped them work it<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing that I do if it looks like they are having a real tough<br/>
time and each kid is digging in, is I will offer other<br/>
alternatives...read a Calvin and Hobbes book to Jason, offer to play<br/>
playmobile with Kyle, basically sweeten the pot for one or the other (or<br/>
both and see who bites!). They still argue at times, but it has gotten<br/>
much better and I have heard them trying to reason with the other a bit<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it really helps to realize that there is no &quot;fair&quot; way to<br/>
divvy it up...because the kids needs/desires to play are different at<br/>
different times...sometimes even if Jason has been playing for a really<br/>
long time, he will be right in the middle of section and it would not be<br/>
fair to make him stop (kind of like if my dh said that I had to put my<br/>
book down at a really great part).<br/>
<br/>
On this same topic...anyone have any suggestions on how to help the<br/>
younger brother who can never beat his older brother? I have been<br/>
talking with Jason about keeping Kyle&#39;s feelings in mind, but he is very<br/>
competitive and does not want to let his little brother to win. I try to<br/>
play with Kyle several times a day so that he can beat me, but I feel so<br/>
bad for him sometimes...he gets frustrated and calls himself a loser. It<br/>
has gotten so Kyle goes through phases of not wanting to play anything<br/>
with Jason..card games, board games, they even fight over winning<br/>
cooperative board games!<br/>

<br/>
If the computer is new, their interest in using it so much may be short <br/>
lived.  When we first got at home internet access, all my 5 kids wanted to use the <br/>
computer all day!  Now it is used on a daily basis only by Emily and me.  The <br/>
other kids get into it for a while, but then get busy with other things.  <br/>
Antonio would much rather spend his time on the PS2.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a very old computer that we were able to get for free that we <br/>
use only for word processing, record keeping, and a few simple games.<br/>
<br/>
Our system is that when someone wants to use the computer they ask whoever is <br/>
using it to tell them when they&#39;re done.  In general, the person using it <br/>
then hurries up and finishes, especially if they&#39;ve been on it a long time.  We <br/>
use the same system with the PS2.  It seems to work well for us!<br/>

Maybe you could see if there&#39;s a game that he really likes to play that his <br/>
brother doesn&#39;t.  If he played it a lot, he would get good at it...better than <br/>
his brother most likely since his brother wouldn&#39;t be playing it.  In our <br/>
house there are a few games that the 5yo is better at than the 15yo simply because <br/>
she plays them so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543235336">I have found it depends on the child & their interest.<br/>
My husband builds computers so now all the kids have their own. Before, our<br/>
oldest was on more only because she knew how to navigate better and was more<br/>
interested in it. Our middle child only liked to play games so he was on<br/>
rest of the time. Our youngest didn&#39;t have much interest.<br/>
