Welcome!<br/>
This is a wonderful place to learn about unschooling. Generally, we suggest <br/>
that all new members read for at least two weeks before hopping into the <br/>
discussion, so that they can get a good feel for the list.<br/>
Read at &lt;A HREF=&quot;www.unschooling.com&quot;&gt;www.unschooling.com&lt;/A&gt; just go to the message boards, click topics, and <br/>
just put in a word you may be interested in, like unschooling science or <br/>
reluctant family members. There is also Sandra&#39;s website: &lt;A HREF=&quot;www.sandradodd.com&quot;&gt;www.sandradodd.com&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Nice to meet you.. Obviously, Ive come to this list while you were gone.  How <br/>
long were you gone?   I wonder if this list changed a lot while you were <br/>
gone.  The above copied post IS typical around here.  I think its a warning <br/>
for folks to be ready to defend themselves if they step out of line too soon. <br/>
  Basically, I think a few folks want new members to read posts and decide if <br/>
they want to be on &quot;thier&quot; team or not.    I&#39;ve stuck around because I HAVE <br/>
found some very useful information here and some great folks too.  I&#39;ll never <br/>
be a member of the tea party, but thats OK..  Conformity is not my bag, <br/>
baby.. :-)    It&#39;s become sort of a sift and discard process for me.    Hey, <br/>
Im sure Im not the only new member to join in your absence, so, why dont you <br/>
tell us a little about yourself?   I know you just moved to Alaska.. dish out <br/>
some more 411.(please)<br/>

using YahooGroups anywhere? Something we could send to new <br/>
subscribers to help them get a jumpstart on all the best features? I <br/>
need to do some list maintenance tonight... I&#39;ll do some poking <br/>
around, but if anyone knows of something already available I&#39;d sure <br/>
love to know about it (needs to be something that won&#39;t be a breach <br/>
of copyright). Or if there isn&#39;t anything out there maybe we could <br/>
all put our heads together and create one. Seems like something we <br/>
could make available on all our lists as a free public service or <br/>
something. I know it&#39;s taken me a long time to figure out what I know <br/>
about Yahoo&#39;s list services, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more I could <br/>
benefit from, helpful little tips and tricks, if I knew about them. <br/>
Of course it&#39;s all right there online at the Yahoo site - but who has <br/>
time to read *that?* &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Seriously, I&#39;ve been doing a lot of travelling this past year between <br/>
our home in Washington state and our eventual home here in Alaska. We <br/>
bought five acres up here last fall, and my 22-year-old daughter and <br/>
I left Washington around the first week of December and have been <br/>
camping in motels and with relatives until just this week, when we <br/>
found a terrific little log cabin (with all the modern conveniences, <br/>
of course) to rent until we get our house built. My husband Mark and <br/>
our youngest son, Michael (17) are holding down the fort in <br/>
Washington, keeping our business running and feeding our small herd <br/>
of horses. Our office manager gets home from her holiday vacation <br/>
next week and then Mark and Michael will either fly or drive up here.<br/>

We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the <br/>

questioning beliefs to their foundations. If you have questions about this <br/>

&lt;&lt;  Basically, I think a few folks want new members to read posts and decide <br/>
if <br/>
they want to be on &quot;thier&quot; team or not.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty, my thirteen year old, said one day when I interjected something into a <br/>
conversation, &quot;Fifteen minute rule, mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You should listen to a conversation for fifteen minutes so you know how it&#39;s <br/>
going before you join.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Turns out what I had said wasn&#39;t to the point, and I had misinterpreted <br/>
something I heard out of context.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t ever heard of any &quot;fifteen minute rule,&quot; but apparently Marty&#39;s <br/>
uncle talked to him about it one time, with them telling some stories, and <br/>
Marty has observed it since.  <br/>
<br/>
The analogy I am familiar with and which has always made sense to me is going <br/>
to a party (not a tea party) and watching and listening a while to see what&#39;s <br/>
going on before interrupting any conversations or making any announcements.  <br/>
It depends how well I know the people, but even with family and best friends <br/>
I try to check the rhythm and flow of the communication before I join.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ll never <br/>
be a member of the tea party, but thats OK.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think of tea party lists as those where people (women, always) gush about <br/>
every little thing.  Someone mentions a dog and it&#39;s (sight unseen) &quot;How <br/>
CUTE!&quot; or the mom talks about her method of discipline and the others say <br/>
she&#39;s a great mom and knows her kids best and they&#39;re lucky to have a mom who <br/>
cares enough to ground/spank/punish them.   Some people seem to really like <br/>
those lists.  I think they could be automated.  A search function to look for <br/>
&quot;dog&quot; or &quot;teenager&quot; or &quot;homework&quot; and generate some gooey mushy response.  <br/>
<br/>
Neopets does that.  I&#39;ve been on Neopets because my kids were and they showed <br/>
me a game.  I&#39;ve been helping Holly with some stuff.  If you play with the <br/>
Neopet you&#39;ve made he says you&#39;re wonderful and he&#39;s having fun.  It actually <br/>
does feel kinda good for him to say &quot;Oh boy!&quot; or &quot;Yummy!&quot; or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there are a thousand people on this list, so if my unschooling <br/>
defense is considered too harsh by one or two of them, the other 900x can <br/>
pick up the tea-party slack if they want to, and post mushy innocuous things.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> You know &quot;tea party&quot; is a bad analogy.  Some time back, someone else also <br/>
used the analogy of  being at a party .. and new members sort of &quot;crashing&quot; <br/>
it.  Your right, it not a tea party.  But, as you and others have so often <br/>
pointed out. It IS a party.   And you have to pass the test to be invited.   <br/>
Is it rude to &quot;crash&quot; a party or a conversation??  Does one have to sit back <br/>
and wait to be invited to join in?  That is a statement open for debate.    <br/>
Many members here have often said &quot;if you post something publically, then you <br/>
should expect folks to respond&quot;  OK.. agreed 100%.. but does that mean, only <br/>
folks who have been here a certain amount of time?  OH yes, Im sorry, it <br/>
does.. Because folks who have not been here long enough may cause detriment <br/>
to the fortitude of  the UNSCHOOLING PHILOSOPHY  as interpreted by some on <br/>
this group.<br/>
<br/>
  The last thing I want is to be coddled.  Some folks have tactful, actually <br/>
HELPFUL ways of offering advice and insight.  It&#39;s not sugar coated or <br/>
intended to pacify, its offered in genuine good will towards folks who <br/>
need/want/request input from others.   I daresay no one joins this group for <br/>
a &quot;feel good&quot; IM OK YOUR OK type of forum.  Although courtesy and maturity is <br/>
most likely expected.   I also believe that no one joins to be insulted,  <br/>
ignored, accused, and otherwise treated inferior.   <br/>

routinely without thinking.  It&#39;s not on automatic.   If someone tells a <br/>
story of something I actually think is cool, I might say so.  If someone <br/>
tells a story I think is not only not cool, but potentially harmful to their <br/>
children and counter to productive unschooling, I will *NOT* say cool.<br/>
<br/>
I think it comes under analytical thought, and honesty.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not innocuous if it makes sense.  It&#39;s innocuous if someone ALWAYS says <br/>
something positive no matter how much she disagrees.  This list has never <br/>
been that way, but I&#39;ve seen some where it seems that&#39;s the pattern for <br/>
participating.  And when I&#39;ve been on such a list, and read a while before <br/>
joining, I&#39;ve always decided NOT to stay and waste time sugaring other people <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You ARE mushy and innocuous concerning things and folks that you approve <br/>
of.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is being mushy and innocuous concerning things and folks they do <br/>
*NOT* approve of, they&#39;re dishonest and not too bright.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is providing positive input about things and situations (I know <br/>
very few of these folks as folks) they &quot;approve of,&quot; that&#39;s honest <br/>
communication and should be encouraged.<br/>

need to do some list maintenance tonight... I&#39;ll do some poking <br/>
around, but if anyone knows of something already available I&#39;d sure <br/>
love to know about it (needs to be something that won&#39;t be a breach <br/>
of copyright). Or if there isn&#39;t anything out there maybe we could <br/>
all put our heads together and create one. Seems like something we <br/>
could make available on all our lists as a free public service or <br/>
something. I know it&#39;s taken me a long time to figure out what I know <br/>
about Yahoo&#39;s list services, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more I could <br/>
benefit from, helpful little tips and tricks, if I knew about them. <br/>
Of course it&#39;s all right there online at the Yahoo site - but who has <br/>
time to read *that?* &lt;g&gt;<br/>

the best your gonna get.. As far as searching archives.  ( you may already <br/>
know this, so dont think I think your inept.. lol... its something I didnt <br/>
know til I accidentally figured it out.. which is how I learned most about <br/>
yahoogroups..) Anyway.. when searching archives.. if you put the word, <br/>
phrase, whatever, you are looking for in the search box... you will get a <br/>
page of returns.. ( or maybe not. .maybe it says &quot;no posts met your <br/>
criteria.. blah blah blah)  BUT, that is only a search part of the messages!  <br/>
You  have to hit next or previous to get the next set of returns.   It <br/>
depends on where you are in the archives when you start your search whether <br/>
to hit next or prev.  If you are at the most recent messages ( last) and you <br/>
start your search, then keep hitting prev til you find what your looking <br/>
for.. If you go to the beginning ( first ) of the archives, then continue <br/>
hitting &quot;next&quot; til you find what you need.  I&#39;ve been involved with Yahoo <br/>
groups for a few years.. Owned and moderated a few.. so,  if I can help, <br/>
please let me know.. :-)<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;  Basically, I think a few folks want new members to read posts and decide <br/>
if <br/>
they want to be on &quot;thier&quot; team or not.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty, my thirteen year old, said one day when I interjected something into a <br/>
conversation, &quot;Fifteen minute rule, mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You should listen to a conversation for fifteen minutes so you know how it&#39;s <br/>
going before you join.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Turns out what I had said wasn&#39;t to the point, and I had misinterpreted <br/>
something I heard out of context.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t ever heard of any &quot;fifteen minute rule,&quot; but apparently Marty&#39;s <br/>
uncle talked to him about it one time, with them telling some stories, and <br/>
Marty has observed it since.  <br/>
<br/>
The analogy I am familiar with and which has always made sense to me is going <br/>
to a party (not a tea party) and watching and listening a while to see what&#39;s <br/>
going on before interrupting any conversations or making any announcements.  <br/>
It depends how well I know the people, but even with family and best friends <br/>
I try to check the rhythm and flow of the communication before I join.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ll never <br/>
be a member of the tea party, but thats OK.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think of tea party lists as those where people (women, always) gush about <br/>
every little thing.  Someone mentions a dog and it&#39;s (sight unseen) &quot;How <br/>
CUTE!&quot; or the mom talks about her method of discipline and the others say <br/>
she&#39;s a great mom and knows her kids best and they&#39;re lucky to have a mom who <br/>
cares enough to ground/spank/punish them.   Some people seem to really like <br/>
those lists.  I think they could be automated.  A search function to look for <br/>
&quot;dog&quot; or &quot;teenager&quot; or &quot;homework&quot; and generate some gooey mushy response.  <br/>
<br/>
Neopets does that.  I&#39;ve been on Neopets because my kids were and they showed <br/>
me a game.  I&#39;ve been helping Holly with some stuff.  If you play with the <br/>
Neopet you&#39;ve made he says you&#39;re wonderful and he&#39;s having fun.  It actually <br/>
does feel kinda good for him to say &quot;Oh boy!&quot; or &quot;Yummy!&quot; or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there are a thousand people on this list, so if my unschooling <br/>
defense is considered too harsh by one or two of them, the other 900x can <br/>
pick up the tea-party slack if they want to, and post mushy innocuous things.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought a piece of a post I got on another list may be appropriate <br/>
here. It&#39;s from Benjamin Franklin&#39;s Biography:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My list of virtues contained at first but twelve; but<br/>
a Quaker friend having kindly informed me that I was<br/>
generally thought proud, that my pride showed itself<br/>
frequently in conversation, that I was not content<br/>
with being in the right when discussing any point, but<br/>
was overbearing and rather insolent, of which he<br/>
convinced me by mentioning several instances, I<br/>
determined to endeavor to cure myself, if I could, of<br/>
this vice or folly among the rest; and I added<br/>
humility to my list, giving extensive meaning to the<br/>
word.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the<br/>
reality of this virtue, but I had a good deal with<br/>
regard to the appearance of it.  I made it a rule to<br/>
forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of<br/>
others and all positive assertion of my own.  I even<br/>
forbid myself, agreeably to the old laws of our Junto,<br/>
the use of every word or expression in the language<br/>
that imported a fixed opinion; such as certainly,<br/>
undoubtedly, etc., and I adopted instead of them, I<br/>
conceive, I comprehend, or I imagine, a thing to be so<br/>
or so; or it so appears to me at present.  When<br/>
another asserted something that I thought an error, I<br/>
denied myself the pleasure of contradicting him<br/>
abruptly and of showing immediately some absurdity in<br/>
his proposition; and in answering I began by observing<br/>
that in certain cases or cercumstances his opinion<br/>
would be right, but in the present case there appeared<br/>
or seemed to me some difference, etc.  I soon found<br/>
the advantage of this change in my manners; the<br/>
conversations I engaged in went on more pleasantly. <br/>
The modest way in which I proposed my opinions<br/>
procured them a readier reception and less<br/>
contradiction; I had less mortification when I was<br/>
found to be in the wrong; and I more easily prevailed<br/>
with others to give up their mistakes and join with me<br/>
when I happened to be in the right.<br/>
<br/>
And this mode, which I at first put on with some<br/>
violence to natural inclination, became at length easy<br/>
and so habitual to me that perhaps for the last fifty<br/>
years no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression<br/>
escape me.  And to this habit (after my character of<br/>
integrity) I think it principally owing that I had<br/>
early so much weight with my fellow citizens when I<br/>
proposed new institutions or alterations in the old;<br/>
and so much influence in public councils when I became<br/>
a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent,<br/>
subject to much hesitation in my choice of words,<br/>
hardly correct in language, and yet I generally<br/>
carried my point.<br/>
<br/>
In reality there is, perhaps, no one of our natural<br/>
passions so hard to subdue as pride.  Disguise it,<br/>
struggle with it, stifle it, mortify it as much as one<br/>
pleases, it is still alive and will every now and then<br/>
peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps,<br/>
often in this history.  For even if I could conceive<br/>
that I had completely overcome it, I should probably<br/>
be proud of my humility.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The suggestion isn&#39;t meant to benefit the list. It&#39;s meant to benefit people<br/>
who join. Every group -- on line or IRL -- has a tone and style. Not every<br/>
tone and style suits everyone. It just makes sense to get a feel for the<br/>
atmosphere so someone can figure out if this list is worth their time or<br/>
not. That suggestion, or other parts of the introduction, have cut down on<br/>
the number of people who thought unschooling was synonomous with<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OH yes, Im sorry, it<br/>
&gt; does..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sarcasm rarely enlightens and usually angers the people it seems directed<br/>
at. Sarcasm can feel like a satisfying release but if someone is posting<br/>
with the intent to find a solution to a problem they&#39;re having, I&#39;ve never<br/>
seen it do anything other than make matters worse. If they&#39;re posting to<br/>
increase a problem, I&#39;d rather they set the post aside for a day to decide<br/>
away from the heat of the moment whether it really needs said or not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because folks who have not been here long enough may cause detriment<br/>
&gt; to the fortitude of  the UNSCHOOLING PHILOSOPHY  as interpreted by some on<br/>
&gt; this group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easier to discuss such observations at the time rather than try to<br/>
discuss generalized observations after the fact. Then people can explain<br/>
what and why they believe something is a detriment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I daresay no one joins this group for<br/>
&gt; a &quot;feel good&quot; IM OK YOUR OK type of forum.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People join a list for lots of reasons. Sometimes it is to find an &quot;IM OK<br/>
YOUR OK type of forum&quot;. The new introduction seems to have helped people<br/>
steer clear of this type of list when they were looking for something else.<br/>

<br/>
And yet that doesn&#39;t help people to recognize that the way they learned in the<br/>
past wasn&#39;t necessarily the best or the only way to learn. I think we parents<br/>
learn more asking ourselves new questions rather than patting ourselves on the<br/>
back and assuring ourselves that increasing our comfort level is what being a<br/>
parent is *really* all about.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the problem with seeing that sometimes is that we were trained<br/>
like cute little seals as children to perform for our own teachers and<br/>
parents; so *that&#39;s* how we view success. Letting go of those preconceptions<br/>
so own children can define their own success is really hard.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only purpose I can think of for posting this at this time is as a<br/>
suggestion that some people need to take Ben&#39;s advice and do as he did.<br/>
<br/>
That might be appropriate on a list where people are asking for help<br/>
changing how they relate to others. But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s an unschooling list<br/>
were people come to talk about and get help understanding unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As long as people are giving sound unschooling advice in a way that greatly<br/>
benefits some people, isn&#39;t it arrogant to presume that they need to change<br/>
because we don&#39;t like the way they are?<br/>
<br/>
Someone recommended a book that I wish I could remember the title of where<br/>
the author said there were 3 things that were sources of anger and<br/>
frusration: acts of God/nature, other people and ourselves. It&#39;s only<br/>
ourselves that we have any control over. Getting stressed because nature or<br/>
other people aren&#39;t behaving as we wish they would or think they should<br/>
fills us full of negative energy that has only a negative effect on us and<br/>
those around us.<br/>
<br/>
That might be seen as a suggestion that people should change. I hope it&#39;s<br/>
seen as a suggestion on how to get off this negative path and back on the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192927622"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I thought a piece of a post I got on another list may be appropriate<br/>
&gt; here. It&#39;s from Benjamin Franklin&#39;s Biography<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;The only purpose I can think of for posting this at this time is as a<br/>
suggestion that some people need to take Ben&#39;s advice and do as he did.<br/>
<br/>
That might be appropriate on a list where people are asking for help<br/>
changing how they relate to others. But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s an unschooling list<br/>
were people come to talk about and get help understanding unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Joyce, I know I am always talking about things that don&#39;t seem *appropriate* to this list, but I thought Ben&#39;s words would be appropriate for some, if not most of us (aside the fact that I think it&#39;s a cool quote anyways), before we start again on the road to arguing, labeling, pointing fingers or insulting.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That might be seen as a suggestion that people should change. I hope it&#39;s<br/>
seen as a suggestion on how to get off this negative path and back on the<br/>
path to discussing unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was no suggestion whatsoever. It made me think when I read it, and I thought it would be thought provoking for other people as well. Sorry if it&#39;s not about unschooling per se. To me, unschooling also encompasses an internal process where I *unschool* myself from my preconceived ideas and fixed notions, or repetitive responses to others and life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen discussions here that are not about unschooling... which men/actors are &quot;doable&quot; and which aren&#39;t, what actors are sexy, etc. Anyway, perhaps I should just go to lurk mode now.<br/>
