&lt;&lt; There are always a few levels of humor going<br/>
on, which I like now and remember liking as a kid when I watched Rocky and<br/>
Bullwinkle.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I were discussing this just the other day, about Bugs Bunny <br/>
cartoons.  There&#39;s one level of physical humor for little kids, and the other <br/>
script-stuff (and some quiet sight-gags) are for adults.<br/>
<br/>
We also discussed Rocky and Bullwinkle (and related cartoons--George of the <br/>
Jungle, Super Chicken, that set).   He&#39;s really liking seeing things again <br/>
now that he&#39;s older.<br/>
