 </span></blockquote>I truely believe that any child will thrive without school,  <br/>
possibly even more so children like yours who are often bored.<br/>
You may find that he has more attention span than you think once he&#39;s <br/>
doing what he really enjoys.  My son has no desire to pay attention <br/>
to things that don&#39;t interest him.  As far as math books and brain <br/>
teasers.  We have used these types of things.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean that you can&#39;t use anything, even text books.  Anything can be a <br/>
resource.  The difference is that the child can decide what to use, <br/>
when and how much.  <br/>
<br/>
Since your son has been in school,  he&#39;ll probably need what we call <br/>
deschooling time - time to recover from school and get used to what <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; is for your family.  When we first took my son out of <br/>
school at 10,  he worried that he wasn&#39;t doing enough, that he needed <br/>
to take spelling tests, etc.  I had to work to convince him at the <br/>
same time I was reassuring myself that this would work.  Now at 13,  <br/>
he never needs reassurance, but sometimes I still do.  Sometimes,  <br/>
when deschooling,  parents become concerned about the  amount of tv <br/>
watched, video games played,  and the amount of time spent doing what <br/>
appears to be nothing.  It passes.  Be patient,  and he&#39;ll find his <br/>
way back to a genuine love of learning.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t thing there is a *type* that thrives without school.  Any child will <br/>
thrive without school.  Don&#39;t let that short attention span fool you.  A busy <br/>
child thinks constantly.  And you can&#39;t know WHAT they are thinking about.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;m had the kids running all over the house while I <br/>
was reading or doing something.  Knowing absoluteley they were not paying <br/>
attention.  Only later to have them come up and discuss the entire plot of <br/>
the book. <br/>
<br/>
Are you doing the all natural, I think I&#39;ll panic for awhile?  I do, and I&#39;ve <br/>
been at this for a few years.  It&#39;s normal, and I&#39;d say healthy....  You&#39;ll <br/>
be fine..  And so will that little guy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636195835">The world contains more than enough chaos to provide stimulation.  The chaos of<br/>
schools is contrived at best.  Sadly a lot of that chaos is the result of<br/>
unhappy interactions of kids who are little better than prisoners.....taking out<br/>
their frustration on those weaker than themselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome to the list, Susan!  In my experience, a child like this can thrive<br/>
as an unschooler.  Boredom is great!  They figure out how to create their<br/>
own chaos!  The attention span issue may resolve itself when he has the time<br/>
to devote to activities of his own choosing.  I think the short attention<br/>
span also signifies a passion for covering a lot of ground.  They are making<br/>
amazing connections even while it seems their attention is merely cursory.<br/>
While this can look like a lack of focus, it is actually a matter of paying<br/>
attention to something else.  After unschooling for 1 1/2 years, our 8yo dd<br/>
is thriving.  Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like my son in a lot of ways -- what works here (so far -- he&#39;s only <br/>
6):  We read and play computer games and do puzzles and mazes and math type <br/>
games and real math workbooks and flashcards and go outside and bird watch <br/>
and read about lizards and and and and  -- but it&#39;s not on any time table -- <br/>
it&#39;s as things come up -- on demand, just like food.  The kitchen&#39;s a mess <br/>
and so is my living room most of the time but we do a lot and have &quot;school <br/>
work&quot; input when desired and just figure things out ourselves when desired.   <br/>
And I personally think that, if you haven&#39;t been taught to hate workbooks and <br/>
text books, they can be enjoyed just as well as any other source of info.   <br/>
But with a 6-year-old&#39;s attention span and a 9-year-old&#39;s reading <br/>
comprehension and an 8-year-old&#39;s computation ability but a 10-year-old&#39;s <br/>
grasp of math concepts and all of this changing constantly, I think you kind <br/>
of have to go with the flow.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the things I like about unschooling, is that there seems to be <br/>
a great tolerance for just doing what works.   Some people seem to be more or <br/>
less un, but I think we all just want to do the best we can.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

Hi and welcome!<br/>
My youngest ds sounds a lot like yours! LOL, He would be labeled and sorted <br/>
so fast your head would spin, but, he is so smart!  He is what I call a <br/>
parallel learner, he taught himself to read, by listening to me teach his <br/>
older brother, while he played.  Today, he is still learning  by taking <br/>
things in while playing with his toys.  His imagination is extraordinary, and <br/>
he can remember every line of every cartoon and movie he has ever seen.  <br/>
Also, all his favorite characters in the Narnia chronicles.  He has to be <br/>
kept busy and we do that with sports, music and make believe.  Anyway, what <br/>
we do is not so important, its just that I wanted to tell you that yes, you <br/>
can do just fine at home.  Also, there is a great book by Cynthia Tobias, <br/>
called &quot;The Way They Learn&quot;  She is so funny, and the book is too. You would <br/>
really like it and get some insight into our different learners! LOL.<br/>

this all summer and they still only want to play!  One bright spot, I bought <br/>
the two Harry Potter books and read them one chapter a night.  My oldest <br/>

he couldn&#39;t wait.  So, I know that if I can find the things they want to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935645786">Thank you to everyone!  I feel &quot;understood&quot; and that means a lot to me.  I<br/>
have no one to really bounce situations, concerns or questions from, so this<br/>
list will come in very handy indeed!<br/>
<br/>
I also work from home and was/is concerned that I wouldn&#39;t be there enough<br/>
for him emotionally/intellectually at all the right times.. etc... but<br/>
perhaps I should not fret. (?)<br/>
<br/>
You are right he certainly does create his very own chaos (enough for both<br/>
of us).  I am quite disenchanted with the way &quot;school&quot; works, the things<br/>
that go on etc... My son was in a very small, community oriented school.<br/>
The average Joe would consider it heaven for their child but my son just did<br/>
not think &quot;within the box&quot; so to speak and it frustrated his teachers<br/>
terribly.  He can do academic work three grades ahead but they would not<br/>
allow him the challenge because he wouldn&#39;t complete his grade 2 work on<br/>
time if at all - he was bored with it - so on went a vicious circle....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m rambling, and I thank you for all of the insightful feedback,<br/>
I&#39;ve saved it and will re-read them again for reassurance :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It varies from child to child,  but I&#39;ve heard it said that it takes <br/>
1 month of deschooling for every month in school, or in your case - <br/>
school at home.  It took my kids quite a while.  My 13 year old still <br/>
spends a lot of time playing,  but from other homeschoolers,  I&#39;ve <br/>
learned that it&#39;s quite common at this age.  Their bodies are <br/>
changing so fast, hormones are running rampant - sometimes it&#39;s all <br/>
they can do to just exist.  A long time unschooler told me that this <br/>
is one of the reasons middle schools don&#39;t introduce new information <br/>
at this age.  I think you&#39;re on the right track.  I often show <br/>
interest in something in front of my son,  or just leave things I <br/>
think he might be interested in laying around.  I know of one <br/>
unschooler that puts interesting posters and reading material in the <br/>
bathroom.  Whatever works is our motto......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013351694">I just wanted to add another resource for people with &quot;active&quot; learners. Howard<br/>
Gardner wrote several books about different intelligences and how the different<br/>
intelligences learn. It is slowly making its way through the ps system and<br/>
hopefully things will change, but his books are interesting to read. According to<br/>
his theory, it sounds like your children are kinesthetic learners, they have to<br/>
be physically active in order to absorb information and learn. He lays out 7<br/>
total intelligences and they make sense. I think that even 7 is too limiting;)<br/>

&gt; Hi and welcome!<br/>
&gt; My youngest ds sounds a lot like yours! LOL, He would be labeled and sorted<br/>
&gt; so fast your head would spin, but, he is so smart!  He is what I call a<br/>
&gt; parallel learner, he taught himself to read, by listening to me teach his<br/>
&gt; older brother, while he played.  Today, he is still learning  by taking<br/>
&gt; things in while playing with his toys.  His imagination is extraordinary, and<br/>
&gt; he can remember every line of every cartoon and movie he has ever seen.<br/>
&gt; Also, all his favorite characters in the Narnia chronicles.  He has to be<br/>
&gt; kept busy and we do that with sports, music and make believe.  Anyway, what<br/>
&gt; we do is not so important, its just that I wanted to tell you that yes, you<br/>
&gt; can do just fine at home.  Also, there is a great book by Cynthia Tobias,<br/>
&gt; called &quot;The Way They Learn&quot;  She is so funny, and the book is too. You would<br/>
&gt; really like it and get some insight into our different learners! LOL.<br/>

Just a quick thought.  I&#39;m a vet unschooler but new to this list and I have been experiencing a little chaos of my own (computer chaos that is).  At any rate, this is my first op to speak up.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402666565"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: &quot;Susan Wilkins-Hubley&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:swclub@...">swclub@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Susan!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote> I decided this because I found that the school and the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; teachers did not understand my son the way I do, it was just a<br/>
&gt; matter of his learning style and whether it fit into the way they<br/>
&gt; did things.  Well it didn&#39;t - so here I am :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My son turned 3 in May and this is one of the same reasons that <br/>
keeps shouting &quot;homeschool/unschool&quot; to me.  He is very bright and high <br/>
in energy with a learning style that is not typically accomodated by <br/>
the majority of schools.   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; My question to any of you is.....  is a child who has absolutely NO<br/>
&gt; attention span and who is conversely brilliant - the child who<br/>
&gt; thrives without school?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My personal opinion would be absolutely yes.  first of all, if he <br/>
brilliant, he probably doesn&#39;t need an attention span of more than a <br/>
few seconds to learn something new.  he&#39;s probably also intelligent <br/>
enough to realize that &quot;okay, i&#39;ve learned this, no point in wasting <br/>
time dwelling on it, time to go learn something else!&quot;  you can go <br/>
with that flow while the schools are going to expect him to sit <br/>
tolerantly while they teach the rest of the students.  and i&#39;m <br/>
curious... who&#39;s opinion is it that he has NO attention span?  <br/>
Sterling would appear to also have NO attention span &quot;most&quot; of the <br/>
time when in actuality he has a very &quot;multi-tasking&quot; type attention <br/>
span.  just because it appears to me that he isn&#39;t paying attention <br/>
to what i am expecting that he should be paying attention to at that <br/>
very instant, doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t paying attention.  He <br/>
usually has several things going on in that busy little mind.  He&#39;ll <br/>
come back several hours later after he&#39;s had a chance to absorb and <br/>
ponder something i was trying to do with him and start asking all <br/>
sorts of questions or he might say/do something related that makes me <br/>
realize he certainly was paying very close attention - and probably <br/>
was thoughfully engaged for quite some time!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that this child is the one who<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; will do well as an unschooler, but he has mentioned that he would<br/>
&gt; LIKE to work in some math books and some brain teasing work books -<br/>
&gt; so I think I will let him, and encourage him as long as he is happy,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  With Sterling only 3 yo, learning about &quot;unschooling&quot; just made me <br/>
realize the name for what i had been doing all along.  doing, doing, <br/>
doing...  following his cues and giving him the resources to be more <br/>
involved in those things that he showed an obvious interest in.  <br/>
Those resources range from going to places to see and do more on the <br/>
subject, interrelating it with our every day activities in and around <br/>
the house, the internet (some really great sites out there!), his own <br/>
computer software, videos, educational TV, music, storybooks and<br/>
yes.... workbooks and puzzle books. <br/>
 To Sterling it&#39;s all part of the fun of playing and &quot;things to do&quot; <br/>
rather than &quot;school&quot;.  and toys?  oh yes... LOTS!  but toys that have <br/>
multiple educational/developmental value.  mindless toys don&#39;t <br/>
hold his interest for very long.  i mentioned the appearance of NO <br/>
attention span &quot;most&quot; of the time...  so i also have to mention that <br/>
there are times when he gets very obviously focused in learning.  He <br/>
will get lost in a jigsaw puzzle, lego&#39;s, and some types of books <br/>
(mazes, dot-to-dot, etc) and other learning.  he&#39;s very intense so <br/>
when he does get involved with something that challenges him and that <br/>
he likes, he can get locked in for quite some time.  We recently did <br/>
a science volcano project.  he thought it was so cool that we had to <br/>
make it erupt over and over and over and over (like the energizer <br/>
bunny, he didn&#39;t want to quit or do anything else most of the day!).  <br/>
he even decided we had to build a town around it for the dinosaurs.  <br/>
and THEN he decided the dinosaurs would die with no water so we had <br/>
to add a pond by putting blue colored water into a deep jar cover and <br/>
burying it in sand up to the rim.  How does he know these things is <br/>
what i would like to know!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I am worried that he will become bored without the chaos of the<br/>
&gt; school environment.....  should this be a concern?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i saw a couple other posts mention that he would find his own <br/>
chaos.  i think that is so true.  given a little guidance to <br/>
encourage his creativity, believe me...  he WILL create his own <br/>
constructive chaos.  our family is always in a state of chaos.  <br/>
between all the &quot;work-in-progress&quot; playing that Sterling dreams up <br/>
and spread throughout the house, special projects, this and that,<br/>
external activities, crammed schedules, etc, etc, etc, there&#39;s plenty <br/>
of chaos. <br/>
<br/>
    Don&#39;t get me<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wrong, I&#39;m committed to having him home and educating him at home,<br/>
&gt; and I do think it is best for him, but I guess I&#39;m just concerned<br/>
&gt; hypothetically (again)  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any thoughts are most appreciated !<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  hope some of this helps...  sorry it got so long.  btw, if your son <br/>
likes puzzle and brain teasers books, has he ever gotten the <br/>
&quot;hilights puzzelmania&quot; books?  i didn&#39;t even know Hilights <br/>
published puzzle books until recently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-676328540">If &quot;toyland&quot; has me convinced they are<br/>

<br/>
I had to respond to this!! Fun is good for the child&#39;s mind!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
All toys are *educational*, and so is everything else in the world. That is my<br/>
basic unschooling philosophy. Toys (as with everything else) are more or less<br/>
complex. For example, the little battery operated toy that makes sounds and<br/>
lights up is simple, you can only do one thing with it -- push the button and<br/>
watch it light up. Although my 2 yog is bored by it (she&#39;s figured it out<br/>
already) my 5 mos old thinks its the best thing in the world. He&#39;s bored by the<br/>
more complex toys (i.e. a dish set or toilet paper tubes) because he can&#39;t play<br/>
complexly yet. Although the battery operated toy drives me nuts (grandma gift :)<br/>
it still has value. It is teaching my son that his movements (and very specific<br/>
movements at that) cause extrordinary things to happen. Play at every age is<br/>
vitally important. Just think, if your kids thought of life and learning as play<br/>
then everything would be fun, from cleaning the house to going to work to<br/>
scrubbing the toilet (my dd thinks this is the most fun, she wears fun gloves<br/>
and since we use baking soda and vinegar to clean everything she can &quot;play&quot; in<br/>
the toilet as long as she wants -- its amazing how clean she gets it!)<br/>
<br/>
So even if something appears to be for playing, look beyond and see what the<br/>
kids are actually doing when they play. If you need help, read something on<br/>
child development (not what kids are supposed to be doing, but what skills kids<br/>
are capable of doing or are concentrating on like fine motor skills in<br/>
toddlerhood, or emotional self-regulation in the preschool years) A good author<br/>
to read Gonzalez-Mena, but there are many others out there.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; Wowser! We get them too.  They are conveniently delivered to our<br/>
&gt; mailbox each month--like a book club subscription.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Hi Diana!  thanks for posting this for everyone.  It doesn&#39;t appear <br/>
that they have a website which really surprises me.  How long have <br/>
you been getting them and how old are your kids that use them?  I was <br/>
hesitant to get them for Sterling since he&#39;s only 3 yo but figured i <br/>
can always cancel if there wasn&#39;t enough for his skill level yet.  <br/>
He&#39;s always liked finding hidden pictures.  we&#39;ve gotten the &quot;I spy&quot; <br/>
series from the library a few times so figured he&#39;d like the <br/>
highlights hidden pictures.  i found there is quite a nice mix of <br/>
things he can do as well as many that are far too advanced for him <br/>
yet.  but that&#39;s okay, the challenge is there when he is ready and he <br/>
has already shocked me with some that i expected him to ignore... <br/>
like the &quot;find-a-word&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
   He&#39;s only gotten the first shipment but we&#39;ve had lots of fun.  <br/>
it&#39;s one of those things we do together, relaxing on the soft,<br/>
when we need some quiet time. and he&#39;s learning so much from them!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are times when I wonder if they teach them anything?  If &quot;toyland&quot;<br/>
&gt; has me convinced they are just for fun rather than good for the<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s mind.  I hate going against my own instincts, and I guess<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s why I am here..  struggling with my instincts that tell me to<br/>
&gt; just let him &quot;be&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i think there are a lot of bad toys out there.  they may teach but <br/>
are they teaching what we want them to teach?  on the other hand, <br/>
toys have progressed to a new level that are educational while having <br/>
fun as are some of the good old classic toys.  I evaluate every toy <br/>
that comes into our house carefully.  We don&#39;t have a lot of extra <br/>
money for toys so i want to make sure i choose wisely.<br/>
<br/>
  when it comes to puzzles, many kids find them fun and depending on <br/>
the type of puzzle i think they are very educational and cover a wide <br/>
range of skills from logic, reasoning, problem solving, math, <br/>
observation, memory, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
  I saw a rand-mcnally 100 piece jigsaw puzzle a couple of weeks ago <br/>
at a thrift store for $.50.  it was the United States on one side and <br/>
world map on the other side.  the pieces were cut out in the shape of <br/>
each US state.  i bought it with the idea of putting it away for <br/>
Sterling for later.  It didn&#39;t get that far.  he saw it in the bag <br/>
when i got home and wanted to make it!  We made it together that <br/>
evening.  what better way for a child to learn his geography and have <br/>
fun doing it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872193577">Thank you, I guess I have been conditioned to think that &quot;playing is bad&quot;<br/>
and is not part of learning, but when I think about it I know damn well that<br/>
is not the case!  (brain fart!)<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly when he thrives and learns best.  But put him in a &quot;school&quot;<br/>
situation and they think he is lazy...  unmotivated etc.   This has affected<br/>
his self esteem and so I&#39;m trying to help him to get it back, slowly but<br/>
surely.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I need lots of people like you parents, standing around me nodding<br/>
in approval a lot :)<br/>

&gt;.... Just think, if your kids thought of life and learning as play<br/>
&gt;then everything would be fun, from cleaning the house to going to work to<br/>
&gt;scrubbing the toilet (my dd thinks this is the most fun, she wears fun<br/>

<br/>
It does my heart proud that you liked Gatto&#39;s book.  I was the editor<br/>
and publisher (I&#39;m the one with the note in the front), and I think the<br/>
book is even better today than when it came out.<br/>
<br/>
In about six weeks, my own book on our homeschooling experiences will be<br/>
out (published by New Society Publishers/Holt Associates) -- it was<br/>
interesting to homeschool being very conscious in advance of Gatto&#39;s<br/>
critiques, so I hope it will be seen as building on his work.  The book<br/>
will be called &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me:  Adventures in<br/>
Homeschooling and Community-Based Education&quot; (I finished the proofing<br/>
this weekend.)  Chapters will appear on my website:<br/>
www.skylarksings.com  (which won&#39;t be up until September 5 or so.)<br/>

Gatto&#39;s book saved my sanity when we were deciding to homeschool.  There was<br/>
so much nonsense going on that his critique was something of a beacon in a<br/>
stormy sea!<br/>
<br/>
I just placed a library hold on The Exhausted School.  I look forward to<br/>
reading your book, David.<br/>

<br/>
I really recommend trusting your instincts over what any one tells you.  I<br/>
think you can get ideas here and other places and if they sound right for<br/>
your child try them.  If they don&#39;t sound right for your child forget it -<br/>
at least for the time being.  Every child is different and it definitely<br/>
works best for me to let my son &quot;be&quot;.  I really have had to train myself to<br/>
&quot;keep out of his way&quot;.  I have found it helpful to not worry if a particular<br/>
activity is teaching him something.  If he enjoys it - he will get what he<br/>
needs out of it and then move onto something else.  It something bores him<br/>
it doesn&#39;t matter how educational it is my son will not learn anything from<br/>
it.  Someone else&#39;s child probably will but not mine at least not at this<br/>
time.  I would probably try again later to see if he was interested.<br/>
