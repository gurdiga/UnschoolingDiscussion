<br/>
Our experience with 4H has been awful.  The signups are basically a starting line with &#39;ready set go&#39;, and the kids run to what they want to sign up for.<br/>
<br/>
Its first come first serve and we never get what we want.<br/>
<br/>
UGH.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510807094">This has been something we have experienced as well....so we are trying<br/>
something new this next year.<br/>
<br/>
We will have a list of the group projects and the leader may or may not<br/>
explain a bit....but to sign up, you have to contact the leader outside of<br/>
the meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Also remember, you can always plan your own project, either just your kids<br/>
or open to others, if you aren&#39;t getting what you want.<br/>
<br/>
The problem we have is having a bunch of kids and only a certain number of<br/>
people interested in leading a project.  Some can have any number of kids,<br/>
but some have to be limited due to the nature of the project.<br/>

I have a question about leading your own project.<br/>
<br/>
I would do that and open it up to others, but I don&#39;t know how to lead a project, and some of the things my daughter is interested in are not things I&#39;m good at, so I&#39;m not sure I *could* lead a project.<br/>
<br/>
How do you go about making your own club, opening it to others, and leading a project? Does the extension office give you all that information?  I&#39;d like to know from someone here before I contact the office, since my experience with them has been so bad so far.<br/>

of any cases where a project was &quot;full.&quot;  I started out with about 26 <br/>
kids signed up for my theater arts project - ended up with about 11 who <br/>
really participated.  Sounds like you need many more project leaders - <br/>
why don&#39;t you lead one yourself? Even when you&#39;re in one club, you can <br/>
sign up for projects in other clubs, too, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand that some projects fill up - there are only so many <br/>
kids that a leader can supervise, in some projects. But, maybe you <br/>
could make a suggestion that everybody sign up for only one project <br/>
before anybody signs up for a second one? Would that help?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456568674">All you have to do is tell the extention office you want to form your own<br/>
club and they will help you, provide information and training, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I have led several projects....none of which I was good at prior to the<br/>
project.  But it was stuff my kids were interested in and I either jumped in<br/>
and learned or asked people who did know to come show the kids.<br/>
<br/>
We did a ballistics project this year based on the book &quot;Backyard<br/>
Ballistics&quot;.  The kids built catapults and tennis ball mortars, some physics<br/>
was peppered in, we had a ball.<br/>
<br/>
We did it because the skeet shooting team was in off season and my 10yo<br/>
really, really needed to blow something up.  He thought it would be fun to<br/>
build this stuff with other people so we turned it into a 4-H project.<br/>
<br/>
It is that easy to do.<br/>
