&lt;&lt; Well, I knew I wouldn&#39;t get any from you since you and I think exactly the <br/>
same way, but<br/>
 I was all ready for some fighting and I didn&#39;t get any.  Maybe that can of <br/>
worms was<br/>
 too big.  :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don&#39;t have any need to fight with you on this one, even though I <br/>
totally disagree.<br/>
I think if Hitler is in heaven, I sure as Hell don&#39;t want to be there.<br/>
If anyone deserves torment more than that man, I can&#39;t think of many. Sorry, <br/>
that&#39;s how I see it.<br/>
But I think your belief is just that, yours. It isn&#39;t an unschooling issue, <br/>
and I feel no need to get you to think any differently on the issue. So why <br/>
fight? I&#39;ll save my boxing gloves for other issues. :)<br/>
