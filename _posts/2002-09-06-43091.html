<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945724610">I don&#39;t generally have trouble saying &#39;no&#39; to strangers, and I do try to<br/>
find the &#39;yes&#39; with my kids if I can, but I honestly have not yet been able<br/>
to see a way of modelling self-care to my kids while NEVER saying no to<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I think that in general, kids hear WAY too many no&#39;s.  I try hard to weed<br/>
out the controlling no&#39;s, such as those pertaining to finishing food (my<br/>
line has always been &quot;She knows how hungry she is better than I do&quot;), what<br/>
clothes to wear, that sort of thing.  There are times when I still say no,<br/>
though.  Yesterday, I was tired, I had spent the whole day with her, and I<br/>
needed a break, so I ran a bath.  She wanted in.  I was cool with her<br/>
visiting with me while I had my bath, but I did not care to share it, so the<br/>
answer was no.  It was a respectful no, and an explained no, but it was no.<br/>
It would have been no for my dh, my mom, or even any passing strangers or<br/>
acquaintances.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also times when she will push me into a no.  There are times when<br/>
her request is not unreasonable, but there is a NOW tacked onto it that<br/>
forces it into a no situation.  She is learning that one still :-) - that if<br/>
she is too inflexible, she can end up with less than if she is willing to<br/>
compromise a bit.  It&#39;s a tough one for some adults to learn :-).<br/>
<br/>
I have seen this thread before, and I never quite believe it.  I mean -<br/>
NEVER saying no??  If someone told me they never say no to their spouse, I<br/>
would consider that unhealthy.  I think every relationship has to have room<br/>
for a good solid no.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I think that the real problem is when the kids are not allowed<br/>
to say no to the parents, but hear no all the time.  THAT was my frustration<br/>
as a kid, and something I try to keep balanced with my kids (often<br/>
unsuccessfully &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

to never have to say no.  If my child did that, I would never have to <br/>
say no either!!  &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my daughter understands it - she just doesn&#39;t accept that it <br/>
really means no (which is what it means).  Her response is, &quot;But <br/>
I WANT to!&quot;  or &quot;Please, Mommy, just one story ...(or whatever)&quot;  <br/>
(sometimes that is her response - sometimes she kisses me <br/>
and brings me a pillow :-))  The question is, what do you say <br/>
when you tell your child you are too sleepy, and she doesn&#39;t <br/>
accept it?  She never pushes?  Are you telling me that you <br/>
believe no child would ever push that, if they had never been told <br/>
no?  That every child, given enough latitude and never refused <br/>
any desire, would understand and accept that every time?  I <br/>
know, I know... I am getting into extremes here, but I am working <br/>
my way towards the possibility that some children (good kids, <br/>
nice kids, even kids who have been raised &#39;properly&#39;) may <br/>
respond less simply than your daughter, prompting you to <br/>
choose between acquiescing or protecting your own boundaries.  <br/>
There are times when it is perfectly within your prerogative to say <br/>
no.  I don&#39;t like the idea of modelling for my daughter that I should <br/>
give in and acquiesce whenever my statement of my own needs <br/>
is challenged, which is where this &#39;never say no&#39; road always <br/>
seems to lead, in my view.  The argument seems to be that her <br/>
needs are ultimately more important than mine, so I should <br/>
consistently ignore my needs whenever she claims to have a <br/>
desire that she feels I should.  I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s a healthy <br/>
dynamic. <br/>

As for your own issues with the word &quot;no&quot;, I don&#39;t share them.  I <br/>
am sorry that you had such a hard childhood (no sarcasm, <br/>
nothing like that - I really am).  That does seem like a rather <br/>

Very rarely.  I offer an alternative, or I promise something for the next day <br/>

<br/>
She does the same kinds of things for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Are you telling me that you <br/>

<br/>
Well... I&#39;m telling you that my kids are VERY understanding, and I think it <br/>
comes directly from their dad and I being consciously careful of being very <br/>
understanding with them.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-That every child, given enough latitude and never refused <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m saying that saying no to children when it&#39;s unnecessary will NOT make <br/>
them more generous and understanding and accepting, but will make them very <br/>
quickly and assuredly LESS so.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am working <br/>

nice kids, even kids who have been raised &#39;properly&#39;) may <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as &quot;simple.&quot;  I see it as a compassionate trust build by <br/>
compassionate action.<br/>
<br/>
-=-prompting you to <br/>
choose between acquiescing or protecting your own boundaries. -=-<br/>
<br/>
From La Leche League (and the many excellent examples of loving famlies I met <br/>
through that organization) and from reading The Continuum Concept, I came <br/>
early to the belief that my children and I are not adversaries, but partners. <br/>
 What is good for &quot;us&quot; is good for both/all of us.  My boundaries don&#39;t shut <br/>
out my children.   &quot;Acquiescing&quot; has a bad reputation, doesn&#39;t it?  IF I can <br/>
read to her or hang out with her and she wants me to I do it.  I do it WAY <br/>
more often than not, and I do it as gently and sweetly as I can, and because <br/>
she knows that to be true, she&#39;s more understanding when I can&#39;t than she <br/>
would be if I often &quot;said no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=There are times when it is perfectly within your prerogative to say <br/>
no.  I don&#39;t like the idea of modelling for my daughter that I should <br/>
give in and acquiesce whenever my statement of my own needs <br/>
is challenged, which is where this &#39;never say no&#39; road always <br/>
seems to lead, in my view. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It is always within your prerogative to say no, since you put it that way.<br/>
<br/>
My mom said no nearly all the time.  What good did it do me or her?  <br/>
I learned very early on that she was selfish and lazy and not a very good <br/>
mother.  Her boundaries protected alcoholism and smoking cigarettes FIRST and <br/>
if there was leftover energy or money MAYBE her children got a crumb.  So my <br/>
prejudice against mothers who enjoy saying &quot;no&quot; is real and personal.  <br/>
<br/>
And without anyone knowing a bit about the realities of my upbringing, I have <br/>
come to know dozens of families in which &quot;no&quot; is saved for dangerous <br/>
situations, and even then the answers are loving explanations, not &quot;NO, <br/>
because I&#39;m the mom,&quot; or &quot;No because I said so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-The argument seems to be that her <br/>
needs are ultimately more important than mine, so I should <br/>
consistently ignore my needs whenever she claims to have a <br/>
desire that she feels I should.  I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s a healthy <br/>
dynamic. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My daughter didn&#39;t create me.  I decided to have a baby.  I knew how, and I <br/>
did what it took.  I didn&#39;t prevent it.  I owe her.  She doesn&#39;t owe me <br/>
diddly.  [I know there are arguments to the contrary from Christian belief in <br/>
God&#39;s will, and in New Age theories that children choose their parents, but <br/>
I&#39;m talking now of what I believe and what I base my decisions on.]<br/>
<br/>
My parents used us as servants sometimes.  It was tacky.  I&#39;m not going to do <br/>
that.<br/>
The needs of any two year old are real.  They&#39;re hungry or afraid or sleepy <br/>
FOR REAL.  It&#39;s not a mental construct or a decision they&#39;re making.  They&#39;re <br/>
not able to wait very well or very long.  And so the need of a two year old <br/>
is vital to that child.  And that child&#39;s health and wellbeing are vital to <br/>
the mother because if the baby is messed up it&#39;s more work in the longrun <br/>
than just seeing to the child&#39;s needs while they&#39;re immediate and small.<br/>
<br/>
A parent taking all their rights at the expense of the happiness of a child <br/>
they created is way more unhealthy than selfless compassion and a generosity <br/>
of spirit could ever, ever be.<br/>
<br/>
-=- That does seem like a rather <br/>
subjective objection to the use of the word no, though.  It is, <br/>
nevertheless, a very useful word for all kinds of tricky situations.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  When other people are critical of or make mean fun of my kids I <br/>
quickly say &quot;NO, don&#39;t do that.  If I wanted them treated that way I would <br/>
send them to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Subjective objections are not sinful or wrong.  Objective discussions can be <br/>
uninformed discussions.  If there&#39;s anyone who was NEVER harmed by the word <br/>
no, perhaps the first people they should be listening to are those who were.<br/>

My daughter wants to do girl scouts and go on certain field trips <br/>
with our homeschool group, so I had to take an afternoon to do <br/>
planning for those things.  She wanted me to do stuff with her that <br/>
afternoon, so I told her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I have to make these calls <br/>
to arrange these trips&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
She wants to play soccer and go to girl scout day camp and she wanted <br/>
friends over today and she wants to do flat travelers and have a pen <br/>
pal.  So today while her friends were over I did my house work and <br/>
then when they left we worked on flat traveler stuff awhile.  Then I <br/>
had to sit down and work on stuff for the next day--packing lunches, <br/>
writing out orders for their soccer fundraiser, signing permission <br/>
slips, etc.  and she wanted me to play a game with her.  Again, the <br/>
answer had to be no because you have soccer and girl scouts tomorrow <br/>
and if you want to go to them, I have to do these things.</div>

If she&#39;s in on the priorities and decision making, then you didn&#39;t just tell <br/>
her no, she helped you decide what would have to go by the wayside.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s very different from a parent just saying no.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are two levels of this discussion going, with some people being <br/>
very literal about the word &quot;no&quot; and others thinking it means you always give <br/>
your kids whatever they ask for as soon as they do.  <br/>
