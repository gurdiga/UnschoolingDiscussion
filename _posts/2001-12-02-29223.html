 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s all in how you chose to frame your child&#39;s personaility. I also find<br/>
it sad that someone would chose these words. I could say that my daughter<br/>
was bossy, argumentative, and stubborn, but I prefer to say that she&#39;s a<br/>
natural leader who is still sometimes working on when to cede a bit of<br/>
the control, she is an independent thinker and is quite forthright about<br/>
sharing her opinions, and she&#39;s very persistent and sometimes struggles<br/>
because she has difficulty taking a break from a situation. <br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time with the word &quot;lazy&quot;, it seems to be a judgement that<br/>
what the person is actually doing is unimportant - a person is lazy<br/>
because he&#39;s not doing something you want him to do. Cacie has spent<br/>
hours reading in her pajamas, or watching tv... actually, she often<br/>
tumbles into bed without changing into pajamas... I don&#39;t consider any of<br/>
this laziness.<br/>
<br/>
And I much prefer willfull kids to will-less kids...<br/>

descriptive words like willful and also from ones like dyslexic.  I <br/>
personally have been called everything from abrasive to the deamon <br/>
bitch.  The words don&#39;t affect my self-worth.  It took me years to <br/>
learn, it took my kid&#39;s days to learn - but that was because they had <br/>
an example to learn from.    <br/>

<br/>
It is your choice to not ask and thus not understand what the other party is<br/>
trying to say.  However, you do not know whether or not the child knows and<br/>
uses the parents&#39; defintion, if the child knows how others define the word<br/>
nor if they have even heard the phrase/words used.  This is all supposition<br/>
which lends nothing to understanding, only to continuing arguments.<br/>

If you told my 9 yo that she was willful, she&#39;d grin and say &quot;I&#39;m a Taurus<br/>
and proud of it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which brings us full circle, IF one is interested in understanding and<br/>
learning, one asks for definitions of words and meanings of phrases.  If one<br/>
is only interested in arguing a biased viewpoint, one stubbornly sticks to<br/>
their definition of what they have decided the other party is saying.<br/>

pretty close to universal in a a given society. Can you really not accept<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would think that if your family has a secret, private definition for<br/>
words like &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;willful&quot;, or &quot;dumb little fucker&quot;, then one would<br/>
understand that people outside your family won&#39;t get it and not post<br/>
using the words on a big email list. If you do, then you can expect<br/>
people on said email list to conclude that you are insulting your own<br/>
children publicly. Your children, too, will eventually realize that the<br/>
rest of the world defines these words differently that your family, which<br/>
can be kind of crazymaking for a kid... <br/>

the standard meanings of words, and if we&#39;re unsure of those, we use our<br/>
dictionaries. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to be an unschooling parent (which I assume you do, because<br/>
you&#39;re here), I believe it is first essential to be a respectful parent.<br/>
Yes, there are many parents who refer to their children as willful, or<br/>
lazy, or dumb, or ugly, and then say, &quot;Yeah, but he doesn&#39;t mind, he<br/>
knows he is,&quot; and the kids all nod and smile... but there&#39;s a whole world<br/>
out there that thinks lazy is not a good thing, and the parents know that<br/>
- why else would you fight so hard against using a word with a positive<br/>
connotation, why is it so important to use a negative one? <br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
IMO it&#39;s harmful to call *anyone* names and those who feel it&#39;s no big deal apparently have had it done to them so much that they&#39;ve become used to it, and that is very sad and unfortunate. <br/>
I don&#39;t spank my kids; I use my words to convey my anger, disapproval, whatever. I can bring the girls to tears with just the words I use (*not* something that happens often, though... I hate being the discipliner!). And while I would try to tell them that kids calling them names is not worth worrying about (this has never happened), we all realize what power ones&#39; choice of words can have. <br/>
I think, in *my* case, the choice of words &quot;willful&quot; and &quot;lazy&quot; stirs up thoughts of the hsing fundamentalists I live around (here in the Bible belt of the USA).  In that circle, they view children as little heathens needing to be broken and put in their proper place (uck uck uck!!!!). Often, one would hear a mother describe her child as willful.  So, for *me*, I&#39;d never choose those words to describe a child as they are too closely associated to things and a way of life that I detest.<br/>

opportunity for me to learn! Do you find it difficult to remain true to<br/>
your faith while unschooling, and vice versa? My impression of<br/>
fundamentalist Christianity - which may be way off - is that it&#39;s fairly<br/>
rigid and requires a fairly controlled and controlling lifestyle, in<br/>
order to follow the biblical rules. Unschooling, otoh, is very focused on<br/>
flexibility and complete freedom, at least as far as learning is<br/>
concerned. How do you reconcile the two?<br/>

by the categorization &quot;lazy and willful&quot; . . . its why I asked the poster <br/>
what she meant by that, and why she held that belief, but have not seen her <br/>
answer. . . perhaps she is an occasional poster. I don&#39;t want to judge why <br/>
she labels in that manner but rather try to understand and perhaps offer a <br/>
different perspective when I know what she is referring to. . .don&#39;t want to <br/>

Remember that every act is an act of self-definition.  Every thought<br/>
carries the energy of creation.  Every word is a declaration of what is true<br/>
for you. Look to see what you are doing today.  Is this how you choose to <br/>
define yourself? Look to see what you are thinking today.  Is this what you <br/>
wish to create? Look to see what you are saying today.  Is this what you <br/>
desire to be so? Each moment of your life is a holy moment, a moment of <br/>
creation<br/>

 </span></blockquote>true to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your faith while unschooling, and vice versa? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope!<br/>
<br/>
My impression of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fundamentalist Christianity - which may be way off - is that it&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>fairly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rigid and requires a fairly controlled and controlling lifestyle, in<br/>
&gt; order to follow the biblical rules. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t feel I have a controlled or controlling lifestyle at all.  I <br/>
believe that I am saved solely through faith in Jesus as my Savior <br/>
and Lord.  I don&#39;t believe that works do anything to save me although <br/>
I want to live for Jesus out of love for Him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of what you might be thinking of when you say a <br/>
controlled lifestyle.  Maybe going to lots of church services?  I <br/>
don&#39;t believe in institutional church services.  I do believe that <br/>
Christians are supposed to *be* the church and daily encourage and <br/>
exhort one another.  I believe that today&#39;s institutional churches <br/>
were created by man, not by God.  We don&#39;t go to church although we <br/>
fellowship with other Christians as often as the Lord brings them <br/>
into our paths.  We did recently start going to Sunday School because <br/>
there is one near by that the kids like to go to and they ask me to <br/>
take them.  They are aware that they can stop going whenever they <br/>
want.  <br/>
<br/>
What else--maybe submission to a husband?  Yep, I do believe that <br/>
Jesus wants us to submit to our husbands as a picture of how Christ <br/>
submitted to the Father.  Equal, yet different roles.  I also believe <br/>
that it is my job to be a helper to dh.  Sometimes I don&#39;t do a great <br/>
job on the submissive or the helper parts, but I pray for God&#39;s grace <br/>
to help me in those areas.  Dh is a great guy who loves me very much <br/>
and I have never felt opressed in any way.  <br/>
<br/>
I suspect I am controlling of what my kids watch and read than most <br/>
unschoolers on this list.  I don&#39;t control tv or books for <br/>
educational reasons but I do make sure I read anything with <br/>
objectionable content with my kids instead of letting them read it on <br/>
their own (note that my oldest is only 8 so this might change when <br/>
she&#39;s a teenager and I feel she is able to discern what is true on <br/>
her own).  For example, if we&#39;re reading a book and there&#39;s a <br/>
reference to the earth being millions of years old, I pause and <br/>
remind the kids that God created the earth only 6000 years ago.  The <br/>
kids know there&#39;s certain tv shows they are forbidden to watch and <br/>
they&#39;re very good about it.  Dd is even starting to notice things on <br/>
her own that would contradict our faith and she is quick to turn it <br/>
off, especially if one of her younger brothers are around.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; flexibility and complete freedom, at least as far as learning is<br/>
&gt; concerned. How do you reconcile the two?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Until recently, I was an extremely relaxed homeschooler, but I&#39;ve <br/>
recently made the plunge to total unschooling.  I clearly see in <br/>
Scripture that I&#39;m supposed to teach my children how to develop a <br/>
relationship with Jesus and how to live for Him.  I don&#39;t see <br/>
anything in Scripture that tells me I need to teach my children to <br/>
read by a certain age or make them sit down and be lectured, drilled, <br/>
or made to fill out worksheets day after day.  As a matter of fact, I <br/>
am concerned that our culture has made an idol of education.  I <br/>
believe God wants us to use the brains He gave us for His honor and <br/>
glory, but not to put academic success on a high pedastal and give it <br/>
the high place of honor our culture does.  <br/>
<br/>
Does that answer some of your questions?  Any more? <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396546339">I know I will get in trouble for saying this, but I rejoined this list a few<br/>
weeks ago in order to get some inspiration and support for unschooling. I<br/>
still flucutate between unschooling and worrying about whether my kids are<br/>
learning &quot;enough&quot;. Ever since I rejoined this list there has been nothing<br/>
but bickering and fighting. I do not need to waste my time on reading emails<br/>
between &quot;intelligent&quot; adults that are rude, name calling, uncaring and in my<br/>
estimation childish. Who cares or has time to even listen to your personal<br/>
bickering. <br/>
<br/>
Lets share all the good things we have learned about hs and unschooling and<br/>
give support to one another.<br/>

If I were to get on here and bash wiccans our athiets, I would get<br/>
slammed pretty quick, but it seems to be perfectly acceptable to<br/>
slam &quot;fundamentalists&quot;.  I am most definitely a Bible fundamentalist--<br/>
one who adheres to the fundamentals of the faith.  I don&#39;t appreciate<br/>
having my faith constantly slammed on this list.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think, in *my* case, the choice of words &quot;willful&quot; and &quot;lazy&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stirs up thoughts of the hsing fundamentalists I live around (here in<br/>
the Bible belt of the USA).  In that circle, they view children as<br/>
little heathens needing to be broken and put in their proper place<br/>
(uck uck uck!!!!). <br/>

My little boy is a beautiful wonderful little guy, but to excuse certain <br/>
behaviors that are not conducive to our family as a whole would be <br/>
inexcusable on my part. My husband and I certainly do not say to Jack &quot;You <br/>
are a lazy willful child.&quot; but we do show by example that those behaviors are <br/>
not acceptable to us. Sitting watching TV while the rest of us are fixing <br/>
dinner does not make for a happy family, every one is expected to help. And <br/>
when my husband or I say to him &quot;come help&quot; and he replies with loud <br/>
protesting NO&#39;s and throws a fit, well then I call that being lazy and <br/>
willful. I can&#39;t help it if some of you don&#39;t or won&#39;t use those words to <br/>
describe that behavior. It has nothing to do with being conservative or <br/>
members of any certain religion, because we aren&#39;t, it has to do with the <br/>
expectation that respect and trust go a long way in our home. I respect my <br/>
children&#39;s choices in their education, I trust that they will grow and learn <br/>
in a warm, happy environment and I trust that they aid in making said <br/>
environment warm and happy, with love and cheer, not fits and tears. I don&#39;t <br/>
burst into a fit when someone asks for dinner or a snack, and I expect the <br/>
same when I ask for the table to be set or the cheese grated. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-798962199">I understand that perfectly!  My youngest for a while would throw a <br/>
fit if you asked him to breath.  Not because he didn&#39;t want to <br/>
breath, but because he was having severe food sensitivity/allergy  <br/>
problems and anything that involved him responding to anyone else <br/>
else included a tantrum.  Now, some may be willing to put up with <br/>
that kind of behaviour indefinitely but I&#39;m not and the rest of the <br/>
family was not either.  My dd is learning to cope with her temper and <br/>
hormones and depression and ds is slowly learning that pitching a fit <br/>
at any little request is unacceptible.  It is not a matter of being <br/>
authoritarian or controlling his learning or his life for that <br/>
matter, it is a matter of living in a house with 6 other people and <br/>
learning to be an equal member, not the pet tantrum thrower.  And <br/>
definitely not the master of six servants, which is what he appeared <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404693379">I would like to respectfully reply to the 2 posts below.  The following <br/>
is my experience.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that the less I ask my boys to do something, the more they <br/>
want to do it.  They see me make three meals every day.  I never ask <br/>
them to help me.  I enjoy watching them do their own thing, even if it&#39;s <br/>
just relaxing and watching TV or playing their play station.  If they&#39;re <br/>
happy, I&#39;m happy.  I have found that as they get older they begin to <br/>
volunteer more and more often to help me with this or that.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
happen every day, but it certainly DOES happen.  They will ask to set <br/>
the table, grate the cheese, mop the floor, dust, vacuum, clean the <br/>
windows, etc.  I wish I could share with you the feeling I get when they <br/>
ask to do these things.  I know then, without a doubt, that unschooling <br/>
is working.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to turn someone off to something is to make them do it.  <br/>
Modeling is the best teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always considered unschooling a way of life, not just a way of <br/>
educating.  I believe in my boys having as many choices in their lives <br/>
as possible.  I am not about to interrupt their fun so they can help me <br/>
with dinner.  That is the best way to teach them that these chores are <br/>
unpleasant and no one should want to do them voluntarily.  I do them <br/>
voluntarily because I love my family and they are necessary.  Of course, <br/>
there are times when I resent the fact that my husband is playing his <br/>
computer games for hours at a time while I have to do my housework (not <br/>
very well - my house is a mess!) or cook the meals, etc.  When I find I <br/>
need a little help, I&#39;ll ask him, not my boys.  I try and ask as little <br/>
as possible from my boys, and I find, the less I ask, the more they <br/>
volunteer.  Unschooling is beautiful.<br/>

of individual choices. If I am not interested in making dinner, I don&#39;t, and <br/>
someone else picks up the slack or we just snack on stuff. If I choose to not <br/>
to the laundry that week, either someone else does it, or it doesnt get done <br/>
and when we are compltetely out of clothes, someone starts doing it. . . <br/>
modeling and respect for all choices are keys to a peaceful unschooling life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006958300">It&#39;s true that each child if different. It&#39;s all my eldest can do to keep up with his own needs. If I didn&#39;t do his laundry once in a while he&#39;d just wear dirty clothes. This said I couldn&#39;t imagine our family without him! His contributions far outweigh the extra work he creates and we all adore him. He does order the little ones to get him this and that, now and then, but they can&#39;t seem to do enough for him or get enough of him, most of the time. If I really need his help he&#39;s always there for me, but our ideas of what needs to be done and when, are as different as an 18 year old man and a 45 year old woman &lt;bg&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
My middle son is vacuuming as I post. He knows that tomorrow I&#39;ll be making dinner for all of his grandparents and if he wants me  to find an hour to take him to the skateboard park he&#39;d better get a jump on what I like to see done before they all arrive. I didn&#39;t ask him to do a thing. My little girl is more like big brother but she&#39;s encouraged to pitch in when she sees me show my gratitude to middle brother. <br/>
<br/>
Biggest brother and little sister love to cook. Daisy will probably make something for desert tomorrow, she can follow a simple recipe and has mastered butterscotch brownies, rice pudding, fruit salad, coffee cake and a variety of cookies and she&#39;s only 7. I&#39;ve always joked, with people who question our lifestyle, that culinary arts is a big part of our curriculum.  I wouldn&#39;t expect the kids to help with things like cooking dinner or setting the table because I know they would be happy with a peanut butter sandwich and a glass of OJ in front of the TV. <br/>
<br/>
Taking this time to write about our family reminds me of how happy we are and how lucky I am! I&#39;m grateful to have a kitchen to clean, a washing machine to do the laundry, a bed to make, a bathroom to scrub etc etc etc..... Family life has been the highlight of my adventures to date and having an 18 year old reminds me to savor the chaos while I can&lt;BG&gt; I think I&#39;ve been close to Lovemary&#39;s definition for inner peace except for # 7. For me the words mother and worry are synonyms. I&#39;m Jewish, and though I don&#39;t believe in god, I do come by the worry and guilt honestly&lt;g&gt;<br/>
