<div id="ygrps-yiv-604358157">Hi to all! I am just jumping in here. My name is Nancy, I used to belong to <br/>
this group, but quit almost all my online activities earlier this year because <br/>
my dh was having medical problems and we were in some dire straits <br/>
financially. Things are better now! Anyway, for those of you who don&#39;t know me, or don&#39;t <br/>
remember me, I have been at home with my kids for years now. We have always <br/>
unschooled, never used curriculums. Moly&#39;s kindergarten year reminded me why I <br/>
hated school so much and we decided we couldn&#39;t do any worse. So far no one has <br/>
complained, and in our house that is something! So as long as that continues <br/>
we will too. :o) <br/>
<br/>
Moly is 9 and Jack is 7. Darin and I have been married over ten years now. <br/>
Moly wants to be either a doctor or a veterinarian, but mostly a vet. Most of <br/>
her activities revolve around animals. She collects food and other things for <br/>
Stone Nature Center, she reads books upon books about all sorts of animals, and <br/>
she is trying to find a vet who will let her volunteer in his office. Jack <br/>
wants to be a movie star and I think if anyone can be a star, he can! It&#39;s like <br/>
living with Robin Williams, Andy Kaufman, and Jim Carey in one person. He says <br/>
when he becomes a star, he is going to buy me a house in Malibu and a tank. <br/>
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to drive a tank Mom? It would be lots of fun to crush stuff!&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s my boy! &lt;bwg&gt; <br/>
<br/>
