<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712984124">Hi, I&#39;ve posted a couple times without telling who I<br/>
was -- sorry, I&#39;m getting absent minded.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Roberta and I have 5 girls -- 2 that are<br/>
16, one 14, one 12, and the &quot;baby&quot; is 9. I am new to<br/>
unschooling. Just pulled my 2 youngest out of school<br/>
in January. Would love to remove all of them from<br/>
school, but the two oldest are almost out of 10th and<br/>
don&#39;t want to homeschool (except they are jealous that<br/>
the others don&#39;t have homework) and the 14 yo is in a<br/>
special school since she is bipolar and has<br/>
Aspberger&#39;s (form of Autism).<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking for about 2 months now and I have<br/>
to admit that some of the things I have read here have<br/>
really made me stop and think about &quot;why&quot; we do<br/>
things. I have tried and am trying to relax on a lot<br/>
of the things I used to do and say. And now I find<br/>
myself having to stop and think about what I want to<br/>
say and how I want to phrase it (so as not to seem<br/>
rude or insensitive). I have to admit that I have a<br/>
long way to go &lt;g&gt;, but am trying to change.<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 questions:<br/>
<br/>
Any advice on how to find local unschoolers? I live in<br/>
San Antonio, TX. I joined a local homeschoolers group,<br/>
but they look at me strange when I mention<br/>
unschooling, so I&#39;m not exactly comfortable with them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am needing advice on what to tell my 12 yo<br/>
(Suzi). Suzi&#39;s best friend comes over everyday<br/>
(instead of being a latchkey kid) and frequently says<br/>
things to Suzi such as &quot;you&#39;re not going to learn<br/>
anything&quot;, &quot;you should go back to school&quot;, &quot;how are<br/>
you ever going to get into college/scholarships etc&quot;,<br/>
and &quot;you&#39;re going to be dumb&quot;. I try to reassure Suzi<br/>
that she will learn as much as or more (though not in<br/>
the same order) as the kids in school and we have had<br/>
talks about what she wants (doesn&#39;t want to go back to<br/>
school, doesn&#39;t want to stick her nose in a book all<br/>
day). I also tell her not to worry, that she doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to explain to her friend and that not everyone is<br/>
going to be okay with our decision, but that is their<br/>
problem, not ours, but she&#39;s still uncomfortable.<br/>
So... anyone have ideas on what she should/could say<br/>
or what I can say to her to help?<br/>
<br/>
BTW - It sure is helpful having a list like this to<br/>
read and the references, articles, etc available. I&#39;m<br/>
sure it takes a lot of time to run a list this size,<br/>
but it really is appreciated :-).<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533775290">&lt;&lt;Any advice on how to find local unschoolers? I live in<br/>
San Antonio, TX. I joined a local homeschoolers group,<br/>
but they look at me strange when I mention<br/>
unschooling, so I&#39;m not exactly comfortable with them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My local group has some members who are pretty vocally anti-unschooling<br/>
because they have &quot;educational goals&quot; for their children. It took me a long<br/>
time to &quot;come out&quot; as an unschooler because I feared they would not welcome<br/>
Jayn to play. That has turned out to be groundless. I simply walk away from<br/>
the curriculum conversations, and now it seems there are two other<br/>
unschooling families in the group (I may be the only Radical Unschooler). It<br/>
is the almost universal focus on gentler parenting that keeps me in the<br/>
group, especially amongst the longer term members. I don&#39;t proselytize<br/>
unschooling, but do answer questions when asked. If someone talks about how<br/>
they &quot;do&quot; x pages or hours or starts complaining about the time it takes, I<br/>
just go away. Sometimes I just say &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m an unschooler so I<br/>
don&#39;t use any curriculum.&quot; <br/>
My point is that we are in the group for Jayn&#39;s sake, not mine - having<br/>
other gently parented children to play with in a non-judgmental free-play<br/>
situation without the excessive parental mediation in their activities and<br/>
interactions that so characterizes ordinary park visit experiences. I have<br/>
made some friends that we see outside of the group too. I sometimes feel<br/>
like they look upon me with humor - as if I was the local harmless eccentric<br/>
crackpot.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, I am needing advice on what to tell my 12 yo<br/>
(Suzi). Suzi&#39;s best friend comes over everyday<br/>
(instead of being a latchkey kid) and frequently says<br/>
things to Suzi such as &quot;you&#39;re not going to learn<br/>
anything&quot;, &quot;you should go back to school&quot;, &quot;how are<br/>
you ever going to get into college/scholarships etc&quot;,<br/>
and &quot;you&#39;re going to be dumb&quot;. I try to reassure Suzi<br/>
that she will learn as much as or more (though not in<br/>
the same order) as the kids in school and we have had<br/>
talks about what she wants (doesn&#39;t want to go back to<br/>
school, doesn&#39;t want to stick her nose in a book all<br/>
day). I also tell her not to worry, that she doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to explain to her friend and that not everyone is<br/>
going to be okay with our decision, but that is their<br/>
problem, not ours, but she&#39;s still uncomfortable.<br/>
So... anyone have ideas on what she should/could say<br/>
or what I can say to her to help?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I may be in a minority here but my suggestion is that if the friend is<br/>
saying things that you object to, in your hearing, it is OK to speak to her<br/>
about it, in a light manner. It sounds clear to me that she is already<br/>
feeling jealous on several levels, and finding it hard to adjust to a major<br/>
change in her circumstances. The balance of power at school is no doubt<br/>
altered without Suzi, and the friend is speaking from her needs, not Suzi&#39;s<br/>
best interest. No one needs to have &quot;friends&quot; who see it as their job to<br/>
pull you down, criticize you and hurt your feelings. I think saying personal<br/>
disparagments like &quot;you&#39;re going to be dumb&quot; crosses a line, beyond<br/>
expressing doubts about colleges - the latter can be easily refuted with<br/>
information, which may reassure Suzi. <br/>
<br/>
I am not above using the fact that other children are rule-bound and<br/>
brainwashed by saying something along the lines of &quot;respecting the house<br/>
rules&quot; - even though we don&#39;t actually have any! We had to speak to Jayn&#39;s<br/>
friend about not trying to draw Jayn into schemes to hide candy, and I have<br/>
told her to change her blackmailing type behavior or go home in the past<br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
Suzi is still deschooling. She is having to change from a peer dominated<br/>
reality fraught with manipulations, to a family centered one. My immediate<br/>
knee jerk reaction would be to find ways to lessen the time the other girl<br/>
is spending with her for now - by going on interesting outings so you aren&#39;t<br/>
home in the afternoon, for example. It should not be your responsibility to<br/>
care for her (as a latchkey kid as you mention) if it is detrimental to your<br/>
own daughter.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there are several other families unschooling Asperger&#39;s and Autism<br/>
spectrum children. See the message boards at Unschooling.com for more.<br/>

There is an e-mail list for Round Rock.  I know that&#39;s not exactly close,<br/>
but maybe some members are nearer you.  It&#39;s a yahoo group called RRun if<br/>
you want to look for it.  I think it&#39;s a smaller list.  The owner used to<br/>
be and maybe still is, on the Montana list as I think her family travels<br/>
between the two states several times a year.  If you don&#39;t find the list<br/>
let me know and I might be able to get better information.<br/>

I agree with Robyn about speaking with the child who is making such comments<br/>
to your daughter.  I do quite a bit of this.  Children can be so mean at<br/>
times.  But the question I would ask this child is why she feels<br/>
like..(whatever the comment she has made).  I love to ask the why question.<br/>
It gives the child the opportunity to think. (novel thought!)  Most of the<br/>
time they are just repeating what they have heard and really don&#39;t have a<br/>
real opinion.  Asking why gives them an opportunity to find their opinion<br/>
and know why they feel the way they do.  I wish someone had taught me how to<br/>
really think about things when I was young.  I hope that makes sense.  This<br/>
will also empower your child to see you step to the plate in support of her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218468705">When my dd&#39;s were younger someone in our homeschooling community sponsored an unschooling support group.  It lasted for a few years but was a wonderful way to meet other unschoolers within the larger community of homeschooling folks and to get a good handle on our own ideas of parenting lifestyle choices etc.<br/>
<br/>
So if your looking for other unschoolers - how about starting an unschoolers support group in your area.  It doesn&#39;t have to preclude attending other homeschooler events.  Even if it starts with two families...eventually it may grow and it will certainly attract some curiosity seekers.<br/>

Our inclusive group led to two unschooling families&#39; starting an unschooling <br/>
support group ---kind of a spin-off. It eventually led to hosting the first <br/>
and second national unschooling conferences, as well as spin-off groups in NC <br/>
and GA.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a powerful and empowering move to make.<br/>
