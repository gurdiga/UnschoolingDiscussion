&gt; &gt;I&#39;m just curios to know... how many of the people that are against the use<br/>
&gt; &gt;of tampons use or have used disposable diapers on their children?  It is a<br/>
&gt; &gt;fact that the chemical in the gel used to make disp. diapers so absorbant<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt;the same chemical that was removed from tampons in 1988 because it was<br/>
&gt; &gt;linked to TSS. And we have this pressing against our children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; reproductive<br/>
&gt; &gt;oragans 24/7? I don&#39;t want anyone to think this is a personal slam. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;not. I use them for my kids from time to time. I&#39;m just saying that perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt;we should rethink our stance from time to time. FYI this gel is also the<br/>
&gt; &gt;same one that is used to coat Tylenol and other gel caps. Is it really<br/>
&gt; &gt;objective to make blanket statements about the use of tampons when we all<br/>
&gt; &gt;can&#39;t be so noble to say we&#39;ve never used any of these other products. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;hate conflict and don&#39;t want anyone to think I&#39;m looking for a fight. I<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt;think we all need to examine oue daily practices  a liitle closer.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, I started at 9, back in the dark ages (50&#39;s) as did several other<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; members of my family.  So, some<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; pre-spotting prior to that age doesn&#39;t sound too out there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, as to the tampons.  That whole business about it being o.k. is<br/>
&gt; simply<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; manufacturers trying to get more customers.  When I went through the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; classes back in the dark ages, we were told they were definately not o.k.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; for anyone who wasn&#39;t sexually active and were really not designed for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; anyone who hadn&#39;t had a child yet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; We now know that they contain Dioxin and this push for younger and<br/>
&gt; younger<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; girls to use tampons would seem to correlate with the increase in various<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; cancers and the younger and younger age that women are getting cancer<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (ovarian, cervical, uterine and breast).<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, this is really weird because this seems to be a topic on several<br/>
&gt; &gt;lists<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; right now so I have my whole Dioxin speel down.  Dioxin is in the top 10<br/>
&gt; &gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; known carcenogens.  It is the &quot;evil&quot; from Love Canal, etc.  It is fat<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; soluable, not water soluable which means it resides in fatty tissues and<br/>
&gt; &gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; found in humans, mammals, birds and fish and seeks them out, so to speak.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Dioxin is the by-product of the bleaching process that cotton goes<br/>
&gt; through<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and is residual.  Rayon is also another problem as are the chemicals that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; are put in tampons.  There are unbleached tampons available that are<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; chemical free.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This board has been quiet for a while. But I hope all you supportive<br/>
&gt; &gt;moms<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; somewhere near your computers. I am having a Mother Moment I think and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; need<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some real good advice soon.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; okay here is the situation.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My dd is 81/2.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Over the weekend while she was at my girlfriends house, I went on a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; cleaning<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spree. In the process I found a pair of undies that I just bought for<br/>
&gt; &gt;her<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; last weekend, rolled in a ball under her bed. There was signs of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;spotting&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on them .<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Okay I know this is normal but 81/2? Isnt that a bit young , I was 11<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; myself<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; my sisters were both 14, my bestfriend was almost 16. Although I<br/>
&gt; believe<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; husbands sisters were younger than that?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway I asked her about it and she seemed to not know what I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;talking<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about. I told her it was okay to tell me , even if it was a little<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; embarrassing but she insisted so I didnt push the issue. I called my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bestfriend who has a 12yod that went through this over the summer. Her<br/>
&gt; &gt;10<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; yod<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just had a class on this in school she had some booklets tha she gave<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bring home to my dd. which I did and she read them on her own , I left<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; out for her. when I asked her about it , she said &quot;Mom that is sick!&quot;<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tried to make light of it and giggled and said I know but do you have<br/>
&gt; &gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; questions? She said no and I thought maybe I should drop the subject<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; now<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; .What do you guys think? I know shes a bit young to be able to grasp<br/>
&gt; &gt;this<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; concept , so I dont want to freak her out, but at the same time I want<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; make sure she knows what shes doing too. She absolutely hates to go to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Drs. and I think she is too young for that kind of Dr. Does anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;agree?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; booklet also said that its okay to use Tampons for swimming, ?????? For<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; an 8<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yo? I think not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Anybody have answers or ideas as to handle this situation?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972147681">Hi  -- I just HAD to chime on on this one!!  My dd (8 1/2) started last<br/>
month!  I thought it was a bit young, too, but it wasn&#39;t just spotting -<br/>
she actually started.  I spoke to her pediatrician and he doesn&#39;t<br/>
recommend any type of GYN exam until she is about 16 or so unless there<br/>
are problems.   He also suggested AGAINST tampons until she has finished<br/>
growing ... something about it possibly affecting growth and maturity of<br/>
her internal genital organs?? I&#39;m not sure about that but I am definitely<br/>
against tampons in &#39;children.&#39;  Maybe when she is a teen (or better yet,<br/>
an adult) she can make that decision but for now ... no.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was a kid they made &#39;mini&#39; pads that were just the<br/>
right size for teens.  I couldn&#39;t find them anywhere!  It seems all they<br/>
have now are the thin maxis and they are too wide.  I finially found a<br/>
non-thin maxi that is pretty narrow (generic brand, it figures) and they<br/>
seemed to work.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, she handled it just fine ... Mommy is the one who freaked out!  I<br/>
can&#39;t believe how young kids are &#39;growing up&#39; these days.  I decided it<br/>
was a good time to cover that in a health unit (not geared towards her<br/>
but just general information and teaching).  She took to this pretty<br/>
well.  I found a site owned by Tampax (go  figure) that sent a free<br/>
teaching packet including a video tape.  I took out the parts that dealt<br/>
with tampons and used it as a very informative addition to our health<br/>
unit.  It had a full color diagram of reproductive organs and was<br/>
presented in a very &#39;biologic&#39; fashion.  It seemed to make it easier for<br/>
her to talk about when we were taking about &#39;women in general&#39; instead of<br/>
her.  It even covered puberty in males, as well, so it didn&#39;t seem like I<br/>
was focusing on her.  I can&#39;t find the web site off hand but if<br/>
interested I will look for it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Putting on a cup of tea just thinking about my &#39;baby&#39; growing up so<br/>
early&gt;&gt;  Want to join me?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If I can help, let me know.  We seem to be on the same path at the<br/>
moment.  God Bless you and your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Sandi<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223385145">Dear Friends,<br/>
   <br/>
   The following is something I wrote for another list a few weeks ago.  It <br/>
is about my son, Colton, who is 9 1/2.  I thought it might speak to the <br/>
hearts of moms who have kids growing up way too fast.<br/>
<br/>
   This is perhaps a tacky story to tell you, but if I can&#39;t vent to my <br/>
kindred spirits I will surely go mad.  We have noticed some changes in Colton <br/>
lately.  He has been emotional and moody.  He can spit out his words with the <br/>
speed of an auctioneer.  He can captain a debating team.  He can hold my hand <br/>
one minute and be rolling his eyes at me the next.  Bud and I have wondered <br/>
what is going on with him.  We have even gone so far as to ask, &quot;OK, so who <br/>
are you, REALLY?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
   I finally have it figured out.  I can sum up the changes in one single, <br/>
horrifying word...<br/>
<br/>
   ...puberty.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how the mystery was solved.  As Colton was about to take a shower last <br/>
night, I heard him yank back the shower curtain.  Then he yelled for my help. <br/>
 I ran up to his bathroom to find him naked as the day he was born (only <br/>
considerably taller), clutching the shower curtain rod in his hands.  This <br/>
was nothing new to me because I&#39;ve experienced it too; the rod will fall <br/>
right off the wall if you pull too hard on the curtain.  While I was putting <br/>
the curtain rod back up, I smelled an unmistakable odor.  Was it really?  <br/>
Could it be?  YES, it was.<br/>
<br/>
   SWEAT!!!<br/>
<br/>
   It didn&#39;t take long to pinpoint where the odor was coming from, since I&#39;d <br/>
just had my shower.  I congratulated Colton on growing up, found him a stick <br/>
deodorant in a manly &quot;cool breeze&quot; scent and told him how to use it.  Then I <br/>
set the deodorant on his bathroom counter, right next to the bottle of hair <br/>
gel which has recently taken up residence.  Yes, Colton is now *styling* his <br/>
hair, whereas six months ago he rarely combed it.  He wears it in a style I <br/>
think of as &quot;shiny bedhead,&quot; but my son assures me this is &quot;cool.&quot;  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t know, as I haven&#39;t been cool in 400 years.<br/>
<br/>
   Intellectually, I knew my son was growing up.  But I don&#39;t think with my <br/>
head, I think with my heart.  And my heart is several years behind.  So if <br/>
you see me this week, give me a comforting hug.  Here is how you will <br/>
recognize me: there will be tears in my eyes and I&#39;ll be holding Colton&#39;s old <br/>
teddy bear.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Carol</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497466007">Hi Tamie:<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re handling things very well and I&#39;m sure your daughter is<br/>
perfectly normal and healthy.  My advice would be to not take her to a<br/>
doctor as that will only freak her out.  I agree with a previous<br/>
response that even after a cycle seems established she doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
go for years yet.  Maybe leave &quot;supplies&quot; out so they are available<br/>
should she decide she wants to use them.  Even a small pantiliner may<br/>
seem less threatening.  (Tampons scare me even as an adult and I<br/>
recently heard about a cancer risk associated with them.)  And I too,<br/>
have heard over and over again that the hormones in our food<br/>
supply-especially meat and milk-could be responsible for our children<br/>
maturing more quickly now.  Though I am now 38 years old and I started<br/>
my period when I was 10.  Your daughter may be right on track.  It is a<br/>
bit terrifying isn&#39;t it?  My daughter is 7 1/2 and is a bit curvy <br/>
already so I too have wondered and even worried if I could have a<br/>
surprise sooner than I am ready!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll both be fine,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Thanks Amy,<br/>
&gt; I know I seem to be going way too fast just that I was so completely thrown<br/>
&gt; off guard by the whole situation. My mom Never explained anything to us so I<br/>
&gt; think my sisters and I tend to go overboard on certain subjects. Especially<br/>
&gt; the kind &quot;you dont talk about, its just not nice.) Glad I grew up in the 80s<br/>
&gt; and the info wasnt hard to come by even if I would have rathered  hear it<br/>
&gt; from mom. Anyway I think your right that she dosnt need a Dr. right now, and<br/>
&gt; Im so relieved to hear you say that because getting her into the Dr. office<br/>
&gt; of the ped. she has had since she was 2 is a process. She really hates it.<br/>
&gt; She wont even pee in the cup, we have to bring it home. I also do not think<br/>
&gt; it is an injury as she tends to be somewhat of a hypercondriac(sp) (thats<br/>
&gt; just my way of saying she loves to make sure I tend to all her boo bos.) She<br/>
&gt; definately would have said something to me. And as for utis and fisures Im<br/>
&gt; not sure so I think well just keep and eye on it and see if we need to see<br/>
&gt; the DR.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for keeping me grounded.<br/>
&gt; I really appreciate it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77749762">Hi Lynda;<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t stop the &quot;ranting&quot;.  I could learn a lot from you!<br/>

&gt; Well, I started at 9, back in the dark ages (50&#39;s) as did several other<br/>
&gt; members of my family.  So, some<br/>
&gt; pre-spotting prior to that age doesn&#39;t sound too out there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, as to the tampons.  That whole business about it being o.k. is simply<br/>
&gt; manufacturers trying to get more customers.  When I went through the<br/>
&gt; classes back in the dark ages, we were told they were definately not o.k.<br/>
&gt; for anyone who wasn&#39;t sexually active and were really not designed for<br/>
&gt; anyone who hadn&#39;t had a child yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We now know that they contain Dioxin and this push for younger and younger<br/>
&gt; girls to use tampons would seem to correlate with the increase in various<br/>
&gt; cancers and the younger and younger age that women are getting cancer<br/>
&gt; (ovarian, cervical, uterine and breast).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, this is really weird because this seems to be a topic on several lists<br/>
&gt; right now so I have my whole Dioxin speel down.  Dioxin is in the top 10 of<br/>
&gt; known carcenogens.  It is the &quot;evil&quot; from Love Canal, etc.  It is fat<br/>
&gt; soluable, not water soluable which means it resides in fatty tissues and is<br/>
&gt; found in humans, mammals, birds and fish and seeks them out, so to speak.<br/>
&gt; Dioxin is the by-product of the bleaching process that cotton goes through<br/>
&gt; and is residual.  Rayon is also another problem as are the chemicals that<br/>
&gt; are put in tampons.  There are unbleached tampons available that are<br/>
&gt; chemical free.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt; This board has been quiet for a while. But I hope all you supportive moms<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere near your computers. I am having a Mother Moment I think and<br/>
&gt; need<br/>
&gt; &gt; some real good advice soon.<br/>
&gt; &gt; okay here is the situation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My dd is 81/2.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Over the weekend while she was at my girlfriends house, I went on a<br/>
&gt; cleaning<br/>
&gt; &gt; spree. In the process I found a pair of undies that I just bought for her<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; last weekend, rolled in a ball under her bed. There was signs of<br/>
&gt; &quot;spotting&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; on them .<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okay I know this is normal but 81/2? Isnt that a bit young , I was 11<br/>
&gt; myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; my sisters were both 14, my bestfriend was almost 16. Although I believe<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; husbands sisters were younger than that?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway I asked her about it and she seemed to not know what I was talking<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; about. I told her it was okay to tell me , even if it was a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; embarrassing but she insisted so I didnt push the issue. I called my<br/>
&gt; &gt; bestfriend who has a 12yod that went through this over the summer. Her 10<br/>
&gt; yod<br/>
&gt; &gt; just had a class on this in school she had some booklets tha she gave me<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bring home to my dd. which I did and she read them on her own , I left<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; out for her. when I asked her about it , she said &quot;Mom that is sick!&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried to make light of it and giggled and said I know but do you have any<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; questions? She said no and I thought maybe I should drop the subject for<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; &gt; .What do you guys think? I know shes a bit young to be able to grasp this<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; concept , so I dont want to freak her out, but at the same time I want to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; make sure she knows what shes doing too. She absolutely hates to go to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drs. and I think she is too young for that kind of Dr. Does anyone agree?<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; booklet also said that its okay to use Tampons for swimming, ?????? For<br/>
&gt; an 8<br/>
&gt; &gt; yo? I think not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anybody have answers or ideas as to handle this situation?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; HELP!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not ready Mom<br/>

&gt;    ...puberty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s how the mystery was solved.  As Colton was about to take a shower last<br/>
&gt; night, I heard him yank back the shower curtain.  Then he yelled for my help.<br/>
&gt;  I ran up to his bathroom to find him naked as the day he was born (only<br/>
&gt; considerably taller), clutching the shower curtain rod in his hands.  This<br/>
&gt; was nothing new to me because I&#39;ve experienced it too; the rod will fall<br/>
&gt; right off the wall if you pull too hard on the curtain.  While I was putting<br/>
&gt; the curtain rod back up, I smelled an unmistakable odor.  Was it really?<br/>
&gt; Could it be?  YES, it was.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    SWEAT!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    It didn&#39;t take long to pinpoint where the odor was coming from, since I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; just had my shower.  I congratulated Colton on growing up, found him a stick<br/>
&gt; deodorant in a manly &quot;cool breeze&quot; scent and told him how to use it.  Then I<br/>
&gt; set the deodorant on his bathroom counter, right next to the bottle of hair<br/>
&gt; gel which has recently taken up residence.  Yes, Colton is now *styling* his<br/>
&gt; hair, whereas six months ago he rarely combed it.  He wears it in a style I<br/>
&gt; think of as &quot;shiny bedhead,&quot; but my son assures me this is &quot;cool.&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t know, as I haven&#39;t been cool in 400 years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    Intellectually, I knew my son was growing up.  But I don&#39;t think with my<br/>

Nicholas is 9 1/2 too, and the other day I thought he&#39;d been out chewing on<br/>

and I showed him the deodorant that dad wears, and he put some on. He was<br/>
kind of smiling in an &quot;I told you my armpits stunk&quot; sort of way. He is very<br/>
