<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005034329">&quot;I have broken my record, friendos! 24hrs awake. Booya. Maybe i&#39;ll  <br/>
wake up on a normal schedule, though, it could happen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s from Holly, who&#39;s about 17 9/10 years old.<br/>
Why would a kid in a house without &quot;a bedtime&quot; get to the age of 17  <br/>
without staying awake 24 hours straight?<br/>
Because unless there&#39;s a reason not to, people go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve stayed up over 24 hours many times now, because of college work  <br/>
or fun, or camping where I sang and talked all night but needed to be  <br/>
up and responsible in the daytime, or sick kids when I was a mom, or  <br/>
friends showing up from many states away and talking and talking as we  <br/>
caught up.<br/>
<br/>
Now kids don&#39;t need to talk so much when they get together because  <br/>
they have twitter and texts between times. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

someone will mention something and everyone will just nod and say, &quot;Oh, <br/>
yeah.&quot; But they won&#39;t have anything to add. Then someone will say <br/>
something about something else - same reaction. And again. Finally <br/>
someone will say - so, I guess we already talked about all that stuff <br/>
enough on facebook, huh?<br/>

Kirby doesn&#39;t have and doesn&#39;t want facebook.  Same with Holly.  So  <br/>
either they&#39;ll be irritating friend-losing people, or sparkling  <br/>
conversationalists.  (or both; or neither &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Chamille was very anti facebook for a long time.  Then, her myspace got hacked by a disgruntled ex-friend with an aim to hurt, she did a bunch of viscous things and deleted all of her friends that she&#39;d collected for years.  <br/>
That was about it for her.  She remade it, but it&#39;s lost it zeal, and so she got a facebook to talk to people in the interim while she works her myspace back up.<br/>

and it made a certain 11 year old&#39;s day to have Holly talk World Records<br/>
with him and stay up and up and up ;)<br/>

life. This night will, for Hayden especially. Did I mention she used the<br/>
word *Record*?? To the boy with the 2007 Guinness paperback at his side at<br/>
his computer!!<br/>
AAaaaaaahhhh! It was a trust building experience!! now that I figured that<br/>
out, I&#39;m keeping her. ;)<br/>

have quiet available for those who need it, we sometimes have the funniest<br/>
conversations via text.. it works til we start laughing and have to move<br/>
ourselves anyway!!<br/>
Last night I walked into a room as Holly said to Hayden: &quot;If you continue to<br/>
count on someone who has shown themselves untrustworthy, some of the<br/>
responsibility falls on you.&quot; (though I don&#39;t think her grammar was as<br/>
klunky as my memory!)  When I tweeted it, she texted me that the inspiration<br/>
really came from Sandra&#39;s friend Jeff and *he* should be credited too. (I<br/>
just saw that Twitter didn&#39;t go thru, it&#39;s SENT now!)<br/>
I get smarter and nicer and calmer and more generous every single day that<br/>
she&#39;s here.<br/>
Thank you Sandra. She is a gift to me and my world. Ripples, the girl&#39;s<br/>
causin&#39; ripples!!!<br/>
