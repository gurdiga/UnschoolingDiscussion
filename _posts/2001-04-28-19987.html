 I just had to say, you crack me up girl!  And bravo to<br/>
 you for being so damned honest and not pulling your<br/>
 punches for the sake of convention.  It&#39;s refreshing<br/>
 to hear a grownup actually CUSS! (gasp) on a mailing<br/>
 list.  Most people (including me) are usually afraid<br/>
 to offend.  As to your questions for the editor, YOU<br/>
 GO GIRL!<br/>

is such a release for me. <br/>

&lt;&lt; ??? He just said that the xrays show arthritis forming.  He is an <br/>
orthopaedic surgeon and is requesting a 2nd opinion and a nerve test because <br/>
he can find no reason for the rest of the pain in my hand.  It is very <br/>
intense in the area he &quot;sees&quot; the arthritis (I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking <br/>
at) but the pain extends half way up my forearm and to my knuckles.  He says <br/>
this is not characteristic of arthritis.  All this started when an airbag <br/>
exploded while I was holding the steering wheel.  THANKS FOR ALL THE <br/>
SUGGESTIONS.  ambersand &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   I would also try acupuncture and cranial sacral work.<br/>
