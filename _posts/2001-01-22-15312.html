<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222898617">I&#39;ve found out that a friend of mine runs a couple of <br/>
pagan home-ed lists from her website, www.lytlwytch.com <br/>
 including an unschoolers&#39; list.  Hope this helps, and <br/>
it gets me off the hook, cos I volunteered somewhere <br/>
else for this!  LOL<br/>
