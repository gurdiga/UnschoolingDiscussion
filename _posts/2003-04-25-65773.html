<div id="ygrps-yiv-963080658">-=-I think you correspond with a woman I know in Maryland, her name is <br/>
Alysa.  She is a friend of my closest friend out there.  That&#39;s where I&#39;m <br/>
from. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help!  <br/>
Melanie in Moriarty, New Mexico wrote that.  Her address used to be<br/>
Lalunamama@aol but that&#39;s not working anymore and I want to help hook her up <br/>
with some other unschoolers here.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ask people all over the world, but that&#39;s one of the flukes of <br/>
online communications.  And with e-mail, it&#39;s wholly possible that someone in <br/>
New Zealand will know Melanie&#39;s e-mail while I, fifty miles away, have no <br/>
idea!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else is or knows New Mexico unschoolers, please ask them to write <br/>
to me.  We&#39;ll have something local going by summer.   Maybe by tomorrow. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
