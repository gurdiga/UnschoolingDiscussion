<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s interesting.  They must have changed the text of the book in the DVD.<br/>
&gt; In the book, the mother, when asked by her daughter if she broke their eggs,<br/>
&gt; or ran away etc., she responds by saying how she would feel (angry, sorry,<br/>
&gt; surprised, sad,) but would still love her, forever, because she was her Dear<br/>
&gt; One.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We loved that book.  It&#39;s what my son always wanted to read, especially if<br/>
the day had gone badly.  It&#39;s a major snuggle-book!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that somebody felt the need to make the DVD about obedience.  How<br/>
sad.<br/>
