<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997483762"><html><head></head>My son and I just started checking out our local homeschoolers’ park day (all types of homeschoolers). &nbsp;I’m looking for any tips to help make it go well.<div><br></div><div>Most of the moms stay together in a fenced area with the little siblings, while the 5-7 year olds have the run of the big kid playground. &nbsp;I only have the one child, so I can be with the kids to facilitate games and suggest fun things.</div><div><br></div><div>As it was, my son didn’t really enjoy it, because it seemed like a bunch of kids knew each other from before, and they ran around as a group and tried to get an adventure going. &nbsp;There weren’t any adventures to be had, though, so they ended up in loose team battles like boys vs girls and friend-kids vs new-kids.</div><div><br></div><div>What are games or activities or things I could suggest to start up a more inclusive kind of fun? &nbsp;Group games aren’t something I have any experience with.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,&nbsp;</div><div>Regan</div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12118375">If after a few weeks you DO want to introduce some games, though, Pam or Roya Sorooshian might be able to bring a link or two. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128954835"><div dir="ltr">Most of the park days that we have attended - inclusive secular homeschool groups - were meant primarily as free play days. The parents deliberately stay together to allow the kids the chance to devise their own games, while being available to help with any conflicts, and be the keepers of the snacks. <div><br></div><div>It will take at least a few weeks of consistent attendance before your son will be considered a regular fixture. Coming and going irregularly will get in the way of him making friends and being part of ongoing long games or plans. The others need to know that he will almost always be there, or always be there every other week, or whatever schedule you agree on - so that he becomes worth the mental energy or effort to make friends with. Otherwise he will always be the new kid. But once they know they can rely on him to be there, he will most likely feel more welcomed.</div><div><br></div><div>Don&#39;t be the annoying &quot;take over&quot; mom, that makes the kids (accustomed to free play) sorry to see you and your son arriving. </div><div><br></div><div>However, what has worked great as an ice breaker is to bring along something that is cool that you quietly set up, or just start to play with yourself. Sandra mentioned balls. Yes! People have brought stomp rockets, badminton sets, crafty things or puzzles laid out on a blanket, kites, paper airplanes, scooters, really cool sand toys, dress up boxes, and remote control cars (James of course) at different times. </div><div><br></div><div>Some park day groups will have an activity day once a month or every other month. In the past we have had &quot;take apart days&quot; and special dress up picnics around various holidays (eg Thanksgiving), or fancier craft days where someone brings a bunch of supplies (clay always goes down well) - these tend to be pre-planned and announced.</div><div><br></div><div><div dir="ltr">Robyn L.
