<div id="ygrps-yiv-239699180">Ha, I didn&#39;t want to say typical day because there really is none.  Some days <br/>
we are out all day running errands, others we are in.  What is typical is <br/>
that my children &quot;always&quot;  find something interesting and intriguing to do <br/>
regardless of where we are or what we are doing.<br/>
Tuesday March 28, 2000<br/>
*wake up to dh&#39;s voice on the answering machine saying wake up I need to talk <br/>
to you &lt;g&gt; at 6:30.  Get up talk to him and go back to bed.  He calls back <br/>
again at 7 am, talk to him and go back to bed again.  Finally get back up at <br/>
8 or 8:30.  Jared is trying to get us all up (they all were in my bed this <br/>
am) and makes zach a duplo airplane<br/>
*kids eat apples<br/>
*kids build marble run toy<br/>
*kids eat cereal<br/>
*I go to office, drink coffee, read email, work on some business reports<br/>
kids read books.  jessica cant&#39; find a couple of bob books so she starts on a <br/>
new one.  I help her out a bit.<br/>
*kids see cricket in house.  set up elaborate &quot;trap&quot; to catch it.  tie wash <br/>
cloth filled with grass to a string which is attached to a small bug cage.   <br/>
They put the kitchen chairs all around them and hide under them with the bait <br/>
sitting out in the open. cricket never comes back out. mom takes pictures &lt;g&gt;<br/>
*zach plays cars<br/>
*kids put on cowboy boots and hats and put on a song/dance themed after toy <br/>
story 2 and their family<br/>
*zach and jared play lego and duplo<br/>
*jared runs around trying to scare kids, they decide to make scary masks.  <br/>
Get construction paper as me to cut out eye holes.  They punch holes and <br/>
bring string for me to tie onto mask.  jareds mask is white, he gets to be a <br/>
ghost.  jess and zach are boogeymans with black masks.  run around and play <br/>
this for awhile.<br/>
*kids find rocks in the yard and wash them in a bowl in the kitchen.  never <br/>
knew what that was all about as I was working in the office.<br/>
*me empty dishwasher, put away load of laundry, start load, fix lunch.  kids <br/>
read more books while I clean bathrooms since I am having friends come over <br/>
to scrapbook tomorrow.  jump in the shower and get out of jammies at 1 pm!<br/>
*kids decide to paint pictures.  zach is a little disappointed that his <br/>
pictures aren&#39;t quite as &quot;good&quot; as Jessica&#39;s although they are very good to <br/>
me. He has a bit of trouble with hand coordination (perfectly reasonable for <br/>
his age) trying to do fine artwork.  I can still tell what he is painting <br/>
never the less.  jared is proud of his grey blob LOL.<br/>
*I go back into the office to do more paper work, take and make calls.  talk <br/>
to mom about some business (mom and dad retired contractors) and about jareds <br/>
upcoming birthday<br/>
*kids run around outside for awhile, climb trees. weather a bit cold and <br/>
cloudy they seem to enjoy staying inside today.<br/>
*eat bowls of kiwi <br/>
*start dinner. albondigas soup (meatball)<br/>
*jess finds a counting book we put together, she tells me she doesn&#39;t need it <br/>
anymore since she knows how to count and proceeds to do so.  She said that <br/>
the boys can use it.<br/>
*kids decide to clean the entire house counters, walls, furniture and windows <br/>
with wet rags and towels.  they spend easily a couple of hours doing this!!  <br/>
jess takes a break to paint another picture, a beautiful painting of one of <br/>
our blooming fruit trees.  zach tells me he loves to clean!!  <br/>
*take more calls check on zach and he is emptying out and cleaning my <br/>
cupboard!!  I am amazed at his zealousness as he absolutely hates to pick up. <br/>
 guess cleaning is another thing altogether for him.<br/>
*jared finally takes a break to nurse and falls asleep at 5:30!  kids snack <br/>
on carrots waiting for me to serve the soup.  zach still cleaning, standing <br/>
on my island cleaning the ceiling fan and light.<br/>
*wake jared up so that I can feed kids, he&#39;s not to happy crying a bit.  <br/>
Decides he&#39;ll eat dinner after all.  I eat with kids.<br/>
*zach decides to clean some more and heads off to his bedroom with his rags <br/>
in hand.<br/>
*dad comes home, kids and I compete for dads attention as soon as he comes <br/>
home &lt;g&gt;.  dad and I need to talk business, kids need to show dad all their <br/>
new tricks.  <br/>
*feed dad, we all have another bowl of soup.  dad and I put together a bid <br/>
for upcoming project.<br/>
*zach and jared (and me) vacuum their room since they gleefully crushed <br/>
cereal on the floor earlier today.  jessie takes a shower. I do another load <br/>
of laundry.<br/>
*kids settle down temporarily while dad makes calls.<br/>
*everyone wrestles around on the bed<br/>
*have a snack, cuddle, dad heads off to bed<br/>
*boys make duplo airplanes and throw them through the air watching them fly <br/>
and crash<br/>
*kids fall asleep on the couch next to me (they wanted to sleep on the couch <br/>
tonight) around 9:30 (much earlier than last night when they layed there and <br/>
jessica narrated stories until 11:30!<br/>
*all is quiet and its 10:15<br/>
*another day is done : )<br/>
<br/>
I am not usually this busy in my office, depends on the work schedule.  We <br/>
had played and ran around for three days in a row late  last week so <br/>
yesterday and today I had things to take care of, and tomorrow is a play day <br/>
with company coming over.  <br/>
