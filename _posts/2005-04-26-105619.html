<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007388802">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
What has been people&#39;s impressions of the Life Learning magazine?  I&#39;m considering a subscription, and wonder whether the content will be a good support for my confidence as an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

anti-tv stuff not too long ago (thanks to people here, the &quot;other side&quot; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like both and find them slightly different in flavor. I find LL more <br/>
theoretical, non-coercive and TCS (taking children seriously) while <br/>
LFLF, though new, seems to be more practical, homespun kind of stuff. <br/>
Interestingly, the editorial policies seem to reflect this in a way: LL <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to use the term &quot;unschooling&quot; while LFLF doesn&#39;t like to <br/>
use the term &quot;non-coercive parenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just my own sense of the differences, for what they&#39;re worth.<br/>

<br/>
I noticed the anti-tv/video in the issue I happened upon with Life <br/>
Learning - and since this is one of my weaker points, I&#39;m glad there&#39;s <br/>
another choice in magazines.  I&#39;ve checked out the Live Free Learn Free, and <br/>
will likely start with that one!  Thank-you!<br/>

Me also too.<br/>
And I think I&#39;m going to be in the next issue (or the issue after next) of <br/>
both of them.  I wrote a new article on my kids learning to read for Live Free, <br/>
Learn Free, and a transcript of the radio interview I did for &quot;radio free <br/>
school&quot; is to be published in Life Learning magazine, submitted by Beatrice Edwa <br/>
Ekoko who interviewed me and edited it into a half hour show.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
the published version will be all of what&#39;s here:<br/>

Learning is very nice, though, and I enjoy it. <br/>
<br/>
I prefer Live Free Learn Free because I haven&#39;t seen any ads in there<br/>
for anything like that.  I may be partial since they have printed two<br/>
or three of my own articles though. ;-)<br/>
