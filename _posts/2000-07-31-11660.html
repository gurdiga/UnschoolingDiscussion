<div id="ygrps-yiv-422682216">This is a heads-up for anyone else who may suffer the same fate, <br/>
and a thankful apology for anyone who&#39;s had to endure my whining <br/>
about my computer over the past few days.  I found out tonight that <br/>
my computer is set up for Belguim.  Now, for an American <br/>
company, shipping to England, I guess Belgium&#39;s not that far <br/>
away.  Only a different language, currency, way of writing <br/>
numbers...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for listening and I hope the same fate never befalls <br/>
anyone else.<br/>
