<div id="ygrps-yiv-210041051">Ahhhh, lower Columbia County is NOT Upstate!!!!   LOL<br/>
I say I live near Albany, people say, oh you&#39;re upstate.  Now I used to live <br/>
in Plattsburgh near the Canadian border....that&#39;s upstate!!!  It all depends <br/>
on how you look at it.  Everyone in the city (NY city) says anything north of <br/>
the city is upstate....in other words the rest of the state!<br/>
