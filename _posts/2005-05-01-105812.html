&gt; allowed (especially concerning matters of faith). We are all <br/>
&gt; Christians, and I trust that we will act as such.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does this imply that either non-Christians never sign up or you really <br/>
aren&#39;t welcome once you&#39;re discovered not to be Christian?<br/>
