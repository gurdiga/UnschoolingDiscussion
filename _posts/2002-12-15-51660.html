<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477027128">Here&#39;s something from a few weeks back.  I took out the name of the person, <br/>
but it&#39;s a homeschooler in New Mexico.  I&#39;m bringing this because of the <br/>
question of whether everything labelled unschooling is equally valid.  I <br/>
think there&#39;s a continuum along which people move as far as they&#39;re <br/>
comfortable, and sometimes it takes examples or pointed questions for them to <br/>
see how to move a little further along.  <br/>
<br/>
Over eleven years of homeschooling,  I&#39;ve seen hundreds of families move from <br/>
structure to less structure and GUSH about how thrilled they were.  I&#39;ve seen <br/>
a few (a couple of dozen) families move from what they claim was unschooling <br/>
to go toward structure.  And on closer examination, when they would allow it, <br/>
it seemed they didn&#39;t really get unschooling, or somehow it never took at <br/>
their house.  (Because they didn&#39;t relax?  Because they didnt&#39; believe it was <br/>
going to work?  Because they couldn&#39;t stop the background noise of their <br/>
relatives saying &quot;When are you doing to TEACH them things&quot;?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s an exmple:<br/>

Hi Sandra –<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I attended a forum at the Rio Grande Homeschooling conference where you spoke <br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I have to tell you that I thought it was a crock at the time.  I believed <br/>
that the only way to truly teach a child was to make them do worksheets, <br/>
drill and repetition.  Since hearing you speak, my husband and I have <br/>
discussed our approach to teaching many times.   I was slowly starting to <br/>
realize the benefits of an unschooling approach.  Reading an article by <br/>
Daniel Quinn (link below) was the last straw.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I’m not ready to throw away all of my curriculum, but I am definitely making <br/>
the move toward a more relaxed, child led style.   I’m going to see myself <br/>
much more as a nurturer of Connor’s love of reading  and learning, rather <br/>
than an instructor. <br/>
<br/>
I thank you (and my kids would too, if they knew) for your inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You’ve probably already seen this – but here’s the link to Daniel Quinn’s <br/>
article.  I don’t agree with all of his ideas.    Most are probably truer <br/>
than I’m willing to admit.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,</div>

I have the strange notion that maybe we should make a party game out of<br/>
this and cheerfully tell people &quot;you&#39;re getting warmer&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re<br/>
getting cold&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if that would be any easier to take.  It might make the<br/>
feedback less disturbing... but sometimes the goal IS to disturb people<br/>
and shake them out of their existing patterns.<br/>

<br/>
The implication seems to be (and we&#39;ve had people come and say this before) <br/>
that you had a paradigm shift to unschooling with no change in what you had <br/>
believed before, no revision of your practices or beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Describing how you came to unschooling and what it&#39;s like for your family <br/>
would be really helpful.  Suggesting that those who are here are just vaguely <br/>
wrong isn&#39;t so helpful.<br/>

someone to  tell me, straight out, that there was a better way. Since we are <br/>
human, I believe there will always be a better way. I can be a better cook, <br/>
better scrapbooker, better wife, better daughter, better mom, better <br/>
unschooler. Once I stop and say, I&#39;ve found it, i&#39;ve reached the pinnacle. <br/>
There is no more better, only worse. That to me would be sad, to know there <br/>
is only worse.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have been disturbed enoiugh. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So you came to your changes through things that shook up your thinking.<br/>
So did all of us.<br/>
<br/>
To complain about the shake-ups necessary for someone to move from worrying <br/>
about how their children will learn to read by the time they&#39;re seven to <br/>
getting unschooling seems counter to the needs of readers of the list.  <br/>
<br/>
If you were in ACOA meetings defending someone&#39;s desire to idealize an <br/>
alcoholic parent, and to justify the ways in which they were neglected or <br/>
abused, wouldn&#39;t some other member want you to stop so that those who needed <br/>
to get past that could do so?<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not suggesting that parallels anything that happened here, but it is in <br/>
principle similar to badmouthing this list for seeming harsh to people who <br/>
are clinging to school-based practices or beliefs.)<br/>

about our children.<br/>
<br/>
(I don&#39;t want to quote it all, but that is the best response to the paragraph <br/>
above, so I hope you&#39;ve all just read it not long before this and remember <br/>
it.)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people say &quot;I&#39;m an unschooler,&quot; but if they come here and give advice <br/>
which will serve to place or reinforce a wedge between parents and children, <br/>
I for one (and I could name some others) will take the part of the child and <br/>
say &quot;There is a better way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-We are  not all the same and so not all need the same...just like our <br/>
children.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to work, there are things all children need.  When a point of <br/>
philosophy is leaning toward traditional &quot;parental rights&quot; and away from <br/>
what&#39;s trusting and empowering of a child, I take the child&#39;s side over the <br/>
parent&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I know women are used to &quot;support group&quot; mentality, and tea-party manners, <br/>
where they go somewhere and &quot;get support&quot; (traditionally in the form of <br/>
nodding and gushing and saying &quot;You&#39;re so right,&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s so true&quot;).  <br/>
Then they go away feeling &quot;supported,&quot; rarely thinking to realize that those <br/>
women just say &quot;you&#39;re so right and that&#39;s so true&quot; to just about anything <br/>
and then roll their eyes after the person&#39;s gone.    That kind of support <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen on this list.  There are lists where that does happen, and I <br/>
think it&#39;s a waste of time for someone who actually does want to discuss nuts <br/>
and bolts philosophy.  But most people go their whole life in avoidance of <br/>
honest analysis of what and why.  That&#39;s okay if that&#39;s what they want.  They <br/>
have their tea parties and support groups, and I have my real discussions of <br/>
actual situations.<br/>

 <br/>
Don&#39;t some types of writing styles reach some people and other styles reach different people.     This is so important, to have all sorts,   <br/>
 <br/>
When I first came to this list, I have to be honest and say I was a little put back at some comments I received.    But I would then analyze what I was feeling and realize that what I was saying  didn&#39;t coincide with unschooling philosophies.    Even if I thought it did.      And I&#39;m glad people have been honest,    some people may think its harsh or whatever,   but I also needed that honesty.          If there was beating around the bush I might still be floundering in alot of uncertainties.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For one thing this topic is way too vague. If we can&#39;t hear it ourselves<br/>
obviously no one has a clue what posts you&#39;re talking about! So how can an<br/>
attitude that we are oblivious to be discussed?<br/>
<br/>
For another thing, the topic of how people post recurs every 3 months or so.<br/>
It&#39;s been going on for years. The only result is that a lot of mean words<br/>
and hurtful things get said.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helps tremendously if you read assuming something is being said in a<br/>
gentle voice by your best friend. People are trying to help the best way<br/>
they know how.<br/>
<br/>
But even with a new tone some people will never &quot;get&quot; some other people.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean what they have to say isn&#39;t valuable to someone else. It<br/>
just means that you should perhaps skip their posts.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to email me the posts you&#39;re having trouble with I can discuss<br/>
them with you -- unless of course they&#39;re mine! -- but it&#39;s derailing the<br/>
list further from discussing unschooling.<br/>
