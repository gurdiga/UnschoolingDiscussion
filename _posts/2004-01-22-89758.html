<div id="ygrps-yiv-74435787">Joyce,<br/>
<br/>
You responded to my &quot;interesting comments from my husband&quot; email with <br/>
a fabulous post that really really was great at helping him see <br/>
unschooling from a different perspective.  Showing how it&#39;s not so <br/>
much a better way than school but a different life altogher from <br/>
school...that it is better to learn by pursuing interests than to be <br/>
coerced. Somehow, even tho I swear I have said things similar before, <br/>
he just &quot;got it&quot; more this time.  I read your post to him while he <br/>
was taking a bath, so we got to talk about alot of the points you <br/>
made. (I didn&#39;t just email it to him at work.) I did read other&#39;s <br/>
posts too, but your seemed to jump out him. He&#39;s not &quot;there&quot; yet, but <br/>
much more willing to give it a shot.  Oh, I could just kiss you, <br/>
Joyce!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
