<div id="ygrps-yiv-852736981">The article came up with my yahoo alert (which looks for  <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;) and was on the Monterey Herald website.<br/>
<br/>
I love this part:<br/>
<br/>
---&quot;I think the one reason that stands out from the rest is that I  <br/>
felt that my kids were losing that incredible spark they had before  <br/>
they entered school,&quot; Deanne Brown said.<br/>
<br/>
---&quot;As young children they were curious, imaginative and full of  <br/>
spunk. Learning was natural and fun,&quot; she said. &quot;After being in  <br/>
school for a few years I saw their natural curiosity, imagination and  <br/>
love for learning being crushed by rules and conditioning. Learning  <br/>
became a task.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad they quoted that!  Too often, the good parts people say  <br/>
are left out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And as usual, they think any old &quot;expert&quot; has had half a chance to be  <br/>
&quot;convinced&quot; just on some passing reference to unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---&quot;I think the downsides would be related to teachers who don&#39;t  <br/>
understand putting parameters around children&#39;s decision making,&quot;  <br/>
said Jill Fox, an associate professor of education at the University  <br/>
of Texas at Arlington.<br/>
<br/>
---&quot;It&#39;s one thing to allow children to choose to study Amelia  <br/>
Earhart before studying Harriet Tubman, with the clear understanding  <br/>
that both will be studied thoroughly during the school year. It is  <br/>
another thing to allow children to study Muhammad Ali and completely  <br/>
skip over what the state standards or district curriculum require,&quot;  <br/>
Fox said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.  I&#39;m sorry, but a big &quot;WHATever&quot; is welling up in me.  There is  <br/>
just nothing that makes the stories of Amelia Earhart or Harriet  <br/>
Tubman more important than any other single American with a biography  <br/>
worth knowing.  Neither was the only one in her field.  They&#39;ve just  <br/>
been tagged as icons, and the school system wants to touch all the  <br/>
icons.   And &quot;during THE year&quot;?  as though they&#39;re both &quot;studied  <br/>
thoroughly&quot; every year (or ANY year).<br/>
<br/>
And this is just the chit-chat of nonsense:<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Teachers -- and parents -- have to keep in mind that children&#39;s  <br/>
decision-making skills are not yet fully developed. They don&#39;t quite  <br/>
understand cause-and-effect and often don&#39;t realize the consequences  <br/>
they may face as a result of their decisions.&quot;-=<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WHAT decision!?  The &quot;decision&quot; not to &quot;study thoroughly&quot; Amelia  <br/>
Earhart?    It&#39;s not too late!  If they hear her name and know who  <br/>
she is, fine.  If they hear her name and don&#39;t have any idea, maybe  <br/>
they&#39;ll wonder, and in finding out who she is, they will learn about  <br/>
her.  Sheeesh...  My kids might know about her because of the ballad  <br/>
which they probably heard me sing with my friend Dave a time or three  <br/>
when they were little, and if they don&#39;t, that&#39;s fine.  If they asked  <br/>
me who she was I&#39;d sing some or all of that four verse song, and tell  <br/>
them to google for photos.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great article.  If only they had let one of us do a final pass  <br/>
before the published!  I could have said &quot;ARE, not &#39;could be,&#39; is  <br/>
what he said&quot; about this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Most trace the origins of unschooling to an approach devised by  <br/>
educator John Holt in the 1970s. He believed that children could be  <br/>
natural learners, instead of requiring formal schooling.-=-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Prior to having read this, at 10:50 p.m. this evening near the dairy  <br/>
section of the grocery store this evening, I asked Holly if she knew  <br/>
who Harriet Tubman and Amelia Earhart were.  She said no, not  <br/>
really.  I gave her a light gloss, and by the time we got to the  <br/>
checkout stand we had decided Amelia Earhart had something in common  <br/>
with Elvis—both were reportedly seen alive or dead in various places  <br/>
over a couple of decades.<br/>
<br/>
The song about Amelia Earhart wouldn&#39;t have lasted so long, either,  <br/>
if it didn&#39;t include the great line &quot;in shark-infested waters her  <br/>
plane went down that night  / in the blue Pacific to her  watery  <br/>
grave.&quot;  Any excuse to sing &quot;shark infested waters.&quot;  And the harmony  <br/>
is good on the chorus too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll sing it at the conference in Albuquerque this fall, and  <br/>
for those in whom any part of the song sticks, there&#39;s an Amelia  <br/>
Earhart hook to hang things on for all time (or a while, anyway).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289357121">I went to public school and I most likely &quot;studied&quot; Amelia Earhart and<br/>
Harriet Tubman.  Without cheating with google lol, I&#39;ll tell you what I<br/>
think I know about each one.<br/>
<br/>
Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic ocean solo,<br/>
but I think she died in a consecutive trip.  Now that I think about it, I<br/>
may have only just deduced that from Sandra&#39;s song so that part may not<br/>
count.  Not sure if that was already in my brain or not.<br/>
<br/>
Harriet Tubman ~  well, I know she was a black woman.  I&#39;ll guess that she<br/>
helped with the underground railroad or wrote a book.  For some reason I am<br/>
placing her after the civil war now that I think about it.  Not sure why<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
OK, now I&#39;ll go google them and see what I should have known.  Btw, I got<br/>
very good grades in school despite my poor ability to retreive information<br/>
about these people now.  I was a great test taker but I mostly only used my<br/>
short term memory.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I went to public school and didn&#39;t study either one of them.  I  <br/>
studied Jane Addams, but not much.  Read a bio in 4th grade, and  <br/>
later she was mentioned in a history class.  That has to do with  <br/>
social services, and the improvements in lives of children and women  <br/>
(in that order, as I understood it at the time) in the late 19th  <br/>
century.<br/>
<br/>
Had I gone to public school in the 1970&#39;s or later, Amelia Earhart  <br/>
and Harriet Tubman would&#39;ve been in there more prominently, because  <br/>
the educational reform movement of the early 70&#39;s pressed schools to  <br/>
stop ignoring women and minorities so much.  And I guess it has gone  <br/>
so far the other direction now that some professional is all a-swoon  <br/>
at the idea that a year could pass without an in-depth study of  <br/>
Amelia Earhart and Harriet Tubman.<br/>
<br/>
I did read about both of them in school, but it wasn&#39;t &quot;study,&quot; it  <br/>
was the SRA reading lab cards.  That&#39;s where I learned about Vesuvius  <br/>
covering Pompeii, too, and the wreck of the Titanic (because I didn&#39;t  <br/>
know the ballad yet in those days &lt;g&gt;).  Those cards weren&#39;t for  <br/>
studying, though, they were for quickie reading comprehension.  No  <br/>
problem!  I learned more from those than from textbooks, I think,  <br/>
when I was 11 years old.   That kind of info has come to my kids from  <br/>
TV, magazines, trivia books and the internet.  I read to one of them,  <br/>
Holly I think, from &quot;Eyewitness to History,&quot; Pliny&#39;s account of the  <br/>
eruption, and told her how they destroyed some of the &quot;mysterious  <br/>
bubbles&quot; that turned out to be people, before figuring out what they  <br/>
were.  After that, when the excavation teams came to a bubble in the  <br/>
strata, they filled it with plaster or concrete or something, and  <br/>
that&#39;s how they got all those forms of people fallen, or huddled.   <br/>
But they did miss a few before they solved their mystery.<br/>

It&#39;s an old-timey-toward-blue-grass kind of tune (the version I know,  <br/>
anyway), and has harmonies like gospel music/revival-hymn stuff.<br/>
<br/>
And the chorus is very sing-alongish, but can use people who can  <br/>
harmonize in thirds, on both the main line and the counter thing:<br/>
<br/>

      (to the bottom of the sea)<br/>
<br/>
It was sad when that great ship went down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did it at a folk club meeting at an upstairs room in a pub in a  <br/>
little town near Cambridge England in the late 70&#39;s.  Great singers,  <br/>
very enthusiastic, could harmonize, but when they got to the bottom  <br/>
of the sea (the line, I mean), they pronounced &quot;bottom&quot; with SUCH a  <br/>
hard &quot;t&quot; that I laughed and could hardly continue.  I had to breath  <br/>
carefully to build up to that part, which came four more times so  <br/>
that I didn&#39;t laugh anymore.   In American English and in the  <br/>
southern dialect that song&#39;s from, bottom is &quot;bahdum&quot; but they had a  <br/>
very &quot;bouhgTTTomb&quot; kind of thing going that I could hardly sing  <br/>
over.  Fun memory.<br/>

<br/>
[Vicki Dennis]   I remember the SRA  reading &quot;lab&quot;.   I absolutely loved it.<br/>
Can&#39;t remember if it was sixth or seventh grade but do remember that my only<br/>
complaint was that we could not have class &quot;discussions&quot;  about the<br/>
different cards.    Those discussions were the boring texts.  But, not to<br/>
worry.........we passed information about the more interesting cards<br/>
(forming unofficial &quot;waitlists&quot; for particular ones!)  at recess.     You<br/>
can tell how old I am................we still had &quot;free play&quot;  recess at<br/>
