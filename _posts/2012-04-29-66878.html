<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303662974">A friend who I know from my doll collecting community asked me to write an article for her Yoga focused blog on homeschooling. I hesitated because I don&#39;t really like to make a big deal about unschooling as it is so easily misunderstood and it&#39;s always a bit unnerving going public with our life style. But I decided to do it because I thought the readers of this particular blog would be more amenable to the ideas expressed and also because I wanted my friend to know about this option since she has an autistic child and has gone through the mill with the public school system. I had never heard about unschooling before I started homeschooling my daughter 3 years ago. Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s websites made such a huge difference in my life. I thought I&#39;d take a risk and come out of the closet about my way of homeschooling in hopes it might help someone else. Below is a link the article if you are interested in reading about my experience. I do hope I&#39;ve expressed  the philosophy of unschooling fairly and presented it in a realistic way. It was hard to do in such a short article which was supposed to be upbeat and to the point. I&#39;d welcome your comments. (PS the pictures in the article are not of me and my daughter - they&#39;re stock photos). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096489441">I like the article.  I have two quibbles.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Sandra Dodd and Pam Sarooshian. Sandra Dodd�s Big Book of Unschooling.  Lulu; 2009.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian wrote the foreword.  Her name is misspelled there.  If you&#39;re going to list her even though she&#39;s not a co-author, please do spell her name correctly. :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Unschooling revealed a way to respect Katy�s interests and skills and put me in the role of learning facilitator and partner rather than authoritarian instructor/antagonist. Another name for unschooling is �peaceful parenting.� -=-<br/>
<br/>
I kind of like that.  It&#39;s not true, but I still like it. :-)<br/>
We can&#39;t set up &quot;peaceful parenting&quot; as another name for unschooling, because it implies that anyone who doesn&#39;t unschool isn&#39;t being peaceful, and that everyone who unschools IS being peaceful.  <br/>
<br/>
Other than that and the mystery of using a stock photo (rather than no photo at all) I liked it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Home Education Magazine used (still, if it still exists, probably) stock photos for covers, so none of those cover images were unschoolers at all.  I don&#39;t like that, but then I&#39;m the one who didn&#39;t like people not using real names, so it might be a personal problem. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877246887">I’m emailing the editor to make sure Pam’s name is spelled correctly. I think I’ll ask her to change the wording of the “peaceful parenting” statement so it’s not so much a definition. I didn’t want Katy’s and my picture on the blog that’s why she chose to use a stock photo. The doll pictures are real though. I’m glad the article passed muster. It was really to hard to get the idea of unschooling across in such a short piece.  My editor cut out a lot.  This group has helped me so much. Thank you.    <br/>
