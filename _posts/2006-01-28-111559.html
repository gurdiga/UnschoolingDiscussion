<div id="ygrps-yiv-141070475">Hi, new to this message board idea, never attempted it beore in my <br/>
life. My husband and I have a 14 yr old son.  His education history <br/>
is this:k-1 public, 2-4 priviate christian, 5-7 public, 8 not truly <br/>
unschooled, 9 (currently) accredited online homeschool (morning star <br/>
academy).  My delimma is this my husband and I both work, truly out <br/>
of necessity.  It would be my absoulte dream to stay home for what <br/>
is left of my son&#39;s time with us, but finanacially impossible.  As <br/>
it is I work part time for full time pay, arranged with boss with no <br/>
raises for the past several years, just decreasingly less hours. We <br/>
don&#39;t work to upkeep a lifestyle, we work to feed, house and cloth <br/>
ourselves literally.  Any way back to my point, my son is doing good <br/>
at online school but has to have lots of prompting to complete the <br/>
work and only does the bare minimum required. I am truly <br/>
considering  unschooling for the rest of his highschool years, but i <br/>
am concerned about his lack of motivation.  He is interested in <br/>
video games and yugioh trading cards and tv.  He only has 2 come to <br/>
the <br/>
house friends and never goes to their house.  He does attend youth <br/>
group 2x weekly and ejoys it.  He goes every saturday to card <br/>
tournament with around 20-30 other participants and interacts.  I <br/>
have only in the last couple of months come to grips with the fact <br/>
that this is good thing...the video games and card tournaments and <br/>
collecting cards, and my acceptance has helped him feel better, but <br/>
I worry that he shows no interest in absolutely anything else, in <br/>
fact he even hates to go outside and goof off and <br/>
don&#39;t know if unschooling will help unleash interest or not? Please <br/>
give any insight into this matter that you can, i&#39;m very interested.</div>

 <br/>
We had semi-unschooled for a couple of years, but it wasn&#39;t until this  year <br/>
that I finally completely let go.  I have 5 at home (2 foster kids  have to go <br/>
to school.)  All the years that we homeschooled (which has been  my 17 yo <br/>
son&#39;s entire life) I struggled, fussed, pushed, and agonized that he  wasn&#39;t <br/>
motivated.  I couldn&#39;t get him to read a book for &quot;pleasure&quot; to save  his life (I <br/>
know I&#39;m exaggerating, but that&#39;s how it felt).  It was like  this with all <br/>
the kids, but since my son sounds a lot like yours, I&#39;ll use him  as an example.<br/>
 <br/>
When I finally let go, he started doing amazing things.  He finally  picked <br/>
up his guitar and actually started teaching himself.  He went on the  internet <br/>
and found instructions, songs, recordings.  For YEARS I had tried  to get him <br/>
interested in music, including teaching them how to read music  (nominally) <br/>
and when I finally let go, he did it himself!<br/>
 <br/>
Like I mentioned, he never wanted to read.  He&#39;d read what he was  &quot;made&quot; to <br/>
read to do his schoolwork, but that was it.  When I let go,  suddenly he&#39;s <br/>
finding books he can&#39;t set down.  Yesterday, he was helping  my husband with <br/>
stuff around here, and suddenly stopped and said, &quot;Dad, can we  take a break and <br/>
finish this later?  I have to get to the library before  they close so I can <br/>
get the next book.&quot;  (in the series he&#39;s  reading.)  <br/>
 <br/>
He has started working out with weights, and has a &quot;plan&quot; that he goes  by, <br/>
and he&#39;s stuck with it pretty well.  He checks out cool videos at the  library <br/>
(National Geographic, etc) and actually enjoys them.  We have lots  of cool <br/>
discusstions about things.  <br/>
 <br/>
His computer knowledge has increased, as he&#39;s helped my husband set up our  <br/>
household system (we have 5 computers hooked up).  He&#39;s learning the DVD  <br/>
making program, and him and another son have plans of making a movie.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s like, we spent all that time before fretting and fussing over  <br/>
curriculum, gotta get it done, oh crap, it&#39;s getting late in the day, hurry up  and get <br/>
your schoolwork done!  Oh no, now it&#39;s getting late in the year, we  still <br/>
have all these books we have to finish...come on, we have to sit down and  get <br/>
this done!  <br/>
 <br/>
All of our lives have improved since I just let go.  I don&#39;t &quot;do  <br/>
nothing&quot;...I still offer a lot of stuff to the kids.  If I see a book I  think one child <br/>
might like, I&#39;ll buy it (cartoon drawing, manga, water painting,  etc.)  I <br/>
pick up a lot of movies at the library, and I send them a lot of  stuff I find on <br/>
the internet that I think they might like.  We go to the  library and get a <br/>
TON of books each week.  Sometimes they only look at  them, sometimes they read <br/>
a few, sometimes they spend hours reading, and  sometimes they barely touch <br/>
them, but THEY picked them out, they are books that  interest THEM.  And I&#39;ll <br/>
pick out an art book (one of those huge coffee  table types) each week, and a <br/>
few science type books, and they can look at them,  or not.  I spend a lot of <br/>
time with them, but the time isn&#39;t spent  stressing out over what they know and <br/>
don&#39;t know.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>========================<br/>
<br/>
I would keep prompting him and not expect anything more than the bare  <br/>
minimum.   He&#39;s been in school a long time, and if he&#39;s going to be  <br/>
doing this on his own, at least he&#39;ll get a diploma or certificate,  <br/>
right?  And he&#39;ll still have time to do a bunch of gaming?    Maybe  <br/>
he can get a GED and stop doing the schooling pretty soon.  Maybe he  <br/>
could take a class or two at a community college?  (Let&#39;s don&#39;t  <br/>
discuss all that here, but you might look into those things for next  <br/>
year or the year after.)<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t stay home with him, unschooling might still work.   <br/>
Figure out how many waking hours there are when you&#39;re not at work,  <br/>
and spend lots of them with your son.<br/>

How awesome, it almost sounds like a fairy tale to someone like me <br/>
like i&#39;m on the outside looking in. I want this so bad i can taste <br/>
it.  Your family truly sounds amazing!  My son wants to work really <br/>
bad to earn money to use to do things with that he likes, do you <br/>
think that can be incorporated into the learning experience in terms <br/>
of using it on his transcript?  He&#39;s only 14 so I&#39;m just not sure <br/>
about working.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure!  Not sure he will need &quot;a transcript,&quot; but what he learns  <br/>
working and dealing with money is not &quot;time out&quot; from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest (now 19) worked in a gaming shop from the time he turned  <br/>
14.  He had been hanging out there and volunteering to help pick  <br/>
chairs up after gaming sessions, and helped with store bulk-mailings  <br/>
and such, and when they asked how old he was and he said &quot;thirteen,&quot;  <br/>
he said the boss looked disappointed.  I told him &quot;Probably because  <br/>
they want to hire you.&quot;  Sure enough, the next time he went in the  <br/>
owner asked, &quot;When&#39;s your birthday?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a letter explaining that state law here is flexible about  <br/>
homeschooling schedules, and so they could deal with the child labor  <br/>
laws easily. Home schoolers declare their own &quot;school days,&quot; so the  <br/>
laws about how late the night before or how early in the daytime one  <br/>
could work could be flexible.  They pretty much had him work the same  <br/>
kinds of hours as if he had been in school, I think to keep the peace  <br/>
(because the store is in the corner of strip mall surrounded 270  <br/>
degrees by a high school, though all their customers knew Kirby was  <br/>
homeschooled).<br/>
<br/>
Kirby worked there for four years, and now works at a pizza  <br/>
restaurant.   Both can go on a resume, and the things he learned at  <br/>
the gaming shop certainly &quot;counted&quot; toward his life learning.   If  <br/>
you&#39;re in a position of needing to note what he&#39;s &quot;studied,&quot; you  <br/>
could take elements of what he will do at jobs (volunteer or paid) in  <br/>
the future into account, for sure.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Support his interests - you don&#39;t need to question them - it is  <br/>
enough that that is what he wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter worked starting at 15 - worked full time for a  <br/>
couple of years. She learned so much that it would take me hours to  <br/>
write it all down. But just this morning, she was reading a book for  <br/>
a class in management that she&#39;s taking at her college and she got  <br/>
all excited and read several pages of the book to me and then  <br/>
reminded me about something that had happened at the place she&#39;d  <br/>
worked when she was 15 and talked about how that demonstrated exactly  <br/>
what her book was talking about. ONE of the things she learned a lot  <br/>
about was management - she wasn&#39;t &quot;management&quot; - she was one of the  <br/>
managed. But she paid attention and thought about how they handled  <br/>
things and people - what was well done, what could have been better,  <br/>
how it could have been better (or worse).  Having had that experience  <br/>
certainly makes the classroom learning about management make a lot  <br/>
more sense.<br/>
<br/>
Working at 14 is awesome - I think it is really one of the best  <br/>
things a 14 yo can do, if he&#39;s interested. Help him find work that  <br/>
interests him. My 14 year old works (unpaid) at the library. She&#39;s  <br/>
been working there every week for almost 2 years. Again, I could  <br/>
probably write for hours about all that she&#39;s learned by working.  <br/>
(She&#39;s not paid - but has regular scheduled work hours and a boss   <br/>
and a job description - just like any other employee. I&#39;m hoping that  <br/>
they&#39;ll decide to start paying her, eventually.)<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to worry about a transcript?<br/>
<br/>
If so - you really really should consider getting Wes Beach&#39;s book  <br/>
which has a lot about making transcripts based on all kinds of varied  <br/>
experiences - a bit is California specific, but not the transcript  <br/>
parts:<br/>
<br/>
Opportunities After &quot;High School&quot;: Thoughts, Documents, Resources, by  <br/>
Wes Beach. Includes a number of transcripts Beach has written for his  <br/>
students; these transcripts can be used as models for homeschool  <br/>
transcripts. Also discusses community college enrollment; preparing  <br/>
for, choosing, and applying to four-year colleges; and opportunities  <br/>
other than formal academic study. A number of resource books are  <br/>
described. Available from HSC: $10 to HSC Book Order, 5520 Old San  <br/>

I wouldn&#39;t incorporate a job into is learning experience.  Just let <br/>
him get a job and have it be what it is, a JOB.  You can put a job on <br/>
resumes.  Resumes hold more weight than a school transcript.  School <br/>
transcripts only hold weight in schools.  One generally goes to school <br/>
to learn so they can get a good job.  Once out of school no one ever <br/>
asks to see your school transcripts once you are out of school, people <br/>
want to see what jobs you have done and what kind of experience you <br/>
have, and that you have gone to school or that you have some general <br/>
knowledge of the type of job you are applying to.<br/>
