I&#39;ve been wondering about this myself.  Why do these unschooling ideas come<br/>
easier to some than others.  To me, the more I read, the more it all made<br/>
sense and it just permiated into my life.   It wasn&#39;t that someone was<br/>
telling me to do it,  it just happened.   I guess I wonder sometimes why<br/>
some people just don&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe its our past experiences,  our personalities,   I don&#39;t know.    I<br/>
guess, I&#39;m thinking outloud this morning.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just want everyone to see the unschooling light!  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

So far my theory (not conviction) is that it requires flexibility and <br/>
intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are missing one or both.<br/>
<br/>
(Okay, MOST people are missing one, and some people are missing both.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I understand people not getting unschooling or even wanting to take a <br/>
glimpse at it.<br/>
There is such a variety of people in this world, and it fascinates me.<br/>
I had a couple of Jehova&#39;s Witnesses come to my door the other day.<br/>
That in itself, reminds me of the spectrum of thought that can occur <br/>
in humans.  But it happens even in smaller, everyday ways, all of the <br/>
time.  I liked the spread your seeds, but tend your own garden <br/>
analogy.  (was that on this list?) <br/>
Anyway, I try not to feel that I am doing something that everyone <br/>
should be doing because it is so obviously right.  <br/>
That&#39;s how some of my Christian friends come across about their <br/>
religious beliefs.  They are so happy and peaceful with the lives <br/>
they are living &quot;thanks to the Lord&quot;, and I am obviously missing out <br/>
on what is real in this life.  <br/>
I can appreciate their feelings, and also be reminded of the many <br/>
different minds and souls and the many different paths we can focus <br/>
on.  <br/>
