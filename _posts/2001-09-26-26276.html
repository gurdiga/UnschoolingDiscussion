<div id="ygrps-yiv-233459205">me about the new list for our children, so I thought I would just send this <br/>
to the lists as well so that you all know a bit more about me if you were <br/>
not around for my intro or forgot who I was &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would much rather parents be concerned as I would be too!<br/>
<br/>
I personally will be monitoring it. I am a Program director for Cub Scouts <br/>
(150 boys in my care...ACK!), am becoming a 4H leader, run an animal <br/>
shelter, have been a foster mom and many other things...<br/>
<br/>
There will be NO cussing at all allowed. That is grounds for immediate <br/>
removal as is porno or anything like that!<br/>
<br/>
The idea formed in my head about 2 months ago but summer was here and it <br/>
got put on the back burner...then, this week, my son went to a chat and was <br/>
afraid to post as they move too fast for him and he cannot spell for beans! <br/>
I wanted a safe place for him to make his own online friends, like I have.<br/>
<br/>
Now that he is home with me all the time, he does not have friends in <br/>
school to talk to so I wanted a place where he could talk to kids around <br/>
his age, where there was some control but was also a place for him to learn <br/>
spelling and relating in another format.<br/>
<br/>
Parents are allowed to monitor...there is web access for reading the mail <br/>
so in effect, all of us can monitor it. I have it set so the web only is <br/>
for members...I think...will look into that now, so you may want to join so <br/>
that you can see what is going on...<br/>
<br/>
Any other questions, you are more than welcome to ask!<br/>
