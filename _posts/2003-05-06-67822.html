<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070314423">I wrote this for my other list, and never sent it. Since someone brought up <br/>
interfering family and there was concern about slacking on posts, I&#39;ll go <br/>
ahead and share it. <br/>
<br/>
I wrote this because my public schooling brother and his wife had subscribed <br/>
to my Ohio unschooling email list. The wife introduced herself, asked some <br/>
questions, was very honest that she was happy with her school situation, but <br/>
could see it changing for the worse. Wanted to see what it was all about. She <br/>
was greeted with open arms. I didn&#39;t tell anyone she was my SIL, I didn&#39;t <br/>
want to make her uncomfortable. <br/>
<br/>
A small span of time went by and my brother came on and attacked one of the <br/>
posters, making rude remarks that I knew were directed at me, but told the <br/>
poster he only wanted her to respond. I was so upset, I felt so awful that he <br/>
did that. I was up at 4am typing the email that follows, and trying to come <br/>
up with some kind of apology to the poster, when my SIL got on and posted <br/>
that my brother didn&#39;t know she subscribed. He thought I was just sending <br/>
this stuff to him? Did he think I was trying to convert him? Who knows. <br/>
<br/>
SIL apologized for the disruption, but refused to apologize for his <br/>
statements because he had a right to them. It was a mess. I felt so betrayed, <br/>
and so mad that he would take it out on someone so nice. I know he probably <br/>
wanted a reaction from me, and I refused. I still think I need to take the <br/>
attacked poster out to dinner to make up for it somehow(are you reading this? <br/>
I&#39;m serious.) <br/>
<br/>
It all got resolved, an explanation went out and a warning that any other <br/>
disruptions would have them moderated or banned. <br/>
They never said a word to me in person. The next time I saw them was Easter <br/>
weekend at my house, a few days after the incident, and they pretended <br/>
nothing happened. It was bizarre. <br/>
<br/>
They are still subscribed. SIL did email me privately recently and ask to <br/>
borrow any of my John Taylor Gatto books, so I am still hoping that something <br/>
good will come of the whole ordeal. But the trust is not wholly there. <br/>
<br/>
Well, here was my vent that never got sent, I hope this isn&#39;t inappropriate <br/>
or bringing up bad feelings to anyone on the other list. It was my way of <br/>
addressing the issue and explaining to the list that they were related to me, <br/>
without personally responding to the mean post. After she <br/>
apologized/explained, I thought this was a little off the mark, but then <br/>
again...... <br/>
<br/>
Maybe sharing it here can help me better learn how to deal with family <br/>
members that pull these type of self-righteous stunts. I have a doozie of an <br/>
unsupportive family member, that showed himself a jerk more than I could have <br/>
ever complained about him. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Subject: The Worst<br/>
<br/>
What is the worst thing a non-unschooling-supportive relative of yours has <br/>
done?<br/>
<br/>
Mine would have to be the time my brother subscribed to an email list that I <br/>
started for supporting fellow unschoolers and just as I was watching it grow <br/>
into a safe, comfortable place to be ourselves, but still take the time out <br/>
to kindly explain to those wanting to know what it is about, charged in with <br/>
a personal agenda to disrupt and inflame the participants. I can&#39;t really <br/>
understand why he would do something so mean-spirited, other than for sheer <br/>
entertainment. <br/>
<br/>
I mean, no one has ever told him that his choice to school his kids was wrong <br/>
or not to be respected, if so, I would think he dealt with it maturely <br/>
instead of attacking unsuspecting people about the way they live their lives <br/>
in a place that encourages them to. <br/>
<br/>
This would be by far the most shocking, damaging, and hurtful thing anyone <br/>
has ever done to me personally because they disagreed with my parenting <br/>
style. A parenting style that I celebrate and love to share about, but have <br/>
never insisted be the only way or better than someone else&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
To sit back with a closed mind and wait for one remark to jump in on and spew <br/>
forth a diatribe insulting a whole group of people, while singling out one he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know. A group of people who signed up for a list that specifically <br/>
stated for support, and disruptions wouldn&#39;t be tolerated.  I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
what good that would do for anyone, especially his sister who wants nothing <br/>
but the best for him and his family, regardless of the life they choose to <br/>
lead. <br/>
<br/>
Yep, that is by far the worst.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else here want to share their worst experience with a family <br/>
member against homeschooling? Or how you deal with such things? Are you <br/>
gracious, and try not to sink to the level of attack, or just let them have <br/>
it? Do you wait for results to speak for themselves, or secretly make a <br/>
dartboard out of their picture?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing that with us... I am sorry they did that to you. I think <br/>
it was a really low thing for them to do.  I am very new to this list and <br/>
have not even brought my kids home yet (they will not be returning after the <br/>
end of the school year).  I have learned so much from you ladies in this <br/>
short period of time.  I joined just to see what I could learn about <br/>
different styles of homeschooling and the longer I stick around, I think that <br/>
unschooling may be just what our family needs! <br/>
I hate to hear stories of unsupportive relatives, friends, etc. but I am sure <br/>
hoping for some good ideas on how to deal with them since I can already tell <br/>
I will have to deal with my family and the inlaws... and who knows who <br/>
else!!! I am really grateful I found this list from the get go and look <br/>
forward to what I can learn from all of you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285329377">Hey Ang, thanks for sharing!!  <br/>
I am regularly amazed at where my critics hide, as well as where my fans hide <br/>
:)  My sister-in-law (same family, married to a different brother) refused to <br/>
breastfeed and had her boys circ&#39;d to separate herself from me (poor babies <br/>
... different soapbox, er, thread).  Suddenly, two years later, she confesses <br/>
she feels that what she does with her boys is *homeschooling* and I <br/>
completely agree and give her kudos (big change from the girl we met 6 years <br/>
ago who never wanted kids, let alone stay home to parent them!).  I begin to <br/>
explain unschooling philosophy and she&#39;s on board! She is really excited by <br/>
and for me!  On the other hand, her MIL, who was my biggest AP supporter, has <br/>
real issues with *teaching* or lack thereof...  I was ready for a fight with <br/>
my MIL, on our vacation to California in March, but her only issue with me <br/>
was my 4 year old son&#39;s longish hair.  At least she is far enough removed to <br/>
see that the *end* does justify the *means.*  <br/>
<br/>
I also find that my biggest critics (aside from those in the educational <br/>
field without children of their own) are those parents whose children would <br/>
be better off without being pigeonholed by the system.  Said parents tell me o<br/>
ne minute every little *fun* thing my kids are missing, and complaining the <br/>
next about all the horrible things the kids suffer thru to *earn* the fun ~ <br/>
NO thanks.  <br/>
<br/>
The only suffering my kids do is the suffering that comes with me being their <br/>
mom (hey, I&#39;m single and a bit *unbalanced* without my hubby, okay I confess, <br/>
I&#39;m a freak!) but the fun is ever-present, not earned!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-143114414">I think your ignoring him was the best thing.  It takes all the power <br/>
away.  Me and my mother have always had problems but this past <br/>
Christmas we had a blow out and we have not spoken since.  She sent <br/>
me an Easter cards for the kids addressed formally.  I ripped it up <br/>
because I knew there would be something nasty insede.  The second <br/>
side had a note to me.  I didn&#39;t see it but saw the first line was <br/>
the beginning of an attack.  The hardest thing was not to read it, <br/>
but in the long run it took her power to upset me away.  I have been <br/>
happier about my decision since.  So although it is off the topic, I <br/>
think it is wasy to get caught up in a &quot;game&quot; of some sorts.  Each <br/>
trying to have the last word, etc.  This ended it for me and weather <br/>
she thinks I read it or not does not matter.  <br/>
<br/>
I think if he shows anger about it and it will just be an arguement <br/>
do not let him upset you.  You keep your power all to yourself!  If <br/>
he sees it does not bother you, what will he get out of it!  Good <br/>
luck!<br/>

There are stories there about how to cope if your husband opposes<br/>
