<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855130399">**I was reading your post and wondered if the women in<br/>
the church removed the training pants as if it was<br/>
underwear?   LOL My girlfriend did it that way and it<br/>
smeared everywhere.  I had to explain to her that your<br/>
supose to rip them on the side like you would diapers!**<br/>
<br/>
We used *real* training pants - like thick cotton underwear. You sure as heck <br/>
don&#39;t go ripping those down the sides!   :-)<br/>
<br/>
The disposable &quot;training pants&quot; are just diapers in disguise. What&#39;s the <br/>
point of them, anyway? No kid I know would mistake them for real underwear.<br/>

The point is that they can pull them down, pee, and put them back on, which <br/>
they can&#39;t do with diapers with tape.<br/>
<br/>
At that point when the kids usually or sometimes can get to the potty on <br/>
their own, they&#39;re disposables which can be operated by kids.<br/>
