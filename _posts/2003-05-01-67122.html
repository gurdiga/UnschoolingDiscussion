<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116554523">This group permeates every other online community I frequent. I see so many <br/>
non-homeschooling parents with such opposite views on some things, and they <br/>
all see loving and caring and level-headed, but so wrong compared to the <br/>
experience I have here. <br/>
<br/>
They were discussing whether children should be forced to go to a disliked <br/>
grandmother&#39;s funeral, just to show respect and honor their dad. I said it <br/>
should be their choice. They were talking about bicycle helmets and whether <br/>
they should be enforced. I don&#39;t enforce them, but now i wonder if I should. <br/>
I think it&#39;s foolish to ride a motorcycle without one, so why shouldn&#39;t I <br/>
insist my children wear one. There were of course personal tales of biking <br/>
tragedies of helmetless riders. It got me thinking, I make my children wear <br/>
seatbelts for their safety, or ride in carseats, so what is different about <br/>
helmets and what would unschoolers do? <br/>
<br/>
WWUD? LOL <br/>
<br/>
I thought we had talked about helmets here before, and why some here don&#39;t <br/>
enforce them. But do they enforce seatbelts and carseats? Where do you draw <br/>
the line?<br/>
<br/>
My biggest WWUD issue is about my daughter cleaning her room. I am *really* <br/>
trying to let it go. I *hate* when she leaves her room trashed for a long <br/>
time, and have tried saying if you want to do this, your room better be <br/>
clean. Instead of just making her go in and do it. At one point she lied <br/>
about her room being clean when asked(a red flag, which made me consider <br/>
whether it wasn&#39;t another form of my asserting my needs on her and <br/>
threatening her for my own comfort) because she wanted to do something else <br/>
instead. <br/>
<br/>
So I told her that from now on, I won&#39;t nag her at all. I had stopped nagging <br/>
a bit, without telling her why, and she would take care of it more on her <br/>
own, but if it got to a certain point the battle would begin. <br/>
<br/>
This time I told her I am not going to engage in it anymore. So of course she <br/>
let her room get totally trashed. I started getting impatient waiting for her <br/>
to take responsibility. I told her to keep the door shut, and she is so <br/>
forgetful, she doesn&#39;t. The younger brother and sister get in there, and i <br/>
have to go and retrieve bath towels before they get ruined with mildew, and <br/>
one of my antique-ish books got ruined, and I got upset and went back on my <br/>
word. I bitched her out and demanded she clean it. Over a book and towels <br/>
that really shouldn&#39;t matter. UGH! <br/>
<br/>
Her dad stepped in (to referee between our two bullheaded personalities) and <br/>
threatened to spank her if it wasn&#39;t done by a certain time.....oh no......we <br/>
had said no more spanking a few weeks ago.....<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say anything, I should have. I wasn&#39;t going to let him spank her, <br/>
but I shouldn&#39;t even let that threat weigh on her. I think I have a bruise <br/>
from smacking my forehead. <br/>
<br/>
So again, if you have even read this ridiculously long post, I am looking for <br/>
WWUD concerning keeping kids bedrooms clean. <br/>
<br/>
I am really dumb, because she was telling me(before the blowup) how great it <br/>
was that it was her room, and she didn&#39;t like the pressure of keeping it <br/>
spotless, and she liked it a little messy. And that she loved it being her <br/>
choice and responsibility. I didn&#39;t want spotless, I can live a bit of mess. <br/>
<br/>
This got way out of control, and I reacted. I didn&#39;t trust. I didn&#39;t let her <br/>
de-roomclean long enough. I know she eventually would have cleaned it up <br/>
herself. She did, but only after her dad threatened. And she did a great job, <br/>
and was proud, so the end result was seemingly good. At what cost? I have let <br/>
whole days go while she moped in her room, waiting for her to just do it. <br/>
What a waste, I know that doesn&#39;t work.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should offer to help? A lot of times in the past she would just cry <br/>
and say she can&#39;t, and she needed help. She is used to me saying no. And I <br/>
have helped before, but then i take over and organize things to my liking, <br/>
and she doesn&#39;t want that either. <br/>
<br/>
Middle ground, oh middle ground, where are you middle ground?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be dependant on the opinions of unschoolers for every <br/>
parenting concern, but some insight would be appreciated, until I can start <br/>
doing things that work like I was born with the knowledge, without  second <br/>
guessing and re-living past mistakes. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032271782">Hi Ang<br/>
<br/>
I have several thoughts on this post.<br/>
<br/>
1) bicycle helmets. You heard horror stories about accidents without <br/>
them? I have a &quot;near-horror story&quot; about an accident wherein a helmet <br/>
saved my 10 yo boy&#39;s life. If he had not had a helmet on his head <br/>
when he went off the road and out of control down a trackless <br/>
hillside, when he impacted the tree, we could have been making <br/>
decisions about organ donation, instead of taking him to Immediate <br/>
Care and having him bandaged and x-rayed. I INSIST on them, though no <br/>
one else out here in our rural area has them. But...no one out here <br/>
wears seatbelts either. we do. This is one hill I am more than <br/>
willing to battle over.<br/>
<br/>
2) cleaning their rooms. We have family chores, and one of the kids&#39; <br/>
daily chores is make your beds, pick up dirty clothes from the floor, <br/>
toss accumulated trash in your room. So, I can&#39;t say they&#39;ve ever <br/>
gotten really bad, though there&#39;s always a bit of clutter. When <br/>
Katie&#39;s room gets really bad (Robby&#39;s never does) I go in and sit on <br/>
the bed and say &quot;that goes there&quot; &quot;put that in the garbage&quot; &quot;put that <br/>
in the dirty clothes pile by the door&quot; etc. She&#39;s getting to where <br/>
she knows a bit about organizing &quot;a clean up&quot; and she doesn&#39;t balk <br/>
even a littel bit about doing it, if I&#39;m in there with her. It&#39;s when <br/>
I say &quot;Go clean your room!&quot; and not go in to talk to her, that she <br/>
puts up a fuss.<br/>
<br/>
If we ever take the step of not making them clean their rooms as a <br/>
daily thing, and their rooms get trashed :&#92; I would say &quot;Keep it how <br/>
you want it, but don&#39;t take anything that belongs to me or other <br/>
family members, (book) or that belongs to the household (towel) in <br/>
there.&quot; If she likes her room messy, that&#39;s okay, but when her messy <br/>
infringes on other people&#39;s property, in our home, it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
okay. Oh, laundry. Does your daughter manage to get her dirty clothes <br/>
to the laundry room? That&#39;d be another thing: keep your room how you <br/>
want, but I&#39;m not going in, so if you want clean clothes, get them to <br/>
the laundry room or let me know you&#39;re doing a load and I&#39;ll get my <br/>
laundry out of the way.<br/>
<br/>
3) second-guessing! L I am absorbing this board and many articles, so <br/>
I can get over the second-guessing stage, myself. <br/>
<br/>
peace, HeidiC<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; WWUD concerning keeping kids bedrooms clean.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ang<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I  find this a difficult area too. We have to keep the floor areas in our<br/>
house relatively clean and clear as at certain times of the year we face the<br/>
possibility of dugite hatchlings (venomous snakes) coming into the house.<br/>
Not pleasant! They are  so hard to see even when the floor is debris free.<br/>
<br/>
I still lose my temper far too frequently but things are getting better. I<br/>
find what works best is getting in there with them and helping them. I think<br/>
you need to choose the time carefully too. I try to mention it the night<br/>
before and then wait for a time when they seem to be at a loose end.<br/>
<br/>
 One thing that works everytime is putting a cake/muffins in the oven,<br/>
putting the kettle on and suggesting we clean up a bit before  morning tea!<br/>
<br/>
We sat down and talked about the concerns I had awhile ago ie, snakes, a big<br/>
spider that I nearly picked up when I was cleaning, fire hazards and also<br/>
how much dad hates treading on Lego in the middle of the night! Things have<br/>
been a bit better since then, I guess they can see where I am coming from.<br/>
<br/>
 And I am trying to be more patient. What looks like a huge mess to me can<br/>
actually be an important part of their game.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reminding myself every day that life is messy. I should say that Miss<br/>
Frizzle reminds me everyday, as the kids are still enthralled with the Magic<br/>
School Bus series so it&#39;s what I wake up to every morning!<br/>
<br/>
Probably haven&#39;t helped but I am thinking of you1<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555546068">I agree with Kelly&#39;s post (below).  You might want to have a few specific rules - ie no food or drink containers in her room, no wet towels, respect other people&#39;s things, and (because of the younger ones) leave the door shut.  <br/>
<br/>
Other than that let her leave it a mess until she feels like cleaning up.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do wear helmets and so do the kids. It&#39;s the law here, same as seatbelts<br/>
and carseats. But we would do it anyways. We ride our bikes a lot for<br/>
transportation, so we&#39;re in bike lanes right next to car traffic. We ride<br/>
almost every day. If it was just the kids riding around the cul-de-sac or<br/>
park it might be different. DH and I both bike and both wear helmets, the<br/>
kids come to our triathlons and see all the riders wearing helmets, I<br/>
explained *why* I choose to wear a helmet and they always have just done it.<br/>
They loved picking out their own helmets, and my daughter actually went<br/>
through a phase where she wore hers all the time. They see other people<br/>
riding without helmets and comment on it.<br/>
I dunno, it just makes sense to me to keep my head as safe as possible -<br/>
then again I got in a bad bike wreck last summer and was very glad to have<br/>
my helmet on since my head hit the pavement with a big thud. Helmets now are<br/>
so much more comfortable too. We made sure to get the kids the newer style<br/>
with plenty of ventilation and the soft harness that sits on your head. They<br/>
are *way* better than they were even a few years ago, and if the harness is<br/>
adjusted correctly they don&#39;t fall over your eyes and don&#39;t restrict<br/>
visibility at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My biggest WWUD issue is about my daughter cleaning her room.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, here&#39;s what we do. The kids don&#39;t have to clean up their room,<br/>
although I personally won&#39;t walk in there if I can&#39;t get across the floor<br/>
without stepping on something. So they clean enough to at least leave a path<br/>
to their beds, LOL. But I would draw the line at clothes or towels or books<br/>
getting ruined in there. Sometimes if it makes me crazy enough, I&#39;ll go in<br/>
and help them clean and re-organize stuff. I bought them bins to keep stuff<br/>
organized, ha ha. If they are constantly missing toys and asking me to come<br/>
help them find them, I&#39;ll remind them that the purpose of the bins was to<br/>
help them not lose things. Like if the little horses go back into their bin<br/>
at the end of the day, my daughter won&#39;t have to run around the whole house<br/>
in a panic trying to find the one she wants to play with. My son is starting<br/>
to get this. He&#39;s lost the parts to some of his Bionicles despite having a<br/>
bin with a lid to keep them in. So he&#39;s paying a lot more attention to that<br/>
now as he likes to be able to rebuild them sometimes after using the pieces<br/>
in something else. He keeps all the instruction sheets in one place now too!<br/>
<br/>
Also, when we have friends over to play, before they go we usually ask<br/>
everyone to do a &quot;Five minute Room Rescue&quot; (thank you Flylady!). Like<br/>
yesterday, the kids had the living room completely covered in stuff, you<br/>
couldn&#39;t see an inch of floor! so they all pitched in and cleaned up that<br/>
one room before they left. I love a lot of Flylady&#39;s techniques, like the<br/>
room rescue. They work well for kids too because they know it&#39;s only for a<br/>
few minutes, we set the timer and it&#39;s like a race to see what we can get<br/>
done. If we all pitch in, then a room can be pretty reasonable in five<br/>
minutes or less. We also do the &quot;28 fling boogie&quot; and the kids like that<br/>
one. It&#39;s almost like a treasure hunt to see if we can find 28 things that<br/>
need throwing away.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I tell Jackson that if he can&#39;t hit the laundry basket that is sitting <br/>
right <br/>
beside his closet door then it doesn&#39;t get washed by me.  I won&#39;t pick up his <br/>
things off the floor.  It works here.  I am more than happy to wash his <br/>
clothes with mine if they are in the basket. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll pick up my husband&#39;s clothes and he&#39;ll pick mine up.  We throw them <br/>
toward the basket, but some miss.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could just say when it&#39;s nearly time &quot;Could you take the laundry <br/>
basket to the machine, please?&quot;  and then he&#39;ll pick up what&#39;s not in the <br/>
basket.  Unless you have had a rule about not picking up what&#39;s in the basket.<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;rules&quot; about clothes involve the knowledge that people have favorites and <br/>
it&#39;s good to make them available without too much wait, and that leaving <br/>
clothes dirty doesn&#39;t make them last as long as getting them clean.<br/>
<br/>
Do clothes exist for the purpose of controlling or training other people?  <br/>
Are they exercises in rules-following?  Are they tools in the struggle for <br/>
supremacy?<br/>
<br/>
No, they&#39;re clothes.  They cost money, people need to wear them, and picking <br/>
them up is less work than trying to figure out how to make others pick them <br/>
up, and then trying to figure out how to retore the loving and trusting <br/>
relationship which clothes wars might have damaged.<br/>
<br/>
When a husband dies, how many wives would LOVE to have the opportunity to <br/>
pick up his dirty clothes, and maybe smell them, even?  <br/>
<br/>
Being cold and rules-bound isn&#39;t a step on the path to close and loving <br/>
relationships.<br/>

children.  I have a son that died.  In this life there is nothing that I <br/>
personally can do for him any longer.  The small things that I do for my <br/>
children reflect that while we have them with us, why not?<br/>
<br/>
Your entire perspective on life changes when a child dies.  It&#39;s not the way <br/>
it&#39;s supposed to be, children bury their parents, not the other way around, <br/>
it changes one, you can be bitter and cold because something so horrible <br/>
happened (and I was for a while) or you can figure out a way to live <br/>
differently and better and more loving and more kind to those you might not <br/>
see in this life tomorrow.<br/>

time* and to ditch our kids on a regular basis ... we always felt we would <br/>
have plenty of *couple time* when our children were gone from our nest.  <br/>
Though I&#39;m saddened by loosing him, I don&#39;t regret ~ for one moment ~ the <br/>
time we spent together as a family.  My children are richer for us having <br/>
focused on them.  <br/>
<br/>
That said, as a single mom, it&#39;s a tougher juggling act to meet the needs of <br/>
my little ones and search for ways to ensure MY needs are being met.  Two <br/>
years now, and I&#39;m just beginning to be VERY vocal about my needs, i.e. <br/>
needing someone to take my kids shopping for mother&#39;s day and my birthday [NO <br/>
ONE volunteered to take my kids Christmas shopping to get a gift for me].  <br/>
<br/>
Luckily, the discussion of your post has opened my eyes to how incredibly <br/>
rich my life is ~ I do pursue my own interests, they are merely adapted to be <br/>
family-friendly or they&#39;re not high on my priority list.  If I do want to do <br/>
something on my own, it has to be incredibly inticing to warrant the expense <br/>
of a sitter :)  <br/>

the floor with the dirty ones. Also fine with me. I am simply not going to go <br/>
through the clothes to find the dirty ones.  Like the poster that said that <br/>
the wet towels were in the messy room.  If he wants to keep his clothes that <br/>
way it is fine with me, I am just not going to go get into his clothes.  And <br/>
that is fine with him.  Every other week or so he goes sniffing around to <br/>
find the dirty ones and they make it to the basket and they get washed.  <br/>
<br/>
I do pick up my boys clothes.  Although they are pretty good about getting <br/>
them in the basket.  And I do remind them that it is easier for me if the <br/>
clothes are put in the basket and not hid behind a chair somewhere.  <br/>

chooses to pile all his clothes up together and that is fine. I don&#39;t tell <br/>
him how to keep his things.  I can&#39;t control him or the choices he makes.  He <br/>
could do his own clothes.  When he gets a pile put them in the laundry.  But <br/>
he doesn&#39;t and doesn&#39;t want to.  I have never seen the man do laundry.  It <br/>
isn&#39;t a rule it is a choice.  If he did the laundry I wouldn&#39;t expect him to <br/>
go into my closet or near my closet and try to decipher what is clean and <br/>
what needs washing.  I have gardening clothes that get worn a couple of times <br/>
before I wash them.  Wouldn&#39;t expect him to try to figure that out.  And if <br/>
he ever said could you wash these pants or this shirt for me I would gladly <br/>
do it.  Anyway enough about our laundry.  LOL<br/>

laundry baskets. I color coordinate my laundry when I wash. Different<br/>
baskets help. It&#39;s a running joke, that no matter where in the room I place<br/>
the baskets, my husband just can&#39;t get the clothes all the way inside!! I<br/>
mean they are open laundry baskets and about 6 feet away from his side of<br/>
the bed. I still find clothes hanging over the side and sometimes just right<br/>
beside but not in the basket. Mind you this is a former sports playing guy<br/>
here who can shoot baskets!!!! I tell him if I placed the basket next to his<br/>
bed so he would have to step in it he still wouldn&#39;t have the clothes<br/>
inside. He also can&#39;t seem to figure out which basket has what color clothes<br/>
in it. I still find a red shirt right on top of the black clothes. And he&#39;s<br/>
not color blind. It&#39;s a long standing joke with us all now. Not upsetting,<br/>

time than just grabbing the basket.  And as such, it might not get done.<br/>
Heck, it CAN&#39;T get done unless I empty what IS in the basket.  It might get<br/>
done, if it&#39;s a slow day and I get a bug to do laundry (yeah, that&#39;ll<br/>

hoping maybe we could swap. I don&#39;t mind laundry but I hate when the beds<br/>
are calling to be redone!<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;My &quot;rules&quot; about clothes involve the knowledge that people have favorites and <br/>
it&#39;s good to make them available without too much wait, and that leaving <br/>
clothes dirty doesn&#39;t make them last as long as getting them clean.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our only &quot;rule&quot; about clothes is that we ask Jaiden to not leave his dirty underware on the livingroom floor. If he forgets one of us (Jason or me) will toss them in the basket, and ask him to try to remember next time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the deal I&#39;ve made with my kids. They keep their rooms the way <br/>
they like them. If it gets too uncomfortably messy *for me* I go in <br/>
and clean it. I don&#39;t mind. It usually just takes a short time to get <br/>
things back to an acceptable level of clutter. They don&#39;t mind, <br/>
they&#39;re usually happy to have it picked up. Lots of times they help <br/>
me. I&#39;m respectful of their things and don&#39;t remove or reorganize <br/>
without permission. <br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is that since I&#39;m not always on them about cleaning <br/>
up, they come through when I really *need* their help. Our house is <br/>
on the market right now and that means a level of clean that we don&#39;t <br/>
usually maintain every day. &lt;g&gt; The kids are being great at speed <br/>
cleaning before a showing and keeping their space relatively picked <br/>
up on a daily basis. There&#39;s a reason I&#39;m asking for a particular <br/>
level of clean. They understand it and are fine with pitching to help <br/>
the family reach our goal.<br/>
