<div id="ygrps-yiv-298685752">I must be missing something. I don&#39;t understand why people are getting all <br/>
ruffled about the debates. It&#39;s like watching a heated talk show and then <br/>
complaining that it&#39;s on tv, yet tuning in daily. If I don&#39;t want to see it, <br/>
I turn it off. And as far as someone running a point into the ground, if I <br/>
feel strongly on a certain point I may do that myself. If I feel strongly <br/>
about something, and I&#39;m in a free forum for exchanging viewpoints, I&#39;ll go <br/>
on for as long as people wili listen. I mean if anyone hear had the open ear <br/>
of a structured homeschooler wouldn&#39;t they get in as many points as they were <br/>
allowed? I don&#39;t understand why some people want to stop certain topics and <br/>
debates. If you don&#39;t want in them, don&#39;t read them. But the people debating <br/>
obviously have something to iron out, I say leave them to it. When they&#39;re <br/>
all done, they&#39;ll quit. If you&#39;re fed up with the debate, drop out and don&#39;t <br/>
read them. It almost seems borderline censorship to me, saying what can and <br/>
can&#39;t be talked about. Just my opinion.<br/>
