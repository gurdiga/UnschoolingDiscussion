<div id="ygrps-yiv-623310636">One other idea I took from the Bailey book was this...<br/>
When one child hurts another (or takes something) and they do not <br/>
resolve it on their own, ask the one who is upset &quot;Did you like <br/>
that?&quot;. This allows them to focus on themselves and how thay are <br/>
feeling. When they say &quot;no&quot;, listen to the strength of their voice <br/>
and use this information to help them tell the other kid what they <br/>
feel/what they want. If the response is loud and forceful, they are <br/>
probably fine going over there and telling the other child on their <br/>
own. If they sound timid, you can offer to go along or do it for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Example from our household. <br/>
One takes something from the other, let&#39;s say Jacob does the taking.<br/>
I will say &quot;Emma, did you like that?&quot;<br/>
&quot;No&quot;<br/>
&quot;Tell Jacob &quot;I&#39;m not ready, I&#39;m taking my turn&quot;&quot;<br/>
(Which she generally does with glee. Sometimes she will ask me to <br/>
tell him, which I do)<br/>
<br/>
I will generally add &quot;Jacob when she is done, she will let you know&quot;<br/>
&quot;Emma, please let Jacob know when you are done&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hitting examples, assuming Emma is the one hitting.<br/>
After the &quot;No&quot;<br/>
Tell her...<br/>
&quot;That hurts, Emma. I&#39;m not for hitting.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Gentle please. That&#39;s too rough.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t like that. Stop!&quot;<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
After about 2 weeks of &quot;feeding them words&quot; and encouraging them to <br/>
be bold and tell the other child what they want, they are beginning <br/>
to do it by themselves more and more (and I am getting the luxury of <br/>
being kept out of their fights)<br/>
<br/>
I think it has given them more power to hear the words come out of <br/>
their own mouths. It is also helping them play more easily with <br/>
other kids in group situations.<br/>
<br/>
It is working for us.<br/>
Maybe it isn&#39;t ideal for other families, but I am impressed at how <br/>
much Emma can work out fights on her own (and stand up for herself). <br/>
She turned 2 in June.<br/>
<br/>
That will conclude my Bailey thoughts too...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s developing language skills - that&#39;s great. There are other  <br/>
books, too, that help parents help their kids develop vocabulary for  <br/>
feelings and needs. &quot;I Can Problem Solve,&quot; by Myrna Shure is useful  <br/>
for this purpose, too.<br/>
<br/>
For parents who don&#39;t do this easily and naturally, because of their  <br/>
own limits when it comes to vocabulary for feelings, these books can  <br/>
really help. But, be careful of thinking of them as a recipe - don&#39;t  <br/>
get too attached to the particulars. What you really want is to be  <br/>
authentic - and people can get so devoted to the approach of  <br/>
particular books that they lose authenticity.<br/>
