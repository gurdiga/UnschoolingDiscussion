<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156029409">Hi everyone, I am new to the groups! My name is Candita (Candy) Oliver, my husband is Justin, and we have a daughter Courtney, she just turned 4 in November! I figured we would weigh in on the bed time issue. :o) Courtney has pretty much always gone to sleep on her own schedule. She also still sleeps with us. I know very much what it is like! Courtney is an extreme night owl and does not go to sleep until sometime around 1:00am. She also prefers to sleep in till sometime around 10:30 - 11:00 am. I use that time in the morning for my &quot;me time&quot; Take a bath, read, ect. It has worked out pretty well for us, and with the whole &quot;Family bed&quot;, it does make you think about things in a whole different light, but it has been very positive for us. I could see how it would be hard if you were used to your child having a set bed time, and then changing that, but once you get into the swing of things, and see where you new extra time lays, you might just enjoy it! I like having my time in the morning to wake up and get going! By the time she wakes up, I can devote some time with just me and her, and I feel great!<br/>

  &gt;After giving my children the freedom to decide their own bedtime a few <br/>
  &gt;days ago, I am beginning to miss my few hours of quiet time.  This is very <br/>
  &gt;hard.  How does everyone else get a moments piece?<br/>
<br/>
  I fought my son&#39;s wanting to stay up later than me when he hit his <br/>
  teens.  I finally gave up and started going to bed earlier and getting up <br/>
  earlier.  The bonus is that my writing goes better because I&#39;m fresh.<br/>
