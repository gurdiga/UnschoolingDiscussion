<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669870827">Actually, the study was conducted at various universities and VA hospitals<br/>
around the country (U of Houston being one) but was centered at Yale.<br/>
<br/>
The primary investigator in Houston was Carlo DiClemente who was interested<br/>
in stages of change.  The study took people coming out of inpatient<br/>
treatment for alcohol addictions and looked at how successful they were for<br/>
staying sober.  People were either sent to 12 step programs and had that<br/>
reinforced by weekly visits with 12 step counselors....or were simply given<br/>
results of medical tests indicating what alcohol was/is doing to their<br/>
bodies at weekly visits with medical counselors....or had individual<br/>
cognitive behavioral therapy sessions on a weekly basis.<br/>
<br/>
What was discovered is that it didn&#39;t matter what aftercare treatment the<br/>
person had (12 step, medical or therapy) or the severity of the alcohol<br/>
addiction, the success rate was about the same across those variables.  What<br/>
mattered was where the person was in their process of change.<br/>
<br/>
The process of change consisted of several stages starting with<br/>
contemplation, moving through investigating options, and ending with taking<br/>
steps to make change.  It was found that the source of change appears to be<br/>
internal rather than caused by outside forces, such as treatment.<br/>

&gt; There&#39;s a lesson in here somewhere. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I deleted too quickly and don&#39;t remember who mentioned it -- but &gt;<br/>
&gt; Seems like that study might be linked to this business of what motivates<br/>
&gt; people to be early or late -- maybe.<br/>

&gt; It was the appalling idea of letting down the entire school if I was not<br/>
&gt; there. The &quot;insurmountable misadventures&quot; (fantastic phrase!) just<br/>
&gt; evaporated. I actually became so anxious to be on time, that I was<br/>
generally<br/>
&gt; extra early. I guess there had never been a reason I cared about to just<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; on time to deadly dull but compulsory assembly each day.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;That&#39;s interesting. So what was it in the new arrangement that got you<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; on time? Suddenly you were able to plan ahead, or whatever was required,<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; overcome the previously insurmountable misadventures. How come?&gt;&gt;<br/>
