THE FLINT JOURNAL FIRST EDITION<br/>

JOURNAL COLUMNIST<br/>

<br/>
The public school system takes a lot of bashing at the hands of the media and <br/>
<br/>
politicians. Some of it&#39;s justified. Most of it&#39;s not. And having taught <br/>
there for almost 20 years, I&#39;m certainly aware of its strengths and <br/>
weaknesses. <br/>
   <br/>
     <br/>
But when it comes to a well-rounded education that prepares students for the <br/>
world of work and for functioning in a global society, the public school <br/>
system can&#39;t be beat. They take everyone. Blind, deaf, learning disabled, <br/>
mentally impaired or non-English speaking, public schools take them all and <br/>
provide the services they need. And in my experience, that&#39;s exactly what <br/>
some parents don&#39;t like about the public school system. <br/>
<br/>
Still, I believe that parents should have choices when it comes to educating <br/>
their children. Charter schools and parochial schools are great options. <br/>
<br/>
The educational choice that confounds me, though, is home schooling. Why <br/>
would parents choose to isolate their children from a rich and varied <br/>
learning environment? Why would parents choose to pull their children out of <br/>
the real world and shelter them from the very society that they will <br/>
ultimately have to live and work in? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s perplexing. <br/>
<br/>
In extenuating circumstances home schooling is the only viable alternative, <br/>
such as in the case of a long-term illness. I&#39;m not talking about those <br/>
situations. But many times in my career I observed parents choosing to home <br/>
school to keep their child away from a certain &quot;element&quot; in the public school <br/>
<br/>
system that they deemed to be unsavory, to isolate their kids in what seemed <br/>
to me to be an unhealthy way. <br/>
<br/>
School is more than just academics, and parents do kids a disservice when <br/>
they try to protect their kids from the real world. Wouldn&#39;t it be more <br/>
logical to teach them to function effectively in it? <br/>
<br/>
To me, the most compelling reason for sending a child to a public school is <br/>
because the public school environment reflects the real world: competition, <br/>
teamwork, cooperation and simply interacting with a wide variety of people <br/>
are part of the experience, as they are in society. <br/>
<br/>
The social setting in a school is ripe with learning experiences. People from <br/>
<br/>
all walks of life go to public schools: rich, poor, smart, dumb, bullies, <br/>
sissies, all cultures and ethnicities. And guess what? When kids grow up they <br/>
<br/>
are going to have to work with people from all walks of life: rich, poor, <br/>
smart, dumb, bullies, sissies, and all cultures and ethnicities. <br/>
<br/>
Even with the help of home schooling organizations, home-schooled children <br/>
are often shortchanged. The worst public school has more to offer in the way <br/>
of resources than most parents can offer at home, such as science labs, <br/>
technology, foreign language, theater, large and varied curriculums, <br/>
textbooks, a variety of multi-media lesson support, clubs and sports. <br/>
<br/>
The teaching staff in a public school can be colorful, too. A variety of <br/>
teaching and evaluation styles forces a student to grow as a learner. <br/>
Teachers are even trained to teach to multiple intelligences. How many <br/>
parents can say the same? <br/>
<br/>
Although I have a teaching certificate, I know that I couldn&#39;t come close to <br/>
giving my children the education they could get in a public school. I <br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly offer the depth and breadth of education that I know my <br/>
colleagues offer every day. <br/>
<br/>
Sure, I could go to the home-schooling store and buy a book on say, history, <br/>
and I could read the chapters and assign the accompanying assignments. I <br/>
could check the answers using the answer key. We could even take a trip to <br/>
Greenfield Village. But could I offer the same depth of understanding as <br/>
someone who chose to teach history because of a passion for it, someone who <br/>
is an expert in the field? <br/>
<br/>
Of course not. I would be a weak substitute, and I know it. <br/>
<br/>
Parents who home-school their children have their reasons, of course. But the <br/>
<br/>
effects of what these students are missing remain to be seen. <br/>
<br/>
All in all, a public education is the best deal around. It&#39;s a great training <br/>
<br/>
ground for the real world and, even better, it&#39;s free. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988524070">Did you read her column from the week before? Basically said that all the legislation to improve the schools was a waste of time, because the kids who fail in school are kids who are poor, or kids whose parents don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s behind anyway (or both). And the teachers don&#39;t need any outside experts because they already know everything.<br/>
<br/>
I sent her feedback, I couldn&#39;t help myself &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

Why is it that teachers say on the one hand that home influence is so profound, NOTHING a teacher can do will overcome it ... and then say on the other hand, that a parent can&#39;t possibly teach their own children anything?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085481518">Are they still coming OUT with this stuff? sheesh. You&#39;d think &quot;time <br/>
will tell&quot; would mean something. He sounds like he&#39;s basing his <br/>
opinions about homeschooling on the O&#39;Keefes or something. I&#39;d say my <br/>
kids are much better socialized, with less academic training, than <br/>
any of their gov&#39;t schooled friends. Oh, it&#39;s a she. Well, shame on <br/>
her, is right. Public school is an inhumane, machine-oriented system <br/>
that creates automans without the capacity to think for themselves, <br/>
beyond their next purchase, and even then, that purchase comes from <br/>
external suggestion, much more than need.<br/>
