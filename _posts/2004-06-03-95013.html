On a  general homeschooling list, then people will often think the <br/>
unschooler  response is just crazy - they don&#39;t want to just let <br/>
penmanship drop -  their question was how to teach it better - and &quot;just <br/>
don&#39;t do it&quot; not  only won&#39;t be an alternative for them, they&#39;ll <br/>
sometimes feel that their  choice TO do it is being attacked and, <br/>
without a lot more explanation of  unschooling, they&#39;ll very likely get <br/>
the impression that unschooling is  nothing more than neglecting a <br/>
child&#39;s  education.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
And I&#39;m afraid that that&#39;s what Helen&#39;s going to get with her new  <br/>
HOMEschooling lists. <br/>
That&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened on every local inclusive list I&#39;ve  been on.<br/>
Plainly, they don&#39;t want us there. Our answers are not what they want to  <br/>
hear. They want to know whether a different curriculum can make their children  <br/>
learn math (or reading or history or science) better. Or make it more fun.  Or <br/>
easier. Or without all the yelling and coersion that&#39;s happening in their  <br/>
households right now. They want to know what ideas others have for teaching  <br/>
handwriting skills or a foreign language or PE or calculus (CALCULUS!!!). <br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t HAVE to do that at all&quot; is NOT the advice they&#39;re looking for  <br/>
(although I&#39;ve given that several times until I just unsubbed! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
It&#39;s infuriating. And irritating. And not worth my time.<br/>

On *Prodigy, long ago, there were &quot;git gone&quot; battles between structured <br/>
Christian homeschoolers and the unschoolers and other &quot;heathens.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So when AOL opened up a homeschooling forum LOTS of people jumped there.  But <br/>
in no time, every discussion that was started by homeschoolers had some <br/>
missionary show up to say we were going to have bratty ignorant children, or trying <br/>
to sell us some math program.   <br/>
<br/>
So AOL made unschooling folders, that was GREAT!  And it was the best place <br/>
around for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
But the web because more easily useable by all kinds of people, and Home <br/>
Education Magazine opened unschooling.com (in large part to keep the unschooling <br/>
flamboyance and controversy out of the their main forum), and this list grew <br/>
out of that (and some other lists too).<br/>
<br/>
So compared to any time in the past, unschooling information is easy to come <br/>
by, and particular brainstorming help and ideas are readily available.<br/>
<br/>
We still have the problem of being divisive elements at general homeschooling <br/>
sites (or sometimes at in-person support groups even), but we DO have <br/>
all-unschooling options.  And more than one ! <br/>
<br/>
In 1992 and those ancient times, I used to wait two months for an issue of <br/>
Growing Without Schooling and read every single word, and the good parts twice, <br/>
and then know I was two months from another fix.<br/>

<br/>
My university professor just returned from Canada for a conference and said he saw a TV <br/>
program where the two invited guests were from opposing camps and they actually <br/>
*talked to each other* rather than shouting over each other.<br/>
<br/>
He said by the end, they each commented on better understanding the opponent even <br/>
while being polite and not giving up personal opinions.<br/>
<br/>
It was so remarkable to him that he told us shout-y Americans about it. :)<br/>

<br/>
(a little tongue in cheek)<br/>
<br/>
MAYBE, instead of saying &quot;I&#39;m a *respectful* parent&quot;<br/>
<br/>
which might sound like &quot;You are a *disrespectful meanie*&quot;,<br/>
<br/>
one could say &quot;I believe that my child can make good decisions, or can <br/>
learn to make good decisions.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And also &quot;I think that giving my child lots of information and the <br/>
freedom to make his own choices helps him become a better decision maker.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Of course, that&#39;s a lot more words to type than &quot;respectful&quot;.  But I <br/>
agree that not everyone understands what people on this list might mean <br/>
specifically by the phrase &quot;respectful parenting&quot;.  I think some people <br/>
just know that it&#39;s bad to be &quot;disrespectful&quot; so they don&#39;t like the <br/>
implication that they are disrespectful to their kids.)<br/>
<br/>
I think our culture is profoundly disrespectful of young people.  Maybe <br/>
talking about that can give some perspective and make the issue less <br/>
&quot;personal&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Many people take it for granted that it&#39;s right and proper to tell kids <br/>
what to do (all day long and again at bedtime)!   So many people don&#39;t <br/>
realize that that behavior is &quot;disrespectful&quot;.<br/>

PS  On the other hand, one could say &quot;I don&#39;t think television is <br/>
particularly harmful.&quot;    Or even, &quot;sugar won&#39;t kill you.&quot;</div>

<br/>
&quot;Disrespectful&quot;. I think it&#39;s a word that many adults would only use in<br/>
regard to children; &quot;you know those kids who answer back to adults with<br/>
smart alec remarks&quot;. So maybe it makes adults uncomfortable to be thought<br/>
disrespectful because it makes them feel childish or makes them feel that<br/>
others perceive them as childish and therefore foolish-another word used<br/>
often regarding  children. Blech!<br/>
<br/>
So maybe along with the seed of emotional courage, humility is needed to<br/>
make the change from traditional schooling/parenting to unschooling. To be<br/>
willing to be vulnerable (like a child) and perhaps feel a little foolish<br/>
or be shown what  looks like disrespect in order to grow and change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-891335158">&quot; It is not worth my time (as Kelly said) for people who are not<br/>
interested in unschooling, even though I sometimes feel impatient and<br/>
irritated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, same here.<br/>
LeaAnne and I have an email list for our support group. There&#39;s a Mom on there that is really into &quot;how to teach science&quot;. She&#39;s working on a book, has her own &quot;periodic table of elements for toddlers&quot; and a website. There has been a lot of interest in her stuff and a science company is going to produce some of it.<br/>
Today, she posted on of her famous science activities and said something about how acidity and alkalinity are &quot;abstract concepts so the younger you start showing them this concept, the better&quot;.<br/>
ARGH.<br/>
She and I had a good discussion about unschooling vs. school at home recently...I&#39;m just not wasting the energy to call her out on that comment, lame as it is.<br/>
Interestingly, she&#39;s staying overnight here next week. I can hang with a lot of different people...just don&#39;t get me started on an unschooling discussion!!:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  If it&#39;s about grades and curricullum than we unschoolers just shut up and let the others talk (after all, we wouldn&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about). Just as when it&#39;s about a specific unschooling issue they won&#39;t contribute. Discussions about differences in food and TV and such can encompass everyone and when that happens, it gets fun. Heated on occasion but rarely disrespectful. Again, if we can talk about gay marriage and we range from right wing Christians to left wing flakes, we can take on any issue. :) I enjoy that list because while you may not agree with the other poster who does not agree with no-limit TV, they will give you their reasons so you can understand and have some respect for how they came to that decision. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that hard...But I have posted on AOL boards where respectful discussion seemed like the most difficult thing in the world.<br/>
