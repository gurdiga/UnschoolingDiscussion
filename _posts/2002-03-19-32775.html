 </span></blockquote>Only to people who don&#39;t enjoy a good heated discussion ;-) If a word<br/>
conjures up one image for one person and another image to another and they<br/>
each assume they both have the same image and don&#39;t care about clarifying<br/>
then language loses a lot of it&#39;s usefulness. Unschooling doesn&#39;t even<br/>
conjure up the same image for each of us so unparenting is even iffier.<br/>
<br/>
Just as a test of current usage, I typed &quot;unparenting&quot; into Google. There<br/>
are 78 pages that turned up. Pretty amazing when most searches turn up at<br/>
least thousands and typically millions.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently it&#39;s a technical term foremost and uses up most of the 78 pages:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you tried just unparenting the belly from the hips (the old origin) and<br/>
&gt; then parenting the hips to the belly, making the belly bone effectively your<br/>
&gt; new root? I just did a quick test with a skinned object and seemed to work<br/>
&gt; ok. I could then independantly animate the front and rear quad, and control<br/>
&gt; the overall orientation of the setup from the new &#39;belly&#39; root.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may need to disable any IK handles though that may be along the spine<br/>
&gt; though and make sure your model is at the bind pose when you do it.<br/>

sure they&#39;re speaking English ;-)<br/>
<br/>

And used in programming:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; gtk/gtklist.c (gtk_list_clear_items): Clear<br/>
&gt; list-&gt;undo/list_focus_child after unparenting<br/>
&gt; child, since unparenting the child can result<br/>
&gt; in list-&gt;last_focus_child being set.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They both seem to suggest severing a dependent relationship.<br/>
<br/>
The first use of unparenting in a family context is from a page on a<br/>
homeschooling conference that&#39;s gone but tantalizingly said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ... children time and space to explore their interests. Why unschooling does<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mean unparenting. This workshop is primarily for people new to unschooling ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The next one is an essay from Unschooling.com :-) written by Nancy Wooton on<br/>
2/24/99. (Are you here Nancy?) She&#39;s a bit of a ringer (who came up<br/>
legitimately! :-) since she&#39;s an ex-AOLer who would have been used to seeing<br/>
unparenting used to mean not parenting.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling scares people, because there are no guarantees. What they fail to<br/>
&gt; realize is, public school, private school, or school-at-home offer no<br/>
&gt; guarantees, either. What unschooling is about is *freedom.* How it appears in<br/>
&gt; different homes is as individual as the child himself. It does not mean<br/>
&gt; &quot;unparenting,&quot; though a wide range of parenting philosophies are practiced<br/>
&gt; (most unschoolers are pretty relaxed, though, since you aren&#39;t trying to force<br/>
&gt; the kids to do things all day long). The basic tenet is not new age; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &quot;what is best for this individual person, my child?&quot; In some cases,<br/>
&gt; unschooling parents will find their child desires a structured curriculum, and<br/>
&gt; they provide it. The difference is in WHO is asking for the curriculum, and<br/>
&gt; who is responsible for doing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then, after many animation references, a frustratingly unlinked (or perhaps<br/>
unparented?) link to an essay entitled &quot;Unschooling or Unparenting?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And another missing page that starts: &quot;... My response to that is to remind<br/>
them that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean &quot;unparenting&quot;. My kids have plenty of<br/>
responsibilities and structure in their lives. It&#39;s ...&quot;<br/>

Finally an independent, relevent use which ironically ties into the feminism<br/>
discussion :-)<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In the end, the values of feminism and individualism are good.  The problem is<br/>
&gt; that our time-place has not yet developed the cultural responses to compensate<br/>
&gt; for the familial losses feminism has helped create.  We have yet to solve such<br/>
&gt; problems as homemakerless houses, unparenting parents, independencism, and<br/>
&gt; isolationism (oh yea, lots of us feel alone and depressed ­ where have our<br/>
&gt; grandparents gone?!).  I think it is the undervaluing of the family, and the<br/>
&gt; overvaluing of the individual, that produced this mess.  (We value the group<br/>
&gt; as a whole very much, btw).  We forget our place in life: our duty.  We are<br/>
&gt; not frogs; we are mammals:  we must raise our young with precious time and<br/>

&gt; than other homeschoolers - only internal not external.  We expect our kids to<br/>

This one struck me, although the computer animation was pretty funny. It seems *to me* that when being confronted about things - school, parenting, housework, etc sometimes we (as adults mostly) tend to say things such as the above because we don&#39;t want to be seen as &#39;failing&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
When faced with &quot;well you are unparenting, so therefore you sit on your butt and eat bon bons, or you are so lucky to be a stay at home mom and do &quot;nothing&quot; all day, or any of the various other annoying things someone may say, people may (I have) get defensive and say these things..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it was just a thought that passed through my head,<br/>
