&lt;&lt; My daughter is making plans to fly to NYC for a week with her boyfriend <br/>
next month. He has some good friends at NYU they can stay with.<br/>
 <br/>
 My husband has no fears about this at all, and encourages her to go and <br/>
experience. I&#39;m trying to see it that way, but I&#39;m not having much success at <br/>
the moment.<br/>

 Sigh.<br/>
