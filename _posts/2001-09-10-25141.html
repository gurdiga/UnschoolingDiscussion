<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984271653">Okay, here&#39;s my predicament. My 7 year old son says he wants to go back to <br/>
public school. Now, I&#39;m sure he would greatly dislike it knowing his <br/>
personality and how he&#39;s become accustomed to do as his interests call him. <br/>
The children in our neighborhood went back to school last Thursday. The day <br/>
before school was to start he told me he wanted to go too. I asked him why, <br/>
and he said he wants to see what teacher he would have, what classroom, what <br/>
the classrooms are like, what the kids do, etc. I told him, okay. If he <br/>
wanted that he didn&#39;t have to go back to school there. That I would call the <br/>
school and ask for them to allow us to visit and observe for a day. Well, my <br/>
son wasn&#39;t too pleased with this. He hasn&#39;t said it, but I know my son pretty <br/>
well and he tends to want to do what other kids are doing alot of the time. <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if he&#39;s feeling left out because he&#39;s not going back to school <br/>
like the rest of his friends. Our local homeschool support group is planning <br/>
a not-back-to-school day, but I&#39;m not sure if that would quench his want. I <br/>
figure it&#39;s probably normal for some kids to have this happen, them want to <br/>
go to public school when school starts and going back to school is the big <br/>
thing at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else dealt with this with their child? Any suggestions on how to <br/>
deal with the situation? I&#39;ve always told myself that if my child truely <br/>
wanted to go back to public school, I would keep an open ear, although now <br/>
that he&#39;s saying it, my heart is jumping in fear of even the thought. I want <br/>
to stay open to him though. I really don&#39;t think he would want to go back, <br/>
but it&#39;s what he says he wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
I went ahead and called the public school and told them we are homeschoolers <br/>
and that I have children who are curious about what goes on at &quot;school&quot; and <br/>
that we were welcome to in exchange answer any questions the <br/>
school/families/students may have about homeschooling. They told me that they <br/>
would have their principal call me back. I&#39;m not sure about actually having a <br/>
&quot;Field trip&quot; to the public school. If my kids do want to we will though.<br/>
<br/>
HELP!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143145935">Hi, I understand your fear. If the school would just let your child visit it <br/>
would not be so bad. But to have to let the principal and school ask you <br/>
questions on what you do in your homeschool is a bit much. Of course it <br/>
depends on what state you are in and what the laws are but I am sure that <br/>
most schools would not approve of unschooling. In some states it could be a <br/>
serious problem. I hope you are in a homeschool friendly state. Maybe your <br/>
child would like to visit a private school? Probably not. :)<br/>
<br/>
We to went through this once when my oldest was about 7. I kind of said we <br/>
will see and then I began to quickly look for ways to remove her attention <br/>
from school. I began to look for activities for my daughter to do. For <br/>
example she joined a karate club and started taking dance classes. She loved <br/>
both and I said you know if you went to school you could not do these <br/>
activities, there would not be enough time. I also made trips to the lake to <br/>
swim while everyone else was in school. Or we went to Grandma&#39;s, always a <br/>
favorite. A trip to the park with a homeschool friend. Etc.  Soon her friends <br/>
in public school were telling her how lucky she was to not have to go to <br/>
school and so she could do these fun things. Now she tells me that she is <br/>
glad we did not put her into school at her wishes. But it was not easy. <br/>
Knowing that she wanted to do something and steering her another way.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this works out well for you. <br/>
<br/>
Cheering you on no matter what your choice<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316167904">We&#39;re in California, which I&#39;ve heardn&#39;t isn&#39;t the most homeschool friendly <br/>
state. However we are actually considered public school students as we are <br/>
signed up with a home based charter school known as Horizon. That&#39;s a whole <br/>
other story. The charter school does let us unschool. The founder of the <br/>
charter school, Randy Gaschler, was quoted in an LA Weekly article recently <br/>
as saying &quot;Horizon does not require parents to teach anything or even to <br/>
teach, only that students learn, nor do we prevent it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, since we are legally considered public school students, I&#39;m not worried <br/>
about answering any questions. That was actually my idea to help educate <br/>
people about what homeschooling is. I know Stephen&#39;s kindergarten teacher was <br/>
very interested in homeschooling when we mentioned to her that we had decided <br/>
to do so after that school year was over. <br/>
<br/>
Stephen didn&#39;t ask me today about public school. Last week for 3 days <br/>
straight he kept telling me &quot;Tomorrow you have to bring me to the school so I <br/>
can go there now.&quot; I kinda came up with reasons why we couldn&#39;t the next day. <br/>
Have to go get something from grandma at her work, have to go see so-and-so. <br/>
If he keeps persuing it I&#39;m not sure if I can actually go forward and let he <br/>
enroll. I&#39;m sure before a week is even up he&#39;d be totally frustrated with it <br/>
and not wanting to go back again. Sigh. What to do what to do LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818127911">What&#39;s not homeschooler friendly?  You file a form (R4) and that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if we are talking honesty here, then saying you are unschooling and<br/>
using a charter means that you are not being honest with one or the other.<br/>
Either you are not unschooling or you are talking funds from the state under<br/>
false pretenses.<br/>
<br/>
As to Randy&#39;s quote in the LA paper, if I&#39;m not mistaken it was part of an<br/>
article that condemned him for misappropriation of funds, which btw, he is<br/>
currently being investigate for AND because of his creative bookkeeping he<br/>
is putting the whole charter system in jeopardy.<br/>
<br/>
Horizon states &quot;It is the ESs job to document the student&#39;s progress towards<br/>
the student standards. If a student has not made adequate progress towards<br/>
the student standards, it is the ESs responsibility to assign appropriate<br/>
attendance&quot; and the ESs must &quot;Key in a Learning Record. Information is<br/>
divided into these subtopics:  * Determine the assignment period. * Meet<br/>
face-to-face with the parent/student. * Assess the student&#39;s work product. *<br/>
Prepare the learning record&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Their charter with the state (which is currently under review for<br/>
revocation) states:  &quot;Students who attend the charter school will be<br/>
educated through individualized learning programs, cooperative classes,<br/>
supplemental learning projects, and distance learning via current<br/>
technology.&quot;  and &quot;Parents and their children work with their education<br/>
specialist to determine their educational goals and objectives, to create<br/>
their individualized **curriculum,** and to determine their individual<br/>
methods of **teaching** and learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It goes on about teaching, performing as well as ps students, knowing<br/>
history, math, science, civics, measurable student outcomes and things<br/>
students must demonstrate such as reading, types and styles of writing,<br/>
going to college or getting a job.<br/>
<br/>
So, if talking about contracts or required writing are giving the wrong<br/>
impression about unschooling and wanting to keep the definition &quot;pure,&quot;<br/>
then what does being enrolled in a ps charter do to that &quot;pure&quot;<br/>
image/definition?<br/>

too onerous. In the beginning it was easy - at the end of every month I<br/>
tried to think of what she had done and wrote it up in educationalese.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure it would work with all kids, but Cacie naturally did enough<br/>
different stuff that it worked out fine. During the first year she read<br/>
and was read to, bought stuff at the store, played games, went to the zoo<br/>
and science centers and regional parks, continued her Greek mythology<br/>
obsession, played soccer, drew pictures, cooked stuff, etc.  Later the<br/>
charter we were with (which is not as unschooling-friendly as Horizon)<br/>
started wanting work samples, so I threw in Yahtzee score sheets and<br/>
notes that said &quot;Mom!!! Get off the fone!!!&quot; and brochures from said<br/>
science centers and regional parks and zoos...people manage to unschool<br/>
in states with regulations at least as onerous as those Horizon has, it<br/>
just takes creativity and a kindred spirit as as your faciliator/ES<br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I did always give Cacie the option of being in or out of the<br/>
charter, and the $1100+ bucks was hers to spend on any approved<br/>
materials, which included pretty much any book or art supply she could<br/>
imagine, plus lots of games, videos, storytelling tapes... lots of stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569679834">If they are using clever language and double speak, then they are being<br/>
dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to enroll in a charter to homeschool in CA.  If you do, then<br/>
you are making an educational choice for your child and you either aren&#39;t<br/>
unschooling or you are taking schooling funds under false pretenses.<br/>
<br/>
You can use all kinds of excuses and defenses, but the bottomline is it is<br/>
dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect other people to pay for my children&#39;s interests.  I don&#39;t<br/>
like having to pay exhorbitant taxes to pay for public schools but I&#39;m stuck<br/>
with that.  However, I am really irritated paying for things like a pottery<br/>
studio for one family where the mother wanted to learn pottery and used<br/>
charter funds to set up her own studio!  And that is just one of dozens, if<br/>
not hundreds, of examples of misappropriate of funds.<br/>
<br/>
But, I might not have that irritant much longer as all of the fraud may<br/>
bring the whole charter thing tumbling down.  The finagling and cleaver<br/>
reporting has proven anything to anyone, it has irritated people and the<br/>
whole charter system may be effected.  It already has been once and now they<br/>
are talking a complete dismantling or revamping which would require all<br/>
charters to be school based and require attendance on a campus in some form<br/>
or another and testing.<br/>
<br/>
This dishonesty is also sending a slight ripple effect toward those who are<br/>
using R4s with the demands for testing starting to surface again.  Right now<br/>
all we have to do is fill in a form and turn it in once a year.  No testing,<br/>
no proving, no demands at all.<br/>
<br/>
There was a discussion about making life choices, in particular was jobs.<br/>
If you make the life choice to unschool, why should anyone else pay for you<br/>
to life your choice?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think she&#39;s asking you to personally write the check.  She&#39;s using an <br/>
option that is available in her community.  Your taxes aren&#39;t going to go <br/>
down if they eliminate this or any other educational program.  Whether or not <br/>
is it unschooling, whether or not it is run in an economically sound way, <br/>
whether or not your child or your family will use it, whether or not others <br/>
have abused the system, and the ps system -- these things don&#39;t enter into <br/>
it.  This is her decision and I think it very impolite to state that she is <br/>
dishonest to use something that is available to her to benefit her child and <br/>
to get thru the hogwash as best she can.<br/>
<br/>
In Florida, for instance, if you are registered with the county (instead of <br/>
an umbrella school) you have to have an annual evaluation.  The least onerous <br/>
method involves displaying a portfolio and log book and having a teacher <br/>
verify that your child has made appropriate progress.  Seems very anti-un to <br/>
me but you can get thru that hogwash and still continue to unschool.  Or you <br/>
can become an umbrella school -- which is what we did -- or enroll in one.  <br/>
Then the hogwash is reporting attendance!  <br/>
<br/>
But -- the point is -- most of us have a certain amount of hogwash to get <br/>
thru.  If you don&#39;t, you are lucky.<br/>
<br/>
Also in Florida, if your child is hsed thru the county registration, they are <br/>
eligible for special ed programs -- whatever the child would have received <br/>
had they been enrolled in ps.  So if your child needs speech therapy, for <br/>
instance, the county pays for it.  My taxes don&#39;t go down one bit when a <br/>
parent fails to enroll their child in speech therapy.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe that sort of thing is OK and it&#39;s just the &quot;frills&quot; like pottery <br/>
that are the big annoyance in your life.  <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, no matter what you would do, this program is available and this <br/>
mom wants it for her child and who are any of us to say someone is dishonest <br/>
for choosing something different from what we would choose.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765493221">I originally filed an R-4 when we first started homeschooling, however, we <br/>
were having severe problems wth some neighbors who threatened to call CPS on <br/>
us on almost a daily basis. I researched the charter school and after talking <br/>
to other homeschoolers we decided to go ahead and sign up with the charter <br/>
school as they provided us protection if/when CPS was called on us. I believe <br/>
it was the day after we signed the paperwork with the charterschool I had CPS <br/>
call me on the phone saying someone called them to report that my children do <br/>
not go to school. I gave them the phone number of the Educational Specialist <br/>
and it was dropped at that. We signed up in the middle of last &quot;school year&quot;. <br/>
By the end of the school year I again had CPS at my door, the same neighbors <br/>
called on me again. This time CPS kept on us for a while and then eventually <br/>
said they found nothing wrong and left us alone. Just yesterday I had the <br/>
police called on me by the same people again, accusing me of child neglect <br/>
becaue my children are outside playing instead of &quot;inside the house <br/>
learning&quot;. The policeman came out, took down our school information, checked <br/>
to make sure my children were in no danger. He in fact came up as we were <br/>
engaged in a game, laughing and having a great time together. Although I <br/>
don&#39;t feel I have to explain myself to anyone about why we do what we do, <br/>
it&#39;s what is working for us. I would much rather signup with the <br/>
charterschool for now and have the protection from the trouble my neighbors <br/>
are trying to cause then to loose my children to the kidnappers desguised as <br/>
a governmetn agency.<br/>
<br/>
As for unschooling in the charter, as Sandra Dodd said, some charters work <br/>
hard to allow unschooling. The way it works is as we go about our unschooling <br/>
lives I write down the &quot;educational activities&quot; my children do engage in and <br/>
these are categorized by subjects. Once a month I meet with our Educational <br/>
Specialist and I give her the information. Twice a year I turn over a <br/>
portfolio of samples of my childrens work. The portfolio we turned in last <br/>
year was pretty much photographs and tape recordings of my children. I don&#39;t <br/>
in any way encourage my children to pursue any specific areas of learning, <br/>
but I do notate what they do pursue and give that information over to the <br/>
charter.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to consider us not unschooling, then that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve never <br/>
said I&#39;m a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler and really don&#39;t want any such title. I perfer <br/>
to call ourselves natural learners, if we have to call ourselves anythign at <br/>
all. We do what works for us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the state often uses broad language, and people are chosing<br/>
unconventional ways to fulfill the requirements set by the state. I<br/>
worked for a charter, as well, and I know many of the California State<br/>
Standards backwards and forwards. It would be difficult to spend a day<br/>
and not touch on many of them. For example, students are expected to be<br/>
reading &quot;grade level appropriate text&quot;. In the schools, that would be<br/>
Houghton Mifflin&#39;s Grade 3 Reader. For Cacie, it may be Asterix or (her<br/>
new fave) Politically Correct Fairy Tales. Kids are supposed to &quot;know how<br/>
producers and consumers are related in food chains and webs&quot;. Feed the<br/>
apple core to the worms, feed the worms to the blue gill.  Of course, I<br/>
would phrase it as &quot;hands-on activities about how an apple core, worms,<br/>
and a fish are related in a food chain&quot;, because that&#39;s what she did, but<br/>
&quot;threw an apple core into the worm bin, and then dug up some worms and<br/>
threw them into the fish pond&quot; is also true.<br/>
<br/>
I think that unschoolers who manage to use charter schools successfully<br/>
are helping to change the public education system by making those<br/>
officials see another way of doing things. I would have loved to be a fly<br/>
on the wall when some of my reports were read, but it would have been<br/>
clear from reading them that learning was definitely happening, whether I<br/>
was teaching or not. The public education system should be just that,<br/>
public, meaning you and I and all of us get to decide how the money can<br/>
be used to best serve our children. As long as I don&#39;t have to force<br/>
Cacie to learn or do things she wouldn&#39;t otherwise do, simply to fulfill<br/>
the needs of the charter school, then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916110179">Here in CA you don&#39;t have to jump through hoops, there is no &quot;hogwash.&quot;<br/>
This isn&#39;t FL, you don&#39;t have to do anything but fill out a form once a<br/>
year.  If you register with a PUBLIC SCHOOL, why dance around and call it<br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
It is my tax money and when it is used fraudulently, then I complain.  I<br/>
don&#39;t believe in the apathy that allows all the government officials to get<br/>
away with nonsense, why let any others?  I don&#39;t know why this particular<br/>
mother is doing this, maybe she has valid reasons for her particular<br/>
circumstances which make it necessary.  Others don&#39;t and want it both ways.<br/>
Their choice to enroll their kids, not the kids&#39; choice AND they still want<br/>
to call it unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The point is, either this list is all about honesty and the &quot;pure&quot;<br/>
definition of unschooling or it is just a list about unschooling.  How come<br/>
&quot;this mom wants it for her child&quot; is peachy in this instance but it wasn&#39;t<br/>
o.k. for Bridgit?   What makes this different?<br/>
<br/>
And, it wasn&#39;t about pottery, it was about the MOTHER setting herself up<br/>
with a pottery studio.  Big diff!  Another woman started a recycling<br/>
business to run out of her home.  Another family used the money to take a<br/>
trip to Disneyland and used it to cover not only the &quot;students,&quot; but a<br/>
couple of their friends, the parents and the parents of the friends.  One<br/>
woman set up a home office so she could stay at home and run a home<br/>
business.  The list goes on and on and on.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t think she&#39;s asking you to personally write the check.  She&#39;s using<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; option that is available in her community.  Your taxes aren&#39;t going to go<br/>
&gt; down if they eliminate this or any other educational program.  Whether or<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; is it unschooling, whether or not it is run in an economically sound way,<br/>
&gt; whether or not your child or your family will use it, whether or not<br/>
others<br/>
&gt; have abused the system, and the ps system -- these things don&#39;t enter into<br/>
&gt; it.  This is her decision and I think it very impolite to state that she<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; dishonest to use something that is available to her to benefit her child<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; to get thru the hogwash as best she can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In Florida, for instance, if you are registered with the county (instead<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; an umbrella school) you have to have an annual evaluation.  The least<br/>
onerous &gt; method involves displaying a portfolio and log book and having a<br/>
teacher<br/>
&gt; verify that your child has made appropriate progress.  Seems very anti-un<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; me but you can get thru that hogwash and still continue to unschool.  Or<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; can become an umbrella school -- which is what we did -- or enroll in one.<br/>
&gt; Then the hogwash is reporting attendance!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But -- the point is -- most of us have a certain amount of hogwash to get<br/>
&gt; thru.  If you don&#39;t, you are lucky.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also in Florida, if your child is hsed thru the county registration, they<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; eligible for special ed programs -- whatever the child would have received<br/>
&gt; had they been enrolled in ps.  So if your child needs speech therapy, for<br/>
&gt; instance, the county pays for it.  My taxes don&#39;t go down one bit when a<br/>
&gt; parent fails to enroll their child in speech therapy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or maybe that sort of thing is OK and it&#39;s just the &quot;frills&quot; like pottery<br/>
&gt; that are the big annoyance in your life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At any rate, no matter what you would do, this program is available and<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; mom wants it for her child and who are any of us to say someone is<br/>
dishonest &gt; for choosing something different from what we would choose.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965550271">Curriculum is anything that is used to learn. So, curriculum for us would <br/>
include anything we come into contact with that grasps the children&#39;s <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
Meathod of teaching, well, our meathod of teaching is not teaching, in the <br/>
sense that teaching is usually thought of anyway. LOL<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all very interesting though. I have heard other&#39;s objections to <br/>
charterschools, however most people and/or organizations that are generally <br/>
against charterschools still do recommend them to people who are dealign with <br/>
CPS, are going through a divorce, have a spouse who is against homeschooling, <br/>
etc. Well, we&#39;re definately dealing with CPS thanks to my neighbors <br/>
constantly calling on us. No1 yet has found a problem, although they ask alot <br/>
of homeschool related questions. Thanks to us being in the charter they have <br/>
no grounds when it comes to education however. Education is the only area <br/>
they seem to question me about as my children are obviously fed, clean, don&#39;t <br/>
live in a trash heap (just a toy heap), are not beaten, etc etc etc. <br/>

&gt; &gt; The point is, either this list is all about honesty and the &quot;pure&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; definition of unschooling or it is just a list about unschooling.  How<br/>
come<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;this mom wants it for her child&quot; is peachy in this instance but it<br/>
wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; o.k. for Bridgit?   What makes this different?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because one is insisting that certain actions (&quot;as long as it meets my<br/>
basic<br/>
&gt; standards of HOW MUCH&quot; and &quot;I did tell Rachel that if she wants<br/>
&gt; to go to college this spreing she better get used to writing at least<br/>
&gt; that much a week&quot;) are necessary for learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another feels certain choices are necessary for legal reasons. Whether<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; is true in her case, whether you would choose differently, whether it&#39;s<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; what she feels most comfortable with, really isn&#39;t an unschooling issue<br/>
&gt; because it isn&#39;t about someone saying to a child &quot;You must do this in<br/>
order<br/>
&gt; to learn what you need to know&quot; and then insisting it is unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And, it wasn&#39;t about pottery, it was about the MOTHER setting herself up<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a pottery studio.  ... The list goes on and on and on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I think if you have issues with how your tax dollars are being used,<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t the people who are the recipients of the money you need to direct<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; anger at. There are thousands of those and attacking one or a dozen to<br/>
vent<br/>
&gt; your frustration only creates more anger, builds walls and shuts down<br/>
&gt; communication. Your anger can be most effectively directed at those who<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; the rules and enforce them to try to get things changed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030880730">*NOTE: If it&#39;s in quotes it is a quote.<br/>
<br/>
Cindy, you are full of more bs than a bunch of high school boys on Monday<br/>
morning as they talk about how they &#39;scored&#39; over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Fact, CA doesn&#39;t do squat with those R4s, ya turn them in and that&#39;s that.<br/>
Fact, you don&#39;t have to turn in reports.<br/>
Fact, no one comes to your door once a month to check on you.<br/>
Fact, you do not have to keep a record of the teacher&#39;s qualifications<br/>
unless you are teaching someone else&#39;s children.<br/>
Fact, not the same as a charter school.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter didn&#39;t make any such decision, YOU did.  In fact, perhaps you<br/>
forgot that you discussed YOUR dicisions on other lists, &quot;*I* am checking<br/>
out schools in our area.&quot; &quot;In an area of million dollar homes&quot;  &quot;*We* are<br/>
blessed with many schooling options.&quot;  &quot;*I* found a marvelous school for my<br/>
daughter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That would be after you bored us all to death with talks about the &quot;mansion&quot;<br/>
that had too many problems and &quot;doesn&#39;t meet our needs.&quot;  We were all so<br/>
happy when you finally decided on a house even though it was going to &quot;cost<br/>
more than the mansion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Never was there a mention of what your daughter wanted.  But there wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been when you started all this talk in 1999, would there since your<br/>
kids were 2 and 4 years old!  Precisely what classes did your four year old<br/>
ask you to go out and research schools for?<br/>
<br/>
I think that homeschooling mom who said you were a &quot;homeschooling wannabee&quot;<br/>
was correct in her estimation.  You have simply advanced to being an<br/>
unschooling wannabee.  You rag continually about homeschooling support<br/>
groups and playdays because no one but you knows how to do them right, the<br/>
mothers are lazy, the mothers aren&#39;t good parents, the mothers don&#39;t take<br/>
into consideration the age of your children.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve thrown snits on other lists and flounced off the NHEN board  because<br/>
&quot;I am appalled at how NHEN is run.&quot;  But the reality was they only &quot;hear<br/>
criticism from you, Cindy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You came to another list to run down all the folks on the NHEN board and<br/>
committees.  Poor Cindy, they wanted all the glory, you were doing all the<br/>
work.  &quot;Have you heard of [ ], she never does any work but takes credit for<br/>
everything I&#39;ve done.&quot; The other side of the coin is they felt &quot; it all<br/>
boils down to: Some people work, some people whine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The argument on other lists were 1) that if the parent enrolls a child in a<br/>
ps ISP and insists that the child attend classes then it isn&#39;t homeschooling<br/>
and certainly isn&#39;t unschooling, it is ps and 2) that if *you* make the<br/>
choice to enroll your child in a charter school, then it isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The argument stands, if your child is enrolled in CA in a ps and they attend<br/>
classes daily at the ps, you can call it anything you want but it sure isn&#39;t<br/>
homeschooling!  And if you are making the choices for the child, then you<br/>
aren&#39;t unschooling.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Here in CA you don&#39;t have to jump through hoops, there is no &quot;hogwash.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This isn&#39;t FL, you don&#39;t have to do anything but fill out a form once a<br/>
&gt; &gt; year. If you register with a PUBLIC SCHOOL, why dance around and call it<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Here in CA you must fulfill the obligations of a private school which are<br/>
:<br/>
&gt; offer instruction in the subjects listed in education code<br/>
&gt; keep attendance records<br/>
&gt; keep a record of the &quot;teacher&#39;s&quot; qualifications<br/>
&gt; maintain a course of study<br/>
&gt; This is the same thing I have to do for my charter school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Their choice to enroll their kids, not the kids&#39; choice AND they still<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to call it unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; My daughter wants to enroll since she wants to take the classes they<br/>
offer,<br/>
&gt; classes which are not offered to non-charter school students.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are full of shit, Lynda. And today of all days I cannot belive you<br/>
&gt; are pulling this. I have seen/read this same tired old argument from you<br/>
&gt; many times on several lists - that people who use charter schools cannot<br/>
&gt; be homeschoolers or cannot be unschoolers.<br/>

just chill out and be kind for a change. Your entire post was just rude<br/>

Bringing up stuff from other list (which probably have rules about<br/>
confidentiality, but you don&#39;t let that bother you) on this list is a<br/>
real breach of netiquette, and of course you&#39;re just giving us your<br/>
interpretation of whatever Cindy posted, which is worth less than a pile<br/>
of hot shit to me....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-494750219">Lynda- My children have never been in a class since we&#39;ve been in the charter <br/>
school. To me I don&#39;t see how what we do can be considered as not <br/>
unschooling. I chose what internet service provider we now use, does that <br/>
mean we don&#39;t unschool even though my children use it as they please, make <br/>
their own decisions on how and when to use it and what to use? I chose the <br/>
charterschool and I believe I chose to do so with good reason. I didn&#39;t sign <br/>
with them just to sign with them. I&#39;m trying to protect my children from <br/>
being kidnapped by CPS. My children choose what they do with their own <br/>
education. If we purchase anything wth the funds we get, they choose it, if <br/>
we use the funds at all. When I explained to my children what the charter <br/>
school program was, what they did for us, and what mommy would have to do for <br/>
them, my children were okay with this. They have never objected to being in <br/>
the charter school. As far as they are concerned they are a homeschool <br/>
family. <br/>
