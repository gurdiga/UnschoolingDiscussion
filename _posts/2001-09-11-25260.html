<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248060625">This is so very upsetting. I am bundle of nerves while I await calls from<br/>
some friends. I have heard from my mom (in Washington DC), her husband is a<br/>
big wig in the military and often consults with the Presidents (Reagan thru<br/>
current)...  My husband is military, my brother too. We have lots of friends<br/>
in military and I have a girlfriend in New York City. This certaintly  puts<br/>
all our petty disagreements in proper perspective. I ask that we all pray in<br/>
are own way. This is incredibly serious.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone with family in any of the areas or flights can call the Red Cross.<br/>
They are amazing and will help. If they can&#39;t they will give you the numbers<br/>
of people who can. Michele I hope that helps....I will pray for you and your<br/>
daughters. Keep us updated.<br/>
