<br/>
I&#39;ve read and heard it for years.  I think (not sure) it&#39;s a John Holt quote, <br/>
but I&#39;ll keep looking.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the context of it was that once language and understanding are in <br/>
place, the information is not that large a body of stuff.  Foreigners who <br/>
move here learn it all very quickly (American history, and the terminology <br/>
relating to science and math.<br/>
<br/>
I had a boyfriend in college who moved to Toronto from India when he was 12 <br/>
or 13.  He was in New Jersey for high school and New Mexico for college.  He <br/>
was not &quot;behind&quot; in any way, and he wasn&#39;t from fancy schools or a rich <br/>
background in India, either.  His dad was an &quot;academically gifted&quot; <br/>
untouchable on government scholarship to get a master&#39;s and PhD in physics.  <br/>
The only English he had known when he moved to Toronto was the lyrics to a <br/>
Harry Belafonte album.  <br/>
<br/>
The difference was he was aware of the world around him.  What was left was <br/>
the vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
To explain leaves turning to a six year old takes a couple of explanations.  <br/>
They&#39;re still not clear on how long a year is, or what causes a year, or how <br/>
long a month is.  By fourteen, they&#39;ll have figured that out on their own or <br/>
through conversational inquiry.  What takes an hour or two at six takes <br/>
thirty seconds at 15.<br/>
<br/>
I hope someone finds that quote before I do!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628251260">I don&#39;t know which part is throwing you off, but grammatically, the part that reads &quot;In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the excitement and gladness&quot; is incorrect, I believe. It does not constitute a complete sentence and so should not be followed by a colon.<br/>
<br/>
The question is whether, in terms of meaning, that phrase belongs to the sentence before it, as in &quot;See [life] for the fathomless mystery that it is, in the boredom and pain of [life] no less than in the excitement and gladness of it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Or, more likely, with the sentence that follows the colon, as in &quot;Touch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of [life]--in the boredom and pain of it no less than in the excitement and gladness--because in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it could also be corrected by simply changing the colon to a comma and transforming that first part into an introductory phrase.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you were looking for? &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kathy --<br/>
<br/>
Buechner is just wordy, and plays around with difficult punctuation quite a <br/>
bit.  It&#39;s his style.  He&#39;s a poet/philosopher, imo (although he is famous as a <br/>
novelist, essayist, and memoirist), and utilizes lots of sentence fragments <br/>
and the like for dramatic effect.  He&#39;s not easy to read, so you&#39;re not alone!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For understanding, this quote could easily be translated to say something <br/>
like, *Listen to your life.  See it for the fathomless mystery that it is.  <br/>
Experience the boredom and pain of your life no less than the excitement and <br/>
gladness of it.  Touch, taste, and smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of <br/>
it, because in the last analysis, ALL moments are key moments, and life itself <br/>
is grace.*<br/>
<br/>
That may be clearer, but it&#39;s not as poetic or graceful as Buechner&#39;s <br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
Just for grins, here is his original wording and phrasing placed in (my <br/>
admittedly klunky) poetic form.  When I read his prose I often breathe it out as <br/>
poetry.  It helps.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to your life.<br/>
See it for the fathomless mystery that it is.<br/>
       In the boredom and pain of it<br/>
       no less than in the excitement and gladness:<br/>
             touch, <br/>
             taste, <br/>
             smell<br/>
                   your way to the holy and hidden heart of it<br/>
       because in the last analysis<br/>
             all moments are key moments,<br/>
             and life itself<br/>
                   is grace.<br/>

This was fun.  Thanks.<br/>
