It&#39;s disingenuous - and illogical - to say that conservative <br/>
Christians spank their children *because* they are conservative <br/>
Christians.  And it is equally disingenuous to presume that <br/>
all &quot;spankers&quot; are conservative Christians.<br/>

Very true.  I have been in more than one church where classes were offered<br/>
on how to discipline in a biblical manner, it was always about spanking and<br/>
&quot;the rod&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
After one incident, where my 3 yo was acting like a 3 yo, I was handed an<br/>
article instructing me how to spank the rebellious spirit out of him.  I<br/>
read it and said &quot;Why would I want to break his spirit, even if it is<br/>
rebellious at times?  HE&#39;S THREE!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I learned after a while, to keep my copy of &quot;The Discipline Book&quot; by Dr.<br/>

by a Christian pediatrician who advised against spanking.  I wish there were<br/>

The UK is out-lawing spanking, hitting etc to bring us in line with other European countries.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if people pressurised their representatives to get the US to sign up to the Human Rights Act and The Rights of a Child then spanking would one day be outlawed here too?<br/>

economic levels.  I&#39;m not arguing that there is NOT a preponderance <br/>

that spankers were conservative Christians; I simply pointed out that <br/>
not all spankers are conservative Christians, nor are all <br/>
conservative Christians spankers.  It&#39;s an illogical allegation.<br/>

because of inability to manage anger or frustration, or because they <br/>

Christian aligns with mine.  There are some fundamentalist Christians <br/>
whose theologies and practices I find disturbing, but I wouldn&#39;t call <br/>
them conservative Christians.  I am &quot;conservative&quot; in the political <br/>
sense I that want as little governmental involvement in my life as <br/>
possible; and since I&#39;m Catholic I am, technically, a Christian <br/>
(although there are some who would disagree &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your &quot;conservative Christian&quot; equates to my &quot;fundamentalist <br/>
Christian&quot;?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t necessarily agree with you.  Most Christians who spank have <br/>
read James Dobson&#39;s books on child discipline.  His books definitely <br/>
encourage people NOT to spank out of anger.  He instructs parents to <br/>
calmly and lovingly sit down with their kids and explain what they <br/>
did that was disobedient, to spank them, and to tell the kids that <br/>
they love them.  I know many parents who spank, who truly love their <br/>
kids and are dedicated to being the best possible parents they can <br/>
be.  It&#39;s just that they think that spanking is one of the best <br/>
things they can do for their kids.  As a matter of fact, most of them <br/>
hate to spank their kids, but do it because they think it&#39;s the right <br/>
thing to do.    <br/>

a conservative Christian does not, in itself, make anyone a spanker.  <br/>
The spanker must personally accept the philosophy and the purported <br/>
need for spanking.  Since this thread began, I have asked many <br/>
friends who consider themselves conservative Christians about <br/>
spanking, and they are disgusted by the thought of deliberately <br/>
inflicting harm upon a child, particularly in the name of God.  It <br/>
has NOTHING to do with Christianity; it has to do with a person&#39;s <br/>
sense of power and control.  This applies both to the alleged <br/>
Christian leaders who encourage spanking, and to the parents <br/>
themselves who abdicate their responsibility to their child and spank <br/>
because someone told them to.<br/>
<br/>
We will agree to disagree; I know many conservative Christians, and <br/>
they are not spankers, nor do their ministers tell them to spank.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those &quot;authors, preachers, speakers and spankers&quot; are espousing a <br/>
personal conviction on spanking, and their followers are choosing to <br/>
believe them, and to embrace their beliefs.<br/>
   <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I take people at their word. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is no reason why you shouldn&#39;t; however, surely it must have <br/>
occurred to you that spankers who hit their children because they&#39;re <br/>
filled with anger and frustration, because they&#39;re bigger and <br/>
stronger than a child, or because (this sickens me) they LIKE to <br/>
spank, are unlikely to TELL you so.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ll repeat what I wrote before, that you quoted only a portion of:<br/>

population because there are churches that encourage their <br/>
congregation to spank.  I&#39;m sorry, but I cannot believe that any <br/>
parent who is philosophically opposed to spanking their child, can be <br/>
unwillingly coerced into spanking.  They can find another church; <br/>
there are plenty out there.<br/>

force an unwilling parent to spank their child; nor can any speaker <br/>
force an unwilling parent to spank.  Parents who are feeling coerced <br/>
and are opposed to spanking can walk away from a book, a speaker, a <br/>
church.  They do not HAVE to spank; they are making a choice, a <br/>
decision, to spank; and if they claim coercion, it is because they <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s unlikely that a person who strongly believes in attachment parenting<br/>
and no spanking and so on would be drawn to a fundamentalist Church.<br/>
<br/>
But a certain personality -- a need to have all the answers laid out nicely<br/>
and neatly for them? -- that makes fundamentalist seem attractive, is what<br/>
would persuaded them that they need to let go of their humanist thinking and<br/>
spanking is what they must do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying all fundamentalists are like that. Only that those with that<br/>
type of personality will be drawn to fundamentalism. And those who are drawn<br/>
because they need to feel a part of a community that holds the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
answers will easily be persuaded to spank their children.<br/>

population because there are churches that encourage their <br/>
congregation to spank.  I&#39;m sorry, but I cannot believe that any <br/>
parent who is philosophically opposed to spanking their child, can be <br/>
unwillingly coerced into spanking.  They can find another church; <br/>
there are plenty out there.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You haven&#39;t been around many fundamentalists if you think finding another <br/>
church is an easy option.  And there are some parts of the country and some <br/>
social circles where one could go a long way and only find other churches <br/>
with the same basic beliefs, practices, and even church schedules.  7:00 <br/>
Wednesday night is prayer meeting.  There&#39;s a mini rush-hour because SO many <br/>
people are going to prayer meeting.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Again, these are choices that a parent makes.  A book itself cannot <br/>
force an unwilling parent to spank their child; nor can any speaker <br/>
force an unwilling parent to spank.  Parents who are feeling coerced <br/>
and are opposed to spanking can walk away from a book, a speaker, a <br/>
church.  They do not HAVE to spank; they are making a choice, a <br/>
decision, to spank; and if they claim coercion, it is because they <br/>
allowed themselves to be coerced.  They oughta grow a spine and <br/>
say, &quot;No.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And when they make that choice to spank and not to walk away, they do it out <br/>
of religious conviction, because of Bible verses which fence them in.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is making this up or being mean or unfair.  <br/>
This stuff is real and huge.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the reason that that the U.S. won&#39;t go along with the United Nations <br/>
Rights of the Child.  THAT is international politics.   Much of their <br/>
argument is available on the web.  You should go and read it.  Or if you&#39;re <br/>
unwilling to read it, you shouldn&#39;t argue that it&#39;s not real and powerful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646572040">The thing about the U.N. Declaration of rights of the child is that <br/>
it would be an international law, not a U.S. law.  That means that a <br/>
gov&#39;t agency outside our own country--and a court outside our own <br/>
country--would have the right to prosecute parents.  As an American, <br/>
I&#39;m unwilling to see our country give up our independent <br/>
sovereignty.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m concerned that it could lead to other things--like having the <br/>
U.N. decide that it&#39;s in all children&#39;s best interests to go to <br/>
school, or to be vaccinated, or whatever.  I value my right as a <br/>
parent to decide what is best for my children.  No one else will <br/>
stick up for my children&#39;s rights like me.  <br/>

Awhile ago, people on this list were upset because people were <br/>

liberal. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking about groups like this: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nogreaterjoy.org/ProdTTUAC.htm">http://www.nogreaterjoy.org/ProdTTUAC.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
The book, &quot;To Train Up a Child&quot; is for sale there.  You can read the <br/>
first chapter right on that site.  It is very troubling.  This is the <br/>
stuff that some Christian parents are taking seriously.  It is, in my <br/>
opinion, the kind of stuff that gives Christians a very bad name.  It <br/>
is not supposed to be what Christianity is about. :( <br/>
<br/>
They actually suggest setting a child up, so that you can &quot;train&quot; him <br/>
(with a switch) not to touch things that he shouldn&#39;t.  That way your <br/>
children will obey you in public, and people will marvel at your well <br/>
behaved children: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Try it yourself. Place an appealing object where they can reach it, <br/>
maybe in a &quot;No-no&quot; corner or on an apple juice table (That&#39;s where <br/>
the coffee table once sat). When they spy it and make a dive for it, <br/>
in a calm voice say, &quot;No, don&#39;t touch it.&quot; They will already be <br/>
familiar with the &quot;No,&quot; so they will pause, look at you in wonder and <br/>
then turn around and grab it. Switch their hand once and <br/>
simultaneously say, &quot;No.&quot; Remember, you are not disciplining, you are <br/>
training. One spat with a little switch is enough. They will again <br/>
pull back their hand and consider the relationship between the <br/>
object, their desire, the command and the little reinforcing pain. It <br/>
may take several times, but if you are consistent, they will learn to <br/>
consistently obey, even in your absence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and to make a wiggly toddler sit still on your lap: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;For the next weary forty-five minutes, fifteen times the child would <br/>
make his legs move, and the daddy would turn him around and spank his <br/>
legs. The father was as calm as a lazy porch swing on a Sunday <br/>
afternoon. There was no hastiness or anger. He did not take the <br/>
disobedience personally. He had trained many a horse or mule and knew <br/>
the value of patient perseverance. In the end, the twelve-month-old <br/>
submitted his will to his father, sat as he was placed, and became <br/>
contenteven cheerful.&quot; <br/>

Virginia is currently considering a law that will force clinics and doctors to inform parents if a young person comes to them about STD&#39;s or pregnancy. Which will of course, lead to young people not<br/>
going to the doctors. This could have devastating effects on a young woman&#39;s fertility is chlamydia isn&#39;t diagnosed in time. If she&#39;s frightened that her parents will find outshe&#39;s sexually active then<br/>
she wont go to a  clinic.<br/>

religions spank is a cultural practice. It&#39;s passed on by families. It&#39;s<br/>
community &quot;wisdom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Spanking is a cultural practice in America too.<br/>
<br/>
But fundamentalists spank because it&#39;s a mandate from God. It overrides<br/>
family and community and personal practices because it&#39;s what God<br/>
(supposedly) wants them to do.<br/>
<br/>
I tried Sandra&#39;s suggestion and typed in &quot;spanking children&quot; and then<br/>
jewish, muslim and christian. It isn&#39;t obvious from the descriptions that<br/>
Jewish or Muslim hits are religious in nature. You have to actually visit<br/>
the pages to find religious writings quoted. And the Jewish one also looks<br/>
to secular information to come to a conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s no question about the Christian sites. You don&#39;t even have to<br/>
visit the pages to see references to the Bible. The first screenful of hits<br/>
is down below the Jewish and Muslim sites. (If you dig into any of them<br/>
you&#39;ll see some mighty disturbing stuff. Not just because it&#39;s spanking, but<br/>
because of the need to control and make children behave as they are supposed<br/>
to.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the Jewish and Muslim pages that reference religous writings that I<br/>
found on the first screenful:<br/>

Spare the Rod?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does Judaism advise spanking a disobedient<br/>
&gt; child?<br/>
&gt; The Bible says yes. The &quot;rebellious son&quot; is to<br/>
&gt; be put to death by stoning (Deut. 21:18-21), and<br/>
&gt; Proverbs (13:24) teaches: &quot;He who spares the rod<br/>
&gt; hates his son.&quot;<br/>
&gt; But by the talmudic period, these harsh doc-<br/>
&gt; trines of parental discipline were replaced with an<br/>
&gt; emphasis on kindness and compassion. The Tal-<br/>
&gt; mud defines the &quot;rebellious son&quot; out of existence<br/>
&gt; (San. 71a), rules that a teacher could punish a<br/>
&gt; student at most with a leather shoelace (<br/>
&gt; Bava Batra<br/>
&gt; 21a), outlaws hitting grown children (<br/>
&gt; Mo&#39;ed Katan<br/>
&gt; 17a), and declares: &quot;With a child, push away with<br/>
&gt; the left hand, and draw near with the right&quot;(<br/>
&gt; Sotah<br/>
&gt; 47a)-the right hand normally being the stron-<br/>
&gt; ger. As a result of these rabbinic teachings, tradi-<br/>
&gt; tional Jewish homes were noted for treating their<br/>
&gt; children with love and warmth. Still, corporal pun-<br/>
&gt; ishment was not eliminated in the traditional re-<br/>
&gt; ligious school for boys-the<br/>
&gt; cheder-<br/>
&gt; in Eastern<br/>
&gt; Europe, where teachers often hit their students<br/>
&gt; for even minor infractions.<br/>
&gt; Modern social science is still divided on the<br/>
&gt; question &quot;to spank or not to spank.&quot; In 1996, Dr.<br/>
&gt; Murray A. Straus, a professor at the University of<br/>
&gt; New Hampshire, and Dr. Robert Larzelere of Boys<br/>
&gt; Town began a continuing debate in the journal<br/>
&gt; Pediatrics <br/>
&gt; on the effectiveness of spanking. Dr.<br/>
&gt; Straus argued that many studies, including his<br/>
&gt; own, show that spanked children become more<br/>
&gt; antisocial and do worse in school. Dr. Larzelere<br/>
&gt; challenged Straus&#39;s conclusion, claiming that the<br/>
&gt; damaging effects of spanking are true only in cases<br/>
&gt; of frequent spanking and of corporal punishment<br/>
&gt; of older children. For two- to six-year-olds, he<br/>
&gt; wrote, occasional non-abusive spanking (&quot;two<br/>
&gt; open-handed swats to the buttocks leaving no<br/>
&gt; bruise&quot;) is beneficial as a back-up to time-outs and<br/>
&gt; reasoning; when the children turn seven, time-<br/>
&gt; outs and reasoning alone-with spanking in re-<br/>
&gt; serve-have become so effective that spanking is<br/>
&gt; no longer necessary.<br/>
&gt; Both sides of the debate agree that spanking<br/>
&gt; school-age children is undesirable. As for toddlers,<br/>
&gt; nearly half of American parents oppose spanking,<br/>
&gt; but, according to Straus, nearly all resort to cor-<br/>
&gt; poral punishment on occasion. With the debate<br/>
&gt; on disciplining toddlers still unsettled, A good<br/>
&gt; Reform Jewish approach would be to err on the<br/>
&gt; side of compassion and follow Straus&#39;s advice never<br/>
&gt; to spank.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is this attitude of mercy and gentleness which I and many other Muslim<br/>
&gt; parents believe forms a major part of Islam¹s compatibility with Attachment<br/>
&gt; Parenting. For example, spanking of young children is explicitly prohibited<br/>
&gt; according to Islamic law. Use of bad language and intimidation are also alien<br/>
&gt; to the Islamic tradition, as the Qur¹an says not to use bad language unless<br/>
&gt; one has been ³gravely wronged² and the Prophet never cursed, used bad language<br/>
&gt; or insults, and never hit any person, animal, or inanimate object. One of his<br/>
&gt; Companions said ³I have never seen anyone more kind to his family than the<br/>
&gt; Messenger of Allah.² Practices such as allowing a baby to ³cry it out² in<br/>
&gt; order to train it to sleep or eat on a schedule are considered vicious by this<br/>
&gt; standard. The Prophet was known to be very sensitive to the cry of babies,<br/>
&gt; even shortening the congregational prayer when he heard the babies in the<br/>
&gt; mosque crying. He would also lengthen his solitary prayer as his grandson<br/>
&gt; played on his back, as he did not want to disturb the child¹s play. These<br/>
&gt; small deeds are actually very profound statements of the status of children in<br/>
&gt; Islam, as it is prohibited to lengthen or alter the prayer in any way in order<br/>
&gt; to accommodate other people such as somebody who may have joined the<br/>
&gt; congregational prayer late, yet the Prophet made exceptions for children.<br/>
