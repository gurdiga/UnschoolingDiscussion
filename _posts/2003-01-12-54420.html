<div id="ygrps-yiv-32358665">I completely agree with both Shyrley and Sheila on this one.  It&#39;s one of my<br/>
pet peeves that when my babies screamed while riding on long trips if I took<br/>
them out of the carseat to breastfeed or just to hold, I became a<br/>
law-breaker.  Now my 12 yos doesn&#39;t want to wear his seatbelt, and if we are<br/>
stopped for that (it&#39;s a level 1 offense or something like that, means that<br/>
we can be stopped for that  reason) the cost would be about $100.  I&#39;ve told<br/>
him that I can&#39;t *make* him wear it, but if we get a ticket for that he&#39;ll<br/>
have to come up with the money.  That would probably mean selling his PS2.<br/>
He still needs reminding (I just ask when we get in, &quot;Everyone have the<br/>
seatbelt on?&quot;) but he isn&#39;t fussing.  I hope this is more explaining a<br/>
natural consequence than coercion!<br/>
<br/>
Sheila, it might not take 5 years with sledding.  A 20 yo student at our<br/>
local college was killed in Dec. sledding on the hill at the school.  She<br/>
and another girl went out after studying for finals, on a tube, ran into a<br/>
scoreboard pole.  She hit her head.  It was a freak accident, but it really<br/>
struck me hard.  I have a 20yod who is away at college too - I just couldn&#39;t<br/>
imagine getting that phone call...  Also, it happened at 11 pm (the hill is<br/>
well-lit).  My family had just been there for the first time ever &quot;after<br/>
dark&quot; until about 7 that same evening. &lt;&lt;ooh, shivers&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
FYI, they shut the hill down for sledding &quot;out of respect for the family&quot;<br/>
but with the letters in the newspaper and city councilmembers asking for it<br/>
to reopen, it opened up when school started back last week (the next real<br/>
snowfall of the season happened then, too!).  The scoreboard has been<br/>
removed and no more sledding at night.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe they&#39;ll ban cars. 40,000 Americans are killed in them every year. Hundreds of thousands injured. Not county pedestrians and cyclists run over. How come they focus on the &#39;rare&#39; accidents and<br/>
over-llook the big whopping death rate?<br/>
As for helmets, car drivers are more likely to have a head injury in an accident than a cyclist. Helmets for cars next?<br/>

belts, registration etc and believe me they never give tickets.  They usually <br/>
see me breastfeeding and wave my husband by. LOL.  Of course that was a <br/>
couple of years ago.  <br/>
