When the  kids were younger, I did buy a LOT of stuff in which they <br/>
showed  absolutely no interest - I made a lot of mistakes. Sometimes, <br/>
later,   one of them discovered something I&#39;d bought years earlier and <br/>
loved  it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
================<br/>
 <br/>
Same here.  There are COOL things no one ever cared about, but there  are <br/>
also things that cost little to nothing that have been played with and shown  off <br/>
over and over.<br/>
 <br/>
I bought a little wood-carving of an owl the other day, from Japan.   $1.98 <br/>
at Goodwill.  Mostly I thought my husband would like to see it.   It was all <br/>
cut from one stick of wood, and there were curly wing feathers and  tail <br/>
feathers.  I put it on the island counter in the kitchen, and  everyone, family <br/>
member and guest, has picked it up and looked.  Holly  reminded me we had another <br/>
carved owl she found in a woodpile in a friend&#39;s  house when she was little, so <br/>
we put them together.  <br/>
 <br/>
There have been $15 books that got barely a glance.<br/>
 <br/>
But it&#39;s been that way with my husband too, and adult friends. Sometimes we  <br/>
pick a restaurant or recommend a movie or give a gift that kinda falls  flat.  <br/>
Other times the slightest whiff of a hint turns into some  life-changing <br/>
interest-fest.<br/>
 <br/>
Backing off of offering doesn&#39;t do it.  Offer more.<br/>
