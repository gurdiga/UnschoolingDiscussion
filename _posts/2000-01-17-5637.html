&lt;&lt;i&#39;m certainly not saying all children should have an equal desire to be <br/>
quiet<br/>
<br/>
(to look inward) and be stimulated (to look outward)- not at all - that would<br/>
<br/>
make for a boring world.  what i am saying is that a child should be taught <br/>
the<br/>
<br/>
skills to make choices rather than be at the mercy of their natures.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought about it that way, but that is a helpful idea.  Any <br/>
suggestions for a pessimistic child, who thinks he doesn&#39;t want to go places, <br/>
but seems to enjoy them when he does get there? I&#39;m not willing to force him <br/>
to go to the park (unless I&#39;m desperate to see my own friends.)<br/>

out&quot; kid.  One of mine went through this stage bad!  Sometimes I do tell<br/>
my kids we are going somewhere for me.  I might suggest they bring along<br/>
a solitary activity (which usually ends up staying in the car once we get<br/>
where we are going).  Another of my children spent many a &quot;moms and kids&quot;<br/>
gathering sitting on my lap and not interacting with anyone.  I just went<br/>
with it.<br/>
