<div id="ygrps-yiv-419227173">Bridget, sounds like a great life!  Let me tell you something that I once<br/>
witnessed.  I worked in the daycare area of a church for all the ladies<br/>
Bible Studies when my kids were babies.  There was this one little boy<br/>
who was so difficult, he wouldn&#39;t let anyone talk to him or come near to<br/>
him because his mother was gone and he was mad about this.  He also<br/>
kicked and hit and cried constantly because of it.  Most children would<br/>
get over it a few minutes after Mom was gone, but he kept on.  He would<br/>
settle down a little to play all by himself in a corner, but I felt it<br/>
was impossible to reach him.  His mom was amazing!  She would hug and<br/>
kiss him and praise him for doing such a great job, etc.  Before I knew<br/>
it, he was totally happy there and full of joy.  I believe her positive<br/>
attitude and praise created the change.  I think as long as you speak<br/>
life and don&#39;t give in to fear your son is going to turn out to maximum<br/>
positive potential!  How wonderful that he&#39;s not a victim of the system,<br/>
but has such a great environment to grow in, in spite of all internal<br/>
difficulties.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512334066">I&#39;ve been reading the back and forth about various issues, particularly <br/>
around Bridget and whether or not she is an unschooler, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget, it&#39;s clear that you feel terribly misunderstood. And we all may very <br/>
well be misunderstanding you. It can be easy to get flustered and express <br/>
yourself in ways that might not really illustrate what your life and your <br/>
children&#39;s lives look like. <br/>
<br/>
From my perspective, most of what you have posted really doesn&#39;t look like <br/>
unschooling--particularly &quot;pure&quot; unschooling. That doesn&#39;t mean that lots (or <br/>
even most) of what you and your kids do DOESN&#39;T look like that. But most of <br/>
what you&#39;ve shared has looked pretty structured.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, most of what you&#39;ve shared about your kids has been their <br/>
problems or bad habits. Now all of us, including our kids, have those. But <br/>
you haven&#39;t really shared much about what&#39;s really wonderful about your kids, <br/>
or your own Ah-HAH moments. Maybe that&#39;s because you&#39;ve felt you&#39;ve needed to <br/>
defend yourself. But the result is that you come off looking like you see <br/>
your kids as adversaries, and yourself as extremely controlling.  From your <br/>
friend&#39;s post, I recognize that those are probably not true, but your <br/>
descriptions of your life are very different.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a gentle list. The most vocal people are very protective of the <br/>
concept of unschooling, and often come off as quite harsh. But consider the <br/>
possibility that while most of what you do might look like unschooling, what <br/>
you have described on the list does not. You might make decisions based on <br/>
what you feel your kids need that don&#39;t fit into Radical Unschooling, and <br/>
that&#39;s fine. But try to understand that all we know about you and your life <br/>
is what you say here. When one feels misunderstood by a whole lot of people, <br/>
it usually means there&#39;s a problem with how they&#39;re communicating.<br/>

misrepresented and had things assumed of me.  I was put on the defensive,<br/>
and when I forced myself to stop being defensive, I was told I am a bad<br/>
mother so I pretty much just went away yesterday (had more important<br/>
things to do anyway) before I could even get a word in good about any of<br/>
my kids.  And the thing is there are pompous people on this list who keep<br/>
saying they want to help people and that they should not judge and that<br/>
they should listen and give people the opportunity to explain.  None of<br/>
that happened to me when I joined this list.  Even when I explained or<br/>
expanded on statements, they were still taken to mean what certain people<br/>
initially assumed about them.  <br/>
If this is any indication of what happens here regularly, that&#39;s scary<br/>
because many people I know, would have left before they ever could have<br/>
gotten any useful or friendly posts of which there have been many.  Had I<br/>
not weathered the initial negativity, I would never have know many of<br/>
you.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, if you would like to hear the good things that go on here, I&#39;d be<br/>
happy to share, assuming that I am not going to be accused of lying,<br/>
misresenting or just plain not knowing what the hell I&#39;m talking about as<br/>
I have been over our problems.<br/>
<br/>
Rachel (the one on prozac and allergic to corn) is 16 and is a great<br/>
driver.  She has had her liscense for about 6 months now and I really<br/>
don&#39;t know what I would do without her.  She is now my chauffer and I<br/>
love it.  She is also my musical one.  She has a keyboard and is self<br/>
taught.  One night I heard what I thought was one of the programmed<br/>
pieces playing from her keyboard and I walked in to find her playing it. <br/>
She has borrowed a violin from a friend and is trying to learn that now<br/>
too.  She also makes hemp necklaces and gardens and is &#39;wickedly<br/>
ironical&#39;.  She is the one who coined, &quot;Well of course more people died<br/>
than at Pearl Harbor, inflation you know.&quot;  She took the ACT (so she can<br/>
go to college) with three weeks notice and score a composite 24.  Pretty<br/>
cool for a kid who has done practically nothing remotely resembling<br/>
&#39;schoolwork&#39; for 6 years.<br/>
<br/>
Jenni (allergic to milk) is the reader and the real voice of humor in the<br/>
family.  She spouts deadpan humor so well I can&#39;t even duplicate it here.<br/>
 She also whipped through the entine Janet Evanovich seven book series in<br/>
about a week and a half and two of the days were spent waiting for the<br/>
next book to show up.  She is 14 going on 35, can find a pun in a<br/>
haystack of needles.  Loves animals and little kids but does not want to<br/>
be a veteranarian or a pediatrition because she just could not stand to<br/>
put them to sleep.  (There&#39;s that humor.)  She is also the one who can be<br/>
found lyingon the picnic table next to her father at night watching the<br/>
sky.  I really don;t know what they are looking for but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll<br/>
tell me when it arrives.<br/>
<br/>
Wyndham is the problem child.  He is 9 and has the potential to be a very<br/>
troubled human being.  He is mildly OCD, allergic to everything and just<br/>
plain difficult.  All the same, the girls say I love him best.  I think I<br/>
just love them the amounts they need to be loved and he needs more.  He<br/>
is a mechanical marvel.  He likes to build things and take them apart. <br/>
He is learninghow to drive the tractor this week with the help of both my<br/>
husband and our exchange student.  He talks a lot.  Rachel once told him<br/>
that he is like the radio always on, so sometimes we forget to listen. <br/>
All in all, he is not a &#39;bad&#39; kid,  he just needs lots and lots of extra<br/>
attention to grow up.<br/>
<br/>
We moved last summer from a busy city street to a busy country one.  We<br/>
have 8 acres on a state route just south of Akron, Ohio.  Close enough to<br/>
the hospital and city but in a place that feels very rural.  It has apple<br/>
trees, pear trees, cherry trees, grapes and raspberries all of which were<br/>
cultivated then allowed to go wild for 15 years.  We are trying to<br/>
reestablish the gardens and grape arbors but they are all so overrun, it<br/>
is a difficult and slow job.  We are dicussing clear cutting the arbor<br/>
because we are not making much progress separating the grapes from the<br/>
multiflora rose.  My herb garden is still in pots but I have hopes for<br/>
next spring.  My vegie garden produced tomatoes and zucchini this year,<br/>
and some peas for snacking on but they never made it into the house.  We<br/>
also got some cute little mini watermelons about te size of baseballs. <br/>
Cute little things, and they tasted great.<br/>
<br/>
We have plans for a pond and possible some more critters of the larger<br/>
variety.  We also have a trail through the wooded back half of the<br/>
property.  But what sold us on it was the fact that this property has two<br/>
houses.  One for us and one for my mother.  We had been living two<br/>
counties away from each other and this is great.  We can help her when<br/>
she needs it but she still has her own place.<br/>

&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know what I would do without her.  She is now my chauffer and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; love it.  She is also my musical one.  She has a keyboard and is self<br/>
&gt; &gt; taught.  One night I heard what I thought was one of the programmed<br/>
&gt; &gt; pieces playing from her keyboard and I walked in to find her playing it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; She has borrowed a violin from a friend and is trying to learn that now<br/>
&gt; &gt; too.  She also makes hemp necklaces and gardens and is &#39;wickedly<br/>
&gt; &gt; ironical&#39;.  She is the one who coined, &quot;Well of course more people died<br/>
&gt; &gt; than at Pearl Harbor, inflation you know.&quot;  She took the ACT (so she can<br/>
&gt; &gt; go to college) with three weeks notice and score a composite 24.  Pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; cool for a kid who has done practically nothing remotely resembling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;schoolwork&#39; for 6 years.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Jenni (allergic to milk) is the reader and the real voice of humor in <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; family.  She spouts deadpan humor so well I can&#39;t even duplicate it <br/>
&gt;here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  She also whipped through the entine Janet Evanovich seven book series <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; about a week and a half and two of the days were spent waiting for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; next book to show up.  She is 14 going on 35, can find a pun in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; haystack of needles.  Loves animals and little kids but does not want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be a veteranarian or a pediatrition because she just could not stand to<br/>
&gt; &gt; put them to sleep.  (There&#39;s that humor.)  She is also the one who can <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; found lyingon the picnic table next to her father at night watching the<br/>
&gt; &gt; sky.  I really don;t know what they are looking for but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell me when it arrives.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wyndham is the problem child.  He is 9 and has the potential to be a <br/>
&gt;very<br/>
&gt; &gt; troubled human being.  He is mildly OCD, allergic to everything and just<br/>
&gt; &gt; plain difficult.  All the same, the girls say I love him best.  I think <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just love them the amounts they need to be loved and he needs more.  He<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a mechanical marvel.  He likes to build things and take them apart.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He is learninghow to drive the tractor this week with the help of both <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt; husband and our exchange student.  He talks a lot.  Rachel once told him<br/>
&gt; &gt; that he is like the radio always on, so sometimes we forget to listen.<br/>
&gt; &gt; All in all, he is not a &#39;bad&#39; kid,  he just needs lots and lots of extra<br/>
&gt; &gt; attention to grow up.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We moved last summer from a busy city street to a busy country one.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; have 8 acres on a state route just south of Akron, Ohio.  Close enough <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the hospital and city but in a place that feels very rural.  It has <br/>
&gt;apple<br/>
&gt; &gt; trees, pear trees, cherry trees, grapes and raspberries all of which <br/>
&gt;were<br/>
&gt; &gt; cultivated then allowed to go wild for 15 years.  We are trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; reestablish the gardens and grape arbors but they are all so overrun, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a difficult and slow job.  We are dicussing clear cutting the arbor<br/>
&gt; &gt; because we are not making much progress separating the grapes from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; multiflora rose.  My herb garden is still in pots but I have hopes for<br/>
&gt; &gt; next spring.  My vegie garden produced tomatoes and zucchini this year,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and some peas for snacking on but they never made it into the house.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; also got some cute little mini watermelons about te size of baseballs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cute little things, and they tasted great.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We have plans for a pond and possible some more critters of the larger<br/>
&gt; &gt; variety.  We also have a trail through the wooded back half of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; property.  But what sold us on it was the fact that this property has <br/>
&gt;two<br/>
&gt; &gt; houses.  One for us and one for my mother.  We had been living two<br/>
&gt; &gt; counties away from each other and this is great.  We can help her when<br/>
&gt; &gt; she needs it but she still has her own place.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt;This is going to make you sick when you hear it:<br/>
&gt;I only froze two bags of berries.  I let the birds have the rest.<br/>
&gt;We also have lots of pears and apples coming out our ears.  Unfortunately<br/>
&gt;the apples have not seen any spray or pruning in 15 years and they are<br/>
&gt;very small and buggy.  We are hoping to get to them this year.<br/>

early.  Like when the cherries were ripe!  So, I&#39;ve been dealing with<br/>
apples since the beginning of July.  Most are too buggy to keep but they<br/>
still have to be raked up.  And I haven&#39;t decided about spraying yet but<br/>
we definitely have to gett he trees pruned.<br/>

&gt; Well, part of the problem was that the apples started comingin VERY<br/>
&gt; early.  Like when the cherries were ripe!  So, I&#39;ve been dealing with<br/>
&gt; apples since the beginning of July.  Most are too buggy to keep but they<br/>
&gt; still have to be raked up.  And I haven&#39;t decided about spraying yet but<br/>
&gt; we definitely have to gett he trees pruned.<br/>

&gt; &gt; WHAT??????? Now that is messed up!! Last year we had oodles of<br/>
&gt; &gt; berries and<br/>
&gt; &gt; canned them all, ate a few as well :) they must have decided to take<br/>
&gt; &gt; a year<br/>
&gt; &gt; off this year. We have never sprayed any of our trees, we dont use<br/>
&gt; &gt; any<br/>
&gt; &gt; insecticides or anything like that. This is the first year we have<br/>
&gt; &gt; had pears<br/>
&gt; &gt; and peaches. Our apple tree has been producing for about 3 years.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Seems like<br/>
&gt; &gt; our garden was in a funk this year as well! The corn fell over after<br/>
&gt; &gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; terrific storm, tomatoes didnt ripen as soon as they usually do. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; grew some<br/>
&gt; &gt; bok choy and it did great!<br/>
