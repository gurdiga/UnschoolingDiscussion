<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806931508">I&#39;ve already written to Diana/HaHaMommy for advice or help, but I thought <br/>
there might be people here with something immediately helpful or soothing.<br/>
<br/>
I just received this e-mail.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s an unschooling family or <br/>
not.  If anyone has anything I could forward to her, please let me know here or <br/>
on the side.  Thanks.<br/>

Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are a homeschooling family in WI.  Children are Sarah, 17;<br/>
<br/>
Noah, 13 (adopted from China at age 7 1/2 years); and Linnea, 12 <br/>
<br/>
(adopted from China, at age 9 years).  My husband was diagnosed<br/>
<br/>
three weeks ago with primary amyloidosis, a rare disease which<br/>
<br/>
isn&#39;t cancer, but acts like cancer.  Though he has just started<br/>
<br/>
massive chemo treatments, the doctor told him yesterday he believes<br/>
<br/>
Phil is dieing.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am losing my husband, our children are losing their father, and<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine life without him.  This is a nighmare I am unable<br/>
<br/>
to wake up from.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if there were any other homeschool families that<br/>
<br/>
have experienced this?  I can&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve read anything<br/>
<br/>
in HEM or not.  I know there are single parent homeschool families.  <br/>
<br/>
I just thought I&#39;d ask.  We&#39;re not having a good day here today.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.  -Janice Zindel, WI</div>
