<br/>
Boy does this sound familiar.  Zach (9) just yesterday had a toy double<br/>
barrel shotgun that he had enhanced.  He took the tube attachment off my<br/>
vacuum cleaner and taped it to the gun as a scope.  He then spent much of<br/>
the afternoon hunting deer in the back yard   :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-878287189">I have been missing two sets of vaccum cleaner tubes<br/>
in the last two years!  We also go to the hardware<br/>
store and he buys the piece that holds the toilet<br/>
paper on the toilet paper holder that and a big roll<br/>
of tape and my son is content the rest of the day.<br/>
