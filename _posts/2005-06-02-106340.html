&lt;&lt; From Marci Zinn:<br/>
A family member said, &quot;You are just doing this for yourself so you<br/>
won&#39;t have to buy the kids any school clothes.&quot;<br/>
Mike: Working 8+ hours a day for 12+ years just smacks of selfishness<br/>
if you ask me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not at all an answer unschoolers could give, but I was told by a friend who <br/>
was a preschool teacher, when Kirby was six, that I wasn&#39;t doing it for Kirby, <br/>
I was doing it for myself, that I  was just being selfish.  By that, in the <br/>
context I can no longer remember, it seemed she meant that Kirby should have no <br/>
choice about school, was too young to want to homeschool, hadn&#39;t been to <br/>
school so it wasn&#39;t fair for him to reject it, so it was MY decision, made <br/>
selfishly so I wouldn&#39;t have to go back to work (MAYBE that was her thought, as she <br/>
always whined about working as a teacher).  I had two younger kids, though.   I <br/>
wasn&#39;t fixin&#39; to go anywhere.  Her emotion when she made the accusation was <br/>
palpable, though.  She was full on indignantly angry, and already at the door, <br/>
leaving my house.<br/>
<br/>
I think it can be selfish, possibly.  Someone on AlwaysLearning was <br/>
describing the three kinds of homeschoolers in her area (Durham in NE England), and <br/>
after describing &quot;quality of education&quot; home educators and religous home <br/>
educators, she described a third group, and I&#39;d consider this somewhat selfish  (she <br/>
admits it&#39;s a generality and somewhat bitter, but I&#39;ve known some of these <br/>
familes from LLL, where it wasn&#39;t about the baby, it was about the mom&#39;s coolness <br/>
ratings):<br/>
<br/>
-=-The third type is the truly alternative type.  The people who are<br/>
<br/>
choosing to home-educate because it fits in with their lifestyle<br/>
<br/>
choices.  They have nutritionists and holistic therapists and are<br/>
<br/>
vegan, or wish they had the dedication to be, and insist that their<br/>
<br/>
children be vegan as well.  They have conversations about what kind of<br/>
<br/>
blood type diet they should be on. As parents the key educational<br/>
<br/>
lesson they seem to want to give is that sharing is the most important<br/>
<br/>
thing.  If any item is in question they will give it to someone not<br/>
<br/>
their child as it is more important that they teach their child to<br/>
<br/>
defer their own needs to someone else&#39;s than that they (the parent)<br/>
<br/>
take the time to help the other child or their own to come up with a<br/>
<br/>
compromise or some alternative play.  In my experience the children<br/>
<br/>
from these backgrounds are less socially adept, less sure of<br/>
<br/>
themselves.  If they get something that they really enjoy they hide it<br/>
<br/>
and fight for it and hope that the argument stays quiet enough that<br/>
<br/>
their parents don&#39;t notice and take away the coveted item.  There is<br/>
<br/>
egotism to this kind of home-education that the other two don&#39;t seem<br/>
<br/>
to have as much of, a sense that home-education was less about helping<br/>
<br/>
their child and more about adding to their alternative legitimacy,<br/>
<br/>
like a tattoo or a tongue stud or whatever.  -=-<br/>

I wonder how their school experience has been going and if he&#39;s changed his<br/>
mind at all.  But his kids were also way more outgoing than mine and that<br/>
makes life easier in school, so maybe it isn&#39;t so bad for them.  I am sure<br/>
they are super involved in lots of sports and things.<br/>

This attitude really ticks me off.  Would this same friend sacrifice his own<br/>
body to a lousy surgeon who needs more practice to improve his skills?<br/>
Would he move his family to the &#39;hood to be there for all of those other<br/>
unfortunate kids?  I doubt it.  While I do think it&#39;s important to help<br/>
others, I can&#39;t see doing that in direct contradiction of what&#39;s best for<br/>
your own family.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard this one from people.  The whole idea that if I&#39;m going to be an activist for my kids, I should advocate for everyone&#39;s kids.  My answer is that I do advocate for other people&#39;s kids -- I&#39;m more than happy to recommend parents pull their own kids out of school! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Seriously tho, the idea that I should spend my time and energy fighting a system that&#39;s not even designed to meet the needs of each child (political rhetoric aside) when I could instead enjoy a full, joyous life with my own kids is is nothing more than an attempt to &#39;guilt&#39; me back into the system.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762836897">Another argument I&#39;ve heard (and understand, honestly, from the teacher&#39;s  <br/>
point of view) is that homeschoolers are likely to take away the best and most  <br/>
interesting kids, lowering the average at school.<br/>
 <br/>
Well...<br/>
Often that is the case.<br/>
 <br/>
So? It&#39;s our duty to sacrifice our fascinating and interested kids to raise  <br/>
school&#39;s average?<br/>
It would be nice for the teachers if we would.  It&#39;s more fun for them  to <br/>
have some interesting kids who didn&#39;t really NEED to be dragged through step  by <br/>
step (not that anyone benefits or &quot;needs&quot; it, but from their point of view,  <br/>
being paid to drag kids through steps...)<br/>
 <br/>
Some of the best things I learned in school I learned from other kids who&#39;d  <br/>
had bigger lives or interesting homes or cool hobbies.  Since I had to go  to <br/>
school every day anyway, I made the best of it.  When kids moved in from  <br/>
other places I debriefed them until they couldn&#39;t stand it anymore about where  <br/>
they&#39;d been and what they&#39;d seen. &lt;g&gt;  Some could stand a lot, and I  milked <br/>
them for all the information about the outside world I could get, and  also told <br/>
them as much as they wanted to know about the local scene: history of  the <br/>
buildings, which teachers were how, all about the other kids they might want  to <br/>
know as far as I was aware.  I still managed to do my schoolwork, but I  was <br/>
then as I am now about &quot;I&#39;ll tell you all about my family; how&#39;s  yours?  How <br/>
does that make you feel?  What do you think you&#39;ll be  doing five years from <br/>
now?  Ten?  Why are you here and where might you  rather be?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So if homeschooling had been common, I might&#39;ve still been in school, but  <br/>
lots of those other kids wouldn&#39;t have been.  <br/>
 <br/>
This is not a recommendation for our feeling guilty at ALL, just an  <br/>
observation of why it would be dismaying to those who prize the diversity and  <br/>
richness of a broader student body.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard my cousins (and another aquaintance) say they wouldn&#39;t want <br/>
to homeschool because they feel it&#39;s important to support the public <br/>
schools and the teachers.<br/>
<br/>
My husband shared that comment with a co-worker (who has no kids), and <br/>
the co-worker said, &quot;Um, yeah, I support the public school because my <br/>
tax money goes there!&quot;<br/>

anymore. MOST of the people taking their kids out these days are those <br/>

trying to get an education for their kid through the school. They <br/>
always say, &quot;The school has just given up on him.&quot;<br/>
