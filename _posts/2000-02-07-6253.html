Before I go and ask for advice on reading workbooks on an unchooling list, I<br/>
will explain myself briefly.  I have the opportunity to receive free<br/>
curriculum materials through a local government funded homeschooling center.<br/>
So I am trying to figure out what to ask them to order for us.  There are<br/>
LOTS of things I would rather buy, but I think I have to generally stick to<br/>
curriculum type materials.  But they will order any style at all, no<br/>
questions asked!<br/>
<br/>
Back to my question.... has anyone had any experience with the &quot;Sullivan<br/>
Readers&quot;?  I hear they are excellent, but would very much like to hear from<br/>
anyone who has used them.<br/>
<br/>
And of course I am interested in hearing other suggestions for materials<br/>
that might qualify as &quot;curriculum&quot; but are still creative and/or interesting<br/>
for kids.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Ruth Heller books would be great.  They are awesome books, the<br/>
illustrations being an artwork worth studying, but the topics range from<br/>
Adverbs to Prepositions.  Up, Up and Away, A Cache of Jewels are just two of<br/>
the titles in the parts of speech series. She also has *coloring books* that<br/>
are tessellations and other patterns.  They are sometimes sold in the Dale<br/>
Seymour catalog. Seymour is a wonderful catalog of math products.  Their<br/>
posters on math and science are well worth the money.    (1-800-872-1100)<br/>
www.cuisenaire-dsp.com<br/>
<br/>
We also like the tapes published Standard Deviants. They have a video on<br/>
everything from Accounting to Zoology.   They are usually found in the<br/>
larger book stores and teacher stores.<br/>
<br/>
Software is another area you could spend money on.  Age of Empires and Age<br/>
of Kings are two programs that get LOTS of us around here.   Both are<br/>
civilization building games, the first one move through the Ice Age, Stone<br/>
Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age. The next one picks up with the first city-states<br/>
and Kingdoms; Rome, Egypt, and Mayan cultures--  My newly turned 10 year old<br/>
loves them.<br/>
<br/>
How old are you children, that might impact other specific choices.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if you are teaching beginning reading or not, I don&#39;t know the <br/>
readers you refer to.  When I taught my boys to read, I used the Learning <br/>
Language Arts Thru Literature series.  It is phonics based and great, the <br/>
series starts from day one and goes on thru upper levels.  The beginning kit <br/>
comes with readers, after that, I took the guys to the library and let them <br/>
pick their own books. Don&#39;t know it that helps, but that is what I did.<br/>

&gt;Hi Joshua,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are you talking about a charter school?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, It is not a charter school.  It is the public school district&#39;s answer<br/>
to homeschooling.  Actually I met with a fellow unchooler here in town<br/>
(Kelowna, B.C. Canada) today and got the full scoop on how it works and what<br/>
it is like.  It is called the McWilliam Center (Don&#39;t ask me why) and it is<br/>
operated by the school board.  Basically they employ 5 or 6 full time<br/>
teachers to be available to &quot;help&quot; with obtaining curriculum materials and<br/>
with &quot;teaching&quot;.  The school district recieves 4-5 thousand for each<br/>
home-schooling child registered with the McWilliam Center, and therefore<br/>
curriculum materials obtained through them are free.  Sounds great... or so<br/>
I thought!<br/>
But according to the friend I mentioned earlier, well.... It is not quite as<br/>
good as it sounds.  They didn&#39;t mentino to me that materials ordered have to<br/>
be returned within one year, and that you have to order everything through<br/>
them.... which can take up to 6 months!!  Also, she said they are still VERY<br/>
curriculum focused and can&#39;t understand unschooling at all.  So now I am<br/>
re-considering.... There are lots of other options here in B.C. I am going<br/>
to check them all out now before going ahead and registering anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, My boys are 5 and 7, very begining readers.  Whatever the case, I don&#39;t<br/>
plan to enforce &quot;teaching&quot; of reading... only to provide the materials so<br/>
that there is an avenue to learn if there is a matching desire.<br/>
<br/>
reagards, and thanks to all those that gave suggestions.... Joshua</div>

 </span></blockquote>Ah ha, thanks for the explanation, Joshua. I saw the &quot;ca&quot; in your addy and<br/>
was thinking California, where I am. This program sounds a lot like the<br/>
charter school distance learning programs we have here. They&#39;re very<br/>
popular, because of the money. Personally, I&#39;m not interested but I have<br/>
several friends who don&#39;t mind jumping through the hoops for the free books<br/>
and stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun with your reading. :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bought a couple of the Sonlight Teacher&#39;s Manuals this year, at a <br/>
Homeschool consignment store.  The suggestions are wonderful and give a <br/>
broad range of reading materials.  Read-alouds and Read-alones.<br/>
<br/>
We started with the Level 3 (American History), just because my kids love <br/>
the AMerican Girl Dolls and books.  Sonlight starts Am. History with the <br/>
Aztecs/Incas and Mayans, so we get a very thorough foundation.  The books <br/>
were easily found at the library, for the most part.  There are one or two <br/>
we will have to buy through Sonlight, because that is the only place we can <br/>
find them.  Even for us, as &quot;radical&quot; unschoolers, this is a very nice <br/>
program.  We spend time reading daily anyway, this just focuses our reading <br/>
into a cohesive &quot;unit&quot; so that they are absorbing a lot of information.  We <br/>
don&#39;t always follow the Teacher&#39;s Guide, but use it more as a reference for <br/>
good books on the subjects.  You could actually probably use their catalogue <br/>
as a reference too - it lists everything they recommend using for different <br/>
subjects.<br/>
