<div id="ygrps-yiv-62353807">hi again unschoolers!  i de-listed for the holiday season and have just read <br/>
a day or two of digests before this post to re-join!  i see that there is <br/>
another no-caps erin here!  hi!  i will be erin m., i guess!  hope alot of <br/>
familiar voices are still here, as well as some valuable new ones!<br/>
<br/>
i have just a couple of threads on my mind to start me back...<br/>
first, is anyone participating in their local competition of the <br/>
scripps-howard spelling bee later this month?  i am wondering how the <br/>
different areas are handling homeschoolers who participate, as i volunteered <br/>
to coordinate our local support group bee, not knowing that our &quot;region&quot; had <br/>
not much experience with homeschoolers participating (a single participant <br/>
here and there) and so we have been doing a lot of problem solving and <br/>
creative co-operating with the county, etc.<br/>
<br/>
also, (totally diff. subj.) can anyone speak to the neccessity of having a <br/>
child hold a writing utensil &quot;the correct way&quot; and why it is important (or <br/>
not?)  and whether it matters in what direction letters and numbers are <br/>
formed (bottom up instead of the customary top down on say, a &quot;L&quot;)?   i am <br/>
really feeling unqualified on the decision of whether to correct my dd in <br/>
these ways.  <br/>
<br/>
thanks for any input!!<br/>
erin m.</div>

Hi erin,<br/>
I&#39;m not an expert, but I would guess that the direction of the letters would <br/>
become more important when the child begins to write in cursive.  I think the <br/>
letters would join together better if they were written in the &quot;standard&quot; <br/>
direction.  As far as the pencil &quot;grip&quot;, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it.  <br/>
I have always held my pencil incorrectly (resting on my ring finger instead <br/>
of my middle finger), and have suffered no consequences other than mildly <br/>
sloppy handwriting.  I would concern myself more with how tightly the child <br/>
is holding the pencil.  I discovered that one of my sons holds his pencil in <br/>
a death grip - his little knuckles were turning white.  When he remembers to <br/>
loosen up a bit his writing is more legible and he enjoys writing more <br/>
because he doesn&#39;t get fatigued.  Again, I&#39;m only qualified to offer my <br/>
opinion - YMMV.<br/>

I think this is hysterical.  I just reponded to this post with almost exactly <br/>
the OPPOSITE answer.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we have to figure this stuff out for ourselves and see what works!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205164423">How one makes numbers is not of any import.  Forming of printed letters in<br/>
the &quot;correct&quot; way supposedly leads into being able to do cursive.  All of<br/>
the &quot;correctness&quot; of penmanship goes back to when beautiful penmanship was<br/>
the norm not the exception.  When there were competitions on penmanship,<br/>
etc.  It has since been found the in some cases it is better for the<br/>
individual to find their own comfort zone in holding pens and pencils, etc.<br/>
 It was suggested and seemed to make sense to me, that one should watch<br/>
when a child first starts printing to see if the way they hold the pencil<br/>
is causing them any hardships (making it harder for them to make certain<br/>
letters, etc.) and if not, then don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, having a houseful of lefties kinda throws most of the &quot;correct&quot;<br/>
theories out the window %-}<br/>

children would be expected to do it one way and one way only.  I love our <br/>
freedom to do it our own way.<br/>
