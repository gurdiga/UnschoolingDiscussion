<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179326993">Phonics for Beginners -- Another Reason to Homeschool<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you don¹t know Phonics, you can¹t read.<br/>
<br/>
If you don¹t know Phonics, you can¹t read this sentence or any other. You¹re<br/>
reading this, so you know Phonics. You might not have learned all (or even<br/>
many) of the rules, but still you know how reading happens -- you are making<br/>
sounds that correspond to the letters in print.<br/>
<br/>
First, terms:  LANGUAGE is what we speak (³lang² means tongue). Language is<br/>
the sounds that our speech makes. That¹s true even when we read silently --<br/>
we ³hear² the words in our heads. Language comes ³naturally² to children. In<br/>
our infancy, turning the sounds we hear into spoken sounds is a natural act<br/>
that does not need to be taught. So speaking is like walking in the sense of<br/>
being a natural skill. But reading and writing -- the two parts of literacy<br/>
-- are not natural acts or skills. They must be learned.<br/>
<br/>
There are two kinds of writing: PICTOGRAPHIC and PHONETIC. In pictographic<br/>
writing, ideas are represented by symbolic pictures or ³ideographs² as in<br/>
hieroglyphic pictographs. Learning a pictographic language, such as Chinese,<br/>
requires the memorization of the designs of a great many symbols in order to<br/>
communicate accurately, and even then, it can be problematic because the<br/>
pictographs represent ideas, not specific words. In phonetic languages,<br/>
letters and letter combinations represent the actual individual sounds of<br/>
the spoken language.  With phonetic languages such as English, Spanish, and<br/>
Hebrew, there are only a few sounds, and since letters represent those<br/>
sounds, words are communicated accurately, and therefore, meaning is precise<br/>
and clear.<br/>
<br/>
One reason why public schools are doing such a poor job is that they<br/>
abandoned the Phonics method of teaching reading about fifty years ago, in<br/>
favor of ³Whole Language.² Unfortunately for several generations of school<br/>
children, WL tries to teach reading as though it were a pictographic<br/>
language -- one that requires children to memorize words whole -- by their<br/>
design (³Look-Say²) -- not as a phonetic code that connects letters to<br/>
sounds (sounding out). Using repetition (as in Dick and Jane), Whole<br/>
Language depends on recognition of whole words by their looks, as though<br/>
they were ideographs.<br/>
<br/>
The result is confusion and reading problems: Children in public schools are<br/>
not  taught how to decode words by time-tested phonetics (Phonics), but are<br/>
forced to guess at new whole words (using pictures and context clues)<br/>
instead of sounding them out by using the letters. Whole Language does not<br/>
work because it leaves out the key to how our language works. Phonics is the<br/>
key.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, we¹ve read that a National Reading Panel has advocated a ³blend²<br/>
of Phonics and Whole Language. That smacks of politics since the two are not<br/>
blendable -- one teaches how to read and the other does not. Whole Language<br/>
advocates ³immersing² the child in ³literature,² and expects that to be<br/>
enough to inspire him/her to read. It¹s not -- it¹s merely therapy. Reading<br/>
requires skill and specific knowledge. Children need to learn how to convert<br/>
the marks on the page into specific sounds (sometimes called decoding); in<br/>
other words, they need Phonics in order to learn HOW to read. After that,<br/>
maybe ³immersion² can have some benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Phonics  (also known as Phonetics)<br/>
<br/>
Note: Phonetic writing is perhaps the greatest of man¹s inventions.  It<br/>
turned guesswork into precision communication. Its use began in about the<br/>
year  2000BC.<br/>
<br/>
English has 26 letters and 44 sounds. Simple. A child needs to learn the<br/>
letters, and their sounds both alone and in combinations. The few basic<br/>
concepts contain almost all of what a child needs in order to read easily<br/>
and well. During their first years, children have listened to speech and so<br/>
they have what is called ³phonemic awareness² -- they know the sounds of the<br/>
language -- and begin to imitate them in order to get what they need and<br/>
want -- usually MAMA!  But decoding a page of printed words does not come<br/>
naturally. The individual marks on the page need to be learned for what they<br/>
represent: The different sounds of the language. That needs to be learned,<br/>
although not necessarily taught, a little at a time. So how can we parents<br/>
help?<br/>
<br/>
When your child is curious (and wants help in learning to read), begin with<br/>
single letters (try magnetized letters on the refrigerator door) and say<br/>
their names and the sounds associated with each, such as A-a (short vowel<br/>
sound as in Am and At) and E (as in Egg, and set) and I (In or It); Up, hOt,<br/>
etc.  Next step,   BAG or CAT, then start changing one letter at a time:<br/>
BAG-BAD-BAT-CAT-CUT-COT-HOT-HAT-HIT-SIT-SET-LET, etc. One book comes to mind<br/>
as a good primer for reading phonetically: Cat in the Hat, by Dr. Seuss.<br/>
<br/>
Play with words and letters as long as it¹s enjoyable for you and your<br/>
child. When it¹s not interesting, let it go. There¹s no hurry. Some children<br/>
become interested in reading when they¹re 3 or 4, some when they¹re 10 or<br/>
12. By the time they¹re 16, no one can tell who learned first. Forcing or<br/>
coercing can lead to reading problems.<br/>
<br/>
Once you notice that the child gets the idea that letters represent<br/>
individual sounds (r-a-t), you¹ve done your job. The child needs to be able<br/>
to decode  words independently, not to have someone give the pronunciation<br/>
for all words, or rely on pictures as clues. You will probably be surprised<br/>
how quickly they get it, and once that happens, the rest of the rules --<br/>
those for long vowel sounds (such as the final e, changing rat to rate), and<br/>
various combinations of letters -- get easier to learn and use.<br/>
  <br/>
Despite what many school teachers want us to believe, English is a very<br/>
regular language and reading can be learned quickly, easily and painlessly.<br/>
Of course there are weird exceptions that need to be learned individually,<br/>
but mostly it follows a very few, simple rules. Stick with what¹s regular<br/>
and try not to dwell on the exceptions during the early stages.</div>

<br/>
First the article is hard to read because there are imbedded things showing <br/>
up as numbers, and the quotes and apostrophes are numbers too.  <br/>
<br/>
And second, in my experience what you have written is not the simple truth <br/>
you make it out to be.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; That smacks of politics since the two are not<br/>
<br/>
blendable -- one teaches how to read and the other does not. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t even make sense.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you don1t know Phonics, you can1t read this sentence or any other. You1re<br/>
<br/>
reading this, so you know Phonics. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
If this is true then people can learn phonics without being taught, because <br/>
all three of my kids would be able to read it without hesitation, and none of <br/>
them have ever been &quot;taught phonics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I learned to read by look-say (not whole language, but programmed <br/>
incremental look-say).  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But reading and writing -- the two parts of literacy<br/>
<br/>
-- are not natural acts or skills. They must be learned.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but learning is natural and they can be learned naturally.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;One reason why public schools are doing such a poor job is that they<br/>
<br/>
abandoned the Phonics method of teaching reading about fifty years ago,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is not true.  Phonics has not been abandoned for fifty years.  SOME <br/>
school districts and some reading-method manufacturers have moved away from <br/>
phonics, but it has always been there, and many districts flip-flopped from <br/>
purchase to purchase (five year cycles or however often they decided on <br/>
textbooks).  <br/>
<br/>
If phonicst abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
A hundred and fifty years ago in one-room schoolhouses with teenaged girls as <br/>
teachers, they were teaching by rote.  And rote is recitation and <br/>
memorization and doesn&#39;t involve a bunch of phonetic analysis and markings.  <br/>
At one time phonics was new, right?  When?  That might be worth looking at, <br/>
Ned, to make you feel better and to help you clarify what you want to tell <br/>
people.  To simply say fifty years ago something was abandoned is <br/>
problematical.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Phonics  (also known as Phonetics)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Phonetics and phonics are not the same term nor the same field of inquiry.<br/>
They&#39;re from the same word root, and they&#39;re related, but they&#39;re not the <br/>
same.  <br/>
It would be a bit like saying &quot;intro to auto mechanics (also known as <br/>
mechanical engineering).&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Despite what many school teachers want us to believe, English is a very<br/>
<br/>
regular language and reading can be learned quickly, easily and painlessly.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
English is probably the most irregular language on the planet because <br/>
spelling was codified before some sound-shifts took place, we have words from <br/>
four different languages making up the bulk of everyday terms, and from <br/>
dozens of other languages too.  Latin and Norman French have some <br/>
similarities as to pronunciation of phonemes, but the Germanic Anglo Saxon <br/>
(or most common and easiest phonetic words) and Greek are very different.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Of course there are weird exceptions that need to be learned individually,<br/>
<br/>
but mostly it follows a very few, simple rules.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The reason it follows a few simple rules is that the bulk of short, easy <br/>
words are Anglo-Saxon words.  The sentence just before this--probably only <br/>
&quot;reason&quot; is from French/Latin, and the rest is Saxon.  (&quot;Simple&quot; is probably <br/>
French too, but it&#39;s been in English for 800 years or so.)<br/>
<br/>
I agree too that it&#39;s easy for kids to learn to read.  But I don&#39;t agree that <br/>
they have to &quot;learn phonics&quot; first.  Reading is much more complex than a <br/>
simple code to break, and yet people are so brilliantly smart that they can, <br/>
on their own, develop a way to do a very complex thing.  Not all people learn <br/>
the same way, nor decode the same way.  There are LOTS of everyday Saxon <br/>
words which do not follow phonetic rules.  Most do.  But phonics won&#39;t help <br/>
with the whole set of through, tough, trough, brought kinds of things which <br/>
once were pronounced with a throat hoik (fricative glottal stop?  What&#39;s the <br/>
name for that, any descriptive linguists in the house?) which is why the <br/>
sound is there, but which are kept that way with that spelling because <br/>
millions of English speakers are reading visually.<br/>
<br/>
Ned, there are new homeschoolers on this list whose kids can&#39;t read yet, and <br/>
the information you&#39;ve just sent the list is more about your opinion of <br/>
schools than about how reading works.  You seem obsessed with politics and <br/>
the satanic nature of whole language. <br/>
<br/>
There are people here with several reading children, there are people here <br/>
who have taught school, taught reading, read or done research on learning <br/>
theory and cognition.<br/>
<br/>
If you share what your family does and believes that&#39;s great.  But when you <br/>
word it in such a way that it speaks for all schools and all readers of <br/>
English, you move out of a defensible and helpful stance.<br/>
<br/>
Holly just asked how to spell &quot;once.&quot;  I told her.  And I asked &quot;Do you see <br/>
the &quot;one&quot; in there?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Once&quot; is a visual word.  It has a history.  It&#39;s based on the word &quot;one.&quot;  <br/>
But neither &quot;one&quot; nor &quot;once&quot; starts with a &quot;w.&quot;  We could talk about why that <br/>
is, or we could just accept that every reader of English reads that visually. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still sitting next to me, and asked how to spell &quot;flower/flour&quot; (I <br/>
didn&#39;t know which and I asked which kind).  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;Who&#39; is w-h-o, right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Who&quot; doesn&#39;t start with an h, and &quot;One&quot; doesn&#39;t start with a &quot;w&quot; and both of <br/>
them are native English (Anglo-Saxon) words.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do you spell... [since/cents/sense]?&quot; Holly just asked.  And now we need <br/>
to discuss that.  gotta go.<br/>

<br/>
Ned, have you ever had the privilege or misfortune of teaching school?  If <br/>
you have not, and if you haven&#39;t studied education, I wish you would lighten <br/>
up on these kinds of statements about teachers (&quot;Despite what many school <br/>
teachers want us to believe...&quot;).  And if the history of English isn&#39;t one of <br/>
your favorite hobbies, ditto about the summary statements about English.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you CAN read using techniques in addition to phonics. And phonics may <br/>
not have been the first step in the reading process. Sounding out words can <br/>
be a small part of an even bigger reading process. In fact, it has to be. I <br/>
know I don&#39;t sit there sounding out each and every word I read.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Language comes �naturally� to children. In our infancy, turning the sounds <br/>
&gt;&gt;we hear into spoken sounds is a natural act that does not need to be <br/>

&gt;&gt;But reading and writing -- the two parts of literacy<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-- are not natural acts or skills. They must be learned.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They must be LEARNED, but not ncessarily taught. Like walking and talking, I <br/>
believe reading and writing come naturally once a child&#39;s brain and body is <br/>
physically ready to learn them. And like the language they hear every day, <br/>
most children in this day and age are surrounded by the printed word. They <br/>
are immersed in it and its uses and naturally want to mimic and learn what <br/>
they see the adults doing. We don&#39;t sit the down to teach them to talk, and <br/>
I don&#39;t believe we need to sit them down for reading/writing lessons either. <br/>
It&#39;s a part of the day and a part of their lives. They learn it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Unfortunately for several generations of school children, WL tries to <br/>
&gt;&gt;teach reading as though it were a pictographic language&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whole Language and Look-Say are two different methods. I thought Pam gave a <br/>
very good description of a Whole Language classroom. My son Conor was in a <br/>
WL classroom and I thought it was great. Where the schools were failing was <br/>
in insisting kids were &quot;behind&quot; if they didn&#39;t read on the school&#39;s <br/>
timetable. (Well, that&#39;s one place the schools were failing anyway. ;-)) And <br/>
yes, there were plenty of phonics games and sheets and puzzles and <br/>
activities in his classroom.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Whole Language advocates �immersing� the child in �literature,� and <br/>
&gt;&gt;expects that to be enough to inspire him/her to read.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahhh...it worked for my kids. Harry Potter was the final ticket for Conor. <br/>
He wanted to read it so badly and I just wasn&#39;t going fast enough. After <br/>
years of being labelled as learning disabled, he finished the first book in <br/>
a day at age 9. He was ready. Casey was inspired by The Magic Treehouse <br/>
Books. Those were the ones she just had to read for herself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Play with words and letters as long as it�s enjoyable for you and your <br/>
&gt;&gt;child. When it�s not interesting, let it go. There�s no hurry.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I certainly agree with this. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Once you notice that the child gets the idea that letters represent<br/>

to decode  words independently, not to have someone give the pronunciation <br/>
for all words, or rely on pictures as clues.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No way! My &quot;job&quot; is NOT over when they can sound out rat. I am there to <br/>
answer questions, give them pronounciations or even entire words or phrases. <br/>
I will still read to them for as long as they still enjoy it. I will <br/>
continue to fill their world with literature beyond their current reading <br/>
comprehension and I will read it with them or to them as they prefer. <br/>
Reading is so much more than decoding!!<br/>
<br/>
Was this an old article Ned? Lots of us here have given you examples from <br/>
our own children&#39;s lives where phonics was NOT the answer. I&#39;m surprised <br/>
that you seem to be disbelieving our real life observations.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853771189">It&#39;s bad enough to try to interpret English from the written word, but then <br/>
there&#39;s translating the sounds BACK into the mish-mosh of a system.<br/>
<br/>
Here are two real-life notes from the past week.  Holly&#39;s was in all caps, <br/>
Kirby&#39;s had upper and lower case appropriately used:<br/>
<br/>
VA HUSPEDEL WILL CALL DAD TO REE SKEGUEL MRI<br/>
<br/>
Whent to <br/>
hang out <br/>
with Andrew <br/>
and Matt<br/>
            Kirby<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Neither of them has been &quot;taught to spell,&quot; they&#39;re both just picking it up.  <br/>
<br/>
I showed Holly that schedule started &quot;sch&quot; and she said &quot;like school!&quot;  So <br/>
she knew that.  And she told me about seeing school spelled with a &quot;k&quot; on <br/>
Invader Zim and knowing it was wrong there for the comic effect.<br/>

is going to call Dad to reschedule his MRI.&#39; I found a similar message on our <br/>
fridge last week, &quot;A Ldy frum the Va colld she sad the gren teme daktr wil <br/>
sea dad thrsda at 3 and not to forgt to brng his idcrd if he had eny qwestens <br/>
he can coll the va and ask to spek to the gren teme reseptinst.&quot; <br/>
What pleased me was that she answered the phone politely, took a message, <br/>
wrote as neatly and clearly as she could and left it where we could find it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s really interesting to see how kids hear the words they want to spell, <br/>
like va for the. (Oops, I just read another post that read that word as VA <br/>
hospital.)  Also the way they notice the the w sound is sometimes written <br/>
wh, and then they use it all the time for a while.  There&#39;s one word (which <br/>
I can&#39;t remember now) that Lars always writes with an extra sound or <br/>
two.  When I listened carefully, I realized that he was saying it that way <br/>
as well.  So of course he added the extra sounds when writing it.  I kind <br/>
of thought that his spelling was so phonetic (and wrong) because I pushed <br/>
phonetics on him, but your kids spell much the same way as he does without <br/>
the phonics instruction.<br/>

&quot;shopping.&quot; She then proudly spelled &quot;s-e-a-p-p-i-n-g.&quot; Her brother&#39;s name<br/>

learned. I explained about Irish names and off we went to &quot;seap.&quot;<br/>
