<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307128433">I&#39;m three or four days behind on my email, sorry this is late. I wanted to<br/>
respond to a few things before I get even further behind!<br/>

<br/>
&gt;&gt;Hi Hikaru,<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Where did you learn Japanese?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually majored in Japanese at a certain prestigious university on the<br/>
East Coast and studied for a year in an intensive program at a prestigious<br/>
university in Tokyo and guess what? Most of what I have learned of  Japanese<br/>
language and culture is IN SPITE OF what they taught me in class....I<br/>
learned through daily contact with Japanese people, and through my own<br/>
efforts..... gee does that sound like unschooling, perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
I have a Masters in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages,<br/>
the politically correct term for ESL or EFL) and my theory about learning<br/>
languages is that anyone can do it, but like any skill it will come easier<br/>
for some people than for others.<br/>
Japanese isn&#39;t a hard language to learn, and I LOVE to tell Japanese people<br/>
that I think English is harder, speaking as someone who has taught English<br/>
to non-native speakers for<br/>
about 15 years. Japanese jaws tend to drop, because it seems to be a matter<br/>
of pride that the language is so unique and hard to master. IMO every<br/>
language and every culture is unique.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I enjoy reading about history, but there is a lot I still don&#39;t know.  I<br/>
&gt; was actually startled to read in an article about Trent Lott that when<br/>
&gt; Strom Thurmond was running for prez, 1948, NO African-Americans in<br/>
&gt; Lott&#39;s state of Mississippi were allowed to vote.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I always thought that slavery was never legal in Canada.  Doing a column<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Living in Japan as someone who is immediately,  obviously not Japanese, I&#39;ve<br/>
become a bit more aware of how it feels to be a minority. It&#39;s been a really<br/>
good (and humbling) experience. As for racism, that&#39;s a subject I address in<br/>
one of my college classes.<br/>
We read an interview with Rosa Parks, and<br/>
it is very interesting how willing the students are to discuss the Civil<br/>
Rights movenent in the U.S., but are not so comfortable talking about<br/>
discrimination against Korean, Chinese, and Ainu residents in Japan. Hits a<br/>
bit too close to home, I think. Although I did have one student &quot;come out&quot;<br/>
as Korean. That was a very brave young woman. I was really proud of her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Betsy wrote:<br/>
&gt;&gt;Overall, our culture (in the US) has what feels to me like a nasty,<br/>
&gt;schoolmarmish, red-pencil-wielding tone about not knowing the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;stuff at the &quot;right time&quot;.  There are certain &quot;important&quot; things that<br/>
&gt;&gt;we&#39;re all supposed to learn the day before the test.  Learning anything<br/>
&gt;&gt;after the test doesn&#39;t count as learning.  Those red marks pointing out<br/>
&gt;&gt;ignorance don&#39;t go away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was very good for me to hear, thank you Betsy. I deal with this all the<br/>
time. The Japanese education system is mainly geared toward entrance<br/>
examinations and I forget that the U.S. too is overly focused on testing and<br/>
error correction, and sets too many students up for failure.<br/>

Hikaru, about to go make raisin cookies with my son<br/>
Ah the joys of flour all over the kitchen, can&#39;t wait!</div>
