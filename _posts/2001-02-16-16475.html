<br/>
I was the only one home, and I&#39;m sick, so I sat down to peel kindling and <br/>
watch TV, not knowing what was on.  I watched NBC, a couple of very lame <br/>
sitcoms and then E.R., which I had never ever seen before.  It seemed to be <br/>
AMA propaganda.  Doctors were always right, patients were idiots.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping it wasn&#39;t typical of all their programs, but I&#39;ll try not to watch <br/>
it anymore anyway.<br/>
