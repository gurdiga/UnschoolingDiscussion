<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344675155">Dh and I are having an ongoing conflict about Jayn(4.5) chewing the inside<br/>
of her cheek, and biting her finger and toenails. His response is to mention<br/>
it to her pretty much whenever he notices her doing it, which I think is<br/>
counterproductive � he is not saying �don�t do it� or being angry, but is<br/>
clearly disapproving when he says �Are you chewing your �..�. Mine is to say<br/>
let�s reduce the stress in her life as much as possible, and have tried<br/>
suggesting that he shouldn�t be saying anything to her. Oops.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The conflict between us has escalated since he thinks I am �ignoring a<br/>
serious health issue� and �putting my head in the sand� and �shouldn�t be<br/>
giving him shit about saying anything to Jayn�. I think these are three<br/>
different ideas but he is rolling them into one big speech. (Did I mention<br/>
he gets very angry if anyone interrupts him while he is speaking, so there<br/>
is no addressing each point as it comes up. Nor does he accept me wanting to<br/>
walk away from an argument, even if it so I can cool off.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think he is exaggerating the �problem� and that other people�s experiences<br/>
with this kind of thing have shown me that the absent minded chewing simply<br/>
migrates to something else �compulsive� seeming, like chewing hair or<br/>
clothes. I have agreed that we should try to look for triggers and<br/>
stressors, and reduce those. He doesn�t see anything he might be doing or<br/>
saying as a stressor. I think us fighting about it is probably a big one.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In terms of the health issue, over a year ago Jayn got a slightly ingrown<br/>
(big)toenail on each foot and they got infected. We simply treated them with<br/>
Neosporin and band-aids, and suggested to Jayn the connection between<br/>
chewing and infections. No other infections since. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I should add that dh chews his cheeks and claims to have �always� done so. I<br/>
used to bite my nails, but now only do so if one of them is cracked and<br/>
catching on stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I�m about to Google nail biting.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts, either on the nail biting, or ways of ending the conflict? I�m<br/>
sure I am missing something really obvious. <br/>

I have no experience in this, but was wondering something.  Have you discussed with your husband how he would feel if you made a comment to him every time you caught him chewing his cheek.  If it is something that he has always done, and it appears that it did not escalate into any other obsessive behavior, why does he think that it will happen with Jayn?  I don&#39;t know if this will help, but may be areas of discussion between you two.<br/>
 <br/>
As for the nail problem, let me know if you find anything.  My 6yo son does not bite, but picks his nails.  Has done so on several occasions to the point of them bleeding.  I have treated them and informed him that if he would let me clip them, it would not happen.  But he still picks.  Does not bother me, as it is one more thing that he can do for himself.  It is just annoying to be scratched my raggedy toes and fingers.  OUCH!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-313611982">My four year old went through a spell of really intense nail biting, even<br/>
making her fingers bleed, and this upset me alot.  I would verbally stop her<br/>
many times during the day, and she took to hiding to do it.  And she would<br/>
do it at night.  Also, she sometimes seemed to be doing it to get my<br/>
attention.  Then, one day in the car, I looked in the rear view mirror and<br/>
saw her biting her nails.  She saw me &quot;see&quot; her.  For some reason, I decided<br/>
to do nothing.  I didn&#39;t say a word, but went back to driving along and<br/>
humming the song I was humming.  Well, this was just too much for her!  She<br/>
started doing it more vigorously when she saw me glance back at her.  Then<br/>
she said, &quot;Mommy, didn&#39;t you see me biting my nails?&quot;  I said, &quot;MmmHmmm...I<br/>
did.&quot; Really matter of factly.  Then, she said, &quot;Mommy, I&#39;m biting them<br/>
alot.&quot;  I said, &quot;Oh.&quot;   She said, &quot;But Mommy, I&#39;m REALLY biting them REALLY<br/>
short!&quot;  I said, &quot;I believe you.&quot;  So she says, &quot;But Mommy, why aren&#39;t you<br/>
worried about it?&quot;  And I don&#39;t know where I came up with this, but from<br/>
somewhere deep inside I decided to let her choose to chew her nails.  She<br/>
already heard my countless lectures and stories about my brother&#39;s really<br/>
ugly fingernails, because he bit his nails so much as a kid and young man.<br/>
She had all the information, and it was clearly not something I could<br/>
control...nor did I want to anymore.  I said to her, &quot;Honey, you already<br/>
know how I feel about your nail biting.  It bothers me to see your pretty<br/>
hands all chewed up, and I have been worrying about all sorts of things that<br/>
could happen because of it.  I don&#39;t think that saying anything more about<br/>
it will help.  Besides, those are your fingers and they are on your body.<br/>
I&#39;ve told you what I know about it and why I don&#39;t bite my nails, but you<br/>
have to decide what you are going to do.  I&#39;m not going to bother you about<br/>
it anymore.&quot;  She didn&#39;t say a thing, but I could see the wheels turning in<br/>
her head.  She was in control.  And, I didn&#39;t even bother to hope that she<br/>
would stop.  I just quit trying to make her stop and I quit worrying that I<br/>
was somehow a bad parent because she was chewing her nails up.   But a few<br/>
days later I noticed her hands and her nails had obviously not been chewed<br/>
in awhile.  I didn&#39;t say anything and later that day, she said, &quot;Hey Mommy!<br/>
I haven&#39;t been biting my nails!  I guess since you haven&#39;t been saying<br/>
anything to me, I forgot about doing it!&quot;  She was so pleased with herself.<br/>
She hasn&#39;t chewed them since.<br/>
<br/>
This was just my experience, but I hope it might help you!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Andrea</div>

My son had a pretty heavy duty shirt chewing habit.  It was long enough ago that I don&#39;t remember when it happened and when it finally vanished, but it did finally vanish.  (Five or Six?)<br/>
<br/>
I was a hair chewer, which bothered my dad.  So one day he just imposed a haircut on me.  (I&#39;m not recommending this.)<br/>
<br/>
What you are saying about stress is what I think I&#39;ve read in parenting magazines.  Could you maybe find a website that has this advice and show it to your husband?<br/>

magazines.  Could you maybe find a website that has this advice and show it<br/>
to your husband?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I Googled and found many gentle parenting and medical sites that were<br/>
basically recommending not getting too worried and expressing the normalcy<br/>
of this behavior, and a couple of other sites that recommended putting bad<br/>
tasting stuff on her hands, which I will not do. I have forwarded a couple<br/>
of the former to dh. <br/>
<br/>
I am also reassured because the level of Jayn&#39;s chewing is relatively<br/>
slight. She is not chewing to the quick or causing bleeding. In fact I<br/>
looked at her hands tonight and a couple of her fingers actually had slivers<br/>
of white showing. I think she is mostly biting off loose skin from around<br/>
her toes - which is heightened by swimming every day.<br/>
<br/>
One funny (at least to me) thing is that one of the less kind websites was<br/>
saying how awful it would be if you were still biting your nails at the age<br/>
of 35 (the nip-it-in-the-bud school of parenting), while one of the medical<br/>
based &quot;reassuring&quot; websites said that most adults who bite their nails<br/>
usually stop at around age (you guessed it) - 35. <br/>

MY oldest son became a serious shirt chewer at 5.  He had never before<br/>
chewed or sucked on anything, besides me (;-0).  I was so worried that he<br/>
must have obviously been severely stressed by something.  We tried to reduce<br/>
the stress in his life while at the same time reminding him gently to stop<br/>
the chewing.  The whole front of his shirt would get wet and then crusty; it<br/>
was pretty gross.  Finally one day when I was brushing his teeth for him I<br/>
realized that his 6 year molars were halfway through!  As soon as they<br/>
finished coming in, the chewing stopped.  It recently started again, at 11. <br/>
<br/>
It may not be related to teething, but it&#39;s something to consider.<br/>

<br/>
Let it go.  Tell him she will bite her nails anyway, but she&#39;ll get sneaky.   <br/>
Nail biting is usually outgrown.  Sneaky can last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll bite her nails anyway, until she outgrows it, but she&#39;ll feel bad, and <br/>
unloved, instead of neutral-to-positive.<br/>
<br/>
THAT, feeling bad, is worse for digestion than bits of fingernail, and <br/>
anyway, doesn&#39;t she spit out the parts or throw them in the trash?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s feeling the need to be more in control of his own life and that&#39;s <br/>
projecting out, oozing out, to controlling the teensy details of hers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he used to bite his nails and hardly remembers and started biting his <br/>
cheek instead after he got in trouble?<br/>
<br/>
Holly used to bite hers and she stopped.  It took a few months from the time <br/>
she decided to stop until she didn&#39;t do it anymore.  She paints her nails now, <br/>
and she&#39;s always aware of other people&#39;s.  She noticed mine were long <br/>
yesterday, and then I broke one helping them unload the trailer after their campout <br/>
(I stayed, it was fun to have the house alone).  She&#39;s not stressed about it.  <br/>
She knows she&#39;s got nails because she wanted them, not because we made her or <br/>
because she was trying to &quot;be a good girl,&quot; so I think that&#39;s another phase to <br/>
aim for.  Let them be HER nails, not her dad&#39;s or yours.   If he rags on her, <br/>
she might chew her nails to spite him.  That&#39;s a little too much blending of <br/>
territories.<br/>

there were his gigantic hands, holding the ring in close-up, filling the whole <br/>
screen.  He wasn&#39;t embarrassed at all.  He just bites his nails.  He accepts that <br/>
about himself.  Lots of people bite their nails.  And under the circumstances <br/>
of a hobbit undertaking that huge job, I think it should&#39;ve been an actor who <br/>
bit his nails.  I&#39;d bite my nails, if I had to save the world like that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

college when I discovered nail files.  Seems I was biting my nails to <br/>

chipped.  I will bite it until I finally get up and get a nail file <br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m probably really late to this discussion, but I bit my nails until <br/>
<br/>
college when I discovered nail files.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought of writing &quot;get him some emery boards.&quot;   <br/>
I think a good assortment of real steel nail files and several grades of <br/>
emery boards are good for anyone to have, but much nail-biting could be averted <br/>
(or not go so deep) if the sharp parts could just be controlled.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686182582">Thanks to everyone for the pretty much unanimous response to help James feel<br/>
better about Jayn&#39;s nail biting (since I was already ok about it). I have<br/>
forwarded several representative emails to him to look at.<br/>
<br/>
I realized that I have been doing a lot of posting over the last several<br/>
months on both this list and Basics. Some of these posts have been almost<br/>
essays. The thoughts have been both a record of, and instrumental in, my own<br/>
spiritual growth as an Unschooling parent. Everyone in our little world has<br/>
had the opportunity to see these posts, with the exception of poor James!<br/>
So, inspired to do so by the discussion here about email communications, I<br/>
forwarded a bunch of these things to him last night.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I was awoken by James sitting by me on my side of the bed, very<br/>
enthused and affected by what he had just read, and determined to work even<br/>
harder himself to live by Principles and release his desire to control. He<br/>
also gained a new understanding of why sometimes I seem to spend a long time<br/>
on my lists! It was really great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511700948">(Did I mention<br/>
he gets very angry if anyone interrupts him while he<br/>
is speaking, so there<br/>
is no addressing each point as it comes up. Nor does<br/>
he accept me wanting to<br/>
walk away from an argument, even if it so I can cool<br/>
off.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Robyn, I just wanted to tell you that I am like your<br/>
husband, and you are like my husband, in that regard. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He needs to get it all out, together, because they are<br/>
all interconnected in his mind, if he IS anything like<br/>
me, that is.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a whole thought, and interrupting him may make<br/>
him feel like you&#39;re not open to listening to his<br/>
ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, beware that if you think responding to him using<br/>
pure logic is going to change his mind, think again! <br/>
lol <br/>
<br/>
And if the very foundation of what he is saying, is<br/>
really wrong, he&#39;s going to be angry at first when he<br/>
finds out!  <br/>
<br/>
Try to attempt, if you really want to do something, to<br/>
give him an entirly different way of looking at this<br/>
situation, without connecting it to him being wrong<br/>
(which, again, if he&#39;s anything like me, will cause<br/>
him to be purely defensive, and not listen to a word<br/>
you say!).  <br/>
<br/>
If what you are saying really does make sense to him,<br/>
eventually, he&#39;ll go back to what he believes and see<br/>
the error of his ways, himself.  <br/>
<br/>
If my pov has helped you at all, and you want to talk<br/>
about this some more, feel free to email me offlist. <br/>

before I&#39;m finished. I have to say the whole thing, sometimes, in order <br/>

you thought was wrong, is justified in something I&#39;m about to say, but <br/>
you (whomever) interrupt before I get to explain it. Why not listen to <br/>

head - before saying, &quot;Okay, I understand your reasoning and I want to <br/>
talk more about that first thing you said because your conclusions seem <br/>
to me to result from that.&quot; Your answer is that listening through the <br/>
rest of what I say is a waste of time if the first assumption was <br/>
wrong. But what comes across to ME is you not listening to me, not <br/>
being willing to listen, that you&#39;re jumping on the very first thing I <br/>
say as being wrong and then, at best, just barely tolerating me <br/>
continuing. It would make me a lot happier if you&#39;d listen with an <br/>
open-mind, suspend disbelief about that first thing for as long as it <br/>
takes me to make my case. I mean, is your time so precious that you <br/>
can&#39;t waste it listening to me go off on what MIGHT (if you&#39;re right <br/>
and I&#39;m wrong) be a tangent for a few minutes? Do we have to discuss <br/>
things YOUR way - agreeing on just one statement at a time and not <br/>
going on until we&#39;ve agreed? Are we in this relationship together in <br/>
order to have the most &quot;efficient&quot; discussions? Isn&#39;t it more important <br/>

This sounds like excellent advice, but I am not sure I could implement <br/>

Pam, you are right, and often if I can manage to hold on, he will come back<br/>
around to a whole different way of looking in the course of the lecture.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with metaphors or analogies is that sometimes they aren&#39;t<br/>
accurate.<br/>
<br/>
In the metaphor I wrote he says &quot;The sky is red&quot;, but what is actually much<br/>
harder is when he is saying something like:<br/>
&quot;You think that I...&quot;<br/>
&quot;You said that .....&quot;<br/>
&quot;I thought you were going to....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
...all of which sound like unjust accusations to me when I don&#39;t think they<br/>
are true. In those cases it is really hard not to bite at once and say &quot;No I<br/>
don&#39;t&quot; etc. It is hard to stand still for a long critical diatribe, when<br/>
saying &quot;No I didn&#39;t&quot; should just stop it. Except it doesn&#39;t. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oy, ok, I&#39;ll try.  How about I use a real example.  <br/>
<br/>
This happened the other day.<br/>
<br/>
I tell my husband that I&#39;m mad that he didn&#39;t tell me<br/>
something ( he fixed the front brakes, not the back. I<br/>
assumed he meant all of them, because that is what we<br/>
discussed doing, before he had them fixed.  Why is<br/>
that something he didn&#39;t tell me? ARGH.)   <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll tell me I shouldn&#39;t be mad, because he didn&#39;t<br/>
mean to not tell me, didn&#39;t know that I didn&#39;t know,<br/>
etc. <br/>
<br/>
If he would just accept the fact that I was mad, and<br/>
acknowledge that, I wouldn&#39;t be angry anymore.  But,<br/>
no, he has to tell me what I should and shouldn&#39;t do,<br/>
I shouldn&#39;t be angry, and even tho I know he&#39;s right,<br/>
that what he is saying is entirely logical, makes<br/>
sense, I still get defensive.  <br/>
<br/>
I need the process, and he needs the issue to be over<br/>
already.  So, he goes straight to the end of the line,<br/>
and doesn&#39;t realize, I have a hard time doing that!<br/>
<br/>
(this is a classic) <br/>
<br/>
 I talk to him about a problem I have.  Ok, right<br/>
away, he&#39;s giving me a solution to my problem.  And I<br/>
would&#39;ve gotten there, eventually, what I needed to do<br/>
was talk to him about it, until I got there myself. <br/>
But when he does it for me, I can&#39;t go thru the<br/>
process myself, and learn on the way.  If there was<br/>
understanding there, for myself, I just missed it! <br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
This is pertinent to unschooling, btw.  Do you give<br/>
your kid the answer, yah, sometimes, and sometimes<br/>
that&#39;s enough for me too, but sometimes, the best<br/>
thing for the kid to do is get to the answer via their<br/>
own process.  <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t ignore what you&#39;re kid needs, aka the<br/>
process, why is it ok to do it to adults?  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the only solution I have now is to be clear<br/>
with him what I need.  If it&#39;s process, I warn him!<br/>
lol If he can&#39;t handle it right now, I respect that.  <br/>

<br/>
My kids are learning to live in the world, learning to handle money, learning <br/>
to take care of their stuff, learning to get along with others.  Each of them <br/>
will learn it differently, and some will be better at some aspects than <br/>
others.   <br/>
<br/>
My husband is living in the world, handles money, takes care of his stuff, <br/>
and gets along with others.   I help him.  We&#39;re partners.  <br/>
<br/>
Our van is squeaking in the back.  He hates to spend money.  At some point it <br/>
will be compromise-day (maybe when I&#39;m out of town and not driving it <br/>
anyway), and it will go in the shop.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of us should be emotionally needy about the details of what is fixed. <br/>
 He will be a little traumatized about the cost.  I will be cranky if it&#39;s <br/>
not fixed well, but it&#39;s just a car repair.  It&#39;s not a learning situation for <br/>
us.  We&#39;re not going to fix it ourselves because we don&#39;t know how and we don&#39;t <br/>
have the tools for brake or wheel stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If one of my kids was paying for his own first car repair I would be willing <br/>
to help him discuss at length how to chose a garage, looking up that part of <br/>
the car to show him how it works, and the names for different parts, and the <br/>
liklihood of what and how on his own model of car.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s one thing to help your spouse understand things.  It&#39;s another <br/>
to treat your spouse like you would treat a ten year old having one of her <br/>
first emotional crises.<br/>

live with someone who is trying to &quot;disallow&quot; your emotional process.<br/>
<br/>
In the example you gave, about your car, it&#39;s clear you and Keith keep each <br/>
other&#39;s emotional issues in mind.  You don&#39;t get as bent out of shape about <br/>
repairs happening promptly because you respect his issues about money.<br/>
<br/>
You COULD tell him to get over it, it&#39;s just money and the work needs to be <br/>
done.  You COULD go do it, say &quot;Gee, sorry honey, but you knew the work <br/>
needed to be done, the money was going to get spent anyway.&quot; And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Respecting your partner&#39;s (or your kid&#39;s) emotional process is not the same <br/>
thing as treating them like a &quot;ten year old having one of her  first <br/>

Heh.  I can totally relate.<br/>
<br/>
I usually have to deconstruct something three or four times (outloud) <br/>
before it can stop bothering me.  But if we&#39;ve covered the ground once, <br/>
my husband thinks I&#39;m badgering him, even if I&#39;m speaking in a pleasant <br/>
tone of voice and not using any loaded language.  (I can see his point, <br/>
now as I type this, but when I&#39;m in the moment I really need to work <br/>

I can talk to.  Or a journal.)<br/>
<br/>
