Brainteasers & Riddles!<br/>
Scientists get to solve puzzles every day, because science and research<br/>
involve finding solutions from the clues that we are given! Just like with<br/>
brainteasers (or brain teasers) and riddles, the answers to science<br/>
mysteries are not always easy to see at first. But with time and effort,<br/>
they eventually become clear!<br/>
<br/>
Before solving the hundreds of brainteasers and riddles below, why not take<br/>
a look at the human brain, take a 3D video tour of the Brain&#39;s Inner<br/>
Workings , or visit BrainPop&#39;s Brain Movie and Quiz  to learn more about<br/>
YOUR brain!<br/>
<br/>
And then have some fun with all our brainteasers and riddles below!<br/>
We give you the answers for every one so you can check to see how well you<br/>
did!<br/>
Challenge your parents and friends too.<br/>
