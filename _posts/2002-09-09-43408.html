&lt;&lt; H. (who may be controlling and coercive, but would be very uncomfy with my<br/>
12-year-old son watching porn...) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t HAVE a twelve year old.<br/>
<br/>
You have a one year old (boy? girl?) and a five year old girl.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all, right?  No older boys, no teens.<br/>
<br/>
So while it&#39;s okay to say &quot;If I had a twelve-year-old-son...&quot; I don&#39;t think <br/>
it&#39;s quite honest for the conversation to have gotten this heated and this <br/>
far only to have it turn out that the one with the direst warnings HAS  no <br/>
such son.<br/>
<br/>
We had long discussions a few weeks ago with someone who turned out to have <br/>
no children whatsoever, not a homeschooling parent.<br/>
<br/>
-=-but would be very uncomfy with my<br/>
12-year-old son watching porn...-=-<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it&#39;s just personal to me that &quot;my&quot; indicates that one would HAVE a <br/>
12-year-old-son.<br/>
<br/>
If I write about my husband, I&#39;m talking about Keith Dodd, who&#39;s been in my <br/>
life for 25 years.  Not a hypothetical, if-I-had-a-husband.<br/>
<br/>
If I write about my sixteen year old son, I&#39;m talking about Kirby Dodd <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/kirby">http://sandradodd.com/kirby</a><br/>
<br/>
and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Have we been arguing about nothing with someone who doesn&#39;t actually have a <br/>
twelve year old son?  Who might not have ANY son?  Am I wrong to be concerned <br/>
with honesty in these discussions?<br/>
<br/>
And so let&#39;s review the bit about movies coming on with sex scenes and oral <br/>
and breast-contact.  First, that&#39;s not usually even hinted at in R rated <br/>
movies.  But the writer said she had seen the looks on &quot;their&quot; (plural <br/>
children&#39;s) faces when those scenes came on.   The look on the face of a one <br/>
year old was indicative of ANYTHING about the reactions of teenaged boys <br/>
not-appearing-ihat <br/>
area, because it is so easy for it to be invisible.&quot;  If there is no son, one <br/>
should not say &quot;my son.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
(Perhaps I&#39;m thinking of the wrong poster, and looking in fifteen old posts <br/>
failed to turn up the little account of a movie being on involving <br/>
mouth-to-breast, which I seriously have never seen on TV, and the writer <br/>
mentioned seeing the looks on the children&#39;s faces.)<br/>
<br/>
Probably in intros somewhere are details which would clarify some of this, <br/>
but I don&#39;t think people should need to read through archives to stay in the <br/>
conversation.  People come into and leave the discussion all the time, so if <br/>
they pop in and I&#39;m talking about my eighteen year old daughter, they MIGHT <br/>
think I HAVE an eighteen year old daughter (which I don&#39;t).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra, I agree with not being able to say what one would do if they weren&#39;t <br/>
actually in that situation. None of us can really know what goes on in each <br/>
others lives no matter how much we talk about it because we are all so <br/>
different. But again I think with some people it may be human nature to <br/>
think how one would feel or react without actually being there. Of coure I&#39;m <br/>
speculating as it wasn&#39;t me.<br/>
<br/>
What was me was the post about the whole movie oral boob thing going on. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t on TV but a rented or maybe even a cable movie. My husband and I had <br/>
seen it before but just forgot about that part in it and it was the only <br/>
part like that which had anything to do with sex at all. Can&#39;t remember the <br/>
movie and it seemed to be in there just for the sake of showing some skin. <br/>
Both of my middle children were watching with us and both of them had a look <br/>
on their faces which showed a mix of confusion and shock and being <br/>
uncomfortable. Luckily it was over as fast as it started but that&#39;s the kind <br/>
of thing that I watch for when I let them watch movies that some would <br/>
consider for adults or much older children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you know about Screen It <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.screenit.com/">http://www.screenit.com/</a> ? They describe what&#39;s<br/>
in each movie, giving a brief description of scenes that fall under the<br/>
categories of scary music, jump scenes, sex, violence, bad attitude and so<br/>
forth so you can know ahead of time whats in a movie might bother your<br/>
child.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah Joyce, I&#39;ve had the screen it sight for quite a long time now. I <br/>
absolutely love it. The only problem I run into with it is they don&#39;t list <br/>
some of the older movies. I just tried to look up RoboCop on it and found <br/>
nothing. But for the newer stuff, it&#39;s great.<br/>
