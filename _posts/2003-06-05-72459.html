&lt;&lt;There are many families here whose children<br/>
do have freedom to choose their own food. They don&#39;t subsist onsweets.<br/>
(My daughter still has Easter chocolate.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s funny. Just yesterday Alyssa finally ate the ears off a bunny from<br/>
Easter that is actually Tara&#39;s. We still have another one unwrapped and well<br/>
the bunny without the ears is still missing just that. Only his ears!<br/>
I&#39;ll be throwing out Easter candy before Halloween and throwing out<br/>
Halloween candy for Christmas. And me and my  2 youngest girls do have a<br/>
sweet tooth. Joseph and Tara don&#39;t at all.<br/>

them.  They will be in the freezer until whenever.  They never get eaten.  I <br/>
don&#39;t throw them out but after a year or two they will.<br/>

LOL!!! I have a joke somewhat like that still posted up on the wall by the<br/>
puter. It&#39;s a picture of 2 chocolate Easter bunnies. One has a bite out of<br/>
it&#39;s butt and he&#39;s saying, &quot;My butt hurts&quot; and the other bunny says &quot;What??&quot;<br/>
and his ears are missing!!!<br/>
<br/>
My mom didn&#39;t get it.  (sigh)<br/>
