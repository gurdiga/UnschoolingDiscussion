<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We also have a 15 month old Black Lab mix. To say she&#39;s hyper is an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>understatement. She&#39;s a great dog, but we haven&#39;t been able to stop her from<br/>
pulling hard when we walk her.<br/>
<br/>
OOH!  get a thing called &quot;HALTI&quot; or &quot;Gentle Leader&quot; - fixes pulling right<br/>
away- works like a horse halter. absolutely amazing!<br/>
<br/>
lots of places to buy on line, or at pets maart<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She also jumps on people. (She&#39;s knocked folks down!!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;The Power of Positive Dog Training&quot;  a book!  maybe will help- the author<br/>
also has a web site, and an e-list- and she personally answers questions.<br/>
um, Pat Miller.  oh, and<br/>
&quot;The Culture CLash&quot; Jean Donaldson<br/>
<br/>
PPDT has steps- like what to do in &quot;week one&#39;  then &quot;week two&quot;- then in the<br/>
back addresses specific problems- makes it fun.  ALso, with this method of<br/>
training, the dog does the thinking- you dont push him or pull him into<br/>
positions, which would be good for your back. and like i said its FUN- the<br/>
dog just LOVES it- it is so cute - and the trainer has fun too!  and it is<br/>
very effective.<br/>
