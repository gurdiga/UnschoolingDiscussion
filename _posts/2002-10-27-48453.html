<div id="ygrps-yiv-267237225">Luk 2:42    And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after <br/>
the custom of the feast. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 2:43    And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the <br/>
child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not <br/>
[of it]. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 2:44    But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a <br/>
day&#39;s journey; and they sought him among [their] kinsfolk and acquaintance. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 2:45    And when they found him not, they turned back again to <br/>
Jerusalem, seeking him. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 2:46    And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in <br/>
the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and <br/>
asking them questions. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 2:47    And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding <br/>
and answers. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 2:48    And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said <br/>
unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I <br/>
have sought thee sorrowing. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 2:49    And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye <br/>
not that I must be about my Father&#39;s business? <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 2:50    And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</div>
