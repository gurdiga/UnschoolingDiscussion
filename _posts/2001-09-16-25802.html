<div id="ygrps-yiv-919999311">&lt;&lt;  Tribal warfare  has been going on for two thousand years and has now been<br/>
 magnified  globally. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where did he get that number?<br/>
How long have there been people on earth?  <br/>
<br/>
NATIONAL warfare has been going on more than two thousand years, and tribal <br/>
since way before.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; And I asked  myself,  Why didn&#39;t I feel this way  last week? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because people who live with that feeling too long get used to it.  If they <br/>
don&#39;t get used to it it makes them sick, or dead.   Shock turns into other <br/>
things after a while.   People can&#39;t physically live in a state of shock.<br/>
<br/>
Deepak Chopra grew up Hindu, didn&#39;t he?  It&#39;s a really peaceful religion.  <br/>
There aren&#39;t many of those in the world.  And it didn&#39;t save India from <br/>
England or from the religious wars there which spawned Pakistan (East and <br/>
West) and then Bangladesh.  Their beliefs about their soul&#39;s immediate future <br/>
are much different from the beliefs of their own Moslem neighbors, and from <br/>
most Americans.<br/>
<br/>
Less than two weeks before the attacks here, Keith and I had told our kids <br/>
about Japanese kamikaze fighters in WWII, and how their religious and <br/>
cultural beliefs allowed for suicide which our own culture declares sinful <br/>
and illegal, and soul-damning.  Now we&#39;re up against another religion and <br/>
culture which also allows and sometimes glorifies self-immolation.  We can&#39;t <br/>
change their history or their culture or what their religious leaders say.  <br/>
We can&#39;t change what the Koran says.<br/>
<br/>
We could lie down and be peaceful until we&#39;re all dead.  We could die <br/>
wishfully hoping that our wishful hoping could avert millions of believers in <br/>
other religions.  That&#39;s a lot of what religion is anyway---what were you <br/>
believing at the moment of your death?  And then hoping it matters.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t simple and can&#39;t be made simple by either warmongers, peaceniks, <br/>
nor anyone in between.  it&#39;s just going to be something we have to get <br/>
through philosophically and practically without blaming other people&#39;s <br/>
thoughts for &quot;causing&quot; it.  And I don&#39;t think Jerry Falwell&#39;s right that <br/>
commies, homosexuals, feminists and the American Civil Liberties Union caused <br/>
it either.  (I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left a couple of guilty parties off his list, but <br/>
he also cited the pursuit of health and wealth, so tofu eaters and <br/>
exercise-bikers helped cause it too, according to *that* &quot;man of God.&quot;)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be negative, I&#39;m trying to be realistic.  I&#39;m trying to <br/>
turn the lights on in a place in which people seem to be hoping they can wish <br/>
away human instinct and manifest human nature.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320320518">Hinduism is the third largest organized religion in the world <br/>
accounting for approximately 15% --900 million-- of the people who <br/>
define themselves as being of a particular religion.<br/>
<br/>
Christianity is first with 2 billion and Islam is second with 1.3 <br/>
billion.<br/>
<br/>
All religions present themselves as peaceful yet radical factions <br/>
within them have consistantly throughout history been the driving <br/>
force behind some of the worst atrocities perpetrated against mankind.<br/>

others&#39; mouths that they wouldn&#39;t have put there themselves. Personally I<br/>
thought Sandra&#39;s comment was thought provoking. I hadn&#39;t looked at it in<br/>
that way before.<br/>
<br/>
Opinions and feelings are as common as dirt.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking is a whole lot rarer. (It&#39;s good brain exercise by the way.)<br/>
<br/>
Challenging the logic and facts in someone&#39;s opinion doesn&#39;t take away their<br/>
right to hold onto it or express it. But encouraging an atmosphere that<br/>
allows opinions to be expressed without fear of challenge is suggesting<br/>
politeness is more important than thought and truthfulness.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially telling someone who is not breaking the rules of the list to<br/>
shut up steps on their right to free expression.  If anyone doesn&#39;t like the<br/>
way someone else on the list expresses themselves, they have the right to<br/>
click on delete.<br/>

  IMO politeness will promote more offering of opinions because people won&#39;t be worried about being attacked if they post something.  This list has something like 500 members. Look at how many of those members regularly post. Do the numbers look a little bit skewed to you? Wonder why *the rest* of those members don&#39;t post....<br/>

  It&#39;s just as bad as suggesting that they leave the list.  But you&#39;re right... suggesting to use their delete key would be a much wiser thing to do than to suggest that this list isn&#39;t meant for them or is perhaps not what they&#39;re looking for. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my considerable experience with internet mailing lists, the vast majority<br/>
of all members of all mailing lists everywhere do not post, or post<br/>
extremely rarely. Find me one list administrator anywhere who has a<br/>
discussion list numbering more than, oh, say, 50 or so who has more than 25%<br/>
(and that&#39;s probably very high) posting weekly or bi-weekly, I&#39;d be<br/>
fascinated to talk to them.<br/>
<br/>
Some subscribers don&#39;t even read the posts, or don&#39;t read them regularly.<br/>
I&#39;m on two mailing lists right now that I haven&#39;t read in months -- I get<br/>
the digests and immediately delete. I keep them active simply because I&#39;m<br/>
thinking I might want to start using them again &quot;sometime&quot; and it&#39;s easier<br/>
just to hit a delete key once a day than it is to unsubscribe and<br/>
resubscribe later. I deleted THIS list for months before I started reading<br/>
again. I was not sitting quaking in a corner fearful that the big meanies on<br/>
the list would stomp me, I was just busy with other things.<br/>
<br/>
Some read sometimes or all the time but don&#39;t want to write. I am on a<br/>
couple of other lists where I read but almost never (like, once every few<br/>
months I&#39;ll pipe up with a paragraph) write. I am there simply to gather<br/>
information, not to chat. I don&#39;t participate for varying reasons: lack of<br/>
time, lack of knowledge, wanting to be under the radar for business reasons.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who are afraid of any number of things including being<br/>
asked to think about their beliefs and yes, if they sit up publicly on a<br/>
list and speak, afraid to examine those beliefs. No one here is forced to<br/>
post, nor are they forced to respond to anything anyone writes. If Joe<br/>
Poster comes on tomorrow and says that his child is unschooling at a nice<br/>
Swiss Boarding School and 47 of us say, &quot;WHAT?! That&#39;s not unschooling!&quot; Joe<br/>
Poster is completely free to respond OR NOT.<br/>
<br/>
I am on an extremely polite homeschooling list and it&#39;s excruciatingly<br/>
boring (the one I said recently I use for insomnia-control). It does not<br/>
promote more offering of opinions, it squelches opinions ruthlessly because<br/>
no one is allowed to disagree with anyone else. It is not my favorite list,<br/>
though it&#39;s useful for homeschooling legal news in my state.<br/>
<br/>
It would be sad to me if something as vivid with possibilities as an<br/>
unschooling list became my new cure for insomnia. It would be even sadder if<br/>
the brave (and relatively) new word, unschooling, came to mean &quot;whatever<br/>
anyone wants it to mean&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There are many fine terms out there to describe what some here are trying to<br/>
insist is unschooling: eclectic homeschooling, relaxed homeschooling, etc. I<br/>
join in the bafflement of those who have said they don&#39;t understand why<br/>
people who are patently NOT unschooling insist that they are. In my cynicism<br/>
I suspect that because unschooling seems avant garde and dangerous and edgy<br/>
the very name and idea of it attracts some.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to eat less meat, but I&#39;m not a vegetarian. I&#39;m trying to be less<br/>
coercive with my children, but I&#39;m not a TCS parent. I once kissed a girl,<br/>
but I don&#39;t go around claiming to be a lesbian to make myself seem more<br/>
interesting. I suppose I could. I could claim to be a lesbian who really<br/>
only likes to have sex with men, and fight to the end insisting that my<br/>
definition of &quot;lesbian&quot; is as valid as anyone else&#39;s. I wonder how most<br/>
members of a lesbian support list would react to my claims (after they<br/>
finished laughing at me)?<br/>
<br/>
This list is in existence to support unschooling. As we can see from the<br/>
recent plethora of posts, such a goal isn&#39;t easy. Worthwhile things almost<br/>
never are.<br/>

&gt; &gt; only likes to have sex with men, and fight to the end insisting <br/>
&gt; that my<br/>
&gt; &gt; definition of &quot;lesbian&quot; is as valid as anyone else&#39;s. I wonder how <br/>
&gt; most<br/>
&gt; &gt; members of a lesbian support list would react to my claims (after <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; finished laughing at me)?<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL!<br/>
 As an emancipated minor at sixteen I moved from hickville to Portland,<br/>
OR.  I met a wonderful friend, we hit it off right away and spent every<br/>
minute together.  It was five <br/>
days before I realized we were DATING!  Wow!  I won&#39;t say I was a<br/>
sheltered child but certainly never encountered this in my little world. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Was that you, Pam?<br/>

support with humour and without malice. It does that well and a true <br/>

&gt;Dunno.  That&#39;s why I asked. Wondered why you pointed<br/>
&gt;out the qualities of this other list. My Grandmother<br/>
&gt;used to do that too, only it was my cousins rather<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was simply offering to talk to the person who wanted to talk to someone<br/>
who ran a list where a lot of members were active posters.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to share my thoughts on why. You seem to have had a problem with<br/>
this which I neither expected nor understand.<br/>
<br/>
I made a (facetious) comment about not telling this list where the other<br/>
list was. It was meant as a joke (which is consistent with the list I was<br/>
talking about :-)).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone had actually asked I would have happily told them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931522215">Hi Alan....do you really want clarification? If not,<br/>
I&#39;m ok with letting it go. If you really don&#39;t<br/>
understand the analaogy and want to, I&#39;ll ATTEMPT to<br/>
explain. Probably take an essay, and probably be<br/>
poorly executed. But it doesn&#39;t matter. Not a real<br/>
problem.<br/>
