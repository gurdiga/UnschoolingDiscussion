<div id="ygrps-yiv-975819917">I just told the kids to work it out and be fair. So far, so good - three <br/>
kids, one imac. When they have conflicts they come to me and I help them <br/>
resolve the conflict but I don&#39;t resolve it for them.  The kids are ages <br/>
12, 8, and 4. Sometimes they fight, but more often they just work it out <br/>
on their own.<br/>
<br/>
this isn&#39;t much info, but it really does work. It&#39;s a little *loud* <br/>
sometimes, but unschooling generally is and my kids are always loud (or <br/>
at least it seems that way :-)<br/>

<br/>
We have one computer for games and this internet one, which is <br/>
mine all mine!!<br/>
The kids (10, 9 and 7) decided amongst themselves how to share <br/>
the computer and asked me to help. They decided that for fast <br/>
action games like Serious Sam or Half Life, having half an hour was <br/>
fair then the next one got a go. For slower games like the SIMS <br/>
and Baldur&#39;s Gate they allowed an hour.<br/>
They do the same with the Play Station.<br/>
My job was to monitor the clock.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest though, since I made the computer unlimited about 2 <br/>
years ago, things are much more harmonious and they play a lot <br/>
less. There isn&#39;t that frantic *need* to get their hour asap.<br/>
<br/>
This week no-one has played on the games computer except me ;-)<br/>
My kids have created a war game using the Cuisinaire rods (I knew <br/>
they&#39;d come in handy one day) and I&#39;ve been playing Return to <br/>
Castle Wolfenstein uninterrupted.<br/>

Yes I am asking in advance BUT there are current disputes happening with the 1 computer we have NOW.  I do have to limit this one&#39;s use because I have a home business that depends on it staying free for me and in working order.  I think I will see how it will go.  <br/>

explained to him about sharing and then bought a big stop-watch <br/>
that does minutes. He was in charge of it for when it was his &#39;go&#39;. <br/>
Generally the others let him go first.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t always perfect and we get arguments when someone <br/>
forgets to time their &#39;go&#39; and someone else feels agrieved that a <br/>
sibling has had longer but generally its been ok.<br/>
Because they are in control and not me they can decide amongst <br/>
themselves without the worry that mum will order them off the <br/>
machine. They are also free to play &#39;their hearts out&#39; which gets the <br/>
game out of their syste.<br/>
I&#39;m the same. When we get a new game I want to play it endlessly <br/>
so I can see what happens next. I get the same length &#39;go&#39; as the <br/>
kids too.<br/>
We also get fun in watching each other. I was playing the Harry <br/>
Potter game the other day with 3 kids giving advice and remarking <br/>
on my ineptness. (Which is mainly cos in the game Harry has a <br/>
stupid wand, and not a flamethrower or Uzi which would be far <br/>
more useful against those gnome thingies in my opinion!)<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve scheduled three successfully for years by saying each turn lasts as <br/>
long as it lasts.  They can know who&#39;s next (and it doesn&#39;t have to be a <br/>
strict rotation--often one kid isn&#39;t home or isn&#39;t interested), and the one <br/>
who&#39;s next can pass his turn or #3 skip over him and he&#39;ll be third.  But <br/>
standing breathing and saying &quot;Hurry&quot; was against the rules.<br/>
<br/>
Some turns last ten or fifteen minutes.  Some last hours.<br/>
<br/>
There will be other things to do in the house.  If there aren&#39;t, it&#39;s a good <br/>
excuse to devise some other things to do which are also attractive.<br/>
<br/>
It will be busier while it&#39;s new than after the excitement wears off.<br/>

unlikely to last as long.<br/>
We don&#39;t time the turns, though.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes someone who just needs to play through ( get e-mail or something) <br/>
will negotiate for a spot in the midst of someone else&#39;s time, and the <br/>
&quot;computer holder&quot; will go get food or walk the dog, come back and resume the <br/>
turn.<br/>
