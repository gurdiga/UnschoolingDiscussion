<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hi, I usually don&#39;t send announcements to this list.  But while I&#39;ve been<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on vacation I&#39;ve had the opportunity to review a neat homeschooling<br/>
documentary and wanted to let you know about it.  It&#39;s called, &quot;Inventing A<br/>
Girl&quot; and it is a charming depiction of the life of a mostly unschooled<br/>
girl.  For those of you who do &quot;follow the child&quot; it is affirming to watch<br/>
the film.  It might also help relatives and friends to understand this<br/>
educational lifestyle.  I<br/>
think the film would be a very worthwhile purchase for support groups -- as<br/>
it could be be viewed at a monthly meeting or be loaned out to new members<br/>
seeking information about homeschooling. It would be a great addition to<br/>
Home Study or Independent Study libraries and resource centers as well.  The<br/>
producer is offering a special discount until August 31st -- details<br/>
follow...<br/>

&gt;After spending two years living with the Borensteins, an American<br/>
 </span></blockquote>homeschooling family, acclaimed filmmaker Fernanda Rossi engages the most<br/>
skeptical audiences with an entertaining and original film.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Told from the perspective of a funny and inquisitive nine-year old, this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>groundbreaking documentary asks -and answers- 20 essential questions about<br/>
homeschooling: How do you learn? Can you go to college? Do you take any<br/>
classes?.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Inventing a Girl is the first documentary on homeschooling ideal for:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Homeschoolers curious to learn about the experiences of other homeschooled<br/>
kids. And their in-laws and neighbors who are still asking &quot;How are those<br/>
kids being socialized?<br/>
. Parents considering alternative education.<br/>
. Teachers and administrators who want to fully understand what<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;homeschooling is.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>. Schools and homeschooling organizations as a reference tool.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I loudly applaud Ms. Rossi&#39;s efforts to share this unique approach to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>living and learning, to bring new understanding about homeschooling to a<br/>
wider audience.&quot;<br/>
