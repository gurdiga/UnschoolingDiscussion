I am not *judging* others - trust me, my energy is precious to me and I<br/>
rarely spend it on negative matters. I could care less what you do in your<br/>
life except as another resource of experience for me and mine to draw on<br/>
when trying to make my own choices. Past that, judging is a waste of my time<br/>
and energy.<br/>
<br/>
I was questioning the origins of the need for structure. It is nature or<br/>

<br/>
On a discussion list called unschooling-dotcom, you shouldn&#39;t be surprised if <br/>
people are suspicious of anyone&#39;s claim that their children &quot;need structure&quot; <br/>
or &quot;want structure.&quot; Many unschoolers are basing their lives on the <br/>
theory/assumption/suspicion that much of what drives and maintains the public <br/>
school system (structure and all) is not well based in real human needs, but <br/>
in school-needs.  <br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t judge whether structure is better or not, good or not, necessary <br/>
or not, why wouldn&#39;t our kids be in school?  Asking questions is the way we <br/>
clarify our own beliefs, and help others who come here to clarify theirs.  <br/>
<br/>
People come here just about every day saying &quot;What should I do?&quot;  And the <br/>
best way they come to their OWN decision about what they should do is to read <br/>
what five or twenty people write here and hold their beliefs up against it <br/>
and see what speaks to their souls.  Some people really, truly, do not know <br/>
what they believe about school, education and learning.  They&#39;ve been going <br/>
with the flow and it takes some work and a lot of thinking to step out of <br/>
that flow.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good question Nicki . . . makes me think. Lelia, who is 12 now, had decided <br/>
she &quot;needed&quot; more structure and so we bought a curriculumn at the beginning <br/>
of this &quot;school&quot; year. Turns out she didn&#39;t need it at all, but she was able <br/>
todecid that. So it is an interesting question as to where that &quot;need for <br/>
structure&quot; comes from. She had gone to school the year before. . . her choice <br/>
because we had just moved and she had been miserable the year before when we <br/>
had just moved then too, so she thought school would help out in making new <br/>
friends, etc. It did, but those were friends she didn&#39;t keep after she left <br/>
the school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think for her the seemingly &quot;need&quot; for structure was society <br/>
placed, or possibly even school placed, and I suppose even her family (myself <br/>
included) pushed that thought at her. Now that she is totally unschooling, <br/>
she is the happiest I have ever seen her in her life. Her self-esteem is <br/>
rising everyday, etc. . . . <br/>
<br/>
Good thought provoking question or idea even.<br/>

The whole issue of a child choosing ps brings up lots of questions.  So, we<br/>
ask the questions.  Did the child actually make the choice or did<br/>
preconceived notions &quot;force&quot; the choice.   Was it an informed choice.  Was<br/>
it a pressured choice.  Why did the child make the choice.  Were other<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ll have that.    Apparently.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, there are your hard-line unschoolers and then there are your more <br/>
middle-of-the-road unschoolers (I think that would be me).<br/>
<br/>
I am getting more and more un, but may never be quite un enough to suit some <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
But it suits me and mine.<br/>
<br/>
And I think choices like charter schools and part-time hsing and ps <br/>
attendance and college and tutors and textbooks and some structured <br/>
activities and all sorts of other things are OK.  Now, you can take all that <br/>
and mix it with anyone who disagrees and wad it up into a big ball of paper <br/>
-- and throw it away.  And do what you were doing anyway!  Or what you have <br/>
already done.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are more adamant than others.  Some people, even in unschooling <br/>
circles (which always suprises me more than in other places, for some <br/>
reason), seem to want to tell others what is best for them.  Some have an <br/>
almost evangelical zeal to do so.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean anyone else has to get worked into a lather over it.  <br/>
Some people just have to give you loads of advice.  Remember when you were <br/>
pregnant?  Didn&#39;t everyone have sage advice to give you?  <br/>
<br/>
So it goes with parenting and schooling and homechooling and, even, <br/>
unschooling.  Apparently.  I try to remember this and take what works and <br/>
leave the rest.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there are some really valuable insights shared on this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077169628">&lt;&lt;I am getting more and more un, but may never be quite un enough to suit<br/>
some<br/>
people.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, these comments and questions aren&#39;t meant to further offend or &quot;cast<br/>
judgment&quot; but I seriously want some clarification and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the *broad* spectrum of unschooling to be those who don&#39;t do<br/>
institutionalized education and whose children learn sans curriculum. I know<br/>
there are more specific levels and types of unschoolers. I know there are<br/>
those who consider letting a child use a worksheet to be anti-unschooling. I<br/>
know those who feel that having a tv in a child&#39;s live is anti-unschooling.<br/>
I know there are those who feel like parents who are part of homeschooling<br/>
charters for whatever reason, even if they don&#39;t use a curriculum, are not<br/>
unschoolers. But generally speaking, isn&#39;t it safe to say that one can claim<br/>
to be an unschooler if they are not following some curriculum or &quot;course&quot;<br/>
and are homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that&#39;s true, don&#39;t you have your kids in PS, Nance? How can you<br/>
claim to be an unschooler, if so? I mean, you may be right that you might<br/>
never be &quot;quite un enough to suit some people&quot; but I think the first step<br/>
would be to homeschool at all, wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
I only say this from my own standpoint. I can&#39;t call myself a true<br/>
unschooler until my children are not in school. I can wholeheartedly support<br/>
unschooling views, I can agree with unschooling methods but as long as my<br/>
kids are in PS 7 hours a day, 75% or more of their waking hours a week, then<br/>
*I* am not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some people, even in unschooling<br/>
circles (which always surprises me more than in other places, for some<br/>
reason), seem to want to tell others what is best for them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t run into this personally but I *have* run into those who are<br/>
hypersensitive to other&#39;s choices and *assume* that anyone who is voicing an<br/>
opinion contrary to their own is somehow judging them, criticizing, or<br/>
telling them what to do. THAT always surprises me.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think many of us have an &quot;almost evangelical zeal&#39; to talk about<br/>
unschooling itself, what it is, what is can be, what we&#39;ve learned and how<br/>
we&#39;ve grown.  This is separate and distinct from talking about unschoolers<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not found within a Military Boarding School, but an<br/>
unschooler might go to a military boarding school as an adventure.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have four children, and I/we unschool.  What that looks like for each<br/>
individual is very different.  I have one child who loves workbooks/puzzles<br/>
and also is very orderly, neat and methodical.  She could look like a<br/>
school-at-homer. (just as long as no one calls her Homer. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Some of us are adamant that the general definition of unschooling be<br/>
separate and distinct from school-at-home because we do believe, with tons<br/>
of zeal, for it to be a better option than forcing children to do school at<br/>
home --- even while children choosing what works for them means some will<br/>
choose to do very schoolish things.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m no longer surprised to find the *zeal of defining* inside  a<br/>
community.  Unschoolers trying to define unschooling sure beats Christians<br/>
defining who is a Christian or Jews defining who is Jewish.  ;)</div>

That doesn&#39;t surprise me at all!  (the fact taht some <br/>
folk take it personal when one chooses a different path <br/>
to them, I mean)  it&#39;s a challenge to what they <br/>
believe.  I sometimes wonder if my life would be <br/>
&#39;better&#39; when I see the neighbours chatting with each <br/>
other at the end of my driveway when tehy don&#39;t even <br/>
acknowledge me...  they socialise, they smile, they <br/>
appear happy...  their lives are totally different to <br/>
mine, their children go to nursery, both parents work <br/>
outside the home, their children will go to school, <br/>
they don&#39;t family-bed or do child-led weaning or any of <br/>
that.  So it&#39;s a challenge to me...  if they&#39;re so <br/>
happy doing what they&#39;re doing, am i doing the right <br/>
thing?  The answer is I&#39;m doing the right thing for me, <br/>
but I do have to think about it every now and then!  <br/>
Also, a lot of folk (maybe particularly those who are <br/>
more &#39;mainsteam&#39; than others) aren&#39;t used to dealing <br/>
with people who don&#39;t follow a similar path to them so <br/>
theya ren&#39;t used to being challeneged in this way, it&#39;s <br/>
harder for them to respond wihtout appearing to feel <br/>
belittled or whatever by someone else&#39;s decision.  <br/>
<br/>
Now what did I really want to say?  Bother.  Oh, yes, <br/>
unschooling.  As I said in my previous post, <br/>
unschooling for me is about the person whose education <br/>
it is being able to take the decisions and <br/>
responsibility for their education, (ie, life!)  So if <br/>
a child chooses, in an informed and unpressured (hah!  <br/>
is there such a thing in a high-media-volume-life?) <br/>
way, to go to shcool, i still call that unschooling, <br/>
it&#39;s the child&#39;s life and education after all.  And I <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever too early to be able to discuss <br/>
pros and cons with a child, at their level, of course.  <br/>
which reminds me, I really need to have that <br/>
conversation with mine...<br/>

Ah-HA! Yes, I live this. I actually had someone tell me that she continues<br/>
to send her child to PS because of the socialization SHE gets as a parent.<br/>
And she continues to walk her child to school because there is this whole<br/>
social dynamic - all the parents meet, chat, socialize, go for coffee,<br/>
whatever. I totally can&#39;t get into this. I am lucky if I get shoes on<br/>
instead of slippers for the drive to school every day. I&#39;m sure not in a<br/>
mood to socialize. And I sure can&#39;t see that as a reason to continue sending<br/>
your child to school. BUT I *do* yearn for that kind of thing and you are<br/>
right, I see it and wonder what I&#39;m doing wrong, it&#39;s not easy being green.<br/>

conversation with mine...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I essentially agree with this but it really seems to overwhelm my oldest<br/>
(6yo) child. He seems to need me to make choices for him and I seem to dread<br/>
that intuitively. But what happens is that he just remains on the fence.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s not old enough to bare that burden? Maybe that is what he needs<br/>
me for - my place in his life? We do (and have done his whole life) pro and<br/>
con lists and he can&#39;t hear or feel the cons, only the pros. So he sits<br/>
forever on the fence feeling the pros of both sides and not wanting to be<br/>
the one who has to make the decision. I don&#39;t think (although I&#39;m open to<br/>
the concept) that I created this fence-sitting. I sure haven&#39;t been a fence<br/>
sitter until *very* recently but he&#39;s always shocked me by his sort of need<br/>
or want to do everything and keep everyone happy and be everything to<br/>
everybody and it makes me sad and uncomfortable and in the meantime I fear<br/>
he feels he is just succeeding in disappointing everyone. I&#39;ve been clear to<br/>
him that school is disappointing to me but he never ceases to amaze me and<br/>
he should be proud of who he is. This doesn&#39;t seem to empower him like I<br/>
hoped it would.<br/>

I think I fell into the big category of people who never gave it much thought <br/>
until I actually got to see what school was like up close, for my kids.  It <br/>
was such a loooong time ago for me and I don&#39;t think it occurred to anyone in <br/>
my family that there were any choices back then.  But my son was miserable <br/>
(&quot;Mom, they don&#39;t teach me anything in school&quot; was the clincher when I <br/>
confronted him after days of his being moody/grumpy.).  And I spent a lot of <br/>
time (to me -- people spend longer) complaining and fighting for what I <br/>
wanted for my child, and began hsing.  And we have evolved to this point -- <br/>
where I think(!) I would never send the kids back to school and am now <br/>
viewing college suspiciously.  <br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, I was very proud of myself the other day.  My daughter <br/>
(6 yo artistic type, extremely bright, articulate, wants to be either an <br/>
artist or a wrestler or a particular type of vet -- this list changes often) <br/>
and I got talking about how some work takes extensive university education <br/>
and some takes none and some takes a combination of college and hands-on <br/>
experience -- it was a nice little conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Did that answer anything?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, this must have been the part of the conversation I missed.  Around here <br/>
(insert appropriate disclaimer if this is not your situation) the 6 yo (and <br/>
sometimes the 8 yo) are overwhelmed if you give them too many choices.<br/>
<br/>
Dinner brings this on.  Anything really where there are more than 2 choices.  <br/>
So I offer 2.  That&#39;s my solution.  Not, what would you like for dinner? <br/>
(Yes, I know, I should be more organized and not start to plan dinner at 4:30 <br/>
but -- oh, buzz off all you organized Martha Stewart types! :) ) But, would <br/>
you like grilled cheese and soup or hot dog and fries?  <br/>
<br/>
To think of asking her to choose whether to school or not -- I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
her having enough info -- the input she has gotten from me has not been <br/>
balanced, good info.  Definitely slanted.  Anything else is from other kids <br/>
-- also slanted.  Or TV.  Or her brother&#39;s disastrous experience.  (Actually, <br/>
the couple of times she has asked about it he has explained how boring <br/>
everything was so that helps.)<br/>
<br/>
It would just be too much for her to have to be responsible for.  We&#39;ll have <br/>
to work it out as we go along.<br/>

See, I told you I wasn&#39;t radically un! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110777883">My daughter and I were a little more than perturbed by some comments that <br/>
were made about ps, mostly because we have educated our children in every way <br/>
possible, so when I talk about ps I speak from experience. I have 4 kids and <br/>
2 are hs and 2 ps--by their choice. They were not damaged by their experience <br/>
in ps, but the other 2 could have been, had I not intervened and took them <br/>
out of school. I volunteered in their classrooms on a regular basis and <br/>
sometimes was not happy with what I was seeing but I was usually able to <br/>
intervene to make changes. School is not entirely void of choice, but there <br/>
is structure. Structure isn&#39;t necessarily bad--don&#39;t your kids have a <br/>
bedtime? My daughter who attends ps now is involved in many extracirricular <br/>
activities and she&#39;s an honor roll student, so when she talks, teachers tend <br/>
to listen.<br/>
My son, on the other hand is resistant to structure, which is why he chooses <br/>
to unschool--his education is completely directed by him, however, if he <br/>
decides he wants to go back to ps in the future I will let him--it would be <br/>

<br/>
They go to bed when they&#39;re tired.  And they&#39;re honest about that, because <br/>
they DO have the option, so sometimes they go to bed early and sometimes very <br/>
late because they were doing something fascinating and stayed awake from <br/>
their interest and involvement in that thing--a game, a conversation, a book, <br/>
a movie...<br/>

children do not have a bedtime, nor a wake up time, nor a set time to read,<br/>
or a set time to know their mulitiplication tables, nor a preset time for<br/>
just about anything..... Except meetings with other people, where a set time<br/>

<br/>
Only because PS demands it. Prior to that (and after this school year), no.<br/>
Did they get enough sleep? yes. They averaged 12-14 hours a day with sleep<br/>
and naps combined. And this was for a 2 and 5yo. There is a big difference<br/>
between structure imposed upon you or structure you impose on yourself. Like<br/>
I feel better if I go to sleep by 10pm instead of staying up until 12am or<br/>
falling asleep at 8pm. So I try to structure my nights so I go to sleep<br/>
around 10pm. However, I&#39;d sure be resentful if my husband decided to take it<br/>
upon himself to tell me when my bedtime should be. Heck, even if he picked<br/>
10pm, I&#39;d still be angry that he decided it was appropriate to tell me when<br/>
I need to sleep. I have to assume my children are just as capable.<br/>
