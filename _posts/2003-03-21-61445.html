<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094087018">Dear friends --<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to tell you all that my new homeschooling book is out (and<br/>
I&#39;m very proud of it! [:-[] Sorry, proud papa can&#39;t help it.) More to<br/>
the point though, back last summer I put out an announcement for a<br/>
homeschool book cover contest, and I wanted to take the opportunity to<br/>
let you know about the winner, and to thank all your kids who<br/>
participated! (We had hundreds of entries, from as far away as Kuala<br/>
Lampur, Malaysia, and Capetown, South Africa.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very pleased with it, indeed -- the ship even has a moustache (to<br/>
resemble me, I guess, though I have never met the artist).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow -- you can see it on my website at www.skylarksings.com<br/>
<br/>
At some future point (once I get myself better organized), I hope to<br/>
post some of the runnersup on the site -- there were so many good<br/>
ones! [:-)]<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

THIRTEEN-YEAR OLD WINS CONTEST TO DESIGN BOOK COVER<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Monroe, ME: Homeschooler Brianna Kathleen Thomas of Prince George,<br/>
British Columbia has won a contest for the artwork to a book cover for<br/>
David H. Albert&#39;s forthcoming Homeschooling and the Voyage of<br/>
Self-Discovery: A Journey of Original Seeking (Common Courage Press,<br/>
2003). Ingeniously crafted from plasticine, her cover, features three<br/>
children on a boat, nicely echoing the theme in the title. She<br/>
received the prize of $100.<br/>
<br/>
The art work was then used by designers Matt Wuerker and Erica<br/>
Bjerning who placed the title, subtitle and other type on the cover.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas was surprised to win. &quot;I thought for sure the prize had gone to<br/>
someone else,&quot; she said in a recent phone call informing her that her<br/>
work had been selected.<br/>
<br/>
While writing his book last year, Albert decided to put his faith<br/>
where his commitments were and asked his publisher to run a contest<br/>
for a cover for his book. Greg Bates and Flic Shooter, publishers at<br/>
Common Courage Press, were worried. &quot;One concern was whether there<br/>
were enough young artists out there with the confidence to submit<br/>
entries,&quot; Bates said. But their real worry was quality. &quot;What<br/>
publisher in his right mind would entrust a cover--the most important<br/>
piece of advertising for a book--to a contest whose contestants had to<br/>
be 15 years of age or under,&quot; he said. &quot;I spent several sleepless<br/>
nights worrying that we were running a contest no one would win,&quot;<br/>
Bates continued.<br/>
<br/>
But Albert, long a champion of the passions of homeschoolers, never<br/>
wavered. &quot;We will have lots of entries and more than one great cover,&quot;<br/>
he predicted. Albert was right on both counts.<br/>
<br/>
Word spread fast around the net and the network of homeschoolers. &quot;We<br/>
live in a tiny town,&quot; noted Bates. &quot;And when we received hundreds of<br/>
entries, even the post office took notice. It got to the point where<br/>
the postal clerk would announce how many entries we received each<br/>
day,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
Shooter, in charge of the initial review of entries, said, &quot;We were<br/>
quickly forced to develop a sorting system to handle the incoming art.<br/>
I enlisted our seven-year-old daughter to help with the task, and was<br/>
amazed to see how much she loved looking at the entries.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We received several great entries,&quot; Shooter said. &quot;But Brianna&#39;s work<br/>
took my breath away from the moment I opened it,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We hoped for a good cover,&quot; Bates said. &quot;What we got was a masterpiece.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
About the cover artist:<br/>
<br/>
Brianna Kathleen Thomas did the cover art when she was thirteen years<br/>
old. She is homeschooled and she loves to make pictures with<br/>
plasticine and write fantasy and adventure stories. She lives with her<br/>
Mom, dad, her sister Molly, and her two brothers, Kieran and Aidan.<br/>
She also lives with her spunky cat, Scarlet and her dog, Griz, plus an<br/>
assortment of gerbils. For interviews, contact<br/>
