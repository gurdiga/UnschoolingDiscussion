<div id="ygrps-yiv-916295230">Hi Virginia, <br/>
Where are you in SC??? I&#39;m in Gaston, a tad south of Columbia!<br/>
Myranda<br/>
<br/>
  Hi Maria! My name is Virginia and I live in SC and I am trying to get my son Christopher (about to eight and in the second grade) out of the public school system. I just finished eight hours of paperwork and I am still not done. They put you through these hoops so you will be afraid and back down. I know. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Two years ago, when my son was in kindergarden, I tried to homeschool. The school got DSS involved because they thought my son had ADHD. His TEAHER had &quot;diagnosed&quot; him. Out of fear, I backed down. My ex and I had just separated and I was scared they would take Chris away from me. So I kept him in school and let them put him on Concerta. His problems have worsened instead of improving.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Although Chris manages to pass all his subjects, he is supposedly disruptive to the other students. I look forward to having him at home. I have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; him since he was born. Chris could write and read when he entered kindergarden. He knew his colors, shapes, numbers and such in pre-kindergarden. Children just have to learn the way they learn and the school system is not set up for that. They are set up as a diploma factory. I feel for you because I am there too. But I am proud of you for having the courage to do what you know is best.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  The school system bullies parents into abdicating the right to the joys and wonders of teaching their own children. Their fear makes them do this. Our society has the cock-eyed notion that, if everyone does not conform to a set standard, that all of civilization will fall into anarchy. After two years of the &quot;joys&quot; of the public school system, I think I am ready for a little anarchy&lt;ggg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Well, I will stop rambling now. Take care.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Brightest Blessings,<br/>
<br/>
                  Virginia<br/>
