<div id="ygrps-yiv-595138353">** Maybe it&#39;s more accurate to say that you haven&#39;t artificially imposed any<br/>
 fears on them since I don&#39;t think fears are entirely caused by parenting<br/>
and<br/>
 environment. Some of it&#39;s genetic.<br/>
<br/>
 (Just wanted to reassure anyone who is cosleeping and whose child is still<br/>
 fearful.)**<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right, Joyce- the thought occurred to me while I was lying in<br/>
bed trying to fall asleep last night! I&#39;m sure there are lots of kids who<br/>
are attachment-parented and still have some fear issues.<br/>
There&#39;s just such a contrast between my kids and their lack of fear, and my<br/>
childhood full of fears. Especially since Noah (almost 6) is so sensitive in<br/>
many other aspects (both physical-loud noises, tags in clothes,<br/>
temperature-and emotionally-getting teased etc), it&#39;s nice to see that he&#39;s<br/>
not often afraid of things.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only one of my children, the youngest of four, has fear issues which <br/>
really bothered me for a while since we did the whole attachment <br/>
parenting thing.  She not only needed me at night long after the <br/>
others didn&#39;t (and still does) but even sitting on the bus and not <br/>
being able to touch me caused her anxiety.  As a baby, I had to drive <br/>
constantly touching her foot or she would scream.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out she has Tourette&#39;s Syndrome and has only been recently <br/>
diagnosed just days after her 9th birthday.  It gets worse after a <br/>
strep infection (a condition called PANDAS).  I can tell her fear <br/>
issue is related to the TS because when things are bad for her she&#39;s <br/>
even afraid that I&#39;ve left her if she can&#39;t see me.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that she has always has access to me and that I tried to <br/>
meet her needs even when they seemed unreasonable.  Talking to other <br/>
TS moms, I can she how much better she is!  I&#39;m also glad she never <br/>
went to school.  It appears it&#39;s about the worse thing you can do to <br/>
a TS kid.  It&#39;s pure torture!<br/>

**Hi Holly - Rowan, who&#39;s six, also has TS.  This is just how I feel too.<br/>
When we first started reading about TS I was struck by two things: first,<br/>
that just about all the info regarding medication said that it was necessary<br/>
so that the child would not be made fun of at school, and second, that I was<br/>
so glad we had dealt with her difficulties respectfully and gently and<br/>
kindly even when we didn&#39;t understand what was causing them.<br/>
<br/>
Are you on a TS e-list?  I haven&#39;t looked into talking to other parents yet,<br/>
but I&#39;d like to.  ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only list I found was full of people who were sending their kids <br/>
to school.  The only ones homeschooling seemed like they were very <br/>
controlling school-at-homers.  The things they talked about scared <br/>
me.  Some of these young kids were on 4 or 5 psychoactive drugs.  The <br/>
original drugs were perscribe for tics and ADHD and the others were <br/>
perscribed to handle the side effects of the first drugs.  The side <br/>
effects of those drugs included violence, weight gain and loss of <br/>
hair among others.  Some of the kids spent time in the pysch wards at <br/>
the hospitals.<br/>
<br/>
Not only does Abba not have to worry about ADHD (which I don&#39;t see as <br/>
ADHD anyway- just a whiole lot of energy), ticking and shouting out <br/>
because at home we don&#39;t mind but the lack of stress helps keep <br/>
symptoms down.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s time to start a TS unschool list. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673072338">Rue and Holly,<br/>
My 13yo ds has TS and that is why we started homeschooling and eventually <br/>
unschooling.  We do have to do meds as he has a related seizure disorder and the <br/>
seizures have responded beautifully to the meds when we keep it all in <br/>
balance.  Each growth spurt is a challenge.  3 years ago you could pick my son out of <br/>
a group as &quot;the one with the problems&quot;, but after three years of care and <br/>
nurturing at home he has a wonderful circle of friends from age 8 to 68 and he is <br/>
sooo much more comfortable with himself, thus projecting a better image to <br/>
the outside world.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has been the best thing for all of us.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a homeschooling group for kids with special needs it is called <br/>
HSplus@yahoogroups. com.  I lurk on it but haven&#39;t felt that it truly met my needs. <br/>
 Finding much more support here.<br/>
<br/>
As my son has aged the features of his TS have changed.  The very impulsive <br/>
ADHD type behaviors have given over into more tics in some ways but fewer <br/>
outbursts.  We have used a lot of occupational therapy work for kids with sensory <br/>
integration to help him learn how to recognize and regulate stresses that may <br/>
be building up.<br/>
<br/>
Without the stress of school we have found it to be very livable and we <br/>
hardly (except for the seizure meds) think about it anymore.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460489335">Wow!  Three unschooling TS kids!  I thought I was all alone. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
This has been the hardest thing I&#39;ve had to deal with as a mother <br/>
and, as always, if felt so isolated from everyone with the same <br/>
problem because I look at life so differently.  I feel so much better <br/>
now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I still think about it *all* the time. I think I&#39;m in mourning.  Abba <br/>
went from a happy, outgoing child to someone who is so guarded and <br/>
almost always upset.  She was doing some modeling and acting, earning <br/>
her own money but we&#39;ve had to stop that.  I didn&#39;t even tell her.  I <br/>
just tell who ever calls about an audition that she&#39;s unavailable <br/>
right now.  She&#39;s so lonely because she doesn&#39;t play well with other <br/>
children and friends don&#39;t seem come around as much anymore.  Her old <br/>
friends in her theatre classes shun her during class now.  I&#39;m <br/>
probably having a harder time with it than she is though.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure exactly how scary you want to get, my kids are a little <br/>
older, but here are some suggestions (I love scary things too):<br/>
<br/>
The Shining (the old one and the new one)<br/>
<br/>
Halloween (the whole series)<br/>
<br/>
Ghost Ship (pretty new)<br/>
<br/>
The Ring (this one&#39;s great! But it&#39;s about a dead little girl, so if <br/>
you think that would bother him....)<br/>
<br/>
Close Encounters of the Third Kind (a little old, but not gorry and <br/>
about aliens) <br/>
<br/>
War of the Worlds (an alien classic)<br/>
<br/>
The Relic (this one scared my husband, but my kids loved it)<br/>
<br/>
Mary Reilly (I LOVED this one, but may be too much blood, no <br/>
monsters, except the human ones)<br/>
<br/>
Fall of the House of Usher (Vincent Price - one of my favorites)<br/>
<br/>
They (about closet monsters - would that be too much for children, <br/>
since they often fear monsters under their beds or in closets? Your <br/>
call)<br/>
<br/>
Resident Evil (about zombies)<br/>

I know that there are a few families on this list who have kids with the same love, and I was wondering if you could give me a few movie and book ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Jaiden is 5 and most of the scary movies that I love tend to be a bit to gory for him, and I&#39;m running into a wall, he doesn&#39;t mind a little blood and guts, (the Mummy and Scorpion King movies are among his faves) but he&#39;s seen them so many times that they don&#39;t scare him. <br/>
<br/>
We have a bunch of the old Godzilla movies and he likes them, and we have thought of trying some of the old horror movies, swampthing, stuff like that, but I never watched them as a kid so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there.<br/>

white horror films with titles like &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman&quot; at the <br/>
libarary that my son (6 yesterady!) enjoyed. There&#39;s a Monster Dot-to-Dot book <br/>
that has been read until it&#39;s in tatters. We picked up an older book at a <br/>
garage sale called Learning About Monsters. Also, I found a line of documentaries <br/>
by DK called Creatures Fantasic that deals with werewolves, vampires, beasts, <br/>
etc...I also have requested the Making of Thriller video from our library <br/>
because my son would love the scene where Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf and <br/>
also because I think he&#39;d enjoy seeing how all the special effects were <br/>
created.<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

We like old Frankenstein movies, (We also love the spoofs like Mel Brooks&#39; <br/>
Young Frankenstein! Moly and Jack will roll around on the ground and ask &quot;Vould <br/>
you like a rroooll in ze hay? Its fun!&quot; or they will act out the Abby Normal <br/>
scene, among others &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t think they quite understand the double meaning <br/>
yet, but that&#39;s okay, it is funny to hear a 7 year old say &quot;What Knockers&quot; and <br/>
hear a 9 year old say &quot;Oh, Doctor.&quot; right in the middle of the grocery <br/>
store!) we also like to watch Twilight Zone. (the old ones) Horror flicks from the <br/>
70&#39;s are great fun to watch as well. Some we like are; Nosferatu the Vampyre, <br/>
Halloween, Dracula, Zombie, The Stepford Wives, Grizzly, The Terror of <br/>
Frankenstein, Lady Frankstein, The Monster Walks, Monster from a Prehistoric Planet... <br/>
Some of those might not be what a 5 year old is looking for though. <br/>
<br/>
We like The Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Godzilla movies are good. <br/>
Others we like are Hitchcock movies like The Man Who Knew too Much with Peter <br/>
Lorre. Boris Karloff&#39;s movies; Frankenstein, Mummy, The Tower of London, and <br/>
Frankenstein from 1970 are all good. The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Abominable <br/>
Dr. Phibes, The Return of Dr. X, all good.<br/>
<br/>
Others include; The Blob (both versions, one with Steve McQueen and the 1988 <br/>
version with Kevin Dillon) Bug (1975), Jaws, It (not the Steven King book <br/>
turned movie, the movie staring Roddy McDowell from 1967) The Adventures of <br/>
Buckaroo Banzi Across the Eighth Dimension (Peter Weller, Jeff Goldboom, Jon <br/>
Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, 1984?), Braindead, The Dark Crystal, Bats, don&#39;t forget <br/>
The Birds (another Hitchcock movie), King Kong (1933), Journey to the Center of <br/>
the Earth, An American Werewolf in London (1981), Creepshow, The Howling, <br/>
Dune, Jason and the Argonauts, Planet of the Apes movies, The Thing from Another <br/>
World, Them!, War of the Worlds, Village of the Damned (1960 version), <br/>
Gremlins, Willow, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, any or all three Quatermass movies, <br/>
Screamers, Dr. Who and the Daleks, and the sequel, Invasion Earth 2150 AD, <br/>
Starship Troopers, Journey to the Center of the Earth. <br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on! &lt;g&gt; You might wonder why I list some of these, but all <br/>
have an element of Monster, Alien, Mutant Bug...  I think most are worth a <br/>
look, even though some, like Willow aren&#39;t really part of the &quot;Horror&quot; genre. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Viewing! <br/>

My kids like scary movies also. They watched Red Dragon and now want to see<br/>
Silence of the Lambs but our video store lost it so we&#39;ll have to check<br/>
elswhere for it. They don&#39;t so much think they are scary as they just like<br/>
that type of movie.<br/>
<br/>
Dangest thing is that they never thought that Jaws was scary ... and they<br/>
saw that when they were much younger. I saw it at 14 and we really were<br/>
afraid to go back in the water! Heck we had trouble sleeping in our own beds<br/>
that night after watching it twice in a row. Now we actually did swim in the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528416217">Newbie jumping in, here. Hi!<br/>
We watched &quot;The Omen&quot; and it&#39;s sequels together. They were always my favourites. The kids (my two older boys Jeremy and Justin, both 12) were, shall we say, less than thrilled. It DID serve to open up a discussion about good vs. evil, God vs. Satan, etc., as well as a short discussion about the Catholic faith and it&#39;s shortcomings (we are non-practising Catholics). They certainly weren&#39;t scared, though. Too much &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;-type desensitization, I think. They expect gore and graphic violence. They didn&#39;t &#39;get&#39; the original &quot;Psycho&quot; until I explained that it was made in such a way that the viewer&#39;s mind did the scaring, rather than the action on the screen. &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and any of the other original horror flicks did nothing close to scaring them. <br/>
They were marginally impressed with &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;, although I wasn&#39;t. LOL.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;The sheeplike tendency of human society soon makes inroads on a child&#39;s unsophistications, and then popular education completes the dastardly work with its systematic formulas, and away goes the individual, hurtling through space into that hateful oblivion of mediocrity. We are pruned into stumps, one resembling another, without character or grace.&quot; --- NC Wyeth, father of Andrew Wyeth, Artist/Painter, who was home educated.<br/>

HAH! That is a good one! And I forgot The Shining, Serpent and the Rainbow, <br/>
and Psycho too. All good psychological &quot;thrillers&quot; where the monster isn&#39;t in <br/>
the room with you, its in your mind! <br/>

This is the kind that I like the best.  I hate the ones that someone runs around killing teenagers for no apparent reason.  I don&#39;t like all the blood and gore, and I would rather be scared in my mind than by what I see on screen.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The first few Freddy Kruegers are good, luckily we all sleep under <br/>
dreamcatchers so I think they helped!!! LOL But last week we saw Freddy vs. Jason and <br/>
boy was it sorry. Don&#39;t waste your time or money on that one! The Texas Chainsaw <br/>
Masacres are all pretty scary and a new version is in the works. A couple <br/>
weeks ago we watched Rob Zombie&#39;s House of a Thousand Corpses, very Texas <br/>
Chainsaw like. Another more recent rental is Darkness Falls, about the evil <br/>
toothfairy, it was decent, my neighbor just said she&#39;s dreading her kids loosing their <br/>
teeth since she watched that!!! She asked if I could do a spell of sorts to <br/>
ward off the bad fairy. I laughed, but later her hubby told me she was serious. <br/>
I told him I had already smudged their house, he had no clue as to what that <br/>
meant, but was thrilled that I love them enough to be proactive! One of my favs <br/>
is not really bloody scary, but rather the religious type scary is the <br/>
Seventh Sign with Demi Moore. Another good one is Steven King&#39;s Pet Cemetary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-977628385">Some of these may have been on the list Joyce sent.  These have been<br/>
favorites of ours.  <br/>
Old movies are great for little kids who might be sensitive to gore,<br/>
because they&#39;re mostly bloodless.  Just a lot of over acting, drama,<br/>
spooky music and stomping monsters. <br/>
<br/>
These have monsters, some are really good Ray Harryhausen monsters, some<br/>
are cheesy rubber suits.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gorgo- 1961<br/>
Reptillicus-1961<br/>
Twenty Million Miles to Earth-1957<br/>
The Beast From Twenty Thousand Fathoms-1953<br/>
Reptilian (newer) 2000?  I think this was first called Yonggary<br/>
Creature from the Black Lagoon-1954<br/>
It Came From Beneath the Sea-1955<br/>
Monster From the Ocean Floor- 1954 <br/>
Attack of the Crab Monsters-1957 <br/>
The Blob-1958<br/>
The Green Slime-1968<br/>
World Without End-1956<br/>
<br/>
These have either a glimpse of a monster, UFO&#39;s, or other cool science<br/>
fiction or thriller bits.  <br/>
<br/>
This Island Earth-1955<br/>
The Fly -1958<br/>
The Day the Earth Stood Still-1951<br/>
Invasion of the Body Snatchers-1956<br/>
<br/>
If he likes the Japanese monster movies like Godzilla he might like War<br/>
of the Gargantuas and Rodan.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131167926">I forgot about the Seventh Sign.  I like the scary movies that are religious because you always wonder if it could possibly be true.  I also liked Children of the Corn.  But--I couldn&#39;t watch the end of Pet Semetary 1.  I knew they had to kill the baby and I just couldn&#39;t watch it.  To this day I&#39;ve never seen the ending.   <br/>
<br/>
If you love Halloween, then you&#39;ve got to visit Salem when you come to next year&#39;s conference.  I&#39;m going Oct 18 this year.  I go every year.<br/>

they just landed in Salem. I lost track of what I was reading as I began to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440355821">My all time favorite scary movie is the original &quot;The Other&quot;.  I have tried unsuccessfully to get it at NetFlix and at our blockbusters.  Anyone ever seen it?  Sooooo psychologically creepy.  &#39;Course, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen it.  I believe it is very different from what I&#39;ve heard about the new one.

Saw that one at a drive-in in the mid-70&#39;s ... spooky and I liked it. It is<br/>
not the same as the Kidman movie &quot;the Others.&quot; It involves two twin boys<br/>
living with an extended family. It was actually on the tv a few weeks ago<br/>
and I was able to see it again.  We liked Kidman&#39;s &quot;The Others&quot; so much we<br/>
saw it in the theater and rented the dvd.<br/>
