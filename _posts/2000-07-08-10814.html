&lt;&lt; OK...mine are toddlers.  So what do you do when you ask them to take care <br/>
of a chore (pickng up a mess of toys, say) and they throw a tantrum and <br/>
refuse?  I try  to get them involved, I make a game of it, I help out, I even <br/>
will tell them that the toy will be in time out for a few days if they cannot <br/>
care for it properly by putting it away when they are done with it.  <br/>
 <br/>
 But they are at the unreasonable and emotionally explosive age when they <br/>
cannot always be talked into something, no matter how sound the reasoning.  <br/>
In the end, I get exponentially more stress and work than if I had just done <br/>
it myself, and they seem to have gotten no easier to convince yet, most of <br/>
the time.  Plus I have a very hyperactive three year old, which complicates <br/>
things all the more.<br/>
 <br/>
 Nanci K&gt;&gt;  Boy, you said it!  My 3 yr old is so difficult these days--loves <br/>
to dump out everything, but it&#39;s like pulling teeth  to get him to help clean <br/>
up.  He will start crying and often throw a tantrum.  It is very frustrating. <br/>
