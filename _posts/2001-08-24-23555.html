<div id="ygrps-yiv-680421625">In this day of hard-to-compete-against large chains and giant on-line <br/>
corporations, it is all too common to hear about another independent <br/>
bookseller closing its doors. When Holt Associates decided they <br/>
needed more time to focus on publishing Growing Without Schooling <br/>
magazine, speaking at conferences, providing homeschooling <br/>
consultations, and publishing books, they decided to look for an <br/>
alternative to closing their twenty-year-old John Holt&#39;s<br/>
Bookstore. <br/>
<br/>
We are pleased to announce that the John Holt&#39;s Bookstore<br/>
operations have been sold to FUN Books effective Aug 1, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
This arrangement is a natural fit for both our companies as over the <br/>
years we have developed an excellent relationship and found that we <br/>
share a similar philosophy. You can now look to FUN Books for the <br/>
best selections from the John Holt&#39;s Bookstore, as well as the<br/>
many other titles we have available. The staff at Holt Associates <br/>
will continue to provide reviews and book recommendations that FUN <br/>
Books will use to make sure we have the &quot;latest and greatest&quot;<br/>
books available for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you recently placed an order with John Holt&#39;s Bookstore, your <br/>
order will now be filled by FUN Books and may already be on its way <br/>
to you! You can place new orders many ways. Order on-line with our <br/>
secure shopping cart at http://www.FUN-Books.com, call or fax orders <br/>
toll-free to 888 FUN-7020, or e-mail orders to orders@... <br/>
You can even mail orders to FUN Books, 1688 Belhaven Woods Ct, <br/>
Pasadena, MD, 21122-3727.</div>
