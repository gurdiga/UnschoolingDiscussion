<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935083849">Beth, on the 2nd you had posted and asked me about what we did &quot;back in the<br/>
dark ages&quot; (my term!) and how we did it.  I wasn&#39;t ignoring you, but have<br/>
been thinking about it all this time (slow thinker :o) !) and asked my<br/>
oldest daughter about it.  She is the coordinator of our state inclusive<br/>
homeschooling organization, HERO (we have a really neat site and chat list--<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oklahomahomeschooling.org">http://www.oklahomahomeschooling.org</a>  Come visit!)  I was feeling kind of<br/>
silly because I couldn&#39;t really tell you what we did or how we did it, but I<br/>
know we did something!<br/>
<br/>
  Here is her response:  We weren&#39;t hooligans, and<br/>
there were family rules.  Being family rules, I mean each<br/>
family has to decide what they will be and how many they need.  We had to<br/>
clean house, keep good hygiene, etc. but we were left to do most of those<br/>
within our own time schedule.  Julie.<br/>
<br/>
And from me, Sandi, I will tell you that the kids pretty much felt like they<br/>
just played all the time, but as<br/>
they have examined how they  go about homeschooling their own children, have<br/>
realized how very much learning was going on all the while.<br/>
<br/>
My grandchildren range in age from 11 down to 8 months, 14 of them.  All but<br/>
two are in homeschooling families, and those two are 2 and a half and 9<br/>
months, so they may decide to down the road.  Julie&#39;s three boys are 9, 8,<br/>
and 4.<br/>

&gt; &gt; your kids schedule their time completely however they wanted to all day<br/>
&gt; long<br/>
&gt; &gt; or what type of rules if any did you have and enforce?<br/>
