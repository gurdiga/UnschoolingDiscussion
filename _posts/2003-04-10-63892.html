&lt;&lt; Quinn has had quite a few things - now that he is nine they<br/>
are almost all gone, except for the &quot;th&quot; sometimes, and I know this will<br/>
disappear when he is reading and sees how words are spelled. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a hard time with &quot;r&quot; and I think she was seven or eight (anyone <br/>
remember or save the more current reports?) when she pressed me to get her a <br/>
therapist.  Luckily, I know three personally so casually arranged them to <br/>
hang out with her (one already goes to folksinging parties we go to) and <br/>
advise us.   We took one to lunch, and she joked with Holly and found out <br/>
what she was interested in, loaned us a game and gave her an exercise, about <br/>
Roger Rabbit&#39;s buried treasure.     <br/>
<br/>
When Holly started reading, everything was really fine, then, because r&#39;s she <br/>
hadn&#39;t distinguished earlier were visible, and she had practiced the sound, <br/>
and it all came together, when she was tenish.<br/>

Jaiden has trouble with &quot;S&quot; followed by a hard sound. <br/>

<br/>
Tahts what we figured with Jaiden was as he grew into his mouth and began reading he&#39;d grow out of it. If it&#39;s still there in 5-6 years we&#39;ll look into then.<br/>
<br/>
We have to keep telling our friends and family   to stop correcting him about it. He get really upset, he knows what he&#39;s saying and is saying it the best he can and gets angry that people start making him say it over and over.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son Jacob has trouble with r too but  I have noticed when he reads a word<br/>
with r in it he takes more time to sound it out. I figure he will master it<br/>
eventually. He grunted until he was three and I had lots of people tell me<br/>
he would need speech therapy. I didn&#39;t take him, and at about three and a<br/>
half he started talking fairly fluently.<br/>
