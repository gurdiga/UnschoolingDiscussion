<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714251194">NHEN (nhen.org) has developed as another source of information for themedia <br/>
about homeschooling.  It includes people of every stripe, including HSLDA <br/>
members.    <br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The National Home Education Network exists to encourage and facilitate the <br/>
&gt; vital grassroots work of state and localÂ  homeschooling groups and <br/>
&gt; individuals by providing information, fostering networking and promoting <br/>
&gt; public relations on a national level. Because we believe there is strength <br/>
&gt; in a diverse network of homeschoolers, we support the freedom of all <br/>
&gt; individual families to choose home education and to direct such education. <br/>

Re: HSLDA<br/>
From the HSLDA application:<br/>
BY SIGNING THIS APPLICATION, WE AGREE:<br/>
[snip]2 . To use a clearly organized program of education to instruct <br/>
ourchildren.[snip]<br/>
I think that pretty much eliminates unschoolers.  You are also asked to<br/>
list the hours of instruction.  Here is the link if you want to view the <br/>
whole  application!:<br/>

<br/>
I understand from another list I am on that they have refused unschoolers in <br/>
the past.<br/>
