<div id="ygrps-yiv-746033391">Andrew (7) is VERY much into art.  So we signed up for a local homeschool art <br/>
class.  It&#39;s a 6 week session, once a week.  We are getting our feet wet with <br/>
local homeschoolers.  I know no one right now, homeschool or unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this class is held in a church or fellowship hall, I guess?  It is <br/>
Unitarian Universalist.  We don&#39;t go to church.  Andrew has been to a few <br/>
vacation Bible school days with friends.  He wants to go to this church.  He has <br/>
asked what UU means.  I have read the literature but I am seeking more personal <br/>
info. from UU&#39;s and/or those who know more about it.  I don&#39;t want my hubby&#39;s <br/>
and my preferences to influence him without a fair chance for him to see what&#39;s <br/>
what.  <br/>
<br/>
We read Bible stories and read his actual Bible.  We all enjoy it.  But he <br/>
has never asked to go back to the church&#39;s he has been in with friends.  We have <br/>
only been to this church 3 times and only for his art class and he really <br/>
doesn&#39;t know anyone, but he has an interest in being there more often.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can lend some info., I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.  Feel free to email <br/>
off list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe there are a fair number of UUs on the list :-)<br/>
<br/>
Its roots are Christian and, at least on the East Coast, the services have<br/>
the same structure as mainline Protestant, but it&#39;s now a liberal church<br/>
based on humanist principles.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it&#39;s a place where anyone regardless of religious beliefs can get<br/>
together with others who agree with the 7 principles:<br/>
<br/>
*    The inherent worth and dignity of every person;<br/>
*    Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;<br/>
*    Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our<br/>
congregations; <br/>
*    A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;<br/>
*    The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within<br/>
our congregations and in society at large;<br/>
*    The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;<br/>
*    Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a<br/>
part. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter says she likes it because &quot;They don&#39;t tell you what to believe.&quot;<br/>
;-)<br/>

We &quot;signed the book&quot; at a UU here in Augusta almost a year ago. I <br/>
like it for the most part. I love the CUUPS group here and am active <br/>
with them. (That&#39;s the pagan group for those that wouldn&#39;t know that)<br/>
I like the RE classes here, (religious ed) the thing I like the best <br/>
about them is that the kids are being exposed to what different <br/>
groups of people believe without being told, &quot;this is the one true <br/>
way&quot; while learning about those beliefs. My son&#39;s class is learning <br/>
about Jewish holidays and beliefs(K-1 age group) and my daughters is <br/>
learning about different types of eco systems and how animals live <br/>
in different parts of the world. <br/>
Last week the &quot;sermon&quot; was on evolution. Not about how it was wrong, <br/>
but about how it makes sense. I was able to buy a couple of books <br/>
from these people for the kids. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.earthethics.com/born_with_a_bang.htm">http://www.earthethics.com/born_with_a_bang.htm</a> was one of the books.<br/>

these were the people that came and did a sermon as well as a <br/>
seminar that I really enjoyed on the subject. <br/>
I didn&#39;t agree with everything they had to say, but it was certainly <br/>
refreshing to hear someone speak on the subject without ignoring a <br/>
lot of scientific stuff that points to evolution. <br/>
ANyway, I&#39;m rambling. If you want my take on UU&#39;s in more detail, <br/>
let me know. Probably ought to take this one off list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775737680">Most UU churches will also have a UU 101 type of class that is quite <br/>
good. They also usually provide childcare onsite for younger kids, <br/>
as well as munchies or lunch in the deal too. <br/>
No pressure to join, just offering information. :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As an unschooler, I find this to be my *unchurch* - it&#39;s spirituality as <br/>
it works for YOU, without dogma nor creed telling you what you MUST <br/>
believe, all in the context of 7 principles which include &quot;respect for <br/>
the interdependent web of existence of which we are all a part.&quot;  A <br/>
search for personal Truth is the keystone to the principles on which the <br/>
faith is founded (this connection really clicked when I heard Ben <br/>
Lovejoy speak about Rules vs Principles) see: uua.org <br/>
I had a scrap of paper with some notes from the RE director... aarrgghh <br/>
lost now, but it said something like: Love is our faith, Quest for Truth <br/>
is our dogma, Service is our prayer.  The kids say a little poem: We <br/>
light this candle to celebrate Unitarian Universalism; this is the <br/>
church of the open mind, this is the church of the loving heart, this is <br/>
the church of the helping hands, this is the world of which we&#39;re all <br/>
part.  Our symbol, the flaming chalice, came about during WWII, so our <br/>
service groups in Europe could be identified by people in need. <br/>
This said, unschooling (homeschooling at all, for that matter) is not <br/>
automatically understood nor accepted by everyone of this faith... The <br/>
democratic process is an important aspect of our principles, some feel <br/>
we are removing ourselves from the process by removing our children from <br/>
state-provided education.  (Very funny that last year&#39;s L&L conference <br/>
was held in the city named for the UU family who firmly established <br/>
institutional education for all American children)<br/>
As a religion, we are just exploring ways to support our homeschooling <br/>
members.  Last year, there was an article about time together as a <br/>
family, in our UU World Magazine... the author made some nasty remark <br/>
about homeschoolers and their &quot;family beds and macrobiotic diets,&quot; which <br/>
caused a big stir including letters from homeschoolers who presented <br/>
their lifestyles as a means to have more family time.  This was quickly <br/>
followed with an article about the &quot;newly-discovered&quot; UU Homeschoolers <br/>
(and the token &quot;it didn&#39;t work for us&quot; family). <br/>
It&#39;s an exciting time to be involved in this church... a growing, <br/>
thriving, unafraid of change establishment!  (It was the teen youth <br/>
groups  from the Unitarian and Universalism Churches, in the 60s, who <br/>
began the process of combining both religions into one -- children are <br/>
given their vote at age 12, when they voluntarily sign the membership book)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It feels good to be in *God&#39;s House* and discover it&#39;s actually comfy <br/>
and accepting,  instead of scary and domineering. <br/>
The Bible is fun to read and to explore.  It&#39;s freeing for ME to read <br/>
these stories with the kids and allow them to find their own meaning and <br/>
truth (if any) instead of repeating what I was told these stories mean <br/>
by people I never completely trusted. <br/>
Hannah really wants to think that all churches are as accepting of <br/>
diversity of beliefs as ours is... it&#39;s a tough lesson to discover <br/>
they&#39;re not! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855033465">The &#39;creed&#39; recited at every one of our UU services goes like this:<br/>
<br/>
Love is the doctrine of this congregation<br/>
The quest for truth is its sacrament<br/>
And service is its prayer<br/>
To dwell together in peace<br/>
To seek knowledge in freedom<br/>
To serve humanity in fellowship<br/>
To the end that all souls shall grow into harmony with the divine<br/>
Thus do we covenant with each other and with God<br/>
<br/>
(my husband, the neo-kemetic pagan says &quot;and with the gods...&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. Perhaps that&#39;s what inspired those RE notes.<br/>
<br/>
I like the description of UUism as an unchurch. :)<br/>
<br/>
To bring this around to unschooling; I am a RE &quot;teacher&quot; about once a <br/>
month for 7-9 year olds at our UU congregation. And I currently really <br/>
dislike it. The curriculum is inane (teaching &quot;social justice&quot; as <br/>
envisioned by a bunch of middle aged people with no children), the kids <br/>
aren&#39;t really very happy there, and I&#39;d really love to find a way to <br/>
make it more engaging.  My Kwanzaa party with them was fun. Perhaps <br/>
more of that and a less forced, scripted interaction. Not used to <br/>
having 30 children in a room at once...it&#39;s not my ideal environment, <br/>
and I want to make it more worthwhile for them and me.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
I&#39;ll volunteer to do this again next year, but in the meantime I&#39;d love <br/>
to hear suggestions from you lovely folk about ways to enrich this <br/>
experience now.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Joyce, I&#39;m betting there are quite a few UU&#39;s on this list and like Dianna <br/>
said, to me, UUism is like the &quot;unchurch&quot;. I&#39;ve met people from so many different <br/>
religious backgrounds who found their way to UUism because they wanted a place <br/>
where they could explore and experience spirituality and religion on their own terms <br/>
and form their own definitions of those things and how they fit into their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll have to just try it out and see if it&#39;s a fit for you. A lot will depend on the size <br/>
and demographics of the congregation, the minister, and the RE director and what <br/>
their priorities are, but I think that you will find a striving for tolerance and diveristy <br/>
in any UU Fellowship you explore. <br/>
<br/>
Because your son has expressed an interest in knowing more about it, I highly <br/>
recommend you try it out--personally, I think that UUism is great place for children <br/>
(and adults) to learn about different religions and different religious beliefs in a <br/>
supportive, tolerant and in my experience, a non-didactic, environment--talk with <br/>
the RE Director about the (dare I say it?)--&quot;curriculum&quot; for this year and next and <br/>
what their goals are in that area.  <br/>
<br/>
I do suggest that you attend at least four services, because depending on the church <br/>
they can vary widely from week to week depending on how much lay ministry there <br/>
might be, the time of year, etc. Also, if they offer an intro dinner, potluck, or <br/>
workshop I would look into it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;I ran a political activism intro for apprentices in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my union geared at offering opporunities to do<br/>
volunteer political work. Although they weren&#39;t the<br/>
same ages as the kids you&#39;re teaching, most were<br/>
coming right from NYC public high schools and were, it<br/>
seemed, used to be &#39;talked at&#39;. Part of being able to<br/>
serve the members effectively was (for me)asking what<br/>
was important/petinent to them, and they were shocked<br/>
and delighted that I prioritized what they wanted and<br/>
needed. <br/>
<br/>
Can you ask the kids what they want out of your class?<br/>
 Why are they there? as part of a greater religious<br/>
instruction program or a seperate class? I assume that<br/>
many are coerced into going by their parents?  What do<br/>
they think social justice is and should be about? <br/>
Could you ask the kids to offer ideas for different<br/>
projects or activities (not even necessarily related<br/>
to &#39;social justice&#39;, just what they&#39;d like to do) and<br/>
take a vote?  You could use the whole &#39;voting&#39; thing<br/>
to talk about democracy and how in a democracy<br/>
majority rules, but that doesn&#39;t mean that everyone<br/>
will be happy with the result and is this &#39;fair&#39;, or<br/>
what have you.  This way, if everyone voted to square<br/>
dance or do some other seemingly non social justice<br/>
activity, you could justify it to the parents or<br/>
whomever else might have some issues with giving kids<br/>
that degree of freedom ;)<br/>
<br/>
Your church sounds cool - I&#39;d really be interested to<br/>
know what a curriculum for teaching 7 -9 yo about<br/>
social justice looks like.  If you haven&#39;t already,<br/>
you might try reading John Holt&#39;s &quot;Instead of<br/>
Education&quot; - an amazing book with some incredible<br/>
insights on &quot;teaching&quot;.<br/>
