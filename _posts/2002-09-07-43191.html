<div id="ygrps-yiv-267786972">Ok - This is getting way too distorted for me -<br/>
<br/>
My original post (intro - long) included a line about my kids squabbling - fighting, disagreeing - I forget the exact word used - but what I was - and still am trying to address is the typical every day squabbles that kids get into.  Not some DOMESTIC VIOLENCE issue - give me a break already - talk abt an extreme and twisted version of the original post!  My kids are 5 and 8 for God&#39;s sake!  We&#39;re not talking domestic violence - GET IT?<br/>
 <br/>
What I said and still stand by is I don&#39;t take sides - I don&#39;t teach my kids a victim mentality - i.e., laying blame and excepting no responsibility for a situation. (And no Sandra - I did not say your kids have that mentality.  I don&#39;t know you or your kids!) Quite frankly I don&#39;t need you passing judgment on me and mine or making a childhood squabble into a friggin&#39; domestic violence issue.<br/>
<br/>
Quit twisting and turning my original and subsequent posts into some kind of ultra-violent situation going on!  For the couple of folks who offered an author or book recommendation - Thank you.  That is what I was seeking in addition to needing to vent some steam after several VERY hot days the stretched little tempers to the snapping point on one to many occassions.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s the bottom line - I withdraw my post abt squabble in the interest of my own sanity and peoples delete fingers growing exhausted by this ridiculous escalation.  From a childhood squabble to a domestic violence issue - Wow! Who would have ever thought it could happen?  If the rest of you want to carry on with the topic - so be it - I will be using the delete key from this point forward.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am under the impression that this is an online support group for unschooling minded homeschoolers.  In the past few days I&#39;ve seen cheap shots taken at Christian homeschoolers and others and seen words twisted into an unrecognizable form - my own and others.  There extremists in every avenue of education - ps, private, homeschool, school at home, unschoolers, etc. etc.  In fact, that can be said about virtually any topic of life.  I just didn&#39;t think this was an extremists forum, because that is in many instances how it is feeling to me.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I sincerely need an answer to this question  - What exactly is the role of this list....because maybe I&#39;m the one in the wrong place?<br/>

<br/>
When I try to think of a way to resolve an issue or what general, <br/>
underlying, philosophy to use, I often think about how it would apply <br/>
in an extreme situation or in the world outside of our family <br/>
context.  For instance, I don&#39;t say &quot;Hitting is no way to solve a <br/>
problem.&quot;  because in the rest of the world, in families that spank <br/>
and in dictators who want more power, hitting and violence do help <br/>
them get what they want (solve a problem).  I do say &quot;I don&#39;t think <br/>
hitting is the best way to solve a problem and in this house hitting <br/>
is not ok.&quot;  I have told my children it is ok to hit in <br/>
self-defense or to protect others but I have also told them it is <br/>
never ok to hit (in the context of a sqabble with each other--<br/>
although I didn&#39;t make that clear to them).  Sandra&#39;s point about not <br/>
saying to never hit helped me to see that I was sending a mixed <br/>
message. <br/>

<br/>
Again, take this to an extreme.  If your bil was beating your sister <br/>
would you tell her to accept her part of the responsibility (that is <br/>
how many women stay in these situations) or would you tell her that <br/>
her husband was wrong and to get out?  Isn&#39;t the latter taking sides? <br/>
If it were me, I would tell her to get out.  After she was safely <br/>
away, I might ask her to examine why she allowed herself to be <br/>
treated that way and to work on figuring out a way to make better <br/>
choices in the future.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Nobody was turning *your* situation into an ultra-violent extreme.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- So here&#39;s the bottom line - I withdraw my post abt squabble -=-<br/>
<br/>
Too late.  Once you say something you can&#39;t take it back.  That&#39;s <br/>
another thing I try to tell my children to help them be mindful of <br/>
what they say to others.  I tell them they can change their mind or <br/>
clarify or apolgize tho.  Someone said--I don&#39;t remember who-- that <br/>
they don&#39;t get involved with their children&#39;s arguements and leave <br/>
them to work it out for themselves.  I think that is a lot to ask of <br/>
children.  My son, seemingly, isn&#39;t as hurt by words as his sister <br/>
is. How will come to understand the difference in their sensibilities <br/>
if no one bothers to point this out to him?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- I will be using the delete key from this point forward.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your choice but isn&#39;t that avoidance?  And aren&#39;t you failing to <br/>
accept your part of the responsibility for this squabble?<br/>

<br/>
I doubt that you&#39;re suggesting that violence in adults has no roots in their <br/>
upbringing, experiences or frustrations.<br/>
<br/>
And when the police are called because neighbors can hear arguing, the <br/>
neighbors call either because it&#39;s disturbing their peace (legitimate <br/>
complaint) or because they&#39;re afraid it could turn violent (as I called when <br/>
my neighbor was yelling full-throat at 6:30 in the morning, &quot;Do you WANT me <br/>
to hit you?  I think you just WANT me to hit you!&quot;), the police call that, <br/>
legally, &quot;A domestic disturbance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s described as a &quot;squabble,&quot; if it has any violence or fear or <br/>
continuance, and if it&#39;s possible that it could turn violent (which any <br/>
argument could in an instant), that is the same as &quot;a domestic disturbance,&quot; <br/>
which is one action removed from &quot;domestic violence.&quot;  <br/>
