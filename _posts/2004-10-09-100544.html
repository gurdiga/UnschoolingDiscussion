<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953618722"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Maybe you could very gently talk to the people that you get &gt;gifts <br/>
&gt;from, and tell them that there are some things that the kids &gt;really <br/>
&gt;want to do that you really can&#39;t afford, and what the kids and &gt;you <br/>
&gt;really really want and even need, is for them to help out in &gt;that <br/>
&gt;direction. Also, you could mention that if they are paying for &gt;a set <br/>
&gt;of lessons, that it is going to be something that the kids are<br/>
&gt;genuinely thankful for way past Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sounds ideal. :)  i think i&#39;ve been attempting this method of going about<br/>
it for the past three years (at least) to no avail.  last year, my oldest<br/>
was in a super expensive dance class and she wanted to continue into the<br/>
spring, but we couldn&#39;t afford anymore (especially with the recital<br/>
costume fee coming due as well.)  we appealed to the g-parents with this<br/>
plea and also a suggestion that she had expressed interest in a violin &<br/>
lessons.  the IL&#39;s begrudgingly gave us some cash for the costume, but<br/>
made it clear that they had no intention of *supporting us*...they think<br/>
dh shouldn&#39;t have ever taken the life route he has (not finishing<br/>
college, marrying me, and having kids) and are really unsupportive of a<br/>
lot of our choices.  they particularly feel like we&#39;re dumb to struggle<br/>
financially when dh *could* opt to drive OTR semi&#39;s and make a nice<br/>
living (and therefore, never be home again), or, at the very least, *i*<br/>
should have a job by now with the kids being old enough (6,4, &2?!) <br/>
anyways, they see giving these sorts of things to the kids as supporting<br/>
our *lazy lifestyle* and just won&#39;t do it.  my mom helped out a little,<br/>
but just doesn&#39;t have enough to sponsor a whole session of anything.  and<br/>
that&#39;s all of the people we have who give gifts to the kids.  so, we<br/>
ended up being able to struggle through the rest of the year with the<br/>
dance class, but then we took a bit to recover from the expense and we<br/>
couldn&#39;t have afforded anything for anyone else.  <br/>
<br/>
in my perfect world, i could access talented people and trade services<br/>
for lessons.  it kills me how something as simple as my dd&#39;s class was<br/>
could cost so much.  the teacher&#39;s weren&#39;t exceptionally good with kids<br/>
and it was a very high pressure scene for a bunch of 4-5 year olds.  i<br/>
don&#39;t have a clue what the appeal was.  for my dd, she just wants to flit<br/>
around with other kids in pretty costumes.  i&#39;m not looking to train her<br/>
in ballet.  <br/>
<br/>
so, that&#39;s our gripe for the day :)<br/>

Sorry about that!  I would make the same choice you are, to stay home <br/>
and live on less money for more family time.  (In fact, I think we are <br/>
doing that. :-)  )<br/>
<br/>
I would personally be fine with taking their Xmas presents and <br/>
exchanging them for cash, or something that you need, and then taking <br/>
the &quot;found money&quot; and applying it to lessons.  But I know that that&#39;s an <br/>
unconventional approach and probably sounds tacky.   (I&#39;m a little riled <br/>
up about their negative attitude towards your choices.)<br/>
<br/>
I have seen people swap baby-sitting or book-keeping services for <br/>
lessons.  And there might be other ways to barter, if you check around.  <br/>
Do any parks and recreation services charge on a sliding scale?<br/>

altogether stopped buying things for any of us since.  i would feel bad<br/>
trying to do this with the things my mom or the IL&#39;s buy because they&#39;re<br/>
in town and give the gifts personally.  besides, now that the kids are<br/>
older, i&#39;m not sure how to work out convincing them to return these<br/>
gifts.  i guess it&#39;d have to be their choice.  and all of this is very<br/>
dependent on the distinct possibility that nothing will have tags or<br/>
receipts.  <br/>

that bridge when it comes up (our kids are 6 1/2, 4, &2.)  i know that<br/>
the YMCA offers special low income rates, but i haven&#39;t heard a lot of<br/>
good from the h.s.er&#39;s who have attended those classes, so i&#39;m hesitant<br/>
to even bother.  my kids want laid back types of things where they can<br/>
feel free to participate or not.  that&#39;s pretty hard (if not impossible)<br/>
to find. any ideas for this sort of more freeform classes??<br/>

Hi, Lisa --<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who teaches group music lessons to kids 3-4 and 5-6.  <br/>
When she first started teaching, her youngest child needed babysitting, <br/>
so she gave free lessons to a friend&#39;s daughter in exchange for the <br/>
babysitting.  But, you are right, there was already a personal <br/>
relationship there.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was in gymnastics, I know that there was one mom at the gym <br/>
doing receptionist and other office work in exchange for lessons.  I&#39;ve <br/>
heard of kids who are really into something like dance, that after <br/>
several years can be helpers with classes for younger kids, and they <br/>
usually get a break on their tuition if they do that.<br/>
<br/>
My kid doesn&#39;t really like classes.<br/>
<br/>
Did you post that your daughter just wants to twirl around in a costume <br/>
with other kids?  Because maybe you could buy up some extra costumes <br/>
after Halloween and just invite a few kids over for a twirling date.  <br/>
And you could do it more than once.  (I don&#39;t really like classes <br/>
myself, either.  I think they can be over-rated.)<br/>
<br/>
** i know that<br/>

to even bother.**<br/>
<br/>
My son played indoor hockey for two session at the Y and I thought that <br/>
their emphasis on participation and sportsmanship was really nice.  We <br/>
only gave up because he got tired of being hit in the shins with a <br/>
hockey stick!  But I have no idea about the quality of dance <br/>
instruction.  (Which is of course going to vary according to the talent <br/>
of each teacher.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709059339"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My kid doesn&#39;t really like classes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i&#39;m not sure if mine do either or if they just think they should!  seems<br/>
like all the other kids in our homeschool group attend various classes,<br/>
so maybe they see it as being a way to be like someone they look up to? <br/>
my daughter also romanticizes the idea of being a ballerina (as so many<br/>
young girls do), but when she goes to class, seems disappointed that her<br/>
idea and the teacher&#39;s way of running the class aren&#39;t the same.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Did you post that your daughter just wants to twirl around in &gt;a costume<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this would, again, be ideal in my mind.  the problem comes directly where<br/>
you say *invite a few kids over.*  she doesn&#39;t have but a couple friends<br/>
and they&#39;re all pretty busy, in school, and/or live quite a distance<br/>
away.  i wish we could find a way to get her the purely social play time<br/>
with other kids more organically than by attending the homeschool group<br/>
outings since they all end up being less than we all are looking for.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lol...i can imagine that isn&#39;t a ton of fun!  i don&#39;t think they have any<br/>
dance classes at the Y here...more like soccer and swimming and stuff<br/>
like that.  <br/>
<br/>
my aversion to the Y at this point stems from a conversation i overheard<br/>
at our last group get together.  a dad was talking about this kid on his<br/>
daughter&#39;s team who *just wouldn&#39;t move* on the soccer field, etc. they<br/>
were really trashing this poor kid who was too shy to get into the game. <br/>
keep in mind that his daughter&#39;s just turned 5.  my kids are all the slow<br/>
to warm up, shy variety and i&#39;d hate to enroll them into a group that<br/>
pushes them to be who they&#39;re not.  i guess i have to get over trying to<br/>
protect my kids from this sort of situation.  i mean, really, it&#39;s me<br/>
anticipating a potentially traumatic outcome from something that probably<br/>
won&#39;t happen. :)  i&#39;m sure it has a ton to do with my own embarrassment<br/>
as a child...not being as coordinated as i&#39;d like.  if my daughter<br/>
expresses interest, maybe i&#39;ll look into signing her up and let her be<br/>
the guide.  but i don&#39;t feel the need to toss the idea her way.  i&#39;m not<br/>
sure we could afford it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
anyhow...thanks for the ideas!  i guess i have some more research and<br/>
soul-searching to do. :)<br/>
