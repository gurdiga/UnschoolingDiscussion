<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984659048">I&#39;ve posted on a few message boards at parentsplace.com<br/>
They have boards for Tons of topics: maybe some suggestions for dealing with <br/>
parents....<br/>
There&#39;s also an unschooling message board-not very active; rather new, I <br/>
think.<br/>
And their much less intense than e-mail loops:  my dh (dear hubby) saw that <br/>
I had 135 new messages and about had a cow!  (oh yeah, he can spend 3 hours <br/>
playing his &quot;robot game&quot; on the computer, but if I take 1-2 hours to go thru <br/>
mail....OH the insanityyyyyyy&quot;)<br/>
Have a Great Night!<br/>
