<div id="ygrps-yiv-564706913">We would like to remind you of this upcoming event.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude is Everything! <br/>
<br/>
Date: Saturday, December 18, 2004 <br/>
Time: All Day<br/>
<br/>
If you say, &quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; then there&#39;s a good chance you won&#39;t.<br/>
However, if you say &quot;I can,&quot; there&#39;s an excellent chance you<br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
Take a few moments to think about how wonderful it&#39;s going to be<br/>
when you get that bedroom organized, or when you empty out that<br/>
first box that has been sitting there for the past year.<br/>
<br/>
Dream about what you&#39;re going to do with all the extra time<br/>
you&#39;re going to gain, simply by getting organized.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769369188">Okay - that was dumb of me. I was just playing with the calendar <br/>
function of the list, trying to figure out exactly how event listings <br/>
work - and it turns out I put something in JUST exactly at the time it <br/>
was set to send reminders to the list, so it sent the thing I was using <br/>
as a test.<br/>
<br/>
So - ignore the &quot;reminder of this upcoming event&quot; - there IS no event.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re wondering what the content was - it was just something I <br/>
copied from somewhere else - I was trying to figure out exactly how the <br/>
&quot;MotivatedMoms&quot; people have automated sending out a daily email to a <br/>
yahoogroups list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026120001">See, I just thought it was a day we should all either empty a box, organize a <br/>
room, or stop whining! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
And attitude isn&#39;t everything, really, when it comes to cleaning.  Some of it <br/>
is actually physically moving stuff around.  But that&#39;s not my problem; my <br/>
problem is when I touch something I haven&#39;t touched for &quot;the past year&quot; (or <br/>
years) I remember what I was supposed to have done with it, what I wish I could do <br/>
with it, who I meant to give it to, and then I put it in a different pile.  <br/>
So that attitude I&#39;ve come to like is that I&#39;m glad the roof isn&#39;t leaking on <br/>
my important piles of stuff. I&#39;m glad we have enough clothes that some can sit <br/>
clean on the couch for days before I get around to folding them.  I&#39;m glad we <br/>
have enough dishes that even if the sink is overflowing with dirties, people <br/>
can find a clean plate and glass and spoon.<br/>
<br/>
I guess attitude IS everything!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845519163">I just forwarded that to someone else.  I thought it WAS intentional and really cool -  a reminder to think positively and take even one step towards accomplishing a goal.  (After I figured out that it wasn&#39;t an actual workshop.)<br/>
