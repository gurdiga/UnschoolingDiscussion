<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141360428">Im a lurker and have posted before about my teen girls.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway my DS playes, wii, ds,computer games and watches tv most of his day. we have to read all the words and story lines to him all the time, which becomes a bit  too much. He is exposed to words and reading all the time. im not even starting to try and &quot;teach&quot; him to read, as he want nothing to do with the letters and alphabets. My question is &#39;Does a person need to know the alphabet to learn to read? i know everyone learns differently as ive seen with my girls, they were taught the alphabet in school so when i started homeschooling they already had a foundation in phonics and letters?  which i thought at the time contributed to them reading...but now that im unschooling them and my 6yr old i need to rethink about alphabet,letters. I want to start equipping myself with knowledge about  it. please send me links on this subject.<br/>
<br/>
Also i want to know how can i make our lives more sparkly and light and joyfull and fun. what is a creative way to connect to the people in our neighborhood? and maybe to start a group. any ideas please...<br/>
<br/>
im afraid our life has become a bit boring and depressing and i have a mind block on how to have fun and help my kids find life very exiting....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Susan</div>

naturally drawn to whatever they need to figure out a pattern. If a  <br/>
child needs the alphabet, they&#39;ll be interested in it. Trust that  <br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it&#39;s important for unschooling to flow well to have lots of  <br/>
different resources -- including video games :-) As you get to know  <br/>
your kids better, you will be able to narrow down what&#39;s likely to  <br/>
appeal. But variety is good. They don&#39;t know what&#39;s available in the  <br/>

Many people learn to read by sight. They absorb words whole. It&#39;s only  <br/>
later after they&#39;ve accumulated hundreds and hundreds of examples that  <br/>
they can see or be interested in the parts that make the words up.<br/>
<br/>
Schools can&#39;t support that method. They need to test kids&#39;  <br/>
understanding regularly. And they can&#39;t test when kids are absorbing  <br/>
whatever random words that fascinate them. Which is why it&#39;s important  <br/>
to see that schools don&#39;t use the &quot;best&quot; teaching methods. They use  <br/>

It&#39;s not that teachers want that. They do want kids to understand! But  <br/>
they&#39;re confined to methods that can be tested.<br/>

My kids watched Sesame Street and they had funny songs and skits about letters all the time in those days (maybe still).  I used to sing the alphabet to them when they were babies just as I sang other songs.  And on Sesame street they would have guest stars sing or say the alphabet in different ways.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953195704">I think looking at the alphabet as foundational to reading is exactly the<br/>
same as looking at addition (or building up from a base) as foundational to<br/>
sculpture. Sculpture however is also found objects (whole objects) and<br/>
subtraction (removing layers to get underneath). Reading is the same. It can<br/>
be approached in several different ways. By different individuals. As well<br/>
as by the same person.<br/>
<br/>
Schooling gets in the way of learning to read by insisting things like that<br/>
learning the alphabet is foundational to reading. It isn&#39;t. You can pick it<br/>
up in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
I was very much drawn to fonts and shapes of whole words. I love calligraphy<br/>
because it can reveal the &quot;body&quot; of a word&#39;s unique shape. The Chi Ro book<br/>
(Book of Kell) is so amazing because no matter how falsely colored or even<br/>
uncolored it is, the shape of those famous words is instantly recognizable.<br/>
Because I am drawn to word shapes I can spell words very easily. If the<br/>
shape is wrong I know it&#39;s misspelled. The word &quot;the&quot; is perfect but not if<br/>
you switch the letters around and change the shape to &quot;teh&quot; which is nothing<br/>
like the same shape even though it has the same exact letters.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say the biggest reason I might be drawn to whole words is not because I<br/>
don&#39;t understand the alphabet but because I&#39;m better at recognizing things<br/>
that are whole than recognizing pieces of them or their sequences. When I<br/>
get to the sequence portions in IQ tests, I can remember sequences by<br/>
recalling the whole shape, if that&#39;s the way they&#39;re presented. Otherwise, I<br/>
have a harder time remembering the order things come in and I slow way way<br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
Phonics was hard for me because I don&#39;t hear well and also because English<br/>
varies what you can do with a single letter QUITE a bit. Not a total loss<br/>
but not the most helpful way for me to learn either. I remember intonation,<br/>
phrasing and speed in people&#39;s voices very well and can often pick out who&#39;s<br/>
speaking because it&#39;s like hearing the shape of a person&#39;s voice. Again,<br/>
it&#39;s easiest for me to learn things by experiencing the whole thing, at<br/>
least at first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622317646">One great, related thing they do on Sesame Street now is have celebrities introduce a new word, sort of by acting it out. <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorites is Maggie Gyllenhaal telling us that &quot;A surprise is when something happens that you don&#39;t expect.&quot; And then a bunch of monsters surprise her, and they check to see whether a second surprise works when you do it again right after the first one. <br/>
<br/>
In very short clips, they really get across the connotations of some words that are a little more complex. <br/>

David Beckham and Elmo talk about Persistence: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq4wrPL1o4s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq4wrPL1o4s</a><br/>

When I google &quot;sesame street persistent&quot; and then click the top YouTube clip result, the Youtube page offers a whole long right column of these word skits. Kobe Bryant does Miniature; LL Cool J does Unanimous; Heidi Klum does Compliment.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&#39;Does a person need to know the alphabet to learn to read?**************<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Six is still pretty young to be reading or even starting to read. It has become a cultural phenomenon to push the alphabet at kids really early, but knowing the alphabet at 3 doesn&#39;t guarantee reading at 6. Knowing the alphabet doesn&#39;t necessarily contribute to learning to read. It can even get in the way. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson and a friend of mine&#39;s daughter both found paying attention to letters and sounds got in the way of reading when they were first learning (homeschooling, not unschooling). I remember watching Ray puzzle his way through a word and then not remember that word by the time he&#39;d puzzled his way through the next - but he could read short sentences if he recognized the words already. My girlfriend saw something similar with her daughter, but even more so - she could read whole sentences but not all the individual words in them, and couldn&#39;t identify all the letters. Both kids could &quot;decode&quot; words using letter-sound correspondences *after* they had learned to read, but not before. <br/>
<br/>
Morgan, otoh, fell in love with the alphabet and reading at 4 and had a wonderful time cracking the code. By then I&#39;d found unschooling and was pretty awe-struck to see her spend hours sounding-out short books, going back and correcting herself when a word didn&#39;t make sense in context... just like teachers tell people the &quot;should&quot; do, but no-one was teaching Mo. It was just the most logical way for her to get what she wanted. <br/>
<br/>
Once she cracked the code (a few months) she dropped reading for a couple years. That&#39;s something else that you lose sight of with schoolish thinking - learning doesn&#39;t depend on some kind of steady progress and regular practice, necessarily. For a few months, Mo read, then stopped, then picked it up again later. <br/>
<br/>
If you want books about how reading happens naturally, a reasonably good one is &quot;Literacy Through Play&quot;. Its set in an open-classroom sort of environment, but it does a good job of laying out all the different factors that go into developing *literacy* which may be helpful if you&#39;re getting bogged down in &quot;reading&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55276520">In general, about knowing the alphabet, we sang a lot when the kids were little and I sang the alphabet to babies, when there were toddlers around, so they could sing with me, and sang it to Kirby when he was an only.  I figured if it was just one of the many songs he knew, he would have that information in him.  <br/>
<br/>
When he was a walking baby still in diapers, we visited a La Leche League leader&#39;s home--not the leader of my group, but there was a gathering and we were over there.  He was pointing at the magnetic letters on the fridge and naming some of them.   Kathy, the hostess, squatted down next to him and he named a few more.  She asked him what his name was an how old he was.  He looked at her and thought, and then turned back and pointed at &quot;M&quot; and said  &quot;M&quot; very clearly.  He was too little to know how old he was, and he couldn&#39;t say his name clearly yet.  He said &quot;Turby&quot; for years.<br/>
<br/>
I went to look for that account in my &quot;Kirby Diary,&quot; one word file I have always backed up and replaced on every new computer.  I didn&#39;t find that story, but found this which has a couple of tie-ins.  It&#39;s a clean cut, unedited.  I left the first one because it had the year.  Kirby was born  July 29, 1986, so he had just turned five.<br/>
----------------<br/>
Thu, Aug 8, 1991<br/>
<br/>
Went to spend the night with Grandma and Grandpa in their trailer at the Monticello trailer park on Central.<br/>
<br/>
August 15<br/>
<br/>
�Why do things on earth need the letters of the alphabet?� <br/>
<br/>
[sometime the same day:] he was talking about wanting to go back to dance class, and I reminded him he had hated dance class.  He said, �I don�t mean the dance class where I dance and cry.  I mean the class where I learn stuff.�  (On further questioning, it turned out he meant his art class.)<br/>
<br/>
 Friday, August 16<br/>
<br/>
 This week Kirby has been talking about �the West,� and cowboys, and the desert, and the Old West a lot.  I tried again to discuss directions with him, and I talked about history, with examples like when Kirby was little we didn�t have a patio, and now we do, and when Marty was little we didn�t have a door to the patio, and now we do, and when the new baby comes those things will have been there his whole life.  He seemed to be getting the idea that the cowboys used to be in this same place, but it was a long time ago, and that before our house was built, it was the desert right where our house is, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 His most interesting expression about the whole matter was �People who live in the East never get to see the sun go down.�<br/>
<br/>
 Keith and I took him and Marty �to see the sun set out West in the desert.�  We drove out Friday after work to the other side of Bernalillo, where Keith knew of a dirt road that leads to Rio Rancho.  We drove off on an old leftover bit of highway, and off on this dirt road.  (We took some pictures, so that�ll be in the kids� books.)  It was a little muddy, and they found good sticks (Yucca stalks) and we saw cactus and could find no animal tracks at all, even though the road and a little wash had been very well cleared out by the rain and were muddy (dry enough to walk on, mostly)..  We found a horse�s jawbone with teeth (which Keith scouted out and let Kirby �find� and pull out of the mud) but Kirby wasn�t as impressed by that as he should�ve been.  The sun went down, and we came back.  Kirby fell asleep on the way home and he was satisfied (for a while) about the west and the desert.<br/>
<br/>
 Mon, Aug 19, 1991<br/>
<br/>
 For the past couple of days Kirby has started saying, if he and Marty are playing any make-believe (Turtles, Lego, etc.), �We�ll be right back after these messages.�  That means he needs to go to the bathroom and he wants Marty to wait for him.  Today, after he was finished in the toilet, he ran back saying, �We now return to our program.�<br/>
<br/>
 Sat, Aug 31, 1991<br/>
<br/>
 Kirby and Marty were playing with toy dinosaurs on Keith�s bed.  There were kids, and a baby, and a mom, and a dad, and family friends who had brought a present, a magnifying glass �But you have to share it, even with the baby,� they said.  Kirby was being the dad and Marty was being the baby (and other kids) and �the dad� said, �Do you kids want to play with me?�  The babies (Marty) said �Yeah!  Yeah!�  �The Dad� said, �Well, sorry.  First I have to type and write and a lot of boring stuff, and when I finish that I�ll play with you.�  OOOh--I thought I was the parent to get stuck with that reputation. I guess it�s me and Keith both.<br/>
<br/>
 September 4, 1991<br/>
<br/>
 Kirby had been playing with Kyla and Dane (at James� birthday party at Kit Carson Park), and on the way home he said, �Kyla�s older than Dane, right?�<br/>
<br/>
            �Right.�<br/>
<br/>
            �Why?�  [and then his own pause] ��and don�t tell me it�s because she was born first.�<br/>
<br/>
            When he�d talked to me about why he was older than Marty, I�d said because he was born first; because he was already out of me when Marty wasn�t even born yet.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Those two classes, the art and dance classes, are the main reason we homeschooled that first year, which led to all those other years.  The &quot;out west&quot; day is the first photo in Moving a Puddle, page vi.<br/>
<br/>
Because of singing and Sesame Street, all my kids knew the alphabet before they knew what it was called.  But as to what it&#39;s called, sometimes &quot;the ABCs.&quot;  And sometimes &quot;alphabet&quot; which is short for &quot;alpha beta&quot; which is &quot;AB.&quot;  Some people are naturally more interested in language than other people.  I am, and my kids are.  Because the subject line is &quot;alphebet,&quot; I&#39;m guessing the mom who asked isn&#39;t very interested in language and might not have thought of the &quot;alpha&quot; in &quot;alphabet.&quot;  So possibly there are other &quot;intelligences&quot; primary in that family.  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>
<br/>
Reading comes when it comes, and if it&#39;s pressed too hard too soon, it comes painfully and haltingly, or perhaps the child decides (or is told) that he is &quot;not a reader,&quot; so he loses the will and ability to let it come naturally.  <br/>
<br/>
I think playing with the alphabet should be done if it&#39;s not too painful for the mom to do that.  We used to play with other words that started with same letters or same sounds, just in the car, or with letters on the fridge or with letters on cardboard boxes, or the kids&#39; names.  Marty and Monkey, and Kirby and Kangaroo.<br/>

with the magnet letters.  Everyone is interested in them.  It&#39;s fun!  In the <br/>
same room, we have a table and behind one of the kitchen benches is a huge <br/>
chalkboard.  Messages and pictures are made all the time.  It&#39;s fun!  It&#39;s <br/>
learning!  Other people&#39;s creations, drawings and sayings, are corrected and <br/>
changed regularly!  Sometimes new things show up mysteriously and everyone tries <br/>
to guess who did it or who wrote it.  Sometimes it is up for weeks until we <br/>
figure out who it was.<br/>
<br/>
I have a magnet on my fridge that says &quot;I bet you thought that everyone at <br/>
Wilson smokes weed... 70% Do... where do you fit in?&quot;  Wilson is a nearby high <br/>
school.  It used to say &quot;70% Don&#39;t&quot;, but Chamille used opaque marker to cover it <br/>
up.   You can&#39;t tell because it&#39;s white letters on a black background.  It&#39;s <br/>
word play, altering the meaning with altering the letters.  That little magnet <br/>
also brought up percentages.  Chamille asked how many 70% was.  I told her that <br/>
if you had 10 kids lined up, that 70% would be 7 of those kids.  She thought the <br/>
statistics were inaccurate, so felt obliged to change it.  That led to another <br/>
discussion about where the magnet came from, it does have a logo on it, and how <br/>
they potentially may have gotten their numbers and why they may be inaccurate, <br/>
or not.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is made up of those kinds of moments, those little moments of <br/>
magnets and drawings and discussions that lead to little bits of understanding <br/>
about the world that connect to other little bits of understanding to make up a <br/>
larger view.<br/>
<br/>
 ***My question is &#39;Does a person need to know the alphabet to learn to read?***<br/>
<br/>
What a person needs is peace and joyful play.  If words and letters and numbers <br/>
and patterns are fun to play with, kids will do so.  If that leads to reading, <br/>
it will lead to reading.  If it leads to that little bit of understanding about <br/>
the world that connects to other little bits, then THAT is what it leads to. <br/>
 I&#39;ve never met an unschooled kid that doesn&#39;t eventually learn how to read, <br/>
given the time and space to do so.<br/>

They might need peace and joyful play involving the alphabet and words, though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m concerned about answering a question like &quot;Does a person need X to learn?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling should be expansive, not cheap or limiting.  Unschooling can&#39;t work if the parents are trying to see how little they can do and still succeed.  Or how little time they can spend with kids and still have the same result others are getting who aren&#39;t limiting time at all.   <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling needs more and more of more and more things.  A life in which a six year old hasn&#39;t become familiar with the alphabet naturally seems to me to be a limited life.<br/>

&gt; painful for the mom to do that.  We used to play with other words  <br/>
&gt; that started with same letters or same sounds, just in the car, or  <br/>
&gt; with letters on the fridge or with letters on cardboard boxes, or  <br/>
&gt; the kids&#39; names.  Marty and Monkey, and Kirby and Kangaroo.***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yesterday, Zoe (13) was embarrassed because her voice teacher asked  <br/>
her, &quot;What comes after &#39;F&#39; and she drew a blank for a few moments. Zoe  <br/>
can read and write beautifully, she can identify all the letters by  <br/>
name and discuss the different sounds one might use them to write, but  <br/>
she didn&#39;t memorize  the order of the alphabet letters thoroughly. She  <br/>
can recite them in order beginning with &#39;A&#39; though, so she did  <br/>
memorize them, just not well enough to start anywhere in the list and  <br/>
know the next letter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We played with the alphabet when Zoe was little - I sang songs,  <br/>
offered Sesame Street videos that Zach adored when he was little,  <br/>
offered to play children&#39;s tapes on car drives.  I even had a  <br/>
schoolroom-like alphabet border that ran around our kitchen at first  <br/>
and later Zoe&#39;s room.  She never cared much for any of it and  <br/>
preferred that I NOT play audio-tapes in the car or videotapes for her  <br/>
on TV.  We had two kinds of alphabet magnets on our fridge - the hard  <br/>
plastic ones that I remember from my childhood, and some softer foamy  <br/>
ones I bought in a tub.  We also  had word magnets.  Zoe showed little  <br/>
interest in any of them, I didn&#39;t worry.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, she asked me if she was dumb because she didn&#39;t know the  <br/>
answer to her voice teacher&#39;s question, quickly.  I told her that she  <br/>
just had never really cared about knowing the order of the letters in  <br/>
the alphabet.  I told her about how I sometimes still have to recite a  <br/>
few letters in a row to come up with the next letter in the alphabet.   <br/>
We talked about how I use knowing the order of the alphabet to do  <br/>
filing at work and of course how music notation is labeled with the  <br/>
first seven letters of the alphabet.<br/>
<br/>
Zoe loves YouTube and singing and has a fondness for Sesame Street too  <br/>
so I shared Sandra&#39;s list of links with her. Maybe she&#39;ll want to  <br/>
learn the order of the alphabet - maybe she won&#39;t. She likes to look  <br/>
up songs on YouTube and she memorizes the lyrics and tunes and I&#39;m  <br/>
often amazed at how well she can remember them from just a couple of  <br/>
listens.<br/>

Good point!  There are many ways to have peaceful joyful play involving the <br/>
alphabet.  Refrigerator magnets can do that!  That is just one way that we enjoy <br/>
the alphabet.  We play scrabble sometimes too.  Games are great!<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that there are layers there.  One layer is that peace and joy are <br/>
great for learning.  Another, is that there needs to be that hotbed of <br/>
information available and accessible.  Yet another, is the seeing the learning <br/>
in everything, even things that don&#39;t at all seem schoolish or educational. <br/>
 Then, the 4th aspect is the relationship built between the parent/s and the <br/>
child/ren.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve given this a lot of thought lately!  When unschooling is at its height of <br/>
awesome, all of those parts are in play.  Sometimes while going about life, one <br/>
or two of those things get dropped and unschooling can falter.  I try to keep <br/>
all of those things going day to day, so that it doesn&#39;t falter.<br/>

<br/>
Waldorf/Steiner style education has a way of introducing letters that involves <br/>
seeing letters in the environment.  We have a book by Famke Zonneveld, &quot;Waldorf <br/>
Alphabet Book,&quot; that has gorgeous watercolor illustrations of the letters in <br/>
real life. For example, an illustration of a man jumping with his arms straight <br/>
up in the air in line with his body and his legs bent at the knees is J.  This <br/>

I have seen photos of some Waldorf-y type homeschoolers who made letters out of <br/>
food, dirt, grass, rocks, etc.  <br/>

Rowan is totally into doing this if it also means getting dirty :) She and her <br/>
dad took veggies (and rocks) from our garden last summer and spelled out their <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541995636">My DS can sing the alphabet, we also do have a puzzle on our fridge of the alphabet that you mach with a word that starts with the letter. But he only sometimes makes a turn. His sister will hide letters in scribling and then he must find it, he enjoys that. when he playes games he has learnt what word is &quot;quit&quot; &quot;save&quot; &quot;yes&quot; &quot;no&quot; but when its a new game i show him again the old words but they look difrent because they have a diffrent font or colour. We play comuter games where they say a sentence and he must put in the missing word, which i help him with, he likes it.<br/>
<br/>
So im hearing that the alphabet is not the key to unlock or decode words. We do play with the alphabet in non schooly ways, but it not foundational. my son sings his sisters songs, then askes what are words mean all the time. I still sometimes think things have to happen in a certain order. i asked my husband the other day does a person really need the alphabet to read and he said &quot;hell yes&quot;. But he didnt convince me, i tried to find articals on unschool sites but ssssssooooo much info to sort through.<br/>
<br/>
There was a period of time where all he wanted to do was count, and measure,he measured every thing and always wanted me to count to any numbert he said. We made cupcakes to measure and sprinkled choc sprinklers on and as it was finished he got so mad with himself and said &quot; aaaaarrrgggg Why does my body always tell me to count&quot; and he proceded to count the sprinkles. It is my unschooling story to tell everyone who doesnt believe that kids will learn, because it is natural.<br/>
<br/>
I love to read, but im a terrible speller, sometimes what i want to say i cant convey properly in written form, i keep redoing so much of my writing so that it matches close to what i want to say.</div>

I don&#39;t think anyone said that.  <br/>
<br/>
You can neither require the alphabet nor ignore it.<br/>
You can neither force it nor prevent it.<br/>
We don&#39;t know, and you don&#39;t know, and your child doesn&#39;t know what all  he  needs to learn to read.  Reading doesn&#39;t happen because of a curriculum, and it doesn&#39;t happen the same way for everyone.<br/>

I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;foundational.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s not a good unschooling term, though.<br/>

If you and your husband agree that is needed, that doesn&#39;t make it so.  If you both agree that it&#39;s not needed, that doesn&#39;t make it true.<br/>

You don&#39;t need to sort through it all.  You can&#39;t read it all at once.<br/>
Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.<br/>

It will all look different to you if you read it again later.  And if you read it after your son is reading really well, it will look different in other ways.<br/>

He started reading whole words, then started noticing letter combinations, letter sounds, then started seeing patterns, and soon he was reading.  He is 8 now, I actually dont know that he would be able to id every single upper and lower case letter, I know he cant write them all cause he asks me sometimes how to make some letters but he reads everything he wants to read, including books of all kinds that he might be interested in.  He just finished that Diary of  Wimpy Kid series.

It starts:<br/>
<br/>
Play can be serious business. Playing is certainly the main way that very young children learn, until they go to school.<br/>
<br/>
What if they don&#39;t go to school? What if the ages of five and six don&#39;t mark a life change, and the playing progresses along naturally?<br/>
<br/>
Many people would have no idea how to answer that question. The idea that toddlers&#39; play would naturally progress to other levels without interruption, without separation from families, and without professionals telling children when, where and how to play is foreign to most in our culture.<br/>
<br/>
In one small corner, though, it&#39;s common knowledge. There are unschoolers whose children have not been to school and who have continued to play.<br/>
<br/>
Recently on a discussion list someone said sure, she understood how young children learn through play, but what about when they got older and stopped playing?<br/>
<br/>
I have known people who stopped playing, but I was never one of them. (...and it continues)<br/>

My mom and I did that, scratching each other&#39;s backs, when I was seven or eight.  <br/>
Someone wrote (was it on this list?) just in the past couple of days about the best childhood memories being of parents being happy.  That&#39;s one of my memories of my mom being completely relaxed, at peace and in the moment, and paying gentle physical attention to ME.  Just me.  I have very few of those memories.  I hope my children will never have a problem thinking of times I was paying attention to them without criticism or threat.<br/>
<br/>
Halfway through that paragraph above I had wet eyes, and by the end, tears fell right out of me.   I can hear Holly moving around upstairs.  My office is right under her room.  I&#39;m going to go up and offer to make her breakfast.  I did yesterday, too.  I hope I do it tomorrow.<br/>

Having a mother who offers to make you breakfast, and touches you nicely... those are things that help children learn to read naturally and gently.<br/>

We take bits and pieces from movies, songs, etc and incorporate it into our lives for a while - until we replace it with something else.  For example when he was really little and loved the movie Bambie, when we saw a lot of birds we&#39;d say &quot;bird&quot; in that funny Bambie way.  Then there was Jungle Book where the crows do their &quot;watch you wanna do&quot; routine and we thought that was funny - we still bring sayings back / recycle them once in a while.  We use Monty Python&#39;s sketch of &quot;A Boot To The Head&quot;.  Simon & Garfunkel&#39;s &quot;slip slide and away&quot; has been popular the last couple of weeks due to the snow and ice.

   games.  One was a Blockus/Tetris style of game, matching colours, but the<br/>

   simple notes, using either the bath crayons or foam letters, on the wall of<br/>
   the tub before he got in.  He would be so excited, asking what it said.<br/>

   this?!  which would lead to some letter fun.  It lasted however long it<br/>
   lasted while we ate.  Sometimes we would see if we could erase the letters<br/>
   from the surface of store-bought letter cookies, or chew letters into<br/>
   store-bought pretzels.<br/>
   - Our son loves to hop around, and he loves happy faces.  I would cut out<br/>
   some circles, make happy faces and put letters on the noses and tape them<br/>
   down the hall.  He loved hopping from room to room this way.  Sometimes he<br/>
   said the letters, sometimes not, but he always enjoyed the hopping.<br/>
   - I would make secret spy notes to him with a spy pen we picked up.  It<br/>
   is possible to make one yourself.  I have seen them online.<br/>
   - We liked to play mail delivery.  Our son thought up this game.  He took<br/>
   a cereal box and turned it into a mail box with a flag.  I would write a<br/>
   very simple note and deliver it, making sure to lift the flag.  He would<br/>
   retrieve it.<br/>
   - We pressed letters into playdough.<br/>
<br/>
These are some examples of how we encorporated some letter fun into our<br/>
days.  These ideas may not be relevant for your family, but using your son&#39;s<br/>
interests, you can strew letters like anything else, and see what<br/>
connections he makes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410403059">In November, I got Rowan some crayons for writing on glass/windows.  We have <br/>
since spent a great deal of time drawing on the windows, writing words (her <br/>
name, my name, phrases, etc).  She has loved it so much that a couple of days <br/>
ago, I bought her some crayons for the tub.  Yesterday she and my boys (14mo) <br/>
wrote all over the bath tub.  Rowan drew pictures, but she mostly spent her time <br/>
writing her name and asking me how to write her brothers&#39; names.<br/>

When I looked for it, the Wikipedia page on &quot;The Alphabet Song&quot; came up--looks like there are some other neat ones, especially sung backwards: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_song">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_song</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-643304349">Thank you im seeing it more clearly, since the process of deschooling ive had to rethink everything i thought i knew. We tend to think that if it happend a certain way for our other kids (who were schooled till grade2)that is how it will be with our other kids.<br/>
<br/>
We also play with words alot, we name our animals and then build it up and give it sparkles, eg our dog is &quot;bella&quot; but we say &quot;asla baslajie&quot; which is africaans, our cat is &quot;stroof&quot; but we have added &quot;stroof-a-litious&quot; as in bootalicios... we ryme alot in our family, see u later aligater, in a while crocadile.I have alot of writing on my wall and the kids have a wall in their room they can write on.<br/>
<br/>
The process and thought of unschooling is so natural, but we as parent need unlearning and shifting our mind to see diffrently than what we were &quot;taught&quot;.I keep saying to myself trust the process, because i tend to want to control and change and push. Sandra said once, &quot; the more control u had, the more they will kattapalt if u let go of all control all at once, so go slowly. (my words).<br/>
<br/>
My 14 year old daughter can read africaans and i didnt &quot;teach&quot; her, we speak africaans and english at home, But her main language is english. Africaans just became natural to read. Play ,play, play, play. I think I will write that on my wall, to remind myself.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250154906">Yes this is what I was trying to get across. It&#39;s the phoneme attachment to<br/>
the symbol ... not the symbol name attached to the symbol ... that helps<br/>
with acquiring written language. This is even true for learning spoken<br/>
language. The same is true of using grammar/syntax without knowing what is<br/>
meant by the words &quot;verb, noun, adjective&quot; etc. Also when thinking about<br/>
numbers, it isn&#39;t necessary to know what the terms &quot;addition, subtraction,<br/>
multiplication, division&quot; mean in order to use numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Those are academic conventions: coupling the concepts with the vocabulary.<br/>
That can come later if it&#39;s helpful or useful, after the concepts have a<br/>
meaning to attach the words to.<br/>
