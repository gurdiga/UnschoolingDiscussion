But  actually he couldn&#39;t speak English. Jane was finding these <br/>
beautiful  elegantly worded but mysterious written messages left on <br/>
trees in the  jungle. (If my 30 year old memory is serving me.) But she <br/>
knew they  couldn&#39;t be coming from the equally mysterious but <br/>
non-speaking wild  man.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
YOU&#39;RE RIGHT!  <br/>
He learned to read and write but not to speak. <br/>
 <br/>
My favorite parts of the book were his childhood.  I cried and cried  about <br/>
the dead ape-baby.  I think I was 12 when I read that, and I was  really <br/>
fascinated by his find of his parents&#39; place (without his having any idea  they were <br/>
his parents, I think).  That is one great passage, and if anyone  here missed <br/>
it, it&#39;s Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs.<br/>
 <br/>
HEY, I was going to to go and give a link and say &quot;You can get it on Amazon  <br/>
for a buck fifty&quot; or something, but it&#39;s online in a few places! <br/>

There&#39;s one.  <br/>
It&#39;s dated, it&#39;s fiction, it&#39;s England-centric, and just like Shogun it  <br/>
starts with too much ship-on-ocean and not enough foreign-land, but for its time  <br/>
(1914) it was like bigtime sci-fi/fantasy.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh.  The cheapest listed on Amazon is not $1.50.   It&#39;s  $0.01.  A penny <br/>
(plus shipping &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
That&#39;s pretty funny!  The next more expensive one is 11 cents.  I  started to <br/>
say Burroughs might be rolling over in his grave, but in 1914 11  cents <br/>
American was probably pretty good for a pulp novel. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Nope.  It was $1.50 new in the U.S.  Here they have the history  of the <br/>
publication and some of the early cover art.  VERY cool art:<br/>

I think that red one, first left on third row on the bottom display of  cover <br/>
art was the one I read.  Not positive, but that one looks really  familiar.<br/>
 <br/>
One thing leads to another if you follow those trails...<br/>
