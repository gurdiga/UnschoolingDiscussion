Subject: FW: January<br/>
 <br/>
 From: &quot;E. M. Slater&quot; &lt;<br/>
<br/>
Twas the month after Christmas, and all through the house<br/>
Nothing would fit me, not even a blouse.<br/>
The cookies I&#39;d nibbled, the eggnog I&#39;d taste<br/>
At the holiday parties had gone to my waist.<br/>
When I got on the scales there arose such a number!<br/>
When I walked to the store (less a walk than a lumber).<br/>
I&#39;d remember the marvelous meals I&#39;d prepared;<br/>
The gravies and sauces and beef nicely rared,<br/>
The wine and the rum balls, the bread and the cheese<br/>
And the way I&#39;d never said, &quot;No thank you, please.&quot;<br/>
As I dressed myself in my husband&#39;s old shirt<br/>
And prepared once again to do battle with dirt---<br/>
I said to myself, as I only can<br/>
&quot;You can&#39;t spend a winter disguised as a man!&quot;<br/>
So--away with the last of the sour cream dip,<br/>
Get rid of the fruit cake, every cracker and chip<br/>
Every last bit of food that I like must be banished<br/>
&#39;Till all the additional ounces have vanished.<br/>
I won&#39;t have a cookie--not even a lick.<br/>
I&#39;ll want only to chew on a long celery stick.<br/>
I won&#39;t have hot biscuits, or corn bread, or pie,<br/>
I&#39;ll munch on a carrot and quietly cry.<br/>
I&#39;m hungry, I&#39;m lonesome, and life is a bore---<br/>
But isn&#39;t that what January is for?<br/>
Unable to giggle, no longer a riot.<br/>
Happy New Year to all and to all a good diet! </span></blockquote></div>
