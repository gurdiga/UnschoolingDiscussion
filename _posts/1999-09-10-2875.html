&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wonder if the difficulty some folks have with their kids<br/>
&gt; &quot;deschooling&quot; may be<br/>
&gt; related to matters of religious belief.  Now I have some trepidation<br/>
&gt; in bringing<br/>
&gt; this up and I want to do it in a diplomatic and respectful way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope you&#39;ll permit the long answer to this question, but it is one<br/>
about which I have thought long and hard:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    There is no question in my mind that my religious persuasion deeply<br/>
&gt; informs our approach to homeschooling.  As Friends (Quakers), we<br/>
&gt; believe firmly in &quot;continuing revelation&quot;, the reality that the divine<br/>
&gt; can reveal itself to us at any time, in the oddest of moments, in the<br/>
&gt; strangest of places, with no necessary relationship to our desserts,<br/>
&gt; and that this revelation can have enduring transformative value for<br/>
&gt; our lives.  And, in my experience, children are more clearly attuned<br/>
&gt; to this possibility (even if they would never use the heavy language<br/>
&gt; to express it.)  Our educational approach is much about seizing the<br/>
&gt; moment, listening for and cultivating the creative spark (the fountain<br/>
&gt; which flows from the divine), and allowing for transformations to<br/>
&gt; occur in ways we never would have expected.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We also believe that there is a piece of the divine -- the divine spark<br/>
or the inner light -- in each living soul, and that we must do it<br/>
suitable homage.  The testimony of the 18th century Quaker abolitionist<br/>
John Woolman (which I include in my forthcoming homeschooling book) is<br/>
probably the best statement I know of this principle:<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;I...was early convinced in my mind that true religion consisted in an<br/>
inward life, wherein the heart doth reverence God the Creator and learns<br/>
to exercise true justice and goodness, not only toward all men but also<br/>
toward the brute creatures;  that as the mind was moved on an inward<br/>
principle to love God as an invisible, incomprehensible being, on the<br/>
same principle it was moved to love him in all his manifestations in the<br/>
visible world; that as by his breath the flame of life was kindled in<br/>
all animal and sensitive creatures, to say we love God as unseen and at<br/>
the same time exercise cruelty toward the least creature moving by his<br/>
life, or by life derived from him, was a contradiction in itself...<br/>
<br/>
 There is a principle which is pure, placed in the human mind, which in<br/>
different places and ages hath had different names; it is, however,<br/>
pure, and proceeds from God.  It is deep, and inward, confined to no<br/>
forms of religion, nor excluded from any, where the heart stands in<br/>
perfect sincerity.  In whomsoever this takes root and grows, of what<br/>
nation soever, they become brethren.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 It is from this belief that Friends&#39; pacifism and commitment to<br/>
community service flows.  We also hold testimonies about the importance<br/>
of simplicity and community which we hope will inform our daily living,<br/>
learning included.<br/>
<br/>
 Deschooling?  Here&#39;s what William Penn, the founder of the &quot;Holy<br/>
Experiment&quot; which became the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, had to say<br/>
about education in 1693:<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;The first Thing obvious to Children is what is sensible; and that we<br/>
make no Part of their Rudiments.  We press their Memory too soon, and<br/>
puzzle, strain, and load them with Words and Rules; to know Grammer and<br/>
Rhetorick, and a strange Tongue or two, that is ten to one may never be<br/>
useful to them; Leaving their natural Genius to Mechanical and Physical,<br/>
or natural Knowledge uncultivated and neglected; which would be of<br/>
exceeding Use and Pleasure to them through the whole Course of their<br/>
Life...<br/>
<br/>
 It were Happy if we studied Nature more in natural Things; and acted<br/>
according to Nature; whose rules are few, plain and most reasonable.<br/>
Let us begin where she begins, go her Pace, and close always where she<br/>
ends, and we cannot miss of being good Naturalists.  The Creation would<br/>
no longer be a Riddle to us:  The Heavens, Earth, and Waters, with their<br/>
respective, various and numerous Inhabitants:  Their Productions,<br/>
Natures, Seasons, Sympathies and Antipathies; their Use, Benefit and<br/>
Pleasure, would be better understood by us:  And an eternal Wisdom,<br/>
Power, Majesty, and Goodness, very conspicuous to us, thro&#39; those<br/>
sensible and passing Forms:  The World wearing the Mark of its Maker,<br/>
whose Stamp is everywhere visible, and the Characters very legible to<br/>
the Children of Wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
 And it would go a great way to caution and direct People in their Use<br/>
of the World, that they were better studied and known in the Creation of<br/>
it.  For how could Man find the Confidence to abuse it, while they<br/>
should see the Great Creator stare them in the Face, in all and every<br/>
part thereof?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;ve probably said enough here.  But to add to the discussion, I<br/>
have posted the chapter of my book on nature education (&quot;Dog Kitties&quot;)<br/>
up on my website (see below), so folks can see how it (for our family)<br/>
plays out in actual practice.  Comments welcome!<br/>
