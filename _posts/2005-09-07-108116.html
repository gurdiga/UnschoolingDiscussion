<div id="ygrps-yiv-136462740">Hi everyone,<br/>
 <br/>
I am planning on going to the picnic, not sure what food I will bring <br/>
yet but will bring the kids:))<br/>
I have daughter 8 and sons 5 and  2. <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to mention that while my sons love dogs, my daughter is VERY <br/>
afraid. (I am not sure why- cannot trace it back to any certain event <br/>
and dh and I are dog lovers as we had them as kids etc. We do have a <br/>
cat- so it is not all animals.) ANYWAY, I know it is a common childhood <br/>
fear and that we have run into other kids who are also afraid of dogs. <br/>
I wanted to mention it so that if you must bring your dog and if dogs <br/>
are allowed to be off leash- you will keep the leash on anyway- and <br/>
understand why my daughter will walk F A R  A W A Y  A R O U N D  Y O <br/>
U  A N D  T H E  D O G, but my sons will runrightintoyouandthedog  and <br/>
I will be torn in two:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your consideration regarding this matter. <br/>
