with him or her.  <br/>
<br/>
My mother still has all my old music awards around.  I was pretty good, and<br/>
there are a lot of them.  I had great report cards, and she always proud of<br/>
them.  Not of me, no.  She was proud of the accomplishments and her part in<br/>
making them happen.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 34 years old now, and I&#39;ve been home maybe ten times in the last 17<br/>
years.  My mom has seen my son four times in his six years of life, I think.<br/>
I try to go visit them, sometimes, but it&#39;s stressful.  I&#39;ve stopped winning<br/>
awards and have devoted my days to unschooling my son (and myself!), to<br/>
teaching music so kids enjoy it, and to the little bit of foster care work I<br/>
do for the army.  She&#39;s not proud of me anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Cherish the wonderful person your daughter is, and be proud that you have<br/>
HER, not the stuff.<br/>

got all the glory in high school are the ones that have the furthest to fall <br/>
when they step out into the real world.  They were on top of the world, top <br/>
of the pecking order in high school, but when they become a regular schmuck <br/>
in the work place/college, things will be hard to deal with.  For &quot;regular&quot; <br/>
kids there&#39;s no place but up!  They are no longer someplace in the <br/>
middle...the whole world is open.  <br/>
<br/>
My life in high school sounds so much like your daughters.  Middle of the <br/>
road, average grades.  I started college but quit to get married and have <br/>
babies ...but I&#39;m happy, we live on a farm, my kids are great.  Best part is, <br/>
because I was never &quot;on top of the world&quot; in high school, I have a deep <br/>
empathy for others, cannot tollerate injustice and unkindness, and the <br/>
underdog is always my hero. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Go rent &quot;Romy and Michelle&#39;s High School Reunion&quot; and watch it with your <br/>
daughter.  I know, kinda corny, but my girls and I love it.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, brenda, you have hit on one real truth here, and that&#39;s very <br/>
comforting.  I DO have a tremendously close relationship with my dd, and I <br/>
can&#39;t see that changing.  I respect her so much for the marvelous person she <br/>
is.  One thing I know I&#39;ve done right is exemplified by the fact that all of <br/>
this baggage is apparently my own, alone.  She doesn&#39;t seem to be bothered by <br/>
this stuff at all (was, in fact, the first on her feet to applaud the girl I <br/>
was the most jealous of last night.)<br/>
