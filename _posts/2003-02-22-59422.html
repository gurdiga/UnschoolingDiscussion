<br/>
It wasn&#39;t censorship.  It was a request for courtesy, which isn&#39;t opposed to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It was a request for staying on topic, which is fine.  It&#39;s a big damned <br/>
internet, and you can read all the war humor and commentary and cartoons and <br/>
rude animations and play-by-play commentary anyone could ever want on the <br/>
internet.   <br/>
<br/>
Censorship would be someone keeping this list from existing.<br/>
You can start your own list and discuss ANYTHING without being censored, but <br/>
on someone else&#39;s list you&#39;re limited to what they want to allow.<br/>

  My brother fought in the first Persian War and I still opposed that <br/>
  war. What does having someone in the armed forces got to do with? <br/>
  Still, if there ever was a crowd who would have appreciated Terry <br/>
  Jones&#39;  humor was on this list (and I did get a few notes from people <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I meant to address this when Lorna posted her reply. I&#39;m not asking anyone<br/>
to stop posting a left leaning point of view. *All* points of view on the<br/>
war could be equally hurtful, whether it&#39;s pro-war, anti-war, pro-peace,<br/>
anti-peace, couldn&#39;t care less. I&#39;m asking people to avoid the whole subject<br/>
of Iraq.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t whether people appreciated it or not. I&#39;m sure some did. And I&#39;m<br/>
sure some didn&#39;t. And I&#39;m sure some had another heart wrenching jolt when it<br/>
made them remember that a loved one could be called at any moment.<br/>
