<div id="ygrps-yiv-519259685"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I also suspect that there are those here who harbor a very narrow view of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>unschooling.  The impression I get is that they think I should sit back<br/>
and watch my kids do absolutely nothing because that&#39;s okay, they&#39;ll<br/>
learn anyway.  Well, it isn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 6 years now.<br/>
This is our seventh year.  There is no structure to our study but if I<br/>
don&#39;t set some rules and limits, Rachel will hole up in her room and let<br/>
her depression take her over despite the prozac and Wyndham is just<br/>
Wyndham and you have to meet him to understand.<br/>
If you have such a narrow view of unschooling that you cannot allow any<br/>
parental control at all, that makes you no better in my book than Mr.<br/>
Farris who takes the opposite view to the extreme.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is is that for some of us, unschooling IS a lifestyle,<br/>
not just an education style.  The line is very blurry between unschooling<br/>
and what some might consider &quot;unparenting&quot;.  By allowing your children total<br/>
control over their lives can be a wonderful thing, but there do need to be<br/>
limits.  Some of us seem to need to have more limits than others.<br/>
<br/>
I am struggling with this problem right now and I have found this discussion<br/>
very interesting and I am enjoying everyones opinions.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I think there are people on this list who are true unschoolers,<br/>
who let their kids do whatever all day, but have a set lunch and dinnertime<br/>
or family time (when dad gets home).  Others (like myself) stock the kitchen<br/>
with nutritious foods and allow the kids to help themselves when their<br/>
hungry.  If they eat ice cream for breakfast on occasion, I don&#39;t really<br/>
care, because most mornings they have cereal and fruit, or yogurt, or even a<br/>
sandwich.  They get help when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
Others may allow their kids to fall asleep whenever, but other families need<br/>
a set bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
These extraneous issues (bedtime, TV, Nintendo, etc) are more of parenting<br/>
issues than educational issues.  I can see the validity of both sides.  But<br/>
I don&#39;t feel that someone who limits TV can&#39;t be an unschooler; however<br/>
someone who requires a certain amount of schoolwork (usually reading,<br/>
writing/spelling, and/or math) a day is a relaxed homeschooler, not an<br/>
unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschoolers allow the philosophy to spill over into all areas of<br/>
life, not just education while the less radical folk need a more<br/>
authoritarian parenting style.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is making sense.  I think some of this discussion has been<br/>
because of the blurred the lines between unschooling and parenting, and like<br/>
I said, I&#39;m still trying to figure out where that line is in my own family.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel that my children are wild and run amok or are rude and<br/>
undisciplined.  I feel that they are capable (ie they use knives and<br/>
scissors, stoneware dishes and regular glassware, help cook, etc).  Some<br/>
would feel we are &quot;unsafe&quot; but it is amazing how capable young kids can be<br/>
if allowed to use some things that &quot;only grown-ups&quot; should use (after being<br/>
shown how and supervised etc).<br/>

when they wanted and slept when they wanted.  I cooked some of the time. <br/>
Other times, I didn&#39;t<br/>
We are hosting a foreign exchange student now though and out of courtesy<br/>
for him we are now eating dinner together at night and having down time<br/>
that starts at about 11:00 so he can sleep without too much house noise. <br/>
Mine don&#39;t have to go to sleep, they just have to be quiet.  It&#39;s<br/>
actually rather refreshing and uplifting to see that these three kids who<br/>
are used to practical anarchy, are accepting these changes without<br/>
complaint and understand why they are happening.  Now, if I could just<br/>
get used to having to deal with the ps system . . . <br/>
