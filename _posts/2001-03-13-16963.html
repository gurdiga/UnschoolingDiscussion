<div id="ygrps-yiv-461476062">If any of you are in need of a good dictionary (my kids are always wondering what words mean), B&N stores (not the dotcom) have a huge Webster&#39;s Unabridged dictionary in their bargain section right now.  The copyright on it is 1996, but I don&#39;t think that makes it any less worthwhile.  Retail on it is $100.... it is marked $29.95.  With my discount card, it was only $21.18 including tax.  I am guessing this is chain-wide, since a neighbor bought one at a different B&N than the one I went to today.  Mine had several copies.<br/>
