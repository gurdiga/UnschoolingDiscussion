My kind of person Bobbie. Have to get together when I arrive in the states.
I&#39;ll throw a big party! (and teach you yanks to speak :) )
<br>That was a joke!!!!!!
<br>I&#39;m pretty excited about moving to the US now. Have to dye my hair
boringly normal for the interviews with the INS then back to weird and
wonderful. Home-schooling looks pretty difficult in VA but I&#39;m up for a
challenge ;)
<br>Look out America, here comes me!

come on over! I&#39;ll teach you a few redneck-gone-punk<br/>
things....<br/>
(did you say VA? I wasn&#39;t paying attention before,<br/>
sorry....I love VA!! I&#39;ve only been there once, for a<br/>
few weeks, but I loved it. It&#39;s really pretty.)<br/>
