&gt; staying with her.<br/>

Maybe it isn&#39;t feasible for family members to keep staying with her in the<br/>
long run, but perhaps for a few months.  It takes time to grieve, and your<br/>
grandmother probably needs her home to do that.  She needs to walk though<br/>
the rooms they shared and cry over wonderful memories.<br/>
<br/>
There is not a great amount of practicality, perhaps, but much wisdom in the<br/>
standard counselling advice to make no major changes for one year after the<br/>
death of someone you were very attached to.  Maybe it won&#39;t be a year, but<br/>
maybe this week, this month, is just too soon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Brenda, I think you&#39;re right.. And most likely, we will just all pitch in and <br/>
take turns staying.   4 daughters, 2 sons, .. at least 8 grandchildren ( <br/>
willing to stay, maybe more.. out of 17 still living).. thats two weeks worth <br/>
right there.. So, we would only have to stay once every two weeks. Or two <br/>
nights a month..  The only  &quot;bad&quot; thing about rotating, taking turns. so many <br/>
folks coming in and out.. Grandma would never rest or feel &quot;settled&quot;  She is <br/>
very difficult to &quot;take care of&quot;  she insists on taking care of everyone <br/>
else.. Im afraid Grandma would constantly be in a state of &quot;hostess&quot;  <br/>
Although she may not..  That perception is based on her attitudes and <br/>
behaviors before Grandpa died.. She may let other folks care for her during <br/>
her grief.   Its hard to say though.. After the funeral, her biggest concern <br/>
was that everyone got something to eat.. <br/>
