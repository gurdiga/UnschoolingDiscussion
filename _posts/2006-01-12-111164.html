<div id="ygrps-yiv-671111115">Logan is into trains, so I just read him a John Henry story (from a Disney book). I told him there are songs written about John Henry, so we&#39;re listening to some now. Just listened to Johnny Cash, and now we&#39;re listening to Leslie Riddle. <br/>
   <br/>
  Here&#39;s a link to songs if you&#39;re interested. <br/>
