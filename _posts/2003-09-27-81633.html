 </span></blockquote>Grass doesn&#39;t grow naturally in New Mexico (like lawn/sod kind of grass) and <br/>
sometimes people gravel their yards (a disgusting practice, really; horrible <br/>
to undo), and having done that, sometimes they grass part of it.  So as a verb <br/>
in opposition to &quot;gravelling&quot; a yard, people here might grass some.  <br/>

You can&#39;t grass something, but you can get high. You can&#39;t leaf something <br/>
either, but you can leave a leaf. I was going to say tree, but dogs tree things. <br/>
Darin said bush, but I think you can bush your hair (make it bushy?). Moly <br/>
suggested pot, but you can pot a plant and you can pan for gold too. I think most <br/>
nouns can be made into a verb, either by changing the sentence structure or <br/>
by adding a suffix. Does that count? <br/>
