<br/>
&quot;Character&quot; is another crap-school-word or crap-parent-word. I hate <br/>
that one! Building &quot;character&quot; by deprivation or punishment---that&#39;s <br/>
a crock. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;There were days that I&#39;ve wanted to quit things too, out of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>frustration or <br/>
being tired or not feeling well or some offhanded comment.  There are <br/>
things I&#39;m <br/>
glad now that I didn&#39;t quit.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
And YOU had the choice? That&#39;s the thing: if YOu have the choice and <br/>
decide to &quot;stick it out&quot;---or if the choice is made FOR YOU.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, the child wants to quit, and the parent (and probably <br/>
coach) wants him to stick it out. The choice is being made for him. <br/>
That&#39;s no choice. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agreed with you in that the child should be allowed to stop playing <br/>
football but just offered the idea to make sure that it wasn&#39;t just a particularly <br/>
bad day, which the mother has already determined it wasn&#39;t, just a real desire <br/>
to not play anymore.<br/>
<br/>
So, the child&#39;s choice was examined, validated and honored, all things that I <br/>
also agree to be important.<br/>

&gt; Im not sure if this was responding to Glena or was about my son and I.  Just <br/>
&gt; to be clear. I dont and didn&#39;t want him to stick it out I was actually <br/>
&gt; wishing secretly that he would quit. He has..<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also disagree. This paragraph hit me wrong. My sons feelings and concerns <br/>
&gt; come before a pee wee football team. <br/>
