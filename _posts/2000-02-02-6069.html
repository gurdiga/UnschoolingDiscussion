<div id="ygrps-yiv-451605867">I just have to share this -- I am so excited.  I know you all must have a<br/>
zillion stories like this, but whenever it happens I feel so relieved and<br/>
revived.<br/>
<br/>
We have been somewhat homeschoolers I guess from the beginning.  I came<br/>
along kicking and screaming with curriculum and workbooks flailing around<br/>
wildly.  But my kids (who just kept coming too -- we have 5 with the<br/>
youngest being 2 year old twins) just kept glaring at me when I would sit<br/>
down and announce that school had begun for the day.  My oldest has done<br/>
Saxon math for a year now and I have been thrilled that we had some &quot;proof&quot;<br/>
that he is being educated.  This whole approach has always seemed terribly<br/>
wrong to me, but I have this PTA mom persona who keeps lurking around in my<br/>
brain so I just didn&#39;t want to be that different.  Well, my wonderful sister<br/>
just moved here not too long ago and, by her presence, has convinced me that<br/>
what is in my soul is right.  SO, I have been relaxing and realizing that<br/>
they really DO want to learn and that they WILL learn all on their own<br/>
without me announcing that they will now learn something.<br/>
<br/>
So, today, we got home from a great day and my 4 and 6 year olds started<br/>
talking about their hearts.  So I yanked out the book about the body on the<br/>
shelf that had great overlays of the body and showed them to the kids.  Then<br/>
we read the whole book together and talked all about the body&#39;s systems.<br/>
Then my 6 year old went off to the kitchen to draw her heart while my son<br/>
tried skipping around on one foot to feel what balance is, then he tried<br/>
biting his hand until his brain sent his hand the message to pull away (he<br/>
is a complete scream...).  I sat there glowing in my love for these kids and<br/>
realizing that the only way to truly love them is to respect them and to<br/>
help them unfold in their own way and in their own time.<br/>
<br/>
This list is great and has been very helpful to me in breaking some of my<br/>
PTA-mom personality&#39;s grip on me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
