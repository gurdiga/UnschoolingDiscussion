<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen anyone disputing that. <br/>
<br/>
In the late sixties and early seventies my sister had a preference for<br/>
moccasins.   She had long dark wavy hair and dark skin.   Her name was<br/>
Ruth but everyone called her Sue because that&#39;s the name my mom had<br/>
wanted her to have.   Teachers, knowing her name was Ruth, seeing the<br/>
hair, skin, moccasins, and hearing &quot;Sioux&quot; decided she was Native<br/>
American.   <br/>
<br/>
I still remember kids coming off the reservation to the school I attended<br/>
being called prairie niggers.   I remember my sis being called that.  <br/>
But if they&#39;d known our mother was Jewish they&#39;d have found something<br/>
else to label us with. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone with open eyes knows about  injustice, Janis.    I can see you&#39;re<br/>
passionate about it.  <br/>
