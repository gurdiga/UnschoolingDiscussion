 i am curious has to why both you and david (et al) have a problem with the <br/>
use<br/>
 in this context.  maybe my understanding of the word round is too broad but <br/>
when<br/>
 i read the definition in webster&#39;s it was exactly what i thought it meant <br/>
and it<br/>
 seems to be use correctly.  does your problem stem from  understanding round <br/>
as<br/>
 a 2d quality and not a 3d one?<br/>

<br/>
The picture I get in my head when I hear someone describe the earth as round <br/>
is a beach ball.  Any ball.  A perfectly round ball.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the shape of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
So it doesn&#39;t seem like an exact enough choice to me.  And actually finding <br/>
out about the actual shape of the earth (bulges, etc.) is interesting enough, <br/>
to me anyway, to be just picky enough to say &quot;well, you know, it&#39;s not <br/>
actually round&quot; -- not in the way I picture round when I hear it.  And I <br/>
think a lot of people would think of round as marble-type round, not <br/>
irregular-pear-shaped, bulgy-pebble-shaped round.  <br/>
<br/>
Is that at all clear?<br/>

thanks this explains it.  i can see where you&#39;re coming from now.  one of the<br/>
things i enjoy about life is just how we each interpret things a bit<br/>
differently.  the native americans believe we each sit in a circle and when<br/>
viewing something we each view it from a different angle.   so if someone &#39;sits&#39;<br/>
near you your perspectives are easily understood - very similar.  but if two<br/>
people &#39;sit&#39; far apart the views can differ radically but this does not change<br/>
the thing which is being viewed just the interpretation of it.  hence my<br/>
favorite quote -&#39;unity through diversity&#39;   thanks for taking the time to bring<br/>
me to your perspective.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>yes it is very clear.  personally i would feel very comfortable using the word<br/>
round to describe a pear or a head or a face.  to me round can be use to<br/>
describe anything which has a curved surface and some sense of fullness.  to<br/>
describe a marble i would qualify round with perfect - a marble is perfectly<br/>
round.<br/>
<br/>
i can understand why round would be a problem for some especially since globes,<br/>
which are suppose to represent the earth, are marble-like/ perfectly round the<br/>
assumption would be the earth is as well and this is very misleading.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again,<br/>
