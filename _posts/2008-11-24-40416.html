<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106193399">Someone on a message board I&#39;m on was talking about unschooling and I <br/>
ended up writing a book about what our unschooling days look like.  <br/>
Then I copied it and sent it to my mom.  She wrote back and <br/>
said &quot;That&#39;s how it&#39;s done!  I used to live like that with you.&quot;  Of <br/>
course, she was talking about what she did with me when I was 3, the <br/>
age that my daughter is now.  Then she had to work, so I went to <br/>
private school.  Then the school closed and my parent&#39;s split up and <br/>
she still had to work, so my best friend&#39;s mom homeschooled me with a <br/>
curriculum.  Then I begged to go to private school for 8th grade and <br/>
then public school for highschool.<br/>
<br/>
But I bet if my mom had homeschooled me like she wanted to, she would <br/>
have found unschooling.  Even if she never found the <br/>
term &quot;unschooling,&quot; I think our lives would have looked a lot like <br/>
it.  We were always living and learning.  I learned more from her <br/>
than I ever did from homeschool or school.  She was pretty relaxed <br/>
and respectful.  <br/>
<br/>
She says that she rarely spanked me (and I don&#39;t remember her ever <br/>
spanking) and never grounded me because I &quot;was a good kid and never <br/>
needed it.&quot;  But I wasn&#39;t *that* good of a kid.  And when I was, it <br/>
was because of my relationship with her.  I think she was afraid to <br/>
take those things out of her parenting tool box, but she didn&#39;t use <br/>
them either.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just strange to think about how life might have been <br/>
different....</div>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I think all kids are good kids, sometimes kids make bigger<br/>
mistakes than other times and sometimes those mistakes have bigger<br/>
impacts on others, but still, good kid.  Parental expectations and views<br/>
on those mistakes, can make a kid feel like a &quot;bad&quot; kid, and sometimes<br/>
kids internalize that, and sometimes kids will learn to live up to it! <br/>
I see it clearly as a parent created dynamic!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768231253">Wow!  If you want to.  You might want to read it first and make sure <br/>
it fits.  That would be cool if it does, but if you change your mind <br/>
after reading it I won&#39;t be offended.  The topic on the board <br/>
was &quot;help me get a list of minimum daily goals ( as an unschool <br/>
leaning mom)&quot;  I said:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re radical unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
My minimum daily goal is to talk about everything that is going on <br/>
around us and pursue anything dd finds interesting.  I also try to go <br/>
somewhere new every week.  The week before last we went to the zoo.  <br/>
Last week we went out to the forest for the day, hiked, started a <br/>
little fire, saw the wildlife.  I haven&#39;t made plans for this week <br/>
yet.  Some future ideas are the children&#39;s museum, the beach, the <br/>
wildlife refuge.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some things we&#39;ve talked about/done in the last 2 or 3 <br/>
days:  <br/>
<br/>
Dd dictated a letter for me to write to her cousin and drew her a <br/>
picture.  We put that in the mail and talked about post offices, what <br/>
they do, where the mail goes.  We went to the bank and talked about <br/>
depositing money.  We went to the creek behind our house and saw <br/>
ducks.  We talked about where they live, what they eat, which ones <br/>
are male and female.  She found some red berries and we talked about <br/>
those.  I meant to bring some inside and find out what they were.  <br/>
I&#39;ll have to do that next time.  We talked about how some berries are <br/>
good to eat and some are poisonous and that I didn&#39;t know which those <br/>
were.  We talked about how the drier works and electricity.  We <br/>
watched Zathura and talked about robots and cryogenics.  She <br/>
pretended to make crabby patties at her own restaurant, and we bought <br/>
some from her and talked about money.  We took a walk in the dark to <br/>
look at the stars, but the stars weren&#39;t out so we ended up talking <br/>
about clouds and fog and what those are made of and where the sun <br/>
goes when it gets dark.  <br/>
<br/>
We went to the library and got books on horses and Aesopes Fables.  <br/>
We talked about the different parts of a horse&#39;s body and different <br/>
breeds.  Aesopes Fables led to discussions about turtles and eagles.  <br/>
We talked about the Davidic dance at our church and worshipping God.  <br/>
We soaked some nuts and talked about how that makes them easier to <br/>
digest and what digestion is.  She brought me her Bible and wanted me <br/>
to tell her all the letters on the front.  So, I told her the letters <br/>
and that it said The Toddlers Bible and then she said it after me and <br/>
said &quot;I read it!&quot;  She did the same thing with half of the Green Eggs <br/>
and Ham book.  <br/>
<br/>
She played on starfall.com and did puzzles, letters and stories.  She <br/>
counted while we threw a football back and forth.  She asked me to <br/>
read a Tiger counting book and she wanted to point at each of the <br/>
numbers as I said it.  She is really looking forward to her birthday <br/>
so we looked at a calendar and talked about today&#39;s date and the day <br/>
of her birthday and the day of her party.  We planned her party.  She <br/>
watched Survivor Man with dh and they talked about making fire and <br/>
fishing.  She watched a show about bears with him and they talked <br/>
about the bears.  <br/>
<br/>
We went for a hike and talked about the plants we saw.  We made a <br/>
fire and talked about flint and steel, and watched dh struggle with <br/>
it instead of just using his lighter.   She watched dh and I shoot <br/>
our gun, and we talked about what guns are for.  We got out my <br/>
Usborne books and talked about the moon and astronaunts and zoo <br/>
animals and moving and moving trucks.        <br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t done much youtube.com in the last few days, but we often <br/>
to there to look at anything she&#39;s interested in.  Horses, belly <br/>
dancing, the nutcracker ballet, frogs, bears, monkeys, dogs, cats.... <br/>
let&#39;s just say animals!  Also, motorcycles, trains and all kinds of <br/>
other things.   In the last few weeks we did paper mache and I got a <br/>
library book on it a few days ago, so we&#39;re going to do that again.  <br/>
We made our own dominoes by printing them off the computer and taping <br/>
the paper to cardboard.  We play with cards, and poker chips.  We <br/>
read a lot.  She draws a lot.  For her birthday I&#39;m getting her <br/>
puzzles, art supplies, and chalk.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think of any of this as &quot;school&quot; stuff.  We just live life <br/>
and talk about everything going on.  I try to make life fun and <br/>
interesting and sparkly.  That&#39;s my minumum daily goal.  I don&#39;t <br/>
force anything.  I only make suggestions- not based on some arbitrary <br/>
subject I think she should be learning- but based on what she is <br/>
interested in or what I think she might like to do or see or what <br/>
sounds fun.  And learning happens!   <br/>
<br/>
