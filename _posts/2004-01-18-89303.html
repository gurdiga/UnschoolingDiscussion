I love Scholastic books on tape!    We are getting quite a collection.<br/>
My mother saved all of my books on tape from when I was a child and now my <br/>
children listen to my &quot;superscope story teller presents...&quot; tapes including 3 <br/>
Billie Goats Gruff and Jack & the Beanstalk!<br/>
Don&#39;t part with yours, they last a long time!!!<br/>

I have considered how much fun it will be for grandchildren if I have not <br/>
only CDs and tapes with readalongs but RECORDS!!   I&#39;ll have a private historical <br/>
museum of children&#39;s stuff. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
