I used the term disabled because we are talking about so called &quot;Learning<br/>
Disabilities&quot;, to say someone has a disability pretty much describes them as<br/>
disabled.<br/>
<br/>
But if you are going to say, &quot;Hey, this worked for some people.  Want to try<br/>
it?&quot;  Why is it necessary to describe the person as disabled to do that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197132558">Why is it so hard for some folks to understand that you can have a<br/>
disability but not be disabled.  That knowledge is power and knowing what<br/>
that disability is and how you can fix it is a freeing thing.<br/>
<br/>
My dad had the ear drum in one ear blown to smithereens when a shell<br/>
exploded in a gun on his ship during the Korean War.  Blood running out of<br/>
the ear, the whole nine yards.  This is a severe disability as it affects<br/>
not only hearing but speaking and balance.  He is NOT disabled.  He<br/>
researched everything about this disability and even went on to being in the<br/>
Naval reserves special skin diving forces for 20 years, something that<br/>
supposedly you can&#39;t do without the eardrum for balance, etc.  He sits with<br/>
his good ear toward speakers, televisions, etc.  He has learned to<br/>
compensate and has his own method of balance.  He was a tree topper when he<br/>
first got home from the war.  He then became a pole climber for P.G & E.  He<br/>
still rides motorcycles at the age of 75.  He has a disability, he is NOT<br/>
disabled because he found solutions and doesn&#39;t allow it to limit him.<br/>
<br/>
I have a son who is both ADHD and dyslexic.  When he was very young, I<br/>
investigated ways to help him and found that diet and freedom to be him<br/>
worked for him as far as the hyperactivity were concerned.  When he was a<br/>
little older we had long discussions and spent a lot of time at the library<br/>
(no internet back in the dark ages) looking up resources so that he could<br/>
make an informed decision about Ritalin vs. diet, meditation, behavior<br/>
modification and other things that help.  He choose diet and learned to<br/>
recognize signals and &quot;modify his behavior&quot; patterns.  When his problems<br/>
with &quot;letters that don&#39;t act right&quot; bothered him, we (yes WE) found a PhD<br/>
who worked with kids that had what he called &quot;obsticles to overcome.&quot;  We<br/>
were really lucky because he believed that all children are simply small<br/>
people and that all people are individuals.  My son had input into all<br/>
phases of the plan &quot;to make molehills out of mountains.&quot;  My son has<br/>
disabilities but he is NOT disabled.<br/>
