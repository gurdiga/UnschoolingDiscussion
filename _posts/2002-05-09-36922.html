&lt;&lt; I would have to disagree with you on this one. HSLDA, tries to &quot;see things <br/>
coming&quot;. They have done a great deal of good for homeschoolers. The truth is, <br/>
in many cases, we should be thanking them. They aren&#39;t afraid to get their <br/>
hands dirty for us. For instance they are right now fighting quite hard for <br/>
FLORIDA parents... not just homeschoolers. There is currently a bill waiting <br/>
for Gov. Bush to sign or veto, well known for being the &quot;Government Nanny&quot; <br/>
bill. It is quite a scary thing that is in the balance. Anyone of you in <br/>
Florida, should be aware of this one. Let&#39;s just say that if this bill <br/>
passes, life for families in Florida will never be the same again. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I AM in Florida Rebecca. I don&#39;t think you have researched HSLDA very well if <br/>
you think they give a damn about you as an unschooler.<br/>
They&#39;ll hang you out to dry faster than any government body.<br/>
They&#39;ve done more damage than good to the homeschool &quot;movement&quot;.....(insert <br/>
gag reflex here).<br/>
Please learn more about this group and the damage they&#39;ve done...plus their <br/>
motivation for getting everyone riled up before you bring this type of stuff <br/>
here.<br/>
We&#39;re all very aware of HSLDA and their scare tactics. Also of their origins, <br/>
the people they&#39;ve stepped on along the way, and the damage they&#39;ve done.<br/>
Not to mention the damning of unschoolers.<br/>
