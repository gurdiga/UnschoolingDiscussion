<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310943889">I have spent quite a while, since my kids were very little, reading about <br/>
various hs methods.  Unschooling...child inititated learning is the one that <br/>
philosophically made a lot of sense to me.  I see a lot of value in letting <br/>
children learn what they are interested in and when.  I get HEM and am <br/>
always inspired by it.<br/>
<br/>
I think we are going through a growth phase right now.  My oldest is getting <br/>
to an age, where it seems that talking about things isn&#39;t enough learning <br/>
opportunity.  It used to be easy to just talk about things in the car on the <br/>
way to town.... but I can&#39;t always answer her questions now.  Or my other <br/>
kids either as they grow older.<br/>
<br/>
If I let them be each day.... 90% of their day would be watching TV (if I <br/>
let them), playing, fighting, and maybe some coloring.  While I understand <br/>
the value of down time, it seems the last year has been all down time.  And <br/>
I often see their behavior, when so undirected, to deteriorate into <br/>
fighting, whinning, aggravating each other.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the only thing I can usually think of is to require some type <br/>
of study or work from them.  Which they often resent and doesn&#39;t always <br/>
produce positive results.  My 9 1/2 yo has a lot of interests. But she <br/>
doesn&#39;t engage in most of them, and just complains about boredom.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had the experiences I read about in places like HEM, where my kids <br/>
go out into our woods for the day and explore, or get out a cookbook and <br/>
determine to make a surprise, or choose a particular interest and ask me to <br/>
help them further it. They seem so completely unmotivated.  It&#39;s gone on <br/>
long enough as to seem a personalitiy trait, not a passing stage!<br/>
<br/>
So, now that my kids are older, I&#39;m wondering how to make unschooling still <br/>
fit for us.  Is this just an adjustment stage we&#39;re going through?  My kids <br/>
are smart, and although I&#39;d like it to be of their initiation, I would like <br/>
to see some learning take place!  Any words of advice?<br/>

i believe a little instruction in attitude goes a long way in this type <br/>
situation...  for eg. &lt;&lt;complains about boredom&gt;&gt; are grounds for assigned <br/>
work around here, too!!  i like the idea of explaining to our children what <br/>
we expect...  at least it has worked here....<br/>

<br/>
this happened to us, too!  it was a year and a half ago i think, and she is <br/>
ten now.  she just needed more!  i was actually glad that i was attuned <br/>
enough to her to realize that she needed to be &quot;fed&quot; differently, that she <br/>
was growing and changing and had different, new needs.  after all, that is <br/>
what i see as one of my main roles in this adventure: keeping the environment <br/>
rich and being attuned to their needs... so we instituted a little plan.  she <br/>
and i sat down together and listed all of the things that that were approved <br/>
activity for her to choose from.  this may sound controlling to some, but i <br/>
could tell she needed some direction at the time.  we listed things like <br/>
reading from a book-list file that i had started of books that looked <br/>
interesting or highly recommended for her level, copying text to make a <br/>
pretty piece/ show off her improving handwriting (which was pretty bad at the <br/>
time, but i wanted her to see that she was improving!) dictate a creative <br/>
writing piece to me (having me type for her unleashed her creative juices <br/>
w/out tedious mechanics slowing her) cook something, write a letter or send a <br/>
care package, cut coupons, sew/knit any other type craft or art work (crop! <br/>
for you creative memories folks out there), lead her younger sibs in an <br/>
activity, etc etc etc.  <br/>
<br/>
i wanted her to know that we are going to be an active learning helping <br/>
household.   and that tho we &quot;school&quot; differently than most people she knows, <br/>
we do valuable things with our time.  i have tried to pass on the idea that <br/>
it is each persons responsiblity to learn, because it corresponds with my <br/>
whole philosophy of why we began homeschooling in the first place!  my job <br/>
being just to nurture and provide a rich atmosphere for living...<br/>
<br/>
so far it has worked (motivation-wise), but perhaps it helps that i have been <br/>
encouraging this since 10yod was tiny.....  she launches into projects all <br/>
the time...  often they do die off pretty quickly, but as some here have <br/>
mentioned in the thread about quitting, there is value to getting what you <br/>
need at the time out of whatever you are into...<br/>

Julie,<br/>
Boy can I relate!  I have never had my kids do the things that the kids in <br/>
the magazines do, but, they do voice some interest when I give them several <br/>
choices.  I get &quot;cool fact of the day&quot; &quot;word of the day&quot; and &quot;today in <br/>
history.  These things give you several choices, short little blips of the <br/>
subject, and if there is interest, we pursue it, if not we look for other <br/>
things.  This does help some, but there is still no &quot; MOM, I want to learn.&quot;  <br/>
So, I will be content to be a relaxed homeschooler, and take the best of the <br/>
unschooling that works for us.  There are many people on this list who are SO <br/>
helpful, I know you will get some good ideas. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024691491">What are your interests?  Do you spend time pursuing them?  Modeling the pursuit<br/>
of your interests can be the most important model they have.  Certainly<br/>
requiring study is at odds with your underlying hopes.  Gordon Neufeld ( a<br/>
developmental and clinical psychologist) was talking about the &quot;eclectic&quot;<br/>
approach to parenting that people have and how it doesn&#39;t work.  Behaviorism and<br/>
a developmental point of view are really quite mutually exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if learning is the same.  Allowing freedom of choice when we are<br/>
comfortable with the choices and then &quot;clamping down&quot; when we panic are mutually<br/>
exclusive behaviours.<br/>
<br/>
I think trying to give oneself over fully to the belief that the &quot;kid&#39;s alright&quot;<br/>
is the goal.  Once you really get that straight all else follows.<br/>
<br/>
Then of course it takes time for the kids to get over all the confusing, mixed<br/>
messages we have been sending for so long.<br/>
<br/>
Learning takes place all the time.  You can&#39;t always see it and it is certainly<br/>
not always quantifiable even if you can see it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, learning is taking place. I think that looking to your own interests and<br/>
modeling that is the most potent assist for kids in seeing what the love of<br/>
learning looks like.<br/>
<br/>
I also admit that I don&#39;t know the dynamics of large families very well.  Your<br/>
kids are really mostly very young.  Really really have faith.  Nurture their<br/>
attachment to you.  Don&#39;t nudge them from the nest.  Independence comes<br/>
naturally and at its own pace and really doesn&#39;t happen until the late teen<br/>
years for most kids.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy them for who they are now.  Don&#39;t let a bunch of your expectations and<br/>
unrealized dreams of your own contaminate their lives.  They are good and okay<br/>
and smart.<br/>
<br/>
Their motivation is theirs.  You can&#39;t make someone be motivated.  If they<br/>
really are just laid back types who like to just take what comes along.  (You&#39;ll<br/>
know maybe by the time they are 30 or so.) so what?  This work ethic thing is<br/>
vastly over rated.  Henry David Thoreau is needed more today than ever.<br/>
<br/>
You establish the flavor and tenor of your household along with your husband.<br/>
You set only the broadest of limits for the children especially as they grow<br/>
older.  Little ones naturally accept your definitions of how things are and then<br/>
their own view emerge when they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
I hear and see myself giving stirring little talks to people and I will publicly<br/>
confess that these are as much to myself as anyone else.  For me it is an effort<br/>
to overcome the devastation of my own childhood.  I was dealt some terrible<br/>
blows very early on which damaged my abilities to trust in the &quot;rightness&#39; of<br/>
anything.  They are blows which most people sustain in varying degrees.  In my<br/>
case they have contributed to a negativity and distrust which is poisonous.  I<br/>
am grateful that my children are resilient and forgiving.<br/>
<br/>
I am rambling.  I am also recovering from a 16 hour shift of overtime ....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-386843608">Seems to me that if I keep busy, then the kids are less likely to bicker.  I go to<br/>
the barn and do many things.  Sometimes they help, sometimes they just find<br/>
something on their own to do.<br/>
Same at the house.  If I keep busy (except when I&#39;m on the computer)  they are<br/>
more likely to keep themselves busy with something.  It usually ends up being<br/>
something that makes a total mess, but I guess that&#39;s better than the bickering.<br/>

I wanted to respond to this, because I also have two boys of almost those <br/>
ages (8 and 11 in Nov.)<br/>
I find it so hard to keep them moving in constructive ways.  Do you have any <br/>
tips?  I always feel like I&#39;m nagging at them and I hate it.  It also does <br/>
NOTHING to reduce the tension that all of this creates around here.<br/>
The worst problem I seem to have with these two boys is that it seems like <br/>
they are always picking on each other or the other sibs...not so much <br/>
physically, but verbally.  They always have to manipulate every situation or <br/>
boss each other or younger sibs around.  They&#39;re also both very negative and <br/>
competitive.  It&#39;s really dragging me down.  Is it something about these <br/>
middle ages...neither of them was like this before they turned 8!  Any <br/>
suggestions would be appreciated!<br/>
