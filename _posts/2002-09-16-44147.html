<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205979479">I was reading a book online last night and was pleasantly surprised <br/>
to see that he mentioned the continuum concept.  Also, he talks about <br/>
schools and how they don&#39;t always meet the needs of children.  He <br/>
quotes John Taylor Gatto.  I thought some might be interested in <br/>
checking out the book. It is called healing emotions with homeopathy. <br/>
