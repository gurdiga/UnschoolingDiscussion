<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That doesn&#39;t sound like a goal to me. That sounds like a<br/>
&gt; framework. Iow, I would say that a goal would be to help our kids<br/>
&gt; find a meaningful place in the adult world as responsbile,<br/>
&gt; competent adults. But I don&#39;t know if &quot;trusting that they will learn<br/>
&gt; what they need&quot; is a goal in the same way. It is a philosophy for<br/>
&gt; achieving a goal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son is young yet; he&#39;s 6.  If I think about it, I can already see where<br/>
his current interests could turn into a life should he want to go that way.<br/>
But so what, at this age.  I&#39;m not in the least bit worried about him living<br/>
a productive, meaningful life as an adult.  What he&#39;s into right now could<br/>
turn out to be his life&#39;s work, or more likely, it&#39;ll be a couple of cool<br/>
photos in the scrapbook that he looks at when he&#39;s an adult doing something<br/>
he&#39;s not yet even imagined doing.<br/>
<br/>
I think that some people live to work.  They LOVE their work, and it is<br/>
their life.  Other people work to live.  It pays the bills and enables them<br/>
to do what they want to do in the world.  I won&#39;t be upset if my son goes<br/>
either of those routes.  My goal is that he knows himself and likes himself<br/>
for who he is.  Anything else he needs can be learned when he decides he<br/>
needs it.  <br/>
