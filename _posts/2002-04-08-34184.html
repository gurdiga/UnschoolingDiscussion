 </span></blockquote>Are you totally willing to let the ideas be dropped? If you present <br/>
an idea, or point out something interesting that isn&#39;t contradictory <br/>
to unschooling.<br/>
If they are not allowed to say &quot;NO thanks&quot; and be totally respected <br/>
then that IS contradictory to unschooling.<br/>
From your previous messages it sounded like they didn&#39;t have full <br/>
choice to say no. Is this true?<br/>
Keeping workbooks or ANY kind of information or tools away from a <br/>
child can be contradictory to unschooling......<br/>
Can be I say, because I woulnd&#39;t leave a $50.00 paintbrush down for a <br/>
two year old to use.<br/>
<br/>
I think that unschooling isn&#39;t something you do. It&#39;s a lifestyle. <br/>
And if a parent suddenly decides (after even months) that we MUST do <br/>
A,B, C today (figuratively speaking of course) then it&#39;s <br/>
counterproductive to the idea of unschooling.<br/>
Why would the activity YOU deem important suddenly that day, be more <br/>
valuable than whatever the child would do without the coercion?<br/>

  This is very true. Until such time as you can truly let go of the apparent need to control the process, you don&#39;t realize what you are missing. Or rather what the young people are missing. It is truly incredible what a difference that trusts ultimately makes. Now that they are confident that this is how they will learn all those things they are passionate about comes out, and learning for the inner joy it brings happens continously. I truly resonate with this post and can see so much of our lives in it. Thanks for writing it.<br/>

they were doing just because they had chosen, themselves, to do it.<br/>

 I remember recently telling someone a story about my nephew - he was two or <br/>
three or so - (he&#39;s 21 now) and he was standing, staring into space, with his <br/>
finger poked into a hole in an upholstered couch. He was fingering the <br/>
padding inside - rubbing it gently between his thumb and finger. He was <br/>
mentally very FAR away &lt;G&gt;. It was a sensual experience he was having - <br/>
feeling the texture of it. My sister and I were about to take him off to <br/>
someplace or another and my sister stopped me from interrupting him - we <br/>
stood, sort of held our breaths, and watched him for a minute and then we <br/>
quietly backed away and did something else for a few minutes until he was <br/>
done and at a transition point.<br/>
<br/>
I had no kids then, but this little incident had such impact on my treatment <br/>
of my own kids later. It was SO respectful and, as we waited for him, my <br/>
sister said, &quot;This is GOOD for him - it is tactile experience, small motor <br/>
coordination, developing imagination, and much more.&quot; She pointed out that <br/>
&quot;educational materials&quot; existed  to give children these kinds of &quot; tactile <br/>
