Julie, you get my vote.<br/>
Recently there have been tallies made about how many people have been killed<br/>
by their own governments. I&#39;ll try to find the numbers. (Hope this isn&#39;t OT,<br/>
but no one has objected to this thread yet)  The numbers are as astronomical<br/>
as the ones for religions killing people, and for racial murdering, or<br/>
simple plunder and other reasons. The government killings include, of<br/>
course, Gallileo, Socretes, and Jesus. Then there are the 24 Salem<br/>
&quot;witches&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
It takes government to make a war.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know the penalties for homeschooling a child in the countries<br/>
in Europe in which it is prohibited?<br/>
<br/>
In Massachusetts, there is a homeschooling family whose children are under<br/>
the jurisdiction of the state dept of something, not for abuse or neglect of<br/>
any kind -- it has never been about inadequate parenting -- but for not<br/>
submitting a curriculum to the local school district.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This would be a sensationalist misrepresentation of what happened. It<br/>
suggests a picture of parents blindsided by the system because of missed<br/>
paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants fully realized what they were doing when they refused to submit<br/>
an education plan. They claimed that the school committee&#39;s process of<br/>
approval runs counter to their unschooling appraoch.<br/>
<br/>
(The paperwork is not at all burdensome. I use Carol Narigon&#39;s letter of<br/>
intent and send in a list of subjects and a sentence or two on each for<br/>
evaluation. Some towns ask for more but the case law says the method of<br/>
assessment must be approved by the parents.)<br/>
<br/>
The committee had no objection to the Bryants homeschooling or even<br/>
unschooling. They just wanted their paperwork. They had 2 years to work it<br/>
out. This was a stand on a principle -- Kim Bryant claimed the<br/>
&quot;Massachusetts Constitution protects her from needing to comply with the<br/>
state&#39;s home education regulations.&quot; (quote from Nicky Hardenbergh of MHLA,<br/>
the state HS group) (Kim Bryant discussed her position at *very* great<br/>
length -- so great it split the state list in 2 -- on the MAHomeschoolers<br/>
group on Yahoo.)<br/>
<br/>
They lost.<br/>

&gt; more and more so the other way around.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have it easy. Here in Kansas, when a child reaches the age of 7, you get <br/>
(online or directly from the Kansas Board of Education) a form of intent. You <br/>
fill out the name of your *home* school, your name, address, phone # (not <br/>
required) and the name of your *keeper of records* (usually you) address, <br/>
phone # (not required) That is it. You don&#39;t have to give your children&#39;s <br/>
ages or names. You do this one time, unless you have an address change. I <br/>
don&#39;t think they (KBOE) actually use this information for anything except to <br/>
compile a mailing list that is sold to various private, independent, and <br/>
charter schools. Who in turn send out colorful pamphlets and letters telling <br/>
hsers why they feel their idea of education is so like yours, so why don&#39;t <br/>
you send your dollars and children to their institution. I have read the law, <br/>
it tells me I am a non-accredited private school. Technically, I could school <br/>
others children as well. If I were so inclined, I could apply for and go <br/>
through the rigorous accreditation process. Why should I? There are many <br/>
non-accredited private schools in the state of Kansas. The Catholic schools <br/>
in the area are just now going through this process at the behest of the <br/>
Kansas City Arch Diocese. (The two neighborhood parishes are in their third <br/>
or fourth year of the five year long process) The local Catholic High School <br/>
has been issuing diplomas for years, many of the students graduated from the <br/>
school have gone on to college. This tells me that my homemade diploma (if I <br/>
choose to make and give one to Moly and Jack) will be accepted as well as <br/>
theirs. My point in all this rambling? Well, its like this. IF Kansas <br/>
required me to do as little as submit an education plan, I would do so. Why? <br/>
Because submitting an education plan doesn&#39;t, IMHO, go against my unschooling <br/>
values. Would I kowtow to the *establishment*? Yes, Plain and simple, my <br/>
children are the most important people in the world to me. Could I live in a <br/>
state like Pennsylvania, with their regulations? Probably not. And not <br/>
because the requirements are against my ideals, (because I know Unschoolers <br/>
exist and thrive in Pennsylvania) but because I am too lazy to have to go <br/>
through all those hoops. &lt;g&gt; This said, I just don&#39;t understand any ideal or <br/>
moral code that would allow me to be so antiestablishment as to go as far as <br/>
having Moly and Jack removed from my home. (I am antiestablishment enough) I <br/>
respect the Bryant&#39;s stand on how they feel best to raise their children. I <br/>
raise my kids that way too. What I don&#39;t understand is allowing my personal <br/>
opinion to be so rigid that a matter so small, would result in me not having <br/>
Moly asleep on the couch beside me right now. The Bryant&#39;s have made the <br/>
proverbial mountain out of a mole hill. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The children weren&#39;t removed from the home. The Bryants have physical<br/>
custody. They need to ask the state&#39;s permission (through DSS) to make any<br/>
changes in the care of their children (taking them out of state, moving for<br/>
example). But they are still homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It ain&#39;t pretty, that&#39;s for sure. The repercussions were certainly far worse<br/>
than the crime. And i&#39;ve never had any illusions of the state of MA being a<br/>
handsoff entity.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s also *not* an example of a poor innocent homeschooling family<br/>
dragged down by the oppressive state. It was mighty noble of the Bryants to<br/>
take a stand. But against what? It&#39;s not like the paperwork is a constant<br/>
thorn in the side. It&#39;s a fly the buzzes about at the end of the school year<br/>
until it&#39;s sent off. (Or buzzes about all summer in the case of some<br/>
procrastinators! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And this *really* isn&#39;t the forum to discuss it in because I&#39;m *way*<br/>
underinformed for a discussion. (Besides being way too state specific to be<br/>
useful to unschoolers in general.) If anyone has questions the place to go<br/>

That doesn&#39;t seem a fair assessment.<br/>

They could have described unschooling in educational terms, in open-classroom <br/>
terms.<br/>
<br/>
Carol Narigon&#39;s curriculum has much light and little &quot;curriculum.&quot;  It&#39;s been <br/>
out in public in a few places and is probably in the archives of this list <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Governments don&#39;t PREVENT domestic violence or child abuse. How exactly<br/>
do you think a government would intervene before anything happened? <br/>
<br/>
Court injunctions sometimes do it when it has gone to an extreme, but<br/>
the government never sees the inside of most households, and it should<br/>
stay that way!<br/>
<br/>
My state, FLorida is notorious for its extremely ineffective social<br/>
services agency. THey keep changing the social service agency&#39;s name<br/>
(Dept. of Children and Families is what it is called now) so hopefully<br/>
people will forget the kids who were just murdered, neglected or hurt,<br/>
and keep funding them. On the other hand I have seen testimony by many,<br/>
many families whose lives were ruined by social service agencies who<br/>
tore them apart, ripped kids out of their parents home for no good<br/>
reason by their own opinions and put them into foster homes where they<br/>
were raped or abused and neglected. <br/>
<br/>
BUt they change the name of their agency, rather than their<br/>
fundamentally flawed premise, that the government by intruding and<br/>
degrading the dignity and rights of its people can get them to &quot;act<br/>
better&quot;. Do you advocate spanking and punishing your child and use<br/>
threats of that to increase their judgment? It&#39;s just that the<br/>
government finds it very difficult to control people in a positive way.<br/>
I think that is what you are asking for. Punishment (though it has its<br/>
place) does not control people - it smashes them. A better idea of WHAT<br/>
to do for people and how to define roles, and helping people help<br/>
themselves is what is needed. That is a slow hard way to go for it means<br/>
one-on-one communication and understanding and if you don&#39;t really have<br/>
any idea how to help someone, you don&#39;t conceive it is possible - but it<br/>
is.<br/>
