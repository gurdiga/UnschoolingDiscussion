<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245665637">Hi All!<br/>
 <br/>
Here is something for ALL of us to do! Not just the kids, but us too!<br/>
 <br/>
Have you ever wanted to play with Bubblewrap and make it pop? :) But gosh<br/>
darn it, there just isn&#39;t any in the house! :)<br/>
 <br/>
Well, now you can.....<br/>
 <br/>
Check this out! :) My mom sent it to me for my boys! BUT I am having just as<br/>
much fun with it too! :)<br/>

 <br/>
If you just click on them one by one they will pop OR you can click the<br/>
Manic Mode button and then just go over the bubbles with your mouse and they<br/>
will pop as you cross over each one!  AND when you click on the &quot;fresh sheet<br/>
 button, it says &quot;Must have MORE!!!&quot; for more bubblewrap! :) It is the<br/>
funnest thing! :)<br/>
 <br/>
The boys and I are having a BLAST with this! :)<br/>
Have fun everyone! Enjoy!<br/>
 <br/>
