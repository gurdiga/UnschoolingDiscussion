Try going onto digest for a few days and then switching back. I&#39;m sorry <br/>
to say Yahoogroups can be a bit glitchy once in a while and sometimes <br/>
just making a change in your account can get things working right <br/>
again.<br/>

It was so bad on all my lists, I ended up changing email addresses.  That <br/>
fixed it.  Now I only use this email address for list mail, and the old one for <br/>

Well, I don&#39;t mind if they use it, but someone else wrote it and I suggested <br/>
it be put on a baby shirt.  I think it&#39;s be alright with me if these were sold <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538220972">Well, there really isn&#39;t a profit. The problem is that cafepress has <br/>
such a high base price that it&#39;s hard to mark anything up more than a <br/>
dollar or two and stil have it affordable.  They&#39;ve had the store for <br/>
about a year and all the &quot;money&quot; they&#39;ve earned has gone toward their <br/>
premium store payment and a few products that they&#39;ve bought to show <br/>
off at homeschooling activities as advertising.  <br/>
<br/>
They never actually gotten a check and when they do it will go toward <br/>
advertising.  They&#39;re planning on targeting unschooling conferences <br/>
so the money will probably end up there anyway. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a wonderful experience for them though even with the lack <br/>
of profits.  There&#39;s so much that they&#39;ve learned!<br/>

Ain&#39;t it the truth?  Sometimes I want to volunteer to babysit for my friends <br/>
just so I can do that kind of stuff.  What am I, crazy?  <br/>
<br/>
I try to enjoy this long, long respite from babydom, since I do have a <br/>
married son.  I keep expecting that phone call, but wishing and hoping it&#39;s years in <br/>
the future, after college.  :)<br/>

I volunteered to hold the coach&#39;s baby during Casey&#39;s gym practice <br/>
the other night. I got to rock him to sleep with his little body <br/>
snuggled against my chest and his little fuzzy head brushing up <br/>
against my cheek. Aaaaaahhhhh....<br/>

money.  It&#39;s also a lot more fun because of the detail and color <br/>
nuances that you just can&#39;t get with regular silk screening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779593298">We&#39;ve also added post cards (which would be good as gift cards for <br/>
any new baby gift), a small poster and several bigger shirts.  The <br/>
girls want to do one that says &quot;This teenager is a natural <br/>
product...&quot; I&#39;ll post when it&#39;s done.  Hmm...perhaps we should <br/>
add &quot;This mother is a natural product...&quot; :-)<br/>

It was my idea, Mary wrote it, and Karen said put it on onesies. I&#39;m <br/>
okay with your kids using it as long as they don&#39;t prevent anybody else <br/>
from using it, too.<br/>

&gt; Well, there really isn&#39;t a profit. The problem is that cafepress has<br/>
&gt; such a high base price that it&#39;s hard to mark anything up more than a<br/>
&gt; dollar or two and stil have it affordable.  They&#39;ve had the store for<br/>
&gt; about a year and all the &quot;money&quot; they&#39;ve earned has gone toward their<br/>
&gt; premium store payment and a few products that they&#39;ve bought to show<br/>
&gt; off at homeschooling activities as advertising.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They never actually gotten a check and when they do it will go toward<br/>
&gt; advertising.  They&#39;re planning on targeting unschooling conferences<br/>
&gt; so the money will probably end up there anyway. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s been a wonderful experience for them though even with the lack<br/>
&gt; of profits.  There&#39;s so much that they&#39;ve learned!<br/>
