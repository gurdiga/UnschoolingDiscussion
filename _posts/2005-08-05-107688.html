If the parent can come to think before acting, so can the child.    <br/>
&quot;Wait.   That&#39;s Holly&#39;s.   Do you want another one?&quot;<br/>
That neither praises the child for acting rashly nor condemns him.   It&#39;s the <br/>
way you might deal with a person who isn&#39;t also a child.   <br/>
<br/>
The examples given up above sound to me very condescending, and I can&#39;t help <br/>
but hear them in the poodle voice or in the droning on, kid-ignoring-mom tone <br/>
I&#39;ve heard from so many moms in parenting groups when they&#39;re really trying to <br/>
find a new way but they&#39;ve gone from physical restraint to just discussion <br/>
above the child&#39;s level of comprehension, or word count far beyond the child&#39;s <br/>
attention span.   It&#39;s as though their speech is really intended for the other <br/>
moms or the author of a book who&#39;s not even there.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t help to say &quot;the right thing&quot; if the child is already mentally or <br/>
physically off and gone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like music or dance.   If the child&#39;s actions and attentions have a <br/>
certain rhythm, the mom needs to learn how many beats she has to respond or react. <br/>
  She can stop the music entirely (take him aside and hold his hands and gaze <br/>
soulfully while she gives a speech only she is hearing) or she can take her <br/>
two or three second window, have a positive effect, and let him continue to <br/>
live and act (assuming he&#39;s not hurting anyone, and the examples above seemed <br/>
easily solveable without stopping all social dance and music).<br/>
<br/>
-=-This has helped my partner and me in looking at our own behaviors, and<br/>
in developing expectations of behaviors and treatments that really<br/>
apply to the whole family, not with one (higher) standard for kids and<br/>
another one for adults.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is important when people are going to be respectful of children.   It&#39;s <br/>
the soul of treating children as people.   But it&#39;s not about teaching or <br/>
discipline.   It&#39;s about mindfulness, respect, honesty and compassion.<br/>

and leave the rest.&quot; She describes useful principles; people who are <br/>
uncomfortable with words like &quot;discipline&quot; may find her helpful if they <br/>
&quot;read past&quot; the language. People who don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to &quot;read <br/>
past&quot; the language should probably not read her.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it doesn&#39;t feel like that in our house. And certainly we don&#39;t <br/>
use that syrupy tone. Sometimes we use a very strong, admiring tone, <br/>
very spontaneously, if our son&#39;s actions suggest that he is feeling <br/>
very strongly about something. Our &quot;wow&quot;s can be quite sincere! What it <br/>
feels like to me is trying to recognize that a child is trying to meet <br/>
a legitimate need, and also (for little ones) helping to give them the <br/>
language for their various feelings and needs. It also has to do with <br/>
recognizing that kids may not have all the information we do--one of <br/>
Bailey&#39;s examples is of a kid hoarding his birthday cupcakes, who might <br/>
simply not have any idea they weren&#39;t all meant for him, a piece of <br/>
information grownups take for granted but that might not be obvious to <br/>
a child.<br/>
<br/>
I probably could have thought of better examples; I didn&#39;t mean to <br/>
suggest that it&#39;s OK at our house for a kid to grab things that belong <br/>
to others. We have encouraged our older son to think before acting--if <br/>
the baby is grabbing something away, not to grab back but to take a <br/>
moment and figure out how to get it back without snatching or hitting, <br/>
and to ask a grownup for help if he needs it. And he&#39;s pretty good at <br/>
that. Solutions like you mention, such as, &quot;Can we find another one for <br/>
you?&quot; or &quot;Would you like me to help you find something else to play <br/>
with while you wait for him to be done with that?&quot; are very common at <br/>
our house, too. I simply meant to say that Bailey&#39;s philosophy of <br/>
attributing a positive motivation to behavior has been a fruitful idea <br/>
for us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have not gone to &quot;just discussion&quot; or to conversation above the <br/>
child&#39;s level of comprehension. Nor do we try to have a &quot;reasonable&quot; <br/>
conversation with a kid who is physically or emotionally agitated and <br/>
not able to hear it, though we do sometimes revisit things later. I <br/>
don&#39;t think either I or Bailey suggest saying &quot;the right thing&quot; to a <br/>
kid who can&#39;t listen, or grandstanding for the benefit of onlookers. <br/>
But I certainly know the phenomenon you&#39;re describing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Picky me, I&#39;d like to separate myself from the second example.   Way too many <br/>
words.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my kids are ADD or something (JOKING, kind of, for those who already <br/>
sat up too straight on that one &lt;g&gt;), but even Marty, the mellowest of them all, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have lasted through a 22 word message. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in a couple of discussions lately about movies from books, <br/>
specifically Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.   It&#39;s not necessary to put all the <br/>
book in, because a lot can be expressed by faces, eyes, gestures, posture, <br/>
glances, etc.   Some of that doesn&#39;t translate to these discussions, though, I <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m not a verbal person; I am.   But in a case of hurt <br/>
feelings and extricating a child from the act of cookie swiping or toy grabbing, I <br/>
think &quot;Wait—&quot; and a significant look or touch can do more than explanation.  <br/>
Maybe, in that moment, he&#39;ll realize what he&#39;s doing and put the item down and <br/>
think of a better course of action right then and there, and then it will be <br/>
his.   Maybe he&#39;ll look at the mom in a &quot;huh?&quot; kind of way and by then she&#39;ll <br/>
have had a couple of seconds to think of the best two or five word follow-on.   <br/>
&quot;Wait a while&quot; or &quot;There are more in the fridge&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s find another one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s my long years of focus on learning instead of teaching.   If every <br/>
instance calls up a mini-lecture on the principles involved, by the time that <br/>
child is a few years older, the mom speeches will be like the wallpaper.    <br/>
<br/>
I like the idea that moms should think of saying &quot;NO&quot; as though the child <br/>
comes with 200 tickets at birth.   Some moms use them all up the first year and <br/>
the child ignores &quot;no&quot; forever after.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the same with speeches.   Save them for the big stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Helping children learn seems to require fewer words than teaching children <br/>
what.    All they can do is learn anyway.   If they feel the mom owns it all, it <br/>
won&#39;t be theirs.   Their &quot;good decisions&quot; will become obedience, or being a <br/>
mama&#39;s yes-boy.    <br/>
<br/>
I have tried to instill my voice in my children&#39;s heads, no denying that, but <br/>
I want it to be the voice of reason and humor and &quot;wait, think&quot; and for their <br/>
mom messages to be short and useful, not droning with a big &quot;off&quot; switch next <br/>
to them.    <br/>
<br/>
-=-I simply meant to say that Bailey&#39;s philosophy of<br/>
attributing a positive motivation to behavior has been a fruitful idea<br/>

<br/>
Can you give us examples of that in your own real life, from your own <br/>
experience?   I think that would have more life and breath on this list than <br/>
recommending a book that isn&#39;t coming from an unschooling place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370253025">I agree that a great deal of the material (as well as the title) is <br/>
not ideal for unschooling. The title, in fact, doesn&#39;t seem to fit <br/>
the book at all and probably hurts her sales. <br/>
<br/>
As background- I found the book being discussed on <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/">http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/</a> when looking for advice for a <br/>
Dobson follower. She was only willing to read Christian authors. I <br/>
was not looking to &quot;discipline&quot; my kids. I was, however, intrigued <br/>
by the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should list more specifics about why I DID like the book.<br/>
Some of these ideas may sound obvious to you, but it came as a shock <br/>
to me to hear things spelled out so simply. The family environment I <br/>
was raised in did nothing to help me learn these skills...<br/>
<br/>
These are the 7 &quot;attitude shifts&quot; she discusses and what I thought <br/>
about them.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude shift 1: Harnessing the Power of Perception  (no one can <br/>
make you angry without your permission)<br/>
Reason: to own your own upset<br/>
<br/>
Notice how your thoughts create your feelings. when you feel angry, <br/>
overwhelmed or anxious, check to see what you are thinking, where is <br/>
your mind directed?<br/>
How often do you use blaming language (You are making me so _____)?<br/>
When you blame others, you are giving up your control (of yourself).<br/>
<br/>
I caught myself using blaming language more often than I expected <br/>
and have been working hard to own my feelings and accept them. <br/>
Strangely, I could accept my kids having big feelings, but was <br/>
punishing myself whenever I got overwhelmed by similar emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 2: Harnessing the Power of Attention<br/>
Reason: what you focus on you get more of<br/>
<br/>
Pay Attention to your focus. Are you focusing on what you want or on <br/>
what you dont want?&quot; When you are upset, it is almost always because <br/>
you are focusing on what you DO NOT want!<br/>
<br/>
I am constantly trying to frame things in terms of what I DO want <br/>
now. I hadn&#39;t realized how often I said &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t know <br/>
how&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t want this&quot;, etc. I was priming myself to feel BAD. It <br/>
is hard for me sometimes to even come up with a positive statement <br/>
when I am getting overwhelmed. I am working so hard to pay attention <br/>
and make this change. It does work. Changing what I focus on is <br/>
changing my attitude and my actions. I feel like I can set a more <br/>
positive example for my kids now.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 3: Harnessing the Power of Free Will <br/>
Reason: The only person you can make change is yourself<br/>
<br/>
Change your &quot;shoulds&quot; to &quot;coulds&quot;; Then make a choice and live with <br/>
it. Instead of saying I &quot;should&quot; go to the store or I &quot;should&quot; write <br/>
those thank-you cards, say I &quot;could&quot; do _______, and then choose. It <br/>
is free will. YOU have the right to choose what to do.<br/>
Allow others to have their own thoughts and feelings. Pay attention <br/>
to what you feel when people disagree with you. (Most of us feel <br/>
threatened). <br/>
<br/>
I lived in a world of &quot;shoulds&quot;- guilt self-imposed that I put at <br/>
the feet of my mother or grandmother. I willingly felt bad for not <br/>
doing what &quot;they&quot; wanted. I feel so much more powerful and in <br/>
control since I have been owning my actions. Many times I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
complete a task because it became this huge albatross of obligation <br/>
and sucked away any of my desire to do it. I have felt more <br/>
independent and strong since I have been choosing my actions instead <br/>
of trying to make other people happy at my own expense.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 4: Harnessing the Power of unity<br/>
Reason: to focus on connecting instead of trying to be special<br/>
<br/>
Take five minutes or more, daily and &quot;just be&quot; with each of your <br/>
children. Put aside any agenda, and simply enjoy their company. <br/>
<br/>
This one wasn&#39;t too powerful for me, but I am with them almost 24/7, <br/>
so 5 minutes sounds ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 5: Harnessing the Power of Love<br/>
Reason: to see the best in one another<br/>
<br/>
Wish People Well. Do this silently from your heart when you are <br/>
standing in lines, driving, or passing people as you walk. Give this <br/>
gift to everyone you see. Notice how you feel when you do this.<br/>
Begin each day being grateful for at least three things. Before you <br/>
go to bed, tell all your family members how thankful you are for <br/>
their presence in your life. Notice what this does for your energy <br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
This is where the idea of attributing the best possible intentions <br/>
to a child was covered. I think I do pretty well with this one. <br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 6: Harnessing the power of Acceptance<br/>
Reason: this moment is as it is<br/>
<br/>
This was a big one. She talked about not making blanket statements <br/>
like &quot;we don&#39;t hit in this house&quot; after someone has just hit. You <br/>
deny the present by making such statements. Accept what is, AS IT IS!<br/>
Make choices based on what IS.<br/>
<br/>
I often fall back on how things &quot;should&quot; be. I was raised in a very <br/>
punishment/reward centered home and learned that if I did A, then <br/>
B &quot;should&quot; happen. I have found myself dissapointed a great deal <br/>
when what I expected and wanted didn&#39;t happen. I am working on <br/>
accepting things as they are.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Practice being peaceful in the moment by noticing things and <br/>
describing what you see, without judgements. Notice the weather, <br/>
plants outdoors, shadows, smells and sounds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Add a ritual to your childs bedtime routine that involves saying <br/>
goodnight to her body parts. for example, Im going to say goodnight <br/>
to your ears (touch the ears) your chin, elbows.....&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This has helped me be more present and focus on just enjoying my <br/>
kids and making up our own special time at night instead of focusing <br/>
on trying to get them to sleep as fast as possible. As a side <br/>
benefit, we are all happier and they do fall asleep more easily. (I <br/>
am sure they felt my fatigue and desire for them to sleep before and <br/>
I was probably noticibly &quot;going through the motions&quot; My kids are 2 <br/>
and 3 1/2, so I do help them wind down at night (when they are ready)<br/>
<br/>
Attitude Shift 7: Harnessing the Power of Attention<br/>
Reason: Conflict offers an opportunity to teach<br/>
<br/>
Whenever conflict arises, breathe deeply and remind <br/>
yourself &quot;conflict is an opportunity to teach and learn&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Focus on Responding to conflict rather than trying to eliminate it.<br/>
THIS is probably the most important thing I could have read!<br/>
My kids are only 18 months apart and we have conflicts fairly <br/>
regularly. I was raised in a family where my main objective was to <br/>
avoid conflict at all cost. It is a scary place for me to be <br/>
emotionally and I was trying to get my kids to &quot;just get along&quot; and <br/>
not seeing the benefit to all of us in their inherent struggles.<br/>
Now I am working on handling my emotions and helping them find ways <br/>
to get what they want. They seem to be better at it than me :)<br/>
<br/>
I know this was a super long post, but I though maybe more info. <br/>
would help show WHAT, in particular, I liked about the book. I am <br/>
still early in this unschooling journey and most of my time is spent <br/>
becoming a better person for myself and hopfully making some of <br/>
these ideas second nature for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
If these ideas are all obvious to you, be GLAD!<br/>
I have been changing a great deal since reading this book because it <br/>
just wasn&#39;t obvious to me.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Solutions like you mention, such as, &quot;Can we find another one for<br/>
&gt;  &gt; you?&quot; or &quot;Would you like me to help you find something else to play<br/>
&gt;  &gt; with while you wait for him to be done with that?&quot; are very common <br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt;  &gt; our house, too.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Picky me, I&#39;d like to separate myself from the second example.   Way <br/>
&gt; too many<br/>
&gt;  words.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Consider yourself separated. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my 4yo has a long attention span --22 words doesn&#39;t seem like a <br/>
&quot;speech&quot; to us at all. But it is true that sometimes it works best to <br/>
do something like what you also describe--a one-word intervention like <br/>
&quot;wait,&quot; after which it is possible to have a conversation, if <br/>
necessary. You&#39;re right that &quot;Would you like me to help you find <br/>
something else to play with&quot; is not usually the appropriate <br/>
attention-getter! What you also describe, of a kid being able to take <br/>
the next steps independently after &quot;wait&quot; is also true to our <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
My partner and I make a conscious effort not to repeat messages beyond <br/>
their useful life. We also don&#39;t lecture in the sense of articulating <br/>
the moral of the story (like, say, &quot;Now, see, if you had worn your coat <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t be cold now,&quot; or &quot;if you hadn&#39;t started blowing bubbles <br/>
when the glass was still full, there wouldn&#39;t be a big mess now. Next <br/>
time, wait until you&#39;ve drunk some of the milk.&quot;). But that&#39;s not on <br/>
the immediate topic.<br/>
<br/>
  I like the idea that moms should think of saying &quot;NO&quot; as though the <br/>
child<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  comes with 200 tickets at birth.   Some moms use them all up the <br/>
&gt; first year and<br/>
&gt;  the child ignores &quot;no&quot; forever after.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like this too! I&#39;ve been experimenting (for purposes of my own) with <br/>
having no-free days. Fun! And requires creativity!<br/>
<br/>
Somebody should actually hand out the tickets before moms leave the <br/>
hospital. Would be much more useful than the diaper bags packed with <br/>
formula samples they give out now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  -=-I simply meant to say that Bailey&#39;s philosophy of<br/>
&gt;  attributing a positive motivation to behavior has been a fruitful idea<br/>
&gt;  for us.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Can you give us examples of that in your own real life, from your own<br/>
&gt;  experience?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, let me think a minute.<br/>
<br/>
OK, here&#39;s one thing that we sailed through but that seems to give some <br/>
other moms we know fits: kids reaching the stage, around the age of <br/>
2-3, where they ask for a certain food and then change their mind and <br/>
then change their mind again and then change their mind again until the <br/>
mom is about to tear her hair out. I figured that at that age, my son <br/>
was working on a pretty complicated developmental task: trying to learn <br/>
how to know what food he had a taste for before he had seen or tasted <br/>
it (I did not, as others sometimes seem to, think he was working on the <br/>
task of figuring out how far he could push his mother or how much he <br/>
could &quot;get away with.&quot;). That seems like a big, complicated task to me, <br/>
and one that even grown-ups don&#39;t always get right, as anyone who has <br/>
ever looked at their plate in a restaurant and said, &quot;I shoulda ordered <br/>
the salmon&quot; can attest.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at it that way helped me to avoid getting angry with him, or <br/>
trying to make it into a &quot;discipline&quot; issue (&quot;I cooked you that egg <br/>
because you asked for it and you are by golly going to eat it!&quot;). I did <br/>
think about how much I was willing to do without resentment, and in <br/>
general that was limited to cooking one thing, with additional choices <br/>
not requiring cooking. That was also about the time we invented the <br/>
&quot;sampler plate,&quot; where, if he couldn&#39;t make up his mind, I would just <br/>
put two bites of everything I could think of onto a plate for him to <br/>
look at and taste. This really helped him--he would either just eat the <br/>
sampler plate, or after having it to look at and maybe taste, know <br/>
which things he wanted more of. Eventually, that stage passed as he got <br/>
better at anticipating what food would taste good to him, but he <br/>
sometimes still asks for a sampler plate just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Eric was also able to find his own positive motivation recently, and <br/>
describe it to me. He was taking a music class that he loved. The <br/>
guidelines for behavior at the class were that kids were not required <br/>
to participate in any activity, and they weren&#39;t prevented from doing <br/>
something else, but they weren&#39;t to do things that interfered with <br/>
other people being able to attend to the leader, or participate. My son <br/>
was wild in this class! He could not stay still; he could not confine <br/>
himself to a walk; he would actively try to recruit other kids for <br/>
rough games unrelated to the class activities. When we talked about <br/>
this, he told me that this behavior was because he loved the class so <br/>
much and was so excited to be there that he just had to express it <br/>
physically (&quot;I&#39;m so happy that my body just wants to get up and jump <br/>
around!&quot;). He wasn&#39;t &quot;misbehaving&quot; or &quot;being bad&quot; and the answer wasn&#39;t <br/>
to try to force him to sit still or move quietly in music class. He was <br/>
able to articulate the positive motivation behind his behavior.<br/>
<br/>
We still haven&#39;t solved this problem; he wants to take the class again <br/>
this fall, but he is pretty sure he will still want to jump around when <br/>
he is there. But we haven&#39;t had conflict about it, which is perhaps why <br/>
he can tell me honestly that he thinks his behavior will continue to <br/>
violate the class guidelines.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about the positive motivation behind a behavior, or thinking <br/>
about the development task our son might be working on, helps us not <br/>
fall into adversarial thinking with regard to him. If he&#39;s working on <br/>
learning something, of course we want to help him learn it. If he has a <br/>
need or a desire, of course we want that to get met.<br/>
<br/>
This works for grown-ups, too. If I&#39;m getting cranky with the kids or <br/>
my partner, or letting the housework sink below my usual low standards, <br/>
it&#39;s not because I&#39;m &quot;bad.&quot; It&#39;s a sign that I have an unmet <br/>
need--usually for a good stretch of quiet alone time. I might be trying <br/>
to meet my need for quiet time during the times I would otherwise be <br/>
beating back the forces of chaos and dog hair; that doesn&#39;t work from a <br/>
house-cleanliness perspective and neither is it very quality quiet <br/>
time. So I need to find a better way to meet that need, usually with my <br/>
partner&#39;s help. If he and I can remember that cranky behavior means <br/>
some other un-met need, we can respond to each other more lovingly <br/>
instead of escalating.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t intending to push anyone to read Beckey Bailey; someone else <br/>
mentioned her and I just wanted to second that we had found her useful <br/>
as well, despite the book&#39;s  terrible title. But I now officially <br/>
declare that I have nothing left to say about Beckey Bailey (smile).<br/>

than what I&#39;m doing - I can change and things will be better&quot;.  It<br/>
really helped me shift into a different mindset regarding parenting, as<br/>
well as learn skills I didn&#39;t have from my parents.   It helped me<br/>
realize that many of my frustrations with raising children were due to<br/>
my own attitudes and initiated changes that ultimately led me to the<br/>
type of unschooling people on this list describe.  Without it, I might<br/>
still have been an unschooler, but I might not have gotten past the<br/>
actively and passively coercive parenting mentality as quickly.   I<br/>
haven&#39;t read it since becoming more unschool-y in my thinking, so I&#39;m<br/>
not sure if it would totally align with my current thinking and I don&#39;t<br/>

book really affected me positively.  <br/>

I agree that a great deal of the material (as well as the title) is <br/>
not ideal for unschooling. ...<br/>

&gt; than what I&#39;m doing - I can change and things will be better&quot;.  It<br/>
&gt; really helped me shift into a different mindset regarding parenting, as<br/>
&gt; well as learn skills I didn&#39;t have from my parents.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with Kiersten and Alyson.  I read this book when my son <br/>
was 3.5 and my daughter was a newborn, so it was before I had started to <br/>
read heavily at the unschooling sites/groups.  I had also read some <br/>
other &quot;positive discipline&quot; books but I found the Bailey book to be the <br/>
best and most eye-opening.  It helped me just as much with my <br/>
relationships with adults as it did with my kids.  Especially the part <br/>
about accepting things as how they are and &quot;what you focus on you get <br/>
more of.&quot;  I consider it to have been a good building block (along with <br/>
NVC) for the construction of our unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
Since then I have found that I get most everything I need in terms of <br/>
parenting philosophy from radical unschooling and I really don&#39;t think <br/>
in terms of discipline any more.  Still, I heartily recommend the book <br/>
to other young parents who may not now or ever have an interest in <br/>
unschooling.  It&#39;s far better than some of the other stuff they could be <br/>
reading.<br/>
