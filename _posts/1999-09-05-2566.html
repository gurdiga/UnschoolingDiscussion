 </span></blockquote>I think (and use) public schools as a public utility.  They deliver<br/>
their &quot;adequate&quot; service  in pre-determined way to pre-determined public<br/>
clients.  They are not required to deliver their resources or to other<br/>
clients, in any other ways unless their bosses, the taxpayers, instruct<br/>
them to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, it is often good public relations (and good business) for<br/>
the public utility to be flexible, to capture markets in new ways, and<br/>
to be good neighbors.  Our personal experience is that we can often be<br/>
successful in gaining access to the resources OUR WAY (and even getting<br/>
them to create new ones) when we capitalize on what they perceive to be<br/>
in their own interest.<br/>
In other words, treat them with respect and as potential allies.<br/>
<br/>
Entitlement, though?  Why?<br/>
