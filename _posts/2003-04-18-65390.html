years, we ran a theater company together where I did most of the<br/>
administrative work and we did much of the artistic work together (but<br/>
traded off performing).<br/>
<br/>
We are both theater people, but we have to do other things too. Dh is a solo<br/>
variety performer, that&#39;s most of our $$. We both teach theater here and<br/>
there, I write grants and he does a part-time thing at a law firm.<br/>
<br/>
No two days alike in our household!<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br/>
