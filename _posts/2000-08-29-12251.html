while now, so I would guess it is pretty normal.<br/>
<br/>
I would keep reminding him that HIS behavior is making it impossible for him <br/>
to continue playing the game.  As in &quot;You won&#39;t let yourself enjoy the game.  <br/>
It is up to you how you behave&quot;, or something to that effect.  I would avoid <br/>
an open contradiction because it is an invitation to a fight/power struggle; <br/>
saying it is not your fault, but his, for instance.  Just keep repeating that <br/>
it is his responsibility to behave properly.<br/>
<br/>
(My SIL tries to win with a power play.  It does not work.  She ends up <br/>
forcibly putting her 6 yr old in her room for a time out or removing her from <br/>
the game physically.  Sooner or later mom gets tired and the child &#39;wins&#39;.  <br/>
IMO everyone loses in a power struggle.  So, try to stay detached enough to <br/>
not take it personally...or at least fake well enough to not let on.)<br/>

development. Mine have sure gone through it. The natural consequence is that <br/>
no one wants to play with you, so they do get it eventually.<br/>

Can you say &quot;testing the envelope&quot;?? Bet your son can. And yes, as nearly as<br/>
I can tell from personal experience with my two kids, it is normal 5 yo<br/>
behavior to be a poor loser. That&#39;s one of the many reasons why God sents<br/>
kids to PARENTS instead of just releasing them into the wild!! Hang in<br/>
there! You&#39;re doing fine!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My two oldest children, 3 and 5, have recently discovered games such<br/>
&gt; as Go Fish, Old Maid, Memory (the card game) and such. Since this<br/>
&gt; time my 5yos has started to display poor loosing manners. If it looks<br/>
&gt; like he is loosing the game or will loose the game he will have a<br/>
&gt; fit, throw his cards down and sit and pout. I finally told him that<br/>
&gt; the behavior was not appropriate and that everyone wins sometimes and<br/>
&gt; everyone looses sometimes. Tonight I ended up sending him to bed<br/>
&gt; early because he would not sit still during the game of Memory we<br/>
&gt; were playing and he kept messing up the cards we had laid on the<br/>
&gt; floor. Finally, after telling him repeatedly that he needed to sit<br/>
&gt; still and quit jumping around I made him sit out of the game. He sat<br/>
&gt; on the opposate side of the room while DD and I finished the game. At<br/>
&gt; the start of the next game I told him that if he would sit still then<br/>
&gt; he could come and join the game with us which he decided not to. And<br/>
&gt; that was fine except that he kept complaining that he wanted to play<br/>
&gt; the game but &quot;Mommy won&#39;t let me.&quot; I repeated that he could play with<br/>
&gt; us, and that we wanted him to play with us, and that he would have to<br/>
&gt; sit still and that all his jumping around was messing up the cards.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, after his repeated complaining I finally sent him to bed. I<br/>
&gt; know a lot of his problem was that he was tired. I guess what I want<br/>
&gt; to know is this type of behavior normal for a 5yob. This is not the<br/>
&gt; first time he has had a fit over loosing a game and lately he seems<br/>
&gt; to be doing things that he knows he is not supposed to and then gets<br/>
&gt; angery with me when I disapline him. It has been going on for about a<br/>
&gt; month now and I&#39;m really getting tired of it. I just don&#39;t know if it<br/>
&gt; is a phase he is going through or if I should be wondering if<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  Perfectly normal. IMO<br/>
<br/>
Learning to lose is part of learning the game and he hasn&#39;t learned that yet. <br/>
<br/>
And, as you say, he was tired.  I have to admit, even tho I know all the <br/>
world says we should read to the kids at bedtime, we are all too tired and <br/>
cranky even for that, let alone a game.<br/>
<br/>
And I have also discovered that if I lose (and moan & groan a little but not <br/>
too much and hate losing but don&#39;t take it too seriously and immediately <br/>
challenge them to a rematch and threaten that I am going to get them this <br/>
time!!) my kids are starting to get the hang of losing.<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;d say, it&#39;s pretty normal sounding!!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579955783">Hi Corallyn,<br/>
<br/>
What a cool name!  I love it.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, your 5 yo&#39;s behavior sounds pretty normal to me.  That&#39;s exactly what <br/>
mine did at that age (which was only 2 years ago).  I thought he&#39;d never grow <br/>
out of it, but somehow, all of a sudden, he just snapped out of it.  Now, he <br/>
cheers the winner.  Last weekend the family played an extended game of <br/>
Monopoly, and I won.  I wondered if some of that old disappointment would <br/>
rear it&#39;s ugly head, but he just said, Well, Mom, I&#39;ll get you next time.  <br/>
How about a game of Sorry?<br/>
<br/>
I like the way you&#39;re handling his behavior.  I would step in as soon as <br/>
things started to break down and give him choices:  either sit quietly and <br/>
enjoy the game, or go somewhere else, or you might try telling him, People <br/>
who sit quietly get to play.<br/>

It sounds pretty familiar to me.  When my son was 5 he would always insist on <br/>
quitting if he fell behind in a board game and it looked like he would lose.  <br/>
For awhile, we avoided playing games with guests, and sometimes I stepped in <br/>
and finished playing his player with a guest, so as not to leave that person <br/>
hanging due to poor sportsmanship.  My son&#39;s almost 6 and a half now, and <br/>
this isn&#39;t an issue any more, (although he still likes to win).  We do some <br/>
handicapping in some games to keep the adults from having a major advantage.  <br/>
Other games, like Uno, we play on an even footing.<br/>
