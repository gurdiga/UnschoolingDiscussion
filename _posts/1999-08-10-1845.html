&lt;&lt; It was so scary when he was younger and I was such a &quot;rotten&quot; parent<br/>
 (ask those parents with well behaved toddlers).  I encourage all of you to<br/>
 hang in there. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Ah, thanks for the kind words, coming at exactly the right time, as we&#39;re <br/>
struggling again (still?!) with respectful parenting of a spirited 4-1/2 year <br/>
old son.  On good days we think of him in terms like &quot;free spirited,&quot; &quot;mind <br/>
of his own,&quot; &quot;a leader, not a follower,&quot; &quot;inquisitive and curious.&quot;  Other <br/>
days I have less wonderful descriptions running through my mind.  ::::sigh::::<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll keep hanging in there, hoping and believing that what we&#39;re doing is <br/>
right, knowing that other parenting choices may alleviate some of the <br/>
stresses we face as parents but may not be the best choices for the long-term <br/>
well-being of our son.<br/>
