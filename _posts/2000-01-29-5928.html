<div id="ygrps-yiv-836283752">Just got my son&#39;s report card back from the best teacher in the first grade<br/>
and here is a laugh for you all:<br/>
from the comments section<br/>
&quot;Kyle has strong math skills and is deveopling a sound foundation in<br/>
reading.........<br/>
He works slowly and carefully in all areas, and sometimes gets off task<br/>
talking to his friends. Often he is not finished with independent work when<br/>
it is time to move on to the next activity.<br/>
<br/>
My assessment:<br/>
My kid is a success in that room because of his intelligence and if he<br/>
weren&#39;t naturally into it or bored he will talk to his friends and so what<br/>
if he does stop and talk now and then don&#39;t we all do that as adults? Don&#39;t<br/>
we want them to learn how to be social? When I taught we encouraged dialogue<br/>
amoung the students. Why can&#39;t each child finish their activities in their<br/>
own time? Obviously he is careful and slow because he wants to do a good job<br/>
or maybe he fears doing a less than perfect one because of it why penalize<br/>
him by forcing him to hurry up and be a slob and a dummy just to keep up?<br/>
She wanted him to come to class 15 minutes earlier every day.  This is good<br/>
fuel for my fire as I need it to help do the necessary stuff to get him out<br/>
of there! I chose this teacher and know she is the best of what little there<br/>
was for my son. I don&#39;t regret that but don&#39;t want to go through this every<br/>
year either.<br/>
Some of the activities in her class are really cool and meaningful hands on<br/>
integrated curriculum whole language, multicultural etc. science is great<br/>
but none are so cool that they are worth making my kid feel bad if he isn&#39;t<br/>
able to finish quickly! This teacher is NOT a boring teacher she is sort of<br/>
on &quot;speed&quot; IMHO  and that is similar to the many cut throat college students<br/>
I met as an undergrad all in a hurry to end up with big bucks in their<br/>
pockets some day and later collapse and die of heart attacks from the pace<br/>
of their lives. (She is taking a 6 week leave of absense herself due to a<br/>
shoulder/neck sports injury.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596058318">When we did a logos series at a local church, my daughter rarely<br/>
&quot;finished&quot; any of her projects in time, while most of the schooled kids<br/>
rushed through and were done in just a few minutes.  They were five year<br/>
olds, but most had been in school since age 3.  After all, these were all<br/>
good families who knew how important preschool is for future success!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775198184">Mary Ellen,<br/>
The only preschool experience I ever wanted my kids to enjoy was the Waldorf<br/>
school they really  have a clue about children&#39;s development and needs in<br/>
the Kindergarten  too bad they don&#39;t take that philosophy with them however.<br/>
No rushing or spending full days there for most of those kids mine went 2 am<br/>
a week for a few months till I realized I couldn&#39;t afford it and I loved to<br/>
hang with them there. Does anyone here combine the Oak Meadow stuff with an<br/>
unschooling philosophy? Just curious I know they are very structured their<br/>
curriculum and teacher directed but I wonder if there is a way to use the<br/>
stuff they do without spending all the money just to get inspired. I want to<br/>
learn how to play the recorder and also knit and think if I do it myself my<br/>
kids may want to join me which is the Waldorf Kindergarten philosophy and<br/>
Native American of being a role model but carry it over to other aspects in<br/>
life using story telling and teaching writing through art in a child<br/>
centered way.<br/>
