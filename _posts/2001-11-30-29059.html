<div id="ygrps-yiv-615440497"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;I went on a date with a guy a few weeks ago who was telling me how great<br/>
&gt;he though John Rosemond was.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So who *is* John Rosemond?<br/>
Tia<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a newspaper columnist/child psychologist?/complete jerk(IMO hee hee).<br/>
Our local paper prints a weekly column of his.  I could sum it up overall by<br/>
saying he thinks (paraphrasing)....&quot;kids these days could use a good<br/>
spanking to get them in line.  parents are responsible for controlling their<br/>
children&#39;s behavior....and making them do things that are *good* for them&quot;<br/>
A real proponent of &quot;I spanked/controlled/dominated my children when they<br/>
were young and they turned out fine.&quot;<br/>
I admit to reading his column for a few reasons<br/>
a) lots of people give credence to what he says...I like to keep somewhat<br/>
abreast of how others think (mainstreamers.....I&#39;m propbably considered a<br/>
bit odd for respecting my children as whole people)<br/>
b) sometimes it&#39;s positively hilarious.<br/>
