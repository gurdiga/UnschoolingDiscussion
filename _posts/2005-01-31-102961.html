No, I  don&#39;t want to lie about it.  I think I just need to be more <br/>
creative  with it!  Plus, that wouldn&#39;t be a good thing for my kids to  <br/>
see.<br/>

 <br/>
You live in Missouri?  You&#39;re making it way harder than it is:<br/>
 <br/>
5. A parent who is home schooling a child must maintain the following  <br/>
records: <br/>
a. A plan book, diary, daily log, or other written record indicating  the <br/>
subjects taught and the activities engaged in with the student.<br/>
b. A  portfolio containing samples of the student&#39;s academic work.<br/>
c. A record of  evaluation of the student&#39;s academic progress.<br/>
d. Other written, or credible  evidence equivalent to a, b, and c.<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t keep a log.  Keep a &quot;written record&quot;.  Jot a few  notes.  It&#39;s not a <br/>
tape recording of everything he said or did.  It&#39;s  the highlights, not 1000 <br/>
hours.  And the law says you must &quot;offer&quot; 1000  hours.  It doesn&#39;t mean you have <br/>
to sit down with him for 1000 hours NOR  does it mean you have to LOG 1000 <br/>
hours.  A thousand hours of his life is a  1000 hours of you offering freedom to <br/>
learn *in the basics* and in many, many  advanced things.   <br/>
And the other thing is, you don&#39;t even have to REGISTER! <br/>
7. The law is permissive in the area of registering. The statute says the  <br/>
parent may notify the superintendent of schools or the recorder of county  deeds <br/>
in the county where the parents reside. This is to be done before  September <br/>
1 annually. However, the law says may, and it is not  mandatory.<br/>
No one&#39;s going to come ask for your log books if you&#39;re not even  registered. <br/>
  <br/>
You really should unsubscribe from HSLDA&#39;s stuff.  It&#39;s fear-mongering  at <br/>
its finest. <br/>

then I don&#39;t see why they would say that.  Unfortunately it&#39;s not very <br/>

trouble.<br/>

<br/>
They had to go to court for some OTHER reason and were asked for their <br/>
log. I&#39;m sure that is the case. There is no way anybody KNOWS if you&#39;re <br/>
keeping your log or not unless they take you to court and the court <br/>
asks for it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you getting your info from HSLDA?  Please find secular <br/>
homeschoolers in your area and find out the truth.<br/>

I  wouldn&#39;t do it at all, personally. <br/>

~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Neither would I, nor do I.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have homeschooled underground in 2 much stricter states than Missouri,  and <br/>
I was never ever in fear of being turned in or caught up with.  (I&#39;m no  <br/>
longer underground.)<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine why anyone would keep records if they didn&#39;t even have to  <br/>
register.<br/>
