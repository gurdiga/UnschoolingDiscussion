<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023405134">thanks Lisa, your testamonie was good. my kids are teens now and its too<br/>
late! :-(<br/>
but dd and i came to an agreement on the dishes and bathroom. she hate<br/>
dishes and i hate bathroom. and i actually like dishes and she doesn&#39;t<br/>
mind bathroom. so we do it this way but i still nag over WHEN the br<br/>
gets done and i shouldn&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645687555">I wanted to get in on this thread about chores.<br/>
<br/>
First off, I have six children (soon to be 7) and we live in a 1300 sq. ft. <br/>
house.  We also have a 90 lb. golden lab who is mostly inside and a cat who <br/>
is mostly outside (by choice!)<br/>
My dh works approx. 70 hrs per week in a town one hour from here, so add 12 <br/>
hours of commuting per week to that 70 hrs. and that&#39;s how much he&#39;s gone!<br/>
It would be impossible for me to do all the chores by myself.<br/>
We fought with this issue for years and finally had several family meetings <br/>
and came up with these ideas...<br/>
We divided the work into major zones and major times of day when they need to <br/>
be done.  For example, we have three major daily task areas:  Kitchen, Pets <br/>
and Pick-up and <br/>
Laundry.  In each of those areas, there are specific tasks that need to be <br/>
done.  They are posted.  Each week (by choice of the kids), these areas are <br/>
rotated.  Only the three older childred (8,10,12) take rotations of these <br/>
chores.<br/>
Dishes are done on a rotation basis, too.  The assigned kitchen person does <br/>
breakfast, the three older each do 2 days/wk for lunch and Dad and I always <br/>
do supper.<br/>
 The 6 yo does two chores each day...pick-up basket (he goes around putting  <br/>
away stuff that we all throw into a clothes basket each day when we find <br/>
something on the floor) and sorting out recycling.  The 4 and 2yo basically <br/>
help Mom out with whatever she&#39;s doing, plus pick up their toys.  The 4 yo is <br/>
starting to make his own bed, which all of the kids do also.   These younger <br/>
kids will probably start in the rotation when they are a little older.  Each <br/>
child is ready at a different age.  I also expect that by the time the 4yo is <br/>
ready to do laundry, the now 12 yo will be doing more outside of the house <br/>
and not be as available. BTW, the kids have gotten so good at their chores <br/>
that they usually only spend between 20-40 minutes per day doing them. (not <br/>
including dishes!) <br/>
Then on Saturdays, we have a chore jar and each child picks two or three <br/>
slips out of the jar and those are his/her chores.  This is when the extra <br/>
chores (like scrubbing the bathroom floor) get done.<br/>
We don&#39;t pay or give rewards for chores, but we do have two areas that we pay <br/>
the kids for after they have demonstrated ability and responsibilty:  lawn <br/>
mowing and babysitting.<br/>
I (Mom) still do the majority of the heavier cleaning, most of the cooking <br/>
(although my 12 yog and 10yob do a fair amount on their weeks in the <br/>
kitchen), errand running, bill paying, ironing, gardening.<br/>
Because we have only 2 bedrooms for six kids, the kids are also expected to <br/>
keep their bedrooms clean.  Mostly, because their things end up getting <br/>
trashed if the rooms are not picked up.  I don&#39;t nag at them about this and <br/>
each of them have a private space that is not allowed to be handled by any <br/>
outsiders (especially parents) in which to keep their treasures.<br/>
This has worked well for us and we are going into our third year with this <br/>
schedule.  <br/>
We devised this system as a family, after trying many options.  I would like <br/>
to say we never nag or remind or that the kids always do these things <br/>
happily, but that would be a lie.  For the most part, however, they are very <br/>
cooperative about it.  Whenever they complain, we have a family meeting to <br/>
discuss how to change things, but so far nothing better has really come up, <br/>
although we have refined the system.<br/>
I&#39;m sure that to some of you, this system will seem too controlling, but we <br/>
all felt the need for some structure around here before this.  To qualify, I <br/>
will say that we are very flexible within these guidelines.  If a child (or <br/>
an adult) is not feeling well, has another commitment, etc., others either <br/>
pitch in and do their chores or they don&#39;t get done that day (except the <br/>
essentials like feeding the pets and us!)<br/>
 Sometimes the kids trade without involving me.  Or sometimes they&#39;ll come to <br/>
me and bargain...For instance...&quot;Mom, since I have soccer practice every <br/>
night this week, could my job be to do the supper dishes after I get home <br/>
instead of vacuuming?&quot;   <br/>
  All the kids have worked out their own systems to complete their chores and <br/>
they all do them quite differently.  I don&#39;t mess with that. They are also <br/>
allowed a lot of freedom about when the chores get done, but they&#39;ve all kind <br/>
of come to their own realization that it&#39;s easiest to do things when they <br/>
first get up, so they don&#39;t have to worry about it later.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of <br/>
learning come out of this system.<br/>
We tried for years on a just kind of &quot;help as needed&quot; basis, but I think the <br/>
kids actually resented that more, because it seemed like the kids who were <br/>
more &quot;willing&quot; were always the ones &quot;chosen&quot; to help.<br/>
Again, this is just our family&#39;s way of doing things, but I thought I&#39;d share <br/>
because you asked!<br/>
And yes, I still consider myself an unschooler!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936245414">I am such an unstructured person, I didn&#39;t think any kind of structured chore<br/>
duties would work for me or my kids.  But, we have been doing it a bit.   My kids<br/>
are still very little (6,4,3)  But, each day on the calendar I have put a child<br/>
or combo of kids for emptying the dishwasher so whatever day it needs emptying,<br/>
the child on the calendar does it.  I hear no complaints.  Then other days are<br/>
scheduled too....  Mon, clean house..Tues, laundry ect....  This helps keep me<br/>
from getting too far under, and the kids know what they have to do each day.<br/>
Laundry days they have to bring all their dirty clothes to the laundry room,<br/>
clean up day we all go room to room picking up and putting away ect...<br/>
It works for even this VERY unstructured family.<br/>

there has got to be better way for us than to feel like nags or to do it all <br/>
ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
i think it must be in what we already know: just keeping to the forefront our <br/>
patient selves, encouraging when we see improvement, agreeing with children <br/>
on consequences if it doesnt happen, and being consistent while keeping an <br/>
upbeat attitude... :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-846464471">hi carol from wi!<br/>
<br/>
thanks too for all the details!    even tho i know each family is unique and <br/>
has to find their own way, i loooove to hear specifics sometimes or i dont <br/>
get a good picture of how others do it!<br/>
<br/>
it is encouraging to hear others that have struggled thru it, and that <br/>
reminders are just a part of being the parent...  <br/>
<br/>
the family meeting thing has worked well for us, too.  we used to have them <br/>
regularly (monthly), but at this point are having them on an as needed basis. <br/>
 (like when mom is ready to promote/launch a new household program she has <br/>
brewed up...)<br/>
<br/>
with our kind of lifestyle the kids realize it is all just part of life, and <br/>
making life go along well for the group, and supporting each other... that is <br/>
a good lesson in itself!<br/>

As for managing e-mail (I think it was you who asked), I tend to read it in <br/>
big chunks of time once a day (usually for me that&#39;s late at night).  I tend <br/>
to skim really quickly through most of the posts and then read more closely <br/>
posts that pertain to my specific areas of interest.  That&#39;s why clear <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070481873"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Do you all have a list of chores that you expect your children to <br/>
&gt; do?  For instance, do you expect them to clean their room and do<br/>
&gt; their share of the work around the house ... even if it is just<br/>
&gt; taking the garbage down to the road or picking up their own gear and<br/>
&gt; not leave it for mom?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine are young yet, but already help a great deal, on their own. I sometimes<br/>
request that they clean up a particular mess they&#39;ve made, and I sometimes<br/>
just clean it (since I&#39;m the one the mess is bothering, this seems fair to<br/>
me &lt;g&gt;). My husband cleans without being asked (a benefit of both working at<br/>
home) and either of us will help the other if requested.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you have consequences when they don&#39;t do their share of the<br/>
&gt; chores?  Do they have tv or stereo taken away?  Are these<br/>
&gt; consequences consistently enforced?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am completely unimpressed with such punishments, I think they are, if you<br/>
will pardon the phrase, a bunch of hooey. :) If my husband or I don&#39;t do our<br/>
share, should we punish each other, or just have a sensible discussion on<br/>
the division of household labor? And if the second is obviously true, why on<br/>
earth wouldn&#39;t we do the same with our kids?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they are, then how does that go back to not enforcing consequences<br/>
&gt; if the child doesn&#39;t do anything &quot;constructive&quot; towards his or her<br/>
&gt; education during the week.  And I&#39;m sure constructive isn&#39;t exactly<br/>
&gt; the right word to use either ... that definition and labels issue<br/>
&gt; again ... but how do you deal with the issue of being permissive in<br/>
&gt; their education and not being or being too permissive in their<br/>
&gt; participation in the family&#39;s life?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no requirement, written or unwritten, stated or unstated, thought or<br/>
unthought, that my children do anything &lt;mufasa shudder&gt; &quot;constructive&quot;<br/>
towards their education in a week, month, year, or lifetime. The idea of it<br/>
is completely the reverse of how I think about their learning, and is not<br/>
applicable to unschooling, IMHO. You can&#39;t say, &quot;You have complete freedom&quot;<br/>
and then say, &quot;Except that you must produce, or else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mine (6 and 3) help around the house on their own (some), get asked (some)<br/>
and get picked up after (some). I do not get all caught up in scorekeeping<br/>
-- if I feel overburdened, I speak up, and three other people (45, 6, and 3)<br/>
help me. Same goes if one of them needs my help. We&#39;re a family, not a<br/>
competitive sport. :)<br/>

sometimes one of us does more than anyone else on a given day, but <br/>
sometimes that same person might sit on their arse and not do <br/>
anything - and it&#39;s okay for the most part because everyone knows <br/>
that it all comes out in the wash eventually. It&#39;s just being a <br/>
family and sharing responsibilities with each other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388346723">I think our house must run similar to Sandra&#39;s.  Everyone is expected to<br/>
pick up after themselves.  For general cleaning, the kids divvy up chores<br/>
among themselves for the upstairs (it is all kid territory up there).  They<br/>
decide who is going to do what and when.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest 2 do their own laundry.  I got tired of re-washing clean clothes<br/>
because the kids hadn&#39;t put them away and simply mixed them back in with the<br/>
dirty.  We tried several approaches but the kids were never able to keep the<br/>
clean from the dirty.  Sooo...I simply said &quot;You do it the way you want&quot;<br/>
and handed over all control.  I do remind them about upcoming baseball<br/>
games, parties, etc., so they will have time to wash clothes.<br/>

Here&#39;s the situation in our house:  Dd feeds the cat every day.  She <br/>
got her brother to agree to change the cat&#39;s water every day, but he <br/>
quit after a few days.  Now every day I listen to arguing about who&#39;s <br/>
going to change the water.  <br/>
<br/>
We got them each a hermit crab.  They share a cage.  They were <br/>
supposed to take turns taking care of the hermit crabs, but ds quit.  <br/>
Dd told him that if he quits, then she gets to claim both hermit <br/>
crabs as her own.  He said he didn&#39;t care.  <br/>
<br/>
We also have a fish tank.  Ds begged for a gold fish that ended up <br/>
getting quite big.  The other fish were picked out by dd (because she <br/>
was the only one who wanted any other than ds&#39;s goldfish).  Again, <br/>
they were supposed to take turns taking care of the fish because ds <br/>
had a goldfish in there.  He quit.  She said if she&#39;s going to take <br/>
care of the fish then she wants to get rid of the goldfish.  Ds <br/>
doesn&#39;t care but now we can&#39;t find anyone who wants the goldfish...<br/>

&lt;&lt; But what if no one chooses to feed the animals?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When the cats come putting their tails in people&#39;s faces I might ask the kid <br/>
who&#39;s been the nearest to the cat food station for the longest whether <br/>
they&#39;ve been fed.  Maybe the cats just want petting.<br/>
<br/>
Either a kid will volunteer to do it or say &quot;No, I didn&#39;t feed them.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And maybe I&#39;ll do it, unless I&#39;m folding laundry or making dinner or <br/>
something that outranks cat feeding in that moment.  And if I ask a kid to do <br/>
it, he&#39;ll do it.  And often it&#39;s just done and I don&#39;t know who did, and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
The dog eats in the kitchen so she gets scraps from cooks, and leftover bowls <br/>
and plates are set down at her place.  Sometimes she has a pan and three <br/>
dishes in addition to her own, and someone (usually but not always me) picks <br/>
those up and puts them in the dishwasher.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sheila, I don&#39;t know what to say about your ds not wanting to take <br/>
responsibility for the animals. :o( That would be frustrating for me too. It <br/>
sounds like your dd is ready, and willing to take care of the animals in her <br/>
care, and although it might not seem &quot;fair&quot; for her to take all the <br/>
responsibility, if she is already doing it... <br/>
I do know something about goldfish and tropical tanks. How big is the tank? A <br/>
good rule of thumb is one inch of fish per gallon. If the goldfish is too big <br/>
it might be better to take him out. (I would) The reason is this, 1) goldfish <br/>
are DIRTY and make the Ammonia and Nitrite levels in the tank soar! (You <br/>
don&#39;t want this) and 2) goldfish (the fancy ones, not the feeder ones) have <br/>
been bread to grow large, and live in water where temperatures and pH levels <br/>
differ. (This is where you get into trouble with the other tropical fish, <br/>
because normal community fish don&#39;t do well in extreme temps [76 to 82 <br/>
degrees is best] or extreme pH levels [anything below 7.0 or above 7.8 and <br/>
that can be high for some]) These fancy goldfish or Koi are what people put <br/>
in their garden ponds. If your daughter wants to get rid of the goldfish (I <br/>
agree with her) I would call a pet store and ask if they would take him (some <br/>
will. I know the chain store Petsmart has done so.) or if you know someone <br/>
who has fancy goldfish or Koi in a pond, you could give him to them. Good <br/>
luck!<br/>

I  have considered trying to have the calm conversation, but it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to work.  He gets defensive right away.  But I did talk to him on the way<br/>
home from the doctor today about the concept of  asking kids to do chores<br/>
instead of &quot;making&quot; them.  He seemed to think the idea was good, and so as<br/>
we try this we may be able to get to a dialogue point about him.  We talked<br/>
about the fact that  changing our perspective on this will probably change<br/>
us a lot more than the kids.  He agreed.  So at least he sees that there<br/>
could be change!  (But he did mention something about the fact that not<br/>
requiring the children to do chores will make more work for me!)  Time will<br/>
tell.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you suggestion.<br/>

 But I&#39;m learning to appreciate the times when they help instead of <br/>
 dwelling on the times when they don&#39;t.  I&#39;m also trying to remember <br/>
 that when the house gets messy it&#39;s because I have three young <br/>
 children who are in it all day long doing all kinds of cool stuff.  <br/>
 If I sent them away to school all day long I would have no problem <br/>
 keeping up with it.  When I think of it like that, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s <br/>
 messy.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, exactly.<br/>
That was a sweet story about your kids making breakfast, thanks for sharing!<br/>
<br/>
My kids like to help, it&#39;s just rarely in the ways I would want it if I had a <br/>
choice.<br/>
Jared saw my paint cans on the table a couple nights ago and started peeling <br/>
the dried paint of the edges. <br/>
He was helping in his mind. His Dad only saw more mess. I moved Jared out to <br/>
the kitchen and asked him to keep &quot;cleaning up the paint can&quot; and he felt so <br/>
good that he was helping.<br/>
He peeled it for about 10 more minutes and proudly announced that the paint <br/>
can was all cleaned up. :)<br/>
Whatever he got out of that was important. And it WAS a contribution. It was <br/>
HIS contribution, not necessarily what I would have done.<br/>
If we just appreciate what they do instead of focusing on what they don&#39;t do, <br/>
it leads to greater willingness when something is asked of them.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848983607">Another fun chore &quot;brainstorm&quot; of yesterday -<br/>
In the laundry department, I do most of the laundry - after the dirty ones<br/>
are deposited in the laundry room (conveniently located on the way to the<br/>
outdoor shower!) Washing them falls somehow on my willing shoulders.<br/>
Hanging them out and retrieving them before the next tradewind shower is<br/>
shared mostly. Folding them somehow becomes my job again, with someone<br/>
perhaps present for conversation and a bit of help. The clothes, clean and<br/>
folded, then go into individual rooms in baskets for putting away. There<br/>
they often stay - for weeks sometimes, until the once folded clothes have<br/>
spread themselves in a puddle around the basket, as everyone digs for their<br/>
favorites! Yesterday, I put them back into the basket with a little note on<br/>
each kids pile &quot;I&#39;m lost . . . will you help me find my way to my home,<br/>
please?&quot; Throughout the day, as each kid was in their room for something, I<br/>
heard a couple of giggles and, sure enough, got 3 wicker baskets returned<br/>
to the laundry room by the end of the day, empty - clothes into drawers and<br/>
a couple of kisses! Just a bit of inspiration to share! Wish I had an idea<br/>
on the breakfast dishes that are downstairs now, as each of them has eaten<br/>
and headed off to their latest project?!? Maybe I&#39;ll just go and do them<br/>
myself and be grateful.<br/>
