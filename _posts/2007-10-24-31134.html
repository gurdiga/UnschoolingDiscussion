<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456260662">First of all you are definitely on the right track.  Your  DD sounds like a <br/>
happy, healthy little girl who is loved and encouraged enough  at home that she <br/>
feels free to follow her passions.  My advice is to talk  with your daughter <br/>
about this.  8 years old is not too young to understand  that some people feel <br/>
that there is only one way to do things (usually the way  that they are doing <br/>
them) and that while they are trying to be helpful, their  actions and <br/>
comments can sometimes cause hurt feelings and frustration.   Let her know that <br/>
while some aspects of the class may be really fun and  interesting, there may be <br/>
aspects that are difficult for her.  Let her know  that the teacher may (and <br/>
probably will) expect things from her that she just  isn&#39;t able to do right now. <br/>
 I&#39;d tell her that she can continue in the  class and enjoy the fun stuff and <br/>
try not to get frustrated by the other stuff,  or the two of you can find <br/>
ways of incorporating some of the fun service  projects into your family life.  <br/>
If she decides to continue, I would  absolutely pull your &quot;friend&quot; aside and <br/>
tell her about your talk with your DD  and that, despite not enjoying the <br/>
textbook activities and such, DD has made the  decision to stick with the class in <br/>
order to participate in the service  projects, etc.  Let her know you are <br/>
supporting DD&#39;s decision and that you  expect your friend to be considerate and <br/>
respectful of your DD.  Tell her  that if she has a problem, she should discuss <br/>
it with you.  Under no  circumstances should she try to shame or embarrass your <br/>
daughter.  If your  friend has a problem with your daughter not being &quot;on <br/>
level&quot; with the other  children, then maybe the class isn&#39;t a good fit.  She has <br/>
set the class up  in a certain way and may not be willing to compromise for <br/>
one child.   Hopefully, she will be able to overlook the imagined &quot;holes&quot; in <br/>
your DD&#39;s  education and keep her opinions to herself so that your DD can enjoy  <br/>
herself.  Just my humble (yet rather long. LOL) opinion.  Good  luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Wendy for your reply.  I think you are right and I will talk <br/>
with my DD about it some more.  DD told me that if the teacher insists <br/>
on worksheets again she doesn&#39;t want to be in the class.  I told her <br/>
that was fine.  I believe the teacher doesn&#39;t want to accomodate my DD <br/>
but wants to &quot;out&quot; her as the non-reader she now is.  I will talk with <br/>
her about it and tell her my DD has my total support.  I told my <br/>
husband that I am concerned the teacher may call CPS on us!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you to you and the group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797002956">Neither of my girls were reading at 8 - both, much later.  There are things<br/>
that I have done to protect them from the damage other people may have had<br/>
on their self esteem.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1.	I remain present in any circumstances that might require reading,<br/>
writing, forms to be filled out, etc.  If a parent is not welcome in<br/>
attendance than we have no desire to participate in the program.  I define<br/>
our *homeschooling* as *family learning.*  We all learn together.  I<br/>
sometimes find myself explaining to &quot;educators&quot; how this stimulates intense<br/>
conversations making cross connections from one activity/subject/experience<br/>
to another.  The importance of these cross connections is a concept never<br/>
denied by an *educator.*<br/>
2.	I&#39;ve been known to tell facilitators of programs that my daughter<br/>
does not read *aloud* - so please do not ask her to read *aloud*.  She won&#39;t<br/>
be able to read aloud in front of a group and it will only make *everyone*<br/>
uncomfortable in a situation and that doesn&#39;t need to happen.<br/>
3.	I&#39;ve reminded my kids that they are always learning to read.  So if<br/>
someone asks or questions them on this ability they can confidently and<br/>
truthfully respond by saying *I am learning to read.*<br/>
4.	The kids and I have had many, many conversations over the years on<br/>
how everyone learns different things at different times in different ways.<br/>
And that one of the beauties of home/unschooling, unlike school, is that<br/>
they don&#39;t need to learn anything on anyone else&#39;s time frame but their own.<br/>
This conversation is sometimes had in front of their peers or a mixed group<br/>
of folks.  This conversation is so ingrained in my kids and anyone who knows<br/>
us that folks who we spend time with are accepting of this.  Or we don&#39;t<br/>
spend much time with them &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
5.	And when it comes to my mother - well - I don&#39;t leave my kids alone<br/>
with people (especially family members) who test them.  The last time she<br/>
asked what I am doing about my dd&#39;s reading, I told her she is being<br/>
tutored.  Just didn&#39;t tell her what that *tutoring* looked like&lt;g&gt;.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought of myself as my daughters&#39; reader, just as a deaf person might<br/>
have an interpreter, my daughter has had a reader!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765921737">I am blown away by this group.   Even though my daughter is only two, it&#39;s amazing how <br/>
the&quot;competition of others&quot; starts so young, as well as  the way  parents (including myself) <br/>
&quot;discipline.&quot; I really like these suggestions about being our children&#39;s advocates.  <br/>
I also appreciated the willful child thread because as LilaRose is becomming more herself, I <br/>
have to watch myself from threatening, if you don&#39;t... then we won&#39;t....  I notice I do this <br/>
more if I am feeling in ahurry, hungry etc.    I am so grateful for the wisdom and honesty <br/>
in this group.<br/>
In regards to our children having a meaing behind hitting, yelling, perhaps offending or <br/>
hurting another child, I am still having difficulty understanding the balance of letting the <br/>
children ( in my case 2-4 years ols usually) work it out themselves, acknowledge the child <br/>
with the so called behavior while supporting the child who was perhaps hurt, physically or <br/>
emotionally.  I understand that each circumstance is different but if anyone has any <br/>
grneral or specific suggestions, it would be appreciated.<br/>
Also how have some of you handled your child being pushed hard by an older child and <br/>
the mother was no where to be seen?  My husband was there asked the girl why she <br/>
pushed our daughter and she shrugged her shoulders and he asked our daughter to tell <br/>
the girls not to hit her.  We moved on and said nothing to the mother, but should I have <br/>
said something to the mother?  Bearing this in mind, when we are around this child she <br/>
takes thinks from my daughter and tells her what she can and cannot do.  LilaRose holds <br/>
her own for the most part but it broke my heart to watch her get pushed  pretty hard by <br/>
this bigger child.  We don&#39;t chose to socialize with this family but they are a part of play <br/>
group where we really like the other families.   Thanks for listening.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi-<br/>
I have been reading here for many months, but I don&#39;t usually<br/>
post...here goes.<br/>
The above statement reminded me of attending a birthday party with my<br/>
then 9 year old daughter at a neighbor/friends house. There were six<br/>
other &quot;schooled&quot; girls and the mom of the birthday girls was a<br/>
teacher. The theme of the party was a murder mystery/Nancy Drew type<br/>
of deal. Each guest received a little book for their character to read<br/>
aloud to the group to look for clues and solve the mystery.<br/>
I knew my daughter would not be able to read aloud so I asked her if<br/>
she would like me to come along to the party and read for her - she<br/>
said yes! It helped her feel comfortable about the reading, as well as<br/>
feeling a little less shy having never met most of the guests. At the<br/>
party, I snuggled in next to her, sat back, and when it was her turn<br/>
to read &quot;clues&quot; I just read for her - no big deal.  She didn&#39;t mind<br/>
and the other guests (and the teacher/mom) adjusted quickly to me<br/>
being there and didn&#39;t make my daughter feel less comfortable for<br/>
bringing me along.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  4. The kids and I have had many, many conversations over the years on<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter is 11 and has little/no interest in learning to read. She<br/>
loves books on tape, browsing through books of all kinds, and belongs<br/>
to a book club at our library. She plays computer Scrabble (using<br/>
hints) and someone reads for her if we play board games that require<br/>
reading. She is very comfortable in stating that she will read when<br/>
she is ready and at her own pace - she loves to state that she is<br/>
&quot;autodidactict&quot;.  I love that she knows she can ask for help reading<br/>
when she needs it (to play MY SIMS on the WII for example) and never<br/>
has to worry about being shamed.  I believe she has all the skills she<br/>
needs to be her perfect 11 year old self - right now in this moment.<br/>
Reading books to herself is only one way for her to access the world.<br/>
<br/>
So far, grandparentsor others, have not made any negative comments. I<br/>
think because it is not obvious to an outsider when they talk to her.<br/>
 She has been read to or listened to sooo many great books and is<br/>
interersted in so many cool topics that they see all that she IS, and<br/>
not what she may be &quot;behind&quot; in.<br/>
<br/>
I have definately had my moments of panic and anxiety about the issue<br/>
- but then I remember to trust that she is blossoming at her own pace<br/>
and it is my job to continue to provide the fertile ground for her to<br/>
do so.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think &quot;work it out yourself&quot; is a good thing for kids.  I  <br/>
think it&#39;s a justification schools use for not supervising better and  <br/>
that babysitting grandmothers have used to defend themselves against  <br/>
having to actually play with kids or even watch them.<br/>
<br/>
If an adult you didn&#39;t know treated your child badly would you let  <br/>
them work it out?<br/>
And how much worse to try to &quot;work it out&quot; when both kids are too  <br/>
young to have working-it-out tools and experience!<br/>
<br/>
-=-if anyone has any<br/>
grneral or specific suggestions, it would be appreciated.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is about siblings, but can work with friends too, sometimes.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t ask why she pushed.  I&#39;d say &quot;Don&#39;t push.&quot;  You don&#39;t have  <br/>
to say it in a threatening way.  Just in a definite, for sure, polite  <br/>
way.   If I knew the mother I might say something to her.  If I knew  <br/>
the mother I&#39;d probably know the child too, though.<br/>
<br/>
I usually made a suggestion about how the kids could play together,  <br/>
or lure them toward something different.  If they were fighting over  <br/>
one swing or a shovel or whatever, say something to make the slides  <br/>
look sparkly, or offer them something to drink, or something to just  <br/>
break that moment&#39;s tension.<br/>
<br/>
The same way a kid doesn&#39;t need to learn to read in a hurry, they  <br/>
don&#39;t need to learn to get along in a hurry.  You can protect them as  <br/>
they learn it gradually.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My youngest daughter has a hard time getting along with other kids.  <br/>
It&#39;s not something I worry about much.  I&#39;ve seen her get along <br/>
tremendously with some kids and not others, then go for months not <br/>
having any social contact with other kids her own age, and suddenly <br/>
gets along better.  <br/>
<br/>
It takes time.  Some kids are more empathic of others, some aren&#39;t, <br/>
even older kids.  My youngest is 6, and is just now starting to feel <br/>
empathic of others.  It wouldn&#39;t have occured to her to feel badly <br/>
about something that she did to another person, even if you told her <br/>
or explained why it was wrong.  It was better to say &quot;play nicely&quot;, <br/>
or &quot;don&#39;t do.....&quot;, anything else was going to go in one ear and out <br/>
the other.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, we&#39;ve tried to play with other kids that are a <br/>
little more &quot;thick skinned&quot;.  I don&#39;t like to play referee.  I do try <br/>
to stay in the moment, though, so that I&#39;m not just putting out <br/>
fires, I&#39;m keeping the fires from starting in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
My older daughter never had these kind of issues.  She was kind of <br/>
opposite, the one who never got her turn because she patiently <br/>
waited.  She was quiet and shy and VERY empathic of others, her sense <br/>
of fairness eventually made her the most popular kid to play with in <br/>
the neighborhood.  That and the fact that she had all the good <br/>
ideas!  I saw other kids going to Chamille to settle disagreements <br/>
because they knew she was fair.  That was such an amazing and <br/>
powerful thing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so much about personality.  Unschooling works so wonderfully <br/>
because each person is able to use their strengths to their greatest <br/>
advantage and not worry so much on the things they aren&#39;t as good at, <br/>
knowing that it will happen in its own way and time.</div>

about their child being the problem.<br/>
Perhaps asking the  mom to remain present as there seems to be some <br/>
conflict between the two girls and maybe if she was there it would be <br/>
helpful in figuring out how to best help the girls get through it.  <br/>
Sometimes we need to look at our childs disposition that may be part <br/>
of creating the situatoin.  And perhaps its not the best situation <br/>
for our child to be put into.<br/>
