<div id="ygrps-yiv-797469912">I have 2 puppies, courtesy of Dar&#39;s dog (kiss and hug to Nana) that are 13<br/>
weeks old.  They are half border collie.  I am attempting to teach them<br/>
manners, etc., hoping a service dog organization will take them in a few<br/>
months.  Here is the dilemma.  The farthest I have ever gotten in dog<br/>
training is &quot;sit&quot;.  I have read lots of books but they all deal with a<br/>
single dog.<br/>
<br/>
I have crate trained the pups in their own crates.  They have time to spend<br/>
playing just with each other and times they are in our half-acre pen with<br/>
our adult dogs.  I have been trying to use a &quot;lead&quot; system, where the dog is<br/>
attached to me on a 4-foot lead in the house or attached to a short lead in<br/>
their &quot;settle down&quot; area.  We have lots of toys, bones, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I have been working with them one at a time.  Does this sound on track at<br/>
all or could someone recommend a good book?  Just wanting to do what I can<br/>
to try to help these pups find a more suitable home than our very pet-heavy<br/>
one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205585581">I have raised puppies for Leader Dogs of America for several years.  If your <br/>
plan is to donate them to a service group I would suggest calling a group in <br/>
your state sooner then later. The most important lesson puppies for service <br/>
need to learn is socialization.  they need to be exposed to as many different <br/>
situations and people as possible.  Actually as a raiser they tell me this is <br/>
even more important then basic training since they will recieve intense <br/>
training when they are returned to the school.  As for training at home we <br/>
spend several short sessions per day devoted to training, such as sit.  In <br/>
training this from a young age we begin by saying sit (once only) then <br/>
assisting the dog by placeing your hand on the rump and pressing gently down. <br/>
 Once the dog sits give lots of praise and remember to always stop a session <br/>
when the dog has done something right.  After several days of repetion the <br/>
dog usually starts to sit as soon as you say the word.  After sit is mastered <br/>
move on to the next command such as down.  Oh and try to remember down is for <br/>
laying down and off is the command for not jumping on things.  To teach down <br/>
we first have the dog do a sit then give the command down as you are saying <br/>
the word pull on the leash in a downward motion while sliding the dogs legs <br/>
forward.  Soon you will not have to do either. <br/>
<br/>
Another godd thing is to begin walkind with a leash as soon as the dog is <br/>
confortable with it always insisting on the dog staying in a heel position <br/>
slightly in front of your toe.  And do not allow playing or rushing on leash. <br/>
 We use two seperate leashes one a long 16&#39; leash for play and a short 6&#39; for <br/>
obiedence work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this helps with some of your questions, if you would like i could <br/>
go on with other techniques we have learned over the years.<br/>
