<br/>
When I read this and other posts I&#39;m aware of how strongly I&#39;ve <br/>
held my Christian viewpoint about sex being for marriage. When <br/>
I look back at dating and sex, I remember liking very much the <br/>
fun part of kissing and being physically involved with the boys I <br/>
dated. In fact, I have great memories of those experiences and <br/>
don&#39;t regret them at all. I didn&#39;t have sexual intercourse until I<br/>
was married and feel good about that decision for the most part <br/>
(ie. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t have multiple partners or VD or pregnancy). <br/>
On the other hand, what I don&#39;t like about the way my husband <br/>
and I &quot;did it&quot; is that there was heavy indoctrination about the evils <br/>
of sex outside of marriage and the need for extremely tight <br/>
boundaries (which we repeatedly crossed) leading up to the <br/>
wedding day and that brought with it all kinds of guilt and a <br/>
sense of failure that wasn&#39;t good for me or our new marriage. I <br/>
wish I had felt it fine to explore each other while not going &quot;all<br/>
the way&quot; before marriage.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I asked this question about sex and dating (and <br/>
have so appreciated the variety of responses) is that I guess I <br/>
still prefer the &quot;no sex until marriage&quot; view but am unsure what it <br/>
means to &quot;impart&quot; that view to my kids without all the baggage of <br/>
their being judged harshly by God or that they will naturally <br/>
become pregnant or filled with VD. I&#39;m realizing that what Shyrley <br/>
said here is largely truethe risks are smaller than my <br/>
faith community has admitted and mostly they&#39;ve used the Bible <br/>
and conditioning to maintain the status quo (no sex before <br/>
marriage). And while I can stand back from Shyrley and think, <br/>
&quot;Fine for you&quot; (I feel no judgment at all) I still feel queasy thinking <br/>
of my kids having sex before marriage.<br/>
<br/>
Is it wrong to want our kids to hold our values, share our core <br/>
beleifs about things like sex? Oh I know you&#39;ll say it isn&#39;t wrong. <br/>
But how do we go about it? One of you (sorry I forgot who now) <br/>
said that she wants her daughter to be a virgin until marriage <br/>
and hopes that she will marry a man who is committed to God <br/>
like she is. That&#39;s how I&#39;ve seen it too. Now I am just trying to <br/>
picture how our kids live with freedom in so many areas and <br/>
then feel this parental clamp down on things like drinking, sex, <br/>
drug experimentation. Or do you?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has two really wonderful books: Girlosophy and <br/>
Girlosophy 2. I like them because the writer points out all the <br/>
implications of choosing various relationships with boys/men <br/>
(she does it without some big guilt trip or admonition about <br/>
which to choose). She describes what the benefits are and price <br/>
to be paid in each scenario. And she affirms the girl in her <br/>
thoughtful choices and even in her mistakes. It was such a <br/>
contrast to all the girl Bible study guides I looked at that are all <br/>
about repeatedly telling girls that they had better be careful or <br/>
they&#39;ll end up in bed and judged by God.<br/>
<br/>
I like the Girlosophy approach a lot. But I still find that I want to<br/>
be bold enough to say what I believe (even if they don&#39;t agree <br/>
with it) as a marker for how they form their beliefs. What do you <br/>
think? Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
What is scary about this form of parenting is that it feels as <br/>
though all the markers for how to teach my kids are gone. Yet I <br/>
think of them as being inexperienced to make the informed <br/>
decisions that I would hope they make. I want to state strongly <br/>
when I think something is dangerous or bad for them. And I hope <br/>
to create a context that will bear that out (not letting them go to a <br/>
party where I think drugs will be, saving car dating for later teen <br/>
years rather than early teen years). Is that unreasonable?<br/>

I&#39;m not clamping down about anything with my kids.  Our dialog is still <br/>
really clear and open and I would not want to risk their trust by any threats <br/>

I don&#39;t think a family can be practicing a strict form of Christianity and <br/>
still give their kids real trust and freedom.  <br/>
<br/>
If I believed that a mistake on my part or my child&#39;s could land them in an <br/>
eternal fiery pit, I would be living my life differently.  For those who do <br/>
fear fiery pits, that becomes an abiding priority, doesn&#39;t it?  And how a <br/>
child&#39;s self esteem is falls way down on the charts?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;without all the baggage of <br/>
<br/>

That appeared lower in your post than the first mention:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I didn&#39;t have sexual intercourse until I<br/>
<br/>
was married and feel good about that decision for the most part <br/>
<br/>
(ie. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t have multiple partners or VD or pregnancy). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had sex with three men, all of whom I trusted and knew well, before I was <br/>
married, and didn&#39;t have VD or pregnancy.   But I saw that later in your post <br/>
you filed that under a natural consequence threatened by the church (or a <br/>
Godly punishment, maybe).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure both discussions can mesh.<br/>

I told my boys if they get a girl pregnant they are fathers for life.  Maybe <br/>
they won&#39;t have the opportunity to be decent fathers.  Maybe they&#39;ll live <br/>
with a life of guilt for not being with or around that child.  So they need <br/>
to avoid that permanent change.<br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to let you know, that though I am new to unschooling, I am<br/>
with you on the these issues.  I am also one who would like my children to<br/>
save sex for marriage and we have talked about that and told them why.<br/>
Since I am new to unschooling, I was waiting to let others answer this, but<br/>
I also know that my value is not going to change because we are unschoolers.<br/>
Our children already know that we have these values, and why, and they know<br/>
it because we have talked about things, talked about the bible and why we<br/>
believe it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Neither my husband or I were raised in a Christian home, so our values were<br/>
not put upon us, we came to Christ of our own accord, and in some ways,<br/>
probably hold our views more strongly because of that.  We, of course, hope<br/>
that our children will take on our values, but if they do not, they will<br/>
still always be our children and we will love them for who they are.   Of<br/>
course, the children see the values played out on a daily basis and we talk<br/>
a lot about why we do what we do, etc.  Just my two cents!<br/>

issued by the Govt to say we&#39;re &#39;married&#39;.<br/>
My husband and I didn&#39;t get married for ages. After we had our first child we found out that there were extra tax benefits to being married, so we popped down the local registrars office and did the<br/>
deed. It meant nothing to either of us.<br/>
As it happens its fortunate we did as 9 years later we decided to move here and the INS would not have let me in or his kids unless we&#39;d been legally married. DH couldn&#39;t have bought in his family<br/>
without that piece of paper. The INS would also have been suspicious if we&#39;d married just before the immigration application. As it was they grilled me for 40 mins about whetehr my marriage was *real*<br/>
and whether I had married him just to get into America 10 years later! This is with our 3 kids standing next to me! Like I&#39;d have been *that* desperate to get into the US that I&#39;d be with a man fior 10<br/>
years and have 3 kids.<br/>
Back home in the UK the tax incentive has now gone so when we get home we might get divorced (costs £30) just to annoy the more strait-laced relatives ;-)<br/>

our role as helping them make the right (by our standards) decisions to<br/>
helping them make decisions.<br/>
<br/>
If we live what we believe to be right and true and pass on why it feels<br/>
right and true *for us*, then it&#39;s very likely they will find it&#39;s right and<br/>
true for them too. Or at least they&#39;ll have very positive feelings about it.<br/>
If we *make* them do what we believe is right and true, if we fill them full<br/>
of fears of what will happen if they don&#39;t do what we believe is right and<br/>
true, then what happens when they&#39;re away from us? Will the fear be enough<br/>
to hold them? Will the need to be free from control be so strong that they<br/>
will do what feels wrong just to be free?<br/>

worthwhile to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
I think it can be discussed if we stick to why we believe those thoughts are<br/>
not incompatible and not whether those whys are right or wrong. But if we<br/>
start treading into the &quot;How can you possibly believe that&quot; territory, then<br/>
we&#39;ve gotten onto a topic that will go nowhere and fill up people&#39;s mail<br/>
boxes for no unschooling benefit.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I&#39;d extend the respect to what kind of life I felt I could provide<br/>
for a child. Probably there&#39;s rarely a perfect time to have a child, but<br/>
there are circumstances that would clearly be soulfully damaging to a child.<br/>
Where someone draws that line, is going to be different for every person.<br/>
<br/>
And fodder for flaming debate so we don&#39;t need to discuss the rightness of<br/>
where to draw the line or even whether it&#39;s right to draw it at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677879287">Joyce thanks for a very helpful post. VERY helpful.<br/>
<br/>
So far, this is exactly how I have dealt with our views, but at times <br/>
wonder if I am being too &quot;post modern&quot; in my &quot;This is my view <br/>
and I found it right for me; you&#39;ll have to come to your own view&quot; <br/>
way of expressing myself. Sometimes I wonder if kids just want <br/>
to know that there is a right way or a wrong way... all this <br/>
nuancing of everything can feel so muddled... and yet that is <br/>
precisely where I find myself right now. No getting away from it or <br/>
around it. And that modeling of the struggle may be helpful to <br/>
them some day.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest benefit of going through a spiritual crisis that I can <br/>
see is that I have far more empathy for multiple positions, <br/>
beliefs, ideas and how they can be arrived at with integrity even <br/>
when I don&#39;t share the conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for hosting a truly diverse group of women. I know <br/>
that certain topics can push buttons, but it&#39;s the variety of replies <br/>
that helps me the mostnot just one party line that is the only <br/>
acceptable answer.<br/>

Peace,<br/>

<br/>
I think the issue of abortion cuts deeply because it focuses on <br/>
two very significant parts of family. The child who is conceived is <br/>
received as a child/baby when the mother who is looking forward <br/>
to pregnancy sees the little + sign on her pregnancy test strip. <br/>
The woman who finds herself pregnant unexpectedly does not <br/>
feel she is a mother at that moment in quite the same way but <br/>
almost feels invaded by an alien being that is sent to ruin her life. <br/>
And I can imagine that would be terrifying and lonely. <br/>
<br/>
Starting from these two places creates very different emotions <br/>
about the role of abortion in our families or for women in general. <br/>
Abortion is legal (not as a right as in free speech but as in legal <br/>
like drinking alcohol is legal) because of those women who feel <br/>
keenly the need to protect women who bear children from feeling <br/>
victimized by the obligations of pregnancy and child rearing. <br/>
<br/>
But for women who start with the premise that children are <br/>
sacred from conception or that pregnancy begins the role of <br/>
nurturing that life, then abortion stands in relief against that view. <br/>
And as an unschooler, I can see how it is perfectly natural to <br/>
want to evaluate at what point we say we are mothers whose <br/>
role it is to protect and care for that little life (even if it means <br/>
giving it up for adoption or raising it as a single mother) rather <br/>
than ending it before it has emerged from the womb.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; And fodder for flaming debate so we don&#39;t need to discuss the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>rightness of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; where to draw the line or even whether it&#39;s right to draw it at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Makes sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
After reading so much about abortion on the other side of the <br/>
debate (which for me meant reading pro-choice material since I <br/>
had always been pro-life) in the last year, I am much more <br/>
sympathetic to the desire to protect women. I understand better <br/>
not wanting to criminalize abortion. I also understand better why <br/>
women feel unfairly singled out by their reproductive <br/>
capabilities to bear the burden of child-bearing and rearing.<br/>
<br/>
Even after that, though, I find that motherhood for me began the <br/>
first time that little strip turned red or showed the + sign. My <br/>
odyssey of parenting began in that moment. And it continues <br/>
with the same level of concern and agitation and joy that it began <br/>
with that day six weeks after conception.<br/>
<br/>
In our home, abortion would be an incompatible choice with <br/>
unschooling. As I raise a teenage daughter, I find that is how we <br/>
see it too. Motherhood is the direct result of sexual activity that<br/>
is unprotected (and then even sometimes when it is, as we have <br/>
daily proof with our number five who defied the condom). I would <br/>
hope that she would take that potential responsbility seriously <br/>
even before she is married and would not choose abortion if <br/>
faced with pregnancy.<br/>

I am glad I could help a little.  I know this is quite a transition all<br/>
around (unschooling) and my husband and I have been having some amazing<br/>
discussions about it and how it fits into our previous beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
I think even though we take on a set of beliefs, out of choice, we still<br/>
need to continually test those beliefs up to what is happening in our lives.<br/>
Though I too am still holding on to my beliefs in Jesus, I have changed a<br/>
lot since I first became a Christian and am still changing today!  .<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Thank you Erin for your post. I am in so many transitions right<br/>
&gt; now my head is spinning. My husband and I too also became<br/>
&gt; Christians of our own accord. Now I am going through a serious<br/>
&gt; reevaluation of much of the theology I&#39;ve been taught and have<br/>
&gt; believed. But for now, we still do hold to many of our values from<br/>
&gt; that Christian commitment and I think that is what is leaving me<br/>
&gt; feeling vulnerable and at times just worn out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for speaking up. It helps to hear multiple voices on<br/>
&gt; each issue. Like you, I want my children to choose their beleifs<br/>
&gt; for themselves.<br/>
