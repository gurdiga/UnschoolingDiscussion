&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of you in Portland who would like to demonstrate, please contact<br/>
&gt; me privately and we&#39;ll see what we can organize.  For others, be sure to<br/>
&gt; read the following message, and go to the Adbusters link.  It will lead you<br/>
&gt; to people in your own area who are planning demonstrations on &quot;Buy Nothing<br/>
&gt; Day.&quot;<br/>

Attached is an expanded version of an my column in the November/December Home<br/>
Education Magazine on this subject:<br/>

----<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
November is the month with the most important holiday in the American<br/>
calendar.  It is almost universally celebrated, by those of virtually all<br/>
religions, or no religion at all. Preparations for it take place for a period<br/>
of weeks or even months, and it is eagerly awaited by young and old alike. More<br/>
is published and broadcast as part of its annual commemoration than for any<br/>
other holiday of the year.<br/>
<br/>
There is neither a domesticated mentally challenged fowl nor a funny-hatted man<br/>
with silver buckles on his shoes associated with it.  It is not Thanksgiving.<br/>
In fact, it is a holiday without a popular name.  I write of course of the day<br/>
after Thanksgiving, a day which is the source of many of the hopes - to be<br/>
realized and dashed - of America&#39;s children in the coming month, and acts as<br/>
either a joyous sign or ominous harbinger for the health of the American<br/>
economy, and the fate of tens if not hundreds of thousand of workers, business<br/>
owners, and their families around the globe.<br/>
<br/>
On the evening of Thanksgiving Day, after the turkey has hit the soup, I gather<br/>
up the hundreds of pages of ads for the &quot;After Thanksgiving Day Sale&quot;. Now in<br/>
our family, as Quakers, we don&#39;t celebrate a traditional gift-giving Christmas,<br/>
so some of the heat is off. But the sales are good, I&#39;m told (though I&#39;ve often<br/>
suspected that the stores just mark up all the prices on their winter goods and<br/>
then take 40% off so that the prices are pretty much the same; I don&#39;t worship<br/>
in the mall often enough to know for sure.)  I then decide what I &#39;need&#39; or<br/>
&#39;want&#39; (when I say &quot;I&quot;, it is a corporate &quot;I&quot;, like in homeschooling family).<br/>
There&#39;s usually one or at most two items to be found in each of six or seven<br/>
different stores, the stores of course being scattered in various and sundry<br/>
parts of the city.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters and I arise at 6 a.m., I having pressed upon them how crucial it<br/>
is to arrive early, and having convinced them of the compelling superiority of<br/>
each particular item in the store that is our destination. We pull up at the<br/>
first store a little before 7. Stand in line. Purchase item. Then on to the<br/>
next store, and the next. We are relentlessly efficient. Like feeding sharks.<br/>
Sometimes we have to choose among colors, or designs, or whatnot. But no<br/>
tomfoolery - we know how to do this. We stick to the list. We don&#39;t browse. We<br/>
don&#39;t look at socks in the store where we buy jackets, or ties where we get<br/>
bedspreads. We don&#39;t get distracted by trinkets, sale signs, Santa Claus, or<br/>
handbills. We avoid &quot;smellville&quot; (that&#39;s what we call the cosmetics section of<br/>
the department store.) We refuse to be distracted. By 11 a.m., we are home,<br/>
like big game hunters, having bagged our limit.<br/>
<br/>
By 11:30, after surveying our cache over a second cup of coffee, nausea sets<br/>
in. I have convinced myself, and started to convince most of the rest of the<br/>
family (my wife, having conscientious abstained, doesn&#39;t need much convincing),<br/>
that at least half the items we purchased we really don&#39;t need, or they aren&#39;t<br/>
particularly nice, or they aren&#39;t any better than the same item we saw for ten<br/>
percent of the price we paid in the local thrift shop, and I don&#39;t like<br/>
sleeping under a blanket made by exploited children in Bangladesh or watching<br/>
my younger daughter run around in athletic shoes fabricated in unventilated<br/>
sweatshops in Indonesia (has anyone found a good alternative for these?)<br/>
<br/>
Over the next three days, I&#39;ll bring back at least half the items (the children<br/>
are excused) - perhaps these days should be dubbed &quot;Albert&#39;s Weekend of<br/>
Returns&quot;. The sales clerks hate to see me - they haven&#39;t been trained for<br/>
returns yet! Maybe I&#39;ll end up sending the extra money to India (or wherever<br/>
else I think it&#39;s needed), or, in rare instances, I&#39;ll exchange what we have<br/>
bought for different stuff. But I&#39;ll have burned up ten gallons of gas,<br/>
generated fair quantities of stress and used up good chunks of time we could<br/>
have spent in more life-fulfilling activities.<br/>
<br/>
There is no question that I (like many Americans) am suffering from a very<br/>
particular neurotic &#39;thought disorder&#39;, and I am now in recovery. Teaching our<br/>
children to become knowledgeable consumers is important, of course. But getting<br/>
them to understand the inherent dishonesty behind the artificial production of<br/>
new needs and desires is even more vital.  Liberating my children by providing<br/>
alternatives to America&#39;s religion of consumption, and helping them understand<br/>
the non-material basis for a truly satisfying life is, in my judgment, central<br/>
to my family&#39;s homeschooling efforts, and ranks up there well ahead of state<br/>
capitals, square roots, or French verbs.<br/>
<br/>
And now I&#39;ve gotten some help. The holiday has been given an appropriate name<br/>
that has been gaining in popularity - &quot;International Buy Nothing Day&quot;! Check it<br/>
out at www.adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/  Started about five years ago by a<br/>
Canadian magazine named Adbusters (I guess my lack of economic patriotism is<br/>
showing), BND, as it is now affectionately known, was celebrated last year in<br/>
more than 30 countries, including France, Japan, Panama, Israel, South Korea,<br/>
Brazil, as well as the United States.  Billed as a &quot;global carnival of life in<br/>
the face of consumer conformity&quot;, BND has gone so far as to produce radio and<br/>
television spots to get their message across, though in most cases requests to<br/>
purchase time for the spots have been rejected by network executives [&quot;Contrary<br/>
to the function of advertising itself and against our ethics (sic),&quot; said one)]<br/>
only to have the story of their rejection, complete with ad clips, make it on<br/>
the evening news.  On the BND website, you can download &quot;Christmas Gift<br/>
Exemption Vouchers&quot; to give to friends and family, templates for buttons and<br/>
tee shirts, and a full range of posters and press releases. A celebration is<br/>
likely coming to a town or city near you-and, if it hasn&#39;t yet, start one! Make<br/>
a new family tradition.  Adbusters, by the way, is a delightfully irreverent,<br/>
sophisticated rag filled with strategies for bringing corporations back under<br/>
people&#39;s control, and fighting the commercialization of public education (don&#39;t<br/>
get me started on that one!), and is a great source for posters, stickers, and<br/>
other materials to be used in guerilla anti-marketing campaigns. Your<br/>
rebellious (or just socially conscious) homeschooled teen or pre-teen will love<br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
Not quite ready for Buy Nothing Day? Well, then connect up with the Center for<br/>
a New American Dream&#39;s &quot;Kids and Commercialism Campaign&quot;. You can find them<br/>
online at www.newdream.org/campaign/kids/index.html.  Download their excellent<br/>
brochure, &quot;Tips for Parenting in a Commercial Culture.&quot;  There is a kids<br/>
website full of fun, non-commercial play ideas, advice from responsible<br/>
consumption gurus, essay contests, and links to dozens of groups who will keep<br/>
you better informed as you gird up your loins, take up your battle axe, and<br/>
stand ready to defend your hearth and kin against the next advertising<br/>
onslaught.<br/>
<br/>
Americans represent less than 5% of the world&#39;s population, but consume 30% of<br/>
the planet&#39;s material resources, and we continue to churn out waste at an<br/>
alarming rate. One scientist has figured out that we would need four extra<br/>
planets if everyone on earth consumed as much as Americans do. But let&#39;s not<br/>
load down our holidays with guilt. Rather, let&#39;s choose to use our holidays to<br/>
reconnect ourselves with friends, with nature, and with our playful, creative<br/>
sides, and help rebuild communities that extend far beyond the confines of the<br/>
shopping mall parking lot. And, if we&#39;re really smart, we can do that with our<br/>
children every day. For me, that&#39;s what homeschooling is all about.<br/>
<br/>
Make a big poster with your kids emblazoned &quot;More Fun, Less Stuff!&quot; Try it out<br/>
as a family slogan (you could even write a family jingle!), and hang it in a<br/>
prominent place. Next time you feel the urge to shop coming on, look at the<br/>
poster, and you&#39;ll know it&#39;s time to clean out the garage. &quot;Hey, this could<br/>
spell the end of civilization as we know it,&quot; says my friend Anthony (I think<br/>
he was referring to responsible consumerism, not to the new era of uncluttered<br/>
garages across America.) And in only my second column!  Now in my next<br/>
column....<br/>
