I&#39;ve been called &quot;fat&quot; a few times and I&#39;ve discovered that if I act shocked<br/>
and begin a monologue along he lines of, &quot;Fat?  Are you sure?  I&#39;m fat?<br/>
You&#39;re not lying?  I didn&#39;t KNOW that!  Oh my gosh!  I can&#39;t believe this!&quot;.<br/>
They just stand there looking like they&#39;ve just seen a goat fly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s my reaction when people say, in an amazed voice &quot;You&#39;re husband&#39;s <br/>
black?&quot;  &quot;Really, I hadn&#39;t noticed, you&#39;d think he would have told me, <br/>
I&#39;ll have to speak to him about with holding information from me, wonder <br/>
what else he hasn&#39;t told me, etc.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But today at the school where I teach I witnessed some boys calling a <br/>
girl some horrid names.  I really didn&#39;t see the actual name calling, I <br/>
only saw the after effects, and the other teacher handling it.  I was <br/>
thinking that I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d see such things at a homeschool park <br/>
day, and I tried to figure out why.  I finally decided that the <br/>
homeschooled kids I know have not been torn down, they do not need <br/>
others to tell them they are worthy or good or valued members of their <br/>
society, they don&#39;t spend hours upon hours with their &quot;peers&quot;, they <br/>
don&#39;t feel so shut down by a system that cannot succeed that they do not <br/>
feel the need to build themselves up by putting others down.  <br/>
<br/>
For those who are strong and have a sense of themselves and their value, <br/>
name calling is nothing.  <br/>
