<div id="ygrps-yiv-877420904">&lt;&lt;They [animals] are not sentient.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you really believe that?  I *know* my animals are quite capable of <br/>
emotional repsonses.  I venture a guess that emotions and physical, primal <br/>
desires are the driving forces, rather than intellectual ponderings of <br/>
what&#39;s to come.  It is their biology to procreate.  They have no way of <br/>
knowing their &#39;population statistics&#39;.  So I do agree wih you that it is our <br/>
responsibility to make reproductive decisions for them.  Perhaps there are <br/>
others who will disagree?<br/>

&gt; across the room and tell the dog &quot;Get the red ball&quot; and it would get <br/>

&gt; I said &quot;the red ball most likely SMELLED differently than the blue <br/>

late.<br/>

There&#39;s an obedience dog demo team here. Each dog and handler team wears a <br/>
different color shirt & bandana. At the end of the demo, several different <br/>
colored dumbells are placed in the center of the group. Each dog is sent into the <br/>
middle to pick out &quot;his&quot; color dumbell. It&#39;s a Utility level exercise on scent <br/>
discrimination---quite easy for the dogs, but everyone believes the dog is <br/>
picking out his &quot;color&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Magic&quot; at work! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
