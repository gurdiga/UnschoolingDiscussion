<div id="ygrps-yiv-819835719">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>

and<br/>
reasoned response reflects better on homeschoolers as a group.&gt;<br/>

Here is what I sent:<br/>
<br/>
August 22, 1999<br/>
<br/>
To the Editor<br/>
There are as many ways to homeschool as there are homeschoolers.  Perhaps<br/>
there is a child somewhere who fits your cartoon.  However, I&#39;ve never met<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t attempt to &quot;do school&quot; at home.  We don&#39;t rise at 6:00 every<br/>
morning, sit at a desk, eat lunch at 11:23 or raise our hands to use the<br/>
bathroom.  Does that mean my children have had no childhood? I think not!<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old would not know what recess was because he has never had one!<br/>
If you asked him about recess you would probably just get a blank look.  If<br/>
you asked him does he play every day, does he swing, climb, ride his bike,<br/>
play baseball, go swimming, go bowling - well then he could answer you!<br/>
And he has friends,  but they are not all 7 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike many teenagers, my 18 year old feels just as comfortable around<br/>
adults as teens. He has been working along side adults for years.  Does that<br/>
mean he has missed out on being a teenager?  Hmm - he drives to fast, stays<br/>
out to late, always has a phone in his hand (sometimes 2 at once) and thinks<br/>
his parents don&#39;t know anything.  Isn&#39;t that a typical teenager?  He also<br/>
has a paper route, a fulltime job and plays tuba in the high school band (we<br/>
live in a very enlightened school district).  He has lots of friends, some<br/>
are kids and some are adults. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s missing out on much.<br/>
<br/>
My children aren&#39;t sheltered from the world by being homeschooled - they are<br/>
living and learning in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have a comment?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642875009">In my response I pointed out that all of my children&#39;s friends are jelous <br/>
(they want to be homeschooled too!!) and I always seem to have a gaggle of <br/>
neighborhood kids in my kitchen concocting something or in my garage being <br/>
artsy...quite different from what they can do at home.  I just noticed this <br/>
year how different my 8 yos is from other boys his age. They kept teasing him <br/>
for being gullible and I realized the problem was that he is not dishonest <br/>
and therefore does not expect anyone else to be either.  In light of that I <br/>
see the sadness of these young children already sifting through the words of <br/>
others for truth. <br/>
Anyway, now I am rambling! Blessings, Lori in TX</div>
