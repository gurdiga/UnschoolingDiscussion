homeschools her kids. You mention the reason you are keeping the kids home<br/>
is so that you don&#39;t &quot;stifle&quot; them or have them &quot;lined up.&quot; Please tell us<br/>
more about that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594216073">Hello Everybody,<br/>
I just joined this list.  I recognize some of you from other lists:)<br/>
My husband Ron and I live in Halifax, NS in eastern Canada.  We unschool<br/>
our 5 kids, boys aged 16 1/2, 15, almost 13, 10 1/2 and a girl who is 5 1/2.<br/>
We started our homeschooling and unschooling journey in Montreal but have<br/>
lived out here for more than 7 years.<br/>
I haven&#39;t been on any unschooling lists for a couple of years and am<br/>
looking forward to chatting with other unschoolers.<br/>
That&#39;s it for now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ned, while this is a perfectly legitimate question for one person to ask<br/>
another here, I am *politely* asking why *you* specifically are asking. You<br/>
don&#39;t have a child in school. You don&#39;t even have a child at home. You are<br/>
not struggling with the decision on whether to take your child out of school<br/>
or not or what method to use to homeschool them.<br/>
<br/>
The only conceivable reason I can think for your asking is that your trying<br/>
to bring &quot;testimonials&quot; to the list so the rest of us will finally &quot;get&quot;<br/>
what you&#39;re saying.<br/>
<br/>
We are not an &quot;us&quot; that needs someone whose been there and done that to ask<br/>
our questions for us. (That&#39;s feeling awfully schoolish to me.) Those of<br/>
&quot;us&quot; who want to know will ask.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&quot; are also not an &quot;us&quot; because you are not currently unschooling a child.<br/>
It&#39;s unfortunate to point that out since it could make others who aren&#39;t<br/>
unschooling a child feel uncomfomtable about being here or posting, but<br/>
since you repeatedly insist that your concerns must be our concerns, it<br/>
apparently needs to be pointed out. Someone who is not of (or not<br/>
considering becoming part of) the demographic a list is set up for should<br/>
politely sit back and respect the natural flow of the conversation of those<br/>
who are of the demographic. People have said your experiences as an<br/>
unschooling father that are relevant to questions asked are more than<br/>
welcome. They do address the concerns of the demographic. The list is not<br/>
set up to meet the needs of those who are beyond the unschooling life.<br/>
