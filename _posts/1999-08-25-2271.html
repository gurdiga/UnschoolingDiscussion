I&#39;m not speaking for Lori, but when I responded to this post, I took it to <br/>
mean that historically, women in general (or at least in this country) have <br/>
changed their feelings about mothering.  And the feelings I assumed she meant <br/>
were the ones we were talking about re: whether to stay at home with your <br/>
children and did that represent giving up your own life.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to speak for Lori, just to put my last post in context.<br/>
