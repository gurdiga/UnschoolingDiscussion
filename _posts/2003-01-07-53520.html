<div id="ygrps-yiv-442333699">I understand about the unschooling way of thought when it comes to how a <br/>
child learns and how parents let them learn, but I don&#39;t understand how most <br/>
unschoolers raise their children.  What I mean is at what age and what things <br/>
do parents let children make their own decisions.  I&#39;m talking about everyday <br/>
living, which is what unschooling is about. <br/>
<br/>
Could unschoolers give specific examples about the choices they let their <br/>
children make and at what ages did they do that.  The specific examples may <br/>
include things like brushing their teeth, picking up after themselves, taking <br/>
a bath, eating what they want, getting dressed, going to Church, deciding <br/>
what to wear, riding their bikes in the road, going to bed at night, and <br/>
other things like that.  I would also like to know any stories about how you <br/>
may have changed, or what things worked and didn&#39;t work and the reasons you <br/>
feel they worked or didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get a few responses to this, but these exact questions have <br/>
been answered on the message boards---and many of them have their own <br/>
folders! You can read and read and read---for weeks and months on the message <br/>
boards for specific examples from many of these same posters and others. <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right: unschooling IS a lifestyle. It&#39;ll encompass your whole being. <br/>
It&#39;s life-changing for the entire family ---and for many people around you. <br/>
Nagging doesn&#39;t work. Shaming doesn&#39;t work. Demanding doesn&#39;t work. Kindness, <br/>
sharing, humility, and respect work great! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Could unschoolers give specific examples about the choices they let their <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have always let our children decide what they wanted to eat although I try <br/>
to keep relatively healthy foods in the house.  We are vegetarians but they <br/>
are always allowed to eat what they want when we go out.  They also decide <br/>
when they want to eat and how much.  My boys decide what they want to wear <br/>
and do not want to wear (another humorous story) and have always done so.  <br/>
They decide about TV and PS2.  Also make their own decisions about computer <br/>
games.  I do make them brush their teeth.  Actually I have always brushed <br/>
their teeth (they are 8 and 5 now).  The dentist is a phobia of mine.  I make <br/>
health related decisions at this point and safety related decisions like <br/>
riding their bike in the road.  That will probably change as they age.  <br/>
Although we do discuss everything.  I do tell them why I feel it is necessary <br/>
that they see the dentist.  And they do love the dentist she is great.  They <br/>
are allowed to express their opinions on the subject and are also allowed to <br/>
their feelings.  We do a lot of talking.  <br/>
<br/>
They pick up their rooms when they feel they need to, like when a friend is <br/>
coming over and they want to play in their room.  I pick up their toys when <br/>
they get in my way.  They do leave a lot of projects and toys in progress <br/>
like LEGOs around the house and that is not a problem.  They pick those up <br/>
when they need a place to play.  I am not a neat freak by any means.  We each <br/>
have our own computers.  I keep mine neat.  They do not.  But it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
to bother them and it doesn&#39;t bother me.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway just a few of the things we do.  LOL<br/>

&lt;&lt; What I mean is at what age and what things <br/>
do parents let children make their own decisions.  I&#39;m talking about everyday <br/>
living, which is what unschooling is about.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t let a four year old decide whether to cruise with his friends and <br/>
stay out all  night, but I do let Kirby now that he&#39;s 16.  Their cruising <br/>
goes straight to someone&#39;s house to play games.  And when he was four he <br/>
didn&#39;t WANT to go anywhere or stay out all night, so that was easy.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what I&#39;m saying is that I WOULD let a four year old.  I just never had <br/>
a four year old who didn&#39;t want to hang out with me!<br/>
<br/>
But if I gave them no choice they couldn&#39;t possibly be staying home with me <br/>
by choice.<br/>
<br/>
When they were little and we went to playdays at the park, before we were <br/>
homeschoolers, it was a La Leche League babysitting co-op park day, so the <br/>
families were all into attachment parenting.  That helped.   And attachment <br/>
parenting says if you let the kids be with you all they want to, they will <br/>
eventually want to walk away and explore the world on their own.<br/>
<br/>
The really cool thing is if you let a baby sit with you and climb on you and <br/>
nurse on you and sleep on your lap, if he gets up and toddles away toward the <br/>
playground, you know he truly WANTS to go to the playground.  And so his <br/>
experience is different from a kid whose mom said, &quot;We came to the <br/>
playground, now GO PLAY.  And make it snappy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if a child WANTS to go to the playground, he might or might not need a <br/>
mom following right behind him.  Depends on the place and the child.  And if <br/>
he says &quot;Come with me,&quot; and you say &quot;OKAY!&quot; (instead of &quot;No, I&#39;m talking to <br/>
my friends, you go play by yourself&quot;) then he starts getting some life long <br/>
confidence that if he needs his mom to come, she will.<br/>
<br/>
This morning at 10:00 there was a phone call for Kirby.  &quot;Kirby&#39;s asleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know, I&#39;m sorry.  This is Ryan.  I really need to talk to him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay.&quot;  And I start hobbling up the stairs to Kirby&#39;s room.  I trust Ryan.  <br/>
He&#39;s older, 20 maybe, and works with Kirby at the gaming shop.  He and his <br/>
girlfriend hang out with Kirby socially at least twice a week.  On the way I <br/>
reminded him I&#39;m slow because of the leg, and he said, &quot;Glen&#39;s dad had a <br/>
stroke, so they had to go to Alamogordo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Alamogordo is a four hour drive to the southeast.   Glen is the owner&#39;s <br/>
husband and &quot;they&quot; are Glen and his wife Jodi, who owns the shop.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby wasn&#39;t in his bed.  His friend Joey was on a futon on the floor, so I <br/>
had to wake Joey up.  Before I went to sleep, I passed on the two Kirby phone <br/>
messages:  Kevin called and Will called.  So I said, &quot;Joey, did Kirby go home <br/>
with Will?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told Ryan I&#39;d call Kirby.  So I end up waking up Will (who trusts me) who <br/>
woke up Kirby, and another friend also staying over there took Kirby to work <br/>
at 11:30.  He&#39;ll work until 3:30 when he goes to karate for two hours.<br/>
<br/>
I told Kirby that if none of those guys at Will&#39;s could give him a ride, I <br/>
would go and get him if he could call and wait outside.  I can drive short <br/>
distances now, and it&#39;s not that far.  He called when he knew he had another <br/>
ride.  But the idea that his mom would come and get him if necessary was as <br/>
true today as it was fourteen years ago when he was two and exploring the <br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly just walked in and said &quot;I wish we were like most families.&quot;<br/>
Not because I want to go to school, but because I want you to be making <br/>
BREAKFAST for me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s 1:03, Holly.&quot;  (She woke up at 11:45 and as been taking a leisurely <br/>
shower.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then I want you to be making LUNCH for me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I did, and came back to finish this.<br/>

Holly holds the record here.  She had the stretching, though, and the <br/>
straightening up her morning toys, and the going to get milk, and then the <br/>
towelling and fluffing her new haircut.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s some kind of little beauty queen.  It&#39;s very foreign to us.<br/>
