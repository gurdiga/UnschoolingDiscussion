<div id="ygrps-yiv-826746636">5 weeks ago I started homeschooling our 9year old daughter.  I wanted<br/>
to take an unschooling approach but am having a very difficult time<br/>
getting through the day. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is very strongwilled and very artistic.  She is highly<br/>
hands on type of person.  I find trying to teach each class  becomes<br/>
extremely boring.  Each class I have a book for and it seems like she<br/>
doesnt listen to all the reading and to be honest this isnt what I<br/>
pictured homeschooling to be.<br/>
<br/>
She loves Jesus but shows extreme boredom when reading bible stories<br/>
and it seems like we are doing more text book reading then fun<br/>
stuff.  I wanted homeschooling to be fun to her and me not boring and<br/>
a burden. <br/>
<br/>
She loves online games but I get tired of her wanting to spend so<br/>
much time on them.  She helps with chores which is a good thing but<br/>
it takes alot of reminding.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 2 year old in the house and I find I am having him sit<br/>
in front of the tv most of the  day when I am trying to teach his<br/>
sister.  I feel so overwhelmed because that isnt what I want for my<br/>
son either. <br/>
<br/>
I really need some advise I am struggling so much and if school were<br/>
more fun maybe she would pay more attention and actually absorb some<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad comes home everyday and asks her what she learned in<br/>
homeschool that day and she never has anything to tell him which<br/>
makes my efforts feel useless.  I also notice we have to spend 875<br/>
hours a year on homeschooling but it seems we only do about 4 hours a<br/>
day which would never get us to the 875 mark unless we schooled 12<br/>
months out of a year.<br/>
<br/>
How do you ensure they are learning what they need to for their grade <br/>
level each day?<br/>
<br/>
Please Help<br/>

approach immediately.   Let your daughter have a vacation, let her  <br/>
play and read and sleep all she wants.  Take her to lunch or the  <br/>
movies but don&#39;t talk about homeschooling or learning or any such thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t do any reading right now, especially if it seems the least bit  <br/>
schoolish.  Don&#39;t read until she misses it and requests it.<br/>
<br/>

Unschooling can be that.  Here are some short accounts of inspiring  <br/>
days of many families:<br/>

Your mood and attitude should have nothing to do with it.   Find  <br/>
something YOU want to do while she&#39;s doing that.  She isn&#39;t playing  <br/>
games to energize or amuse you.  Your boredom is irrelevant and  <br/>
burdensome and shows you need a hobby of your own!<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chores">http://sandradodd.com/chores</a><br/>
If it takes a lot of reminding, you could take another direction  <br/>
entirely.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also have a 2 year old in the house and I find I am having him sit<br/>
in front of the tv most of the  day when I am trying to teach his<br/>
sister. -=-<br/>
<br/>
He is not choosing to sit there?  You are &quot;having him&quot; do it?<br/>
If you stop trying to teach his sister, but find ways to live happily  <br/>
with your children instead, all your stated problems will be solved  <br/>
in a heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I really need some advise I am struggling so much and if school were<br/>

<br/>
You cannot have school and also be an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Her dad comes home everyday and asks her what she learned in<br/>
homeschool that day and she never has anything to tell him which<br/>
makes my efforts feel useless.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Same thing kids at school say:  &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/>
So ask your husband to stop asking, and then stop doing school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also notice we have to spend 875<br/>
hours a year on homeschooling but it seems we only do about 4 hours a<br/>
day which would never get us to the 875 mark unless we schooled 12<br/>

<br/>
Blah blah blah blah blah.<br/>
Stop looking at those numbers.  Do a math problem for real.  How many  <br/>
waking hours are in a year?  If you play and laugh and watch DVDs  <br/>
together and listen to music and sing along, and go on hikes and camp  <br/>
out in the den (or the yard, if it&#39;s not too cold) and build things  <br/>
and cook and play with puppets, and you tell stories and paint and  <br/>
color and go to thrift stores and play video games and build with  <br/>
blocks and play with toy cars, how much time is left over?<br/>
<br/>
Your children will spend MUCH more then four hours a day learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How do you ensure they are learning what they need to for their grade<br/>
level each day?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know how to ensure that they don&#39;t want to learn, don&#39;t want to be  <br/>
read to, don&#39;t want to hang out with mom, and wish they were in  <br/>
school instead.  You&#39;ve figured out some of that too.<br/>
<br/>
I also know how to ensure that they learn without even knowing they  <br/>
did, that they LOVE to be with their family, and they&#39;re curious and  <br/>
happy.<br/>

You&#39;re asking the wrong questions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t unschooling so -- to be honest :-) -- it&#39;s  <br/>
why you&#39;re having problems!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I find trying to teach each class  becomes<br/>

&gt; pictured homeschooling to be.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For many people it *is* what homeschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t have to be.<br/>
<br/>
Textbooks are used in classrooms not because they&#39;re awesome ways to  <br/>
learn but because they&#39;re efficient ways for one person to impose a  <br/>
specific set of *testable* knowledge on 30 kids. If we were to list  <br/>
all the ways there are to learn in order of how effective they are,  <br/>
the teacher imposing information through a textbook way would be  <br/>
pretty far down the list. But, as I said, cost per student is  <br/>
relatively low.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you&#39;re planning on teaching 30 kids there&#39;s no reason to use  <br/>
inferior ways of learning!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She loves Jesus but shows extreme boredom when reading bible stories<br/>
&gt; and it seems like we are doing more text book reading then fun<br/>

&gt; a burden.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The easiest way to fix that is to put aside the textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel you need to teach religion I can&#39;t help you there. There  <br/>
are, though, Christian unschooling lists that will let you see how  <br/>
others incorporate the Bible into their unschooling lives without  <br/>
turning it into teaching and lessons. Try the lists at:<br/>
<br/>
http://sandradodd.com/lists/other<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She loves online games but I get tired of her wanting to spend so<br/>
&gt; much time on them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you had the choice between pulling an acre full of weeds with  <br/>
tweezers and reading a new book by your favorite author how much time  <br/>
would you spend reading?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She helps with chores which is a good thing but<br/>
&gt; it takes alot of reminding.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And how long would your husband have to wait for you to get outside  <br/>
and pull the weeds with the tweezers?<br/>
<br/>
If he was totally convinced that it was important for you to pull the  <br/>
weeds with the tweezers, is there a way he could convince you that it  <br/>
was important too so that you would set aside the things you thought  <br/>
were important?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also have a 2 year old in the house and I find I am having him sit<br/>
&gt; in front of the tv most of the  day when I am trying to teach his<br/>
&gt; sister.  I feel so overwhelmed because that isnt what I want for my<br/>
&gt; son either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You won&#39;t need to put him aside when you unschool because learning is  <br/>
part of living and he&#39;s part of her life too :-)<br/>
<br/>
There will still be times when she&#39;ll appreciate some alone time with  <br/>
you to do a project or just read a book uninterrupted, but not  <br/>
because you want her to learn and he&#39;s interfering.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I really need some advise I am struggling so much and if school were<br/>
&gt; more fun maybe she would pay more attention and actually absorb some<br/>
&gt; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You and millions of teachers and parents have said the same thing for  <br/>
decades!<br/>
<br/>
Imagine for the next 12 years your husband would decide what you  <br/>
should spend your days learning about, say for this year it&#39;s  <br/>
Mongolian history, Engine rebuilding, Chinese language, and abacus  <br/>
work. And, though he&#39;s totally convinced that what he chooses is the  <br/>
most important stuff for you, you aren&#39;t interested and can&#39;t  <br/>
understand why you should be learning it. All he does is repeat that  <br/>
it&#39;s important and one day you&#39;ll understand. And that&#39;s what you  <br/>
have to look forward to for the next 12 years.<br/>
<br/>
How could he make it more interesting? How could it be less of a  <br/>
struggle for him (and for you)? If you come up with the magic formula  <br/>
for that you&#39;ll probably make lots of money because schools will be  <br/>
beating your door down ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The only difference between the above scenario and school is that it  <br/>
would be hard to find others who agreed with your husband that the  <br/>
list of things is vitally important and it is easy to find people who  <br/>
*think* what&#39;s learned in school is vitally important.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers aren&#39;t doing anything that looks like school, aren&#39;t  <br/>
learning things in any particular order, and they&#39;re turning out  <br/>
fine. They can go onto college. They can get jobs.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter had no formal math but is sitting in on her father&#39;s  <br/>
college algebra class and doing just fine at 14. Her math has been  <br/>
video games, art programs, grocery stores, &quot;How long until?&quot;  <br/>
questions, games, sports statistics and so on. (They did do some fun  <br/>
algebra a couple of years ago but Carl says as far as he can tell it  <br/>
didn&#39;t stick and it appears as though she&#39;s seeing it for the first  <br/>
time.) That&#39;s because she&#39;s been *using* numbers all her life for  <br/>
real purposes. She understands how numbers work. Kids in school are  <br/>
being taught abstractions about numbers that they aren&#39;t using and --  <br/>
after sitting through confusing math classes -- don&#39;t want to and  <br/>
often avoid using. Math and lots of other subjects in school are like  <br/>
memorizing Spanish words and sentence structure without ever hearing  <br/>
the language or using it. It&#39;s just stuff that goes in to be stored  <br/>
until it might be used one day. But, of course, after that process  <br/>
kids don&#39;t want to and often don&#39;t have any interest in anything that  <br/>
might use it. (That&#39;s not a universal occurrence but kids who do well  <br/>
in school and eagerly move onto college do that *in spite of* what  <br/>
they put up with in school.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Her dad comes home everyday and asks her what she learned in<br/>
&gt; homeschool that day and she never has anything to tell him which<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ask school kids that question and they give the same answer!<br/>
<br/>
Though, honestly, if you ask many unschooled kids that question,  <br/>
you&#39;ll get that answer too ;-)<br/>
<br/>
A better question, a more authentic question since it&#39;s what you  <br/>
might ask another adult, is &quot;What did you do today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also notice we have to spend 875<br/>
&gt; hours a year on homeschooling but it seems we only do about 4 hours a<br/>
&gt; day which would never get us to the 875 mark unless we schooled 12<br/>
&gt; months out of a year.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is about living life and pursuing interests in a rich  <br/>
environment. Learning happens as a side effect of that. So in  <br/>
essence, unschooling happens for all hours they&#39;re awake 7 days a  <br/>
week, 52 weeks a year.<br/>
<br/>
It *won&#39;t* look like school learning. It *will* look like playing and  <br/>
being interested in things and exploring and living life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you ensure they are learning what they need to for their grade<br/>
&gt; level each day?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is living like school doesn&#39;t exist. In which case there  <br/>
is no grade level to keep up with.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds scary because when kids *in school* &quot;fall behind&quot; the  <br/>
effects are often kids falling further and further behind. But that  <br/>
happens because school is like a train. If a child pauses on the  <br/>
platform to check out the flowers, the train isn&#39;t going to wait. It  <br/>
takes off and the child needs to run to catch up with it.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, it&#39;s more like mom walking along side her child as  <br/>
he explores, helping him reach what he&#39;s trying to get that&#39;s out of  <br/>
his reach, waiting patiently as he explores what fascinates him  <br/>
(which can be online games!) Without the train taking off, there&#39;s no  <br/>
such thing as behind.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lots to be learned about unschooling here, at the forums at  <br/>

Your mood and attitude should have nothing to do with it.   Find <br/>
something YOU want to do while she&#39;s doing that.  She isn&#39;t playing <br/>
games to energize or amuse you.  Your boredom is irrelevant and <br/>
burdensome and shows you need a hobby of your own!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
I have many hobbies of my own I just feel like I am being a bad parent <br/>
letting her spend too much time on online roleplaying games and tv.  My <br/>
husband is also stressing me out because he doesnt understand <br/>
Unschooling and thinks at home school should be structured with the <br/>
american flag and text book courses.  Any ideas on how to convince my <br/>
husband unschooling is better and any ways to feeling like I am not a <br/>
failure mom by letting her do what society says is wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781514071">Thank you all for your advice.  This really helps me understand <br/>
unschooling better.  Now just to get my husband to understand it as <br/>
well.  The other day we took a day off and she told her dad how much fun <br/>
she had but then when the kids were in bed he scolded me for not <br/>
teaching that day. so this won&#39;t be easy to get him to understand<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195450747">One of the things you have to do for your own peace of mind is *accept* the fact that if you choose to unschool, learning is probably *not* going to look like school, and thats *ok*.<br/>
<br/>
You really can&#39;t have it both ways unless your child is so inclined.  Your child is *not* going to learn the same kinds of things in the same order as schooled kids.  But your child might learn many *other* new and interesting things that schooled kids never learn.<br/>
<br/>
The world is soooooo much bigger than what the school is even *able* to offer.   Who on earth decided that &quot;social studies&quot; was important to put in school curriculum anyway?<br/>
<br/>
And who decided that &quot;math&quot; had to be learned in a linear fashion?   What schools call &quot;math&quot; is actually a foreign language.  True Mathematics is a SCIENCE and all of what we know about Mathematics was discovered in much the same way as things we know in the sciences. <br/>
<br/>
Truly, most of what we know as &quot;normal&quot; kind of school is just &quot;tradition&quot; based on the status quo.  Its not really based on any real research.  And what little research there is hasn&#39;t really even begun to look at free and independent learners in childhood.  There are some, but they are drowned out by the status quo.  And unfortunately too few people actually question the status quo.<br/>
<br/>
First *you* have to be convinced that it works, and that its ok if it doesn&#39;t look like anything traditional.  Then you can start helping your husband understand it.<br/>

  Your mood and attitude should have nothing to do with it.   Find <br/>
  something YOU want to do while she&#39;s doing that.  She isn&#39;t playing <br/>

  I have many hobbies of my own I just feel like I am being a bad parent <br/>
  letting her spend too much time on online roleplaying games and tv.  My <br/>
  husband is also stressing me out because he doesnt understand <br/>
  Unschooling and thinks at home school should be structured with the <br/>
  american flag and text book courses.  Any ideas on how to convince my <br/>
  husband unschooling is better and any ways to feeling like I am not a <br/>
  failure mom by letting her do what society says is wrong.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; getting through the day.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; If you want to take an unschooling approach, stop any and all OTHER <br/>
  &gt; approach immediately.   Let your daughter have a vacation, let her <br/>
  &gt; play and read and sleep all she wants.  Take her to lunch or the <br/>
  &gt; movies but don&#39;t talk about homeschooling or learning or any such thing.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; -=-<br/>
  &gt; She loves Jesus but shows extreme boredom when reading bible stories<br/>
  &gt; and it seems like we are doing more text book reading then fun<br/>
  &gt; stuff.  -=-<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Don&#39;t do any reading right now, especially if it seems the least bit <br/>
  &gt; schoolish.  Don&#39;t read until she misses it and requests it.<br/>

  &gt; Unschooling can be that.  Here are some short accounts of inspiring <br/>
  &gt; days of many families:<br/>

  &gt; -=-She helps with chores which is a good thing but<br/>
  &gt; it takes alot of reminding.-=-<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chores">http://sandradodd.com/chores</a><br/>
  &gt; If it takes a lot of reminding, you could take another direction <br/>
  &gt; entirely.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; -=-I also have a 2 year old in the house and I find I am having him sit<br/>
  &gt; in front of the tv most of the  day when I am trying to teach his<br/>
  &gt; sister. -=-<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; He is not choosing to sit there?  You are &quot;having him&quot; do it?<br/>
  &gt; If you stop trying to teach his sister, but find ways to live happily <br/>
  &gt; with your children instead, all your stated problems will be solved <br/>
  &gt; in a heartbeat.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; -=-I really need some advise I am struggling so much and if school were<br/>
  &gt; more fun maybe she would pay more attention and actually absorb some<br/>
  &gt; stuff.-=-<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; You cannot have school and also be an unschooler.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; -=-Her dad comes home everyday and asks her what she learned in<br/>
  &gt; homeschool that day and she never has anything to tell him which<br/>
  &gt; makes my efforts feel useless.-=-<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Same thing kids at school say:  &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; So ask your husband to stop asking, and then stop doing school.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; -=-I also notice we have to spend 875<br/>
  &gt; hours a year on homeschooling but it seems we only do about 4 hours a<br/>
  &gt; day which would never get us to the 875 mark unless we schooled 12<br/>
  &gt; months out of a year.-=-<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Blah blah blah blah blah.<br/>
  &gt; Stop looking at those numbers.  Do a math problem for real.  How many <br/>
  &gt; waking hours are in a year?  If you play and laugh and watch DVDs <br/>
  &gt; together and listen to music and sing along, and go on hikes and camp <br/>
  &gt; out in the den (or the yard, if it&#39;s not too cold) and build things <br/>
  &gt; and cook and play with puppets, and you tell stories and paint and <br/>
  &gt; color and go to thrift stores and play video games and build with <br/>
  &gt; blocks and play with toy cars, how much time is left over?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Your children will spend MUCH more then four hours a day learning.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; -=-How do you ensure they are learning what they need to for their grade<br/>
  &gt; level each day?<br/>
  &gt; -=-<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I know how to ensure that they don&#39;t want to learn, don&#39;t want to be <br/>
  &gt; read to, don&#39;t want to hang out with mom, and wish they were in <br/>
  &gt; school instead.  You&#39;ve figured out some of that too.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I also know how to ensure that they learn without even knowing they <br/>
  &gt; did, that they LOVE to be with their family, and they&#39;re curious and <br/>
  &gt; happy.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>

<br/>
You are missing the point of unschooling.  So much learning takes place<br/>
during games and t.v.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; My husband is also stressing me out because he doesnt understand<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling and thinks at home school should be structured with the<br/>
american flag and text book courses.  Any ideas on how to convince my<br/>
husband unschooling is better&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you and your husband done any reading together about unschooling?  He<br/>
can&#39;t have an opinion about something he knows nothing about. (I am assuming<br/>
here)  My recommendation is for both of you to first of all, RELAX!  Then<br/>
saturate yourselves with information about unschooling.  Talk about it with<br/>
one another.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;and any ways to feeling like I am not a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>failure mom by letting her do what society says is wrong.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Forget society!  What is best for you and your family is really all that<br/>
matters.  When my dh and I decided to unschool, the stress in our family<br/>
just evaporated.  I am not going to tell you there won&#39;t be moments of &quot;am I<br/>
really doing o.k.&quot;  but they are few once you make the commitment to be a<br/>
radical unschooler.  Know why you are doing what you are doing.  Our<br/>
relationship with our girls is incredible.  I hear so many parents wanting<br/>
time away from their kids and for my dh and me that is just foreign to us.<br/>
We love time together with our girls.  To the average person our days<br/>
wouldn&#39;t look educational.  But my dh and I are constantly amazed at what<br/>
our girls teach us!  It took my girls over a year to find their passions<br/>
once we left the school system.  I am so glad I trusted our decision and let<br/>
them bloom.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think I would be a failure if I dictated to them what they had<br/>
to do and not give them the freedom to be the person God created them to be.<br/>
I sometimes wonder how different my life would be if I had been given the<br/>
opportunity my girls have.<br/>
<br/>
Deana, stick around and read, read, read.  There are some really great<br/>
people in this group with a whole lot more years of wisdom than I have.<br/>
Commit to take the next month and just enjoy your children.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the journey!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I were designing a curriculum it would have lots of social  <br/>
studies.  We&#39;re not talking about curriculum anyway, but kids who  <br/>
learn from the world around them can&#39;t help but learn all the kinds  <br/>
of things that school calls &quot;social studies&quot;—where people live, what  <br/>
they do, what families are good for and how they operate, what  <br/>
governments do for people, how communities are organized, what might  <br/>
make one person or place &quot;richer&quot; than another, what languages are  <br/>
good for and the fact that not all people use the same one...   <br/>
Calling it &quot;social studies&quot; is a school construct.  Separating it  <br/>
from history and English and music is an oddity of school.  But the  <br/>
&quot;material,&quot; and the &quot;subject matter&quot; is the fabric of life itself.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What schools call &quot;math&quot; is actually a foreign language.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a traditional notation for something natural.<br/>
Music isn&#39;t a foreign language, but musical notation is a kind of  <br/>
written language.<br/>
They&#39;re both notation, as taught formally.  The REAL music and math  <br/>
don&#39;t have to be written down, but school can&#39;t teach and test it  <br/>
without it being in writing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Truly, most of what we know as &quot;normal&quot; kind of school is just  <br/>
&quot;tradition&quot; based on the status quo.  Its not really based on any  <br/>
real research.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What they do is based on a ton of research, but it is in and of  <br/>
schools, and based on the assumption that school is an  <br/>
inevitability.  It doesn&#39;t apply to us.<br/>
<br/>
It would be better not to talk about school at all, but when it IS  <br/>
brought up, fallacy doesn&#39;t help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426575528">You&#39;ll probably need to ease into it gradually, and as you yourself  <br/>
have real examples in your own life of natural learning, both you and  <br/>
your husband can come to understand it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book called The Unschooling Handbook that might help him  <br/>
know it&#39;s a real thing. Rushing in too fast will only give you  <br/>
something to fight about and could lead to failure, divorce, ugly  <br/>
stress, fear.<br/>
<br/>
Go steadily and easily, not all freakishly of a sudden.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t about video games, but is about a similar moment of feeling<br/>
like life needed to be more difficult.  Day before yesterday Linnaea<br/>
(5) and I were watching clips from the Mythbusters shark week on<br/>
Dicoverychannel.com (England seems to be way behind in the series) and<br/>
moved on to watching things from Shark week.  At some point Simon (8)<br/>
wandered over and snuggled on my lap in the too small chair we have in<br/>
front of the computer as we watched videos about sharks in general and<br/>
Greenland Sharks (with the renoting that Iceland is green and<br/>
Greenland is icy) and Great Whites and at some point Simon said he<br/>
wanted to be a &quot;shark handler&quot;.  He wanted to capture and raise sharks<br/>
and take them around and show them to other people to help raise<br/>
awareness about sharks.  I suggested that what he might mean is a<br/>
marine biologist.  And on the tail of saying that I could feel rising<br/>
up inside of me this desire to talk about how hard that is to become a<br/>
marine biologist.  How many years of study it takes and then how hard<br/>
it is to find a job.  And as I pushed that voice down, the doubting,<br/>
the nagging, the desire to quell his enthusiasm voice, I could hear my<br/>
own mother telling me, when I was 12 and completely enamored with Jane<br/>
Goodall and wanting oh so much to become a primatologist, that there<br/>
just aren&#39;t any jobs in primatology and that it was something outside<br/>
the bounds of realism to suppose that I could do such a thing.  And I<br/>
said to myself that he doesn&#39;t have to be a marine biologist, he can<br/>
just love sharks and we can get a fish tank and we&#39;ve got some cool<br/>
shark books around the house that I can find and put out in the next<br/>
few days or weeks and we&#39;ve been talking about setting up an aquarium<br/>
and sharks are just fish and, and, and...  All the while this was<br/>
going on in my head Linnaea was asking Simon if his wife would be<br/>
willing to stay home with the children while he was a shark handler<br/>
and Simon said he thought that his job would let him be at home quite<br/>
a bit and he asked me if I thought he could get paid for having a tank<br/>
full of sharks at home that he studied and I said I wasn&#39;t sure, and<br/>
he said it might be just a hobby.  <br/>
<br/>
It is easy to think that life must be hard.  It is easy to look at<br/>
your children playing, enjoying themselves and question how being<br/>
happy could possibly be instructive.  It isn&#39;t bad parenting to stop<br/>
yourself from saying or acting in negative ways about the things that<br/>
make your children light up with joy. It is the best kind of parenting.<br/>

<br/>
I wasn&#39;t really following this thread particularly, so I almost skipped<br/>
reading this post. Then I noticed that is was Schuyler who always has<br/>
something insightful to say, so I read it.<br/>
<br/>
When I got to this final paragraph I was so very glad that I had. What a<br/>
beautiful expression of this idea.<br/>
<br/>
I have had moments of struggle because what lights my dd with joy is<br/>
Barbie&#39;s, and the ones she loves now are getting to be the pricey ones.<br/>
There is always another Barbie to add to the collection - precisely why they<br/>
keep making ever more beautiful ones I suppose. We are now pushing close to<br/>
200 of them, including similar dolls like Disney Princesses that are<br/>
definitely a second tier of affection. Sometimes I have moments of &quot;when<br/>
will she have enough?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However I have become convinced that for Jayn and for the present, Barbie is<br/>
the conduit to all knowledge. Presently she is playing with a long elastic<br/>
cord attached doing pulley and pendulum experiments with her new Sandy (from<br/>
Grease) doll. Earlier we were happy that the dvd of Grease arrived on the<br/>
same day as the doll. We watched that and I relived some high school<br/>
memories of seeing it when it came out. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn has just learnt, from a Barbie Collector magazine, that there is an<br/>
annual convention where people make dioramas for their dolls and enter them<br/>
in competition - something she has begun doing for fun recently. Oh joy, oh<br/>
rapture, oh when is the next one and how much will it cost us? We&#39;ll have to<br/>
find a way to get to it. Gracious - it&#39;s right here in Los Angeles this year<br/>
in July! What price heaven for a little girl? Less than I feared. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238529194">thank you for your story, it has broden my perspective entirely and <br/>
makes me feel a lot more hopefull that maybe she is learning on her own.<br/>
<br/>
As far as video games, my husband and I have played Everquest, Starwars <br/>
galaxies, City of Heroes, Dungeon Seige, World of Warcraft, etc.... for <br/>
7 years,  We now only play Everquest and our daughter has her own <br/>
account of Everquest as well.  She gets so excited about the game just <br/>
like me and my husband do but I get up every 10 mins while playing to <br/>
take care of something around the house, sure I wish I could sit for an <br/>
hour without any interuption.  So when I see her play for 3 4 5 hours it <br/>
stresses me cause I wonder if its healthy for her not to be up doing <br/>
other things as well.  Maybe its my own insecurities and anxieties from <br/>
being fed lines of bull that nothing is productive unless moms are doing <br/>
5 hundred things at one time.  I am on anxiety meds for that to be <br/>
honest and have droven myself insane.  I guess I have forgotten how to <br/>
relax and enjoy life,  I feel like I am doing something bad when I am <br/>
playing instead of working and scold myself on the inside.<br/>
<br/>
Other unschoolers have told me video games and tv are fine and a couple <br/>
have said NO WAY turn off the tv for the two year old.  Limit video <br/>
games to a half hour a day.  My goodness if I did that I would go insane <br/>
of trying to keep them occupied all day.<br/>

thought.<br/>
<br/>
Interspliced with the three &quot;unschooling&quot; families, they had a <br/>
California board of ed guy or someone like that whose main criticism was <br/>
&quot;how are these kids ever going to experience lab chemistry at home or <br/>
world geography?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was just like, &quot;Huh?&quot; But he honestly and truly seemed to think that <br/>
the only way people could experience &quot;world geography&quot; was in a <br/>
classroom. I thought that was so bizarre. Lab chemistry made a certain <br/>
kind of sense at least, considering the chemicals, etc. he was <br/>
envisioning, but &quot;world geography&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids encounter &quot;social studies,&quot; &quot;world geography&quot; and &quot;world <br/>
cultures&quot; all the time in so many different ways, it just seemed so <br/>
strange that this guy couldn&#39;t fathom how such things could be <br/>
experienced outside of a classroom and textbook.<br/>

They&#39;re both notation, as taught formally.  The REAL music and math<br/>
don&#39;t have to be written down, but school can&#39;t teach and test it<br/>
without it being in writing.<br/>

What they do is based on a ton of research, but it is in and of<br/>
schools, and based on the assumption that school is an<br/>
inevitability.  It doesn&#39;t apply to us.<br/>
<br/>
It would be better not to talk about school at all, but when it IS<br/>
brought up, fallacy doesn&#39;t help.<br/>

People say &quot;life is hard&quot; to justify coercion.  They say &quot;life is  <br/>
hard&quot; as a put-down.   They say &quot;life is hard&quot; when they&#39;re overwhelmed.<br/>

Sometimes what they mean by &quot;life&quot; is something like &quot;being the best&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;being financially successful&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
Life seems pretty easy, if you just take a glance at unwanted pregnancy.<br/>
Being the very best in one&#39;s field is hard, and statistically  <br/>
unlikely.  Even getting into a field might be statistically  <br/>
unlikely.  But those things aren&#39;t the &quot;life&quot; that has quality, or  <br/>
the &quot;life&quot; that has joy.<br/>
<br/>
English strikes again, with its limitations and its halls of  <br/>
mirrors.  &quot;Life&quot; is a hard concept to hold still.  It wiggles away  <br/>
and people tell you again that it&#39;s hard.<br/>

Barbara Sher has written several self-help type books about finding the <br/>
gumption to persue the things that you love.  One of her examples is a <br/>
woman who wanted to work with gorillas, and she had assumed that this <br/>
work would be hard to get into &quot;because everyone loves gorillas so much, <br/>
there must be a lot of competition&quot;.  (My paraphrase.)  I never was into <br/>
gorillas myself, so I found her logic strange.  But her story had a <br/>
happy ending through enthusiam and networking.  I recommend the books.  <br/>
(Don&#39;t remember which story is from which book, though, as the books <br/>
re-cover some of the same territory.)<br/>

An unschooled kid has a lot of advantages meeting scientists and doing <br/>
scientific exploration and making contacts that a kid in school might <br/>
not be able to do.  One big advantage is a &quot;mom advocate&quot; (or dad or <br/>
grandparent)<br/>

Near me, Monterey aquarium in CA lets members do behind the scenes <br/>
tours, so you get to see what the scientists and helpers are doing <br/>
behind the scenes, not just in front.<br/>

I&#39;ll bet there are some &quot;shark cams&quot; (at least ones at aquariums) on the <br/>
internet that you can look at until you get your home aquarium set up.  <br/>
This may work best w. a high-speed connection.<br/>

and the rest of the time was book stuff.<br/>

point along here.  I used bleach to clean the hot tub yesterday  <br/>
(dressed specially for the occasion,  because I have forgotten and  <br/>
gotten bleach splatters on clothes I like).<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.... blathering.  But to go to school for 13 years on the off  <br/>
chance of MAYBE taking one good chemistry class isn&#39;t very efficient,  <br/>
is it?<br/>

attend *two* national Bigfoot conventions last year. <br/>
She, of course, was the only young person in a<br/>
(smallish) room of every expert in the US, UK and<br/>
Canada on the subject.  Every expert was impressed<br/>
with her knowledge and was so happy to chat with her,<br/>

which I got the feeling was rigged because they liked<br/>
her so much.  She actually was invited to volunteer at<br/>
the second one, in exchange for free admission.  Even<br/>

Decisions are hard if you&#39;re trying to decide whether to make rules  <br/>
based on what one person recommends, or rules based on what another  <br/>
says.  But if you start with deciding what you believe and what you  <br/>
want, decision making is easy.<br/>
<br/>
If I believe that my children should be assisted to do what they want  <br/>
to do, I don&#39;t have to think hard about whether to help them.  If I  <br/>
had a mind full of rules and platitudes about self-sufficiency and  <br/>
rules about how much time or money or attention a teen should get, I  <br/>
would have to worry about what others thought about what I decided.   <br/>
But I don&#39;t  I help my children because that&#39;s how our unschooling  <br/>

I think I am safe in saying whoever told you to limit tv and video games are<br/>
not true unschoolers.  Deana, you remind me of the way I used to be as far<br/>
as not really knowing how to play (and enjoy it fully).  It is hard to make<br/>
such a paradigm shift.  Mine came from how I was raised.  For gosh sakes my<br/>
mother couldn&#39;t sit at the table and enjoy a meal without jumping up and<br/>
down for everyone.  It was really embarrassing to me.  I still have to have<br/>
some sort of order in my own life but I am finding ways to do so that do not<br/>
disturb my girls.  I must admit that sometimes I just have to seclude myself<br/>
and get my mind brain flowing in the right juices again. But when I really<br/>
play with them I am reminded how much fun I am missing when I am zoned in to<br/>
accomplish 5oo other things.  This whole unschooling thing is such a<br/>
journey.  It really is as Sandra said, a family project.  I don&#39;t believe<br/>
one can unschool without being ready to really examine themselves and make<br/>
appropriate changes. As the paradigm shifts begin to happen you will feel a<br/>
sense of peace with each one.  There is no hurry up and get there.  You must<br/>
decide to be on a journey.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else has experienced this<br/>
but as we have journeyed I have found my marriage has been refreshed as<br/>
well.  Just thought I throw that out there...<br/>
<br/>
Enjoying the journey...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is in the dangerous realm of Christian sects saying they are the  <br/>
only true Christians. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a level of unschooling that involves living in the same old  <br/>
traditional ways, but not requiring schoolwork.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen families do that and then decide unschooling doesn&#39;t  <br/>
work.  I&#39;ve seen families do that, but require math lessons and  <br/>
reading lessons.<br/>
<br/>
That, to me, isn&#39;t what unschooling is all about.  It takes learning  <br/>
and &quot;education&quot; still as a subset of life.<br/>
<br/>
For our family it has worked well to consider everything to be  <br/>
educational, and then there is no &quot;education,&quot; just learning.  Lots  <br/>
of it.  Constant and deep in the fabric of life.<br/>

There&#39;s hurry up and decide, though.<br/>
Although people need to go through the steps to really understand and  <br/>
trust natural learning, there is such a thing as waiting too long to  <br/>
begin.<br/>

Better to ask questions of people who have actually tried these  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321465517">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Other unschoolers have told me video games and tv are fine and a couple<br/>
<br/>

games to a half hour a day.  My goodness if I did that I would go insane <br/>
of trying to keep them occupied all day. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
One idea expressed here that bears further consideration is the concept of<br/>
&quot;keeping them&quot; occupied. <br/>
<br/>
I have found that Jayn needs almost no help in keeping herself occupied, and<br/>
in engaging in her various passions. It is more usual that she will be<br/>
wanting me to join her in the game or activity that she has instigated. My<br/>
challenge is keeping up with her!<br/>
<br/>
The other side of this is &quot;why?&quot; - why do you feel that desire?<br/>
<br/>
You have told us that part of it is keeping one busy so that you can do the<br/>
schoolwork with the other one. <br/>
<br/>
Once you have let go of that goal or priority, much of the urgency of &quot;keep<br/>
them occupied&quot; will fade away. <br/>
<br/>
It is true that sometimes I have to put household duties and other personal<br/>
activities (like e-lists) on hold during the day, or fit those things around<br/>
what Jayn would prefer me to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Rather than hold on to the attitude that I have to &quot;find&quot; something to keep<br/>
her out of my hair, or impose something on to her, I either grab my<br/>
opportunity when she is busy with her own stuff (which happens<br/>
increasingly), or negotiate some time, or invite her to join me. It&#39;s<br/>
difficult to prevent her wanting to help in the kitchen, for example.<br/>
<br/>
It helps me personally to remember that being with her is what I have chosen<br/>
as the most important thing I have to do with my time. <br/>
<br/>
I may have other things to do, but not anything better to do.<br/>

leisure&quot; (or, in the case of a porta-pottie, &quot;being vacant&quot; &lt;g&gt;).    <br/>
No problem with some time of leisure!<br/>
