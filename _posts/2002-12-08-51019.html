<br/>
I think the reason many kids deschool with video games is multi-faceted.<br/>
First off, games have probably been limited in the past so the kids have<br/>
time to finish off all their school work OR they have been used as a carrot<br/>
to try to get kids to finish their school work.  So the kids now have total<br/>
access to something that before was limited.  No wonder they binged.  Think<br/>
back to when access to sugar was scarce.  Society ladies held &quot;sugar<br/>
parties&quot; where they just binged on sugar, the more the better.<br/>
<br/>
Second, kids are (hopefully) going from limited control of themselves to<br/>
much greater control.  In video games, you are pretty much in total control<br/>
(what &quot;universe&quot; you want to be in, what character, what you do and how long<br/>
you do it).<br/>
<br/>
Third, its just fun.  For years, us parents have been telling kids that they<br/>
need to get used to knuckling down and WORKING, like it is some terrible<br/>
thing to learn and live your life.  Kids follow the natural instinct to do<br/>
what they enjoy.  Hey, I pretty much just do what I enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, kids are checking to see if you really mean it.  Not necessarily<br/>
consciously but checking none the less.  They have been told that they are<br/>
in charge.  Does that mean that they are in charge even if they make<br/>
different decisions than you would?  Is this freedom temporary?  For some<br/>
odd reason, I never make pumpkin pie other than Thanksgiving.  Strangely,<br/>
that is also the only time that I ever eat pie and whip cream for breakfast.<br/>
It is like I know the pie is temporary and I better get it while I can.<br/>
<br/>
Fifth, the kid is not vegging out.  It only looks like it from the outside.<br/>
The amount of decision making and concentration necessary to play those<br/>
games is tremendous.<br/>
<br/>
Take heart.  My kids originally binged on television.  I have 5 kids, its<br/>
raining outside, Dad and Mom are otherwise occupied, there are 2 newly<br/>
rented movies on the counter and all the kids are playing in the garage.<br/>
<br/>
This too shall pass.<br/>

An interesting side note to this. Just now, my  recently turned 10 yo, asked me about the x and the y axis. He is playing a computer game and he had to plan moves along the x axis. I love low it just came up - and from a computer game, which he loves....Leonie W. <br/>
