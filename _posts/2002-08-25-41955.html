comment.  <br/>
<br/>
We have to live in military housing here.  It&#39;s cruddy, tiny, and<br/>
inconvienent, at 25+ minutes from post. But because so many military bases<br/>
in this area have closed, there&#39;s more housing than needed.  So the army<br/>
refuses to pay our housing allowance.  We could, concievably, live off post.<br/>
But we&#39;d have to pay it out of my husband&#39;s salary.  Not a chance.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s not enough housing and everybody wants it, then you wait to get<br/>
on post.  Last post, we chose not to live on post because we didn&#39;t feel<br/>
like moving again.  However, if you live off post, your housing allowance<br/>
generally covers about 80% of the housing & utilities costs.  On post, it&#39;s<br/>
all free.  Housing may not be great here, but we have an extra $300 a month<br/>
to work with because we are on post.  That&#39;s why most people want to live on<br/>
post if they can (and if the quarters are at least halfway decent).<br/>
<br/>
Commanders aren&#39;t *supposed* to have much control over dependents (beyond<br/>
requiring that they follow laws), but they do.  They can make the military<br/>
member&#39;s life miserable about how their dependents behave.  If the commnader<br/>
of USArmy Europe ruled that my child HAD to go to school, we&#39;d contest it.<br/>
But you can bet that my husband would be updating his resume, too.  Fighting<br/>
back can cost you your career.<br/>
