<div id="ygrps-yiv-951210099">Hi all-<br/>
I have written a few times and talked with you all about us and how we are unschooling. We are starting to have a few of those UNschooling moments. I mean that as in more than just every day learning moments. Example- the kids were playing Where on earth is Carmen Sandiego? on the puter. We were getting ready to go for a walk so they shut it down and made up their own game. They got the US atlas book out and one was Carman and the other was the one trying to find her. Sarah picked a state in the atlas and gave 3 clues to Austin to help find Carman in the book. Then Sarah went and hid something in the house while Austin was trying to figure out where Carman was in the Atlas. <br/>
They figured this all out themselves, being 6 and 8 I was impressed.<br/>
I feel so good right now, as I have witnessed a VERY reassuring moment that shows me how well they are doing. I had to share!<br/>
God bless<br/>
