I was interested in starting a homeschool Camp Fire<br/>
group and had a great turnout at our &quot;organizational&quot;<br/>
meeting last May.  The Camp Fire director for our area<br/>
attended and was enthusiastic about our group getting<br/>
started as she homeschooled her daughter for many<br/>
years.  <br/>
<br/>
You did a lot more research than I did and since our<br/>
group decided NOT to pursue it, I stopped looking. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;...As a passionate Unschooler/Natural Learner how<br/>
many ways can I say ick?  Curricula?  Grade levels? <br/>
Outcome based? Am I just looking at this the wrong way<br/>
or not understanding what they are trying to say?<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in the pages I received, it says &quot;When<br/>
children and youth join Camp Fire, they start at the<br/>
level appropriate to their grade.&quot;    Is this program<br/>
totally geared toward the institutional schooling<br/>
system, and would we be totally out of place?  I don&#39;t<br/>
really want to separate my children out into narrow<br/>
band age groups.  I don&#39;t think it is socially good<br/>
for them.  I am one of those who is of the opinion<br/>
that institutional schooling is intrinsically bad for<br/>
the human mind and spirit, and that the institutional<br/>
educational model can never be made healthy enough to<br/>
be effective or positive.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am pretty relaxed about their &quot;developmental<br/>
assets&quot; and so forth.  If it was me, I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
quantifying how many hours of community service or<br/>
nights out with friends, but I wouldn&#39;t be too worried<br/>
about it either.  <br/>
<br/>
Camp Fire is mostly geared to school children, but<br/>
they have also started a program called Family Clubs. <br/>
This is designed to specifically include moms AND dads<br/>
as well as kids of all ages.  Seems tailor made for<br/>
homeschoolers.  I understand that some areas require<br/>
leaders to attend training & if you can&#39;t attend, or<br/>
aren&#39;t near a Camp Fire office, you can&#39;t officially<br/>
start a club.  However, our director, Bev Field, has<br/>
offered to help other homeschoolers get a Family Club<br/>
started where ever they are.  (Let me know if you are<br/>
interested in her contact info).  <br/>
<br/>
Our major problem with Camp Fire was selling candy<br/>
bars.  In forming a club, we were agreeing to<br/>
participate in 2 major fundraisers a year.  One was a<br/>
walk-a-thon type event where we had to send letters to<br/>
20 people asking for sponsorship.  We had to submit<br/>
the letters to the Camp Fire office and they would<br/>
check and make sure we had the right number of letters<br/>
(!) and then mail them for us.  The other was candy<br/>
bar sales.  Each person would be required (?) to sell<br/>
an ungodly # of candy bars, like 200.  The money<br/>
raised went to support the area Camp Fire office.  We<br/>
had no problem with supporting the office, but we<br/>
weren&#39;t allowed to come up with some other way to<br/>
raise money or even just make a monetary donation<br/>
INSTEAD of selling candy.  (We were told we could send<br/>
letters to area businesses & maybe get a corporate<br/>
sponsor who might want to buy hundreds of candy bars<br/>
to give their employees & to support Camp Fire).  We<br/>
were also told there was no real consequence if you<br/>
didn&#39;t sell your allotted number.  Ok, so that was the<br/>
major disagreement.  A few people had kids who wanted<br/>
either girls-only or boys-only club and wanted to try<br/>
scouts.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband had another concern, which you didn&#39;t<br/>
mention, and which I felt unsure about and that is<br/>
their system for beads & badges.  He felt it was<br/>
rewarding them for completing specific projects so<br/>
that the kids wouldn&#39;t be participating for the<br/>
intrinsic value but to &quot;get&quot; the next bead or patch,<br/>
etc.   Another friend said it wasn&#39;t about rewards,<br/>
but just a sign of their accomplishment.  Any comments<br/>
to share?<br/>
<br/>
What happened for us was that we discussed forming our<br/>
own club and then from one of my many email lists<br/>
-maybe it was this one- someone mentioned &quot;roots &<br/>
shoots&quot;.  I had another organizational meeting in<br/>
September and we started a Roots & Shoots club.  It is<br/>
a program designed by the Jane Goodall Institute. <br/>
Here is the website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/index.html">http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/index.html</a>  We meet 1st<br/>
& 3rd Fridays 10 - noon.   We invite all ages, boys &<br/>
girls & their parents.  We rotate leadership among the<br/>
parents and the first event was a bug party learning<br/>
about desert bugs including a bug scavenger hunt & bug<br/>
&quot;show & tell&quot; and the second event was a field trip to<br/>
the AZ-Sonoran Desert Museum (thanks, Dawn!).  We have<br/>
some kinks to work out as our group has grown so large<br/>
so quickly.  We&#39;ve kinda outgrown meeting at homes.  I<br/>
just received the official Roots & Shoots manual last<br/>
week and it has a lot of interesting information that<br/>
I still need to digest.<br/>
