<div id="ygrps-yiv-810982886">Linda Dobson&#39;s &quot;Art of Education&quot; is terrific. It will stretch you in new<br/>
ways, as she is clear that real education is far different from the<br/>
&quot;conditioning&quot; that takes place under the same name in schools.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also highly recommend Nancy Wallace&#39;s &quot;Child&#39;s Work: Taking Children&#39;s<br/>
Choices Seriously&quot;.  I know of no book (including my own) which is more<br/>
respectful of the knowledge quests of children. (you can read more about it<br/>
on my website - www.skylarksings.com)<br/>
<br/>
2 1/2 is a great age to begin thinking clearly about what kind of education<br/>
you want for your child.  That way, you don&#39;t immediately get caught in the<br/>
rut of thinking that &quot;education&quot; begins with kindergarten, or that somehow<br/>
education is somehow different from helping your son fulfill his life&#39;s<br/>
path.  For regardless of what the future may hold, learning is a &quot;quality of<br/>
life&quot; issue both for your son and your family in the here and now.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on choosing a direction!<br/>
<br/>

&quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot; is to homeschooling what Tom Paine&#39;s &quot;Common<br/>
Sense&quot; was to the American Revolution.&quot;-Greg Bates. To read a sample chapter<br/>

&gt; Hi, all.  I am new to the list and new to the idea of unschooling.  My<br/>
&gt; son is just 2-1/2 and my husb. and I just recently realized that<br/>
&gt; unschooling is what we want for his &quot;education.&quot;  It was such a<br/>
&gt; &quot;lightbulb moment&quot; (as Oprah would say!) when I realized what this would<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; mean for our son, our home life, our careers, and it just feels so<br/>
&gt; right.  I was never interested in homeschooling, i.e. following a school<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; curriculum at home, but when I started thinking about unschooling I<br/>
&gt; realized that was really the alternative to education that I was looking<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; for, but unable to articulate.<br/>
