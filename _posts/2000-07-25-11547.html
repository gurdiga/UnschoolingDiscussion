<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884259548">This is real folks, not an urban legend and it is good ol&#39; Monsanto at it<br/>
again!  And, it is just this sort of thing that is responsible for the<br/>
mad-cow disease in Europe (they ground up sheep carcasses to add protein to<br/>
the cow feed and the virus jumped the species barrier).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; For Immediate Release:  July 19, 20000<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can a deadly spider replace chemical pesticides?  Could this be a<br/>
&gt; threat to human livers and human health?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Viruses given a gene for a toxin from one of the world&#39;s deadliest<br/>
&gt; spiders could replace chemical pesticides, say researchers in the  US.<br/>
&gt; They plan to carry out field trials, although there are fears about<br/>
&gt; the wisdom of releasing such viruses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Glenn King of the University of Connecticut Health Center in<br/>
&gt; Farmington and his colleagues recently identified a unique family of<br/>
&gt; toxins in the venom of a funnel-web spider. These neurotoxins are<br/>
&gt; lethal when injected into insect tissues, yet have no effect if eaten<br/>
&gt; by insects or other animals (Nature Structural Biology, vol 7, p 505).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; King&#39;s team is now engineering the gene for one of these toxins into<br/>
&gt; baculoviruses, common viruses that infect certain moths and<br/>
&gt; butterflies, and have long been used as &quot;biopesticides.&quot; When the<br/>
&gt; modified baculovirus infects a butterfly or moth, the insect&#39;s cells<br/>
&gt; should start to produce the toxin, killing it faster than wild<br/>
&gt; viruses. Because the host butterfly or moth) dies quickly, before much<br/>
&gt; virus can replicate, the modified virus shouldn&#39;t persist in the<br/>
&gt; environment, say the researchers.  Critics contend that the risk to<br/>
&gt; butterfly and human populations and survival is not worth taking<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I welcome a potentially environmentally friendly pest control but<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s abundantly clear we need to be more firm about risk issues,&quot;<br/>
&gt; comments George McGavin, an entomologist at Oxford University. &quot;If we<br/>
&gt; are not 100 per cent sure, it shouldn&#39;t be in the field.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There have already been several field trials worldwide of<br/>
&gt; baculoviruses given a gene for a scorpion toxin (New Scientist, 21<br/>
&gt; January 1995, p 6). However, most of the scorpion toxin made in<br/>
&gt; infected insects fails to fold into the correct shape, says King. By<br/>
&gt; contrast, tests in bacteria suggest that almost 100 per cent of the<br/>
&gt; spider toxin should fold properly, making the virus deadlier.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; King thinks engineering toxin genes into viruses is preferable to<br/>
&gt; adding them to plants, such as Bt maize. Not only does it mean that<br/>
&gt; people do not have to eat plants that produce insecticidal toxins, but<br/>
&gt; only target insects will be affected, he says. &quot;These viruses can be<br/>
&gt; exquisitely specific, right down to infecting individual species,&quot;<br/>
&gt; King claims.  &quot;This means that only the pest insects will be killed<br/>
&gt; whilst beneficial insects such as bees remain unaffected.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, critics fear that the virus will spread into the environment<br/>
&gt; and affect other kinds of butterflies and moths.  &quot;A containment<br/>
&gt; environment could not possibly hold a virus,&quot; says McGavin, who<br/>
&gt; opposed trials of a scorpion toxin virus in Oxfordshire in the 1990s.<br/>
&gt; &quot;If you could get a specific baculovirus it would be great, but<br/>
&gt; baculoviruses do pass on {to other species}.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;This is problem that really concerns us,&quot; said Alan Moore of the<br/>
&gt; Butterfly Gardeners Association, a local group that advocates for the<br/>
&gt; conservation of butterflies and their habits.  This is at least the<br/>
&gt; third time that Genetically Modified Organisms, GMOs have been<br/>
&gt; targeted against butterflies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bt-corn has genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis spliced<br/>
&gt; into the plant genes and its toxin is carried by wind-driven pollen to<br/>
&gt; the leaves of milkweed where they can poison monarch caterpillars<br/>
&gt; feeding on milkweed.  &quot;I think this clearly shows transgenic corn<br/>
&gt; could be a serious threat to monarchs,&quot; said Rebecca Goldburg, a<br/>
&gt; senior scientist with the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund in<br/>
&gt; a story published by the San Francisco Chronicle about Bt-corn . &quot;I<br/>
&gt; doubt if it would push them over the edge by itself, but it adds<br/>
&gt; substantially to the other risks they face.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Moore makes the point that the industry states that Bt-corn alone<br/>
&gt; could not push monarchs and other butterflies over the edge, but a<br/>
&gt; combination of other Monsanto and industry innovations just might.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Now we have Roundup ready crops and spider poison enhanced butterfly<br/>
&gt; pathogens to deal with. Roundup ready crops are a direct threat in<br/>
&gt; that they target milkweed, the monarch&#39;s host plant, as well as a<br/>
&gt; whole spectrum of annual and perennial weeds for elimination.  Many of<br/>
&gt; these weeds are host plants for other butterflies as well,&quot; says Moore<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are also fears that the toxin gene might be transferred to other<br/>
&gt; viruses. &quot;There is no instance of a toxin gene jumping from virus A to<br/>
&gt; virus B,&quot; says Bruce Hammock of the University of California, Davis,<br/>
&gt; who is also working on modified baculoviruses. &quot;But if it jumped, the<br/>
&gt; new virus would become less effective.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jenny Cory of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Oxford agrees<br/>
&gt; transfer of the toxin gene is unlikely, but thinks further tests would<br/>
&gt; be helpful. &quot;It&#39;s a vicious circle,&quot; she says, &quot;you have to do a risk<br/>
&gt; assessment before you do the experiment but we don&#39;t know all the<br/>
&gt; risks without doing field experiments in the first place.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &quot;Soon after GM virus were developed for insect control it was found<br/>
&gt; that baculovirus were capable of infecting human liver cells,&quot; says<br/>
&gt; Joe Cummins, Prof. Emeritus at the University of Western Ontario.<br/>
&gt; &quot;For that reason baculovirus vectors were developed to treat liver<br/>
&gt; disease. Interestingly, the fact that baculovirus can infect human<br/>
&gt; liver cells seems to have been ignored by those developing the virus<br/>
&gt; for commercial pest control. The following discussion will deal with<br/>
&gt; the use of baculovirus vectors and their safety. I understand that<br/>
&gt; there has been a great deal of pressure to hasten approval of the GM<br/>
&gt; baculovirus for pest control.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Ecological considerations for the impact of recombinant baculovirus<br/>
&gt; insecticides have been studied extensively. Impact on non-target<br/>
&gt; insects is extrapolated from insects of related phylogeny, a practice<br/>
&gt; difficult to defend. The recombinant baculovirus were very persistent<br/>
&gt; and capable of reshaping an ecosystem.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Baculovirus is a circular DNA duplex, it replicates in the insect<br/>
&gt; cell nucleus and replication is prone to the generation of defective<br/>
&gt; genomes by deletion. The mode of virus replication seems to make the<br/>
&gt; recombinant virus highly unpredictable and prone to generating<br/>
&gt; potentially undesirable variants. This important finding has not yet<br/>
&gt; influenced the risk analysis of recombinant baculovirus insecticides<br/>
&gt; and gene therapy vectors.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;The most disconcerting finding is the one showing that replication of<br/>
&gt; the baculovirus is inherently unpredictable, says Cummins. &quot;There may<br/>
&gt; be some who believe that we should all have unlabelled liver gene<br/>
&gt; therapy with our salads.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;We need to educate the American consumer on the threats of GMOs to<br/>
&gt; human health and butterflies, says Moore.  That is why we have joined<br/>
&gt; Bay Area Rage, Global Exchange, the Bay Area Seed Interchange Library,<br/>
&gt; the Berkeley Ecology Center, and the Organic Consumers Association in<br/>
&gt; bringing this issue before the public.  That is why we are here today<br/>
&gt; at this Market Street Safeway in San Francisco.&quot;<br/>
