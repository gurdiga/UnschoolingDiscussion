<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049306646">I&#39;m wondering, is it possible to help a child prepare for college or even some standardized test they may have to take in regards to formal writing in an unschooling way.  I know that I didn&#39;t really learn to write a good &quot;paper&quot; until I went to college.  I spent much of high school in the parking lot or at the beach myself.  So, I really learned it in Freshman Communications class.  It was a big awakening that I had &quot;somehow&quot; missed what most other students knew.  If you realize your child is college bound, how can you help them learn formal writing, so they don&#39;t go into it not knowing how to follow a scripted planned paper.  Which is what most profs are looking for.  I am new to unschooling, but am learning so much from this group.  This question came up with a friend the other day and I wasn&#39;t sure of the answer myself.  How do you help them prepare for formal instruction in general?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Part of it is trust that formal instruction is just a formal version of what<br/>
they&#39;re learning by living life.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to learn to write is to have a real reason to write. Email,<br/>
IMs, message boards, letters to companies, newspaper editors, friends and<br/>
fan mail, lists, notes, stories, Amazon reviews, video game walkthroughs.<br/>
<br/>
The whole point of writing is because you want to give someone information<br/>
in writing that they want or need. Assigned writing is missing the vital<br/>
components of wanting to give and wanting to receive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It was a big awakening that I had &quot;somehow&quot; missed what most other students<br/>
&gt; knew.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bet not. Part of the reality of school is learning to fake it. You don&#39;t<br/>
need to know something. You just need to know what the teacher wants to see.<br/>
I&#39;m betting from the professor&#39;s point of view that the papers were<br/>
generally lousy. Two common complaints from college professors is that kids<br/>
can&#39;t write and kids can&#39;t do math. And that&#39;s because it&#39;s hard to learn<br/>
something if you aren&#39;t doing it for real reasons.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling kids use tools to get what they want. Learning happens as a<br/>
side effect. Kids don&#39;t get better at English because it&#39;s useful. They use<br/>
English because even used imperfectly and little understanding it works<br/>
better than crying. They aren&#39;t trying to get better at the tool of English.<br/>
They&#39;re trying to get what they want better. Getting better at English<br/>
happens as a side effect of using it to get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
A side effect of passing on information in IMs and emails is that kids get<br/>
better at writing. That&#39;s because whoever they&#39;re writing to wants or needs<br/>
to understand what they&#39;re saying. And the reader will give feed back --<br/>
&quot;Huh? What&#39;s that mean?&quot; -- that helps the writer figure out better how to<br/>
make words say what they what they mean. And as a side effect of wanting to<br/>
get someone to understand, they get better at writing.<br/>
<br/>
If kids have real opportunities to do real writing, then formal writing<br/>
instruction is just a way of gathering up everything they already know and<br/>
organizing it.<br/>
<br/>
In school, it&#39;s the opposite. Kids are trying to figure out abstractions<br/>
about something they don&#39;t understand while trying to figure out how to put<br/>
it into practice, without having real reasons to apply the knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, writing a story is way more important than a book report.<br/>
Taking a class *that interests them* that happens to require writing is way<br/>
more important than taking a class the requires writing as a way to learn<br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
When they get to college age you can talk about skills that will be useful.<br/>
It&#39;s lots easier for kids to take some community college courses in subjects<br/>
for fun than to go cold into college. That way they can get a feel for what<br/>
they need to know and skills they might like to work on before they make a<br/>
bigger committement to full time college.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t focus on the tools so much as what the tools are being used for.<br/>
Learning tool use is a side effect of doing things for real.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190441996">I have an interesting story about this.  I haven&#39;t &#39;taught&#39; my kids formal<br/>
writing. But they have always written, letters, stories, poems, lists,<br/>
whatever was needed, some more than others.  My oldest two were in a<br/>
homeschool newspaper club because they liked to write and see it printed.<br/>
Usually they did poems or stories, not article&#39;s or informational pieces.<br/>
But my oldest was interested in the concept of co-dependency and chose to do<br/>
some research and write a two part article for the newspaper. She asked for<br/>
some help, but just out of common sense, she had footnotes, an intro, middle<br/>
and conclusion, and it was well done. Could have easily been turned in for<br/>
some kind of class. She did it because she wanted to, because she thought<br/>
there were kids her age who needed the information and this was the way to<br/>
do it. She was never taught how to do this. But this is what made sense to<br/>
her. Writing of any kind isn&#39;t a mystery that needs to be taught, it really<br/>
is mostly common sense I think.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Laura Johnson&quot; &lt;lauraj2@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>

<br/>
A resounding &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I know that I didn&#39;t really learn to write a good &quot;paper&quot; until I went to college.  I spent <br/>
much of high school in the parking lot or at the beach myself.  So, I really learned it in <br/>
Freshman Communications class.  It was a big awakening that I had &quot;somehow&quot; missed <br/>
what most other students knew.  If you realize your child is college bound, how can you <br/>
help them learn formal writing, so they don&#39;t go into it not knowing how to follow a <br/>
scripted planned paper.  Which is what most profs are looking for.  I am new to <br/>
unschooling, but am learning so much from this group.  This question came up with a <br/>
friend the other day and I wasn&#39;t sure of the answer myself.  How do you help them <br/>
prepare for formal instruction in general?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not difficult to teach writing formats to anyone who is interested and comfortable <br/>
expressing him/herself in writing. If your kids use live journals, spend time emailing or <br/>
posting on email lists that relate to their interests, they are already doing the kind of <br/>
writing that will prepare them for timed essay writing (such as the SAT in 2005 and ACTin <br/>
2006).<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are college-bound (by choice) will want to prepare. They can take courses online <br/>
(I happen to teach several) or they can use books to prepare. One little book taht I really <br/>
like is called &quot;Daily Writing Warm-ups.&quot; It happens to be in the format that will likely <br/>
characterize the SAT tests. There are quotes from famous people that catalyze a response.<br/>
<br/>
The student&#39;s job is to write about the quote in a way that shows organization and <br/>
personal flair.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who read a lot, talk to adults often and who are comfortable expressing themselves in <br/>
writing are already far ahead of the average school child and even homeschooled child <br/>
who hates writing. If you have a child who doesn&#39;t write (for pleasure or even due to <br/>
necessity), then you want to ask your child for his goals and what he is really interested in. <br/>
Writing instruction can be a real joy (my online classes are so popular with high school <br/>
students because they have the opportunity to write for each other and to really sink their <br/>
teeth into the writing process in a supportive, conversational, competent atmosphere.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problem is that the entrance exams for college are now including essay writing and <br/>
they will be looking for a certain format. The format doesn&#39;t have to be rigid, but the <br/>
characteristics they will look for (in addition to spelling, grammar and punctuation) are <br/>
things like use of transitions, organized points, a thesis and a satisfying conclusion.<br/>

<br/>
Two common complaints from college professors is that kids<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can&#39;t write and kids can&#39;t do math. And that&#39;s because it&#39;s hard to learn<br/>

classes is an inability to think. Most students think they need to find someone else&#39;s <br/>
thoughts to hijack into their writing. They haven&#39;t discovered how to interact directly with <br/>
material themselves.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If kids have real opportunities to do real writing, then formal writing<br/>
&gt; instruction is just a way of gathering up everything they already know and<br/>
&gt; organizing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s right. Read the books by the pros, not by the educators. The pros get it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; When they get to college age you can talk about skills that will be useful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say, as they get ready for college applications, they can talk about how to tackle that <br/>
test. The rest is taught in college and taught better than most homeschools or high <br/>
schools can anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Or they can take online courses where the writing is based on personal interests, skills and <br/>
areas of personal expertise.<br/>
<br/>
Timed writing is a bit different than writng an essay over a month period. It requires a <br/>
unique set of skills. But don&#39;t worry. No high schooler is taught timed writing either. It&#39;s a <br/>
gaping hole in education.<br/>
<br/>
The best preparation for timed writing is &quot;freewriting&quot; which is just writing about the topic <br/>
at hand without interruption for a specified amount of time. Peter Elbow (Writing with <br/>
Power and Writing without Teachers) has some terrific chapters about writing &quot;in the <br/>
system&quot; and how to use freewriting.<br/>
<br/>
I do teach an online course called Timed Essay Writing in the spring for those interested. <br/>
But I agree with Joyce here. There is so much learning about writing happening in <br/>
unchooled kids just by virtue of the lives they already lead (reading, talking and writing <br/>
online). they are way ahead. The unschooled kids I&#39;ve taught are a breath of fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve included a link to a page on my website about freewriting.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Florida is taking care of that.  So much of the 3rd and 4th grade is spent on preparing for Florida Writes testing.  When I taught first grade, I was expected to teach the kids by the end of the year how to write a formal paragraph about a topic with a topic sentence, three supporting details and a concluding sentence.  They start timed writing in second grade with full five paragraph essays on assigned topics.  I haven&#39;t taught in 5 years, so I&#39;m sure they are now pushing that in preschool now.  <br/>
<br/>
  My son is only 5, so it isn&#39;t a real issue at this point or anytime soon for us.  I was just wondering as a discussion point with some friends and with dh who is concerned already about his college education, hello, he&#39;s five!!<br/>
  He has him mentally signed up for Harvard.  UGH, It&#39;s a process and a journey, right???  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve helped a few unschooled kids learn to put together a 5-paragraph <br/>
essay. This was because they wanted to take the CHSPE - California High <br/>
School Proficiency Exam. Passing this exam gives them a high school <br/>
diploma from the State of California. It isn&#39;t necessary for <br/>
homeschoolers in California to do this - one of my kids did it and the <br/>
next doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s going to do it - but it is one way to be able <br/>
to say you&#39;ve &quot;graduated&quot; and that gets them out of having to go to the <br/>
local high school and get a work permit and it also gives them <br/>
unlimited access to the community college.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I&#39;ve taught several kids how to write an essay. It probably <br/>
took about 30 minutes for them to listen to me describe what it would <br/>
look like, read a couple of examples, and write a couple of quick ones <br/>
of their own. Certainly took less than an hour for that whole process.<br/>
<br/>
I AM a college professor, by the way, and I don&#39;t see many incoming <br/>
freshmen who know much about writing. If I want any particular format, <br/>
I explain it to them myself.<br/>
<br/>
One of my daughters took a History of Opera class - that was the first <br/>
time she was expected to write anything for a class - never wrote an <br/>
essay before in her life for any kind of class. I told her to just <br/>
write an opening paragraph and a closing paragraph and in between write <br/>
what she wanted to write about the subject and then divide that up into <br/>
paragraphs to make it easier to follow. She got an A.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to write an essay in English Comp class as a college freshman <br/>
isn&#39;t a bad time to learn, either, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just in time learning&quot; is great. Learning when there is an obvious <br/>
reason to learn is far more effective than just generally being <br/>
prepared for some nebulous thing like &quot;going to college&quot; which is <br/>
someday, maybe, in the future.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035513334">Great post and ITA. :) I always say to moms who are nervous that they can learn the essay <br/>
format in fifteen minutes. Teaching it takes a half an hour. <br/>
<br/>
Writing it can take longer so that the ideas have time to germinate and then the revision <br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
At my seminars and at conferences, I often take a quick hand count to find out who <br/>
remembers learning how to write a five paragraph essay. In a room of one hundred adults, <br/>
I usually don&#39;t see more than five hands go up.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is currently taking honor&#39;s English at the high school (horrid program) and <br/>
they expect essays but never teach them how to write them. Disgutsing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This question came up with a friend the other day and I wasn&#39;t sure of <br/>
&gt; &gt; the answer myself.  How do you help them prepare for formal <br/>
&gt; &gt; instruction in general?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve helped a few unschooled kids learn to put together a 5-paragraph <br/>
&gt; essay. This was because they wanted to take the CHSPE - California High <br/>
&gt; School Proficiency Exam. Passing this exam gives them a high school <br/>
&gt; diploma from the State of California. It isn&#39;t necessary for <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers in California to do this - one of my kids did it and the <br/>
&gt; next doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s going to do it - but it is one way to be able <br/>
&gt; to say you&#39;ve &quot;graduated&quot; and that gets them out of having to go to the <br/>
&gt; local high school and get a work permit and it also gives them <br/>
&gt; unlimited access to the community college.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway - I&#39;ve taught several kids how to write an essay. It probably <br/>
&gt; took about 30 minutes for them to listen to me describe what it would <br/>
&gt; look like, read a couple of examples, and write a couple of quick ones <br/>
&gt; of their own. Certainly took less than an hour for that whole process.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I AM a college professor, by the way, and I don&#39;t see many incoming <br/>
&gt; freshmen who know much about writing. If I want any particular format, <br/>
&gt; I explain it to them myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of my daughters took a History of Opera class - that was the first <br/>
&gt; time she was expected to write anything for a class - never wrote an <br/>
&gt; essay before in her life for any kind of class. I told her to just <br/>
&gt; write an opening paragraph and a closing paragraph and in between write <br/>
&gt; what she wanted to write about the subject and then divide that up into <br/>
&gt; paragraphs to make it easier to follow. She got an A.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Learning to write an essay in English Comp class as a college freshman <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t a bad time to learn, either, in my opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Just in time learning&quot; is great. Learning when there is an obvious <br/>
&gt; reason to learn is far more effective than just generally being <br/>
&gt; prepared for some nebulous thing like &quot;going to college&quot; which is <br/>
&gt; someday, maybe, in the future.<br/>

school. We did all sorts of grueling exercises that I looked back <br/>
on, even as early as a few months after graduation, and realized how <br/>
useful the tools we had developed in that class turned out to be for <br/>
college type stuff. We did timed writing - we&#39;d show up in class, <br/>
put away everything except 2 sheets of paper and a pen, he&#39;d write a <br/>
sentence or question on the board and we had 15 minutes to rough <br/>
draft and final draft a 5 paragraph essay on the topic sentence or <br/>
question, referencing materials we had read in class and elsewhere. <br/>
Phew those were rough - but then when I had 90 minutes to write an <br/>
essay for the placement exams at college (the day after I got back <br/>
from 10 days in Spain. Can you say &quot;jet lag&quot;? lol) I finished in <br/>
under 30 minutes, leisurely, and went out to catch up with my folks <br/>
who were touring around the campus. We also did precis writing - <br/>
turning 5 paragraphs into 5 to 10 sentences without losing the sense <br/>
of the essay. That usually took a series of rewrites, each shorter <br/>
than the last (in half, half, half again ...). You&#39;d never know it <br/>
by my posts (lol) but I got really good at that. I found it a unique <br/>
challenge, like a jigsaw puzzle, to craft a paragraph or so that <br/>
conveyed an essay&#39;s worth of information. <br/>
<br/>
That stuff actually did serve me in good stead in my first job - <br/>
working for a newsletter in a niche computer industry market, <br/>
abstracting articles and press releases for the boss to use in his <br/>
articles and later as a bylined writer in my own right. Much more <br/>
useful than anything else from high school or college. The rest was <br/>
mostly fluff and nonsense.</div>

<br/>
They do in Australia, or at least they did 25 years ago when I sat for the<br/>
Higher School Certificate - both the equivalent of the High School Diploma<br/>
and the State wide matriculation/college admission exam. It was *all* timed<br/>
essays in all the liberal arts subjects, and the math was all problems that<br/>
required a couple of pages to write all the steps to solve. I loved taking<br/>
exams. We spent a lot of time doing practice exams also. <br/>
<br/>
I was astonished when I came here to see the SAT and other standardized<br/>
tests were all multiple choice - it seems so absurd and ridiculous. That<br/>
kind of test had been phased out as I went through high school in the 70&#39;s<br/>
in Australia.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot more now about unschooling and am now anti-testing at all, but<br/>
when I was first looking askance at the education system here, when Jayn was<br/>
a baby, this kind of daft testing was one of things that led me to<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>

In school we wrote notes to each other, quick, tiny, and passed <br/>
surreptitiously.<br/>

There&#39;s computerese (which I&#39;m convinced will be studied as a language in about thirty <br/>
years and thereby deemed &quot;real&quot;) and then there&#39;s standard English.<br/>
<br/>
I tell my students to use standard English for final products that will be enjoyed in print or <br/>
are meant to outlast the rapid fire pace of IM and email. But for interacting with each other <br/>
or me with quick questions, their computerese is perfectly acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s cool is that kids can go back and forth between the two a lot more easily than many <br/>
mothers fear. Some can&#39;t but that&#39;s usually because they aren&#39;t readers.<br/>
<br/>
And one last little thought (I was thinking about this earlier)...<br/>
<br/>
Taking a writing course can be every bit as invigorating as art or music lessons. The <br/>
trouble is that there are so many bad writing courses/programs out there. If you or your <br/>
children have the opportunity to grow as writers with the support and guidance of a <br/>
professional writer, the experience is invigorating and energizing, not tedious and <br/>
scholastic.<br/>
<br/>
Writing is not just a means of self-expression, but an art form that has both inspiration <br/>
and craft elements.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m wondering, is it possible to help a child prepare for college or even <br/>
some standardized test they may have to take in regards to formal writing in <br/>
an unschooling way.  I know that I didn&#39;t really learn to write a good &quot;paper&quot; <br/>
until I went to college.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and I had a session on commas yesterday.   He&#39;s planning to take the <br/>
GED in the next few months, and he had written me an e-mail several paragraphs <br/>
long in which I noted he wasn&#39;t using any commas.   He did seem to know where <br/>
commas should be, though, because he would capitalize the word following each <br/>
needed comma.  Good start!<br/>
<br/>
That was a few weeks back, and I started a little collection on the computer <br/>
of good examples of comma use, ambiguous sentences where a comma would clear <br/>
things up, and a few bad examples.  I folded down a page in Nicholas Nickleby <br/>
but forgot to show him that.<br/>
<br/>
We went through those collected examples and he knew every time what would <br/>
make the sentence better.   So it was maybe a fifteen minute &quot;lesson,&quot; when he <br/>
asked for help, and it&#39;s done.  It was a polish job on something he already <br/>
instinctively understood, and I was able to say things people just don&#39;t bother <br/>
to say to nine or ten year olds who are memorizing rules about how to use <br/>
commas in series, or how to use commas to combine two short sentences.   I didn&#39;t <br/>
talk about clauses, either.    I said they&#39;re indicators to show vocal <br/>
inflection, and if he considered the comma as a change of tone, it would make the <br/>
sentence easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
In the heyday of English grammar, the late 19th century and early 20th, I <br/>
don&#39;t think many formal grammarians would have agreed with me.  There was a time <br/>
in there when written English was almost a separate language, with its own <br/>
rules, and the way to understand written English was to diagram sentences and <br/>
conjugate verbs.   Then people tried to speak as though they were reading from a <br/>
book, to seem &quot;cultured.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is living in the 21st century, not the 19th.  I started school in the <br/>
1950&#39;s, when the books were written and some of the classes still taught by <br/>
people who were born in the 19th century, and it sometimes seemed the brakes were <br/>
on for education NOT to change in any way, but if anything to go back to 19th <br/>
century values.<br/>
<br/>
The 60&#39;s wreaked some havoc on that (I was in public school from 1958 to <br/>
1970, only going for 11 years to some friends&#39; thirteen), and writing spoken <br/>
English down became much more accepted.<br/>
<br/>
Mark Twain had written that way, and many other authors, but they were <br/>
considered exceptions to the way writing really should be, by some.<br/>
<br/>
So in an essay for a GED,  I think Kirby would do well to use his own voice <br/>
instead of a stilted &quot;formal writing&quot; voice.    My mother-in-law and even my <br/>
husband will write letters in a voice that&#39;s not their own at all.  <br/>
<br/>
When children just know instinctively whether something is wrong or right, in <br/>
their own native language, that has a name:  native speaker&#39;s intuition.    <br/>
Because Kirby has read English too, now, for nine or ten years, he has a native <br/>
reader&#39;s intuition, as it were, about punctuation.  All it needs is a little <br/>
touch-up and practice for him to turn around and write back.   <br/>
<br/>
He has been writing e-mails and instant messages for some time, but IMs have <br/>
their own rules, and that&#39;s fine.  There was a time when lots of people could <br/>
read, understand, and maybe immitate the language of telegraphed messages, <br/>
where people were paying by the letter.  There times I&#39;ve seen the abbreviations <br/>
of singles ads used in other contexts.<br/>
Z**   Those who don&#39;t ever look in the backs of those newspapers aimed at <br/>
young adults might not get them at all, but they might understand similar <br/>
shorthand in real estate ads.   All those are real too, but not formal full-on, <br/>
whole-word English.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If you realize your child is college bound, how can you help them learn <br/>
formal writing, so they don&#39;t go into it not knowing how to follow a scripted <br/>
planned paper. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Offer to help by e-mail if your teen needs help away from home.   <br/>
Suggest internet sites on essay writing.  <br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s really, truly not necessary to practice beforehand on something like <br/>
writing an essay.   If the professor gives an outline/script, then the <br/>
student follows it.   If he just says &quot;essay&quot; and that word is new to the student, <br/>
google.com is right at hand.<br/>

<br/>
That was a few weeks back, and I started a little collection on the computer <br/>
of good examples of comma use, ambiguous sentences where a comma would clear <br/>
things up, and a few bad examples.  I folded down a page in Nicholas Nickleby <br/>
but forgot to show him that.<br/>
<br/>
We went through those collected examples and he knew every time what would <br/>
make the sentence better.   So it was maybe a fifteen minute &quot;lesson,&quot; when he <br/>
asked for help, and it&#39;s done.  It was a polish job on something he already <br/>
instinctively understood, and I was able to say things people just don&#39;t bother <br/>
to say to nine or ten year olds who are memorizing rules about how to use <br/>
commas in series, or how to use commas to combine two short sentences.   I didn&#39;t <br/>
talk about clauses, either.    I said they&#39;re indicators to show vocal <br/>
inflection, and if he considered the comma as a change of tone, it would make the <br/>
sentence easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
In the heyday of English grammar, the late 19th century and early 20th, I <br/>
don&#39;t think many formal grammarians would have agreed with me.  There was a time <br/>
in there when written English was almost a separate language, with its own <br/>
rules, and the way to understand written English was to diagram sentences and <br/>
conjugate verbs.   Then people tried to speak as though they were reading from a <br/>
book, to seem &quot;cultured.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is living in the 21st century, not the 19th.  I started school in the <br/>
1950&#39;s, when the books were written and some of the classes still taught by <br/>
people who were born in the 19th century, and it sometimes seemed the brakes were <br/>
on for education NOT to change in any way, but if anything to go back to 19th <br/>
century values.<br/>
<br/>
The 60&#39;s wreaked some havoc on that (I was in public school from 1958 to <br/>
1970, only going for 11 years to some friends&#39; thirteen), and writing spoken <br/>
English down became much more accepted.<br/>
<br/>
Mark Twain had written that way, and many other authors, but they were <br/>
considered exceptions to the way writing really should be, by some.<br/>
<br/>
So in an essay for a GED,  I think Kirby would do well to use his own voice <br/>
instead of a stilted &quot;formal writing&quot; voice.    My mother-in-law and even my <br/>
husband will write letters in a voice that&#39;s not their own at all.  <br/>
<br/>
When children just know instinctively whether something is wrong or right, in <br/>
their own native language, that has a name:  native speaker&#39;s intuition.    <br/>
Because Kirby has read English too, now, for nine or ten years, he has a native <br/>
reader&#39;s intuition, as it were, about punctuation.  All it needs is a little <br/>
touch-up and practice for him to turn around and write back.   <br/>
<br/>
He has been writing e-mails and instant messages for some time, but IMs have <br/>
their own rules, and that&#39;s fine.  There was a time when lots of people could <br/>
read, understand, and maybe immitate the language of telegraphed messages, <br/>
where people were paying by the letter.  There are times I&#39;ve seen the <br/>
abbreviations of singles ads used in other contexts.   Those who don&#39;t ever look in the <br/>
backs of those newspapers aimed at young adults might not get them at all, but <br/>
they might understand similar shorthand in real estate ads.   All those are <br/>
real too, but not formal full-on, whole-word English.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If you realize your child is college bound, how can you help them learn <br/>
formal writing, so they don&#39;t go into it not knowing how to follow a scripted <br/>
planned paper. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Offer to help by e-mail if your teen needs help away from home.   <br/>
Suggest internet sites on essay writing.  <br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s really, truly not necessary to practice beforehand on something like <br/>
writing an essay.   If the professor gives an outline/script, then the <br/>
student follows it.   If he just says &quot;essay&quot; and that word is new to the student, <br/>
google.com is right at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Related story from last night:   My sister called.  She&#39;s 47 years old.  <br/>
She&#39;s changing jobs, and is gong to work at a bank.   She&#39;ll be a teller first but <br/>
they&#39;re training her for a management kind of thing.   She doesn&#39;t type.  She <br/>
never wanted to.  She has resisted the internet and e-mail.   Now she&#39;s <br/>
interested in moving quickly toward all that.<br/>
<br/>
She got Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing and has been going through that.  I told <br/>
her she should just get an e-mail account and start writing to me, and her <br/>
kids (who are in two different places now, and none with her fulltime).   I told <br/>
her to download instant messenger and I&#39;d write with her and she would get <br/>
fast.   <br/>
<br/>
She said she wanted to get fast first, before she tried instant message.  I <br/>
told her it was a more real way to get fast than Mavis Beacon.   We&#39;ll see.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never been a story writer, but I still make book reports every time I <br/>
come here and tell people I&#39;ve read something cool, or I&#39;ve found a webpage and <br/>
I give the highlights and recommend it to people, or when I write a review on <br/>
Amazon.com (which I&#39;ve only done a time or three).<br/>
<br/>
I write an essay pretty often.  But stories as in fictional stories, I don&#39;t <br/>
think I&#39;ve done since fourth grade.   <br/>
<br/>
Stories as in accounts of my day are more like reports.  It&#39;s a kind of <br/>
journalism if it&#39;s factual for the use of others (such as the account of helping <br/>
Kirby with commas), or more essay style with personal commentary, as many longer <br/>
posts here tend toward.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been more drawn to non-fiction than to fiction, though.  So I <br/>
don&#39;t get a warm fuzzy feeling about encouraging kids to write fiction.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some things my boys have written in role-playing games.  That&#39;s a <br/>
VERY interesting blend of conversation and fiction.  They write in the persona <br/>
of their character.<br/>

what she wanted to write about the subject and then divide that up into <br/>

<br/>
The GED is a three-paragraph essay, and I told Kirby and a couple of his <br/>
friends that by that they meant write one paragraph telling them what you&#39;re going <br/>
to say, one saying it, and one summarizing what you&#39;d said.    It was kind of <br/>
a joke, but it&#39;s also the truth. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all good enough at thinking and communicating that they knew what I <br/>
meant.<br/>
<br/>
Of the two who&#39;ve already taken it, one was in school until 8th grade, so <br/>
he&#39;s done formal writing.   One did fairly poorly on the writing section, but he <br/>
passed.   Kirby, still to be determined.  I&#39;m not worried.  If he fails it he <br/>
can take it again. He&#39;s not grade-trained like the Pavlov report-card dog I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975723924">This was very helpful to me Sandra.  I&#39;m going to show it to my son.  He still says he&#39;s &quot;not good at math&quot;.  He said so yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him what he meant.  His response was &quot;I&#39;m not bad at math, but I&#39;m not particularly good at it either&quot;.  Thats a big improvement from a few years ago, at least he doesn&#39;t think he is &quot;stupid&quot; anymore.  Instead, he said &quot;I&#39;m good at math in my head, I&#39;m just not good at it on paper&quot;.  That would be a much more accurate statement than what he used to say.<br/>
<br/>
And then I asked him if he liked computer programming (something he&#39;s been dabbling in), and he said he doesn&#39;t know how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked him if he thought he could *learn* how to do it, he said yes.<br/>
<br/>
My son has always been a perfectionist, expecting himself to just know things without the process of learning them.  He has this unrealistic idea that everyone else just &quot;knows&quot; these things and he doesn&#39;t.  It creates a lot of anxiety for him.<br/>
<br/>
I think to make the distinction that you don&#39;t have to &quot;know&quot; it, but you can &quot;learn&quot; it anytime you want is important for him.<br/>

than the analogies and multiple choice testing. In those cases, it&#39;s not a matter of <br/>
&quot;passing&quot; but of scoring as well as possible.<br/>
<br/>

had written.<br/>

What elese is new?<br/>

Clearly the focus is going to be on the thesis statement, the organization and the use of <br/>
effective transitions.<br/>

So in that sense, these things need to be taught so that our kids will know what to do <br/>
when they write for those kinds of exams.<br/>

irrelevant information prematurely.<br/>

with confidence and flair, then learning to put those ideas into a format isn&#39;t really that <br/>
difficult, especially when it&#39;s necessary. <br/>
