<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048773398">I believe that doctor was way out of line to quiz your kids like that. And I<br/>
would have told him so. And like Sandra, I would ask him if he quizzes all<br/>
of his patients that way. A lot of people feel the need to find out how much<br/>
homeschooled kids don&#39;t know. And if the kids don&#39;t know what those people<br/>
think they should, it is because homeschooling is bad. Whenever I encounter<br/>
people like that, I ask them why there are so many public schooled kids who<br/>
don&#39;t know those things as well; and I ask them why my kids know a lot of<br/>
things that ps kids don&#39;t know, and probably aren&#39;t even taught.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the doctor, though. Every health care provider that my kids have had<br/>
since we started homeschooling have been impressed that we homeschool. Not<br/>
one ever quized them, or question the wisdom of it. In fact, quite the<br/>
oposite. Most of them have said that they don&#39;t blame us for pulling our<br/>
kids out of ps. My husband is military, so we have seen quite a few<br/>
different providers. Even our civilian providers: dentist, allergist, eye<br/>
doctor, as well as their nurses and office staff, think that homeschooling<br/>
is great. Perhaps it is because the school district in this town is so<br/>
awful, I don&#39;t know. The provider that my middle son had when we first took<br/>
our kids out of ps, told us that he considered doing the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
We had been reported to child protective services for educational neglect<br/>
because we kept our son home when he had asthma attacks. Our son&#39;s health<br/>
care providers were furious about this. They wrote letters on our behalf,<br/>
but to no avail. We were still found guilty because we didn&#39;t have a<br/>
doctor&#39;s note to cover each and every day that he was absent. The school<br/>
nurse was only at the school 2 half days a week, and she wasn&#39;t trained in<br/>
how to care for asthmatics. First we just switched our two youngest to a<br/>
different elementary school, with the plan of preparing to homeschool the<br/>
following year. Well, one day at the new school I called the school to let<br/>
them know my youngest wouldn&#39;t be there because he had a fever of  103, and<br/>
the principal said that it was probably just allergies and that I should<br/>
send him anyways. Well that was it! I went downtown that same day and filed<br/>
the paperwork to establish a homeschool! The principal was so shocked on the<br/>
following Monday when I showed up and told her that that would be my son&#39;s<br/>
final day at school. The only people around here that we ever get any flack<br/>
from about homeschool are a few teachers and a busybody old lady at church<br/>
who is always bossing everybody around. Most of the teachers that I know<br/>
personally think it is great that we homeschool. One of them even told me<br/>
that if she wasn&#39;t at the school everyday to keep an eye on what goes on<br/>
with her daughters, and to be able to hand pick her teachers, that she would<br/>
be homeschooling her own daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Well, as my oldest ds would say, I have blabbered on enough!<br/>
