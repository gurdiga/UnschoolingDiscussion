  It is always a struggle for me to get out thank you notes.  After the girl&#39;s birthdays, I typically use the computer to design a thank you using photos from the party.  I try to involve them in choosing the picture and a short message for the cards.  Sometimes it&#39;s like pulling teeth to get them just to sign each card.<br/>

<br/>
  I used to write the notes for my daughter with printing that could have been her own--and many thought it was.  If you think it&#39;s important to write thank you&#39;s, you could do them on the computer and have the kids sign them.  Here&#39;s something way out there, but it might work for them...  you could have their signatures made into rubber stamps (you can do this at an office supply store or at a Things Remembered store), if they have lots of thank yous to send frequently.  They might not have a problem with stamping their name on twenty cards.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, you could make the making of the thank yous more fun with all kinds of stamps, ribbons, etc.  Maybe that would help their interest level.<br/>
<br/>
  Or maybe they&#39;d like to send a small token back to the person, like a refrigerator magnet of the party, with a simple &quot;Thank you!&quot; on it.  <br/>

the Christmas card section--it comes with cards<br/>

Phone calls to those who mail gifts. When the gift is received I&#39;ll get <br/>

How do  other families handle this issue?  I think that writing a thank you <br/>
note  for a gift is important but it seems tacky for me to write them for other <br/>
 family members.  Where do I find the balance between forcing them to do  <br/>
this and doing it all myself?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Gifts given in person get an oral thank you. Mailed gifts (usually  money) <br/>
get a phone call or a thank you note---stating what they spent  (or will spend) <br/>
it on. <br/>
 <br/>
When Cameron went Australia, we actually sent out requests for money to  help <br/>
finance the trip (it was a Student Ambassadorship with People to People).  <br/>
Cameron had a BUNCH of notes to write. We made them with stickers of kangaroos  <br/>
and boomerangs, and inside I made straight pencil lines and actually  wrote <br/>
the thank you&#39;s with pencil. He came back and wrote over them with a nice  pen. <br/>
We then erased the pencil marks and lines.<br/>
 <br/>
I figured this way he would, by osmosis &lt;g&gt;, learn how and what  to write. <br/>
It&#39;s his handwriting----just over mine.<br/>
 <br/>
It seemed the least painful way to do it. In some, we included a  darling <br/>
photo of him with a koala.<br/>
 <br/>
I send out a good many thank you&#39;s, so they see me do it (without  <br/>
complaining). Ben sends his share of business thank you&#39;s too, so he&#39;s modeling  it as <br/>
well. I just make it as easy as possible, so that it doesn&#39;t seem painful  and <br/>
pointless. I also point out when someone sends me---or them---a heartfelt  <br/>
thank you note, especially the pretty, unique ones!<br/>

<br/>
With Jayn&#39;s last birthday (5) we did two different kinds of cards. <br/>
<br/>
For the adults, older children, and distant family who had sent gifts by<br/>
mail, Jayn drew a picture related to the theme of the party which I scanned<br/>
and turned into multiple copies of a notecard using card creating computer<br/>
graphics software. This year it was a beautiful mermaid. I then did the<br/>
text, taking the opportunity to hand write a short letter to the distant<br/>
relatives. I invited Jayn to write her name on the end, an activity she<br/>
usually enjoys, and she did do so on most of them.<br/>
<br/>
For the core group of Jayn&#39;s friends, young (mostly) girls she sees<br/>
regularly, she had the idea to make individual cards. I had every intention<br/>
of using the scanned picture card, but no - Jayn wanted to draw a portrait<br/>
of each of these friends and write in each one. So there were about eight<br/>
cards to be done.<br/>
<br/>
I prepared folded paper and over several weeks, usually the night before<br/>
dance class when we would be seeing the girls, Jayn would do one or two of<br/>
these cards. She took a lot of care with the pictures, and wrote variations<br/>
of &quot;Thank You {Name} Jayn&quot;. I then put them into envelopes and added the<br/>
name to the front.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage to this approach is that with the local girls, I was able to<br/>
just let the Moms know in person that a card was on its way, so no-one felt<br/>
slighted. So many of Jayn&#39;s friends have birthdays within a month, and we<br/>
were all joking with each other that the thank yous back and forth would<br/>
arrive around Christmas. Meanwhile people who might be more concerned with<br/>
the etiquette of receiving timely thanks still receive something with Jayn&#39;s<br/>
art work attached. <br/>
<br/>
We will do something similar I would expect with the Christmas gifts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046165246">Ok I understand now. Thanks for enlightening me..:-) Well I suppose then I would just explain to my children that this is something that needs to be done. I dont guess I would really give them a choice about it, and I would just sit with them and give them ideas of what to say. Maybe they just dont know what to say or how to say it??? Just pondering. Maybe I will take this up. Oh and no I havent ever recieved one. Its just not a priority in my neck of the woods I guess....maybe I will start a  new trend (well not new but new to me)  We say thankyou just not in written notes. So are you suppose to do it with every gift you recieve? If so I have a lot of writting to do..:-) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>special---all the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;way down to your toes?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nope, i haven&#39;t...but i *have* dealt with a lot of guilt and pressure and<br/>
forcing from my mom as a child to write them.  <br/>
<br/>
in our house, sometimes i write them, but mostly i don&#39;t.  i&#39;ll usually<br/>
thank someone when i receive something right then and there...and i tend<br/>
to do this for/in place of my kids too since they&#39;re very shy and have a<br/>
hard time speaking up to certain people even if they&#39;re sincerely very<br/>
grateful.  <br/>
<br/>
i might initiate the idea that if they wanted to draw a picture or write<br/>
a note to the person to say thank you, i&#39;d help them and send it and<br/>
share how much they&#39;d love to get a nice something in the mail and know<br/>
how perfect the gift was, etc.  they might get excited, they might roll<br/>
their eyes.  i pick up the slack because i appreciate the giver&#39;s<br/>
kindness and generosity and the love in their intent.  <br/>
<br/>
that having been said, i also don&#39;t think it&#39;s a necessary thing to write<br/>
a formal thank you every time i/they receive something from someone.  i<br/>
don&#39;t care if they ever write one actually.  i want it to come out of<br/>
their genuine appreciation, not some feigned formality.  it reminds me<br/>
very much of being forced to say *sorry* as a child when i wasn&#39;t<br/>
sorry...having to say *thank you* in any form when i&#39;m not thankful or<br/>
just the general idea that a written sort of thanks being expected every<br/>
time someone decides to give something feels off to me.<br/>
<br/>
maybe i just need to receive a wonderful, heartfelt thank you<br/>
note...maybe that would change my perspective? ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you say thank you and please and excuse me? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sometimes, sometimes not...depends on the situation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you say that you had a good time and thank you for inviting me? Was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that &gt;passed down by your mother? <br/>
<br/>
most everything i do comes from existing in the opposite of my mother as<br/>
her life is ruled by guilt and fear and *have to&#39;s* and *should&#39;s* and<br/>
*what if&#39;s* and i don&#39;t like that.  admittedly, i&#39;m at the opposite<br/>
extreme right now and am working on finding a happy medium middle ground.<br/>
:)  my childhood was so wrapped up in my mother&#39;s blanket of<br/>
insanity...*if you don&#39;t say thank you, you&#39;re ungrateful and bad and<br/>
don&#39;t deserve nice things* kind of crap when i was just shy around people<br/>
i saw infrequently.  <br/>
<br/>
when i give things, i give them with no strings attached because i think<br/>
the gift will be loved...i never expect some flowery expression of<br/>
gratitude (not that it would annoy me, i just don&#39;t expect it.)  heck,<br/>
sometimes the gift is off and i can tell when they open it...what good<br/>
would it do to get a thank you about how much they love the so & so when<br/>
it&#39;s useless to them?  it feels like a waste of paper...a waste of<br/>
sentiment...  but again, there&#39;s nothing wrong with being grateful that<br/>
someone thought of you and took time out of their life to try and honor<br/>
you with a gift (even if they were off the mark.)  sorry for talking in a<br/>
circle and kind of covering all ground... :) i guess i just don&#39;t see<br/>
making it a formality on paper as better or more concrete than smiling<br/>
and saying, *i love it, thanks!*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I write business thank you&#39;s all the time. It can make a big difference<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to whether someone would like to deal with me in the future. They<br/>
 </span></blockquote>remember  &gt;it.<br/>
<br/>
that makes sense in the business world for sure...you want to make and<br/>
keep the connections.  but the connections between friends and family are<br/>
strong and based on continuous getting together and love and other joyous<br/>
things that don&#39;t exist in a typical business relationship.  written<br/>
thank you notes in that world are a helpful tool to making money in<br/>
addition to marking appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I write one after I stay at someone&#39;s house for the night as a guest. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s very sweet.  i guess for me it sounds weird just because we don&#39;t<br/>
do things like that!  anytime we stay at a friend&#39;s house, it&#39;s no big<br/>
deal...they don&#39;t go to any huge lengths to accommodate us and we<br/>
reciprocate all the time by having them stay with us.  it would seem<br/>
weird to me to make a big deal about it and write a letter.  our<br/>
appreciation shines through in our hugs and kisses and smiles...nothing<br/>
extra needed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I write them when I I receive a mailed invitation to a party (verbal  or<br/>
<br/>
&gt;e-vites receive their thank you&#39;s respectively).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i just hug people when we get there and when we leave and i might call<br/>
the next day or sometime during the week after to repeat about the nice<br/>
time we had.  feels like enough to me. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s considered polite and appreciative. That&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do you think it&#39;s considered impolite and unappreciative to not<br/>
give/receive a written thank you...or is it just icing on the cake?  just<br/>
curious...i&#39;m not trying to be argumentative, i promise. :)<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;ll accept any thank you graciously. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t like forced ones though----like those &quot;sorry&#39;s&quot; you mentioned. I&#39;m  <br/>
still gracious. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think it depends on the cultural differences too. I&#39;m from the South.  It&#39;s <br/>
probably a bit more &quot;expected&quot; down here----we&#39;re kind of old-fashioned  <br/>
compared to the rest of the country! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s certainly icing on the cake.<br/>
 <br/>
But last year I received, not only a lovely thank you note, but a bouquet  of <br/>
flowers from Kathryn for my help & hand-holding with the  conference. I <br/>
didn&#39;t expect it, and it was truly appreciated. Gilding the lily,  maybe! &lt;g&gt; But I <br/>
felt special and appreciated, yes.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s nice to put out a little more effort when someone has gone to  <br/>
trouble for you. Hosting someone in your home IS putting you out----even  IF <br/>
it&#39;s fun or reciprocated or easy. Knowing my interests and sending me  something <br/>
extra-special *just* for me DESERVES a special thank you in my  opinion. (Not <br/>
that everyone should so this---I just expect it from myself.) <br/>
 <br/>
I like showing my appreciation---and from the responses I&#39;ve received, it&#39;s  <br/>
obviously NOT done every day by others AND it&#39;s greatly appreciated. I <br/>
hand-make  my cards, too, so there&#39;s obviously been some effort put into my thank <br/>
you, and  people notice.<br/>
 <br/>
Do something nice for me---I&#39;ll send you one! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Yeah. I got a lot of that as a child. My mother forced thank you&#39;s on me  and <br/>
my brother. What I learned, though, was how *much* they ARE appreciated and  <br/>
how to write a really good one.<br/>
 <br/>
It took just over a year to write all my wedding thank you notes (400  people <br/>
at the wedding! :-P~~~~*), but each one was sincere and chatty. I made  Ben <br/>
write the notes to *his* guests----and he&#39;d never written one before. He got  <br/>
pretty damned good at it! &lt;G&gt; Now he&#39;s better at writing them than I am!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
My mother asked me every week whether I&#39;d finished my wedding notes. Damn  <br/>
her. It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t *want* to. But her insistence made me avoid  <br/>
it----so I get what you&#39;re saying. But if you change the way *you* look at it,  you <br/>
might find the joy in it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

There is nothing as satisfying as writing a thank you note from the bottom  <br/>
of your heart.  It&#39;s so organic and it makes YOU feel better, knowing that  the <br/>
other person is going to feel better, too.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s easier to express things in writing, for me.  I can say &quot;thank  you&quot; and <br/>
I do all the time, but if you get a note from me, you will remember it,  <br/>
because it&#39;s heartfelt.  <br/>
