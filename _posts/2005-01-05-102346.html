Two years old? &lt;g&gt; I know there&#39;s a NASCAR college in Charlotte, NC!  &lt;g&gt; She <br/>
might have to wait a few years though!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I just got a cute sound book called Nascar Track Sounds by Futech  <br/>
Interactive ISBN 1-58224-020-5.<br/>
 <br/>
It has a little wheel on each page that you push and get sounds of  racing... <br/>
of course I bought the book for me since it has Jeff Gordan on  it.  My kids <br/>
just laugh.<br/>
 <br/>
Also Nascar.com has all kinds of pictures and info.  Not only do they  have a <br/>
college but I just read they are starting to recruit women and  minorities so <br/>
there you go. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
There is a Disney Channel movie about a girl who becomes a race car driver<br/>
in kid races, overcoming various obstacles I guess (based on a true story) -<br/>
I haven&#39;t watched it, just seen the trailers. It may not be of interest to<br/>
your 2yo, but it might give you some further ideas.<br/>
