 </span></blockquote>Linda, you feel someone is reading the messages first and allowing on<br/>
certain ones to go through?<br/>
<br/>
That was my question, and now I know the answer. Mine did go through.<br/>
Thank you for all of your help and direction to archives.<br/>
<br/>
Please no more talk about moderation, because Lisa and Helen are needed<br/>
elsewhere right now.  <br/>
Unschoolers..........lets get back to unschooling and supporting each other.<br/>

I know if a circumstance presents itself as not being loving in my life, then <br/>
it is a sign that I am bypassing love and that I am not looking out and being <br/>
loving from the <br/>
eyes of my heart.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859376011">Hi Rebecca and other newcomers,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome! I&#39;ve been here since October. Since then this group has gone through a few changes. It used to be quite the happening place! I&#39;m not very sure why it has been so quiet lately. Even though the member number has risen, this must be due to newcomers lurking, waiting to see what everyone else is talking about. Probably a lot of people in this 600+ group have their mail set to &quot;no mail&quot; and check back occasionally. I&#39;m kind of a lurker myself. ;-) But I get e-mails every day.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions or basically anything at all you want to talk about, feel free to post. I think this group just needs people posting and maybe it can pick up again. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve broken my silent mode today. :o) <br/>
<br/>
Have a great unschooling day!<br/>
<br/>
Karin<br/>
