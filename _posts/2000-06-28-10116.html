<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585955368">Hello!   I am new to the list, and I would like to learn as much about <br/>
homeschooling and unschooling as possible.  Can you recommend some books to <br/>
start me on my journey?  I would like to focus on those books which are <br/>
practical rather than theoretical, and those which are secular in nature.  I <br/>
am reading &quot;Family Matters&quot; right now and find it far too general -- I need <br/>
something with the specifics and mechanics of how homeschooling/unschooling <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
One book I would like an opinion on is &quot;Homeschooling: The Early Years&quot; by  <br/>
Linda Dobson.  I would also like to know which of these is more useful -- <br/>
&quot;The Homeschooling Handbook&quot; or &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Mary Griffith.<br/>
<br/>
FINALLY, I would love to know how unschoolers feel about following a loose <br/>
curriculum for math and reading, but unschooling for &quot;everything else.&quot;  If <br/>
the child and parent feel comfortable with this arrangement, is it a good one?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much -- I look forward to reading this list!<br/>
Susan</div>
