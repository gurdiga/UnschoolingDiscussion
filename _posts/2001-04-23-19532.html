<div id="ygrps-yiv-292656222">April 23 through 29 is National Turn Off Your TV Week.<br/>
<br/>
Go outside and play!<br/>
Read a book!<br/>
Play a game!<br/>
Write a letter!<br/>
Ride your bike!<br/>
Listen to music!<br/>
Make some music!<br/>
Garden!<br/>
Watch birds, or clouds, or the river flow, or the wind blow in the<br/>
trees...<br/>
<br/>
Better yet, UNPLUG your TV, so it can&#39;t be turned on by mistake.  No<br/>
videos either!  For our family, this was about breaking the habit.  After<br/>
a week with absolutely no television, we found that we were much more<br/>
conscious about watching TV.</div>
