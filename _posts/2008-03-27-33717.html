<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322065062">&lt;&lt;&lt;Surely you&#39;re not accusing people on this list of not helping people<br/>
change so that they have happier, brighter experiences.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Are you willing to truly hear that your approach to helping people isn&#39;t<br/>
working for some to the capacity that you probably intend? Although it is up<br/>
to each individual to extract meaning from your attempts to help, I assume<br/>
that you want to reach as many people as possible with your words. It is<br/>
obvious that you are deeply passionate about unschooling and really want to<br/>
contribute to other unschoolers, however from what I see happening, this<br/>
isn&#39;t about juju topics. It&#39;s bigger and more comprehensive than that. It&#39;s<br/>
about attitude and communication.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been hopping around to unschooling groups online for a couple of years<br/>
now with the hope I would find support, encouragement, and inspiration.<br/>
Unfortunately, the kind of support I have wanted has been difficult to find.<br/>
My family went out of town yesterday, so I thought I would continue the<br/>
search and that is what has brought me here to join this group today. I see<br/>
that paranormal and seemingly unscientific concepts are up for examination.<br/>
Science and spirituality/paranormal stuff are my lifelong passions, now<br/>
perfectly converging with my unschooling path. So I am excited to comment<br/>
and create some closure for myself about my frustration with these groups<br/>
since Abe-Hicks has been a big support for me, as well as the RU group, when<br/>
I couldn&#39;t meet my needs elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For me, unschooling includes fostering free-thinking and yet I observe<br/>
evaluations being made about this topic with criticism, sarcasm, and with<br/>
some resistance to exploring Abe-Hicks for understanding and clarity. I find<br/>
it contradictory that &quot;seasoned&quot; unschoolers who claim they want to share<br/>
their experience criticize certain unschoolers because of a particular<br/>
interest or passion they have. It appears we may have different<br/>
understandings of free-thinking going on. One of the reasons I choose to<br/>
unschool my kids is to foster a functioning concept of acceptance of all<br/>
people, regardless of what they think yet using discernment to know what is<br/>
healthy to allow in their lives. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do not judge others who perceive Abe-Hicks differently from me, everyone&#39;s<br/>
POV is valid to me. For instance, this topic is providing me with the<br/>
inspiration and opportunity to voice some things that are dear to me.    I<br/>
just want to share my observations and provide feedback that given what some<br/>
people are implying they are trying to accomplish within these groups -<br/>
namely helping people- is getting lost in the translation. I am not pointing<br/>
fingers at any particular people as I have ran into this with multiple<br/>
people on multiple groups. And since people can only determine if they are<br/>
fulfilling their intentions by the feedback they get, I am tossing mine out<br/>
for clarity.  I also think there might be more people on these lists that<br/>
might resonate with my perception but are too discouraged to speak up. I<br/>
have no need to be liked by anybody in particular so I am happily willing to<br/>
share my POV that others might disagree with. It&#39;s all relative and it&#39;s all<br/>
good. I do think that there is an easier way to learn from each other rather<br/>
than out of conflict and defensiveness though. In fact, I thought that was<br/>
something all unschoolers were basing their path on. And just for clarity&#39;s<br/>
sake, I don&#39;t mean that everybody ought to see things the same way. I do<br/>
think that agreeing on one thing would be helpful to everybody - that simply<br/>
being kindness and mindfulness.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My understanding of unschooling includes trust not judgment, joy not guilt,<br/>
fun not dread, nurturance not indifference, open-mindedness not intolerance<br/>
, individuality not conformity, friendship not competition, love not<br/>
disgust. We have chosen to create these positive elements in the lives of<br/>
our children. But to what extent? Are we to model it or follow the parenting<br/>
model of &quot;don&#39;t do what I do, do as I say.&quot; I want to be the kind of person<br/>
I want my children to be - that means diligence on my part. Haven&#39;t we all<br/>
decided to do things differently from our parents? Aren&#39;t we trying to<br/>
accelerate the process by consciously deciding to close that generational<br/>
gap as much as possible? Isn&#39;t that the reason why deschooling is more<br/>
critical for the parents? Perhaps resocializing would be a better word. Not<br/>
just because we went to school, but because the aspects of the school system<br/>
unschoolers mutually deem as unworthy are the symptoms the organization<br/>
breeds - failing to meet the needs of individuals. And for me that includes<br/>
both the giving and receiving of acceptance. Division is superseded by more<br/>
division. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The radical unschooling group is the only forum I have found so far that<br/>
provides those opportunities exclusively. I am thankful for that. It has<br/>
definitely encouraged me to visualize/imagine and hence manifest more of<br/>
what I was/am wanting in my life. Works for me since using one&#39;s imagination<br/>
is fundamental in life because everything is birthed from thought.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I was younger I used to talk to my dad about my interests and beliefs<br/>
about the &quot;higher power&quot; I believed in. I wanted so much to be understood by<br/>
him. However he was not as receptive as I hoped, as he was inundated with<br/>
all of indoctrination  that his parents passed to him that contradicted what<br/>
I was sharing with him. It was very painful to me that he resisted my POV<br/>
because his support  meant a great deal to me, and I thought he did not<br/>
accept me completely for who I was. I recall feeling nervous just thinking<br/>
about telling him that I didn&#39;t believe in his concept of god or any<br/>
religion even though my parents encouraged me to follow my gut, think for<br/>
myself, and disregard others&#39; opinions of me that didn&#39;t serve me -<br/>
including theirs. So although I wasn&#39;t &quot;unschooled,&quot;  they gave me a<br/>
precious gift- especially since I enjoyed a lot of juju stuff! Now they seek<br/>
answers from me - another precious gift. They have embraced that our<br/>
relationship is a two way street. Sometimes when we think we know what is<br/>
best for someone&#39;s growth - we&#39;re wrong. I don&#39;t take that lightly when<br/>
reaching out to people. It&#39;s like I tell my kids, you don&#39;t know if your are<br/>
helping unless someone tells you it would be helpful. So anyone please feel<br/>
free to tell me if this wasn&#39;t helpful to you so I can assess my approach<br/>
and choose accordingly. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I&#39;m wondering why you brought this to the table for discussing. Are<br/>
you wanting empathy for your frustrations or to make it clear that you don&#39;t<br/>
approve of exploring these types of topics on your list or something else?<br/>
Would you be willing to clarify your intentions? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Loving life, living to love!<br/>

<br/>
-=-Are you willing to truly hear that your approach to helping people  <br/>

<br/>
Do I have TIME?  I have about twelve e-mails open on the desktop here  <br/>
that need responses, and another fifteen or so in the sidebar needing  <br/>
to be quoted on my site.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a tire store behind my house (on the main street that&#39;s near  <br/>
our back gate).  Do you want to tell them that their approach to  <br/>
selling tires isn&#39;t working for some people in Albuquerque to the  <br/>
capacity that they probably intend?  Every bay is full, every day,  <br/>
and yet some people in Albuquerque buy their tires somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the capacity I intend:  I will work at this when I feel like  <br/>
it, in the way I feel like doing it.  If everyone down to the last  <br/>
person decided to leave this list and go to another one, and if there  <br/>
was nobody on UnschoolingDiscussion anymore, those lists could be  <br/>
closed down and I would go and make a quilt or watch movies or drink  <br/>
margaritas in the hot tub with my husband.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I assume that you want to reach as many people as possible with  <br/>
your words.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a valid assumption.  I&#39;m not out selling  <br/>
myself.  I&#39;m not making any exaggerated, glorified claims on my  <br/>
website.  I&#39;m not writing to conference organizers and saying &quot;Pick  <br/>
me!&quot;  I&#39;m not sending articles to magazines.  They ask me sometimes  <br/>
to send something.  I&#39;m not writing to people and saying &quot;interview  <br/>
me,&quot; but sometimes people call me.<br/>
<br/>
Someone here was giving advice (criticism, but that&#39;s okay) about how  <br/>
the writers here should do something different (use blogs instead of  <br/>
static websites, I think it was) and said wouldn&#39;t I like it if my  <br/>
site came up first if someone put in unschooling and spanking?     I  <br/>
hadn&#39;t thought of that, but I went to google to see, and mine DID  <br/>
come up first.  So the advice was packaged in an odd way, and for  <br/>
mysterious reasons, but the fact was (and I&#39;m checking again) mine  <br/>
was easy to find just as it was.<br/>
<br/>
Yep.  Still there.  And then Joyce.   Yet someone was advising us as  <br/>
though we weren&#39;t doing sufficient good, or weren&#39;t making our  <br/>
information readily available.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is obvious that you are deeply passionate about unschooling and  <br/>

<br/>
I really want to contribute?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ll read all of these two pages, I&#39;ll read as much criticism of  <br/>
me as you want to send.<br/>

I&#39;ll respond to more of that juju (long) post in other bits.  It&#39;s  <br/>
tiring and I&#39;m trying to work on this:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/artan/swords">http://sandradodd.com/artan/swords</a><br/>

but one video isn&#39;t uploading, and the bio page addresses don&#39;t all  <br/>
match so I had to hunt them.  And I&#39;m watering my yard, and I made  <br/>
lunch for Marty and Holly (Quinn already ate).<br/>

If you have an unschooling website you&#39;d like to invite people to,  <br/>
give us the URL.<br/>
<br/>
I have had one for a long time, from before there were any decent  <br/>
websites, and it&#39;s ever growing and being tweaked.  It&#39;s just there.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t about juju topics, it&#39;s about unschooling and integrity.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my attitude, and my voluntary communications.  I&#39;m sure those  <br/>
who don&#39;t care what I say can get clear of me.  So it&#39;s not bigger  <br/>
and more comprehensive, if you don&#39;t like my attitude.  That makes it  <br/>

I keep asking WHO this Abraham is and nobody&#39;s telling me.  I&#39;m being  <br/>
criticized for resisting exploration of a committee of fictional  <br/>

<br/>
I have a lot of understanding and clarity of unschooling.  If you  <br/>

<br/>
Can you paraphrase that into smaller words?  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t  <br/>

I have a note on my door that says no missionaries, no tree trimming,  <br/>

to exploring them?  I&#39;ve heard what the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses say.  I  <br/>
let some people give me the whole series, when I was pregnant and  <br/>
bored years ago.  I&#39;ve done the same for Mormons.  I DO know about  <br/>
that.  I know a fair amount about manifestation and visualization and  <br/>
all that too.  I didn&#39;t resist exploring.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

two people, went home and slept, got up in the morning and shot some  <br/>
more people.  Valid to you?  Would you tell the relatives of the  <br/>

There are others whose things  have been gathered and cross-linked  <br/>

being helped seems very (I&#39;m trying to think of a better word than  <br/>
&quot;pissy&quot; or &quot;churlish&quot;)...  spiteful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. I am not pointing fingers at any particular people as I have ran  <br/>
into this with multiple people on multiple groups.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible you just don&#39;t like discussion groups, or you&#39;re  <br/>
hoping for unschooling to be something other than what it is?   Is it  <br/>
possible that if it has happened to you multiple times that the  <br/>
common factor is you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-And since people can only determine if they are fulfilling their  <br/>
intentions by the feedback they get, I am tossing mine out for  <br/>
clarity.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can tell if I&#39;m fulfilling my intentions without feedback, but I do  <br/>
have a ton of positive feedback, and some churlish feedback (not  <br/>
nearly as much).  I intended to share my kids&#39; experiences, and I  <br/>
have done that. If I drop dead today, I&#39;m done.  Success!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also think there might be more people on these lists that might  <br/>
resonate with my perception but are too discouraged to speak up.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Take them all with you to a new group and do all the things you wish  <br/>
had been happening on all those other groups you tried.   Offer the  <br/>
kind of  &quot;support, encouragement, and inspiration&quot; you see so  <br/>
lacking.   Do it!  Why not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am happily willing to share my POV that others might disagree  <br/>
with. It&#39;s all relative and it&#39;s all good.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well &quot;relative&quot; means some is  more good that others, depending on  <br/>
one&#39;s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend I&#39;ve known since he was a teen.  He became a  <br/>
policeman.  He said one night he was arresting a guy for murder.  The  <br/>
guy was around 20 years old, sitting on the sidewalk in handcuffs,  <br/>
and said &quot;It&#39;s all good.&quot;  WHAT THE F*** did he think that  <br/>
meant!????  A guy was dead, RIGHT THERE.  He was probably never going  <br/>
to be out of jail another day in his life.  It&#39;s wasn&#39;t at ALL good.   <br/>
At least two families were destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-do think that there is an easier way to learn from each other  <br/>
rather than out of conflict and defensiveness though. In fact, I  <br/>
thought that was something all unschoolers were basing their path on.  <br/>
And just for clarity&#39;s sake, I don&#39;t mean that everybody ought to see  <br/>

helpful to everybody - that simply being kindness and mindfulness. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think you&#39;re being kinder by coming here and complaining about  <br/>
this list than I&#39;m being by maintaining it and posting regularly for  <br/>
seven years or however long?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think you&#39;re being more mindful by telling me it&#39;s all good  <br/>
and that you respect all points of view than I&#39;m being by pointing  <br/>
out that this doesn&#39;t help other people understand how to behave with  <br/>
their children today in ways that will make their lives better?<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s like I tell my kids, you don&#39;t know if your are helping  <br/>
unless someone tells you it would be helpful.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t seem like a good thing to tell one&#39;s kids.<br/>
