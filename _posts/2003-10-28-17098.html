I am new here. I am on a few other homeschool/unschool lists. You guys are <br/>
great! Really informative, and inspiring. I have a 2 year old son who is <br/>
going to be unschooled. We have yet to convey this idea to my in-laws who <br/>
are pretty much against every other parenting idea we have implemented <br/>
(co-sleeping, breastfeeding, gentle parenting, etc.). My mil thinks that <br/>
all children need &quot;training&quot;. She once said &quot;Children are god&#39;s way of <br/>
punishing you for enjoying sex.&quot; Any ideas about how to bring up the idea <br/>
without getting kicked out of the will? &lt;g&gt; I was thinking of <br/>
articles/statistics...any good ones? Books are too much - I need some <br/>
fairly quick come-backs. I was thinking of bringing up homeschooling first <br/>
and not even broaching the idea of unschooling until I see how it settles.<br/>
Flora, I have to say that your chances of staying in the will seem slim. <br/>
&quot;Children are god&#39;s way of punishing you for enjoying sex.&quot; Oh my.  Your poor <br/>
husband. HER poor husband.<br/>
