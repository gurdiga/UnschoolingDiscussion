<div id="ygrps-yiv-723963958"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone, but unschooling sounds alot like Montessori <br/>
&gt;&gt;schools.  The perpared environment approach, allows chldren to serve and <br/>
&gt;&gt;learn on their own.  Let the children follow their own<br/>
 </span></blockquote>interests.  They will learn when they are ready.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the difference lies in the idea of the prepared environment. A child <br/>
in a Montessori program is first and foremost in a program. They are in a <br/>
classroom that has been carefully stocked with whatever information the <br/>
program has decided a child needs to progress through in order to receive an <br/>
&quot;education&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In an unschooling lifestyle, there is no program and there is no classroom. <br/>
To me, it would be very limiting for my kids to have only a certain set of <br/>
materials to choose from. The entire world is their classroom and from that, <br/>
they are able to follow their own interests. This leaves the door wide open <br/>
to explore topics and ideas that I may never have even thought of. It also <br/>
leaves them open to approach more traditional areas throuh play, even if the <br/>
materials they play with aren&#39;t considered traditionally &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I try to keep my children&#39;s lives well stocked with interesting things to <br/>
do, see, touch, smell, taste, hear and read. I don&#39;t limit those things to <br/>
educational, grade level appropriate, or those things designed to progress <br/>
them to some desired level of learning. We may have some of the same <br/>
materials as a Montessori classroom, but are in no way limited by those <br/>
materials. They are just one more cool and interesting thing that we have to <br/>
explore. I try to give my kids as much access to the world as I can and join <br/>
them on their journey of exploration and discovery.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I also get the impression that he tried changing the school systems, and <br/>
&gt;&gt;he didn&#39;t succeed.  That is when all the homeschooling ,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>unschooling term began. I am not sure if I am even close.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe that John Holt realized that it was impossible to change such a <br/>
huge system from within. His writings changed over time from changing the <br/>
system to abandoning it entirely. He initially coined the term unschooling <br/>
because those uncola commercials were popular at the time. The &quot;un&quot; phrase <br/>
was being thrown about a lot at the time and it helped to identify what he <br/>
was trying to propose with taking children out of school to learn at home. <br/>
Over time, the term unschooling has evolved to become a distinct entity from <br/>
traditional homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

touted as a refreshing, light, completely different taste than traditional <br/>

I think Montessori & unschooling are actually nothing alike. Montessori has &#39;goals&#39; in mind, whether they take a year or a day, there is an end goal. I believe if any school was going to be compared to unschooling it would be Free School (Sudbury Education).<br/>
