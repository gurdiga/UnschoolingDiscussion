<div id="ygrps-yiv-285660178">For some reason this popped into my head tonight while watching Law and Order <br/>
on A&E but, do any of you remember the movie Marlo Thomas made (with Carole <br/>
Hart?) called Free To Be You and Me? It had all sorts of stars; Roberta <br/>
Flack, Michael Jackson, Harry Belafonte, Alan Alda, Mel Brooks, Kris <br/>
Kristofferson, Cicely Tyson, Tom Smothers, and Carol Channing to name a few. <br/>
There was a scene with baby puppets in the hospital nursery discussing how <br/>
boys and girls can do/play with the same things. How they can grow up to be <br/>
anything they want to be. Another scene was a (cartoon) princess who&#39;s father <br/>
wanted her to marry and she wanted to see the world. She ended up running in <br/>
a race and won. Another was about a little girl who always went around saying <br/>
Ladies first! and ended up getting eaten by monsters because of her attitude. <br/>
Tons of singing and dancing, good positive moral message about growing up and <br/>
having respect for the opposite sex, especially good message for girls. Aimed <br/>
at the 4 to 8 y/o age group, but good for all ages. I think it was made in <br/>
1973 or 74. Anyway, I was asking Darin if he had ever seen it, and I was <br/>
surprised to learn that he had never seen it and had no clue what I was <br/>
talking about. I thought almost all kids who grew up then (60&#39;s - 70&#39;s) had <br/>
seen it. Do any of you know what I am rambling on about? I am going to the <br/>
library tomorrow to see if they have a copy. My kids are going through the <br/>
*only girls/boys do that* stage. I think it will be good for them.  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s pretty dated.  It wasn&#39;t made until the 70&#39;s, so kids who grew up in the <br/>
60&#39;s missed it, I think.  I did.  I knew about it from studying education, <br/>
and being involved (as a teen, in teen-fashion) in the women&#39;s movement.<br/>
<br/>
My boys saw it when they were little, and learned a couple of the songs, but <br/>
Holly hasn&#39;t seen it.  I think it&#39;s still in print (not sure).<br/>

It&#39;s on DVD!  <br/>
It was first made in 1974.  Here&#39;s the description from a DVD sales site:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Guest stars Alan Alda, Harry Belafonte, Mel Brooks, Roberta Flack, Michael <br/>
Jackson, Dustin Hoffman, and Rosey Grier celebrate the joys of childhood in <br/>
song, story, and poetry, and help children to learn to feel free to be <br/>
individuals.  &quot;<br/>

I remember this!  Of course I was only 6 months old when I saw it  :) <br/>
As a matter of fact I&#39;m pretty sure this was a book written by Marlo Thomas that was made into the movie.<br/>

the book any different from the movie? I notice the two different titles. I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The book was actually sitting out on our coffee table (okay, in the huge<br/>
pile on our ottoman, to be exact) so I just pulled it out... when I was a<br/>
kid, I used to &quot;babysit&quot; for my Cool Next-Door Neighbor (she&#39;d do<br/>
housework or nap, and I&#39;d play with her baby... I was 8 or 9). and<br/>
listened to the tape over and over. The movie was on network tv a few<br/>
months ago, we watched it... I love it. Rain and I used to read the<br/>
little plays in the book together. The songs are in the book, too, music<br/>
and lyrics, and there are lots of pictures... some of it is dated but<br/>
that makes it good. As I recall, every play or song in the book is in the<br/>
movie, and vice versa - they&#39;re quite similar.<br/>
<br/>
There was a sequel, too - Free to Be, A Family. I don&#39;t remember much<br/>
about it, though, I was older...<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Rain is listening to &quot;Plant a Radish&quot; (the Fantasticks) over<br/>
and over, trying to learn the words (I found the lyrics for her online).<br/>
I think all the vegetables are affecting my brain...<br/>
