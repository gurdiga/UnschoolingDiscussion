<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804282322">I&#39;m not sure if you have tried this but the digest version works <br/>
wonders.  you get the whole thing at once and just scroll through to <br/>
what you want to read.  I personally like it and I have all my mail <br/>
like that because it is more condesed. All you have to do is go <br/>
to &quot;my groups&quot; @ the yahoo site and you can pull your list of groups <br/>
up and there is a thing to clck there to digest - sorry I can&#39;t <br/>
remember what it&#39;s called.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve tried it with other groups but I had trouble<br/>
keeping the treads together in my head. I may try it<br/>
here because I&#39;m getting a lot from this list and<br/>
would hate to have to drop it.<br/>
