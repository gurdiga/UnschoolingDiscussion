<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882952368">First of all, again, I didn&#39;t mean to start a long debate over religion/witchcraft/satanism or anything like that. It was brought up to illustrate how we have not seen the sort of increase in violence and other behaviors we&#39;d find objectionable since letting go of restraints on television. I was asked specifically why we had limited them and I answered our reasons for having done so. <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, in some degree having been a member of this group for awhile now, I know what are &quot;hot topics&quot; and what aren&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
I &quot;spoke&quot; without quite thinking in my eagerness to share how things have changed for us, and for that I apologize. <br/>
 <br/>
It has been suggested from more than one source that I take a break from the group for awhile. So I&#39;ll see ya in a couple weeks...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Beth has done a great job asking questions and clearly working hard at <br/>
understanding the responses and really thinking about how to implement <br/>
them in her very hectic life with 4 little kids and a husband whose job <br/>
keeps him away from home for days at a time and social services on her <br/>
back on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
But after such an intense time - so much new information, so many <br/>
changes in thinking, keeping up with this email list seems like it <br/>
ought to become a lower priority for a while so that she can take time <br/>
integrate all this new stuff. I suggested this to her and I did not <br/>
suggest it because I wanted her to leave the list, but because I was <br/>
thinking that it would be very very good for her to take all this new <br/>
input and spend some time really very very focused on her children and <br/>
herself/her husband. She has so much to deal with and I think it is <br/>
really important for us to sometimes step back from outside input and <br/>
get ourselves more firmly centered in our new mental place. I felt Beth <br/>
needed to do that and I suggested it to her privately. Interestingly, <br/>
someone else had the same feeling and posted it on the list.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest it to ANYBODY who has had a lot of new ideas tossed at them <br/>
and is making major changes in their lives. There is a time for <br/>
gathering lots of input and having lots of discussion, but that usually <br/>
needs to be followed by a period of quiet contemplation and focus.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We should all keep in mind that the reason most people are here is for their<br/>
kids :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really wonderful that any of us can help anyone else here as a side<br/>
effect, but the kids are what&#39;s most important.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, think the points MamaBeth has brought up have sparked some great<br/>
discussion. But I also remember the reason she posted at all was because she<br/>
was trying to figure out how to do it all. And being on this list is adding<br/>
even more to her life. So it would be selfish to ask her to add more to her<br/>
life to benefit others. (In fact that was one of the threads! How she can<br/>
say no to people outside the family.)<br/>
<br/>
And at some point it&#39;s best to put the instruction manual down and just go<br/>
try things out. It more often than not helps people get to that &quot;Now I get<br/>
it!&quot; moment. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I do hope she&#39;ll come back when time isn&#39;t so crunched for her.<br/>

*********************************************<br/>
Not to mention that she is having problems with DCS about her kids not being <br/>
in school, the house not being take care of, the kids running out of the house <br/>
unsupervised.  All this, of course, is the opinion of DCS, but they have the <br/>
power to make her and her children&#39;s lives miserable.<br/>
<br/>
Mamabeth did a LOT of posting.  More than the majority of people who&#39;ve been <br/>
here years and years, and more than those monitoring it.  That is a HUGE chunk <br/>
of time that she could be using straightening out her life right now.  Let <br/>
her get things in control, satisfy her requirements DCS is requesting, THEN come <br/>
back.  Maybe then she could learn (as some of us have) that she doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to follow every thread.  This email list can still be an asset to her (and her <br/>
posts to us) yet take a much smaller chunk of her life than it does for her <br/>
right now.  <br/>
