hi erin,
<p>first i would like to say it&#39;s <u>not</u> about perfection - doing the
right thing in every situation.&nbsp; imo it&#39;s about being yourself, being
flexible and balancing everyone&#39;s needs -not necessarily easy tasks:) but
fulfilling nonetheless:)&nbsp; and that it&#39;s really ok to mess up and lay
the law down but this approach should not be the norm.
<p>when dealing with these kinds of frustrations - first we must remember
that we are modeling for our kids &quot;how to handle frustrations&#39; (i have
not done a stellar job in this area but am learning and recognizing just
how much kids mirror their parents - a concept i feel in crucial to unschooling)
and therefore we must try and behave in a way in which we would want our
kids to behave.&nbsp;&nbsp; as well as remember that often (because nothing
is a hard and fast rule) &#39;bad&#39; behavior is learned and if it wasn&#39;t learned
it probably developed because the child hasn&#39;t found a way to express her/his
self and find a resolution to the frustrations they naturally experience.&nbsp;
(this is just my opinion).
<p>the next thing to take into account is the stage the child is at.&nbsp;
deepak chopra wrote a book <u>the seven spiritual laws for parents</u>
.&nbsp; he says the &#39;preschool, 2-5 yrs.&nbsp; key words: deserving, exploring,
approving&#39;&nbsp; he goes on to say:
<p>&#39;a toddler begins to realize that &quot;i am&quot; can expand to &quot;i can&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
once the ego realizes this, there is no stopping a two-year-old.&nbsp;
he thinks he has the whole world - and certainly everyone in the family
-&nbsp; by the tail.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;i&quot;&nbsp; is like a power generator just
plug it in, and what makes the two&#39;s terrible is that the newly born ego
surges with power in an undisciplined way.&nbsp;&nbsp; shouting, screaming,
running around, wielding the all-powerful <i>no!</i> and generally trying
to rule by sheer will - this is exactly what should be going at this stage.
<p>spiritually, the value of the preschool stage is that power is spiritual
- only the distortion of power leads to problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; so rather
than try to curb your child&#39;s rush to power, you need to channel it into
tasks and challenges that teach balance.&nbsp;&nbsp; without being balanced
the power hunger of a preschooler will run into grief, because her experience
is largely the illusion of power.&nbsp; a ranting two-year-old is still
a very tiny, vulnerable, uninformed person.&nbsp;&nbsp; in our love for
the child, we allow the illusion to exist, because we want her to grow
up a strong, capable person who feels up to any challenge that comes along.&nbsp;&nbsp;
this sense of self-esteem won&#39;t develop if the feeling of being powerful
is shut down or repressed at this stage.&#39;
<p>ok i buy this, from my experience my son fits this description.&nbsp;&nbsp;
the next question would be:&nbsp; how do you fulfill your own needs?&nbsp;&nbsp;
we all know that if we neglect our own needs its not good for anyone!&nbsp;
the situation you conveyed is a clash of your needs and his need to express
his power -&#39;the all-powerful <i>no!&#39;</i> so how would you keep this &quot;illusion
of power&quot; alive but get what you need and deserve?&nbsp; i would implement
something along the lines of what harville hendrix and helen hunt talk
about in their book (which i&#39;ve mentioned before) <u>giving the love that
heals: a parents guide</u>.&nbsp; they call it &#39;the process of intentional
dialogue - mirroring, validating and emphasizing&#39;.&nbsp; for me this really
fits in with my belief that you must balance trust, understanding and authority
or you compromise the parent/child relationship.
<p>so i would start out asking why he didn&#39;t want to go and repeat his
reasons back to him so he knew i understood his position.&nbsp; then i
would tell him that i really needed to go and ask him what he would like
so that it would make going enjoyable for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; by doing this
i believe you begin to foster trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; or i would say we have
to go that is not debatable (taking authority) but i would love to do something
you would enjoy afterwards and set up a situation were he had some power
(a combination of trust and understanding) and at the same time experiences
cooperation, which i believe is at the heart of this balance along with
compassion .&nbsp; i would tell him how much i appreciated and enjoyed
his cooperation and thank him for it.
<p>if he will not cooperate (which happens a lot:) and has a fit, i would
not punish him, i would answer the questions i had asked him myself.&nbsp;
i would tell him i know you like playing some game (i would stay clear
of buy toys or fast food because then you wander into the realm of bribery
and are really teaching them how to manipulate instead of cooperate- not
a good skill) or convey to him that when you get home he can have some
alone uninterrupted time where he can be the all-powerful one calling all
the shots.&nbsp; so i think acknowledging the bad behavior is important
but assume that he will want to do the right thing he just doesn&#39;t know
how, yet.
<p>i think one of the biggest mistakes parents and adults in general make
is assuming that a child&#39;s motives are the same as an adult&#39;s.&nbsp; i
firmly believe this is not true.&nbsp; the example joshua gave regarding
cruelty to animals, i believe a child doesn&#39;t necessarily mean to cause
harm (there are however always exceptions and that&#39;s why parents must know
their children) they are merely experiencing the world, learning fantasy
and reality, learning about power - &#39;i can but should i?&#39;.&nbsp; so when
we are making decisions regarding children we must make sure we are not
viewing them as adults but as children who need adults in their lives so
they can safely move toward adulthood and have the experience that will
best foster this journey.
<p>well i&#39;ve gone on long enough and i thinks it&#39;s obvious i could and
(would be happy to:) keep going:)&nbsp; so if something is unclear i could
expand upon it.&nbsp; i hope this is what you where after.

<br/>
this thread has been so interesting, thanks susan and joshua and others.  i <br/>
like being able to be sparked by something i have read during my day (from <br/>
the list) with my children and then play around with the idea while in the <br/>
midst of the challenges.   my just turned four year old didnt want to go in <br/>
to the Y with me tonite when i pulled up to go walk on the treadmill for <br/>
20min.  i had been playing with these thoughts and others and have recently <br/>
gotten both the alfie kohn book, and raising your child not by force..., so i <br/>
was much slower than usual to use my &quot;lets go in NOW, im going to count to <br/>
3-- and you will lose your priveleges, blah blah blah&quot; these  unenlightened <br/>
tactics sound so pitiful as i type, but in reality helps me get thru the day <br/>
bc it brings cooperation.  i did end up going this route though, after i <br/>
decided that it was important to me to walk, and also, he had no reason that <br/>
he or i could find to not go in-- just that he didnt want to.  so i was a <br/>
lovely picture entering the nursery with 21mo old clinging to my neck and 4yr <br/>
old clinging to my leg.  (ive just gone 2wice before and my 4yo is quite <br/>
social and usually loves the opp to play, etc)  anyway, the redeeming news is <br/>
that i was able to take the time to sit down in the nursery and play with <br/>
them a good 15min before i left them and they were comfortable by then.  <br/>
whew.  i guess what i am wondering after all that, is how another parent <br/>
(susan?) might have handled it.  i love all of the ideas in some of these <br/>
books but when it comes back to day to day stuff, many times i cant make <br/>
reality jive with what i have read.  and the more children i have added, the <br/>
looser my hold on the idealistic model has had to become....<br/>

&lt;&lt;What I mean ... is that I don&#39;t know if I want to spend that much time with <br/>
them, but if not, why not, and I think it&#39;s societal conditioning against <br/>
being with one&#39;s children, I hope you all understand cos I don&#39;t know how <br/>
clear I&#39;m being...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of the social conditioning against moms spending lots of times <br/>
with kids came from Freud.  And he was wrong about a lot of things.  Let&#39;s <br/>
re-examine this idea of his and get rid of it if it&#39;s not valid.<br/>
<br/>
A book that may help in working through this is _The Courage to Raise Good <br/>
Men_ by Olga Sivertstein.<br/>

hi,
<p>i don&#39;t think it&#39;s about living the books we&#39;ve read or integrating
the philosophies because that&#39;s too mental.&nbsp; you shouldn&#39;t have to
plan how you act with anyone especially your kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; kids have
great bs detectors and will know when you&#39;re &#39;on shaky ground&#39; - that&#39;s
part of the challenge.&nbsp; the reason i read lots of different philosophies
is so i can have a picture of how i would like my life to be and what kind
of relationship i want with my kids.&nbsp; coming from a highly dysfunctional
family this was crucial for me so i could consciously make different choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;
being true to who you are and at the same time desire something different
may sound contradictory but i think it is necessary to see them as actually
complementary.&nbsp; you have to be equally compassionate and understanding
with yourself as you are with your kids - don&#39;t hold either up to a standard
of &#39;the right way to be&#39; just desire honesty and contentment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
the more you accept the way things are -without harsh judgment, and the
more you have a clear idea of what you want then just live your life, the
more you are able to behave in a way that feels natural and promotes happiness
in everyone.
<p>the first few years of being a mom i spent feeling like a utter failure.&nbsp;
then i got sick and couldn&#39;t be a mom because i couldn&#39;t literally move
use my arms.&nbsp; the good side of this was it gave me time to get my
priorities straight.&nbsp; i realized it has nothing to do with getting
it right or being wrong but about loving being who you are, as you are
right now and modeling that for your kids.&nbsp; whether it&#39;s washing poopie
diapers (something honestly i couldn&#39;t wait to do after being sick:)&nbsp;
or watching or hearing about some fascinating discovery, be happy with
it - recognizing the potential to be happy in every situation.&nbsp; screwing
up is fine because it&#39;s real and honest and if you can accept yourself
and continue loving yourself after a big screw up then just think of the
love and compassion you are modeling for your kids - essentially you are
saying: venture out,&nbsp; get it right or wrong,&nbsp; it doesn&#39;t matter
because you did something, you challenged yourself and that&#39;s always a
good thing.
<p>this has been the way i&#39;ve done things.&nbsp; i screw up and we argue
you and get frustrated and i shake my head at the way i respond but i never
get judgemental - i do acknowledge it and think, i wish i handled it differently
but then i just move on and i do the same with everyone in my life.
