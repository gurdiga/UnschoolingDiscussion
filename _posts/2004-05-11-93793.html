<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106150148">Lately about something or other someone used a phrase that had been used with <br/>
memorable meanness toward me, and when I mentioned it the point was made that <br/>
that person was not my mother.<br/>
<br/>
Very true!<br/>
<br/>
Still, I think if smoke detectors are any use to the world, it is that they <br/>
sound their alarm whether there&#39;s a definite fire or maybe just almost a reason <br/>
to believe there&#39;s a fire.<br/>
<br/>
There are other phrases I don&#39;t think are useful outside the subset of human <br/>
behavior involving the putting down of children and the gleeful victory of <br/>
parents.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shut up or I&#39;ll give you something to cry about.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stay in that bed or... [you&#39;ll be sorry].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Give her a taste of her own medicine.&quot;<br/>
(Used to recommend treating children the way they&#39;ve treated us or someone <br/>
else, as in biting them back or pulling their hair or breaking something THEY <br/>
loved because they&#39;ve broken something else.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Act your age.&quot;  <br/>
(Not often used of teenagers; when teenagers act their age they are insulted <br/>
for thinking they know everything, that they&#39;re grown, that they&#39;re &quot;too big <br/>
for their britches,&quot; or something else to indicate you want them to act like <br/>
the age of their younger sibling.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not your slave / servant / maid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;His mother waits on him hand and foot.&quot;  (NEVER said admiringly, but <br/>
derisively, usually to someone his age whose mother [often the speaker] does NOT <br/>
&quot;wait on him&quot; and is finding the virtue in it.  Goes with a prediction of how <br/>
helpless the other one will be and how spoiled because someone is not telling him <br/>
to do things himself, she&#39;s not his slave/servant/maid.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you want that done, you can do it yourself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always liked the idea I had inside me that those kinds of phrases were <br/>
fading from  awareness.   I think it&#39;s just that I was hanging around with <br/>
humans who had either not had those phrases used on them or who had chosen not to <br/>
use them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
But if I hear a thoughtless phrase or if I read one and it comes out in my <br/>
mom&#39;s voice, or HER mom&#39;s voice (I&#39;ll blister your butt; if you know what&#39;s good <br/>
for you; it doesn&#39;t matter what you want, you&#39;re going to do what I say), my <br/>
alarm goes off.   And it&#39;s rare that my alarm goes off in and around <br/>
unschooling discussions.  So if it was just the steam from the shower, or grilled <br/>
cheese sandwiches or whatever, and not really a harsh attitude toward children, <br/>
that&#39;s great.  Better that it goes off too much than never.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62634065">But I wonder if these messages seem more or less offensive based on how you<br/>
heard them in your childhood.  When someone says &quot;I&#39;m not a short-order<br/>
cook&quot;, I assume they simply mean they don&#39;t want to cook a bunch of seperate<br/>
meals.....not that they feel resentful and mean towards their child.<br/>
<br/>
But I was lucky enough to have a very loving, happy childhood.  And I think<br/>
that makes a difference.  When I hear the above statement, it isn&#39;t like<br/>
picking the scab off an old wound like it would be if people had said it<br/>
with ill intent to me as a child .<br/>

Oh yes.<br/>
<br/>
That was so much a part of the wallpaper of my childhood that it didn&#39;t even <br/>
come to mind as a memorable phrase.    <br/>
<br/>
Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, though.  I&#39;ll add it to my list of things not to say.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When it&#39;s said to the child and the child hears resentfulness, does it<br/>
matter whether the mom is feeling resentful or whether she&#39;s saying what<br/>
sounds like a reasonable remark to her?<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;That&#39;s your mess. You&#39;ll need to clean it up,&quot; to my daughter when<br/>
she was small and it sounded like a reasonable fact of life: that we&#39;re<br/>
responsible for our own messes. But when she said it to me about something I<br/>
spilled it didn&#39;t sound reasonable. It sounded mean and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s<br/>
exactly how I sounded to her.<br/>
