<div id="ygrps-yiv-983370274">Well, today was the day.<br/>
I didn&#39;t think it would happen to me, but social services came a knockin&#39;.<br/>
Fortunately, we were busy visiting some unschoolers that are moving to Turkey <br/>
and he simply left his card. So I have time to calmly prepare myself.<br/>
He represents the school board, not the branch of social services that deals <br/>
with neglect/abuse. He wrote &quot;I need to talk to you about Trevor and Jareds <br/>
school attendance&quot;<br/>
So obviously a nosy neighbor turned us in or something.<br/>
I am not registered. Have not been for over two years. BUT, I took Sandra&#39;s <br/>
advice and got all my paperwork in order back in November, so I will simply <br/>
overnight the forms to the umbrella school I chose. The notarized date will <br/>
reflect November, so I don&#39;t think anything will come of it.<br/>
IF they even need proof. He may not ask...who knows. <br/>
UGH.<br/>

Thanks Marji...you don&#39;t know how much I just need to know my unschooling <br/>
friends are out there.<br/>
I feel so strange about this. I&#39;m not really scared or anything, I know it <br/>
will blow over. But I feel betrayed. Like someone we knew had it in for us. <br/>
It&#39;s not going to change the way I live, but I will wonder just who to trust!!<br/>
He knew the boys names. That unnerved me a bit. Also proved it wasn&#39;t a <br/>
casual drive by observer...had to be someone that knows us.<br/>

Make him his own fine photocopies, though, definitely, whether you send them <br/>
to an umbrella school or not!  Wrap them up in a ribbon.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Sounds like a routine deal, but I wonder why he didn&#39;t call?  Maybe he just <br/>
had the address but no phone number?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was from me. I forgot to sign the email. Pardon my questioning things, <br/>
like homeopathy and not registering, but if I sat back and never questioned <br/>
anything, I probably would still be a slave to compulsory schooling. So I am <br/>
asking why not? Why not comply with the system, why not play it safe and <br/>
avoid such a conflict? Why take a risk of putting your family through an <br/>
ordeal by the very people I would rather keep out of my life involving my <br/>
children&#39;s whereabouts during the day? I am not questioning you to put you on <br/>
the defensive, I am sure this is not a good situation and you need to focus <br/>
your energies on it, and I am sympathetic. I wouldn&#39;t wish it on anyone. <br/>
<br/>
 But again, I need to question why you questioned just doing what you were <br/>
supposed to do. Maybe everyone else already knows, but I am interested in <br/>
your motive. <br/>

I was assuming that.<br/>
Which makes the neighbors that moved in next door suspect. I didn&#39;t think <br/>
they knew the kids names though.<br/>
The other neighbors I was suspicious of (their kids like being down here <br/>
entirely too much and I think it pisses the Mom off) know our phone number.<br/>
But maybe it&#39;s routine to just show up at the door when they get a phone call.<br/>

that the guy is from. She said it&#39;s very routine and probably no big deal at <br/>

<br/>
Were you ever registered in that county before?    I think it&#39;s harder to<br/>
go underground if you&#39;ve once been registered in the same county.<br/>
<br/>
A woman here had that happen to her.   The county superintendent was<br/>
looking for her name to give to another mom who was homeschooling and<br/>
noticed she wasn&#39;t currently registered.     I guess it&#39;s not the custom<br/>
to just send a letter asking for particulars. <br/>

I think taxpayers (meaning in this instance people who have no kid yet pay <br/>
property taxes that support schools) want their money&#39;s worth, and for <br/>
childless people especially, they don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass about the future <br/>
earning power of an eight year old, they want their six hours of child-free <br/>
life in the middle of each day (as they think &quot;each day&quot; but it&#39;s only 180 <br/>
days at best).  <br/>
<br/>
If they see kids during school hours, if they hear them, then what use wa <br/>
their paying all that tax money?<br/>
<br/>
But I hope none of your relatives would have turned you in.  Or relatives of <br/>
relatives.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s parents of other kids, it might be because they&#39;re just sick of their <br/>
kids saying &quot;Can&#39;t we stay home?  Ren&#39;s kids do.&quot;  And so they want to smite <br/>
you or at least sting you as retribution.<br/>

I&#39;m new to this group, and I just need to jump in here and put my 2 cents in on this issue.   :~)<br/>
First of all we still pay taxes even if we have children or not, and we also still pay land taxes even if our children are homeschooled/unschooled.<br/>
Secondly--- we as homeschooled/unschoolers are costing the schools money.The BOE recieves funds from many sources,besides our tax money. They get kickbacks from pharmacutical companies. i.e., for every child on ritalin or such, and for everychild in special education classes. The schools recieve grants for special education, hence the so called need for special education and ritalin,or other such drugs.<br/>
You can research this info in your local library. I found all my info in the homeschool section of the library.<br/>
You will be amazed at the kick backs they recieve and discover that public/private schools are simply a money making machine, all at the cost of our children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332693515">&lt;&lt;BUT, I took Sandra&#39;s advice and got all my paperwork in order back in <br/>
November, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So Sandra, what was your advice?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, bot Ren and Dave & Nancy who are here had done the same thing so it&#39;s <br/>
kinda cool that it DID help.<br/>
<br/>
Left over from some New Mexico policy that&#39;s no longer in effect, it was this:<br/>
<br/>
Get the forms filled out, get them notarized so you have an official date on <br/>
them, make copies of the forms that you can give to relatives or neighbors or <br/>
anybody, and just don&#39;t send the original to the state (or district or <br/>
wherever your law says it goes, but here it was state).  Just put the <br/>
original somewhere safe.  County landfill,  under the couch...<br/>
<br/>
But IF someone wants proof of your registration, show them the copies with <br/>
the date.  Say, &quot;Look, I have copies.  Do you want one?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can send a copy to the state later if they say &quot;We don&#39;t have your <br/>
registration.&quot;<br/>
You say &quot;Oh.  Sorry.  Here&#39;s a copy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since at their end they have some minimum wage file clerk in charge of <br/>
opening envelope and putting the papers in a filing cabinet, their failure to <br/>
produce a copy could easily mean mail problem, mis-file, loss under THEIR <br/>
couch or in the landfill, but if they have a copy to put in the file, then <br/>
they have their copy, legally dated before whatever deadline it was.<br/>
<br/>
The reason people were doing that here was they could show that they had <br/>
written their intent to homeschool in time, but it didn&#39;t actually get their <br/>
kid&#39;s name on the to-be-tested list.  <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s something to distribute to suspicious relatives.<br/>
<br/>
I always recommended not lying.  Don&#39;t say &quot;We sent it.&quot;  Just say &quot;I have a <br/>
copy, do you want one?&quot;  Because that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>

to them. I think she needs to &quot;make them think&quot; a bit---and have them see her <br/>
as a &quot;nice guy&quot; who&#39;s doing the best for her kids. This *could* hapen again, <br/>
but if the neighbors know how sweet she is (bread and a letter), maybe.....<br/>

I tend to let things go easier now than I used to...my temper has been a <br/>
struggle though, so it was nice to read your note!! Believe me, I had a tummy <br/>
ache for two days. I feel much better now.<br/>
AND, we got our rat babies last night.<br/>
My kids are having an absolute ball with their new friends. We have four <br/>
girls that are busy wrecking havoc on the house. :)<br/>
The people that delivered them were really interesting.<br/>
The guy had a bunch of interests similar to Trevor and they spent their time <br/>
talking, playing chess and looking at things online. I think he learned more <br/>
in one night than most kids do in several months!! It was a great experience.<br/>
And the kids are SO protective and sweet with their baby rats. This was a <br/>
good thing to do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well thanks for giving me some reason why not to register, since no one else <br/>
will address my questions.  Here in Ohio, they don&#39;t require testing, we just <br/>
have a portfolio review done by an unschooling friendly certified teacher. <br/>
When I notified, it was recommended to send it certified so they couldn&#39;t <br/>
claim they didn&#39;t get it and use it against me. Without further insight from <br/>
someone willing to explain it, I can&#39;t see trying to get away with something. <br/>
I have an open mind and it&#39;s a shame that someone can&#39;t broaden my horizons. <br/>
I mean, do I really have to get a driver&#39;s license? I have no doubt of my <br/>
abilities to drive, I didn&#39;t *need* driver&#39;s ed, so why should I have to <br/>
register my car and renew my tags every year? I am a responsible driver, why <br/>
should I have to get the county&#39;s permission?  I&#39;m not willing to suffer the <br/>
consequences of not doing what is required. <br/>
