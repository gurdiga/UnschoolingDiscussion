<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768055233">I just recently joined this list and have up until now only been <br/>
lurking and learning.  You have all been so insightful and <br/>
inspiring.  I am also new to unschooling.  We have 5 children.  The <br/>
two oldest are in school dd14 and ds11.  Our last three will be <br/>
unschooled ds5, ds3 and dd16mths.  I have really begun to believe <br/>
that unschooling isn&#39;t just a method of homeschooling, but rather a <br/>
way of life.  This brings me to my concern.  We have always had a <br/>
specific bedtime for the kids.  Lately, however, it is increasingly <br/>
more difficul to keep the 3yr old in bed.  They go to bed between 9 <br/>
and 9:30, but he is still up and running at 10:30 or sometimes <br/>
later.  I try not to get frustrated with him, but it is not always <br/>
easy.  I let them get up in the morning on their own.  What are your <br/>
thoughts on letting kids go to bed when they want to when they are <br/>
young children?  Sorry if this seems really basic to most of you, but <br/>
like I said we are really new to unschooling.  I&#39;m still trying to <br/>
convince dh that unschooling is not just about education.  <br/>
Thank you<br/>

<br/>
I would tell the husband &quot;It&#39;s all about learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And one thing to learn is that it&#39;s easier to sleep when one is sleepy, and <br/>
if one&#39;s awake, trying to force sleep or bed only serves to frustrate, to <br/>
create aversion to sleep/bed, or to cause resentment.  That&#39;s all learning, <br/>
but it&#39;s not the best of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Can the youngest go to sleep to a long, peaceful video?  Tototro, or Winnie <br/>
the Pooh or something?  If you can set the VCR to turn off afterward, problem <br/>
solved.<br/>
<br/>
I had kids go to sleep to movies when they weren&#39;t tired enough to sleep, <br/>
when they were young.  Now they stay up doing whatever quiet things they want.<br/>
<br/>
They always go to bed, every night.  They get to choose when.  But it helps <br/>
that we have a bigger house than we used to, too.<br/>

My DS will be 4 in May and my DD just turned 2 last<br/>
week.  We don&#39;t have -- and never did -- have a set<br/>
&quot;bed time&quot;.  Some days we go to bed close to 10 pm,<br/>
but it&#39;s pretty normal in our house to go to bed well<br/>
after midnight.  We sleep until 8 or 9 most mornings.<br/>
<br/>
We see no reason to have a bed time -- we go to bed<br/>
when we&#39;re tired.  HTH  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564246462">I personally let my ten year old set her own timeline for bed but my two year old needs more direction in this area. She gets really overtired if not asleep by 7:30. She has forsaken her nap time now, which works fine but when it is bedtime, it needs to be bedtime for her. She has reacted well to my guidance responding to our nightime rituals of bathtime and booktime. My ten year old just loves to read her books at nightime and get some alone time with me and my dh.

That hasn&#39;t happened in a long time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m not sleepy, a movie or a book will get me quiet enough to be sleepy, <br/>
or if I&#39;m REALLY not sleepy, will provide enough stimulation to keep me from <br/>
waking other people up.<br/>
<br/>
It has seemed to be the same with my kids.  SOME stimulation will keep them <br/>
content to be alone (or the only one awake).<br/>
<br/>
Holly goes through phases.  Her room has TV & VCR with a remote control, CD & <br/>
tape players close enough to turn them off, she has access to a dog and three <br/>
cats who would love to sleep with her, and lately her preference is to close <br/>
her door, NO animals, and play gameboy until she&#39;s sleepy and then turn the <br/>
light off and go to sleep in the quiet.<br/>
<br/>
What is most important to me is that she has those choices, and so has <br/>
herself chosen to go to sleep in a dark room without input, at the time of <br/>
her choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909968793">Hello Jill,<br/>
<br/>
My ds is 2 1/2 and we have never had a specific bedtime.  He is usually asleep around 11.  After 9,  I keep all the lights in the house except a dim one so he starts to settle down.  We continue playing, reading books until he gets tired.  Then, he chooses a film and I breastfeed him while we watch the film.  He falls asleep and I transfer him to our bed.  If it is after 12, I close all the lights but leave his film on.  Then he falls asleep faster.  For him,  lightning seems to be very important.  He doesn&#39;t settle down unless it is dark.  I understand your frustration.  It has been very hard for me to let go of the idea that he should be in bed by a certain time.  Also, if I start to think of all the things I could do if he were in bed, I get frustrated.  I try to go with the flow and enjoy this time with him.  We have very special moments together that we wouldn&#39;t be having if he had to be in bed by 9.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
<br/>
Manon<br/>

I really like this idea. I have noticed that he settles a lot easier <br/>
when the lights are low and the TV in the living room isn&#39;t blaring.<br/>

<br/>
I guess that time after 9:00 was the only time I felt I could get <br/>
anything done also, but I spend more time running him back into his <br/>
room that I don&#39;t get anything done anyway.  Last night I put in a <br/>
movie and stayed to watch for a little while.  By the time I left he <br/>
was snuggled up and looking mighty tired.  Worked like a charm.  Lets <br/>
see what tonight brings.<br/>
