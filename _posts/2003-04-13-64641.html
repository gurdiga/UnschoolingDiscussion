For those of you who don&#39;t remember, it&#39;s about a girl in the mountains with <br/>
no school nearby.  A friend teaches her to read and then she teaches herself <br/>
to write after her friend moves away.  It&#39;s a good picture book on <br/>
unschooling, except for the sad references to their being no school.<br/>
