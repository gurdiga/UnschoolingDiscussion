<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051302344">Hello--I&#39;m a very recent addition to this list (about 2 minutes ago-<br/>
LOL). I did look around a bit and didn&#39;t see the info I&#39;m looking for <br/>
so I thought it wouldn&#39;t hurt to ask. I&#39;m sorry in advance if people <br/>
come on here and ask the same questions all the time. :) Anyway, I&#39;m <br/>
*very* interested in this for my son. I&#39;m not currently an unschooler <br/>
because I live in a state where it&#39;s very restrictive about <br/>
homeschooling. I&#39;m at a total loss as to where to begin finding out <br/>
the laws about unschooling here. Is there a website that covers every <br/>
states individual laws regarding this? So far what I&#39;ve found out is <br/>
that Virginia makes every homeschooler use a curriculum and submit <br/>
test scores to the state, but with unschooling I wouldn&#39;t be doing <br/>
that. That&#39;s where I need the help in finding out what I can do in <br/>
Virginia and still be within the law. Thanks so much for any links. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi everyone...had to come out of lurkdom for this one. :o) I am new to <br/>
hsing (my oldest son is 5 and supposed to start kindergarten in the fall) <br/>
and am starting to get comfortable with the idea of unschooling <br/>
(thanks partly to seeing unschooling as an extension of the way that<br/>
I am currently parenting, but mostly because of the wonderful discussions<br/>
on this list - arguments and all!).<br/>
<br/>
As far as hsing in Virginia...the laws are a little confusing at first, <br/>
but in reality seem pretty livable (not the best, but definitely not the <br/>
worst) and from what I have seen on our state email list many unschoolers<br/>
have been able to manage. Without getting into too many specifics of the <br/>
Virginia law here, there are 4 options for applying and for the most part<br/>
where they say describe the curriculum you can get away with a couple of <br/>
sentences describing the type of resources you are going to use (library, <br/>
reading, field trips, etc) keeping it very generic. As far as the testing <br/>
goes...you do have to show &quot;proof of progress&quot; for 1st grade on up, however<br/>
it is not as bad as it sounds. You can either pull together a portfolio for <br/>
evaluation or take a standardized test (must score at least a 23%). <br/>
From what I have read, most unschoolers seem to choose the testing as it is <br/>
the least intrusive (finding an evaluator who understands unschooling can be <br/>
tricky). They just do not put any importance on the tests.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not belong already, I would suggest joining the Virginia Eclectic<br/>
Hsing email list:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Not everyone is an unschooler, but there are many on there who might be<br/>
able to help with your questions. This is also a great resource for any<br/>
questions that you might have with dealing with state law. I know that they<br/>
helped put my fears to rest.<br/>
<br/>
You should also check out the following websites for more great info on hsing<br/>
in Virginia. They are very informative:<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I hope that this helps! Feel free to email me off-list if you have any questions.<br/>
I do not claim to have all the answers, but I might be able to point you in the right<br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
And now I return to my lurkdom to enjoy and learn. :o)<br/>

<br/>
There are unschoolers in every state.<br/>
<br/>
There are no laws specifically about unschooling, but you&#39;ll be able to find <br/>
people local to you.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, have a look at this:  <br/>
