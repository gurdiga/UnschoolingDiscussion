hi,
<p>i&#39;m not versed if the &#39;unschooling approach&#39; to math but we just started
with miquon math.&nbsp;&nbsp; i find the philosophy and approach to be
child lead .&nbsp; we&#39;ve also used the anno&#39;s math games and the other
books by mitsumasa anno which my son (4yo)&nbsp; loved.&nbsp; my son is
really into math (he says he was born a scientist) and loves books so we
just got some books written by theoni pappas which are math stories that
introduce all kinds of math topics often very &#39;advanced&#39; but he wants to
read more and more of the stories.&nbsp; also regarding adult level books
you can check out naturalmath.com they have a reading list one book i got
which they recommended is:&nbsp; <u>a beginner&#39;s guide to constructing
the universe</u> by michael s. schneider.&nbsp; i&#39;m <u>really</u> bad at
math.&nbsp; i am dyslexic and math (as well as reading and spelling:) is
one of the areas i am truly poor at, but now i have a son who says he can&#39;t
really understand science until he knows math so i&#39;m learning right along
with him:)
<p>like i said i don&#39;t know what is meant but &#39;unschooling math&#39; i&#39;ve seen
books in the holt catalog along this line but i&#39;ve not gotten them because
my son loves doing math from cd-rom, books etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; so it seems
to just be happening of its own accord that&#39;s why i believe it&#39;s unschooling:)&nbsp;
the reason i&#39;m reading books about math myself is that i want to be able
to choose wisely the kind of thing which will broaden his mind and not
something that will close it off.
<p>here&#39;s an excerpt from <u>notes to teachers</u> by lore rasmussen of
miquon math materials:
<p>&#39;notations such as numerals and operational symbols come alive only
through the active human mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; yet, arithmetic is often taught
as if these symbols were the only way in which certain relationships can
be expressed.&nbsp;&nbsp; our numerals and other notations are arbitrary
choices of preceding generations in our culture to express man&#39;s thinking
about numerical and non-numerical relationships among physical phenomena.&nbsp;&nbsp;
every generation of thinkers in a dynamic, forward moving culture must
scrap, supplement, and revise this symbolism in order to express with more
precision and power its new understanding and mastery over universal relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;
therefore, it is of utmost importance that even on the most elementary
level of mathematics education, an atmosphere is fostered in which ideas
may be explored and new symbols may be invented.&#39;
<p>also she says: &#39;...we learn children&#39;s capabilities and interests directly
from them.&#39;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8766345">My now 7 yo loves math and did all the Anno&#39;s Math Games books at around<br/>
4-5, and has done some generic workbook type stuff that he has found in<br/>
stores since then.  Now that he can do addition, subtraction,<br/>
multiplication, division (although long division is still kind of<br/>
mystifying for him), fraction work and decimal stuff, he&#39;s satisfied.  He<br/>
still doesn&#39;t know most of his &quot;facts&quot; but I figure he&#39;s only 7 and he&#39;ll<br/>
pick them up when he needs them.<br/>
<br/>
So for &quot;math&quot; for the past 6 months or so, we have played games that use<br/>
mathematical reasoning.....now, he won&#39;t play with me because there is no<br/>
challenge; I lose every time (chess, checkers, Othello, Goh, Mastermind,<br/>
etc).  And so, he is reading biographies of scientists and explanations of<br/>
how they arrived at their theories with is father, much of which involves<br/>
math.  Currently, it&#39;s Newton.  <br/>
<br/>
My 4 yo just started adding using his fingers and my older son got the<br/>
bright idea that this would be the best time to teach him about<br/>
multiplication, since it is really just addition.  So, now the 4 yo is<br/>
multiplying some things.<br/>
<br/>
I looked into Miquon when my older son was 6 but he was too advanced to<br/>
really use it at that point.<br/>
<br/>
We practiced multiplying (by 6&#39;s) when we were shopping since our local<br/>
tax rate is 6%.  And we practiced estimating in all forms while grocery<br/>
shopping.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how we unschool math.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, my son went through a period where he wanted quite difficult math<br/>
workbooks and the more &quot;interactive&quot; ones bored him.  He wanted row after<br/>
row of math problems.  So, I got him a workbook and he worked through the<br/>
pretests until he hit one that he got fewre than 90% correct.  Then he<br/>
started on the chapter, skipping what was easy, and spent a few weeks<br/>
&quot;doing math&gt;&quot;  I say it is odd because I HATED math and just can&#39;t see<br/>
someone enjoying doing it that way.  He&#39;d finished with that stage for<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
We have worked on reading skills in much the same way.  Recently skimming<br/>
text for specific information.....he has learned to skim the ingredeients<br/>
in prepackaged foods to see if they contain any form of milk.......and has<br/>
transferred that skill to the dictionary and other books to find specific<br/>
info.<br/>

hi,
<p>i don&#39;t think books are the problem or what makes the difference between
unschooling and schooling.&nbsp; imo it the disregard for the child&#39;s ability
to know: what s/he wants to learn,&nbsp; how it will be learned , at what
pace it&#39;s learned , etc.&nbsp; books are just vehicles of knowledge, a
vehicle to acquire knowledge the child is seeking.&nbsp; holt even says
in <u>teach your own</u> if your child wants to learn a subject in which
you don&#39;t know anything about get a textbook and learn it with him/her,
or let the child&nbsp; learn on her/his own or find someone else to help
the child pursue the knowledge that is of interest.
<p>i am a bit confused at what other see as unschooling.&nbsp; my understanding
is that you use whatever the child wanted to use, nature, workbook etc.,
it doesn&#39;t matter.&nbsp; it isn&#39;t our place to judge the method, just our
place to provide the stimulation and access to that which the child is
seeking.

hi nance,
<p>i&#39;m sorry i&#39;m being dense, but what makes something more un or less
un and what is your own personal definition (perspective)?&nbsp; i&#39;ve read
the posts and i&#39;m curious - why you said in response to my post - <i>I

wondering if you would be kind enough to elaborate on your personal views,

view things and enjoy shifting and expanding my own perspective by hearing

You&#39;re right.  That is what I&#39;m aiming for - providing the opportunity for my <br/>
kids to find what they&#39;re seeking.  You know, that old &quot;strewing their path <br/>
with interesting things&quot;.  My problem is that everytime we get the workbooks <br/>
out it reminds me of school.  It doesn&#39;t bother the kids at all.  It&#39;s just <br/>
MY problem.  sigh...   School sure does leave long-lasting marks on those of <br/>
us who have been through it.  <br/>

Well, I don&#39;t want to upset anyone.  I just think some people are more un -- <br/>
to me that means they absolutely do not approve of using, for example, <br/>
textbooks, or workbooks or anything at all school-y.  Then I think there are <br/>
people who are less un -- a little more like me perhaps -- who use a mix of <br/>
things -- but don&#39;t exactly, or at all, fit in the school-at-home category -- <br/>
don&#39;t follow a curriculum but see some value in using the content of a <br/>
textbook or workbooks or whatever as needed.  And everyone seems to define <br/>
the un-ness of their own situation a little differently.  There are many <br/>
shades of grey here.  But I don&#39;t think any of them are necessarily wrong.  <br/>
Just that one of the nice things I have noticed about unschooling is a <br/>
general tendency to accept fellow-unschoolers no matter how more or less un <br/>
we may be.  That&#39;s all I was trying to say -- you are using materials that <br/>
some unschoolers would not use -- but that doesn&#39;t make you any less an <br/>
unschooler than the next guy.  By my definition.  But it might not fit how <br/>
the next unschooler descibes herself.  How&#39;s that for vague??  But that&#39;s <br/>
what is so nice about unschooling -- taking what you need and using it and <br/>
developing your own personal takes on different situations and changing (as <br/>
you suggest) as you grow and are exposed to others&#39; ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

In our house, this is what I consider unschooling math:<br/>
we have a multiplication table hung up near our kitchen table where we eat <br/>
all our meals; we have tupperware addition flash cards( that give the answer <br/>
when you insert the card into the case) in the car; we have Monopoly, several <br/>
chess sets, a chess computer game; a fraction chart in the bathroom, <br/>
Stratego, Battleship (the only war-related items in the house, I promise!); <br/>
we make pancakes from a LLL recipe several times a week-more fractions! We <br/>
are on a limited budget and have 4 children who each want a fair share of # <br/>
of turns at a game, pieces of pizza and cake, and cookies out of the box, so <br/>
the opportunities are endless to learn division and multiplication! We also <br/>
bought a few $1.50 &quot;We&#39;ll Be Back at _o&#39;clock&quot; plastisigns that businesses <br/>
stick in their front doors b/c the toy teaching clocks are $15! We put 5, 10, <br/>
