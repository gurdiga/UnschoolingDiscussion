Yes Mary you are right... I&#39;m very opinionated when it comes to something <br/>
that really sets me off and definately not PC about it, but then again I <br/>
guess that&#39;s why I&#39;m bucking the system and starting out on this unschooling <br/>
journey.<br/>
<br/>
A word of warning to all on this unschooling list, I can be very direct, to <br/>
the point, some may think downright rude and inpolite.  So when a subject <br/>
catches my attention I&#39;m going to be very outspoken about it.... Whether <br/>
people like the way I write or not, is not my concern... It&#39;s important that <br/>
I say what I need to say...<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I read something I don&#39;t like it sets off something in me and the <br/>
&quot;obey&quot; did it in this case.  Having been around extremely opressed religious <br/>
women in my life that have obeyed to the point of being physically, mentally, <br/>
emotionally and spiritually raped this is a hot button with me.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the stories I hear in my volunteer work with abused women, come from <br/>
being married to very religious men who expect obedience.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There you go Dawn. . . as I was trying to say and maybe did not get my point <br/>
over very well. . . when my(our) buttons are pushed, I find it a great <br/>
opportunity time. . . time to reflect and do some healing around that issue. <br/>
I sure cannot say for others what the opportunity is. . .hell, I have a hard <br/>
time figuring it out for me. . . but I DO know it is there. The things we get <br/>
the most upset about are opportunitites for us. If we are pointing the finger <br/>
at someone else, there are always three fingers pointing back at us. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I appreciate your directness, and Sandra&#39;s and others here as well. . <br/>
. I know I can learn a lot from it as I tend to avoid confrontations like the <br/>
plague. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538666577">But not all christian women who obey their husbands are abused. I have known<br/>
people like you have spoken of and it breaks my heart. That is not Godliness<br/>
it is opression. My marriage is nothing like that. My husband and I are<br/>
partners. We work out our differences. Sometimes I change my mind. Sometimes<br/>
he changes his. I don&#39;t disagree with him publicly, but will discuss issues<br/>
with him in private. Often he will understand and change his mind. He has a<br/>
certain wisdom on some things I do not. I rely and trust in him. He has<br/>
never laid a violent hand upon me. My &quot;obedience&quot; comes out of love and<br/>
respect for my husband, not fear and intimidation. I believe that is more<br/>
like the model God had in mind, not a cowering woman vibrating in fear,but<br/>
a confident woman who is strengthened and empowered by the relationship she<br/>
has with her husband.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It really is something to keep in mind, Dawn.  Thanks for reminding us all.<br/>
<br/>
We all come to this list with our own experiences.  I haven&#39;t worked with <br/>
battered women and am in a marriage where &quot;obey&quot; wasn&#39;t part of the vows.  <br/>
So, my perspective is bound to be different from others&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I personally think is extremely honest and helpful in <br/>
understanding what the other person is saying is to know where they are <br/>
coming from.  <br/>
<br/>
Hard to do all at once on an email list.<br/>
<br/>
But after a while, you do sort of get a feel for who will likely come down on <br/>
which side on any given issue.<br/>
<br/>
Other lists that have political or economic discussions -- you just know Hank <br/>
will pop up with his theory of the evils of big government and Jake will talk <br/>
about the evils of big corporations.  Then you hear them talk about a few <br/>
issues and you find out Hank is his local Republican/Libertarian whatever and <br/>
Jake is head of the local ACLU branch. :)<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you didn&#39;t know that about them going in and they are reluctant to <br/>
tell you where they are coming from you spend a lot of time sorting out how <br/>
they could be so dumb as to hold a view contrary to yours! :)<br/>
<br/>
Labels are bad in this PC world of ours but disclosure of who we are and <br/>
where we are coming from seems honest to me.  <br/>
<br/>
The truly honest discussion is one where we can realize what our own <br/>
prejudices are and how our own experiences are coloring our view of things <br/>
and where we can try to see both or all sides and explain our positions <br/>
beyond the scope of our personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
At least you ladies got me thinking this morning!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108903676">As a Christian woman, I can understand your point.  I have seen stuff<br/>
like this too.  But it is so not what the Bible teaches.  In fact, men<br/>
are told to honor and submit to their wives in scripture.  And men are<br/>
supposed to love their wives and treat them with the same care as they<br/>
treat their own bodies.  A lot of the references to women relate to the<br/>
culture they were in more than to universal commands.  Scripture clearly<br/>
teaches that Christian wives are fellow heirs with their husbands.  Men<br/>
who require obedience to the point of abuse are not full of the Holy<br/>
Spirit, but of a demonic spirit.  Jesus said whoever wishes to lead must<br/>
serve everyone.  Authority&#39;s purpose is to protect, not control. <br/>
Scripture teaches to respect the law of the land in the sense of being<br/>
submitted to authority, yet in many places just being a believer is<br/>
breaking the law.  So submission is more an attitude of listening and<br/>
honoring and considering another&#39;s opinion than slave-like obedience out<br/>
of fear.   And the Bible teaches we are a house for God to live in, and<br/>
we must treat that house with honor.  Unfortunately, many scriptures have<br/>
for centuries been taken out of their cultural and written context to<br/>
wield as a club to keep women under a male&#39;s control.<br/>

   In outlook express go to message at top toolbar. You will see create rule from message & block sender. You can either block all mail from a specific sender or create a rule that specifies certain things. If you block sender it goes to the deleted folder. if you create a rule youpick where it goes. I have folders named for different things so each of my lists goes to a seperate folder. You can also access message rules from the tools on the toolbar. <br/>
   Hope this helps,<br/>

    &gt; Well Daron, share that info would ya! :)     I use Outlook Express <br/>
    &gt; and I would love to know how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Um... download Eudora? I&#39;ve never used Outlook, for many reasons, and if<br/>
    you do use it, make sure you keep your anti-virus software up to date.<br/>
<br/>
    I do have another computer that has all the microsoft stuff on it, so if<br/>
    no one else knows I&#39;ll hook it up and see if I can figure it out...<br/>
<br/>

     In outlook express go to message at top toolbar. You will see create rule from message & block sender. You can either block all mail from a specific sender or create a rule that specifies certain things. If you block sender it goes to the deleted folder. if you create a rule youpick where it goes. I have folders named for different things so each of my lists goes to a seperate folder. You can also access message rules from the tools on the toolbar. <br/>
     Hope this helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633001154">I cant believe the lack of maturity on this list. Just about every post I read is an argument or sarcasm or putdowns...or a combination of the three. Can we possibly grow up a little and talk about...maybe...our children? Or are we too busy acting like children to manage this?<br/>
Please people<br/>

   I wouldn&#39;t worry so much about viruses. Just don&#39;t open attachments unless you&#39;re sure it&#39;s ok.I think her reason is that more viruses are created to go through outlook express.<br/>
   For example, I created a new rule for this group. I checked if the to line contains certain people &quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> &quot;send to a specified folder & I created a new folder named unschooling.com. You can use any key word, even a persons first name. You just have to check the correct box i.e from, to, etc..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597890529">He does not disagree with me in public. Does he obey me? If I ask him to do<br/>
something, most times he will. He asks me also. He does not give orders so<br/>
to speak. There has been a few occasions when I did not obey him, and when<br/>
he understood why, he saw the wisdom of my disobedience. no relationship is<br/>
perfect and takes work, patience, time comprimise and convictions. We are<br/>
united in the goals we have set for both our marriage and our family.<br/>

&gt; &gt; But not all christian women who obey their husbands are abused. I have<br/>
known<br/>
&gt; &gt; people like you have spoken of and it breaks my heart. That is not<br/>
Godliness<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is opression. My marriage is nothing like that. My husband and I are<br/>
&gt; &gt; partners. We work out our differences. Sometimes I change my mind.<br/>
Sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; he changes his. I don&#39;t disagree with him publicly, but will discuss<br/>
issues<br/>
&gt; &gt; with him in private. Often he will understand and change his mind. He<br/>
has a<br/>
&gt; &gt; certain wisdom on some things I do not. I rely and trust in him. He has<br/>
&gt; &gt; never laid a violent hand upon me. My &quot;obedience&quot; comes out of love and<br/>
&gt; &gt; respect for my husband, not fear and intimidation. I believe that is<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; &gt; like the model God had in mind, not a cowering woman vibrating in<br/>
fear,but<br/>
&gt; &gt; a confident woman who is strengthened and empowered by the relationship<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; &gt; has with her husband.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay...but in the same light...does he obey you? Does he disagree with you<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; public? If it&#39;s mutual, while it&#39;s not necessarily the model I would<br/>
choose<br/>
&gt; for a relationship, I certainly understand. If not--why not?<br/>
