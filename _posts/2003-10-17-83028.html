<br/>
I&#39;m sorry...it COULD have been funny, but it was obviously making fun of video gaming and such. Talks about a religious symbol in the window..which could mean anything, hell, it could have been a buddha right?<br/>
Nah, me thinks it was written by a conservative Christian again. I think someone should take a crack at an unschooling version. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ren, I think it was making fun of the commonly touted idea that children *must* have video games in order to develop their hand-eye coordination.  That these children have none indicates that their parents are short-changing (abusing!) them. (all for the sake of the parody, of course)<br/>

coordination, I&#39;ve never heard anyone say kids must have video games for<br/>
hand-eye coordination. Where have you heard that said?<br/>

I have. From a fad-ish perspective, one *must* have this thing or that<br/>
to accomplish some skill or task or to learn something.<br/>
<br/>
 When not having all of the bells and whistles and gismos that<br/>
mainstream schoolish fads say the kids should have, I have been looked<br/>
at with suspicion. I&#39;m not sure what it is people suspect...that by<br/>
not mindfully following the trends, I protect my children from the<br/>
&quot;real world?  Maybe they think my family just weird. Maybe the<br/>
homeschooling critics can&#39;t fathom a child having interests other than<br/>
what is the latest rage.  <br/>
<br/>
That is how I understood the poking at the absence of video games, and<br/>
the presence of books in the house. (implying that it isn&#39;t trendy for<br/>
kids in general to willingly read books for learning or pleasure, etc.)</div>

I didn&#39;t read the parody.<br/>
My point is that nobody has EVER said it&#39;s worth $250 for a game system and a <br/>
game for eye-hand co-ordination.<br/>
<br/>
The eye-hand coordination is just the only defense for video gaming that some <br/>
unimaginative people can come up with.  Because someone will say &quot;it&#39;s good <br/>
for eye-hand coordination, that&#39;s not the same as saying it&#39;s commonly <br/>
recommended that people need to get systems for eye-hand coordination.<br/>
<br/>
IN ANY CASE, here&#39;s my collection of people&#39;s writings and links on video <br/>
gaming and learning:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234234005">If it&#39;s commonly touted that families are either book people or <br/>
tv/technology/games people, and cannot be both, then I sure didn&#39;t realize it. <br/>
<br/>
       Our family (and the majority of folks we seem to know) live and learn <br/>
on the Power of Story continuum, in which libraries, literature, myth, <br/>
entertainment, allegory, satire, fantasy, music, theatre and games, puzzles, paradox <br/>
and the search for truth, beauty and the Meaning of Life all are intertwined.<br/>
<br/>
       Big readers, oh yes, but hardly Luddites. The whole house including <br/>
the kitchen is a liobrary with books EVERYWHERE -- except for the pianos and <br/>
big-screen tv and jazz cds and computers and movie closet and chess sets and <br/>
sewing machine and Scrabble and Monopoly boards and jewel cases full of computer <br/>
video games and stacks of newspapers and magazines (doubt all our Power of <br/>
Story clutter would pass muster on a CPS inspection, which is a very good reason <br/>
to keep them out imo!)  JJ<br/>

 Sandra, perhaps your ears have never heard that sentiment (and many many<br/>
video games cost considerably less than $250).  My ears *have* heard advice<br/>
and recommendations like that.  In my world, it is pretty common to hear<br/>
things like that.<br/>
<br/>
If a family does not have video games, there could be many reasons.  There<br/>
are a couple that seem to be the most popular, but you can be sure that<br/>
other families have different reasons that are completely valid *for their<br/>
families*.<br/>
<br/>
 The parody web site pretty much took many of the aspects of mainstream<br/>
parenting and satirized them.  There were several jokes that (mostly) only<br/>
homeschoolers would &#39;get&#39; because homeschoolers, even school-at-homers, tend<br/>
to think differently than the rest of the world.  The parody also seized on<br/>
several of the myths surrounding homeschooling and presented them as reality<br/>
and abuse.  Even many of the realities of a homeschooling family can be<br/>
twisted to appear as abusive and/or neglectful.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see the parody as slamming gaming and gamers...it was just another<br/>
instance of how this particular family differs from the average American<br/>
family.  The slam was on reporters who twist stories and details in order to<br/>
make their stories more interesting.<br/>

 ps...I haven&#39;t read your collection, so I&#39;m not going to comment on it.</div>
