&gt;So,  instead of saying to my daughter &quot;all that sugar<br/>
&gt;made you sleepless&quot; I  should say &quot;It might have been the red dye or the <br/>
&gt;neon<br/>
&gt;blue  coloring&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How about give her access to a light, some books, a DVD player, and not<br/>
&gt;worry about whether she&#39;s asleep or awake?   She has to figure it out  one <br/>
&gt;her<br/>
&gt;own, in her own way.  Having a running commentary about why she  SHOULD be<br/>
&gt;sleepier or SHOULD be asleep doesn&#39;t help her feel her own  feelings.  You <br/>
&gt;can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;feel her feelings, you can only guess.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, at night, she takes a DVD player with her and listens to books, or <br/>
leafs through picture books, sometimes draws pictures from Harry Potter or <br/>
Henry Bone. Now and then she gets back up and turns on the TV until she <br/>
falls asleep on the couch.<br/>
<br/>
Bedtime hasn&#39;t been an issue since I &quot;discovered&quot; unschooling.  On two <br/>
specific occasions, me sound asleep, her sleeplessness has gotten me up or <br/>
at least waked me. Once, she came to me at 4:00 complaining that she hadn&#39;t <br/>
been able to fall asleep all night, and wanting to get in bed with me. And <br/>
the other time, her stomach was really upset, with heartburn and nausea, and <br/>
I got up to help her calm down.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s see here. I&#39;m talking about three different &quot;Otter Pop/Homemade <br/>
popsicle&quot; binges. Two of them happened in the evening, and on both of those <br/>
nights, whether from sugar or artificial this and that, she was unable to <br/>
sleep in one case, and had an anxiety attack in another. The one where I <br/>
told her I was angry and thought she was inconsiderate, happened in the <br/>
afternoon and didn&#39;t affect her sleep. The afternoon binge was the last one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
do you think there&#39;s a difference between my saying &quot;don&#39;t eat so many otter <br/>
pops! too much sugar/dye/flavors. You&#39;ll make yourself sick&quot; and my saying <br/>
&quot;It was inconsiderate of you to eat all those otter pops when other people <br/>
in the family enjoy them, too.&quot; ? I&#39;m honesty asking.<br/>
<br/>
If a child&#39;s actions have a negative effect on the people/place around her, <br/>
can it legitimately be pointed out to the child?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984300372">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;do you think there&#39;s a difference between my saying &quot;don&#39;t eat so many<br/>

<br/>
Well I think there is a big difference. <br/>
<br/>
The first one is offering both a command, and some ideas that may or may not<br/>
be facts, but that could lead to a desire for further experimentation on the<br/>
part of the popsicle consumer - who would then be put in the position of<br/>
being considered disobedient or feeling rebellious. Also the first idea is<br/>
making another person the authority or arbiter of what feels good and well<br/>
to the first person. One of my goals with Jayn, and myself too, is that we<br/>
are able to make judgments about our own internal feelings of wellness<br/>
without the possibility of a reverse placebo effect.<br/>
<br/>
The second is also problematic for me because it is making a judgment of<br/>
another person, instead of making an observation and stating your own<br/>
feelings. I think it is a shame to have a child start thinking of themselves<br/>
as an inconsiderate person, and I would fear that it would become<br/>
self-fulfilling if it the child heard it often enough. <br/>
<br/>
Also you are speaking for everyone else in the family who may prefer to<br/>
speak for themselves. It seems a little similar to the &quot;Royal We&quot; that was<br/>
featuring in another recent thread - Mom saying &quot;we&quot; when she means herself.<br/>
<br/>
However expressing simply and clearly your own disappointment that the<br/>
flavors you liked were gone, as you did explain in another email on this<br/>
thread, sounds like the best course. I remember that email being light and<br/>
humorous sounding in comparison to the level of anger that *seems* to be<br/>
coming through in your description of your attitude towards the miscreant.<br/>
<br/>
By giving that information you are giving your child the opportunity next<br/>
time to possibly think &quot;this color are Mom&#39;s favorite, I&#39;ll leave them for<br/>
her&quot; and feel good about herself. Eventually she will make the connection<br/>
between being considerate with otter pops to being considerate with other<br/>
areas also, as she continues to see this being modeled in your family.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think you need to ask her?<br/>
Why do you think &quot;I needed to stop&quot; is to be followed by &quot;...ask&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
When you&#39;re awake at night, are you always sure why?  Sometimes I have  no <br/>
idea.  And she&#39;s a little girl.  Asking her might give her the  impression that <br/>
she&#39;s supposed to know, that it&#39;s normal for people to know why  they&#39;re <br/>
awake.  I think they&#39;re more likely to have no idea than to know  for sure.  She <br/>
might think there are right answers and wrong answers.   I don&#39;t think you <br/>
should talk to her about what you think or she thinks made her  feel sleepless on <br/>
any night, unless it&#39;s just conversational like  &quot;Do you  feel okay?&quot; or &quot;Do <br/>
you need to talk?&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes people are sleepless and you don&#39;t need to find a cause or  reason.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-do you think there&#39;s a difference between my saying &quot;don&#39;t eat so many  <br/>
otter <br/>
pops! too much sugar/dye/flavors. You&#39;ll make yourself sick&quot; and my  saying <br/>
&quot;It was inconsiderate of you to eat all those otter pops when other  people <br/>

 <br/>
No, not really.<br/>
&quot;You&#39;ll make yourself sick&quot; is rarely true as people traditionally use it. <br/>
And it comes to mean, basically, &quot;I HOPE YOU GET SICK,&quot; because if she eats  <br/>
that many and she doesn&#39;t make herself sick, mom loses.<br/>
 <br/>
In the second instance it&#39;s a true thing you said, but also more of a big  <br/>
deal than any box of otter pops could be worth, unless you had planned an otter  <br/>
pop party and you live twenty miles from town.  Maybe you could&#39;ve said &quot;I  <br/>
wished there had been a red one (or whatever color you said you like) when we  <br/>
got home, and I was disappointed.&quot;  That puts the emotional statement on  you, <br/>
not on her.  You&#39;re telling her how you were (disappointed) instead of  <br/>
telling her how she was (inconsiderate).  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-If a child&#39;s actions have a negative effect on the people/place around  <br/>
her, <br/>
can it legitimately be pointed out to the child?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Sure.<br/>
By &quot;legitimately&quot; you mean something, but it&#39;s not a clear way to ask it. <br/>
You could legitimately (depending on how you&#39;re bending the meaning) spank  <br/>
her, forbid otter pops forever, give away her pets and sell her bike.<br/>
You could legitimately hug and kiss her and take the really mature stance  <br/>
which is not to complain about not having an otter pop because you&#39;re an adult  <br/>
and should model how to act in cases of minor disappointment.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s your relationship with her that&#39;s at stake.  What others think is  <br/>
legitimate isn&#39;t as important as what you think is more important: her feelings  or <br/>
an otter pop.<br/>

<br/>
A coroborating example:<br/>
My son had two nights where he was in bed trying to sleep and couldn&#39;t. (Yes, he came in to see me, eventually.  One night, I think it was at 4.) This happened during the hottest days we&#39;ve had recently, which could have been a factor.  On the morning of the third day he reported having a sore gum, and further investigation revealed a molar getting lose.  In hindsight, he may have had some low grade tooth soreness when he had trouble sleeping, without being really aware of it.  Kids can also have minor (or major) pain from growing limbs, if they are growing quickly  Or in our case it could have been the heat.  Or the annoying sounds of the crickets outside the window (screechily audible even when the window is shut.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not as comfortable with the words &quot;correcting the child.&quot;  I&#39;m<br/>
more comfortable with the words &quot;giving the child useful information.&quot;<br/>
 It may just be a matter of semantics, but that slight shift in focus<br/>
has helped my relationship with my children and our unschooling lives<br/>
greatly.  &quot;Correction&quot; seems less respectful.<br/>
<br/>
I also like using &quot;I&quot; messages when I&#39;m giving a child emotional<br/>
information (like the information you might be going for with the<br/>
phrase, &quot;it&#39;s inconsiderate&quot;), so the information is as honest and<br/>
personal and relational as it can be -- so it has real meaning to the<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t like seeing litter on the ground.  I think it makes the<br/>
street/park/playground look messy and sad.  If litter is sticky,<br/>
sometimes it gets stuck on my shoe -- very annoying and sometimes<br/>
expensive, if I have to buy new shoes, but that&#39;s only happened once.<br/>
 There are some kinds of litter that animals try to eat and then hurt<br/>
themselves on, and I worry about that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of information, some of it about my emotions, some of it factual.<br/>
 All of it assumes that the child does not need correction as much as<br/>
good information and some help with awareness.  I might not give all<br/>
this information at once, or even at a time when the child has littered.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my problem with the statement that &quot;It&#39;s inconsiderate to do<br/>
that&quot; is that people, including adults, do litter, for all sorts of<br/>
reasons (missed the trash can, dropped something, couldn&#39;t find a<br/>
place to put it, were rebelling from years of being told to not<br/>
litter) and I think it&#39;s confusing for children if we pretend that we<br/>
know a person&#39;s intention or motivation or mindset behind doing so.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Inconsiderate towards other people&quot; does make a statement about the<br/>
person doing the act, though you may mean it to be about the effect on<br/>
others, to mean that &quot;other people find it inconvenient or unpleasant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Littering might not be a result of being &quot;inconsiderate&quot; at times. <br/>
What if I drop my Wendy&#39;s bag so that I can catch a little child who<br/>
is falling, for instance, or give CPR to a person in need?  I might<br/>
forget to pick it up afterwards, what with all the excitement.  Or<br/>
what if I miss the trash can because I&#39;m distracted by a conversation<br/>
with a friend who needs a shoulder to cry on?  Or what if I set my<br/>
lunch bag aside so that I can push my child on the swing, but it gets<br/>
knocked off the bench and the wind blows it away?  Or what if somebody<br/>
is injured and needs to be carried, and there&#39;s no trash can nearby<br/>
for my empty soda cup?<br/>
<br/>
In the first three scenarios, it&#39;s likely that I would pick up the<br/>
trash once I discovered the mistake, but my point is that in all those<br/>
examples I was being *very* considerate of other people -- that was<br/>
the main intention in my own mind, and yet I littered, which you have<br/>
said is &quot;inconsiderate&quot; of me.  My litter may become unpleasant for<br/>
other people, but my intention certainly was not to be inconsiderate.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I would have found confusing as a child, as I watched<br/>
adults litter for various reasons.  That would have added to my<br/>
feeling that sometimes even when I was trying to do the right thing, I<br/>
was doing the wrong thing.  It just doesn&#39;t help to paint a happy<br/>
picture of the world.  <br/>
<br/>
So it might be worth thinking about your words a little more, and<br/>
making sure you&#39;re giving good information instead of jumping to<br/>
conclusions about others&#39; motivations.  Your children might find that<br/>
to be more helpful.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I try (have certainly not succeeded at all times) to NOT comment <br/>
negatively on something that is already a done deal.<br/>
<br/>
So - if my kid threw trash out the car window, for example, I might <br/>
just keep my mouth shut about it, right then, so as not to embarrass <br/>
her or make her feel bad.<br/>
BUT - I&#39;d remember that it happened and some other time I might say, &quot;I <br/>
got trash bags for the car so that from now on we can put trash in <br/>
there. Here, can you put this in the trash bag for me?&quot;  No reason to <br/>
mention the trash that went out the window. Done deal that can&#39;t be <br/>
corrected.<br/>
<br/>
I try to make a specific and realistic request, rather than an <br/>
after-the-fact complaint. And I try to do it in a way that doesn&#39;t even <br/>
appear related to someone doing something that I disapproved of, <br/>
previously.<br/>
I wish I&#39;d had this idea in my head years ago - I think it is far more <br/>
sensible and kinder and more conducive to happy harmonious relations.<br/>
<br/>
Some things that have become very clear to me now that my kids are <br/>
older teenagers/young adults would have been very useful to understand <br/>
years ago - but somehow didn&#39;t seem as obvious back then.<br/>

you&#39;ve identified and decided she needs to fix. The second part is <br/>
stated as a fact and it may not be true. It&#39;s better -- in terms of <br/>
learning how to solve problems in general -- to help her notice <br/>
patterns.<br/>
<br/>
The second is you pointing out something that&#39;s a problem for other <br/>
people. The solution is then open ended and you two can try out various <br/>
solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Better to focus on the big picture of helping her problem solve in <br/>
general rather than put out this particular fire.<br/>

 &quot;Inconsiderate towards other people&quot; does make a statement about the<br/>

Littering might not be a result of being &quot;inconsiderate&quot; at times. <br/>
What if I drop my Wendy&#39;s bag so that I can catch a little child who<br/>
is falling, for instance, or give CPR to a person in need?  I might<br/>

*very* considerate of other people -- that was the main intention in <br/>
my own mind, and yet I littered, which you have said <br/>
is &quot;inconsiderate&quot; of me.  My litter may become unpleasant for<br/>

and throw them away.  There wasn&#39;t a lot to talk about.  <br/>

So - if  my kid threw trash out the car window, for example, I might <br/>
just keep my  mouth shut about it, right then, so as not to embarrass <br/>
her or make her  feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in the days and places (and with perhaps a class of people) where  <br/>
trash was routinely thrown out of car windows, including lit cigarettes and  <br/>
glass bottles.  I hated it, even when I was really little.  <br/>
 <br/>
The last time I was in a car and someone threw out a glass bottle it was  the <br/>
mid 70&#39;s and I threw a little fit.<br/>
 <br/>
Probably because of my own history, if someone (anyone) threw something out  <br/>
of my car window I would say &quot;Don&#39;t ever do that again.&quot;  <br/>
If one of my kids did it (which they never have, not counting maybe  <br/>
sunflower seed hulls or an apple core or a piece of gum, and even those I  encourage <br/>
use of the trash bag), I would say &quot;Don&#39;t ever do that in my  car.  When you <br/>
grow up and buy your own car if you still want to do that,  go ahead.  The fine <br/>
is $300, so you wait until you&#39;re on your own.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I wish I&#39;d had this idea in my head years ago - I think it is far more  <br/>
sensible and kinder and more conducive to happy harmonious  relations.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re probably right, but I don&#39;t want harmonious relations with litterers  <br/>
or liars or child abusers.  (Just to name the subject at hand and a couple  of <br/>
recent examples of people not worth making nice with.)  And the ticket  for <br/>
littering wouldn&#39;t be delivered to the kid, but to the driver.<br/>

<br/>
If my kids (teens, boys) make a lot of noise after 10:00 at night when  their <br/>
dad and the neighbors have to be at work early in the morning, that is  <br/>
inconsiderate.  We don&#39;t need each individual to come and say &quot;When I  heard your <br/>
stereo at midnight, it made me feel...&quot;   Depending on  the volume, it might <br/>
also be illegal.<br/>
 <br/>
If those same boys and their friends park their cars in such ways that  fewer <br/>
cars can park or neighbors can&#39;t get in or out, that&#39;s  inconsiderate.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t need a neighbor to come and say &quot;This car is  half in my regular parking <br/>
spot.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
But those things are constants.  More hours aren&#39;t added after  10:00.  The <br/>
cul-de-sac doesn&#39;t stretch to allow more cars.<br/>
 <br/>
The consumption of otter pops doesn&#39;t seem to me to be in that  category.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m talking about with my OWN children. Not litterers or liars or child <br/>
abusers. My own YOUNG child who did something thoughtless. If any of my <br/>
kids threw trash out the window - to be honest, I&#39;d be so shocked that <br/>
what would come out of my mouth would be something like, &quot;Huh?&quot;  But I <br/>
was trying to come up with something a 5 or 6 year old might do, <br/>
thoughtlessly, which they couldn&#39;t undo if they were called on it. Like <br/>
eating all the otter pops.<br/>
<br/>
So - I was talking about how to respond to something they cannot do <br/>
anything about right at that moment. I meant that we&#39;re driving at 70 <br/>
mph down the freeway. (My kids wouldn&#39;t do this either - but JUST this <br/>
morning somebody in a car in front of us threw a handful of fast food <br/>
trash out their window. Roxana and I were shocked into silence for a <br/>
minute.)<br/>
<br/>
If we walking down the street and a kid drops trash on the ground, I&#39;d <br/>
say, &quot;Here - you can stick that in this bag,&quot; or &quot;Grab that back up and <br/>
stick it in my pocket until we find a trash can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again - specific request where they can make it right, immediately, <br/>
rather than embarrassing and shaming them in hopes that they won&#39;t do <br/>
it again in the future.<br/>
<br/>
The otter pop situation seems like the piece of trash out the window on <br/>
the freeway. No matter how bad the little girl felt, she couldn&#39;t make <br/>
it right. The thoughts in her head were probably things like, &quot;What do <br/>
you want me to do about it? Throw up so you can have your precious <br/>
green otter pop?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re criticized after the fact and we can&#39;t make it right, there <br/>
is no recourse but to feel shame - and usually people feeling shame are <br/>
NOT thinking about how to avoid it next time, but are feeling resentful <br/>
and angry at the person who shamed them. And a little girl eating all <br/>
the otter pops isn&#39;t WORTH shaming her. MUCH easier to just wait - next <br/>
time you&#39;re at the grocery store buy a box and have her help put them <br/>
in the freezer and say, &quot;Last time I didn&#39;t get any green ones, so be <br/>
SURE to save a couple of them for me this time, okay?&quot; She&#39;s little - <br/>
that&#39;s probably all that needs saying.<br/>
<br/>
But - if you see this as something you want to really focus in on - if <br/>
it is a really big deal and isn&#39;t just the otter pops one time - then <br/>
enlist her help on how to make sure everybody feels treated fairly.  <br/>
&quot;How can we make sure some get saved for me? How about for your <br/>
brothers and sisters?&quot; Again - she&#39;s little - this should be fun and <br/>
casual and I&#39;m talking about her feeling like she&#39;s doing something <br/>
nice with you, not feeling like she&#39;s being punished or embarrassed.<br/>

Why in the WORLD would my son throw something out the window of a  moving car <br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m not the best model of thinking of others--I confess to eating the last  <br/>
cookie out of the package last night, without asking if he wanted it.  (Dh  is <br/>
out of town.)  But I also knew he had had many of the cookies already,  and he <br/>
probably had his fill of them, and if he had wanted it after I had  eaten it, <br/>
I would promise to get more and if it really, really meant a lot  to him I <br/>
would have gotten off the couch and gone to get more.  He&#39;s  considerate of me, <br/>
and mature, and we know what each other&#39;s likes and dislikes  are, and he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have asked me to go the store at 9:30.  And I wouldn&#39;t  have eaten the <br/>
last cookie if I had an inkling it meant that much to him.   When we model <br/>
consideration of our children, they model it back.  <br/>

We live on a small island, and one of the great things about this is that, <br/>
for all practical purposes, there&#39;s only one way off. We have a high <br/>
percentage of &quot;crunchy&quot; types, quite a few whose livelihood is based on <br/>
natural resources (ocean and forest), and many tourists in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, one of our neighbours saw someone throwing a bunch of <br/>
trash out the window of their car. He stopped, picked up the trash, and <br/>
continued on his way to the ferry. Sure enough, the offending person was <br/>
also on the ferry :-). He motioned the driver to roll down the window and, <br/>
smiling, dumped the trash on his lap. I&#39;m not sure of his exact words, but <br/>
I believe it was something simple like &quot;I think this was yours&quot;.<br/>

spring after the snow melts, there is always some that has accumulated over<br/>
the winter but not much really. (There is a paper cup across the street from<br/>
my house in the ditch that I keep meaning to pick up.)  When we visited<br/>
Florida last winter I was appalled at all the trash on the roadside in the<br/>
bedroom community of Deltona in a nice neighborhood.  (my mil lives there)<br/>
I was out for a walk around the lake and as I walked by, someone in a car<br/>
going by several yards ahead of me threw a coke can out the window right in<br/>
my sight.  I can&#39;t imagine littering (besides apple cores thrown into the<br/>
woods on the roadside)  and I esp. can&#39;t imagine littering in front of a<br/>
pedestrian walking by.   I was really shocked.<br/>

Here too, generally.<br/>

At the state fair there&#39;s trash on the ground.  That&#39;s about the only  time I <br/>
really see much.  I see lots of people just pick up trash that&#39;s not  theirs, <br/>
without grumbling.  <br/>
 <br/>
I was impressed at Disneyland, which has the same general conditions as the  <br/>
New Mexico State Fair (crowds with paper cups and papers, in lines they are  <br/>
loath to get out of, hot and tired and not knowing where  the nearest  trashcan <br/>
might be, having guys whose job it is to pick trash up all the  time.  If a <br/>
kid dropped popcorn or a straw, a guy with a broom and dustpan  was there <br/>
within about 30 seconds, smiling and dancing, or drumming on his  trashcan.<br/>

I think the idea that &quot;someone&quot; not a government agency, but a <br/>
volunteer force, will be picking up, is more of a deterrent than the <br/>
idea of a fine for $299.00 (which signs I haven&#39;t seen in ID or UT <br/>
for a long time)<br/>

guidance, and honestly wasn&#39;t clear how to go about it. When I told <br/>

labeling her action, not HER. <br/>

evidently looking like I&#39;ve been arguing. I haven&#39;t meant to be <br/>
argumentative; I&#39;ve just been trying to find out how my wording could <br/>
be better and what to say (or not say L) when things like it happen <br/>
again. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947641343">Japan has the best/worst litter I&#39;ve ever experienced.  On the<br/>
outskirts of Kyoto where we lived for a year it seemed that all the<br/>
teenage boys must have gone to check out their porn and leave it<br/>
scattered all over the ground when they were through.  David has some<br/>
pictures of the bamboo forest with porn blowing through it somewhere.<br/>
 In Kyoto proper there was very rarely any litter as lots of people<br/>
were employed to clean it up, but outside of the city, well, who cares.  <br/>

they are  <br/>

time.  If a <br/>
&gt; kid dropped popcorn or a straw, a guy with a broom and dustpan  was<br/>
there <br/>
&gt; within about 30 seconds, smiling and dancing, or drumming on his <br/>
trashcan.<br/>

I wonder  if the litter rate has gone down since the Adopt a Highway <br/>
program came  into being. Do other states besides UT and ID have that? <br/>
Civic groups, or  scout troops, or businesses, churches, even <br/>
families, will adopt a mile of  road, and keep it clean. They get <br/>
their name on a sign on the road, and  there isn&#39;t much litter along <br/>
Idaho or Utah  highways.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
VA has the adopt a highway program, BUT the organization pays a FEE to get  <br/>
there name on a sign that says they are sponsoring that bit of roadway by  <br/>
keeping it clean.<br/>
 <br/>
In some areas here it&#39;s pretty dangerous, the bring out small children and  <br/>
have them on back country roads on curves picking up trash, bended over,  <br/>
partially hidden by tall weeds... on some roads it is much safer than  others.<br/>
