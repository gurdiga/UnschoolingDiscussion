&gt; &lt;&lt; My ten year old son would be able to fit in the armor<br/>
&gt; itself, maybe, but his size 9s would *not* fit in<br/>
&gt; those tiny shoe like covers, lol.  Amazing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we noticed the same thing on a recent trip in Europe. And I don&#39;t think <br/>
it&#39;s all due to it just being &quot;display armor&quot;. We saw armor that had really <br/>
been used in jousting tournaments, and I would barely have fit in it (I&#39;m <br/>
5&#39;7&quot;). In the Tower of London, they have the armor of many of the kings <br/>
dating back hundreds of years. Sure, Henry VIII&#39;s is noticeably large, but <br/>
many of them are quite small. They also have the biggest and smallest suit <br/>
of armor there - the big one is pretty darned tall, so obviously they did <br/>
have some tall folks back then. The smallest was made for a young prince.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that people haven&#39;t been getting taller and taller on a steady <br/>
continuum from ancient times. Apparently, European human heights reached an <br/>
apex in around 800 AD, then shrunk again until they hit bottom around the <br/>
17th century. So suits of armor from around the 1500&#39;s to 1600&#39;s will be <br/>
noticeably smaller than humans today, while those from earlier times tend to <br/>
be closer to our current size and one from the late 1600&#39;s on get <br/>
progressively larger  (with individual variations, of course) .<br/>

<br/>
When were guns in use in European battles? <br/>
There&#39;s an important factor.  Until then, individual bits of armor (not whole <br/>
suits) were used by anyone who could find the pieces, and were used up.  <br/>
After the 1600&#39;s, armor just wasn&#39;t very useful anymore because of guns.<br/>
<br/>
The Jamestown inventories talk about breastplates and chain mail.  The chain <br/>
mail turned out to be worthless against arrows, I think.  I don&#39;t remember <br/>
them bothering with legs and arms and gauntlets.  Just helms and breastplates.   <br/>
Same with Conquistador armor in the Southwest.  Some full suits at first, but <br/>
it was wildly impractical and there were lots of breast/backplate, and helmets.<br/>
<br/>
Full suits of armor are for sword and axe and pike battles.  By the late 17th <br/>
century it&#39;s mostly guns and cannons.<br/>
<br/>
(I got Keith to read this and he adds that medical advances by made it less <br/>
crucial to have heavy armor.  By Napoleonic times it was easier to &quot;heal&quot; than <br/>
prevent some kinds of wounds, like arrows in legs, so body armor stayed in use <br/>
longer than other types.)<br/>

climate changes between those two times, including &quot;the Little Ice <br/>
Age&quot;, plus population density changes from urbanization, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The difference in just a few generations of Japanese, among others, <br/>
show what a big change can be brought around by differing diets in <br/>
the same genetic pool.<br/>

who everyone thinks are genetically short can grow really, really<br/>
tall.  In Japan the introduction of easy sources of protein for<br/>
everyone has made them a population with 6 footers.  And my cousin, a<br/>
good Nebraska boy with lots of meat and potatoes at just the right<br/>
time is 6&#39;10.  His dad is 6&#39;4 and his mom is about 5&#39;8. It is<br/>
genetics, to some extent, but it is much more about what you eat and when.<br/>

I knew a woman who was born into a family of six kids.  The first three had <br/>
been born in England post WWII, during heavy food rationing.  The second <br/>
three were born in the US in the 1950s and were six inches taller than the <br/>
older siblings.<br/>
