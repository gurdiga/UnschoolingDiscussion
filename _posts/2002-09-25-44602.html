<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075194548">I never would have believed it if it had not happened here but 3 yos <br/>
*can* read.<br/>
and not &#39;Bob&#39; books.<br/>
My youngest was reading at three. She was sitting in my lap on occasion <br/>
when I dabbled in &#39;You Can Teach Your Child To Read in 100 Easy Lessons&#39; <br/>
( or something like that) with her 6 yo brother.<br/>
Never finished the whole book or anything....probably had nothing much <br/>
to do with it..but she could read VERY well. She is quite petite, had no <br/>
hair, just this teeny, tiny bald head until she was about 4 yo- and I <br/>
can remember her reading books to her older cousins.. people use to ask- <br/>
&quot;where are the trick mirrors? Whose the ventriloquist?!&quot;<br/>
I vividly remembering shoving the newspaper with its Monica Lewinski <br/>
headlines under the couch one day as she was quite  interested. I&#39;m no <br/>
prude but I didn&#39;t want a virtual TODDLER burdened with that whole story.<br/>
It really was eerie- I mean , one of my older kids was about 8 or 9 <br/>
before he even recognized letters consistently. ( with that wonderful <br/>
thing known as  hindsight- he was eventually diagnosed with some serious <br/>
visual problems- excellent vision- ut this eyes do not work well <br/>
together&#39; vision therapy was an absolute god send for him! <br/>

<br/>
She is nine now and always has at least 3 or 4 books going <br/>
simultaneously and despite her exposure to phonics, she is 100% a sight <br/>
reader.<br/>
isn&#39;t it amazing how different kids can be!?  Even siblings?<br/>
<br/>
Love, Judy<br/>

Well, yes. Some can. It wasn&#39;t the idea of a 3 year old reading that had <br/>
folks worried, it was the idea of someone (Todd) getting upset about a 3 year <br/>
old having trouble reading. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge range of normal reading ages. Parents shouldn&#39;t worry their <br/>
kids about that.<br/>
