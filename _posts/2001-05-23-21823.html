<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064783818">I am researching information for an article on military<br/>
homeschooling.  My information base is limited (all my experience is<br/>
in the European theater with the Army) and the few articles I know of<br/>
on military homeschooling that I could use for references are at<br/>
least a decade old and the demographic seems to have changed.  What I<br/>
would like to know are your particulars, MINUS THE NAMES.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought up quite a few questions as I&#39;m not sure in which<br/>
direction the article will go nor what information will be helpful in<br/>
writing something that has a theme and makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the questions sound judgmental but they aren&#39;t.  I&#39;m just<br/>
trying to get a feel for the &#39;specialness&#39; of military homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in responding, PLEASE SEND A PRIVATE EMAIL TO<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:vstarrmoon@...">vstarrmoon@...</a>  as 1) it would be annoying to those who are<br/>
uninterested in trivia I&#39;m being nosy about, and 2) I may not be on a<br/>
list this has been cross-posted to.<br/>
<br/>
If you type the email addy please note that the &#39;starr&#39; has two r&#39;s<br/>
in it - my mom was a big fan of Brenda Starr when I was born so Miss<br/>
Starr is well over 50!<br/>
<br/>
It would probably be easiest to cut & paste this into your email<br/>
program.<br/>
