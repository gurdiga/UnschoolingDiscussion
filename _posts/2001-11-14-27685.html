<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863438312">Research also has indicated that media can adversely<br/>
impact sexuality, academic performance, body concept<br/>
and self-image, nutrition, dieting and obesity, and<br/>
substance abuse patterns, according to the recently<br/>
revised AAP Policy Statement, &quot;Children, Adolescents<br/>
and Television&quot; (Pediatrics. 2001;107:423-426).<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that we can all find research to support our<br/>
own feelings about tv. I think. At least I can find<br/>
research that supports my feeling that tv does have an<br/>
impact on children, both positive and negative.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is anything less than obvious that<br/>
woman are not depicted as positive role models all<br/>
that often on tv. Especially in cartoons. There are<br/>
many out there that do make attempts to do better, but<br/>
lets face it. It is quite clear that how women are<br/>
depicted on tv and the media adversely affects a teens<br/>
self image. How many near anorexic models do that have<br/>
to look at before they feel they are not attractive? <br/>
Did you ever take a look at home much sex and alcohol<br/>
are in tv shows? MTV is littered with it, about 1/4 of<br/>
their programming has alcohol abuse in it.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly two-thirds of all television programming<br/>
contains violence, and children&#39;s shows contain the<br/>
most violence, according to a recent study.<br/>
<br/>
Neuroscientists have shown that environmental<br/>
experiences significantly shape the developing brain<br/>
because of the plasticity of its neuronal<br/>
connectivity. Thus, repeated exposure to any stimulus<br/>
in a child&#39;s environment may forcibly impact mental<br/>
and emotional growth, either by setting up particular<br/>
circuitry (&quot;habits of mind&quot;) or by depriving the brain<br/>
of other experiences. While appropriate stimuli �<br/>
close interaction with loving caregivers; an enriched,<br/>
interactive, human language environment; engrossing<br/>
hands-on play opportunities; and age-appropriate<br/>
academic stimulation � enhance the brain&#39;s<br/>
development, environments that encourage intellectual<br/>
passivity and maladaptive behavior (e.g., impulsivity,<br/>
violence), or deprive the brain of important chances<br/>
to participate actively in social relationships,<br/>
creative play, reflection and complex problem-solving<br/>
may have deleterious and irrevocable consequences. In<br/>
addition, trying to plunge youngsters into academic<br/>
learning, when they should be personally investigating<br/>
the three-dimensional world, risks bypassing important<br/>
aspects of development.<br/>
<br/>
So for me, limiting what they see, or if I am<br/>
available, watching it with them, is the only way to<br/>
address it. By watching it with them, I can help them<br/>
develop media literacy. With those skills, than yes, I<br/>
agree, much of what&#39;s on television can be positive<br/>
viewing experiences. <br/>
<br/>
Teaching media literacy skills to a very young child<br/>
is difficult. As is sitting with them all day and<br/>
watching tv, if that&#39;s what they are choosing to do. I<br/>
would hesitate to let the tv remain on, without being<br/>
able to point out the indiscrepancies between reality<br/>
and tv. The road runner only goes from being flattened<br/>
to a healthy road runner on tv. Doesn&#39;t happen in<br/>
reality.<br/>
