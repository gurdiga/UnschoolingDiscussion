<div id="ygrps-yiv-916421408">It had gotten to the point where I was perpetually ill, tired, spiking mild<br/>
fevers, lethargic, sneezing, well, you name it, I had it but every doctor I<br/>
saw told me, more or less, that it was all in my head.  It all came to a<br/>
head when we bought a new mattress (and it wasn&#39;t a cheapy either, d*mn,<br/>
one almost can&#39;t afford to sleep anymore &lt;g&gt;).  I would wake up totally<br/>
clogged, both sinuses and lungs.  I decided that I wasn&#39;t paying another<br/>
doctor another dime and started going through every book I could find and<br/>
then started on the net.  WOW, the things I found out that &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t<br/>
really want us to know.  Take formaldehyde, please.  It is in everything!!!<br/>
 AND, if you go and look at a modular home in a sales lot you will see<br/>
signs posted saying &quot;Anyone with respiratory problems, blah, blah, blah,<br/>
should be informed that living in one of these may be hazardous to your<br/>
health.&quot;  Well, formaldehyde is the culprit.  It is in floors, carpeting,<br/>
AND your clothes and sheets!  We got rid of all the permanent pressed junk<br/>
that had been processed with &quot;f&quot; and all the flame retardant clothes for<br/>
the kidlets.  That cut all our sneezing and coughing attacks in half.<br/>
<br/>
Then I read about PVC and other plastics (because of hubby&#39;s landscaping we<br/>
got a couple of flyers in the mail which started me on my Sherlocking of<br/>
plastics).  Geez, here we are putting this stuff in our homes to carry our<br/>
drinking water and kryovacing our meats and cheeses with it and nucking<br/>
stuff in it and it is &quot;off-gassing.&quot;  Out went the plastics.<br/>
<br/>
Then I read about the aluminum and its correlation with not only<br/>
Alzheimer&#39;s but several other conditions.  So out went the aluminum pans<br/>
(Revere Ware loves me now &lt;g&gt;).  And then, gasp, I happened to be buying<br/>
some baking powder and youngest kidlet was just starting to do the read all<br/>
the ingredients thingy and guess what is in your baking powder--ALUMINUM!<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the more garbage we removed, the better everyone felt.  This<br/>
last winter not one of the kidlets had more than a minor sniffle and we had<br/>
a soggy, damp, cold winter.  I&#39;ve been sick but it has been related to my<br/>
kidneys and &quot;female&quot; problems that go with age.  BUT, nothing like the past<br/>
more years than I want to think about.<br/>
<br/>
We thought for sure we would have a problem with the kids when I went<br/>
through the cupboards and tossed everything but it has been a surprisingly<br/>
easy transition.  There are sooooo many good things out there that aren&#39;t<br/>
&quot;hippy&quot; foods as the kidlets call them, that everyone is feeling better and<br/>
doing better.  Eldest son had horrible allergies and almost every single<br/>
one of them is gone (he still does a little sneezing and occasionally will<br/>
have red irritated eyes but the honey really seems to be helping).  Middle<br/>
kidlet was supposedly severely ADD and he is just galloping along with<br/>
projects AND he finishes them (I think it was allergies).  Also, eldest<br/>
kidlet had severe intestinal problems from birth (collick so bad the only<br/>
thing that helped was taking him for long rides in the car), severe gas<br/>
pains, bloating, attacks like appendicitis, the whole nine yards.  He would<br/>
end up on a clear liquid diet as it was the only thing he could tolerate. <br/>
Since we went to all organic, got rid of the MSG/preservatives and all<br/>
artificial flavors, etc., he hasn&#39;t had one attack in over six months!<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, didn&#39;t mean to write a novel here.  I will shut up now &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 So glad you were able to pin point several items that<br/>
were endangering the health of your family. Good<br/>
detecting! I just wanted to touch on the point you<br/>
made about your middle child....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have seen children who public school id&#39;d as ADD and<br/>
it was indeed food allergies! I would like to<br/>
recommend the book &quot;Is This Your Child?&quot; by Dr Doris<br/>
Rapp, Discovering and Treating Unrecognized Allergies<br/>
in Children and Adults. A remarkable book I think<br/>
every parent should read!<br/>

you store leftover foods-- do you use glass and stainless steel containers?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918476317">We use glass, pyrex, corning, ceramic, but not stainless steel too much for<br/>
storage mainly because they usually have round bottoms and the kidlets are<br/>
inclined to bump into them and then there is a mess to lean up.<br/>
<br/>
There is a baking powder that doesn&#39;t have aluminum.  It is in a red can<br/>
and I&#39;m blessed if I can remember the name of it but it is what most folks<br/>
used 50 to 100 years ago.  Most health food stores carry it and major<br/>
stores that have organic foods such as Organic Valley (look at their<br/>
website for a list of stores).<br/>
<br/>
Derek is 16, therefore, being a typical teenager, sticking with a strict<br/>
diet is near impossible.  However, with all the changes we have made in the<br/>
house, the &quot;junk&quot; he eats when he isn&#39;t at home does not seem to have a<br/>
great a negative effect on him.  If something does really bother him, he<br/>
regulates his own diet by eating only at home for a period of time before<br/>
he ventures out to eat more junk food.  I figure with seeing the results of<br/>
good eating, once he is past the stage that has earned me the button that<br/>
reads &quot;have pity on me I am the mother of a teenager&quot;, he will stick with a<br/>
healthy diet and not have any problems at all.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that half his problem was actual food allergies (dairy) and<br/>
half was due to chemicals in the food and refined food products.  If I buy<br/>
organic, he can occasionally eat a little dairy (like ice cream or yogurt)<br/>
and not suffer greatly.  He can eat &quot;white&quot; bread and cinnamon rolls if I<br/>
make them from organic ingredients and use whole wheat flour.  But, he<br/>
can&#39;t take a steady diet of these types of foods.  The real key has been<br/>
going organic and getting rid of all the hidden things in products (lead in<br/>
some cans, chemicals to &quot;preserve&quot; packaging, MSG &quot;hiding&quot; under other<br/>
names, etc.).<br/>

need road signs.<br/>
<br/>
 There is so much info. out there and I don&#39;t want to get overwhelmed before <br/>
I start.  I&#39;m currently reading &quot;Super Immunity for Kids&quot; and thinking about <br/>
getting my family started on that diet for starters, but that&#39;s about as far <br/>
as I&#39;ve moved. <br/>
<br/>
My dh is very conventional and kind of poo-poos all this &quot;environmental <br/>
allergy&quot; stuff. <br/>
But, we&#39;ve had enough health problems lately that I think he&#39;s getting more <br/>
open to changing our lives to get rid of some of these pests as much as we <br/>
can.  And we just had our second child diagnosed with asthma and I refuse to <br/>
treat it with albuterol and breathing treatments without trying the more <br/>
natural route first.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I appreciate all your stories, Lynda.  Keep them coming, please!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747394604">Well, I&#39;m married to the original card carrying skeptic!!!  I started this<br/>
slowly and took my bright neon yellow pen to articles that I left in<br/>
strategic places like his place at the table &lt;g&gt;  I also commented to him<br/>
(kinda reinforcing his comments) when he would have a fast food burger and<br/>
would be complaining about how sluggish he felt, kinda gentle reminders. <br/>
Then when we had an organic beef burger on homemade organic rolls, after<br/>
dinner he suggested that we go out and do somemore gardening and I kinda<br/>
mentioned that he wasn&#39;t feeling sluggish, &quot;Gee your full of spit and<br/>
vinegar, not like after &quot;x&quot; burgers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, after a while he jumped on the bandwagon and is now reading labels<br/>
and telling the kidlets all about it (and they very sensibly nod their head<br/>
up and down never letting on that I &quot;brainwashed&quot; them months ago &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I figured slow was better as it allowed time for everyone else to adjust<br/>
and now, instead of food fights, I have an army of label readers and folks<br/>
chomping on the bit for organic goodies.<br/>

  <div><tt>Well, I&#39;m married to the original card carrying skeptic!!!&nbsp; I 
  started this<br>slowly and took my bright neon yellow pen to articles that I 
  left in<br>strategic places like his place at the table &lt;g&gt;&nbsp; I also 
  commented to him<br>(kinda reinforcing his comments) when he would have a fast 
  food burger and<br>would be complaining about how sluggish he felt, kinda 
  gentle reminders. <br>Then when we had an organic beef burger on homemade 
  organic rolls, after<br>dinner he suggested that we go out and do somemore 
  gardening and I kinda<br>mentioned that he wasn&#39;t feeling sluggish, &quot;Gee your 
  full of spit and<br>vinegar, not like after &quot;x&quot; burgers.&quot;<br><br>Well, after a 
  while he jumped on the bandwagon and is now reading labels<br>and telling the 
  kidlets all about it (and they very sensibly nod their head<br>up and down 
  never letting on that I &quot;brainwashed&quot; them months ago &lt;g&gt;).<br><br>I 
  figured slow was better as it allowed time for everyone else to adjust<br>and 
  now, instead of food fights, I have an army of label readers and 
  folks<br>chomping on the bit for organic 
  goodies.<br><br>Lynda<br>----------<br>&gt; From: burkfamily@...<br>&gt;
