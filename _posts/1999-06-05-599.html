<div id="ygrps-yiv-399107070">Hi Andi (and other Ohioans)!<br/>
<br/>
Andi, it would be great if you and Issac can come to the inventure place on <br/>
the 23rd!!!!  I think we are meeting there at 11:00 Am, but I will confirm it <br/>
with you later.<br/>
<br/>
Also, i am having an Activity day at my house on Friday, June 25th at 1:00 <br/>
PM.  No particular thing is scheduled, but we have a 42&quot; deep pool, much arts <br/>
& crafts stuff, and 14 acres of woods behind us, oh, and a cool tree house.  <br/>
This is just a chance for homeschoolers to get together and play for the <br/>
afternoon! <br/>
<br/>
This would be a great time for you and Issac to visit Andi! All of you Ohio <br/>
hs&#39;ers are invited too!  Or anyone who might be passing through on that day <br/>
:-)<br/>
 <br/>
Please reply to me personally and let me know if you are interested in coming <br/>
and need directions!  Again, I am in North Ridgeville, which is in Lorain <br/>
County (next to Cuyahoga County). <br/>
