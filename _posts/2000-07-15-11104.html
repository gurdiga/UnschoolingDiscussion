<div id="ygrps-yiv-908502684">This is an interesting discussion -- I had no idea there were so many <br/>
non-meat-eaters out there! When I was in college I gave up meat for a year, <br/>
or tried to -- I found I just had to have a hamburger or steak about once a <br/>
month! Similarly when I was pregnant I had a real longing for eggs! I guess <br/>
I just needed that extra protein. The Bradley books I read said many <br/>
pregnant women don&#39;t get enough. I have a friend who gave up meat about the <br/>
time she was trying to get pregnant. She was 41 and apparently her body <br/>
really needed the protein; she started to lose weight and wasn&#39;t able to <br/>
conceive again.<br/>
