<div id="ygrps-yiv-514873469">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Let me post here the entire text of a story that ran in a Japanese <br/>
newspaper a few days ago.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to save it as part of the next weekly news digest, but this <br/>
essay is so good that I couldn&#39;t resist sharing all of it with you now.<br/>
<br/>
As a homelearner, it is truly inspiring to hear that the two earliest and <br/>
strongest influences on Hideki Shirakawa -- this year&#39;s Nobel Chemistry <br/>
Prize recipient who hails from Japan -- were home and nature. <br/>
<br/>
Anybody here surprised? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Happy reading,<br/>

CHILDHOOD ENCOUNTERS WITH SCIENCE<br/>
<br/>
The Nobel Chemistry Prize winner<br/>
reminisces about his early influences<br/>
in Taiwan and rural Japan.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
by HIDEKI SHIRAKAWA<br/>
Special to Asahi Shimbun<br/>
<br/>
*(Editor&#39;s Note: This is a translation of an essay by this year&#39;s Nobel <br/>
Chemistry Prize winner, Hideki Shirakawa, that was published in Asahi <br/>
Shimbun. Titled &quot;My Encounters with Science,&quot; Shirakawa writes about his <br/>
childhood in rural Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, and how he became <br/>
interested in science.)*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I cannot recall exactly when I took a liking to science, particularly <br/>
chemistry. No special event comes to mind which may have inspired me. One <br/>
thing for certain, though, is that I spent 10 years of my childhood, from <br/>
the third grade until graduation from high school, in Hidatakayama, which <br/>
is blessed with nature.<br/>
<br/>
North, south, east, west -- no matter which way I headed, a mere five- to <br/>
10-minute walk from my home would take me to a stream or a rice field, <br/>
and beyond that, it was just mountains and more mountains. Crawling <br/>
around the swamp looking for *mosengoke* (roundleaf sundew), or running <br/>
about with a net catching insects was what my days were all about.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, my interest in nature was aroused at a much younger age. I <br/>
believe I was three or four years old, when we were living in Taipei. I <br/>
vaguely remember watching, with tireless fascination, countless cicada <br/>
larvae crawl out of a tree trunk which had fallen during a typhoon.<br/>
<br/>
When I heard my brother and sister discussing whether or not to take a <br/>
baby bird from its nest in the yard, I felt eager to hold the bird in the <br/>
palm of my hand. Memories such as these, however, were part of any <br/>
childhood back then, so it is not as if my experience was in any way <br/>
unique. I suppose, then, that in my case, moving on to live in a place <br/>
like Takayama enabled me to expand on my early experiences with nature.<br/>
<br/>
Chemistry is a field in the natural sciences which looks at the structure <br/>
and characteristics of matter, as well as the chemical reactions which <br/>
occur when atoms and molecules link to form matter. It can be said that <br/>
the workings of nature, in particular the workings of life, are all a <br/>
result of chemical reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, no matter how hard you observe nature, these reactions will not take <br/>
place in front of your eyes. The opportunity to become familiar with <br/>
chemistry is quite limited indeed; most people have to wait until <br/>
elementary school, when performing experiments in science class.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, I experienced much at home in addition to what I learned in <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I have both an older and younger brother, as well as an older and younger <br/>
sister. A family with five children was not unusual at the time, but my <br/>
mother was always very busy. To help out with the housework, each child <br/>
did his or her share.<br/>
<br/>
I was in charge of cooking the rice and getting the bath ready, even <br/>
though I did not perform these chores every day. I don&#39;t remember whether <br/>
I also washed the rice, but my mother added the required amount of water <br/>
for me. My job was to start the fire to cook the rice, and to heat the <br/>
bath. We used firewood for fuel, so I was able to learn from experience <br/>
how to make a fire and keep it under control.<br/>
<br/>
Of the two chores, cooking rice kept me busier, as I had to keep a close <br/>
watch of the fire, but when preparing the bath, I did not need to pay as <br/>
much attention and had plenty of time to play around while waiting for <br/>
the water to heat up.<br/>
<br/>
I discovered then, that when I added newspaper soaked in salt water to <br/>
the fire, I would get a yellow flame. I was able to see for myself an <br/>
actual flame reaction which I had learned about in a textbook.<br/>
<br/>
I also played with empty ampoules, readily available since my father was <br/>
a practicing doctor.<br/>
<br/>
After filling one with matchsticks, I would place it in the fire, and <br/>
watched as first, white steam, and then, a bright orange flame came <br/>
bursting out. When the ampoule was cool, I found the matchsticks inside <br/>
had been transformed into black charcoal while retaining their original <br/>
shape.<br/>
<br/>
All these &quot;experiments&quot; were amusing to me. This was, most likely, my <br/>
first encounter with chemistry, and my little trials were equal to the <br/>
famous lessons that the English chemist and physicist, Michael Faraday, <br/>
taught using candles.<br/>
<br/>
In my elementary and junior high school days, I was not only interested <br/>
in catching insects, but in plants as well. I wanted to try my hand at <br/>
making a beautiful flower bloom. What is now known as electronics also <br/>
caught my fancy, and I made several radios using crystal, and later, a <br/>
vacuum tube and transistor.<br/>
<br/>
These were times of change for Japan. The country was moving out of its <br/>
war stricken poverty and gradually into economic recovery. Efforts to <br/>
learn from the West and make advances in science and technology, which <br/>
had fallen behind during the war years, were beginning to bear fruit.<br/>
<br/>
Plastics was a good example. Ordinary, everyday items were now being made <br/>
out of this material.<br/>
<br/>
When graduating from junior high school, we each wrote a composition <br/>
about our future, and I wrote that I wanted to go on to college to study <br/>
plastics. I soon forgot about the piece, and how I came to write what I <br/>
did. I lost the composition itself.<br/>
<br/>
On the day that I retired from Tsukuba University, I locked the door to <br/>
my office, which I had cleaned out over the course of the year, and <br/>
headed home after returning my key, ID, health insurance certificate and <br/>
other items.<br/>
<br/>
I could not help but feel a tinge of loneliness when I realized I would <br/>
no longer be working with my students, but I was satisfied with my <br/>
accomplishments. Although I would have no title, I was thrilled to think <br/>
that I had 24 hours a day to do as I pleased without any obligations.<br/>
<br/>
It was on this day that I suddenly remembered what I had written in <br/>
junior high school. I had an urge to know why, how, and for what purpose <br/>
I had wanted to study plastics at that age. I no longer had the book of <br/>
compositions, however, and had been so out of touch with my former <br/>
classmates that I could not bring myself to ask someone to lend me a copy <br/>
after all these years.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, when I received this century&#39;s last Nobel award in chemistry <br/>
along with two of my friends, the morning newspapers carrying the news <br/>
also printed my composition, which I read for the first time in over 40 <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago, one of my former classmates was kind enough to send me a <br/>
copy of the book, so I now know that it was titled &quot;Michishirube,&quot; or <br/>
Guidepost, a collection of compositions written by the fourth graduating <br/>
class of Takayama Municipal Public Junior High School No. 2. I would like <br/>
to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to my classmate.<br/>
<br/>
After reading my composition, I was struck by how well I had understood <br/>
plastic as a junior high school student.<br/>
<br/>
Making observations, or seeing things as they are, is the key to studying <br/>
chemistry as well as all fields of science. It seems I had mastered the <br/>
skill of observation while running around the mountains looking for <br/>
insects, or sitting in front of the stove watching the fire burn.<br/>
<br/>
Why? My work, which was honored by the Nobel prize, was born out of <br/>
observing and learning from failed experiments. If I had not paid close <br/>
attention, it may have ended as just another experiment gone wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike physics, many students say chemistry is difficult because there is <br/>
much to be memorized. True, compared to physics, which attempts to <br/>
organize natural phenomena into a unified system, chemistry, which deals <br/>
with a variety of matter produced by chemical reactions, must seem <br/>
complex indeed. But if one has a clear sense of purpose, and the will to <br/>
learn, knowledge will follow.<br/>
<br/>
Upon receiving the Nobel award this year, I was pleasantly surprised to <br/>
find that I was congratulated not only by my colleagues, but also by <br/>
children, students from junior high, high school and college, and many, <br/>
many others.<br/>
<br/>
I was especially touched when about 30 fifth grade children from a school <br/>
nearby wrote essays to celebrate my award and personally delivered them <br/>
to my house with their teacher. They came back on another day with a <br/>
model of an atom they had made in science class, and hung it on my hat <br/>
rack.<br/>
<br/>
Concern has been raised that the younger generation tends to shy away <br/>
from studying science, but let me say that children do like and have a <br/>
natural interest in the subject. It is up to adults to make sure that <br/>
this interest does not wither.<br/>
