<div id="ygrps-yiv-322152997">Whooohooo!!!<br/>
<br/>
I did it, and it felt GOOD.<br/>
<br/>
Out and about for errands yesterday we drove past a shop my 14 yo <br/>
had seen once before.  It&#39;s called 1300AD, medieval weaponry etc.  <br/>
My dd loves this stuff, sparked by the &#39;Redwall&#39; series.  She <br/>
mentioned she&#39;d like to go in one day when we had time.<br/>
<br/>
You should have seen the smile on her face when I turned the car <br/>
around and parked in front of the shop.  The next half hour she <br/>
spent wallowing in flashes of silver and the smell of sweaty leather <br/>
(they teach swordsmanship there too).  <br/>
<br/>
She is now enrolled in their basic 6 week course and looking forward <br/>
to the tournament held in June near us.<br/>
<br/>
I have been immersing myself in articles about not controlling, not <br/>
limiting, not setting the childrens&#39; courses.  Believe me when I say <br/>
I really have to work hard. I was a hard core dominator for a long <br/>
long time.  I am trying so hard to be able to say &#39;yes&#39;.  It&#39;ll get <br/>
easier?....&#39;yes&#39;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOOK at the result of not putting her off, of saying &quot;yes&quot; right  <br/>
now!!! Of course it&#39;ll get easier, you just have to look at all  <br/>
she&#39;ll be learning and how much joy you&#39;ve added to her life. You&#39;ll  <br/>
WANT to keep doing that.<br/>

feedback to make it easier next time.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be hard work if you change your principles.  I&#39;m guessing if  <br/>
you&#39;ve found the &quot;yes&quot; articles you&#39;ve also found the principles vs.  <br/>
rules things, but just in case you hadn&#39;t, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>

<br/>
If the principle is to work hard, you will continue to &quot;have to&quot; work  <br/>
hard.<br/>
If the principle is to create an environment of opportunities and joy  <br/>
for your children, then the decisions will not be hard work.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me when I say you do NOT really have to work hard.  You could  <br/>
put your children in school, but somehow you chose to homeschool.   <br/>
You chose that.<br/>
You could be using a curriculum, but for some reason you chose  <br/>
unschooling.  You didn&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
You could have driven right by that shop, but you chose to pull in.   <br/>
You did not &quot;have to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe you when you say you really &quot;have to&quot; work hard. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I believe you believe it, though.<br/>
Easy change to make, to see your own power to choose or to feel  <br/>
powerless.<br/>
<br/>
You have choices and make them every moment.  Help your children have  <br/>
opportunities to do so as well.<br/>
