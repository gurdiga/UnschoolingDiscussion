<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034472674">we call these cinnamon yummies:<br/>
<br/>
pour an inch, inch and a half of high-flashpoint cooking oil in a small iron pan... cut a flour tortilla in small pieces.  heat the oil &#39;til it&#39;s hot.  gently place the tortilla pieces in hot oil quickly, one by one.  they should bubble and float up to the surface immediately.  cook for like 30 seconds on each side, drain in a strainter, take 1/2 cup of sugar and 2-3 tbsp of cinnamon and shake the crispies in a paper bag.  or just sprinkle cinnamon-sugar on.  <br/>

cheers ~ nina<br/>

I&#39;m astounded-and jealous! Cinnamon Crispas have been gone from Taco Bells in <br/>
NE Ohio for decades!! They were my FAVORITE item there-besides the <br/>
bellbeefer... Now they have those nasty &quot;styrofoam&quot; Cinnamon Twists. How close is the <br/>
nearest Taco Bell to the conference hotel?!<br/>
