<div id="ygrps-yiv-198256763">Here&#39;s some interesting info on the polio vaccine from the book I&#39;m<br/>
currently reading, &quot;The Vaccine Guide: Making An Informed Choice&quot; by<br/>
Randall Neustaedter OMD<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wild polio does not exist in the United States or the Western<br/>
Hemisphere at this time. One case of paralytic poliomyelitis was<br/>
reported in Peru in 1991.... Since that time the Americas have been<br/>
polio-free. ... All cases of paralytic polio in this country since 1979<br/>
were either caused by the oral vaccine or contracted in a foreign<br/>
country during travel. ... An average of 8 cases of vaccine-associated<br/>
paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) occur each year in the United States....<br/>
The risk of acquiring wild polio in the United States is zero.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He also states that polio can be contracted by contact with the feces of<br/>
a person recently vaccinated with the oral (live) vaccine. And, in<br/>
addition to the neurological damage that any vaccine can cause, the<br/>
polio vaccine has been implicated in the spread of certain monkey<br/>
viruses, such as SIV - and may have been the cause of HIV (although the<br/>
author does not directly state that). There IS a way to vaccinate for<br/>
polio that is relatively safe, though, and involves two or more doses of<br/>
the killed vaccine followed by the oral (live) vaccine. <br/>
<br/>
Scary stuff, here. The profit motive for pushing vaccines is huge, and<br/>
the fact that the very people who are profiting also have the power to<br/>
*require* the whole population to consume their product... wow. <br/>
