<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If he&#39;s fascinated with a game you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; unwilling to try to play or to watch him play for a couple of hours, then<br/>
&gt; just operate on the assumption that it&#39;s fascinating and don&#39;t criticize him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where I am.  I&#39;m involved in and interested in so many of Tim&#39;s<br/>
interests.  But I just cannot summon one iota of interest in PacMan.  I have<br/>
been called over to see many things, and have (hopefully) appeared duly<br/>
interested.  But the brutal truth is that I can hardly even see the darn<br/>
things on the gameboy screen.  My vision ain&#39;t so great anymore...<br/>
<br/>
I do feel bad some days that I&#39;m not more involved in that.  But I&#39;ve quit<br/>
worrying about the hours spent on it, and have cheered his winning.<br/>
<br/>
Today he was commenting that there was a &quot;thing&quot; on the PacMan game that<br/>
looked a lot like Gandolf&#39;s staff, and also like a Bishop&#39;s staff.<br/>
Interesting connection.  I suppose this, too, is educational, huh, Sandra?<br/>

the concept of artistic motifs cross cultures.<br/>
