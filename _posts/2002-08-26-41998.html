<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691254601">I was searching google for a link to send a pal of mine about the <br/>
book &quot;Colouring outside the lines&quot;.<br/>
Check out what I stumbled across.....isn&#39;t serendipity great?<br/>

Here&#39;s an excerpt:<br/>
The Spellbound development team began when a group of successful <br/>
business people got together and asked, &quot;what has brought us <br/>
success?&quot; They found that none of them looked back to school or <br/>
university for the answer. The skills and mindsets that allowed them <br/>
to stand out from the crowd had been developed elsewhere. They set <br/>
out to discover how these skills and mindsets could be taught to <br/>
young people, especially in a South African context, in order to give <br/>
all young South Africans a head start in the global economy. The <br/>
result is the Spellbound dream.</div>
