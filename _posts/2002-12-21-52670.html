<div id="ygrps-yiv-804561055">My husband took the kids to do the remaining Christmas shopping today.  He <br/>
couldn&#39;t find a double stroller cart at Kohls and our daughter ran away from <br/>
him.  Both kids do this from time to time, my son is four and my daughter is <br/>
three.<br/>
<br/>
This time it was a huge store and Mark really couldn&#39;t find her.  He asked a <br/>
clerk, couldn&#39;t describe Julia, was worried that Nathan was about to bolt too <br/>
and was just in a fog looking for her and panicking.  He vaguely remembers an <br/>
announcement over the PA but has no idea of they secured the exits.  Ten <br/>
minutes later (for some reason he looked at his watch), another female clerk <br/>
came up holding Julia&#39;s hand.  &quot;Is this your daughter?&quot;  Why didn&#39;t she ask <br/>
Julia if Mark was her father???<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so my issue isn&#39;t with the store, but with the child.  Both kids <br/>
actually.  One of my biggest fears in taking them to huge public places alone <br/>
is that I wont be able to keep track of them.  They are too young, at least <br/>
Julia is, to understand the danger.  And I don&#39;t want to scare them too much. <br/>
 But whatever we have said in the past hasn&#39;t worked.  They understand that <br/>
it scares us, that we might not be able to find them, that something bad <br/>
could happen.  Or at least, we have told them that.  I&#39;m not at all sure they <br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
Help, help, help.  I love to give them the freedom to walk in stores instead <br/>
of being secured to a stroller or cart.  They are pretty respectful of stuff <br/>
and have never broken anything.  But should I strap them in?  Remember, I&#39;m <br/>
walking slowly and mostly with one crutch.  They are so tired of sitting <br/>
around at home.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice you can give me would be appreciated.  I would have been a basket <br/>
case if that had happened to me.  I remember locking Nathan in the car when <br/>
they were about a little less than two and three.  I stood there in a silent <br/>
scream next to my car with Julia in the stroller, hands glued to my face, <br/>
tears streaming down, unable to move or utter a sound.  Luckily, several <br/>
women and a non-English speaking lawn maintenance guy came out of nowhere to <br/>
help.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought we were over this stage!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ew, what a dilemma.  I think I&#39;d try to stay home if I could.  Alternatively, <br/>
I&#39;d find a place to take them where I could let them just go (a park with a <br/>
fence?  A McDonald&#39;s Play place? even though I hate those).  <br/>
<br/>
Can the older one be shown boundaries (be able to hear his voice, or within <br/>
sight or no farther away than the other end of an aisle) and you hold on <br/>
tight to the little one?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why your hubby was worried about the bigger one getting <br/>
away after the little one ran off?  Why didn&#39;t he grab him right away?  <br/>
<br/>
I lost Jake in K-Mart when he was 18 months old.  He was toddling around <br/>
behind me, and he went one way and I went the other.  We were each looking <br/>
for each other, but he going the opposite direction and having near misses.  <br/>
An employee found him just as I was running towards the front to get a page <br/>
going.  This was 19 years ago, before they had all the &quot;procedures&quot; for such <br/>
a thing.  It is heart-stopping.  <br/>
<br/>
Prevention and anticipation is the only thing I can think of.  Anticipate <br/>
how/when it might happen by knowing what attracts them, and divert attention <br/>
or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope your leg heals fast!<br/>

wasn&#39;t going to be able to catch up with Julia.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used a jump rope before, having them hold onto it while we walked <br/>
somewhere, that might work with crutches.  But they can still just let go.  <br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll just strap them in the stroller until they get it.  At what age do <br/>
kids get it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275230586">When my daughter was just a little one herself, Adam Walsh was abducted and <br/>
killed. It happened in the same shopping plaza we shopped in and still do <br/>
now. My daughter at that time would love to hide in the clothing racks and <br/>
not answer when called. After that happened to the little Walsh boy, I <br/>
explained to her not in great detail what happened. I told her some people <br/>
will take little children and hurt them. It was very important that she not <br/>
leave my sight. If she couldn&#39;t see me, than I couldn&#39;t see her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done that with all 3 younger ones. I make them understand from early on <br/>
how dangerous it could be for them to be away from me in a store. They also <br/>
understand procedures if they are at sports camp and someone asks them to go <br/>
with them, whether it&#39;s someone they know or not. We&#39;ve gone over what to do <br/>
in case someone does try to take them and even what to do if they find <br/>
themselves in a car with a stranger. I felt bad about having to deal with <br/>
such things and little children, but I&#39;ve seen too much sorrow with kids <br/>
being taking in just a matter of a minute. I take the precaution. If I have <br/>
to go out shopping with all 3, I take another pair of eyes. And my kids are <br/>
2, 7 and 8. Even at that age, I need to keep track of them. If I can&#39;t have <br/>
someone with me, I put the youngest in a stroller or buggy. I may let her <br/>
out in the toy aisle and make sure all 3 stay with me. Rather have them <br/>
upset with me about that then go through losing them. Of course now my kids <br/>
know enough to be careful. Even the 2 year old understands. But when I need <br/>
to shop as in look for something, she&#39;s in the buggy.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve scared them silly. I use to worry about my oldest and <br/>
such things but she has grown up understanding even now, at 17 how important <br/>
it is to be aware. She uses her head now as she has learned form early on. <br/>
Not just children get abducted.<br/>
<br/>
I say do what it takes to make sure the kids stay safe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555207175">Once ours got to be about 2-3, we had to address just how free<br/>
they would be in public places.  The week before Christmas is NOT<br/>
a good time to learn the skills, LOL.  What we agreed on is<br/>
counting.  I did not want to call their names, lest some stranger<br/>
say &quot;Hi Johnny, your Mom is right over here&quot; and abscond with<br/>
them.  I demonstrated for them the &quot;count&quot; as done by a parent<br/>
planning to whale the living day lights out of a child.  When<br/>
they heard it in my voice, they learned they were to make contact<br/>
ASAP.  If they didn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t remember, then we did the<br/>
freedom/responsibility conversation at their level of<br/>
understanding.  It amuses me to see folks assume that I am about<br/>
to spank a child, when we are using a code for their freedom to<br/>
roam.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10272560">One thing my dh and I do when we have young kids who we are taking into<br/>
crowded situations, and who  can&#39;t yet tell their phone number etc. or can,<br/>
but may be too upset to do so, is to give them my dh&#39;s business card, or<br/>
some other such device, either pinning it on in the case of a very young<br/>
child, or letting them keep it in their pocket etc.  <br/>
<br/>
When we went to the Rally for Israel, as we were in a different state, we<br/>
had my daughter&#39;s cell phone on it (she was with us) as well as my dh&#39;s<br/>
phone numbers (he was home) and where to meet us in case we got separated.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion.<br/>

<br/>
be well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167715150">I have a 4 year old daughter and a 3 year old son.  I tell them before they <br/>
get in the car, and when we&#39;re in the store that they have to stay with me at <br/>
all times or we will leave.  If they go away from me, we leave.  It works for <br/>
me.  They haven&#39;t left my side for a long time.  I keep reminding them over <br/>
and over.  I also explain why it&#39;s important to stay close to me.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think it makes them scared or worried.  I tell them it&#39;s important to stay <br/>
close to me and not run away because they could get lost, and that most <br/>
people are nice but there are not-so-nice people out there that may want to <br/>
take you away from me and I&#39;ll never see you again.<br/>
<br/>
This may or may not work for your children.  I find that if my children do <br/>
something wrong there has to be a consequence, even though the consequence <br/>
may be hard on me too.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find if my children do something wrong, there is ALWAYS a consequence!<br/>
( I realize the content that this was said in AND the ages involved, I just <br/>
had a thought.) Getting lost IS the consequence. Feeling scared IS the <br/>
consequence. and what caused it? Me. I became distracted or busy or I didn&#39;t <br/>
pay enough attention.<br/>
Not because I am a ditzbrain or don&#39;t care or am lazy, but because I came <br/>
into the store to do something specific. So my little one stays in the cart <br/>
or with someone who CAN watch him. I don&#39;t think that a child getting away in <br/>
the store is doing something &quot;wrong&quot;, he is exploring and learning! Seeing <br/>
what is cool and interesting in his world.. So it&#39;s important to let him have <br/>
that freedom, when I am free to pay attention. When I am done with what I <br/>
have to do, or sooner if it becomes evident that my child would like to have <br/>
a little freedom and I am taking F o r e v e r ! 10 minutes debating over <br/>
orange vs. purple towels is WAY longer to the kids than to us.<br/>
Thye reason this captured my attention is because of my sensitivity to <br/>
negative thoughts and words, no matter who subtly negative.<br/>
It&#39;s not the child who is doing something wrong or misbehaving. They are <br/>
doing what they are supposed to do as children. The little girl who took off <br/>
may have had no inkling that that was scary or worrisome, and may have been <br/>
very surprised to see Dad&#39;s reaction.<br/>
Something I am working hard on is remembering to act on what I believe so <br/>
strongly. That Kids Come First. They need to do what they desire just as much <br/>
as I do. I can be &quot;in charge&quot; and tell them what they can and can&#39;t do, OR I <br/>
can work their needs in so that they get to do, see, touch, move as much as <br/>
I.<br/>
That&#39;s one of the few reasons that the superstores are good, I can throw BOTH <br/>
towels in the bigass cart and debate the colors while standing in the toy <br/>
section!<br/>

one thing we forgot to do when we moved into our new place, and that was <br/>
designate a location to meet outside if the house caught on fire and we all <br/>
had to get out separately.  I was happy about his matter-of-factness.  We <br/>
talked a little again about how you don&#39;t go back in for pets or for anyone <br/>
else.  He doesn&#39;t worry about a house fire, he&#39;s just prepared as best he can <br/>
be.  <br/>
<br/>
In my mind I was wondering why I still have a bit of worry about scaring him <br/>
when it comes to abduction and molestation.  We use a password system when we <br/>
have to be apart (he&#39;s too old to go in the ladies room with me anymore).  <br/>
We&#39;ve talked about how to disable a car, how to get other people&#39;s attention <br/>
if he&#39;s been kidnapped.  All stuff I got from that website.  But I still <br/>
worry about him becoming scared and living in fear.  I&#39;m trying to get over <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I know plenty of moms who have such an aura of fear around their kids when <br/>
they&#39;re out in public, it&#39;s worrisome.  They are telegraphing so much fear <br/>
that their blood pressure has to be rising.  That just can&#39;t be good for <br/>
their kids or themselves.  I don&#39;t want Will to get the idea that there are <br/>
bad guys lurking around every corner, you know?  <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m thinking that if he can talk about such stuff like he talks about fire <br/>
safety and what to do then, he&#39;s going to be all right.  But I have a lot of <br/>
work to do on my own emotions about that stuff before I can even approach him <br/>
most of the time.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the best things I learned from the website...not to be afraid <br/>
to discuss it, and it to treat abduction issues like we do other safety <br/>
things, while not transmitting our overt fear as well.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Thanks Mary.  I guess I should just tell them what can really happen.  And <br/>
if it sinks in, then we are ok.  I try not to take them on long, boring <br/>

Thank you for not thinking I meant to like beat them into listening. After I <br/>
read it I thought maybe some might get the wrong impression. Of course I <br/>
don&#39;t make things up to scare the hell out of them either. But when I <br/>
thought it was necessary I would let them know about certain events that <br/>
happened and we would talk about how we or they would handle that if it came <br/>
up. I don&#39;t really force info on my kids, but when it comes to this, I do <br/>
what I need to do so they understand. Like I said, my 17 year old was never <br/>
traumatized but still very aware of safety. Heck, I even look around in my <br/>
own driveway before I get out of the van. Common sense.<br/>

were with my husband, not with me.  And he said he almost turned around and <br/>
left when there weren&#39;t any double carts.  He should have.  Plus, it was <br/>
crowded and loud, they aren&#39;t good in loud situations.  <br/>
<br/>
We dont&#39; shop often, it&#39;s not a great past time with me.  Mostly we go to <br/>
Trader Joes, which is small, for groceries and they push their own carts.  Or <br/>
we go to Target and they sit in one of those double cart things and pretend <br/>
like they are in a parade, waving and all.  I should have known better than <br/>
to send them all out the last Saturday before Christmas!<br/>

I agree with you completely.  Julia in no way did it to scare her father or <br/>
to be a pest.  She just wandered off, maybe running towards something <br/>
interesting to her.  And frankly, a display of ceramic coffee mugs would not <br/>
have been interesting even to me!<br/>
<br/>
They have never had any separation anxiety until I broke my ankle and had <br/>
nannies running around.  Never cried when we left, always assumed we would be <br/>
back.  And she just assumed that her father would find her.  Which he did.  I <br/>
think she was a bit scared, but she says she wasn&#39;t.  That&#39;s consequence <br/>
enough for us.<br/>
<br/>
From her point of view, nothing bad happened.  From our point of view, it was <br/>
a near miss.  And an eye opener.  And a guilt and anxiety producer.  And <br/>
hopefully something we will learn from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43152528"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I find if my children do something wrong, there is ALWAYS a consequence!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>( I realize the content that this was said in AND the ages involved, I just <br/>
had a thought.) Getting lost IS the consequence. Feeling scared IS the <br/>
consequence. and what caused it? Me. I became distracted or busy or I didn&#39;t <br/>
pay enough attention.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sometimes getting lost teaches children not to do it again and feeling <br/>
scared does too, but there are many instances I&#39;ve seen where the child took <br/>
off and was where they wanted to be and wasn&#39;t scared or in their opinion <br/>
lost.  They were where they wanted to be.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that 3 and 4 are young, but we often don&#39;t realize that kids can <br/>
understand and learn more than what we think.  I realize in my post that I <br/>
came across as someone who uses a &quot;negative&quot; approach most of the time.  <br/>
Actually, I use distraction, a lot of praise and attention, food and snacks <br/>
for long shopping times, and I always thank them for helping me, for <br/>
listening to me, and for behaving in a public place.  It&#39;s been a long time <br/>
since I had any problems with my children at a public place.  I can take them <br/>
to nice restaurants, departments stores, libraries and other places without <br/>
worrying or dealing with misbehavior.  We all have a wonderful time.  They <br/>
understand there are times and places where they can do certain things, and <br/>
time and places where they are expected to behave in a certain manner.  I <br/>
teach them that it&#39;s important for them to tell me about what they want to <br/>
do, how they&#39;re feeling, and if they need something, instead of throwing a <br/>
temper tantrum or running off.  My children are also 3 and 4.  We were <br/>
recently in a Meijer department store and my daughter took a few steps away <br/>
from me to go and look at a few Dora toys.  She stopped and turned around and <br/>
asked me if she could look at them.  I told her sure we can do that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the consequence for having to leave a public place because my children <br/>
won&#39;t stay with me is because once they won&#39;t listen and I can&#39;t insure their <br/>
safety, I feel we&#39;d better leave.  It&#39;s true I could strap them in a cart, <br/>
but my kids don&#39;t like being in carts, especially for long outings.  In this <br/>
situation, I feel we misewell just leave.  I want my children to explore and <br/>
have fun in public places instead of having to be strapped in.  That&#39;s why I <br/>
taught them at an early age to stay with me at all times.  Children&#39;s <br/>
maturity may play an important part in that, or their behavior.  Some <br/>
children are very spontaneous, active, and/or have a hard time listening to <br/>
authority.  These children may need to be kept at home if mommy or daddy <br/>
can&#39;t watch them carefully.     <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Not because I am a ditzbrain or don&#39;t care or am lazy, but because I came <br/>
 </span></blockquote>into the store to do something specific. So my little one stays in the cart <br/>
or with someone who CAN watch him. I don&#39;t think that a child getting away in <br/>
the store is doing something &quot;wrong&quot;, he is exploring and learning! Seeing <br/>
what is cool and interesting in his world.. So it&#39;s important to let him have <br/>
that freedom, when I am free to pay attention. <br/>
<br/>
I agree that often times its the parents who are at fault for their chidren&#39;s <br/>
behavior.  One thing I&#39;ve noticed, at least with my children and with others, <br/>
is once they taste the sweet flavor of freedom, they don&#39;t want to be in the <br/>
cart even for a few minutes.  It&#39;s true that for their safety, they can stay <br/>
in the cart, no matter what temper tantrum and whining and crying they do, <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t make a very pleasant time for anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
I happen to disagree that a child taking off has not done something wrong, <br/>
depending on the child and what the child has been taught.  Children at that <br/>
age can learn and understand why it&#39;s important to stay with mommy or daddy.  <br/>
I&#39;m not saying that parents can be oblivious to what their children are doing <br/>
while they&#39;re in a public place and expect children to always remember and <br/>
follow their instructions.  I remind them, have them help me choose things, <br/>
talk with them, aks them questions, etc.  There is no parent who wants to <br/>
experience the horror and feeling when their child is out of sight at a <br/>
public place, but most parents have at least once.  I know when I had that <br/>
scary feeling happen to me I decided it would never happen again.<br/>
<br/>
Something I am working hard on is remembering to act on what I believe so <br/>
strongly. That Kids Come First. They need to do what they desire just as much <br/>
as I do. I can be &quot;in charge&quot; and tell them what they can and can&#39;t do, OR I <br/>
can work their needs in so that they get to do, see, touch, move as much as <br/>
I.<br/>
That&#39;s one of the few reasons that the superstores are good, I can throw BOTH <br/>
towels in the bigass cart and debate the colors while standing in the toy <br/>
section!<br/>
<br/>
I strongly agree that kids come first, but what does that mean and at what <br/>
expense.  I know there&#39;s a method out there that teaches parents to let their <br/>
kids explore, never use any negative connotations, and let them be creative <br/>
and explore all they want.  I&#39;ve seen kids who have been raised this way to <br/>
an extreme and I don&#39;t want my kids to grow up like that.  They have no <br/>
respect for others feelings and belongings.  They do what they want, no <br/>
matter who it might bother, upset, or hurt.  The children I&#39;m talking about <br/>
had parents who went to the extreme.  I&#39;m not saying you are this way.  No <br/>
one would ever want to be around these kids, and they could not find any <br/>
babysitters.  They could not go anywhere with them without embarassment, <br/>
tantrums and a lot of hassles.  I love children and I realize that their <br/>
behavior is not their fault, but I can&#39;t stand to be around these children.  <br/>
They break toys with no remorse, throw things to see how neat a golf ball can <br/>
bounce on the wall and hit a kid in the head, color on walls and toys, and <br/>
ignore and have no respect for anyone&#39;s feelings or adult authority.  They do <br/>
all these things because the parents taught them that they are more important <br/>
than anyone else and if they want to be creative by taking apart a friend&#39;s <br/>
toy, or running and jumping up and down a restaurant aisle, that it&#39;s okay <br/>
because parents shouldn&#39;t tell their children what to do and how to behave.  <br/>
As a parent, I feel we need to use a combination of different methods to help <br/>
our children explore, learn, and understand the world we live in.  We don&#39;t <br/>
live in a world where we can do whatever we want at all times.  My children <br/>
are happy and wonderful to be around.  I don&#39;t think I stifle their <br/>
curiosities, their need for exploration, and their desire to learn about the <br/>
world around them.  They have many opportunities to do this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521217826">I do love having my children close together.  One thing that used to bother <br/>
me was people&#39;s reaction when they would ask how close they are and I would <br/>
tell them.  I would get comments like &quot;aren&#39;t you crazy&quot;, &quot;I bet you&#39;re hands <br/>
are full&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m glad mine aren&#39;t close together&quot;.  As I got better at <br/>
replying to their stupid comments, I would say things like &quot;better my hands <br/>
full than empty&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not crazy, just a happy mother&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s true that <br/>
having children close in age brings on many challenges, and patience is very <br/>
important.  It&#39;s good that your kids aren&#39;t close in age if you feel you <br/>
couldn&#39;t handle it.  I&#39;m handling it just fine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever had strangers or others make comments like this?  I find it to <br/>
be rude sometimes on their part.  I know they are not trying to be hurtful, <br/>
but sometimes their tone and facial expressions are very hurtful.  I have no <br/>
regrets having this close.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you thought my advice was or might be helpful.  As parents, we all <br/>
are just learning.  I feel a good parent is one who learns from mistakes, <br/>
tries different things if one thing isn&#39;t working, shows lots of love, and is <br/>
unselfish.  It&#39;s not easy.  <br/>

I get comments like this all the time. When the 6 and 7 year olds were <br/>

Sometimes people laugh and say they could never handle more than two and <br/>
some people actually seem horrified. I have said to those people on occasion <br/>
that it&#39;s an awful thing to say to someone. Hell if they are that rude, what <br/>
do I care what I say?<br/>
<br/>
I make it a point to tell people I speak to how wonderful that they are <br/>
having another child or that they have a big family when I see it. Strangers <br/>
that I see in stores. They always seem so happy to have some support and to <br/>
hear people say how wonderful. I assume they hear the bad stuff like I do <br/>

holler &quot;Cameron Check&quot;, there should be a &quot;Mommy Check&quot; yelled right back. My <br/>
concern was that if he were too engrossed in whatever he was doing, he might <br/>
not WANT to answer because he might be afraid that I&#39;d take him away from <br/>

stores (though I&#39;m never THAT far away), at ballgames, and even in the house <br/>
when I just need to locate him. There&#39;s never the possibility that I&#39;ll take <br/>
him away or stop him from playing---it&#39;s just a check.<br/>

Cameron now uses it with Duncan when he&#39;s watching (or not! &lt;G&gt;) Duncan. It&#39;s <br/>
peace of mind.<br/>

label.  But now that they are older and my three year old is so much shorter <br/>
than the four year old, they look to strangers like they are the socially <br/>
acceptable two years apart.<br/>
<br/>
I remember a day at the park when I saw a Mom of a baby 9 months pregnant <br/>
with her next.  One of my kids was on the slides, the other on the swings, so <br/>
she didn&#39;t see them both.  When I asked how far apart they would be, I saw <br/>
the look of dread on her face.  She cried when I told her that mine were one <br/>
year apart and that I felt it was the most joyous thing I had ever <br/>
experienced.  <br/>
<br/>
People are compelled to comment, for whatever reason.  I just amuse them.  <br/>
The best comment I ever got was when my mail carrier rang the doorbell with a <br/>
box after Julia was born.  She didn&#39;t need a signature, she just wanted to <br/>
see the baby.  I came up nursing Julia and carrying Nathan.  She said &quot;What <br/>
could be more perfect than that!&quot;<br/>

the early, baby years, but it definately was a challenge sometimes.  I would <br/>
not do anything differently.  When I see them together now, and when they <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616229556">When my dd was age 2-5, dh travelled a lot, and we were frequently at<br/>
the airport to drop him off and pick him up.  How easy it is for two<br/>
people to get separated in the rush of people going in all directions!<br/>
 I found a harness with a leash, for lack of a better description,<br/>
that dd could wear.  (It was in the infant/toddler section at Target,<br/>
I think.)  If anyone tried to get in between us, that strap prevented<br/>
it.  It was hot pink of course, so very visible.  It allowed dd to<br/>
walk in freedom, yet stay close by me.  It sounds like I was treating<br/>
my child like an animal, but it worked very well, and was much safer<br/>
than the straps with two velcro wrist wraps that can easily be taken<br/>
off.  Just an idea.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, in public restrooms when one of us is still in a stall, the other<br/>
stands outside the stall door with her foot sticking under the door. <br/>
Very easy to know where each other is.<br/>
