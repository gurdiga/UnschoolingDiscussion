<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190712093">I agree that this is not a healthy situation.  But I&#39;m also not convinced<br/>
that there was dire enough immediate need to warrant police interference to<br/>
&#39;offer&#39; &#39;help&#39; that was not wanted.  If the police wanted to impound<br/>
dangerous dogs who are loose as a means of protecting the public, for<br/>
instance, that&#39;s one thing.   But to show up with guns and badges,<br/>
potentially forcing entrance in order to drag away the children in order to<br/>
&#39;offer assistance&#39; is probably beyond warranted.<br/>
<br/>
I was pleased to note that the police department seems to have gone out of<br/>
their way to enlist the assistance of family friends, rather than resort<br/>
directly to force.  Wish I felt confident that all police officers would<br/>
react in such reasonable fashion.  I hope that prosecuting attorneys or any<br/>
other officials looking into this matter really think about what a threat<br/>
these officials represented to these children who were probably terrified<br/>
beyond anything they had previously experienced.  Whether others see this as<br/>
a threat or not, these children obviously considered the threat worse than<br/>
their circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have all the answers.  I can only say that having the police<br/>
forcefully remove me from my home when I was the 16 yr old left in charge of<br/>
her siblings was an extremely dramatic event in my life.  I still feel the<br/>
effects and have occasions stemming from this incident when I have to make a<br/>
very conscious decision to act rather than react.  It certainly didn&#39;t help<br/>
me or my family any.<br/>
<br/>
Background story...my mother would stay out for days with her boyfriend,<br/>
leaving me in charge of 4 younger siblings.  Were we neglected?  Definitely.<br/>
Was it any help or less traumatic to be drug out of the house by<br/>
policemen...I don&#39;t think so.  We were returned to our home within less than<br/>
a week and the only thing that changed is that my mother got sneakier.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, I had to save myself by refusing to have a relationship with my<br/>
parents.  Could foster care or any other government funded program do that<br/>
for me before I was ready?  I don&#39;t think so.  Until I was ready and able to<br/>
do something for myself, any attempts to &#39;help&#39; would have been useless.  I<br/>
believe the programs need to be there for those who truly need it and/or<br/>
request help.  But I also believe that our society is quick to interfere<br/>
without thinking about whether the standards we so readily accept are really<br/>
as cut and dried as they appear.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, is it better to remove these children and send each of them to<br/>
a separate foster home (assuming any can even be found) or to leave them<br/>
together and relying on each other and whatever resources are still in their<br/>
home.  Eating lily pads and/or pond water soup may not be desirable to<br/>
everyone, but who&#39;s to say this is worse than the alternative.   Sometimes<br/>
the hidden injuries are much worse than the obvious external ones.<br/>
<br/>
Just in case anyone thinks differently, I am not in any way advocating that<br/>
children who are being actively abused should be left with abusive families.<br/>
OTOH I don&#39;t think it does a lot of good to forcibly remove children from an<br/>
undesirable environment when they obviously do not want help and there is<br/>
not real risk of imminent injury.<br/>
<br/>
Care must be used in deciding what is better and I&#39;m not convinced that well<br/>
meaning officials consistently take the time to really think about which is<br/>
better, &#39;rescuing&#39; or letting things be.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have enough first hand information about this case to really know<br/>
whether the officials&#39; actions were justified or not.  But I do have enough<br/>
first hand experience to know this will be a traumatic experience for these<br/>
children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, hating and fearing authority isn&#39;t healthy - understanding it and<br/>
disliking it is another matter *G*. And ANY domestic animal allowed to<br/>
go feral, much less encouraged to do so is a danger. But knowing how to<br/>
handle guns IS a healthy thing. THAT is a knowledge that can save lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697411377">Number 3 son had 17 stitches in his foot when he stepped on a piece of glass<br/>
when he was 5.  Those 17 stitches only covered about 2.5 to 3&quot; of skin.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if those dogs had attacked someone, there wouldn&#39;t have been any<br/>
someone left to complain about 17 stitches.  That&#39;s a fact!  They would have<br/>
been drug down, mauled and killed very quickly!<br/>
<br/>
And so far, all these reports about the &quot;evil&quot; dogs have been strickly<br/>
rumors.  Had the dog attack actually happened, according to bil who lives in<br/>
the next town, the dogs would have been hauled off and euthenized promptly!<br/>
(Actually, he said the county animal control agent with the help of the cops<br/>
would have shot the dogs but not to tell any city folks that because it<br/>
upsets them.)  And I notice that no one is coming up with a copy of any<br/>
report on this supposed attack.<br/>

public property.  The only reference to location is that of a person  &quot;walking<br/>
near the house&quot;.    A house located on 40 acres and with signs warning folks to<br/>
stay away.    For all we know,  dogs chased and bit someone who was either<br/>

property.<br/>

Are y ou saying that if while bicycling a paved road,   you or your child hit a<br/>
pebble and take a tumble,  you would  be upset because you would consider the<br/>

stitches to be &quot;severe&quot;?<br/>

One&#39;s babies shouldn&#39;t be bitten by anyone else&#39;s dogs, and the number of <br/>
stitches required shoudln&#39;t be used to pooh-pooh such an attack.<br/>
<br/>
Whether these particular dogs bit anyone on or off their property doesn&#39;t <br/>
concern me.  That someone would say &quot;JUST 17 stitches is no big deal&quot; does.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids are breaking into your house and your dog bites them in the face, <br/>
fine--they asked for it.  If my kids are just being and your dog bites them, <br/>
I&#39;ll be grumpy and I won&#39;t consider it a &quot;boo-boo.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615549737">I agree that this is not a healthy situation.  But I&#39;m<br/>
also not convinced that there was dire enough<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;immediate need to warrant police interference to<br/>
&gt;&#39;offer&#39; &#39;help&#39; that was not wanted.  <br/>
&gt;........to show up with guns and badges, potentially<br/>
&gt;forcing entrance in order to drag away the children<br/>
&gt;in order to &#39;offer assistance&#39; is probably beyond<br/>
&gt;warranted.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I was pleased to note that the police department<br/>
&gt;seems to have gone out of their way to enlist the<br/>
&gt;assistance of family friends, rather than resort<br/>
&gt;directly to force.  <br/>
&gt;Eiraul<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just to put things in perspective, lets discuss<br/>
Northern Idaho.  Lost of wilderness and resort areas,<br/>
tiny communities where everyone knows everyone else. <br/>
The police are small town cops who know and care about<br/>
their neighbors.  They knew this family.  They did not<br/>
arrive with guns to kick in the door of the house and<br/>
drag out screaming children.  The arrived, spoke<br/>
calmly with one of the older boys for a time, and he<br/>
proceeded to run into the house shouting &quot;GET THE<br/>
GUNS!&quot;  and they let all the dogs loose on the<br/>
oficers.  The dogs had been locked in the basement via<br/>
a legal order to restrain them because of their wild<br/>
hunting and endangering neighbors.  They had probably<br/>
told him that his mother had been taken into custody<br/>
would be my guess.<br/>
<br/>
About that woman the dogs attacked, I should have said<br/>
the attack was serious and not necessarily the wounds.<br/>
 Luckily she was rescued by a Sheriff happening along,<br/>
who was also attacked and bitten despite firing his<br/>
weapon to scare them off.  ANY dog attack,<br/>
particularly pack attacks is not fun or minor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335795709">Thank you Lynda.<br/>
You&#39;ve said what I&#39;ve been thinking and wondering about.<br/>
I think this whole situation is an outrage!<br/>
<br/>
And yes, where is that extra money?<br/>
What is wrong with eating soup that is made from foraged food?<br/>
We do it.....does that mean my child is not healthy? heck no!<br/>
It has been proven that the children ARE healthy and still she is charged<br/>
with neglect.<br/>
<br/>
I was sickened to hear that they&#39;ve searched their home, and taken four of<br/>
their dogs too<br/>
(which they are already talking of adopting out!)<br/>
<br/>
Free country my ass!<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. McGuckin was right in not trusting the government.<br/>
Look what has happened to her family.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, Katseye</div>

You are so right!!!!!!!  How you view the world does determine how <br/>
the world treats you.<br/>
<br/>
And you know, there are probably a whole lot of people out there who, <br/>
like me, are listening to the reports, reading the papers, reading <br/>
the web boards and watching the news and holding our judgements until <br/>
the dust settles and we find out what&#39;s really going on. I tend to <br/>
believe that when the truth - the real truth; not the media and <br/>
not &#39;from someone who lives there&#39; reports - comes out it will <br/>
actually be somewhere between the &#39;what a horrible family&#39; and &#39;poor <br/>
victims&#39; views being cried in public right now.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s just wait and see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541156652"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Thank you Nanci. Do you live here in Idaho too? For<br/>
&gt;some reason all that was in my head about Idaho but I<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t bring it out properly. Also I can not say<br/>
&gt;enough how I know families like this who train their<br/>
&gt;children to use guns and the attitude that is<br/>
&gt;instilled. <br/>
&gt;NICKI~  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes I do live in Idaho.  I agree that there are a<br/>
number of families in this area whom have some<br/>
different ideas about things.  I know a number of<br/>
folks who are gun owners, and NOT responsible.  I know<br/>
one person who keeps multiple guns in his truck at all<br/>
times, which is stupid, as they are easy to get at by<br/>
people other than him.  Indeed a month ago he had his<br/>
truck broken into and several guns were stolen,<br/>
including an illegal assault rifle.  I shudder to<br/>
think of them in the hands of the burglar.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to stress again that there is a peculiar<br/>
culture in Northern Idaho and nothing surprises me<br/>
coming from there.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned that they thought there was a<br/>
connection between the local government and the folks<br/>
wanting to own the lakefront property.  I know that<br/>
much of the Sandpoint area, including the Ski Resort,<br/>
is owned by the Lewis family, whom a dear friend of<br/>
mine married into.  Small town government tends to be<br/>
in the hands of prominent citizens, many of whom<br/>
achieve their prominence through land and asset<br/>
holdings, business ownerships, etc.  One must also<br/>
realize that small resort towns are always striving to<br/>
improve their image, their trades and income, their<br/>
appeal to tourists, etc.  To say &quot;someone&quot; in the<br/>
governemt wants the lakefront property to be developed<br/>
is silly.  Of course they do.  That does not<br/>
necessarily mean that there is a conspiracy afoot, and<br/>
even if someone or someones are working to affect a<br/>
less than legal siezure of land, that does not mean it<br/>
is an overreaching plot amongst the entire staff of<br/>
the local authorities in their various offices.<br/>
<br/>
I do not argue that there is nothing fishy going on,<br/>
as it all seems to have gone down too fast and too<br/>
conveniently.  That area has as much nepotism as any<br/>
other tiny resort area, where folks look out for their<br/>
own.  People who isolate themselves would not have as<br/>
much public sentiment and position as beloved members<br/>
of the community, to some others in the community<br/>
either.<br/>
