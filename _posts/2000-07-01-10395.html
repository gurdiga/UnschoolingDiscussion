&gt; <br/>
&gt; this is something I&#39;m going to struggle with... On the one hand Steve and I<br/>
&gt; want some time together (to keep our marriage alive and working) and on the<br/>
&gt; other hand I don&#39;t want to restrict Zak and want to let him go to bed when he<br/>
&gt; wants.  We are going to talk about this issue tonight and see how we both<br/>
&gt; feel a bit more... The more I learn about unschooling the more I realize it<br/>
&gt; affects so many areas of our lives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for giving me something to think about.<br/>

9 yr old go to bed at 9pm. They have permission to read or play quietly<br/>
in their room until they&#39;re ready to fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Dh has a bit of a problem with this but he&#39;s getting used to the idea ..<br/>
he better get used to it they&#39;ve been doing bedtime this way for over a<br/>
year now &lt;bg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
We have quite a small house that really isn&#39;t meant for 5 people, 2<br/>
dogs, a cat, a rabbit, a guinea pig, a bird and 2 rats.<br/>
Privacy is at a premium and it&#39;s hard when the adults want some private<br/>
down time and the kids want to do things late into the night<br/>
independently.<br/>
