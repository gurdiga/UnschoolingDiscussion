finally took off reading at age 9 *after* I stopped all the interventions. I <br/>
am definitely of the opinion that we got in his way rather than helped him <br/>
at all. Luckily he still loves to read.<br/>

Casey became fluent at about 7 with an unschooling approach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100711784">Our oldest learned how to read in school, and with Bob Books at home.  I<br/>
pushed it on him.  At age 9, he loves reading before bedtime every night,<br/>
and here and there during the daytime.  He is into history books on WW2, and<br/>
anything having to do with the ocean and boats.<br/>
<br/>
Our 7 year old, I totally left alone.  He started wanting to read street<br/>
signs, and billboards (we are in the car a lot unfortunately :().  He is<br/>
reading so well, and I am glad that I let him alone to discover the joys of<br/>
reading.  He is my artistic guy, last night he told us that &quot;the fog is cool<br/>
Mom and Dad, it like, carries the light with it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Our almost 6 year old still does not even know the letters of the alphabet.<br/>
He is the one with terrible vision, and delays in his fine motor skills.  We<br/>
have gone over the alphabet many times, and he still only guesses at the<br/>
letters.  He still writes his name backwards, and used to write it both<br/>
upside down AND backwards.  I am still not worried, with two older brothers<br/>
reading, he is bound to want to do it sooner or later.  On the other hand,<br/>
he rides skateboards at the skateboard park, scooters, a dirt bike and is<br/>
very polished with his large motor skills.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone out there unschooling a child with delays?<br/>

Liam McClure&#39;s reading is documented in his mom&#39;s article which is up at <br/>
www.unschooling.com   (if you click on &quot;library&quot; you&#39;ll get it).<br/>
<br/>
Liam hardly spoke at all when he was little.  He would have been slammed into <br/>
special ed in a heartbeat if he&#39;d been in school.  He&#39;s almost 18 now, reads <br/>
fine, is confident and you would NOT ever, ever guess he had been delayed.<br/>
