<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477663304">Our 8 yo dd  had been commenting that many of her friends could read well<br/>
and that &quot;if i were in school...&quot;. I told her that she &#39;d learn to read when<br/>
she was ready--did she want to read? &quot;No&quot; was her reply--but she liked me to<br/>
make up sentences for her to read and then she&#39;d illustrate them(like<br/>
The fat man sipped cool water with a striped straw. or &quot;This must be the<br/>
place,&quot; said the Queen as she entered the elegant castle&quot;)  So I gave her<br/>
another sentence--she took one look at it and informed me&quot;Dont be offended,<br/>
Mom, but this is really stupid--I want to read books&quot; We went to a local<br/>
bookstore and she chose a book--a simplified Little House book. Yesterday<br/>
she went upstairs with her book. Last night she read a page and a bit.<br/>

      It sounds as though your seven year old  simply has a different<br/>
learning style than your five year old!  It might be helpful for you to<br/>
completely scrap any sort of phonics- based learning for him in an effort<br/>
to prevent further frustration.  You want to  preserve a love of reading<br/>
at any cost, since it will be helpful to him in the future and he truly<br/>
wants to read.  Perhaps you might try  backing off of any formal<br/>
instruction whatsoever and focus on relaxed reading activities such as<br/>
reading aloud, drawing pictures (which is how writing begins), and<br/>
letting him dictate stories to you which you write or type and make into<br/>
books, etc.  If he expresses anxiety at not knowing how to read, explain<br/>
that this is how reading begins, and he will certainly learn in time. <br/>
Some other activities he may enjoy include: <br/>
   -  labeling things or parts of a room (let him choose words)<br/>
  -  identifying words or phrases that appeal to him and hanging them up<br/>
  -  starting a word bank<br/>
   -reading, reading, reading books of his own choosing<br/>
<br/>
There are so many books on learning styles and learning to read, and so<br/>
many ways to teach children to read.  Since there are seven kinds of<br/>
intelligence and schools measure only two (one of which is phonics/<br/>
visual based), don&#39;t be at all surprised if your son does not fit the<br/>
typical mold.  As a reading teacher I have seen so many children with<br/>
reading &#39;difficulties&#39; which turned out not to be difficulties at all, <br/>
but only  alternative learning styles. Assure him that everything will be<br/>
fine, and  let him choose his own path so that he will always be in<br/>
control of the process.  You sound like a wonderful, supportive parent<br/>
and your boys are so lucky to have you!!  Remember that Grant Colfax of <br/>
&#39;Homeschooling for Excellence&#39; (who went on to Harvard), didn&#39;t learn to<br/>
read until he was nine years old!  <br/>
     Best of Luck!!     Amy in NY<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572122844">Frank Smith wrote _Insult to Intelligence_ and _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_.  In the first one, he blasts reading programs,  and talks about surounding children with the written word and reading to them. His Learner&#39;s Manifesto, which I will post when I find it--it&#39;s on this desk somewhere--is worth reading.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012499493">One of my sons struggled with reading up until the end of first <br/>
grade.  The other son seemed to be born knowing his alphabet and <br/>
being able to write.  To keep this little one happy I gave him a <br/>
large supply of post-it notes when he was three.  He labeled <br/>
everything in the house -- included his older brother and the cat and <br/>
a neighbor lady who came to visit.  He would come up to his brother <br/>
or me with pencil in one hand and his post-its in the other and <br/>
say &quot;How do you spell ....... ? We spent about three weeks <br/>
automatically spelling something for him.  It got to be such a habit <br/>
it was a couple days before I realized that he had stopped asking and <br/>
I was still spelling out the names of things LOL.<br/>

I just read about Einstein.  Did you know he didn&#39;t read until he was 7 and<br/>
didn&#39;t speak until he was 4?  I&#39;m the Mom of a healthy happy 7 year who is<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I am sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; they would recognize these signs earlier if they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; already accustomed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; feeling a certain way, then being on the toilet,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then feeling relief.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that is exactly it.  I always thought that the<br/>
&gt; reason people have such a hard time potty training is<br/>
&gt; because they start too late.  I put a toilet looking<br/>
&gt; potty chair in the bathroom by the time my children<br/>
&gt; were about 8 months old (except the last one who was<br/>
&gt; only 5 months when purchased - my girls were early<br/>
&gt; walkers but late talkers so 8 months was when they<br/>
&gt; could take me by the hand to bring them to the potty)<br/>
&gt; also brought them with me whenever I went - never<br/>
&gt; forced them to use it - but alway offered & all were<br/>
&gt; completely (no accidents and would use public rest<br/>
&gt; rooms if necessary) potty trained by 18 months.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Squatting the natural way (was NO diapers!- was:Foreskin)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Somewhat oversharing, down the way, but here goes:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; Ancient India had diapers, there are references to a river in their<br/>
mythos<br/>
&gt; where Krishna&#39;s diapers were washed.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had this Indian boyfriend who wasn&#39;t circumcised.  Surprisingly, he<br/>
&gt; reappears in this forum so soon!   He had two much brothers 12, 14 years<br/>
&gt; younger.  When they were little he and the mom and other kids had been in<br/>
&gt; India while the dad was in Toronto studying physics.    He said the babies<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t wear diapers, just little kurtas, the long white shirts.   In India<br/>
&gt; they have floor-hole toilets, and he said the mom taught the little guys<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; poop by squatting or sitting and making a little potty-seat with her feet,<br/>
&gt; like heels together, feet arched, toes together, outsides of feet toward<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; floor, and setting the baby on her feet and the baby would poop and then<br/>
&gt; she&#39;d flush it (if it was in the toilet) or just clean it up (if it had<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; on the ground, or on paper or whatever--that I wasn&#39;t clear on).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He was just noting that the little potty-chairs Americans use are not<br/>
&gt; efficient for helping babies poop because squatting is the way anyway,<br/>
knees<br/>
&gt; up, butt down.  He was pre-med and ended up going off elsewhere and<br/>
becoming<br/>
&gt; a doctor, and he was interested in some of the dumb things Americans<br/>
thought<br/>
&gt; were good and right, like chair-style toilets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still remember the first time I passed by and saw him squatted up on the<br/>
&gt; toilet seat, reading a magazine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And even now, sometimes if I&#39;m having a difficult time pooping I squat and<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; really does  help.<br/>

didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; strain ourselves to try to push poop out with muscles which weren&#39;t<br/>

&gt; I am convinced that &quot;experts&quot; have growth-retarded children. I&#39;ve read<br/>
this,<br/>
&gt; too. But I&#39;ve also read reports that women in other places just &quot;know&quot;<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; their babies have to go and hold them over an appropriate spot, so the<br/>
kids<br/>
&gt; never learn to go in their underwear in the first place. Then they don&#39;t<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to unlearn it later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do agree, though, that diapered kids don&#39;t seem to know when they&#39;re<br/>
going.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why I favor the &quot;nudie&quot; system of potty training.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  are not fully developed until around 18 months of age, supposedly<br/>
making it<br/>

&gt; When I lived in El Salvador kids just ran around in regular clothes<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; the available cloth diapers were flimsy pretty much useless for a kid over<br/>
&gt; 3 or 4 months (and disposables were just way too hot). Kids did wet and<br/>
&gt; poop themselves regularly, but mothers would just take it in stride and<br/>
&gt; change the kid completely and clean up everything around them. After on<br/>
&gt; month there with my then 2 year old son and 5 month old daughter, I wrote<br/>
&gt; to my mom and asked her to send me a big box of American style prefolded<br/>
&gt; diapers and velcro-closing diaper wraps!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.circumcision.org/spectator.htm">http://www.circumcision.org/spectator.htm</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking for quotes for a workshop (whole different topic) I went to Google<br/>
&gt; and entered &quot;inquiry questions children jewish.&quot;  The second item to<br/>
appear<br/>
&gt; was an article on Jewish Circumcision considerations.  it&#39;s too long to<br/>
quote<br/>
&gt; here, and has a ton of hotlink footnotes, but here&#39;s the beginning and the<br/>
&gt; URL is above.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The religious origin of the Jewish practice of circumcision is written in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Torah where God promised Abraham,<br/>
&gt; I will make you exceedingly fertile, and make nations of you, and kings<br/>
shall<br/>
&gt; come forth from you. . . . I assign the land you sojourn in to you and<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; offspring to come, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting holding. I<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; be their God. . . . Such shall be the covenant between Me and you and your<br/>
&gt; offspring to follow which you shall keep: every male among you shall be<br/>
&gt; circumcised. (Genesis 17:6,8,10)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Over the centuries there has been much written by Jewish scholars about<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; importance of circumcision. Support for circumcision in the Jewish<br/>
community<br/>
&gt; today is widespread. There is another perspective on circumcision that is<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; openly discussed. Contrary to common belief, circumcision has not always<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; practiced. Moses failed to circumcise his son (Exodus 4:25), and<br/>
circumcision<br/>
&gt; was totally neglected during the forty-year period in the wilderness<br/>
(Joshua<br/>
&gt; 5:5). Some Jews in the Hellenistic period (circa 300 b.c.e.-100 c.e.)<br/>
chose<br/>
&gt; not to circumcise their sons in an attempt to gain public acceptance.1<br/>
During<br/>
&gt; the Reform movement in Germany in the 1840s, some parents did not<br/>
circumcise<br/>
&gt; their sons. Theodor Herzl was one of the most prominent figures who did<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; circumcise his son, who was born in 1891.2<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Currently, circumcision is not universal among Jews either inside or<br/>
outside<br/>
&gt; the United States. The Circumcision Resource Center, a nonprofit<br/>
educational<br/>
&gt; organization, knows of hundreds of Jews in Europe, South America, and in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; United States who either have not or would not circumcise a son. Even in<br/>
&gt; Israel some Jews do not circumcise, and there is an organization that<br/>
&gt; publicly opposes circumcision.3 The purpose of this article is to<br/>
coherently<br/>
&gt; explain a few of the contemporary reasons for the increasing doubts some<br/>
Jews<br/>
&gt; have about circumcision. Then I will apply Torah law and Jewish values to<br/>
&gt; these reasons.<br/>

&gt; OK, now I&#39;ve got to try this with my daughter, she&#39;s 9 months old.<br/>
&gt; I thought I was doing so much good for using cloth diapers... figured my<br/>
son<br/>
&gt; would potty train early because suppsedly cloth diapered babies do... but<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; son refuses to use a toilet for bms and still is completely surprised when<br/>
&gt; he wets himself.<br/>
&gt; Oh well, maybe they&#39;ll &quot;train&quot; together :)  That would be great!<br/>

&gt; My first child was totally oblivious to her body functions until she was<br/>
&gt; past 3 1/2.  She didn&#39;t know she had to go until she went.  She is also<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; type of kid to get so involved in something that she blocks out everything<br/>
&gt; else.  She wore cloth diapers but it didn&#39;t matter to her that she was<br/>
wet.<br/>
&gt; She finally potty trained at 3 years 7 months, when she was ready.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son just trained last week, and he&#39;s just a few weeks shy of his 3rd<br/>
&gt; birthday.  He has known for many months what to do, has been very aware of<br/>
&gt; his body functions for a while, had been able to hold it, has woken up dry<br/>
&gt; many mornings.  He just wasn&#39;t ready to do it himself until last week.  He<br/>
&gt; has had other health issues so I didn&#39;t push it.  He wore disposables for<br/>
&gt; the past year (since he got sick).<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah that is what we are told.  I sure believed it :-)  But what actually<br/>
happens is a baby is aware of his/her eliminiation- just like they are aware<br/>
of nursing and how that feels.  It is actually sort of odd that we would<br/>
think our babies are numb from the waist down or something.  They are<br/>
actually keyed in to communicating about their elimination needs- just like<br/>
nursing- but because we arent looking for it- we don&#39;t see it.  They learn<br/>
to hold it and signal that they want to be taken to the bathroom.  Gordon<br/>
will NOT pee on me, I will be like, &quot;what&#39;s wrong, why are you fussy?&quot;-<br/>
finally &quot;DUH!&quot; and I take him to pee.  When I am really in tune- I can<br/>
&quot;tell&quot; he needs to pee- just like those &quot;magical tribal mothers&quot;.  Many<br/>
cultures still do this- and it is really cool.<br/>

&gt; How do you go about this?  I mean, you have your new baby...do you ever<br/>
put<br/>
&gt; a diaper on him?  Can you give us a brief how-to on it? Thanks ~Rue<br/>

&gt; &gt; According to pediatricians the nerve endings and connections to the<br/>
brain<br/>
&gt; &gt;  are not fully developed until around 18 months of age, supposedly<br/>
making<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt;  so babies cannot tell if they are going or not... that and the<br/>
sphinkter<br/>
&gt; &gt;  (sp?) muscles are not fully developed until that time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  some later, some earlier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah that is what we are told.  I sure believed it :-)  But what actually<br/>
&gt; happens is a baby is aware of his/her eliminiation- just like they are<br/>
aware<br/>
&gt; of nursing and how that feels.  It is actually sort of odd that we would<br/>
&gt; think our babies are numb from the waist down or something.  They are<br/>
&gt; actually keyed in to communicating about their elimination needs- just<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; nursing- but because we arent looking for it- we don&#39;t see it.  They learn<br/>
&gt; to hold it and signal that they want to be taken to the bathroom.  Gordon<br/>
&gt; will NOT pee on me, I will be like, &quot;what&#39;s wrong, why are you fussy?&quot;-<br/>
&gt; finally &quot;DUH!&quot; and I take him to pee.  When I am really in tune- I can<br/>
&gt; &quot;tell&quot; he needs to pee- just like those &quot;magical tribal mothers&quot;.  Many<br/>
&gt; cultures still do this- and it is really cool.<br/>

&gt; my 5 year old starting reading books about 2 years ago.<br/>
&gt; I read some things from Glen Domain.  He has an institute (the gentle<br/>
&gt; revolution I think its called) in PA (that I would love to get a chance to<br/>
&gt; visit someday)and a book I read &#39;teaching your baby to read&#39;.  It involved<br/>
&gt; making flash cards with large print but she enjoyed it has a fun game.<br/>
Some<br/>
&gt; think that the focus on whole words would make learning phonics hard but<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; picked that up because she was always able to relate sound to words she<br/>
&gt; already knew.<br/>
&gt;   I looked at some ABEKA reading material and some scholastic readers for<br/>
&gt; phonics instruction but by she pretty much just picked it up by herself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That same 5 year old is delayed 1-2 years in early/basic math skills.  She<br/>
&gt; read Charlottes web a few months ago but if I ask her today  what 2+3 is<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; may answer any # from 2-10.  I just have to remember not to worry about it<br/>
&gt; because that stresses both of us out.  The author Glen Domain also  has a<br/>
&gt; book how to teach your baby math but I never bought that one :(<br/>

&gt; My youngest daughter struggles with reading as well. So far I help her<br/>
&gt; whenever she asks and read to her. But I have to say I feel a slight panic<br/>
&gt; coming on :) She is 8yo, and I know she will will read, my parents think I<br/>
&gt; am ruining my children (I always was the black sheep) &lt;g&gt; and they seem to<br/>
&gt; always come up with a snide remark aimed at living style or teaching (or<br/>
&gt; lack thereof)style. So far my children have been quick to respond without<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; stepping in. Very frustrating at times, but, she does know sign language<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; some spanish so I guess I&#39;ll just stay out of her way a while longer :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;My first child was totally oblivious to her body functions until she was<br/>
&gt; past 3 1/2.  She didn&#39;t know she had to go until she went.  She is also<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; type of kid to get so involved in something that she blocks out everything<br/>
&gt; else.  She wore cloth diapers but it didn&#39;t matter to her that she was<br/>
wet.<br/>
&gt; She finally potty trained at 3 years 7 months, when she was ready.&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is my daughter as well. She is 3 1/2 and has just potty trained in<br/>
the last month.  She has an older brother that was trained by 2 and a<br/>
younger brother that will go in the potty or not, he is still 20 months and<br/>
not really bothered if mom has to blot up after him...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I used cloth, let her go naked, let her pick out panties, you name it.<br/>
She just was NOT ready and could care less if she peed on herself, her<br/>
clothes, the floor...She was the same way with talking-she did not say a<br/>
word until she was almost 3.  Then she had so much to say that it was almost<br/>
scary all the chatter coming from my mute child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She used the potty 3 weeks ago and has had one accident since.  It all<br/>
depends on the child and the way they learn.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I do agree, though, that diapered kids don&#39;t seem to know when they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; going.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I favor the &quot;nudie&quot; system of potty training.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We were going to do this this summer but.... we&#39;re moving and there is<br/>
&gt; stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; everwhere and the first time I attempted Julian peed on stuff for my<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; So then I thought I&#39;d wait until we got in a better situation where<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son has been receiving Highlites magazine (gift sub from my mom) but<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; decided that he&#39;d rather get something like Puzzlemania - has anyone ever<br/>
&gt; heard of this as a subscription, and if so, do you have any links or a ph#<br/>
&gt; where I can get more info?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or do you have any other magazine suggestions for a 7yo boy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Just wondering how it has transpired for those<br/>
&gt; &gt; of you who have young<br/>
&gt; &gt; readers or want to be readers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not only does every child learn at a different age,<br/>
&gt; but I think they learn best with different methods -<br/>
&gt; so you could offer many of them.  The words on all the<br/>
&gt; objects in your house is a good idea.  A word wall is<br/>
&gt; another - a wall with pictures of objects with the<br/>
&gt; name of the object on the card.  Some children learn<br/>
&gt; by writing to read. Since she can print you could help<br/>
&gt; her to write her own stories by spelling them for her.<br/>
&gt;  Some children are more sight readers and would be<br/>
&gt; helped by having the same few books read over and<br/>
&gt; over. She&#39;ll soon &#39;read&#39; it from memory.  Some kids<br/>
&gt; like to play a game with flash cards where you show<br/>
&gt; them a letter and if they can think of a word that<br/>
&gt; starts with that sound they win the card.  You can<br/>
&gt; play a game of saying words like &#39;lighthouse&#39; and see<br/>
&gt; if she can break it into light and house (this helps<br/>
&gt; with auditory segmentation.) You can play a sound game<br/>
&gt; by saying &quot;/c/ /a/ /t/ - what word is that?&quot; to help<br/>
&gt; with auditory blending (both necessary skills for<br/>
&gt; reading development. You&#39;re already doing the most<br/>
&gt; important thing - reading to her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787319924">We did the names of things written on note cards and taped to the object when my now 9 yo wanted to learn to read. She already knew how to recognize some words but wasn&#39;t fluent yet. So we just kept doing what we&#39;d been doing--reading lots of books (we still do it). One day she told me that she&#39;d decided that it was time for her to read chapter books. I suggested we go to the library but she wanted to own<br/>
her first chapter book so off to the bookstore we went. She&#39;s decided to read all the books by Patricia McLaughlan (Sarah Plain and Tall, etc).<br/>
 When my now 13 yo was about 8 she told me that she wanted to read the bedtime story one night. She chose Little Men and began to read to us all.  It was a mater of waiting for the right time. <br/>
 We don&#39;t want babies to be born before they&#39;re ready, why does out society insist they do other things before they&#39;re ready, and why do we buy into that fallacy?<br/>

&gt; me not to fret?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t fret.  When Jenni was 9 or 10 she was pretty much the same.  Now we<br/>
joke about her need for a 12 step program because she will tear through a<br/>
7 book grown-up detective series in a week.  She also read every book<br/>
Mercedes Lackey wrote at a pace of about a book a day.  It comes when<br/>
they find WHAT they want to read.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
In a later message from Carolyn:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m just wondering if I should stop getting her books, in hopes that<br/>
&gt;she&#39;ll start looking for herself.  I can&#39;t even imagine not wanting to<br/>
&gt;pick books out for myself.  On the other hand, I hate messing up a<br/>
&gt;mostly good thing.    Now that I&#39;ve written this, I&#39;m wondering how<br/>
&gt;other kids hear about good books and how they make their choices.  I<br/>
&gt;really doubt any of her friends are telling her about good books they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jenni first got into M. Lackey because a really cool librarian<br/>
recommended &#39;Firebird&#39;. At the time we all thought it was WAY above her<br/>
reading level because she had been coosing easy stuff with lots of<br/>
pictures.  Turns out she just hadn&#39;t thought to look at anything else. <br/>
Rachel (my oldest) explored  my books and my mothers.  She is heavily<br/>
into Agatha Christie and she likes Robert Asprin.  If you picking out<br/>
books is okay with her, go with it.  Eventually she will start picking<br/>
her own.<br/>
<br/>
And from Gunnerfenner:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  The problem with this is , what ? That ELEMENTARY  age children <br/>
&gt;have to have parental permission .<br/>
&gt;I wonder if that same young child can check out The Antarchist <br/>
&gt;Cookbook from that same elementary school library ? But wait ..... it <br/>
&gt;would be a crime according to you all if they couldn&#39;t , right ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;God help us all !<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m I the only one on this list that feels this way ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally am of the opinion that if you let your child go to school,<br/>
any book in the school library should be okay.  If you have a problem<br/>
with Harry Potter or Judy Blume, well then maybe you should be<br/>
homeschooling because your kids certainly don&#39;t belong in public school. <br/>
Of course, I also was very careful to get my kids library cards that gave<br/>
them access to the whole library.  No restrictions at all.  It is not the<br/>
public librarian&#39;s job to decide what is right for my kids.  BTW I think<br/>
my husband owns the Anarchist Cookbook.  They can read it if they want,<br/>
but I get to join in any experimenting too.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;as frequently as &quot;are we there yet&quot; and you can send us a little of your<br/>
&gt;&quot;not going there.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank God and Goddess and Gaia that my oldest can drive now!!!  I can<br/>
stay home and get something done once in a while now.  Daily trips to the<br/>
library were getting to be a bit much!<br/>

Well I wouldn&#39;t read more than I feel comfortable with. It seems that wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be very fun for you and her anyhow.  I personally have a hard time reading<br/>
books that &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t find intersting or entertaining.  Maybe you could pick up<br/>
some tapes that she could listen to in between the reading time.  <br/>

reading, take an hour and read some of her favorite books while recording<br/>
onto a tape. I did this for my daughter, recorded into her little toy<br/>
recorder and it worked great! That way it&#39;s still &quot;you&quot; reading :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842265369">Hi Julie, my son was like this at 5 and 6, just before he started reading on his own.  It drove me kind of nuts.  One thing I did was to get some books on tape (it worked for him because he&#39;s very verbal/audio oriented, I can&#39;t listen to the things, though), and to sometimes turn the table and ask him to &quot;read&quot; to me while I did housework or some sort of errand.  I also tried to get him to make up stories of his own, and I would write them down for him and make little books that he would then &quot;read&quot; to himself.  I&#39;m a single mom, so I know how overwhelming it can get when my son goes through really attention-needy kind of phases.  I think the right balance would be reading as much as you are willing to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549849659">Nancy Wallace (author of Better Than School, which I recommend) talks in her<br/>
book about the fact that she and her husband decided to only read to their<br/>

some books I simply won&#39;t read aloud - I just can&#39;t take it, and other books<br/>
I read aloud because I really want to read them and I know the kids will<br/>
enjoy it somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
My point is - if I were in your situation - being asked to read aloud so<br/>
much - I would agree to read a set amount of her choice, and then more of my<br/>
choice if she wants more. It doesn&#39;t have to be something completely boring<br/>
to her, but it can be something you really feel like reading. Then it will<br/>
probably be less irritating, you think?<br/>

sentence, and then my mind wanders and I start saying things that don&#39;t<br/>
make sense... I try, I do, and when she was younger I did read some stuff<br/>
that bored me to tears... but there&#39;s so much good stuff out there that<br/>
she likes to listen to and I like to read. <br/>
<br/>
I do feel a twinge of guilt over never reading her the rest of the<br/>
Dealing with Dragons series, but I just couldn&#39;t read them aloud anymore,<br/>
even though I like the books and did end up reading them all to myself...<br/>
OTOH, reading HP aloud was just plain fun, and I&#39;m reading the original<br/>
Sherlock Holmes stories aloud now and those are great, too.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s easier now because she can read pretty much anything to<br/>
herself... when she couldn&#39;t, I read more stuff that I considered drivel.<br/>
<br/>
And Amy, have you been here all along? I didn&#39;t realize that...cool.<br/>

read.  He told her that he had just discovered for himself that he <br/>

a revelation to both of them.  (I wouldn&#39;t suggest doing this *in order* to <br/>

kids learn to read.  They hear the same book so many times that they end up <br/>
memorizing it.  Then they can sit with it and say the words they hear in <br/>
their head while looking at the same words on the page.  That&#39;s one thing I <br/>
regret about moving on to chapter books as early as I did with Lars.  He <br/>
didn&#39;t get that repeated reading of the same book.  Then again, he might <br/>
not have even wanted to hear any of them over and over.  That probably <br/>
wasn&#39;t his way of learning to read.  If it was, it probably would have <br/>
become an issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303753873">When Hannah was frustrated about her reading, we played charades: I wrote action phrases on slips of papers (baking a cake, picking flowers, pet the dog, --stuff like that). Everyone in the family took turns picking a paper and acting it out.  I also wrote silly sentences (The fat man sat on a chair and ate bowls of noodles. The brave princess stormed through the woods to get to the elegant castle. Sarah Elena, the fairy princess, and her friend, Shimmery Shiny spent the day at the field of giant daylillies) She illustrated them.  the Sarah Elena story has become an ongoing adventure story--this fairy has plenty of  cool adventures. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101606328">Wow, some great information so far and I agree completely!!!... keep them<br/>
coming!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I do see her reading however, sometimes she will say... &quot;now you read it to<br/>
me&quot; which tells me she isn&#39;t comprehending what she is reading even though<br/>
she can sound out the phonics of the words.  I, too as a child could read<br/>
but by 4th grade had to do a remedial reading &quot;special&quot; class because I<br/>
lacked being able to comprehend!<br/>
<br/>
I would like to hear how old each of your children were when it the reading<br/>
click for them...I think that would help with reassurance for myself : D<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My ds is 8. Like a good mom, I taught him how to sound out words when he was <br/>
5, assuming that he would then read. NO Way!! He simply got intimidated and <br/>
confused. Then I started makin g him read aloud to me from little books and <br/>
&quot;readers&quot;. YUK He started to refuse toread anything at all. It freaked him out <br/>
completely that he wasn&#39;t perfect and stumbled. It has taken till now for him to <br/>
feel like he can read at all, and that is because I left him alone and stopped <br/>
even talking about reading. I sure blew it . Mind you he wasn&#39;t asking  me to <br/>
teach him. <br/>
Now, if he doesn&#39;t think about it, he can read almost anything . That is just <br/>
by reading huge amounts to him, answering him when he asked what things said, <br/>
and leaving  hiim alone. His comprehension is great, he uses expression and <br/>
rarely has trouble with a word, he just doesn&#39;t like to read if he doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to. I wish I could undo the damage I did. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our first three went to school - the last one in K when he &quot;rose&quot; out.<br/>
<br/>
But #4 has never been and we did no teaching.  He loves computer games.  So he could read &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel at age 5 or 6.  Because he had to to operate a game.<br/>
<br/>
As games got more difficult, he&#39;d ask older bro to read for him.  That was fine for a while, then bro started sleeping in more, so he was forced to attempt reading on his own to play the game.  His love of computer games DROVE the reading.  He was reading to Grama (little tests she gave him) at a high level at 6 1/2.  But if it wasn&#39;t for the computer, he wouldn&#39;t have chosen reading.<br/>
<br/>
I tell people this story a lot when they hear we home/unschool - I think they think I&#39;m lying.  :O)))<br/>
<br/>
Moral:  leave it - no one (exceptions for brain damage etc.) cannot read after age 17.  No one.  Just leave it.  Just live it.<br/>

Tara was reading at 6 but she was a school child since she was 4. I had<br/>
bought a program that cost me way more than I had because I was convinced I<br/>
had to *help* her so she wouldn&#39;t be left behind. We did that program almost<br/>
every day and she did read. She managed to keep up at school. She&#39;s almost<br/>
18 now and she hates to read. Won&#39;t read anything she doesn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to.<br/>
It&#39;s sad really.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph and Sierra learned to read at about 6 and 7. They are 13 months apart<br/>
but do almost everything together. They started out with just playing games<br/>
about words. Like when we were in the pool and we would do A my name is<br/>
Alice and I come from Alabama......... They loved that game and although<br/>
when they first started I needed to help them a lot, they got the hand of<br/>
some letters and the sounds by just having fun. Then they got into work<br/>
books. This was all going on when they were about 5 and 6. The loved doing<br/>
them and they also loved the idea of doing sight words. Joseph is very<br/>
competitive and loved to see how far he could get each time without<br/>
struggling. Sierra just did them because Joseph was. Same with the workbooks<br/>
although Sierra did more of the pages then Joseph. I would print them out<br/>
from the computer and leave them each in their own book to do whenever they<br/>
wanted. One time I noticed they weren&#39;t doing them anymore and that was<br/>
that. It was months after that and there were no work sheets or sight words<br/>
wanting to be done. It was about 5 months later that Joseph was just<br/>
reading. I first noticed it with his Pokemon cards, street signs and small<br/>
things around the house. It wasn&#39;t but a few weeks that he was really<br/>
reading well. Sierra was not quite as fast at reading but still doing it<br/>
too. Now they are 7 and 8 and both enjoy reading. They both take books to<br/>
bed with them and both read to their little sister and even to Joe and I. It<br/>
just happened and I have so many friends who homeschool and keep asking me<br/>
how I taught them to read. When I say I didn&#39;t, they look at me like I have<br/>
some great secret I&#39;m hiding!<br/>
<br/>
But I must also say my kids never had a problem with *not* reading. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t a big deal that there were things others might be doing that they<br/>
weren&#39;t. Our attitude around here is very much non educational and easy as<br/>
far as who should be doing things and when. So they never saw reading as<br/>
anything they wouldn&#39;t learn. They just kind of knew it would happen<br/>
eventually and I guess they just waited for that time. They also have no<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995503206">Sarah probably could have been reading ALOT sooner than she did, but I didn&#39;t work with her or anything because I didn&#39;t want her to go into school already reading when the other kids wouldn&#39;t be... so she was 6, just into the beginning of &quot;first grade&quot; when it clicked for her...but at that time we were regularly going through Phonics Pathways and the Bob Books and I was actively &quot;teaching&quot; her to read. But she had little interest in it, and it was a hard time for both of us, with alot of yelling and hurt feelings as I didn&#39;t feel she was really trying and would be upset with her.  So in some ways while she had the technical knowledge of reading, it&#39;s only been in the past couple months, at 7 1/2 that she&#39;s really wanting to read on her own and enjoying it, asking for books to read from the library, etc. So you could consider her truly reading at 7 1/2 although she&#39;s had the technical knowledge and ability to &#39;read&#39; since she was 6 1/2. <br/>
