<div id="ygrps-yiv-28292657">How old is your dd?  Perhaps she needs heavier thicker cord - not synthetic but natural material is easier to manipulate.  Cross stitch floss is difficult to macrame for beginners because if its size and texture.  Also - when I first learned I used cardboard with pins to hold the cord in place until i mastered a knot.  Check out the local crafts shop for heavier cord and simpler picture books.<br/>
<br/>
I would also write to the company and complain, especially if the beads are too small for the size of the cord and if the directions are lousy.  I used to write directions professionally and am so often appalled by what i see, especially in craft kits for kids.  Who writes this stuff?  Not me &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Macrame<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Is anyone here familiar with macrame?  My daughter got a &quot;kit&quot; for Christmas made by Curiosity Kits.  She also got a &quot;fairy making&quot; kit that I really liked, but this Macrame kit is killing me.<br/>
<br/>
  She really wants to learn how to do it, but the cord that came with the kit isn&#39;t working very well.  The beads that came with it don&#39;t fit over the cords and she&#39;s frustrated, but really wants to make friendship bracelets.  <br/>
<br/>
  When I was a kid, I made friendship bracelets out of cross-stitch floss...but I think she&#39;s looking for that macrame look.  <br/>
<br/>
  Is there a specific type of material that&#39;s good for this?  I was thinking maybe hemp  thread, but not sure if that would be good for a beginner.  <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>
  Holly<br/>
