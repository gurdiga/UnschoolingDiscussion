It seems to me that Ned was trying to be supportive of an unschooler&#39;s <br/>
frustrating personal experience. Like it or not, the fact remains that many <br/>
unschoolers are affected by indirect association with public schools. Some <br/>
have been extremely wounded by having had their children in those schools and <br/>
need to vent and go through the process of working it out of their systems. <br/>
Others are affected by friends, neighbors, and relatives who are sold on the <br/>
school system. Many of these people (myself included) feel empowered by <br/>
&quot;rantings&quot; such as Ned&#39;s, after having been beaten down by the system and <br/>
baffled as to how to deal with its pervasiveness. I would think that a <br/>
feeling of empowerment will give these people the courage to go with the idea <br/>
of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think that a few of the long time regular posters are resentful that <br/>
someone new to the list has so much to say of interest, and is stealing their <br/>
thunder. As long as people are not profane or extremely vulgar, I wish you&#39;d <br/>
get off their backs and stop trying to CONTROL everything they say. I keep <br/>
hearing unschoolers talk about trusting your children to run with their <br/>
ideas, and then you turn around and try to squash every idea posted that you <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886706324">It bothers me too that this list is for un&#39;schoolers&#39; but people can&#39;t seem<br/>
to say anything negative about &#39;school&#39; or maybe not feel comfortable saying<br/>
anything knowing that Ned keeps being asked to be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that some of us, including myself, aren&#39;t in the same place as<br/>
Ned or others that really dislike &#39;schools&#39; at this point.  This is a<br/>
unschooling list though and the fact that some people dislike schools is a<br/>
part of the unschooling imo.<br/>
<br/>
I love this list except for the part that people can&#39;t seem to speak freely<br/>
about &#39;school&#39;s having negative aspects to them.   If someone doesn&#39;t agree<br/>
with Ned or others it seems ok to say so but to to keep telling him to be<br/>
quiet, even if his posts annoy some, just doesn&#39;t seem *fair* to me either.<br/>

more that long time posters are intimately familiar with the workings and <br/>
purpose of this list *as stated by the list owner*. Long time posters are <br/>
also aware of what will take a discussion, and possibly the list itelf, so <br/>
far off track as to be unrecognizable.<br/>

<br/>
Do you really not see the difference between political grandstanding and <br/>
meaningful unschooling discussion?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I keep hearing unschoolers talk about trusting your children to run with <br/>

&gt;&gt;that you disagree with. I don&#39;t see you practicing what you preach.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t see people disagreeing with the ideas, only the attempt to change <br/>
this particular forum into a campaign for those ideas. (Well, maybe there <br/>
was disagreement with the all or nothing statements.) This is an <br/>
international list meant to share unschooling philosopy and ideas. IMHO <br/>
school bashing and political rabble rousing are better suited to lists aimed <br/>
at those purposes.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW I have had  a child who had a horrendous ps experience. If someone <br/>
posts an actual question or comment about their ps experiences, I will be <br/>
the first to chime in with empathy and support in their anger. I won&#39;t, <br/>
however, encourage that person to hold on to their anger. I will gently <br/>
suggest that it&#39;s okay to move on to the joy. That&#39;s what unschoooling has <br/>
done for me and my family. Allowed us to experience the joy of learning.<br/>

the schools are indeed rotten nasty places and they were right for <br/>
getting their kids out, along with suggestions for what to do next, <br/>
there are other lists which do a much, much better job of providing <br/>
that level of support and encouragement and empowerment than this one <br/>
could ever hope to, and all are deeply sympathetic to unschooling <br/>
sensitivities. I suggest checking out a few of them:<br/>
<br/>
HEM-Networking<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-Networking<br/>
<br/>
NHEN-Speakout<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHEN-Speakout<br/>
<br/>
AHA-Discussion<br/>
http://www,groups.yahoo.com/group/AHA-Discussion<br/>
<br/>
There is also much more support for unschooling, including discussion <br/>
boards to specifically address the frustrating personal experiences <br/>
of those who have, as you say, &quot;been extremely wounded by having had <br/>
their children in school and need to vent,&quot; at the web site from <br/>
which this list was born:<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think that a few of the long time regular posters are resentful that<br/>
&gt;someone new to the list has so much to say of interest, and is stealing their<br/>
&gt;thunder.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This list is far too mature for attitudes like that, Sherry. All <br/>
we&#39;re saying is that, while what Ned was posting might be of interest <br/>
to those who haven&#39;t heard it all before, there are many much better <br/>
places for him to elucidate (and he&#39;s doing so on some of those other <br/>
lists), but we&#39;d like to keep this list focused on primarily <br/>
discussing unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As long as people are not profane or extremely vulgar, I wish you&#39;d<br/>
&gt;get off their backs and stop trying to CONTROL everything they say.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is an unfair analysis of the situation. Please try to <br/>
understand what really happened on this list.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I don&#39;t think you really understand what the problem was or <br/>
why we kept insisting that Ned not disrupt this list with his <br/>
politically charged essays. Ned himself very graciously deferred a <br/>
week or so ago - if you weren&#39;t on the list to read his reply to me I <br/>
can send you a copy of it.<br/>

coming from.  I&#39;m not sure I totally agree but that&#39;s not me to say and the<br/>

i just dont understand when the complaint is wasting of others time... so<br/>
much time is continued to be wasted on this argument..<br/>
on the lists that i own, if i feel strongly enuf that a post should not be<br/>
there, i go and delete it.. i do not discuss it on the list because that<br/>
would be a further waste of my time and energy and that of others.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the basis of this ongoing discussion lies in the desire<br/>
to avoid conflict.... even as it creates MORE conflict.. if it is a matter<br/>
of ... &quot;we must be democratic about it,&quot; WHY?  If those who run the list<br/>
find something offensive.. why dont they take it off.. or ... use the method<br/>
i find MOST effective.. IGNORE IT...<br/>
hell, some of my posts have been ignored.. and they are not even<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I think that a few of the long time regular posters are resentful that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;someone new to the list has so much to say of interest, and is stealing<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;their thunder.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think this comment is a bit off track (to put it politely). I think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; more that long time posters are intimately familiar with the workings and<br/>
&gt; purpose of this list *as stated by the list owner*. Long time posters are<br/>
&gt; also aware of what will take a discussion, and possibly the list itelf, so<br/>
&gt; far off track as to be unrecognizable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;As long as people are not profane or extremely vulgar, I wish you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; get off their backs and stop trying to CONTROL everything they say.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you really not see the difference between political grandstanding and<br/>
&gt; meaningful unschooling discussion?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I keep hearing unschoolers talk about trusting your children to run with<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;their ideas, and then you turn around and try to squash every idea<br/>
posted<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;that you disagree with. I don&#39;t see you practicing what you preach.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t see people disagreeing with the ideas, only the attempt to change<br/>
&gt; this particular forum into a campaign for those ideas. (Well, maybe there<br/>
&gt; was disagreement with the all or nothing statements.) This is an<br/>
&gt; international list meant to share unschooling philosopy and ideas. IMHO<br/>
&gt; school bashing and political rabble rousing are better suited to lists<br/>
aimed<br/>
&gt; at those purposes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FWIW I have had  a child who had a horrendous ps experience. If someone<br/>
&gt; posts an actual question or comment about their ps experiences, I will be<br/>
&gt; the first to chime in with empathy and support in their anger. I won&#39;t,<br/>
&gt; however, encourage that person to hold on to their anger. I will gently<br/>
&gt; suggest that it&#39;s okay to move on to the joy. That&#39;s what unschoooling has<br/>
&gt; done for me and my family. Allowed us to experience the joy of learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
Little lists seem always easier to manage than big ones.  And non-emotional <br/>
topics are easier to steer or ride than those that involve whole children&#39;s <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
if this were the only list in the world, stakes would be higher.  It&#39;s not <br/>
the only list in the world.  But it&#39;s the only list associated with <br/>
www.unschooling.com, and that&#39;s the only HEM unschooling site in the world.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kinda invested in it and I really care about its usefulness and integrity.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a moderator or list owner, but I&#39;m a regular and send people to that <br/>
forum daily or more (who knows how often, with business cards, and website <br/>
links and articles and public announcements).    I&#39;m on a state list too, but <br/>
it&#39;s rarely useful to bring any state news or reports here.  That&#39;s where the <br/>
practical day to day field trip and political news is.  People can use both, <br/>
but they don&#39;t need them both in the same place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478724571">I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t been around today to discuss my post but others seem to<br/>
have explained things well -- better than I could have.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been having a real tough time articulating what the problem is with<br/>
Ned&#39;s posting and my wording has left the impression that there are subjects<br/>
that are off topic and discussions that are taboo. Too many people have felt<br/>
the need to apologize for being off topic. No one should need to apologize.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is life and the discussion can and will often range far and<br/>
wide. It will occasionally include religion, parenting (more than just<br/>
occasionally!), politics, even local politics in the -- as Sheila  put it --<br/>
ebb and flow of conversation. (I&#39;ve actually found it helpful over the years<br/>
to be passingly familiar with the laws in other states to at least be able<br/>
to say &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound quite right,&quot; to a worried homeschooler and send<br/>
them onto better information.)<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t serve the needs of the list members who signed on for the<br/>
specific purpose of this list if one person *repeatedly* diverts the ebb and<br/>
flow towards their own personal soapbox topic rather than responding to and<br/>
respecting the needs of the list members.<br/>
<br/>
Though the primary purpose of the list is discussing unschooling, the list<br/>
is sort of a little bit of everything else too since unschooling touches on<br/>
everything. But if one person keeps *repeatedly* steering the wide ranging<br/>
conversations back to one of those little bits, then the list starts to not<br/>
be about unschooling and starts being about that expanding bit.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that made anything clearer or muddier or just made some<br/>
people more irritated.<br/>
