I think that really depends on how your parents feel about it too. How old <br/>
are you anyway?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108770711">What are the laws about homeschooling in Kansas?  I bet you aren&#39;t <br/>
required to take two jr. high classes.  What it sounds like you need <br/>
is your mom to insist to the school officials that she is following <br/>
the homeschool law and that it&#39;s perfectly legal.  Unfortunately, <br/>
your mom needs to fight this battle because school officials will <br/>
just see your arguments as the argument of a &quot;delinquent&quot;. <br/>
