&gt; &gt;No, I think offering up the other options is actually good. But sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt;the &#39;tone&#39; of a post is hard to tell and it can seem to sound like - go<br/>
&gt; &gt;find another list.. it&#39;s a tricky line online because you can not see the<br/>
&gt; &gt;other person and if you don&#39;t know them or their posting style some may<br/>
&gt; &gt;get offended.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe information about other lists should always be prefaced with, &quot;You&#39;re<br/>
&gt; always welcome here on this list, but there are other lists where you might<br/>
&gt; get more support for your particular style of homeschooling.&quot;  Would<br/>
&gt; something like that be acceptable?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think so.  I agree that tone and what context it is stated in makes<br/>
a big difference.  Sharing resources is a great idea.  I found a lot<br/>
of lists that way - my first was Home-Ed and one day people started<br/>
talking about the other lists they were on.  I tried some and from<br/>
there learned about others.  And now I&#39;m on way too many lists!!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
