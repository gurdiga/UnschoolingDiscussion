<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002085283">My daughter is doing a paper for her anthropology class on homeschooling,<br/>
and she would like to speak with homeschooled children and their parents.<br/>
She wants to speak with a wide range of people, unschool, home at school,<br/>
Jewish, non-Jewish etc. etc. so I would appreciate it if you forwarded this<br/>
other groups you are on.   She wishes to speak to only those who are in the<br/>
Highland park area.  (Where she can get to!) Please write, and have them<br/>
write to me at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hindar@...">hindar@...</a>, with the words HOMESCHOOL/HIGHLAND PARK in the subject<br/>
area....<br/>
giving me some contact information (email, phone number etc.) that I can<br/>
pass on to my daughter, as she will be contacting people directly....<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much!!<br/>
