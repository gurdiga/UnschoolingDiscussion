<div id="ygrps-yiv-256701528">&lt;snip&gt;Sandra, I have to disagree here.  The point, for me, about HE is<br/>
choice.<br/>
The choice whether to go to college, or train as an apprentice, or do<br/>
nothing, or get pregnant at sixteen (I hope not, but it&#39;s a choice!)  Some<br/>
people&#39;s God-given gifts will not serve them in coolege.  Mine would have,<br/>
but I chose not to go.<br/>
<br/>
The world would be a better place without the pursuit of money, but that&#39;s<br/>
how it is.  The world would be a better place without forcing people into<br/>
boxes that don&#39;t fit them.  The world would be a better place if people knew<br/>
what they were, and stopped trying to be what they aren&#39;t.  That&#39;s my<br/>
soapbox time over, I&#39;ll hand over to someone else!&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree with you, Tracy.  My point is that there should be that<br/>
opportunity for all who desire it, not just those who can afford it.  I went<br/>
to college for two years and couldn&#39;t learn what I wanted to learn there.  I<br/>
spent several years midwifing, several years unschooling young children, and<br/>
in the middle of all that I am a volunteer administrator for an organization<br/>
that I srongly believe in and a permaculture activist working together to<br/>
build a sustainable community in my area.  It is very hard for people to<br/>
live by their true values and principles in our society where we are judged<br/>
by money and acheivement.  My point about Higher Ed was that if there isn&#39;t<br/>
free choice and the option, it is exclusive and elitist.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people had dreams of what they wanted to do, just ask your parents<br/>
and your grandparents.  My father wanted to be an architect, but became a<br/>
pharmacist beacuse the corner drug store where he worked through high school<br/>
paid his way through college.  My father-in-law wanted to be a veterinarian,<br/>
but could not get in to college because of poor grades  and lack of money.<br/>
He ended up working in factories his whole life.  My mother wanted to be a<br/>
doctor, and well, she just saw no other option than to have six kids and be<br/>
home with them, but we won&#39;t go there.<br/>
<br/>
Here in Michigan, the governor and the State Board of Education are<br/>
constantly trying to figure out how to get the kids in high school to<br/>
prepare for the jobs that are available, namely factory work.  Most of these<br/>
jobs don&#39;t require a college education, and just a month or so our local<br/>
paper the governor was touting this as wonderful for the economy, that there<br/>
are all of these *great* jobs that don&#39;t require a college ed.  This sickens<br/>
me!!!!!  No mention of what kind of society we want to live in, what gifts<br/>
and skills all of these young people have, what kind of important work they<br/>
want to do with their lives.<br/>
<br/>
There should be the option to go to school or not, to learn by doing and<br/>
apprenticeship instead of only by books and tests, to raise a family or make<br/>
a million.  I guess that instead of saying we should be working for<br/>
universal higher education, what I really meant to say was the goal is the<br/>
*option* for *everyone* to have a higher education if they so choose.  Would<br/>
you agree here?<br/>
<br/>
Instead, we have &quot;compulsory education&quot; for pre-schoolers, and a job market<br/>
that is exclusive and elitist.  Is there any wonder that drug use,<br/>
depression, and suicide is rampant among teenagers?<br/>
