 size="2">YOU KNOW YOU&#39;RE TRAILER TRASH WHEN... <br><br>1. The Halloween pumpkin on 
your porch has more teeth than your spouse. <br><br>2. You let your 
twelve-year-old daughter smoke at the dinner table in front <br>of her kids. 
<br><br>3. You&#39;ve been married three times and still have the same in-laws. 
<br><br>4. You think a woman who is &quot;out of your league&quot; bowls on a different 
night. <br><br><br>5. Jack Daniel&#39;s makes your list of &quot;most admired people.&quot; 
<br><br>6. You wonder how service stations keep their restrooms so clean. 
<br><br>7. Anyone in your family ever died right after saying, &quot;Hey watch this.&quot; 
<br><br>8. You think Dom Perignon is a Mafia leader. <br><br>9. Your wife&#39;s 
hairdo was once ruined by a ceiling fan. <br><br>10. Your junior prom had a 
daycare. <br><br>11. You think the last words of the Star Spangled Banner are, 
&quot;Gentlemen <br>start your engines.&quot; <br><br>12. You lit a match in the bathroom 
and your house exploded right off its <br>wheels. <br><br>13. The bluebook value 
of your truck goes up and down, depending on how much <br><br>gas is in it. 
<br><br>14. You have to go outside to get something from the fridge. <br><br>15. 
One of your kids was born on a pool table. <br><br>16. You need one more hole 
punched in your card to get a freebie at the <br>House <br>of Tattoos. 
<br><br>17. You can&#39;t get married to your sweetheart because there&#39;s a law 
against <br>it. <br><br>18. You think loading a dishwasher means getting your 
wife drunk. <br><br>19. Your toilet paper has page numbers on it. <br><br>20. 
Your front porch collapses and kills more than five dogs.
