<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448318520">Hi everyone-<br/>
<br/>
I have a situation with my 17 year old son and I need some <br/>
suggestions on how to deal with it.  My 3 kids have been out of <br/>
school for 4 years (the best 4 years of my life) and I have been <br/>
trying to create a positive unschooling life for the entire 4 <br/>
years.  I&#39;ve come to believe that unschooling is an extension of a <br/>
completely positive parenting style, so I&#39;ve shifted my parenting <br/>
style to a much healthier place.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, my son Ben has insisted that he wants to take the SAT test and <br/>
go to a 4 year university for film making and writing.(I do not want <br/>
him to take the SAT).  We discussed this at length - the pro&#39;s and <br/>
con&#39;s  and ways that he can get into a college without the SAT- and <br/>
he made the final decision that he wants to take the SAT and that he <br/>
needs the SAT prep class.  I really believe that he got caught up in <br/>
the hype with some of his friends who are preparing to take the <br/>
SAT&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
So, I signed him up for the SAT prep class (at the local high school)<br/>
for a fee of $250.  I also signed him up for a creative writing <br/>
class that he REALLY wanted to take at the local adult ed. center, <br/>
for a fee of $39.  He got home from the 1st SAT prep class and he <br/>
was totally disgusted with it.  He was in a state of shock at the <br/>
way he was treated, and he was reminded of all the reasons that he <br/>
left school.  He hates the class and doesn&#39;t want to go back!  In <br/>
contrast, he went to the first writing class and was treated as an <br/>
equal, published authors were talking to him as though his <br/>
conversation was important.  Ben is to call the instructor by his <br/>
first name (this was very important to Ben for some reason).  Well, <br/>
he is so inspired, that he is again writing every day, he is <br/>
developing ideas etc..  He really wants his future to be filled with <br/>
writing books and making films.<br/>
<br/>
My dilema is that I spent $250 of not so easy to come by cash.  My <br/>
husband is opposed to letting him drop the class, because of the <br/>
money issue and that we advised him against taking the class to <br/>
begin with.  I see no point in him continuing with the class, <br/>
because his mind has already dropped it.  However, I am not taking <br/>
the $250 expense lightly.  He is not insensitive to the $250 issue <br/>
and said he will finish out the 5 remaing classes since we paid for <br/>
them, but I just know it is a waste of his time and he is very <br/>
unhappy about it.  I am desparetly trying to find someone to take <br/>
his place in the class, and perhaps recoup some of our money, but so <br/>
far no luck.  Please help me see a sensible resolution to this.  And <br/>
thank you all for the inspiration that I continually get from this <br/>
list.<br/>

  We&#39;ve had similar situations (although not as much money) such  as signing <br/>
up for a guitar class and paying for a month in advance and feeling  it was <br/>
just not worth the time to continue with a particular  teacher. <br/>
 <br/>
I imagine your son does feel bad about the money and I would do everything  I <br/>
could to support his decision and just let it go.  What would you do if  you <br/>
signed up for  a real estate class and paid $395.00 and realized after  a <br/>
couple of weeks that real estate was not something you ever wanted to  do?  I&#39;d <br/>
double check  their refund policy and then just chalk up as  something that <br/>
didn&#39;t work out.<br/>
 <br/>
The money is not nearly as important as your relationship with your son and  <br/>
I think supporting his decision to drop the class and help him not feel  <br/>
guilty about it is much more valuable than the $295.00.  He evaluated  the <br/>
situation and made a decision that was best for him.  I imagine it was  a huge <br/>
learning experience and I&#39;d rather my child make that kind of decision  rather than <br/>
sit through weeks of something that was not going to be worthwhile  for him.<br/>

&lt;&lt; and <br/>
<br/>
he made the final decision that he wants to take the SAT and that he <br/>
<br/>
needs the SAT prep class.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can see letting him make that first decision, but sheesh, there are books <br/>
he could&#39;ve gotten USED rather than taking the class.   He can decide to take a <br/>
class, but how can he unilaterally make the final decision that you will <br/>
spend $250?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if he bought a dozen donuts and the first one made him <br/>
puke, would your husband force him to eat the other 11?  Would it matter whether <br/>
the donuts had cost $3 or $250?<br/>
<br/>
On a third hand (look how many of us there are here, we can have hundreds of <br/>
different suggestions &lt;g&gt;),  maybe try to CALMLY tell him that you don&#39;t mind <br/>
paying $250 for a class he wanted to take, but you&#39;re not thrilled with $250 <br/>
down a rat hole, so he should pay you back for the classes he didn&#39;t take so <br/>
you won&#39;t resent it for life, or he should just suck it up and go to the classes.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t make him pay right now, but just kinda put it on his account to <br/>
repay you someday when he&#39;s makng money.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the best idea, but it&#39;s an idea.<br/>

Perhaps it would help your husband to see it in some perspective. How much<br/>
do you spend on birthday or Christmas (if you do it) gifts? What if you had<br/>
been purchasing a high school graduation gift as well? Maybe it would seem<br/>
like a smaller sum of money if compared to other things that are *gifts* -<br/>
ie no strings attached.<br/>
<br/>
What if dh had bought tickets to a series of sailboat trips and turned out<br/>
to get so seasick that Dramamine didn&#39;t help? Would dh feel he had to<br/>
continue anyway? Others will have other examples of not continuing with<br/>
something because it is harmful and a waste of time.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your ds has gotten a million dollars worth of great knowledge just<br/>
from that one class he took, so it was worth it to return him to his<br/>
unschooling mindset. You took him out of school didn&#39;t you? What if you and<br/>
dh had felt it was a &quot;waste&quot; of the prior investment in school to not make<br/>
him finish out high school? Wouldn&#39;t your lives of joy be diminished? I hope<br/>
you can convince dh not to let your son&#39;s last few months of being at home,<br/>
if he is going off to college soon, be diminished by this &quot;mistake&quot; of<br/>
thinking he needed this class.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if all else fails, you could call it a loan to your son (by all<br/>
mean pro-rate the one class he did attend!) and make the pay back date some<br/>
time in the far future when your ds is a famous published author with pots<br/>
of money. Then in a little while when the &quot;emotional wound&quot; of seeing that<br/>
money go away is healed, you and dh can &quot;forgive&quot; the debt. <br/>

DEMAND your money back! If the class is as your son describes, it is a<br/>
bad class and they should refund your money. The company needs to know<br/>
that there is a problem with the teacher for that class, or whatever<br/>
is behind this poor quality. If the local office is unresponsive, and<br/>
it is a national company, contact the headquearters. They need to know<br/>
that there is a problem in their organization.<br/>
<br/>
I would leave out any mention of your son as a homeschooler. It is<br/>
irrelevant and could muddy the water. You don&#39;t want them thinking,<br/>
&quot;Oh, this spoiled homeschhool brat can&#39;t cut it in the normal world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Clearly the class is not as it was promoted, or your son would not be<br/>
experiencing something so different from his expectations. They owe<br/>
you a refund -- and an apology!!<br/>
<br/>
If no matter how hard you fight for your consumer rights, you can&#39;t<br/>
get your money back, then what? Ask yourself what you would do if it<br/>
were you or your husband, rather than your son, who was all for taking<br/>
the class. Or what you would do it were a class that you were taking<br/>
for yourself that you hated, but couldn&#39;t get your money back from.<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, I used to teach SAT and GRE prep classes (for the<br/>
Princeton Review). The students and I had a lot of fun, and I could<br/>
tell that for the high school students, especially, it was such a<br/>
relief -- sometimes even a shock -- to be with someone who treated<br/>
them as equals who were there of their own free will to get something<br/>
they wanted, not as wards who were there to something feisted on them<br/>
whether they liked it or not. That was how the PR prepped me in their<br/>
training.</div>
