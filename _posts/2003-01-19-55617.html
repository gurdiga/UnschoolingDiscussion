<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502356300">Okay, I&#39;ve been reading, googling chating with Jason looking stuff up <br/>
and am starting to get the whole sugar, food colors thing. I guess <br/>
that I&#39;m coming from being told that I was a hyperactive child. Sugar <br/>
was something that I was not aloud as a child, I had my first candy <br/>
bar at 13. I was able to have cake on my birthday and sometimes at <br/>
others, but it always had to have the frosting scraped off. I was <br/>
lectured never to have anything with yellow food coloring because it <br/>
made me bitchy, red and purple would keep me up all night, the list <br/>
was endless. I was put on the Finegold diet. My mom told me that they <br/>
had me tested for food allergies and that I was allergic to refined <br/>
sugars, food colorings and some additives. I was 6 when she told me <br/>
all this and I belived it. <br/>
So after all my reading this morning I called up and asked my dad if <br/>
it was true, guess what he said...nope it was not, I have never been <br/>
tested for any type of allergies and he dosen&#39;t remember why they <br/>
told me everything that they did or why they didn&#39;t let me have <br/>
anything with color or sugar.<br/>
So now I&#39;m kinda angry, and I am determined not to do this to my <br/>
kids, but I have 25 years of programing to get passed and I am sure <br/>
that I have convinced myself that I have seen &quot;hyperactive behavior&quot; <br/>
in my kids. I don&#39;t know how to let go of all of it. <br/>
Thanx everybody, for helping me with this.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So after all my reading this morning I called up and asked my dad if <br/>
it was true, guess what he said...nope it was not, I have never been <br/>
tested for any type of allergies and he dosen&#39;t remember why they <br/>
told me everything that they did or why they didn&#39;t let me have <br/>
anything with color or sugar. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I think this is the kind of situation LOTS of kids are in.  <br/>
<br/>
And I think when a mom says &quot;I know my children better than anyone, and when <br/>
they eat boiled eggs they have bad dreams&quot; or whatever is not being very <br/>
scientific, and often is just justifying something she wants to do or doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Correlation without cause, again.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom and a doctor agreed (for no great reason) that I was allergic to <br/>
chocolate.  My &quot;symptoms&quot; were excema patches inside the bends of my arms <br/>
(nearly constant) and the backs of my legs (more rare).  That&#39;s it.  Nothing <br/>
else.  So I was deprived of chocolate for seven or eight years.  When I ate <br/>
chocolate on the sly, there was no change whatsoever in the condition, but <br/>
had I reported that I would have been in trouble for being sneaky.<br/>
<br/>
Also they said nylon.  I still don&#39;t wear nylon much.  It bothers me.  I&#39;m <br/>
always aware of it.  I didn&#39;t mind wearing cotton underwear.  Nylon stockings <br/>
don&#39;t bother me.  But the nylon cloth material, like slips, that&#39;s a little <br/>
irritating.  <br/>
<br/>
So my mom didn&#39;t lie, per se, she just jumped on a magic &quot;cure&quot; for something <br/>
that probably, in retrospect, had more to do with my needing more baths.  We <br/>
rarely had a shower while I was growing up (for a year or so when I was five <br/>
or six), and my mom &quot;made&quot; us take baths once a week.  Not enough.  There <br/>
were four girls, and we only ever had one bathroom.  When I was really little <br/>
it was water poured into a #2 washtub.  We had a water heater, but not a <br/>
finished bathroom for many years.  Outhouse and washtub. <br/>
<br/>
Holly is sensitive to bubble baths and fancy bath soaps.  I was too.  I used <br/>
to use Ivory soap or bath oil.  NOT good for excema.  <br/>
<br/>
Every time my  mom gave the other kids chocolate and me something else, she <br/>
should&#39;ve given me chocolate and let me play in the bathtub for a while <br/>
afterward.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s done is done,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t need to be done with MY kids.  They <br/>
talk to me about what bothers them and doesn&#39;t, whether it&#39;s food or soap or <br/>
clothing or whatever, and I listen to them.  I help them figure out from <br/>
trial and error whether something they believe is true IS true (if they want <br/>
to figure it out--Marty has superstitions), and I remind them that something <br/>
they don&#39;t like now, they might like when they&#39;re older.  Holly has lately <br/>
discovered mushrooms and avocado.   Instead of &quot;I don&#39;t like spinach&quot; <br/>
(PERIOD) we encourage kids to say &quot;I don&#39;t like spinach yet.&quot;  or &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
like it these days,&quot; or whatever.  To leave the door open for change.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who was a known and admitted liar (although from time to time <br/>
she would deny that she ever lied, of course).  I kept her kids sometimes.  <br/>
She had told one of her kids he was allergic to milk.  He knew he wasn&#39;t, and <br/>
so ignored her.<br/>
<br/>
Note, first:  When a child knows a mom is bullshitting and he starts to <br/>
ignore her, where does that end?<br/>
<br/>
She told me plainly once that he wasn&#39;t allergic to it, but she TOLD people <br/>
he was, because she just didn&#39;t want him to have it.<br/>
<br/>
Then once when she left him at my house she said, &quot;Dane&#39;s allergic to milk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  For years I let him eat what he wanted to and never had a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I ignored her too.  Soon I ignored everything she said.  Soon I assumed what <br/>
she said was likely the opposite of the truth.  That was a shame.<br/>
<br/>
Some years later she moved to another state and asked me to write her a <br/>
recommendation for a job.  I asked her if she was more honest than she had <br/>
been before, because I was unwilling to recommend her if she hadn&#39;t changed <br/>
that aspect of her behavior.    (There was an SCA overlay to the whole thing, <br/>
too, and she had left some people in situations I had had to clean up after, <br/>
but still...)<br/>
<br/>
Long story about another mom consciously and admittedly lying to a child and <br/>
others about an allergy.<br/>

On the other hand, there are some people who really are allergic to <br/>
foods.  I&#39;ve held my son as his body went limp, his lips got swollen, <br/>
and he had difficulty breathing.  I had been feeling bad for him, and <br/>
I let him have a piece of birthday cake and something fried in butter <br/>

<br/>
No doubt.  <br/>
This boy&#39;s mom had already TOLD me that when she told people he was allergic <br/>
that she was lying.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a question of whether allergies actually exist.  It&#39;s whether some <br/>
moms will lie to children and others when they know there is no allergy, just <br/>
to control something in their world.<br/>
<br/>
And they do it at the expense of their integrity, and ultimately at the <br/>
expense of their child and their relationship with their child.   <br/>

seeing friends get away with all sorts of real allergies, I made mine up. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
To control MY world! &lt;GGG&gt; I wasn&#39;t &quot;made&quot; to drink milk at home, but I WAS <br/>
at school and at friends&#39; houses. BLECH! My &quot;allergy &quot;worked&quot;!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A lot of people confuse a food intolerance with an allergy. An allergic reaction to a food quite often means swelling, difficulty beathing,  rashesetc etc as soon as the substance is introduced. An<br/>
intolarence can mean eczma, asthma, maybe a rash, behavioural problems not always instantly with the problem food.. All problems but not life threatening. A true allergy can be life threatening.<br/>
My kids develop ecxzma (I can never spell that) and did as babies because they are intolerant of dairy and eggs. It can be quite nasty - child number 2 was covered from the neck down on one occasion in<br/>
itching weeping sores. Everytime he moved his skin cracked. It was pretty unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
I think its important people tell their kids friends which it is so that accidents don&#39;t happen. Ever since I moved to Virginia I&#39;ve found people going to see &#39;their&#39; allergist and going on about their<br/>
allergies. So much so that I&#39;m afriad I&#39;ve stopped listening. Either Virginia is a super-allergic place - 3 out of every 4 people I&#39;ve met here seem to have allergies compared to 2 people back home (one<br/>
was allergic to horses, one a true allergy to eggs - anaphalctic shock etc) or generally they mean food intolerances.<br/>
Mind you, maybe there&#39;s something about Virginia. Like I said, back home I only knew two people with proper allergies, maybe a scattering with hay-fever (I get that myself) but here I know scads of<br/>
people allergic to cats, dogs, guinea-pigs, dust, pollen, mould etc etc. It&#39;s like an epidemic. Perhaps its the pollution here in North Virginia? The odd thing is, my husband has asthma and used to need<br/>
one of those inhalers. Since we moved to VA he&#39;s not had one asthma attack. Which is lucky. Cos we&#39;ve lost his inhaler.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m rambling again.<br/>
