<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753868362">Ok List, I have one for you. First, I&#39;ll give you a little background. My son <br/>
(who the Q is about) is 8, and has two sisters, 5 and almost 2. I&#39;ve always <br/>
(as in my whole life) thought it was beyond ridiculous that there were (for <br/>
instance) toys that boys were &quot;supposed&quot; to play with, and toys girls were <br/>
&quot;supposed&quot; to play with. Needless to say (or maybe not since you don&#39;t know <br/>
me), I&#39;ve ****never**** uttered one iota about any toy being for a specific <br/>
person. So, Ashlen (my son) has dolls and barbies (among lots of other <br/>
stuff!!), and my daughters have cars and action figures (among lots of other <br/>
stuff!!). If anyone ever (no one has so far) comes up to them and says that a <br/>
toy they&#39;re playing with is really for a girl/boy (whatever the case may be), <br/>
they&#39;d look at them un utter confusment, with a look of &quot;are you from mars or <br/>
something&quot;. And this is a whole philosophy (not just something about toys), <br/>
that whatever interests you, interests you! Has nothing to do with gender <br/>
around here. My square, old fashion in-laws, have never said anything, but I <br/>
could always &quot;read their minds&quot; when my son got a big ole doll for his <br/>
birthday, or when my daughter asked them for a huge Rescue Hero station for <br/>
Christmas. (Etc, etc.....) (Something that&#39;s been very eye-opening to me is <br/>
that my son loves the *boy* toys way more often than the *girl* toys, and my <br/>
daughters -even the baby- like the *girl* toys way more often then the *boy* <br/>
toys! And many other so-called &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; things!! All without any <br/>
utterance from anyone. There&#39;s a ***** definite ***** genetic thing going on <br/>
here!) Anyhooooooo, my son, in the last year or so has *noticed* that his <br/>
sisters have dresses and skirts, and he doesn&#39;t, so I&#39;ve explained that girls <br/>
usually wear them, and not boys. It was a bit strange to him to hear that the <br/>
first time, because there had never before been anything that one sex was <br/>
supposed to do and not the other. Luckily, he really didn&#39;t care (meaning he <br/>
didn&#39;t ask for one). And I explained to him that even though it&#39;s silly, s<br/>
ociety has a tradition that some things are for boys, and some for girls. We <br/>
just agreed it was silly. Also, he has long hair, and only just recently, did <br/>
someone call him a girl (to his face), and he realized that long hair is <br/>
usually a *girl* thing. Anyway, I&#39;m getting to my question, I really am!! <br/>
Just want you to know where we&#39;re all coming from! The kids wear make up <br/>
around the house whenever they feel like it (it&#39;s not very often though). <br/>
They have their own stash, and dress up &quot;fancy&quot; sometimes, with make up and <br/>
frilly play clothes. They&#39;ve asked before if they could wear make up &quot;out&quot; <br/>
too, because that&#39;s what I do. But they didn&#39;t insist, and when I asked them <br/>
if it was ok if they&#39;d please just wait till we got home, and then they <br/>
could, they said yea, and it was dropped. My son just asked again today. So <br/>
my question is; Should I just lump it (the looks and snares and maybe even <br/>
some comments that I&#39;ll get taking them into public), and just say &quot;OK&quot; the <br/>
next time I&#39;m asked, or; Do I keep doing what I&#39;m doing, since he/they really <br/>
aren&#39;t putting up a fight anyway about it, and say &quot;how about not, let&#39;s just <br/>
wait till we get home&quot;? AND is your answer different if it comes to him/them <br/>
**really** wanting to do it? AND is your answer different for my son than my <br/>
daughter?   SORRY so looooong!!!!  Thanks, Lara........</div>

I&#39;m going to answer my own Q, and tell me if I&#39;m way off!!   If he *really* <br/>
wants to, then yes, lump it. We lump lots of other things that society <br/>
doesn&#39;t like, why should this be any different?     Lara...........</div>

 </span></blockquote>I guess I would point out that it isn&#39;t common for boys to wear makeup and<br/>
people tend to make comments about things that they find unusual. You don&#39;t<br/>
need to portray it as a negative, scary thing so much as an interesting<br/>
observation on the rest of society just so he isn&#39;t making the decision in a<br/>
vacuum.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to add to it that, just for interests sake, there are some boys<br/>
who do wear makeup like actors. And punks, goths. Historically there have<br/>
been times and places when it was common.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyhooooooo, my son, in the last year or so has *noticed* that his<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could ask him if he can think of a reason why.<br/>
<br/>
There are undoubtedly sexist reasons for insisting women must wear skirts,<br/>
but I&#39;m thinking that originally skirts were more practical for going to the<br/>
bathroom for girls. If one had to wear something that is.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very definitely. The differences in the sexes isn&#39;t just sexist stuff.<br/>
Though I happen to have a girl who&#39;s always liked boy toys more than girl<br/>
toys ;-)<br/>

<br/>
In some other cultures, women wear pants of some sort and men wear &quot;skirts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems random overall.<br/>
<br/>
What I would personally do and what you want to do could likely be two WAY <br/>
different sets of things, but I would casually and gradually find him things <br/>
with men in makeup.  Rock&#39;n&#39;roll concerts of David Bowie, Keith Richards <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;/Mick Jagger, Prince.   I would bring along To Wong Foo; Priscilla, <br/>
Queen of the Desert; and my current amazement, the Eddie Izzard special.  <br/>
He&#39;s wearing make-up but it has nothing to do with anything, he just likes <br/>
to.  <br/>
<br/>
But then I think... my kids have seen all that stuff and the boys haven&#39;t <br/>
ever worn make-up.  But because of those things, if your son comes over <br/>
wearing make-up they&#39;re not going to act like simian rednecks, either!<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes to wear makeup and she doesn&#39;t always, but when she does it <br/>
ranges from subtle and tasteful to long purple Halloween fake eyelashes (two <br/>
weeks ago, for the Harry Potter tournament), stick-on jewels, three-tone nail <br/>
polish...   I just let it go.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times I have reminded her that some families don&#39;t think young <br/>
girls should wear make-up and that I don&#39;t mind her wearing it, but if a <br/>
conservative family seems disturbed, that&#39;s why.   And a couple of times I&#39;ve <br/>
done a little more careful reminding of being careful for men and cars and <br/>
such, when she goes out dressed looking older than she is.  That, too, is <br/>
occasional and doesn&#39;t seem to be on purpose.  She has a huge range of <br/>
styles, but a couple of times she has randomized up a set that comes on as &quot;a <br/>
little too sexy.&quot;  Once I just said &quot;That needs a Levi jacket if you&#39;re going <br/>
out in a very public place.&quot;   She understood.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a shame there are perverts and nasty guys, but unfortunately there are.  <br/>
And if she dressed as modestly as the local Mennonites, there would still be <br/>
perverts and nasty guys.  If all women wearing grey could prevent perversion, <br/>
that would be EASY!<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I have gone afield. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Answers to all questions:  &quot;It depends.&quot;<br/>

Sand in the desert?<br/>
That&#39;s where lots of women wear pants traditionally.  Nomadic tribes.<br/>
<br/>
Men&#39;s pants in northwestern Europe/Britain/Scandinavia were for a long time, <br/>
1000 years and some ago separate leggings before they had a crotch.  They <br/>
were tied to a belt.  So there were two pants legs but no &quot;pair of pants.&quot;  <br/>
Women didn&#39;t wear them.  They also weren&#39;t in a sandy desert.<br/>

<br/>
Some cultures are fur based (and their clothing styles even now reflect that) <br/>
and some are cloth based (and ditto).  <br/>
<br/>
One of the coolest books ever is a little pamphlet, basically, from The Royal <br/>
Ontario Museum called Cut My Cote.  The museum didn&#39;t have it listed for <br/>
sale.  Some other places did but I&#39;m not bringing a link because their <br/>
descriptions (two I read) were off the mark.  But if any of you come across <br/>
it used, it&#39;s worth getting for sure.  I  has 38 pages, it has a <br/>
screen-printed style cover, white on black.<br/>

<br/>
European evolution of pants started with one crotch wrap and then leg wraps.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re more complicated than a skirt with a seam, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
On really interesting traditional pants style in India  has a GIANT crotch <br/>
section, and tight legs to the knees.  They look like a big arch three feet <br/>
wide at the top when laid out flat.  <br/>
Japanese hakama are interesting, too--LOTS of cloth, pleated, tied in such a <br/>
way as to give a lot of flexibility.<br/>
<br/>
Pants are interesting, but not simple.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found this and it has something about traditional Middle Eastern makeup.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t followed many links, but there are LOTS.  It&#39;s the site of an SCA <br/>
costumer, I think at a glance, but the background and title art on the page <br/>
are so great that even without the make-up tie in, it&#39;s worth a look.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Pants are relatively complex to make. There must have been a driving need<br/>
to<br/>
create something more complex. So what was it?&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-102203915">Mosaics from ancient Rome show women entertainers in bikini underwear -<br/>
strophium and pagne.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Reliefs from the 2nd century AD show Roman soldiers clearly in some type<br/>
of pant - like pedal pushers - right beside their skirted counterparts.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Long pants were worn by women and men in the Byzantine time under the<br/>
long and short tunics, an influence from Persian pantaloons and Iranian<br/>
costumes. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Pants are shown in a fresco from 3rd century BC and the text of my book<br/>
(20000 years of Fashion - Francios Boucher) says they came from the<br/>
mountain dwellers of the Steppes of Central Asia. The book calls the<br/>
trousers &quot;an innovation of capital importance&quot; and &quot;indissolubly linked<br/>
with the use of the horse in the Steppes&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It is also suggested that trousers were the garb of the affluent - which<br/>
makes sense from the complexity of the construction in comparison to a<br/>
tunic type of garment.<br/>

  &gt; Should I just lump it (the looks and snares and maybe even<br/>
  &gt; some comments that I&#39;ll get taking them into public), and just say &quot;OK&quot; the<br/>
  &gt; next time I&#39;m asked<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I would point out that it isn&#39;t common for boys to wear makeup and<br/>
  people tend to make comments about things that they find unusual. You don&#39;t<br/>
  need to portray it as a negative, scary thing so much as an interesting<br/>
  observation on the rest of society just so he isn&#39;t making the decision in a<br/>
  vacuum.<br/>
<br/>
  You may want to add to it that, just for interests sake, there are some boys<br/>
  who do wear makeup like actors. And punks, goths. Historically there have<br/>
  been times and places when it was common.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Anyhooooooo, my son, in the last year or so has *noticed* that his<br/>
  &gt; sisters have dresses and skirts, and he doesn&#39;t, so I&#39;ve explained that girls<br/>
  &gt; usually wear them, and not boys. It was a bit strange to him to hear that the<br/>
  &gt; first time, because there had never before been anything that one sex was<br/>
  &gt; supposed to do and not the other.<br/>
<br/>
  You could ask him if he can think of a reason why.<br/>
<br/>
  There are undoubtedly sexist reasons for insisting women must wear skirts,<br/>
  but I&#39;m thinking that originally skirts were more practical for going to the<br/>
  bathroom for girls. If one had to wear something that is.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Something that&#39;s been very eye-opening to me is<br/>
  &gt; that my son loves the *boy* toys way more often than the *girl* toys, and my<br/>
  &gt; daughters -even the baby- like the *girl* toys way more often then the *boy*<br/>
  &gt; toys!<br/>
<br/>
  Very definitely. The differences in the sexes isn&#39;t just sexist stuff.<br/>
  Though I happen to have a girl who&#39;s always liked boy toys more than girl<br/>
  toys ;-)<br/>
