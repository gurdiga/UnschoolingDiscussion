<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722260288">You posted that you feel it would be unfair to give your son A&#39;s for having<br/>
fun while other kids are getting A&#39;s having to do boring stuff.  What about<br/>
the kids in ps?  Some are having a blast, some hate it.  Some don&#39;t have to<br/>
study at all, some work late into the night.  Does that mean none of the ps<br/>
kids that find ps a breeze should get a patch?<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree though about not being thrilled by the idea of the patch.<br/>
Too much like a gold star.  Of course, now I&#39;m not even that thrilled with<br/>
different colored belts for the same reason.  What does the sensei say?<br/>
Would your son be interested in maybe working on a special project for the<br/>
sensei to get the patch (possibly researching the history of his style,<br/>
doing a biography of past masters, etc.) rather than grades per se?<br/>

That&#39;s a cool idea even without the patch.</div>
