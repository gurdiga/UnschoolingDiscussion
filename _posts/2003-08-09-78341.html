      I&#39;ll second that! Just another week and a half before we leave. I&#39;ll be<br/>
  down thursday early evening. Anyone want to meet for dinner? I didn&#39;t want<br/>
  to miss any of the fun stuff on friday. Would have had to leave at 3 or 4AM<br/>
  if we&#39;d waited till friday. LOL! Not exactly my cup of tea.<br/>

  &gt; Going to the conference is one of the best possible things you can do for<br/>
  &gt; your unschooling, and you shouldn&#39;t let a goofy thing like money stop you!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Marji, who is REALLY looking forward!!! <br/>
