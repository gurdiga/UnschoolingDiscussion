<div id="ygrps-yiv-257961886">We decided not to immunize anylonger.. our first child who is now 16yrs had<br/>
&#39;most&#39; .. the 2nd dd age 10..only about &#39;half&#39; and the last dd age<br/>
6yrs..none at all. We read and researched allot before making this decision.<br/>

Dr. Mercola has an excellent site and lots of info about immunizations..<br/>

immunized.  My mom and dad made the decision based on research.  I&#39;ve even <br/>
spent time in Mexico without contracting anything.  I&#39;ve cared for babies who <br/>
were been immunized with the live polio vaccine.  However, I was aware and <br/>
practiced good prevention techniques.<br/>

I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m proof that vaccines aren&#39;t necessary but I think my <br/>
experience and that of a few other adults like me are good cause to consider <br/>
that sanitation and awareness are a large part of the picture in the decline <br/>
of these diseases.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506481327">Hi Kris,<br/>
I too have never been immunized, my mother chose not to! I have been a sub <br/>
teacher, a medical assistant, nurses aide, just to name a few! No one has <br/>
ever asked me!<br/>
