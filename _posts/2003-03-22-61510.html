<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033302950">My mom had a guitar all the time I was growing up and played country and <br/>
western stuff.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I was old enough to get interested, 13 or 14 or so, we had three <br/>
guitars.  The one I was using was a now-sought-after, then crappy-scary, big <br/>
blues guitar.  It had a curved front like a violin, with f-holes.  The <br/>
strings were NOT near the neck.  The neck wasn&#39;t flat.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to tune it (from having heard my mom tune for years, I knew what the <br/>
progression of notes sounded like) and just play it flat on the bed like <br/>
people played electric steel guitars (which we also had at the time).  So I <br/>
got where the half-steps were and found the scales, just messing.<br/>
<br/>
It was too big for me to hold right. <br/>
<br/>
When I was fourteen turning fifteen, that summer, I really wanted to learn.  <br/>
My friend Ymelda Martinez was playing, and she said she would teach me.  I <br/>
went to her house and she showed me how to use chord charts and I played <br/>
&quot;Banks of the Ohio,&quot; a fine American murder ballad with three chords (four <br/>
when you get fancy and use a 7th).    I told her I&#39;d come back for another <br/>
lesson when I had learned that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I never had another lesson.  We still joke about it sometimes, how she taught <br/>
me guitar.  She says &quot;I DID NOT!&quot;  I say yes, she did, because I needed those <br/>
pointers and advice about how to hold my hand and information about how to <br/>
read the notation.  Then I just went.<br/>
<br/>
But one of the first things I did was to get a better, more modern guitar.  I <br/>
sold my clarinet and bought an $82 Ventura (Japanese) with a flat neck, more <br/>
narrow than a classical guitar, smaller body than that monster blues guitar, <br/>
and I was totally zooming then.  I still have that guitar.  And a C.F. <br/>
Martin. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are probably lots of sites online with chords, and songs with chord <br/>
changes marked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125707120">LOL OK OK!! I GIVE!!! :-) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m already thinking...so it&#39;ll take me about a month<br/>
to put aside the money to go buy one for me and<br/>
Sarah..no big deal...less time if I&#39;m extra sweet to<br/>
my husband LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
Thing is...I just bought a new trumpet that is just<br/>
SITTING in the darn closet because I broke one of my<br/>
front teeth (I mean it is cracked all the way through<br/>
and about to fall out!!) and can&#39;t play it!!! He<br/>
understands, but he&#39;ll want to be certain that if I <br/>
buy one I&#39;ll do something with it and not just do it<br/>
for a couple weeks and it sit around the house for the<br/>
next twenty years. <br/>
<br/>
BUT Sarah has CONSISTANTLY asked to play the guitar<br/>
for over two years now..so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a<br/>
fleeting interest for her; and I know I can teach<br/>
myself. I have a friend who is also self-taught who<br/>
has said she&#39;ll teach me what she knows if I&#39;m<br/>
interested although she can&#39;t read notation well. <br/>

...if you&#39;re both still loving it in a few months, then save up to get one <br/>
of her very own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849344426">Nah...I&#39;ll go ahead and buy, with soon-to-be four<br/>
kids, even if Sarah decides she&#39;s not that interested<br/>
in the guitar, one of the others very well could be<br/>
(Logan has been pretending EVERYTHING is a guitar for<br/>
months now) eventually as well. <br/>
<br/>
Now &quot;renting to own&quot; for three months? that&#39;s a<br/>
possibility although it would be combined with the<br/>
trumpet payments I already have going; so I think it&#39;d<br/>
be better to just put it aside on my own and then get<br/>
one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We did that with a violin and then ended up buying one on eBay.  A teeny <br/>
weeny violin (1/16th I think) for my four year old.  BUT, we also ended up <br/>
paying for the rental for quite some time due to disorganization..  That&#39;s <br/>
how they make their money, I guess.<br/>
