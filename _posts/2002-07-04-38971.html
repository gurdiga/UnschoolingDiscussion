I admire your attitude.  This is one of those things that just burns me up.<br/>
We (as a society) no longer seem to think about what would be best for our<br/>
children, only what would be easy for us.  School is easy, so school is<br/>
good.  Just keep on marching to your own drummer, and forget about the pied<br/>
piper the rest of the world is listening to!<br/>
