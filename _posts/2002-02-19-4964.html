Music on CDs or tapes with easy words (kids&#39; songs).<br/>
TV shows, if you have a Spanish channel, or old tapes of Plaza Sesamo (I&#39;m <br/>
not sure of the exact name of their version of Sesame Street) or other kids&#39; <br/>
shows.  &quot;Villa Allegre&quot; was a bi-lingual one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you in a place where there are TV programs in Spanish?  You could make <br/>
a game of watching shows and trying to figure out what&#39;s going on.  (My <br/>
grandfather and I used to watch movies with the sound turned off and try to <br/>
guess.  Sometimes it was hilarious.)<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe there&#39;s someone nearby who speaks Spanish well and is lonely.  You <br/>
could invite that person to come for coffee and Spanish conversation once a <br/>
week.  If you have enough Spanish to understand and be understood (even <br/>
just barely), you and the person could have a conversation without putting <br/>
your son on the spot.  He could just listen, joining in only if he felt <br/>
comfortable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579380354">ooooh, Joanna Thanks!!!  My son doesn&#39;t like SS so I never thought to look<br/>
there.  He is already engrossed in the game link you sent.  Thanks!!<br/>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll absorb this one by next week.  Time to round up some other<br/>
ideas to have waiting in the wings :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990582680">I know Dora the Explorer on Nickelodeon deals with learning Spanish. My boys are 9 & 10 and they watch it a few times a week (shhhh....don&#39;t tell anyone....this show is geared towards younger kids and they would not admit to watching it!)<br/>
<br/>
My boys also take a wonderful Spanish class once a week from an ex-Spanish teacher who is Mexican. She is the best. She teaches them mostly through games and songs and makes it so fun. She also brings food and treats every time, and rewards all the kids regardless of how well they do. She started out with the pronunciation of the Spanish alphabet, singing the A-B-C song and also with a standard list of about 20-30 common nouns to learn throughout the house (like door, window, table, chair, pen, pencil, book, etc.) Maybe you could write some of these words on index cards and place them over or on the object? (like over the door place the card puerta)<br/>
She also taught them a few basic commands like stand up, sit down, open, pick up, walk to, etc... and very soon was speaking real sentences to them in Spanish and they could understand! (Abre el libro - open the book)<br/>
She&#39;s also having them learn numbers to 20, days of the week, and months of the year, and a few common diagloges.<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe it&#39;s just because she is a fun teacher and she knows what she is doing, but the kids are really enjoying learning Spanish from her, and me too!<br/>

Thank you Karin!<br/>
Our homeschool group has an ongoing spanish class but my son is much too<br/>
active to enjoy it (it&#39;s more of a &#39;circle time&#39; type teaching).<br/>
We used to watch Dora the Explorer until Matthew got over his television<br/>
fixation and now he has no interest in TV so we cancelled our cable.  He<br/>
picked up some from the show and loved it at the time.<br/>
The reason he is SOOO interested in spanish is a friend of his is bilingual<br/>
French and so he knows how neat another language is.  And he knows mommy and<br/>
daddy know a smattering of spanish, so he&#39;s fixated on it.  I haven&#39;t done<br/>
much about it until now (busy with the baby).  Time to get cracking with<br/>
these labels! :)<br/>

My college boyfriend had grown up in India speaking only Hindi, and started <br/>
learning English when he was 12 or so, from a Harry Belafonte album.  The <br/>
accent didn&#39;t hurt him any.  He learned ALL the words, and when he moved to <br/>
Toronto it made it easier for him to pick up English (even though they <br/>
weren&#39;t talking about bananas, rum, or Kingston &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

cute picture book with English and Spanish dialogue between the two girls<br/>

English and Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
We went to Mexico last October and the nearest child was my dd&#39;s age and<br/>
only spoke Spanish.  I found that it was my easier for me to use my<br/>
limited Spanish when I really had to.  If I knew the person spoke English<br/>
it was hard to not speak English myself.<br/>
