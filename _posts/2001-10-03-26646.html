<div id="ygrps-yiv-854887395">My 13 yo ds found the internet a couple months back. We have always used it,<br/>
but he found that he can meet other teens (thru approved sites) and found<br/>
interactive games. He is now on YIM whenever he finds the time. At first, he<br/>
was always asking me to read a word or spell simple things. Yesterday he was<br/>
on for hours and I realized that he didn&#39;t ask for my help even once! So, I<br/>
meandered over to the computer and looked over his shoulder to find that his<br/>
spelling was good. To think I have been so worried and it is coming<br/>
together. It can be hard to wait for your childs timing, especially when my<br/>
9 yo ds is a quick learner. :)<br/>
<br/>
Now if I could just figure out my 5 yo!! LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-974722778">Hi, Just had a moment that I had to share. I belong to a homeschooling group that advocates learning in the traditional way but occasionally have an event that we like. French lessons were offered and my seven year old was really interested. Of course had no idea what the style of teaching would be.When I asked it was going to be done in a classroom style by a teacher. His energy is big and seldom works for a lecture type environment.I was struggling with his desire versus what i know about him and whether i wanted to put out the money. I had no problem with him learning about this himself but had trouble with my commitment time and money wise.Any way i opted out of it. As I&#39;m wondering if this was not providing him with an experience we had another experience that reinforced unschooling.They wanted the trampoline put up. Normally i wait for two adults as this can be muscle taxing. The kids helped even when we had all the springs in wrong and had to undo it all again. he sun was shining, the wind was blowing, everyonehad a job and a suggestion and boy was there excitement when it was done all by ourselves.So who needs a closed in lecture French class when you can do math physics phys ed and communication and still play!!! Yahoo to unschooling<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368508399">My daughter is 12 and has some motor delays and possible seizure activity.We went to a neurologist yesterday(I won&#39;t make that mistake again) and in the end he said nothing was wrong. He based this judgement on checking her reflexes, asking me 2 or 3 questions and two out of 5 EEG test results in front of him. My daughter was very frustrated as she says she knows something is going on in her brain that makes things harder, fuzzier, and her muscles to not work when she wants them to. I told her that I was done with this whole doctor thing and that i now just wanted to focus on her strengths and accept the other areas as something that was part of her. <br/>
One of the things that happens for her is she cannot print easily and without a lot of fingerpain.She holds the pencil very atypical and has been unable to change that. The neurologist asked her why she did that and told her that was dysfunctional. I told him we knew that and obviously had tried to alter this as had the local therapists, etc...<br/>
She told me that when she needs to write and print she will just keep practising until she has it the way she wants it. She said she knows it takes her a whole bunch longer to do these motor things but she will just do it when she wants to. That is unschooling. I am so glad I am learning to trust my children and let them be all they can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700575884">**My daughter is 12 and has some motor delays and possible seizure <br/>
activity**<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered taking her to another specialist?  A motor delay should <br/>
not cause pain, as in her fingers while writing.  I&#39;d also be concerned <br/>
about he possible seizure activity.  Is this something you have observed or <br/>
suspect might be happening and resulting in motor delays?  It doesn&#39;t sound <br/>
like you were pleased with how the dotor handled the assessment/diagnosis.  <br/>
If that were my experience, I would want to give up, too.  I&#39;m not <br/>
suggesting you are wrong to do so, by any means.  From reading what you <br/>
wrote, it does sound like you have reason to be concerned and your daughter <br/>
seems to be asking for help.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was about 2 weeks old, he began having terrible green water <br/>
bowel movements.  My doctor and every book I read said it was normal, but <br/>
Ethan was lethargic and losing weight.  I tried to make doctor&#39;s <br/>
appointments but they wouldn&#39;t allow him to come in with diarrhea, yet all <br/>
the while they were telling me it was normal!?!  Huh?  She even delayed his <br/>
well baby because of it.  How is that normal?  One day, I took him to the <br/>
hospital to be weighed in the breastfeeding support center.  They made me <br/>
rush him over to my docor office and take a sample stool to show her.  She <br/>
suggested I stop breastfeeding and immediately start supplementing, which <br/>
felt wrong, but I did it.  He continued to have the diarrea.<br/>
<br/>
I called everyday for two weeks and was told the same thing until finally, <br/>
Ethan began projectile vomiting and wouldn&#39;t even turn his head away from <br/>
it.  My husband told me to call the doctor but I no longer had faith nor any <br/>
trust in her.  When I took Ethan in, he was about 6 weeks old, weighed 6 <br/>
pounds 9 ounces and had weighed 7 pounds 12 ounces at birth.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>
moving or reacting to anything.  The nurses were so kind.  I was terrified.  <br/>
They told me had I not brought him in, he wouldn&#39;t have made it through the <br/>
night.  They allowed me to hold him while they put lines in his tiny head <br/>
because they couldn&#39;t get a good vein anywhere else.  He had bruises over <br/>
the greater portion of his body.  He ended up staying in the hospital for <br/>
almost two weeks.  They thought he had rotovirus but never gave me a <br/>
conclusive diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
I later found out through the LLL that what we experienced was due to Ethan <br/>
getting too much lactose from my foremilk.  I wasn&#39;t breastfeeding long <br/>
enough on one side and he never got the chance to get my hindmilk.  Instead <br/>
of listening to my son and my insticts, I was placing all my faith in my <br/>
Ped.  I wish I would have just taken him in right from the start, whether <br/>
she wanted me to or not.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is quite different from what you are experiencing but I share <br/>
it because it sounds like you and your daughter are seeing something the <br/>
Neuro isn&#39;t.  I realize what you wrote isn&#39;t the entire story, but I can <br/>
well relate to feeling like I&#39;m not being lsitened to and wanting to give up <br/>
on doctors.  We haven&#39;t been to a doctor in almost three years.  Since Ethan <br/>
got out of the hospital, other than for stitches about half a dozen times.  <br/>
It is amazing what happens when you take a proactive stance in your childs <br/>
healthcare.  Rather than relying on faith in someone else, you learn to <br/>
listen to your children.  It sounds like she is asking for help.  Have you <br/>
researched her symptoms and found anything on your own?  Have you looked <br/>
into any homeopathic alternatives?  When I had carpel tunnel problems, I was <br/>
given excellent advice and found the pain dissappeared immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m babbling again. :)  I wish you the best.  Just keep listening to <br/>
your daughter.  Keep a journal of her symptoms and complaints and what <br/>
happens around those times.  You may find that to be very revealing and <br/>
begin to see connections and find your own solutions.  Best of luck!<br/>

You might tell her that sometimes it helps to do some big motor <br/>

groups. My son Conor also found that chewing on something helps him <br/>
write easier. He chews on ice a lot.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for your kind thoughts and suggestions.I have been struggling with this for so long that that is why I am tired. Her symptoms are subtle and one place says yes there is something and then the doctors brush me off. The seizure stuff is just a guess but given family history (5 cousins) and observing some spaced out, not remembering what we talked about, sleep walking, night terrors, lethargy and tremoring on those days and anxiety which is worse when these other things happen as well leaves me thinking I should be exploring it more. <br/>
Anyway she has been referred to a neuropsychiatrist by a psychiatrist who was seeing her for her severe panic,anxiety attacks but now I don&#39;t know if I want to even explore it.We have been working with a homeopath for 5 years with little help in this area and we have seen naturopaths, biokinesiologist and are doing vitamin therapy. I think one thing that gets in the way is the whole idea that maybe I am not accepting her the way she is  and that the whole medical institution goes against anything natural and accepting and the first question always brings up homeschooling which I feel has influenced not being taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thank you and I am sure this to will pass.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083147649">Hi Everyone    <br/>
<br/>
Just had to share this.  First a little background.  My 15yob started homeschooling 3 years ago and unschooling shortly thereafter.  I&#39;ve written before that one of &quot;my&quot; goals was to encourage more reading.  Well that and more writing.  I bought books on writing - I bought a whole curriculum on writing - I bought him a journal (still blank 2 years later) - I bought him gel pens and black paper - no results.  Now three years later (on his own with no input from me - other than I found out he was doing this when he asked me to proofread some of his stuff) he has built a web site and writes about his reptiles and his trips.  He answers questions online every day from people who want help with their pets. He writes to other people with his own questions etc.  So...<br/>
<br/>
Last night he convinced my husband to help him purchase some vine snakes.  He has told me that not a lot is known about them and he wants to study them.  My husband asked him &quot;If I invest in the vine snakes what&#39;s in it for me?&quot;  Jordan replied &quot;When I write a book about them you can share in the profit&quot; !  <br/>

were discussing the merits of The Matrix Reloaded and debating <br/>
some of the finer points in the script. My son was so thrilled with <br/>
the dialog, he spent quite a bit of time refuting one person&#39;s point <br/>
of view and then asked me to listen to it before posting to be <br/>
sure he&#39;d expressed himself well enough. This is my oldest who <br/>
&quot;doesn&#39;t&quot; like to write. Of course, he keeps a journal for <br/>
&quot;significant events&quot; so he won&#39;t forget them, but he doesn&#39;t like to <br/>
write. He discovered &quot;Live Journal&quot; online and has been <br/>
recording all his feelings, thoughts, ideas there, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like to write. He read the story of Gilgamesh online, saw a <br/>
screenplay emerge in his head, wrote it out (32 pages) but, <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to write. The Internet has been key to his interest in <br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is involved in fanfix, posts regularly to an internet <br/>
board and is on IM most days (apparently writing poetry and <br/>
stories to each other, besides sorting out teen angst and <br/>
gossip).<br/>
<br/>
My next in line (11) subscribes to a discussion group for <br/>
astronomy and reads there regularly. He asks questions of sites <br/>
when he has them. He definitely doesn&#39;t like to write. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just joined Harry Potter for grown-ups and discovered that there <br/>
are literally hundreds of discussion boards and groups for kids.<br/>
<br/>
Now this is real writing! This is the kind of writing that makes you <br/>
hone your arguments, gives you real life feedback and creates <br/>
the writing impulse. Thank God for the Internet!<br/>

his, locally or online?<br/>
