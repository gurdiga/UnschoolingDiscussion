<br/>
I only vaguely remembered having been called a name and REALLY <br/>
couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t remember the name of who did so, so for those who do <br/>
remember names well I understand your clarification, but for me, I SO don&#39;t <br/>
keep track of who said what that I honestly, truly didn&#39;t remember what <br/>
anyone had said about where they lived or what kids they had or anything.  I <br/>
read the posts for the ideas and the stories and very often don&#39;t even look <br/>
at the names.<br/>
<br/>
