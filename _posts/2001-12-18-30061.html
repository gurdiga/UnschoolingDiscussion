<br/>
&gt; Though I&#39;m from Mass I haven&#39;t been following this case on the state HSing<br/>
&gt; group&#39;s list because of the legalistic nitpicking. (It makes me realize<br/>
why<br/>
&gt; people get fed up with unschooling nitpicking ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seemed shockingly uncaring to me that MA homeschoolers weren&#39;t<br/>
supporting<br/>
&gt; the Bryants but apparently their case is based around their contention<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; the compulsory attendance law goes against state constitutionally<br/>
guaranteed<br/>
&gt; parental rights so the law itself is unconstitutional. There&#39;s a hugely<br/>
&gt; steep learning curve involved in figuring out what in the world anyone is<br/>
&gt; talking about in order to try to decide if such a law can be (legally)<br/>
&gt; unconstitutional and if so whether it is and whether that really has<br/>
&gt; anything to do with the legalities of homeschooling in MA. Basically the<br/>
&gt; rallying cry is too muddled to get everyone to answer the call.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (The Bryants stance is they don&#39;t have to submit an education plan to be<br/>
&gt; approved by the Superintendent since the compulsory attendance law is<br/>
&gt; unconstitutional. One of the problems that prevents people from rallying<br/>
&gt; around the case is that the education plan is not a much of a hoop to jump<br/>
&gt; through (I use Carol Narigon&#39;s which I can pass on if anyone&#39;s interested)<br/>
&gt; and the case law is very clear that the state can&#39;t dictate the manner of<br/>
&gt; education so unschooling is very easy in MA.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s been a good summary of the two Mass homeschooling points of view<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the case and why the Bryants aren&#39;t being backed universally by<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers in MA on the MHLA email list. (The second list has had many<br/>
&gt; ongoing discussions about it and others.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; masshomelearningassoc at Yahoo Groups (supposedly the MHLA list for<br/>
&gt; nonpolitical homeschooling discussions but a good summary)<br/>
&gt; MAhomeschoolers at Yahoo Groups (the MHLA list for political talk)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whether the Bryants have helped the homeschooling atmosphere in Mass as<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; claim, or hindered as MHLA claims, apparently no real changes can happen<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; the foundation of the changes keeps coming back to the argument of whether<br/>
&gt; to work with what is there (compulsory attendance laws and others) or<br/>
&gt; whether that&#39;s ridiculous because the laws are unconstitutional. :-/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The scary/sad part is the DSS involvement in what is by-the-legal-book<br/>
&gt; educational neglect and therefore child neglect, but which doesn&#39;t match<br/>
&gt; reality since the kids are clearly being well educated. (They probably<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; a lot more about law than a lot of lawyers!)<br/>

&gt; Thanks for posting that link, Lynda. I&#39;d planned on forwarding it<br/>
&gt; myself, as I believe this case is an important one, raising some<br/>
&gt; critical questions which we as homeschoolers should be seriously<br/>
&gt; thinking about and discussing. Anyone interested in this case might<br/>
&gt; be interested in joining the NHEN-Legislative list and reading the<br/>
&gt; last three days&#39; archives for an in-depth discussion of the case and<br/>
&gt; the issues it brings up:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There aren&#39;t any laws specifically about homeschooling in MA. There is a<br/>
reference in, I think, the compulsory attendance law, to private school or<br/>
being &quot;otherwise educated&quot;. All homeschooling requirements are based on The<br/>
Care and Protection of Charles, a court case which, sometimes ambiguously,<br/>
describes what&#39;s required of parents and the scope of the superintendent&#39;s<br/>
involvement.<br/>
<br/>
The judge ruled in the Charles case that parents are required to submit an<br/>
education plan. Then in a different part of his ruling -- if I&#39;m recalling<br/>
the order of the statements correctly -- says if the superintendent/school<br/>
committee disapproves of the plan, the family can continue to homeschool<br/>
while the super/SC works on proving that the plan is inadequate. It never<br/>
says that submitting a plan is all that&#39;s needed to begin homeschooling, but<br/>
it certainly implies that.<br/>

in the case law is a requirement to submit an education plan.<br/>
<br/>
No one really wants to overturn Charles because, when interpretted<br/>
&quot;properly&quot; ;-) and the state homeschooling group is working on a set of<br/>
guidelines for superintendents, it&#39;s pretty homeschooling (and<br/>
*unschooling*!) friendly.<br/>
