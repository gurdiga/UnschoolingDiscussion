<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021577523">Hi There All!<br/>
My name is Allison and I&#39;m new to the idea of homeschooling.  We just <br/>
recently (December) pulled our 6-year-old son, Ryland, out of public <br/>
school and placed him in a charter school program that combines <br/>
traditional class time, called workshops, and homeschooling.  <br/>
Workshops are Mon. and Wed. I homeschool the other three days.  The <br/>
charter school provides everything including the schedule of <br/>
learning, which is very academic!  <br/>
<br/>
At first, I thought this was all great.  We were so glad to get Ry <br/>
out of the program he was in and his learning really took off with me <br/>
having more input in his day.  But, as I&#39;m sure you already know, it <br/>
is still a struggle.  <br/>
<br/>
Ryland has always wanted to be homeschooled and I have resisted.  <br/>
Didn&#39;t think I could do it, wasn&#39;t sure I believed in it, etc.  <br/>
You&#39;ve heard it all.  But, from the first day Ry was home, I was <br/>
hooked!  But, the struggle was stil there.  It wasn&#39;t until just two <br/>
weeks ago I stumbled across Home Ed Magazine and the whole concept of <br/>
unschooling.  I was stunned!  For six years now I have prided myself <br/>
for parenting Ryland using what I call &quot;intuitive parenting&quot;, which <br/>
really means child directed.  I have breastfed on demand and let him <br/>
decide when he was ready to stop.  I didn&#39;t potty-train Ryland, I <br/>
just gently guided him until he decided he was ready.  I didn&#39;t teach <br/>
Ryland how to tie his shoes until he asked and then he learned in one <br/>
day.  The list goes on and on.  So, you can understand how my heart <br/>
began to ache as I realized that I wasn&#39;t homeschooling in the same <br/>
way I was parenting.  <br/>
<br/>
I have talked to my husband about how I feel and mentioned the <br/>
concept of unschooling.  That went over like a lead balloon!  :-)  <br/>
But, a year ago he wouldn&#39;t have imagined that we would be <br/>
homeschooling and he loves it now!  He says he&#39;ll fight me every step <br/>
of the way when I say I want to homeschool on our own, not using a <br/>
curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
So where do I go from here?  I need information.  I need anecdotal <br/>
(sp?) evidence.  I need direction.<br/>
<br/>
Have others felt strongly about unschooling and felt resistance from <br/>
their husbands?  What does a typical (if there is such a thing)<br/>
unschooling day look like for all of you?  How do you let go of the <br/>
strong messages from friends, family, society that traditional <br/>
schooling is the only way to produce a functioning human being?  Are <br/>
there any statistics on unschooling?  My husband loves proof that it <br/>
will all turn out o.k.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never struggled this much with anything else since having <br/>
Ryland.  This is much harder to follow my heart than staying home <br/>
fulltime.  I thought there was very little support out there in the <br/>
world for stay-at-home-moms.  But, it seems like nothing compared to <br/>
the lack of support and understanding I sense there is for <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve made it to the end of this letter, I&#39;d love to hear your <br/>
thoughts.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Allison</div>

There are lots of us--we are our own support.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing you could do would be to get your husband to a conference <br/>
where unschoolers are speaking.  If that&#39;s impossible, at least get books.  <br/>
The Homeschool Book of Answers is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435810047"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Resistance from a husband?
<br>
<br>Does resistance from a former husband count?
<br>
<br>This is my first year of homeschooling two of my four children, ages 6 &amp; 8. &nbsp;
<br>My 10 year old daughter is in a traditional public school (which she loves) 
<br>getting what seems to be a spotty education at best. &nbsp;My 12 year old son is 
<br>in an out-of-district placement for his autism &amp; ADHD.
<br>
<br>My homeschooled daughters have been a delight to work with, but I cannot 
<br>begin to tell you the opposition we have met at every turn in the road from 
<br>their father for reasons that are unclear. &nbsp;Both girls are very bright (CORE 
<br>testing before leaving school to get all the testing information in order) 
<br>and I had every expectation of following a regular curriculum (Oak Meadow -- 
<br>very Waldorf). &nbsp;However, as the year has evolved, we&#39;re clearly becoming 
<br>unschoolers. &nbsp;At this point in time, it is what is working best for my 
<br>daughters and they are once again excited about learning. &nbsp;I love it and have 
<br>learned so much.
<br>
<br>I think one of the biggest problems with unschooling is THE TERM UNSCHOOLING. 
<br>&nbsp;It connotes such a laid back, insubstantial, hippy-kind of view of education 
<br>that it scares alot of people. &nbsp;In many ways, I think the term is unfortunate 
<br>and wish it could change. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I am constantly telling their dad all manner of things they&#39;ve done and 
<br>achieved -- &nbsp;but he wants to see workbooks! And on and on it goes...
<br>
<br>My homeschooled daughters are definitely doing better than my public school 
<br>5th grader who is becoming increasingly conflicted about not being 
<br>homeschooled. I&#39;d love for her to be home, but I want her to make the 
<br>decision at this point.
<br>
<br>I cannot give you answers, but I certainly understand what you are saying. &nbsp;
<br>You aren&#39;t alone.
<br>
<br>Good luck...and keep us posted.

  is THE TERM<br>UNSCHOOLING.<br>&gt;&nbsp; It connotes such a laid back,

  term &quot;unschooling&quot; and usually<br>only use it as a sort of shorthand with 
  people who are already calling<br>themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot;. To people in the 
  outside world :-), I use the term<br>&quot;child-led learning&quot; because to me that 
  connotes more of what we are doing.<br>For one thing, usually when you &quot;un&quot; 
  something, you have to have done it<br>first. To &quot;undo&quot;, you first have to 
  &quot;do&quot;, to &quot;untie&quot; you first have to<br>&quot;tie&quot;. We&#39;re not unschooling anything. 
  My kids have never been in a school,<br>not even a pre-school, and will not be 
  until they choose to do so. So<br>there&#39;s nothing there to &quot;un&quot;do. &quot;Un&quot; also 
  implies somehow a reduction to<br>me, an undoing, a lessening, not a 
  confident, spirited, and thoughtful<br>moving forward which is more of what I 
  feel we are doing.<br><br>As for it scaring people, I think maybe that&#39;s part 
  of the point. It&#39;s an<br>in-your-face kind of a term, something to make people 
  sit up and take<br>notice. In that sense, it can be a double-edged sword. It 
  can be great to<br>open people&#39;s eyes and minds to the other possibilities of 
  education. OTOH,<br>when it&#39;s someone like a CPS person listening, the term is

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Wow, good questions! Many I have struggled with. Is 
unschooling what Ryland was asking you for in the first place? When you talked 
to your hubby how did you present it? Does he think you will be doing nothing 
all day long? Is Ryland reading already?&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">When we started homeschooling,&nbsp;I chose 
different materials and tailored the curriculum to my children, by what I 
perceived as their needs. Dad approved, but it was a very rough year.&nbsp;We 
have homeschooled since 97. This year we sort of fell into unschooling. I 
haven&#39;t even defined the concept to my husband, but he sees their growth. The 
child that has the hardest time is the one that spent many years in public 
school.She is&nbsp;very dependent on someone telling her what to do 
academically. My nine&nbsp;year old has only known a half year of&nbsp;public 
school because of a big move (over 1000 miles and twice in six&nbsp;months) He 
thrives on&nbsp;unschooling.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Does your husband feel a standard curriculum 
guarantees results? </font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">How many children fail 
school or drop out? Did you feel satisfied with your school experience when you 
were growing up? there are many examples of people with unconventional schooling 
experiences who excelled. Thomas Edison is one who comes to mind. In response to 
public school&nbsp;being the only way to produce a functioning human being, what 
did the world do prior to 1830 when there were no public schools? Was everyone 
illiterate? </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have you read any books on unschooling? I just finished <u>Teach Your Own 
</u>by John Holt. It is an excellent book! I found it at our local library.  
Other books are <u>The Unschooling handbook </u>by Mary Griffith,great guide to 
the current unschooling movement. &nbsp;<u>Going Home to School </u>by Llewellyn 
B. Davis, an excellent resource to help others to see what you now understand is 
best for your child and why. She does have a Christian worldview. <u>Dumbing Us 
Down </u>by John Taylor Gatto&nbsp; a former teacher of the year who shows what 
lessons the public schools really teach. <u>Homeschooling for Excellence </u>by 
David and Micki Colfax. They unschooled four sons who eventually received 
scholarships to Ivy League schools. <u>The Successful Homeschool Family Handbook 
</u>by Raymond and Dorothy Moore, pioneers in the homeschooling movement. maybe 
if your husband reads some of these, he will see things differently.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;This group is an excellent source of support because we all share the 
vision of child directed learning. Personally,&nbsp;being involved in this group 
has empowered me to stand firm in what I felt was best for my children and 
family.My mother in law thinks I&#39;m nuts. Countless people&nbsp;have told me 
&quot;send them to school, you will have a break all day&quot;. I want to be with my 
children! When your spirit screams NO, you need to listen.&nbsp; Your family and 
peers trust you to do what is best in raising your children in other issues. 
Sometimes they need to see the &quot;proof&quot; before they will agree. some may never 
approve and you need to accept that.&nbsp; </div>

strong messages from friends, family, society that traditional <br/>
schooling is the only way to produce a functioning human being?  <br/>
<br/>
I am having a hard time letting go of this.  There are too many reminders<br/>
in my face that what I am doing is not the norm.  Sometimes I wonder if I<br/>
am the crazy one.  As my kids grow and demonstrate learning, it does get<br/>
easier though.  I feel better when I get lots of support for myself. <br/>
Growing Without Schooling, Home Education Magazine, any and all books on<br/>
unschooling and some on homeschooling, this list, all are very helpful to<br/>
me.  As far as family or friends go, I tend to tell them the things that<br/>
sound &quot;educational&quot;, and just not mention the rest.  OTH, as I go farther<br/>
down the path I am feeling more comfortable telling my mom (the only one<br/>
who really asks - and she LOVES my dds sooo much), some of my ideas about<br/>
why I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing.  Also, if your child is young, I find Dr.<br/>
Raymond Moore&#39;s ideas of delayed education very convincing.  (Homegrown<br/>
Kids, or something like that?  What DID he write?  I don&#39;t really like<br/>
all of his ideas, BUT DO like the delayed academics part.)  So, you can<br/>
tell family about the advantages of delaying formal academics until 10 or<br/>
12.  By then, they will be so impressed with your son that they won&#39;t<br/>
worry so much about the details.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719296518">I know that when I first started talking about homeschooling, my husband<br/>
didn&#39;t say No, but wasn&#39;t sure.  He had doubts.  (so did I)  I did alot<br/>
of reading...ALOT!  He read nothing.  Every once in awhile he will read<br/>
something I ask him to (an article, never a book)  This is fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
His turning point was when we had some homeschooled all the way through<br/>
kids over for dinner.  They were in the late teens then.  A brother and<br/>
sister.  He was so impressed by them....  They were not your typical<br/>
teenagers with alot of &quot;hang ups&quot;.  After that, he was really much less<br/>
doubtful with the whole thing<br/>
Maybe if your husband could meet some homeschool families...see their<br/>
kids, even if they are young.  That is a big boost.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244596515">Allison--HI--I was that many good books were recommended. I just wanted to <br/>
add &quot;Learning All The Time&quot; by John Holt. When we decided to homeschool I <br/>
read a couple of Homeschooling books and they were informative. I heard John <br/>
Holt&#39;s name mentioned repeatedly at a La Leche League conference and again at <br/>
Unschooling.com. I checked this book out of the library one morning and <br/>
finished it that night. It was excellent! It totally changed my outlook on <br/>
the learning process.<br/>
I just started &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; also. <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck! My husband is very supportive of the idea----but the rest of the <br/>
family still thinks I&#39;m crazy so I know somewhat how you feel! :)Merri</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547009073"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">This is such a good question! &nbsp;I so fully embrace the concept of 
<br>&quot;de-schooling,&quot; which has been essential for my 8 year old daughter who 
<br>absolutely &quot;hated&quot; school by the end of 2nd grade. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think everyone 
<br>understands what is going on with our children who have already experienced 
<br>public school in such a negative way, but for my daughter Jillian, 
<br>de-schooling is what has been necessary and has indeed occurred. &nbsp;I never 
<br>heard the term before a month or so ago, but it fits and its works. 
<br>Unschooling was how it happened.
<br>
<br>My happy 1st grader, Hayley, surprised me in wanting to homeschool and is now 
<br>saying she is &quot;having the time of my life&quot; (I love this at age 7!!!) despite 
<br>the fact that her public school kindergarten was fine for her.
<br>
<br>So, where are we?
<br>
<br>Maybe (I&#39;m thinking out loud) people think that &quot;unschooling&quot; means 
<br>&quot;unlearning&quot; or not learning or something similar. &nbsp;I did, however, love the 
<br>question about drinking &quot;uncola while you unschool!&quot; I think that&#39;s part of 
<br>the problem: what does it mean? That was a great question and, for me, got to 
<br>the heart of the semantic issue: &nbsp;WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
<br>
<br>I know it means something different for every family and every child, as it 
<br>should. &nbsp;I know it isn&#39;t about watching television or not, or being a 
<br>vegetarian or not. &nbsp;It isn&#39;t about Christian education or any other. It is an 
<br>approach to learning that might be appropriate for Christians and 
<br>non-Christians, vegetarians and meat eaters, TV addicts, PBS only people or 
<br>I-don&#39;t-own-a-televison people. &nbsp;It absolutely is non judgmental. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>BUT WHAT IS THE CORRECT TERM?
<br>
<br>I think this matters very little to those of us who are doing what we do and 
<br>believe in it and want to do what is best for our individual children. &nbsp;
<br>However, most of us probably have friends or relatives or someone asking very 
<br>legitimate and curious questions about how our children are learning. &nbsp;Do we 
<br>just ignore their questions?
<br>
<br>I am very, very interested in the ideas of others who have tried to explain 
<br>how their children are learning and how you are facilitating that process.
<br>
<br>I am not questioning anyone&#39;s approach or style or beliefs in any way. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I guess I am asking how we can best articulate what we are doing, what our 
<br>children are doing and what we are trying to achieve together.
<br>
<br>This is an extraordinary group!!!!

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally don&#39;t care a whole lot for the term &quot;unschooling&quot; and usually<br/>
only use it as a sort of shorthand with people who are already calling<br/>
themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot;. To people in the outside world :-), I use the term<br/>
&quot;child-led learning&quot; because to me that connotes more of what we are doing.<br/>
For one thing, usually when you &quot;un&quot; something, you have to have done it<br/>
first. To &quot;undo&quot;, you first have to &quot;do&quot;, to &quot;untie&quot; you first have to<br/>
&quot;tie&quot;. We&#39;re not unschooling anything. My kids have never been in a school,<br/>
not even a pre-school, and will not be until they choose to do so. So<br/>
there&#39;s nothing there to &quot;un&quot;do. &quot;Un&quot; also implies somehow a reduction to<br/>
me, an undoing, a lessening, not a confident, spirited, and thoughtful<br/>
moving forward which is more of what I feel we are doing.<br/>
<br/>
As for it scaring people, I think maybe that&#39;s part of the point. It&#39;s an<br/>
in-your-face kind of a term, something to make people sit up and take<br/>
notice. In that sense, it can be a double-edged sword. It can be great to<br/>
open people&#39;s eyes and minds to the other possibilities of education. OTOH,<br/>
when it&#39;s someone like a CPS person listening, the term is probably not<br/>
going to be to your advantage, sadly enough.<br/>
<br/>
Myself, I&#39;ve been so radical about so many things for so many years that<br/>
I&#39;ve largely given up caring what anyone thinks of anything I do. :-)<br/>

if we&#39;re talking about children) &#39;you teach them yourself?&#39; which is <br/>
the first question I get when I tell folk that they don&#39;t go to school (I <br/>
know, don&#39;t take me there :-) ) I say, &#39;not exactly, I don&#39;t teach, I <br/>
help them learn.&#39;  (I even get variants on this from people who <br/>
phone me about the local HE meeting, usually &#39;how do you teach <br/>
them?&#39;)  Atm that&#39;s fine, cos most of the people I&#39;m talking to can <br/>
relate when I go on about how they learn before they go to school, <br/>
do we teach our children to walk, or do they learn &#39;by themselves?&#39;  <br/>
It&#39;s neither of course, they learn by a mixture of watching what <br/>
everyone else does and encouragement, and developing the <br/>
physical skills...  Whether it will make a difference when I&#39;m talking <br/>
to parents of older children (if mine are that bit older I can envisage <br/>
this more) I don&#39;t know, but I think it&#39;s something most people can <br/>
relate to, what children did before they went to school.<br/>

<br/>
It might be wise to acknowledge to him that this IS a mutual decision, and<br/>
YES you will work it out together.  You aren&#39;t just going to hi-jack the<br/>
decision and make it unilateraly.  (I would hope that once you offer him<br/>
this degree of courteous respect, he would return it to you.)<br/>
<br/>
::: aside :::  (And yet, I was shrieking at my husband in the car last<br/>
night, (about other subjects) so there&#39;s certainly a big dollop of<br/>
two-facedness in what I&#39;m saying.)  (I guess I&#39;ll try harder to take my own<br/>
advice.)<br/>
<br/>
I would want to be able to ask your husband WHY he believes using<br/>
curriculum leads to learning.  My brother told me that my son should go to<br/>
preschool.  I asked him why and he said &quot;well, I did, and I turned out<br/>
fine&quot;. That&#39;s not exactly the same as a longitudinal study showing that<br/>
kids who go to preschool turn out to be happier, wealthier or more demure. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  Logic like my brothers can also be used to support ritual mutilation<br/>
and scarification.<br/>
<br/>
(Apologies to those of you who are eating breakfast while reading your<br/>
mail.)<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s book, _The Schools Our Children Deserve_ has some good<br/>
insights (based on research, with footnotes) about why hands-on,<br/>
interest-driven learning is best for children.  If your husband doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to read the whole book, maybe just Appendix A would be persuasive.<br/>
<br/>
My belief is that many men are &quot;stoic&quot; about their school experiences. <br/>
They won&#39;t admit how much those experiences hurt.  Perhaps they even think<br/>
that the pain was necessary and &quot;worth it&quot;.  So, getting your dh to discuss<br/>
his school days with you, and tell you what he remembers that was great and<br/>
what he remembers that was lousy, can be a useful starting place.<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Billy -- I printed that. It&#39;s wonderful. At my son&#39;s soccer game last <br/>
week, one of his friends from last year&#39;s team ran up to see when Jesse could <br/>
come play. &quot;When does he have Spring Break?&quot; Ben asked. We told him we <br/>
thought he knew Jesse was homeschooled. &quot;Oh, I know, I am too!&quot; he said, &quot;My <br/>
mom is giving me a week off for Spring Break! When is Jesse off?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband looked at me and grinned and said, &quot;Our whole family is &quot;off&quot; all <br/>
the time.&quot; I was left to explain to Ben that Jesse would give him a call. :)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have to determine how much people really want to know when they <br/>
ask, and what my motives for telling them are. When I explain too much, my <br/>
daughter HAS said, &quot;Mom, they don&#39;t really want to know.&quot; <br/>

We were all TOLD that--<br/>
<br/>
--you HAVE to go to school.<br/>
--it&#39;s good for you.<br/>
--we did it (parents, grandparents, etc.).<br/>
--otherwise you can&#39;t get a job.<br/>
--you wouldn&#39;t have any friends if you didn&#39;t go to school.<br/>
--everybody goes to school.<br/>
<br/>
That last piece of propaganda was hammered home in the most unlikely (and <br/>
unfair) ways.  We have an old children&#39;s series, and I was reading a story to <br/>
Holly, her request, her choice of story.  It was about the boy Jesus staying <br/>
behind in the temple in Jerusalem.  No problem, I thought--fine story.   <br/>
<br/>
WRONG!<br/>
<br/>
It was written as a school propaganda, obey your parents story.  <br/>
<br/>
The families were on a school trip, basically; it says Jesus had to go to <br/>
school just like you do.<br/>
<br/>
And when he was discovered missing his parents went and got him and he was a <br/>
bad boy to have stayed.<br/>
<br/>
None of the all-light-and-glory &quot;Can&#39;t you see  must do my father&#39;s business.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So it wasn&#39;t just school itself that told people throughout the 20th century <br/>
that school was right and good and natural, and the absence of it was heathen <br/>
and ignorant and unthinkable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27027167">Hi Johanna,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you and everyone else for all their wonderful responses to <br/>
my request!  I&#39;m still working my way through them all and I&#39;m really <br/>
enjoying them.  As I read all your thoughts, I&#39;m getting more <br/>
comfortable with the idea of defining with my son what &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
means to us.  He&#39;s a very wise 6-year-old and I&#39;ve always been able <br/>
to include him in the process of decision-making.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, to answer specifically a few of your questions.<br/>
<br/>
You asked, &quot;Is Unschooling what Ryland was asking you for in the <br/>
first place?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ryland has wanted to be homeschooled since he could talk.  I was <br/>
always resistant, wasn&#39;t something I thought I wanted to do or would <br/>
be good at.  Since we&#39;ve been home in this modified program, I&#39;ve <br/>
discovered just how good I am at it and how much more I want of it.  <br/>
Ryland has said he wants to be home all the time and I believe him.  <br/>
As far as &quot;unschooling&quot;, I&#39;m not sure either of us has defined it <br/>
well enough to say we want it.  Although, like I said in my original <br/>
letter, I have parented Ryland in a way that makes unschooling seem <br/>
to be a natural progression.<br/>
<br/>
You asked, &quot;Does he think he&#39;ll be doing nothing all day long?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At this point, since Ryland was in public school for 1 1/2 years and <br/>
is still now in workshops two days a week, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ready <br/>
for absolutely no structure.  I would have to wean him from it.  But, <br/>
to some degree, I&#39;m realizing that Ryland likes structure.  He is a <br/>
rule-follower just like mom!  So, as I begin to define unschooling in <br/>
our lives, I believe that it will include structure, but structure <br/>
that Ry and I define, not others.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
You asked, &quot;Does your husband feel a standard curriculum guarantees <br/>
results?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes! At the same time we were making the decision to take <br/>
Ry out of public school, my husband made the decision to return to <br/>
school to get his teaching credential.  He currently owns a record <br/>
store (24+ years) and is looking for a change.  What perfection that <br/>
we are moving out of the school system and into it simultaneously.  <br/>
We actually know a couple male ps teachers whose wives homeshcool <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
You asked, &quot;Did you feel satisfied with your school experience when <br/>
you were growing up?<br/>
<br/>
At the time, yes.  Looking back, no.  What school did provide for me <br/>
was the stability and predictability that I desprately needed as a <br/>
child.  There was a lot of chaos in my home and I can&#39;t imagine not <br/>
having school to go to.  But, where I believe the school did fail me <br/>
was especially in their approach to math.  At that time, they didn&#39;t <br/>
teach concepts, they taught &quot;how&quot; to do math.  It wasn&#39;t until <br/>
adulthood when I began using math in my own work that I discovered <br/>
that I&#39;m reeeeeally good at math.  I wish I&#39;d known it sooner.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your thoughtful response.  I look forward to getting <br/>
to know you all.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

I really like your suggestion about getting my husband to talk about <br/>
his school days.  If nothing else, it will give ME insight into what <br/>
motivates him.  Possibly it will give him insight, as well.<br/>
<br/>
As far as letting him know that this is not a decision I will make <br/>
unilaterally, he knows that.  Actually, when he made the comment that <br/>
he would fight it every step of the way, my response was, &quot;Well, you <br/>
can do that.  But right now, I&#39;m just getting information.  You might <br/>
want to wait until we&#39;re actually making a decision about all this.  <br/>
Otherwise, it seems like a lot of wasted energy.&quot;  That seemed to <br/>
settle him down.  He&#39;s still absolutely sure he doesn&#39;t even want us <br/>
to homeschool fulltime, but he&#39;s also listening whole-heartedly to my <br/>
concerns and offering constructive suggestions how to fix things from <br/>
within.  By being open to his suggestions and trying them with an <br/>
open mind, I hope that it opens his mind to new ideas too.  How can I <br/>
expect him to have an open mind if I am acting like a runaway train, <br/>
plowing through all his ideas like clueless cows on the tracks!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I felt panicky the day I wrote &quot;I need direction&quot; and I still want <br/>
things to change.  But, now I&#39;m remembering that this is all a <br/>
process and we&#39;ll get where we need to be.  Since my son was born 6 <br/>
years ago, my husband and I have found ourselves doing sooooo many <br/>
things that we said we would never do.  Time will tell.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all of you for your loving and thoughtful responses.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061789664">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not what I&#39;ve gotten out of that story in the bible.  In fact, <br/>
it is one of my favorites, Luke 2:41-52.  This is my interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus and his family were traveling to Jerusalem for the Passover <br/>
festival.  When they left to return to Nazareth, Jesus&#39; family didn&#39;t <br/>
realize immediately that he was missing.  It was most likely that he <br/>
was old enough to travel in a separate part of the group now and that <br/>
explains why it took them so long to realize he was missing.  Once <br/>
they realized he was missing, it took them three days to discover him <br/>
in Jerusalem studying among the religious teachers, discussing deep <br/>
questions with them.  Mary was beside herself when she discovered <br/>
that Jesus was not traveling home with the group.  Mary wasn&#39;t as <br/>
upset that he stayed behind as she was that he hadn&#39;t communicated <br/>
his decision.  She was terrified that she had lost her child, the Son <br/>
of G-d that had been put into her charge by G-d.  Seems a pretty <br/>
reasonable reaction to say, &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;  Then, the <br/>
story continues that Jesuse returned to Nazareth with his parents and <br/>
was obedient to them.  What this means to me is that, even though <br/>
Jesus was the Son of G-d, he was still a human child that needed <br/>
guidance and structure to ensure he would fulfill His purpose.  I&#39;m <br/>
not sure how this fits into society&#39;s propaganda about schooling.  <br/>
Although, if Mary had been more sensitive, she would&#39;ve realized that <br/>
Jesus was where he really belonged.  He actually belonged in &quot;school&quot; <br/>
(the temple is where lessons were taught) and his parents were the <br/>
ones pulling him out.  Maybe, it would&#39;ve been better for them to <br/>
move to Jerusalem so that Jesus could continue his studies with the <br/>
great teachers who were quickly becoming his peers.  Also, it is my <br/>
understanding that Mary was well-informed in Jewish law and tradition <br/>
and was an important part of Jesus&#39; knowledge of Judaism.  It seems <br/>
that the perfect solution would&#39;ve been to combine those two <br/>
resources so that Jesus would&#39;ve gotten the best of both worlds.  :-)<br/>

&gt; behind in the temple in Jerusalem.  No problem, I thought--fine <br/>
story.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WRONG!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was written as a school propaganda, obey your parents story.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The families were on a school trip, basically; it says Jesus had to <br/>
go to <br/>
&gt; school just like you do.<br/>

he was a <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So it wasn&#39;t just school itself that told people throughout the <br/>
20th century <br/>
&gt; that school was right and good and natural, and the absence of it <br/>
was heathen <br/>
&gt; and ignorant and unthinkable.<br/>

That&#39;s not what I&#39;ve gotten out of that story in the bible.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We weren&#39;t reading the Bible, we were reading a retelling of the story in a <br/>
book from the 1920&#39;s or 1930&#39;s--a series of kids&#39; literature books.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what the Bible says:<br/>
<br/>
[41] Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the <br/>
passover.<br/>
[42] And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the <br/>
custom of the feast.<br/>
[43] And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus <br/>
tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.<br/>
[44] But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day&#39;s <br/>
journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.<br/>
[45] And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, <br/>
seeking him.<br/>
[46] And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, <br/>
sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them <br/>
questions.<br/>
[47] And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.<br/>
[48] And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, <br/>
Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought <br/>
thee sorrowing.<br/>
[49] And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I <br/>
must be about my Father&#39;s business?<br/>
[50] And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.<br/>
[51] And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto <br/>
them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.<br/>
[52] And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and <br/>
man.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What that book I was reading Holly said was that Jesus had to go to school, <br/>
and spoke of the trip to Jerusalem as a field trip.  <br/>

  more I want of it.&nbsp; <br>Ryland has said he wants to be home all the time 
  and I believe him.&nbsp; <br>As far as &quot;unschooling&quot;, I&#39;m not sure either of 
  us has defined it <br>well enough to say we want it.&nbsp; Although, like I 
  said in my original <br>letter, I have parented Ryland in a way that makes 
  unschooling seem <br>to be a natural progression.<br><br>You asked, &quot;Does he 
  think he&#39;ll be doing nothing all day long?&quot;<br><br>At this point, since Ryland 
  was in public school for 1 1/2 years and <br>is still now in workshops two 
  days a week, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ready <br>for absolutely no structure.&nbsp; I 
  would have to wean him from it.&nbsp; But, <br>to some degree, I&#39;m realizing 
  that Ryland likes structure.&nbsp; He is a <br>rule-follower just like 
  mom!&nbsp; So, as I begin to define unschooling in <br>our lives, I believe 
  that it will include structure, but structure <br>that Ry and I define, not 
  others.&nbsp; Does that make sense?<br><br>You asked, &quot;Does your husband feel 
  a standard curriculum guarantees <br>results?&quot;<br><br>Yes, yes, yes! At the 
  same time we were making the decision to take <br>Ry out of public school, my 
  husband made the decision to return to <br>school to get his teaching 
  credential.&nbsp; He currently owns a record <br>store (24+ years) and is 
  looking for a change.&nbsp; What perfection that <br>we are moving out of the 
  school system and into it simultaneously.&nbsp; <br>We actually know a couple 
  male ps teachers whose wives homeshcool <br>their children.<br><br>You asked, 
  &quot;Did you feel satisfied with your school experience when <br>you were growing 
  up?<br><br>At the time, yes.&nbsp; Looking back, no.&nbsp; What school did 
  provide for me <br>was the stability and predictability that I desprately 
  needed as a <br>child.&nbsp; There was a lot of chaos in my home and I can&#39;t 
  imagine not <br>having school to go to.&nbsp; But, where I believe the school 
  did fail me <br>was especially in their approach to math.&nbsp; At that time, 
  they didn&#39;t <br>teach concepts, they taught &quot;how&quot; to do math.&nbsp; It wasn&#39;t 
  until <br>adulthood when I began using math in my own work that I discovered 
  <br>that I&#39;m reeeeeally good at math.&nbsp; I wish I&#39;d known it 
  sooner.<br><br>Thanks again for your thoughtful response.&nbsp; I look forward 
  to getting <br>to know you all.<br><br>Love,<br>Allison<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Message

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591621686">how silly. Jesus had to go to school so you do too. <br/>

&gt; That&#39;s not what I&#39;ve gotten out of that story in the<br/>
&gt; bible.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We weren&#39;t reading the Bible, we were reading a<br/>
&gt; retelling of the story in a <br/>
&gt; book from the 1920&#39;s or 1930&#39;s--a series of kids&#39;<br/>
&gt; literature books.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s what the Bible says:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [41] Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at<br/>
&gt; the feast of the <br/>
&gt; passover.<br/>
&gt; [42] And when he was twelve years old, they went up<br/>
&gt; to Jerusalem after the <br/>
&gt; custom of the feast.<br/>
&gt; [43] And when they had fulfilled the days, as they<br/>
&gt; returned, the child Jesus <br/>
&gt; tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his<br/>
&gt; mother knew not of it.<br/>
&gt; [44] But they, supposing him to have been in the<br/>
&gt; company, went a day&#39;s <br/>
&gt; journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk<br/>
&gt; and acquaintance.<br/>
&gt; [45] And when they found him not, they turned back<br/>
&gt; again to Jerusalem, <br/>
&gt; seeking him.<br/>
&gt; [46] And it came to pass, that after three days they<br/>
&gt; found him in the temple, <br/>
&gt; sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing<br/>
&gt; them, and asking them <br/>
&gt; questions.<br/>
&gt; [47] And all that heard him were astonished at his<br/>
&gt; understanding and answers.<br/>
&gt; [48] And when they saw him, they were amazed: and<br/>
&gt; his mother said unto him, <br/>
&gt; Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy<br/>
&gt; father and I have sought <br/>
&gt; thee sorrowing.<br/>
&gt; [49] And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought<br/>
&gt; me? wist ye not that I <br/>
&gt; must be about my Father&#39;s business?<br/>
&gt; [50] And they understood not the saying which he<br/>
&gt; spake unto them.<br/>
&gt; [51] And he went down with them, and came to<br/>
&gt; Nazareth, and was subject unto <br/>
&gt; them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her<br/>
&gt; heart.<br/>
&gt; [52] And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and<br/>
&gt; in favour with God and <br/>
&gt; man.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; What that book I was reading Holly said was that<br/>
&gt; Jesus had to go to school, <br/>
&gt; and spoke of the trip to Jerusalem as a field trip. <br/>
