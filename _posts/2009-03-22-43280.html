<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469619770">I am at a loss regarding one of my almost 9 year old twin girls. I pulled them both out of school almost exactly a year ago, near the end of second grade, because they were so unhappy in school, and I was unhappy with school as well. We have loved homeschooling, and almost immediately fell into unschooling. It felt quite natural to me, and certainly enriched our lives. The problem is that one of the girls--incidentally the one who was most unhappy at school--is saying she wants to return to school because she misses her friends. We have two former classmates that live on the street that we play with regularly, and I try to organize playdates with a few other girls as well. We also belong to brownies, so they see friends there, and pony club, where they have a second set of friends. I&#39;m also planning to join a local unschooling group (had gone once before, and had a nice time, but didn&#39;t go back mainly because we&#39;re so busy doing things and going places, and the girls didn&#39;t seem all that gung ho to return)<br/>
     Has anyone else had a child requesting a return to school and if so how did you deal with it? I&#39;ve told her that if she really wants to go back next year I will support her decision, but I would be so sad to see her actually return to what I feel is a very bad place for her. Any advice?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I think you&#39;ve discovered what you might have changed. If your girls  <br/>
had friends who weren&#39;t in school at all, and if they had examples of  <br/>
other unschooling families in their lives, school could begin to fade  <br/>
into the distance.<br/>

That&#39;s my best idea if she does go to school, but if you can go to a  <br/>
conference between now and then, that might help.  Or if she goes to  <br/>
school, maybe take her out for one of the fall conferences, if there&#39;s  <br/>
any way for you to get to one.    It could make such a huge difference  <br/>
in your lives that even if you had to borrow money to get to one, it  <br/>
might be worth doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250369126">It&#39;s been my experience that when kids have gone to school, come home and then not hooked into a social group apart from school, is when they can end up wanting to go back.  Meeting some new friends to complement their new lives would be a great idea.  If former classmates are who they are playing with, then they are naturally going to feel more and more out of the loop while those girls are connecting during and about school and your daughters aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My own personal opinion is that going to school for friends is kind of a sad reason to want to go, because it has nothing to do with deeper issues of learning, education and inner development.  And sad because it&#39;s usually a preventable reason if mom is willing to do what it takes to help kids create a socail life.  Of course each situation is different, but I do make sure that my kids have plenty of social activities so that this hopefully won&#39;t ever be an issue for us.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it IS a sad reason to want to go, but in a truly unschooling family, I would let her choose to make that decision, right? We live in a town that is centered around the schools, and all the kids on the street (a lot!) that she plays with are in school. Short of moving or forbidding her to play with the neighbors, i can&#39;t avoid that influence. And I go to quite a bit of trouble to have them around other homeschooled kids--an all day homeschool outdoor program once a week, and almost daily visits to our barn (an hour drive round trip)  where they play with another family of homeschoolers who have a horse.  Regular field trips to meet new homeschoolers, pony club events, etc.  (plus girl scouts--their old troop from school days--but they didn&#39;t want to leave it) Not to mention music lessons for two instruments each--I feel like we have almost too many activities, leaving little time to just relax! Hopefully, joining a play group with a larger number of kids will quell her desire to return to school.</div>

<br/>
This might not answer your question exactly but one observation I have  <br/>
that might help in the equation is that some children are more prone  <br/>
to being unhappy than others so it makes sense that the child who was  <br/>
most unhappy in school is also now the one who is unhappy being home  <br/>
(now that she&#39;s used to it).  Her temperament might have more to do  <br/>
with it than her situation.  You may need to help her paint a picture  <br/>
in her mind of what going back to school looks like and remind her of  <br/>
the parts of it that were making her unhappy before.  Helping her find  <br/>
happiness and friends and work she enjoys etc.  may take some time and  <br/>
she may just not realize that it is a process that she has some  <br/>
control over.  Hope that helps a little.<br/>

<br/>
What popped out to me in the above is that maybe some people are more apt to<br/>
become bored in an environment once the newness wears off.  From a parent&#39;s<br/>
perspective, a year may not be a long time to be homeschooling OR going to<br/>
school, but for some people it feels like FOREVER.  I remember how bored I<br/>
got and how grateful I was to see *any* change from the norm.  I&#39;m still<br/>
that way.  Sameness for too long just kills me.  No matter how much I like<br/>
where I am.  It&#39;s hard to explain.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like possibly your &quot;unhappy&quot; daughter is one who craves newness<br/>
and change.  Perhaps there are creative ways to accommodate more newness,<br/>
perhaps even daily or more often than that, into your very busy lives.<br/>
Switch tracks every now and again.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you can&#39;t get to a conference, maybe you could go to a local<br/>
unschooling meetup and strike up some conversation with parents of some<br/>
unschoolers your child/ren likes... and then call or email if your girls<br/>
don&#39;t want to go back to meetups just make plans on the spur of the moment<br/>
to go see a movie or get ice cream or pizza.  Or set up something at home<br/>
and invite local unschoolers over for oh any reason... It&#39;s Spring!.  (I<br/>
hope to do this in the not too distant future myself... it&#39;s been so crazy<br/>
around here.)  It doesn&#39;t have to be about meetups.<br/>
<br/>
I run into lotsa people who prefer sameness more than I do, and I long to<br/>
hop off somewhere else.  I went to some local pond/fountains and ducks with<br/>
Karl ... something a lot of people do everyday but it&#39;s not a regular thing<br/>
for me.  I go to children&#39;s museums but not regularly.  I *do* go to the<br/>
library a lot, and other than librarians I don&#39;t run into the same people<br/>
when I do.  Karl seems to like that too at least for now.<br/>
<br/>
Building a social life takes me a while but I have some really great friends<br/>
from my hopping around ways.  You don&#39;t have to stick with a group if your<br/>
kids don&#39;t want to.  Try spending your social time and money with folks you<br/>
and/or your children click with.<br/>

<br/>
Oh I meant by that ... do you or your girls really like what you&#39;re doing<br/>
with your busy schedules?  Girl Guides... is it simply being there bodily or<br/>
also the stuff they&#39;re doing there?  It doesn&#39;t really matter except that<br/>
only unschooling for a year might mean that nobody has had the kind of time<br/>
it takes to know what they like.  And just going to Girl Guides may be<br/>
filling a space but not very satisfactorily.<br/>
<br/>
What interests are they following?  If you draw a blank, then maybe that&#39;s<br/>
the reason unschooling is looking the same as school at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Do your girls really like the school kids they hang out with or is it<br/>
something to do with their time?<br/>
<br/>
Consider going on short day vacations somewhere you all would like to go...<br/>
the beach (don&#39;t know what you&#39;re close to).<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/moredefinitions">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/moredefinitions</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m quoting the very last one below because I think it&#39;s very much to the<br/>
point for this thread.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s by Sandra Dodd.<br/>
<br/>
===============<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can anyone explain to me &quot;unschooling&quot;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s like &quot;just say no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just say no to school years and school schedules and school expectations,<br/>
school habits and fears and terminology. Just say no to separating the world<br/>
into important and unimportant things, into separating knowledge into math,<br/>
science, history and language arts, with music, art and &quot;PE&quot; set in their<br/>
less important little places.<br/>
<br/>
Most of unschooling has to happen inside the parents. They need to spend<br/>
some time sorting out what is real from what is construct, and what occurs<br/>
in nature from what only occurs in school (and then in the minds of those<br/>
who were told school was real life, school was a kid&#39;s fulltime job, school<br/>
was more important than anything, school would keep them from being<br/>
ignorant, school would make them happy and rich and right).<br/>
It&#39;s what happens after all that school stuff is banished from your life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084903075">Thanks to everyone for their suggestions, they&#39;re very helpful. Re the question, when did we &quot;deschool&quot;, from what I&#39;ve read, I think that&#39;s the process of recovering from the mindset and expectations of school. We did that as far as I could tell from april to august--just chilled, read, talked, went to beach, out to lunch...there really wasn&#39;t any lightning bolt, or huge change in behavior--just relief to be out of school on all our parts. then in august we took 5 weeks, just girls and me, to drive cross country--an absolutely incredible experience. <br/>
     As far as what interests they are following, they are obsessed with animals and the natural world. Hence the outdoor program. We have also acquired geckos, (in addition to dogs, cats, fish, parrots and horses) and will be adding baby chicks and a beehive in May. They can name practically every breed of horse and dog, and where they originated. We watch dog and horse shows whenever we can. Are leaving tomorrow for san diego zoo. Have been whale watching once, (monterey, ca) and will go up to washington state at some point to see the resident orcas which they are very interested in.<br/>
     They love music, and requested the string and piano lessons, and also love musicals and theater, so we do quite a bit of that, they act out plays with their stuffed animals, and make up songs. <br/>
      I&#39;m thinking after reading suggestions, that maybe she is a sort of child that can fall more easily into negative thinking, and maybe I should try to limit time with schoolchildren and focus heavily on developing unschooling relationships. There is a group in  san francisco that looks pretty active, from their website anyway. Thanks again to all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752035505">-=-And I go to quite a bit of trouble to have them around other  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; homeschooled kids--an all day homeschool outdoor program once a week,  <br/>
&gt; and almost daily visits to our barn (an hour drive round trip) where  <br/>
&gt; they play with another family of homeschoolers who have a horse.  <br/>
&gt; Regular field trips to meet new homeschoolers, pony club events, etc.  <br/>
&gt; (plus girl scouts--their old troop from school days--but they didn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; want to leave it) Not to mention music lessons for two instruments  <br/>
&gt; each--I feel like we have almost too many activities, leaving little  <br/>
&gt; time to just relax!-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If they&#39;re eight and have been out of school less than a year, when  <br/>
&gt; was their deschooling?  When was yours?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling won&#39;t really work until after deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  It&#39;s hard to say, because you didn&#39;t say &lt;g&gt;, whether all this activity is at the request of your daughters or not.  I&#39;ve found that my kids--even my very social one--just don&#39;t want all of this running around.  Our deschooling process looked so much more relaxed.  And it also included day long playdates where the mom and I would visit and there was lots of time.  It may not look like that for your family, but if you traded school busyness for other-life busyness, they may not really know the difference.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the true gifts that unschooling has to offer is time and space for breathing, daydreaming, two hour baths in the middle of the day, impromptu teaparties, or just hanging around and seeing what comes up.  And maybe some long, slow playdates with one or two friends at a time with lots of time to make deep connections.  Of course it&#39;s hard to get a picture in a short post, but both of your posts have felt a little whirlwindish with activities.  <br/>
<br/>
Rhetorical question coming:  Is that what your girls really want, or are you thinking they should have all of those activities?  Because there is SOMETHING that isn&#39;t working for them--is it too much activity or too little meaningful connection with friends or with you?<br/>
<br/>
And even if they are truly asking for all of those activities, are they truly being served by them all at the same time?  Maybe choose the most important one or two and then rotate them--just a thought.<br/>

might actually feel exciting to go to school, but if she went back now,<br/>
she&#39;d end up being stuck in a classroom while the sun was shining<br/>
outside.  I always felt very restless at school in the spring time, and<br/>
I&#39;d feel all excited about it in the fall, until the monotony of it set<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also second the idea of going to an unschooling conference!  I can&#39;t<br/>
even begin to tell you how huge this was for my own kids, and our whole<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have a lot of fun activities already, but if you can<br/>
really get involved with your unschooling group, that could really help.<br/>
It&#39;s nice to have friends that are doing the same sorts of things and<br/>
that are available during school hours.  Our experience was/is that<br/>
school at home families tend to be just as unavailable as school<br/>
families, but those unschooling families were and are way more flexible<br/>
in their time and availability.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious too, would both girls go back to school, or just the one?</div>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most of unschooling has to happen inside the parents. They need to spend some time sorting out what is real from what is construct&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have one child who&#39;s only 5.  His dad and I went through so much<br/>
deschooling to get to the point of unschooling, well.... let me just<br/>
say, it was more than *I* expected really.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling long enough and thoroughly enough probably leads to being<br/>
able to unschool.    Some people need more deschooling than others,<br/>
like me and Brian.  We had more stuff to work through that we were<br/>
hanging onto.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that Karl has never been to school a single day.<br/>
<br/>
And yet Brian and I chose to go through all that deschooling to have<br/>
the kind of family life and peace we want.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and by the way, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re finished deschooling.  :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14499380">I am so glade I joined this group!! It seems that everything that is a concern that crosses my mind turns up as question on this group. My in laws do not want me to home school so telling them we are going to unschool I am sure a few more candles were light at church about it. They always tell Lucy (5) that school is fun and she will have friends. So of course she wants to go. For the past couple of weeks I have been reminding her here and there of the things we get go do and stuff we do because she isn&#39;t going to school. And now she tells everyone I am home schooled because I am to smart for it. I am enjoying this group a lot. Thanks Jill in Vegas excuse the typos it is hard to edit on a blackberry.<br/>

Also, interestingly, after I told my daughter who said she wanted to return, that she COULD,(something I&#39;d never told her when she&#39;d say this previously) she mulled it over for a day and then told me she had decided she didn&#39;t want to!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422471066">you&#39;re right--we are way too busy. It&#39;s so hard with all these tempting posts on BAHFT. Re cross country--we stopped at everything! Grand canyon, mount rushmore, mesa verde, wild ponies of assateague. Slept under the stars on a navajo reservation with stray dogs snuggled up on our sleeping bags. We had a loose overall plan, and added or subtracted time depending on how much we liked certain places. (If horseback riding was available, that automatically added time--girls would have been happy RIDING cross country!) and we spent a lot of time with local animals. ie at mount rushmore, we spent maybe 1 hour at the monument, and an entire day looking at prairie dogs and buffalo. I&#39;d love to do it again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407269351">I think we are going to the san diego one in sept. we have baby chicks coming the week of may 25th, and have to be here to pick them up at post office. The resident orcas are there all the time--they are very different from the ones that migrate. (I just learned this!)<br/>

I brought that here because I didn&#39;t know what this meant:  &quot; It&#39;s so  <br/>
hard with all these tempting posts on BAHFT.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is another reminder that the list is international.  Keep local  <br/>
discussions and local references to a minimum.  For the benefit of the  <br/>
very-many readers all over the world, try to phrase things in terms of  <br/>
the principles and ideas, not the local particulars.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482120469">-=-. They always tell Lucy (5) that school is fun and she will have  <br/>
friends. So of course she wants to go. For the past couple of weeks I  <br/>
have been reminding her here and there of the things we get go do and  <br/>
stuff we do because she isn&#39;t going to school-=-<br/>
<br/>
It might be good for all concerned if you treat this as something  <br/>
you&#39;re going to try for a year or two.  Then make that year count.   <br/>
Make it so peaceful and fun that Lucy doesn&#39;t want to go to school the  <br/>
year after that, but keep the possibility open that if it&#39;s not going  <br/>
well, she might go to school the year after that.  Then make sure it  <br/>
goes well.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And now she tells everyone I am home schooled because I am to smart  <br/>
for it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Try to nip that talk in the bud if you can.   Labels like that hurt  <br/>
everyone involved.   The idea that you want to be with her more might  <br/>
be a good focus if she needs &quot;a reason&quot; to be home, or that you want  <br/>
to let her do things in special ways and not have to wait for 20 other  <br/>
kids to do it their own way before she goes on to something fun.  Or  <br/>
that you&#39;d like to let her sleep as long as she wants to and eat when  <br/>
she wants to.  Kids in school don&#39;t have that.<br/>

Oh and by the way, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re finished deschooling. :D-=-<br/>
<br/>
It took me many years, and I still tweak my clarity.  I think it&#39;s  <br/>
clear and I find some fog.  But not it&#39;s a fogginess and not huge  <br/>
lumps of  opaque ideas I can&#39;t even see through, as it was when I was  <br/>
so schoolbound.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I studied school reformers in college and was determined  <br/>
to change the world of school, I still was coming at it from a &quot;school  <br/>
is vital&quot; position.  That sounds like a simple change to make, but it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t as simple as it sounds.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my early writings use words and phrases I don&#39;t use anymore.   <br/>
I was still deschooling even after I was writing about it for  <br/>
publication.<br/>
