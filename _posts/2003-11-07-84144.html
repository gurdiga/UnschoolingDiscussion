<h4>Scott Bieser</h4>
<p><small><time> 7 Nov 2003, at  4:30pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-581372220">As usual, I seem to have waded into the discussion here without properly <br/>
introducing myself.<br/>
<br/>
I am Scott Bieser and I have been homeschooling my elder son Zeke, age 13, <br/>
for a little more than three years, and my younger son Ian, age 7, for <br/>
about a year and a half. Zeke went to government school until 2/3 of the <br/>
way through third grade, and Ian made it nearly that far through the 1st <br/>
grade before I &quot;liberated&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
I adopted libertarianism as my political philosophy more than a quarter <br/>
century ago, and homeschooling is very much in line with libertarian <br/>
principles. However, there is often a gap between theory and practice.<br/>
<br/>
The main reasons I had not homeschooled Zeke from the beginning were that, <br/>
in the first place, both my wife and I had full-time jobs located several <br/>
miles from home (mine was roughly 50 miles away); and in the second place, <br/>
my wife, &quot;EJ,&quot; is the daughter of two government school career teachers and <br/>
was not at all sympathetic to the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Zeke is a bright lad but had continuing &quot;anger management&quot; and disciplinary <br/>
issues from Kindergarten on. Eventually things came to a head when he was <br/>
in third grade -- I won&#39;t relate the details here in the interests of his <br/>
privacy, but &quot;the blow-up&quot; resulted in unwanted visits by police and a <br/>
Child Protective Services thug which were traumatic enough for us that my <br/>
wife agreed to let me homeschool Zeke. (Up until that time Zeke used his <br/>
first name, &quot;Sean.&quot; After then, wanting a clean break from the past I <br/>
suppose, he started using the short form of his middle name, Ezekiel.)<br/>
<br/>
We worked it through the baby-sitters for a while, trying the <br/>
&quot;school-at-home&quot; approach. It didn&#39;t work very well, but things changed <br/>
when I was laid off from my job. I have since started a home-based <br/>
business, which allows me to deal with the job directly.<br/>
<br/>
But my wife thought of Zeke as a special case, and there was no reason not <br/>
to put Ian into the same school.<br/>
<br/>
Ian also had &quot;discipline&quot; problems of a different sort. He simply politely <br/>
refused to go along with whatever the class was doing. &quot;No thanks!&quot; Since <br/>
he wasn&#39;t being abusive or particularly disruptive, they didn&#39;t know how to <br/>
handle him.<br/>
<br/>
So midway through the first grade they decided that he was &quot;learning <br/>
impaired,&quot; and called EJ and me in for a conference. They wanted to put him <br/>
in a &quot;special program&quot; for kids &quot;like Ian.&quot; All of this sent off alarms in <br/>
EJ&#39;s head, and she consented to let me take Ian out of that place and into <br/>
our homeschool, which is named &quot;Lysander Spooner Academy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Extra bonus points for anyone here who knows who Lysander Spooner was.)<br/>
<br/>
The way we are working currently, I have Zeke registered with the <br/>
&quot;Discovery&quot; on-line curriculum program, giving him assignments 4 or 5 days <br/>
per week. He has been having special difficulty with math, so I supplement <br/>
that with the &quot;Math Made Easy&quot; kit, which seems to be helping.<br/>
<br/>
With Ian, we&#39;ve purchased some basic phonics and arithmetic workbooks, and <br/>
encourage him to work with these by stipulating that if he wants to play <br/>
his computer games that day or wrestle with Dad in the evening then he has <br/>
to do a certain amount of work first.<br/>
<br/>
We go on occasional &quot;field trips&quot; to the museums and suchlike, and twice a <br/>
month we meet with our local home-schooling support group at an area park.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really satisfied with all of this. I&#39;ve heard of the &quot;un-schooling&quot; <br/>
philosophy from some of the moms at the homeschool group, and read up a bit <br/>
on it. I find it very appealing philosophically, but again there are two <br/>
issues which have so far prevented me from diving in.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, I&#39;m not sure myself that it will work. My boys are lazy and it <br/>
seems like if left to their own devices they&#39;d just watch TV and play with <br/>
toys or computer games all day.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I have to deal with _two_ mothers (Zeke is from a previous <br/>
marriage) who are not libertarians or sympathetic to the idea of <br/>
child-directed learning. Zeke&#39;s mom (Melissa) wants to make sure that he <br/>
has whatever preparation he needs to get into college. EJ is still very <br/>
much stuck in the regimented mind-set of &quot;schooling&quot; (although she rebels <br/>
against it in other, interesting ways) and regards what happened in the <br/>
government school as &quot;a basically good system that&#39;s currently broken.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I subscribed to this group in hopes of gathering some information that <br/>
will help me bolster my case (and fully convince myself) that un-schooling <br/>
is a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
And there you have it.<br/>

If people expect unschooling to look like kids doing school work on their<br/>
own, they&#39;re going to think unschooling is a failure.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling kids look like they&#39;re on summer vacation. Unschooling parents<br/>
look like they&#39;re helping their kids explore their interests and running<br/>
interesting things through their kids lives so they kids have opportunities<br/>
to expand their interests when they need to.<br/>
<br/>
There is no such thing as lazy when kids are following their interests! Lazy<br/>
is often a way of saying someone isn&#39;t living their life they way we want<br/>
them to. Unschooling is about being who they are. Unschooling is about<br/>
helping kids be who they are.<br/>

Sometimes it&#39;s best not to give too much information that sounds scary. And<br/>
child-led learning *does* sound scary. You can help the kids follow their<br/>

it child-led learning.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; seems like if left to their own devices they&#39;d just watch TV and play with<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    I&#39;m new too Scott. Just a short introduction for everyone...I&#39;m a an unschooling mom to a 5 yr old girl and 2 yr old boy. I was pretty quick to accept unschooling (though by no means have I deschooled myself enough, ah well, I think that may be a long battle). I started looking at school options last January thinking homeschooling was weird. By Feb. I was determined to homeschool but thought unschooling was nuts. By May I came out to myself and realized it was what I wanted to do. I think I was an unschooler at heart. :) My daughter certainly is. It&#39;s absolutely stunning to watch her take control of her education.<br/>
        I saved that &#39;lazy&#39; quote above because I&#39;m becoming more convinced that laziness really isn&#39;t a natual state for kids or at least mine. I see it in my daughter only, a) when she&#39;s reacting to my intermittant attempts to be an over-controlling and downright rude parent. She just shuts down in rebellion, or b) she isn&#39;t doing what I, at any given moment, think she should be doing (she&#39;s watching TV when I decide she should be cleaning her room so she must be lazy (Even if I haven&#39;t asked her to clean her room). For me, Laziness in Catherine is either a reaction to my behaviour towards her or a judgement I make in the context of what I think she should be doing. Does that make sense? Anyway, I thought I&#39;d share that in case it was of some help.<br/>

&gt;I like the singing Klingon! :-) Do you have any suggestions for kids who are<br/>
&gt;interested in animation on the computer?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are several good books available teaching the principles of <br/>
animation, and those same principles apply to traditional as they do to the <br/>
computer variety. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t recommend any titles as I learned this <br/>
trade by just diving in and doing stuff. (I was in the right place at the <br/>
right time to get into the computer games biz with very little animation <br/>
training -- I learned 98 percent of my animation skills on-the-job.) But I <br/>
understand there&#39;s a book put out by Disney that&#39;s pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, quality computer animation software tends to be expensive. <br/>
The program I used to make the Singing Klingon, 3D Studio MAX, costs around <br/>
$3,500. A less expensive but good alternative is Lightwave -- sometimes you <br/>
can find used copies for a decent price (whereas the makers of 3DS MAX has <br/>
some clause in their license which prevents people from legally selling <br/>
used copies of that program).<br/>
<br/>
There is a $300 program available called Hash 3D Animation Studio, which is <br/>
generally not bad (except for version 5 which was extremely buggy) but <br/>
tends to live in its own world and is not interoperable with any other <br/>
graphics software package.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you&#39;re not averse to bootleg software for educational purposes, <br/>
both of these programs can be found using one of the commonly available <br/>
file-sharing programs (Kazaa or BearShare). You won&#39;t get the manuals, of <br/>
course, but you can usually find books at your local CompuUSA or whatever <br/>
that will fill the need.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are into playing Quake, there are shareware programs available <br/>
for making custom Quake characters (called &quot;models&quot;). The benefit to these <br/>
is they tend to automate a lot of the difficult stuff (such as building <br/>
animation hierarchies between bodyparts) while teaching the basics <br/>
(creating and manipulating basic shapes, and creating and applying <br/>
textures), and reward the user with a working model in a relatively short <br/>
time frame.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, many parents object to the graphic violence of Quake so this is <br/>
not an option for them. Unfortunately I don&#39;t know of any alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
For 2D animation, the industry standard seems to be Macromedia Flash. Also <br/>
kind of pricey, but a lot less so than the 3D packages.<br/>
<br/>
For the truly budget minded there are a variety of gif animation shareware <br/>
packages available, although what my son Zeke likes best is the gif <br/>
animation features in Adobe Photoshop (from version 6 forward).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

&lt;&lt;For me, Laziness in Catherine is either a reaction to my behaviour towards <br/>
her or a judgement I make in the context of what I think she should be doing. &gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;ve certainly hit the nail on the head about the laziness thing.  <br/>
Some parents find it harder than others to accept this idea about not judging <br/>
their behavior, but it&#39;s a key, I think.  <br/>
