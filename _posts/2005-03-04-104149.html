&gt; has (e.g. Garfield books), then I&#39;d probably buy it.  But, to me, <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; fits in the category of waiting until he has an interest and then <br/>
&gt; supporting it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of the stuff I get for Rain is sort of connected to something she<br/>
likes, but different. I got her Heathcliff books when she was interested<br/>
in Garfield, and TinTin when she was interested in Asterix (or maybe the<br/>
other way around), and sometimes they catch and sometimes they don&#39;t... <br/>
<br/>
Does he read any manga, or has he seen any? It&#39;s also sort of along the<br/>
lines of a comic book, but different...<br/>
<br/>
We are financially very limited, but Borders will let you sit there and<br/>
read for hours, without buying anything... we do usually buy coffee,<br/>
which is cheaper than a book. They have a better selction than our<br/>
library, anyway. You can also buy books on ebay and half if you find<br/>
anything interesting... or put out a call to your local group or friends,<br/>
most of the homeschoolers we knows have thousands of books and we borrow<br/>
(and lend) a lot.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Since we aren&#39;t in stores often, because he dislikes shopping, it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; hat common for us to even see cool new stuff. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about online shopping? Then you can just show him the screen. Ebay is<br/>
truly awesome, and then if something isn&#39;t a hit you can turn around and<br/>
sell it again, and not be out much at all. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about going to the theater, but am often <br/>
&gt; discouraged <br/>
&gt; by the ticket prices.  (even if only multiplied by three people)  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Usher! It&#39;s a great way to see shows for free! I know the Davis Musical<br/>
Theatre Company is always looking for ushers, and they have no minimum<br/>
age limit for ushers, as long as you can. They&#39;re doing Annie in the<br/>
adult theatre and the kids are doing Beauty and the Beast (which, in the<br/>
interest of full discolsure, Rain is in). Beauty might be more appealing<br/>
- it&#39;s funnier, and there&#39;s some swordfighting choreographed by a local<br/>
fencing instructor, and both leads are older teens and just awesome<br/>
(/plug)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  We don&#39;t talk much.  He doesn&#39;t seem interested in <br/>
&gt; talking <br/>
&gt; to me.  Even in the car<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about putting on NPR in the car and making occasional comments... I<br/>
do that naturally, but Rain generally either challenges me or asks a<br/>
question agrees... it&#39;s sort of like getting a conversation going without<br/>
his needing to be involved, but then maybe he&#39;d jump in.<br/>
<br/>
And what are you into now, what are your interests? Is he seeing you<br/>
getting excited about new things, learning, growing?  I firmly believe<br/>
that &quot;children need interesting mothers&quot; (as Ariel Gore put it) and I<br/>
think my getting excited about things that interest me is more important<br/>
to Rain than anything I buy for her. She sees me eagerly perusing the<br/>
latest knitty.com, and jumping on stage when an actress has to leave<br/>
rehearsal early (so fun!), and mastering online scrabble... <br/>
<br/>
Actually, she&#39;s watching a video of Pippin that she&#39;s watched dozens of<br/>
times, and she just paused it and rewound, and pointed out that Pippin&#39;s<br/>
&quot;mail&quot; shirt is really knitted, on big needles... which she knows because<br/>
I took up kniting, and then she decided to learned, too..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are depressed, I think getting that treated is the most<br/>
important step you can take for your son&#39;s unschooling... and for your<br/>
own happiness, too. <br/>
