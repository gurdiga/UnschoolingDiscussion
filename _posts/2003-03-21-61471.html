 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to say thank you for posting!  I am a lurker here for the most part, as my children are only 3 years and 6 months, but it is so nice to hear about unschooling from the point of view of someone who is currently seeing both sides... the pros and cons you&#39;re experiencing firsthand from being unschooled verses the &quot;other&quot; educational setting.  Especially hearing how you see schools currently are, which I&#39;m sure are different (worse) than they were even when *I* was in school 15 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just really glad you posted.<br/>
