<div id="ygrps-yiv-578097854">This is for anyone that attended the unschooling conference in SC last year.<br/>
I am trying to write an article about it and would like to include some <br/>
memories of other attendees, not just my own.<br/>
If you don&#39;t mind emailing me a favorite memory of the conference, something <br/>
funny, or poignant or life changing...whatever really moved you or made a <br/>
difference in your life.<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
