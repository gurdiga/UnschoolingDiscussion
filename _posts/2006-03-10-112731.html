<div id="ygrps-yiv-52545196">Hi, my name is Michelle, mama to Sage 3 and Julian 9mo.  I have been<br/>
reading here for a few months now and really enjoying the discussions<br/>
that come up on this list.<br/>
Today, while giving my daughter a bath, I had my first real<br/>
understanding of unschooling.  She was in the tub and and playing with<br/>
her bath toys that are little foam letters.  So I picked one up and<br/>
asked if she knew which letter it was, she answered and then asked me<br/>
if I knew what letter it was.  My first thought was &quot; Am I being to<br/>
school like?&quot;, &quot; Am I pushing her to know her letters?&quot;.  These are<br/>
very common examples of my thoughts lately, I overanalyze everything.<br/>
So I continued to play the letters game with her and finally<br/>
everything just clicked.    We were having so much fun and it didnt<br/>
matter if it was letters or colors or ducks we were playing with. <br/>
There was such a happy energy in the air while we went back and forth<br/>
asking eachother what the letters were, so I just went with it.  Sage<br/>
then started asking me what color the letters were so we played that<br/>
game for a while, and then we played with all of the rubber duckies too.<br/>
My point is that for the first time I wasn&#39;t worried about what we<br/>
were doing and what she might be learning from it, I just focused on<br/>
how much fun we were having and how wonderful it felt.  Right now Sage<br/>
is sitting on the living room floor all wrapped up in her monkey<br/>
towel, watching her favorite Dora movie, and eating a slice of<br/>
leftover pizza...all things she requested and I gave her because I<br/>
wanted to keep that happy smile on her face and that positive energy<br/>
in our house.  She has since told my husband that she would like to go<br/>
outside so she can spit and blow fire, I guess there is a great game<br/>
of playing dragons in our future today!!<br/>
Thanks to everyone who posts on this list, I have learned so much from<br/>
you all!!<br/>
<br/>
