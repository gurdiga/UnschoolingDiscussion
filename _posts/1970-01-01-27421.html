If you wish to call science developed by Nobel winner like physicist <br/>
Murray Gell Mann, economists, and other top scientists bogus you are <br/>
welcome.  I suggest you read Smolin&#39;s &quot;The Life of the Cosmos,&quot; <br/>
Harwking&#39;s &quot;The Universe in a Nutshell,&quot; &quot;Chaos&quot; by ???. &quot;Complexity&quot; <br/>
by ??? &quot;Gaia&quot; by James Lovelock and other popular books on the science <br/>
shelf.  They reveal that the world is very different from that of 100 <br/>
years ago.  It is a network of interlinked and interdependent holons <br/>
within holons.<br/>
Or if you merely want to reject my speculations on the new science and <br/>
it appliction to the social sphere feel free.  But you would be better <br/>
equipped if you first read them on<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Your belief system seems to value learning over education.  Your<br/>
&gt; belief system (science, paradigm) seems to value equality over<br/>
&gt; comparative valuation.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BE:<br/>
Aside from your misunderstanding of what I was trying to say I have no <br/>
disagreement with your comments.  And I follow your work with great <br/>
interest.<br/>
I might suggest that, like many others, you are more concerned with the <br/>
problems of today than the potentials of tomorrow.<br/>
The point of my diatribe on the transition from the &#39;dominator <br/>
paradigm&quot; (read Riane Eisler&#39;s &quot;The Chalice and the Blade) to a Gaian <br/>
Paradigm follows the model of the Copernicus revolution when humans <br/>
started recognizing that the Earth was not made for them and that they <br/>
were not the centeer of the univrse.  It also follows the Darwin <br/>
revolution that reduced the divinity of man (and I do mean &quot;man&quot;) to be <br/>
more equal with other living things.<br/>
<br/>
These and other social revolutions did not start to reduce the evils of <br/>
the world.  They are first shifts in the social mindset based in a new <br/>
world view.   They did not start out to produce a shift in the social <br/>
paradigm.  Those paradimg shifts followed because our knowledge of the <br/>
universe changed.  I suggest that another such paradigm shift is now <br/>
happening due to transition from the &#39;dominator paradigm&#39; the the <br/>
&#39;Gaian paradigm.&#39;<br/>
I might add that I do not use God as a divine beng who will change our <br/>
lives if we ar &quot;good&quot; or if we pray of Him.  I used that word to <br/>
suggest that we are all equal within the laws of nature that are being <br/>
revealed by science.   We all have to live under those same laws they <br/>
treat us all equally, whethr we know them or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The only relevance I see to this thread and homeschooling.  Is that I <br/>
see homeschooling as one of many social innovations that will become <br/>
more and more important as the Gaain revolution emerges.   You and <br/>
others are doing a great job , in my mind. It is more significant than <br/>
you realize.  You are on the cutting edge of a deep fundamental social <br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
Keep up your good works.<br/>

<br/>
By &quot;the problems of today&quot; do you mean my children&#39;s current   <br/>
happiness in this moment?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you mean to suggest that the unschooling work I&#39;ve done  <br/>
is &quot;concerned with the problems of today&quot; and won&#39;t help the  <br/>
&quot;potentials of tomorrow.&quot;  You&#39;re free to reject my experience (not  <br/>
speculations) as &quot;like many others&quot; if you wish, but it seems to lack  <br/>
productivity given that the list is about learning and how people can  <br/>
and do learn from everything around them.<br/>

It&#39;s important with or without &quot;Gaian revolutions.&quot;  It&#39;s important  <br/>
for its own sake.  It&#39;s important in many lives this moment.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I strongly doubt that any science is revealing that the world is very <br/>
different from the world of 100 years ago. Except demography and maybe <br/>
botany, oh, and environmental scientists. But the fundamentals are the same. <br/>
And looking at holon philosophy it doesn&#39;t seem to reject the idea of <br/>
heirarchy, it just defines them differently. A &quot;natural heirarchy&quot; of sorts.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it is interesting that you are making such a mental leap from <br/>
physics to social science. I suppose that is what the holon philosopher <br/>
would do.<br/>
<br/>
And as you say, what you write has nothing really to add to an unschoolers <br/>
life. I would also argue that my unschooling my two children is as important <br/>
now as it would be during the post Gaian Revolution you speak of. And now is <br/>
all I&#39;ve got. It is only ever now. If what I do or say or write helps <br/>
someone now it is so much more important then some intangible future. That <br/>
said, I imagine my children&#39;s futures will be much richer and happier than <br/>
they would be if I hadn&#39;t chosen to live the life I&#39;ve taken them along for.<br/>

<br/>
I am interested in the whole Gaian thing, an it&#39;s on my list of things <br/>
to read more deeply about when I have time, but in the meantime I come <br/>
here to deepen my understanding of unschooling and have been wondering <br/>
about the connections in this conversation.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t mind people being here who aren&#39;t unschoolers actively, and I  <br/>
don&#39;t mind people without children coming and saying &quot;interesting  <br/>
reading; good job.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do mind the feeling of having the list commandeered, and I don&#39;t  <br/>
like illogical statements left lying around unanswered.  Elements  <br/>
(chemical or otherwise) aren&#39;t all equal.<br/>
<br/>
The question about who&#39;s equal under what law how wasn&#39;t answered,  <br/>
but that&#39;s okay; I knew there wasn&#39;t an answer when I asked. But  <br/>
statements that can&#39;t stand up to simple questions aren&#39;t likely to  <br/>
help anyone unschool better.<br/>
