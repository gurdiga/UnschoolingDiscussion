<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487539792">As many of you know, I am now teaching in an inner city public school, <br/>
middle school, Language Arts.  <br/>
<br/>
This week we are testing so the kids are totally worn out by the end of <br/>
the day.  The school is trying to stress the Power of One (how one <br/>
person can change the world, the neighborhood, the classroom, etc.)  So <br/>
I showed the movie Amazing Grace and Chuck.  That was finished so I took <br/>
in my favorite--the Princes Bride.  Now I&#39;ve just gotta do something <br/>
that my administration will consider &quot;educational&quot; if questioned. <br/>
 Sadly, these kids are not unschooled at all.  Far from it.  Most of <br/>
them don&#39;t even grasp the idea that learning can be fun, let alone that <br/>
it might be somethign they want to do.  Furthermore as I have to play by <br/>
the rules, I need to have some sort of follow up (tangible) for this <br/>
movie.  Any ideas?<br/>

<br/>
It just so happens that Marty, Holly and I just watched it tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Motifs (princess, lost-at-sea/disguised lover, saved from marriage at the <br/>
last minute)<br/>
<br/>
Framing (the grandfather reading is a frame the way the Canterbury Tales are <br/>
framed within a larger story)<br/>
<br/>
The wine glasses scene can be compared to other riddling scenes involving <br/>
logic or traditional riddles.  The Hobbit (if any of them have read that, or if <br/>
you wanted to read them the scene where Gollum and Bilbo are exchanging riddles <br/>
with a real prize at stake), The Lady and the Tiger, and I know there are <br/>
others but I&#39;m not thinking of them.<br/>
<br/>
There are ballad examples of that and of the disguised lover, but I doubt <br/>
these kids know many ballads.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-499894765">Joylyn, the Princess Bride is one of my favorites, too!  Maybe you could <br/>
 have them outline each characters motives for their actions and which <br/>
motives were based on the individual&#39;s needs and which encompassed the <br/>
whole group involved.  Have them discuss which character was the most <br/>
altruistic and which was the most selfish.  Remind them not to forget <br/>
the boy and his grandfather.<br/>
Good luck.  HeidiC.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494267132">Joylyn, what about having them write an alternative ending to the movie? You<br/>
could then compare it to the ending in the book and ask why they differ. Or<br/>
read excerpts from the book and compare to the movie, ask why the difference<br/>
or why they kept it the same. <br/>
<br/>
Vocabulary? (&quot;You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you<br/>
think it means.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
The Rule of Three: How the Man in Black has to meet and overcome three<br/>
assailants, each with different challenges (skill, strength, intellect).<br/>
What challenges have they overcome and how? Where do you see the Rule of<br/>
Three in other stories?<br/>
<br/>
Have them memorize certain speeches or re-enact a scene from the movie in<br/>
class. It&#39;s one of the most quotable movies I know. Last year I saw Mandy<br/>
Patinkin in concert and at the very end, he struck a fencing pose, said &quot;My<br/>
name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!&quot; and brought<br/>
down the house!<br/>
<br/>
If you google Princess Bride, you&#39;ll find websites with more trivia than<br/>
you&#39;ll ever need, if you want to have a trivia contest or just use it as<br/>
filler on a worksheet. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun! I wish you&#39;d been one of my teachers!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780360505">I love Princess Bride!  While the ideas being shared are good, it&#39;s just a shame to be required to find educational value in PB.  It has such incredible value -- obvious by the many suggestions -- just as it is.  Too bad the school system requires you to make an assignment of it -- some kids will miss it&#39;s treasure because for them, it will always be that movie they had to watch in mid-school.  Sometimes I&#39;m convinced the purpose of school is to suck the joy out of life entirely...<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s because I spent most of an hour on the phone with my sis yesterday, trying to help her see why I don&#39;t think public school is the great success for everyone that it&#39;s been so far for her son.  But she&#39;s very stuck in that mindset that kids must learn things and early before they get bored.  just not worth the fight, I guess, but I love her kids like my own...<br/>

<br/>
I remember reading that Whoopi Goldberg wanted to play Princess<br/>
Buttercup, the most beautiful woman in the world, but some &quot;dominant<br/>
culture&quot; ideas about beauty squelched that idea.  You could have a<br/>
pretty interesting discussion about that.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the book starts with the author searching for a copy of this book<br/>
for his son, because he loved the book so much in his childhood.  If you<br/>
could conceivably get the kids to talk about how books inspire us, how<br/>
stories inspire us, how heroes and role models inspire us, that would be<br/>
&quot;academically respectable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you compare some sections of the book, read aloud by you, to the<br/>
movie?  There&#39;s something about the same theme in different media in the<br/>
language arts standards for 6th or 7th grade (CA), I think.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Doesn&#39;t the movie have a potentially ambiguous ending, like The Lady<br/>
or the Tiger?</div>

 </span></blockquote>Definitely watch it first.  There are some pretty heavy violence parts, but<br/>
it isn&#39;t gratuitous violence.  It&#39;s about apartheid in South Africa.  It&#39;s<br/>
worth seeing just for the wonderful music, which is how I found out about<br/>
it.  I heard the sound track.  There&#39;s a wonderful part where the young<br/>
white main character is told to teach a bunch of black men in a prison a<br/>
song to perform for some visiting dignitaries.  He teaches them a song that<br/>
sounds really nice, but the words in their language are a huge insult to the<br/>
dignitaries - who don&#39;t realize it.  It&#39;s been a long time since I saw it,<br/>
so I hope I&#39;m remembering it correctly.  Time to watch it again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721389760">Thanks for all the help with PB.  We did watch it and I think the kids <br/>
liked it.  I didn&#39;t do much follow up and today I heard one kid say to <br/>
the other &quot;as you wish.&quot;  This was off the cuff, so.... :-)<br/>
