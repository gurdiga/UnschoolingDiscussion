<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217513346">We have incorporated traditions from both families over the years.  I<br/>
prepare the turkey & dressing, sweet potatoes & potatoe salad for<br/>
Thanksgiving dinner.  Then everyone else brings the rest of the meal<br/>
(Grandma better not show up without her banana pudding or she won&#39;t be<br/>
allowed in the house!). We have 6 kids. For a while my entire family (I&#39;m<br/>
one of three kids), my husband&#39;s family (he&#39;s oldest of 4) and any friends<br/>
that wanted to come were invited.  We have seen some Thanksgivings of 30-35<br/>
people in the house for dinner.  People would eat where ever they could find<br/>
somewhere to sit.  Then a poker game usually breaks out!<br/>
<br/>
Right after Thanksgiving  I decorate the house.  During the first weekend of<br/>
December we would go to Penland SC to cut our tree, eat at one of the &quot;fish<br/>
camps&quot; in Gastonia, NC and go thru McAdenville to see Christmas Town all<br/>
aglow. (A truly wonderful sight).  The past couple of years we have had to<br/>
forego this part and find a local cut your own lot. And I truly do miss the<br/>
road trip. Decorating the tree means that Dad is in charge of the lights,<br/>
kids the ornaments, and mom the tinsel; Christmas carols MUST be playing and<br/>
cider and hot chocolate served.<br/>
<br/>
On Christmas Eve we attend a candle light service at church, stop by<br/>
Grandma&#39;s for a very brief visit then come home to do our own Christmas<br/>
rituals. Our own personal ritual includes getting into Jammies, setting out<br/>
Santa&#39;s goodies, lighting a fire and reading.  Each year the person reading<br/>
seems to change now.  The oldest child reads Twas the Night Before<br/>
Christmas, I read the Luke version of the Christmas story.  Then Dad and the<br/>
oldest child read  an &quot;Advent Service&quot; that my husband wrote--taking into<br/>
account that 5 of our children are adopted--and the advent wreath is<br/>
lighted.  It is a really special time for us and one that I really do<br/>
treasure.  My oldest daughter has commented on how much she misses this part<br/>
of the season since she is now out on her own.<br/>
<br/>
On Christmas morning, after gifts and some breakfast we just play and enjoy.<br/>
We go to Grandmas for lunch (taking 1 or two dishes for the potluck) and<br/>
exchange gifts there.  We draw names and have a $10 limit.  Very young<br/>
children do not participate in the name drawing and get gifts from<br/>
Grandparents and anyone else deciding to give them.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-419998599">Kind of a sad commentary on American viewpoint. . . Americans in general <br/>
don&#39;t celebrate death and are typically very fearful of it, and want to avoid <br/>
it at all costs. To think that millions of Americans would celebrate <br/>
someone&#39;s death says much about the hatred and vengeful attitude that would <br/>
be in their heart for having that celebration, not much different from the <br/>
hatred some people have for us as a country. I, for one, would not celebrate <br/>
bin Laden&#39;s death.  If he is proven to be the mastermind behind the attacks I <br/>
sincerely hope he is brought to justice, but my idea of justice does not <br/>
include state sanctioned murder.<br/>

&quot;There was a tumultuous conflagration of burning steel and fuel at our<br/>
gates, and from it stepped forth these hijackers, the blessed name of the<br/>
Lord already turning to molten brass on their accursed lips,&quot; said Iblis The<br/>
Thrice-Damned, the cacodemon charged with conscripting new arrivals into the<br/>
ranks of the forgotten. &quot;Indeed, I do not know what they were expecting, but<br/>
they certainly didn&#39;t seem prepared to be skewered from eye socket to<br/>
bunghole and then placed on a spit so that their flesh could be roasted by<br/>
the searing gale of flatus which issues forth from the haunches of Asmoday.&quot;<br/>

&quot;Look, I don&#39;t know, maybe I haven&#39;t made myself completely clear, so for<br/>
the record, here it is again,&quot; said the Lord, His divine face betraying<br/>
visible emotion during a press conference near the site of the fallen Twin<br/>
Towers. &quot;Somehow, people keep coming up with the idea that I want them to<br/>
kill their neighbor. Well, I don&#39;t. And to be honest, I&#39;m really getting<br/>
sick and tired of it. Get it straight. Not only do I not want anybody to<br/>

that anybody ought to be able to understand.&quot;<br/>
