<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087573157">But that&#39;s just it.  I DON&#39;T think my way is better for you.  <br/>
I think my way is my way and you need to find your way (if you are not<br/>
happy with what you are doing.)  If hearing me talk about my way gives<br/>
you ideas to try fine.  If something I say sounds totally wrong for you,<br/>
it is perfectly okay for you not to even consider it.  Granted, I think<br/>
Esso is wrong and should not be allowed to promote his ideas, but baring<br/>
a few extremems I think we all (children included) have different needs,<br/>
wants and expectations and that&#39;s why my way can only be my way and your<br/>
way can only be yours.  We can talk and take ideas from one another but<br/>
in the end, none of us has a monopoly on the right way.<br/>

&gt; in the &quot;let them watch whatever they want&quot; camp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not much of a camper :) but sure, I suffer from <br/>
&gt; self-righteousness as<br/>
&gt; much as the next human. Nobody&#39;s immune.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That brings us back to everyone thinking their way is better, or <br/>
&gt; they wouldn&#39;t be doing it.<br/>

     In three words I can sum up everything I&#39;ve learned about life: it<br/>
goes on.<br/>
