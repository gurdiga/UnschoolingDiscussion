<br/>
I love reading the group and thinking about the the posts and learning about new stuff and new ways of being.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who posts get dissected and those who do the dissecting. Taking bits and parts helps to clarify my own thoughts about certain topics and issues. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who&#39;ve gone before and whose children are grown for continuing to be a part of this list and sharing your experiences.  <br/>
<br/>
Even though all the topics may not apply to me directly they can still help with nuggets of wisdom generally applied.</div>

Cathy and family.<br/>
