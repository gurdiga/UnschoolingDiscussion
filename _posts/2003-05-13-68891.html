&lt;&lt;  Btw, sometimes i cross out our addy on the catalogs and write <br/>
&quot;Return to Sender&quot; and then drop it in a mailbox....let them get their own <br/>
junk mail! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This would be a great idea (or is, I guess I should say) except that the post <br/>
office doesn&#39;t return them. Bulk postage things just get tossed by the PO, <br/>
not returned.  Lara..........</div>

I read somewhere about what to do when you get swamped with junk mail.<br/>
Credit card applications and book clubs and such. They almost always have a<br/>
pre paid envelope inside. Take all the paper that doesn&#39;t have you name and<br/>
address on it and put it in the pre paid envelopes and send it all back to<br/>
them!!!! That way they junk mail just like you! YOu can even mix and match<br/>
so the companies get new stuff.<br/>

<br/>
They have to pay for the mail that comes back, too.  It&#39;s metered return <br/>
mail, so they don&#39;t pay for every envelope, just those delivered back to them.<br/>
<br/>
But true about catalogs.  Unless something says &quot;Address Correction <br/>
Requested,&quot; the post office will just trash it if it&#39;s undeliverable.  With <br/>
the address correction note, the post office will return the back cover with <br/>
the P.O. forwarding note on it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SO... if you&#39;ve lately moved and you haven&#39;t notified clubs and such, you <br/>
could EASILY miss 2nd and 3rd class mail.  Because 3rd/bulk/4th any of those <br/>
lesser things (whatever their current designations) will not be forwarded.   <br/>
But 2nd MIGHT.  It&#39;s kinda up to the post office.  But if it&#39;s printed <br/>
&quot;address correction requested,&quot; they will NOT give it to you, they will tear <br/>
the back cover off and return it because they&#39;ll get 35 cents or some such <br/>
from the publisher for each that comes back corrected.  <br/>
<br/>
Short answer is always keep your address current and don&#39;t get too emotional <br/>
about junk mail.  It&#39;s not good for your digestion.<br/>

the bad thing about that is that companies will probably stop offering the <br/>
free return because of all that sabotage, and then the people who really DID <br/>
need to respond to them will have to pay for their own, because of people <br/>
goofing with the system.  I&#39;m six of one and half a dozen of the other on it, <br/>
but it seemed fair to make the other argument.<br/>

It ends up wasting even more resources, too, so the moral superiority of not <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Mary!  I would love any info you could give me.  I would love to be <br/>
able to &#39;enroll&#39; the boys in a private school, so that i could get around all <br/>
the &#39;crap&#39;....got any openings?  LOL!  I am currently waiting to hear back <br/>
from the lady about setting a private school up and Krista Sallop, the <br/>
director of AEI to see if i could enroll them there....<br/>
<br/>
And i STILL haven&#39;t heard back from the wacko teacher that has the boys&#39; <br/>
forms to be turned into the schoolboard, so i dunno what to do about <br/>
that....i may just end up seeing what happens if we don&#39;t turn the blasted <br/>
things in.....<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the boys and i had a lovely time at the public library today....i <br/>
just LOVE seeing the kinds of stuff they bring home.  AND the boys are so <br/>
excited about the prospect of not having to keep up the paper trail for any <br/>
other purpose except our own intentions....<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!!!!<br/>

Hey, you have the best to answer your questions if you are waiting to hear<br/>
from Krista. She&#39;s the one here that helped me get started. I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
you can enroll with a homeschooling option if the school isn&#39;t close to you.<br/>
Krista will know that too. Any questions just ask her. If you can enroll<br/>
with her, I&#39;d just do it and save yourself the time and effort getting<br/>
started and finding other kids to enroll with yours. Krista is our local<br/>
authority on FL law. She&#39;s very knowledgeable and active with it all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We can in Canada.  I think maybe they only get money according to how many<br/>
they actually deliver, so they&#39;d have to subtract the ones that don&#39;t want<br/>
it from the bill or something.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m suspecting that you can&#39;t. The post office probably just throws away<br/>
bulk mail marked Return to Sender. First class mail, yes, but not bulk mail.<br/>
