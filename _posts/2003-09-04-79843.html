<div id="ygrps-yiv-615439792">People here have probably noticed that I am a MAJOR fan of Barbara Sher, and <br/>
especially her book Wishcraft. In fact, it&#39;s probably inspired my family&#39;s <br/>
unschooling more than anything else...and the book is NOT about unschooling. (If <br/>
you haven&#39;t read it, check out Wishcraft.com, or buy a copy of the book. Read <br/>
the first couple of chapters, and you&#39;ll see what I mean.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, on a whim, I wrote to Barbara, saying I knew it was unlikely that we <br/>
could possibly afford her, but what the heck...<br/>
<br/>
She wrote back, saying, no we really can&#39;t afford her...BUT! <br/>
<br/>
Barbara is VERY interested in writing a book for parents who want to support <br/>
their children and finding and realizing their gifts, sort of a Wishcraft for <br/>
Kids. In her words: &quot;This book will be different from my others, but in a form <br/>
I really love: it<br/>
will be a book full of tips, good ideas, and personal anecdotes of any<br/>
successful techniques they used to help their children find and follow their<br/>
true gifts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to Barbara and me that unschooling parents do this all the time.<br/>
<br/>
But she needs help. She needs tips, ideas, and anecdotes. You can either have <br/>
your name included or not, as you prefer. She&#39;d love stories and ideas from <br/>
kids and teens, as well. If we can come up with at least 100 useable tips and <br/>
stories within the next month, she&#39;ll come to the conference. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m going to be compiling these. You can post things here or e-mail me. <br/>
(Barbara is also subscribing to the list.)  I also plan to look through some <br/>
archives here and I may as you if I can share some stories and ideas with <br/>
Barbara.<br/>
<br/>
So, please send your ideas along soon! Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348404052">**But she needs help. She needs tips, ideas, and anecdotes. You can <br/>
either have<br/>

tips and<br/>

<br/>
One basic idea for child-led learning and exploration is the idea of a <br/>
flexible bedtime and a flexible overall schedule, as much as possible, <br/>
because most people don&#39;t start being creative on cue and don&#39;t want to <br/>
be stopped by the clock, either.<br/>
<br/>
When something cool is happening at my house at ten p.m., even though <br/>
I&#39;d prefer to go to bed, the activity is continued.  A couple that I can <br/>
remember are looking through the microscope that connects to the <br/>
computer, discussing astronomy, discussing history, reading outloud from <br/>
a great book.  (There have been lots of others, but I can&#39;t recall details.)<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a pretty basic unschooling idea, but it might not be <br/>
basic for someone parenting in a mainstream way, especially someone who <br/>
loves getting the house to be quiet at night. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS (Side note: let me share that last night when I was done reading <br/>
Harry Potter 5, my son took it to bed and read it himself for the first <br/>
time.  Perfect timing, as we had 8 chapters to go and I woke up with a <br/>
sore throat this morning.)  (I&#39;m posting this for those of you who <br/>
remember me moping that my child read only comic strip books for two <br/>
years while I started to fret that he wasn&#39;t making any &quot;progress&quot;.  I&#39;m <br/>
feeling a lot less fretful now.  And I DID remember not to audibly worry <br/>
AT him. &lt;g&gt;)</div>

<br/>
I was speaking at the Bayshore conference in California two or three years <br/>
ago, and  I took five topics I had presented elsewhere before, and narrowed them <br/>
down to the best fifteen minutes worth of each.  Then I set a timer for TEN <br/>
minutes.  When the timer went off, I stopped right where I was (maybe finished <br/>
a sentence) and went on to the next topic.  Some people got it right away.  A <br/>
few were truly frustrated.  It didn&#39;t matter what their reaction was, at the <br/>
end I made the point that starting and stopping by the clock is false and <br/>
frustrating and not only do unschoolers not have to do it, they should consciously <br/>
NOT do it whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my kids&#39; best learning has been after traditional &quot;bedtime,&quot; or IN <br/>
bed when they&#39;re trying to fall asleep and finally they get still and quiet and <br/>
their thoughts catch up with them.<br/>
<br/>
With apologies to those who know, and hopes of helping those who are new <br/>
here, here&#39;s something called latenight learning:<br/>
