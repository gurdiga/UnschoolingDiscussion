<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112111949">My 11-year-old loves mystery stories with really cool plots.  I suggested to<br/>
him that he might enjoy some of the books of Agatha Christie (even though<br/>
I&#39;ve only read a couple of her stories myself), and he&#39;s interested in<br/>
giving it a try.<br/>
<br/>
Any Christie fans out there who can suggest particular stories that would be<br/>
a good introduction?  He would probably NOT prefer a story where romance is<br/>
the driving force of the plot.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe Doyle?  I would love to get recommendations of good Holmes stories<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
Or other authors that we could look at?  I&#39;m not that familiar with the<br/>
genre.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568241850">When I was his age I was reading The Happy Hollisters.  I tried  <br/>
reading one of those aloud to Holly when she was nine or so, and she  <br/>
was irritated by the ignorant 60&#39;s casual prejudices.  So never mind  <br/>
those, though some of the stories were really fun.  Heavily into  <br/>
secret passages and false identities.<br/>
<br/>
If Doyle and Christie are hard for him to read, consider sound files.   <br/>
Then he could listen and do other things at the same time.<br/>

I don&#39;t know what the current-for-boys mystery series is.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
know if Hardy Boys books still exist or whether they spawned other  <br/>
series.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568475904">Oh!  Forgot to recommend movie versions of Agatha Christia, or the  <br/>
movie &quot;Clue&quot; (with Tim Curry and lots of other cool actors he might  <br/>
recognize, now or repeatedly later).<br/>

<br/>
If he does like them, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot are most people&#39;s  <br/>
favorite characters and I&#39;d stick with those because she did write a  <br/>
couple of international spy type books. Though both Marple and Poirot  <br/>
revolve around the psychological motivations for murder, the Miss  <br/>
Marple ones are mostly &quot;country estate&quot; mysteries and Hercule Poirot&#39;s  <br/>
take place in more exotic places. Both have novel length mysteries and  <br/>
short story collections.<br/>
<br/>
The language in Sherlock Holmes can be even more challenging.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t discourage him from either. My aunt bought both for me,  <br/>
including Poe when I was young and they became something to aspire  <br/>
to ;-) I even worked through several Poe stories with a dictionary  <br/>
next to me. But I&#39;d include them in amongst other books that are more  <br/>
geared to his age.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at the Wikipedia page and there are graphic novels  <br/>
produced in India for quiet a few Agatha Christie stories. Those might  <br/>
be perfect for 11 if they&#39;re available in America.<br/>

I agree with Sandra, the movies are a great idea. That way you could  <br/>
watch them together and talk about them. There were excellent  <br/>
adaptations of both Poirot (with David Suchet) and Miss Marple (with  <br/>
Joan Hickson) on PBS&#39;s Mystery:<br/>

(Apparently there&#39;s also a new one currently airing (in England) with  <br/>
Julia McKenzie:<br/>

<br/>
As to mysteries more geared to his age, Hardy Boys might be good and  <br/>
if they&#39;re like Nancy Drew there are contemporary stories as well as  <br/>
the older ones. I&#39;m pretty sure I was still reading Nancy Drew at 10.<br/>
<br/>
Another series, if you can find them, that I loved when I was a kid  <br/>
was Alfred Hitchcock and The Three Investigators. They were actual  <br/>
real mysteries. *Just* the first 6, though. A new writer was brought  <br/>
in and they turned from mysteries into adventure stories.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise I&#39;d tap into librarians and knowledgeable bookstore people  <br/>
who would know current titles are popular among boys his age.<br/>

Are you look specifically for detective stories?<br/>
<br/>
Joan - we have the entire Poirot Series with David Suchet on DVD - it is <br/>
fantastically well done. I&#39;m just not sure about how much would go over <br/>
his head. But you could try an episode and see how it goes. I think <br/>
they&#39;re better watched than read, myself, because of the locales being <br/>
so interesting and the period clothing is great and the accents, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Poirot would be more interesting than Miss Marple, I think (we have <br/>
those too, but there&#39;s less action, more sitting in the parlor talking).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081494953">Great suggestions, everybody!<br/>
<br/>
I had been thinking I would probably be reading things to him, but the<br/>
graphic novels might be good for him on his own.  I&#39;ll look up some of<br/>
these.  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-677951750">M.R. James wrote ghost stories that were mysterious.  Dylan liked those when he was younger.   You can find some of his stories online.   The Treasure of Abbot Thomas is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ghost.new-age-spirituality.com/mrjames10.html">http://ghost.new-age-spirituality.com/mrjames10.html</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some G.K. Chesterton stuff online, too. <br/>
<br/>
Those two authors wrote a lot of short stories if a great, fat book seems intimidating. <br/>
<br/>
There are other, older mystery stories by various authors here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hornpipe.com/mysclas.htm.">http://www.hornpipe.com/mysclas.htm.</a><br/>
