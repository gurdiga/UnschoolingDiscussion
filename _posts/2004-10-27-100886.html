<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728401708">I have some bad news about the photos from the Geocache at the conference as<br/>
well as all the other conference photos that James and I had taken.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The instant cameras and film rolls were stolen from my car when it was<br/>
broken into (again!) last week. They took my ashtray full of pennies, an old<br/>
pair of binoculars, and the film in my conference tote bag. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I�m so very sorry, because I had procrastinated taking them to be developed,<br/>
and actually didn�t realize they were part of the theft until I had parked<br/>
outside the photo place to take them in, and started looking for the bag in<br/>
the car.<br/>
