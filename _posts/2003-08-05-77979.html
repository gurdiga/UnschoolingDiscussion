<br/>
&quot; Great spirits have always been violently oppressed by mediocre minds. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education is that which remains when one has forgotten everything learned in school.&quot;<br/>
Ideas and opinions (New York, 1954). <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry.&quot;<br/>
Quoted in H Eves Return to Mathematical Circles (Boston 1988). <br/>
<br/>
&quot; When you want to teach children to think, you begin by treating them seriously when they are little, giving them responsibilities, talking to them candidly, providing privacy and solitude for them, and making them readers and thinkers of significant thoughts from the beginning. That&#39;s if you want to teach them to think.&quot;<br/>
--Bertrand Russell <br/>

As for university entrance issues, they have a better chance of getting into harvard as Homeshoolers than as public schoolers.  HS kids are sought out by big schools.  Gee, can&#39;t imagine why!<br/>

 &quot;I don&#39;t want my children fed or clothed by the state, but I would prefer that to their being educated by the state. &quot;<br/>
-- Max Victor Belz <br/>

<br/>
&quot; I suppose it is because nearly all children go to school nowadays and have things arranged for them that they seem so forlornly unable to produce their own ideas. &quot;<br/>
--Agatha Christie <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Teaching does not make learning --- organized education operates on the assumption that children learn only when and only what and only because we teach them. This is not true. It is very close to 100% false. Learners make learning. &quot;<br/>
-- Former teacher, John Holt<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot; What we want to see is the child in pursuit of knowledge, not knowledge in pursuit of the child. &quot;<br/>
-- George Bernard Shaw <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Homeschooling and public schooling are as opposite as two sides of a coin. In a homeschooling environment, the teacher need not be certified, but the child MUST learn. In a public school environment, the teacher MUST be certified, but the child need NOT learn.&quot;<br/>

My own-very-best reason - to give them a better life, free of bullying teachers, bullying bells, bullying whistles, and of course, school yard bullies.  This bullying kills kids - coined &quot;bullycide&quot;: see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bullyonline.org/schoolbully/school.htm">http://www.bullyonline.org/schoolbully/school.htm</a><br/>

My neighbor, who has been hs her two ds ages 9 and 6 for three years is now<br/>
faced with having to put them in school starting Thursday.  Her Dh is the<br/>
one deciding that HE wants them to go to school.  He just doesn&#39;t feel that<br/>
she is doing an adequate job of teaching them.  Now the reason I&#39;m writing<br/>
to you all is because she wants me to convince her dh that hs is best for<br/>
them.  I&#39;ve already told her that if I talk to him, I&#39;m going to give him<br/>
the UNschooling slant.  My question to you is what do or can I say to him<br/>
that would make any difference to him at this point?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice<br/>
<br/>

When someone asked my unschooling son whether he could (without a high school diploma) get into University here in Canada he told them &quot;I&#39;m not worried, if I don&#39;t get in here I can always go to Harvard!&quot; LOL<br/>
