&gt;&gt; Pam, daughter of dog show family, former performance dog junkie ;),<br/>
&gt;&gt; completely off topic<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kelly, daughter of dog-ignorants, still loving show dogs and dog shows<br/>
&gt; (though not participating), and one who hates gundog performance events (too<br/>
&gt; much killing---had to switch breeds to avoid it! &lt;G&gt;)  And prefers THIS topic<br/>
&gt; to the religion one! &lt;BWEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My performance dogs were Border Collies, so we did the sheepherding,<br/>
agility, obedience stuff. Now we have a family dog who is a true killing<br/>
machine and would really, REALLY like to prove it :P, our Jack Russell<br/>
Terrier. If we get a mouse infestation sometime, I&#39;m letting the little<br/>
Merchant of Death have at it, but meanwhile she&#39;s had to accept that our<br/>
show guinea pigs and show rabbits are off limits. ;)<br/>

Merchant of Death!!LOL!! That&#39;s funny. I can just picture the dog. Our <br/>
little Beagle would love something to hunt too. Someone remarked about a <br/>
hunting dog having it&#39;s nose to the ground all the time. I don&#39;t even know <br/>
what Kelli&#39;s (the Beagle) face looks like! The only time she picks up her <br/>
head is when you hold food! She waits quivering in the oddest positions when <br/>
one of the cats walks into the room. After was seems like hours, she pounces <br/>
on the poor thing. Right now she&#39;s obsessed with lizards outside. And being <br/>
south FL, we have tons of them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, my remaining JRT is just like that, too.  I call her The Predator.  <br/>
When I had her boarded for the conference, they had a sign that said, &quot;If <br/>
your dog is a jumper, climber or digger, please let us know.&quot;   I said, &quot;add <br/>
to the list &#39;predator&#39; and that&#39;s pretty much our little Ladybug!  Don&#39;t let <br/>
the name fool you!&quot;<br/>
