<div id="ygrps-yiv-832651089">We&#39;ve tried the Learnables.  My kids say &quot;b-o-r-i-n-g!!!!!!!&quot;  If you are an auditory learner you might like it. My kids found it hard to follow. There is a series of tapes that you listen to while looking at drawings in an accompanying book.<br/>
 A friend of ours who is a native Peruvian likes it because the learner learns the language just like we learned our native language--by listening.  This may be true but it didn&#39;t work well for us<br/>
 I&#39;d be interested to see what others think. My 9 yo dd is also interested in ASL and has been teaching herself from a couple of books, The Joy of Signing and American Sign Language Dictionary. She likes the Joy og Signing better. We are looking for an instructor, though.<br/>
