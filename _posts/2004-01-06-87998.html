&gt; Home schooling gave him wide latitude to pursue his own interests in<br/>
&gt; music, writing and computer games. He does not believe, however, that<br/>

&gt; &quot;If it was up to kids, half the time you know you wouldn&#39;t be allowed<br/>
&gt; to teach them anything,&quot; he explains. &quot;They don&#39;t understand how<br/>

&gt; enjoying it.&quot;<br/>

have to justify what was forced on them, really no different than what you<br/>

Absolutely.<br/>

They will believe that they never would have learned to read if their mom <br/>
hadn&#39;t taught them to, because their mom told them so.<br/>
