&gt; Sorry if I didn&#39;t express clearer.  My post began as a response to all the <br/>
&gt; posts on controlling food.  I ended with thinking about infants and feeding <br/>
&gt; schedules and remembered my friend was having a hard time adjusting to the same <br/>
&gt; topic, although starting with a 3 week old.  I figured I&#39;d ask the question <br/>
&gt; because it fell in with my line of thinking at the moment.  And she has not <br/>
&gt; yet decided to stay at home but has a big interest in unschooling.  She is in <br/>
&gt; more of a &quot;what do I do now that my baby is home&quot; frame of mind than <br/>
&gt; unschooling but her interest has been there throughout the pregnancy, so I thought <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d get her a bit of advice from a list I brag about and that she has enjoyed <br/>

eager to buck the mainstream and I tend to forget, sometimes, that not everyone <br/>
is like me! Thanks for the reminder!<br/>
