<div id="ygrps-yiv-119521757">For anyone of you who live near IN.  In Peru the International Circus <br/>
Hall of Fame resides.<br/>
<br/>
Peru is the winter headquarters for traveling circuses.  Summertime <br/>
brings circus performances from performers who are there enroute.  <br/>
<br/>
We headed there on Sat.  Now, I don&#39;t like the idea of animals caged <br/>
up generally:  but I have to say this was a fun day.  The animals <br/>
that were there are owned by a family from TX who provide Hollywood <br/>
with animals for their movies and TV shows.  They seemed well treated.<br/>
<br/>
We met several families who were there inbetween travelings.  They <br/>
stay in their RV&#39;s.  We watched them practice and got to try out <br/>
things if we wanted.<br/>
<br/>
The museum was rundown but they had a lot of info.<br/>
<br/>
It felt like a big camp for circus families.<br/>

<br/>
Keep in mind that only the humans performing in the circuses have chosen to <br/>
be there; not the animals.  They cannot chose.  The circuses will tell you <br/>
that they treat the animals well.  But, in order to get animals to perform <br/>
unnatural, silly, and scary tricks, other methods of &quot;training&quot; must be <br/>
used.  There are laws in place to protect the animals, but these laws are <br/>
hard to enforce and are generally weak.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not my intention to start a thread here on circuses and animal acts, <br/>
but since it was brought up, I can&#39;t let this go by.  I only ask that you <br/>
consider that when you support animal acts in circuses, you are more than <br/>
likely supporting cruelty.  It may not be what you wish to do.<br/>

Like I said I don&#39;t agree with the concept of animals caged.  And in <br/>
fact I haven&#39;t taken my children to any circuses that have come to <br/>
our city.<br/>
However, circuses have such a historical place in our country and in <br/>
fact seem to originate from the Romans.  We live so close to the <br/>
International Hall of Fame that it would be a shame to ignore this <br/>
part of history.<br/>
In fact we spend the whole day with the trainers and other performers <br/>
and really got to delve into their lifestyle.  It opened up many <br/>
topics and broadened my kids horizons.  Even into the question of <br/>
whether animals should be trained and kept in cages.<br/>
<br/>
The kids were able to relate to these topics b/c they have worked <br/>
hard to train our dog to do tricks.<br/>
<br/>
So while I don&#39;t agree with the methods that can be used, I also am <br/>
not going to completely shut off that opportunity for learning that <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331318508">Hi, Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the dialogue on this subject.  In fact, whenever the topic of <br/>
circuses comes up, I find that many people don&#39;t think about the animals <br/>
one way or the other.  It&#39;s easy, because circuses and animal exploitation <br/>
are such an intrinsic part of our culture, for us to overlook and be <br/>
desensitized to animal suffering.  That&#39;s why I took the opportunity to <br/>
point this out, not to point a finger at you, but to shine a little light <br/>
on a rather dark topic.  And, if there is anyone who never really thought <br/>
about it before, our discussion would give them a chance to think, and <br/>
maybe reconsider a choice.  Or at least just think about it.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, when circuses come to our town, my son and I do go, but we go to <br/>
demonstrate.  I think he&#39;s learning that we don&#39;t have to accept everything <br/>
that is put on our plates, and that if something looks amiss, we can <br/>
question it.  But, this is just our experience.<br/>
<br/>
I remember going to a circus in the 1960s when I was a little girl and <br/>
feeling very sad about the animals but not knowing why or what I could do <br/>
about it.  Everyone else there seemed so happy, I felt very peculiar and <br/>
strange.  As though something were wrong with me for feeling that way.  No <br/>
one was outside the circus protesting it.<br/>
<br/>
At the demonstrations there are always cars and minivans full of moms and <br/>
dads or grandmas and grandpas and kids in the back.  Most of the time, the <br/>
kids stare at us standing there with our signs trying to read them, but the <br/>
grownups rarely do.  The kids&#39; eyes are as wide as dinner plates and they <br/>
look serious.  It&#39;s interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks, Tina, for bring up this topic.  I do appreciate the <br/>
opportunity to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

Hey!  This has been interesting.  Like I said before, I haven&#39;t taken <br/>
my kids to the circuses when they have come thru.  Mainly, b/c deep <br/>
in my heart I was concerned about the animals also.  And I still am <br/>
concerned.  But I would venture to say that there is more to circuses <br/>
than the animals.  Perhaps you could even open the animal owners&#39; <br/>
eyes about their animals if you met them.<br/>
<br/>
  We walked and talked with the trainers and the performers.  We met <br/>
their children who homeschool (in a tutor type style) in RV&#39;s.    We <br/>
met and talked with a clown who made his electric car and costumes <br/>
from scratch.  We learned about their animals (at least this <br/>
family&#39;s) and the life style they lead in TX.<br/>
<br/>
So I would venture to say that your son could also learn alot from <br/>
these people.  They live such a different lifestyle from us ordinary <br/>
stationary home folks.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say there isn&#39;t animal abuse.  But these few families <br/>
we met really cared about their lifestyle and their animals.  They <br/>
worked hard to answer our questions and show us everything.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t trade that day for anything b/c my kids and I learned so <br/>
much. And who knows, maybe I&#39;ll take the kids to the circus someday <br/>
and see someone I know.  And I can check up on the animals also.<br/>

Hi, Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention that there is a list of animal-free circuses.  Included <br/>
are web sites and email addresses as well as phone numbers and <br/>
addresses.  The list is international, not just for the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.circuses.com/animalfree.html">http://www.circuses.com/animalfree.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Circuses are widely booked as fundraising events for local groups, and this <br/>
list may help someone choose a more compassionate route for their <br/>
fundraising activities.<br/>
<br/>
But, something else popped into my mind as I was writing this.  A few years <br/>
ago, a friend of ours invited us to go to the circus with her and her <br/>
daughter.  I told her that I could not go because of the animals, but I <br/>
felt that boycotting animal acts was something that Liam (my son) should <br/>
decide for himself.  He did go to the circus.  He did not like it.  It <br/>
never occurred to me at the time to protest against it.  I have since <br/>
become much more vocal about animal rights issues and other issues, <br/>
too.  Whenever I have gone to protest against the circus, I have not asked <br/>
him to come or told him that he had to or should come with me.  He wants to <br/>
come and he asks me.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me that--in every area--it is not what we say but what we do <br/>
that impacts our children.  This is truly awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an excellent question!  I cannot answer for others, only for <br/>
myself.  And, there are companion animals in our home.  We do not own them, <br/>
though; they aren&#39;t our property.  We have opened our home to these guys <br/>
because humans have domesticated cats and dogs and therefore, these animals <br/>
have become dependent on humans.  We are happy to care for them and we <br/>
expect nothing of them in return.  We do receive, though, a great deal of <br/>
love and affection which we gladly accept and return.  I have taken animal <br/>
communication courses in an attempt to better hear them (I&#39;m not real good <br/>
at it, though, but I&#39;m trying) and meet their needs.  I am honored to have <br/>
these beautiful creatures living with us.   By the way, neither do I kill <br/>
or injure the bugs and creepy-crawlies that have decided to make a home in <br/>
our building, although I do capture them, if necessary (like a bee, for <br/>
example), and relocate them to a place where they and we will be more <br/>
safe.  Same holds true for mice and voles that get into our house.  We do <br/>
take care of any animals, though, that may be injured or are obviously <br/>
orphaned and need care.<br/>
<br/>
As you might imagine, we are vegan in this home and we don&#39;t wear leather <br/>
or fur.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413189606">We have a dog and three cats.  We have had them neutered.  Seems cruel, and <br/>
it wasn&#39;t their choice, but we have.  And we register them with the city.  <br/>
Not every animal every year, but when vet&#39;s visits come along (if they do), <br/>
we renew tags.<br/>
<br/>
We do not keep the animals locked up.  Some people keep their cats in for the <br/>
cat&#39;s protection.  Some chain their dogs and leash them every second.<br/>
<br/>
We have a dog door.  We have a yard they can all get out of. <br/>
<br/>
They live here of their own free will.  One we paid $10 for (a reward) for a <br/>
family that had read our lost-cat ad.  It wasn&#39;t our cat, but it fit our lost <br/>
cat&#39;s description, and they couldn&#39;t keep it so my husband brought it home <br/>
and gave them a reward. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two were barn-cat rescues.  They probably would&#39;ve been shot if they&#39;d stayed <br/>
where they were, and they were wild and mean and full of ticks at first.<br/>
<br/>
The dog was gotten at the pound.  Her mom and other two, I hope, were adopted <br/>
by other families.  If not, they&#39;re part of a growing hill of ashes near the <br/>
gold course.<br/>
<br/>
SO.  If these animals want to move to another house with another family, they <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
If the dog feels unhappy and wants to run away, she can.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid we had a dog my parents NEVER let in the house, not a bit, <br/>
but we loved her and fed her well, and she stayed with us from the time I was <br/>
seven until I was 18 or 19.<br/>
<br/>
She came to us on her own, as a stray, and she stayed with us for her <br/>
lifetime, of her own free will.  We never owned a leash in all those years.  <br/>
She could leave the yard and come back.<br/>
<br/>
There are circus animals which are NOT treated cruelly in any way but are <br/>
loved by families whose family business has been for MANY generations the <br/>
training of animals to show to support their families.    Those people know <br/>
more about &quot;cognition&quot; and conditioning and psychology in natural practical <br/>
ways than many trained professionals do.  Their methods of &#39;gentling&#39; and <br/>
training are often more sound and less harmful than what is being done to <br/>
human children down the street from your house.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t condemn circuses.  Cruelty is bad, but circus does not equal cruelty.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the critical voices sometimes go on without really careful thought.  <br/>
Some of those animals would have been in much worse condition elsewhere.  An <br/>
American-born elephant which has grown up in a circus is no worse off than an <br/>
Indian-born elephant working in the logging or construction industry in <br/>
India.  Maybe much better off than an elephant in a zoo.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  By the way, neither do I kill <br/>
or injure the bugs and creepy-crawlies that have decided to make a home in <br/>
our building, although I do capture them, if necessary (like a bee, for <br/>
example), and relocate them to a place where they and we will be more <br/>
safe.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I relocate cockroaches to heaven, or perhaps speed them along their journey <br/>
to karmic enlightenment.  I always think as they leave &quot;Better life next <br/>
time, bug!&quot;  I never wear any clothing made of the exoskeletons of <br/>
cockroaches, though.<br/>

would be able to be vocal there.  Cruelty against animals in one place does <br/>
not justify cruelty in another place.  Two wrongs don&#39;t make a right.<br/>

Why wouldn&#39;t that apply to people then as well?  A sad cat is only sad for a <br/>
few years and doesn&#39;t make many other cats miserable.<br/>
<br/>
A sad human, though--that can last 75 years and four or five generations.  In <br/>
the face of the sorrow of the world, of abuse and neglect and bad genetics, <br/>
why aren&#39;t sterilization and abortion moral virtues?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s that soul thing...<br/>

<br/>
Allowing humans to proliferate unchecked puts me and my children at risk in <br/>
the already overburdened world.<br/>

Philosophical points shouldn&#39;t be seen in isolation from parallel points two <br/>
degrees to the side of them, I think.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No, I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m thinking of particular individuals, one I met (who was <br/>
umpty-generation circus from Rumania or thereabout, and trained dogs and <br/>
monkeys) and others about whom I&#39;ve read in the past when I was looking into <br/>
learning and conditioning.   <br/>
<br/>
Some people are mean to their pets.  That&#39;s a crime.<br/>
Some people are mean to animals they&#39;re training.  That&#39;s a crime.<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t mean there should be no pets and there should be no trained <br/>
animals.<br/>
