I guess I&#39;ve always heard it as a put-down too. That&#39;s why I was surprised <br/>
to see someone identifying their style as unparenting. I&#39;ll stick with <br/>
mindful parenting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is precisely how I use the term. I don&#39;t find it derogatory. Its a <br/>
way to explain a lifestyle that always was in our lives. Trust, respect, <br/>
democratic, no big people get to coerce, manipulate or require the medium <br/>
and little ones.<br/>
