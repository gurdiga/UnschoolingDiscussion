<div id="ygrps-yiv-887687852">Hey, Yol.. I read the articles and posts concerning the Bryant family.  It is <br/>
indeed tragic and scary too.   I wondered what kind of &quot;education plan&quot; they <br/>
came up with and why it was rejected.   <br/>
<br/>
It may be just you and me on this group.. lol.. Seems everyone else has <br/>
disappeared..I wonder if they found a new &quot;watering hole&quot; ..<br/>

The case wasn&#39;t really about homeschooling. They used unschooling to make a<br/>
point about their views on how the only legal authority is the state<br/>
constitution. They insisted the state had no authority to ask for an<br/>
education plan because of the wording of the constitution.<br/>
<br/>
Standing up for constitutional rights is a good thing :-) But submitting an<br/>
education plan isn&#39;t much of a burden so in essence they were using it as a<br/>
lever to get their constitutionalist views heard in court.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to do my state duty and read the state HSing legal list -- it had<br/>
split off from the main list to basically give a forum for the Bryant case<br/>
-- but every time I tuned in Kim never discussed issues or bureaucratic<br/>
injustices for people to rally around. Every post came around to how the<br/>
constitution said the state couldn&#39;t do what it was trying to do.<br/>

<br/>
I understand what you&#39;re saying but it seems to me that in this case the <br/>
court was giving the school comittee total control over hsing with no <br/>
legal ground. Or am I misunderstanding the case?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are no homeschooling laws in MA. Homeschooling procedures are based on<br/>
the judges&#39; rulings on two cases: &quot;Charles&quot; and &quot;Brunelle&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There are bits that are open to interpretation, and, as in most states,<br/>
there are superintendents that ask more than the (case) law permits. But<br/>
overall the language emphasizes parental rights over state rights and the<br/>
need for the state to *prove* -- not just say -- that what the parents<br/>
propose is inadequate before refusing to grant approval to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
The requirements don&#39;t interfere with unschooling. We have to send in an Ed<br/>
plan. (I use Carol Narigon&#39;s.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html)">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html)</a> And then superintendents<br/>
can ask for a form of evaluation that is agreeable with the parents. I send<br/>
in a few sentences indicating progress in each subject.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s clear that the Bryants could argue that the state doesn&#39;t have any<br/>
legal right to ask anything if there are no laws. (And apparently their<br/>
stance was the only laws binding are the state constitution.) But if what<br/>
the state asks isn&#39;t burdensome then fighting against it becomes, in my mind<br/>
and in the minds of many MA homeschoolers, a matter of legal principle<br/>
rather than homeschooling principle.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And that even after the case was dismissed at some point the school<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My understanding -- and it could be off (since the case was long, drawn out<br/>
and frankly boring) but seems to jive with others&#39; understandings -- is that<br/>
the school board asked for an ed plan and the Bryants refused claiming the<br/>
board had no right to ask. It gets a bit gray on who to believe after that.<br/>
There was some legal wrangling over a couple of years and the Bryants said<br/>
they submitted a plan and the board said they either didn&#39;t or that it was<br/>
inadequate. Since it stretched over a few years the Bryants obviously owed a<br/>
number of ed plans and if they were submitting a plan that was asked for 2<br/>
years previous and not for the current year then they can say they submitted<br/>
a plan and the school board can both say they didn&#39;t and that it was<br/>
inadequate. I don&#39;t know that that is what happened but it&#39;s plausible<br/>
because it should be so simple for the Bryants to come out publicly and<br/>
present what they submitted and when to show how unreasonable the town was<br/>
being. But they never did. It was just a bunch of &quot;Yes we did&quot;s and &quot;No they<br/>
didn&#39;t&quot;s. The Bryants were eventually taken to court and they lost. They<br/>
appealed. They lost again. And DSS got involved and the children came under<br/>
state protection but remained in the custody of their parents.<br/>
<br/>
There were obviously things going on that those outside the case don&#39;t have<br/>
knowledge of that were affecting the decisions being made and what was being<br/>
said. All I know is that throughout the whole mess the Bryants weren&#39;t<br/>
nearly as clear about what they had done and the timing of it as they were<br/>
about their claims that the school board was harassing them and about their<br/>
stance on the state constitutuion and legal issues.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just being skeptical. There isn&#39;t enough information to say who is right<br/>
and who is wrong. But what little information there is -- especially since<br/>
it&#39;s mostly the Bryants version of what was going on -- doesn&#39;t add up<br/>
clearly to a homeschooling family being wronged by the school board. There<br/>
may be things that would explain why it looks that way. But the information<br/>
just isn&#39;t there.<br/>
