children with their English assignments at the St Pierre Hospital down <br/>
the road from us - located on the beach in Palavas.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the hospitalized children meet in a classroom to do their<br/>
homework that is sent to them from their schools.  Some of the<br/>
children appeared very advanced in English - according to the work <br/>
they were doing - reading essays - or excerpts from movie scripts<br/>
or poems - answering questions of grammar and so on. <br/>
<br/>
Conversation?  They were totally lost.  No outline. No questions.<br/>
Nothing to refer to...What&#39;s up?<br/>
<br/>
So I helped them with their work - proofread stuff - followed the<br/>
stinking program.  We also did spoke of some stories we all knew.<br/>
We began conversations and stories without any testing or &quot;ulterior<br/>
motives&quot;.  It was fun. They opened up and had a fun time - laughing<br/>
at the funny &#39;misunderstandings&#39; and silly &#39;errors&#39; that popped up. <br/>
Some were hilarious. There was nothing waiting at the end of the <br/>
line - no grade.  The learning came from learning it freely and <br/>
going with it wherever it went.  This is the &quot;air&quot; that is necessary <br/>
for *retaining* knowledge - knowledge that someone chooses to seek out<br/>
on their own accord because they want to know and are enjoying the<br/>
process of coming to know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder often about these &quot;teaching methods&quot; of foreign language. <br/>
So much stress on grammar and usage and written word - and translation -<br/>
with little attention to using and listening to the language. It is <br/>
ridiculous and competes with grasping the meaning of the words - the<br/>
language.  Listening and eventually participating in real live <br/>
conversatation - watching movies, perhaps - and totally immersing <br/>
oneself in a language by hearing and living it is the way to learning <br/>
and knowing another language.  Leaving the dreaded grammar and the <br/>
written word aside or using it to support understanding/reading without <br/>
it being the main focal point is what facilitates *understanding*. <br/>
<br/>
Those &quot;advanced&quot; English students at the hospital were totally lost <br/>
without their curriculum and papers and they understood very little <br/>
English.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a shame - and just about no one realizes why.<br/>

<br/>
Ah yes, I agree completely.  Grammar and writing are when someone, at <br/>
whatever point in her life, wishes to &quot;study&quot; a second language.  Not, in my <br/>
opinion, for young ones.  <br/>
<br/>
We have an interesting situation at home.  Speaking French when we can.  My <br/>
husband does not, my oldest has chosen French as her second language of <br/>
choice.  My six year old is a star in her German class.  So, we do what we <br/>
can with speaking French at home, and I am desperately trying to keep up with <br/>
Carolyn&#39;s German!<br/>
