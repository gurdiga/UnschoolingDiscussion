<div id="ygrps-yiv-849979492">I just wanted to share something I observed my 5yo dd<br/>
do today. We had sat down to each lunch together (rare<br/>
treat kids are usually much to busy to do so lately)<br/>
Dd said ya know 2 and 2 and 1 make 5.  I was floored<br/>
wow math. While she was doing this she was rocking<br/>
back and forth on her knees.  She was constantly in<br/>
motion while describing simple math problems and also<br/>
asking me how to spell several words. I also remember <br/>
when she wanted me to scribe some stories she made up.<br/>
 She recited the stories nad I wrote them down while<br/>
she was dancing around the room. She could not sit<br/>
still.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876719345">I know this is an old post but I just found it again,<br/>
and my 5 yr old ds does the same thing with the math.<br/>
But it is like it&#39;s easier for him to get it that way.<br/>
I can ask him &quot;what&#39;s 4 plus 1 plus 2?&quot; and he&#39;ll<br/>
answer almost immediately &quot;seven.&quot; but if I say<br/>
&quot;what&#39;s 4 plus 3?&quot; he has to think about it and count<br/>
to himself for a second. hm.<br/>
just thought I&#39;d share. <br/>
