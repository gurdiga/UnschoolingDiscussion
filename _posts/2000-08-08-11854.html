<div id="ygrps-yiv-570891031">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
For those who haven&#39;t already seen this, here&#39;s a recent news article <br/>
concerning Japan&#39;s rising numbers of school-refusing students.<br/>
<br/>
All of the major Japanese news media released these figures -- which, <br/>
since they come from the Ministry of Education, means they are probably <br/>
conservative estimates. And for those hardy souls who manage to get <br/>
themselves all the way through the Japanese educational system, there&#39;s <br/>
no longer even a guarantee they&#39;ll get a job.<br/>
<br/>
When your local media runs news stories on how Japan is the &quot;educational <br/>
role model of the world&quot; or some such nonsense, lay a few of these <br/>
numbers on &#39;em....<br/>

130,000 in 1999-2000<br/>
TRUANCY REACHES RECORD HIGH<br/>
<br/>
More than 130,000 elementary and junior high school students were truant <br/>
for 30 or more school days during the 1999-2000 academic year, according <br/>
to an Education Ministry survey released Friday.<br/>
<br/>
A total of 130,208 students missed school without permission between <br/>
April 1999 and March this year, up about 2,500, or 2 percent, from the <br/>
previous academic year and the most since the statistics were first taken <br/>
in the 1991-1992 year.                                   <br/>
<br/>
The rate of increase in the number of absentees slowed significantly, <br/>
however, from the more than 10 percent rises posted in the three <br/>
consecutive years starting with the 1996-1997 year.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The rate of truancy at schools where they have counselors is low,&quot; the <br/>
ministry said.<br/>
<br/>
Some 104,000 junior high school students -- up 2.4 percent from the <br/>
1998-1999 year -- and about 26,000 elementary school students -- an <br/>
increase of 0.1 percent -- were found in the survey to have missed 30 or <br/>
more school days.<br/>
<br/>
The figures correspond to 2.45 percent of all junior high school students <br/>
in Japan -- one in every 41 -- meaning roughly one student in each class <br/>
refused to attend school. One of the reasons often cited is bullying by <br/>
other students.<br/>
<br/>
The figure for elementary school students was 0.35 percent, according to <br/>
the survey.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the number of people who neither landed full-time jobs nor <br/>
continued their education after graduating from high school, junior <br/>
college or university increased to about 295,000, due in part to the <br/>
continuing economic recession.<br/>
<br/>
About 121,000 graduates from universities, 42,000 from junior colleges <br/>
and 132,000 from high schools were in this category.<br/>
<br/>
The employment rate of new university graduates dropped 4.3 percentage <br/>
points to a record low 55.8 percent, with only 301,000 out of the 539,000 <br/>
graduates taking full-time jobs and with many of the remaining students <br/>
continuing on to graduate school.<br/>
<br/>
Between 30 percent and 40 percent of the combined 163,000 university and <br/>
junior college graduates who neither landed full-time jobs nor continued <br/>
on to graduate school went to vocational schools, indicating a growing <br/>
number of youths are hoping to gain special qualifications to help in <br/>
their search for work.<br/>
