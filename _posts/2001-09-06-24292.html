&lt;&lt; They would say, &quot;John, will you put the apple in the garbage?&quot;<br/>
  If he&#39;s defiant, the teacher would say, &quot;You have a choice to either put<br/>
 the apple in the garbage or sit down in the hall, which do you choose?&quot; <br/>
 That way the child has a feeling of control, so it takes away the need to<br/>
 rebel.  Rebellion is a result of a feeling of powerlessness.  Choice<br/>
 gives the child power.<br/>
 I don&#39;t know if any of this helps.  I know it&#39;s a good reminder for me.<br/>

trouble.Right. Reminds me of the 123 concept. Count to 3 then what? The child <br/>
pushes to 3 then gets in trouble. Not very productive or empowering. Working <br/>
together to solve issues empowers them for their future interactions w/ <br/>
others. Would you tell your dh to throw out the apple or sit on the sofa? No <br/>
I&#39;d ask dh to please throw away his garbage to help me out. I do not have my <br/>
dd do chores. Yet we just came home from ballet and she began wiping up the <br/>
dog paw prints and juice stickies all on her own. She also volunteers to take <br/>
the garbage out. Kinda like I never taught her manners but b/c in this house <br/>
we ask kindly and use please and thank you very regularly she picked it up. I <br/>
rarely if ever have to remind her to say please. To me this is all tied <br/>
together. When things get overly controling or bossy around here I can step <br/>
back and see it started w/ one of us. She is reflecting. So we stop,look, and <br/>
recharge. Back to being positive and life runs smoother around here.<br/>

prove it - that it wasn&#39;t done!  They took it off the bill.<br/>
We saw one being done when our first daughter was born.  That was enough<br/>
to make us decide never to allow that to be done to one of ours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163235463">Yes, I totally agree that positive is so much better than negative.  That<br/>
is what is so much better about being at home, you can take the time and<br/>
learn from a real conversation instead of resorting to mere crowd<br/>
control.  However, if you are managing a group and give a child an<br/>
option, it makes it easier for all than just giving a demand, and if the<br/>
child says &quot;neither,&quot; then they get to choose something else or discuss<br/>
something else with the leader of the group.  When I talk about methods<br/>
for making kids mind, it is usually in response to a child who already is<br/>
being rebellious, not just opinionated.  Some children will test your<br/>
boundaries deliberately.  My children don&#39;t but I have had to be in<br/>
charge of other children who do, some by outright defiance.  For example,<br/>
if you have a child who is breaking things, you had better show them that<br/>
they do not have the liberty to do that or they will continue to do so. <br/>
They are crying out for some attention, for someone to give them a safe<br/>
boundary.  And once they are shown that you mean business, they stop and<br/>
treat you with respect.  But what I said was something that happens in<br/>
ps, in response to people talking about yelling or spanking, etc. <br/>
Personally, I think if there are behavior challenges, it is usually<br/>
because someone isn&#39;t being listened to, or allowed to just &quot;be&quot;, or<br/>
given enough real interaction, or fatigue or hunger, or boredom.  When I<br/>
get in the middle of a room and say, &quot;Let&#39;s clean up together&quot; or we go<br/>
in the kitchen and everyone does their part together to wash, dry, put<br/>
away, we have a great talk while we work together and it is fun.  <br/>
