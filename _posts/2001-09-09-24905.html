<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089959638">If I were seriously concerned that a person in my family were actually addicted<br/>
to something, I don&#39;t think I could in good faith have it in the home, even if<br/>
other family members like it.<br/>
<br/>
How could I allow this person to see everyone else in the family enjoying it,<br/>
and not want it?<br/>
<br/>
Does this sound cruel to anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
Not attacking, just confused. If it&#39;s really an addiction, like alcohol, why the<br/>
different treatment?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439739421">But the people who think it is an addiction are who I&#39;m addressing. They<br/>
think the guy&#39;s got an addiction, and they&#39;re essentially saying, &quot;but *we*<br/>
like rum and gin so we keep it around the house. Then we let him have a taste<br/>
because he likes it so much, but too much is bad for him, so we snatch the<br/>
bottle away before he can hurt himself.&quot;<br/>

obsessive-compulsive disorder.  <br/>
Wyndham also does the scratch and sniff maneuver - scratch back of head<br/>
and smell fingers compulsively.  We don;t know why but it is harmless so<br/>
we don&#39;t pick about it.  We do stop him from picking his arms open until<br/>
they bleed, another frequent one for him.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435782305">Sharon, Is that a joke?  I wasn&#39;t sure if you were serious or not,<br/>
because I was a real book worm growing up, and as a young mother, I would<br/>
do nothing but read all day long.  So I told myself there was more out<br/>
there to discover and put a limit on my fiction, and only read non<br/>
fiction that I felt would improve me somehow.  I followed that diet for<br/>
about five years, and I have a larger sphere of experience now.  I can<br/>
get through the day without reading anything if I want now.  But I had to<br/>
discover that for myself.  Bonni<br/>
P.S.  Oh, I see that you were joking.  How embarrassing:}</div>

Have you considered Tourette&#39;s??? It presesnts in an<br/>
infinit variety of tics. Scratch and sniff is pretty<br/>
common. Tourette&#39;s often shows up in OCD families. <br/>
There is a genetic relationship to both disorders. <br/>
Meds, therapy, and support groups DO help.  <br/>
