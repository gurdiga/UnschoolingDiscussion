&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can you help me? I just found out that someone that matters to me is pagan<br/>
&gt; (Wiccan), and I don&#39;t know what to/not to do or say. That is, I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; what he would consider offensive, or just plain stupid. I said to one pagan<br/>
&gt; friend &quot;I guess you don&#39;t do Easter eggs&quot; and found out later how truly<br/>
&gt; stupid that probably sounded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m interested, but not interested enough to read a book, so book<br/>
&gt; recommendations probably won&#39;t help. ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Basically, I want the FAQ. Not that I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s a devil-worshipper, or<br/>
&gt; anything, just totally in the dark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; TIA<br/>

Honestly, I know a few pagans, none of which are offended by anything; <br/>
however they are put off as I am too(not affiliated with any religion), by <br/>
anyone who is not willing to make the mental effort to understand, therefore <br/>
respect another&#39;s perspective.<br/>

Why don&#39;t you go over to the ManyPaths list (its on egroups) and ask there.<br/>
 It is an eclectic bunch that are about half Pagan and/or Wiccan.  They<br/>
could give you some real insite on this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555368297">Try the Pagan University at my email home Idahopagan.com.  They have frequently asked questions and their answers.  You can also try doing a search to find out information about our major holidays, the sabbats (quarter and cross-quarter days) and how they are observed and celebrated.  Yes, we do Easter eggs.  Egg rolling and egg dying are much older than Judeo-Christian religion, as is the origins of the name &quot;Easter&quot; and the concept of rebirth in the Spring.  You will find, upon studying, that all the world&#39;s major religions have influenced each other a great deal in practice, tradition and history.  Many of our sabbats can be easily recognized in modern holidays (secular and non-secular) and modern themes and traditions.  <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite pagan authors is: &quot;All the gods are one God, and all the goddesses are one Goddess.  And to every man his own truth, and the god within.&quot;  Just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so too is truth found within.  I begrudge no person their version of the truth, as I believe that our diety speaks to each of us in our hearts and leads us in our manner of worship and belief.  I also believe that diety is the same one for everyone, but that they have many aspects, many faces.  For each of us, in each lifetime, the face of divinity shown to us is the one most appropriate for us at that time.  Who, among us, is so righteous and supreme as to say which is correct?  I believe that all religions based on principles of goodness are correct, and we should rejoice in our richness and learn from each other.<br/>
