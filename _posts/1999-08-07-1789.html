&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just wanted to add another resource for people with &quot;active&quot;<br/>
&gt; learners. Howard Gardner wrote several books about different<br/>
&gt; intelligences and how the different intelligences learn. It is<br/>
&gt; slowly making its way through the ps system and hopefully things<br/>
&gt; will change, but his books are interesting to read. According to his<br/>
&gt; theory, it sounds like your children are kinesthetic learners, they<br/>
&gt; have to be physically active in order to absorb information and<br/>
&gt; learn. He lays out 7 total intelligences and they make sense. I<br/>
&gt; think that even 7 is too limiting;) but at least it is a start.<br/>

the following link very useful!  To my surprise, Sterling&#39;s results <br/>
showed his secondary learning style as Physical.  I expected that one <br/>
to come out as his primary.  Then i expected his secondary to be a <br/>
toss-up between several.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
