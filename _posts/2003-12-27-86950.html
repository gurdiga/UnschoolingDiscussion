I deleted too quickly and don&#39;t remember who mentioned it -- but I&#39;d love to <br/>
hear more about the Texas study on how people reach goals. <br/>
<br/>
Seems like that study might be linked to this business of what motivates <br/>
people to be early or late -- maybe. <br/>

It was the appalling idea of letting down the entire school if I was not<br/>
there. The &quot;insurmountable misadventures&quot; (fantastic phrase!) just<br/>
evaporated. I actually became so anxious to be on time, that I was generally<br/>
extra early. I guess there had never been a reason I cared about to just be<br/>
on time to deadly dull but compulsory assembly each day.<br/>

&lt;&lt;That&#39;s interesting. So what was it in the new arrangement that got you<br/>
there <br/>
on time? Suddenly you were able to plan ahead, or whatever was required, to <br/>
overcome the previously insurmountable misadventures. How come?&gt;&gt;<br/>
