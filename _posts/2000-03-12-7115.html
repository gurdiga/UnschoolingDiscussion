<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045714858">Hi Melanie!<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you have the right idea for entertaining Mook at mealtime. <br/>
My 17 month old only just started eating some table food with us about 3<br/>
months ago.  He may have had the odd bite of bread or potato or other<br/>
tidbit around 12 months.  Prior to his steady interest and readiness for<br/>
table food, (no pablum or baby jars for us either!) he was always very<br/>
insistent to have a utensil of some sort to at least feel he was doing<br/>
what we were doing.  The chopsticks are great.  A plastic cup or spoon<br/>
or even a cloth napkin might also entertain the baby at family meal<br/>
time.<br/>

&gt; OK, so maybe I didn&#39;t make myself very clear.  I&#39;m not worried that<br/>
&gt; Rachel isn&#39;t getting enough to eat.  I know I have enough milk for her.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s not particularly hungry at the dinner table, she just wants to<br/>
&gt; participate in something the rest of the family is obviously enjoying.<br/>
&gt; I was also wondering if maybe her body requirements - since she is so<br/>
&gt; big - are not satisfied by breastmilk alone.  Like, I&#39;ve heard (T or F?)<br/>
&gt; that a one year old needs different nutrients than a newborn, so I was<br/>
&gt; wondreing if that&#39;s because of size.  With Mook, we used a blender, and<br/>
&gt; never bought baby food.  He&#39;s so healthy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The special toy at dinnertime was a good idea.  I let her chew on the<br/>
&gt; tips (I was holding them) of some clean chopsticks.  She LOVED that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m also VERY interested in herbs, essential oils, and making soap,<br/>
&gt; candles, etc.  Somebody (sorry - I forgot who) posted a vegetarian soap<br/>
&gt; making site (sunsoap.com), so I visited it, and got really interested.<br/>
&gt; When we settle down (we&#39;ll be moving three times in three months!), I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; going to start making soaps and growing herbs, etc.<br/>

solids. I&#39;ve met mothers of small babies who said their babies were<br/>
&quot;too&quot; small and must need solids. Then the mothers of medium babies<br/>
start them on solids because everyone else is, so it must be necessary,<br/>
lol! Seriously, if your child is thriving, healthy, meeting milestones,<br/>
bright and active and gaining weight then she is fine. I would not start<br/>
a child on solids this early simply because they are big and they watch<br/>
you eat. But this is totally your decision! That&#39;s just my fanatical<br/>
breastfeeding mom opinion :-)<br/>
<br/>
Like, I&#39;ve heard (T or F?)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you mean? Your breastmilk at one year post partum has<br/>
less fat in it (not NO fat, just LESS fat then in the beginning). Some<br/>
solid and formula pushers will tell you that this is because it is<br/>
inferior and you should supplement, but really it&#39;s because a one year<br/>
old does not need to grow as quickly as a newborn and nature knows what<br/>
it&#39;s doing. But otherwise, breastmilk has the same vitamins and minerals<br/>
it always did (and antibodies). It does not change due to the size of<br/>
the baby, but due to the length of time post partum. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some LLL links if you are interested. This one<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NB6.4.90.1.html">http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NB6.4.90.1.html</a> talks about all the<br/>
aspects of extended nursing but has these two quotes which may be of<br/>
interest to you <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Research has shown that second-year milk is very similar to the<br/>
first-year milk nutritionally (Victora, 1984). Even after two years or<br/>
more it continues to be a valuable source of protein, fat, calcium, and<br/>
vitamins (Jelliffe and Jelliffe, 1978). &quot; <br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A third health benefit is avoidance of allergies. It is well documented<br/>
that the later that cow&#39;s milk and other common allergens are introduced<br/>
into the diet of a baby, the less likelihood there is of allergic<br/>
reactions (Savilahti, 1987). &quot; <br/>
<br/>
Like someone else (?) said starting a young baby on solids is a crap<br/>
shoot. If you start your child early there may indeed be no<br/>
repercussions. But you won&#39;t know that until you do. And many food<br/>
allergies do not get diagnosed as such. Often moms start the young baby<br/>
on solids and then do not connect this to certain problems that crop up<br/>
(fussiness, asthma, etc.). However, there are many babies who start<br/>
solids as early as a few weeks old with no side effects! I would<br/>
definitely NOT recommend this tho. But starting the child when she is<br/>
truely ready is the best bet. <br/>
<br/>
This one <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NBMayJun99p86.html">http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NBMayJun99p86.html</a> talks about<br/>
readiness for solids. Different children are ready for solids at<br/>
different times so yes, your child may indeed be ready. Obviously, we<br/>
can&#39;t see her in action, but from what you&#39;ve written, it sounds to me<br/>
like she is not ready (JMO of course!). You can always try if you really<br/>
believe she is ready and if she spits it out, back off and stop giving<br/>
her the solids. It&#39;s not like once you try solids you HAVE to continue.<br/>
Anyway, good luck with this decision. <br/>
