<div id="ygrps-yiv-122028420">My oldest (17) took a job at King&#39;s Island Amusement Park this summer. It pays better <br/>
than his last job and he has the advantage of a free pass. But it turns out to be a miserable <br/>
job. The hours are tough (last night he got in at 1 a.m. and this morning was scheduled to <br/>
be there at 7 a.m.) and he doesn&#39;t like the work (he works in a cafeteria). It&#39;s mind-<br/>
numbing.<br/>
<br/>
He is trying to save for a car and is halfway there.<br/>
<br/>
I hate seeing him miserable in his job. I&#39;ve suggested switching posts there (he has looked <br/>
into it, but he&#39;s in the highest paying post right now). He would be interested in switching <br/>
but there&#39;s a chance they can&#39;t move him.<br/>
<br/>
He has worked in food before and is tired of it. But he also doesn&#39;t see what other job <br/>
possiblities there are for him that aren&#39;t as dull and tedious as this one.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas of how to find a paying job for a kid who has a very active mind life? He gets to <br/>
volunteer at the local Shakespeare camp and if that paid, he&#39;d have done that instead for <br/>
three weeks. As it is, he is skipping work to do it for one week (with my blessing and <br/>
permission from his job).<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading _Child&#39;s Work_ by Nancy Wallace and thinking that my kids might be <br/>
able to work in areas they love rather than the typical fast food and lawn mowing. But <br/>
we&#39;re having trouble figuring out how to do that and what to look for.<br/>
<br/>
Advice welcome!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962720438">Are there kids in your neighbourhood?  People who<br/>
might be interested in learning basic computer skills<br/>
and/or ASL?  He could flyer advertising child care<br/>
(under $10 an hour to babysit isn&#39;t even heard of<br/>
anymore these days, so the money&#39;s good) or teaching<br/>
various skills, whether to kids or older folks.  Folks<br/>
of any age could very well be interested in learning<br/>
computer skills, whether word processing or basic<br/>
internet use or what have you.  He could also work as<br/>
a tutor for schooled kids and even teenagers,<br/>
discussing literature with the older set to help with<br/>
reading for comprehension and so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195534383">The only thing I can suggest is to look at www.playbill.com . They have a<br/>
job postings area, that around about now tends to have lots of summer camp<br/>
jobs in theater related camps or drama positions at other camps. They always<br/>
list whether the job is paid or not, so there is less time wasting.<br/>
<br/>
So much that is theater related is working for free. The best advice I can<br/>
give to someone wanting to be in that industry is: if you must intern, do so<br/>
at the largest, most prestigious, highest quality company that you can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805779185">This is a topic that we have struggled with here with my teens. <br/>
<br/>
Sky (20) just recently quit his job at a local adventure company which is a<br/>
great place, but his job was shuttling people to trailheads and kayak<br/>
put-in places. . .not very inspiring. But, for a couple of years of<br/>
part-time work, which paid for him to travel a great deal, he stuck with<br/>
it. Then, it finally hit him just a few weeks ago that this was not<br/>
anything which really spoke to him, nor made his heart sing, nor stimulated<br/>
him in any real way. So, he and I talked about it at length and he quit. He<br/>
decided that the idea of working with kids appealed to him and so he put<br/>
together a summer adventure camp for young kids . . . music, games, crafts,<br/>
and such . . . and got 6 kids enrolled at $200 each for a five week<br/>
program, two days a week! He is thrilled and is doing a theme each week -<br/>
pirates, knights, wizards, etc. Today was his first day and it was a total<br/>
hit! <br/>
<br/>
Nell (17) has done similar camps here for little girls in past summers - as<br/>
drama camps . . . her heartsong. Also very lucrative.<br/>
<br/>
Bay (13) has just landed a job helping a local guy who runs motocross tours<br/>
for visitors - he&#39;s washing and assisting in maintenance on the dirtbikes<br/>
(his passion).<br/>
<br/>
But, all of my teens are insistent that the work be relevant to them, which<br/>
I admire and support. I never really thought that way until I was much<br/>
older! I applaud their attitude. <br/>
<br/>
So, for your son -<br/>
computer tutoring for others kids<br/>
camp (like above) for kids<br/>
drama assistant director (anything in your area?)<br/>
<br/>
Just my rambling for the moment - hope it is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks to everyone for your terrific suggestions. Leonie, this sounds awesome. I need to <br/>
see if we have something like this locally.<br/>
<br/>
I also like the day camp suggestions too. I&#39;m concerned we may be too late this season, <br/>
but you never know.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, the amusement park staff added an &quot;I sign&quot; to his nametag so that hard of <br/>
hearing customers can come to him for help. He was elated. I can see that he needs to be <br/>
in some kind of people service to thrive.<br/>
<br/>
The above suggestions sound like a good fit.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again. This list is so terrific.<br/>
