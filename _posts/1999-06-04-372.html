Personally, I was hoping that unschooling could mean that I do whatever works <br/>
for me and mine.  Workbooks - yes.  Walks in the woods - yes.  Well, that&#39;s <br/>
what we&#39;ve been doing anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re &quot;total unschoolers&quot; as well.  Of course, this is according to our own<br/>
definition:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Schooling:  the process by which a predetermined (and often arbitrary)<br/>
set<br/>
of learning goals/outcomes is reached using predetermined (and often<br/>
arbitrary)  standardized curriculum administered by an authority figure<br/>
to<br/>
target groups of students sorted largely by chronological age.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling:  the process by which a person acquires specific and<br/>
non-specific skills and information as determined by the needs and<br/>
interests of the person(s) doing the learning and by methods suited to<br/>
and chosen by those doing the learning.  A lot of unschooling learning is<br/>
intrinsic, and some of the learning is often also accomplished by more<br/>
&quot;traditional&quot; methods, but the what, how,<br/>
when ,where , and why are determined by the learner and his/her goals<br/>
rather than a bureaucrat in a government office, or a curriculum designer who has<br/>
never met my<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the process by which an individual learns to take<br/>
responsibility for his/her learning and his/her life, which should<br/>
(ideally) be one and the same.<br/>
