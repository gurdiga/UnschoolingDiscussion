<div id="ygrps-yiv-451554596">Sandra&#39;s post about Kirby in college English made me think a bit about the issues of how <br/>
we might encourage our kids to grow in the mechanics of writing without resorting to <br/>
schoolish tactics of spelling tests (horrid things), forced writing or laborious work sheets.<br/>
<br/>
When a child loves to draw, we don&#39;t immediately intervene and suggest how to fix the <br/>
wrong lines or say how what is drawn doesn&#39;t resemble the object drawn. We usually <br/>
praise what we see as an act of self-expression and then stick the picture on the <br/>
refrigerator with a magnet.<br/>
<br/>
If the child continues to show interest, you might enroll her in an art class at some point <br/>
(to develop some of the skills that make drawing more pleasurable and to learn other <br/>
media). Or you might purchase an art book or drawing book like _Drawing on the Right <br/>
Side of the Brain_ to help a stuck child (a child who suddenly hates that her work doesn&#39;t <br/>
look like the item she wants to draw) to get over the hump.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, writing has been so ruined in school for so many of us, that unschoolers <br/>
are often reluctant to give the same kind of support to the growing interest in writing that <br/>
kids exhibit. Growing as a writer doesn&#39;t have to be schoolish at all!<br/>
<br/>
But learning a bit about how to use punctuation, discovering new ways to write interesting <br/>
openings for a live journal or a story, understanding how to create vivid word pictures or <br/>
analogiesÂ—these skills enhance the enjoyment of writing as well as the sense of <br/>
achievement in the finished product.<br/>
<br/>
My own approach to writing with my kids has been focused on supporting their forays into <br/>
writing (not creating artificial writing assignments). We&#39;ve done lots of freewriting, we&#39;ve <br/>
kept copywork books (where you write down your favorite poetry, song lyrics, passages <br/>
from books that you want to keep, refrigerator magnet quotes, etc.) and we&#39;ve written <br/>
stories and keep live journals and send letters and all kinds of stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done a variety of dictation styles with interested kids (only the ones who enjoy it) <br/>
drawn from books they love to read. I even make my own dictation sheets called reverse <br/>
dictation where I leave all the punctuation out of the passage, misspell a few words and let <br/>
the kids try to edit the page. They get a penny for every correction they make that works. <br/>
(They love this.) The problem with dictation is if it becomes a rigid practice that is &quot;done&quot; <br/>
to the child rather than the fun of having this puzzle called &quot;a written passage&quot; that is <br/>
needing punctuation supplied by an interested child. It ought to be a game, not a <br/>
discipline.<br/>
<br/>
We also pay twenty-five cents to any kid who finds a typo in printed matter (local <br/>
newspapers can cost you quite a bit, lol). It keeps them attentive to what they read and <br/>
they love to &quot;catch&quot; errors made by paid professionals.<br/>
<br/>
Language and grammar and punctuation are games in our house and part of becoming a <br/>
literate adult. But there is nothing heavy-handed about it. It&#39;s as natural as supplying new <br/>
art pencils and paper, models and still lifes to draw. It&#39;s as natural as playing games that <br/>
capitalize on math skills or scientific principles.<br/>
