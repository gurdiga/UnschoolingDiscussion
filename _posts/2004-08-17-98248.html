<div id="ygrps-yiv-126435503">Yeah, I know its bad grammar!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember who I told what too so if you ain&#39;t interested or <br/>
have heard me moan on then delete delete delete.<br/>
<br/>
Celyn started having seizures at 9 weeks old. They turned out to be a <br/>
severe form of epilepsy called &#39;infantile spasms&#39; which lead to <br/>
mental retardation. Off she went to hospital to start drugs. Drug <br/>
number 1 didn&#39;t work. Nor did drug number 2. Drug number 3 was an <br/>
injected steroid called ACTH. She went seizure free after the 2nd <br/>
injection. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.<br/>
She&#39;s been on it for 4 weeks now and has bloated up. She cries <br/>
constantly and her Blood pressure is sky high. So far she has spent 3 <br/>
weeks in hospital, once for suspected menigitis and then for BP. She <br/>
doesn&#39;t smile or babble or do anything really but I&#39;ve been told by <br/>
those that have been through this that babies on ACTH are like this.<br/>
We are hoping that when we finish the drug wean (started yesterday)<br/>
she will come back to us and develop like a normal 5 month old baby. <br/>
It also makes it impossible to judge how bad her cerebral palsy is <br/>
although we know all 4 limbs are affected. Despite this she is trying <br/>
to gain head control and can suck and swallow!!! All things the doc <br/>
said she would never do!<br/>
<br/>
So thats me. Lots of hospital, lots of tears, lots of learning. Have <br/>
a great conference and I wish I could be there :-)<br/>

Hugs and belated good wishes on the birth of your daughter. I&#39;ve been <br/>
off this list for awhile (I&#39;m a refugee from the message boards now) <br/>
and never got to send proper congrats when she arrived.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re going through these difficult times. I&#39;ll keep <br/>
you all in my heart and send as much good energy your way as I can <br/>
muster. I&#39;m sure Celyn brings much joy along with all the other <br/>
stuff. <br/>

Shyrley ~ I wanted to give you the BIGGEST ((((((((HUG)))))) I could <br/>
via cyberspace!  You&#39;re amazing.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s 16.  He was born with a huge brain tumor.  The <br/>
doctors didn&#39;t give him very long to live from birth, but he lived!  <br/>
Then the doctors told his Mom all the things that Matt wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
able to do because he&#39;s legally blind (has a very small amount of <br/>
vision) ~ riding a bike being one of them.  Thankfully, his Mom (my <br/>
sweet friend) didn&#39;t tell Matt ~ he does everything his heart is <br/>
drawn to doing, more than most other 16 year old boys do ~ even rides <br/>
a bike quite expertly!  He was never told he had any limitations, so <br/>
he never had anything holding him back.<br/>
<br/>
So today, he&#39;s one of the most wonderful 16 year olds we know.  He&#39;s <br/>
sweet, has an incredible girlfriend, and both of them are extremely <br/>
talented musicians who have active music careers already, and plan on <br/>
continuing studying music in NYC after high school.<br/>
<br/>
So keep that faith in your heart and don&#39;t let the doctors define <br/>
Celyn&#39;s life for her.  She&#39;ll define it for herself, with your <br/>
unconditional love and dedicated parenting ~ and your belief in <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could hug you both for real ~ please know you are in my <br/>
thoughts and prayers.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979533378">Awww shucks.<br/>
It is the hardest and most painful thing I&#39;ve ever been through and the moment when the doc said &#39;your baby is severely brain damaged and we don&#39;t think she will live&#39; was the worst moment of my life. But we survive and we make the best of it. Celyn is still Celyn and I love her to bits. The joy she has bought just being herself outweighs the other bits.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Except at 4 am in the morning when she howls and cries! Then I lose all my wisdon ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755724880">My father severly injured his knee in a motorcycle accident when he was <br/>
in his early 40s. He was on crutches with a huge cast. The doctors told <br/>
him that he&#39;d always need crutches.<br/>
<br/>
Once they took the cast off, he started showing up for his physical <br/>
therapy sessions with just a cane. They said, &quot;That&#39;s great! But you&#39;ll <br/>
be using that cane the rest of your life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then (after months of swimming and other rehabilitative exercises) he <br/>
showed up without the cane. They said, &quot;Wow, you really did better than <br/>
we thought, but you&#39;ll still never be able to climb stairs, ride a bike, <br/>
or do sports.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t bother telling them that he lived in a 6 flight walkup <br/>
apartment, and rode his bicycle all over town including to his two jobs: <br/>
bartending and teaching Tai Chi. He also cancelled the rest of his <br/>
follow-up appointments. He&#39;s 64 now, and has no trouble keeping up with <br/>
my 13 year old brother and 11 year old sister.<br/>
<br/>
So I tend to say :-P to doctors. In their defense though, maybe they <br/>
just don&#39;t want to make false promises or get people&#39;s hopes up only for <br/>
them to be disappointed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043746540">Also consider the challenges doctors have to work with.  Many patients do<br/>
not follow the doctors&#39; recommendations for recovery and/or self-care. <br/>
Sometimes the patients are stubborn (my grandmother not wearing her<br/>
hearing aid or my uncle trimming his own dentures and ruining several<br/>
pair).  Sometimes the patients don&#39;t have the willpower (perhaps not<br/>
exercising and eating healthy foods despite having had bypass surgery). <br/>
One of our former babysitters had diabetes and asthma but still ate donuts<br/>
and lived with a smoker.<br/>
<br/>
My mother travels throughout the Delta region setting up clinics in which<br/>
the local towns videoconference with specialists in Little Rock.  She has<br/>
worked in a bone marrow transplant center, has taught nursing, and has<br/>
many years of nursing experience prior to that.  She can regale us for<br/>
hours with tales from the hospital, that are unbelievable.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe the doctors&#39; own expectations are lower because many of their<br/>
patients don&#39;t follow the protocols necessary to get better.  And when a<br/>
patient actually follows directions, takes his/her medicine, eats right,<br/>
exercises, doesn&#39;t overdo it and reinjure him/herself, the doctors are<br/>
pleasantly surprised.<br/>
