<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034687700">CNN is looking for some families to interview for a story on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
They are on a tight schedule and would like to interview some people by<br/>
phone today and tomorrow (Friday 13 and Saturday 14, 2006). They may want to<br/>
follow up with some families to video their activities. They are especially<br/>
interested in getting some families from the Chicago and Atlanta areas.<br/>
<br/>
They would like to get a mix of some families with younger children and<br/>
those with older children (or families with both)  as well as both boys and<br/>
girls.<br/>
<br/>
If you would be willing to talk to the reporter, please contact me directly<br/>
at this e-mail address and I will provide you with contact information.<br/>
