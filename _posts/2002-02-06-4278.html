<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453755623">any economists on this list who can explain to me in layperson&#39;s terms<br/>
why roosevelt took the u.s. off the gold standard?  that is, i<br/>
understand it was done to boost the depression economy, but i don&#39;t<br/>
understand WHY the move off gold would be a boost.  i&#39;ll blame my<br/>
request for a very simple explanation on the fact that i&#39;m trying to<br/>
explain this to a small child who wants to know what paper money stands<br/>
for and why it doesn&#39;t stand for gold anymore.  i can&#39;t find any<br/>
resources at the library that present a basic explanation -- if you know<br/>
of one, please advise.  thank you.<br/>

oil and gas industry.&quot;<br/>
