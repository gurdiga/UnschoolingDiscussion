<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100435948">I wrote a little while ago about concerns I had for my 12yo daughter.  <br/>
I was going through a &#39;doubting&#39; stage and I was probably just looking <br/>
for reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
Since my post I have not had the time, energy or inclination to <br/>
conciously strew. (My father had a stroke and I&#39;ve just returned from <br/>
visiting him) But this morning I was quietly excited.  My daughter saw <br/>
me doing my journal, and has since started her own, importing art and <br/>
photos into it.  I didn&#39;t suggest it, she just showed interest.  She&#39;s <br/>
cooking right now, because she wanted to.  She was playing PS1 earlier <br/>
and also reading the on-line newsletter from the diet network she <br/>
follows.  She wrote up the shopping list of the items she needs for <br/>
her special meals, and checked the &#39;friendly&#39; toiletries that she will <br/>
try out.  Beth has been memorizing tunes on the keyboard and checking <br/>
with the music books we have on the shelf.  On and on it goes.  And I <br/>
thought she had no interests... I&#39;m a bit slow:)<br/>
<br/>
So thanks for the words of encouragement and admonishment.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to hear about your dad, but your daughter&#39;s day sounds  <br/>
wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
When people worry about many days running of &quot;nothing&quot; (no impressing  <br/>
learning stories), I try to remind them that there are generally 180  <br/>
school days and 185 &quot;other.&quot;  Sometimes unschoolers worry if they  <br/>
don&#39;t have 365 big days.    When I was in school (and I liked school)  <br/>
I had maybe five or six big days a year, meaning days worth telling  <br/>
my mom about when I got home, days I would thing back upon wistfully  <br/>
when I was two or three days into dull nothingness schooldays. &lt;G&gt;   <br/>
Sometimes there was a really good schoolday.  In all the years I went  <br/>
to school, it probably didn&#39;t break 100.  (I had more than 100 really  <br/>
good school moments. &lt;g&gt;   Many thousands.  And thousands that sucked.)<br/>
