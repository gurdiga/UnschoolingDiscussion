&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1670<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I began home-schooling just this year for my daughter for<br/>
&gt; kindergarten.  I do school-at-home, but for many aspects of the<br/>
&gt; curriculum I chose, my daughter is bored and I feel if I would have to<br/>
&gt; force her to continue, which I don&#39;t want to do.  Unschooling is a<br/>
&gt; &quot;theory&quot; that intrigues me, but what is a typical day, week like for<br/>
&gt; someone this young.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t one. :) I know that&#39;s not wildly helpful, but it&#39;s truthful.<br/>
Unschooling &quot;typically&quot; looks like a child doing exactly whatever it is she<br/>
loves to do. Depending on the child and on any given hour of any given day,<br/>
this may &quot;typically&quot; look like sleeping, cooking, walking, playing, watching<br/>
tv, playing games, talking to her grandfather, asking questions about God<br/>
and why cats wash with their tongues, or, yes, doing math worksheets.<br/>
<br/>
Robert Frost actually said it best:<br/>
<br/>
Only where love and need are one<br/>
and the work is play for mortal stakes<br/>
Is the deed ever truly done<br/>
for Heaven&#39;s and the future&#39;s sakes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She is too young to do her own research or plan<br/>
&gt; activities around her interests.  I also have two younger children, so<br/>
&gt; the preplanned curriculum is helpful to me on those days the other<br/>
&gt; children are needing more of my time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling actually fits in very well with multi-children households. And<br/>
your daughter is doing her own research and planning activities around her<br/>
interests all the time: every time she plays dress-up, watches something on<br/>
TV, picks out a book, or asks you questions, she&#39;s doing her own research<br/>
and planning her own activities. :) Trust her, the kid&#39;s good, she knows<br/>
what she wants right now, and what she wants is exactly what she needs to<br/>
learn about.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know a few homeschoolers, but no unschoolers.  Is there a support<br/>
&gt; group in the Carol Stream, Illinois area where I could go and interact<br/>
&gt; with other unschoolers to see examples of unschooling at work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There may or may not be an unschooling support group, but be aware that<br/>
unschoolers at work and unschoolers at play look the same, because it IS the<br/>
same.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, this sort of thing can carry you through to real life. :) My work<br/>
and play looks like the same thing, too. Following bliss can put food on the<br/>
table.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-273382412">Yes.  This is one of the reasons why our family unschools.  I want to <br/>
make sure that whatever work our sons choose as adults, they will <br/>
consider it to be fun too.  My husband is loves his work.  It&#39;s his play <br/>
too.  And, he does it here at home.  I think my boys are fortunate to <br/>
see that in my husband.  It can only have a positive effect in how they <br/>
view making a living.<br/>
