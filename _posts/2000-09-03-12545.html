 DH decided he&#39;s figured out why husbands go to work & stay out of the<br/>
 homeschooling way.  The kids were trying to be too much help for him in a<br/>
 small kitchen.  Though he&#39;s gradually getting used to it.  It&#39;s the first<br/>
 time he&#39;s been home for a major bake off.<br/>

lime pie sounds wonderful!<br/>
