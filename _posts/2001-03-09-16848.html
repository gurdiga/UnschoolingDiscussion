<div id="ygrps-yiv-433118125">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t my first post, but I won&#39;t go into details of my 8 year stint<br/>
as an unschooler to three kids, aged 13, 11, and 8.  I have tried to<br/>
keep things light, and &#39;flowing&#39; for quite some time now, but I have<br/>
noticed things flowing right out the window!  There seems to be more<br/>
unschooling than &#39;unschooling&#39; if you know what I mean, and while I realize<br/>
as the kids get older, especially the 13 year old who just &#39;became a<br/>
woman&#39; two days ago, and an 11 year old boy who has more important things<br/>
to do, I feel somewhat frustrated by the lack of interest and sometimes<br/>
just plain laziness.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get<br/>
us all back in the swing of things, and recharge our batteries somehow,<br/>
even though I know we all feel somewhat burned out at this point.  I<br/>
feel so guilty when my husband comes home from work and asks, &quot;How was<br/>
school?&#39; and we look at him with blank stares and silence.  I would really<br/>
appreciate anyone&#39;s advice on getting a handle on this problem before<br/>
it gets completely out of control.  Thanks so much, and I&#39;ll be looking<br/>
forward to hearing from you.                 love, Janice<br/>

Tell him you dont go to school. I think that you need<br/>
to make dh aware of your philosophy. Things will be<br/>
much easier if you can talk honestly with your<br/>
partner. They are his kids, too, right?<br/>
As far as laziness, everyone here will tell you IT<br/>
WILL PASS! And, if it really bothers you, maybe you<br/>
could try to be a little lazy yourself. I&#39;ve been<br/>
working on this, and I spent a whole day playing video<br/>
games with my kids this week. It was quite freeing!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m having a hard time from your post grasping what exactly the problem is.<br/>
Do you feel like the kids aren&#39;t learning enough? That they aren&#39;t learning<br/>
the &quot;right&quot; things? Are they complaining that they&#39;re bored? Are you bored?<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that helps us is that at the beginning of each month, we<br/>
peruse the local papers, calendars, homeschooling newsletter, etc. and write<br/>
out all the possible things that we might want to do on a giant wall<br/>
calendar. This might be a local folk dancing time, homeschool hour at the<br/>
roller-skating rink, story time at the library, a craft workshop, swimming<br/>
lessons, or whatever - those go up in one color (tentative things). We also<br/>
write up our regular things, like my swim team practice, our weekly<br/>
homeschoolers activities (we go to a regular open craft time and park/gym<br/>
day), those go up in another color because we know we&#39;re definitely going to<br/>
them. We add any holidays, doctor&#39;s appointments, etc. in and try to work<br/>
out any scheduling conflicts (like for activities where I need my husband to<br/>
have the kids with him). At this time, we discuss any potential activities<br/>
that anyone wants to do (new kinds of lessons or activities) and add those<br/>
if necessary. Then there is the normal stuff we do - gardening outdoors,<br/>
going to the library, etc. You might have a talk with your kids and see what<br/>
things they are interested in doing, or maybe present some things you think<br/>
might tickle their fancy. How about volunteer opportunities - these can be a<br/>
good free way to get involved and active in some area and your kids are old<br/>
enough to really participate in something like that.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &quot;How was school?&quot; question, I personally would be tempted to<br/>
reply something like &quot;life is learning, we&#39;re living, therefore we&#39;re<br/>
learning!&quot;. But I guess it depends on why your husband is asking. Is he not<br/>
bought into the whole unschooling concept? What are his specific worries?<br/>
Maybe you can do something like keeping a homeschool journal for a couple of<br/>
weeks so he can see what your daily activities are like. You can even<br/>
categorize them by what &quot;subject area&quot; they might fall under. Like &quot;Biology:<br/>
spent 45 minutes birdwatching and categorizing birds&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And last but definitely not least - what are your own passions? Follow them,<br/>
pursue them, let your kids see how you go about doing things you&#39;re<br/>
interested in. Chances are they will find their own passions to pursue,<br/>
sooner or later.<br/>
