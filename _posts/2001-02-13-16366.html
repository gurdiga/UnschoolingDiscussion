<div id="ygrps-yiv-122178045">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a new subscriber to this group and would like to introduce myself<br/>
and my family!  I&#39;m the mom to five delightful children ages 9 months<br/>
to 9 years.  They all enjoy reading, games, arts/crafts, science, animals/nature,<br/>
and most anything physical.  My husband is with the local hospice.  He<br/>
enjoys reading, computer &quot;hearts&quot;, and is working on a screenplay.  I<br/>
enjoy decorating, gardening, fixing up the house, scrapbooking, reading,<br/>
and staying home with the children!  We&#39;ve only just recently relocated<br/>
to Albemarle, NC and would welcome the opportunity to meet others who<br/>
may be nearby...Stanly Co., Cabarrus, Montgomery.  I&#39;m looking forward<br/>
to sharing with all of you!  <br/>
