<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522062557">What if every parent who intended to and did send a child to <br/>
kindergarten at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;5 said &quot;up until that time, we were unschoolers, but now it&#39;s time <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for <br/>
him to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;go to school<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a good laugh over this one,as my younger sister does this all <br/>
the time!  She sends all of her children to school at age 6, (the <br/>
last of four attending this year) but when she had pre-schoolers in <br/>
the grocery store she would always say she &quot;homeschooled&quot;!    Drives <br/>
me crazy!<br/>
Someone asked about historical fiction for younger boys?  Two of my <br/>
sons have learned to read BECAUSE of the Childhood of Famous <br/>
Americans books about Kit Carson, Jim Bowie, Daniel Boone.  They <br/>
love the outdoors so much and want to be real wilderness men.  Both <br/>
have struggled with learning to read until about age 8, then we <br/>
started reading this type of book out loud, and soon they were <br/>
reading them themselves.  My 9-year-old is just getting to that <br/>
point, it has been three years of using &quot;100 Easy Lessons&quot; (tried <br/>
Hooked on Phonics borrowed from the library, and yuck, we hated it!)<br/>
but the real &quot;catch&quot; in learning to read came when they discovered <br/>
books they really wanted to read themselves!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, anyone else really miss &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;?<br/>
