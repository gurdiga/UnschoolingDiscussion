<div id="ygrps-yiv-201147129">Hi,<br/>
 We are talking about moving in or near BOise Idaho so<br/>
we can be closer to our family and friends in<br/>
Sacramento. Anyone live there? What is unschooling<br/>
like there? Please e-mail me off list.<br/>
        THanks Kimberly<br/>

Interesting.  IMO, Boise ID is not very close to Sacramento!<br/>
<br/>
We live about 250 miles from the area where dh and I both grew up and still have lots of family.  When we first moved, I thought it would be no big deal to hop in the car for the 4 hour (one way) drive over 2 mountain passes whenever it caught our fancy.  Flying is out of the question financially.  Besides, it takes as long to fly as it does to drive, by the time we would drive to the airport, check in, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that it IS a big deal.  One of my children battles with motion sickness, the children are involved in various activities that we don&#39;t want to miss too often, and it is very stressful to ONLY see relatives while either we are their houseguests or they are ours.<br/>
<br/>
Although we love where we live for many reasons, I do feel sad that cousins, aunts, uncles, and one remaining grandmother are not a more frequent part of our lives.<br/>
<br/>
IF my goal were to move closer to family, I would suggest somewhere within a few hours of driving.  Close enough to visit and go home in the same day.<br/>
<br/>
I happen to live in eastern WA, about 3 hours from the Idaho border.  I have one relaxed/eclectic homeschooling friend who lived in Napa, just outside of Boise and another who lived in Post Falls, Idaho and comes from a Waldorfy/Oak Meadow point of view.  Both said they felt out of place.<br/>
<br/>
Not to say that there aren&#39;t awesome unschooling families in Idaho.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484588997">That&#39;s what I was thinking!<br/>
We live in Bend, Oregon, having moved up here from the SF bay area last<br/>
year.  We&#39;ve done the drive to the bay area and Sacramento many times since<br/>
moving.  It&#39;s a 7 to 9 hour drive depending on the traffic and we haven&#39;t<br/>
tried it in the winter.  Boise is pretty conservative as far as I know.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to look into Bend, I am the moderator of a group here and it&#39;s<br/>
finally getting a lot of people coming out of the woodwork.  Like Mary Ellen<br/>
said, I would also choose to be closer if you want to be close to family.<br/>
Have you checked out any areas of northern CA?  CA has the option of filing<br/>
and R-4 which is a really nice and easy way to unschool.  Once you fill out<br/>
the form and send it in there&#39;s no more contact from the state.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890764995">Right now we live in Houston. We fly home 2 times a<br/>
year and drive 1. My Husband works for himself and we<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948477489">I lived in Sacramento my whole life up until 1 year<br/>
ago. We moved for lifestyle and my husband was going<br/>
to start a non-profit with a friend here in Houston.<br/>
That is not happening. I have a great group of<br/>
Unschooling women that I am very close to in<br/>
Sacramento. I am there at least 3 times a year. We<br/>
will eventually move back there. It is to expensive<br/>
for the lifestyle we want right now. I know all about<br/>
the R-4. Here in Texas we don&#39;t have to do anything.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

People don&#39;t always like to get TOO close to relatives, but to be driving <br/>
distance instead of airfare distance can be very good.   Most families can&#39;t <br/>
afford airfare, especially big families.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re three-to-four hours from Keith&#39;s parents, and it involves an <br/>
overnighter, but it&#39;s possible to get there on short notice without regard to plane <br/>
schedules or costs.<br/>
