<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080953841">We put in Armstrong (supposed to be more durable and impervious to water<br/>
damage than Pergo) laminate in our kitchen/ living room space, and it&#39;s held<br/>
up beautifully to the dog and kids (though not so well to me dropping a<br/>
large chef&#39;s knife into it *eek*). I would *highly* recommend it, and the<br/>
great thing about it is you have to do virtually nothing to prepare the<br/>
subfloor. It just can&#39;t be wildly unlevel. Dh began trying to rip up<br/>
linoleum (don&#39;t know why! told him not to--total goat rope!), so there were<br/>
places where it was subfloor and places where there were two layers of bad<br/>
linoleum. We got the heavier underlayment to absorb more sound and provide a<br/>
leveling base. Really... doesn&#39;t need a whole lot of work on the subfloor to<br/>
put it down. Dh and fil installed it all themselves--no glue, snap lock<br/>
kind.<br/>
<br/>
The stuff is awesome! It is so kid friendly! The laminate floor, my kitchen<br/>
table (solid and wipeable) and some very comfortable sofas make my kitchen/<br/>
living combo wonderful. I keep all the kids art supplies in one of the<br/>
bottom cabinets (totally agree with Ren on this one!) where they can pull<br/>
them out whenever they want. They can lay on the kitchen table, paint on it,<br/>
draw on it, whatever--it all comes off, and if it doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s what I<br/>
bought the table for anyway. Spills don&#39;t matter, nothing to be anal about.<br/>
Kids can be kids and I can sit on the comfy couch with my laptop and read<br/>
email while they&#39;re doing it all. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Usually when any hard surface is laid over subfloor, a sheet of 1/4 inch luan <br/>
is laid on top of the subfloor.  It comes in 4&#39; x 8&#39; sheets and creates a <br/>
smooth surface on which to lay hardwood or laminate.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea, which is more labor intensive, would be to scour your area for <br/>
reclaimed floor boards.  Any old farm houses or barns that are coming down <br/>
could be salvaged.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

I&#39;ll second that. Our tile buckled up in the dining room the day before I<br/>
was having a Christmas party here. (a week before the holiday) My husband is<br/>
pretty handy but never laid tile before. We got the large tiles and he did<br/>
it all himself. He did a great job. It wasn&#39;t that hard and the worst part<br/>
was pulling up the old tile. Our dining room is rather large and he did that<br/>
and the foyer from the front door. He had it all done by Christmas eve.<br/>
There are a few tiles a bit uneven but I can only tell when I mop.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the size of the area and the cost of the tiles, it can be<br/>
relatively inexpensive. Just don&#39;t go for really cheap tile, it will be<br/>
worth it to spend a little more and have it look nice longer. I found that<br/>
with the better tile we have now from the cheap crap the previous owners<br/>
had, I don&#39;t have to mop as often because it looks cleaner longer. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
We put hard wood (nail down) in the kitchen. My neighbor finished it the <br/>
Thursday before last year&#39;s conference. Friday morning I walked into the kitchen <br/>
to find it buckled---and getting WORSE! When he&#39;d finished, he&#39;d rehooked the <br/>
dishwasher up too loosely. It had leaked *under* the wood. <br/>
<br/>
What a mess! Huge &quot;waves&quot; for over more than a third of the rather large <br/>
kitchen floor! I was SICK! I cried for two days. (I think it had a bit to do with <br/>
the conference coming up too though!)<br/>
<br/>
He fixed it later, but it&#39;ll never look as good as it did that Thursday <br/>
night. There are still a few dips and rises here and there----just too expensive to <br/>
remove and re-lay. <br/>
<br/>
The death house will have that pretty tinted concrete floor throughout. As <br/>
finances will allow, we will add cork in the kitchen, bamboo in the master <br/>
bedroom, and tile in the bathroom. But I like that snazzy concrete.<br/>
<br/>
But back to the issue at hand! &lt;g&gt; Mary&#39;s story is realistic. You can put <br/>
tile down quickly and inexpensively if you look around for good tile on sale and <br/>
do it yourself! And it&#39;s a LOT easier than folks want you to believe!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Ooh, I know what you mean. We put down cheap, cheap cushion backed carpet because our floors were covered in an old style laminate that hasn&#39;t all come off and has left a ripple effect on our floor. To put down the much lusted after laminate we&#39;d have to lay a new floor. <br/>
  The house I grew up in wasn&#39;t carpeted until my parent sold it, until then it was just a painted and sealed particle board floor and know what? It was fantastic! There was no worry about damaging a floor, it was great for dinky cars and Barbies and the odd time we snuck our bikes inside (what a thrill). I&#39;d say just paint the floor and forget doing anything else until the kids are bigger....if it were an option for me I&#39;d be tempted to do the same.<br/>

Those small rocks, you can get differnet sizes and colors and then they coat it and it is smooth and shinny, indestructible, looks nice, lasts for ever, adds value to your house.  We have it in the klitchen, hallway and dinning room.   Living room and badrooms have carpet.  <br/>

A friend just told me that her house has plywood floors and her landlord is<br/>
too cheap to put in something nice.  So she was also looking for something<br/>
cheap and creative.<br/>
<br/>
She decided to paint the plywood.  She used quite a few coats and is using a<br/>
tile design.  I haven&#39;t seen it but she is thrilled with the results.<br/>

We accidently came upon a guy here (we were looking for an entry mat, and <br/>

so.  He used to do janitorial stuff, and runs a supply place and is a <br/>
musician and an artist and is doing tile work.  But his claim to fame is a flooring  <br/>
[thinking of a word] method/system which involves pouring liquid something <br/>
(acrylic gel, it seems, kind of) and he puts designs in it kind of based on <br/>
putting designs on tile with glazes) and we saw it in various places in his <br/>
building, over concrete, over wood, and over tile-on-concrete.  It&#39;s hard, it&#39;s kind <br/>
of thick/see-through, like the old bar countertops and floors that people used <br/>
to put money and junk into so you can never get it out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m describing this horribly, but the floors were beautiful and seemed <br/>
durable.<br/>
<br/>
It was called FantaSe floors, I think, but there&#39;s no website.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579301437">Hmmm, I hadn&#39;t thought about that.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to paint my concrete floor in the basement with the paint you are talking about.  But I hadn&#39;t thought about it on floors like particle board.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to check into that.<br/>
<br/>
In  the meantime, I&#39;m trying to &quot;clean&quot; the carpet with &quot;nature&#39;s miracle&quot; cleaner.  It really works on pet odor/stains...even old ones.  I may go over the tough spots again.<br/>
<br/>
The carpet will still look as beat up as ever, but at least it will be clean and SMELL clean I hope :o).<br/>
<br/>
Home Depot is having a special where if you buy over $300 worth of stuff, you don&#39;t pay on it for a whole year.  I *might* take advantage of that for laminate wood flooring, IF the subfloor is in good enough shape.  There is also laminate wood flooring on sale for $40/case, with a 15 year warranty.<br/>
<br/>
 But I have to tear up the carpet to see how the subfloor is.  (The room is 24x17, so its a large area of carpet to be ripped up too.<br/>
<br/>
If its level, I&#39;ll put some kind of plywood down (Probably luwan).  But if its swelled anywhere I might not be able to do that.  I could possibly cut the swelled areas out and replace them with fresh particle board.<br/>
<br/>
The other problem I might have is that if the laminate wood raises the floor level up too high, I may have to cut down the front door to get it to fit. UGH!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120642667">When we lived in our cabin, (that&#39;s code for shack&lt;g&gt;) we put down oak<br/>
plywood.  It was cheaper than anything else at the time.  We cut the<br/>
plywood so that it looked like wide floor planks and put it down plank<br/>
style.  David counter sunk the screws and plugged the holes.  We stained<br/>
it antique oak and finished it with that poly stuff they use on<br/>
basketball courts.  That stuff shines and I&#39;m not crazy about it but we<br/>
were going for something durable enough to stand up to moist critter<br/>
incidents.   It was rustic-ish, but it was a uh, cabin, after all.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know how long it lasted for sure.  We moved a couple years later. <br/>
Oak plywood probably costs more now but there are other kinds.  <br/>
<br/>
You could paint rugs on it too, before you seal it.  We did that in a<br/>
different house.  That one had wood plank floors, fir, or some other soft<br/>
wood and we refinished it and painted throw rugs in the doorways, then<br/>
put polyurethane over the top.  Man, I was sick of those rugs after a<br/>
couple years. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could scout around the flooring stores and collect all their<br/>
broken tiles and get yourself a tile cutter and make the coolest mosaic<br/>
art floor in the history of the world.   <br/>
<br/>
Kathryn is the decorating porn queen but I&#39;ve seen people on those<br/>
decorating shows use self leveling concrete and then they score lines in<br/>
it before it&#39;s dry to make it look like a stone floor.   That&#39;d be cold<br/>
though, and hard.  Painted rugs wouldn&#39;t help, you&#39;d have to buy the real<br/>
deal.  Probably these ideas are more expensive than just buying some<br/>
vinyl. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

It was called FantaSe floors, I think, but there&#39;s no website.  <br/>
<br/>

Sandra, this sounded so cool I did a web search...didn&#39;t find a Fanta Se <br/>
floor site, but a tiny article about it that gave a link to another place...might <br/>
not be the same thing, but this sure looks cool.  I wonder how much it would <br/>
cost?  Our floors are incredibly uneven too....<br/>

Yeah, that&#39;s it!<br/>
<br/>
The photos don&#39;t begin to show how cool it can look.  I wish they&#39;d shown <br/>
some of the funky swirly hippy floors at their own office!  Every room was <br/>
different, and we poked around into the bathrooms and everywhere going OOOH!  OHH!<br/>

<br/>
But I wonder how you get it out later to replace it (if/when)?</div>

&lt;&lt;Have you heard of pebble tech floors?  Those small rocks, you can get<br/>
differnet sizes and colors and then they coat it and it is smooth and<br/>
shinny, indestructible, looks nice, lasts for ever, adds value to your<br/>
house.  We have it in the klitchen, hallway and dinning room.   Living room<br/>
and badrooms have carpet. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Badrooms!! Tee hee!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, does it hold up well with dog claws?? I haven&#39;t heard of what you<br/>
are talking about but I know just what you mean. I&#39;ve seen bars done like<br/>
that. &lt;BG&gt; I guess kind of like chattahootchee down here except smooth. I<br/>
like the look of chattahoochee but not the feel. And I have no idea if I<br/>
spelled chattahootchee right. Fellow Floridians??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199298093">Hi, this stuff holds up to everything, dogs and kids.  It is indestructible.  You choose the size rocks and color and they lay all the rocks down and then coat it, We do have a small carpet runner down the hallway, but it is nice and smooth. <br/>

I think that&#39;s spelled right.  But I&#39;ve only seen it outside around pools.  <br/>
And if I recall correctly it&#39;s hard on the feet. OUCH!  I can&#39;t imagine it <br/>
inside.<br/>

Yeah me to. After all these years of being barefoot, I still can&#39;t walk on<br/>
that stuff without shoes. My kids glide across it like no big deal. I was so<br/>
glad our pool didn&#39;t have that when we moved here. I would imagine it would<br/>
be nice with a clear coat over the top to smooth it out. Then again when<br/>
wet, one would have a giant slip and slide around the pool!!!<br/>
