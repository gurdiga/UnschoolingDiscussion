<div id="ygrps-yiv-507301118">Thanks for everyone&#39;s comments to help with my son. I really appreciated Julie&#39;s comment <br/>
that is something is essential, he will learn it. Smack! (That&#39;s me smnacking my forehead.)<br/>
<br/>
Since we began talking on thie list an amazing thing happened. My older son is a huge <br/>
Tolkien fan and I suggested to him that he make a map with his own world in it. (He was <br/>
asking for some creativity suggestions for summer.) We had spent a bunch of time with a <br/>
globe and maps and flags last year due to their interest in countries/continents (spawned <br/>
by Survivor, of all things).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the three younger kids (including my 10 yo) jumped on the idea and have been <br/>
drawing and creating for days now. My 10 yo who &quot;hates to write&quot;? Well, he&#39;s drawn his <br/>
own map of an island chain, has labeled all the islands, designed flags for each island, <br/>
created gods to rule the islands, has drawn a page of swords and is now drawing the ships <br/>
for his navy. I&#39;m in shock. This is all in the last three days. He even wants the TV off and is <br/>
preferring this work to playing Star Craft on the computer. He has done so much on <br/>
computer gaming that he has inside all these stories and names and conflicts to pour out <br/>
in his own way and suddenly being given a way to do it has caught his attention.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite moment: he wrote the word &quot;aguelar&quot; (name of an island he made up) and said, <br/>
&quot;Look at my perfect letter &#39;a&#39;.&quot; And it was perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve been so busy helping them find resources for their projects (all three are <br/>
keeping notebooks to design their &quot;worlds&quot;) I haven&#39;t had time to thank you all for your <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Funny how quickly despair can turn to hope.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Julie B</div>
