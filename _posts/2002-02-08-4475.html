<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969999401">We recently got a software game called Travelrama.  Unfortunately, it has bugs and I plan to send it back.  Allison loves the game and I told her we could look for another one.  So does anyone have a map type software game or even board game that they like?<br/>
<br/>
With this game 1-4 people can play.  Each player is given 5 postcards they need to collect by going to the appropriate state to collect them.  On their turn, the player would spin electronically and win mileage, then choose a travel destination with in those miles.  The first person to collect all post cards and return home wins.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755478680">Pre kids,  my husband and I played with maps.<br/>
<br/>
One game we played was a file folder with two holes cut in it (or two file <br/>
folders with differen size holes)--one about 2&quot; across and one twice that <br/>
(for places like Utah)--and the game was, put the circle somewhere on an <br/>
atlas page so the rest of the cardboard is covering up what page you&#39;re on <br/>
and such, and see if you can guess from the place names what state or <br/>
province it is.  Foreign countries were too easy; England too crowded.  So <br/>
we&#39;d just use kinda-rural parts of north America.  Northern Mexico was okay, <br/>
because the names could be Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t played it with kids.  Maybe we think they don&#39;t know as much as we <br/>
did, or haven&#39;t shown the interest in place names.<br/>

World Explorer.  You go all over the world, also collecting postcards (or<br/>
maybe stamps?) as you go.  Another program is 3-D World Atlas, which is not<br/>
a game but is still cool and EDUCATIONAL &lt;gg&gt;<br/>
