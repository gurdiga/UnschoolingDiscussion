<div id="ygrps-yiv-685364173">Hi Elaine,<br/>
My name is Tonya.I joined not that long ago and I am really behind in posts  <br/>
but this one caught my attention. You said your daughter is Dyspraxic. I have <br/>
a  3 1/2 year old son that is Apraxic. Dyspraxia and Apraxia are pretty much  <br/>
the same thing. He has lots of speech problems and behavior problems. It seems <br/>
 to be getting better now as he gets older.<br/>
If you would be interested to talk, since this isn&#39;t really an Unschooling  <br/>
issue you are welcome to write me personally At <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_Tpowerwoman@...">_Tpowerwoman@...</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Tpowerwoman@...">Tpowerwoman@...</a>) <br/>
I would love to talk to another mother of a gifted and special child like  <br/>
mine. <br/>
                                                                              <br/>
          Sincerely, Tonya<br/>
<br/>
