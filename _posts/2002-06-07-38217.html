<div id="ygrps-yiv-724793091">The reason they want everyone to stay the night at the hotel is so <br/>
everyone can go to their home the next day for a brunch. They will be <br/>
invited to this event.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who may feel <br/>
this way. I&#39;m also not sure if it is his idea or his wife&#39;s (the <br/>
kids&#39; grandma) idea to not have them eat with everyone.  I should <br/>
find out at what age the cut-off is.<br/>
