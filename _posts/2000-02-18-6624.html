<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090331570">Hi. I am wondering if someone can help me with a question that been<br/>
bugging me for a while..........<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try and make a long story short!  We have just been &#39;dumped&#39; by a<br/>
&#39;friend&#39; of ours. My daughter and one of hers were best friends, very<br/>
close - a wonderful relationship. Well as you can imagine Anna was<br/>
heartbroken when this h/schooling friend of mine decided we were no<br/>
longer a fine enough example for her girls.<br/>
Anyway....this got me wondering about the issue of friends and<br/>
socialization etc. We are involved in alot of activities, some with<br/>
h/schoolers some without, and Anna doesn&#39;t seem to make friends with any<br/>
of them!!!!  She is very mature for her age and I&#39;m wondering if this<br/>
has anything to do with it.<br/>
Is this a normal thing - Anna is six and very social and while she<br/>
desperately misses her lost friend,<br/>
she otherwise seems reasonably content. I think I have nothing too much<br/>
to be concerned about but was wondering what you guys think.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754126037">My 8 yo son does much better with older kids and adults, he is mature<br/>
too, has been since birth it seems and he is also one that seems to have<br/>
difficulty making friends his age. I do not worry anymore, he was in<br/>
school until last spring and it made it worse not better, he is a happy<br/>
boy and much more comfortable around people of all ages, races and<br/>
physical conditions than most children, I think your daughter probably<br/>
just needs to be with people more her maturity and&#92;or interests with less<br/>
concern for age than most of of show. Let her experience lots of ages and<br/>
she will find her own place.<br/>
