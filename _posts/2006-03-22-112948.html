<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177141988">This is a very interesting article which brings to mind something <br/>
that happened recently.  My son (8) and I were sitting across from <br/>
each other in a restaurant the other day and he made the observation <br/>
that his glass was to his right and my glass was to my left.  This <br/>
was not particularly notable, except for the fact that my son did <br/>
not know his left from his right just a month ago, let alone that <br/>
someone&#39;s left and right would be in reverse when sitting opposite <br/>
of him.  Not only that, but he had many therapy sessions from age 6 <br/>
to 7 where the therapist would patiently drill him with exercises <br/>
for him to somehow gain this `important&#39; skill (I never did <br/>
understand exactly how this was supposed to help him).  Of course, I <br/>
now regret allowing this to go on when my heart said, `something is <br/>
not right in Denmark.&#39;   Ah, water under the bridge now.<br/>
<br/>
I was just too curious how he acquired this seemingly elusive skill, <br/>
so I asked him about it.  He said, &quot;I guess I just needed to know it <br/>
for something.&quot;  He wasn&#39;t able to elaborate any further, but <br/>
suffice it to say, he believed he learned it because he NEEDED it.  <br/>
As far as I&#39;m concerned, case closed.<br/>
