child?<br/>
<br/>
Ethical-(greek ethos, character) 1. having to do with ethics; of or <br/>
conforming to moral standards.<br/>
<br/>
Morals-1. dealing with or capable of distinguishing between right and wrong <br/>
2. of ,  teaching, or in accordance with the principles of right and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy, it&#39;s very hard, but it is simple. It is as simple as knowing <br/>
the difference between right and wrong. You may not be able to fix it, but <br/>
that does not mean that you cannot have an impact. As for standing up and <br/>
being ridiculed and ostracized. You are right, there&#39;s always a good chance <br/>
that a person will be ridiculed for doing what is right. Are you suggesting <br/>
that as adults, we must give in to adult bullies, rather than stand up to <br/>
child bullies? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how  I can prepare my children to be happy in the world if they <br/>
are afraid of being ostracized, insulted, and ridiculed just for saying &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t think that behavior is right.&quot; (That&#39;s how the ultimate bullies---the <br/>
Nazi&#39;s, got away with mass murder)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my grandmother was a teacher, my Aunt was a professor, my mother <br/>
was a teacher, my brother-in-law is a teacher, both of my sisters have been <br/>
teachers, and I have been a substitute teacher and an art teacher. I have <br/>
tremendous respect for teachers who do what is right. I have a great deal of <br/>
disrespect for teachers who are paid to be in a position to help children, <br/>
and don&#39;t.<br/>

(read Gatto&#39;s books!)  Kids are taught to conform and to obey all <br/>

let the government &quot;protect&quot; them.  The Germans shouldn&#39;t have <br/>
allowed Hitler to get away with daytime curfew laws, making the Jews <br/>
have special permits for owning businesses, not letting Jews vote, <br/>
and most importantly--they shouldn&#39;t have allowed him to take away <br/>
their guns!  Hitler&#39;s men would have had a more difficult task in <br/>
rounding up the Jews if all households at least had a gun to defend <br/>
themselves.  If all towns would have fought back with weapons.  But <br/>
Hitler was a smart man.   He knew he needed to take away rights one <br/>
at a time, not all at once.  And he knew that he needed to disarm the <br/>
people.  <br/>

Me personally?<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are you suggesting <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not agreeing to anything here on broad terms because every case is <br/>
particular, but I myself am not averse to standing up to kids right in front <br/>
of their parents if the kids are insulting or hitting, and if the parents are <br/>
insufficiently interested in helping, that&#39;s fine.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know how  I can prepare my children to be happy in the world if <br/>
they <br/>
are afraid of being ostracized, insulted, and ridiculed just for saying &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t think that behavior is right.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t prepare them to know that bullying will NEVER be eradicated they <br/>
will be supremely unhappy.   Prepare them for moments, not a lifetime.  <br/>
Because life is a series of moments.  And in the absence of school, they will <br/>
rarely be forced to spend long unsupervised time in the company of ANY <br/>
person, ever.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have tremendous respect for teachers who do what is right. I have a great <br/>
deal of <br/>
disrespect for teachers who are paid to be in a position to help children, <br/>
and don&#39;t.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They are set up to fail.  I believe that Gardner&#39;s intelligences are spot on <br/>
about interpersonal relations, and MOST people aren&#39;t great at that.  Some <br/>
are, and some of those are teachers.  Be all the angry you want to be at the <br/>
tone deaf or the non-athletic.  Be as disrespectful as you can stand to be <br/>
about people who just cannot spell or dance.  But it&#39;s SCHOOL you should be <br/>
angry with, not with teachers who are among the billions who cannot change <br/>
human nature.<br/>

so efficient was he started his curfews and such on the German people. Way <br/>
before he ever started his campaign against Jewish people. He also supported <br/>
eugenics, and supported experiments on the German people to see if the <br/>
&quot;undesirable&quot; amongst the population could be weeded out and the &quot;desirable&quot; <br/>
bred in! The German people were so complacent, allowing their friends and <br/>
family who had mental problems, or birth defects to be taken away. They <br/>
didn&#39;t raise a stir when the doctors started measuring them with calipers and <br/>
recording head size, nose size, ear size... in their charts. All in the name <br/>
of helping the country build a better race. (The doctors were reporting on <br/>
the German people) They allowed all this to take place so it wasn&#39;t such a <br/>
*bad* thing (to them) when Hitler turned his hatred toward the Jews. The <br/>
rational was, he was just doing to the Jews what he had been doing to them <br/>
for years. Building a better race, weeding out all the big noses and large <br/>
ears, all the retarded and slow, the crazy and homosexual. It is always <br/>
easier to let someone else take over and do the dirty work. How sad.<br/>

efficient because after WW1 the treaty of Versailles was so harsh that<br/>
Germany wsa more or less crippled by it creating an environment whereby the<br/>
people of that nation became so depressed and without hope that when a man<br/>
&quot;Hitler&quot; came along and promised them hope and gave them hope - the people<br/>
blindly accepted.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Out of interest, did you know that (quote straight from a book) &quot;Hitler&#39;s<br/>
longtime personal chauffeur was so tiny that blocks were put under his seat<br/>
so that he might see over the steering wheel. The Brownshirt leader who<br/>
replaced the murdered Ernst Rohm was one-eyed; Joseph Goebbels had a<br/>
clubbfoot; the official photograther was an alcoholic and had a deformed<br/>
back. Hitler&#39;s press manager, Max Amann, and his first treasurer was one<br/>
armed; Amann was also dwarflike. The assistant press chief was stone deaf.<br/>
Martin Bormann was alcoholic, Rudolf Hess paranoid, Hermann Goring a<br/>
morphine addict; Robert Ley, master of the labor camps, had a speech<br/>
defect....Hitlers entourage, was most unusual for its collection of freaks<br/>
in high places, even as othersphysically like them were sytematically<br/>
expunged in death camps.&quot;</div>
