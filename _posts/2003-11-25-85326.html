<div id="ygrps-yiv-599459434">This is one of those &quot;it works&quot; stories. We got back from Hometown Buffet<br/>

Oh, I&#39;ve got one too!  I went with my daughter to her Girl Guides enrolment ceremony last night.  There was a table full of chips, donuts, cookies, cakes during the party afterwards and she didn&#39;t want any of it.  But as soon as we got home, she said she was hungry and asked for a bowl of oatmeal.  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that she just doesn&#39;t like donuts, cookies etc. - I took her and her younger brother out to get some donuts the other day because they asked.  The great thing is that she doesn&#39;t feel the need to eat them just because they are available (that&#39;s me!).<br/>

<br/>
But she isn&#39;t a true woman yet...walking away from chocolate, indeed.<br/>

Yesterday Keith and I went to see SWAT, at the dollar movie.<br/>
I was too sick to eat popcorn, but I was a little stomach-growly, so I <br/>
grabbed four little Dove chocolates from the office supplies drawer near my computer <br/>
and shared them with Keith on the way.   They were left (there were many <br/>
more) from two bags Marty bought me for Mother&#39;s Day.   It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like <br/>
chocolate, it&#39;s that even I finally had enough. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t surprise me that my recovery from desperation lasted longer than <br/>
most of my own children&#39;s childhoods.    But in the past few years I can let <br/>
stuff I really love sit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527069417">Hee hee, I have one also, last nite we came back from<br/>
the grocery store, and a friend was at the door.  As I<br/>
was putting the groceries away, including sugar wafers<br/>
that he had wanted, they got out the yogurt and the<br/>
string cheese.  His friend had never had string cheese<br/>
before, she liked it a lot! <br/>
