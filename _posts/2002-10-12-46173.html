I&#39;m just curious as to how you can equate &quot;teaching&quot; your 9 month old baby <br/>
and child led learning as the same thing?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Babies learn by example, they&#39;re not old enough to show what they want to <br/>
learn. Just like I say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;I love you&quot; to them, I <br/>
say things like color and shape names. It&#39;s just a part of play and life.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure I see it the same way. Babies don&#39;t necessarily learn by <br/>
example. Or I should say not always and we&#39;re talking little babies here. If <br/>
a baby was in a house where no one could walk and they all used wheelchairs, <br/>
the baby would still try to walk. I&#39;m not so sure that babies really learn a <br/>
lot of things. Babies learn what they need as far as comforting and and so <br/>
on but learning colors and shapes? I never made it a point to say all colors <br/>
and shapes to my babies when I was playing with them. Sometimes when I read <br/>
a book but not literally teaching them. When they were old enough, they <br/>
would ask &quot;that?&quot; and then I would tell them. That&#39;s child led. I don&#39;t see <br/>
teaching babies gives them any kind of upper hand later on in life and I <br/>
don&#39;t see it as necessarily a part of play and life at such a young age. Let <br/>
me add in this house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852461109">Yeah, but walking, I think, is more of an instinct than something to be learned. The boys, also, started asking me what things were really early, be a year-15 mths, and I&#39;d always answer them. Some days, I feel like that&#39;s all we did, was to walk around identifying things!! Since they went to work with me often, and I worked in various stores as a merchandiser, there was a LOT of things for them to ask about! LOL<br/>
