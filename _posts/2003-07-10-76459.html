&gt; not even easy for a very tired person to unschool or even to parent.<br/>

taking Zoloft. It was my inability to be there for my kids that made me step <br/>
out and get some help. I feel like I&#39;m finally coming awake after a year of <br/>
being in an emotional coma.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870905619">When I lost my father to cancer, I plunged hard into depression and anxiety - got on the SSRI&#39;s at first - then went to see the Orthomolecular Psychiatrist (who coined the phrase &quot;mega-vitamin thearapy&quot;) in Victoria, BC, Dr. Abram Hoffer.  If interested, try a google for [dr. &quot;abram hoffer&quot;].  I&#39;m taking mega B3, Vit. C and even 25 mg. folic acid daily.  Got off the SSRI&#39;s soon after.  Can&#39;t say enough about Dr. Hoffer - a pioneer and humanist.<br/>
