<div id="ygrps-yiv-54079882"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Casey&#39;s museum was called The Museum Of Life Learning. She had<br/>
 </span></blockquote>permanent<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; exhibits of rocks and gems, sea life, forest life, Indian artifacts, and<br/>
&gt; coins from around the world. She also had an art gallery. Then there was a<br/>
&gt; table for visiting or temporary exhibits. She had some of her brother&#39;s<br/>
&gt; stuff set up for the visiting exhibit. And she did something about the<br/>
&gt; Aztecs for a new, temporary one. Everything was laid out and labelled. She<br/>
&gt; also had some books around with more info. It was pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed!  Would have loved to have seen it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The museum was recently taken down to make way for her new project. &gt;She<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wants to start a real lending library now. We&#39;re shopping around for &gt;cheap<br/>
bookshelves for her to get started.<br/>
<br/>
What a great idea. Will she ship to Canada? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;By the way,  my daughter heard me reading about the museum out loud to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my husband.  She said &quot;Hey Mum, can you do that?&quot;  I said we didn&#39;t have a<br/>
guest room (thinking that might stall things a bit, ha), so she shouted<br/>
&quot;The living room!&quot;  Gee, thanks &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Go for it! Tell her she could set up shelves in her bedroom for displays<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the living room isn&#39;t feasible. It was basically taking all the cool stuff<br/>
&gt; we had collected over the years and sorting, classifying and labelling it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, I was just going through boxes, bags and containers full of things<br/>
we&#39;ve collected.  That would be a cool project if she wanted to do it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I can see it now.  A branch office of the Field Museum with dinosaurs<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and Egyptian mummies...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Why not? :o)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, why not!  We could even add sculptures created out of wet toilet<br/>
paper - her current passion :-D<br/>
