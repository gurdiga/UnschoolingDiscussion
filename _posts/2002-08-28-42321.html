&gt; learn from this list.  So that when they get to be 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 it <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; feel strange to continue on the way we have been all along.  I would hate <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; feel that since I don&#39;t need to be concerned (therefore don&#39;t belong??)  <br/>

&gt; it now I can just forget about it and come back in 3 yrs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t take, &quot;Just let them play,&quot; as meaning you shouldn&#39;t be thinking about <br/>
their learning. Its the same advice that parents of a 14 yo might get here. <br/>
We don&#39;t care how old your kids are  -  the principles of unschooling are the <br/>
same. Support your kids interests, help them discover their passions, provide <br/>
them with an enriched environment, live a good life, enjoy yourselves, be <br/>
curious, enjoy learning, work hard, make friends, laugh a lot, sing and play.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m thinking he can handle some pretty complicated ideas if<br/>
he gets to take them in on the comfort of his couch.  Do you want to<br/>
recommend anything?  (The rest of you are welcome to chime in.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s tons of stuff at my library. We just watched &quot;You Can&#39;t Take it With <br/>
You,&quot; the version with Jason Robards. I do recommend the &quot;Our Town&quot; that was <br/>
done on PBS with Glynnis Johns as Emily - NOT the old movie. I liked the <br/>
recent movie of &quot;Importance of Being Earnest&quot; but we were so immersed in it <br/>
that we were ready for a change from a simply straight version.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post more as I think of them.<br/>
