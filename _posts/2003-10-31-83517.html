path <br/>
of the racket head over the full swing, and the speed and angles of body <br/>
rotation.<br/>

They&#39;ll have &quot;right&quot; tennis moves so people can be tennis failures.<br/>

Different people&#39;s arms are different.  &quot;Angles&quot; are too scientific to apply <br/>
to human bodies.  And if there&#39;s an analyzed best way, experimentation will be <br/>
discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
I hope those who teach tennis don&#39;t get TOO scientific about it.<br/>

One size doesn&#39;t fit all.<br/>
