tangent I started and never finished) that was one of the things we had to<br/>
evaluate software on, whether the wrong answer produces a better screen<br/>
reaction than the right one.  One of the games had a little bell for the<br/>
correct answer and a dragon would come out and breathe fire for the wrong<br/>
one.  Which one would you pick?  I watched a group of kids playing it and<br/>
some kids would always pick the wrong answer just to see the dragon.  Others<br/>
would choose the right answer no matter what.  It was interesting to watch.<br/>

Ben likes to play this Shrek phonics game and I can&#39;t figure out why.  It<br/>
seems so repetitive.  I&#39;m not sure he has learned any phonics from it, which<br/>
is fine with me, but he likes it for some reason. I&#39;m trying to find another<br/>
Shrek game that maybe has something a little more involved. I think it is<br/>
the characters he finds appealing.  He really likes those adventure games<br/>
like Freddi the Fish, Putt Putt and Pajama Sam series.<br/>
<br/>
We were given software that was definitely an electronic workbook.  One of<br/>
them even graded that page with red checks or x&#39;s.  Ick.<br/>
His new favorite thing to do is go on websites.  He thinks that everything<br/>
has a website with games and activities.  &quot;mom, take me to dragons.com or<br/>
volcanoes.com&quot;.  Now he wants to make his own website.  Luckily, I&#39;m taking<br/>
an HTML class at the community college, so I will be able to help him make<br/>
one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660337400">One of the Reader Rabbit games that lydia likes has a parrot that pronounces words  -- you&#39;re supposed to select the letters so that it will make actual words, but since the parrot will say anythign that you select, Lydia always selects the combination that will make the funniest sound.   I admired the programming choice to make (for *its* purpose) the wrong selection is as useful in learning what letter make what sounds as the &quot;right&quot; answer.  Of course, Lydia&#39;s purpose is fun - and the wrong answer is even more useful for that. <br/>

<br/>
Did they discuss in that class the purpose of the games?  If a child can <br/>
choose a wrong answer to see a dragon, the child still knows what the right answer <br/>
is.<br/>

When my boys were reciting the pool rules wrong, after swim lessons years <br/>
ago, I still knew they knew the rules.   &quot;Never swim with a buddy, always swim <br/>
alone; always swim in a storm; always run by the pool...&quot;<br/>

Holly still plays Putt Putt sometimes.<br/>
