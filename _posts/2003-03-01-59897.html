There were five Pamelas in your class?  I never met another one in school, <br/>
but it does seem to be one of those unschooling names.<br/>

Amy Ruth, Amy Sue, Amy Marie, and Amy Jo.)<br/>

decided it was a &quot;baby name&quot; (probably due to extensive teasing from a <br/>

couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t stop were my Nanna and my brother, Marty. They&#39;re both <br/>
gone now, so I guess I&#39;m just plain old Mary again.<br/>

Hey, I&#39;m a plain old Mary again too!!! I was always a Mary Ann. Not one word <br/>
though, just a first and a middle. My mom always called me Mary but my dad <br/>
and his whole family called me Mary Ann. In school it was always Mary and <br/>
there was only one other Mary in my class. So I was Mary K and she was Mary <br/>
B. (hey, now I&#39;m a Mary B too) Anyway, when I moved to FL no one ever knew <br/>
of a Mary Ann. When my husband and I went north to PA to visit my family, he <br/>
was shocked to hear everyone refer to me as Mary Ann. It sounds funny to me <br/>
too when my northern relatives call me that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe that&#39;s why my Caitlin Elizabeth who was known from birth as Caity Beth <br/>
suddenly decided two years ago that she was just Caity and now wants to be <br/>
called only CAIT.  Guess to her that&#39;s more grown up.  Her brothers and <br/>
sisters still get riled up when she writes CAIT on anything, I guess they are <br/>
finding it hard to let her grow up too!<br/>
<br/>
Her friends from kindergarten and their parents all still refer to her as <br/>
Caity Beth, guess they weren&#39;t around for the &quot;transition&quot; of names so she&#39;s <br/>
stuck with the Caity Beth with some people for ever.<br/>
