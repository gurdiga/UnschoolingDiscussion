get it quite right, but here is the jist of it:<br/>
There was a very poor woman in some country in central or South America. She<br/>
was talking to a wealthy, well educated man at her church that was visiting<br/>
from America. He had given a sermon on the importance of bettering one&#39;s lot<br/>
in life by making the best use of whatever resources you currently have<br/>
available. She spoke to him afterwards and wanted to know how she could do<br/>
that when she didn&#39;t even know how to read. He told her that she could learn<br/>
to read if she wanted to. He also asked her what she did in her free time<br/>
and she said that she sat on her stoop and watched the ants. He told her<br/>
that she should learn about those ants and her stoop then. So, she found<br/>
someone to teach her to read. Then she found out what kind of ants crawled<br/>
on her stoop. She studied all about them which led to her studying about<br/>
other types of ants. She wrote to this man to update him on her progress<br/>
each time she learned something new. She also asked around to find out just<br/>
how her stoop was made and what it was made out of. This led to a study of<br/>
bricks and different types of building constructions. She eventually went on<br/>
to write books about the things she had learned and making quite a bit of<br/>
money.<br/>
<br/>
I may have the details not quite right, but the jist is that learning about<br/>
one thing kept leading to learning about something else. And a woman who<br/>
thought that she couldn&#39;t learn anything or make anything better out of her<br/>
life was able to do so. And she did it on her own. Kind of like unschooling,<br/>
don&#39;t you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152951653">That is a good story and I think it&#39;s like<br/>
unschooling.  I am assuming the women was not a young<br/>
girl of 12.  It shows how unschooling is for people of<br/>
all ages.  It&#39;s never to late to learn new things and<br/>
start new adventures.<br/>
