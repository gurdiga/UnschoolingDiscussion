 </span></blockquote>Eh... more like high 30&#39;s, although the other day it was high 40&#39;s and <br/>
seemed practically summer-like :-/  It&#39;s 35 right now. I&#39;m about 40 minutes <br/>
west of Gaithersburg, near Hagerstown - where I-70 and I-81 intersect, <br/>
about six miles from where the snipers were caught last year, and about 15 <br/>
miles from Antietam Battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m ready for spring :-)<br/>

<br/>
But it snowed here last night!!!!!!  We live just north of San Antonio and<br/>
we woke up to a beautiful dusting of snow.  I was getting real tired of the<br/>
rain but I can do this for a day or two &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147540335">After the cold snap of 10&#39;s for 2 or 3 weeks, 40 feels like spring.<br/>
<br/>
I hear the birds in the morning already, and I can smell the earth as its thawing.  I&#39;ve already seen robins, (I don&#39;t think they ever left this year), and the geese and flocks of birds have been around.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re going to have an early spring this year (yeah!!!!!), and the Farmer&#39;s Almanac says that April and may will be warmer than usual.<br/>
<br/>
Yahooooo!<br/>
