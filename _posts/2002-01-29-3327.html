&lt;&lt; Just because my point of view is different from yours, does it mean yours <br/>
is necessarily &#39;better&#39; or &#39;right&#39; because of &#39;how long&#39; you or I have been <br/>
unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a rough day here, some of the posters seemed out to cause trouble <br/>
rather than to discuss things in good faith, and I&#39;m not really in the mood <br/>
to rephrase what I wrote pretty clearly the first time, I think, so if you <br/>
really wonder what I wrote, maybe read it again tomorrow or read the <br/>
explanations others have made after it.<br/>
<br/>
When people come to a list like this or to an unschooling forum, and they <br/>
want unschooling experiences and information.    People with babies are <br/>
talking theory.  Those who just became unschoolers  may or may not have clear <br/>
ways of expressing what they&#39;re saying.  Some are totaly converts and will be <br/>
good witnesses.   They can say &quot;Don&#39;t do what we did&quot; about curriculum or <br/>
structure.<br/>
<br/>
But when several at once who have babies or are new unschoolers swarm over <br/>
the long-experienced unschoolers whose kids *have* come up through what we&#39;re <br/>
talking about for years, and when we&#39;re faced with &quot;I read a reference to a <br/>
study once&quot; to refute what we&#39;re saying we do (and why we do it and what our <br/>
positive results are), then it seems that the newer unschoolers or <br/>
prospective unscholers are not doing a great service to the other 120 readers <br/>
on the list who aren&#39;t actively engaged in the discussion.  <br/>
<br/>
I think experience is valuable, yes.  <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is to help empower people to expand their families&#39; <br/>
horizons.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that arguments for limiting those horizons won&#39;t be winning <br/>
arguments.<br/>

I&#39;m really really trying to understand your point here and figure out where *I* fit into the mix you have given..Your original statement was in response to someone (It may have been me as I have stated this recently as well..) saying: &lt;&lt;Of course I am new to the list..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You said: (My comments preceded by ***)<br/>
<br/>
And new to unschooling, maybe.  I think several of the people on the list are new to unschooling. ***this would be where *I* do fit in here..*** I don&#39;t want to try to say &quot;only people who&#39;ve unschooled for a year or more...&quot; or &quot;only those with kids over the age of five should post,&quot; but those with less experience should probably do more reading and less writing at first, at least.<br/>
<br/>
Now tell me; in all the discussions I have been involved in on this list, the only one I can find where you directly reference me was in regards to our every other month restaurant experiment (Where you state that every other month seems artificial and too structured and you wanted to know WHY an unschooler would do it this way..)..I answered that (financially we go out to eat every other month to a nice(r) restaurant, we save for it..) ..Other than that I really dont see where your comment (above) should fit into my activeness on this list...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 9 (going on 21).<br/>
<br/>
My son is 1.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not dealing with a baby as my oldest, nor am I a &#39;new&#39; parent at all..When you made the statement that you believe several people on the list are new and therefore X should happen, you included me by default into that group.<br/>
<br/>
My question is; do you really feel I could bring nothing to the table here? Will you dismiss my posts (you is general here) simply because I am &#39;new&#39; to unschooling? If so then I am talking to hear my own voice, and that is not the type of list experience I am looking for at ALL..<br/>
<br/>
THIS is why I am continuing this thread, to see where or IF I would be well served to stay on this list or find another one. <br/>
