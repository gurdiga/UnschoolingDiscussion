<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103278540">to question what I hadn&#39;t before.<br/>
<br/>
By now you all know what a clean neat freak I am.<br/>
<br/>
I have mentioned before that once a day we all usually clean up what&#39;s all <br/>
over the floor. My kids are always asked and I always expect that a no <br/>
answer would be okay. I never get a no except from Alyssa. (naturally, she&#39;s <br/>
2!) So the kids always pitch in and help and there hasn&#39;t been any problems <br/>
with the way it&#39;s been going. But lately I&#39;m starting to be more aware of <br/>
them asking me for things that aren&#39;t restricted. I think maybe that&#39;s just <br/>
the way the kids are.<br/>
<br/>
Such as, there&#39;s always a basket of candy available to all to eat. It&#39;s <br/>
always within reach and I never say no when they ask. But the kids always <br/>
ask anyway. They always ask to go outside even though the answer is always <br/>
yes. (out in back that is) If one asks to go out, I say yes and then the <br/>
other two will ask anyway, even though they KNOW it&#39;s okay. The kids even <br/>
use to ask me if they could get out of bed when they were little in the <br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
So I started to think that maybe me asking for clean up time is just <br/>
something they figure they can&#39;t say no to, since none of them ever have. So <br/>
as smooth as it&#39;s all been going, I decided to change that. My husband isn&#39;t <br/>
exactly happy and thinks I&#39;m nuts but what else is new?<br/>
<br/>
I sat down with the 3 kids and explained everything to them. I still would <br/>
like the parts of the house where everyone goes to be kept neat. As in <br/>
dining room and hallway. No one ever plays in the living room or kitchen <br/>
much at all. When those parts are cluttered, I&#39;ll start cleaning up and then <br/>
ask for help if I want it. The playroom and their bedrooms are up to them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little apprehensive as to how this will all go. I&#39;m hoping I can keep <br/>
my sanity about it all. It&#39;s been a few days and so far the things on the <br/>
floor have been few and far between. Not what I expected. Yesterday the <br/>
dining room was full of play doh and afterwards, all 3 cleaned up everything <br/>
they were playing with. I always clean the leftover play doh myself. Last <br/>
night the girls room was messy with loose beads all over the floor. I wanted <br/>
to vacuum so I just picked them up myself. The stuff on the floor in the <br/>
playroom was minimal. Today the playroom is spotless. They&#39;ve been in their <br/>
rooms all day. Not sure what hey look like now. I&#39;ll let you know how things <br/>
go in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
My husband seems to think not asking every night and just doing it myself <br/>
will make them see me as a maid. I don&#39;t see it that way and he&#39;s promised <br/>
to keep his mouth shut! So thanks for helping me question some more. Not <br/>
sure whether I will still say thanks in a month!! I feel now that I was <br/>
being coercive in that I was asking too much. Does that make sense??<br/>

<br/>
This is Mary B from two weeks ago.  I was thinking about this stuff more.  My <br/>
house isn&#39;t as clean as most people would like their houses.  I mopped the <br/>
kitchen the other night at 9:30.  It was the first time over a month it had <br/>
been more than just swept or spot-cleaned.  If I hadn&#39;t broken a glass, it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have been cleaned the time before this.  So if a neatnik came to my <br/>
house and I said &quot;Don&#39;t make them help&quot; she might run screaming that I was <br/>
crazy and she was going STRAIGHT home to make her kids clean house.<br/>
<br/>
And she might be right.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
When I want help doing something, I gauge it against what the kid&#39;s already <br/>
doing.  If one kid is just kinda bouncing a ball or watching my  husband cut <br/>
wood, I&#39;ll probably ask that one before I&#39;ll ask the one who&#39;s on the phone <br/>
or playing with a friend.  It&#39;s not easy to describe.  I think because I <br/>
prize human interaction, I like to think of chores more as a human <br/>
interaction opportunity.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t ask anyone for help.  Sometimes I ask EVERYONE for help, if <br/>
we&#39;re going to have company or we need a big clear space to do a big project.<br/>
<br/>
But because human interaction is more important to me than sanitation and <br/>
home decorating, then  my advice is skewed that way.   I almost want to be <br/>
apologetic, but then I remind myself that this list is about unschooling and <br/>
related parenting and logistics stuff, and not about home-perfection.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose there might be sites or lists about how to keep your home totally <br/>
photo-ready, but I wouldn&#39;t want to be on one.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I see a little mess and I wonder whether it&#39;s worth the disruption <br/>
or interuption or unhappiness that would be caused by me going and as<br/>
king/making the kid clean it, or berating him in front of a friend.  <br/>
Sometimes the answer is &quot;Yes, worth it,&quot; and more often it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
If I can buy peace and happiness by picking up candy wrappers or cereal <br/>
bowls, sometimes I do that joyfully.  Little voices in my head sometimes say <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re training them to leave things lying around.&quot;  But my own voice says <br/>
&quot;They&#39;ve picked up after me, willingly, and peacefully, and they will again <br/>
if I don&#39;t screw this relationship up.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well I know it hasn&#39;t been two weeks, but I&#39;m reporting anyway! Things have <br/>
gone a lot better than I expected and also better than my husband thought <br/>
too. The playroom actually doesn&#39;t get as cluttered as when we had clean up <br/>
time. The kids rooms are messier but out of my sight for the most part and <br/>
therefore easier for me to handle.<br/>
<br/>
Joe has stayed out of it and sees where it actually works fine. He still <br/>
might think I&#39;m playing maid but not saying it. &lt;bg&gt; I have been watching <br/>
what is important to me and what seems to be important to the kids. I&#39;ve had <br/>
to cut way back on my anal tendencys. I hate to see anything lying on the <br/>
floor unless it&#39;s one of the dogs. Well I&#39;ve managed to not be bothered by <br/>
the little things the kids leave behind. When it gets to me, I pick it up. <br/>
And the clean up for me isn&#39;t that much. It seems to go quick and more times <br/>
than not, without asking, I have one child at least behind me picking <br/>
something up also.<br/>
<br/>
Their rooms I ask for a path, as I always have. I also ask for them not to <br/>
play right in the doorway. Other than that, their rooms definitely look <br/>
played in. Joseph was up until about 2:00 last night cleaning his room and <br/>
also playing some. He says he wants to finish it today. I haven&#39;t vacuumed <br/>
in there for at least a week and a half. The girls room I was able to vacuum <br/>
today for the most part except for a small area around Alyssa and her <br/>
Barbies.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the house is mine and it&#39;s more than enough to satisfy my <br/>
cleaning urges. I always mop and vacuum every day so &quot;our&quot; part of the house <br/>
is great and the kids part.....well looks like the kids part. And I&#39;m <br/>
actually okay with that. If nothing else, I&#39;ve managed to get a hold <br/>
somewhat of my need to have absolutely everything neat.<br/>
<br/>
I think the kids are happier, my husband and I are and the house still looks <br/>
presentable, just more like kids live here. That&#39;s not a bad thing! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

whole different feeling about it. I felt a rush of relief at this one <br/>
statement of yours, that it gives me permission to let go of all the <br/>
frustration I feel when my kid doesn&#39;t want to help. I can ask in a different <br/>
way with a different energy. <br/>
Thank you, that appeared at just the right time. In fact, I may not ask again <br/>
for along time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was lovely.  For me, relationship wins out over an arbitrary to-do list <br/>
every time.  It reminded me of an afternoon some time ago when Colton and I <br/>
went to a local mall.  We window shopped and talked about everything and <br/>
nothing.  Then we went to a card shop and I bought him some trading cards and <br/>
a comic book, for the simple reason that it made me feel good to do it.  <br/>
After that, I asked if he&#39;d like some ice cream.  He looked at me, stunned, <br/>
held out his bag of goodies and said, &quot;Do you mean I get ice cream after all <br/>
THIS?!?!&quot;  I smiled and my son and told him that I really, *really* loved <br/>
him.  He lit up like a Christmas tree.  This happened right after the <br/>
Columbine tragedy, and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if those two boys had ever <br/>
received unconditional love and grace.  I pray I never forget what I learned <br/>
that afternoon.<br/>

who I am (which is a very creative, lots of projects, lots of play <br/>
kind of person who doesn&#39;t have the time or energy to clean a house <br/>
like a lot of people do) and to be happy about being who I am.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still trying to learn how to not be stressed and not feel like <br/>
I&#39;m neglecting the kids when I have to clean before company, but I&#39;m <br/>
getting better I think.  I&#39;ve been trying to make a conscious effort <br/>
to tell myself that this is who I am and that I don&#39;t need to put a <br/>
front on for other people (as in staying up until 4 am trying to get <br/>
the house presentable).  <br/>

If you stay up til 4:00 cleaning, you&#39;ll never be as...  unconcerned about it <br/>
as I am.<br/>
I bet you don&#39;t have cardboard boxes of good stuff in the corner of just <br/>
about every room in your house, but I do. &lt;g&gt;  I was just brought another <br/>
two-drawer filing cabinet by my husband.  He&#39;s cleaning out the storage room <br/>
at our old house (slowy) which had (slowly) inherited stuff from our elderly <br/>
neighbor&#39;s house.    Now  I have to buy frames and hanging folders.  Or maybe <br/>
just stuff books in there. &lt;g&gt;   Packrattery here, everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look at me if you&#39;re a housecleaning type.  I&#39;m not good at it.<br/>

Try to consciously remind yourself to step back and look at your thoughts <br/>
when they go off like this. I find that really helps to break the cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it, if no one else in the whole world vacuums every day, then <br/>
it&#39;s okay for us not to? (I don&#39;t either!!) Or is it if no one mentions it, <br/>
we&#39;re okay? Or is it if we don&#39;t think about it we&#39;re okay?<br/>
<br/>
Or is it that we&#39;re just okay because we are? :o)<br/>
<br/>
From my perspective, just like every child is different, every household is <br/>
different. Each one will require a different level and type of care. You&#39;ll <br/>
know what your house needs to keep it clean enough to be healthy and dirty <br/>
enough to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I so don&#39;t get how you have the time or energy to mop and vacuum<br/>
every day.  It is posts like this (or real life conversations like<br/>
this) that get me feeling very down about how I&#39;m not having time to<br/>
keep the house as clean as a lot of people do.<br/>
But I&#39;m learning to not let it bother me.  I&#39;m learning to just be<br/>
who I am (which is a very creative, lots of projects, lots of play<br/>
kind of person who doesn&#39;t have the time or energy to clean a house<br/>
like a lot of people do) and to be happy about being who I am.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Being happy with who we all are is the most important thing. Because then we <br/>
will be happy about who are kids are too. Not worrying about some standard <br/>
set about by &quot;other&quot; people.<br/>
<br/>
I envy you for being crafty. I find it very hard to do. I don&#39;t naturally <br/>
think along those lines. I don&#39;t naturally think about how to do crafty <br/>
things. My kids love it. So I force myself. I actually have to. I get on the <br/>
internet late at night and sometimes spend hours looking for things I know I <br/>
could present and that my kids would enjoy doing. I have a great sense of <br/>
accomplishment when my kids are done and they are happy with their finished <br/>
products. It takes a lot for me though. Christmas was so trying that <br/>
Valentines day went by without a single craft. Okay my kids didn&#39;t ask, but <br/>
I&#39;m sure if I would have mentioned it they would have wanted to do <br/>
something. I&#39;ll try for Easter. But it really is a chore for me.<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning isn&#39;t like that for me. I guess maybe I&#39;ve been like that all my <br/>
life. It&#39;s easy for me to do. I enjoy doing it and it&#39;s also important for <br/>
me. To be neat and clean. To have a place for everything. So THAT&#39;S part of <br/>
who I am. I&#39;m also blessed with great kids that allow me the time to do <br/>
those things. Joseph is 8 and Sierra is 7 and they play so well with each <br/>
other most of the time and of course the 2 year old follows right behind <br/>
them. They play with her well also. So that alone gives me the time to do <br/>
what I want. I grab those times to clean. Being that I clean every day, <br/>
there isn&#39;t that much to do even though my house is rather big. Mopping <br/>
every day actually takes less time than if I did it once a week. The floor <br/>
is practically spotless anyway and cleaning something that isn&#39;t real dirty <br/>
takes less time. That&#39;s my secret. I actually have one of those clorox mops <br/>
and mop the whole floor once a day and spot mop like 3-4 times. Same with <br/>
cleaning bathrooms and such. I do one load of laundry every day. That way I <br/>
don&#39;t get overwhelmed and spend hours doing it at the end of the week. Being <br/>
that these things take less time, I can grab 20 minutes while the kids eat <br/>
breakfast or lunch. I can grab 20 minutes when all 3 take a shower. (my <br/>
husband takes charge of that every night) I can grab 20 minutes while they <br/>
watch Rugrats or go and visit grandma next door. 20 minutes 2 or 3 times a <br/>
day amounts to a lot of time to clean something. I also make sure that if <br/>
someone needs me, to reach something they can&#39;t or just listen to a story of <br/>
theirs, I stop what I&#39;m doing. That&#39;s when cleaning can wait. About the only <br/>
time I try to schedule uninterrupted is when the carpets get cleaned. I have <br/>
my own machine. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s time management. That&#39;s the key. That and being happy with ones <br/>
self.<br/>

dust&quot; (from the Thomas the tank engine movie), and thought that our <br/>
house would be magical if he distributed it everywhere. &lt;grin&gt; <br/>
<br/>
The diningroom table was cleaned off once today, but now half of it <br/>
has the kids&#39; snack stuff on it (still being munched on) and the <br/>
other half is covered with a project the kids are doing.  The <br/>
diningroom floor is covered with craft stuff (glitter, paper scraps, <br/>
pom poms, etc.) from two days ago that I haven&#39;t had time to take <br/>
care of yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Even though I ran the dishwasher 3 times yesterday and once so far <br/>
today, there is an overflowing sinkful of dishes to be done.  The <br/>
kitchen floor is badly in need of cleaning.  <br/>
<br/>
The livingroom couch is full of unfolded clean laundry.  The floor is <br/>
covered with legos and beanie babies.  Not neat lego things that <br/>
people made, but legos scattered everywhere.  We&#39;re talking 45 <br/>
minutes of straightening up before vacuuming would be possible.  <br/>
<br/>
The foyer has a bunch of stuff all over it, like stuff that we <br/>
brought in from the car and haven&#39;t gotten a chance to put away yet. <br/>
A bag of coloring books and crayons that we took along to the skating <br/>
rink, Alisha&#39;s backpack full of doll stuff, a bag of non-refrigerated <br/>
groceries that hasn&#39;t been put away yet. A few pairs of shoes too and <br/>
I bet there&#39;s a sock or two laying around.  <br/>
<br/>
My bedroom is filled with lots of boxes of packratee stuff.  So is <br/>
the hallway and both rooms in the attic.  The boys&#39; room has stuff <br/>
all over the floor.  Alisha&#39;s room is under construction so that is <br/>
excusable. <br/>

&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am definitely not a housecleaning type.  I am perfectly content <br/>
living amid my clutter.  It doesn&#39;t phase me in the least--until <br/>
someone says they&#39;re coming over or someone knocks on the door.  We <br/>
have girls&#39; club in our house once a week and some very housecleany <br/>
moms accompany their daughters.  Instead of having fun with my <br/>
daughter all day Tuesday getting ready for it, I stress out big time <br/>
and pretty much ignore the kids getting the house clean. Usually <br/>
Monday night I do stay up until 4 am and then drag myself through <br/>
Tuesdays exhausted, looking forward to it all being over.  I LOVE <br/>
having the girls at my house and I LOVE the cool projects we do.  I <br/>
just can&#39;t handle the cleaning that I do in order to prepare for it. <br/>
That has to change.   My problem is getting to the point where I <br/>
don&#39;t care that some people will judge me because my house is a <br/>
mess.  <br/>
<br/>
So yep, I look to you and think that your attitude toward <br/>
housecleaning is something that I would like to emulate.  <br/>

Or did he just hate lunch and there it went?<br/>
<br/>
(joking)<br/>
<br/>
My husband had an unexpected big sink drain repair in the kitchen, involving <br/>
(of course) an odd-sized hose, a dishwasher, a garbage disposal, two fully <br/>
broken pieces of metal...    Five trips to the hardware store(s).  Partly <br/>
because he&#39;s cheap and wants to just get parts he HAS to have.  So instead of <br/>
saying &quot;Was it worth FIVE trips?&quot; I just said he was wonderful, and thank you <br/>
THANK you and sorry it took so long and do you want some food?<br/>
<br/>
I had just returned from driving an hour to deliver Kirby and his girlfriend <br/>
to a party in another town, so I missed the frustration and got back just in <br/>
time to hold the flashlight for the last hose and hoseclamp moments.<br/>
<br/>
Poor Keith.  He hates to hire plumbers and he doesn&#39;t like plumbing.  <br/>
<br/>
From my point of view it was a great excuse to clean out under the sink.<br/>
I need great excuses to do things like that because they just never seem as <br/>
fun as playing with kids or writing or renting a video out the back gate at <br/>
Hollywood Video.  I love living right by Hollywood Video.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I&#39;m not necessary crafy-creative.  I don&#39;t do neatly packaged <br/>
crafts as often as a lot of homeschoolers I know.  But I am creative <br/>
in thinking up fun, spur- of-the moment things to do.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a craft cupboard, with all kinds of stuff that the kids have <br/>
free reign to use.  There is all kinds of ribbons, glitter, buttons, <br/>
pom poms, pipe cleaners, wiggly eyes, etc.  They do their own thing <br/>
with it.  They also have free access to glue, paper, markers, tape, <br/>
yarn, etc. My dad owns a flea market so I get a lot of free crafty <br/>
stuff for them to play with there.  I don&#39;t think you have to plan a <br/>
whole lot of cute little crafts for kids to make them happy (unless <br/>
they specifically want you to of course).  Just give them access to a <br/>
bunch of stuff and let them have fun with it.  My kids have all kinds <br/>
of creations taped to walls all over the house.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately they&#39;ve been pretending they&#39;re cats.  They get bowls of dry <br/>
cereal, milk, and water and put it all over the house.  Then they <br/>
crawl around on all fours and eat it.  And they cleared a whole <br/>
bookshelf full of toys out of the family room to display their beanie <br/>
babies.  They divided the family room up into different &quot;houses&quot;.  <br/>
They take containers out of the kitchen filled with water so that <br/>
they can wash their &quot;kitty&quot; dishes when their done.  They invite me <br/>
to their &quot;houses&quot; for dinner.  When my daughter wants to play house <br/>
and wants me to be her kid at the same time my son wants me to play <br/>
house and be his cat and they start fighting over it, I have to be <br/>
creative and find a way to make everyone happy.  (I ended up being a <br/>
kid who could turn into a cat, which led me to tell them that I think <br/>
they would really like the movie Shaggy Dog).  That&#39;s the creative <br/>
stuff I&#39;m talking about.  <br/>
<br/>
But giving kids free access to craft stuff, tons of toys, and letting <br/>
them eat pretend cat food in bowls makes for a messy house.  <br/>

<br/>
Okay after reading your post I was ready to come to your house and help!! Do <br/>
you live very far away from FL?? I think maybe I&#39;ll rent myself out and make <br/>
some extra cash. But hey, you sound as if you are perfectly happy with <br/>
things being that way. So to hell with everyone else who may come to your <br/>
house. If they don&#39;t like it, they can go elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
When I have company, I go to no extra ordinary measures in our house. About <br/>
the only thing I will do that I normally don&#39;t do is frett where everyone is <br/>
going to sit to eat. I have a very large dining room but unfortunately only <br/>
a table that seats 8 in a tight squeeze. So I get crazy with the card table <br/>
and long folding table and if I have enough folding chairs. Other than that, <br/>
the house is as it usually is. The kids will clean their rooms from the <br/>
clutter just so they can play in there if other kids are coming. So I keep <br/>
things as is, if people don&#39;t like it, tough. Nothing in my house is new, <br/>
it&#39;s all second hand. I don&#39;t have a showcase here. Just one that I keep as <br/>
neat and clean as I can. So no different measures here for company. Unless <br/>
of course you count cooking!!!!<br/>

LOL!!!! I have hated that wallpaper in there since the day we moved in 2 <br/>

taking off the paper from the bottom and the previous owners had some very <br/>
large poster type picture on one wall of the ocean and boats and stuff. Very <br/>
tacky looking. Now what got into Joe today that made him decide to tackle it <br/>
now I have no idea. I could have waited so that I had time to adjust to all <br/>
the mess. Yes it is driving me nuts. I want to clean up now so bad but it <br/>
will just be a mess again tomorrow so Joe said to wait. He thinks the <br/>
previous owners used super glue to put on the wallpaper. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

My kids have a whole cupboard in the playroom of stuff like that. All kinds <br/>
of paints, glitter, glues, felt, ribbon, yard, different kinds of scissors, <br/>
stencils, eyes, pom poms, pipe cleaners, beads, etc. We always have tons of <br/>
paper here too along with all kinds of crayons and markers. My kids very <br/>
rarely get into that stuff. I keep thinking maybe it&#39;s because of me not <br/>
being craft minded. They both love to draw a lot and even Tara still likes <br/>
coloring and doing collage type stuff with pictures and all. But none of <br/>
them do craft things alone. If I find something and present it, they&#39;ll do <br/>
it then. That&#39;s why I force myself to do so, I feel like they are missing <br/>
out because I&#39;m not naturally like that and they have never been exposed to <br/>
that kind of thinking.<br/>

Sorry about that, they don&#39;t have yard in the cupboard. I meant yarn!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Cleaning isn&#39;t like that for me. I guess maybe I&#39;ve been like that all my <br/>
 life. It&#39;s easy for me to do. I enjoy doing it and it&#39;s also important for <br/>
 me. To be neat and clean. To have a place for everything. So THAT&#39;S part of <br/>
 who I am. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really think you belong with MY dh!!! lol<br/>
Are you sure your mother didn&#39;t give up a baby boy for adoption in &#39;64? cuz <br/>
I&#39;d swear you&#39;re related.....he could have written the above.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770389500"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I so don&#39;t get how you have the time or energy to mop and vacuum <br/>
&gt; every day.  It is posts like this (or real life conversations like<br/>
&gt; this) that get me feeling very down about how I&#39;m not having time to<br/>
&gt; keep the house as clean as a lot of people do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I&#39;m learning to not let it bother me.  I&#39;m learning to just be<br/>
&gt; who I am (which is a very creative, lots of projects, lots of play<br/>
&gt; kind of person who doesn&#39;t have the time or energy to clean a house<br/>
&gt; like a lot of people do) and to be happy about being who I am.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the difference is probably that those of us who &quot;have the time and<br/>
energy&quot; actually enjoy these tasks (making them not tasks so much as hobbies<br/>
&lt;g&gt;) and/or so much enjoy the result that the task itself doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
draining or onerous.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m doing something I enjoy (which includes the dishes) I have much<br/>
more energy for it, and will make more time, than when I&#39;m doing something I<br/>
don&#39;t enjoy. When I&#39;m cleaning I&#39;m also thinking, and planning, and<br/>
daydreaming, and singing, and talking to those around me. It gives me energy<br/>
to clean and live amidst order, rather than taking energy away from me.<br/>
<br/>
(((Important Caveat: Many days around here you would never know that I enjoy<br/>
cleaning or living in a clean house. Right now it appears that a pinata<br/>
filled with socks and used chocolate milk glasses was recently beaten open<br/>
over my downstairs living area. My enjoyment of cleaning and cleanliness<br/>
does NOT always equal the actual time to get to it as often as I&#39;d like.<br/>
Priorities for me generally go: people, pets, paid work, cleaning and other<br/>
hobbies, so it can and often does end up undone. I contrive to breathe<br/>
another day and put it out of my mind, most of the time. &lt;g&gt;)))<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m still trying to learn how to not be stressed and not feel like<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m neglecting the kids when I have to clean before company, but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; getting better I think.  I&#39;ve been trying to make a conscious effort<br/>
&gt; to tell myself that this is who I am and that I don&#39;t need to put a<br/>
&gt; front on for other people (as in staying up until 4 am trying to get<br/>
&gt; the house presentable).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One solution is to have less company. :) A better one is to let your<br/>
housekeeping weed out the icky people who will judge you on a cluttered<br/>
house, thereby selecting for those who overlook such mundanity in their own<br/>
search for nice people to hang out with.<br/>

NO KIDDING!! My poor dh is doomed to feeling slightly edgy around us all the <br/>
time.<br/>
He eyes the project that is starting up, asks if I know what&#39;s going on, I <br/>
wave a nonchalant hand and tell him that yes, I do know and don&#39;t worry about <br/>
it and he just slinks off to his hideout.<br/>
Later, when things are disastrous, he gives me this &quot;I told you this would <br/>
happen&quot; kind of look....but bites his tongue.<br/>
Yesterday, it was bingo markers, stamped so hard on the paper that they <br/>
splattered the floor and table with ink. He looked positively ill.<br/>
I just don&#39;t have much sympathy for him anymore, as sad as that may be.<br/>
I think he should have a clue how I operate by now, if not, oh well....:) The <br/>
kids sanity is more important to me than his. I only say that because he has <br/>
his own area of the house to go to....and I refuse to make myself insane <br/>
trying to keep it to his standard.<br/>
I try to get things straightened to help him feel calm, but with four <br/>
creative kids, there is no way it&#39;ll look like his perfect corner of the <br/>
house!!!<br/>
I wish I knew how to help him feel calm amidst chaos...it&#39;s a learned art I <br/>
think.<br/>

Maybe there are drugs for that!<br/>
<br/>
And if there is such a drug, maybe any teacher with more than two ADHD kids <br/>
in a class could take that drug so the kids could be drug-free and the <br/>
teacher would be calm and happy amidst chaos!<br/>

cabinet, then it just must not be their thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that of course our interests are going to reflect in the <br/>
kids.  I don&#39;t think we should be guilty because our kids aren&#39;t <br/>
really into something that we&#39;re also not into.  And of course the <br/>
stuff that we are really into they have a better chance of getting <br/>
into because they&#39;re expose to it more.  That&#39;s the way life is. :) <br/>
