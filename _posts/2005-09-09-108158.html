If kids are having too much fun or irritating one another, or looking at one <br/>
another, or showing off for one another, they pay less attention to the <br/>
teacher.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one reason.   <br/>
<br/>
Another is that the same way they seem to think people have to get up and get <br/>
ready 180 times a year or more as practice for getting up and getting ready <br/>
the first day one has a real job, they claim that practice dressing acceptably <br/>
will help people dress acceptably for work when they go to work.<br/>

I can understand that.  But no sleeveless or cap sleeves?  We&#39;re  not talking <br/>
slinky tops, we are talking normal ladies sleeveless blouses are  <br/>
unacceptable.<br/>
 <br/>
T-shirts are absolutely fine AND encouraged, as long as the message on one  <br/>
(if there is one)is educational.  Of course in OUR world, ANYTHING could/is  <br/>
considered educational, in the public school world, it is not.<br/>
 <br/>
I have to think that a lot more educating might go on if students (and this  <br/>
dress code now applies to ALL grades) were happy to be in the place they are <br/>
and  not feel scrutinized for everything about themselves, personal appearance  <br/>
included.<br/>
 <br/>
I just wonder why they don&#39;t say uniforms and be done with it.   Prisons wear <br/>
them, how far behind can it be?<br/>
