sending our kids to school never crossed my mind. I&#39;ll be happy to <br/>
elaborate on that if anyone&#39;s interested, but it will have to wait <br/>

(How&#39;s that for a free plug? I can do even better, though. Have you <br/>
seen the incredible subscription offer in the current issue of the <br/>
Unschooling.com newsletter? It&#39;s available at the Unschooling.com <br/>
site... and if you&#39;ve never seen HEM we&#39;ll even send you a free <br/>
sample no strings issue! Now *that&#39;s* a free plug!)<br/>

homeschooling by a friend&#39;s stack of Home Education Magazines.  I spent a<br/>
lot of time hanging out at this friend&#39;s house when my son was an infant. <br/>
I spent a lot of time sitting on the couch nursing and reading every word<br/>
of the magazines.<br/>
