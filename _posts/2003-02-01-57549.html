&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is a list of what I have been able to find out on short notice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Space Shuttle Columbia Breaks Up 40 Miles High Over Texas<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here are the salient points as I have been able to gather them<br/>
&gt; from several sources.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  Speed was about 12,500 MPH. . .or Mach 6, 6 x speed of sound.<br/>
&gt;     [Note speed of sound is faster at higher altitudes]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  Time of the event:  Earliest eyewitness [earwitness] 8:09 CST<br/>
&gt;     Last telemetry received 8:16 CST / 9:16 EST.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  Earliest eyewitness says the Columbia zigzagged before breaking up.<br/>
&gt;     [You don&#39;t get to zigzag much at 12,500 MPH without breaking up.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4.  Prolonged very loud sound, multiple people said it was 90 seconds,<br/>
&gt;     where a normal sonic boom is only a fraction of a second.  Whether<br/>
&gt;     this was due to multiple sonic booms from the dozens of pieces, or<br/>
&gt;     from an ongoing explosion was not stated. . .I&#39;m guessing at these<br/>
&gt;     were multiple sonic boom effects, prolonged by the pieces not in a<br/>
&gt;     &quot;flight attitude&quot; that would minimize atmospheric air contact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5.  Many pieces on ground southeast of Dallas, witnesses said they can<br/>
&gt;     only describe the sound made coming down as &quot;boomerang sound.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 6.  Looking at the NASA graph, right hand screen, which I presume is a<br/>
&gt;     &quot;glide path&quot;. . .I can see that the Columbia was not pulling up, I<br/>
&gt;     do NOT know if they should have been at 200,000 ft. . .I have been<br/>
&gt;     to NASA and flew a shuttle simulator, but I don&#39;t recall what they<br/>
&gt;     had as the optimal altitude to start pulling up.  My apologies.<br/>
&gt;     A little Google search found that shuttles level off at 2,000 feet<br/>
&gt;     . . .so perhaps they were still on the glide path at the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 7.  I&#39;m probably stretching as far as I can here, will try to find out<br/>
&gt;     a bit more and get back to you. . .some of this is NOT repeated on<br/>
&gt;     the network news coverage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My apologies for any errors, typos, etc., I&#39;m doing the best I can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
