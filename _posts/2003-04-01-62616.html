&lt;&lt; We never ate fish when I was growing up (I still don&#39;t, usually).  My<br/>
 mom hated fish because her parents served it every single Friday and<br/>
 every single time they served it, her mom would say, &quot;Don&#39;t choke to<br/>
 death on the bones.&quot;  That effectively ruined her appetite for fish. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aaaah....and I have all these lovely memories surrounding fish.<br/>
Maybe growing up in Alaska did it. :) We went fishing in the most incredibly <br/>
scenic area, near Valdez, ate our fresh catches and slept full and happy in a <br/>
smoke filled cabin.<br/>
I have warm fuzzies just thinking about it. Fishing with my Dad, the <br/>
excitement of the catch, the smell of fresh fish on the woodstove, Halibut <br/>
with creamy cheese sauce, laughter and stories and kerosene lamps hissing at <br/>
night.<br/>
Sigh....<br/>
No wonder I still like Salmon and Halibut!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
