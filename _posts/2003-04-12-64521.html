<br/>
Oh yikes! is all I can say.  I was raised in a scientology family.  I doubt<br/>
they have anything to say about spanking, but if your parent is an &quot;auditor&quot;<br/>
your questions and statements will all be met with, &quot;Thank you&quot; or &quot;Ok&quot;.  As<br/>
in, &quot;I hate you, Mom!&quot;  &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My mother was eventually &quot;excommunicated&quot; (called suppressive to<br/>
scientology) for disagreeing with L. Ron Hubbard, and my father wasn&#39;t<br/>
allowed to communicate with her.  I have *nothing* good to say about<br/>
scientology.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you weren&#39;t involved in the 50s and 60s.  Maybe they&#39;ve changed since<br/>
L Ron died, but it would surprise me.  My mother was a fully qualified<br/>
&quot;auditor&quot; with tons of training in their &quot;org&quot; and her minister&#39;s license.<br/>
I had an &quot;intensive&quot; (from<br/>
someone else - but with those same infuriating &quot;thank you&#39;s&quot;) when I was<br/>
about 10 which certainly would have been considered child abuse.  I finally<br/>
literally escaped out a bathroom window.  It was horrific.<br/>
<br/>
My father died in England while there for &quot;processing&quot; that was supposed to<br/>
cure his cancer.  He had paid for a couple of years worth of &quot;processing&quot;<br/>
and died a few weeks later.  Did his estate ever receive a refund?  Not a<br/>
chance.  In *my* eyes, the organization is evil.<br/>
<br/>
Ya gotta love this quote from their site.  &quot;A maxim in Scientology is that<br/>
only those things which one finds true for himself are true. In Scientology<br/>
one learns to think for himself - it is a voyage of self-discovery.&quot;  I<br/>
guess that&#39;s why they kicked my mother out when she disagreed with L Ron.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s another one related to that.  &quot;suppressive person: a person who<br/>
possesses a distinct set of characteristics and mental attitudes that cause<br/>
him to suppress other people in his vicinity. This is the person whose<br/>
behavior is calculated to be disastrous. Also called antisocial personality.<br/>
&quot;  In the mid 60s this label was applied to anyone who disagreed in even the<br/>
slightest way with the big cheese.  (I don&#39;t remember now what the<br/>
disagreement was, but it was *very* minor.  They didn&#39;t tolerate *any*<br/>
disagreement about anything in those days.  I&#39;d be really surprised if it&#39;s<br/>
changed.)<br/>

One of my best friends worked at the headquarters in the 1980&#39;s. She was <br/>
FULLY involved and when it&#39;s mentioned now, her eyes get big and she <br/>
stretches her head back and just LOOKS at you until the subject changes.<br/>
<br/>
That says a lot. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558831921">LOL.  I&#39;ve had auditing and been acknowledged with &quot;thank yous&quot; for answering <br/>
the questions, but never found it maddening.  Did you really climb out the <br/>
window to get away?  Who said you had to stay there in the first place?  If I <br/>
was made to get auditing when I didn&#39;t want to, I&#39;d climb out the window too! <br/>
 LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re speaking of experiences from over 30 years ago, by your <br/>
reference to the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s.  I&#39;m sure it must have been at least a little <br/>
different then.  <br/>
<br/>
Regarding your father, someone unfortunately gave you wrong information, as <br/>
it&#39;s well known in Scientology that auditing is never sold with a promise of <br/>
curing anything.  How could it.  People have been known to &quot;cure&quot; themselves <br/>
after auditing of all manner of ailments, but it&#39;s entirely an individual <br/>
thing.  There&#39;s no way they would or could make a claim like that.  If anyone <br/>
ever says differently, you can tell them they&#39;re a bunch of crap.<br/>
<br/>
Your mother being declared a suppressive person is unfortunate.  I&#39;ve seen it <br/>
happen, but only after it&#39;s demonstrated they are causing harm in some way to <br/>
others, and will not discontinue.  I don&#39;t know if your mother was the one <br/>
that insisted you sit in the auditing chair when you didn&#39;t want to, but <br/>
that&#39;s one example I can think of that could be considering harming someone.  <br/>
Taking away your self-determinism (...although the escape out the window was <br/>
a good way to get it back!  LOL)  Another suppressive act is spreading lies <br/>
about Scientology or Scientologists.  One that comes to mind is that your <br/>
father bought auditing to cure his cancer.  Not that these necessarily came <br/>
from your mother, but in looking at the entire package you&#39;re presenting <br/>
about your experiences and your obvious aversion, coupled with your mother <br/>
being &quot;ousted&quot;, perhaps there&#39;s a connection.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen all manner of people&#39;s disagreements with Scientology, and I&#39;ve <br/>
never seen someone ousted for them.  It is not intolerant as you make it <br/>
seem, though they don&#39;t tolerate the harming of others or what they&#39;re trying <br/>
to accomplish, which is to just help people become more able.  I&#39;m sure we <br/>
could debate this for days and weeks and months, but right now I&#39;m in the <br/>
middle of doing my taxes and the clock is tick tick ticking away.<br/>

convinced him that he might be able to cure himself.  What angered me was<br/>
that he had paid in advance for a *lot* of auditing and training that he<br/>
never got.  And we never got one penny refund.<br/>

Ron.  Someone  from the org asked her to say that she didn&#39;t really think<br/>
that way, which she refused to do.  She wasn&#39;t into lying.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I had agreed to the intensive (because I desperately wanted to stop<br/>
wetting the bed).  It was the auditor who wouldn&#39;t let me leave, someone<br/>
they had been led to believe was *very* good.  When I got out and called my<br/>
mother, she came and got me right away, and that was the end of it for me.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope.  That was all *after* she was excommunicated.  In fact, the only way<br/>
he was allowed to go was if he &quot;disconnected&quot; from her.  (They were<br/>
separated at the time but still good friends.)  As far as the cancer went,<br/>
it was his belief that it was his only hope.  The docs had said they could<br/>
do nothing for him.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

at that time.<br/>

off people.  I haven&#39;t seen anything since that would change my impressions.<br/>

it.)<br/>

subject and make it seem &quot;evil&quot; or the wrong thing to do.  Think of all the <br/>
people that run around calling unschoolers crazy and reporting it to social <br/>
services.  I&#39;m sure they are convinced it is evil and wrong and harmful, and <br/>
have all kinds of reasons why.  Some of those reasons may even sound so darn <br/>
logical that they can convince others to feel the same, whether those others <br/>
have ever really explored the subject on their own or not.  Hardly fair.  <br/>
Among the other &quot;crazy&quot; things I do to put my children in harm&#39;s way, I also <br/>
don&#39;t vaccinate, I breastfeed, used cloth diapers up until a short while ago, <br/>
share a family bed, intend to homeschool/unschool, and both children were <br/>
born at home -- my second one with just my husband and me.  On every one of <br/>
those subjects I&#39;ve heard all kinds of reasons why I&#39;m insane, stupid, <br/>
putting my kids in danger or I&#39;m going to raise spoiled brats with no social <br/>
skills, etc.  (sigh)<br/>

<br/>
If one of them used to work at Growing Without Schooling and thought it was <br/>
crazy and harmful, I would give that more credence than if someone without <br/>
really a clue thought so.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Some of those reasons may even sound so darn <br/>
logical that they can convince others to feel the same, whether those others <br/>
have ever really explored the subject on their own or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because this friend is so well known to me and so bright, and was so <br/>
convinced herself at one time that it was a good idea that she basically <br/>
dedicated her entire lifeforce to it for years, I wouldn&#39;t explore the <br/>
subject blindly on my own any more than I would touch an iron she had just <br/>
told me was hot.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;With so many opinions, sometimes you just have to think for yourselves and <br/>
not take anyone&#39;s word for it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes.  There&#39;s a difference between just taking a stranger&#39;s word for <br/>
something and having high regard for the opinion of someone who has earned <br/>
your trust.<br/>
