<br/>
  Mosaics from ancient Rome show women entertainers in bikini underwear -<br/>
  strophium and pagne.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Reliefs from the 2nd century AD show Roman soldiers clearly in some type<br/>
  of pant - like pedal pushers - right beside their skirted counterparts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Long pants were worn by women and men in the Byzantine time under the<br/>
  long and short tunics, an influence from Persian pantaloons and Iranian<br/>
  costumes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Pants are shown in a fresco from 3rd century BC and the text of my book<br/>
  (20000 years of Fashion - Francios Boucher) says they came from the<br/>
  mountain dwellers of the Steppes of Central Asia. The book calls the<br/>
  trousers &quot;an innovation of capital importance&quot; and &quot;indissolubly linked<br/>
  with the use of the horse in the Steppes&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
  It is also suggested that trousers were the garb of the affluent - which<br/>
  makes sense from the complexity of the construction in comparison to a<br/>
  tunic type of garment.<br/>
