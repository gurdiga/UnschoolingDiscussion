<br/>
<br/>
My name is Elizabeth. We&#39;ve been home schooling our children for 5 years. This<br/>
year we enrolled them in Einstein Academy, and it was a disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Before considering The Grace Academy, you should know that Mimi and Howie are<br/>
Einstein&#39;s founders. Their company, Tutorbots, mismanaged the school <br/>
until about<br/>
three weeks ago. In her dealings with Einstein families, Mimi used the name<br/>
Mimi Rothschild.<br/>
<br/>
IEP&#39;s were not done for the 300 special ed children who were enrolled in the<br/>
school. It is now the end of April and only nine IEP&#39;s have been written.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have never seen a more substantive fundamental violation of <br/>
special education<br/>
by a local education agency,&quot; charged Jane Sullivan, special education adviser<br/>
for the education department, who testified against Einstein Academy. Courier<br/>
Times 3/20/02<br/>
<br/>
The curriculum was not what Einstein promised. One class didn&#39;t have a teacher<br/>
until early Dec - then he left the school in February, and the class <br/>
is teacherless<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Einstein has been sued by many PA school districts and the PA Department of<br/>
Education. It is only open now through a court-brokered agreement <br/>
which required:<br/>
eliminating Tutorbots as manager and financial manager of the school, forensic<br/>
accounting of payments to Tutorbots, approval of all payments by a comptroller<br/>
who reports to the chartering school district and strict oversight by <br/>
the chartering<br/>
school district.<br/>
<br/>
Here are excerpts from articles about Tutorbots and its mismanagement <br/>
of Einstein:<br/>
<br/>
************<br/>
<br/>
I am convinced that Einstein will not be successful as long as Tutorbots is<br/>
the management company,&quot; Ken Junkins, the Morrisville board president, said<br/>
yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I believe Tutorbots is not properly managing Einstein. I believe <br/>
there is possible<br/>
mismanagement of funds, and they are not responding appropriately to the needs<br/>
of students,&quot; he said.<br/>
Courier Times 2/28/02<br/>
<br/>
**************<br/>
We believe they (Tutorbots) totally mishandled the management of the school.&quot;<br/>
Said Morrisville Superintendent John M. Gould.<br/>
<br/>
The school board, Gould said, is particularly concerned about <br/>
Tutorbots&#39; general<br/>
operation of the school, a lack of fiscal oversight and problems <br/>
providing services<br/>
to special education students.<br/>
<br/>
Another source of Morrisville&#39;s ire: Einstein&#39;s teachers haven&#39;t been <br/>
paid since<br/>
early February. &quot;We are quite angry at Tutorbots because they have used $2.3<br/>
million to pay themselves but have not paid the teachers, &quot; Gould said. &quot;That&#39;s<br/>
unconscionable.&quot;<br/>
Morning Call 3/2/02<br/>
<br/>
***************<br/>
Court documents showed that about $3 million was paid to Tutorbots during the<br/>
school year, while teachers have gone unpaid and the school&#39;s internet service<br/>
provider, Digital Freedom, canceled its service for nonpayment.<br/>
<br/>
Other complaints include copyright infringement, a lack of curriculum <br/>
and teachers<br/>
and a lack of special education services.<br/>
<br/>
During today&#39;s arguments, attorney Scher insisted that the state has <br/>
a responsibility<br/>
to pay its bill owed the cyber school, some 15 million in all. The judge asked<br/>
Scher how the state would know that the money is not going to a bank in the<br/>
Cayman Islands.<br/>
<br/>
But from day one they (the state) funded you and you did virtually nothing,&quot;<br/>
Judge Pellegrini said. &quot;You are supposed to be up and running on day one, not<br/>
day 90 of a 180-day school year. In effect, you put Tutorbots over the interest<br/>
of the children you were supposed to educate.&quot;<br/>
Lancaster New Era 3/22/02<br/>
<br/>
****************<br/>
Gould believes Mandel and Rothschild are controlling much of the <br/>
school&#39;s spending.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Howie Mandel.had the responsibility for.approving all invoices,&quot; Gould claimed<br/>
in a letter to Einstein, including invoices from his own company, Tutorbots,<br/>
and Gould said some of those invoices are &quot;grossly inflated&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All this while other vendors, and even the school&#39;s teachers went unpaid.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Einstein paid Tutorbots $2.4 million before paying teachers,&quot; Gould said.<br/>
<br/>
WGAL 3/26/02<br/>
<br/>
*****************<br/>
.our information is that Einstein has received $3.3 million from the <br/>
Commonwealth<br/>
of PA to fund its educational program. Our Business Administrator <br/>
cannot conceive<br/>
of any way that the funding to date would not be sufficient to allow Einstein<br/>
to be current on its bills and meet payroll.<br/>
<br/>
Morrisville attorney<br/>
<br/>
*****************<br/>
Tutorbots Inc. is prohibited from providing any management or <br/>
financial management<br/>
services to Einstein. In addition, a forensic accounting firm will review all<br/>
paid and outstanding invoices previously submitted by Tutorbots to Einstein<br/>
to determine if they were properly paid and that the funds were used <br/>
for purposes<br/>
permitted under the Public School Code:<br/>
PDE press release 3/28/02<br/>
<br/>
*****************<br/>
In June a forensic accounting firm will do an audit to determine whether the<br/>
payments Einstein made to Tutorbots were warranted. A total of $2.2 million<br/>
of $3.8 million in state funding that Einstein received went to Tutorbots, and<br/>
the state Education Department wants to know why, said Beth Gaydos, a <br/>
spokeswoman<br/>
for the Education Department.<br/>
Courier Times 4/4/02<br/>
<br/>
****************<br/>
The computer problems coincide with a new legal battle between Einstein and<br/>
Tutorbots, which is demanding the repayment of a loan of about $345,000.<br/>
<br/>
Tutorbots officials, Howard Mandell and his wife, Mimi Rothschild, also the<br/>
founder of Einstein, have been withholding student records as well as control<br/>
of the school&#39;s web site, until the money is repaid.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, a judge in Philadelphia ordered the return of the records as well<br/>
as the web site, but as of Tuesday that had not happened.<br/>
Intelligencer Journal 4/10/02<br/>
<br/>
*****************<br/>
<br/>
Tutorbot&#39;s mismanagement turned what could have been a great cyber school into<br/>
a disaster which damaged children enrolled.<br/>
<br/>
You should exercise great caution before considering The Grace Academy!<br/>
<br/>
Buyer Beware!<br/>
