<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, so far today we are all on the computers.  Dallen (9) is playing <br/>
Atlantis Underwater Tycoon, Phillip (6) is playing Warcraft III The Frozen Throne, <br/>
and as you can see I am answering E mail, also making some herbal tea for our <br/>
throats, we picked up a cold at the conference as well, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
But yesterday this is how it went.  Same AM as that is our usual routine when <br/>
we wake up.  Then I think Dallen had a turkey roll for breakfast while <br/>
Phillip had some pita chip things and kool aid.  I had more tea and some chocolate <br/>
covered peanuts, yummmm.  Played with the dogs.  Fed all the animals.  Watched <br/>
a little TV then dressed and off to play group.  Had a little discussion with <br/>
Phillip so that he knows that by not brushing his hair it is starting to dred <br/>
in the back.  He didn&#39;t care so off we went.  Play group until everyone went <br/>
home (the boys always want to be the last ones there).  Came home and I checked <br/>
E mail while Phil played on the computer and Dallen was drawing some pictures <br/>
of robots.  Flea sprayed the dogs, they picked up fleas while we were away. <br/>
Helped Phil climb a tree and listened to Dallen talk about his robot.  <br/>
<br/>
Went out for supper with my best friend and the boys stayed home and played <br/>
games with Jackson.  I went to Toys R Us while out and picked up some YuGiOh <br/>
cards, the Tow Towers DVD and Stitch video.  We watched Stitch and a little TV, <br/>
I watched as they finished up a game they were playing and we went to bed <br/>
around midnight.<br/>

Oh yea, I had a question for you guys that know anything about dogs.  This is <br/>
the second time that my dogs have gone to be boarded while we are on vacation <br/>
that they have come back just loaded with fleas.  When I picked up the dogs <br/>
the owner of the kennel said she gave my dogs a bath free of charge and they <br/>
were clean but that just made the fleas easier to see.  I had used the drops for <br/>
fleas before we left but it didn&#39;t seem to help.  Is this normal for a <br/>
kennel?  Or should I be looking for a new kennel?  I know they are there with lots <br/>
of other dogs but I am just not sure if I should expect this.  It is really a <br/>
pain to deal with.<br/>

<br/>
Today is Jaiden&#39;s b-day(5 today!) and this is what we are up to <br/>
<br/>
today.I got up with Jason at 5:30, he&#39;s working again(started <br/>
<br/>
this week) after almosr 2 years home with us. Avery got up shortly<br/>
<br/>
after 6, and the birthday boy slept in until 9. I had pizza ready <br/>
<br/>
for Jaiden when he got up, that was what he decided he wanted for <br/>
<br/>
breakfast last night. After the pizza we made cupcakes, strawberry <br/>
<br/>
with chocolate and vanilla frosting. Right now, Jaiden is in his room <br/>
<br/>
watching Scooby Doo, with the Adams Family, his recent favorite family,<br/>
<br/>
and every few moments yelling out to me in the livingroom(on the &#39;puter)<br/>
<br/>
whats happening. Avery is in the livingroom with me watching Dora. The<br/>
<br/>
boys are also playing with legos, blocks, and cars right now too.<br/>
<br/>
We will just be hanging out, doing whatever we want to until Jason<br/>
<br/>
gets home, them we have to run some errands. We have a mission, <br/>
<br/>
Jaiden want&#39;s skulls, spiders, and rats as part of the decorations<br/>
<br/>
for the huge pirate party he&#39;s having. He started planning this party<br/>
<br/>
around x-mas of last year. He&#39;s done every thing for this party, guest list<br/>
<br/>
food, decorations. All we&#39;ve done is take him to the stores he&#39;s wanted<br/>
<br/>
to go to and bought what he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, aftet our running around we are having fried chix, mashed potatoes, <br/>
<br/>
brocoli, and buscuits for dinner. Jaiden picked it all out last night at <br/>
<br/>
the store We are going to the zoo tonight, they have a huge zoo at dark thing, <br/>
<br/>
and it shouldn&#39;t be to crowded tonight. We have plans to watch the &quot;Two Towers&#39;<br/>
<br/>
tonight, but we may not. <br/>
<br/>
So, thats today.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

operators are either mixing your dogs with other dogs, not washing bedding <br/>
between dogs, not cleaning the kennels, or the grounds at the kennel have them <br/>
in the grass.<br/>
It is odd that the drops didn&#39;t work, tho if the dogs received a bath that <br/>
would explain it.<br/>
We don&#39;t have flea problems this far north, but have encountered them the odd <br/>
time. maybe I have missed something?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864602019">Pam...I think somewhere on the grounds of the kennel there are <br/>
pockets of fleas or other dogs with fleas. Fleas like to live on <br/>
animals and not in bedding or dirt. They&#39;ll hop up on a dog or cat <br/>
quickly as soon as they hatch. It&#39;s possible they are cycling through <br/>
a flea hatch everytime you go. Unfortunately others who board their <br/>
animals are in denial about their dogs having fleas...so everyday a <br/>
new crop can waltz in the door. As much as I hate fleas, I hate the <br/>
insecticides that some places use. Fleas can become resistant to the <br/>
best and safest poisen too. So I have no answer really but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
surprise me. Maybe someone has run a kennel and will share with us. <br/>
