 </span></blockquote> We kept our Saxon books for the same reason,  but I think it&#39;s more <br/>
 of a reference for me if ds ever asks me how to do something and I <br/>
 can&#39;t remember.   The only thing he ever enjoyed in them was the <br/>
 mental math in 65.  I think Saxon is kind of a love-hate thing.  Kids <br/>
 either seem to really take to it or they hate it.  Mine was <br/>
 definitely the latter.<br/>
