<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055767303">I wanted to mention that people can get on a &quot;sex offenders&quot; list for<br/>
indecent exposure for urinating in public. Or for statuatory rape. Finding<br/>
out what the conviction entailed *might* ease your mind some.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see those disclosure laws as being particularly helpful because,<br/>
let&#39;s face it, not everyone will comply by registering -- and there are ones<br/>
who haven&#39;t been caught yet.<br/>
