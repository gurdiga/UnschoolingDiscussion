<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010751206">Hi,<br/>
    I&#39;m helping home educators in Scotland (I&#39;m in England) to drum up some <br/>

threat. Below is their letter. Please respond if you can. HE  stands for <br/>

PLEASE READ: IMPORTANT NEW INFORMATION ABOUT HE IN SCOTLAND<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Home educators in Scotland are still in an ongoing battle with the Scottish <br/>
Executive (SE) about new proposals for guidance for local authorities in <br/>
relation to HE. The original purpose of the guidance was to protect families <br/>
who wished to home educate, and facilitate the process of de-registering <br/>
children from state schools. (The situation in Scotland is different from <br/>
that in England and Wales, in that we do not have deregistration on <br/>
request.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, last Xmas Eve (2001) home educators in Scotland were horrified by <br/>
the release of the consultation draft, which many feel failed abysmally in <br/>
achieving its stated aim to �promote effective partnership between education <br/>
authorities and home educating families� and instead succeeded in making <br/>
matters far worse. Despite repeated demands for its withdrawal, the <br/>
consultation process continued. Not only did it fail to meet the original <br/>
mandate of the Scottish Parliament which made it clear that the guidance was <br/>
to protect HE families, but many believed that it actively promoted <br/>
discrimination against a minority group, encouraged tracking of children by <br/>
using census, health and other records, misquoted several sections of the <br/>
relevant pieces of legislation, ignored all relevant case law and <br/>
misrepresented a European judgement. It was widely condemned as <br/>
&quot;anti-children&quot; by the HE community, children&#39;s rights groups, and a number <br/>
of MSPs (Members of the Scottish Parliament).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since the consultation process ended in March, there has been no systematic <br/>
feedback to the HE community, and no significant response or feedback from <br/>
the consultation process.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly one year later, on 30 December 2002, the SE sent a worrying <br/>
communication to several HE groups, inviting them to a meeting in mid <br/>
January, with the following agenda:<br/>
<br/>
* to provide Scottish Executive (SE)with an opportunity to share feedback <br/>
from the the consultation exercise<br/>
<br/>
* to discuss SE&#39;s current thinking on the guidance, and to indicate the <br/>
areas in which their thinking has changed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, they also want to consider the following questions:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. What, if any minimum educational standards should apply to home <br/>
educators?<br/>
<br/>
2. How can we ensure that the rights of the child are respected in relation <br/>
to their educational provision?<br/>
<br/>
3. What qualities should characterise the relationship between local <br/>
authorities and home educators and how can such relationships be built?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They have also asked attendees to come prepared to share with them evidence <br/>
of what they would consider to be &quot;best practice&quot; on the part of both of <br/>
home educators and local authorities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many HEors are very worried by this situation, and Schoolhouse, the Scottish <br/>
home education association has started gathering feedback on these questions <br/>
from the HE community, to ensure that the views of the wide HE community can <br/>
be represented at that meeting. They have also pointed out to SE that this <br/>
is still attempting to subvert the original purpose of the guidance; that by <br/>
NOT including children&#39;s rights groups in this meeting, THEY are showing a <br/>
disregard for children&#39;s rights; they do not have appropriate representation <br/>
from across the HE community in Scotland; and that there is a lack of <br/>
clarity about the first question -  is the implication that Home Educating <br/>
parents may have to prove a certain educational standard?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If this issue goes unchallenged in Scotland, then it may eventually have <br/>
implications for the wider HE community. We are asking you to PLEASE offer <br/>
feedback on these issues before 12 January 2003. Your comments can be sent <br/>
directly to Schoolhouse at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:info@...">info@...</a>  Your views will be <br/>
collated, but individuals will not be identified, and the names of <br/>
respondents will remain confidential, and not be released to SE or anyone <br/>
else. Please make your voice heard on this important issue. Many thanks in <br/>
advance.<br/>

Do you mind if I forward this to my Scottish friend? Who happens to be a<br/>
documentary producer for public television, she may find it interesting:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915976292">**3. What qualities should characterise the relationship between local <br/>

**<br/>
<br/>
This worries me.  A generic &quot;best practice&quot; isn&#39;t best for every child<br/>
or every family.<br/>
<br/>
Try to stay away from &quot;practices&quot;.  I think you want regulations based<br/>
on &quot;principles&quot; and I mean principles of freedom and self-determination.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  But... if you have to talk about &quot;best practices&quot; for home learning,<br/>
please keep them very general and fundamental. (In case they try to make<br/>
everyone follow the &quot;best way&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
I would say that one key practice is individualizing the content and<br/>
difficulty level of &quot;lessons&quot; or learning experiences to suit each<br/>
child&#39;s needs and interests.  I would also say that a &quot;best practice&quot; of<br/>
home education is spending lots of time with our (younger) children so<br/>
that we really know, better than a teacher could, what they need and<br/>
want.  I picked these because I think individualizing and being together<br/>
are fundamentals of home education.  (But I don&#39;t have any older<br/>
children, so the being together stuff may not apply there.)</div>
