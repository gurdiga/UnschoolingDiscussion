<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702615345">&lt;&lt;for me the big problem lies with the marketing/consumerism, though this is<br/>
hardly exclusive to pokemon.   we all must choose the values we want to<br/>
model for our children, as well as allow our children to understand  we<br/>
live in a very diverse world.   not all things are to our families liking,<br/>
but it is good to respect the right of others in the context of modeling<br/>
our own values.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  My three boys (9,11, 12) are heavily into Pokemon here.  We discuss the<br/>
marketing/consumerism aspect of Pokemon frequently.  I&#39;ve told them they spend<br/>
their own money on it, I will no longer help pad someone&#39;s already overinflated<br/>
bank account.<br/>
<br/>
One good thing that&#39;s come out of our Pokemon craze . . . I no longer have to worry<br/>
about their ability to &quot;learn&quot;.  They know everything there is to know about<br/>
Pokemon.  And in the future, they&#39;ll learn how much of their &quot;hard earned&quot; money<br/>
they spent on it.  A good life lesson.<br/>
<br/>
I have friends in our local Catholic hs group that would never allow their children<br/>
to become involved w/Pokemon.  (One mom won&#39;t even allow her children to watch<br/>
Arthur because they are unkind to one another.)  I respect their decision for their<br/>
family.  I only ask that they respect my choices for what works for us.  I<br/>
personally think Pokemon will not harm their souls--and that&#39;s what we judge our<br/>
decisions on in our family.  (Oh, we watch Arther, too.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll also let my 12 yr old read the original post and all the replies.  It&#39;ll be a<br/>
good springboard for discussion . . .  economics, religion, tolerance, marketing,<br/>
etc.<br/>
