We had a lovely, but very short, visit with Robyn and Jayn. Jayn&#39;s grown up <br/>
so much since August!<br/>
<br/>
And the girl can RHYME! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry many of you all don&#39;t live closer to me! :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232152649">It was a great visit - your house is so charming, and your vege garden is<br/>
just like what I dream about. That really was the first time that Jayn has<br/>
gone into such a long rap - up until then she has done about 4 lines at a<br/>
time. You were fortunate in that you got rhymes instead of everything<br/>
suddenly ending in &quot;poo-poo!&quot; - EG &quot;The frog sat in the poopoo! inky dinky<br/>
stinky poo-poo! (giggle, giggle) Eeeyuh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be glad to talk to Cameron (hope I got the name right) anytime.<br/>
