<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140137774">Thanks for the patience, but I guess in a round about way this is related to <br/>
unschooling (helping my son learn the ins and out&#39;s of Ebay).  We have been <br/>
getting back into selling on stuff.  We sold a nice suede jacket yesterday, and <br/>
when I got ready to mail it off today, I noticed 2 small ball point pen <br/>
marks!!  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a quick way to get ink out of suede?  I&#39;m pretty desperate <br/>
here!!  Thanks  so much!!  xoxoxo<br/>

At the grocery store, up above laundry detergent, there should be little <br/>
bottles of various stain removers.  There&#39;s probably one just for ballpoint ink.  <br/>
BUT you could look at google.com for the combo of suede and ballpoint.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613668530">Try using a succession of q-tips dipped in rubbing alcohol, then when dry,<br/>
brush an old toothbrush in tiny circles to restore the nap. Also a product<br/>
called �Gonzo� formerly from restoration hardware takes out ink from all<br/>
kinds of surfaces.<br/>

Hairspray works to remove ink on regular fabric, although I have never tried<br/>
it on suede.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833861562">Thanks for the ideas on getting ink out of suede.  I was able to do the <br/>
&quot;alcohol on q-tip&quot; method and it worked very well.  Didn&#39;t come completely out, but <br/>
you can&#39;t see it unless you really look for a while.  In the narrative I did <br/>
say, &quot;Coat needs a good cleaning.&quot;  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the ideas...I will also try the hairspray thing on <br/>
something..I never knew it removed stains!<br/>
