<div id="ygrps-yiv-931487724">Hi,<br/>
I want to thank you for your post. I discovered this group about 2 <br/>
weeks ago and have been going back and forth about leaving it for <br/>
about a week and a half. It&#39;s not so much the bickering that makes me <br/>
want to leave. One problem is that I don&#39;t have the time to sift <br/>
through the bickering posts to get to the &quot;meat&quot; of the information <br/>
on unschooling. The other reason is that I am trying very hard not to <br/>
be turned off to unschooling overall. This is my first exposure to <br/>
unschoolers and so far I haven&#39;t liked what I&#39;ve seen. I am intrigued-<br/>
no, enthralled-at the whole USing concept and am coming to understand <br/>
that it appears to be the right direction to go with my children. <br/>
However I am left wondering if the preponderence of USers are like <br/>
those on this list. I would like to meet other USers IRL but if this <br/>
is what they  will be like then maybe I should stick with &quot;standard&quot; <br/>
homeschooling. I like a good debate as much as anyone else but not at <br/>
the expense of exposure to all the negative energy. I am not a <br/>
Pollyanna who thinks the world is all rosy. To the contrary. I am <br/>
very much a realist and know that difference of opinion can lead to <br/>
bickering. I just really don&#39;t need to be constantly exposed to it <br/>
and would never stick around in a real life USing support group if <br/>
this was all I ever heard when we got together. So, in a roundabout <br/>
way, what I am trying to tell you is that your post really spoke to <br/>
me. It helped me to remember why I am in this group in the first <br/>
place. It helped to remember that I CAN pull out the good information <br/>
and disregard the rest. I&#39;ll try to stick it out a little longer and <br/>
I credit you with helping me make that decision. Thanks a bunch!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easier to find the &quot;meat&quot; at the message boards.<br/>
Lots of different topics.  Reading the archives can help in answering <br/>
questions without having to post questions because many have already <br/>
been asked and answered.<br/>
Though *I* found that posting and getting involved in discussions was <br/>
a big help for me in my progress of letting go.<br/>

here on this list.  Several have given up and left this list.<br/>

I have been lucky enough to meet & know a WONDERFUL group of women in my area, whom are all unschoolers. I love these women, and some of them are my best friends.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers that I meet IRL never come across the way they do on the net. It&#39;s a *hard* place to meet because there are no body expressions. I&#39;m trying to learn to read the posts as if they were from a best friend. When you read them that way, it doesn&#39;t seem hostile..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know hundreds of unschoolers - that I&#39;ve met in real life (having been a <br/>
conference junkie for a while). They are generally filled with tremendous <br/>
POSITIVE energy. Email is difficult - people come across different AND people <br/>
can&#39;t seem to let things just slide by, always want to comment on HOW other <br/>
people come across. In real life people just stop listening to someone if <br/>
they don&#39;t like the way they express themselves - but on email lists they <br/>
feel compelled to comment on it and that leads to long contentious negative <br/>
threads which are about the people on the list instead of about the subject <br/>
matter. <br/>
<br/>
But - the unschooling conferences are so WONDERFUL.... the warm energy <br/>
between the kids and their parents supports it and the joy of having several <br/>
hundred or a thousand or more unschoolish people all in one place at the same <br/>
time is so relaxing and energizing at the same time. Lots and lots and lots <br/>
of smiling and laughing and good humor!!! The speakers can challenge our <br/>
thinking and offer information and ideas - it is different than an email list <br/>
where they are sort of restricted to writing in fairly short email-length <br/>
spurts. It is really a joy!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And the unschoolers I&#39;ve met IRL that I&#39;ve known from the net are much<br/>
friendlier and warmer than they sometimes come across in email. Without the<br/>
subtleties of body language and voice inflection and eye contact, so much is<br/>
lost when all you have are the words. So it&#39;s helpful, as Camille said, to<br/>
read as though your best friend were talking.<br/>
