<div id="ygrps-yiv-793874474">At the bottom of the e-mail it says &quot;messages&quot; (if you&#39;re on full- <br/>
featured e-mail).  Click there, and they&#39;ll give you a search box  <br/>
(upper right?)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re reading at the site, you&#39;re already there.<br/>
<br/>
If you have simple e-mail, go to the yahoogroups site and search there.<br/>
<br/>
The search feature used to be slow and awful, but they did fix it up  <br/>
very nicely!<br/>
<br/>
This is all I have on my site, I think:<br/>
