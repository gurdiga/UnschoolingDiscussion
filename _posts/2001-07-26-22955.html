I had very little mail yesterday, it&#39;s all here today <br/>
though :-)  It might be yahoo ironing out the AOL <br/>
thingy or it might be ageneral slowdown cos of that <br/>
virus that&#39;s about atm, I had a few copies sent and it <br/>
was 260k so it took ages for them to download :-(  If <br/>
it&#39;s gone out to loads of folk and about 20 copies each <br/>
then I can see how that would gum up the works.  <br/>
Anyway, it seems back to &#39;normal&#39; now :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504800761">Help anyone out there with technical knowledge of email. I had a problem with bouncing mail through yahoo groups. I have since straightened it out. When I did, i started receiving email from groups again. now for two days I have received no mail from any of my Yahoo groups. When I go to the website, I am listed as a member and can access the archives. i can even post a message from here an the group will receive it. I just am not getting any postings to my email address. I emailed yohoo help but have not heard back yet. Any suggestions? If you reply please send to my personal account, because I am not getting the group mail the address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:saninocencio1@...">saninocencio1@...</a><br/>
Thanks so much<br/>
