<div id="ygrps-yiv-215693095">Was anyone else disappointed in the article titled, &quot;Dyslexia - A Gift?&quot; in the May/June 2005 issue of Life Learning?<br/>
<br/>
It reads more like a book promotion for &quot;The Gift of Dyslexia&quot;, than an essay by a proponent of life learning.  References are made to techniques discovered by author Ron Davis, yet not a single explanation of these techniques was listed for those who might like to try them on their own.  The article ends by mentioning a benefit of going through Ron Davis&#39; training.<br/>
<br/>
The article states that dyslexics may have trouble with math because it &quot;is composed of order (versus disorder), sequence, and time&quot;.  Children who &quot;do not possess these concepts&quot; must memorize rather than understand math.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dyslexic people ... excel at hands-on learning.  Because we think in pictures, it is sometimes hard for us to understand letters, numbers, symbols, and written words.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t everyone do better with hands-on learning?  Aren&#39;t symbols pictures?<br/>

The Gift of Dyslexia works for a small subgroup of dyslexics who really <br/>
think in pictures and can manipulate those items in their mind. My son <br/>
could never get the images in his head so it did not work for him. They <br/>
also have a theory that some dyslexics have a problem with he written <br/>
word because some words have no pictures to associate with them. So <br/>
horse or run or dog are fine because the dyslexix can see a picture in <br/>
their mind to hang that word on, but a word like but, or, some, the can <br/>
cause confusion and send the reader into a downward spiral that effects <br/>
the reading of even words they know. One of the Davis things is to build <br/>
with clay images (symbols) that would go with the, but, or, some and <br/>
then the reader has those pictures/symbols in their mind the next time <br/>
they encounter those words.<br/>
Like I said this works for a small group of folks who are considered <br/>
dyslexic and i have met online folks who say that the Davis Method is <br/>
the best thing that ever happened to their kids, normally teens.<br/>

Are any of those kids unschooled?  Always unschooled?  *Really* unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
Based on testimonials, it sounds like Davis has found something that helps some people read, or read more easily.  But all the stories I&#39;ve heard are either schooled kids who have suffered due to their inabitity to read when others around them thought they should be reading, or home&quot;schooled&quot; kids.  I&#39;ve not heard of any always unschooled child reach  - oh, let&#39;s say age 16 or so - not able to read, go through learning Davis&#39;s methods, and suddenly be able to read.<br/>
<br/>

Did any of the Davis methods work for him?  Did he go to one of the training centers or try stuff from the book?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably not since its such a small group of folks who have ever heard <br/>
of Davis anyway. The chances of a homeschooler, let alone an always <br/>
unschooled child going there seems small. Not that there might not be an <br/>
unschooler teen who is not reading who chooses to try their methods to <br/>
help them break through whatever block there might be to reading---if <br/>
there even is such a block.<br/>

Josh did mess around building some words he felt like making, but then <br/>
decided he had better things to do, so moved on. We tried the whole <br/>
&quot;mind&#39;s eye&quot; thing but he could not see it.<br/>
