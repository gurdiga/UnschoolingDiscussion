<div><font face="Arial" size="2">well, we caught a gardener snake..black with green 
or orange stripes..can&#39;t remember which right now, but he refused to eat as 
well.&nbsp; We tried a variety of bugs, and he did not want them. I thought if I 
waited a while , eventually he would eat.&nbsp; I thought ,maybe, he had just 
eaten when I caught him, and didn&#39;t need to eat right away, but he continued not 
to eat.&nbsp; I think it was the captivity.&nbsp; So, I let him go.&nbsp; I 
would get a snake froma pet store for a pet.&nbsp; Or do a catch &amp; release 
kindof thing.&nbsp; But he was neat to have while he was here, and their are 
many more ..the cat keeps playing with them in the tall grass out back.&nbsp;
