<div id="ygrps-yiv-622951454">&lt;&lt;Are you now an admirer of Che and Fidel?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I find significant things to admire about both men.  Che voluntarily gave up<br/>
a life of ease (being a medical doctor in Argentina) to fight against what<br/>
he saw as sub-human treatment of people in Latin America (children dying of<br/>
malnutrition related illnesses while picking fruit for United Fruit Company,<br/>
etc.)  I surely admire that.<br/>
<br/>
Fidel saw feeding all people and teaching them all to read as more important<br/>
than freedom of speech.  I admire his goals if not always his methods.<br/>
<br/>
Were both men flawed?  Yes.<br/>

You don&#39;t know me from Adam, and I fear I&#39;m being presumptuous, but <br/>
nevertheless I have to argue with you. I see nothing to admire in either man. <br/>
I see the will to power in two national socialists who could never have <br/>
obtained the power they so craved had they not knelt to the tragic need found <br/>
all round them. Castro is, in the words of historian John Lukacs, only &quot;the <br/>
latest of the Many Tyrants in the inchoate history of that tropical island.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are indeed aspects about Che that are attractive and capable of <br/>
tempting one to be sympathetic, but when the goal is a Marxist paradise, this <br/>
foolishness cancels out anything worth admiring -- free medical and dental <br/>
notwithstanding. And last I checked, homeschooling, let alone unschooling, is <br/>
illegal in Cuba.<br/>
<br/>
But your original post was about learning on your own rather than taking the <br/>
party line, and that is admirable (even though you will now have to detox <br/>
from the National Geographic slant!), and I hope I haven&#39;t offended you with <br/>
my angle, ignorant SOB that I am.<br/>

Nothing, except articles which fairly sing the praises of Fidel and Che, I <br/>
suppose. I subscribe and I don&#39;t remember the article that Julie was talking <br/>
about, but I&#39;ll look for it. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if strewn throughout their offices are those <br/>
coffee cups with Che&#39;s mug (nice pun, eh?).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m a hard-a** when it comes to this sort of thing. I find myself <br/>
more attracted to a writer like Robert Kaplan at the Atlantic, who like the <br/>
writers for NG, has been through all of the hotspots round the world, but who <br/>
doesn&#39;t get all jello-y when paeans to Marx get read by aspiring tyrants.<br/>
