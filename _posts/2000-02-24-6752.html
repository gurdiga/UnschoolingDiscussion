<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939558406">I&#39;ve never had them myself, but my pain-in-the-*** mother has had them<br/>
most of my life. She always blamed me for them , but when she managed to<br/>
clean up her diet , eliminating caffeine, sugar , aspartame, MSG, all<br/>
food dyes and chemicals, she had them less often and they were less<br/>
intense.  Depression sometimes shows itself as migraines. And I know<br/>
from my experience that eliminating all chemicals helps with depression.<br/>
Hope this helps.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125189327">My 10 yos got a terrible headache was shortly after eating hotdogs. It made<br/>
him cry it hurt so bad. We gave him Motrin and made him lay in a dark room.<br/>
The headache stayed with him for over 24 hours! Then we went on vacation to<br/>
TN, and he ate bologna sandwiches. Again the headache. We have taken him off<br/>
of any MSG containing food. I think that his body has consumed so much MSG<br/>
that it is overloaded. Kind of poisoned. It is hard to stop doing what you<br/>
are accustomed, but once you know the cause, you learn to avoid it at all<br/>
costs! My ds lived for bologna and hotdogs. Now, I have to watch what I buy,<br/>
so that he does not get something by accident.  Good luck finding what is<br/>
the cause. I know that it is a world of difference once you are headache<br/>
free!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517118845">Although I had had headaches at different times in my life, I didn&#39;t<br/>
have a real migraine until I developed intolerance -- or allergies to --<br/>
a few things I was eating.  These migraines are excruciating, and much<br/>
different than headaches. I usually lose normal vision, can&#39;t think and<br/>
become increasingly unable to function.   I found that eliminating the<br/>
foods I was allergic to (dairy products, eggs, beef, peas, and others)<br/>
certainly helped.  But I have also found that my body will develop new<br/>
intolerances if I overdo it -- particularly with anything having to do<br/>
with animals, and food additives.  In my experience, the migraine comes<br/>
not only as an allergic reaction, but  from unalleviated physical,<br/>
emotional, and/or mental stress.  I find that I can completely avoid<br/>
migraines by avoiding all my allergy foods, food additives and<br/>
chemicals, caffeine and wine; by regularly exercising and doing any deep<br/>
breathing work (such as meditation or singing or t&#39;ai chi) and dealing<br/>
with stress in an effective way.  HA!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I am not actually able to do this (yet?), and get the odd<br/>
migraine.  I have found that acupuncture and/or self-accupressure work<br/>
well, combined with secluding myself in a dark quiet room and breathing<br/>
really deeply, in alleviating the pain.   In emergencies, when I<br/>
absolutely have to function, I use coffee as a potent drug.  Since I<br/>
don&#39;t drink it otherwise, and don&#39;t take any other drug, strong coffee<br/>
takes away my migraine temporarily and enables me to at least see and<br/>
move  until I can clean up my act and get someplace where I can take<br/>
care of myself.   But I then have to deal with the accumulated side<br/>
effects of coffee, too, and it can be a slippery slope that just leads<br/>
to more imbalance, so I don&#39;t really recommend this.  It just works for<br/>
me in emergencies, as it thins the blood flow to the brain, to put it<br/>
extremely simply.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331859728">You know, I&#39;ve always had a hard time with balancing my life.  I try to<br/>
do everything, and not just half a** it either.  I go all out with<br/>
everything I do.  So, I overdo myself.  I need to prioritize.<br/>
Occasionally I make myself do this, but then it all creeps back.  You<br/>
know kind of like following a diet.  YOu do great for awhile, then<br/>
little bad habit start creeping in until you realize you&#39;ve done it<br/>
again.  :)<br/>
All these migraines are telling me I&#39;ve done it again, and I need to<br/>
simplify my life again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117257862">I always went to the chiropractor for headaches, but haven&#39;t found a good one since I moved to Orlando 5 years ago.  Anyway, a friend of mine recommended Excedrin Migraine - I cannot believe the difference!  Before, when I would get one, I&#39;d have to lay down and take a nap to get over the headache and nauseousness from the pain. Now, when I feel it coming on, I take a couple Excedrin - and it&#39;s gone!  Seriously - they are not paying me to say this!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m glad this works for you!<br/>
<br/>
Just so that no one is suckered - Excedrin Migraine is identical to Excedrin. <br/>
 The FDA did not approve Excedrin as being particularly effective for <br/>
migraines.  They approved the MARKETING of Excedrin aimed particularly at <br/>
migraine sufferers.  That&#39;s why the Excedrin people are allowed to sell the <br/>
exact same product in a different box.  The price of Excedrin went up around <br/>
the same time to pay for those new boxes too.  How irritating...<br/>

I started going to a masseuse a little bit ago and have not had a bad<br/>

also got rid of an aching back, which was from a fall, that I had for a<br/>

<br/>
You may also want to consider a myopractioner.  They can do miracles with<br/>
all sorts of aches and pains.  My midwife&#39;s husband is one and he was<br/>
able to do wonders for my back, even during the last month of pregnancy. <br/>
He saw my newborn at around 2 weeks and he hasn&#39;t been colickly since. <br/>
He is also able to help with children who have earaches.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062282218">Dar, I have suffered migraines over forty years and declared permanently<br/>
disabled because of their frequency, strength.  Not eating can definately<br/>
trigger them for me, as well as becoming dehydrated (happens a lot, without<br/>
me knowing it) or not enough rest.  Bright light, weird light (sometimes<br/>
even the computer screen) and some smells or odors.  Cigarette smoke is a<br/>
bad one.<br/>
