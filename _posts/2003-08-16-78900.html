Also I think at various ages there&#39;s a cyclical expansion and compression. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True, but I think expecting things by ages does our kids a disservice.  I <br/>
never had any &quot;terrible twos&quot; but I had what &quot;what the hell!?&quot; threes.    Some <br/>
people&#39;s cycles are so pronounced and frequent that they get branded with the <br/>
bad brand, bi-polar.  <br/>
<br/>
Well duh.  Anything with poles is going to be having two ends, and if we <br/>
label things in such way that there&#39;s a continuum from focus-to-broad or <br/>
hyper-to-still or manic-to-depressed, people HAVE to be somewhere between the two <br/>
points the words describe, and they&#39;re unlikely to STAY at that point.<br/>
<br/>
Some people&#39;s range is smaller so they get the GOOD words, like stable or <br/>
predictable or mature or  sensible.  (They might also get the bad words like flat <br/>
or boring.)  Other people&#39;s ranges are broader so they have sparkly flash <br/>
days and son-of-a-bitch days.  Some people have sparkly weeks or months or years, <br/>
and the downside for long periods too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all &quot;normal&quot; (meaning not mathematically  normal, but that it&#39;s within <br/>
the range of understandable and non-freakish human biochemical realities).<br/>
<br/>
So poking a teenager and saying &quot;You&#39;re fourteen.  The book says it&#39;s okay to <br/>
be depressed, but I&#39;m date-stamping this mood and if you&#39;re not better by <br/>
November 2, it&#39;s Prozac day&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to be acknowledging that person&#39;s <br/>
individuality!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to surf, but I did for many years ride a schoolbus standing <br/>
up and I learned to do it with finesse and style, rarely deigning to hold <br/>
those bars on the backs of the seats, but rather planting my feet apart, one ahead <br/>
and one behind, and feeling the accelleration of the bus, and knowing all the <br/>
stops, watching casually in peripheral vision for red lights and other cars&#39; <br/>
tail lights and signals so that when the bus slowed I was lightly planted and <br/>
seeming unaffected by the physics of the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
It was a lot of work, to seem to unaware.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can and should learn to ride their kids&#39; moods, and not be thrown to <br/>
the floor or slam someone in the head with a geography book just because the <br/>
bus stopped where you KNEW it was going to stop anyway!   Be cool!!<br/>
<br/>
I still sometimes stumble and sway from Holly&#39;s nearly-twelve-year-old female <br/>
moods, but I&#39;m learning to stay upright and still smile and talk when she <br/>
accellerates unexpectedly.<br/>
