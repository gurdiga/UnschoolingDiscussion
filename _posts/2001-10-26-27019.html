Well, this is probably not going to be a popular opinion, but I think enough<br/>
is enough!  WTC was a great tragedy but exactly how many BILLIONS are they<br/>
going to collect?  Helping is one thing but there are people out there that<br/>
think they should be supported for the rest of their lives!<br/>
<br/>
And, exactly who is the money going to?  All I hear is fire fighters and<br/>
WTC.  What about the folks in the Pentagon and on the flight that went down<br/>
before it could do any damage?  Now, the folks on that flight to me are REAL<br/>
heros!<br/>
<br/>
Or, as far as that goes, what about the folks from &#39;93 or Oklahoma City or<br/>
the USS Cole or the embassies.  Did their families get anything?<br/>
<br/>
I think the public has become obsessed with collecting money and I think the<br/>
media is having hayday with it.  Politics as usual!<br/>

I somewhat agree.... although almost 6,000 voices were quited that day, this<br/>
has never happened in our history and I pray never will again. Most of the<br/>
funds are for all the victims, even when it is labeled for a specific group.<br/>
<br/>
AND the reason it there are so many fundraisers is because it hit in the<br/>
backyard of the entertainment and news industries. It is very real to them<br/>
and the have the power to raise the big funds.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, enough said by me... hehehe<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059236338">&lt;&lt; I believe the death tolls on some days during WW2 were more than 6,000<br/>
but that&#39;s just a &quot;gut&quot; reaction, nothing I&#39;ve ever seen. Of course not<br/>
all of them were civilians either.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone here at my house last night (I forget who) said &quot;at least we never <br/>
bomb children.&quot;  Oh.  I think Hiroshima&#39;s bombing got a school, didn&#39;t it?  <br/>
Whether it was on purpose or not, it happened.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; didn&#39;t it?  <br/>

Allied losses at Iwo Jima, something like 30,000 in one campaign, we<br/>
wanted to send a message.<br/>
&quot; Look what we can do to you.  You&#39;d better take notice &quot;  sound<br/>
familiar?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-104038051">One of the problems with all the Red Cross/other disaster  Fundraising has <br/>
been that local organizations (and probably National, non-disaster-related <br/>
organizations) are suffering terribly. Corporations are withdrawing donations <br/>
from other organizations to send money to the sexier cause of Disaster <br/>
Relief. Individuals too. <br/>
