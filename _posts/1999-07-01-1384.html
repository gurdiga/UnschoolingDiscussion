<div id="ygrps-yiv-888022677">I&#39;m sending you a huge hug of thanks.....<br/>
I needed that!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Our three kids (6, 4 and 3) are always busy, busy busy, but never want to do<br/>
anything like learning to write or read ect...  They don&#39;t even care much about<br/>
drawing or coloring.  we live on a farm, and are very busy outside doing &quot;stuff&quot;.<br/>
Today we have hatched two peacocks, what a thrill.  We are waiting for the third<br/>
egg to start.<br/>
They know lots about chickens, chicks, ducks, horses, ponies, dogs, cats, and now<br/>
peacocks, but aren&#39;t&#39; very bookish.  Though they&#39;d let me read to them all day.<br/>
I guess its mostly my battle with comparisons and doubts.<br/>
Thanks for all your sharing.  I know unschooling is the way to go for us.  The<br/>
freedom and fun.  It really helps me though to hear about families like yours.<br/>
Big hugs to all your family for sharing life with us all!<br/>

&gt;I wish you were closer!  I&#39;d love to spend an afternoon listening to how your<br/>
&gt;days were and are.<br/>
&gt;How did you combat doubts?  Did you have doubts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really. I was pretty much unschooled myself, so I already knew it worked.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ll pace some of the questions though.<br/>
&gt;Did you worry about reading, or try to teach it?  Or writing ect??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. The only time we really tried to teach any of the kids anything was<br/>
when our two oldest sons were small. We enrolled our oldest son, John (now<br/>
25, married, with two little girls), in the Alaska State Correspondence<br/>
Course for first grade. The state sent us huge boxes of books, workbooks,<br/>
pencils, crayons, just scads schoolish stuff. We worked with a teacher<br/>
based at the local public school who reviewed John&#39;s workbooks once a<br/>
month, suggested art projects and books and tapes we could check out of the<br/>
school library, and otherwise left us alone. It didn&#39;t take us long to<br/>
figure out that the workbooks didn&#39;t need to be all finished, the teacher<br/>
just skimmed them and relied more on talking to John about what he&#39;d<br/>
learned about letters, numbers, etc. He was (still is) a very bright kid,<br/>
and she was always quite pleased with his progress. The last two months we<br/>
didn&#39;t even bother with the workbooks, but just kinda winged it on our own.<br/>
Of course John passed with flying colors. &lt;s&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The next year we moved to Washington state, and when we didn&#39;t find<br/>
anything like the Alaska Correspondence Program we enrolled John in second<br/>
grade and his brother, Jim, in kindergarten at the local public school.<br/>
After about three weeks it was clear that the boys weren&#39;t happy being in<br/>
school (mostly older kids being mean) and we took them both out of school.<br/>
My mother had introduced us to John Holt&#39;s Growing Without Schooling about<br/>
that time (I think his Plowboy Interview had just come out in The Mother<br/>
Earth News) and we decided homeschooling was the route for us.<br/>
<br/>
As far as teaching them, we played around with correspondence-school type<br/>
stuff for that first winter, making up notebooks with alphabet letters to<br/>
color or copy, some very simple number games (if Jim has six cookies and<br/>
wants to give you half, how many would you receive?&quot; &quot;WHAT? Jim share his<br/>
cookies evenly? Are you kidding?&quot;) After a while we found more interesting<br/>
things to do than play with schoolish stuff, and abandoned the notebooks<br/>
altogether. I still have them though. They&#39;re pretty cute. Lots of pictures<br/>
of cars and horses and knights in shining armor battling dragons in the<br/>
margins... One of these days I&#39;ll give the books to them for Christmas or<br/>
something. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But that was it as far as trying to teach any of our kids anything. We<br/>
didn&#39;t just totally leave them to their own devices, of course. We wrote<br/>
quite a bit in Home Education Magazine over the years about how we<br/>
approached learning as just part of everyday life (some of those writings<br/>
can be found at our website). If the kids had questions, we answered them.<br/>
If the kids got interested in something, we bought books and movies and<br/>
other stuff on the subject. We learned right along with them, and are still<br/>
learning, every day. In the last month I&#39;ve learned about rock climbing and<br/>
rock climbing gear and although I&#39;m still much happier with my own feet<br/>
planted on terra firma, it&#39;s a thrill to watch these kids of mine scramble<br/>
up a cliff and to see the sheer joy on their faces as they rappel back down<br/>
again. We&#39;re learning together, as usual.<br/>
<br/>
As far as how successful we&#39;ve been - well, we&#39;re fine on the reading, but<br/>
the jury&#39;s still out as far as writing goes. Every one of our kids reads as<br/>
well as I do - it&#39;s just something they do all the time because we run a<br/>
publishing company and we&#39;re a very book and magazine oriented family. Our<br/>
house has more bookshelves than cupboards or closets in it, and magazines<br/>
of all kinds are always all over the place. We read more than we watch TV<br/>
(though we all loved watching an old John Wayne/Dean Martin western last<br/>
night). I guess I&#39;d have to say overall, books are our first love, with<br/>
movies a very close second. We very often buy the book version of a movie -<br/>
right now I think we&#39;ve got a dozen or more books on the latest Star Wars<br/>
release (my favorite is Dorling-Kindersley&#39;s Star Wars Episode I Visual<br/>
Dictionary). &lt;s&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But writing has been more touch and go. Our daughter, Jody (19) is an<br/>
accomplished writer. She&#39;s always loved it, writes constantly, and her<br/>
handwriting is much more legible than either mine or her dad&#39;s (especially<br/>
her dad&#39;s - Mark has a doctorish scribble that often isn&#39;t even<br/>
decipherable). But the boys have avoided writing for the most part. Their<br/>
writing is obviously a struggle, but they all know that it&#39;s only because<br/>
they&#39;re just not interested in pursuing it as seriously as Jody has. The<br/>
two older boys write pretty well now because they need to for their<br/>
respective jobs, but they&#39;ve both said it was a damned nuisance to learn to<br/>
spell and to write legibly. But it didn&#39;t take either of them long to get<br/>
up to speed, and they&#39;ve both said it wasn&#39;t really all that hard to pick<br/>
up. The two younger boys are still avoiding writing whenever possible, but<br/>
I know they&#39;ll pick up on it when  they need to, when they find a use for<br/>
writing skills.<br/>
<br/>
I need to get back to work, but I&#39;m enjoying the breaks to answer your<br/>
questions, Ann.<br/>
