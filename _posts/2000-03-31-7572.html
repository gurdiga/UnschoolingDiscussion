<div><font size="2">I&#39;ve been reading these posts tonite, and am happy to hear 
them....for all you folks that seem to be popping up in the NW..let&#39;s get 
together!..My son is 4 1/2..and it&#39;s nice to see&nbsp; our beautiful days this 
Spring.....Thanks for all the moon goo ideas..we will be trying some of them 
out..I&#39;ll get back to you on all the fun I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have...this thread on 
MS, chronic Fatigue,Lupus,, and many others has been very interesting..lots 
of&nbsp;positive suggestions...I wonder if people have a Naturapath in their 
area? I know it has been a very hard road to find a doctor that is good...both 
personally related, and medically..Actually we have had such bad experiences 
with doctors it lead us to seek out educational oppurtunities in 
healthcare..such as self care..and in the process we learned alot about taking 
our wellness into our own hands instead of leaving it to the not so 
expert-Experts..who knows you best but yourself..if you have the time to get to 
know yourself that is..we have learned about many ways to nourish health in our 
family, and I believe that is the key..wholeness..our way of eating has changed 
alot over the past few years...and we did happen to find a doctor that was 
excellent..He is quite a wise man..he is a child advocate of the rainforest 
..taking kids over on tours to teach them about earth preservation, and an 
ethnobotanist that has studied plants for many years, and teaches how to use 
them in your home as medicine, and food...I haven&#39;t personally taken any of his 
classes, cause I&#39;ve already taken native plant, and medicine classes, but I am 
glad to hear that My doctor provides this sort of education for the 
community...this is important to me, when it comes to doctors..do they have 
something to share? that will improve my life? or do they have something that 
will confine my life? or bring me fathter from where I want to be?..we really 
related to him, as we have liver problems, and he suggested to us the very thing 
we were already doing with a friend...sweat lodge...it&#39;s a wonderful detoxifier, 
as well as a spiritual journey...i would recommend it to anyone who has physical 
or emotional or for that matter spiritual ailments that they are ready to attend 
to.&nbsp; I really relate to the part where someone mentioned ..and even if they 
didn&#39;t, that disease often has it&#39;s roots in experience...it&#39;s interesting how 
things occur..and the processes of healing..I do believe above all that all has 
it&#39;s purpose, and that many extroidinarily misunderstood conditions are of also 
of a spiritual nature, and can be cared for as such.&nbsp; It seems the Earth 
has given us all the cures for the worlds, sometimes seemingly unjustly 
ailments....it is our choice to , and readiness to heal that is often the 
crucial factor..and even sometimes..it is the disease itself that heals us..of 
things we would not imagine we are ailed with.&nbsp; Boy am I on a weaved web 
this clear and beautiful night..I checked out those great sites on 
Astronomy...we will be returning to them..my favorite planet has always been 
Mercury, personally..I was amazed at the history they had available..Thanks so 
much for sharing that with us.....Well the garden is one rewarding adventure my 
son, my husband and I share...I am the main entrepenuer but they follow with 
enthusiasm..it brings us togeher especialy during the harvest seasons..when we 
can all sit for a spell, and munch on the garden delites...we enjoy the garden 
very much, and I would like to hear more about other people&#39;s gardens&#39;s, foods, 
and outdoor adventures in the wild....if anyone can share.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
