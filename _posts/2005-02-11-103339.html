<div id="ygrps-yiv-174959645">My 3yo son was diagnosed with &#39;sensory integration disorder&#39; about a year <br/>
ago. At the time I did&#39;nt understand how that had &quot;anything to do with <br/>
anything&quot;. And honestly, I still question what the heck it really is and how <br/>
does it change him or me or how we do things.<br/>
The local library has no information regarding my sons &#39;disorder&#39;. The <br/>
internet is a great resource for reports,definitions and general <br/>
characteristics but it can&#39;t help me to understand the personal aspects of <br/>
it.<br/>
Are there any other parents on this list who have children with sensory <br/>
integration or know of children who have it? If so, I would love to hear <br/>
anything and everything that you may have to say about the subject. What <br/>
have you learned? What advice do you have for my son? for me? for our family <br/>
and friends who use this as fuel for why we should not homeschool?<br/>
Any and all opinions,experiences and information PLEASE!!<br/>

<br/>
Yes, lots. It&#39;ll be a haven! Not many diagnoses (some, though) but a <br/>
whole lot of understanding and wisdom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409339595">From: &quot;laurie c&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pmocl@...">pmocl@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My 3yo son was diagnosed with &#39;sensory integration disorder&#39; about a year<br/>
ago. At the time I did&#39;nt understand how that had &quot;anything to do with<br/>
anything&quot;. And honestly, I still question what the heck it really is and how<br/>
does it change him or me or how we do things.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering why the need to search out answers if you really don&#39;t see a<br/>
problem with how your son is? Maybe it was just the way it was worded but it<br/>
sounds like you don&#39;t see a &quot;problem&quot; or the need to change anything. If<br/>
that&#39;s the case, just enjoy your son for who he is. Labels can be a tricky<br/>
thing sometimes and cause more harm than good. Especially if the situation<br/>
isn&#39;t a drastic physical one.<br/>
<br/>
After you mentioned this in the post, I did some research on the net and<br/>
came to the conclusion that two of my daughters could very well be diagnosed<br/>
with something similar. To me it makes no difference. Yes there are<br/>
situations to handle with them that I don&#39;t have with my other two children,<br/>
but so what really? All 4 of my kids are different in many ways. And yes<br/>
sometimes those situations can cause turmoil around the house and<br/>
frustration on the part of my husband and me, but isn&#39;t that just a part of<br/>
parenting anyway? Figuring things out? Even children with similar problems<br/>
can react differently to what parents try and do to help, so I would say<br/>
it&#39;s pretty much trial and error anyway. Right?<br/>

Anne Ohman has a list that might help you a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
This list will still be good too, though.  Don&#39;t leave one for the other; you can have both! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling works the same for all kids.  If they&#39;re doing what&#39;s interesting and new to them because they want to, it doesn&#39;t matter what their learning style or &quot;disability&quot; (not a nice word) or &quot;gifts&quot; or intelligences--unschooling will work because they&#39;ll be being helped and encouraged to taste, feel, smell, hear and see the world.<br/>
