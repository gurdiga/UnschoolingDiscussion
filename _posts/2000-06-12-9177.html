<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981616251">Hi all,<br/>
I had this long e-mail all ready to send and ds deleted it somehow. <br/>
grrrrrrr.....<br/>
<br/>
So, I will see what I can remember.....<br/>
<br/>
Pris, I had to laugh at your comments about &quot;singing in the shower&quot;  he does <br/>
do that, too but only in baby babble hee hee hee.....I was chuckling and he <br/>
thought I was laughing at him right now and giggled too.<br/>
<br/>
The big timeline is a great idea.  How about going to the butcher and getting <br/>
paper then putting in along one long wall of the house.  Livingroom would be <br/>
a great conversational piece or hallway, then as the little ones become <br/>
interest in things (history wise and events) it can be added to the timeline. <br/>
 Great for education, conversation and decoration.....tee hee hee<br/>
<br/>
Amy, I am glad you liked the sites! <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I know that there was some other things I wanted to comment on, but <br/>
can&#39;t figure them out now, so ....oh well....<br/>
<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604037444">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
The butchers around here wrap meat in plastic bags -- yuck.  We&#39;re using<br/>
&quot;banner paper&quot; -- bought at an office supply store -- comes in a roll and<br/>
is not very expensive and also sturdy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280431858">my hubby is learning.  We are low to moderate income and his choice is to pay <br/>
for cable, so he has to deal with the inexpensive artwork.. and whatever else <br/>
I can get out of him......hee hee hee<br/>
<br/>
Tracy, loved hearing about your son&#39;s sucess.  I will have to remember to <br/>
relax when my little ones get that age.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I checked my mail early this morning and  emptied my box and when I <br/>
came home mid-afternoon I HAD 30 MESSAGES!  You guys are great!  Keep the <br/>
thoughts and ideas coming!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>

You mean this isn&#39;t how everyone&#39;s house looks?  I know it is time to take <br/>
things down and start fresh when our stuff starts needing a 3rd wall!  :)<br/>

Nance  (gotta get back to that timeline . . . hmmm  . . . cave drawings -- <br/>
that sounds messy and fun -- backyard time I think!)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-213293681">Our walls are all bright coloured paint, with a few prints and <br/>
paintings, one of the cast of ST Next Gen in &#39;civvies,&#39; one of <br/>
Scooby Doo...  We don&#39;t have &#39;artwork.&#39;  Unlike a friend of my <br/>
mother, who painted, in bright red gloss paint, on her living room <br/>
wall, &#39;Don&#39;t let the b******s grind you down.&#39;  (but without the <br/>
