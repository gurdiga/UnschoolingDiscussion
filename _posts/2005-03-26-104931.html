<br/>
Unschooling Gloriously Introduced   [01-16]<br/>
<br/>
(A gloriously fancy name for “intro to unschooling”)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Practicalities of Unschooling [02 16]<br/>
<br/>
That conference had asked that we provide practical hands-on information, but <br/>
I discussed in my talk that the important tools for unschooling are mental <br/>
and interpersonal.  (Another kind of intro.)<br/>
<br/>
Benefits of Video Games for Unschoolers [02 26]<br/>
<br/>
Panel: (standing and walking around, not sitting, but the sound quality is <br/>
AMAZINGLY good!)<br/>
Sandra Dodd, Dan Vilter and Kathy Ward,<br/>
Plus one child of each:  Jonathan Ward who was 18 I think, Matthew Vilter who <br/>
was 12, and Holly Dodd, who was 10, who were demonstrating games (Dan had set <br/>
up a big projection screen) and describing what they were doing.<br/>
    (After all that Intro, I find I only have one copy left of this one.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To Question, or Not to Question—That is the Question  [01- ? at least tell <br/>
him it was 2001]<br/>
<br/>
With Richard Prystowsky, (editor of Paths of Learning magazine), I was <br/>
discussing how a parent whose family of origin did NOT encourage question-asking, <br/>
whose parents tended to shush them, can learn to enjoy and encourage <br/>
question-and-answer dialogs, and how wonderful that is for unschoolers.  The underlying <br/>
theme was whether Jewish childrearing tradition has some principles that <br/>
Christian families could greatly benefit from knowing.  I was raised Baptist, <br/>
Richard was raised Jewish, and we’re both now Buddhist-esque, though Richard much <br/>
more than I am.<br/>
<br/>
Peaceful Parenting  [02 36]<br/>
<br/>
Also with Richard Prystowsky.<br/>
This is the tape more people have bought than all the others combined.  We’re <br/>
discussing practical ways to make family life more peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
(I charge $7.50 to mail one from here, and I take paypal, and if other list <br/>
owners see me selling something on the list they  might throw me off or put me <br/>
on moderation so I hid it at the bottom.  Shhh.)</div>
