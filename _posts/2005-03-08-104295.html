<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062112880">My inlaws have been questioning me about unschooling a lot lately, <br/>
as they have noticed that my 4yo son plays a *LOT* of X-Box, and <br/>
were a bit concerned about what it meant in terms of his <br/>
development. Anyway, my mother-in-law sent me this article yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.marinij.com/Stories/0,1413,234~26641~2749004,00.html">http://www.marinij.com/Stories/0,1413,234~26641~2749004,00.html</a><br/>
<br/>
along with a statement of confidence in us for allowing him to <br/>
follow his interests. It seems like she understands what we&#39;re doing <br/>
now, but even if she is just secretly imagining that Alex is <br/>
preparing for Med School she has at least stopped worrying about him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to pass the article along in case any of you <br/>
have kids who love video games and skeptical relatives. I think it <br/>
definitely illustrates how kids&#39; seemingly &#39;unproductive&#39; interests <br/>
can take them places their parents could not have imagined.<br/>
