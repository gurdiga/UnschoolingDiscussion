<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822156753"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Son #3 found a baby turtle in the river about 8 or 9<br/>
&gt;years ago.  He was about the size of a fifty cent<br/>
&gt;piece.  He brought him home in the bottom of<br/>
&gt;a Pepsi cup.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Awwwwwww....   :-)   I absolutely love turtles.  I<br/>
have worked with them, and I have many carved and<br/>
painted stone, seashell, wood, etc turtles all over my<br/>
home.  I have been thinking for some time about<br/>
getting a live one, and would love to hear more about<br/>
yours.  It would be fun to research turtles, reptiles,<br/>
amphibious and aquatic life, ponds etc.  If only my<br/>
kids were old enough to really get involved!  ;-) <br/>
There is a limit to how much 3 and 4 year old need or<br/>
want to absorb.  But I would love to do it just for<br/>
me.  If I can find the time between all the packing<br/>
and the selling and the moving!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655643632">We have turtles all over the house.  I did some ceramic milk can canisters a<br/>
few years ago and put turtles on them, too.  Cartoon character types.  The<br/>
kidlets favorite is the one I did that is leaning on his shell with a for<br/>
rent sign on it.  He has polka dotted boxers on.<br/>
<br/>
It use to be more fun when you could buy baby turtles because they are<br/>
easier to make real pets out of.  Now that we are being &quot;protected&quot; from<br/>
turtles, by the time they are big enough to be legally sold, they are kinda<br/>
set in their ways.<br/>
<br/>
Now, what has never made any sense to me is that it is legal to sell the<br/>
little guys to schools (like, duh, where are all the little children that<br/>
this law is suppose to protect from salmonella?) but not to individuals<br/>
untile they are at least 4&quot; across.<br/>
<br/>
Oh bother, (slapping self on forehead) do you suppose I could use my R-4 to<br/>
get around that goofy law????<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, ask away when you get to the point of getting one for yourself.<br/>
We&#39;ve built ours what the kidlets call a house and swimming pool.  When, and<br/>
if, we ever find just the right place in the country, we are going to<br/>
enclose a big porch or deck or something attrium-ish and put in a pool for<br/>
the turtles and the goldfish (we have some feeders the turtles never ate<br/>
that are now koi sized).<br/>

around it easily, other folks may be able to do the same :).<br/>

Same thing with the ban on painting enamel designs on the shells.    Death rates<br/>

pretty amazing.<br/>

purposes.   Not limited to &quot;schools&quot;.<br/>

We have a stock tank in our den  and  a mobile fenced pen enclosing &quot;kiddie&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122294425">Tennesee Tuxedo and Sweet Pea have a huge tank (sits on top two dressers)<br/>
with one end an &quot;island&quot; with petrified wood for sunning stones and &quot;trees&quot;<br/>
growing in it.  We took plexi-glass and created a seperate section so they<br/>
could have a land section and a water section.  Then we took somemore<br/>
plexi-glass and stainless steel wire mesh to enclose a pond filter and<br/>
aeration system.  They are really funny in that they crawl on top the<br/>
plexi-glass that is the top of the pump cage and dangle their back feet in<br/>
the aerated water flow.  They come up when they are called by name and eat<br/>
shrimp or apples or goldfish grass out of your hands.  The kids also give<br/>
them calcium baths (they call it the turtle jacuzzi) in the bathtub.  We<br/>
have an all organic yard and they get to &quot;play&quot; in the yard when we have a<br/>
nice sunny day so they get their sun vitamins that way as well as from the<br/>
vita light we have on the tank.<br/>
<br/>
Tennessee is about 10 yo now and we don&#39;t know how old Sweet Pea is.  We<br/>
&quot;rescued&quot; her about 6 years ago and she was full grown then.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the &quot;feeder&quot; goldfish are now over 6 years old and they have their<br/>
own 45 gallon tank.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the fish and turtles have just about taken over the house &lt;g&gt;  And<br/>
did I mention they now have a tarantulla buddy who is 13 years old?  We&#39;re<br/>
looking for a BIG tank for him so he can have a habitat set up too.<br/>
