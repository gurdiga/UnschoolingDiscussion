<div id="ygrps-yiv-122708467">&lt;&lt;  Should she simply follow her taste buds,<br/>
she could still get into trouble..... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When kids are allowed free choice, they don&#39;t go by taste buds.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s seeming impossible for some people to begin to grasp what we&#39;re talking <br/>
about.  Kids who have free choice eat protein, vegetables, fruit.  Not ONLY <br/>
those, but they eat all kinds of food, by choice.  And when it has been <br/>
choice (because they become hungry for all kinds of foods--the body balances <br/>
itself), they have no aversions to any foods they&#39;ve been forced to eat.<br/>
<br/>
The same way my kids will play with dictionaries or maps for fun, because <br/>
those things have not been identified as &quot;educational&quot; or &quot;school stuff,&quot; <br/>
they will eat the kinds of foods that some families have to force.  Holly <br/>
prefers broccoli and spinach over all other vegetables, and will request them <br/>
for lunch in a house full of all kinds of foods, or from the store.<br/>
<br/>
My kids reject American cheese and want Colby or Cheddar.  They think <br/>
American cheese is yucky.  I do too, but I didn&#39;t tell them so.  I offered <br/>
them both and they rejected the &quot;cheese food.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
They reject processed meats.  They think pork rinds are poison.  The only <br/>
want real meat they&#39;ve seen clean, and rarely even that--they don&#39;t at all <br/>
prize or crave meat, as my husband does who had to eat lima beans and other <br/>
tacky vegetables to get his very small portion of meat for years and <br/>
years--to this day he will eat NOTHING with peas in it because his mother <br/>
laughed at him and said he did TOO like peas, and he was TOO going to eat <br/>
them.  I can picture it clearly, because she once told me &quot;yes you are&quot; when <br/>
I told her I wasn&#39;t going to eat tongue for lunch at her house.  &quot;Yes you <br/>
are.&quot;  Guess whether I did.<br/>
<br/>
So those who think the children of those families in which there is freedom <br/>
to eat food are all eating ice cream and donuts are wrong and hugely wrong.   <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have believed it before I saw it, but I&#39;m totally glad I&#39;ve seen <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Kirby took two of his older (college age) friends out to eat, <br/>
because they&#39;ve treated him several times.  So he took $30 of his own money, <br/>
and they went to IHOP.  It&#39;s not a health food restaurant, but neither is it <br/>
burgers or pizza or an ice cream shop.  I doubt that he ordered anything <br/>
junky; I doubt that he ordered dessert.  He probably had milk, or maybe soda. <br/>
 If it had been breakfast he would have ordered juice, even in the total <br/>
absence of parental witness.<br/>
