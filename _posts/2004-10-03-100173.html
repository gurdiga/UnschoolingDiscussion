<div id="ygrps-yiv-638963723">I was just thinking of this story!  My almost 3 yr. old as a book of Football Opposites (Wide/Narrow; Above/Below; Full/Empty, etc.) and lately he has taken great joy--glee, even--in reading it &quot;wrong!&quot;  Sometimes he has to take a minute to &#39;get it&#39; the right way in his head before he can verbally switch it, but you can totally see that he knows the full equipment box is really full--it just makes the book much more interesting and funny to point at it and say &quot;EMPTY!&quot;<br/>

Always swim in a storm!!! hee!  Love it!  <br/>
<br/>
These are cool kids.<br/>

  When my boys were reciting the pool rules wrong, after swim lessons years <br/>
  ago, I still knew they knew the rules.   &quot;Never swim with a buddy, always swim <br/>
  alone; always swim in a storm; always run by the pool...&quot;<br/>
