<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721104520">I can&#39;t remember who suggested reading testimonials from last years <br/>
conference but whoever it was, THANKS!!! We read those along with all <br/>
other available information and the entire gang now has &quot;THE FEVER&quot;. <br/>
We can&#39;t wait to go!!!! However, I am really looking forward to a <br/>
nice_long_warm_summer until then. We are from Northern Ohio and this <br/>
winter has really felt like it&#39;s been TOO LONG!!!! I realize it&#39;s <br/>
only April but I NEED some warmth already!! I&#39;m sure there are many <br/>
out there that can relate. By the way, besides Ang, anyone else from <br/>
Ohio???</div>

 </span></blockquote>you said you were checking out my websites, there&#39;s a couple of ohio people <br/>
from this list and from a few others on the unschoolers ohio list that I <br/>
started....it&#39;s in my sig....come on over :0)  Some of us in central/north <br/>
columbus area got to meet last week, it was cool. It was just an inclusive <br/>
homeschooling group, all types of different styles, but I was amazed at the <br/>
number of unschoolers or eclectic(unschooling tendencies) there were. I felt <br/>
just like someone else saying they felt at home at the SC conference. Hope I <br/>
get to go to SC, don&#39;t know if I can......<br/>

    I&#39;m in Columbus. Born and raised here. It sure is chilly today.<br/>
    We really loved the conference. We&#39;ve also grown and learned a bunch<br/>
since last year too. We&#39;re looking forward to August. Actually all summer we<br/>
have plans for great adventures. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532142104">Hello all!  My name is Sunny, and I was schooled as a child.  I promise,<br/>
I&#39;m getting better...lol  My husband and I are looking into<br/>
homeschooling.  Well, a combination of home- and un- schooling to be<br/>
more accurate.  Our little one, Orin, learns better when he moves at his<br/>
own pace.  He would probably benefit greatly from unschooling, but I<br/>
need slightly more structure, at least until I&#39;ve finished deprogramming<br/>
myself from the years of schooling I went through.  So, for now we&#39;re<br/>
doing a mix of the two - letting him choose what he wants to learn at<br/>
the moment, and me helping him learn with worksheets, field trips,<br/>
games, etc.  At least I know by now that anything can be a learning<br/>
experience, if you approach it the right way.<br/>
 <br/>
For example, little 4 year old Orin is, at this moment, learning the<br/>
basics of architecture, art, and classical music.  Okay, in reality he<br/>
is building a house out of a cardboard box and packing paper.  He&#39;s<br/>
already gathered crayons to decorate it when he&#39;s done, and Fantasia is<br/>
playing on the TV not 3 feet from him.   ;-)<br/>
 <br/>
We are just starting out on the home/un schooling path, although it<br/>
feels like we&#39;ve been doing this all along anyway.  We are in NW<br/>
Florida, and thankfully have already met one other unschooling family<br/>
(and hope to meet more soon).<br/>
 <br/>
I guess that&#39;s the basics for now.  I&#39;m sure you all will learn more<br/>
about us as the years go by...lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447743966">hi Sunny! It was nice to hear from you. We are relatively new to this too and I am also using a combination of both approaches with my children. My Sadie (2 1/2 ) in particular is guiding me to what she wants to learn about and I am learning how to let her guide me. I am giving her the tools that she needs (great art and supplystuff, videos, musical instruments ect) and just letting her go at it. We are in Massachusetts and I am hoping to meet some others soon. It can be a little lonely:) Kelli<br/>
