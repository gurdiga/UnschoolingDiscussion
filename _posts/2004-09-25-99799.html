 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t call it an &quot;unhealthy use&quot; but I think some kinds of use can <br/>
be indicators of problems - symptoms of a lack of health. If one of my <br/>
normally high-energy, active, productive teenage daughters began, for <br/>
no apparent reason,  to spend most of her days lying on the couch <br/>
watching daytime tv like Oprah, soap operas, Jerry Springer, and <br/>
infomercials, that would indicate that something was going on with her <br/>
that almost certainly wasn&#39;t healthy. I&#39;d suspect depression and be <br/>
worried about her.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I don&#39;t worry at all when they have periods of time <br/>
of watching an unusual amount of tv - usually, but not always, it is <br/>
apparent to me that they are TIRED and this is recuperation time from a <br/>
period of intense activity. Or there is emotional stuff going on in <br/>
their lives (boyfriend breakups, etc.) and they are utilizing this time <br/>
to keep one part of their brain occupied while other parts are <br/>
processing the issues. Occasionally it means they are coming down with <br/>
a cold or something. Once in a while it has meant, for Roya, that she <br/>
was procrastinating on doing something she felt she should do, but <br/>
dreaded. Sometimes I can say, &quot;So, what is up?&quot; and that&#39;ll initiate a <br/>
stream of information and deep discussion. Other times, the kid&#39;ll say, <br/>
&quot;Nothing, just tired.&quot; So be it. I keep an eye on them - usually spend <br/>
time watching with them (which I don&#39;t usually do, by the way).<br/>
<br/>
If you just tell them, &quot;Turn off the tv - two hours a day is enough for <br/>
you,&quot; then you could be treating a symptom and masking a problem. AND, <br/>
you could even be removing them from something that is actually helping <br/>
and healing for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306552752">Some thoughts on addiction:<br/>
<br/>
If someone has had the disease of addiction prominent in their lives, either<br/>
suffering themselves or having suffered the effects of addiction in parents<br/>
or other family members, they can sometimes (maybe often) be looking at<br/>
behaviors, ideas, events, their children&#39;s personalities, other people,<br/>
through &quot;addiction-colored lenses&quot;. They sometimes see behavior and mentally<br/>
categorize it as &quot;obsessive&quot;, &quot;scary&quot;, &quot;compulsive&quot;, &quot;addictive&quot;,<br/>
&quot;worrying&quot;, &quot;excessive&quot;, &quot;out-of-control&quot; and possibly as indicative of<br/>
&quot;addictive personality&quot; in their children, and start feeling all the fear<br/>
and desire to control that will create. <br/>
<br/>
If looked at through the compassionate lenses of Unschooling, the same<br/>
behaviors might be described as &quot;immersive learning&quot;, &quot;passionate&quot;,<br/>
&quot;committed&quot;, &quot;absorbing&quot;, &quot;curious&quot;, &quot;fascinating&quot; or more neutrally as<br/>
&quot;decompressing&quot;, &quot;temporary&quot;, or indicative of the kind of specific issues<br/>
that Pam described in her post.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the way some of our children use electronic media *looks* like<br/>
obsession sometimes. But does it stay that way forever? Does it progress to<br/>
become more compulsive, expand over more of their lives, take over all their<br/>
thinking to the exclusion of loving human relationships, eventually<br/>
superseding even basic survival needs? Because that is what the insidious<br/>
disease of addiction often does.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know with any surety whether electronic media &quot;can&quot; become<br/>
addictive, or not. I don&#39;t think it does over the long haul in the vast<br/>
majority of our engaged, busy and free Unschooled children. I don&#39;t see it<br/>
becoming that way in Jayn anyway.<br/>
<br/>
For a description of immersive learning in relation to computer use (and<br/>
other areas), see &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter.<br/>
<br/>
It has been at least two weeks since I recommended her book. Falling down on<br/>
the job! [vbg]<br/>

============<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, I&#39;m obsessive and compulsive and I never thought of those as bad things! *lol* I wouldn&#39;t get nearly as much done without those wonderful traits.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, as the daughter of an alcoholic, I learned somewhere along the way (back when I was doing therapy) that alcoholics and children of alcoholics often have a hard time completing projects and finishing things they started. Being obsessive and compulsive has meant that I never suffered from that particular trait.<br/>
<br/>
I think the point about overly-controlling children because of a perceived fear is a really good one.<br/>

I agree with just about everything in Robin&#39;s post except that.  I especially <br/>
liked this:<br/>
<br/>

become more compulsive, expand over more of their lives, take over all their<br/>
thinking to the exclusion of loving human relationships, eventually<br/>
superseding even basic survival needs?-=-<br/>
<br/>
And the contrast to this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-If looked at through the compassionate lenses of Unschooling, the same<br/>
behaviors might be described as &quot;immersive learning&quot;, &quot;passionate&quot;,<br/>
&quot;committed&quot;, &quot;absorbing&quot;, &quot;curious&quot;, &quot;fascinating&quot; or more neutrally as<br/>
&quot;decompressing&quot;, &quot;temporary&quot;, or indicative of the kind of specific issues<br/>

<br/>
But I don&#39;t think &quot;addiction&quot; itself is a &quot;disease.&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &quot;disease of addiction.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Alcoholics become dependent on the alcohol.<br/>
Smokers become dependent on the cigarettes.<br/>
Gamblers are like bar-trained rats who have won a few times and keep pressing <br/>
that bar to get another win.   That&#39;s operant conditioning combined with big <br/>
wishes and the person gets stuck there. (And sometimes it&#39;s a avoidance of <br/>
doing other things.)<br/>
<br/>
If someone is depressed, he might sleep a lot, or eat a lot, or drink a lot <br/>
(even if he&#39;s not prone to alcoholism and isn&#39;t an alcoholic).  If someone is <br/>
in a low-level avoidance kind of funk, he might watch TV a lot, or listen to <br/>
the same sad music a lot, or play solitaire a lot, or go to cheap afternoon <br/>
movies a lot.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who like routines and repetitive motions, and same hobbies <br/>
and same same same.  People who play tennis every day, or swim every day.   <br/>
People who knit or crochet baby blankets even when they don&#39;t have any friends <br/>
who are about to have a baby.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people have the same breakfast every day.  <br/>
<br/>
I know &quot;addiction&quot; has meanings beyond the literal original, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think there&#39;s a disease.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618873087">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But I don&#39;t think &quot;addiction&quot; itself is a &quot;disease.&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &quot;disease of addiction.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To be honest I don&#39;t know whether it is &quot;a&quot; disease, a chronic condition, a<br/>
state of mind, a physiological tendency, or what the medical definition is<br/>
(and I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not at all motivated to do the research about that). <br/>
<br/>
I do know that the Recovery Community of the 12 Steps (AA, NA, CA etc) uses<br/>
the &quot;disease model&quot; as their way of describing addiction. They do consider<br/>
that there is a disease of addiction, particularly because experientially<br/>
when someone is addicted to one thing (the &quot;drug of choice&quot;) and begins to<br/>
work a program of recovery, often the addictive behavior or obsessive<br/>
feelings crop up somewhere else or are recognized as being part of other<br/>
areas of the addict&#39;s life (like shopping compulsively) or with some other<br/>
type of substance (food is big substitute substance). It is probably not a<br/>
disease in the medical sense that there is some germ or organism necessarily<br/>
causing an immune response, or however a doctor might define the word<br/>
&quot;disease&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think this naming issue is a bit like the word &quot;Unschooling&quot;. We who are<br/>
doing it fully - whole life Radical Unschooling - have a definition and<br/>
usage of the word that is different from other people who (somewhat<br/>
annoyingly to me) consider themselves &quot;unschooling, except for math&quot; or<br/>
&quot;unschooling with unit studies&quot;. The addicts seeking recovery are the ones<br/>
who are using the phrase &quot;disease of addiction&quot; because it seems to help<br/>
recovery, even if outside of that community the phrase seems wrong. <br/>
<br/>
The main point I was trying to make earlier is that sometimes past<br/>
experiences with addiction color our perceptions, have us making negative<br/>
assumptions, and influence our word usage in ways that can increase fear and<br/>
decrease our ability to just observe our children. I don&#39;t think that being<br/>
afraid of electronic media is helpful for Unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
My concern is that parents will grasp &quot;my kids might become addicted to TV&quot; <br/>
or &quot;...video games&quot; and then they&#39;ll run off to prevent them watching enough to <br/>
decide to stop.<br/>
<br/>
Without the freedom to decide, no decision is made by the child and we&#39;re <br/>
right back where we started.<br/>
<br/>
Can people become addicted to the freedom to make their own decisions?<br/>
Isn&#39;t that one of the arguments against radical unschooling, that they won&#39;t <br/>
know how to go to class when they&#39;re grown, or how to wake up and go to work <br/>
if the don&#39;t have bedtimes and required &quot;out of bed&quot; times?<br/>
<br/>
Some people are more compulsive than others.  Some are more into repetition <br/>
and schedules.  Some are restless and want to do what they&#39;ve never done <br/>
before, all the time. &lt;g&gt;   Addicted to changes?  I don&#39;t think so.   Just <br/>
personality differences.<br/>
<br/>
Some who don&#39;t want to stop drinking speak disparagingly of those who are <br/>
doing AA and being sober as being &quot;addicted to recovery.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith said when he spoke at the HSC conference a couple of years back <br/>
that people need to be with the people they want to become like (not a quote, <br/>
he said it better).  If people want to &#39;be recovered,&#39; they need to be around <br/>
people who care about not drinking (or whatever it is).  If parents want to <br/>
become parents who are courageous about freedoms for children, they need to <br/>
commune with those kinds of parents (at least online or somehow if they can&#39;t find <br/>
a group of them in person).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes past experience with addiction makes the parents afraid of its <br/>
genetic component.  But I don&#39;t think the &quot;addiction&quot; to drugs or alcohol or <br/>
gambling has the same physical or emotional reward and then damage as kids get from <br/>
video games and DVDs.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t think that being afraid of electronic media is helpful for <br/>
Unschooling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree.   <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday on PBS I saw a documentary on the history of video gaming, from <br/>
pre-Pong days to the probable future.   I had been in Kirby&#39;s room playing the <br/>
new game on Neopets (Destruct-O-Match II, a Tetrisish kind of thing) and had the <br/>
TV on PBS just to see what they had on Sundays.  Something on garage sales <br/>
and thrift stores, and tracking some of the items to their inventors (with video <br/>
interviews and tie-ins, VERY cool).    Then the video game thing came on and <br/>
I was stuck to it.    <br/>
<br/>
Keith came home from being out and about, and the pot of chicken curry I had <br/>
put on was done, but I could not leave the TV.  So Keith came to see what was <br/>
so good, and HE was stuck.  (He&#39;s also an engineer who has a specialty in <br/>
graphics.)   I&#39;m ordering the thing on DVD to watch with the kids, because though <br/>
they know lots more than we do about the later stuff, we can tell them eye <br/>
witness stories about the first things. &lt;g&gt;  And two towns in southern New Mexico <br/>
were named--Alamogordo (where Keith grew up) and Socorro.<br/>
<br/>
Three quotes from it (I didn&#39;t write down who said what, but I&#39;m ordering a <br/>
copy of the show, so if anyone really cares later, I can check them).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The world expects too much in one year,<br/>
and not enough in ten.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People enjoy learning, but they don&#39;t enjoy being educated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;. . . the zen-like quality of the experience.&quot; (about the early target games <br/>
like space invaders)<br/>
<br/>
The Video Game Revolution<br/>
1-800-937-5387<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t addicted to that program, but at the time I was watching it, it was <br/>
more important to me than getting a bowl of food was.<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; lives are filled with moments when what they&#39;re doing is more <br/>
important than anything else.  Sometimes that&#39;s sports, or a conversation or a card <br/>
game or board game. Sometimes it&#39;s a movie or a song they&#39;re listening to.  <br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s getting a bowl of food. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I think Will is &quot;addicted&quot; to that freedom, if you want to define it that  <br/>
way.  He feels very very strongly about it, anyway.  <br/>
 <br/>
I told him about a woman in Memphis who has been living on the sidewalk  <br/>
outside the Lorraine Motel for years and years as a protest against the city  <br/>
taking her home in the Lorraine Motel and turning it into a museum in  memory of <br/>
Martin Luther King, Jr.  We drove by and saw her sitting  there.  He was simply <br/>
astounded that someone would go to that length to  defend what they believe <br/>
in.  But as he considered it, he said, &quot;I would do  that, if someone tried to <br/>
make me go to school against my will.  I&#39;d do  whatever I could to keep it from <br/>
happening.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
He makes his decisions, and then stands by his decisions.  He  makes up his <br/>
mind, and then he generally follows through on them.  He  decides whether the <br/>
competitive baseball team&#39;s coach is respectful enough for  him, and if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t think so, he doesn&#39;t try out...and he doesn&#39;t whine about  not getting to <br/>
play for that team.  If he were to choose to get up early  every day and go to <br/>
practice, he&#39;d either get up and do it, or change his mind  and find another <br/>
way to get what he wants.<br/>
 <br/>
A kid knowing that he has that freedom to go and do what he wants AND has  <br/>
the option to change his mind is much more empowered than one who is forced to  <br/>
get up every day, just to practice getting up every day.  <br/>
 <br/>

&lt;&lt; Sandra ~ we have it digitally recorded and would be happy to put it on a<br/>
<br/>
video tape for you...Do you still have a VCR?  Let me know if you&#39;re<br/>
<br/>
interested. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the offer, but I already ordered it on DVD.  Kirby&#39;s room only <br/>
plays DVDs these days, not tapes (until we rearrange/re-hook/revamp), and that&#39;s <br/>
where it will be watched, things being what they are with the migrations of <br/>
teenagers here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After you mentioned it I was hoping I&#39;d see it, but it came upon my all <br/>
accidental-like.  I knew when I saw it you&#39;d said it was good, though!<br/>

&gt; (and I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not at all motivated to do the research about that).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The addicts seeking recovery are the ones<br/>
&gt; who are using the phrase &quot;disease of addiction&quot; because it seems to help<br/>
&gt; recovery, even if outside of that community the phrase seems wrong.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For what it&#39;s worth:<br/>
<br/>
The American Medical Association has given formal recognition to the disease<br/>
concept since 1956. Their recognizing alcoholism and other drug addiction as<br/>
an illness implies several things:<br/>
<br/>
  The illness can be described.<br/>
  The course of the illness is predictable and progressive.<br/>
  The disease is primary – that is, it is not just a symptom of some other<br/>
underlying disorder.<br/>
  It is permanent.<br/>
  It is terminal. If left untreated, it results in insanity or premature<br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
Using this model, there is little correlation betw. being addicted to drugs<br/>
or alcohol and being &quot;addicted&quot; to TV/other media. One might exhibit<br/>
&quot;addictive&quot; or compulsive behavior re. TV (watching to the exclusion of<br/>
other normal activities/physiological needs), but I think that would be a<br/>
symptom of something else, not an addiction born out of repeated usage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The main point I was trying to make earlier is that sometimes past<br/>
&gt; experiences with addiction color our perceptions, have us making negative<br/>
&gt; assumptions, and influence our word usage in ways that can increase fear<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; afraid of electronic media is helpful for Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. And caution is hardly the same as fear-based paralysis.<br/>

the other kinds of &quot;addictive&quot; behaviros are referred to as &quot;obsessions&quot; and they are not <br/>
considered diseases.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, Sandra, my son is nearly 18 and he has hair as long as Kirby&#39;s (we were so surprised!) <br/>
and has finally found a place to play Magic every week. Last night, he finally met some <br/>
D&D friends through his new job at Starbucks. Your encouragement and example were <br/>
inspirational to me and eventually helpful to my son. Thanks for posting that great piece <br/>
about how Kirby&#39;s future looks to him.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. :)<br/>
