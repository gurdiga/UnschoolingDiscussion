<div id="ygrps-yiv-17293572">****What a difference to<br/>
Florida, where apparently nursing moms do not exist.  Let me also<br/>
mention for those of us who had trouble enough, it did not ease our<br/>
transition into public life.****<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t Florida where the woman was kicked out of Fundie-Mart, er, uh <br/>
Wal-Mart for nursing in public??  Shameful!  Women roam topless on a beach <br/>
but stick a baby to the breast and suddenly everyone is mortified.<br/>
<br/>
The soap box is getting bubbly!<br/>

I have never encountered any problem here in FL with nursing anywhere in<br/>
public. No one has ever said anything to more or given me anything but<br/>
approving looks. If there were offended people, I never saw them.<br/>

No we actually do have topless and nude beaches here. Clearly marked. We<br/>
also have word of mouth gay beaches too. Never any problems with the ones in<br/>
my local area.<br/>
