<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496463499"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;If you have a &quot;school day&quot; you&#39;re not unschooling.  If something changes at<br/>
&gt;3:00, you&#39;re still dividing the world into &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;not<br/>
&gt;educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh my gosh. Yikes! You are so right! I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t see this!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;If your son has a hard time going to sleep and then wakes up in the middle <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;the night, it is very, very likely that he&#39;s being expected to sleep too<br/>
&gt;much.  Not all kids need 8 hours of sleep, and if you&#39;re expecting MORE <br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt;8 hours (he has a bedtime), he will wake up when he&#39;s had enough sleep.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have always known he had &quot;night owl&quot; tendencies. I want to honor that, but <br/>
am not quite sure how to get it to all &quot;fit&quot; in the family.<br/>
I have a feeling I&#39;m going to be sorry I just said that! lol, grin<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe if you let him stay up as late as he wants playing video games in his<br/>
&gt;room or reading then he&#39;ll sleep through from the time he goes to bed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to appear ignorant :-)  but is this seriously ok to do?? The <br/>
video games, I mean. He doesn&#39;t want to read when he wakes up. I&#39;ve tried <br/>
setting him up with a reading light and books so they&#39;re handy at the time <br/>
and he doesn&#39;t have to go searching. Incidentally, this is our 2nd year of <br/>
hs. He went to ps for K-3.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;It works for us.<br/>
&gt;Sandra<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll give it a try and see how it works. You can probably all tell I did <br/>
&gt;not come from a hs/follow your interests/do your own thing kind of family!! <br/>
&gt;heh heh<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you!! :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Finally,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;after a year of begging, pleading, yelling, crying,<br/>
&gt;and still no sleeping, we discovered unschooling and<br/>
&gt;the fabulous parenting ideas that go with it. Why do<br/>
&gt;they have to go to bed at 8pm? Well, for my sanity,<br/>
&gt;for one! We have made a great compromise---- they can<br/>
&gt;stay up as late as they want, IN THEIR ROOM, BEING<br/>
&gt;QUIET. It worked! They play quietly, read, even<br/>
&gt;learned all the states on Nick&#39;s leap pad!<br/>
&gt;By the way, as someone who is just learning these new<br/>
&gt;parenting skills, I appreciate all the ideas, advice,<br/>
&gt;and chatter. I feel at home and am finally able to<br/>
&gt;shed the limiting ideas I grew up with.<br/>
&gt;Learning all the time,<br/>
&gt;Kerry<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess it&#39;s just taking me awhile longer than I expected to &quot;catch on!&quot; <br/>
This is another great idea, that just may help--in fact, I already can feel <br/>
it will!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;**I think you are wise beyond your years and probably helped the mom in<br/>
&gt;question more than you know. Thank you for sharing that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;--Valerie in Tacoma<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Valerie is absolutely correct here! I tried to send a reply out to your <br/>
wonderful post, Ren, but in case it didn&#39;t work (I was having a rough time <br/>
with it :-)  ), thank you can&#39;t say enough for what you wrote. -Casey :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We did this recently too.  Our 10 year old daughter loves to stay up<br/>
&gt;half the night, and sleep half the day.  Until she begged us to let her<br/>
&gt;watch Nightmare on Elm Street, &quot;everybody else has seen it&quot;.  After<br/>
&gt;several months of this I let her try the movie.  As I expected, she<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t last too long and has slept with us every night for a week now,<br/>
&gt;going to bed at our bedtime and up early.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just want to say, that is one scaaary movie, isn&#39;t it?? I had to leave the <br/>
theater just to get my bearings while I watched it. My oldest wants to watch <br/>
stuff like that, too. I&#39;m perplexed, I guess.<br/>
