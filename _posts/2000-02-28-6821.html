Don&#39;t worry three year olds often don&#39;t want the company of other <br/>
three year olds.  It doesn&#39;t mean that they will not be socialized, <br/>
socialization happens whenever they are in contact with any other <br/>
person, no matter what the age.<br/>
<br/>
School, preschool etc are the worse places on to learn to be <br/>
socialized, mostly antisocial behaviours are learned there.<br/>
<br/>
How is he at relating to people not in his own age group?<br/>

I have 4 sons (18, 16, 12, 9). I don&#39;t recall any of them playing *with*<br/>
other kids very much at all at that age. Sometimes they seemed to like to<br/>
play *alongside* other kids. We went to alsorts of playgroups etc. but the<br/>
benefit was that mother got some socialisation &lt;g&gt; And even those kids that<br/>
do like playing with others, don&#39;t play *nicely* for very long. Kids this<br/>
age are just too little to really understand things like sharing, having<br/>
turns etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just wait, and it&#39;ll happen when he&#39;s ready. Honest. The thing is, we focus<br/>
on our own kids so much. When we look around at all the others, we see them<br/>
doing what we&#39;d like ours to be doing. But we only look for a few minutes.<br/>
In Playcentre, which is a parent run preschool system here in New Zealand,<br/>
parents are asked to participate in parent education. One of the things we<br/>
had to do, was observe a child - *not* our own. We had to write down<br/>
everything that child did and said, and who to, what they said etc.<br/>
Sometimes it was just for 10 minutes, but sometimes it was for a whole<br/>
morning. It was a great thing to do - it helped me realise that other kids<br/>
weren&#39;t the perfect little darlings I, in my role as anxious mother, assumed<br/>
them to be. So next time you go to gym, try watching someone else&#39;s kid for<br/>
a while - not the little star (there&#39;s always one of those) but just one or<br/>
two of the other ordinary little kids.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes think that the fear of my children being social misfits has been<br/>
the biggest fear I had. Having 4 boys at the ages they are now, I&#39;ve stopped<br/>
worrying. I have 2 extroverts, 2 introverts, but they are all just fine in<br/>
their individual ways.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to worry - it will be okay. Truely.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with Sue.  Not only are toddlers/preschoolers not very good at being social with each other because they are all in the same primitive stage of egocentrism combined with lack of social skills, but they don&#39;t really care to either.  They are not at a very social age for peers.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are three years old, and two years old next week, respectively.  We stopped attending our weekly playgroup for a variety of reasons, not the least of which were negative social repercussions for them.  We do not take any classes or attend any groups, they do not have sitters, and they do not attend day care.  <br/>
<br/>
While they do have the benefit of having each other to play with (they are mostly inseperable) we are taking steps to seperate them more and give them more alone time.  This arose as a problem due to my elder son&#39;s hyperactive and overbearing personality, coupled with his brother&#39;s quiet and shy demeanor.  We feel that our younger son is not being given the time or opportunity to develop his own interests and personality due to being always overridden by his brother.  <br/>
<br/>
So we have arranged two weekly &quot;Daddy Days&quot;  where each of the boys gets to go out for alone time with their father to do something special once a week (Thomas on Tue. night and Alex on Thur. night) while the other has the opportunity to stay home and do something alone with me, or do their own thing, without his brother.  <br/>
<br/>
Other than that, they are learning about personal boundaries, manners and empathy all in the safety and forgiving environment of their relationships at home.  They see other children at the playground and are quite open and social with them, they interact well with quests who come to our house or people whose homes we visit, and they talk to strangers in stores, etc.  I feel that it is vitally important to let them develop the confidence and competence in their social skills first in the safety of home with us, and them slowly reach out farther and farther with them as they are ready.  I don&#39;t believe in forcing them to be social or into &quot;enrichment&quot; situations.  I do believe in giving them access to opportunities to be social with peers as they show the readiness and desire to do that.  So far, they could not really care less about it if they tried.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76979197">Hi Eileen!<br/>
<br/>
I am TOTALLY new at this cyber communication gig, having just signed-up<br/>
last night, so here is my first attempt at soap-boxing!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am writing to tell you your 3 year old child sounds TOTALLY normal. <br/>
There could be several explanations for his lack of interest in other<br/>
children just now.  And kids grow and change so exceptionally quickly,<br/>
bare in mind he could be a totally different child in 6-12 months.  His<br/>
lack of interest in others would be apparent even if -as you put it- you<br/>
were like every other conforming parent and had him in<br/>
preschool/daycare.  Perhaps he is just naturally shy.  That&#39;s his right<br/>
and his temperment is his own.  Look how many of us adults struggle in<br/>
social situations?  Not all of us are confident regarding large parties,<br/>
public speaking, travel, you name it.  Why aren&#39;t our children allowed<br/>
the same privelege?  I am constantly annoyed with &quot;bullies&quot; who demand<br/>
all children should behave in a prescribed way and if the children<br/>
don&#39;t, a judgemental finger is always wagging at the parents. <br/>
Especially if you&#39;re home/un-schooling.  Aside from normal shyness,<br/>
(which almost EVERY child experiences in one form or another; it&#39;s<br/>
nature&#39;s way of protecting our children from potentially unnerving<br/>
situations) let us not forget that this child is still only a toddler,<br/>
an infant really in terms of an entire lifespan, and it&#39;s normal for<br/>
children to simply lack the maturity at that age to comfortably conduct<br/>
themselves around strangers.  Again, he could be a totally different<br/>
personality in a year.  He&#39;s just not interested and/or ready yet. <br/>
That&#39;s no reflection on you or homeschooling.  If anything it shows he<br/>
is firm about his attachment to you and he doesn&#39;t need outsiders to<br/>
meet his needs.  In the future, his attachment/security/relationship<br/>
with you will only contribute to his &quot;socialization&quot; in a positive way.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s just a very good judge of character and hasn&#39;t met anyone who<br/>
measures up yet!  For the first 6 years and beyond every parenting book<br/>
worth its salt, recognizes that the mother-child bond is THE most<br/>
important relationship to cultivate.  He will get to know the rest of<br/>
the world after the security you two have is firmly established. Forget<br/>
the so-called &quot;norms&quot; for social development.  Don&#39;t push your child<br/>
into stressful situations with strangers, it will only complicate the<br/>
issue.  Embrace this time that he is still all your own, because when<br/>
things change with him you will miss the fact that you&#39;ve lost your<br/>
baby!  I was very shy and somewhat of a loner most of my childhood and<br/>
to this day I think I handle social situations much more successfully,<br/>
courteously and sensitively than most of my compatriates.  And I now<br/>
know literally hundreds of acquaintances through my various volunteer<br/>
organizations and interests.  We have to come up with a new definition<br/>
of &quot;socialization&quot; because I don&#39;t like what it represents according to<br/>
others&#39; definition.  3 kids later, I&#39;m seeing my so-called &quot;sheltered&quot;,<br/>
homeschooled children put other neighbourhood and schooled children to<br/>
shame with their socialization skills.  And MY children were often the<br/>
shy ones at gatherings over the years.  We&#39;ve never even utilized<br/>
babysitters. <br/>
<br/>
Trust your instincts as a mother and feel confident that you can stand<br/>
up to the misguided scrutiny of others.  Some day you will be rewarded<br/>
for your courage to be different!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157428257">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i think this whole concern with/pressure to socialize kids at younger<br/>
and younger ages, is society&#39;s way of rationalizing &#39;our&#39; new social<br/>
trend to institutionalize our kids (and ultimately our society).  we&#39;ve<br/>
handed most everything we have over to others - i.e. the government.<br/>
everyone, except the primary parent, is the expert (e.g.. the portrayal,<br/>
on tv, of mothers, who are knowledgeable about their children&#39;s medical<br/>
condition, as having munchausen&#39;s syndrome).<br/>
<br/>
we, personally, are continually questioned (or ignored), by our family<br/>
and friends, about why we don&#39;t take rene&#39; to storytime, classes, play<br/>
dates etc.  when i first got sick (rene&#39; was 20 months) both my folks<br/>
and my dh&#39;s, offered us $$ to put rene&#39; in daycare but would not offer<br/>
$$ to have someone come in and help with other thing so i could focus my<br/>
attention and energy on him.  it was so odd to me that they felt<br/>
completely comfortable breaking up the family but couldn&#39;t image a way<br/>
to help and keep the family intact.<br/>
<br/>
in the book magic child  by pearce the idea to expose/expecte that a<br/>
child be socialized, prior to the age of 7, is detrimental and detracts<br/>
from the natural bonding which builds a strong foundation for later<br/>
growth and development.  that, until the age of 7, children really only<br/>
need their family and the natural environment to bond with and that they<br/>
will spontaneously and easily become &#39;socialized&#39; with their peers, if<br/>
they have bonded with their family and the immediate world around them<br/>
first.  there is a natural and necessary process which unfolds and<br/>
should not be rushed. ( another good book is the hurried child by<br/>
elkind)<br/>
<br/>
in my opinion  this &#39;fad&#39; of early socialization has an immediate<br/>
negative effect of over stimulation and challenges (at best) the<br/>
parent/child relationship.  i think someone said, in an prior discussion<br/>
of early socialization on this list,  something to the effect that they<br/>
stopped having problems once they quitting doing it:)  i honestly<br/>
believe over stimulation at an early age is a problem because kids need<br/>
quiet and time for self-discovery and don&#39;t need all the noisy and<br/>
demands for conformity from the outside world interfering with this.<br/>
<br/>
we take rene&#39; to park days once a week and started this at the age of<br/>
4.  prior to this we ran errands and went to the park when we felt like<br/>
it (a kind of consensus).  we didn&#39;t force anything, just got to know<br/>
each other and messed around at home - lived the quiet life.  people<br/>
made comments and openly expressed their doubts but we just did what<br/>
came natural.  we were not and are impervious to the doubts of others<br/>
but we make a conscious and concerted effort to recognize it&#39;s<br/>
disparaging effects and &#39;stop them in their tracts&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
my overall advise would be - relax and be yourself and don&#39;t hurry it<br/>
along.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Yes--not having anyone who can relate to what you want to do IS such<br/>
&gt;&gt; a<br/>
&gt;&gt; difficulty...<br/>
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE here sends their kids to school, and I have yet to find a<br/>
&gt;&gt; support<br/>
&gt;&gt; group in my area....most of the people I find out about are a good 1<br/>
&gt;&gt; hr<br/>
&gt;&gt; away..kind of hard to cultivate a relationship with a stranger that<br/>
&gt;&gt; way...<br/>
&gt;&gt; There is a group that  does activities ect, but everything is for<br/>
&gt;&gt; the older<br/>
&gt;&gt; ages...nothing for little ones really..<br/>
&gt;&gt; So this list is my support group...although not much interaction for<br/>
&gt;&gt; my<br/>
&gt;&gt; child...<br/>
&gt;&gt; Altleast we have each other !!!  Just knowing that I&#39;m not alone in<br/>
&gt;&gt; my<br/>
&gt;&gt; feelings certainly does ALOT for me...<br/>

I can relate to your concerns.  My oldest is turning 3 in a few days and <br/>
does not play with other children probably 90% of the time!  He is also in a <br/>
music program (which he has gone to for a year!) that he will only <br/>
participate maybe 10% of the time!!!! But guess what?  He comes home and in <br/>
the privacy of his own room sings every song and does every action!!!!  He <br/>
is just one of those people who will need time to soak everything up first <br/>
before he makes a move.  This is good for his teenage years I&#39;d say!  He <br/>
will (hopefully) always think things through thoroughly before deciding to <br/>
do something!  I often fight with myself on the issues of should I put him <br/>
into more activities...everyone else&#39;s child is in preschool...is he ever <br/>
going to get along well with others....what did I do wrong in the beginning, <br/>
etc.  I am so glad to have found someone else who relates to me!  Hang in <br/>
there! Are you also having trouble hooking up with others that have young <br/>
children who plan to homeschool/unschool?  I am!  Feeling very isolated!!!!<br/>

&gt;Hi Eileen!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am TOTALLY new at this cyber communication gig, having just signed-up<br/>
&gt;last night, so here is my first attempt at soap-boxing!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am writing to tell you your 3 year old child sounds TOTALLY normal.<br/>
&gt;There could be several explanations for his lack of interest in other<br/>
&gt;children just now.  And kids grow and change so exceptionally quickly,<br/>
&gt;bare in mind he could be a totally different child in 6-12 months.  His<br/>
&gt;lack of interest in others would be apparent even if -as you put it- you<br/>
&gt;were like every other conforming parent and had him in<br/>
&gt;preschool/daycare.  Perhaps he is just naturally shy.  That&#39;s his right<br/>
&gt;and his temperment is his own.  Look how many of us adults struggle in<br/>
&gt;social situations?  Not all of us are confident regarding large parties,<br/>
&gt;public speaking, travel, you name it.  Why aren&#39;t our children allowed<br/>
&gt;the same privelege?  I am constantly annoyed with &quot;bullies&quot; who demand<br/>
&gt;all children should behave in a prescribed way and if the children<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t, a judgemental finger is always wagging at the parents.<br/>
&gt;Especially if you&#39;re home/un-schooling.  Aside from normal shyness,<br/>
&gt;(which almost EVERY child experiences in one form or another; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;nature&#39;s way of protecting our children from potentially unnerving<br/>
&gt;situations) let us not forget that this child is still only a toddler,<br/>
&gt;an infant really in terms of an entire lifespan, and it&#39;s normal for<br/>
&gt;children to simply lack the maturity at that age to comfortably conduct<br/>
&gt;themselves around strangers.  Again, he could be a totally different<br/>
&gt;personality in a year.  He&#39;s just not interested and/or ready yet.<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s no reflection on you or homeschooling.  If anything it shows he<br/>
&gt;is firm about his attachment to you and he doesn&#39;t need outsiders to<br/>
&gt;meet his needs.  In the future, his attachment/security/relationship<br/>
&gt;with you will only contribute to his &quot;socialization&quot; in a positive way.<br/>
&gt;Maybe he&#39;s just a very good judge of character and hasn&#39;t met anyone who<br/>
&gt;measures up yet!  For the first 6 years and beyond every parenting book<br/>
&gt;worth its salt, recognizes that the mother-child bond is THE most<br/>
&gt;important relationship to cultivate.  He will get to know the rest of<br/>
&gt;the world after the security you two have is firmly established. Forget<br/>
&gt;the so-called &quot;norms&quot; for social development.  Don&#39;t push your child<br/>
&gt;into stressful situations with strangers, it will only complicate the<br/>
&gt;issue.  Embrace this time that he is still all your own, because when<br/>
&gt;things change with him you will miss the fact that you&#39;ve lost your<br/>
&gt;baby!  I was very shy and somewhat of a loner most of my childhood and<br/>
&gt;to this day I think I handle social situations much more successfully,<br/>
&gt;courteously and sensitively than most of my compatriates.  And I now<br/>
&gt;know literally hundreds of acquaintances through my various volunteer<br/>
&gt;organizations and interests.  We have to come up with a new definition<br/>
&gt;of &quot;socialization&quot; because I don&#39;t like what it represents according to<br/>
&gt;others&#39; definition.  3 kids later, I&#39;m seeing my so-called &quot;sheltered&quot;,<br/>
&gt;homeschooled children put other neighbourhood and schooled children to<br/>
&gt;shame with their socialization skills.  And MY children were often the<br/>
&gt;shy ones at gatherings over the years.  We&#39;ve never even utilized<br/>
&gt;babysitters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Trust your instincts as a mother and feel confident that you can stand<br/>
&gt;up to the misguided scrutiny of others.  Some day you will be rewarded<br/>
&gt;for your courage to be different!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; OK here goes.. I posted earlier, but it got lost in the system, if<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is a second, please accept my apologies..<br/>
&gt; &gt; This goes out to anyone who can help me get over myself, about being<br/>
&gt; &gt; worried my son (3yo) will not know how to play nicely with other<br/>
&gt; &gt; children..<br/>
&gt; &gt; I totally believe in the ability of unschooling my child, but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; only place that I find myself lacking in confidence is with his<br/>
&gt; &gt; ability to be around other kids..I truely believe that he has no<br/>
&gt; &gt; interest in playing with others about 80% of the time...And being<br/>
&gt; &gt; that he is only 3, I am afraid that he will isolate himself...<br/>
&gt; &gt; We are enrolled in a gym class with other 3/4 yo, which he<br/>
&gt; &gt; participates in only 50% of the time...And I have found a moms/tots<br/>
&gt; &gt; class that he actually liked for a month, but now will not go??!!??<br/>
&gt; &gt; I understand that socialization is so much more than what people<br/>
&gt; &gt; profess it to be....but at some point he needs to see that there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; other children out there who could be fun to play with, right?  So<br/>
&gt; &gt; how to I stop feeling responsible for him not wanting to<br/>
&gt; &gt; participate???  If I was like all the other moms around here, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; already have him in preschool ect ect ect.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Eileen<br/>

Yes--not having anyone who can relate to what you want to do IS such a <br/>
difficulty...<br/>
EVERYONE here sends their kids to school, and I have yet to find a support <br/>
group in my area....most of the people I find out about are a good 1 hr <br/>
away..kind of hard to cultivate a relationship with a stranger that way...<br/>
There is a group that  does activities ect, but everything is for the older <br/>
ages...nothing for little ones really..<br/>
So this list is my support group...although not much interaction for my <br/>
child...<br/>
Altleast we have each other !!!  Just knowing that I&#39;m not alone in my <br/>
feelings certainly does ALOT for me...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700690927">I went through this when my kids were very little.  The group here was<br/>
all older.  But yearly the dynamics of a group changes.  Younger kids<br/>
come in, and older ones drift away.  Keep in touch with that group.  Now<br/>
our group is mostly young kids.<br/>
Now that I look back, I didn&#39;t need a group when my kids were so young<br/>
anyway.  They really didn&#39;t need much interaction until about 4.  So<br/>
enjoy your peace and quite with your little ones, and don&#39;t feel<br/>
guilty.  They are very happy with you.  There will be plenty of time<br/>
later for overfilling your calendar with events.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528326107">My daughter is now almost 4 years old and when she was a little toddler<br/>
she HATED going to playgroups that weren&#39;t in the park.  She&#39;s basically<br/>
an introverted personality type (per: Raising Your Spirited Child), but<br/>
she&#39;s very, very energetic and has a mind of her own (really, really). She<br/>
was not very social, although she seemed to like other kids and adults,<br/>
she didn&#39;t like a lot of them around.  So we stopped hanging around with<br/>
our playgroups (very, very hard on extroverted me) and she was happier.  <br/>
Now at 4 she loves talking to people and she expresses herself very well.  <br/>
If i&#39;m around she&#39;ll talk to almost anyone interesting and almost always<br/>
to other kids (its very funny to watch her run up to kids she doesn&#39;t know<br/>
in the park and say, &quot;Hi, my name&#39;s Athena.  What&#39;s your&#39;s?&quot;  -- this from<br/>
a toddler who hated strangers, yelled in terror whenever someone she<br/>
didn&#39;t know said hi, etc.)  I have two points: one, is that kids get there<br/>
eventually.  Like a lot of people have mentioned, socialization is all in<br/>
their individual growth pattern (like walking, reading, etc.) and two, we,<br/>
as a culture know very little about how babies and toddlers naturally are.  <br/>
Until we have them ourselves, we have no idea what&#39;s within normal range<br/>
for the behavior of toddlers.  I was amazed at how hard it was to take<br/>
care of a baby and then I nearly fainted when I realized how hard my<br/>
toddler was going to be!  <br/>
<br/>
One more thing: take a bath with your toddler, if you can.  It takes care<br/>
of two things at once (you get clean, she gets clean) and there&#39;s no<br/>
screaming (usually!)  I also found water to be very soothing for my little<br/>
spirited one.  There were days when we took up to 4 baths!<br/>
