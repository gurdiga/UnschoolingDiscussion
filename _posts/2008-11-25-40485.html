<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397168003">It sent David and I down a long conversation back to the moment when we decided to give Simon and Linnaea the right to choose their own foods. It was a conversation about knowing that humans are biologically driven to seek out sugars and fats because that was what they sought out in the EEA (Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness, a jargon rich term from university meaning the time before humans became growers and storers of grain). It was a conversation about giving it a go and relaxing into that fear and moving from the need to protect a child from themselves to a point of helping them to embrace their choices. <br/>

I was going with it though.  I figured that was probably the case, even<br/>
though, upon my initial reading, it sounded like a conversation you had<br/>
yesterday!  I knew you before yesterday, though, so I pretty much<br/>
