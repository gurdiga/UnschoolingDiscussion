I&#39;m not Kelly... but we picked up a book at Barnes and Noble the <br/>
other day, <br/>
The Book of Wizard Craft by Janice Eaton Kilby et al. It has many <br/>
different <br/>
crafts like that in it. Making a hat, a turban, wand, cloak, robes <br/>
etc etc. <br/>
Looks really easy and only basic sewing skills needed. Gives <br/>
directions and how <br/>
to take measurements, how much material would be needed etc. We are <br/>
going to <br/>
make the robe and cloak to start with.<br/>

Thanks for the book suggestion Pam!!!! We ordered it from the library <br/>
today. The author also has written a book on Wizard Parties which we <br/>
ordered as well. We can&#39;t wait til they come in!!! <br/>
                    Thanks again!!!<br/>

much fun.  We are working on robes today and tomorrow they want cloaks.  Also <br/>
want to make a wand and other things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Duncan&#39;s ready for a wizard&#39;s party. Maybe early August (if I&#39;m not fried <br/>
yet!). Two years ao he had a Harry Potter birthday party (so we&#39;ve already done <br/>
one), but this time he has THE perfect costume. I&#39;ll call you, Pam! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know where I can find a Gryffindor badge (fabric, that goes on the <br/>
chest of the robe)?<br/>

We&#39;ve come across lots of Gryffindor patches on eBay (just search on Gryffindor patch).  My daughter has been determinedly collecting items for her Gryffindor outfit ... robe, wand, scarf, shirt, skirt, Bertie Botts Everyflavour Beans, stuffed owl etc. for a few months now.  She came across an old clotheshorse when we cleaned out for a garage sale and sets the whole thing up on it when she&#39;s not wearing it.  The only thing left is a tie!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Found &#39;em---lots. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
As for ties: try men&#39;s consignment shops---the best ones are the really thin <br/>
ones! My mother used to make ties---so I know that&#39;s possible. The fabric is <br/>
fairly common.<br/>
<br/>
And we have a GREAT owl. She&#39;s white (a snowy!) with a hole up her butt! You <br/>
can put your hand in and turn her head! I hear she was a big hit at the HP5 <br/>
party two weeks ago. My dad found her three-four years ago just after book two <br/>
came out. Don&#39;t know where though.<br/>
