&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHOM TO MARRY?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should keep<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;chips and dip coming. - Alan, age 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;HOW CAN A STRANGER TELL IF TWO PEOPLE ARE MARRIED?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;You might have to guess, based on whether they seem to be yelling at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;same kids. - Derrick, age 8<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM AND DAD HAVE IN COMMON?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Both don&#39;t want any more kids. - Lori, age 8<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Dates are for having fun, and people should use them to get to know<br/>
each<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;other. Even boys have something to say if you listen long enough. -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Lynnette, age 8<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;When they&#39;re rich. - Pam, age 7<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;It&#39;s better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need someone<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;clean up after them. - Anita, age 9<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;HOW WOULD THE WORLD BE DIFFERENT IF PEOPLE DIDN&#39;T GET MARRIED?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;There sure would be a lot of kids to explain, wouldn&#39;t there? - Kelvin,<br/>
&gt; age<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;8<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;HOW WOULD YOU MAKE A MARRIAGE WORK?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Tell your wife that she looks pretty even if she looks like a truck.-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Ricky, age 10<br/>
