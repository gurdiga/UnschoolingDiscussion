 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how old your son is, but I can tell you how I handle testing the <br/>
high school homeschoolers I work with.  (These are homeschoolers, not <br/>
unschoolers, but they are still often freaked by tests.)  I encourage them <br/>
(and their parents) to think of testing as a separate skill rather than a <br/>
reflection of intelligence or even how much they know about a subject.  <br/>
Although we all know that tests are a poor indicator of learning, etc. the <br/>
rest of the world hasn&#39;t figured this out and everyone will have to take <br/>
tests sometime.  I tell my students I would rather they learn their test <br/>
taking skills early on before they get to tests that really matter -- like <br/>
the SAT or ACT.  Or even a driver&#39;s test.  I think this has a couple of <br/>
advantages.  First, it allows them to examine their test-taking skills, which <br/>
are completely separate from how well they know the material being tested on. <br/>
 Second, if they don&#39;t do well they just think, &quot;I don&#39;t take tests well&quot; <br/>
rather than &quot;I can&#39;t do math&quot; or even &quot;I&#39;m not smart enough.&quot;  Also, if they <br/>
approach the test just thinking of it as a test rather than an assessment of <br/>
them in some larger way, they&#39;re usually calmer and I find calmness is the <br/>
first step to testing well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139579462">I think that I&#39;m going to approach testing with my son (seven next year) by<br/>
saying that in order to be able to stay home this is something we have to do.<br/>
I plan on buying a standardized test and doing it with him, and then just having<br/>
it in my files.<br/>
In NC, you just have to have it in case anyone asks for it.<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of anyone being asked EVER!<br/>
