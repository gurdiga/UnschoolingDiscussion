&lt;&lt; Being a sort of newbie I just had to share this tidbit for other<br/>
<br/>
newbies out there.<br/>
<br/>
DS 14 and 10 decided to make level 60 characters in D & D just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
(This gives them practically god-like ablilies. Quite cool!)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very cool story.  I&#39;ll send it to my boys.<br/>
<br/>
Last Saturday they had a very interesting experience at their Saturday night <br/>
D&D game.  Their DM/leader had decided to switch games to some new <br/>
post-apocalyptic game.<br/>
<br/>
I was still up when they got in 1:30 a.m. or so, and I&#39;m glad because I got <br/>
the immediate debrief.<br/>
<br/>
I was impressed (side story) that neither of them ever got impatient with the <br/>
other for interrupting as this story came tumbling out.  Several times one <br/>
would take over or clarify or back up and the other would let him go until <br/>
the need to clarify or back up.  <br/>
<br/>
So out poured this:<br/>
<br/>
Each person was to be playing himself.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So did you roll stats?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And both the boys&#39; eyes just sparkled and they said &quot;NO! We used our real <br/>
stats!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I settled in for a story.<br/>
<br/>
The method was for everyone to state what the individual had as to dexterity, <br/>
intelligence, charisma, etc. and they negotiated an agreeable stat for each.  <br/>
15 was the limit, and nobody was to be below average, which they set at 8.  <br/>
So 8 was the lowest and 15 was the highest.<br/>
<br/>
I asked if anyone got a 15 charisma.  Kirby smirked and pointed to himself <br/>
with two thumbs.<br/>
<br/>
What about strength?  I looked at Marty.  They had given him a thirteen, <br/>
which he thought was fine.  I had guessed him as the strongest of those I <br/>
knew.  <br/>
<br/>
But their main good story was intelligence.  When it came time to decide <br/>
intelligence on everybody, their host (a school-boy I know well) said &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t want to say anything about homeschooling, but...&quot;   and when they told <br/>
me I laughed and said &quot;But he just did!&quot; and they nodded and said, &quot;Yeah, we <br/>
know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So in his summary of what intelligence was, it was clarified that <br/>
intelligence was knowing things like chemistry and science.   I rared back my <br/>
head and said &quot;That&#39;s knowledge.  Intelligence is how easily you can learn <br/>
things.&quot;  Both Kirby and Marty nodded quickly and gave the eye look and head <br/>
not that means, &quot;OH yeah, we know that, but Eric and the rest of them don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eric did say as consolation to Kirby and Marty while telling them they were <br/>
intelligence-impaired, that they did both have the most common sense of the <br/>
people in that group.<br/>
<br/>
So Kirby was granted a 13 intelligence, and Marty a 12, I believe.  Not bad <br/>
under the prejudicial circumstances. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty had gotten a 13 charisma too.  Not Kirby&#39;s 15, because Marty is loud <br/>
and obnoxious sometimes.  Cruder humor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Closest they&#39;ve ever had to report cards.  And the summations came from kids <br/>
who had spent many hours with them in close social, linguistic and logical <br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
There were about twelve of the sometimes fifteen there.  Two other longtime <br/>
homeschoolers weren&#39;t there.  One who was there homeschooled from about <br/>
12-15, and now is taking some low-level college stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Of the two who weren&#39;t there, one is full-time in college, a sophomore.  So <br/>
they probaby would have given her a 15 on intelligence.  Not that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
deserve it, but they would have looked at college GPA and gone straight with <br/>
that.   The other works full time and can think circles around my kids, but <br/>
he&#39;s a cowboy kid with less social status than some of them (in their eyes) <br/>
and so that will probably prejudice their decision when he shows up for the <br/>
post-apocalyptic doings.<br/>
<br/>
I was fascinated and amused.<br/>
