<div id="ygrps-yiv-941285739">Shannon, you might check out a local museum for a constellation map.  Our <br/>
museum has an observatory for stargazing.  Also, check with your library.  <br/>
They might know of a way to acquire one.  And lastly, check a teacher supply <br/>
store.  They probably would have something you could use.  Good luck!           <br/>
