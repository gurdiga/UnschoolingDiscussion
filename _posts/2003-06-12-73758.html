<div id="ygrps-yiv-350306015">Reminds me of a story. (I&#39;m starting to feel like Sophia) Picture <br/>
this, one<br/>
of those birthing stories on cable. The mom was having the baby at <br/>
home and<br/>
the older brother was there to see the new baby come into the world. <br/>
The<br/>
little boy was about 4. Well mom was screaming up a storm and scared <br/>
the<br/>
crap out of the little kid. They finally get him calmed down and she <br/>
quiets<br/>
up when you could see the baby&#39;s head. So they get the little boy to <br/>
come<br/>
and see the baby and all he sees is a full head of wet black hair <br/>
(fur?) and<br/>
screams with such excitement for the first time in hours that mom is <br/>
having<br/>
a puppy!!!!! Poor little thing must have been disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
LMAO..good one Mary!  It reminded me of a birth story I watched on <br/>
The Baby Story.  There was this older couple having their first baby <br/>
and they were a bit eccentric.  They videotaped EVERYTHING.  She even <br/>
had the camera set up for when she read her pregnancy test.  They <br/>
were having a natural birth and were totally into the filming and no <br/>
drugs, etc.  No big deal but man once she went into labor it went <br/>
crazy!  She is screaming about the pain, completely out of control <br/>
where she is completely freaking out the husband.  They finally move <br/>
her into the birthing room and she starts pushing.  She is <br/>
frantcially yelling so bad that she has the nurse starting to firmly <br/>
calm her down and the husband it starting to look completely <br/>
frazzled.  The baby is just ready to be born, head almost out and the <br/>
nurse sees the dad looking a bit funny so she tells him to sit down.  <br/>
She turns around, he faints, the baby comes out, the nurse is running <br/>
between him and the doctor, LMAO.  It was like a skit from Mad TV.  <br/>
He gets up a few sconds later and the baby is out and to top it all <br/>
off his glasses are all askew.  It was like a comedy of errors.  That <br/>
is one birthing video I would hide in the closet, lol!  I think what <br/>
made it so funny was the before attitude and the actual event.  This <br/>
is definitly NOT one video to show at Lamaze for first time moms :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Olga, thanks for sharing that!!  I laughed my butt off!!  I can picture it <br/>
all.....<br/>
<br/>
After some hesitation, I&#39;m going to tell you my sister in law&#39;s friends&#39; <br/>
funny birth story...a bit tasteless though, so delete if you don&#39;t have a <br/>
disgusting sense of humor....<br/>
<br/>
Same thing, my sister in law&#39;s best friend is pregnant...videotaped <br/>
everything, acted like she was the first person on earth to be pregnant and have a <br/>
child.  What&#39;s funny though is her husband was much more laid back, happy, but not <br/>
crazy into it. <br/>
<br/>
Well, she&#39;s in labor forever, and they finally give her an epidural (sp), <br/>
still in labor for a long time.  They take her to the delivery room and she <br/>
begins pushing.  For a long time...finally she pushes really hard (as husband looks <br/>
on) and feels something come out and a little relief and thinking she gave <br/>
birth says, &quot;What is it!!  What is it!!??&quot; and her husband chuckles and says, &quot;A <br/>
piece of shit!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Oh, she was furious with him and sooooo embarrassed!!<br/>

birthing event all about him??? Not man-bashing mind you, but just today I was <br/>
talking to two girlfriends about my hospital crap these last two weeks and each <br/>
time, somehow between the recovery room and getting home the focus somehow <br/>
goes from my health to my DH&#39;s world being disturbed. Cracks me up everytime. And <br/>
when we got pregnant with Kass and Kree he walked around all stud like, <br/>
because he had strong sperm that split the egg in two. WRONG!!! LMAO when the OB <br/>
told us they were definately fraternal and he just had two really lucky sperm. <br/>
So I walked out the stud and he just had lucky swimmers!!! <br/>
