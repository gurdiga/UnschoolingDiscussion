&gt; probably get this channel.  I imagine you might be able to get the series<br/>

&gt; To mark the 25th anniversary of its airing, the Hallmark Channel will be<br/>
&gt; broadcasting the miniseries &quot;Roots&quot; from January 20th to 25th at 9:00 PM.<br/>
&gt; It will also run in its entirety on January 26th from noon until midnight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Author Alex Haley traced his family tree back to Africa and a young man<br/>
&gt; who was brought to this country as a slave.  This study guide contains<br/>
&gt; lessons that &quot;give your students the tools to begin to research and write<br/>
&gt; about their genealogical history. It is an opportunity for them to learn<br/>
&gt; about the people who came before them. The students will collect<br/>
&gt; information about their family history, then they will create a family<br/>
&gt; tree with the information they have collected, and then they will write a<br/>
&gt; story.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [MOD:  The study guide is in pdf format, and is, according to the site,<br/>
&gt; &quot;designed to help Middle and High School teachers&quot;.  --mdb]<br/>
