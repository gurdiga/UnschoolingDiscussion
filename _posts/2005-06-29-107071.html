<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321267580">Sorry I just posted a question and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve introduced <br/>
myself yet.  Been lurking for months and I guess I just forgot I <br/>
hadn&#39;t done that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Terri.  Been married 12 years.  We have 7yod and 11yos.  Ds loves <br/>
Star Wars Lego computer game, climbing trees, magic tricks of all <br/>
kinds, friends to play with, going barefoot and building with Legos.  <br/>
Dd loves to paint and draw, playing with dolls, Polly Pockets, and <br/>
horses, and listening to Kim Possible cd.  She also loves to write <br/>
encouraging notes to everybody and mail them all over the place <br/>
(after she has me write it so she can copy it in her own handwriting).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always homeschooled.  I&#39;ve always been relaxed, but began to be <br/>
frustrated trying to make ds (who does not like to read even though <br/>
he can well) do the little bit of school-type work we were doing.  <br/>
Back in Dec. I remembered unschooling and I started my big research <br/>
project that is ongoing.  I&#39;m convinced 100%, dh maybe 70%.  I&#39;m <br/>
still working on him. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been greatly encouraged and I have learned so much here already.<br/>

Some guys like that.   (The quotes are John Holt, anyway, and the rest is Deb <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70730482">Hi I haven&#39;t posted in awhile,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about what I can or should be doing about this:<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 1 and 3.  My 3-year-old is very spirited.  Let me first say that I truly believe in abiding by the natural rhythms of my children.  I&#39;m finding it hard to balance this at night when my dd is cranky, but refusing to go to bed when she&#39;s tired.  I have tried in the past to get her to bed and she just won&#39;t sleep. She continually pops up and won&#39;t stay in the bed.  She says that she wants mommy or daddy with her.  If we do lay down with her at the earlier time, she tosses and turns and won&#39;t sleep even though she is very tired.  This is hard because I only have so long with her to lay down because I have to go to DS too.  So we usually just have her come out and lay on the couch where daddy is watching very loud tv and of course she won&#39;t go to sleep, even though we can see that she is exhausted.  The problem is that DH refuses to lie down with her in the family bed at an &quot;early&quot;  (to him) time because he doesn&#39;t want to fall asleep and he wants to stay up later.  I wish<br/>
 that I could just have her play quietly in her room, but she is afraid to be alone in there. I feel torn too because I have a very awake 1 year-old to take care of as well.  He too only wants mommy at night.  DH hates to have him crying in his ear when I go lay down with Lindsay.  Also, DS is a night owl. Is there anyway to get them on the same sleep rhythm?  Or is DS just too young still?  And since they are two totally different kids this probably will never happen, right?  We (dh and I) read stories to DD and try to promote calm, although I must say that DH continues to watch loud t.v. that effects all of us.  DH is unwilling to turn tv off to promote calm when we are trying to wind down.  The bedrooms in our house are very small so the rocking chair is in the playroom where our only tv is.  DD usually ends up going to bed with DH when she probably should have went (because of tiredness) about two hours before.  I feel this is wrong and not respecting her body&#39;s needs because she<br/>
 is obviously tired.  She has a tendency to wake up cranky in the morning too.<br/>
<br/>
I also feel that we are at a loss for having any couple time to talk at night and since we do the family bed also, we are never alone to talk.  On top of it, at night we have a very tired DD screaming at us.  I know that this will pass and is very fleeting.  I&#39;m just afraid this arrangement is not working for us and is really taking its toll on our marriage.  I tend to get angry that DH won&#39;t help with the kids more and he&#39;s exhausted from working all day (11 1/2 hrs) and doesn&#39;t really want to help.  When I do ask him for help and he does it, he seems very resentful  We are BOTH just exhausted.  We do have my mom watch the kids on occasion so that we can have couple time, but quite frankly this does not seem like enough time to have good communication in our marriage.  Our marriage is definitely suffering and I don&#39;t know what to do about gaining more ways for us to find time for each other.  Any suggestions/advice would be appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
When my son is obviously tired but wired &lt;g&gt;, it usually means he<br/>
needs some sensory help, as in the stuff often recommended in the<br/>
book, The Out-of-Sync Child.  Hard rocking, hard massage, squeezing,<br/>
or (that famous solution -- it works for us) a drive in the car.  I<br/>
believe the theory is that some kids have trouble sensing their own<br/>
body&#39;s needs, like the need for sleep, and some of this sensory<br/>
stimulation helps their body get re-organized and sense those things<br/>
again.  Doing this kind of stuff earlier in the day may help, too, as<br/>
well as other sensory things like wrapping her up like a taco,<br/>
brushing her skin, making sure she gets to swing or jump (trampoline<br/>
or couch cushions &lt;G&gt;), and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Also, is she getting plenty of natural light during the day, and then<br/>
are you keeping the lights low so that the house naturally gets dark<br/>
as the sun sets?  Use those bio-rhythms. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as your husband, would he be open to watching the TV using<br/>
headphones, to cut down on the sound for everyone else?<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas off the top of my head.  I hope this gets better soon.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062500383">Hi, Karri<br/>
<br/>
I have a 4 yr old boy. I&#39;ve allowed him to fall asleep on the couch <br/>
as well. Too get him to brush his teeth, I start a race to the <br/>
bathroom(works every time), after brushing, he grabs his pillow and <br/>
cover and heads to the couch. I then lower the lights, lower the <br/>
volume on the tv and sometimes switch the channel to something that <br/>
is not action packed(travel channels work for me). And, usually <br/>
within 20-30min he is asleep and I can move him to his room. Also, <br/>
having a routine is key in this area, ex. my JJ knows that after <br/>
brushing he gets his pillow, lights go off and so on. And, it&#39;s not <br/>
going to work in a snap, give her time to get used to the new <br/>
routine.<br/>
<br/>
Also, make sure that she is getting enough sleep, my son is usually <br/>
cranky/whiny the next day if he doesn&#39;t get enough sleep the night <br/>
before. As far as having time to talk to hubby, we&#39;ve used the <br/>
telephone to our advantage in my home because my dh somtimes leaves <br/>
when I get in and comes in when I&#39;m sleeping, so the next morning, <br/>
we talk via phone, email or instant messenger. Also getting your dd <br/>
to go to sleep earlier so that you can have time to yourself and for <br/>
hubby might also help at night.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627954524">Hi Karri, <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you could get a set of headphones for dh to use that might help<br/>
keep things quiet during the going to sleep time.  If he would agree to shut<br/>
off lights and come to kiss Lindsey goodnight then it would seem to her as<br/>
if everything is dark and winding down.  Then he could return to the TV<br/>
using headphones in the other room.  It&#39;s not an answer for the deeper<br/>
issues, but maybe just addressing the noise issue first would help you all<br/>
get past the harried frustrating part and clear your head to think of more<br/>
solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I just thought of something we used to do with Trayton when he was<br/>
sleepy.  Dark, quiet, lying next to him, I would ask him to put his head on<br/>
the pillow and then I would breath long, slow, audible breaths next to him.<br/>
He would eventually slow his breathing to match mine and fall asleep.  Anika<br/>
and Sydney both drop off when I read chapter books (preferably without<br/>
pictures).  And one last thing.  I used to always try to help Sydney go to<br/>
bed while Anika was nursing.  When it looked like she was going to be hungry<br/>
in the evening, I&#39;d turn off all the lights in the house and retreat to a<br/>
quiet spot (her bed or mine or the couch ) and do the aforementioned<br/>
routines.  That way the baby was sure to be quiet.  A lot of the time I fell<br/>
asleep with them. (modeling?)  ;)<br/>
<br/>
So much for evening couple time.  Oh well, we had periods of not enough.<br/>
But mornings were sometimes better than evenings for that anyway.<br/>

<br/>
Hi I haven&#39;t posted in awhile,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about what I can or should be doing about this:<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 1 and 3.  My 3-year-old is very spirited.  Let me first say that<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids are 1, 3, 7 and 9.<br/>
<br/>
We all go to bed together, at least the 1yo and 3yo often go to bed at the<br/>
same time and in the same place. Sometimes the older two are watching TV or<br/>
doing something else on their own. Occasionally, the 3yo, who doesn&#39;t<br/>
usually take naps except in the car, goes to sleep while watching TV or<br/>
she&#39;ll just go into the bedroom and before I know it she&#39;s asleep. I read at<br/>
night as well, if it works (sometimes the 1-year-old will be too grabby with<br/>
the book). Oftentimes I&#39;m nursing him while I read. Sometimes the kids ask<br/>
for a story with no book. The 3yo invariably wants &quot;Goldilocks,&quot; complete<br/>
with goofy voices, but the older children like family stories about my<br/>
childhood or their babyhoods or dh&#39;s and my courtship. I think it&#39;s hard on<br/>
3yos when they see the littlest one getting exclusive mommy attention. My<br/>
husband does very well with the kids, but the little ones have always seemed<br/>
to need *me* during bedtime. It has made things easier (and I think is<br/>
kinder) to just go with that. It helps the 3yo to fall asleep in my bed.<br/>
Then, I move her in with the 9yo, who is in a double bed in the same room,<br/>
because she moves around a lot and wakes up the baby.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that the way the culture presents children going to bed is just<br/>
unrealistic. You know, mom puts the kid in bed, reads a story and says,<br/>
&quot;Good night,&quot; and then turns off the life and leaves. All my kids really<br/>
like my presence while they&#39;re going to bed. Esp. when they&#39;re toddlers. The<br/>
older ones will say they&#39;re tired and can go off and go to sleep on their<br/>
own, but they prefer it if I come in with them for at least a bit. And I<br/>
usually do it. I think it&#39;s a nice way to connect with them, esp. as they&#39;ve<br/>
gotten older and are doing more running around in the neighborhood and the<br/>
oldest goes to camps and activities without me.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also in a not-ideal housing situation right now. My landlady lives<br/>
next door, separate from us only by some drywall. She gets up around 5 for<br/>
work, and she has complained about toddler feet running around. (Yes, we are<br/>
getting out of this situation.) Because of this, though, our house has<br/>
&quot;quiet hours&quot; like a college dorm or something. I&#39;m not thrilled about the<br/>
situation, but it&#39;s something we have to deal with right now. There have<br/>
been some good things about it, however. I&#39;m just not the &quot;schedule&quot; type,<br/>
but the routine has been comforting for the 3yo in particular.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t fight over bedtime. Things I&#39;ve done to help get them ready for bed<br/>
is make sure that they do get a lot of active play during the day. The 3yo<br/>
really does better we&#39;ve gone on walks or to the park and she&#39;s gotten some<br/>
time to run around.<br/>
<br/>
I know there were other issues involving your dh, but I wanted to focus on<br/>
the things that seemed more in your control. :-(<br/>

assuming you were parenting her to bed but she still wasn&#39;t falling<br/>
asleep.  Dopey me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, at 3 and 1, a family bed situation could work really nicely for<br/>
you.  We have two mattresses pushed together on the floor, and a TV in<br/>
the bedroom, and books nearby.  Very nice for nursing, reading,<br/>
watching Baby Einstein or other gentle videos, and overall quiet<br/>
activities together as we all doze off.<br/>
<br/>
If we go to bed a little earlier, and the kids fall asleep a little<br/>
earlier, then I can extricate myself and crawl over to my husband&#39;s<br/>
side of the bed so we can chat quietly or, um, whatever. ;)  But we<br/>
kind of roll with the situation on that one.<br/>
<br/>
The problem I was describing in my earlier post is that my 2 year old<br/>
will nurse, lie there for a while, and then pop up and want to play,<br/>
roll over us, etc.  *That&#39;s* when I bring in the sensory stuff --<br/>
something to help him release the awake. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I feel better now that I&#39;ve clarified. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-487831445">Yes, even I have a hard time getting in touch with my own physical needs, especially sleep.  A drive in the car would end up taking an hour or two before she would fall asleep because she truly fights sleep even when she can barely keep her eyes open (sigh).  With gas prices, that is just not practical for us.  I honestly don&#39;t think that she would sit still long enough to give her a massage, lol.  Yeah, I need to definitely make sure she is able to run out her immense energy base on a daily basis.  Sometimes I think I lack in that category with a 1 year-old to take care of too.  It&#39;s tough trying to juggle both of their needs in a very respectful, loving way.  Thanks for the advice:-)  I liked the natural light and letting it get dark without lights in the house idea.  I will try that.<br/>

When my son is obviously tired but wired &lt;g&gt;, it usually means he<br/>
needs some sensory help, as in the stuff often recommended in the<br/>
book, The Out-of-Sync Child.  Hard rocking, hard massage, squeezing,<br/>
or (that famous solution -- it works for us) a drive in the car.  I<br/>
believe the theory is that some kids have trouble sensing their own<br/>
body&#39;s needs, like the need for sleep, and some of this sensory<br/>
stimulation helps their body get re-organized and sense those things<br/>
again.  Doing this kind of stuff earlier in the day may help, too, as<br/>
well as other sensory things like wrapping her up like a taco,<br/>
brushing her skin, making sure she gets to swing or jump (trampoline<br/>
or couch cushions &lt;G&gt;), and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Also, is she getting plenty of natural light during the day, and then<br/>
are you keeping the lights low so that the house naturally gets dark<br/>
as the sun sets?  Use those bio-rhythms. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as your husband, would he be open to watching the TV using<br/>
headphones, to cut down on the sound for everyone else?<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas off the top of my head.  I hope this gets better soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619552326">Yeah, the problem is DH won&#39;t turn down the volume that much and he is usually watching something that he wants to watch.  The funny thing is, if we turn it to one of her shows, she&#39;ll stay up even if she is really tired and watch.  We&#39;ve done that (a few times just to see how long it would take for her to fall asleep &quot;willingly&quot;).  She&#39;ll stay up exhausted until 3 a.m., if someone is with her and her shows are on.  She has a very hard time transitioning from awake to asleep.  She literally hates to sleep.  If we all go to bed, she goes because she does not want to be alone.  She is always told that she does not have to go to bed.  The thing is that I also need to have some alone time (let alone time with DH) and I usually take it after everyone is asleep.  I&#39;m a spirited adult and I have to work on oversensory overload and decompress from the events of the day.  My daughter is like this too.  It&#39;s just the way that I am and I need that to parent with a &quot;clear head.&quot; I&#39;m not getting<br/>
 a whole lot of help from DH to get that.  <br/>

Hi, Karri<br/>
<br/>
I have a 4 yr old boy. I&#39;ve allowed him to fall asleep on the couch <br/>
as well. Too get him to brush his teeth, I start a race to the <br/>
bathroom(works every time), after brushing, he grabs his pillow and <br/>
cover and heads to the couch. I then lower the lights, lower the <br/>
volume on the tv and sometimes switch the channel to something that <br/>
is not action packed(travel channels work for me). And, usually <br/>
within 20-30min he is asleep and I can move him to his room. Also, <br/>
having a routine is key in this area, ex. my JJ knows that after <br/>
brushing he gets his pillow, lights go off and so on. And, it&#39;s not <br/>
going to work in a snap, give her time to get used to the new <br/>
routine.<br/>
<br/>
Also, make sure that she is getting enough sleep, my son is usually <br/>
cranky/whiny the next day if he doesn&#39;t get enough sleep the night <br/>
before. As far as having time to talk to hubby, we&#39;ve used the <br/>
telephone to our advantage in my home because my dh somtimes leaves <br/>
when I get in and comes in when I&#39;m sleeping, so the next morning, <br/>
we talk via phone, email or instant messenger. Also getting your dd <br/>
to go to sleep earlier so that you can have time to yourself and for <br/>
hubby might also help at night.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

the breathing, reading and nursing ideas I like. DS sometimes doesn&#39;t nurse, if I&#39;m reading <br/>

over us, even in low light, lol. That&#39;s when I ask DH to help by taking him, but then DS will <br/>
just cry and DH comes in and says, &quot;he wants you.&quot; Usually, then I take the baby and he <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=============<br/>
Maybe &quot;always&quot; is too much, then.   <br/>
There are many things between &quot;You have to go to bed now because it&#39;s 8:00&quot; <br/>
and &quot;You don&#39;t have to go to bed at all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve made an argument against arbitrary bedtimes, it&#39;s been against <br/>
ARBITRARY bedtimes and the fear, frustration and arguments they cause.   If <br/>
bedtime is &quot;when everyone else is going to be&quot; or &quot;when we have to be quiet because <br/>
of the neighbors&quot; or &quot;when mom&#39;s too sleepy to stay up with you anymore (in <br/>
the case of younger children), that is not arbitrary.   That&#39;s for a real <br/>
reason, not just a rule that&#39;s not worth &quot;enforcing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people come to these discussions and their relationship with their <br/>
child is very indirect, because of arbitrary (and sometimes harmful) rules and <br/>
structures and punshments and of clinging to school-related or farm-related <br/>
ideas about when children SHOULD be up and SHOULD be asleep, or that children <br/>
SHOULD sleep in the dark in their own rooms, alone.    <br/>
<br/>
Examining those problems doesn&#39;t mean unschooling demands NO &quot;let&#39;s go to bed <br/>
now&quot;   and NO structure.    Reason and persuasion and logic are good things.  <br/>
 If a child needs to go to sleep because she&#39;s exhausted but resistent, tell <br/>
her she can see her shows the next day.   If a child needs to go to sleep <br/>
because there&#39;s an early morning outting or appointment, explain that, and find <br/>
ways to get her asleep.   Rock her, drive her, something.<br/>
<br/>
I used to put on a favorite cassette tape (CDs last even longer!) and say <br/>
&quot;Try to go to sleep, and if you&#39;re still awake when this ends, you can get back <br/>
up.    Maybe twice,   Marty outlasted a tape, but I wouldn&#39;t swear it was even <br/>
twice.   <br/>

Maybe record your husband&#39;s shows, and ask him to watch them later, after the <br/>
kids are asleep, or the next day, or the weekend, so that he&#39;s not stuck to <br/>
the TV while you&#39;re needing help with kids.   <br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t always be little.   It will be a shame if he misses their younger <br/>
years for TV shows he could watch later.   Taxi is on DVD now.   Mork and <br/>
Mindy.   &lt;g&gt;   Shows I thought I&#39;d die if I missed, when they were new, I can <br/>
watch every day.   But I don&#39;t! Hmmmm....<br/>
<br/>
My husband was always a Disney buff, so it was easy for him to watch a movie <br/>
with one of the kids.   He could watch The Jungle Book or Aladdin ANYtime.   <br/>
Maybe your husband could find movies he and the kids could watch together.   <br/>
Neverending Story is on DVD now.   That&#39;s a good one dads can like.   The <br/>
Princess Bride is easy to go to sleep to.   Willow.<br/>

she wakes up refreshed, you can say, &quot;Oooh, that was a good rest, <br/>
wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Help her recognize that she feels so GOOD after getting <br/>
some rest and not good when she&#39;s exhausted and wired up and forcing <br/>
herself to stay awake.<br/>
<br/>
My kids all often, almost always, fell asleep wherever they happened to <br/>
be when they got sleepy - never &quot;put them to bed&quot; until they were <br/>
already asleep and we carried them (or slightly woke them and walked <br/>
them, as they got older).<br/>
<br/>
I know Karri and her daughter, by the way, in noncyber-life, and I <br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met a more &quot;intense&quot; kid than Lindsay - she is go <br/>
go go go - her mind never slows down, her body keeps up. I had one <br/>
similar to this (Roya) and it was the same way - just go go go always <br/>
to the point of total mental and physical exhaustion and then trying <br/>
still to keep going. They get very frantic.<br/>
<br/>
The number one best thing that worked to help Roya calm down enough to <br/>
fall asleep was a LOT of exercise during the day - like hours and hours <br/>
of swimming or being at the beach, for example, then, after a good <br/>
dinner, a warm bath and putting on soft comfy pajamas. Timing was <br/>
crucial. If I let her get too overtired, nothing would work and she&#39;d <br/>
finally have a meltdown and neither of us would get to sleep until we <br/>
were MORE than exhausted. But, a warm bath at the right time and then <br/>
soft pajamas and then I&#39;d talk her into snuggling - I&#39;d read to her, <br/>
something soft and not too exciting. And I&#39;d read slowly and softly. <br/>
And I would take slow breaths and she&#39;d often just start breathing more <br/>
slowly along with me.<br/>
<br/>
Karri - you&#39;re going to have to find a way to convince your husband <br/>
that it is WORTH it to have the tv sound down - if it is on softly, <br/>
that&#39;ll be fine, background noise won&#39;t keep her awake, it is sudden <br/>
loud sounds that will get her riled up.<br/>
<br/>
If he understood that finding a bedtime routine that worked to settle <br/>
her down would mean a far less frantic and more enjoyable evening for <br/>
him, too, he&#39;d be more likely to cooperate, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<br/>
I had the same kind of problem with my husband - I&#39;d be sitting in the <br/>
living room, have FINALLY gotten Roya started settling down, I could <br/>
tell she was winding down, but he&#39;d switch channels to a really loud <br/>
channel, or go into the kitchen (which is right there - small house) <br/>
and run the trash compactor, or even just start whistling or something <br/>
that would get her ears perked up. I was just so much more in tune with <br/>
what was needed in our environment to help her calm down and get ready <br/>
to sleep. He thought I should be able to just put her in another room, <br/>
in a bed, and say, &quot;Stay there and go to sleep,&quot; and that was that.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, when the kids were older - when Roxana was 3 1/2 and Roya <br/>
was 6 1/2, we DID have a time that we just called &quot;quiet time.&quot; I had <br/>
another baby by then and was very worn out and desperately needed that <br/>
time AND they were very willing - they LIKED it. Turns out that&#39;s when <br/>
Roxana learned to read - during those &quot;quiet times&quot; with her sister <br/>
when she was, apparently, constantly asking Roya, &quot;What does this <br/>
spell? What is this word?&quot; We made that &quot;quiet time&quot; nice for them - <br/>
they&#39;d pick out baskets of books and small toys to take into their <br/>
beds, so that they would have them at hand, and they&#39;d have warm milk <br/>
first (which I always thought was just disgusting but my husband got <br/>
them started and they liked it) and we&#39;d put soft music on a tape <br/>
player and so on. I didn&#39;t read aloud then - because I was never good <br/>
at reading aloud at night, I was too tired all the time. They looked <br/>
forward to it. Nobody ever told them to go to sleep - and they could <br/>
have come out, occasionally did, but really not often. Mostly they just <br/>
set their stuff aside and turned over and went to sleep in a half hour <br/>
or an hour or so.<br/>
<br/>
When Roxana was a baby, I&#39;d sit on the couch to nurse her and call Roya <br/>
to come and keep me company. I&#39;d ask her to sing me a song, tell me a <br/>
story, etc. Then I might ask her to put on a story tape and come <br/>
snuggle up with me. Or we&#39;d put on tv, but on something sweet and soft <br/>
(David the Gnome!!! Anybody else remember him?). The best tv would be a <br/>
video that we&#39;d already watched lots.<br/>
<br/>
So - a practical idea for you, Karri. A little tv for Lindsay to watch, <br/>
with headphones even -- a dvd/tv combo - you can get one for under a <br/>
hundred dollars, I&#39;m sure. And get some dvd&#39;s that are going to work <br/>
well for her to fall asleep by.<br/>

but this time I was folding each thing as I picked it up.   As I folded shirts <br/>
for Marty and Holly, and stacked each in his or her basket, and made sure the <br/>
underwear was rightside out and the socks were paired up, I thought about why <br/>
I didn&#39;t mind doing it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s healing for my inner child.    I think first how &quot;unfair&quot; it is that I <br/>
folded laundry then because I had to, yet I&#39;m not &quot;making&quot; my kids fold other <br/>
people&#39;s laundry as I had to.   Then I think how nice it would have felt if <br/>
*just once* my mom had brought all my clothes to me, folded and stacked, and said <br/>
something sweet to me, and smiled.    And I think of me when I do that for <br/>
them, and it feels good.<br/>

<br/>
My husband, as the youngest, was put into his room and told to sleep while very loud TV was going on in the living room, not far away, and the whole rest of the family was up and watching.  As an adult guest sleeping in that same house, I tried to retire early (of my own choice) and I can&#39;t imagine how anyone could sleep through that noise.   I certainly couldn&#39;t -- and I wanted to!<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I know Karri and her daughter, by the way, in noncyber-life, and I <br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met a more &quot;intense&quot; kid than Lindsay - she is go <br/>
go go go - her mind never slows down, her body keeps up. I had one <br/>
similar to this (Roya) and it was the same way - just go go go always <br/>
to the point of total mental and physical exhaustion and then trying <br/>
still to keep going. They get very frantic.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m so glad to know you:-)  With your experience with Roya, it&#39;s helped me tremendously to share experiences.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The number one best thing that worked to help Roya calm down enough to <br/>
fall asleep was a LOT of exercise during the day - &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is when she settles in best at night.  When she has had a very &quot;active&quot; day.  I&#39;m working on doing that more regularly.  The baby and I are sick with a bad cold again.  We both have fevers.  I hate this because then I can&#39;t get her out and she *needs* that.  I do open up the backyard and let her &quot;run.&quot;  She tells me it&#39;s too hot for her to be out there lately, though.  I do have a secret weapon, though when I&#39;m really desperate to get her excercise.  We have a bounce house that I set up on occasion and she bounces inside of it inside the house, lol.  It takes up the whole playroom when it is up, but it&#39;s been a lifesaver at times for energy burn off when we haven&#39;t been able to get out.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Karri - you&#39;re going to have to find a way to convince your husband <br/>
that it is WORTH it to have the tv sound down - if it is on softly, <br/>
that&#39;ll be fine, background noise won&#39;t keep her awake, it is sudden <br/>
loud sounds that will get her riled up.  If he understood that finding a bedtime routine that worked to settle <br/>
her down would mean a far less frantic and more enjoyable evening for <br/>
him, too, he&#39;d be more likely to cooperate, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually told him what you said and he agreed to get a pair of headphones.  I&#39;ve known that the sound has bothered Lindsay for a long time and he is starting to get it, by other people saying so.  We bought the headphones and he just needs to set them up now;-)  They are wireless.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;He thought I should be able to just put her in another room, <br/>
in a bed, and say, &quot;Stay there and go to sleep,&quot; and that was that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Jim would like it to be this way too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When Roxana was a baby, I&#39;d sit on the couch to nurse her and call Roya <br/>
to come and keep me company. I&#39;d ask her to sing me a song, tell me a <br/>
story, etc. Then I might ask her to put on a story tape and come <br/>
snuggle up with me. Or we&#39;d put on tv, but on something sweet and soft <br/>
(David the Gnome!!! Anybody else remember him?). The best tv would be a <br/>
video that we&#39;d already watched lots.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea to have her sing me a song. She&#39;d like that.  She does come snuggle with me and we do put her &quot;shows&quot; on that she likes (Reading Rainbow and Scooby Doo).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So - a practical idea for you, Karri. A little tv for Lindsay to watch, <br/>
with headphones even -- a dvd/tv combo - you can get one for under a <br/>
hundred dollars, I&#39;m sure. And get some dvd&#39;s that are going to work <br/>
well for her to fall asleep by.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great idea, I&#39;ll look into it.  As long as it is under 100 we can probably swing it.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing your suggestions and experience, Pam:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218787169">Thank you, I think it has helped me to be told this.  I was concerned about being too &quot;controlling&quot; because we are so exhausted that DH and I want to go to bed when she may or may not be ready.  <br/>

There are many things between &quot;You have to go to bed now because it&#39;s 8:00&quot; <br/>
and &quot;You don&#39;t have to go to bed at all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve made an argument against arbitrary bedtimes, it&#39;s been against <br/>
ARBITRARY bedtimes and the fear, frustration and arguments they cause.   If <br/>
bedtime is &quot;when everyone else is going to be&quot; or &quot;when we have to be quiet because <br/>
of the neighbors&quot; or &quot;when mom&#39;s too sleepy to stay up with you anymore (in <br/>
the case of younger children), that is not arbitrary.   That&#39;s for a real <br/>
reason, not just a rule that&#39;s not worth &quot;enforcing.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;These days will pass. <br/>
Maybe record your husband&#39;s shows, and ask him to watch them later, after the <br/>
kids are asleep, or the next day, or the weekend, so that he&#39;s not stuck to <br/>
the TV while you&#39;re needing help with kids.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have Tivo.  He still likes to watch when the kids are playing in the same room.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They won&#39;t always be little.   It will be a shame if he misses their younger <br/>
years for TV shows he could watch later.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree. I&#39;m just not sure if there is anything that I could say for him to realize this.<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My husband was always a Disney buff, so it was easy for him to watch a movie <br/>
with one of the kids.   He could watch The Jungle Book or Aladdin ANYtime.   <br/>
Maybe your husband could find movies he and the kids could watch together.   <br/>
Neverending Story is on DVD now.   That&#39;s a good one dads can like.   The <br/>
Princess Bride is easy to go to sleep to.   Willow.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I will try these.  He does watch Scooby Doo with her.  So maybe he&#39;d go for other things.  They usually take turns watching each other&#39;s shows, but DD doesn&#39;t really pay too much attention when his shows are on.  Tonite he did get on the floor to play with the kids for awhile.  I was so excited by this. I told him that I thought that Lindsay really enjoyed playing with him like that.  I hope it continues:-)  Maybe he is starting to see what he is missing.<br/>

to sleep, but he hated worse to be the only one awake, so there was a <br/>
Discovery Toys cassette tape about the circus.   It was designed for drawing, and <br/>
there were quiet places where they would wait for the listener to draw.   Then the <br/>
narration would continue.   Marty listened to that dozens of times, maybe a <br/>
hundred.   He never heard the end.   But it was a way for him to stay in the <br/>
bed, trying to hear more than he had heard before. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a going to sleep tape.   It still surfaces around here sometimes.   <br/>
I used to have the means to make cassettes from other cassettes and albums <br/>
and made tons.   (Now I&#39;d like to chuck them all, but they&#39;re so...   you know.  <br/>
 Familiar.   And worn out, and losing their labels.   And I can&#39;t take more <br/>
with the equipment I have at the moment.)<br/>
