 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I really hear this.  When Phil was around 10 - 12 and history was <br/>
emerging as his passion, it was easy to smile and think it fine, and other <br/>
people thought it was way cool, and let the other stuff wait.  At around 13, <br/>
though, I was thinking, hmm,  no math or science -- and I was wondering if I <br/>
could really trust the process and let it &quot;wait&quot; like that.  At 16, I saw <br/>
that I needed to re-examine my own values and expectations.  Some people <br/>
thought we were just crazy -- &quot;What, he hasn&#39;t done a-l-g-e-b-r-a yet??&quot;   At <br/>
18 he decided he needed to *get it out of the way* and took it at community <br/>
college -- science, too -- and did fine.<br/>
<br/>
He took lots of classes at community college.  One semester was quite <br/>
something:  he took lots of classes -- several he really wanted to take and <br/>
several that were *requirements* -- things that it was &quot;time&quot; to take.  He <br/>
got good grades, but he said he found it sort of hollow, because he found <br/>
that he was meeting requirements and chasing grades, and as a result he <br/>
actually learned *less* than when he took classes he wanted to or studied <br/>
things on his own.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, that semester one of his classes was the History of England, <br/>
which normally would have absolutely consumed him -- history was his passion. <br/>
 Well, he found himself, maybe because of all the other things he had to do, <br/>
doing only the things the professor required.  No extra reading, research, <br/>
museum exhibits, films, all the ancillary things he would normally have done <br/>
which expanded his learning so.  He got a good grade, but he didn&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; <br/>
nearly enough for him to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he said he had found it damaging, actually.  The next semester he <br/>
didn&#39;t take any classes at all -- he deschooled the whole time.  <br/>
<br/>
Dd Cecily, at 14, seems as *into* dance as Phil was into history. I know that <br/>
she knows how to learn (boy, is she ever learning -- she didn&#39; start dance <br/>
until 13 so is really working hard at it) and, although her passion is so <br/>
different from what mine were (I&#39;m more left-brained) I find that she is <br/>
teaching me a lot, too, and I am much more trusting of the whole process with <br/>
her.<br/>
