<div id="ygrps-yiv-3687856">Living in NC you get it a lot {even in this the more open-minded areas} but we get it a little less now.<br/>
Once they came up and I finally right out told them I was a pagan, they didn&#39;t know what it was {or maybe they were playing dumb just to see what flavor I was} so i finally said well you could call me a witch. They were nice about it but it was a short visit.And they haven&#39;t been back. <br/>
 I got tired of wasting time explaining in my own yard what i did with my life to perfect strangers. {I mean thats why i joined these lists LOL} <br/>
After that I put a homemade sign with big letters beside my driveway {have a long driveway and live somewhat in the boonies} &quot;Solicitors and trespassers not welcome&quot; and we have the dogs outside and I have a bunch of &quot;Beware of the Dogs&quot; signs too. Even the mailman walks on eggshells here, LOL. Though the meter man comes right up with no hesitation.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Ack!  That would drive me crazy!  We&#39;ve had two missionaries knocking our <br/>
door down and ringing the phone off the wall for almost three weeks.  I&#39;ve <br/>
explained to them that we aren&#39;t interested, we are moving and nine million <br/>
other things.  I&#39;ve asked them not to come by or call anymore (a friend&#39;s <br/>
mom gave them my number...another GRRR altogether!) but they still come.  <br/>
Yesterday, there were four who came to the door and one was poking his nose <br/>
in the front room window trying to get the kids to open the door and another <br/>
was walking around to my backyard!!    ....<br/>
My husband has a bumper sticker with two missionary-looking people carrying, <br/>
presumably, a bible.  It has a large red circle around it and the picture is <br/>
crossed out.  I&#39;m about to slap it on my front door, tacky as it <br/>
is.....maybe then they will get the hint!&gt;&gt;<br/>
