<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851322225">To Brenda and all who have written on the topic of &quot;children as messiah&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
The best book I ever read that spotlights the divinity in every human being <br/>
is &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; by J.D. Salinger.<br/>
<br/>
It is not just our children whom we should view as temporal manifestations <br/>
of the deity... it is every human being we encounter, most particularly the <br/>
ones we wish to be around the least. The mean &quot;Fat Lady&quot; fanning herself on <br/>
the porch is Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine the president of the School Board, yall...<br/>
