<div id="ygrps-yiv-793158495">So what do you do when your toddler is coloring on the furniture or something along those lines? Innocent stuff, that they are doing just because they don&#39;t know that it&#39;s not polite to color on your furniture. <br/>

Obviously we offer paper and such. I&#39;m just wondering how you handle things when you turn your back for a second to go to the bathroom. Is it really just about being there 100% of the time? Would you say &quot;NO&quot; or just say &quot;we color on paper&quot; matter of factly?<br/>

Mine were told no. Because in my house it&#39;s not OK to just draw on walls. I <br/>
keep so much paper, in many different forms, around to draw on that there <br/>
should be no reason to actively search out wall-space. The only two times either <br/>
boy drew on the walls, he had a friend over that talked him into it. They each <br/>
did it only once.<br/>
<br/>
That said, their rooms are made up of murals! &lt;g&gt; Cameron has drawn wonderful <br/>
murals of his favorite bands and has poetry in spots. Duncan has the <br/>
Batcave-soon-to-be-Simpson&#39;s room. All painted. <br/>
<br/>
So I have a double standard! &lt;g&gt; Sorry, I can&#39;t get past that one! <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>**Neither :0).  We color on lots of things at our house, and I try not<br/>
to make myself the arbiter of what &#39;we&#39; do anyway.  I said something<br/>
more like, &quot;Wow, the couch has a really slippery surface for drawing on,<br/>
huh?  I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t draw there - how about if we try to find<br/>
something else that&#39;s slippery to draw on instead?&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I think part of the appeal of drawing on the wall is that it&#39;s got a<br/>
whole different feel than paper does - and it&#39;s so big.  When my kids<br/>
were interested in that we found ways for them to draw on the wall -<br/>
chalkboard paint was a favorite, or hanging a thin piece of paper so<br/>
they could still feel the wall texture underneath, or picking a space<br/>
for them to decorate.  We got some really huge paper for them.  When<br/>
Rowan decided the couch was her favorite thing to draw on I gave her<br/>
lots of different textured fabrics she could use.     <br/>
 <br/>
Mostly I just tried to keep in mind that their explorations were more<br/>
valuable than our furniture.  The Mr. Clean Eraser does a great job<br/>
removing things from walls and fridges and some furniture, btw :0).<br/>

&quot;NO&quot; or just say &quot;we color on paper&quot; matter of factly?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As the mom of a 4yo muralist &lt;grin&gt;, this is how we handle it.  We make sure<br/>
that Shelly has a tremendous amount of art supplies, different kinds of<br/>
paper, paints, colors, pencils, note pads, etc..  We make sure they are in a<br/>
place where she can reach them when she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
When Michelle would color on the wall, I would tell her &quot;I love your colors<br/>
but let&#39;s put them on the paper so we can show Granny better.&quot;  Then when<br/>
she did it again.  I would say &quot;I do not want you to color on the walls.<br/>
You can color on any paper, etc. But not the walls.&quot;  Then she colored on<br/>
her walls in her room....and I said &quot;cool.&quot;  After all, it is her wall.<br/>
<br/>
I had done everything I know to do, provide &quot;appropriate&quot; materials, talked<br/>
to her about why paper is better, told her what I wanted and why, provided a<br/>
safe place for her to paint on a wall......Michelle has painted on almost<br/>
every wall in the house.  She stopped about the time she turned 4.<br/>
<br/>
She had colored on the wall and I came in and said &quot;Shelly&quot; in a somewhat<br/>
exasperated tone.  She almost jumped and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  It was like I<br/>
could see the empathy light come on.  She had reached on age where she could<br/>
take my point of view....and she stopped coloring on walls.<br/>
<br/>
The point being that I personally don&#39;t think all the<br/>
discipline/punishments/rewards &quot;fix&quot; a problem behavior.  I think eventually<br/>
kids get mature enough to see where their behavior is impacting others.<br/>

We are talking about an 18 month old.lol. So yes we too have lots of paper. This isn&#39;t about searching out wall-space. It&#39;s about learning what&#39;s considered acceptable. I&#39;m just trying to understand how others do it without always resorting to the &quot;NO&quot; word.:-)<br/>

I agree!  When my kids were very little I kept the markers and crayons on a<br/>
shelf up high and only got them out when I was available to CLOSELY<br/>
supervise.  I wanted to avoid using &quot;NO&quot; almost as much as I wanted to avoid<br/>
marker and crayon all over.<br/>

hang around and watch me try to take it off.  If it came off, he knew how much <br/>
work it was.  If it didn&#39;t come off, he had to hear me say &quot;Oh no, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
come off.  And I don&#39;t know if we can paint over it either.  Don&#39;t write on <br/>
the wall anymore, okay?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We had a to-be-plastered wall on an outbuilding on the patio that they could <br/>
paint on, on the outside.  That was fun.  I&#39;d mix up pots of tempera and give <br/>
them fat brushes and let them go to it.<br/>

what you do or don&#39;t do (or say) about it. If it is an ongoing thing - <br/>
then, well - don&#39;t go into the bathroom leaving the 18 month old with <br/>
access to crayons? It wouldn&#39;t be nice of you to be negative with an 18 <br/>
month old for writing on walls if you left the child alone with crayons <br/>
and walls. Now you know and nobody has to tell you &quot;NO!&quot; either - <br/>
because you can figure out what to do about it for yourself &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
My kids NEVER drew on walls. No never. Really. Don&#39;t believe me? Well!!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, both my older two wrote their names on their drawings on the <br/>
bathroom wall, next to the toilet - guess they had a crayon in their <br/>
little hand when they were sitting there, getting bored. Plus one of <br/>
them once CARVED her name into the wooden front of some brand-new <br/>
drawers.<br/>
<br/>
Telling them nicely that you don&#39;t like it seems honest and okay to me. <br/>
But not punishing for it - not even verbally - especially not an 18 <br/>
month old baby.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235052359">Kathy,  I sympathise here :-)<br/>
 <br/>
One of my babies is a real wall-art artist.  I make sure the older ones<br/>
have those non-permanent crayola markers.  At least, most of it comes<br/>
off.  Xavier drew a huge wax crayon mural in the big boys room and we,<br/>
uh, laughed and took a pic.  when we saw it.  He was very proud of it,<br/>
went back the next day to finish it (add another color!) and has never<br/>
touched it again.   All other situations were easy to deal with, fresh<br/>
made was just wipe off except in my living room where he went<br/>
scribble-crazy with a ball-point pen wow   Lets say its kind of<br/>
cute for now :-)  <br/>
 <br/>
Id usually react something like Xavier, mommy doesnt really like it<br/>
when you draw on the walls, come draw at the table Ill give you a big<br/>
paper.   And it usually works.  Its a phase, hes almost out of it (at<br/>
2 ¼ yo).  Redirect to another activity.  Dont make something huge out<br/>
of it.  Frame it.  Take a picture of it, and the artist :-)<br/>
 <br/>
Genevieve<br/>
 <br/>
I do try to keep them up, but the other kids constantly bring them<br/>
down:-) I&#39;ll have to be more diligent I guess. This was just an example<br/>
though. I guess I was just wondering how you handle these types of<br/>
situations that are about a toddler learning and exploring that<br/>
sometimes result in a bit of damage.<br/>

I think &quot;no&quot; has gotten a bad rap.  It is a perfectly wonderful word when it<br/>

use the word &quot;no&quot;, we can use so many other words that kids end up not<br/>
knowing where that line is.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  My 7yo dd likes to play with her friend in the friend&#39;s family car<br/>
at park day.  The dad never said a word about it.  Then one day, the friend<br/>
kept cutting her eyes at the dad and making like end runs around him to get<br/>
to the car....taking my dd in tow.  It was obvious to me the Dad didn&#39;t want<br/>
them in the car.  I asked and he stated that papers had come up missing and<br/>
it was a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I told dd that Dad didn&#39;t want her playing in the car but friend kept trying<br/>
to talk her into it, saying it was &#39;OK&#39;.  So I asked dd to ask Dad if he<br/>
wanted her playing in the car.....he hemhawed around and finally said &quot;It<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be my preference.&quot;  I looked at Marsie and said &quot;That means &#39;no&#39;&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem comes when NO is the automatic answer, not because there<br/>
is a real reason but because it is a knee-jerk reaction.  My right to do as<br/>
I please stops at the point it infringes on your rights.  How will I know<br/>
where that point is unless you tell me, particularly if I am 18 months old?<br/>
<br/>
Or it is a problem when people think that they have said &quot;no&quot; and the issue<br/>
has come up again so they must now punish the child to make them learn.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, try to find a solution that you are both happy with.  Of course,<br/>
try to help your daughter come up with other options.  But &quot;no&quot; is an<br/>
acceptable word.<br/>

keep<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I agree!  When my kids were very little I kept the markers and crayons<br/>
on a<br/>
&gt;   shelf up high and only got them out when I was available to CLOSELY<br/>
&gt;   supervise.  I wanted to avoid using &quot;NO&quot; almost as much as I wanted to<br/>
avoid<br/>
&gt;   marker and crayon all over.<br/>

  I used to put large paper up on the wall, from rolls. Or large sides from fridge boxes...<br/>
  as a former teacher, I learned that if a kid wanted to spit, well he could go outside and spit until he had enough of it. Done with the right attitude, everyone wins. Of course, the spitting (or drawing or whatever) had to be in an ok place...<br/>

<br/>
My guy was about 3 when he went on this binge--the walls, the carpet, the<br/>
cabinets, the computer monitor and keyboard. (He&#39;s almost 4 now, and his<br/>
sisters are 6 and 5.) Obviously, he was significantly older and more<br/>
developmentally capable of understanding boundaries at that point than a 18<br/>
mo old. Sam&#39;s never been a distractable kind of child, but he will sometimes<br/>
deal with substitutions--you can&#39;t do it here, but you can do it over there<br/>
kind of thing. He stayed with me while I cleaned up and helped when he could<br/>
(this was when that was still interesting *g*) and we talked about how the<br/>
crayon makes it difficult to play on the computer, that mommy doesn&#39;t like<br/>
crayon on the walls, furniture or carpet but loves to tape pictures to the<br/>
wall where ever they would like (tape is a really big thing around here<br/>
right now). After the third or fourth time, I did simply tell the kids that<br/>
if I wasn&#39;t there, the art supplies didn&#39;t come down. But, I made sure to<br/>
say &quot;yes&quot; when ever they asked for them, so they weren&#39;t cut off from doing<br/>
art. That didn&#39;t last long, and when we &quot;tried again&quot; Sam was done with<br/>
drawing on things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a big fan of reducing the number of no&#39;s and the impact of accidents as<br/>
much as possible: making sure that *everything* is washable at this age.<br/>
Slipcovers, satin instead of flat wall paint (in the playroom I used<br/>
semi-gloss!), water-solulable art supplies. This makes it much easier not to<br/>
get worked up over accidents and experiments. There are boundaries and kids<br/>
work to figure out what they are, but there&#39;s a big difference between<br/>
finding out a boundary in a punitive and shaming kind of way versus a gentle<br/>
but firm way.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Julie that &quot;no&quot; is a part of living with other people. When I<br/>
say no, it&#39;s a &quot;no, thank you&quot; and an explanation why: &quot;No thank you jumping<br/>
on my bed. I&#39;m tired and trying to relax. If you want to jump, please get<br/>
down on the floor&quot;. If it&#39;s something big like hitting his sisters, me or<br/>
the dog it&#39;s a &quot;no, sir!&quot; firm but not yelled, furrowed brows to let him<br/>
know that I&#39;m serious about not allowing the action to continue, and the<br/>
next step is removing him from the situation--picking him up and walking<br/>
with him to his room, or to sit on the stairs, someplace where we&#39;re out of<br/>
view from the others and can focus on each other.<br/>
<br/>
*sigh* Yes, all my examples of &quot;no&quot; and boundaries are about my guy, not my<br/>
girls--he&#39;s my challenge. The key as I see it is always being willing to<br/>
examine boundaries from several perspectives to see if they can be<br/>
renegotiated and as much as possible remaining gentle, firm and consistent<br/>
when the boundaries really are inflexible, like hitting, ruining carpet and<br/>
furniture. Often there are ways around even the firm boundaries as people<br/>
have been pointing out: can&#39;t draw on furniture, but can paint a child&#39;s<br/>
table with chalkboard paint; can&#39;t draw on walls, but can draw on<br/>
paper-covered walls or other designated spaces; can&#39;t carve furniture, but<br/>
can carve soap or erasers; can&#39;t hit people or animals, but can hit pillows;<br/>
can&#39;t spit at people, but can spit outside or in the shower. The real<br/>
challenge with my guy has been that he often wants nothing to do with these<br/>
substitutions--it&#39;s the original action or a rage. That gets really tricky.<br/>
The key for me is to try to prevent situations whenever possible by being<br/>
there and immediately available, by trying to read his cues (because the<br/>
circumstances are unpredictable) before the situation escalates, and by<br/>
reducing the number of no&#39;s to a bare minimum by really recognizing the<br/>
knee-jerk, in-the-box kind of no&#39;s that pop out of some parent&#39;s mouths and<br/>
*not* doing that myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475358645">&quot;But &quot;no&quot; is an acceptable word.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Julie S.<br/>
<br/>
This reminded me of the time when my son was somewhere between 6 months and <br/>
a year old.  I was in this Kinder Musik class with him.  We were all sitting <br/>
in a circle and I think he was stuffing some instrument in his mouth.  I <br/>
said in a VERY jokingly and mellow way, &quot;Nooo Aidan.&quot;  (I think this was the <br/>
first time I had ever even said the word before to my child - it wasn&#39;t like <br/>
I was running around screaming &quot;no&quot; at him every 3 minutes.)  After class <br/>
the instructor (who was also my friend) jumped all over me questioning how I <br/>
could ever say the word &quot;No&quot; to my poor child who obviously could now be <br/>
psychologically damaged for the rest of his life.  She was that intense <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
I had read many books discussing these issues, what with the &quot;good jobs&quot; and <br/>
too many &quot;no&#39;s.&quot;  But after that little episode I realized that these words <br/>
are a part of our English language (!), and that it makes little sense to <br/>
completely eradicate them from our daily speech.  Another friend I have told <br/>
me that in her little preschool (she is unschooling now) that occasionally <br/>
saying the words &quot;good job&quot; to a child would result in the other mothers <br/>
giving her the evil eye.  Admittedly, I can&#39;t stand people who say &quot;good <br/>
job&quot; a million times to their kids over everything, but it&#39;s normal for <br/>
these words to be spoken.  I can&#39;t stand the &#39;thought police.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Obvious I know, but I just felt like sharing.<br/>

learn languages; I speak French and Chinese and a little Italian and<br/>
Spanish.  We have a homeschool French class that meets at our house weekly -<br/>
we cook (truffles and crepes so far), sing, do crafts, and have fun while<br/>
immersing ourselves in the language.  Other than that, we just have whatever<br/>
fun we can think of.<br/>
