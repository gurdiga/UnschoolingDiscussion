<div id="ygrps-yiv-43716363">I just wanted to post a food idea.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this has been mentioned before, but if so, I haven&#39;t seen it.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t offered my toddler pureed baby food for a good while, ever since<br/>
she&#39;s been eating more solid, big-people food, but she has recently gotten<br/>
fascinated with *dipping.*<br/>
<br/>
It started with the regular stuff we think of dipping -- french fries or<br/>
chips into ranch dressing, sour cream, nacho cheese, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But we also have a 6 month old, who is just starting into pureed foods.  So,<br/>
now my toddler has renewed interest in the pureed baby food, watching her<br/>
little sister eat it -- and the other day, I put a jar of it on her tray for<br/>
her to play with and try.  She started dipping all her other food in it.<br/>
She was dipping some kind of noodles in pureed bananas.  She was loving it.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, she&#39;s eating mac and cheese with hot dog bites, and carrot<br/>
*dip* (pureed carrots).<br/>
<br/>
Any age kids might find pureed baby foods fun to play with and dip other<br/>
foods into.  It&#39;s fun to experiment with the different textures and taste<br/>
combos.  And older kids might like to play with mixing different combos in a<br/>
food processor, making their own *baby* food.<br/>
