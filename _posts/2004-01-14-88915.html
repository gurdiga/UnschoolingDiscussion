<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654482225">&quot;I&#39;d come by myself, but then I thought, I don&#39;t <br/>
think they would want me without Bob.  LOL<br/>
We&#39;ll all be there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...I certainly wouldn&#39;t complain if you were the only one that could come!! But more Wilkinson&#39;s are better than less of course. :)<br/>
I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re all going to be here. I&#39;ll start posting stuff about plans and hotel and such this summer. I should have some good information by July.<br/>
