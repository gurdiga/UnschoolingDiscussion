<div id="ygrps-yiv-791206409">**&gt; Here is what I&#39;ve gotten out of what I&#39;ve read in the past here:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You can&#39;t unschool unless you relinguish ALL control over your<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s choices including when and how to do housework, sleep watch<br/>
<br/>
&gt; TV, etc<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. Never said.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s been implied is that once you recognize that children can be<br/>
trusted<br/>
to learn the &quot;academic&quot; things then it&#39;s hard not to question why kids<br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
learn the rest of the things they&#39;ll need in life by living life.**<br/>
<br/>
For me, the crux of unschooling is avoiding forced learning because I<br/>
believe forced learning damages a person&#39;s natural desire to learn and<br/>
can cause him to despise and resist the subject matter being forced on<br/>
him.  I believe that making a child do math worksheets is likely to<br/>
dampen their overall enthusiasm for learning as well as making them<br/>
detest math.  Heck, someone could make me hate strawberries (yum) if<br/>
s/heforce-fed me too many of them.<br/>
<br/>
Extending this, yes, forcing or nagging a child to pick up toys can<br/>
cause them to hate picking up toys.  I see the connection.  But, I don&#39;t<br/>
think my child has a natural love of tidiness that I am likely to<br/>
damage.  Chores are a separate issue for me.  Still, I try to keep them<br/>
from being loathsome.<br/>
