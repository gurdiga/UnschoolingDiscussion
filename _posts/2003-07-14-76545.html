<div id="ygrps-yiv-571708408"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I was thinking about the training space aspect. We are looking for a few<br/>
&gt;(2-5) acres outside of the city. I&#39;ll have to explore more to see if there<br/>
&gt;is a market for herding dogs here. I understand what you mean about them<br/>
&gt;being pets. I would be pretty pick too letting them go. I have a lot more to<br/>
&gt;read and do before going into anything like that. Any sugestions? <br/>

I think the best book to get you started thinking about these sorts of things is A Way Of Life by H Glyn Jones and Barbara C Collins.  Another good one is The Shepherd&#39;s Dog by (I think) John Holman.<br/>
<br/>
10 acres is really a more ideal size for training sheepdogs, but you can get by on just a few acres.  If you&#39;re looking to make a bit of a living out of it, you first need to get really good at training your own dogs (so years of lessons, clinics, trialing, etc), and most of that you can do on a smaller property.  But at some point you&#39;re going to feel the need to expand to a larger area -- you can do that by leasing a field from a neighbor tho.  Also, you need some breathing room if you&#39;re going to keep enough sheep to train a number of dogs (but again, can lease pasture space if need be).  We definitely feel cramped here, will be relocating in the next several years to a more ideal set up.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that answers the question now that I understood it! LOL<br/>

    Thanks so much for the reply. I know that shuffle. LOL! There wasn&#39;t any<br/>
rush. I think this is going to take a while to find what we want. I&#39;ll check<br/>
out those books. :-)<br/>
