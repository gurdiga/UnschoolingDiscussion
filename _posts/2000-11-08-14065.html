<br/>
But, such thinking can backfire.  I grew up in an upper middle class alcoholic home, and was alternately abused and ignored.  However, school was no refuge for me.  I absolutely hated school, for various reasons, and it was many years of torture and trauma for me.  I never did well there.  I would have done much better left to my own devices, since most of what I learned, I taught myself.  I did not have a refuge anywhere, except a few spots where I would go and hide by myself (like under the front porch) and there was no one that I could trust.  My inner city school was a dangerous and unwelcoming place and there were no saviours within the staff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115441400">This is broad brushing and is not the norm, it is something that the NEA and<br/>
teachers&#39; unions put out there as one more reason children shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, for some children it may be a lifeline, but believe me, having worked<br/>
at many public schools, that simply isn&#39;t a function that schools fulfill to<br/>
any great degree!  PS doesn&#39;t help/find/rescue anymore abused children than<br/>
any other method and, in fact, causes as many if not more traumas from daily<br/>
bullying by other students to sexual abuse by teachers.<br/>
