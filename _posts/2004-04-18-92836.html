<br/>
Someone else mentioned trying to get family to give gifts other than <br/>
toys. I like that. I&#39;ve tried asking people not to give gifts at all <br/>
and it hasn&#39;t worked for me. Perhaps asking them to take your kids <br/>
shopping to pick out toys or out on some other outing. I think a lot <br/>
of people would resist (or at least be annoyed by)a parent telling <br/>
them what toys not to buy, but would accept hearing what the child <br/>
wants or taking suggestions for outings.<br/>
<br/>
I have one relative who gives money in our name to Heifer <br/>
International and I always love that. Then there&#39;s my MIL who doesn&#39;t <br/>
ever ask what anyone wants and then complains about how hard it is to <br/>
shop for people. I don&#39;t think she liked it when I interrupted her <br/>
complaining to tell her what dh and the kids wanted last Christmas!! <br/>
Oh well...<br/>
<br/>
For years, I&#39;ve tried to give people gifts that they could eat or <br/>
otherwise consume! I haven&#39;t done that much with kids, but maybe <br/>
there&#39;s something your kids like they they use up and therefore won&#39;t <br/>
take up space for long...<br/>

<br/>
Are you sure you aren&#39;t doing the same thing but in reverse to your parents?<br/>
Getting rid of the toys as a way to control the relationship your parents<br/>
have with your kids?<br/>
<br/>
So what if the grandparents give &quot;bad&quot; gifts?  A walker can be slowed down<br/>
by messing with the wheels.  I wonder about why you would try to sneak away<br/>
toys without people noticing.<br/>
<br/>
You know what your kids would enjoy for their birthdays.  Why not get it for<br/>
them?  They are happy.  You are happy.  Your parents can get the toys that<br/>
make them happy.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest unless the grandparents are actively damaging a child, let<br/>
the kids and grandparents sort out their own relationship.<br/>

Subject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Gifts other than toys<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I love the idea of &quot;experiences&quot; rather than objects, and have read of<br/>
&gt; families successfully suggesting it.  Usually in the anecdotes I read it<br/>
&gt; ends up being an experience (basketball game) with a matching small gift<br/>
&gt; (basketball).  I&#39;ve suggested this to my mom and MIL (both are within 20<br/>
&gt; min. from us) and both enthusiastically applaud the suggestion at first.<br/>
&gt; Then they go out and buy toys (and sometimes clothes).  For the winter<br/>
&gt; solstice I registered the kids at Toys R Us.  Morgaine and I went around<br/>
&gt; and picked things out for her and Orion.  Our parents were not<br/>
&gt; impressed.  MIL actually took it so personally that for Orion&#39;s birthday<br/>
&gt; last week, when we dropped Morgaine and Orion off so we could go b-day<br/>
&gt; shopping, she handed us $40 and asked us to pick out some things we<br/>
&gt; wanted him to have.  This worked out great, but it saddened me too.<br/>
&gt; Honestly, she sees them so seldom, 2 hrs. a month or less I&#39;d guess,<br/>
&gt; that she really doesn&#39;t know what they like, but at the same time I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want her to think she can&#39;t get them things she thinks will make<br/>
&gt; them happy.  I&#39;m just trying to control the quality and quantity of<br/>
&gt; stuff - both families spend easily $50-$100 per kid, on junk, because<br/>
&gt; they like them to have lots of things to open.  Then we pile the junk<br/>
&gt; into the car (we barely fit it in the back of my Volvo wagon last year<br/>
&gt; after the winter holiday) and bring it home, and I slowly get rid<br/>
&gt; of/throw out many of the things over the next several months.  Others<br/>
&gt; are harder to get rid of without them noticing, like the walker she<br/>
&gt; chose for Orion that rolled way too fast and bloodied his nose a few<br/>
&gt; times.  There was a lot of hostility when we got rid of it, because she<br/>
&gt; spent $30 on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also try to give &quot;consumable&quot; gifts, or versatile inexpensive ones.<br/>
&gt; My two favorites are a small bag of scarves and homemade craft kits<br/>
&gt; (such as a kit for making a dreamcatcher) or just materials (such as<br/>
&gt; beads and pipe cleaners).  It depends on the parent - some parents are<br/>
&gt; far more likely to do a &quot;kit&quot; with their kids than just pull out beads<br/>
&gt; to play with.  Before buying these, though, I usually offer Morgaine (if<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s her friend and a birthday party or whatever) the option of making<br/>
&gt; them something - she enjoys giving homemade puppets and bracelets and<br/>
&gt; dreamcatchers and such.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The problem with suggestions for what the kids want is that our parents<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t seem to trust us as parents.  For Orion&#39;s birthday we chose a<br/>
&gt; Hotwheels track for him, since the kids played with the last one so much<br/>
&gt; they broke it.  My mom said, &quot;Oh, Dan (dh), we all know who that&#39;s for.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Or about the bug cage (got tired of refereeing arguments over Morgaine&#39;s<br/>
&gt; bug cage) - &quot;He&#39;s way too young to use that.&quot;  Meanwhile the stuffed<br/>
&gt; bathtub Elmo (the fourth Elmo doll she&#39;s gotten him) has sat untouched.<br/>
&gt; When I try to communicate with her about this, she gets very offended.<br/>
&gt; MIL just shuts down.  Yes, we&#39;re young parents.  I was 21 when I had<br/>
&gt; Morgaine; Dan was 24.  But my mom was 21 when she had me, and Dan&#39;s mom<br/>
&gt; was 24 when she had him.  Perhaps that&#39;s the crux of the issue, now that<br/>
&gt; I think about it - they just think I&#39;m wacko and ruining my kids through<br/>
&gt; babywearing, homebirthing, &quot;homeschooling&quot; (haven&#39;t mentioned that we<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t be &quot;doing school&quot;),  and extended breastfeeding, etc., and toys<br/>
&gt; are the control they have in my kids lives.  Hm.  Any thoughts on this?<br/>

<br/>
Control isn&#39;t always a good thing.  I can still remember some things my <br/>
mother just caused to disappear.   It shouldn&#39;t have been her decision to make.   <br/>
But a many adults are with their children, they feel like they own the children <br/>
and own their things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-she enjoys giving homemade puppets and bracelets and<br/>
dreamcatchers and such.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an important aspect of gift giving.  There is something of the giver, <br/>
and of joy.<br/>
<br/>
Telling people what to give negates that.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly&#39;s going to a birthday party, sometimes she knows exactly what she <br/>
wants to give the person.  Sometimes I ask the mom if there&#39;s a theme or need <br/>
or if the child is collecting anything particular.   Sometimes we don&#39;t need <br/>
to ask.  Sometimes Holly just gives someone she doesn&#39;t know very well <br/>
something interesting she thinks they wouldn&#39;t have known about (and she&#39;s a good gift <br/>
giver).  If there&#39;s something obscure and unique or new, how could a child or <br/>
a mom request it?  And if someone requests something, it&#39;s too much like <br/>
sending the bill in advance, for my tastes.<br/>
<br/>
-= The problem with suggestions for what the kids want is that our parents<br/>
don&#39;t seem to trust us as parents. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t seem clean.<br/>
I don&#39;t see a parents&#39; job as telling grandparents what to give as gifts.<br/>
<br/>
-=-they just think I&#39;m wacko and ruining my kids through<br/>
babywearing, homebirthing, &quot;homeschooling&quot; (haven&#39;t mentioned that we<br/>

 -=-<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like there are control issues and hold-out issues on both sides.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it should be about the children, and not the relationship between the <br/>
parents and grandparents.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if the inlaws had been more respectful of your husband&#39;s interests and <br/>
needs all along, it would be less irritating now.  Instead of repeating the <br/>
control-tension buildup, maybe try to avoid and release it.<br/>

when they are RIGHT there and let them use it in front of them while <br/>
you keep a super close watch. Bring the toys THEY gave them out when <br/>
they are there. It&#39;ll give them joy to see them playing with things <br/>
THEY gave them. If you can create a little joy in their lives, why hold <br/>
back on it. You don&#39;t have to TELL them if you give away a bunch of the <br/>
stuff after letting the kids play with it a time or two, keeping only <br/>
the things the kids really do love. You can tell them how much the kids <br/>
had fun playing with the stuff, not how you don&#39;t have room for it and <br/>
don&#39;t want it.<br/>
<br/>
On Easter, my family had a little get-together and I wore a pair of <br/>
pants and a shirt that my sister had given me for my birthday in <br/>
February. She&#39;s always giving me clothes for gifts and I can&#39;t STAND <br/>
her taste in clothes. I&#39;ve given them away, in the past, without ever <br/>
wearing them. But this time I thought about it and decided to keep this <br/>
outfit to wear the next time I saw her and I did. I saw her eyes light <br/>
UP and heard her say to her daughter, &quot;Look, Aunt Pam is wearing the <br/>
outfit we picked out for her.&quot; And her daughter (16 yo) also looked <br/>
really pleased. I don&#39;t have to wear the clothes again.<br/>
<br/>
I did the same thing with another gift. My daughter is a ceramicist and <br/>
our house is overflowing with her creations - it is a problem that we <br/>
deal with - it is like having a cat that keeps having kittens - <br/>
everybody we know has cupboard filled with my daughter&#39;s wonderful <br/>
dishes and yet they keep coming.<br/>
<br/>
But that same sister, unthinkingly, BOUGHT me a lovely, but machine <br/>
made, ceramic tray and matching &quot;dip bowl.&quot;  There is just nowhere for <br/>
me to keep this and it is entirely out of place with all my <br/>
one-of-a-kind handmade ceramics. So, my OTHER sister, who has more <br/>
sense, told me quietly, &quot;Just use it once at a family party and then <br/>
send it off to the Goodwill Store.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436696221">One thing that came to mind in regard to giving away toys that are not<br/>
played with or for some reason not &quot;appropriate.&quot;<br/>
My kids play with things sometimes ages after they were given to them. I am<br/>
always trying to find more space for more stuff so I  know what that&#39;s like.<br/>
But one can really find ways to store things in bins, boxes and crates.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about the walker that was mentioned. I saw my neice have one<br/>
for her daughter and thought it was so cute and went and bought one for<br/>
Alyssa. She wasn&#39;t thrilled with it and never really used it to walk. It sat<br/>
for quite awhile. Long enough that I thought it was a total wash out.<br/>
Probably about a year later, all the kids were using it and playing with it.<br/>
Not like it was actually intended for, but loads of fun nonetheless!<br/>
<br/>
I never get rid of anything until I ask the kids first. Just because I don&#39;t<br/>
think they play with it, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t want it around. And when<br/>
one doesn&#39;t want something, I ask the other two if they might want it. If no<br/>
one is interested, I give it away. And sometimes, when no one is interested,<br/>
I keep it anyway, on a motherly hunch.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph wanted this Harry Potter maze game kind of thing years ago. It was<br/>
rather expensive but we bought it anyway. It was played with for about a<br/>
week. Everytime we have clean out days, about twice a year, Joseph would<br/>
mention that we could give it away. I always kept it. It wasn&#39;t the money, I<br/>
just knew that eventually, one of the 3 smaller kids would play with it. A<br/>
few months ago, Joseph took it out and all 3 had a blast with it. Joseph<br/>
even thanked me for keeping it as he didn&#39;t know how much fun it would be.<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes, just being a different age makes something very inviting. And<br/>
remember, it doesn&#39;t have to be played with like grown ups expect it to<br/>
either.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I think receiving a walker would be a diff. matter for me. They are dangerous in my books. Fortunately here in Canada they were just banned and can&#39;t be sold in any way now so even if I had another baby I wouldn&#39;t have to deal with it. I would be tempted to have a talk with the giver who might not have been aware of the issues aurrounding walkers. Then again, I guess I could stick it in the basement until they showed up at the house and stick the baby in it at that time for show.<br/>
   With guests there&#39;d be lots of supervision. It would likely be disasembled and tossed first chance I got though.<br/>

<br/>
A baby I know just recently fell down the basement stairs in a <br/>
walker and had to go to the hospital.  He was fine, but it could <br/>
have been bad.<br/>
But still, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much the object that&#39;s dangerous <br/>
but how it&#39;s used and where and whether there&#39;s direct supervision.<br/>
My middle son spent some happy time in a walker in the very long <br/>
driveway of our old house while his brother rode a little bike.  I <br/>
always paid close attention so he wouldn&#39;t get near the road or into <br/>
any other predicaments, and he was never in any danger.  <br/>
<br/>
The newer, &quot;safer&quot; alternative to a walker are those immobile things <br/>
that the baby can spin around in and play with the various toys on <br/>
the sides.  The good part is that the baby can&#39;t fall down the <br/>
stairs in one (or roll into the road if outside), but the bad part <br/>
is that some mothers then tend to leave their babies alone in them.  <br/>
(I&#39;ve heard people jokingly call them their &quot;neglectomatic&quot; <br/>
or &quot;neglecto-saucer.&quot;)  At least with a walker the mother has to pay <br/>
attention.<br/>

<br/>
We told them that they&#39;re welcome to buy them all that stuff and keep it<br/>
at their houses.  We have a space issue. I don&#39;t have a basement to<br/>
store unused toys.  The kids&#39; room is already full.  The corners and<br/>
end-table cabinets in the living room are full.  The top bunk of the<br/>
bunkbed is full.  The closet shelves are full.  Under the beds - mine<br/>
and the kids&#39; - are full.  So when I say I&#39;m controlling the quality and<br/>
quantity of stff, I mean stuff per square inch that my kids enjoy.<br/>
Morgaine loves the &quot;throwaway&quot; party favors she gets at birthday<br/>
parties.  So we still have almost all of them.  When we purge, which we<br/>
have to do often, I give Morgaine a small box or bag to fill - her<br/>
choice.  Orion is just learning to talk in sentences.  I make decisions<br/>
about what to get rid of for him.  He turned 2 last week.  The<br/>
conversations I had this winter with mom and MIL were indeed private.<br/>
They are welcome to get the kids whatever they want, but the get very<br/>
upset when we get rid of their gifts.  My mother gave my children,<br/>
between the two of them, 5 new stuffed rabbits for Easter.  There is one<br/>
they like and play with, the rest are ignored.  It is likely we will get<br/>
rid of them at the next purge.  I&#39;ll first offer them to my mom for her<br/>
house.  Because she gets very upset when I give things away.  I&#39;m no<br/>
different with toys I give them that flop.  I get rid of them knowing<br/>
any space it makes will be filled at the next holiday or event.  <br/>
<br/>
You said they only see them a few hours a month. So pull out the walker <br/>
when they are RIGHT there and let them use it in front of them while <br/>
you keep a super close watch. Bring the toys THEY gave them out when <br/>
they are there. It&#39;ll give them joy to see them playing with things <br/>
THEY gave them. <br/>
 <br/>
They only come to our house for parties or once or twice when each baby<br/>
is born, seldom otherwise and usually for less than an hour.  We go to<br/>
their house.  The walker was a push-walker, and after he bloodied his<br/>
nose the second time I decided the wooden walker we had gooten at a yard<br/>
sale was just fine.  He was 10 months old; I didn&#39;t ask his permission<br/>
to get rid of it.  When MIL asked us how he liked the walker, Morgaine<br/>
said &quot;we don&#39;t have that anymore; he has a different one.&quot;  I don&#39;t lie<br/>
well, so when she asked what happened to it I told her.  Could I have<br/>
thrown it in the basement?  Sure, if I had one.  But for what purpose?<br/>
It might be played with later, but if they want one later they will ask<br/>
for it.  I can&#39;t cram every toy in the whole wide world into the house<br/>
just in case they want it one day.  So we keep what they enjoy and purge<br/>
what they don&#39;t.  Morgaine doesn&#39;t wake up one day and find her dolls or<br/>
barbies are gone; I say, &quot;Look; the Barbie box is too full to fit under<br/>
your bed.  How are we going to make it fit? &quot;  &quot;There&#39;s nowhere to put<br/>
this toy in your room.  What can we get rid of to make a place for it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Just use it once at a family party and then <br/>
send it off to the Goodwill Store.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If she asks about it, will you tell her you got rid of it, tell her it<br/>
broke, or tell her you still have it?  I just can&#39;t lie, and I&#39;m not<br/>
very good with fudging the truth either.  <br/>
I have a friend who keeps everything.  When she tries to have a yard<br/>
sale and her kids don&#39;t want to get rid of anything, she says &quot;OK.&quot;  You<br/>
can&#39;t walk through her house.  Most of the stuff sits untouched.  The<br/>
stairs are full, the living room is full, the bedroom is full.  The<br/>
basement has just enough space for a laundry basket.  The kids have a<br/>
few favorite toys they play with but mostly ignore the other stuff.  I<br/>
can&#39;t live like that, neither can my husband, and my kids aren&#39;t happy<br/>
like that either.  When Morgaine was a baby I kept everything &quot;just in<br/>
case.&quot;  I finally realized she didn&#39;t play with anything because there<br/>
was just too much.  When she was about three (a few months after we<br/>
moved into our trailer, and before she was even sharing a room with her<br/>
brother) I decided to take everything out of her room that was lying in<br/>
pieces or usually not played with.  I put them into five large garbage<br/>
bags in the shed.  I told her she had more stuff than she could take<br/>
care of, and we were going to put it away for a while.  She helped me<br/>
fill the bags.  Since that day she has asked for three things out of<br/>
those bags.  She knows the bags are still there in the shed, because I<br/>
haven&#39;t gotten around to hauling them out and going through them.<br/>
(Incidentally my shed has about 4 square feet of empty floorspace in<br/>
front of the door.  The rest is crammed full.)  That was very freeing to<br/>
me - she was much happier and played more with her things and was less<br/>
bored all the time.  She watched less TV.  She could find the things she<br/>
wanted.  It was a joy.  It&#39;s no different than getting rid of clothes<br/>
when her dresser is too full to close the drawers; she chooses the<br/>
clothes she wants to get rid of, and usually finds clothes she&#39;d<br/>
forgotten she had.  We do the same.  I can&#39;t count the loads I have<br/>
taken to the goodwill.  Now I can walk into the little storage porch we<br/>
have and see what I have for food.  I don&#39;t end up tossing stuff in<br/>
there.  If there was an emergency I could even walk through there to get<br/>
out of the house.  We keep our small appliances out there and our<br/>
canning supplies, a little freezer, and some gardening tools.  Square<br/>
footwise, the kids have as much space as the adults do.  Control is<br/>
necessary sometimes; it is not always a bad thing.  I could have a house<br/>
full of toys people have bought them and they don&#39;t play with.  I<br/>
suppose I could replace their beds with shelves and they could sleep on<br/>
our couches.  I could even replace my bed with shelves and sleep on the<br/>
couch with them, or on the floor since the couches don&#39;t pull out.<br/>
Anything can be taken to an extreme, both too much control as well as<br/>
too little.  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think receiving a walker would be a diff. matter for me. They are<br/>
dangerous in my books. Fortunately here in Canada they were just banned and<br/>
can&#39;t be sold in any way now so even if I had another baby I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
to deal with it. I would be tempted to have a talk with the giver who might<br/>
not have been aware of the issues aurrounding walkers. Then again, I guess I<br/>
could stick it in the basement until they showed up at the house and stick<br/>
the baby in it at that time for show.<br/>
With guests there&#39;d be lots of supervision. It would likely be disasembled<br/>
and tossed first chance I got though.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I took the original poster as meaning one of those things you push that has<br/>
wheels and helps the child walk. When she said it moved too fast and the<br/>
baby got hurt, that&#39;s what I was thinking of. Can&#39;t see where the ones you<br/>
stick the baby in moves too fast.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, all 4 of my kids had the regular stick the baby in walkers and I<br/>
never had any problems. Of course I never had any stairs to worry about<br/>
either and never had any instances of them even looking like they would tip<br/>
over. And naturally I was always right there too.<br/>

Can you ask your mom to store some things at her house and then you can <br/>
switch boxes of toys in and out from time to time to keep them circulating?<br/>
<br/>
Would your parents buy you a storage shed (if you have a yard) or pay for a <br/>
storage unit?  that might be a good gift, so you can keep more toys and just <br/>
not keep them all in one place.  (Ah, you have a shed:-=- I put them into five <br/>
large garbage<br/>

<br/>
Holly&#39;s playing with something that hasn&#39;t been played with for years.  It&#39;s <br/>
a pattern toy she&#39;s never really played with herself and she&#39;s having a blast. <br/>
 We found it when we went to look for yarn in the sewing room.  <br/>

If you think of them as resources and learning tools instead of just space <br/>

<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only choices, though.  Maybe there&#39;s a way to make a table <br/>
of a stack of xerox boxes with lids, and cycle toys back and forth that way.  <br/>
Can you store anything under the trailer?  Like in a box taped shut, wrapped in <br/>
heavy trash-bag?<br/>

won&#39;t ASK later if they see the kids using it first. Gift givers like <br/>
to get some feedback that the kids enjoyed the gift, that&#39;s why they <br/>
ask. If you make sure they get that feedback, then you won&#39;t be put <br/>
into the position of having them ask.<br/>
<br/>
The walker is a special situation and special situations make bad <br/>
precedent. The kids aren&#39;t going to get injured by stuffed rabbits - so <br/>
keep them around long enough for them to have a chance to bring them <br/>
out and play with them in front of the the gift givers or take some <br/>
pictures of them playing with them and send them to the gift givers or <br/>
save them to take on a visit to the gift-giver&#39;s house.<br/>

have issues with them!  (Note the smile that preceded<br/>

<br/>
Seriously, though; I know I sound ungrateful.  For me<br/>
it&#39;s more an issue of waste, frugality, etc.  It&#39;s one<br/>
I should let go of; since I know they know we are<br/>
going to get rid of things if the kids don&#39;t like them and we don&#39;t <br/>
have room, and still choose to spend<br/>
so much money on things the kids haven&#39;t shown interest in, then no <br/>
big deal.  <br/>
<br/>
I do make a point to express to them when the kids<br/>
really enjoy something.  I&#39;ve worked harder at this<br/>
the last year, and I see my mother&#39;s gifts evolving<br/>
into more appropriately chosen items.  Maybe if I make<br/>
them all feel more appreciated, whether that appreciation is genuine <br/>
or lightly enhanced, the same will hold true for others; as they <br/>
feel more appreciated they may not feel the need to give the kids so <br/>
much, or might spend more time with the kids if they feel more <br/>
appreciated.  I hadn&#39;t looked at it quite that way before.  <br/>

&gt; &gt;  Like a monthly<br/>

&gt; &gt; It&#39;s funny you should mention this, as I was just considering<br/>
&gt; &gt; something like it, but having the kids help and doing a<br/>
&gt; &gt; mini &quot;newsletter&quot; format.  Thought it might be a lot of fun for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids as well as helping the family feel more at ease with our<br/>
&gt; &gt; lifestyle, and also keep them in &quot;anecdotes.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone done this?  I was afraid it might seem somehow either<br/>
&gt; &gt; pushy or over the top; neither phrase is conveying precisely what I<br/>
&gt; &gt; mean but I hope it gives the gist.  I was wondering what kind of<br/>
&gt; &gt; info you include if you do?  I was maybe a half page of text per<br/>
&gt; &gt; kiddo and some pics, as well as a page for each of them if they<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to include their own separate drawings or letters or whatever.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was thinking of copying and printing it and mailing one to each<br/>
&gt; &gt; parent and the great grandparents also, maybe once a month.<br/>
