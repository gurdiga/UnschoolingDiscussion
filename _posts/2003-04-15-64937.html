I like hearing things like this.  My son, who is 8, has been wearing a<br/>
bra for the past year (I bought it for him and he stuffs it with the<br/>
plastic tops from the Bionicle containers).  He wears it to bed, to the<br/>
beach, out to lunch, everywhere.  He&#39;s gotten used to stares from<br/>
people, but he is protected by me, his dad and his papa from others who<br/>
want to comment.<br/>
<br/>
When he was 2 1/2 he asked me if I would make him a sparkly dress (we<br/>
were watching a lot of Fred and Ginger movies at the time and he wanted<br/>
to be Ginger Rogers).  We went to the fabric store and he picked out the<br/>
material and the pattern.  It was a beautiful dress! and he wore it for<br/>
a few years - then I made him a new one and his sister wore the old one.<br/>
<br/>
At a party one day (Robin - son - was about 4) I was talking to a male<br/>
teacher friend about unschooling, Robin&#39;s dress, etc....  He stared at<br/>
me in disbelief, I thought - oh boy, here it comes.  Then he said very<br/>
quietly, &quot;I wish my mom had made me a sparkly dress.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Made me glad that we are doing what we are for our children.<br/>

Dittoing this as well. Mine went through the pink, blue and purple hair. {even the then 2 year old} I liked the purple the best. It was semi-perm but because they had naturally blonde hair, and the two oldest&#39;s hair had a previous chemical {I&#39;m a cosmetologist and streaked their hair for them} it grabbed. They wore it for a while but got tired of it and I got it out for them. They may try it again later, if so it&#39;s cool with me. There are worst things they could do....<br/>
