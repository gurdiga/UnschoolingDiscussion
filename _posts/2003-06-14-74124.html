<br/>
I&#39;ve had a couple of private e-mails lately, NOT from people on thislist (I <br/>
don&#39;t think; it didn&#39;t seem) which were somewhat cranky about things like (for <br/>
a fictional example):I thought unschooling should create great musicians, and <br/>
ever since I&#39;ve been letting the kids pick their own music curriculum, I... <br/>
wah wah wah.<br/>
<br/>
So the example about kids not tearing things up just struck me in a painful <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
My edginess. Sorry.<br/>

of those days myself {namely today} AND I completely understand <br/>
things need to be clear when we state things so that others <br/>
understand. If you misunderstood there is a good chance someone else <br/>
did too. Feel free anytime ask for a re-explaination or to question <br/>
what I meant, and I&#39;ll do my best to give it to ya. :-)<br/>
