Funny...but totally ignores the existence of UNschooling homeschoolers. Duh.<br/>

Oh My!!!! You would have to be sent to the office. It must be below the knee<br/>
and have enough room for two extra people!!!<br/>

just the kids and I. The last conference it was just me and the kids, Jalen <br/>
was only one y.o. at the time. It&#39;s totally doable!!! And fun...but then I am <br/>
the adventurous type. It&#39;s that ENFP thing. :)<br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to add that traveling with the kids can be so much fun if <br/>
planned right.  The kids and I, I had 5 at the time) drove from Texas to <br/>
Alaska and we had a ball!  We had lots of drawing and coloring supplies with <br/>
small lap desks for each of the kids.  I packed loads of easy, not too <br/>
messy, snacks and drinks, small toys, etc.  We sang a lot, made lots of <br/>
pitstops at parks and interesting places.  Probably the best thing I had was <br/>
the TV and VR.  Ours is built into our conversion van but you can buy cables <br/>
to convert the power and hook up a small one from home.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, plan lots of extra goof time.  Getting out and walking around <br/>
made the trip a pleasure.  I made sure to point out lots of scenery, natural <br/>
and otherwise, to the kids so we had lots of great talks on the way there.<br/>
<br/>
You can do it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541675368">&quot;Hey, me too!! We washed cars in dresses, we roller-skated in dresses, <br/>
etc...then someone finally figured out that it was racier to roller-skate in a<br/>
 skirt <br/>
than in pants so we were allowed to wear CULLOTTES which had to reach below <br/>
our knees. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
OH my gosh. Same here. The ONLY time I wore pants in childhood, was when we were at our cabin in the Prince Williams Sound and for the once a week PE class (and it had to be slacks, never jeans for PE).<br/>
<br/>
No jewelry, no cut hair, no makeup. <br/>
The cult mentality and brainwashing goes deep when you&#39;re raised that way. Thank goodness I had a very strong will! Always considered rebellious by nature, but that&#39;s how I survived with my sense of self intact.<br/>
<br/>
I never wore much jewelry until the last couple of years. Unschooling and leaving the family church have brought out my true colors in amazing ways!! Look  out world....I&#39;m gonna reach up and pull the stars down to decorate myself with!! <br/>
