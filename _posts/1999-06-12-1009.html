No, not at all.  No record keeping here.  You are required to test or <br/>
portfolio evaluate every year, but the results are yours, please don&#39;t pass <br/>
them on to the authorities, if they ask on the intent form you get, they are <br/>
out of line.  That&#39;s probably the only must do.  <br/>
<br/>
The law alludes to teaching xxxxx and having xxxx hours but there is no <br/>
vehicle in the law that allows them to check anything.  Really, which I&#39;ve <br/>
never heard of happening in this state, if they did come and say show me what <br/>
the law requires you&#39;d only have to show that the took the annual test or <br/>
have an evaluation.  I&#39;m not sure they have the right to look at the results, <br/>
just that it was taken.  Also, the 6 yo doesn&#39;t have to be listed on your <br/>
annual intent form you mail to the district.  Just the 8 yo.  And, the 6 yo <br/>
isn&#39;t required to be tested or evaluated until age 8.  Compulsory attendance <br/>
is 8 in this state.  No one&#39;s required to send their kids to school until <br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425856483">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question.  My children are 6 & 8 yrs. old.  They would be<br/>
finishing up Kindergarten & 2nd grade if in school.  Since making the<br/>
decision to homeschool and unenrolling my oldest(son)from 1st grade<br/>
after 1 month, I have not kept any records.  I have boxes of artwork<br/>
they&#39;ve done.  I have a few workbooks around that they do from time to<br/>
time(less and less as time goes on).  We go on lots of &quot;fieldtrips&quot;(as<br/>
many as I can afford), a trip to Seattle the other day.  My dd, the<br/>
6yr.old, mostly plays all day long.  We basicly do whatever tickles her<br/>
fancy for the moment, and yesterday it was playing outside in the sun<br/>
with waterslides and waterballoons.  They both love puns, riddles,<br/>
jokes, and rhymes.<br/>
	My ds is totally into collecting comic books all of a sudden.  I made a<br/>
point of taking him to a comic book store in Seattle, which was his<br/>
favorite part of our trip.  Yesterday, he read all 4 of his new comic<br/>
books.  He tells me all about Spiderman and superman.  It is incredible<br/>
that he can read them so fast.  He reads books to his little sister all<br/>
the time to.  The comic book collection has just replaces his obsession<br/>
for Stars Wars, but since he was a toddler he has had a fascination for<br/>
things sci-fi(Alien flicks, etc.,).  O.K. so to give you an idea of what<br/>
we do.<br/>
	My question:  Am I supposed to keep records for the &quot;authorities&quot; or<br/>
something?  I am in WA state.  I have no clue how to go about doing<br/>
this.  Is it hard?  Is it required?  Any help/advice/suggestions would<br/>
be sooooo apreciated.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

You have several choices here in WA. First - you don&#39;t need to do ANYTHING at <br/>
all, until your child is 8yo.  At 8, they require an evaluation by a teacher, <br/>
OR a standardized test (which noone but you sees - they want you to keep it <br/>
in your &quot;private&quot; records) OR you can be supervised by a teacher who meets <br/>
with your child for a minimum of 1 hour a week.  This can be the way to go if <br/>
you have supportive relatives who are teachers, willing to sign a statement <br/>
saying the kids are doing fine...<br/>

Mary, just for clarification...  I don&#39;t see anything in the law that negates <br/>
the need for testing or evaluation annually if you are using the *teacher <br/>
supervision* option under the four ways to qualify for homeschooling in Wa... <br/>
 Do you mean that if you use that option that they should write the <br/>
evaluation automatically?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that was my understanding.  If you use the teacher supervised option <br/>
then the teacher should be the one to do an end of the year evaluation.  <br/>
Makes sense to me... although we don&#39;t go this route.<br/>
