<div id="ygrps-yiv-712620284">My senior advisor, a high ranking officer in the Naval Reserve, tried to <br/>
get me to join the Navy after graduation from college.<br/>
&quot;Susan, there are many fine careers for women Physical Educators in the <br/>
Navy.&quot;  and then he added, as a sort of mumbled aside, &quot;besides, you <br/>
could use the discipline.&quot;  He was a wonderful man and I loved him <br/>
dearly. Didn&#39;t join though, they wouldn&#39;t let me fly planes - too short, <br/>
bad eyes. Funny thing about folks who &quot;need discipline&quot; -- they rarely <br/>
go looking for it! lol<br/>
<br/>
My step-son went through basic training with the Navy - he said he liked <br/>
it. Any Marines or Air Force folks out there? Dad was a Marine, favorite <br/>
uncle flew for the Air Force during Vietnam.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
