<br/>
&gt; When I started this list I was so sure it didn&#39;t need monitors<br/>
&gt; and listmamas because surely unschoolers were &quot;different,&quot; they could<br/>
&gt; find and maintain balance and kindness and a higher purpose, couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; they?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think, unfortunately, that unschoolers are as human and flawed as everyone<br/>
else. As a group with only one thing in common, we are no more or less able<br/>
to find and maintain balance and kindness and a higher purpose than cat<br/>
breeders, dog sledders, whale watchers, bottle-feeders, c-section<br/>
recoverers, vegans, or any other group. Mortals R Us. :P<br/>
<br/>
Now as to what to do with this list, I can&#39;t vote on that. It would be<br/>
lovely to see it become a haven for unschooling families in need, but as I<br/>
think we can all see by now, that won&#39;t happen without some form of be-nice<br/>
moderation. Since I&#39;m not willing to put in the work as moderator, I can&#39;t<br/>
tell you that&#39;s the course you should take. :)<br/>
<br/>
I can also completely understand why you don&#39;t want HEM&#39;s name anywhere near<br/>
this list as it is now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not having a fun autumn 2001, either, and I&#39;m sorry this list is adding<br/>
to your unhappiness even more than it&#39;s adding to mine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL, Pam! But seriously, what you wrote here was important in helping <br/>
me decide to make this a moderated list. Thanks for putting it so <br/>
succinctly, old friend. And thanks for hanging in here...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well... what can I say? We created this monster, and we&#39;ll stand by <br/>
it, even if we do need to find a nice secure cage to keep it in... <br/>
&lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bad analogy, I know. I think I need to go eat or something, getting <br/>
weak - or at least weakminded... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
