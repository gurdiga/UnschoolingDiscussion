&lt;&lt; Do you mean to tell me they were not contacted by ANY <br/>
 unschoolers? This is one of those things that started to make me doubt <br/>
 myself, then it just made me angry!<br/>
     Thanks for letting me vent! Any way I&#39;d like to hear if anyone else had <br/>
 any thoughts on the show. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Well, they were contacted by me.  But they didn&#39;t call!  Told hubby he was <br/>
going to have to watch the kids and everything!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I missed the show now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054389620">Hi,<br/>
I saw the Oprah show yesterday and taped the homeschooling segment.<br/>
The first family I felt were all right, and probably representative of<br/>
a lot of homeschooling families, but I didn&#39;t think they made a great<br/>
impression. Then the girl who was a former homeschooler ... she had a<br/>
point, and I could understand that she was speaking about her<br/>
experience, but I did NOT agree with her statement that it&#39;s taken her<br/>
FOUR years to be a teacher therefore parents can&#39;t do it. I think<br/>
after she actually starts teaching, she will realize it&#39;s not four<br/>
years of college that will make her a good teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Also it frightens me that parents feel so inadequate to teach their<br/>
children how to live and be adults. If you can&#39;t be a good teacher<br/>
without college, how can you POSSIBLY be a good parent without some<br/>
sort of parenting college? After all, parents have more influence than<br/>
teachers.  The second family - the ones with four kids who went to<br/>
college - were much better. They didn&#39;t have much time to talk,<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
When Oprah did the show with that Dr. who suggested eliminating high<br/>
school, I sent her an email, explaining that I agreed with him and<br/>
that I had home/unschooled and was now a functional, well-adjusted<br/>
adult.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be sending her another email, however,<br/>
because I believe we&#39;d all be better off if we left homeschooling off<br/>
of television and educated people about it through other mediums.<br/>
<br/>
As I watched the show I kept thinking back to Jerry Manders&#39;, &quot;Four<br/>
Arguments of the Elimination of Television&quot; in which he writes about<br/>
how television is inherently terrible at conveying the ESSENCE of<br/>
things. If you have the book, you can refer to pages 278-279, when he<br/>
talks about the news story about a marsh that was in danger of being<br/>
made into a development. &quot;A whole world of sensory information [about<br/>
the marsh] has been abandoned, and yet it is in this world that real<br/>
understanding of marshes exist. And without the understanding who can<br/>
care about the marsh? .... Images of mud and reeds do not inspire the<br/>
mind....&quot; His point is that in order for people to care about the<br/>
marsh, they need to EXPERIENCE it, not watch it on television. What&#39;s<br/>
worse, people see something on television and think they know all they<br/>
need to know about it; they are under the mistaken impression that<br/>
they DO understand, when in fact they don&#39;t.  That inhibits many<br/>
people from seeking further information outside of television. And<br/>
this is bad, bad news for alternative movements.<br/>
<br/>
Later, on page 324 he writes, &quot;When dealing with primitive peoples,<br/>
objective events such as hunting, building, fighting or dancing are<br/>
easier to convey through television than subjective details of<br/>
qualities of experience, ways of mind, alternative perceptions. The<br/>
latter qualities, which form the heart of life for primitive people,<br/>
are dropped out in favor of the former.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This applies to us, too. Whenever I see a story about homeschooling on<br/>
television, there are images of mom sitting around the table with the<br/>
kids, the kids getting their schoolbooks, mom asking the kids<br/>
questions. This would not encourage ME to homeschool my kids. But this<br/>
is what television people are looking for because this is ALL THEY CAN<br/>
SHOW. They don&#39;t know that unschooling isn&#39;t about what you can<br/>
necessarily see on paper. It&#39;s about development, growth, independence<br/>
and love of learning - none of which can be conveyed on television in<br/>
a 2 minute video segment.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion,<br/>
