I often spend time browsing through Borders.com looking for interesting books to see if my library has them available, and I came across some books by Bill Bryson entitled &quot;The Mother Tongue: English And How It Got That Way,&quot; &quot;Made In America,&quot; and &quot;Notes From A Small Island&quot; about linguistics. I was just wondering if you&#39;ve read them and what you thought of them?<br/>
 <br/>
I share a similar interest to yours in this area, although up until now I&#39;ve never really done all that much with it. You&#39;ve inspired me to do more/learn more about this interest among others that I have. <br/>

I have that first one and have read probably half of it (not in <br/>
straight-through order).   I love his stuff, though, and you might be able to get them used <br/>
and afford all three!<br/>
