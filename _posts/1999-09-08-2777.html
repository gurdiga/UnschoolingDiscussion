 </span></blockquote>  Jill, I love reading the accounts of your days!  it gives me some <br/>
great ideas. (i need to start one of those little notebooks).  We&#39;ve <br/>
been doing the nature thing lately too.  We have five acres and this <br/>
is really the first time we had a chance to explore the outer <br/>
boundaries from a little different perspective.  Sterling found a <br/>
pheasant feather and magpie feather, we saw several wildflowers in <br/>
bloom, collected a few pine cones, and saw a spider web in the grass <br/>
with a perfect funnel web.  he even had to bring his Dad back to the <br/>
spot to show him when he got home from work.  course all these things <br/>
prompted other related activities in learning more about what we <br/>
found and saw.  About a half mile from us, there are cattails growing <br/>
in the ditch by the road.  Today we went and cut some of them to <br/>
bring home.  then we had to find out if they dry better upside-down <br/>
or straight up.  you&#39;re adventure with the leaves reminded me of how <br/>
i miss the foliage out here but also gave me the idea to email my <br/>
sister in NH to collect some colorful leaves for us before it is too <br/>
late.  THANK YOU!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23904398">Today was &quot;nature day&quot; at our house.  After work/school this morning, the <br/>
kids and I headed outside. We had to stop at a printing shop and then to drop <br/>
off work at my client&#39;s house.  On the way back home, we went to a park.  <br/>
They did some serious playing then.  That&#39;s P.E. class, right?  Amy practiced <br/>
walking around the perimeter of the playground, sparking a discussion of <br/>
shapes, corners, and balance.  She also discovered wild mushrooms growing, <br/>
which we need to identify.  I collected various leaves and we did some <br/>
matching games:  i.e. Find another leaf that looks like this one.  We <br/>
observed how the trees grow, some all in one piece and others splitting into <br/>
what looks like 2 or even 4 trunks.  We observed the percentage of split <br/>
trees to single trees; and compared amounts of oaks vs. others (I still have <br/>
to identify the others).  On library day we&#39;ll check on the identify of the <br/>
trees and mushrooms.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind my sharing my days with you all.  It helps me stay <br/>
accountable for what I do, and I personally need that very much.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we also stopped at the bank today where I inquired about opening a bank <br/>
account for myself.  I let the children sit and listen to the various types <br/>
of accounts and what some of the rules were.  I got information on starting <br/>
accounts for them also and I think we&#39;ll do that with their next birthday <br/>
moneys.<br/>
<br/>
Love you all,<br/>
<br/>

samples from each plant we could find.  We put them all on a posterboard<br/>
with clear packing tape labeling each as we went.  It left us with a map of<br/>
the yard plants and trees.  It was really fun.  The kids also ironed leaf<br/>
samples between wax paper pieces as a wall hanging.  It was a neat<br/>
experience and we identified nearly 95% of the trees on our 1 acre lot.  <br/>

Did you just use a regular ole iron? Can you do this with flowers too? TIA<br/>

Yes we did.  I would assume flowers would also work the wax paper seals<br/>
them off from the air and slows the breakdown of the plant.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry it took me so long to get back to you - I just got back to my<br/>
computer today for the first time in nearly a week!<br/>

One can do the same sort of thing with clear contact paper, as well, without<br/>
the &quot;heat factor&quot;. Also, we&#39;ve found the contact paper to be more durable<br/>
than the waxed paper, and have made a number of bookmarks this way.  You&#39;ll<br/>
find the clear contact paper anywhere you&#39;d find the patterned kind.. and<br/>
can sometimes find it in 8-yd rolls.  Classroom Connection (formerly<br/>
Re-Print) has it in 25 and (if I recall correctly) 75-yd rolls, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
