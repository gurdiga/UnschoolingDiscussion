<br>Kerry, this is wonderful. &nbsp;I have always been met with wide eyes when i say 
<br>my child (age 3) just goes to bed when he is tired. &nbsp;This may be 8pm 
<br>(rarely), 9 or 9:30 or..... I explain that he spends time at night with his 
<br>dad who works a long day, and why should he go to bed without a nice family 
<br>experience? &nbsp;I love your idea about them having quiet time in their room 
<br>until they get the urge to lie down and call it a day. This fits perfectly 
<br>with unschooling.
<br>
<br>PS when is someone going to come up with an acronym or short form for 
<br>unschooling???? :o)
