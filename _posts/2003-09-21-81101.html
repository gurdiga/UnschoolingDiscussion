1)mother´s milk from breast<br/>
2)mother´s milk from bottle or other feeding device<br/>
3)donated mother´s milk<br/>
4)goat´s milk with folic acid added<br/>
5) formula<br/>
<br/>
Basically, formula is cow´s milk(which is meant for baby cow´s) changed a little. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051525858">when my milk dried up on me, and my youngest was only six months old, <br/>
instead of formula, we did goat&#39;s milk. She did just fine on it!<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC who never did overly lactate<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136556952">Or, look at it this way: Goat milk is easier to digest and less <br/>
allergenic than cow&#39;s milk or soy milk --which is the base for <br/>
non-dairy formulas. So, if you cannot BF, might as well go with goat <br/>
milk.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I did neither. After I stopped nursing, I gave my kids <br/>
fortified rice milk because it is waaaaaaaaaaaaay more hypoallegenic <br/>
than goat milk. Goat yogurt has become &quot;de rigueur&quot; for most of our <br/>
cooking needs and I use Meyenberg Goat Milk for my coffee --became <br/>
sensitive to CM maybe after having Evan, certainly after Aidan was born.<br/>
