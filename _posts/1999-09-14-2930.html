<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171119282">Hello all.  This week I am walking to work in the mornings.  My car needs a <br/>
new clutch.  The past two mornings, the kids have wanted to come with me, so <br/>
I brought them along to the church and put them to work.  After work on <br/>
Monday I took them to the library and we hung out there for quite a while.  <br/>
Today, I left for work ahead of them, and told them to follow at their own <br/>
pace.  I gave them a scavenger hunt list of things to look for along the way. <br/>
 This way I got about 1/2 hour of work in before they got there, and I felt <br/>
it was somewhat educational in the sense that they had to read, observe, and <br/>
work together as a team.  Okay, okay.... so maybe I&#39;m stretching it just a <br/>
bit.  At least we&#39;re getting our exercise!<br/>
<br/>
Love to you all,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you really feel this was stretching things?  This is what schools do all<br/>
the time.   Course it could also be called lots of fun, but that&#39;s beside<br/>
the point. :)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand what you think you are stretching.  But then I&#39;ve not<br/>
slept alot lately. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

WHOA! I don&#39;t think you&#39;re &quot;stretching it&quot; at all!  This is an *excellent*<br/>
idea!! Thanks for the tips!! :-)<br/>
