<div id="ygrps-yiv-194086899">Hi y&#39;all,<br/>
<br/>
The holidays are just one of many times that we all run into the <br/>
critics. People who are not happy unless you are exactly like them, yet <br/>
complain how miserable they are. People who never <br/>
listened, or saw any thing that&#39;s different as real. I&#39;ve seen many <br/>
suggestions on and off the list about how to deal with them, but none <br/>
yet have seemed to address why they do it, or why we <br/>
feel a need to defend ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, any kind of comeback that&#39;s hurtful, rude, smarty, just smiling <br/>
and ignoring, or makes the other person feel like they&#39;ve hit your <br/>
nerve and put you on the defensive, is <br/>
counterproductive to your cause. (Of course all families are different <br/>
and what might be seen as rude to one is just humor to another. I mean <br/>
something that you know that the other person will <br/>
take as flippancy or rudeness)<br/>
<br/>
I think what anytime people criticize you it&#39;s not about you at all. <br/>
It&#39;s always really all about them. It&#39;s about how they feel about what <br/>
you&#39;re doing. Treat it as though it was their problem <br/>
because it is only theirs. Yeah, it feels like a problem for you when <br/>
they start in again, trying to get a reaction. Try not to take it on as <br/>
your own. Nobody can make you feel bad without your <br/>
consent. I don&#39;t mean you have to ignore them, but you don&#39;t have to <br/>
play by their rules either. Maybe there is no magic phrase to use, but <br/>
if you are feeling different about the whole concept <br/>
of criticism it can change what you do say and do about it.<br/>
<br/>
When others have a problem with what I&#39;m doing, I might say again <br/>
nicely that &quot;We are having a fine time and the unschooling (or <br/>
whatever) is really working for us&quot;. I won&#39;t go on the <br/>
defensive, because that puts them in control of the situation. Their <br/>
feelings are real, but they are not about anything you are doing. They <br/>
are all about what they&#39;ve done, and experienced in <br/>
their own life. Anything you say or do will always be filtered through <br/>
their own experiences. That&#39;s why their problem with what you do can <br/>
only belong to them.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta get going now. Just a start of a new thought, what do you all <br/>
think? <br/>

I agree with you 100% . . . and I also think, misguided though it may be, <br/>
people think they are really trying to help you. I guess there can be such a <br/>
variety of reasons why relatives and others make these types of comments <br/>
ranging from jealousy, longing, pain from their own experience, etc. I do <br/>
think all of it stems from fear. Basically I think our emotions come from two <br/>
places. . . fear or love, and unfortunately lots of times people are living <br/>
in a place of fear, ergo all the control. <br/>
<br/>
I do like your suggestions of remaining clear of purpoes in our conversations <br/>
with loved ones, and not getting into their fear, etc. because it is really <br/>
about them as you said.<br/>

thanks for the added thoughs. I agree that some people may think they <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sounds similar to my experience. I also have run into many public <br/>
school folks who say they could never homeschool, and then proceed to <br/>
complain about how much trouble their school is. How their child is <br/>
miserable, how unfair the teacher or other kids are, how stifling, on <br/>
and on. They say they could never homeschool because (choose one or all <br/>
of the following:) they&#39;re not organized enough, coundn&#39;t work that <br/>
hard, that they don&#39;t know enough, that the kids need socializing, or <br/>
(the saddest &quot;reason&quot; of all) that they couldn&#39;t stand being around <br/>
their kids that much. I do mention that I am not really that organized, <br/>
and that I find unschooling much easier that fighting a system. Mostly <br/>
I just say that the real beauty of homeschooling is that you can work <br/>
it out to fit your own families needs, and do what&#39;s best the way you <br/>
see it. Change things around to use what works and throw out what <br/>
doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s so flexible, and very individual. Sometimes I get in <br/>
a word about a new version of socialization too.<br/>
<br/>
I think many people are afraid of the idea that they alone would be <br/>
responsible for teaching their kids everything. I tell them it dosn&#39;t <br/>
really have to be like that. I am learning with my kids, and they are <br/>
part of the process.<br/>
<br/>
anyway I&#39;m rambling again.<br/>
