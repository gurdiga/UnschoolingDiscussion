<div><br><br>LOCAL&nbsp; STUDENTS WIN IN NASA NATIONAL COMPETITION<br><br>Local 
Homeschool Team Wins First Place in Design A Mission To Mars (Grades<br>&nbsp; - 
8) Competition<br><br>North Ridgeville, Berea, Elyria, Ohio, March 26, 2001 - 
Justin Fuelling (N.<br>Ridgeville), Joel Fuelling (N. Ridgeville), Garret 
Shidaker (Elyria), And<br>Robert Laeng (Berea) of the Fuelling Homeschool Team 
have been awarded First<br>Place in the NASA Student Involvement Program&#39;s 
(NSIP&#39;s)<br>2000-2001competition.&nbsp; These local homeschool students are 
being honored for<br>the work on designing a manned mission to Mars that would 
answer the<br>question; Is there, or was there ever, water on Mars?&nbsp; The 
students did<br>extensive research using all forms of media to design a way to 
get to Mars<br>and perform<br>research on the surface of the planet.&nbsp; The 
students spent 45 hours together<br>learning about Mars, researching current and 
necessary technology, and<br>developing a step by step research mission that 
would drill into the<br>surface, collect soil samples, and analyze the gathered 
data to prove the<br>current and<br>or past existence of water on Mars.&nbsp; 
Answering such a question would open<br>the door for future manned research 
missions, terra-forming, and ultimately<br>colonizing Mars!<br><br>NSIP is a 
national program that stimulates math, science, technology, and<br>geography 
excellence through 5 competition categories designed for students<br>in grades 3 
- 12.&nbsp; The Competitions are Design an Mission To Mars, My Planet<br>Earth, 
Watching Earth Change, Aeronautics and Space Science Journalism, and<br>Flight 
Opportunities.<br><br>Over 4200 students submitted more than 1000 entries to the 
competition.<br>Students engage in research that promotes 
critical-thinking,<br>problem-solving, communication, and collaboration skills. 
Student entries<br>are judged at NASA Centers by teams of scientists, engineers, 
educators,<br>journalists, and other professionals, who select first, 
second,&nbsp;&nbsp; and<br>third-place winners.&nbsp; The Fuelling Homeschool 
Team was judged and<br>selected at NASA Glenn Research Center.&nbsp; There award 
is a presentation by<br>NASA including the presentation of first place 
plaques.&nbsp; All 6 national<br>first place winners will go up against each 
other for a trip to Space Camp!<br><br>NASA Headquarters will officially 
announce the names of all NSIP winners in<br>Mid-April and post the names on the 
NSIP website<br>(<a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://education.nasa.gov">http://education.nasa.gov</a>).<br><br>&quot;NSIP is 
an important part of NASA&#39;s efforts to enhance K-12 learning<br>because it 
offers students the thrill of discovery and achievement,&quot;&nbsp; says<br>Lynn 
Marra, NSIP Program Officer at NASA Headquarters.&nbsp; &quot;We are proud 
to<br>honor their success and have them on the NASA 
team.&quot;<br><br><br></div></html></div>
