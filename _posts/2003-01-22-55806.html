<div id="ygrps-yiv-75886932">Hey ya&#39;ll;<br/>
I thought I&#39;d have a million responses to my question about J &quot;trying&quot;<br/>
middle school again this year! Thanks Mary and Brenda for your input, but I<br/>
am still floundering about letting her decide to do this again. Yes, it<br/>
might only last another 5 days. We have had so much big change this year,<br/>
and I wonder if this request from her is just response to the changes we&#39;ve<br/>
already had. What do I say?  I feel that she&#39;s desperate for friends here,<br/>
so is willing to even go to school to fill that need. She has a ton of<br/>
activities, but I don&#39;t think that 1 friend to be really close to the way<br/>
girls seem to be at this age (13). Yes, I get the unschooling philosophy<br/>
that says let them try, but what about the rest of the family? What about<br/>
what we need?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192672680">Have you read The Teenage Liberation handbook?  It has a nice chapter <br/>
on the subject---pointing out that the &quot;socialization&quot; of the <br/>
classroom is not what the social mythology claims(there are other <br/>
books and sources out ther---just don&#39;t have them on the top of my <br/>
head right now).  How was your classroom experience?  If it was not <br/>
pleasnt share those experiences with her--alot and with true feelings <br/>
or share experiences you observed of others who were not having a <br/>
good experience.It it help balance the social mythology that our kids <br/>
are bombarded with everywhere(movies, T V, books, and pressure by <br/>
well meaning but misguided relatives, etc.).  One point that hit home <br/>
for my kids was if the classroom experience is so great why is there <br/>
so many venues trying to pump kids up---if it was so wonderful the <br/>
abundance of propoganda would not exist.   Many folks are very, very  <br/>
lonely in the midst of plenty in the classroom setting---it is not <br/>
really set up to support friendships.  While it important to support <br/>
our children in their decisions, all such important and life altering <br/>
decisions should be made with full information.  In this case the <br/>
info readily available is very one sided in support of the classroom; <br/>
one needs to search out and do some careful introspection to bring <br/>
balance to the subject.  The classroom works for some, for some it is <br/>
truly wonderful---for some it truly misable---for some just not the <br/>
best possible option of the way to invest their time and emotional <br/>
energy.  It most certainly can be a life altering experience, not <br/>
only for the &quot;student&quot; but for the entire family and should be <br/>
approached with careful consideration.  In our family we consider all <br/>
members to be of equal importance and base our decisions not only how <br/>
it will effect one but how it will effect others and the group as a <br/>
whole. And so I believe you are right to be concerned as to how it <br/>
will effect the family; I also believe you have equal right to make a <br/>
choice as to what you are willing to involve yourself with as your <br/>
children.<br/>
I could say much more but have probably said enough already to get <br/>
myself in trouble with some.  This is an issue we talked about at <br/>
great length in our family and have seen come up in the homeschool <br/>
community.  For what it is worth my son went through the same <br/>
struggle but after careful research and much soul searching decided <br/>
to remain home (with a new appreciation for it).  As for loneliness, <br/>
he stopped looking for a homeschooler is own age and started to focus <br/>
his attention on his areas of interest and has found that friendship <br/>
is more than folks banding together to try to survive a miserable <br/>
experience and that real friends come in a variety of ages.  Really <br/>
how many friends do you have that are within nine months of your <br/>
age?  The  aged/grade level based classroom is an artifically <br/>
contrived environment that does not reflect &quot;real life&quot; or &quot;adult&quot; <br/>
life.  His life is becoming fuller and richer each day and he is <br/>
truly preparing himslf for his future now instead of having to <br/>
figuire all this out after &quot;graduation&quot; when there are so many other <br/>
big issues on one&#39;s mind that also need attention.  You here and see <br/>
repeated the loneliness and confusion that occurs in recent grads <br/>
when they discover that the real world not work the way school did.  <br/>
Hope this gives you food for thought.  And I hope your family finds <br/>
the circumstances that work the best for you all, whatever that may <br/>
be.  All the best to you and yours.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If it doesn&#39;t seem right to you don&#39;t do it!<br/>
Whether you got two or fifty responses here, it wouldn&#39;t change the fact that <br/>
YOU have to decide.  Look into her eyes.  Ask her why she wants to do it.  We <br/>
don&#39;t know.  SHE might not know.  <br/>
<br/>
If she wants more interaction with other kids, it is your immediate duty to <br/>
FIND that for her.  Not to just keep doing what you&#39;re doing the way you&#39;ve <br/>
been doing.  If she&#39;s saying &quot;I need more&quot; or &quot;I need different&quot; you need to <br/>
find her more and different.  <br/>
<br/>
If she knows you don&#39;t think school is a good option and you&#39;re ignoring her <br/>
needs and she goes so far as to say &quot;I would rather go to school than stay <br/>
here the way things are right now,&quot; will you not THEN look into her eyes and <br/>
say &quot;What can we do to make things better without you going to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes unschooling parents forget they need to be mixing things up, not <br/>
settling into quiet at-home life without kid-speed opportunities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-81975430"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;Robyn Carter&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rcarter@...">rcarter@...</a>&gt;<br/>

about the rest of the family? What about what we need?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before you let her go back or make the decision to not let her, find out <br/>
exactly why, if you can, she wants to go to school. If it&#39;s just because of <br/>
the friend situation, then I would go the extra mile and find some people <br/>
for her to hang with. It might not be easy and it might take awhile to find <br/>
someone she clicks with, but if she sees you make the effort and joins in, <br/>
it might be enough for her right now until she finds friends.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not just the friend situation and it&#39;s school itself, then what <br/>
would it really hurt for her to find out about going back? If it&#39;s anything <br/>
like last time, you may have a week of inconvenience. If that&#39;s all it takes <br/>
for her to find her way, I don&#39;t think it would be too much to handle. And <br/>
if she finds she likes it and wants to stay, well your schedule would <br/>
change, but if it&#39;s what she desires, isn&#39;t that really what you want her to <br/>
do anyway?<br/>
