<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902432693">Sunflowers are neat.  When mature, you can eat the seeds or leave them on the flower for the birds.  They are useful plants too, as every part is harvested for use.  We just got a book from the library, &quot;This is the sunflower&quot; by Lola M. Schaefer.  It&#39;s probably ment for 2-7 yo, but I learned something!!  Besides, I can learn form picture books. <br/>

I&#39;ve had sunflowers in the past and had a real problem with squirrels <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168088080">I have sunflowers and I have squirrels in my yard, and<br/>
they never bother my sunflowers. Maybe that&#39;s because<br/>
I put peanuts out for the squirrels and they prefer<br/>
those? Not sure. Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113571563">We&#39;ve planted sunflowers in the past with my now 5yo.  I&#39;m allergic to bee <br/>
stings and they seem to really attract bees to our yard.  Just a word of <br/>
caution.  The last year that we planted them my daughter bordered our veggie <br/>
garden and we had a hard time getting to some of our veggies due to the <br/>
bees.<br/>

That works with nice civilized squirrels who wait for the heads to start <br/>
maturing. I don&#39;t know about Nancy&#39;s sunflowers, but ours were beheaded <br/>
before the flowers had even reached the pollination stage. Very depressing to <br/>
wake up in the morning to a neat row of headless stalks. <br/>
<br/>
Ah well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528627185">OH, vicious little dickens aren&#39;t they?!  I wonder if netting would work?  I put netting on all of our fruit trees when they look to be about ripe.  I don&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t had that much of a problem with my sunflowers.  Now the bird feeder, that&#39;s another story!!!  I wonder if you could put a smooth pipe up the stalk, like PVC or something, that&#39;s what we do with our young trees.  Or, you could try feeding them something else like someone mentioned.  <br/>
