The image is a panoramic view of the world from the new space station.  It is a night photo with the lights clearly indicating the populated areas. <br/>
Note that Canada&#39;s population is almost exclusively along the U.S. border. Moving east to Europe, there is a high population concentration along the Mediterranean Coast. It&#39;s easy to spot London, Paris, Stockholm and Vienna. Check out the development of Israel compared to the rest Of the Arab countries. <br/>
<br/>
Note the Nile River and the rest of the &quot;Dark Continent&quot;. After the Nile, the lights don&#39;t come on again until Johannesburg. Look at the Australian Outback and the Trans-Siberian Rail Route. Moving east, the most striking observation is the difference between North and South Korea. Note the density of Japan. <br/>
<br/>
What a piece of photography. It is an absolutely awesome picture of the Earth taken from the Boeing built Space Station last November on a perfect night with no obscuring atmospheric condition. <br/>
