I read a book from my library titled Through Indian Eyes that gave one<br/>
page descriptions of many kids books with American Indian characters and<br/>
summarized what was accurate, inaccurate or derogatory about each book. <br/>
This book also gave the big thumbs down to The Indian in the Cupboard. <br/>
What was nice about this book was that it also gave thumbs up to books<br/>
that were realistic and appropriate.  I think it also had a list of<br/>
questions that one could think about when reading additional books to<br/>
assess whether the portrayals were well-rounded and thoughtful or<br/>
lop-sided and ignorant.<br/>

We also loved them, and I approached them the same way I did Tom Sawyer and<br/>
Huckleberry Finn.  &quot;Most people believed that black people were inferior in<br/>
those days, but we know that isn&#39;t true.&quot;  Lars has never acted as if he<br/>
felt superior to aboriginals or blacks or any other race, not before the<br/>
books or after them.  He understands fiction.  It&#39;s like all the King Arthur<br/>
and Robin Hood books we read.  He knew that most of it was legend and could<br/>
be told many different ways.  He loved hearing the different versions.<br/>

These books aren&#39;t banned. These books are available for you.<br/>
These books have been read and reviewed by American Indians. American Indians that live in this society as American Indians, as members of a race that is discriminated against - openly. American Indians live under an occupying force - a society that cheapens everything that is held dear by these People.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t find anything wrong with the book. So American Indians are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a problem with the word Squaw?<br/>
Do you think we&#39;re overly sensitive about the Braves tomahawk chop?<br/>

think of ourselves as superior to native Americans after reading them, as<br/>
the link given suggested the books would make us feel.  In my reading, the<br/>
stories depicted the Indian as a man who cared deeply for his family and<br/>
friends, was loyal and hard working, and did what he needed to do to protect<br/>
those he loved.  Whether his character was historically accurate or not, I<br/>
liked him.<br/>

  SHOULD read these books.  I said that we enjoyed the stories and did not<br/>

  the link given suggested the books would make us feel.  In my reading, the<br/>
  stories depicted the Indian as a man who cared deeply for his family and<br/>

  those he loved.  Whether his character was historically accurate or not, I<br/>
  liked him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005405287">I have to take Janis&#39; side here.  This is not about censorship and <br/>
it&#39;s not about banning books.  It&#39;s about racism.  This country can&#39;t <br/>
afford to raise another generation of racists.  We&#39;re all living here <br/>
together and we can learn to respect one another or we can all end up <br/>
killing each other.  I live just two hours from Cleveland and see <br/>
people walking around with their idiotic Cleveland Indians logo, a <br/>
logo which, if it depicted a black person would have been changed <br/>
decades ago.  You can&#39;t tell me that images like that are instilling <br/>
respect in anybody.  I&#39;m sure as heck not going to read my kids <br/>
racist books on top of it.  This is not about fantasy, like Harry <br/>
Potter.  This is about actual human beings who are being harmed by <br/>
the attitude that these racist things are somehow harmless.  If it&#39;s <br/>
racism against black or Latinos or Asians, it&#39;s an outrage.  If it&#39;s <br/>
sexism against women or prejudice against gays, people are in an <br/>
uproar.  But if it&#39;s racism against American Indians, then &quot;it&#39;s just <br/>
fiction&quot; and people are being &quot;too picky&quot;.  No way.  Racism is racism <br/>
and we don&#39;t tolerate racism in my house (which I had to inform my <br/>
father in law when he got back from Texas and started telling what he <br/>
thought were amusing stories about &quot;those Mexicans&quot; -- uh-uh, not in <br/>
my home).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-966399999">It&#39;s a far cry from &quot;Indian in the Cupboard&quot; or &quot;Huck Finn&quot; to the Cleveland<br/>
Indians mascot.  Much like the difference between a good steak and Micky<br/>

<br/>
Good literature, even when portraying something incorrect (like a<br/>
stereotype) is a launching off place for so much.  I&#39;m Jewish but I don&#39;t<br/>
think that anyone who reads Shakespeare&#39;s character Shylock is perpetuating<br/>
racism.  The context is crucial.<br/>
<br/>
So is how we respond to it.  I&#39;m pagan.  I consider myself a witch based on<br/>
my personal practice.  Now, you can&#39;t tell me there aren&#39;t some just<br/>
&quot;charming&quot; (sarcasm and pun intented) stereotypes out there.  But I am a<br/>
huge fan of many of the latest pop culture incarnations of my craft.  Love<br/>
Charmed, love Buffy&#39;s Willow, love Practical Magic.<br/>
<br/>
I use them to show my son the differences between fantasy and reality.  I<br/>
use them to remind myself of how far we&#39;ve come.  I don&#39;t assume that when<br/>
someone talks about that stereotype they are talking about me.<br/>
<br/>
Wrong ideas about a group can be a great way to educate people about the<br/>
TRUTH about that group.  We&#39;ve all seen that about homeschooling and<br/>
unschooling.  Someone asks about the dreaded &quot;s&quot; word and away we go--a<br/>
chance to &quot;spread the truth.&quot;  -grin-<br/>

    I am very sad about the treatment indigenous people of this country received<br/>
    and continue to receive.<br/>
<br/>
    The subject of the email was &quot;books to avoid&quot;.  To me, that implied that<br/>
    people were being advised to NOT read the books.<br/>
<br/>
    snip----You don&#39;t find anything wrong with the book. So American Indians are<br/>
    wrong.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I didn&#39;t say there is not &quot;anything wrong&quot; with the book.  I could point out<br/>
    plenty of things to critique in the stories, but they are fiction.<br/>
<br/>
    I didn&#39;t say American Indians are wrong.  I didn&#39;t even say that others<br/>
    SHOULD read these books.  I said that we enjoyed the stories and did not<br/>
    think of ourselves as superior to native Americans after reading them, as<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500024800">Reading fiction with my children has been a starting point for many<br/>
conversations on values and issues.  I will give more thought to the issues<br/>
of Native Americans in fiction as a result of this conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Racism, bigotry, sexism, and discrimination of all sorts is alive and well<br/>
in this country.<br/>
<br/>
How responsible should authors of fiction be in terms of historical accuracy<br/>
or political correctness?<br/>
<br/>
snip----This is not about fantasy, like Harry<br/>
Potter.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Indian in the Cupboard series IS fantasy.  Plastic figures come to life,<br/>
including the figure of a woman who is a deceased relative of Henri.  The<br/>
characters living in the present in the story become miniature and go back<br/>
in time.  The Harry Potter series has some horrible stuff in it.  I was<br/>
distressed reading about the conditions that Harry lived in with his aunt<br/>
and uncle and how badly they treated him, it made me feel ill.  His cousin<br/>
Dudley is fat and an all over general yucky person.  Where is the outrage<br/>
for how that makes young readers think about fat people?  Isn&#39;t that<br/>
discrimination too?  JK could have made Dudley scummy without making him<br/>
fat.<br/>
<br/>
My high school mascot in 1976 was the warrior.  Some people found it<br/>
offensive and others were proud to be represented by this symbol.  Now I<br/>
live in a town that has the &quot;Bombers&quot; because this is where the plutonium<br/>
was made for the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.  Some people think<br/>
this should be changed because that bombing was so horrible.  Others feel it<br/>
should be kept because it represents an important event in our history.<br/>

are protesting these sorts of things?  The difference with witchcraft <br/>
is that the fantasy image of the witch has been around for thousands <br/>
of years.  The religion of Wicca was created in the 1950s in England <br/>
and Gardner called it witchcraft to draw on the mystery of the <br/>
fantasy image.  The Wiccan myth of ancient Wiccans being killed by <br/>
the invading Christians really is a myth.  There weren&#39;t ancient <br/>
Wiccans, the religion of ancient Britain was not Wicca, the people <br/>
killed in the witch hunts and persecutions weren&#39;t even pagan at <br/>
all.  There were Christians.  Converting to a religion that has been <br/>
named for something that has a pre-existing fantasy image is not even <br/>
close to the same thing as a race of people who have been around <br/>
since the dawn of time and have been discriminated against for <br/>
hundreds of years and the fictional image is a mockery of the pre-<br/>

<br/>
I know I&#39;m not making as much sense as I&#39;m trying to.  Racism is <br/>
something I feel strongly about.  I&#39;m raising two sons.  White sons.  <br/>
I won&#39;t raise them to racist white men.  Period.  If there&#39;s a list <br/>
of children&#39;s books to avoid because they contain racist portrayals <br/>
of any group, I&#39;ll avoid them.  When the kids are much older we can <br/>
talk about racism and what it leads to.  If you want to teach your <br/>
kids about American Indians, take them to a reservation and see what <br/>
the living conditions are like.  A Third World country right here in <br/>
the middle of our &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; country.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-368029723">&lt;&lt; Did you ever notice that it&#39;s the Christians, not the Wiccans, who<br/>
are protesting these sorts of things?  The difference with witchcraft<br/>
is that the fantasy image of the witch has been around for thousands<br/>
of years.  The religion of Wicca was created in the 1950s in England<br/>
and Gardner called it witchcraft to draw on the mystery of the<br/>
fantasy image.  The Wiccan myth of ancient Wiccans being killed by<br/>
the invading Christians really is a myth.  There weren&#39;t ancient<br/>
Wiccans, the religion of ancient Britain was not Wicca, the people<br/>
killed in the witch hunts and persecutions weren&#39;t even pagan at<br/>
all.  There were Christians.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Without wanting to get into a debate with anyone, Britain was totally a<br/>
pagan country until Roman&#39;s started to make them covert after the Roman&#39;s<br/>
themselves started converting to Christianity (the ruler at the time escapes<br/>
me at the moment), at which point those brits and anyone else under Roman<br/>
rule who did NOT convert where hunted down, tortured, killed and<br/>
discriminated against until they did convert.<br/>
<br/>
There have been and still are many many people around who call themselves<br/>
witches and have nothing to do with Wicca or being a wiccan (our family is<br/>
some of those people).  A witch is a quick and easy term many times for<br/>
people who practice earth based religions.<br/>
<br/>
And the above statement I hate to say sounds like something that would come<br/>
out of a Christians mouth and not a Wiccan, witch or a practitioner of earth<br/>
based religions.  And I do know many wiccan&#39;s and witches who do NOT approve<br/>
of the witch type shows on TV.<br/>
<br/>
The religion of Christianity was created around/after Jesus, so about 2000<br/>
yrs ago....the religion that witches, wiccan&#39;s, druids and any other pagan<br/>
follow have been around for thousands and thousands of years....different<br/>
names maybe, but same basic principles....ask any that practice these type<br/>
of religions.<br/>
<br/>
All I ask when a non earth based practitioner tries to &quot;tell&quot; me about my<br/>
religion is...make sure you do your homework and &quot;know&quot; what you are talking<br/>
about.  I don&#39;t tell Christians Jesus was a myth and I expect not to be told<br/>
my religion is a myth as well.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps look into Irelands religious history...lots there about non<br/>
Christians being tortured and killed for not converting to Christianity.<br/>
Considering how brutal Christians could be during those times...it is no<br/>
wonder so many did not want to become Christian.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069229056">I just got back from vacation.   I had 1000 emails in my inbox!  I think AOL <br/>
only holds 1000 emails.   Well, I was going to ask about the Indian in the <br/>
Cupboard being racist thread... then I thought, heck, I should just go wade <br/>
through the archives at the group site...  But, if anyone wants to just give <br/>
me a breif summary of why some folks ( American Indians, I take it) are <br/>
offended by the book, and why they think it is racist.   I&#39;m not looking for <br/>
a debate or arguement.   Im am sincerely and honestly curious as to what is <br/>
racist about the book or movie.  I&#39;ve read the book and saw the movie.  We <br/>
have the movie and its one of the kids favorites.   What is wrong with it?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133474729">&lt;&lt; Look, I haven&#39;t read the Indian in the Cupboard, but if the American <br/>
<br/>
Indians who have read it have found it racist, then I don&#39;t intend to <br/>
<br/>
read it to my children.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read it.<br/>
I grew up in Espanola between San Juan and Santa Clara Pueblos.  NOT the same <br/>
kinds of Indians at all, but there were as many Pueblo kids in town (and a <br/>
few Navajos) as there were Anglo kids.  We socialized lots.<br/>
<br/>
That book is goofy kid fantasy about plastic figures coming to live in a <br/>
little cabinet which is somehow magic.  There&#39;s also a cowboy.  There&#39;s a WWI <br/>
British Army medic.  There&#39;s a knight on horseback.    It&#39;s not a racist <br/>
book.  It&#39;s an adventure book.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But to serve it to my family <br/>
<br/>
and say, &quot;Just eat around the moldy parts.  It&#39;s good, otherwise.&quot;  I <br/>
<br/>
just don&#39;t see the point.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t compare moldy food to a book you haven&#39;t read.  That&#39;s as closed minded <br/>
as racism.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have the complete collection of Grimm&#39;s Fairy Tales.  They&#39;re from <br/>
<br/>
Germany about 300 years ago. . . .The point of some of them are that <br/>
<br/>
Jews are bad.  That&#39;s the whole story.  &quot;There was a Jew and boy was <br/>
<br/>
he an idiot.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which one is that?  &#39;Some of them&#39; implies there&#39;s more than one, even.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; There weren&#39;t ancient <br/>
<br/>
Wiccans, the religion of ancient Britain was not Wicca, the people <br/>
<br/>
killed in the witch hunts and persecutions weren&#39;t even pagan at <br/>
<br/>
all.  There were Christians. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True.  &quot;Witches&quot; claiming ancient persecution are totally off the wall.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;. . .not even <br/>
<br/>
close to the same thing as a race of people who have been around <br/>
<br/>
since the dawn of time &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very few groups of people, race or otherwise, have been around since the dawn <br/>
of time.  Someone commented here (I think) last week something to the effect <br/>
of being surprised to find out that the Japanese weren&#39;t the indigenous <br/>
people of Japan.  DUH!   Few to no people are indigenous to where they live <br/>
if you go back far enough.  The Sanskrit-language-group in India came from <br/>
elsewhere.  Should they be reviled for having run the other language groups <br/>
to the edges of the subcontinent, seeing as how it&#39;s beyond redoing now?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If there&#39;s a list <br/>
<br/>
of children&#39;s books to avoid because they contain racist portrayals <br/>
<br/>
of any group, I&#39;ll avoid them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you just take other people&#39;s word for it without looking yourself, you <br/>
might find you&#39;ve just bought into someone ELSE&#39;s prejudice.  &quot;PREjudice&quot; is <br/>
deciding without looking.  Doing that at the other extreme isn&#39;t balance <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you want to teach your <br/>
<br/>
kids about American Indians, take them to a reservation and see what <br/>
<br/>
the living conditions are like. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in New Mexico.  Indians work at Walmart, and live in town or at the <br/>
Pueblo (or on the reservation, in the case of Navajo), whichever they want.  <br/>
They work at Los Alamos Labs.  They work all over the place.   Living <br/>
conditions at the Pueblos are not bad at all.  I&#39;m not so personally familiar <br/>
with the Navajo reservation.  There&#39;s a LOT of alcohol abuse.  There is <br/>
government corruption.  That&#39;s not other people doing to them, that&#39;s them <br/>
doing to themselves and each other.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;A Third World country right here in <br/>
<br/>
the middle of our &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; country.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Downtown of many major cities is pretty backward and poor and dangerous.  <br/>
Street people here are way worse off than the Indians.   There&#39;s a mixed <br/>
Vietnamese and illegal Mexican neighborhood here that is NOT save to be in at <br/>
night.  More apartments are boarded up than are inhabited.  Indians stay out <br/>
of that neighborhood.  Kirby&#39;s karate school is smack in the midst of it.<br/>

<br/>
This is nonsense?  Last time I read my history (today in fact), Egyptians<br/>
were pagan, it is very well documented...therefore NOT nonsense or wishful<br/>
thinking.  I have studied Egypt all this past year and base much of my<br/>
religious practices on what they not only believed but did themselves. If it<br/>
is nonsense then there is some serious issues with the Bible as last I read<br/>
Moses was in Egypt and dealt with the pagan aspect of the time.  I have also<br/>
studied some Celtic history and the same goes there...documented practices<br/>
of paganism practiced much in the same way I do now, as does Mentors I have<br/>
had off on on, who in turn have learned their religious way in life from<br/>
history passed on by generations in both their families.<br/>
<br/>
Granted practices have changed over time, just as Christianity has changed<br/>
over time, but the &quot;basic&quot; concept of the Gods and Goddess is still the same<br/>
just as the basic concept of God and Jesus are the same for Christians.<br/>
