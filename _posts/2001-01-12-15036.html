&lt;&lt;  Can you believe that&#39;s Tim Curry (of Frankenfurter fame) doing the<br/>
voice for Nigel? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was a cartoon version of Peter Pan some years back (8? 9?) in which he <br/>
did the voice of Captain Hook, and got an award, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
-=- FWIW, I was considered &quot;gifted&quot; as a child, and went<br/>
through all the g/t programs in school. I do not feel that the label served<br/>
me well personally, although it did get me out of some boring classes and<br/>
give me more time to &quot;goof off&quot; :-). My husband OTOH, was<br/>
labeled a &quot;slow learner&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Same.  My:  &quot;High IQ&quot; and all the accompanying pressure and BS from parents <br/>
and teachers and counselors and principals.   Husband:  Profoundly average, <br/>
at which point official people started kinda ignoring him and being satisfied <br/>
with very little, and not expecting anything special.  He&#39;s now a hotshot <br/>
engineer, very well respected by his co-workers and making good money.  I&#39;m <br/>
a...  housewife. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;it took<br/>
him the better part of 20 years to get past the negative labeling and see<br/>
himself for the truly talented individual that he is.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s still not quite over it in some ways.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; No-one<br/>
on earth is truly &quot;gifted&quot; in everything, thus most people have gifts in one<br/>
area or another. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know... I have a couple of friends who are way up there on all of <br/>
Gardner&#39;s 7 intelligences, and one even on the nature, #8 of 7 &lt;g&gt;.  I <br/>
myself, on the other hand, am greatly lacking in more than one area (not the <br/>
areas school measured...).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It was interesting to<br/>
watch it play out, as many of these &quot;gifted&quot; people had never dealt with<br/>
other people as peers in their lives. Many of them had few social and life<br/>
skills.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the &quot;gifted&quot; personnel department and management of Microsoft <br/>
will figure out that among those thousands of applications are also some <br/>
people, like the friends I&#39;m thinking of above, who can score well on tests <br/>
AND who have inter- and intrapersonal skills, AND physical strength and <br/>
agility, AND musical talent (and therefor a different kind of creativity), <br/>
and that hiring well-rounded people would save them a lot of management grief.<br/>
<br/>
I (and many of us) could go on and on about the problems of labelling people <br/>
&quot;gifted,&quot; and those who prefer the setting-apart label could ignore it.  <br/>
Condescension is a necessary part of that, and to express the wish that it <br/>
all works out for us comes under that, I think.  Every time a child is told <br/>
he&#39;s better than others, a fairy falls down dead.  Not really, but his <br/>
ability to connect with other people who either have scored lower on a test <br/>
(big deal) or didn&#39;t read early (same on the big-deal scale--do early walkers <br/>
become olympic runners?) or whose parents have chosen to avoid testing and <br/>
labelling altogether is impaired further as he is further set apart.</div>
