&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am backing away from my involvement in email, especially highly charged<br/>
&gt;debates.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I feared and felt yesterday, my brother is okay physically.  BUT his<br/>
&gt;best friend was at a trade show on the 105th floor of the first tower<br/>
&gt;to get hit.  Aaron, my brother&#39;s friend, called his wife to tell here there<br/>
&gt;had been an explosion and he was trying to get out.  No one has seen<br/>
&gt;or heard from him since.  The two families are quite close and my<br/>
&gt;brother, my SIL, my niece and my nephew are all grieving the loss<br/>
&gt;of a good friend.  I&#39;m in CA, they are in NJ and I don&#39;t know what<br/>
&gt;to do to help...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To make it even harder for me, Aaron&#39;s daughter is the same age as<br/>
&gt;mine.  So now when I see pictures of the towers I see a little girl<br/>
&gt;the same age as mine who has lost her daddy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I will probably be silent and I may go to no-mail if I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;handle it but I really like this list so to quote Arnold &#39;I&quot;ll be<br/>
&gt;back!&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

I have been thinking of your brother&#39;s friends since the other day at the<br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to say.  But my thoughts are with them.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
