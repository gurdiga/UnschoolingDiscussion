Yeah, I know what you mean...  Our 9yo went to K at public school and I was told he most likely had ADD.  The teacher gave examples of how he just couldn&#39;t settle down and concentrate.  My favorite was that he couldn&#39;t sit down and watch tv like the other children.  One look around the room and I knew he had a bad case of BWTB, bored with teacher&#39;s babble.  The class was packed with all those hands-on things to stimulate little kids into thinking school is a fun place.  He believed them and was out to have FUN.  This tended to distract the other students but he was still learning everything the schoolies wanted him too.  The way I seen it, how could he have an attention problem if he could concentrate on things (just not the teacher or lesson of the moment) and be learning.  The teacher assured me he would have mounting problems later on and I should seek the further advice of our doctor as they have medication to help with this problem.  See Ya. <br/>
 That was it for us.  It&#39;s taken me 4 years to convince him that school isn&#39;t like K with all the fun stuff and games.  Up until last year he still wanted to go back to play with the other kids. <br/>

Isn&#39;t it nice to be out of the cave?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444464092">Hi everyone, my name is Holly.  I would like to learn more about <br/>
this option and the laws about it.  I have an 8 year old who has <br/>
been praying to be homeschooled.  But his dad says no.  Now we are <br/>
separated.  It&#39;s been a month since we have been separated.  Is it <br/>
possible that my son could be homeschooled even though, husband and <br/>
I are separated and I may have to go out to work?  I guess, I&#39;m <br/>
looking for a positive answer to this.<br/>

Depends what state you&#39;re in.<br/>
You&#39;ll need to find local contacts and ask how they deal with local  laws.<br/>

I have  an 8 year old who has <br/>
been praying to be homeschooled.  But his dad  says no.  Now we are <br/>
separated.  It&#39;s been a month since we have  been separated. <br/>
 <br/>
Are you married?<br/>
If so, and if this separation is headed to divorce, I would NOT start  <br/>
anything like homeschooling, because it would become a matter for custody  <br/>
disagreements.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re getting divorced, do everything the way your soon-to-be-ex likes  <br/>
it done while you negotiate sweetly for complete physical custody, if you want  <br/>
to homeschool.<br/>
 <br/>
If you go with shared custody or partials of any sort, you probably won&#39;t  be <br/>
able to homeschool without your ex husband&#39;s consent.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is it  <br/>

<br/>
Depends on the details of the separation, primarily.<br/>
If you were legally stable, people could advise you about homeschooling  <br/>
while you work, but at a time like this, if divorce is in the future, I dont  <br/>
think you should pull your son out of school.<br/>
