<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017399928">I will be moving to Florida at the end of January and would<br/>
also like to know about dealing with the yearly evaluation.<br/>
We live in Kentucky right now and have never heard from or<br/>
had any contact with &quot;school officials.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ren recommended an Umbrella School and I would like to know<br/>
more about them.  Please e-mail me privately, if you don&#39;t <br/>
mind.<br/>
