&gt; How many other such dialects are there?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My favorite dialect site is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pittsburghese.com">http://www.pittsburghese.com</a><br/>
<br/>
From the front page:<br/>
What is Pittsburghese? It&#39;s the unofficial language of the Steel City. From<br/>
da Sahside to Sliberty, you can find Picksburghers speaking just like this.<br/>
Every tahn has its own flavor, and this is just one of ours. So if you are<br/>
planning to visit Dahntahn or just catch a Stillers game we suggest you<br/>
learn the language of the &#39;Burgh.<br/>

My dad&#39;s side of the family is from Pittsburgh, and I spent a few summers<br/>
there as a kid.  My family really sounds like the wav files&lt;g&gt;.<br/>
