&lt;&lt; Does anyone know how I can do a credit check on a prospective renter? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ann,<br/>
Do you have an account with a credit company?  I ran HUD-subsidized housing <br/>
for years and we would just set up an account with a local company (check the <br/>
Yellow Pages).  You have to get the prospective renter to sign an agreement <br/>
stating that their credit will be checked.  The company you use will probably <br/>
have standard agreements that you can use for examples.  If the person&#39;s <br/>
credit is bad enough that you won&#39;t rent to him/her, you have to let them <br/>
know that they are being turned down, but you do not show them the copy of <br/>
their credit report.  They are responsible for contacting the company and <br/>
getting a copy (it is free to them if they are turned down for bad credit).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some pretty amazing credit reports.  I had one woman living in one <br/>
of the projects who wanted her boyfriend to move in with her.  I checked his <br/>
credit, and he owed over $30,000 (!!!) in back child support.  He was only 22 <br/>
years old!  Evidently he had children with 8 different women.  All the kids <br/>
were about the same age (about 3 yrs old), so he must have had a mighty <br/>
powerful urge to spread his seed at some point.  He was turned down to rent <br/>
with us - NOT because of his prolific paternity habits, but because he <br/>
couldn&#39;t pay off the bad debt.  The girlfriend who wanted him to live with <br/>
her (she was one of the 8) knew about all the other 7 and didn&#39;t care.  In <br/>
fact, she frequently babysat for the other kids!  I don&#39;t think I would be <br/>
quite so understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, good luck!<br/>
