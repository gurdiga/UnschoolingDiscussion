He isn&#39;t a writer, but because he is good with patterns, he can edit stuff <br/>
for me. He can&#39;t tell me what is wrong with a sentence, but he can quickly <br/>
&quot;feel&quot; that it isn&#39;t right. It&#39;s amazing the way he sees patterns, even in words.<br/>
<br/>
Those really difficult puzzles, he figures out in no time. I bought him one <br/>
that was supposed to take really talented people at least 2 hours....he did it <br/>
in less than 5 minutes! What a waste of money.<br/>
