<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138800875"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;As for the spanking part. I use it as a last resort. If they get spanked <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;once a month the get spanked a lot.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, they do get spanked a lot. I&#39;m glad my husband doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s okay <br/>
to hit me only once a month. For that matter, I&#39;m glad my son, almost 14 and <br/>
getting bigger than me by the minute, doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s okay to hit me now <br/>
that I&#39;m smaller than him.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily we all have relationships based on trust and respect. I don&#39;t hit, <br/>
my husband doesn&#39;t hit, my kids don&#39;t hit. We don&#39;t hit each other. We don&#39;t <br/>
hit other people.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll listen to any negative feedback you get about spanking with an <br/>
open heart. Your babes want your open arms, not the back of your hand. Life <br/>
can be better without spankings and punishments. Even if it&#39;s &quot;only&quot; once a <br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
I can feel that you are a loving and giving parent, Yoki. You want what&#39;s <br/>
best for your family. Family life really can work with peaceful parenting. <br/>
Really.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know you are not abusing your children, but you are also not parenting as <br/>
gently and mindfully as you maybe could. Maybe you could talk to your <br/>
husband a bit more about why he objects to spanking.<br/>

<br/>
Mary&#39;s point is good.<br/>
I would much prefer for my husband to take my child&#39;s side than mine.  If <br/>
there&#39;s any &quot;respectfully&quot; deferring, I think it should be being respectful <br/>
of the children&#39;s safety and peace, not respectful of the disciplinarian.<br/>
