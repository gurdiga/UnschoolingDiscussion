&gt; organizations, so I get a lot of &quot;new homeschooler&quot; calls.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just got one from a woman looking for someone else to &quot;homeschool&quot; her<br/>
&gt; kids. I tried to convince her that what she was seeking was a small, and<br/>
&gt; perhaps home-based, private school, but she was very insistent that she<br/>
&gt; wanted them homeschooled... just not, apparently, in HER home by her!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I&#39;m freaked out. &lt;weak g&gt; None of you just called to mess with my<br/>
&gt; head, right? &lt;gg&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve gotten this. I had this bizarre conversation with one woman who just <br/>
didn&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
Her: I want to register my daughter for the homeschooling.<br/>
Me: (Explains homeschooling)<br/>
H: No, I want to sign her up.<br/>
Me: (Explains again, more slowly, easier words)<br/>
H: You mean WE have to do it????!!  Well, that certainly doesn&#39;t sound good. <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t like that at all.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps for these children school is a good idea...it gets them away from <br/>
their parents.<br/>
