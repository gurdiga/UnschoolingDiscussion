&lt;&lt; You know what I think? I dont&#39; think the right to vote should be based on <br/>
 age, but I think each election, to get into the polls the voter should take <br/>
a <br/>
 test of some sort to prove he has the slightest clue what&#39;s going on and <br/>
 who&#39;s who. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree!! I sat and watched a lady have her boyfriend or dh tell her what to <br/>
vote on one time up in OR. It was a local election and they didn&#39;t have poll <br/>
booths, it was SO incredibly annoying to me.<br/>
