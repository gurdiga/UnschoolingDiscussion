<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159997011">First of all, I LOVE this list!! I feel like I just found the gals I<br/>
started this parenting journey with. My husband and I lived in <br/>
Morocco as missionaries during our early years of parenting and <br/>
only knew two sources for those life skills--our intuition and a <br/>
few books sent to me written by Dr. Sears and LLL. I thought the <br/>
whole world parented that way! What a shock to return to the <br/>
states find out that the Ezzos had influenced every one of my <br/>
friends from college... Argh!<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have also been through our share of therapy <br/>
and I vowed to listen to our kids and tuck away $25.00 depostis <br/>
each time we damaged them against the day they&#39;d need that <br/>
insurance for thearpy to get over us. :) We used to say, &quot;We don&#39;t <br/>
save for college. We save for their therapy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Jon and I have been in the conservative Christian world <br/>
for the last twenty years. We have gone through a significant shift <br/>
in our theological beliefs (are currently churchless) and find that <br/>
that world no longer matches who we&#39;ve become (or more <br/>
accurately, who we used to be and liked being). The typical <br/>
comments from those who know us about not setting limits (we <br/>
have set some, but compared to all who know us, we&#39;re the <br/>
liberal, loosey-goosey ones) is that we&#39;re inviting rebellion. <br/>
Ironically, if there are no rules against which to rebel, I don&#39;t<br/>
know how there could be rebellion. I suppose they mean that our <br/>
kids will slide into irretrievable immorality.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the mothers I know feel that they must set guidelines for <br/>
behavior so that their kids will be conditioned to understand <br/>
certain values. Yet one of my daughter&#39;s best friends (who is in <br/>
the most restrictive home we know) tried to kill herself last year <br/>
and is now plotting all the things she will do to herself once she <br/>
is 18 (from listening to rap, to piercing ever possible body part to <br/>
living with a boyfriend).<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, just since Monday when we shared our changed view <br/>
of things with our kids, I&#39;ve already encountered doubts in  my <br/>
own kids. They worry that they will make bad decisions for  <br/>
themselves. A couple of them said to me that they wondered if <br/>
this &quot;new thing would really work.&quot; They worried that they would <br/>
make bad choices if left to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
This floored me.<br/>
<br/>
My 13 dd said, &quot;Can we listen to Eminem?&quot; I said that I would <br/>
like to listen to it with her, if she&#39;s interested so we can talk<br/>
about it. She freaked, &quot;Mom, you&#39;re my mother. Just say no. You <br/>
can say no to me. How can I ever rebel against you if you set no <br/>
rules? I&#39;m going to call you Mrs. Bogart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve since talked more about it, but I have to admit that I was <br/>
surprised that inside she had this picture of individuating <br/>
through some kind of rebellion. I wonder now if the very <br/>
guidelines parents set for their kids predispose them to think in <br/>
terms of rebelling for the sake of individual growth rather than a <br/>
natural process of personal discernment that evolves as the <br/>
child ages. Have we bred rebellion into teen life in an effort to <br/>
scuplt who they are and what they value?<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

<br/>
I think too that so much of society just believes that that is what teenagers are supposed to do,  and most have those rules so it follows naturally,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think Living Joyfully with Children addressed this really well,  in the chapter &#39;Don&#39;t Plant Those Weeds&#39;,  they have several parenting choices that could lead to a rebellious child.     But as far as I can see and understand,  the changes that you are making and so many of us are attempting to do will hopefully alliviate that from happening,   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
and..from what I&#39;ve heard from unschooling families with older children... it is working!!<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Ditto for us,  and this is what I am really struggling with right now,   I feel very alone and isolated,  except on this list,   <br/>
<br/>
    but I do feel like what we (my fam)are doing is the right thing and am feeling stronger and stronger about it all the time.<br/>

Morocco as missionaries during our early years of parenting &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a Morocco fascination.  She&#39;s not sure why.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We used to say, &quot;We don&#39;t <br/>
save for college. We save for their therapy.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were really young, we used to tell people we were saving money <br/>
for Kirby&#39;s college, and Marty&#39;s bail and lawyers.  But we shut up because <br/>
not only was it tacky, but Marty SEEMED rambunctious, but he has never been <br/>
hurt and never in trouble (although  policeman did tell him and his friend <br/>
once to stop messing with the newspaper boxes--they were just trying them all <br/>
to see if any would open).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...inviting rebellion.  Ironically, if there are no rules against which to <br/>
rebel, I don&#39;t<br/>
know how there could be rebellion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it the darnedest thing?  All that eastern philosophy about not <br/>
resisting makes sense once a person stops holding his breath and resisting <br/>
everything.  <br/>
<br/>
I grew up Baptist.  That says it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I suppose they mean that our <br/>
kids will slide into irretrievable immorality.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had other homeschoolers over the years ask me those questions which <br/>
shine a spotlight on THEIR beliefs, such as these souvenirs:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you don&#39;t raise your children in a church, how will they learn right from <br/>
wrong?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Without a belief in God [by which they clearly meant a belief in hell] why <br/>
would your children ever mind you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remember feeling that way, long ago--that there were Christians (and good <br/>
members of other religions) and then there were &quot;the others,&quot; who would as <br/>
soon stick a knife in a guy as not.  Why wouldn&#39;t they?  They were Godless <br/>
heathens and SINNERS.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...is now plotting all the things she will do to herself once she <br/>
is 18 (from listening to rap, to piercing ever possible body part to <br/>
living with a boyfriend).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our best in-home example is make-up.  I wasn&#39;t allowed to wear make-up before <br/>
fifteen.  When I was fifteen, I started wearing it even though I didn&#39;t like <br/>
it and didn&#39;t want to, but I had waited so long.  I quit not long after. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
 But I knew other girls who would no more go out without false eyelashes and <br/>
$2 worth of STUFF than they&#39;d go out nekkid, because they  had by god EARNED <br/>
that &quot;right,&quot; and they were not going back to being the (tortured) little <br/>
girls they had been.<br/>
<br/>
The other night we were at a folk-singing party and Holly sang along with <br/>
some fairly mature thing, I forget what (maybe from Paint Your Wagon), just <br/>
as we were going home and the folky part was over, but the silly wild <br/>
late-night singing wasn&#39;t.  Someone my age commented on Holly know those <br/>
lyrics.  I said, &quot;HEY, she knows Rocky Horror Picture Show and the South Park <br/>
movie too.&quot;  They laughed and said she shouldn&#39;t sing them in public or the <br/>
county would come and talk to me, but they weren&#39;t really offended, because <br/>
they&#39;ve known Holly her own life and she&#39;s pretty cool. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly had a tentative invite for a day at the mall with a sixteen <br/>
year old friend and a friend Holly&#39;s age she hasn&#39;t seen for over a year.  <br/>
She said, &quot;Rainelle&#39;s turning twelve soon, and I can tell her &#39;Now you can <br/>
watch Rocky Horror Picture Show.&#39;&quot;   Holly  said Rainelle&#39;s mom said she <br/>
couldn&#39;t watch it until she was twelve.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
Holly has watched it before it could possibly have any meaning or shock <br/>
value, and knows lots of the songs.  Rainelle has waited anxiously (when she <br/>
thought about it) and will see it when she&#39;s already coming into some sexual <br/>
thought.   It will be something she will probably NOT walk away from, but she <br/>
will study it in detail to find EVERY BIT of what was forbidden to her.  <br/>
<br/>
I like our way better.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always figured those people whose parents base their lives around <br/>
avoiding any information about evolution will have the ONLY kids who really <br/>
read Darwin.  Other kids won&#39;t care nearly as much what&#39;s in there, because <br/>
they suffered no deprivation, special schools, political action, <br/>
HOMESCHOOLING AGAINST THEIR WILL (I just realized the current worst <br/>
anti-Darwin effect) and will eventually want to know what was SO HORRIBLE.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;hey worry that they will make bad decisions for  <br/>
themselves. A couple of them said to me that they wondered if <br/>
this &quot;new thing would really work.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tell them the decisions only have to be by the moment, not by the year.<br/>
It&#39;s like walking along a path, not like buying a ticket to Mars.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They worried that they would <br/>
make bad choices if left to themselves.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could remind them they&#39;ll be right there with you, not left to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like they&#39;re picturing being cast away alone in the middle of <br/>
uncharted nowhere, instead of warm and safe at home.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Have we bred rebellion into teen life in an effort to <br/>
scuplt who they are and what they value?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, just out of generations of bad habits and the whatever-all goes with <br/>
fraternity hazing and gang initiations.  If a man had to suffer through his <br/>
dad shaming and limiting and whipping and threatening and grounding him to <br/>
&quot;be a man,&quot; why should his son get to be a man without going through the same <br/>
painful &quot;transition&quot; (hazing/initiation)?  That&#39;s my theory.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, oh, yes - at least that was the case here, for awhile..I am a Christian - a Catholic actually.  Dh and I went through a time of &quot;trying&quot; to fit the more conservative elements of Catholicism- and this was the one an only time we had difficult relatoinships/angst with our older kids...When we stopped, and thought, and went back to Catholcism without  feeling we have to be copy cat catholics - well, our relationships with our teens, and with our younger ones, returned to connecting, discussing, win-win...Leonie W. <br/>

And also remind them of the good choices they have already made , in their lives so far...One of mine felt he needed more physical exercise, so turned off the PS and went to run and play outside. He listened to his needs and made a good choice...Point out decisions like this, choices made that have been positive, to your dc...Leonoe W. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497105087">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and thank Shyrley infinitely for repeatedly<br/>
reminding me about it. I am not new to homeschooling though have done<br/>
so since my 13 yo was technicaly(sp?) old enough for school and am<br/>
also grateful to AOL&#39;s homeschool boards (back in the days) which kept<br/>
me from throwing in the towel when all I could find here in Northern<br/>
Virginia were homeschool groups affiliated with a church which ya had<br/>
to join to meet others....boo.  My dh and I too say we are saving for<br/>
our kids therapy. <br/>
Anyhoo, just to let you all know MY NOBLE opinion &lt;G&gt;: I find myself<br/>
frequently reading about, and remembering anthropology classes,<br/>
mentioning &quot;rites of passage&quot;. My son is in Boy Scouts and though<br/>
several people I know question and even strongly object to his being<br/>
in it, both my husband and I feel that it offers that &quot;rite of<br/>
passage&quot; that is lacking in our society. There is no fraternity hazing<br/>
where they drink too much and are left for dead or dive into a 8 inch<br/>
deep floor of water after chugging a fifth of vodka (the latter<br/>
happened at my college). Instead in the best case, they are carefully<br/>
trained and then tested in a manner that can be a rite of passage. The<br/>
tests are swimming, camping, living outdoors, etc.<br/>
I could say more but that seems to be enough for an intro.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the list.<br/>
<br/>
Cia<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; First of all, I LOVE this list!! I feel like I just found the gals I<br/>
&gt; started this parenting journey with. My husband and I lived in <br/>
&gt; Morocco as missionaries during our early years of parenting and <br/>
&gt; only knew two sources for those life skills--our intuition and a <br/>
&gt; few books sent to me written by Dr. Sears and LLL. I thought the <br/>
&gt; whole world parented that way! What a shock to return to the <br/>
&gt; states find out that the Ezzos had influenced every one of my <br/>
&gt; friends from college... Argh!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband and I have also been through our share of therapy <br/>
&gt; and I vowed to listen to our kids and tuck away $25.00 depostis <br/>
&gt; each time we damaged them against the day they&#39;d need that <br/>
&gt; insurance for thearpy to get over us. :) We used to say, &quot;We don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; save for college. We save for their therapy.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, Jon and I have been in the conservative Christian world <br/>
&gt; for the last twenty years. We have gone through a significant shift <br/>
&gt; in our theological beliefs (are currently churchless) and find that <br/>
&gt; that world no longer matches who we&#39;ve become (or more <br/>
&gt; accurately, who we used to be and liked being). The typical <br/>
&gt; comments from those who know us about not setting limits (we <br/>
&gt; have set some, but compared to all who know us, we&#39;re the <br/>
&gt; liberal, loosey-goosey ones) is that we&#39;re inviting rebellion. <br/>
&gt; Ironically, if there are no rules against which to rebel, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how there could be rebellion. I suppose they mean that our <br/>
&gt; kids will slide into irretrievable immorality.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of the mothers I know feel that they must set guidelines for <br/>
&gt; behavior so that their kids will be conditioned to understand <br/>
&gt; certain values. Yet one of my daughter&#39;s best friends (who is in <br/>
&gt; the most restrictive home we know) tried to kill herself last year <br/>
&gt; and is now plotting all the things she will do to herself once she <br/>
&gt; is 18 (from listening to rap, to piercing ever possible body part to <br/>
&gt; living with a boyfriend).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ironically, just since Monday when we shared our changed view <br/>
&gt; of things with our kids, I&#39;ve already encountered doubts in  my <br/>
&gt; own kids. They worry that they will make bad decisions for  <br/>
&gt; themselves. A couple of them said to me that they wondered if <br/>
&gt; this &quot;new thing would really work.&quot; They worried that they would <br/>
&gt; make bad choices if left to themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This floored me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My 13 dd said, &quot;Can we listen to Eminem?&quot; I said that I would <br/>
&gt; like to listen to it with her, if she&#39;s interested so we can talk<br/>
&gt; about it. She freaked, &quot;Mom, you&#39;re my mother. Just say no. You <br/>
&gt; can say no to me. How can I ever rebel against you if you set no <br/>
&gt; rules? I&#39;m going to call you Mrs. Bogart.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve since talked more about it, but I have to admit that I was <br/>
&gt; surprised that inside she had this picture of individuating <br/>
&gt; through some kind of rebellion. I wonder now if the very <br/>
&gt; guidelines parents set for their kids predispose them to think in <br/>
&gt; terms of rebelling for the sake of individual growth rather than a <br/>
&gt; natural process of personal discernment that evolves as the <br/>
&gt; child ages. Have we bred rebellion into teen life in an effort to <br/>
&gt; scuplt who they are and what they value?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771184395">My DS rebelled at 5!  (maybe earlier).  He rebelled against authoritative parenting, and teachers who did not respect their students.<br/>
Good for him!<br/>
It took years for me to get it.  I am sad and I have apologized about this.  He is now 17 ( out of the system for 5 years ) with freedom to choose his own path, and to hang with kids and adults who respect each other.<br/>
  <br/>
My very complacent, easy going 13 yos began calling me on few things recently.  It took me by surprise.  <br/>
It was usually something simple.  Can&#39;t remember exactly what now.  Maybe just a tone of mine.  It ruffled my feathers.<br/>
Then I realized.  Good for him!   And I apologized.  I had worried that he was too much a pleaser.  He will be fine!<br/>
<br/>
My then 5yod changed personalities when she went to kindergarten.  She became subdued.<br/>
She is 10 and free now (K was her first and last year).<br/>
She rebels against anyone who tries to &quot;do it for her&quot;, or &quot;teach her&quot; or make her &quot;perform&quot;.  Good for her!<br/>
<br/>
Our journey stared with eclectic homeschooling and evolved quickly. <br/>
I found respectful parenting and unschooling just naturally flowed together. <br/>
Good for me!  Good for our family!<br/>
