<div id="ygrps-yiv-72831725">Hello, my name is Carla. I have been subscribed to this group for <br/>
awhile, but nervous about posting.  I am 35; have 3 kids (6,3 & 1).  <br/>
My oldest is now at the age that I have to decide on a charter <br/>
school.  For my husband&#39;s comfort level, I am going to try one out <br/>
for this first year. Are there any Californians out there that can <br/>
refer me to one?  I really do not want one that imposes a curriculum <br/>
on us.</div>
