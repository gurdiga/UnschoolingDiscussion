Any recommendations on how to select a martial arts school for my 10yo <br/>
daughter? She has taken classes for a couple of years and now we&#39;re in a new <br/>
area. <br/>

puts on presentations at the local mall.  I&#39;m amazed at the &quot;black belts&quot;<br/>

Thanks. Good advice. That was one thing we liked about the old school. The <br/>
expectations were high and the curriculum rigorous.<br/>
