<div id="ygrps-yiv-48721364">Has anyone had any experience with bats?? We  have always had one bat in the <br/>
living room of our house and not minded too much, a little guano to vacuum but <br/>
not bad. He usually went out at night. We have a log house with a 22 foot <br/>
ceiling, so they are way at the top in a crevice on the ridge pole. This year we <br/>
have at least 3 in the house. We have no wish to harm the bats, and try to <br/>
live with them, but they are getting obnoxious!!! They fly around our fireplace <br/>

toilet. I think it was the baby, as he was flying around our bedroom  the other <br/>
night, and flying into things and hanging from the curtains. He is very tiny. <br/>
So we are learning a lot about bats, in a cool way, but I have had enough of <br/>
them in the house. We also have a colony of about 100 in the flashing around <br/>
our chimney outside. I don&#39;t mind those, and we have fun watching them come out <br/>
at dusk. They are little brown bats, I thought of getting a plastic owl to <br/>
frighten them out of the house. Anyone else have any ideas or funny bat stories? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Joylyn, I have been looking into the health aspects of it, and we all <br/>
have talked about not handling any bats we see, and wearing thick gloves if we <br/>
have to do so. Apparently most of the cases of rabies in bats occur in a <br/>
silver haired bat, not the little brown bat we have. But we are being careful <br/>
anyway.<br/>

I love you Nancy!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could you call a local wildlife biologist and get some ideas?<br/>
<br/>
If you know where they come in and go out from your house you could build<br/>
a bat house, seal up their entryway when they&#39;re out and place the bat<br/>
house over that spot.  Maybe they&#39;d move into it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s doing a bat study here in western MT and if I can<br/>
get ahold of her I&#39;ll ask what she thinks about friendly bat eviction. <br/>
<br/>
Until then,  can we come live with you? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336092829">Again, the rabies vaccine can be given if YOU test positive for <br/>
rabies exposure. The vaccine has mercury in it I believe. &quot;Mandatory&quot; <br/>
vaccine may be what one is told by physcians and the emergency room, <br/>
but seek information independently before receiving any vaccine! <br/>
There is an opportunity to wait a limited period of time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-997293179">Nancy -  We have had bats in our attic at least twice.  The first time, we<br/>
got netting and hung over the opening they were using to get in.  As the<br/>
bats come out of the opening they are using as a door, they drop down and<br/>
start flying.  But when they come back in the morning, they can&#39;t get under<br/>
the netting to get back inside.  After a few days, they had found somewhere<br/>
else to live, and we sprayed foam insulation  into the hole they had been<br/>
using.   If they have babies, though, they will, of course, come up with<br/>
another way to get in to them.<br/>
    The next time they moved into the attic, they used an opening that we<br/>
couldn&#39;t get the netting to hang over correctly.  So we went into the attic<br/>
and set off bug bombs.   I had read they just don&#39;t like the smell, but the<br/>
poison can&#39;t be good for them either!  This isn&#39;t really an option for you,<br/>
I guess, since your ceiling height is so high.  Besides, the bug spray would<br/>
also drive you out of the house!   A friend of ours used wasp spray, but he<br/>
was spraying it into a hole he drilled into a wall.  Maybe spraying just the<br/>
opening they are using with wasp spray would work.  I guess I am assuming<br/>
you know how they are getting in, aren&#39;t I?<br/>
    Dh and I had a bat in our bedroom once that started flying around when<br/>
we turned off the light.  We could hear it, of course, but didn&#39;t know what<br/>
it was--just that something was alive and moving!  We turned on the light,<br/>
but couldn&#39;t get out of bed because every time we sat up, the bat swooped<br/>
back down as it cirlced the room, and we&#39;d fall back to avoid it.  I don&#39;t<br/>
remember how we finally got out of bed to catch it, but we still laugh about<br/>
being stuck in bed for a few minutes, trying to figure it out!<br/>
    Good luck!  Deirdre<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, yes please!!!!!! I found a site on bat conservation today, and it talks <br/>
about bat exclusion, and shows some actual plans on how to keep them from <br/>
coming back in, but we have to wait for the end of August so the maternal period <br/>
will be over. Yikes!!!! If we seal it up now we run the risk of sealing the babe <br/>
in and it dying. Can&#39;t do that after all this time.We are learning a <br/>
phenomenal amount about Chiroptera, and loving it. Just wish they weren&#39;t in the house <br/>
and my bedroom.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have some tiny holes at the end of the ridge poles, they can squeeze into <br/>
anything. I hav seen the net idea, and will try it I think. <br/>
The swooping int he bedroom sent me screaming and hiding under the covers, I <br/>
can not control that, I just get really weirded out about them flying near me, <br/>
as much as I try to tell myself that they won&#39;t hurt me. I like them, just <br/>
not near me or in my bedroom. I also couldn&#39;t find a way to get out of the bed. <br/>
Glad to hear your story, it made me feel not so silly.<br/>

house this year, we usually have moths and mosquitoes and others here, but not so <br/>
much this year. Could be the clean up crew!<br/>

You might also try to read up on how to create a home for them in a safe <br/>
place...special bat &quot;house&quot; or garage attic.<br/>
They eat TONS of mosquitoes...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have the neighbor kids coming over to do bat-counts at night, we all ate <br/>
popsicles and counted. WE got up to 184 last night. They swoop and soar and we <br/>
now know why the bugs have not been so bad around here this year. We are <br/>
learning a lot about bats and the neighbors are as well.<br/>
We have named the baby that lives int he house Bartholemew, Bart Bat for <br/>
short. He is funny, and not such a great flyer yet. WE have rescued him a few <br/>
times now.<br/>
there is a great website, called batcon.org, that is all about bat <br/>
conservation and education. IT has  pics of all the bats you might need to know <br/>
about.Fun stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952822144">On my birthday, at about 9:00 pm, a bat somehow got into the house.  It was <br/>
swooping around, my daughter was squealing, the whole family was laughing and <br/>
running from it (Picture the movie Black Sheep).  It finally came to rest on a <br/>
bookshelf near the front door, so we opened it and &quot;swooshed&quot; it out. <br/>
<br/>
I thought, Wow, what a great way to end my birthday!<br/>
