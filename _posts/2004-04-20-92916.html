Subject: I feel like a failure<br/>
<br/>
I want to quit, but am too scared to, is this common? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Quit what? Why?  Sounds like you&#39;re not having any fun with your kids.<br/>
Perhaps you need an &quot;adult only&quot; break, or time for yourself that is not<br/>
child-centered.  Are your children very young?<br/>
<br/>
I only have 3 kids, and one is a toddler who is VERY active, very verbal,<br/>
and very curious and doesn&#39;t sleep very much.  Some days I&#39;m REALLY, REALLY<br/>
tired.  When I get grouchy, at my wits end, then I know we HAVE to do<br/>
something fun, relaxing.  A change of pace helps me a lot.  Also, talking<br/>
with my older kids, (if I feel they are not helping out enough and if that<br/>
is adding to my stress)... asking them to be a bit more helpful because I&#39;m<br/>
feeling kind of tired and grouchy.  They are always so surprised that I have<br/>
bad days, too! They go out of their way to do something nice for me (set the<br/>
table without asking, extra hugs, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
Everybody has bad days.  Are you doing too much?  Do you have a spouse who<br/>
backs you up in regards to unschooling?  In the beginning, my husband was<br/>
not so sure that what we were doing was beneficial.  As time went on, he<br/>
came around.  Those early months were tough for me personally.  I felt so<br/>
raw, so misunderstood.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you should quit -- not unschooling, but rather rethink what you ARE<br/>
doing.  Change how the day unfolds for yourself and enlist your family&#39;s<br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Get out the baby books (or old photos, etc...) and &quot;see&quot; how things HAVE<br/>
changed, how your kids have grown, learned, etc...  Sometimes I also lose<br/>
sight of the &quot;big picture,&quot; and concentrate on the relentless, annoying,<br/>
small things that bug the heck out of me.<br/>
