I read groups of words instead of single words, and sometimes I&#39;m  <br/>
reading from two lines at once.<br/>
<br/>
Those reading therapy machines they built in the 60&#39;s that drag your  <br/>
eyes left to right with only three words or so lit up are nearly  <br/>
impossible for me to read from. I can pronounce the words, but I  <br/>
can&#39;t get the meaning very well. I need to see all the words around  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Especially in those 19th century novels that were so glorified when I  <br/>
was a kid, in the 60&#39;s, like Treasure Island and Little Women and  <br/>
Oliver Twist and all those, the sentences can be 50 words long with  <br/>
the verb way down at the end.<br/>

<br/>
I thought I&#39;d answer the (sp?!) -- it can be tidbit (no hyphen) or <br/>
titbit.<br/>
<br/>
While looking it up in both Chambers (British) and Webster&#39;s <br/>
Collegiate, I ran across a word new to me in Chambers -- &quot;torpefy.&quot;  It <br/>
means to make numb or torpid, to paralyze; J.K. Rowling could have used <br/>
it as a spell. ;-)<br/>

thank you for sharing that. Maybe that is why my son has difficulies <br/>
reading because he &quot;thinks&quot; he is supposed tobe reading word for word <br/>
like they teach in school. Ahhhhhh- should of taken him out earlier but <br/>
this will be a good discussion with him.<br/>

<br/>
At the decyphering level, though, it IS one word at a time.  I sight  <br/>
read and I sight read blocks of words, phrases (same as I read music,  <br/>
I think), and only when there&#39;s a place name or a word I don&#39;t know  <br/>
do I go into phonetic mode.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think newer readers can be coached to go swirly, but letting  <br/>
them know they might get to that place might help.<br/>
<br/>
With music, it bothers me a lot when I play with someone (or sing  <br/>
madrigals or whatever) and someone is beating out time, counting,  <br/>
directing.  It&#39;s like reading phonetically.  Music can&#39;t flow if  <br/>
someone&#39;s being a human metronome, and especially if that person&#39;s  <br/>
not the lead singer or doing the melody.  It&#39;s like an anchor.  Once  <br/>
the songs are learned, it turns more to one/one time, and the ones  <br/>
might feel variable.  They don&#39;t end up sounding different, but I  <br/>
don&#39;t count 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 or WAY worse when someone&#39;s  <br/>
clearly physically somehow indicating 1 and 2 and 3 and 1 and...<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t mind a director in a large choir situation, or when I was in  <br/>
band.  With big groups it makes sense.  With a quartet or quintet or  <br/>
in a lead-singer-with-backup situation it&#39;s a godawful detriment and  <br/>
a distraction.<br/>

<br/>
I am a *very* speedy reader, but with this (even on this 3rd time seeing  <br/>
it), even though I *can* make it out, it is incredibly, almost painfully slow  <br/>
going and lots of concentration and brainwork. It really helps me  better  <br/>
understand people I know who have difficulty with reading! But I&#39;m still not  sure <br/>
how it can flip into such hard work for someone who reads so effortlessly  <br/>
otherwise...<br/>
