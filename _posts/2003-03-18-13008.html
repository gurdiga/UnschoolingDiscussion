<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030856548">Due to the increased concern and topic of conversations on this (and other) <br/>
list, I have started a new group for families with members serving in the <br/>
military. Here is the description:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is a place for unschoolers with family members in the military and for <br/>
those that support them. It is a place to connect and complain, commiserate <br/>
and celebrate.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is a short-lived list and that all our families are safe and <br/>
together again soon. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t join if you have a need to push one agenda or another.     <br/>
