I did  say that someone who doesn&#39;t have a road grader (even though<br/>
their children  have an interest) is unschooling.<br/>

 <br/>
Not at all a good definition of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a WHOLE lot more than not having a road grader.<br/>

parentheses are confusing you. Here it is without them:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; someone who doesn&#39;t have a road grader ... is unschooling<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And you&#39;re offering counterarguments to an argument that doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes along and says &quot;If you don&#39;t have TV then you aren&#39;t<br/>
unschooling,&quot; then you can come back to this.<br/>
<br/>
But right now it&#39;s not clarifying anything for anyone because no one&#39;s<br/>
showing confusion on the point of whether people can unschool without TV.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your &quot;nuance&quot; being that you apparently believe somebody somewhere has <br/>
claimed you can&#39;t unschool if you don&#39;t have a tv? I don&#39;t think <br/>
anybody has made such a claim, but in any case you are arguing that, <br/>
indeed, you can unschool without having a tv just like you can unschool <br/>
without having a road grader.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;ve gone on about this long enough for a discussion that <br/>
seems to be going absolutely nowhere and I honestly cannot see how this <br/>
is helping anybody understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Please move on.<br/>
