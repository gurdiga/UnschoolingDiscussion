<div id="ygrps-yiv-300395694">I got this privately from someone but thought it worthy of sharing with the <br/>
group;<br/>
<br/>
                                 Worry   <br/>
  <br/>
                       Is there a magic cutoff period when<br/>
                   offspring become accountable for their own<br/>
                    actions? Is there a wonderful moment when<br/>
                    parents can become detached spectators in<br/>
                  the lives of their children and shrug, &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
                         their life,&quot; and feel nothing?<br/>
  <br/>
                When I was in my twenties, I stood in a hospital<br/>
                    corridor waiting for doctors to put a few<br/>
                  stitches in my son&#39;s head. I asked, &quot;When do<br/>
                       you stop worrying?&quot; The nurse said,<br/>
                  &quot;When they get out of the accident stage.&quot; My<br/>
                  mother just smiled faintly and said nothing.<br/>
  <br/>
                  When I was in my thirties, I sat on a little<br/>
                  chair in a class-room and heard how one of my<br/>
                children talked incessantly, disrupted the class,<br/>
                       and was headed for a career making<br/>
                license plates. As if to read my mind, a teacher<br/>
                     said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they all go through<br/>
                 this stage and then you can sit back, relax and<br/>
                       enjoy them.&quot; My mother just smiled<br/>
                            faintly and said nothing.<br/>
  <br/>
                  When I was in my forties, I spent a lifetime<br/>
                 waiting for the phone to ring, the cars to come<br/>
                  home, the front door to open. A friend said,<br/>
                    &quot;They&#39;re trying to find themselves. Don&#39;t<br/>
                  worry, in a few years, you can stop worrying.<br/>
                    They&#39;ll be adults.&quot; My mother just smiled<br/>
                            faintly and said nothing.<br/>
  <br/>
                By the time I was 50, I was sick & tired of being<br/>
                    vulnerable. I was still worrying over my<br/>
                  children, but there was a new wrinkle, there<br/>
                       was nothing I could do about it. My<br/>
                 mother just smiled faintly and said nothing. I<br/>
                  continued to anguish over their failures, be<br/>
                 tormented by their frustrations and absorbed in<br/>
                             their disappointments.<br/>
  <br/>
                 My friends said that when my kids got married I<br/>
                       could stop worrying and lead my own<br/>
                    life. I wanted to believe that, but I was<br/>
                    haunted by my mother&#39;s warm smile and her<br/>
                 occasional, &quot;You look pale. Are you all right?<br/>
                      Call me the minute you get home. Are<br/>
                         you depressed about something?&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
                    Can it be that parents are sentenced to a<br/>
                  lifetime of worry? Is concern for one another<br/>
                 handed down like a torch to blaze the trail of<br/>
                      human frailties and the fears of the<br/>
                  unknown? Is concern a curse or is it a virtue<br/>
                  that elevates us to the highest form of life?<br/>
  <br/>
                    One of my children became quite irritable<br/>
                  recently, saying to me, &quot;Where were you? I&#39;ve<br/>
                  been calling for 3 days, and no one answered.<br/>
                     I was worried.&quot; I smiled a warm smile.<br/>
                           The torch has been passed.<br/>
