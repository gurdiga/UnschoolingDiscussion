&lt;&lt; At first they might just eat them all.  But buy four pounds, and keep <br/>
 refilling the bowl, and they&#39;ll probably get tired of them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had 850 gumballs last month.<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you what a LOT of gumballs that is!! I refilled a glass canister <br/>
on my counter over and over and over and.......well, you get the idea.<br/>
Everyone that came over, went home with a ziplock baggie full of gumballs.<br/>
The neighbor kids kept asking if they could have one every single day, I <br/>
finally said &quot;you can have as many as you want and you don&#39;t have to ask&quot; <br/>
they could hardly believe it.<br/>
Shay came in yesterday and went straight to the gumballs, watching me out of <br/>
the corner of her eye. She took one out while watching me still and I smiled <br/>
and walked off.<br/>
 I think she still doesn&#39;t totally believe her luck.<br/>
Anyhoo....<br/>
The last time I filled the canister was quite a while ago. It is still half <br/>
full.<br/>
So from the first fill up to the last, there has been a huge slow down in the <br/>
desire for gumballs!!<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
