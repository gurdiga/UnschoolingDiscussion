<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869200899">We just received word that HEM&#39;s NewsWatch Editor and Early Years <br/>
columnist, Linda Dobson, will be appearing live on CNBC at 7:30 EST <br/>
this evening, in a ten minute interview with Diane Diamond - talking <br/>
about &quot;What is Homeschooling?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Linda is also the author of several excellent books on homeschooling, <br/>
including &quot;The Art of Education,&quot; &quot;The Homeschooling Book of <br/>
Answers,&quot; and the new &quot;Homeschool Success Stories.&quot; This should be a <br/>
terrific interview!<br/>
<br/>
Please forward this notice to other lists!<br/>
