<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689283569">Oh thank you Pam for truly understanding!  He is VERY high energy.  Special needs are PDD-NOS and ADHD.  We belong to an indoor pool but many times does not want to go.  He is register for  swimming class starting this Tuesday, Bowling, African Drumming on Thursdays (which he loves!) and horsebackriding on Fridays.  I offer to take him to a park or indoor play place every day.  Some days he is more wiling to go than others.  We have tried organized sports (basketball, baseball, and soccer) but he ahs trouble staying on task and find the noise and activity levels overwhelming.  Thanks again!  Joanne<br/>
  ***You have to  <br/>
  support the REAL child you have - and you have a very physically  <br/>
  demanding high energy kid. Other people may not have kids who are so  <br/>
  needy of physical outlet and so may not understand how important it  <br/>
  is for him to burn off all that energy - how exhausting it can be if  <br/>
  he doesn&#39;t get that chance.*** <br/>

  **It does sound like he wears YOU out - and that description of him  <br/>
  STILL wanting to play tag after dinner when you are ready and eager  <br/>
  and needing to wind down - was very familiar to me, so you have my  <br/>
  sympathy and understanding for wanting to just say no way, because  <br/>
  you&#39;re at your low-energy time of the day and he&#39;s still energized.***<br/>
