<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391295927">The other night ds 8.5 and I started watching the movie of Jesus Christ <br/>
Superstar, and my son was quite enthralled. WE talked a lot, and he liked the <br/>
music, even tho I was singing along with every song. He enjoyed the dancing, the <br/>
guitar, the story , everything. In the past we watched Seven Brides for Seven <br/>
Brothers, and he really liked that also.<br/>
Sandra, I remember you saying that Holly likes musicals, and wondered if you <br/>
can recommend any other movies   that might capture us as much as these two <br/>
did. It was so fun to talk about JC Superstar , and how I loved it as a kid, and <br/>
the clothes, the story of Jesus, as this is the extent of his exposure. <br/>
Thanks in advance if you have any suggestions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know what Sandra is going to say &lt;BEG&gt; -- Joseph and the Amazing <br/>
Technicolor Dream Coat - the video starring Donny Osmond!!! It is <br/>
excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Fiddler on the Roof --- arguably the best musicals ever made.<br/>
<br/>
Into the Woods - the best argument against Fiddler being the best <br/>
musical ever made! &lt;G&gt; Watch the second act to make sure it isn&#39;t too <br/>
dark and upsetting for your child. (Although if you loved JC Superstar, <br/>
it&#39;ll be okay, I&#39;m sure)<br/>
<br/>
Evita - one of my favorites - maybe he is too young for it to make <br/>
sense. Madonna is fantastic in this. Antonio Banderas as Che? What more <br/>
could anybody ask? (Okay - it could have been Mandy Patinkin, who <br/>
played Che in the original broadway production. But who can complain <br/>
about Banderas?)<br/>
<br/>
Camelot - awesome.<br/>
<br/>
West Side Story - emotional, very sad - but extremely good! Romeo and <br/>
Juliet story.<br/>
<br/>
My Fair Lady - fun, great music.<br/>
Oklahoma - read some about it so you&#39;ll appreciate the innovation it <br/>
was at the time.<br/>
<br/>
CATS -- you&#39;ll love it or say, &quot;Huh?&quot; (We all love it, some of us more <br/>
than others. Okay - some here are obsessed with it.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there are two versions of JC Superstar - the old movie and a newer <br/>
video. So you might get the other and compare them.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get the original, so I had to go to the website.  My own <br/>
computer isn&#39;t &quot;browsing&quot; lately, so I had to use Kirby&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Pam&#39;s response was a good one.  Joseph & the...Dreamcoat is very kid-<br/>
friendly.<br/>
<br/>
The newer Jesus Christ Superstar is good too.  Holly has really <br/>
enjoyed comparing performances and the tone and appearance.  <br/>
<br/>
The Sound of Music is good.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s into them for the music itself and especially if he likes <br/>
lyrics and the poetry of the words, I recommend this set:<br/>
<br/>
Aladdin (Disney&#39;s)<br/>
Beauty and the Beast (ditto)<br/>
The Little Mermaid (same)<br/>
Little Shop of Horrors<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all by the same composer/lyricist team, Alan Menken and <br/>
Howard Ashman.<br/>
<br/>
For older kids and parents who aren&#39;t afraid of weirdness (some <br/>
parents will never warm up to these no matter how old they or their <br/>
kids get, and that&#39;s okay), The South Park movie is a musical, and <br/>
The Rocky Horror Picture Show on video is not nearly as nasty as it <br/>
is in a theater with the audience participation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably forgetting something good.<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re both worse (in the R-rated way) than Holy Grail.<br/>
Just to be warned.<br/>
<br/>
More visually nasty than Holy Grail (which was only verbally nasty, I think).<br/>
And by nasty, I mean sexual.<br/>
And Rocky Horror has blood.  Cartoonish, but still gross.<br/>

OH OH OH.  I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t think of this<br/>
right away!  <br/>
<br/>
Eric Idle has written a new musical, it will be in<br/>
limited run in Chicago this winter, and then Broadway<br/>
after, if it&#39;s a hit.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called Spamalot, (lmao) based on the Holy Grail<br/>
movie with some new music.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re trying to get a group together to go because we<br/>
can buy tickets right now for groups of 20 or more.  <br/>
<br/>
Our other lists (hubby&#39;s) have not gone for the idea,<br/>
AT ALL.  (Grumps!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone?  <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what ages it would be appropriate for,<br/>
but I could definitly post a review of sorts for those<br/>
whose kids might be interested, if I can get a group<br/>
together to GO.  <br/>
<br/>
My son would not be interested, as anything with<br/>
swearing or sex in it makes him leave the room!  And<br/>
Eric Idle tends to be NAUGHTY, lol.  So it&#39;s just the<br/>
two of us so far.....any takers, email me offlist ( or<br/>
on, depending on what the mods say about this! lol) <br/>

&lt;&lt;Casting is in the works for actors who will portray<br/>
more than 30 characters in Spamalot. Idle explained,<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re looking for six major funny people and two<br/>
major funny women. They play the bulk of everything.<br/>

that everybody plays everything.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
