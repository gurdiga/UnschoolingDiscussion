<div id="ygrps-yiv-506934327">&quot;I think addition to anything has something to do with something lacking<br/>
spiritually, and I think TV addition is no different.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if I get a strange desire to add numbers, it means I&#39;m lacking spiritually? DAMN! And I just thought I was finally getting over my math phobia. And I&#39;m quite sure TV addition would be much more fun than other types of addition.....hehe<br/>
