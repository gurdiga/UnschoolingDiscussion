    [Unschooling-dotcom] abuse -Dia<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Ok, yet another 
    one here that was going to stay out of this one, but<br>can&#39;t<br>&gt; &gt; 
    help myself. I am not here to agree or disagree with anyone.<br>&gt; 
    &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am here to say that even though I have been quite 
    tolerant and patient<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; &gt; these emails filling my inbox 
    these last few days, it&#39;s a bit tiring<br>&gt; seeing<br>&gt; &gt; some 
    really judgmental and quite rude statements. Everybody does things<br>&gt; 
    &gt; differently, and what works for some doesn&#39;t work for all. I 
    can<br>&gt; understand<br>&gt; &gt; soapboxes, and how people feel very 
    passionately about certain things.<br>But<br>&gt; &gt; all of the rudeness 
    has gotten to the point that it&#39;s embarrassing to<br>&gt; think<br>&gt; &gt; 
    that anyone would visit this list to subscribe and see so much 
    harshness<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt; downright meanness. It&#39;s one thing to 
    make room for other&#39;s views and<br>also<br>&gt; &gt; to disagree with them. 
    It&#39;s another to be so intolerant and rude. I&#39;m<br>&gt; weary<br>&gt; &gt; of 
    all of this, and yes Dia, I have given you some attention that 
    you<br>seem<br>&gt; &gt; to be needy of by directing this email toward you, 
    as it&#39;s mainly your<br>&gt; &gt; defensive, aggressive, condescension that I 
    am addressing.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Now, I&#39;m sure this email won&#39;t make 
    a bit of difference to some, but<br>there<br>&gt; &gt; are so many other 
    topics that we can introduce rather then allowing some<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; 
    &gt; this rudeness to continue.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Dia, could you 
    possibly reply to someone&#39;s email without dissecting it<br>and<br>&gt; &gt; 
    flaming them? (and if you want to copy and paste this into an email 
    with<br>&gt; &gt; excerpts from other emails that you have replied to 
    without flaming<br>&gt; someone,<br>&gt; &gt; feel free).<br>&gt; 
    &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Much love to all,<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Brynn<br>&gt;

    &gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] abuse<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; 
    &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;.&nbsp; Anytime you physically touch someone 
    without their<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permission, it could be 
    constituted as abuse&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;.&nbsp; 
    Accidental contact is one thing and that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; is not what I was 
    talking about.&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; These are two different 
    statements.&nbsp; The first is what I was replying<br>to.<br>&gt; &gt; You 
    said &quot;anytime&quot;.&nbsp; On another list I probably would have realized 
    that<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; writer was exaggerating somewhat, here I just 
    don&#39;t know.&nbsp; It&#39;s like<br>&gt; jumping<br>&gt; &gt; into a group of 
    pirahnas.&nbsp; I am very glad that you don&#39;t scream &quot;abuse&quot;<br>if<br>&gt; 
    &gt; someone bumps you in line.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Spanking is intentionally hurting someone<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; in a way that is 
    not acceptable. &lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; It may not be acceptable 
    in your opinion, that does not mean that it is<br>&gt; not<br>&gt; &gt; 
    acceptable to everyone.&nbsp; Your opinion is not the only one in 
    existence.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; You are humiliating your child any 
    time you lay a hand on them.&nbsp; Trust<br>&gt; me,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve 
    been one of those children.&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am not 
    humiliating my child, I am correcting my child.&nbsp; I was 
    beaten<br>as<br>&gt; a<br>&gt; &gt; child, and I know full well the 
    difference between beating and spanking.<br>&gt; &gt; No, I don&#39;t trust 
    you.&nbsp; Not even a little bit.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;

      [Unschooling-dotcom] abuse -Dia<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Ok, yet 
      another one here that was going to stay out of this one, 
      but<br>can&#39;t<br>&gt; &gt; help myself. I am not here to agree or disagree 
      with anyone.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am here to say that even though I 
      have been quite tolerant and patient<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; &gt; these emails 
      filling my inbox these last few days, it&#39;s a bit tiring<br>&gt; 
      seeing<br>&gt; &gt; some really judgmental and quite rude statements. 
      Everybody does things<br>&gt; &gt; differently, and what works for some 
      doesn&#39;t work for all. I can<br>&gt; understand<br>&gt; &gt; soapboxes, and 
      how people feel very passionately about certain things.<br>But<br>&gt; 
      &gt; all of the rudeness has gotten to the point that it&#39;s embarrassing 
      to<br>&gt; think<br>&gt; &gt; that anyone would visit this list to 
      subscribe and see so much harshness<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt; downright 
      meanness. It&#39;s one thing to make room for other&#39;s views 
      and<br>also<br>&gt; &gt; to disagree with them. It&#39;s another to be so 
      intolerant and rude. I&#39;m<br>&gt; weary<br>&gt; &gt; of all of this, and 
      yes Dia, I have given you some attention that you<br>seem<br>&gt; &gt; to 
      be needy of by directing this email toward you, as it&#39;s mainly 
      your<br>&gt; &gt; defensive, aggressive, condescension that I am 
      addressing.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Now, I&#39;m sure this email won&#39;t make 
      a bit of difference to some, but<br>there<br>&gt; &gt; are so many other 
      topics that we can introduce rather then allowing some<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; 
      &gt; this rudeness to continue.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Dia, could you 
      possibly reply to someone&#39;s email without dissecting it<br>and<br>&gt; 
      &gt; flaming them? (and if you want to copy and paste this into an email 
      with<br>&gt; &gt; excerpts from other emails that you have replied to 
      without flaming<br>&gt; someone,<br>&gt; &gt; feel free).<br>&gt; 
      &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Much love to all,<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 
      Brynn<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;

      &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;.&nbsp; Anytime you physically touch someone 
      without their<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permission, it could be 
      constituted as abuse&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;.&nbsp; 
      Accidental contact is one thing and that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; is not what I 
      was talking about.&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; These are two 
      different statements.&nbsp; The first is what I was 
      replying<br>to.<br>&gt; &gt; You said &quot;anytime&quot;.&nbsp; On another list I 
      probably would have realized that<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; writer was 
      exaggerating somewhat, here I just don&#39;t know.&nbsp; It&#39;s like<br>&gt; 
      jumping<br>&gt; &gt; into a group of pirahnas.&nbsp; I am very glad that 
      you don&#39;t scream &quot;abuse&quot;<br>if<br>&gt; &gt; someone bumps you in 
      line.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spanking is intentionally 
      hurting someone<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; in a way that is not acceptable. 
      &lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; It may not be acceptable in your 
      opinion, that does not mean that it is<br>&gt; not<br>&gt; &gt; acceptable 
      to everyone.&nbsp; Your opinion is not the only one in existence.<br>&gt; 
      &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; You are humiliating your child any time you lay a 
      hand on them.&nbsp; Trust<br>&gt; me,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been one of 
      those children.&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am not humiliating my 
      child, I am correcting my child.&nbsp; I was beaten<br>as<br>&gt; 
      a<br>&gt; &gt; child, and I know full well the difference between beating 
      and spanking.<br>&gt; &gt; No, I don&#39;t trust you.&nbsp; Not even a little 
      bit.<br>&gt;
