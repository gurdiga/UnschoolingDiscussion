&gt; ricidulous!  This is required even with good grade averages.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But the stupidest thing is they have 4 tries, from their sophmore<br/>
&gt; year to senior.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question: if they pass the thing in their sophmore year shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; they be allowed to graduate?  Watch that one be shot down by the<br/>
&gt; board.<br/>

They don&#39;t call it a &quot;system&quot; for nothing. The system wants to control your<br/>
life for as long as possible. It gets its life blood (money) from having<br/>
bodies in its buildings -- the more bodies, the more blood.<br/>
<br/>
The system is called Outcome Based Education (OBE). It means that the school<br/>
is interested in knowing that you have &quot;learned&quot; what it wants you to know.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter how long it takes you to &quot;learn&quot; it, because you can keep<br/>
taking the tests until you &quot;pass.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other reason for the tests is that the government collects personal<br/>
information about every student and the tests include several impertinent<br/>
questions, such as nationality, race, income, parent occupation, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Your question is a good one: Since high school is designed so that children<br/>
will be sure to get an 8th grade schooling, why should the state keep<br/>
children in school so long after they have acquired the 8th grade<br/>
information. The answer is that it has jobs to fill, money to spend (ours)<br/>
and people whom it wants to control. It&#39;s all a huge waste of time, money<br/>
and children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
The answer is to drop out and go to college when you&#39;re ready, or get a job<br/>
in order to start your real life - now, why wait? - or unschool in order to<br/>
learn whatever interests you. Control your own life.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to stay in the school, unless you &quot;like&quot; it.<br/>
