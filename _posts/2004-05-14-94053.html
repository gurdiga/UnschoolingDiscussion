<div id="ygrps-yiv-11205245">Our bathtub was tiny at our last house, too.  We were not allowed to have a <br/>
hottub in housing either.  So, my dh put a round galvanized watering tub for <br/>
animals on the side porch.  It was surrounded by a nice tall wooden fence.  A <br/>
few times a week we would put the boys to bed early and fill up the tub from the <br/>
hot water faucet on the washer.  It was a great fix for us and we got our <br/>
bathtub time together =)  <br/>
