<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581556782">My 8 year old pretty much watches what she wants to watch but we talk <br/>
about it. About a year ago she wanted to watch a particular show, a <br/>
cross between x files and nypdblues with comedy thrown in.  Monsters <br/>
were a bit scary, I told her I thought it might be too much for her but <br/>
she insisted she was fine.  I said OK.  She was fine for about 2 <br/>
episodes, and then the next one she wasn&#39;t fine.  Had nightmares for <br/>
weeks.  Refused to watch another show.  Swore up and down she&#39;d always <br/>
listen to me when I cautioned her.  The monsters lived in the walls of a <br/>
school--hmmmm.  Anyway, now when I say &quot;I dont&#39; think this is really <br/>
appropriate and give her my reasons, she listens, we talk and she makes <br/>
up her own mind.<br/>
<br/>
With my five year old I&#39;m a little more helpful.  I&#39;ve never said &quot;no, <br/>
you can&#39;t watch that.&quot;  I have said &quot;Janene, I think you should wait a <br/>
few more years.  It&#39;s a bit scary.&quot;  She has always been OK with that <br/>
and not really asked to watch anything I said &quot;please wait.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I dont&#39; censure books either.  I have a huge collection of holocaust <br/>
books.  I simply have asked Lexie to wait a few years on that, telling <br/>
her the subject matter was pretty difficult and I wanted her to be older <br/>
before reading those books.  She has respected that.<br/>
I think that&#39;s the key though, I respect her opinions and rights and  <br/>
have always talked to her about my decisions and so she respects mine as <br/>
well.  Sure, I occassionally loose my temper and have more than I am <br/>
proud of lost it and grounded her or something but usually after a few <br/>
hours and we calm down we talk and move on.<br/>
About bedtime.  I do sometimes say &quot;think now, sweetie, maybe you are <br/>
crying and in the midst of a meltdown because you are tired or hungry, <br/>
let&#39;s see what we can do about that.&quot;  Or &quot;let&#39;s go cuddle together for <br/>
a bit.&quot;  Helping them to see that they are screaming at their sister <br/>
because her shoe was touched and the fact that she is extremely tired <br/>
might be related is part of my job.  But both my kids will also say &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
tired, I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;  No bedtimes, no get up earlies, except for <br/>
rare occassions.  We eat when we are hungry and sleep when we are tired, <br/>
pee when our bladder is full,and we never ask permission to do any of <br/>
those things.<br/>
The bath thing is another thing though.  I don&#39;t make them take a bath <br/>
but I have said &quot;you won&#39;t be getting into MY bed smelling like that and <br/>
that is usually enough to get them to go find some water and soap.<br/>
