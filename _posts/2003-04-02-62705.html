<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415566711">Hello all!  I am *very* new to this group and am hoping<br/>
to find some words of encouragement/direction.  I apologize<br/>
in advance if this is too long...My name is<br/>
Carol and I have three sons, ages 2, 4 and 6.  I have been<br/>
homeschooling for a couple of years now and have tried many<br/>
different styles/curriculums...Recently I have been using<br/>
some suggestions by The Well Trained Mind and have found<br/>
Nebel&#39;s Tapestry of Education to be a great source.  We need<br/>
a change, however, as my son absolutely resents any suggestion<br/>
by me as to our next task, which has led to many arguments<br/>
between us.  At this point I feel it would be better for our family<br/>
and for him if I enrolled him in school, although I know in my <br/>
heart that that is not the answer I seek.  I am the type of <br/>
person who needs structure and planning - I need to know where I&#39;m <br/>
going and have my list of things to accomplish.  I also seem to have <br/>
a very difficult time coming up with activities/ideas on the fly.  <br/>
This style, though, does not suit my son - so it seems.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this.  How can I transition to an unschooling approach,<br/>
being the type of person that I described?  (I&#39;ve read the info.<br/>
on many websites I&#39;ve found, but am still not sure how to even<br/>
begin!)  I know that I need to trust my son, but he often chooses<br/>
to not do things which I feel are constructive activities (eg., he<br/>
loves to play his gameboy - something I limit to a certain extent -<br/>
as opposed to reading, drawing, etc...)  I guess I don&#39;t even know<br/>
where I&#39;m headed with my questions and the frustration I&#39;m feeling is<br/>
probably quite clear!  Any words of wisdom would be greatly<br/>
appreciated!  Thank you in advance.<br/>
<br/>

You need to learn and then trust how natural learning happens.<br/>
<br/>
Organization can still be your best skill and your favorite hobby. Just <br/>
organize something besides your son&#39;s learning schedule!<br/>

Here is something on deschooling yourself<br/>

I think a fundamental requirement for unschooling is being able to let<br/>
go of the idea that suffering is &quot;better for you&quot; than pleasure. <br/>
Certainly one must be able to believe that play is as important as work<br/>
in order to unschool.<br/>

When you stop arguing with him, he might be able to show you how it all <br/>

thermonuclear physics or pottery.  Just get out of his way and let him do <br/>
what he needs to do.<br/>

busy yourself with reading.  I think someone sent some nice links to you <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971278493">Yeah about the whole gameboy thing.  I am sure my<br/>
son&#39;s gameboy helped him to learn how to read.  And<br/>
one time I had him show me how to play his Pokemon<br/>
game.  And it was fun and I was so surprised to learn<br/>
how much he actually knew about the game.  And this<br/>
was when he was 4!<br/>
