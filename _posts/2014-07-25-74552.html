<div id="ygrps-yiv-973249806"><p><span>So this has been stated in my direction twice recently. I have been told that because our daughter is very bright (has been referred to as &#39;gifted&#39; if such a thing exists?) that I am &quot;not being fair on her&quot; by not having her at school. Somehow this correlation is made. Both sets of grandparents feel similarly. Its tough to hear this because it tugs at my doubts. So then I wonder whether unschooling is right afterall. All those hours spent watching movies, jumping on the trampoline, playing on the ipod, listening or reading Harry Potter, lots of other times when it looks like she&#39;s not doing much at all...... is she bored? Am I doing enough? Is keeping her in the world and at home not stimulating enough? Maybe its honing in on my constant question over HOW to keep her stimulated when she isn&#39;t one of those very busy kids into everything doing everything all the time. I think her mind is very active. Its not visible though nor can I produce anything that reflects this busy mind to satisfy myself and others that she&#39;s DOING stuff so of course its fair - see - she&#39;s doing all this stuff!!</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>So, I find myself quite taken aback when I am accused of being unfair to my daughter by not sending her to school to be challenged and stimulated.</p><p><br></p><p>Has anyone else met with these types of comments?</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12691657"><blockquote><span title="ireply"><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">&gt;&gt;has been referred to as &#39;gifted&#39; if such a thing exists?&lt;&lt;</span><br> </div></span></blockquote><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;"><br>


</span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">Personally, I believe it&#39;s a bit of a trap to see a child as gifted.  Here&#39;s why I think so. I was labeled gifted as a young child. In my opinion, that set me up for failure. When I was very young, some skills came quickly and easily to me. I read early. I was very good with numbers. The things I was good at also happened to be things family and teachers placed a lot of value on.  But, in time, my skills evened out, and </span><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">I began to find I couldn&#39;t live up to people&#39;s inflated expectations of me. Consequently, I felt like a constant disappointment to those I aimed to please. I felt ashamed.</span><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;"> Turned out, I was pretty average. </span><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">The worst part was that I had learned that average wasn&#39;t anywhere near as remarkable as being special or gifted or bright or any one of those labels we like to reward children with.  I felt like a fraud for years afterward -- oddly, like *I* had duped people into believing I was special. Strange, but true.  And sad.  And, hard to overcome, emotionally.  </span></div>


<div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">True prodigies will reveal themselves when they find that one special pursuit (or multiple pursuits) they excel at. Otherwise (and most likely even still) I believe, as unschooling parents, it is best to focus on providing the best possible environment we can for our children to ensure they learn and thrive with lots of room to discover and explore their own strengths, and plenty of uncoerced opportunities to develop in places that might present more challenges.  In my opinion unschooling will work well for children of all abilities when the focus is on partnering with the whole child.  Look at your child.  Not at what you think about your child.  Not about what others tell you about your child. Look at her whole self.  Encourage others to see her this way too, if and when you can.  </span></div>


<div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;"><br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> </span></blockquote></span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">&gt;&gt;So then I wonder whether unschooling is right afterall.&lt;&lt;</span><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;"><br>


 </span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">It depends what you want for your daughter, for yourself, and for your family.  It depends on what your partner or husband wants, if that applies.  It depends on what your daughter wants.  It depends how well you understand or are willing to work to understand what you are doing and why.  It depends on your commitment to making unschooling work well. For a deeper understanding of unschooling, Pam Larrichia&#39;s books and email series are wonderful:</span></div>

I asked the same question a few years back. I got an excellent, but unexpected reply. I was told if I thought I wasn&#39;t doing enough, then to do more.  Now, if our unschooling days start to feel a bit stale to me, I try to make them lively again by using what I know about my son to introduce something(s) fresh to our experience. Doing this has never lead me astray. It might take me in a completely different direction from what I had in mind, but, to me, that&#39;s a big part of the fun of this life.</span></div>

Schools (at least in my experience) are trying to teach all kids this age the same thing. Since not all kids are ready, kids who learn a bit more quickly are apt to be bored. Some schools have &quot;gifted&quot; programs, but most don&#39;t. Even if they do, the things they aim to teach may not engage your daughter&#39;s interest. You are in the best position to offer her a stimulating environment. <br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:18.6667px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br><span></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:18.6667px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span>I think most of us probably feel sometimes like we aren&#39;t &quot;doing enough&quot; to provide stimulation and opportunities. I can usually tell when he&#39;s getting bored or restless. He doesn&#39;t necessarily know what he wants, but is open to ideas at that point. Some ideas are vetoed, others we try. Occasionally, we hit on an idea that becomes a new regular thing (like bowling with Grandpa) that is eagerly anticipated.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:18.6667px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br><span></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:18.6667px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span>One thing I started

He just needs to talk&nbsp;through everything he is doing and to whom ever is near by , and he always had way to many questions that&nbsp;needed answering for a school setting to cope with, but he&nbsp;couldn&#39;t &nbsp;stop doing it because thats who he is - he has always chatted to&nbsp;everyone and anyone, desperate to impart&nbsp;his knowledge, and&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;good at talking to adults in social situations -&nbsp;charming, funny and interesting, and it does throw many as they are not expecting it, and my friends&nbsp;have always&nbsp;marvelled&nbsp;at how much he chats to me and tells me stuff &nbsp;so it does appear&nbsp;that he is a &#39;social&nbsp;prodigy&#39;!
