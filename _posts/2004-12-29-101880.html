<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466201762">Hi there! <br/>
<br/>
My oldest (almost 14) has decided that she wants to go to college. <br/>
<br/>
Ack! <br/>
<br/>
How do I go about making a transcript for her?<br/>
<br/>
And what does she need to do as far as real studying goes? <br/>
<br/>
Should we rush out and buy a curriculum? Or should we wait until <br/>
she&#39;s closer to 16 or 17 and then try to cram it all in? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a true rookie at this!! She&#39;s my oldest child and I&#39;m clueless!! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559074716">I wouldn&#39;t buy a curriculum.<br/>
 <br/>
Here are some stories to read and consider, and you might see if she can  <br/>
take a class or two soon, to try it out. Easy, fun stuff.<br/>

update to that, but he&#39;ll still be home)<br/>

<br/>
My older dd is 19 and attending her second year at the community <br/>
college.  She chose not to take the SATs, and it wasn&#39;t required for <br/>
the community college.  I prepared a transcript for her, modeling it <br/>
after a sample I found online.<br/>
<br/>
My younger dd is 15, and just recently started thinking about <br/>
college.  At this point, she plans on taking the SATs, so we found a <br/>
book with sample tests to find out what type of material is tested.  <br/>
The tests didn&#39;t seem all that hard to her, except the math section.<br/>
<br/>
I brought different questions to this discussion group several weeks <br/>
ago, when my dd-15 began talking about college.  Nearly all of her <br/>
friends are being encouraged by their parents to set goals and <br/>
choose a college.  Since then, she has been looking at different <br/>
college websites and the admission requirements.  She readily <br/>
admits, though, that she really doesn&#39;t know what she wants to study <br/>
in college.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting in my library bag is &quot;Homeschoolers&#39; College Admissions <br/>
Handbook&quot; by Cafi Cohen.  I picked it up from our library just <br/>
before we left for Florida, so I haven&#39;t had a chance to read it yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849692765">My two oldest are in college and I&#39;ve never had to make up a <br/>
transcript.  They enrolled in an open admission community college <br/>
without one and then my oldest transferred to a four year school with <br/>
just his community college transcript.  The next transfer in the <br/>
fall.  They both love it.<br/>

There&#39;s also a book called &quot;Cool Colleges for the Hyper-Intelligent,  <br/>
Self-Dircected, Late Blooming, and Just Plain Different.&quot;  By Donald  Asher.  It&#39;s a <br/>
college guide book, and just reading it inspires one to try  college, but not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596063028">Allison McKee&#39;s book, &quot;From Homeschool to College and Work&quot; details the <br/>
process her family went through to construct application packages for traditional <br/>
four year colleges when her always unschooled kids decided they wanted to try <br/>
college after all. Not how to plan ahead so your kid will get into college 4 <br/>
years from now, but how to document the real learning and living that happened <br/>
during the teen years in a way that will make colleges take notice. <br/>
<br/>
One thing Allison mentions when she talks about getting into college is that <br/>
her son had high verbal SAT&#39;s and low math SAT&#39;s and she&#39;s convinced the high <br/>
verbal scores really helped his applications more than the low math scores <br/>
hurt him. She says that had they spent his teen years trying to work on math <br/>
skills, he likely wouldn&#39;t have been as interested in or had the time for the <br/>
pursuits that enabled him to score well on the verbal portion - with the result <br/>
that he would have had mediocre scores in both areas and been much less <br/>
attractive to the college he wanted to attend. <br/>
