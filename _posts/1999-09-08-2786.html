<div id="ygrps-yiv-373827857">Okay everyone, ponder this.  DS went to day camp for a week this summer at<br/>
the church wher I work.  I was busy that week and not around much.  The<br/>
woman I work with has reservations about this HS thing so she was watching<br/>
him pretty closly, thinking that he has to be missing something important<br/>
and how will he ever learn to get along with other kids.  So after the week<br/>
she tells me she was really concerned about him because he didn&#39;t come in<br/>
and talk to her like the other kids.  I say so what was he doing and she<br/>
says well he spent all his time with Zach (one of his PS friends)  I say so<br/>
did Zach come in and talk to you? Well, no.  so does that make you think<br/>
there is something &quot;wrong&quot; with Zach?  Well, no - but that&#39;s different.<br/>
(Hmm - Why?)<br/>
So I told her that They really hadn&#39;t had much time together this summer and<br/>
they were just enjoying each other&#39;s company. And if Zach hadn&#39;t been there<br/>
I was sure he would have made friends with some other kids, (because he has<br/>
in similar situations) but he just didn&#39;t need to with Zach around. Seemed<br/>
like pretty independant behavior to me.<br/>
<br/>
The really amazing thing was there was another boy their same age that they<br/>
tried to interact with.  His mother was along for the week and he was a real<br/>
pain, hanging on her, arguing about where they were going to sit on the bus,<br/>
wanting all of her attention, etc and not interacting with the other kids at<br/>
all - but no one questioned his behavior.  (Except his mom - he was making<br/>
her crazy)  I can only imagine what the response would have been had I gone<br/>
along and my DS had acted like that.  I wonder why people set up different<br/>
standards for homeschooled kids?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else experienced anything like that?<br/>

Yep everytime my 7yo tells his cousins to go home they are getting on his <br/>
nerves &lt;g&gt;...<br/>
<br/>
Cousin&#39;s parents get irate when he does that at his grandma&#39;s house.  Of <br/>
course it&#39;s because he&#39;s unsocialized, not because the cousin&#39;s parents drop <br/>
them off for three and four day stretches and disappear into the blue.  We go <br/>
out there for a 4 day visit and have to deal with 6 other kids hanging <br/>
around.  The 7 yo has about enough socialization in 2 days from them than he <br/>
wants all year.  Course it&#39;s all his fault, he&#39;s unsocialized.... I&#39;d <br/>
disagree and say the cousins are underparented.<br/>

Oh yes!!!  I especially detest the ps moms who will say, &quot;Let&#39;s play a math <br/>
game &quot;...or spelling, or whatever, and then use it to &quot;test&quot; how much your <br/>
kid knows!!!!  My dd can hold her own, but it makes me sooooo mad that the <br/>
moms do this only to hs/us kids, that I always jump in and say &quot;Ooooh, <br/>
that&#39;ll be fun....I&#39;ll play too!!&quot;  Hehehe<br/>

Yes, last time we visited the inlaws, my sister-in-law pounced on the fact <br/>
that James was shy and didn&#39;t say anything for the first 5-10 minutes after <br/>
we arrived.  **Shouldn&#39;t he be going to Kindergarden this year so he can <br/>
learn to get over that?**<br/>
<br/>
It seems obvious that she was watching him like a hawk, looking for any <br/>
excuse to bring up her suggestion that he should go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding your situation, I always figure that the kids who cluster around <br/>
the teacher-figure for attention aren&#39;t getting enough adult attention at <br/>
home.  Your friend&#39;s judgement seems VERY biased.<br/>

Hey, here&#39;s some good news on the hsing front.  We finalized registration <br/>
(paid) for the kids&#39; music lessons.  This was our 2nd visit to the music <br/>
school.  Between the 1st and 2nd visit the music teacher has pulled his <br/>
daughter out of ps and is hsing her!  She will be there (along with another <br/>
hsed boy) when my kids are getting their lessons.  And I feel like the <br/>
teahcer will be more understanding of where we are coming from.  He seems <br/>
great anyway but this was the icing on the cake.  And my husband got to meet <br/>
him and liked him too!  He rarely gets to actually meet any of the people we <br/>
deal with during the day, so this was a nice plus for him.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

Well, we are just starting.  We have a piano at home so I guess we better <br/>
learn how to use it!  Seriously, both the kids are interested in learning <br/>
more.  How to read music and how to write their own songs.  My daughter wants <br/>
to conduct and sing.  Son wants to quickly move to another instrument -- <br/>
guitar or trumpet.  Where can I buy some ear plugs??   But the classes start <br/>
with the basics of reading music and keyboarding -- the teacher has all sorts <br/>
of electronic/computer pianos.  He was very quick to tell me that he will be <br/>
getting a regular piano moved into the next room -- &quot;so the kids don&#39;t think <br/>
this is what a real piano looks like.&quot;  He seems very enthusiastic and fun.  <br/>
He also repeated that &quot;they can&#39;t just sit at the keyboard when they are so <br/>
young (4 and 6)&quot; so he has lots of different instruments and activities for <br/>
them.  They will be in groups of no more than 4, 1 or 2 times a week, we have <br/>
to get the final schedule still, but it will be 20 lessons over a semester <br/>
worked into everyone&#39;s schedule.   Glad to hear your kids are enjoying the <br/>
music so much -- maybe we&#39;re doing the right thing!!<br/>

They really are!  We will be going into our 3rd year starting in Feb.  The <br/>
boys love it, especially the big festival over memorial weekend.  They get to <br/>
compete with 3 other schools, duets , solos and bands.  It is a lot of fun.  <br/>
They have learned a great deal and the school has become their social club!  <br/>
Good luck,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, not quite but recently we visited a church in our local area and the<br/>
kids were invited to a kids club meeting.  Ten children showed up,<br/>
including my 2.  We were the only hs kids in the lot.  I never saw such an<br/>
unruly bunch in my life - no respect for the teacher at all.  My kids just<br/>
sat or stood and looked at them.  These kids couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t sit still,<br/>
interrupted the teacher, argued with her, were mean to one another, etc.  I<br/>
stood by watching and thinking to myself - Hmmm, so that is what ps<br/>
socialization gets you.  Glad we hs!  <br/>
<br/>
Now really I know that these things are learned at home not at ps.  But we<br/>
all know hs kids are compared to ps kids in socialization skills.  Well,<br/>
why was it my two were the only ones who would line up when asked, listened<br/>
when asked, sat still, raised their hands when they needed to, etc.  Sure<br/>
showed me that socialization is not a hsers problem at all if they teach<br/>
respect and orderliness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729569350">I am very rushed right now but I want to raise &quot;attachment&quot; parenting as a<br/>
topic. In Vancouver, B.C. is a psychologist, Gordon Neufeld, who teaches<br/>
attachment parenting in workshops.  He believes much &quot;independence&quot; that<br/>
people are so proud of in their children is actually displaced dependence<br/>
which winds up being dependence on peers.  So you wind up with peer dependent<br/>
kids role modeling themselves after their peer group which is a highly<br/>
abnormal and dangerous state of affairs given that children don&#39;t really have<br/>
all they need to guide each other. Many of these kids appear very independent<br/>
but looks are deceiving.<br/>
<br/>
So cherish the &quot;clingyness&quot;  of your kids because it is a healthy<br/>
manifestation of adult identified kids.  It is a normal characteristic of<br/>
children which should be treated with respect.  Their fearfulness keeps them<br/>
where they need to be until they are truly ready to face the challenges of the<br/>
larger world.<br/>
<br/>
Again someone commented on the way in which are culture concentrates on<br/>
separation from family as you grow older instead of seeing the family as an<br/>
ongoing entity with many generations which supports all of its members and<br/>
from which you never need to &quot;separate&quot; because it is a loving supportive<br/>
network..<br/>
<br/>
The children in the world that are most at risk are not the least bit shy<br/>
around strangers and don&#39;t have that healthy amount of caution which keeps<br/>
them pointed in the right direction which is towards their parents.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta run though I would love to go on a greater length.  I am being<br/>
delinquent as it is.<br/>

&gt; &gt; otherwise I would be quite worried about this.  If it&#39;s not because we<br/>
&gt; &gt; hs, then it&#39;s my fault bc I breastfed her too long!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hehehe....that extended nursing gets blamed for just about everything.  my<br/>
&gt; older son is pretty clingy andfamily oriented (much more outgoing--he now<br/>
&gt; has 4 friends whose houses he would go to for short periods) but he still<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t let me leave the park during soccer or leave the building where<br/>
&gt; he has an art class.  many people are convinced if he would totally wean<br/>
&gt; he would ask to go to school , on over nights, to camp.....NOT ON HIS<br/>
&gt; LIFE!  he still claims he will live next door to me when he is married<br/>
&gt; (which is an improvement.  a few years ago, he was going to live next door<br/>
&gt; to me, but come home to sleep in my bed at night)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702366284">I burst into tears everytime I read &quot;Love You Forever&quot; by Robert Munsch.  My<br/>
children watch me carefully when I read it because they know the waterworks will<br/>
start.  It is too hard for me to read much.<br/>

That is just fascinating! I had never thought of it that way but it makes <br/>
good sense! Of course, it makes me feel much better too! Lol! thanks for that <br/>

<br/>
Thank you for posting this.  This is a key to helping me understand something <br/>
that had been bugging me.  In the last year I read the book _The Nurture <br/>
Assumption_, which analyzes a bunch of psychological studies and proves that <br/>
(when you look at large populations) almost all of a parents contribution to <br/>
their child&#39;s behavior is genetic.  The variable that has the most impact on <br/>
how the kids turn out is the quality of the peer group the kids hang out <br/>
with.  When this book was published, there was a big splash in the media <br/>
saying *parents don&#39;t count*.<br/>
<br/>
What you had to say makes me see her ideas in a whole new light.<br/>

I remember when our unschoolers group went to a performance of &quot;The <br/>
Nutcracker&quot; which was specifically for school kids.  That theatre was a mess <br/>
... except for the 2 rows of our kids....they were quiet and orderly because <br/>
they were unschooled, yes, but I also think they were quiet because they were <br/>
in shock!!!  They all just sat there in amazement that kids would act like <br/>
that!! <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have had many similar experiences.  Our homes school group went to Fort<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Discovery  this past spring.  We must have been the only hs group there<br/>
because ours were the only children who were not wild!!!!!  If I had not<br/>
seen the film on sound before I would have been lost.  All the children but<br/>
ours were screaming and shouting so you could hardly hear.  <br/>
Also I have found that my ds always gets compliments when we go to the<br/>
doctor or dentist or when he has had to go to the hospital for testing and<br/>
sickness.  They always tell him and me what a sweet, polite and well<br/>
behaved child he is.  They almost always think that hs has everything to do<br/>
with his behavior.</div>
