<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609721288">Hi this is my first post. I am struggling with a core question <br/>
perhaps related to the teaching vs learning topic. I chose to <br/>
homeschool because I do not like the paradigm of school where <br/>
children wait to be taught rather than to go and find. Alas one year <br/>
of unschooling was frustrating for me because my children did very <br/>
little but listen ot tapes, read so so books and argue. And chores. I <br/>
tried being inspiring by doing projects myself but the 10 year old <br/>
especially just did his own thing of reading and going out after 3 to <br/>
be with his buddies.  I am not sure I want to start another year of <br/>
watching them around and listen/read or bicker. I also do not look <br/>
forward to MAking them sit down and do  &quot;school&quot;. I don&#39;t think I <br/>
could be very convincing anyway because I abhore doing unasked for <br/>
busy work. My 10 year old acts as if he is allergic to work. The 8 <br/>
year old has asked for a curriculum this year the 10 says he will not <br/>
do anything that comes from a curriculum. I am considering using <br/>
loosely oak meadow for the third grader. I would love some advise or <br/>
just discussion that could help me illuminate my next steps. I am <br/>
learning to be a better write on email but I hope you can work with <br/>
the disjointed quality of my posts. Thank you. This looks like an <br/>
interesting discussion group. Josie</div>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never done either one.  <br/>
Get out and do things with them. REAL things.  Outside your house.  And when <br/>
you get used to the learning that happens in the presence of new stimuli, you <br/>
can more easily create new-stimuli situations inside your home.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My 10 year old acts as if he is allergic to work. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet he&#39;s not allergic to fun.  Make work fun.<br/>
<br/>
I bet he IS allergic to insult.  Don&#39;t suggest to him that you think he&#39;s <br/>
allergic to work.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re learning AND having fun, why would one want a curriculum?  <br/>
<br/>
Your job as an unschooling parent is to find or create adventure.  Don&#39;t sit <br/>
and wait for an exciting life to materialize.  Instigate it!<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re seeing unschooling as a path that will lead them where you<br/>
want them to go. That will be frustrating for all of you!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe look at unschooling as finding a special tree in the forest and<br/>
creating the environment it needs to grow. You don&#39;t need to do anything to<br/>
the tree itself. It already knows how to be and grow into a tree. All it<br/>
needs is the environment to do what it know hows to do.<br/>
<br/>
So unschooling is akin to making sure the tree has access to what that<br/>
particular tree needs in order to be that particular tree.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Get out and do things. Don&#39;t worry about educational. Do things you think<br/>
you&#39;d all enjoy. Have a picnic. Explore a place you&#39;ve never been to. Eat at<br/>
an ethnic restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
(But let them do home things too! Watch TV. Play video games. Bake cookies.)<br/>
<br/>
If *you* aren&#39;t learning for pure enjoyment, is it reasonable to expect that<br/>
they will? If your purpose of doing a project is to inspire them to do the<br/>
project, you&#39;re going to be disappointed. Do things *you* want to do without<br/>
the agenda. Go places you want to that you think they might enjoy<br/>
accompanying you. Offer to take them places to further their own interests.<br/>
<br/>
When you come across something that connects with an interest they have or<br/>
that you think is cool and fun to play with bring it home and leave it<br/>
laying around.<br/>
<br/>
Foster in *yourself* a need to explore, to notice the coolness in things, to<br/>
be curious. Do this *for yourself* not as a method to get the kids to be<br/>
more the way you&#39;d like them to be. (If you aren&#39;t honestly and sincerely<br/>
curious about life and exploring for yourself, then it isn&#39;t fair to expect<br/>
them to be.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and argue.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A book that many people have found very helpful is Siblings Without Rivarly<br/>
by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380799006/qid=984825970/sr=1-1/ref=s<br/>
c_b_2/102-3006399-8134511<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a *very* easy read with cartoon and dialog standard scenarios that<br/>
we&#39;ve all experienced and how the standard response leads down the path<br/>
we&#39;re trying to avoid and a number of ways to approach it differently. Their<br/>
&quot;How To Talk So Kids Will Listen&quot; book really helped me to see things from<br/>
my daughter&#39;s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am considering using<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would considering asking your younger son what he&#39;d like to know more<br/>
about and getting some books and taking him places. And keep checking<br/>
because he may not want to go much into depth. Be flexible. I&#39;d also finds<br/>
some great books on tape that might appeal to both of them and listen to<br/>
them in the car. (Ask here. And check http://www.chinaberry.com). Share your<br/>
favorite old movies with them. Talk about your childhood in relation to the<br/>
movies. Look at albums of your childhood and theirs. (It&#39;s history to them!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that a curriculum would be bad, but his asking may not be because<br/>
he loves structure but because he&#39;s felt at loose ends and needs a fellow<br/>
explorer to accompany him on his journey :-)<br/>
