What keeps you going isn&#39;t some fine destination but just the road <br/>
you&#39;re on and the fact that you know how to drive. ~~ Barbara <br/>
Kingsolver<br/>
<br/>

DECISIONS, DECISIONS<br/>
http://home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/196.html<br/>
<br/>
I have been musing. My grandmother was born in 1897 and was 101 when <br/>
she died. She was born in the Ukraine and came to the US when she was <br/>
14. Who would have, could have, imagined the changes in her lifetime? <br/>
In our lifetimes?<br/>
<br/>
I can only imagine what she would have said had she been told about <br/>
being prepared for her future. For my grandmother: a new country, a <br/>
new language, a new culture, electricity, cars, telephones, man on <br/>
the moon, computers, Mars exploration--the list is endless.<br/>
<br/>
For us, the list continues to grow. Who knows what the future will be <br/>
for our children?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that when we are asked about preparing our kids for <br/>
their futures, we and they truly can only be prepared to be active <br/>
participants in the present--and if we know how to find out what we <br/>
need to know, we&#39;ll do just fine. We don&#39;t need to know all the <br/>
answers; we need to be able to ask the questions and to try to find <br/>
out what we need to know.<br/>
<br/>
The 21st century certainly doesn&#39;t need standardized thinkers.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts<br/>
Debra Bures, buresfam@...<br/>
<br/>
Who can imagine the future our children will face? Beyond the <br/>
unfathomable changes in society, technology, medicine, and other <br/>
variables, what personal changes will affect their decisions, shape <br/>
their lives? How can we best help them prepare for whatever curve <br/>
balls life might decide to pitch their way?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always thought one of the most valuable and underrated aspects <br/>
of homeschooling was the opportunity to makes one&#39;s own choices and <br/>
decisions, to step away from the mainstream herd-like group-think. <br/>
And yet this singular advantage is in grave danger of disappearing as <br/>
more and more parents seek not something different from schools and <br/>
schooling, but simply to teach school in a different location.<br/>
<br/>
The message of homeschooling being advanced by many businesses (&quot;Our <br/>
curriculum guarantees success!&quot;), and organizations (&quot;Homeschoolers <br/>
test above average!&quot;) does nothing to dispel the notion of <br/>
homeschooling as merely school in the home. Combined with the scare <br/>
tactics of an educational bureaucracy struggling to justify its <br/>
existence (&quot;If you can read this, thank a teacher!&quot;) and the <br/>
ceaseless drumbeating of a man who wants to be known as &quot;the <br/>
Education President&quot; (&quot;No Child Left Behind&quot;), there&#39;s little room <br/>
for parents to consider any decision that leads away from traditional <br/>
models of education. Parents who were trained as children to use the <br/>
schoolish model find reassurance in using the schoolish model with <br/>
their own children, especially when the experts, professionals, and <br/>
even some homeschooling recruiters tell them that&#39;s what works best. <br/>
But is it?<br/>

CALIFORNIA HOMESCHOOLERS<br/>
<br/>
California has no homeschooling law, but that could change. Public <br/>
officials who believe homeschooling should be defined and regulated <br/>
have become more outspoken in suggesting that we need a new law. <br/>
Cindy Cotter runs a discussion group devoted to considering the laws <br/>
and legal issues that affect California homeschoolers. Is a new law <br/>
imminent? Should we fight it or try to steer it?  What might a new <br/>
law look like?  What can we live with? What do laws look like in <br/>
other states? What would be the effect of a new law on our <br/>
homeschooling practices? Would a new law affect private ISP&#39;s? Who <br/>
are our allies, who are our foes? What strategies would help as we <br/>
oppose or amend a bill? If you&#39;d like to join the discussion, you can <br/>
find the group at the following website: <br/>

<br/>
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My husband and I have made the decision to homeschool our two <br/>
children. Our daughter is two and our little boy just 3 months old. <br/>
So what&#39;s my homeschooling problem this early in the game? All of my <br/>
friends with two-year-olds are enrolling them in preschool programs. <br/>
Since I&#39;m going to homeschool, I really would prefer to teach our <br/>
little girl her colors, numbers, alphabet at home. We belong to a <br/>
playgroup where she is learning to share and play with others. But am <br/>
I missing something by denying her an official &quot;preschool <br/>
experience?&quot; ~ Jean Hershner ~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is different about parents who homeschool? Given all our <br/>
cultural conditioning, that of our parents, and the school structure, <br/>
what are the reasons that make some of us jump ship even at great <br/>
sacrifice sometimes?&quot; ~ Jean Reed, author of The Home School Source <br/>

UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
I eased into unschooling. Kirby didn&#39;t go to kindergarten. I <br/>
registered to homeschool, figuring if he did well I had the option to <br/>
put him in first grade the next year. If he didn&#39;t do well, he could <br/>
go to kindergarten the year after, or we could keep homeschooling. I <br/>
knew four homeschooling families from the babysitting co-op I was in. <br/>
Most of the other moms were La Leche League Leaders. I wasn&#39;t a <br/>
leader, but that was my &quot;gang of moms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two of the families were structured homeschoolers who (not <br/>
coincidentally, I think) hit their kids, shamed them, and weren&#39;t too <br/>
close and intimate with their kids intellectually. They had been <br/>
gentle with the infants, and nursed on demand, but it didn&#39;t <br/>
translate to the way they treated eight- and ten-year-olds.<br/>
<br/>
Two families were unschooling. One family went from three to four <br/>
children during that time (I still know them, and two of those <br/>
now-teens were over here last night). The other family went from four <br/>
to five children in those babysitting co-op years, and they&#39;re up to <br/>
nine and are probably not actively involved in homeschooling. Her <br/>
husband is a minister and some of the kids are going to a small <br/>
school the church runs.<br/>
<br/>
Surrounded by good and bad examples, and having seen how Kirby was in <br/>
two classes he took (dance and art), I thought he and school would <br/>
not yet be a match. Within a month I was hooked and that was that for <br/>
Kirby, but I thought Marty was so much different from Kirby he might <br/>
want to go to school. He didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And then I thought maybe Holly would want to go to school just to be <br/>
away from the boys, and independent.  She didn&#39;t. But yet she does, <br/>
in a way. She likes to take classes and get herself into structured <br/>
situations. I support her but I don&#39;t play enforcer for her.<br/>
<br/>
So, none of them has ever been to school. Marty hasn&#39;t even visited. <br/>
Holly has visited three occasions (four if you count going to college <br/>
classes one day with a friend, from which the then-seven-year-old <br/>
Holly learned about and later discussed &quot;inertia&quot;). Kirby has been to <br/>
a couple of school assembly functions, but not to a classroom.<br/>
<br/>
  Kirby was big into pointing at letters and naming them even before <br/>
he could tell someone how old he was. It didn&#39;t lead to early <br/>
reading. He read when he was eight, fluently at ten, I guess.  Marty <br/>
read at nine, fluently at ten or eleven.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wasn&#39;t reading at ten. She wasn&#39;t happy about it, either. She <br/>
is at the point now where she is reading words without meaning to. <br/>
For fun she tries to walk around the house without recognizing any <br/>
words. At eleven, she&#39;s still not reading chapter books. But if you <br/>
met her and talked to her you wouldn&#39;t think for a second, &quot;I bet <br/>
this kid doesn&#39;t even read,&quot; because there&#39;s not much she can&#39;t talk <br/>
about, and if she knows nothing about it but it sounds interesting, <br/>
she&#39;ll ask intelligent questions.<br/>
<br/>
I like the amazement that it works. I still have it too, when one of <br/>
my kids says or does something that is news to me, and I wonder where <br/>
they got it. ~~ Sandra Dodd, unschooling.com message board ~~<br/>

<br/>
FREE AUDIO BOOKS ONLINE<br/>
<br/>
My kids and I have spent many happy hours listening to audio books on <br/>
tape and CD in the van. A trip to Grandma&#39;s house isn&#39;t complete <br/>
without at least a couple of stories to listen to. We usually check <br/>
them out at the library, but now you can download them off the <br/>
Internet and burn your own CDs or listen right on your computer. Most <br/>
of the books at the following sites are in the public domain, so they <br/>
aren&#39;t the latest best sellers, but many have been around a while <br/>
because they&#39;re a good read.<br/>
<br/>
One site I really like is Free Audiobooks <br/>
(http://www.audiobooksforfree.com). They have a wide selection of <br/>
books from various genres, including classics, westerns, crime, <br/>
science fiction and more. Other sites to try are Alex Catalog of <br/>
Electronic Texts (http://www.infomotions.com/alex) , the Electric <br/>
Book Company (http://www.elecbook.com) , and Planet PDF <br/>
(http://www.planetpdf.com/mainpage.asp?webpageid=2330).<br/>

LOOKING FOR A SCHOLARSHIP?<br/>
http://www.fastweb.com<br/>
<br/>
FastWeb is a free scholarship search service that helps students <br/>
choose a college, pay for college and/or find jobs during and after <br/>
college. Matches are made from a database of more than 800,000 <br/>
scholarships totaling over $1 billion in possible scholarships. Also <br/>
a placement service, by using the student&#39;s profile FastWeb can match <br/>
students with a 2- or 4-year college, and you can even sign up to be <br/>
recruited by that college. You do have to create a profile that <br/>
includes your email address so you can be contacted about the results <br/>
of your search. As always, read the privacy statement carefully; <br/>
however, I didn&#39;t find anything insidious in it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
THE HAPPY CHILD<br/>
<br/>
On a practical level, is a person who is taught not to think, but to <br/>
jam information in and push information out, valued in our <br/>
contemporary society? The children we are teaching today will be in <br/>
their adulthood in a decade or two. In that world, the world of <br/>
twenty years from now, will a child who has been filled with <br/>
informationnot even contemporary information, but information from a <br/>
decade or two agobe skilled, functional, prized? Will a child who <br/>
has learned to hold and regurgitate information be esteemed? It is <br/>
obvious that the computers will be doing it better, that the <br/>
computers are already pushing information in and out better than most <br/>
of us. It is not information that will be useful, but the ability to <br/>
understand how to utilize it.<br/>
<br/>
Looking down the road to our children&#39;s future, what will be far more <br/>
important than yesterday&#39;s factoids is the relationship our children <br/>
will have to the then-existing systems of information. A child who is <br/>
given the chance to explore and investigate the sources of <br/>
information, the meaning of information, the utility of information, <br/>
and the skills of manipulating and crafting information will be able <br/>
to move fluidly in this future.<br/>
<br/>
The Happy Child: Changing the Heart of Education is not a <br/>
homeschooling book. Author Steven Harrison is more concerned with <br/>
saving all children (and adults) from lives of dead, worthless <br/>
&quot;education.&quot;  He believes a child who learns in a holistic democratic <br/>
environment will be self-motivated to learn and develop his own <br/>
personal potential. He adequately lists the problems with modern <br/>
schooling and submits his own utopian model of how learning should <br/>
look in a modern learning environment.<br/>
<br/>
I like this book. I marked several pages to return to and mull over. <br/>
Harrison&#39;s model is radically different from our modern-day lives in <br/>
general, but much of what he says will ring true for individual <br/>
homeschooling families. I hope he writes another book where he can <br/>
spend more time on the solutions now that he has defined the problems <br/>
with our modern educational model so well. The Happy Child is <br/>
available from your local bookstore or online book dealer.<br/>
