<div id="ygrps-yiv-204527888">Autism is a spectrum disorder - meaning that the symptoms have a<br/>
wide range of severity.  The extent to which a person with autism<br/>
is able to function in typical surroundings can vary from being<br/>
entirely dependent on supports for all activities of daily living<br/>
to the weird computer geek down the street.<br/>

<br/>
Non verbal kids with autism definitely need early intervention,<br/>
because autism frequently leads to explosive behavior if the kids<br/>
can&#39;t communicate.  Other than the non-verbal kids or the ones<br/>
with such deficits that they need tube feeding, diapers, and the<br/>
like, separating them from the mainstream of life has never been<br/>
demonstrated to benefit the kid (although it does keep folks from<br/>
seeing weird kids).<br/>
<br/>
Rather than addressing the issue globally (&quot;I think your kids has<br/>
a disability&quot;) how about more specific bits and see how it goes:<br/>
&quot;I was uncomfortable that Jane wandered away from where we were<br/>
and went into another part of the house; you might want to expose<br/>
her to more social setting so she can pick up those cues<br/>
asily.&quot;  -or- &quot;It seemed like Jane had a hard time settling down<br/>
to play &#39;with&#39; Mary and Sue, why don&#39;t we go to the park and see<br/>
if they interact more easily when there are fewer distractions of<br/>
an unfamiliar place.&quot;  Lots of folks seem to have great social<br/>
skills hard wired into them, but tips and techniques can help the<br/>
rest of us, LOL.<br/>

| &gt;&gt;The autistic child wouldn&#39;t have been in the normal range for<br/>
his age in<br/>
| the &quot;your seven year old&quot; books, but because my kids were aware<br/>
that there<br/>
| are some things younger kids are still not good at and they<br/>
were able to<br/>
| treat him as being at an earlier developmental stage, it worked<br/>
out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
|<br/>
|<br/>
|<br/>
| Now that this has been brought up, I have another question.<br/>
What a<br/>
| shocker!!!<br/>
| My kids also have no problem with children that are different<br/>
in so far any<br/>
| kind of way they have encounterd. Autistic, special needs or<br/>
CP. I had a<br/>
| fellow homeschooler come over to our house for a day of play<br/>
and swimming.<br/>
| She has a 6year old daughter that my daughter was thrilled to<br/>
meet. Most her<br/>
| age are boys in our group. I hadn&#39;t remembered this child but<br/>
for once at a<br/>
| park when she was 4. At that time I did notice she was happier<br/>
to be alone<br/>
| but when the mother said she was immature for age, I never<br/>
thought twice<br/>
| about it. She just seemed like she wasn&#39;t into playing with<br/>
other kids at<br/>
| that time.<br/>
|<br/>
| Well as soon as the mother and daughter walked into my house, I<br/>
knew there<br/>
| was something different. At the end of our play day, the mother<br/>
and daughter<br/>
| had fun, I was uncomfortable and my kids really didn&#39;t seem<br/>
different aside<br/>
| from the fact that they had no one to play with when they<br/>
thought they were<br/>
| going to. The child to me, as far as the info I have which<br/>
isn&#39;t much, seems<br/>
| slightly autistic. She doesn&#39;t interact at all with anyone. She<br/>
talks but<br/>
| not to anyone, not the kids or me or even her mom. She never<br/>
makes eye<br/>
| contact and just goes very quickly from one thing to another<br/>
like no one<br/>
| else is around. It was a bit uncomfortable for me because her<br/>
mother doesn&#39;t<br/>
| really watch her as if there is a problem. (my mother has a<br/>
connecting MIL<br/>
| quarters to our house and this little girl just walked right in<br/>
never saying<br/>
| a word and went into my mother&#39;s bedroom for awhile and then<br/>
just left) I<br/>
| found this out later. I&#39;ve never had any child, whether<br/>
schoooled or not go<br/>
| through my house like that. So I had to watch her and make<br/>
comments when she<br/>
| did what we don&#39;t do here in the house. Like push people and<br/>
grab things<br/>
| from others and so on.<br/>
|<br/>
| My kids tried to play with her but it just wasn&#39;t possible.<br/>
They had nothing<br/>
| to say other than she seemed to not like them. The mother gives<br/>
no<br/>
| indication at all that she sees a problem. She just says being<br/>
an only<br/>
| child, that the girl is immature. Now the only autistic<br/>
children I know go<br/>
| to special classes daily. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the best thing<br/>
or not but I<br/>
| can&#39;t help but wonder that maybe this child could benefit from<br/>
some other<br/>
| type of help the mother isn&#39;t giving. The mother unschools in<br/>
as far as I<br/>
| know of, only not having work to do. I know nothing else of how<br/>
she is with<br/>
| the child.<br/>
|<br/>
| Do I say something to this mother? She frequently calls me for<br/>
advice and<br/>
| marvles at how I do it with 4 kids and thanks me greatly for<br/>
suggestions I<br/>
| have made that help her. Now I see things differently and<br/>
realize why she<br/>
| seems to need help with things. Not usre if it&#39;s for me to say<br/>
something or<br/>
| what I would exactly say.<br/>
