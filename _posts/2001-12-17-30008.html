<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489232401">I&#39;ve stayed out of this thread....it was titled &#39;speaking of dogs&#39;  and I<br/>
had nothing to say or (I thought) to read.  In recent scrolling...I see the<br/>
thread has splintered into animal rights,  shelters....I know not what else!<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if you&#39;ve covered this already,  but you you tell me if feral<br/>
cats pose some risks to my children?  Last spring,  a cat was camping out in<br/>
my back yard.  Didn&#39;t notice it much with a new baby and all....until it<br/>
began making yowie in the night (i.e., copulating).<br/>
My neighbor....a fanatic about animals......agreed to trap the cat.  She<br/>
took her to the local shelter (She also,  took the 2 kittens we found<br/>
crawling around,  they were adopted to homes.)<br/>
,   paid for neutering and shots...and brought her back!<br/>
<br/>
She,  my nieghbor who rants about NEVER allowing outdoor cats,  released<br/>
this cat back to our neighborhood.  She provides food and water,  and knew<br/>
the cat took shelter under our deck In an innacccessible area.)  She even<br/>
had the nerve to ask if I&#39;d disasseble our deck and put a bed of straw for<br/>
the cat&#39;s warmth this winter!<br/>
<br/>
Well,  a different neighbor has placed a &quot;have-a heart&quot; trap (in prominent<br/>
view, mind you %)  ).<br/>
This neighbor says this cat poses risks to my children.  She is not<br/>
trustworthy in other areas,  in addition to wanting people to take sides and<br/>
openly feud!<br/>
<br/>
IF this cat poses risks to my children,  I would like to discreetly trap it<br/>
and get it to the shelter.  But I need accurate info....anyone?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591776167">I personally believe the cat poses no more threat than the other <br/>
wildlife.  You have squirrels and such right??  If your kids leave <br/>
her alone, the cat will leave them alone.  If she has been spayed, <br/>
there will be no more kittens.  <br/>
<br/>
The only other risk is rabies.  But that is a risk with other <br/>
critters too.  And perhaps your neighbor got her the vacs while <br/>
getting her fixed.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I would not let this start a feud.  Oh yes, and tell the <br/>
neighbor that the cat does not need any straw.  Cats are pretty self-<br/>
sufficient, she&#39;ll make a home without it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895344747">There are several areas that could be of concern.  Was the cat vaccinated<br/>
for rabies?  If you are in an area where she will be exposed to rodents,<br/>
then that would be a concern.  Another concern would be fleas.  Obviously<br/>
you can&#39;t deflea her or do anyother routine &quot;maintenance.&quot;  Fleas can carry<br/>
lots of bugs and they love to breed in places such as where this cat has<br/>
choosen to live.  The third concern, particularly with children is that your<br/>
yard has presumably become her bathroom.  I can never remember what the heck<br/>
the name of that &quot;thing&quot; that cats carry is but it is the reason small<br/>
children and pregnant women shouldn&#39;t be changing litter boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Also, of concern would be whether or not you have other pets that would be<br/>
negatively impacted by her presense--fleas, distemper, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286417696">If you have a sandbox, keep it covered.  Other than that, I can&#39;t see <br/>
where the cat poses any health risks.  Oh, and you don&#39;t need to put <br/>
out straw for the cat in the winter.  The cat will be just fine on <br/>
his own. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749516602">A lot depends on the area too though.  We live in a semi rural area.  <br/>
There are feral cats here.  We also have housecats and a dog now <br/>
too.  I try to keep the rabies vacs up to date but for the most part, <br/>
they have learned to live with each other.  Flea stuff on my own cats <br/>
seems to keep the fleas down on all of them.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of this has to do with attitude too.  Do you think of that cat <br/>
under your deck as a pet or as a you would a squirrel?  Would you <br/>
trap it if it was a squirrel?  If you think of her as a pet, you may <br/>
need to make her a real pet, if you think of her as a critter, then <br/>
make sure your kids know that and treat her that way too.<br/>
<br/>
The disease you are thinking of is Toxoplasmosis. It is not as big a <br/>
deal as they used to make it out to be.  Go check it out here if you <br/>
are concerned:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736568769">Another thought I had is that you don&#39;t have to tolerate an animal <br/>
coming into your yard if you don&#39;t want it there.  Personally, it <br/>

it bothers you, trap it. <br/>
