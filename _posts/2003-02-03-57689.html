&gt; it is sad and it is hard,  I know how you are feeling.  Lots of transition <br/>
&gt; around our circle of friends too.   I just keep hoping that as these <br/>
&gt; friends go, new ones will come that will be more accepting and similar in <br/>
&gt; their parenting styles.<br/>

share my beliefs about God and some don&#39;t, we respect our differences.  It <br/>
took some time but they are the best and worth the wait.<br/>
