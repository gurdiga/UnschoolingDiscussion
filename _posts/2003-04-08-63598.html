<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;It is easier said than done to shut my mother up. She has been the source<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of many issues and therapists for both me and another sister of mine. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did was to make each of my parents a card (on Mother&#39;s Day and<br/>
Father&#39;s Day) that just told them all the things I appreciated about the way<br/>
they raised me. All the things I was grateful for. Of course, there&#39;s things<br/>
I don&#39;t agree with in their raising of me, but that&#39;s not the point. They<br/>
both really loved me and did what they thought was best. My mom breastfed me<br/>
in the 60&#39;s, my dad took me to the park to fly kites. That kind of thing. It<br/>
was really fun for me to remember all of that. I also think it helped my<br/>
parents to see that just because I choose to parent differently isn&#39;t a<br/>
condemnation of them.<br/>
<br/>
Then, later, when my mom started interfering with my parenting, I turned to<br/>
her one day and said &quot;You had your chance as a parent, and the result is me.<br/>
Only you can judge if that was successful or not &lt;grin&gt;. Now it&#39;s my turn to<br/>
parent, and I&#39;m going to do some things differently. You can support me, you<br/>
can disagree with me (in your head, but not verbally in front of my kids),<br/>
or you can stay away from the grandkids.&quot; Those were, quite seriously, the<br/>
options. I&#39;m not going to spend my life unschooling only to have my parents<br/>
try to shame my kids for not knowing their ABCs by age 3 or how to read by<br/>
6. Fortunately, it never came to that. That conversation was early on in the<br/>
process and it completely headed things off. I think my parents both know I<br/>
value them, but that DH and I have to decide what&#39;s right for our family.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The things is that...I don&#39;t know... it seems as if I am failing. I have<br/>
heard that it is not important for a child to read, or forced to read at 5,<br/>
I have a friend was a former public school teacher who homeschools her<br/>
children, tell me the same thing. Just go by when they are ready. But when<br/>
you have a mother who insists on this MUST be done by such and such an<br/>
age.....can you sense some issues here with me, lol.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really hard. I&#39;ve seen mothers struggle with these kinds of issues on<br/>
many fronts - childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. I have been at births (as a<br/>
doula) where the laboring mom&#39;s mother was telling her she wouldn&#39;t be able<br/>
to have the baby without drugs. Fear is such a huge thing, and I think it<br/>
helps to acknowledge that the fear of the (older) parent is largely coming<br/>
from love. That doesn&#39;t make it productive though. Sometimes it&#39;s best to<br/>
just get away from it. In the case of birth, I&#39;ve seen midwives ask the<br/>
mother to leave the room because her fear was interfering with the birth.<br/>
You can see it in real-time in birth, but in something like unschooling it&#39;s<br/>
so much more prolonged and harder to see. But that fear can still interfere.<br/>
I&#39;d say do what you can do to either get your mom to shut up, or get away<br/>
from her fear. It might be coming from a place of love, but it can be<br/>
poisonous.<br/>

once kids are out and verbal, just one trip for ice cream can give her the <br/>
opportunity to compromise what the mom has instilled as confidence and hope.  <br/>
 Just one laugh at an opportune moment (my own mother-in-law&#39;s specialty) can <br/>
cause a child to doubt his parents really know what they&#39;re doing.  Luckily <br/>
for us, my mother-in-law has laughed too many hateful laughs and my kids came <br/>
to ignore her.<br/>
