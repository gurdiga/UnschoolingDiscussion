<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040336925">&quot;BUT, we are planning on trying to make the best of<br/>
 <br/>
it and come up with some fun ideas for clubs, outings,  whatever. .. Any ideas <br/>
for what has worked well in your local groups?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I started an inclusive group, where all religious philosophies (or not) and homeschool styles are welcome. We made it very clear that all activities would be run in an unschooling friendly manner, and so far it&#39;s been great.<br/>
Recent activities have included a tie dye party, visit to the butterfly house, an archeological dig and the beach, of course. We are hosting an unschooling workshop at the local health food store next week and &quot;Funfest&quot; in September which will be a smorgasboard of local vendors, speakers and workshops. One of the teens is starting a montly newsletter that will have poetry, stories, art, local events, classified ads and more. <br/>
Our website is pensacolaunschoolers.com if you want to learn more. We meet weekly and do other events as we think of them and as interest inpsires!<br/>
I&#39;ve been pleasantly surprised at how many people are coming out of the woodwork now that we are organized. There are usually folks just like yourself, that don&#39;t want a religious group but don&#39;t think there is anyone else in the area. Start something and I bet you&#39;ll find them!<br/>
