<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100651744">My DS and DH are big Halo fans...in fact, DH took this week off from <br/>
work due to Halo 3 coming out, and he and DS plan on a big-time gaming <br/>
week!<br/>
<br/>
They have been wondering about any other unschooling families out there <br/>
who might play Halo 2 online on XBox live, looking to connect with some <br/>
others to play.  Their gamertags are AIVJO and Strelka1960.  Any <br/>
gamertags of unschoolers that they might look for?<br/>

There&#39;s a yahoo list for unschooling gamers.  I think it&#39;s still  <br/>
active (not positive), and it&#39;s listed and linked here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397698435">Thanks, Deanna. My son Pat is a Halo 2 player, so I&#39;ve passed that on <br/>
to him and he says he&#39;ll check it out.<br/>
