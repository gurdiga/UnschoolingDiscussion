&lt;&lt; (I take that back...I know someone who killed<br/>
someone else in self-defense, but it was with a sword.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aha!  I&#39;m glad someone else mentioned swords.<br/>
Gross-warning on the following:<br/>
<br/>
We had a friend (Kirby&#39;s godfather) who collected Japanese swords and was a <br/>
black belt in some sort of sword martial arts thing, and taught.  His <br/>
fantasies of protecting his family had to do with swords, and they were hung <br/>
available for real use (looked decorative, but guys&#39; fantasies are often of a <br/>
practical nature).  <br/>
<br/>
A few years back he committed suicide.  Alcohol was the big factor; he <br/>
couldn&#39;t kick drinking, and his wife was tired of it.  But he used a gun, in <br/>
the shed.  Some of his friends were disappointed in a perverse kind of way <br/>
that he didn&#39;t do the traditional Japanese thing, since he was capable and <br/>
had the equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Because we&#39;re in a medeival studies group, most of my friends own real <br/>
swords.   My husband has two or three.  There&#39;s a claymore (someone else&#39;s) <br/>
downstairs at the moment.  My husband&#39;s buying a sword next week for someone <br/>
who&#39;s being knighted--a gift and a part of the ceremony.  There are swords <br/>
all around me, not usually sharpened, but still deadly.  Nobody&#39;s gotten hurt <br/>
by them except one friend (with his own sword) in Dixon, New Mexico (a town <br/>
famous for apples) who was slicing apples in the air with a Japanese sword <br/>
for fun and accidently cut his own foot badly).  <br/>
<br/>
If you cut apples in the air (I have learned), here are some safety rules:  <br/>
Keep both feet on the ground, and have someone else toss the apples.  From a <br/>
distance twice as far as the length of the sword and your lunge reach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569782595">We have swords here too. Each of the kids have one but they do not use them. <br/>
They hang downstairs on the stone wall I built around our woodburner. The <br/>
kids like the way they look as decoration and I do too. The kids have wooden <br/>
swords they use in martial arts. They do use them. They also have fencing <br/>
foils and hope to take classes someday in fencing. I do not worry about the <br/>
kids sneaking around taking the real swords down to play with them. They are <br/>
not little kids for one and they are not sneaky for another. I think if there <br/>
was a medievil group around the kids would enjoy that too. <br/>
<br/>
That is really to bad about your friend Sandra who commited suicide. Always <br/>
so sad. But I certainly understand why he did not pick the sword to die by. <br/>
Makes me cringe to think about all the pain that would involve. <br/>
<br/>
We have been watching a lot of shows and reading many books on ancient <br/>
history here. Very interesting. A subject I never had in school so it is all <br/>
new to me. Anyway the violence is unbelievable. As much as I hate the <br/>
violence nowdays we are certainly better than humans use to be. So maybe we <br/>
will keep getting better. :)<br/>
<br/>
Ido not think that the gun is the problem. I think we need to find out why <br/>
people kill. I know there is not one answer. We have to many people in this <br/>
country who need help before they reach for the gun, ( knife, needle, blunt <br/>
object, whatever) so that maybe they just don&#39;t. There is not an easy answer <br/>
but I think that is the only way we will ever remove the violence. <br/>

&gt; swords would be more satisfying in a duel, though ... and what about the <br/>
&gt; merits of homemade over fake?  You said your kids made swords and shields <br/>
&gt; -- how did they do that?  Debi<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> My kids made all kinds of weapons out of PVC pipe, blue insulation foam, <br/>
(comes in rolls and is about 1/4 inch thick) and duct tape. They use garbage <br/>
can lids for shields. <br/>
 They are older kids and they go out in the backyard and duel all the time. <br/>
My hub also duels with them and neighbors and house guests have been known to <br/>
engage too. <br/>
 One thing that raised questions in my mind was we went to a Renaissance <br/>
Faire last weekend and my kids had a blast shooting arrows at a live target. <br/>
They were rubber tipped arrows shot at a knight in armor, helm and chain <br/>
mail, but still. If the kids were over 12 and missed the shot, the knight <br/>
chased them down. If the archer could load another arrow and hit them the <br/>
archer one, if the knight got there first the archer was toast. My son got a <br/>
knight pretty close up!! He rolled on the ground and kicked his feet most <br/>
dramatically. (the knight not my son).  <br/>
 For the most part my kids are very pacifistic. <br/>
 Another thing, my son has been fencing for three years in November. He used <br/>
to be bullied but not blatantly but still seemed to be a target for <br/>
aggressive kids. Since he started fencing for real, it has made a real <br/>
difference in the way he is perceived by other kids. He has an athletic grace <br/>
and self confidence that has ended that perception. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096746090">My son (8 yrs old)has been asking to buy a sword for about a week <br/>
now. He found a site that sells them while looking up info on Ra the <br/>
Sun God (my 9 yr old niece says the only god she worships is Ra, so <br/>
they were looking up info on the computer)...Seamus has a wooden <br/>
sword, but he wants something that looks more &quot;real&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago, he wanted to buy knives, so he picked a <br/>
bunch out at the dollar store, played with them for a day or two(not <br/>
just chopping stuff up, but also doing ninja-esq moves with <br/>
them, &quot;slicing&quot; the air, etc)...it made me a little nervous, but he <br/>
is very good about NOT getting hurt doing stuff, and was being <br/>
careful not to swing them around with someone standing there. The <br/>
knives have been sitting on a shelf in our room for a few weeks now <br/>
(actually since about two days after he got them), untouched. We&#39;re <br/>
in the process of moving, so when i pack them up, i&#39;ll probably just <br/>
put them in the utensil drawer until he needs them.<br/>
<br/>
Now about the sword....i like swords, theyre cool, but i dont know <br/>
how comfortable i am having a big 2 ft long sharp sword lying <br/>
around. I&#39;m pretty confident my son wont get hurt, but we&#39;ve just <br/>
moved into a new place, and i hope the other kids in the complex <br/>
will hang out at our apt, and not sure how to handle that. <br/>
<br/>
Is there someplace i can get an authentic looking sword that ISNT <br/>
sharp at all? Seamus said he&#39;d be willing to get a more &quot;real&quot; <br/>
looking wooden one, if he &quot;had&quot; to, but i know thats not what he <br/>
really wants. <br/>
<br/>
My nephew (now 25 and off in Japan in the Navy)collected swords as a <br/>
teenager/adult, until recently they were in my mom&#39;s basement, and <br/>
my brother took them away to store at his house because he didnt <br/>
think they should be lying around where kids (seamus and my niece)<br/>
could find them, and made a comment about how my sister should never <br/>
have let him get all these swords when he was a kid, that it wasnt <br/>
really appropriate to buy him &quot;weapons&quot;...my brother is generally <br/>
great (off to see &quot;Robots&quot; the movie with seamus right now)but can <br/>
be pretty critical about things he has strong opinions on, and so i <br/>
think that is playing into my nervousness/hesitation about the <br/>
issue. <br/>
<br/>
I told Seamus i would do a little research and let him know by <br/>
Sunday what i&#39;ve decided (and thats today!!), i am not used to <br/>
saying &quot;No&quot; about much but not so confident saying yes in this <br/>
situation. I&#39;ve thought maybe we could get the sword, but i could <br/>
keep it in my room, like mounted on the wall or something, or even <br/>
displayed in the living room, instead of it just being out somewhere <br/>
in his room. <br/>

Yeah---Ben&#39;s Citadel sword. I kept meaning to have it mounted and framed, but never got around to it. <br/>
<br/>
Duncan found it, and it became his. Took it outside one day and broke it. Bummer. But it was NOT sharp. Ceremonial. I guess it *could* have been sharpened to a fine edge. But he way those boys twirl it around in parades, I guess it&#39;s best if it&#39;s not too sharp! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We also have the bayonet knife from his Citadel rifle; it&#39;s blunt too.<br/>
<br/>
Gun and knife shows? We have one here in Columbia about once a month. Maybe once every two months? I don&#39;t know, but it seems to be quite often. <br/>
<br/>
Would a ceremonial one do?<br/>

he can observe a class at least, and maybe attend a demonstration or <br/>

There is also a knife store in the mall...Chesapeake Knife Company or<br/>

<br/>
There are also fencing academies that sell supplies and such.  My 13yo<br/>

My first thought was that if he wants to be able to play with his sword a<br/>
real one, regardless of edge might be rather heavy, whereas a reproduction<br/>
or theatrical prop one made of fiberglass or plastics might look good but be<br/>
lighter.<br/>

years ago.<br/>
