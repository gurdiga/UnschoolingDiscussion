<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131124989">Oooh, this is interesting! I didn&#39;t know that Unitarians do not believe<br/>
in a Trinity. I am fascinated by different variations in religion. I<br/>
myself am Jewish and a Scientologist. I like to understand what people<br/>
believe or use as fundamentals in their outlooks on life. Would you tell<br/>
me what this means, and forgive me if what I guess is off base? Jesus is<br/>
a prophet or great teacher? Jesus is divine but not part of God as a<br/>
trinity? Jesus and the Holy Spirit are one group? OR ... ...? I don&#39;t<br/>
mean to offend anyone, and if more appropriate you could answer me off<br/>
list, because I really am interested. Thanks, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Historically* they did. I don&#39;t know that they do today. Unitarian<br/>
Universalists as a whole definitely don&#39;t because they aren&#39;t Christian. But<br/>
there *are* some Unitarian churches -- *just* Unitarian not Unitarian<br/>
Universalist -- that are independent of the Unitarian Universalist<br/>
Association. Some, I think, are Christian but, since the Unitarians were a<br/>
liberal church before 1961 when the UUA was formed, I suspect those that<br/>
remained independent don&#39;t make an issue of the details that other<br/>
denominations go into. They&#39;d even be fine with members not seeing Jesus as<br/>
divine.<br/>
<br/>
(It *is* confusing because UU&#39;s often call themselves Unitarians :-/)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Trinity isn&#39;t a group. It&#39;s one whole that&#39;s 3 separate things at the<br/>
same time. (It can make your head hurt when people try to explain it ;-) To<br/>
me it doesn&#39;t sound that hard to grasp. Hindus manage gods with hundreds of<br/>
simultaneous aspects. So I feel like I must be missing something! ;-) Or it<br/>
might just be Western thought that has problems grasping things that don&#39;t<br/>
fall into nice neat this or that categories and doesn&#39;t want to wrap around<br/>
the idea that things might be more than one thing.)<br/>
<br/>
It says in the Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to the Bible that the Westminster<br/>
Shorter Catechism explains it as &quot;There are three persons in the Godhead,<br/>
the Father, The Son, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one God, the<br/>
same in substance, equal in power and glory.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(There&#39;s also a Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to World Religions.)<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of definitions of who is a Christian at the Religious<br/>
Tolerance site I mentioned before. Some are definitions given by particular<br/>
denominations, some by scholars. So there&#39;s a wide range.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_defn.htm">http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_defn.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
(The Religious Tolerance site covers just about all religions so is a good<br/>
place to dip your toe in about other religions.)<br/>
<br/>
Apparently some people who *self-identify* as Christians view Jesus as not<br/>
divine but as a great moral teacher. The fundamentalist churches are pretty<br/>
explicit about what is and isn&#39;t truth and therefore what must be believed.<br/>
(*No* question about Jesus being God.) As you go across the spectrum of<br/>
denominations towards the liberal end, the list of what is truth diminishes<br/>
and what is left up to the individual grows.<br/>
<br/>
Being God and all -- to most Christians -- whether God was speaking through<br/>
Jesus and therefore a prophet, is rather unimportant ;-) But I&#39;m not sure<br/>
historically or during Jesus&#39;s time there was a progression. Was he seen<br/>
first as a prophet and then as the Messiah. Did Jesus speak of himself that<br/>
way, first as a prophet then as God? I&#39;m sure someone here knows! Well,<br/>
knows in a scholarly sense of what is believed since the New Testament was<br/>
written well after the events.<br/>
<br/>
But I believe the Muslims view Jesus as a prophet (along with Abraham and<br/>
Moses and others, including Mohammed.) (If you type Jesus and prophet into<br/>
Google, the websites on the first page are almost entirely Islamic.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard of Jesus being considered divine but not part<br/>
of God. That doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t anyone just that it isn&#39;t a popular<br/>
enough belief for me to have heard of it ;-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I explained it the best way I&#39;ve ever heard when I was in 4th grade.  I <br/>
figured it was easy for everyone to figure out.  I&#39;m still waiting. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it speaks to you in your mind, it&#39;s the holy spirit.  If it was the <br/>
physical body of the guy on earth, or even the guise of him, that&#39;s Jesus.  <br/>
If it&#39;s the eternal creator forever aspect, that&#39;s God-the-father.<br/>
<br/>
But when the word &quot;substance&quot; is used, then the easiest way to say it is it&#39;s <br/>
like water, ice and steam.  God is like water, all the water anywhere--the <br/>
very idea of water.  Jesus was when water was &quot;made flesh,&quot; so he can be the <br/>
solid form of water (ice).  And when water can go everywhere, wrap around you <br/>
without you even feeling it, that&#39;s all the forms of mist and steam.<br/>
<br/>
There. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Deb, I won&#39;t attempt to explain because I myself used to get all confused<br/>
by it all but one book that really cleared it up for me was the book<br/>
&quot;Conversations with God&quot; by Neale Walsch. It is a great read - also I really<br/>
enjoyed &quot;Seat of the Soul&quot; by Gary Zuklov??<br/>
