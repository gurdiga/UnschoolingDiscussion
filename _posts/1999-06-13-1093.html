<div id="ygrps-yiv-483188347">My apologies for being a bit heated there about &quot;who&quot; is sitting at the<br/>
electronic &quot;table&quot; here.  Thank you for the much needed reminder that<br/>
what&#39;s really important is the subject of unschooling.  We are here to<br/>
share and give a shoulder to lean on now and then.  The only thing<br/>
missing here is the &quot;virtual refreshments and coffee&quot; sign-up list!  LOL <br/>
