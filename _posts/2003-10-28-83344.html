I like that idea Sandra :) That is a great one because $$$ sad but <br/>
true I&#39;m sure missing $800 a month would hurt.  <br/>
<br/>
In the same respect I would need the extra money for those growong <br/>
boys for the food and not to mention clothes blah blah you know what <br/>
I would need - you have children.  However we pay the state and they <br/>
pay her I don&#39;t know what to do with that one ???????<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, are you suggesting that we make the changes with &quot;us&quot; and do <br/>
not change any paperwork with the government ?? This is such a <br/>
difficult thing to deal with.  I don&#39;t feel the custody/papers have <br/>
to be change because that is only paper.  The only time it is not <br/>
only paper is when the state is putting a lein on my husbands <br/>
business account or he goes to jail for non-payment.  I truthfully <br/>
know it would be hard to give her all the $$$ and have the boys full <br/>
time. He works very hard as it is now - it&#39;s a tough one for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ,<br/>
Sonya<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Thanks so much for the peacful parenting tape I love it !! It <br/>
came at the perfect time !! <br/>
<br/>
Also thanks for listening I know this is a unschooling list which <br/>
I&#39;m happy to say I love. You never know what life will bring next ???</div>

It&#39;s the only way you can do it.  She would have to remain the parent of <br/>
record.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t feel the custody/papers have <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not the only time.<br/>
<br/>
Decisions about schooling and medical treatment count too.<br/>
<br/>
BUT... if you want to allow her to keep some of the money, it can be an <br/>
informal arrangement between you, and if she DOES want to keep  money she will have <br/>
to cooperate and do it your way.<br/>
<br/>
If the money&#39;s not important, the most expedient thing would be for her to <br/>
relinquish parental rights.  It can be restored later, if you wanted (and she <br/>
wanted, and a judge saw a reason for it--it&#39;s pretty routine), but if she signs <br/>
off on the kids you have full decision making power.  It would cut her off <br/>
financially, though.<br/>
<br/>
I feel sorry for the boy who&#39;s wanted to be with his dad since he was little. <br/>
 This is about his last chance.   <br/>

Thank you ,<br/>
I need all the input I can get.<br/>
I also feel so sorry for Nick - my heart aches for him and I have <br/>
always had a bond with him.   <br/>
<br/>
I had called his ex-wife to just talk with her because I thought why <br/>
not ?? Well she wasn&#39;t home so I left a message that I called.  I <br/>
figured that because she wanted all four of us to get together I <br/>
have a right to call. Although I am the step mother I could still <br/>
offer my thoughts and concerns. Well my husband called right after <br/>
(for a different reason) so I told him that I called.  He got really <br/>
uptight and said she hates you and doesn&#39;t want to hear from you so <br/>
let me make the offer. <br/>
<br/>
Mmmmmmmmmmmmm ?????? Then he siad that she had asked to meet with <br/>
just him and talk and he said he couldn&#39;t and then she asked about <br/>
all of us. Mmmmmmmmmm ?? I&#39;m sorry theres obviously other dynamics <br/>
here.  So my husband said he will call her and make the offer.  He <br/>
said she is just blowing off steam and nothing will come of it. I&#39;m <br/>
sad about it all because I could see the boys benifiting and  being <br/>
with their dad but perhaps it was just another tactic or motive to <br/>
her maddness ????<br/>
<br/>
I do like the information you offered though.  I think she would <br/>
proably go for us doing it and she still getting the money.  I guess <br/>
that could be considered a bribe though - and I&#39;m not so sure if I <br/>
like that ?? Somehow and someway there always has to be the element <br/>
of control on her part. Well I&#39;ll just wait to see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In some states, Oklahoma is one, termination of parental rights does not necessarily end the financial responsibility of that parent.  However, child support, at least here, can be avoided by a judge deviating from the child support guidelines for a specific reason, i.e. financial hardship of non-custodial parent.  <br/>

<br/>
You bribe someone into letting you live in your house ever time you make a <br/>
payment.<br/>
You bribe someone to give you groceries at the store, if you&#39;re going to see <br/>
all money as bribery.<br/>
<br/>
If she wouldn&#39;t let you have the kids simply because of money (which seemed <br/>
to be a big factor in something said earlier) then if your priority is getting <br/>
the kids, you might consider letting her keep some money.<br/>
<br/>
If your feelings about &quot;bribery&quot; are stronger than the desire to have the <br/>
kids, then that&#39;s your priority.  Priorities always count.  If hers is money, you <br/>
could use that to gain some control.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Somehow and someway there always has to be the element <br/>
<br/>
of control on her part.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  And if she&#39;s illegally receiving government money, you have her in a <br/>
less controlling place.<br/>

I think it&#39;s a great idea and I would do it - I don&#39;t think she <br/>
would though. I will just wait and see what the initial reaction is <br/>
first.<br/>
I think besty had a great idea though &quot;give her a break&quot; and all <br/>
that other stuff she mentioned. <br/>
I don&#39;t think I will put to much more energy into it until I hear <br/>
some feedback to our offer to &quot;give her a break&quot;.<br/>
That is the way I put it last year - who knows ???<br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious, how does one get social security for being a parent of a <br/>
dependent child if the other parent isn&#39;t deceased or disabled, divorced or not? My <br/>
cousin gets somewhere close to $1800 a month for her and her three kids since <br/>
her ex passed away, but before he passed, she only got child support. <br/>

Then she doesn&#39;t!  The situations I&#39;ve been involved with both had a deceased <br/>
parent.<br/>
And money was mentioned so I jumped to prior examples.<br/>
