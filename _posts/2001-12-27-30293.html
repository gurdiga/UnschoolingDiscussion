<br/>
The last year that my son was in public school they put off his 504 <br/>
Accomodation Plan meeting until January. (it should have taken place no later <br/>
than October). At the meeting I asked the teacher why she had not made the <br/>
accomodations that were outlined in the plan ( I had asked her on an almost <br/>
daily basis up to this point), she replied that she didn&#39;t have a copy of the <br/>
plan. That&#39;s when the special ed director realized that this teacher was  a <br/>
complete idiot, as I had been telling her. (she could&#39;ve gotten a copy from <br/>
me or the special ed director, but never asked) Anything the teacher said <br/>
after that point in the meeting was looked upon with suspision and I caught <br/>
her in an out-and-out lie  and called her on it. (she responded by stating <br/>
that she &quot;didn&#39;t remember saying that&quot;). <br/>
Anyway, my point is, even tho the other administrative people were on my <br/>
side, they wouldn&#39;t take my son out of the class and I couldn&#39;t allow my son <br/>
to be poisoned for another minute--the next day was his last day of school.<br/>
I only wish I would have learned about  the many aspects of unschooling and <br/>
unparenting long ago.  (before immunizing, but that&#39;s another sad story)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m defending the teacher here, I&#39;m sure if <br/>
you felt she lied, then she probably did.  But, my question is, HOW COME <br/>
THE SPECIAL ED ADMINISTRATORS DIDN&#39;T MAKE SURE SHE WAS GIVEN A COPY OF <br/>
THE MODIFICATIONS TO KEEP IN HER FILES IN HER CLASSROOM?  I feel that <br/>
should be part of that administrators job - to make sure all the <br/>
teachers have their mods in their classrooms.  If, after a couple of <br/>
weeks, they see not all mods have been picked up, then they should <br/>
realize that the teacher is probably totally overloaded and hasn&#39;t found <br/>
the time to make the trip to the special ed office.  I think the <br/>
administrators should take some of that responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
  I remember, at the beginning of every semester the Special Ed <br/>
Department at my high school had a &quot;Modifications Party&quot; (Believe me, it <br/>
was no party!!)  This would take place after school, in the library.  <br/>
All the teachers would come and crowd around these big fat folders of <br/>
modifications for their students and initial a document proving that <br/>
they picked them up.  These modifications for these hundreds of students <br/>
were supposed to be in alphabetical order, but, of course, they <br/>
weren&#39;t.  So, it took a very long time to go through all of these <br/>
folders and wait in line for the teachers in front of me to go through <br/>
them.  It was always a very disorganized process.<br/>
<br/>
  Never did I come out of one of these &quot;parties&quot; with more than 50% of <br/>
the modifications I needed because not all of them were ever there.  I <br/>
would then have to make that 10-minute trek to the Special Ed Office and <br/>
spend at least 30 minutes there sifting through those big, folders they <br/>
kept the modifications in.  It usually took about a month and at least 4 <br/>
or 5 more trips to that office before I finally had all the <br/>
modifications for all of my special-ed students.  This took up my very <br/>
valuable time and I always resented doing this.  I could have used this <br/>
time to prepare my lessons, grade papers, meet with students, etc.  When <br/>
I was a teacher, every minute was precious and important to me.  I got <br/>
lots of work done before and after school and during my conference <br/>
period.  I didn&#39;t feel it was right that it be eaten up by continuous <br/>
trips to the Special Ed office, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ADMINISTRATORS THERE <br/>
HAVE SEVERAL SECRETARIES AND STUDENT HELPERS WHO COULD EASILY <br/>
HAND-DELIVER THESE VERY IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS TO THE VERY BUSY <br/>
TEACHERS.<br/>
<br/>
I complained several times about my school&#39;s policy of distributing the <br/>
modifications, but I was never able to change anything.<br/>
<br/>
The administrators should remember that the teachers are very busy <br/>
serving their many students.  They should be the ones who put those mods <br/>
in the teacher&#39;s box or deliver them to the classroom.  The teachers are <br/>
under much more stress and are much busier than those administrators.<br/>
<br/>
Also, was this a new teacher?  Was she new to the school?  Did she know <br/>
how the system worked?  I remember my first year at my last high <br/>
school.  I was totally on my own.  I didn&#39;t know who anyone was, where <br/>
anything was, or what the policies and systems were.  All the other <br/>
teachers are so incredibly busy, they don&#39;t have time to teach and/or <br/>
direct you.  I didn&#39;t have a mentor teacher to help me because I was not <br/>
a first-year teacher.  It took me almost an entire school-year before I <br/>
felt comfortable with how things worked there.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, in your son&#39;s case, the administrators should have taken some of <br/>
the blame for not having the accommodations or modifications put into <br/>
the hands of the teacher.  There is the possibility the teacher was <br/>
totally overwhelmed and the administrators should have realized that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560250075">Based on what you have both said, it appears that you are in total agreement! The public school system can&#39;t or won&#39;t take the time necessary to see that ALL students are given what they need academically. Unfortunately, it is the student who suffers, and the attitudes that are shown by the teachers can many times come out in very negative ways towards the students who are only there to get an education. <br/>
At least some of those teachers do leave the system rather than continue to subject the students to that negativity.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was one of those teachers to leave the<br/>
system.  I couldn&#39;t see how I could ever<br/>
change the system, and what little good I was<br/>
able to do was negated by all of the<br/>
negative.  I know I helped some students, I<br/>
taught a 3rd grader how to read, others had<br/>
told him he&#39;d never learn.<br/>
<br/>
but now, with what I know (and I have learned<br/>
so much since my schooling and teaching<br/>
days), I wonder if *I* really taught Albert<br/>
to read.  Maybe he was simply ready and I was<br/>
the person, the adult, there who coudl help<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
I remember how my father told a story about<br/>
asking teachers what they taught and the<br/>
teachers woudl say &quot;history&quot;, &quot;Math&quot;,<br/>
&quot;English&quot; and my dad would stop them (as a<br/>
school counselor) and say &quot;NO, you teach<br/>
students!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I used to think that was very progressive<br/>
thinking, and I guess it was, for my dad and<br/>
for most of those teachers.  but now I<br/>
question it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be my children&#39;s teacher.  I<br/>
want to be there as they learn.<br/>
