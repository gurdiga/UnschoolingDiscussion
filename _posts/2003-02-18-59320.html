<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I love that quote.  Which old song did it come from?  Can I quote it in<br/>
&gt; our local newsletter?<br/>

<br/>
Glad you like the quote.  Everybody I knew in the world knew that song in<br/>
the 70&#39;s when I went to girl scout camp.  I haven&#39;t heard it in years, so I<br/>
guess everybody doesn&#39;t know it anymore, huh?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want to print it in a newspaper, you&#39;d probably to be sure of author<br/>
and copyright stuff.  I only have a tattered photocopy, pasted in a book of<br/>
songs I made back in those days.  I&#39;ve been all over google looking for it,<br/>
but haven&#39;t tracked it down yet.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s the whole thing:<br/>
<br/>
Labels are good for canned goods,<br/>
so you don&#39;t mistake the spinach for the beans<br/>
but the people that your meetin&#39;<br/>
aren&#39;t the same as food you&#39;re eatin&#39;<br/>
don&#39;t put labels on my friends.<br/>
<br/>
Shopping at your favorite department store<br/>
it&#39;s nice to see the sizes printed on the tags<br/>
you can perceive at just a scan<br/>
but look closer at a man<br/>
don&#39;t put labels on my friends.<br/>
<br/>
Liberal and conservatives<br/>
hard hats and those wierdo hippy freaks<br/>
don&#39;t put everyone in classes<br/>
find each person in the masses<br/>
don&#39;t put labels on my friends<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tierd of hearin&#39; all the time<br/>
wire rims and jeans I surely am on drugs<br/>
or they hear that I&#39;m a girl scout<br/>
cookie pusher no doubt<br/>
don&#39;t put labels on my friends.<br/>
