<div id="ygrps-yiv-338932751">I&#39;ve gone nowhere, but I feel like I&#39;ve been on a long trip and have just  <br/>
returned! It&#39;s been an odd month or so!<br/>
 <br/>
We began this adventure with almost a mini-L&L conference of unschooled  <br/>
teens. We had a bunch of them from as far as Jacksonville, FL and Chicago, IL  <br/>
come to frozen Massachusetts. It was wonderful having those loud, eneretic,  <br/>
joyful, silly bodies all over the place. It was a blast watching Brenna, who  said <br/>
she hadn&#39;t seen snow since she was 6, experience first a cold spell of  <br/>
weather of 4 degrees, then THIRTY-EIGHT inches of snow, which delayed her  <br/>
departure for a couple of days. Dagny also joined them, along with Bryanna.  Julian <br/>
was thrilled.<br/>
 <br/>
At the time I was also experiencing some pain, which I discovered was  my <br/>
gall bladder. Soon after the kids left I went in for surgery, but first there  <br/>
was another adventure. Remember that snow storm I mentioned? Well, as Beth was  <br/>
digging out and warming up the car to take me to the hospital, a huge, 9&quot;  <br/>
diameter icicle fell onto the roof of the car, crushing the roof and smashing  <br/>
the windshield. They dug out the other car, and we waited to deal with cars  <br/>
later.<br/>
 <br/>
In the meantime, my gall bladder surgery ended up being a tad complicated,  <br/>
so my recovery time felt long. I was especially bummed because we had to cancel <br/>
 our vacation, costing us about a thousand bucks. AND we had to replace the <br/>
car,  unplanned.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, well... On the other hand, I find myself in the last legs of  <br/>
unschooling, and it&#39;s really very cool. Beth and I were talking last night about  Julian, <br/>
and we agreed that, after pulling him out of school after the third  grade <br/>
and plunging into unschooling, neither of us would have dreamed how  amazing he <br/>
would turn out: Kind, knowledgeable, fun and funny, scary smart,  mature, <br/>
competent.... <br/>
 <br/>
I could go on, but if you have younger kids and wonder how this could  <br/>
possibly work, I promise you....it&#39;s SO worth it. There aren&#39;t any real  effective <br/>
books about parenting for people who choose this way to live with  their <br/>
families, and that IS hard sometimes. But you have real live examples. And  from the <br/>
wonderful teens who spent time with us in January, it&#39;s NOT that I  <br/>
personally lucked into a great kid (although I really did) ....  They&#39;re  around, and <br/>
they&#39;re going to change the world.<br/>

Cameron Lovejoy, 17, was here for a week earlier in February.  He met  other <br/>
teens, some of them also unschooled or homeschooled, some schooled kids  (and <br/>
college students and one college graduate, but he probably didn&#39;t know that  <br/>
because none of that is discussed much) who hang out with Kirby and Marty.   He <br/>
met their cousins Gina, Elijah and Joshua who are the kids in the &quot;Public  <br/>
School on your Own Terms&quot; article.  Cameron impressed that whole  longterm group <br/>
very favorably, and he seemed to have fun in the many situations  we drug him <br/>
into and through during the week.  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly was on IM to some of the kids at Kathryn&#39;s house during their similar  <br/>
marathon teen time.  <br/>

I meant to say that I&#39;m sorry for your medical and vehicular emergencies  <br/>
(along with the pain, frustration and expenses), Kathryn, but thank you for  <br/>
writing something so wonderful.<br/>

**They are an amazing group of people. Dagny had such a great time.  In the<br/>
car on the ride home she talked and talked and talked.  She told me one<br/>
night they were all laying around in the dark playing guitar and singing<br/>
Beatles&#39; songs, and it just sounded like one of those times that you<br/>
remember forever. She was happily amazed to have been a visitor in two homes<br/>
where she *felt* at home.  I love that the kids are traveling to hang out<br/>
with each other. We&#39;d love to have some unschooling visitors any time :0).<br/>
<br/>
Her life is so different than mine was at her age.  I wouldn&#39;t ever have<br/>
considered asking my parents if I could go to a sleepover at a boy&#39;s house<br/>
with a bunch of older kids - I would have tried to find a way to do it<br/>
without them knowing instead.  She is so much more grounded and mature and<br/>
secure in herself at 12 than I was at 20.<br/>
<br/>
While she was there she watched Spinal Tap and really liked it.  I had never<br/>
seen it and she thought I&#39;d enjoy it, so she put it on our Netflix queue,<br/>
and we all watched it together today.  We laughed a lot and had some cool<br/>
conversations about how rock developed and how adults reacted to the<br/>
sexuality of it. We talked about Elvis and Jim Morrison, and Jon brought up<br/>
the Ed Sullivan Show.  There&#39;s a lot to talk about in that movie - long<br/>
hair/fashion, spontaneous combustion, documentaries, Yoko Ono, aging<br/>
rockers, funny English words (wonker), chapeaus and haberdashers, amps that<br/>
go to 11 &lt;G&gt;.  When I lived with my parents I wasn&#39;t allowed to see PG<br/>
movies, so I would never have told my mom I watched an R rated one, let<br/>
alone recommended it to her.  I feel so lucky that Rowan and Dagny and Jon<br/>
and I really *know* each other.<br/>
<br/>
Dagny asked me today if Spinal Tap was rated R just because they said f____.<br/>
It reminded me of something that happened when she was about 4.  She asked<br/>
me what the movie ratings meant.  After we talked about R she said, &quot;What<br/>
comes next?&quot; I said X, and that one big difference was they could show a<br/>
penis.  She said, &quot;Ya, well, there&#39;s nothing worse than a naked penis&quot; with<br/>
a totally straight face and then cracked up. Not a story I&#39;ve shared with my<br/>
mom &lt;G&gt;. ~Rue<br/>
