<div id="ygrps-yiv-556917350">My kids have been in PS for years. It seems like they are losing their <br/>
creativity and spontinaity(sp). I ask them what they would like to do or <br/>
study, and they don&#39;t seem to know, esp my oldest. He has no real interests <br/>
outside of looking at skateboard magazines and wearing dark, baggy clothes. He has <br/>
been failing for years. I brought him home in the middle of last year, but he <br/>
resisted the whole HS thing. He refused to HS this year. He failed his freshman <br/>
year, and will be taking a few summer classes. I think he feels disappointed <br/>
with himself but not sure what he wants to do. <br/>
       My question is........how can I help him get back his interest and <br/>
desire to learn....anything?  I realize he can follow his skateboarding but he <br/>
mostly just likes to look at the pics and hang them on his wall. If I could <br/>
convince him to HS I know he would have more freedom to learn without the pressure <br/>
of homework etc., but he doesn&#39;t want to. He loves the PS social life. He has <br/>
youth group but is having trouble feeling like he fits in. He is a christian <br/>
but dresses differently. I have never seen anyone or heard anyone act judginly <br/>
towards him but he feels like they are.( I have worried that he might be <br/>
depressed but he has not been on any meds for it.)<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t ask.<br/>
Just go with what they ARE doing.<br/>
<br/>
Arrange for things to happen around them, arrange for them to be around where <br/>
things are happening.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need to &quot;study&quot; anything.<br/>
They can&#39;t help but learn from every single thing they see or do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He has no real interests <br/>
outside of looking at skateboard magazines and wearing dark, baggy clothes. <br/>
He has <br/>
been failing for years. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Failing at wearing dark clothes?  Failing at looking at skateboarding <br/>
magazines?<br/>
<br/>
Forget school.  Forget that whole school life/thought/list of &quot;should.&quot;  Turn <br/>
away from the dark shadow of the school toward the light of the real world.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I brought him home in the middle of last year, but he <br/>
resisted the whole HS thing. He refused to HS this year.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You mean he went back to school?<br/>
If he&#39;s not going to school next year, why should he take summer school <br/>
classes?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think he feels disappointed <br/>
with himself but not sure what he wants to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;sure what he wants to do.&quot;<br/>
Does he want to go to school or not?  If so, help make that more pleasant.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; My question is........how can I help him get back his interest and <br/>
desire to learn....anything? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By not ragging on him about what he wants to learn or do.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I could <br/>
convince him to HS I know he would have more freedom to learn without the <br/>
pressure <br/>
of homework etc.,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can do that while he&#39;s still in school.  But if homeschooling is going to <br/>
mean he still has schoolish expectations on him but no social life, why <br/>
should he want to be home?<br/>
<br/>
Read some of these things and try to breathe deeply and smile and not see the <br/>
dark side of him so much.   Can you cook something fun he liked when he was <br/>
little, rent a funny movie and make some popcorn and sit with him and watch a <br/>
movie without saying ANYTHING about school or homeschooling or learning?<br/>
<br/>
Much of the work of changing happens within the moms.  THEY have to be <br/>
creative for homeschooling to work well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6516765">This is IN FACT what school does to us.  It saps us big time.  Creativity happens when we are free.  When chained to a desk, we loose touch with it.  I HIGHLY recommend the first chapter of Wishcraft, by Barbara Sher.  I was already unschooling the kids and realized I had been unschooling me too.<br/>
