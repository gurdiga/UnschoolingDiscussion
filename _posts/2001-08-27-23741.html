<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741975728">Where do you put the paper to dry?  I have a gorgeous kit that my mom<br/>
found at a yard sale.  It has the frame/screen and a bunch of REALLY nice<br/>
paper (lintners?) that you are supposed to tear up to make the new<br/>
paper...<br/>
<br/>
I have also been saving lint when it comes out a nice color.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t made the paper yet, because I don&#39;t know where I&#39;ll put it to<br/>
dry.  It&#39;s often breezy here.<br/>

painting, writing,  whatever.  <br/>
