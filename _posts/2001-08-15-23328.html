<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248760910">Well, we have a whole family of young ones, I guess you could call it.<br/>
However, I never spent any time &quot;training&quot; the kidlets, it was more of a<br/>
monkey see, monkey do (no pun intended &lt;g&gt;) sorta thing.  Of course, maybe<br/>
because they spent more time running around naked than they did in diapers<br/>
and everyone was a real early walker.  The oldest was 12 months (daughter)<br/>
and youngest was youngest son at a little over 7 months.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was easier, just MHO, because we never made a big deal out of it.<br/>
I had a cutesy little combo stepping stool and potty chair in the bathroom.<br/>
DD would come in and sit on &quot;her&quot; chair when I was in there.  The boys all<br/>
watched dad and thought &quot;making splashes&quot; was fun.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if perhaps because they ran around naked more than half the time<br/>
they weren&#39;t more &quot;aware&quot; of what was happening and &quot;knew&quot; their bodies<br/>
better?  Maybe, ya think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850394004">With my first son I used cloth diapers for the first year and then <br/>
switched to disposables.  As my son approached his third birthday he <br/>
too had no idea what we meant by going potty.  A wiser neighbor mom <br/>
suggested I switch back to cloth diapers.  She said she thought the <br/>
disposable drew away wetness so well that little ones didn&#39;t really <br/>
notice if they were wet.  With cloth diapers there was no doubt.  One <br/>
week in cloth diapers and my son demanded &#39;no more diapers&#39; and used <br/>
his potty (day and night time without &#39;accidents&#39;)  :) <br/>

reason people have such a hard time potty training is<br/>
because they start too late.  I put a toilet looking<br/>
potty chair in the bathroom by the time my children<br/>
were about 8 months old (except the last one who was<br/>
only 5 months when purchased - my girls were early<br/>
walkers but late talkers so 8 months was when they<br/>
could take me by the hand to bring them to the potty)<br/>
also brought them with me whenever I went - never<br/>
forced them to use it - but alway offered & all were<br/>
completely (no accidents and would use public rest<br/>
rooms if necessary) potty trained by 18 months. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378624336">When I lived in El Salvador kids just ran around in regular clothes because <br/>
the available cloth diapers were flimsy pretty much useless for a kid over <br/>
3 or 4 months (and disposables were just way too hot). Kids did wet and <br/>
poop themselves regularly, but mothers would just take it in stride and <br/>
change the kid completely and clean up everything around them. After on <br/>
month there with my then 2 year old son and 5 month old daughter, I wrote <br/>
to my mom and asked her to send me a big box of American style prefolded <br/>
diapers and velcro-closing diaper wraps!<br/>

I thought I was doing so much good for using cloth diapers... figured my son<br/>
would potty train early because suppsedly cloth diapered babies do... but my<br/>

he wets himself.<br/>
Oh well, maybe they&#39;ll &quot;train&quot; together :)  That would be great!<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;I do agree, though, that diapered kids don&#39;t seem to know when they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; going.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why I favor the &quot;nudie&quot; system of potty training.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We were going to do this this summer but.... we&#39;re moving and there is<br/>
stuff<br/>
&gt; everwhere and the first time I attempted Julian peed on stuff for my work<br/>
:)<br/>
&gt; So then I thought I&#39;d wait until we got in a better situation where<br/>
&gt; everything around would be safe to be peed on...<br/>
