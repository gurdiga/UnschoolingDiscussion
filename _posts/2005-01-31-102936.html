Of <br/>
course, I always speak with a respectful tone, but still, it&#39;s a bit <br/>
added extra... the use of that word.  It has to be done with real <br/>

Joylyn reminded me of a comedienne I saw years ago doing Standup on the <br/>
Comedy Channel. <br/>
&quot;Have you ever gone into the department stores and looked around the makeup <br/>
counter? One of those women with the perfect makeup and the little black coat <br/>
comes over and askes in the super sweet voice.... &quot;Can I help you Ma&#39;am? What <br/>
can I do for you Ma&#39;am? Would you like a makeover Ma&#39;am? Ma&#39;am, Ma&#39;am, Ma&#39;am, <br/>
Ma&#39;am, Ma&#39;am.&quot;<br/>
Do you know what Ma&#39;am means?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BITCH<br/>

So Ren (who is the sweetest most beautiful makeup lady in the universe) think <br/>
of that the next time you get a snooty customer!<br/>
