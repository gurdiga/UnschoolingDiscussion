 </span></blockquote>Treated TWO this week, actually :P  It usually comes with a slight shift in <br/>
the weather - a couple of cold days, the first tinge of fall in the air...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  And can you get a cold from<br/>
&gt;sleeping under a fan?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we see this also - in terms of Chinese Medicine (acupuncture, here) <br/>
the climatic elements are very very invasive of the body.  In the Pacific <br/>
NW here we treat cold and damp related illneses almost exclusively!<br/>
<br/>
As for discrimating between cold and allergies, the easiest way to tell is <br/>
simply length of time - does go on without getting worse/going deeper into <br/>
the body (lungs etc) and eventually fade away?  Or does it progress through <br/>
a bunch of symptoms over a week to 10 days and then you get better?<br/>
HTH, though I can&#39;t support your thesis :P<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705513552">Okay, this is OT but I need some help settling a debate between DH <br/>
and me. I have been diagnosed by my OB&#39;s nurse with allergies. My <br/>
1yos has the same symptoms so I assume that what he has is allergies <br/>
as well. I guess what I want to know is what are the symtomatic <br/>
differences between allergies and a cold? Can you get a cold just <br/>
from being cold? Is there REALLY such a thing as just a summer cold <br/>
(a cold that you get every summer)? And can you get a cold from <br/>
