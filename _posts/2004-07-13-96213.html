<div id="ygrps-yiv-199073695">Thanks for everyone&#39;s suggestions previously about my 4yo and spending<br/>
money, etc.  Thought I&#39;d share what we&#39;ve done.  Whenever we go to a craft<br/>
fair, store, etc., and I see something that my brain says, &quot;That would be<br/>
easy to make!&quot; I point it out to her as something she could make if she<br/>
wanted and sell at a craft fair or on my website, etc.  She&#39;s liked a few of<br/>
the ideas but hasn&#39;t wanted to do it.  Things like the pretty fluffy hair<br/>
ties (which she always wants to buy!) that are just ribbons knotted around<br/>
elastic with a few beads on the end.  She&#39;s also thought about trying to<br/>
sell birthday cards to her grandparents.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also started a notebook in which she can gluepictures of, draw, or<br/>
write the things she wants.  She&#39;s had a ton of fun looking through catalogs<br/>
and pasting pics into the notebook.  <br/>
<br/>
Now when she comes to me with a want, and I can&#39;t afford it, I can say, &quot;You<br/>
should add that to your notebook!&quot;  and if she replies, &quot;But I don&#39;t want to<br/>
wait so much to get it,&quot; I can suggest she earn some money.  So far she&#39;s<br/>
said, &quot;No thanks,&quot; but I don&#39;t feel guilty saying no anymore.  I think if<br/>
she really wants something she has enough means to get it, and that she&#39;s<br/>
just having fun &quot;wanting,&quot; the same way I have fun planning my dream home or<br/>
ogling embroidery machines with no real expectation of ever owning them.<br/>
:-)  <br/>
<br/>
Also reflected on the dance class issue some more, and don&#39;t feel so bad<br/>
about that either.  My kids love to dance.  So they can dance.  Why should I<br/>
feel any more compelled to send them to dance class than to public (or<br/>
private) school?  Morgaine is also starting to &quot;get&quot; saving for a home . she<br/>
has been acting out a lot lately, and when I ask her what&#39;s going on, she<br/>
says, &quot;I just want some privacy,&quot; or expresses a need for personal space.<br/>
She spends a lot of time now planning for how she&#39;ll decorate her room when<br/>
she gets it.  Fun . !<br/>

===============<br/>
<br/>
School isn&#39;t usually trying to get kids to do things together as a group, <br/>
except sports, theater and music.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kids love to sing, so they can sing.&quot;<br/>
Yeah, but not in four part harmony.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kids love to act, so they can act.&quot;<br/>
Some, yes, but not in a play with other people.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kids love to play instruments, so they can play.&quot;<br/>
One serious aspect of music is playing it with others.  <br/>
<br/>
Dance classes tend to organize choreography and group activities that a <br/>
person can&#39;t do all on her own <br/>
<br/>
So the parallel to learning other things (like geography, or reading, or <br/>
math) doesn&#39;t hold for dance, in several ways.    <br/>
