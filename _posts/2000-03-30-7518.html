<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141302696">Hi Trisha, A friend and neighbor of mine has two<br/>
foster children. We&#39;re in NJ and the boys are from NY.<br/>
My friend was told she could NOT hs the boys. It may<br/>
be different in each state I am not sure. Good luck in<br/>
your path!<br/>

&gt; know if I&#39;d be allowed to hs foster kids. I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; send my son to school and <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m afraid it would cause conflicts if we had other<br/>
&gt; children who had to go. <br/>
&gt; The foster children might resent my son for not<br/>
&gt; having to go, and even my <br/>
&gt; son might think he was missing something. Has anyone<br/>
&gt; had any experience with <br/>
&gt; this? Any ideas?<br/>

I know someone in my homeschool support group who adopted the foster children <br/>
she took in and is now h&#39;s&#39;ing them. I can ask her for you, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
if they were already adopted by the time they were  school age. My dh and I <br/>
would like to take in foster children too so please e-mail me privately or <br/>
regularly to let me know how the process is for you. Thanks!<br/>
