<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356199227">We had an awesome unschooling day yesterday....another wonderful <br/>
example of natural learning and I just wanted to share it for any <br/>
newbies or &quot;thinking about unschooling&quot; folk that might need a touch <br/>
of encouragement that this really DOES work.<br/>
But it&#39;s a lot about how we as the parent&#39;s have to change in order <br/>
for this to work.<br/>
Anyway, in short form:<br/>
My 8y.o. ds and 4y.o. dd found a skeletonized squirrel in the yard <br/>
which really excited them. They came barreling in the house <br/>
exclaiming &quot;this is really cool Mom you HAVE to come see this&quot;.<br/>
They weren&#39;t sure what it was but because some fur and skin were <br/>
still holding it together they soon figured it out.<br/>
I came out and helped them salvage some of the skeleton for <br/>
observation.<br/>
Now, I could have said &quot;oooh, that thing is disgusting. Get it off <br/>
the driveway&quot;<br/>
Or something to that effect.<br/>
But because I didn&#39;t here&#39;s what it led to.....<br/>
We picked out some bones and glued them to a piece of <br/>
cardboard...they made guesses at what bone it was.<br/>
Online they reconstructed an entire skeleton, the website led us to <br/>
owl pellets, then the Oakland zoo, green monkeys, Muntjacks (don&#39;t <br/>
even ask how long we spent on the various species of Muntjacks), <br/>
somehow in between all this we got hungry and made Potato Latkes <br/>
which we ate with chopsticks that the kids were fascinated with at <br/>
the grocery store.<br/>
Later, they read a book and watched a movie in which chopsticks were <br/>
used (no, this was not planned...just serendipity).<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you the things we learned or it would take up way too <br/>
much room here.<br/>
One thing just naturally led to another. One of my children popped in <br/>
occasionally to see what we were up to and absorbed only a few <br/>
tidbits while happily roller blading the rest of the time.<br/>
So the moral of the story is it&#39;s us, the parents that must change.<br/>
Unschooling works. It always works.<br/>
But only if we can be as excited and interested as our children.<br/>
Or at least offer an avenue for them. Not everyone would be able to <br/>
not get squeamish at a dead squirrel...but &quot;hey, here are some gloves <br/>
and a jar&quot; would at least not slam the door of opportunity in their <br/>
face.<br/>
I don&#39;t worry anymore that my children won&#39;t learn everything they <br/>
need to for this life.<br/>
I also see that joyful learning can only happen if we are open and <br/>
totally willing to see every moment, every interest, everything as <br/>
opportunity.<br/>
We never know what a tidbit of information, or an experience might <br/>
lead to...and not knowing can bring  a sense of mystery to this whole <br/>
Unschooling life. If we keep that sense of mystery, that feeling that <br/>
this COULD lead to big things, (but if it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s ok too)<br/>
we will so much better be able to serve our children well when <br/>
supporting and encouraging their unique interests and pursuits.<br/>
That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about for me.<br/>
Being an avenue instead of a closed door.<br/>

Ren, I really enjoyed reading your squirrely day. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My mom had grown up on a farm where they never bought meat, but ate what they <br/>
raised.<br/>
<br/>
Once at my request she dissected a mouse she had caught in a trap.  The other <br/>
kids looked too, but I was the most interested.   I was grateful she did <br/>
that.  She showed us main organs, and then threw it away.  Most moms wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have done it.  I was middlin&#39; age--ten? twelve?  I&#39;m remembering the angle <br/>
from which I was standing looking at the mouse, and guessing from height.<br/>

were left.  No fur or skin, but a cool head.  My children have talked <br/>
about looking for some bigger animal, maybe a goose or a <br/>

ready.  Truthfully I am not sure I am to excited about it though.  It <br/>
is kinda gross at the start, but then pretty exciting when you get to <br/>
the skeleton.  Especially when you see your children excited to be <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498283616">Speaking of road kill, unschooling led us down an path that sure wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have happened if we weren&#39;t an unschooling family!<br/>
<br/>
Eldest son read some books about tanning hides and how early civilizations<br/>
and First Nations didn&#39;t waste anything and would skin and tan the hides of<br/>
animals found dead.  he then read about a man that collected roadkill and<br/>
tanned the hides.<br/>
<br/>
YUCK!!!  But, unless it is trully dangerous, in our family, there is no<br/>
&quot;no.&quot;  We (mom, dad and kidlet) talked to our family doctor and our vet<br/>
about potential problems.  We went shopping and got him some masks which he<br/>
sprinkled with cologne, some surgical gloves, disinfectant and gave him a<br/>
corner of the shed farthest from the house.<br/>
<br/>
He knew more about anatomy and dissecting by the time he was ten than most<br/>
college students that come out of a biology class with a lab!  And he<br/>
learned all kinds of tanning methods.  And he did skeleton cards of each<br/>
species he found.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was kewl!<br/>

Sort of related but not really, I got a book a few months ago called<br/>
soemthing like &quot;What is that Splat on Your Windshield?&quot;, all about<br/>
looking at the various bug splats and identifying the bugs that made<br/>
them. I got it to show my dad, the entomology buff, but Cacie picked it<br/>
up and read it and surprised me one day by identifying our various<br/>
splats, and the anatomical parts thereof.<br/>
<br/>
Lately she&#39;s gotten very good at identifying reduviids, after being<br/>
bitten by them twice. I&#39;ve learned about Chagas Disease and am hoping the<br/>
reduviids that bit her were not infected by the parasite that causes<br/>
it...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383206652">--Wow! That was really cool of her. Not sure I could do that...but I <br/>
would be willing to buy a prepared specimen and the tools to do a <br/>
dissection!! <br/>
 So far when I show my kids the specimen catalogs they don&#39;t show <br/>
much interest. &quot;ooh, gross Mom&quot; is the typical answer. And then they <br/>
go bringing home squirrel cadavers...sheesh.<br/>

to enjoy the moment for what it is.<br/>
