 &quot;Much to my surprise I found out our adopted sons have  never seen <br/>
the first, second, or third Star Wars (techincally, IV, V, and VI,  <br/>
the ones <br/>
with Harrison Ford) and were VERY happy to know there&#39;s more to the  <br/>
story.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh out loud when I read this. We are a HUGE Star Wars <br/>
family (sometimes I forget that there are people who&#39;ve never seen <br/>
them). Although my dh liked the movies as a kid, *I&#39;m* the one who <br/>
has all of the original trading cards, t-shirts, lunch boxes, action <br/>
figures, buttons, ships, etc.  We watch the movies all of the time. <br/>
In fact, when my mom bought me the original trilogy on video 14 years <br/>
ago for Christmas (which started the annual tradition of watching <br/>
Star Wars on Christmas Day), I actually *wore out* the video tapes. <br/>
Now, of course, we have them all on DVD and are forever breaking out <br/>
into scenes (with each family member saying the lines, word for word, <br/>
of a particular character). Our friends and family all think we&#39;re <br/>
nuts ;)<br/>
<br/>
Which leads me to what we&#39;re doing right now.  After reading some of <br/>
the Star Wars: Episode 1 Encyclopedia, my 10 y/o son set the book up <br/>
by his (massive) collection of legos to use the pictures as a basis <br/>
for the podracers he wanted to build. After building them and racing <br/>
them accross the dining room floor, he&#39;s now playing his PS2 <br/>
podracing game. <br/>
