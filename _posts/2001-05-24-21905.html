If this occured at hospitals, then you/she should have been given a<br/>
Patient&#39;s Bill of Rights.  Each hospital has a QA (Quality Assurance)<br/>
Committee that usually meets monthly.  Be sure to send in a concise<br/>
complaint addressed to this committee and request a reply.  Name names and<br/>
what occured (date and time needs to be included).  Enough people do not<br/>
avail themselves of this because, I guess, they either don&#39;t know about it<br/>
or they don&#39;t think it will do any good.  It can and does.<br/>
<br/>
If it is at a clinic that receives any federal funding or accepts Medicare<br/>
or Medicaid (MediCal in CA), they are also required to have a Patient Bill<br/>
of Rights posted within the facility.  They must also have some mechanism in<br/>
place to address these sorts of issues.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of larger cities and counties have Elder Advocates.  Sometimes they<br/>
are part of the Social Services department or SS can refer you to them.<br/>
Sometimes they are part of the city/county&#39;s Human Rights Commission.<br/>
Sometimes they are part of the local Ombudsman program.<br/>
<br/>
There is no way she should be treated that way or that the perps should get<br/>
away with it!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

You can also contact the closest &quot; Osha&quot;  who can appoint you an Ombudsman , <br/>
that will go and be the advocate for you and your mom.<br/>
Everyone is right there is no way they should get away with treating your mom <br/>
that way. I worked as a CNA for 4 years and did my training in a nursing <br/>
home. I was a bit horrified at the attitude of some of those nurses. When you <br/>
point it out to them they get embarressed and sometimes you can get an honest <br/>
answer about how over worked they are and that sometimes they just get burnt <br/>
out. Absolutely no excuse but it does happen alot. I quit that job when I <br/>
realized that most of my patients would die. Duh!  I knew that as a fact , <br/>
but when it actually happens it gets very depressing when you know you cant <br/>
do anything to help them . And no matter how hard you try , you cant make <br/>
them comfortable. I never saw abuse , but there is definately a &quot;coolness&quot; <br/>
about their dealings with the patient. Also I notice that alot of places will <br/>
call the patient a &quot;client&quot; instead of patient ( I personally think this is <br/>
cold, ) for the reason that they are trained this way so as not to get too <br/>
attached to the patient. The reason they gave was that if you become involved <br/>
in a patients life and they pass on then you will become burnt out too <br/>
quickly. I could go on but we would be here all day. Hope this helps a little.<br/>
Good Luck and I hope your Mom is feeling better<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  This was the word the insurance coordinator used (she is a nurse <br/>
assigned to follow the case from before to after).  She was very nice and <br/>
upset that this had happened and is going to start some sort of internal <br/>
investigation.  But her parting words were something like &quot;Well, we have to <br/>
be grateful you still have your Mom.&quot;  None of us knew this was any sort of <br/>
risky situation at 8 in the morning.  By 10 we had found out.  Not the way to <br/>
do things.<br/>
<br/>
My Mom has an appointment with a specialist (pulmonologist -- I never heard <br/>
of it before) and we will see after that.  Right now, we are too scared of <br/>
all of them and their inability to see the big picture to do anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info.  I will save it and see what my Mom wants to follow up <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

Spoke to some friends today that I use to work with.  They said that the<br/>
best way to get quality care for your mom is to have a GP that specialises<br/>
in geriatric medicine who could coordinate her care.  They also said that<br/>
you should have an organization called The Area Agency on Aging and that<br/>
they provide resources such as Ombudsman, assistance in finding good medical<br/>
care, filing complaints, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Pulmonoligists used to be combined with internal medicine.  There is such a<br/>
great deal of COPD, emphazema, bronchitis, cystic fibrosis and other lung<br/>
related conditions that it has become a specialty unto itself.  They also<br/>
cover some types of allergies and some types of industrial problems such as<br/>
asbestosis, etc.<br/>
