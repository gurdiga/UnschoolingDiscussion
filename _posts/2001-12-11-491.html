it&#39;s tougher than I thought. I counted it up the other day: I have 21 years<br/>
of public education to overcome; no wonder it&#39;s taking awhile. Meanwhile I<br/>
trust my kids and I&#39;m learning far more from them than they ever learned<br/>

Mine call me &quot;mom&quot; now, too.  It was a natural progression from &quot;mommy&quot; to <br/>
&quot;mom&quot; as they got older.  <br/>
<br/>
LOL - your story reminds me of one in my family.  My brother (baby of the <br/>
family), at the age of about 10, asked my mom to stop kissing him.  She was a <br/>
little hurt by the request.  He said, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t mind if you kiss me - <br/>
could you just stop doing it at the bus stop?&quot; lol.   <br/>

My grandmother was always called Mummy by her daughters -- I think from her <br/>
days in South Africa.  I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s dysfunctional to call someone <br/>
by the name they prefer.  Perhaps Mommy and Daddy feels more affectionate to <br/>

Kidlets are 5 and 10 now, and I hope they can distinguish between different<br/>
family members by now. To me, it&#39;s still creepy that it&#39;s gone on this long.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what they call us, they&#39;ve progressed thru mommy and daddy to mom<br/>
and dad (ds) and mama and daddy (dd). There was a brief spell of first<br/>
names, which I was amused by and dh less so. My folks are Mother and Daddy<br/>
to me, probably because that&#39;s what my mom called her folks. And woe be to<br/>

I am Angela.  We unschool here in Maine.  My girls are Leigh (7) and Lilly<br/>
(5) and they have always been unschooled.  I have been around  a few<br/>
unschooling groups for a couple of years now so some of you may remember me.<br/>
:0)  Winter is here and I have a little more time to sit at the computer, so<br/>
here I am, checking out new unshooling groups....  We live in a small town<br/>
with a myraid of animals.  Currently we are have 2 angora goats, 14 laying<br/>
hens, rabbit, 2 guinea pigs, hamster, 2 cats, and some fish.  :0)  We enjoy<br/>
our animals tremendously though some days I wonder what I was thinking when<br/>
we aquired them all.  ;-)    I enjoy knitting and reading (this week), Leigh<br/>
enjoys playing games, Lilly enjoys pretending.  I just updated my geocities<br/>
unschooling  webpage if you want to learn a little more about us.    Hi<br/>

don&#39;t think it started out of disrespect, but more of a a growing-up, <br/>
becoming another adult (or so he thought at 16!) thing. I don&#39;t remember if <br/>
they minded it then, but now it&#39;s just a part of how they relate to one <br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
My Conor started calling us by our first names when he was 3. That was <br/>
probably because it&#39;s the names he heard everyone else call us. His dad <br/>
thought it was great. But I asked Conor if he would please call me <br/>
mom/mommy, since he was (at the time) the only one in the world who could <br/>
give me that title. He liked that idea. He eventually drifted back to <br/>
calling his dad &quot;dad&quot; on his own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309860092">I tried to get my kids to use my name, mostly because I love the sound of it in their voices, but none of them would do it regularly. They felt like I was taking away a special privilage so I gave up on it. I&#39;m not really too keen on the generic mom, mama, mommy, especially when I&#39;m out and I find myself jarred into alert mode every time a child calls for their MOMMY. It reminds me of my nursing days, when every time I heard a baby cry, my milk would start to flow&lt;bg&gt;. Just a wonderful memory now, oh how I miss those days.<br/>

&gt;&gt; The author of these &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; is John Rosemond,<br/>
&gt;&gt; a family psychologist who writes a weekly column which<br/>
&gt;&gt; is published in over 200 newspapers. <br/>
&gt;&gt; He gives terrific, common sense advice to parents. His<br/>
&gt;&gt; web site is www.rosemond.com.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Reads more like, &#39;How to crush your children&#39;s spirit<br/>
&gt;&gt; completely&#39;.  I feel like crying for the children of<br/>
&gt;&gt; the parents who read this guy and think that &quot;He gives<br/>
&gt;&gt; terrific, common sense advice&quot;. IMO he seems like a<br/>
&gt;&gt; very frustrated (he obviously didn&#39;t get his &#39;needs&#39;<br/>
&gt;&gt; met and needs to make sure that others don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt;&gt; theirs met either) and controlling person. The fact<br/>
