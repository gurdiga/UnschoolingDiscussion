<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249604908">&quot;My husband is also stressing me out because he doesnt understand <br/>
  Unschooling and thinks at home school should be structured with the <br/>

<br/>
If your husband is a reader, print him out some articles to read, <br/>
borrow some unschooling magazines or books from the library and <br/>
*both* of you read and discuss them.<br/>
<br/>
Some magazines to try: Home Education Magazine, Life Learning <br/>
Magazine (both of which have articles you can read for free on their <br/>
websites), and Live Free, Learn Free which is written *completely* by <br/>
unschooling parents and kids.<br/>
<br/>
Some books to try: The Unschooling Handbook; Homeschooling our <br/>
children, unschooling ourselves; The Unprocessed Child; Parenting a <br/>
free child, an unschooled life; Homeschooling for Excellence; John <br/>
Taylor Gatto or John Holt books (your library should have at least <br/>
*some* of these). <br/>
<br/>
If your husband isn&#39;t interested in reading anything about <br/>
unschooling, I would strongly suggest that you read them anyway. You <br/>
can then drop in little bits of information during conversations. He <br/>
may think of homeschooling as &quot;school-at-home&quot; simply because he&#39;s <br/>
not aware that there are any other ways to do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864478014">Hi thank you for replying. Last night I printed out a forum board <br/>
question I posted with the same thing I posted n the emails and printed <br/>
the unschooling parents replys.  When he got home he asked his daughter <br/>
what she did in school today.  She said we didnt do any book stuff.  I <br/>
felt my heart jump. (hehe why cant kids lie when they need to I <br/>
thought)  Then I turned to my husband and he said why didnt she do any <br/>
school today, and I said she did.  Then I handed him the print out at <br/>
first glance he said so does this mean we have to send her back to <br/>
school since your not finding any joy in it.  I told him to read the <br/>
whole thing before he said anything.<br/>
<br/>
Then he asked, well what if she doesnt show interest in something that <br/>
is vital for her to learn, for example, proper writing, reading and math <br/>
problems.  So I posted that question cause I wasnt sure how to answer <br/>
that.  I told him about our day and how much less stressful and fun it was.<br/>
<br/>
I said the kids played out in the blizzard, made snow angels, <br/>
shoveled.   Then brought some snow in and made snowcream with it.  Then <br/>
she played funbrain.com math.  She helped do some chores.  Fed her <br/>
brother.  Played with her brother.  (and halfway through the day I <br/>
started to feel irresponsible so I made her color some president <br/>
pictures while I colored with her and then I made her read the facts out <br/>
loud to me and then I made her sit with the timer on 10 mins and make a <br/>
booklet of whatever she wanted.)  She didnt like it but she did it. <br/>
<br/>
So I told him see she did PE, Sharing, Measuring, Math, Cleaning, Caring <br/>
for brother.  Watched some TV  learned about presidents and wrote her <br/>
own story.  So she learned today. :P   I still felt unsure at this <br/>
point.  But then I showed him this website I found of The ABC&#39;s of <br/>
Unschooling.  And the Unschooling Recordkeeper.  Because he was a bit <br/>
unsure of how you keep grades in unschooling and a bit skeptical that <br/>
she may not pass SAT&#39;s if she chooses to go to college some day.<br/>
<br/>
Within an hour he said, so I take it you dont like the Switched on <br/>
School House - thats all on computer.  I said yes it is on computer but <br/>
it is still almost all reading and answering questions.  Lynzie hasn&#39;t <br/>
found any fun in it and refuses to do it.  So he posted the Switched on <br/>
School House back on Ebay where we bought it from.  He said he feels <br/>
like he waisted alot of money buying all the books he bought if we arent <br/>
going to use them.  I told him from what I read alot of families new to <br/>
homeschool or and unschool have done the same thing and I can try to <br/>
sell them at this summers rummage sales.<br/>
<br/>
He seemed alot more open to the idea then I thought he would be and <br/>
surprised me with this.<br/>
<br/>
Today it is already almost 10am and I am trying so hard to fight the <br/>
anxiety I feel that I am being irresponsible by letting my daughter <br/>
watch tv and basically choose what she wants to do all day.   It is a <br/>
new road for me and a very scary one.  I am so afraid that too many days <br/>
may go by where she hasnt done anything to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Again thank you for your advise and sorry this thread has gotten so <br/>
long, It&#39;s just that it is all new to me.<br/>

Why did you add that &quot;basically&quot; to &quot;choose&quot;?<br/>

Please try to let her REALLY choose.  And not to think of it as  <br/>
choosing what to do all day, but to choose in each moment whether to  <br/>
do this or that, or wear this or that, or eat or not, or what to eat,  <br/>

School schedules are 180 days out of 365, and of those school days,  <br/>
MANY of them go by without an individual learning something new.<br/>
<br/>
#2, you-the-mom MUST change your view of learning.  If you think  <br/>
learning only happens when someone has &quot;done something to learn,&quot;  <br/>
unschooling will elude you.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>17 Feb 2006, at  7:33pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770256897">Today it is already almost 10am and I am trying so hard to fight the <br/>
anxiety I feel that I am being irresponsible by letting my daughter <br/>
watch tv and basically choose what she wants to do all day.   It is a <br/>
new road for me and a very scary one.  I am so afraid that too many days <br/>
may go by where she hasnt done anything to learn.<br/>
<br/>
********************************88<br/>
<br/>
I thought I might post a bit about our adventures over the past few years in a way that might help &quot;bridge the gap&quot; between your anxiety and unschooling and results.  This is specific to our family, and involves some level of &quot;continuing education&quot; but also demonstrates that unschoolers can get wherever they need to be at any time in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
My son was 16 last year.  He has always hated math and formal writing.  He has spent his time sleeping, sleeping, and more sleeping.  When he is awake, he is on the computer playing games, on the xbox, or watching tv.  He builds bikes and plays video games with his friends.  He does not have a job yet.  He hasn&#39;t gotten his driver&#39;s license either.  He has a girlfriend he likes to spend time with.  And he plays drums in a neighborhood band (he taught himself).  Generally speaking, this is how he has spent his last few years.  A few times, he has gone &quot;trainin&quot; with his buddy who is 30...they go and photograph trains in different train yards, and identify them, learn their history, etc.  Other times, he has helped do some siding jobs with the same buddy. Other hobbies have been biking and skateboarding, hanging out with friends, and fishing/hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, his &quot;education&quot; has been anything but traditional or conventional and has mostly consisted of &quot;dabbling&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Last year he enrolled in a college English Comp course at the local community college.  He enrolled as an &quot;early admit&quot; but could not meet the &quot;admission requirements&quot; for &quot;early admits&quot; because he never took the SAT&#39;s and didn&#39;t have a &quot;transcript&quot;.  So, I made a narrative &quot;transcript&quot; of all the things he has done and he took the college placement test for English.  (not SAT&#39;s)<br/>
<br/>
There are two levels of remediation and he tested into the second level, the one just before qualifying for Eng 101.  This without any formal writing lessons, or at least very few (I also lasped into my anxiety at times).  We were told that most high school *graduates* test into the first level, not the second.  And had it not been for his punctuation, he would have qualified for Eng 101.  After Eng 051, he decided not to pursue any other courses, but he could have, and he could have eventually earned a degree, or transferred into a 4 year school.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, just yesterday, he applied at the local Career and Tech Center (votech).  Last year when we discussed it with the CTC, they said if I graduated him last year (at 16) they would still gladly take him, but it would not be free. I mention this to show that not every &quot;school&quot; thinks like the traditional high school.  They were very willing to work with us.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we decided to wait another year.  This year we were told that in order for him to have a better chance of acceptance, he should enroll through the high school.  (They take all high schoolers first, and then &quot;adult&quot; students (those that have graduated already).  <br/>
<br/>
The high school requires incoming seniors to take the PSSA as juniors to make sure they are all on the same level.  Etown will not graduate any senior who did not pass the junior pssa.  It wouldn&#39;t have mattered if he took it and didn&#39;t pass it, we didnt&#39; care about the Etown diploma.... but we didn&#39;t want to have to deal with any &quot;required mediation&quot; either. <br/>
<br/>
We decided we really did not want to go down the PSSA road at all, that we would rather avoid this kind of testing which we feel has been detrimental to so many kids. But then, we were afraid he wouldn&#39;t even get into the CTC because he&#39;d be enrolling as an adult student.  The CTC recommended we talk to the high school again and see what they would say, so I did. Low and behold, since we do not want an Etown diploma, we do NOT have to take the PSSA.  We merely need to apply to the CTC like anyone else in any other high school.  <br/>
<br/>
So, the bottom line is, my unschooling 17 year old is going to go to the CTC next year and learn a trade, graduate, and start working in the real world as a second year apprentice, and proceed from there.  The average pay for his chosen programs ranges from $17-$50/hour.  <br/>
<br/>
The fact that he unschooled and didn&#39;t have all the traditional stuff doesn&#39;t even matter.<br/>

I think they&#39;re different.  Boobie trap had a bunch of circle shaped  thingys <br/>
with a spring, and you had to take them out without setting off the  spring <br/>
and all the circles flying everywhere. <br/>
 <br/>
In Perfection, you have different shaped puzzle type pieces that go into  the <br/>
same shaped holes, and you try to get all the pieces in their places before  <br/>
the timer goes off and shoots them all over the place.<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, Ebay has a bunch of old &quot;booby trap&quot; games for sale right now.<br/>

   *** &gt; Does anyone remember that board-type game that was a plastic frame<br/>
  &gt; with a<br/>

  &gt; filled into the frame and pushed the panel tight.<br/>
