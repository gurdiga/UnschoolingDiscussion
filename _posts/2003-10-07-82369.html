<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051393832">I&#39;m not a big follower of the California Recall going on right now, but I was <br/>
reading a teaser on AOL&#39;s welcome page and clicked to read the whole article. <br/>
This one small paragraph stood out and as it represents part of a strong <br/>
opinion I have I thought I would pass it on. FWIW<br/>
<br/>
In Thousand Oaks, McClintock voted and urged citizens to &quot;simply vote your <br/>
conscience... If everybody who believes I am the best qualified votes for me, we <br/>
will have an upset tonight.&quot; Things had begun quietly at that polling place, <br/>
but soon people began arriving in large numbers, some with children in tow.<br/>
<br/>
That last line; *some with children in tow.* got me. I am one of those who <br/>
still want to believe that every vote counts and I take my kids everywhere, even <br/>
when I vote. I want them to see what I do, I like to explain my choices and <br/>
like it when they ask about the process. Every time though, I am told that <br/>
children are not allowed in the voting areas, but I take them anyway. I think it <br/>
is important. I wonder by that statement in the article if children in the <br/>
voting area is frowned upon in other areas as well? Do any of you take your kids <br/>
with?<br/>

We used to take our kids, and we&#39;ve even taken them into the booth.  <br/>
Maybe they don&#39;t let people do it anymore, or maybe they weren&#39;t supposed to <br/>
let them, or maybe it&#39;s up to the locals or it&#39;s state law or something, but <br/>
Keith and I used to take Kirby and Marty in, one with each of us, and I <br/>
remember once I let Kirby push the &quot;vote&quot; thing after I&#39;d made my choices.<br/>

^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*<br/>
I always take my kids with me & discuss the same things!  We had some great <br/>
initiatives on our ballot last November.  I talked openly about them and shared <br/>
what I overheard other voters talking about.  (i.e. we had a Hemp Initiative <br/>
that was defeated, I believe because THC was printed on the ballot ~ though <br/>
the whole sentence said &quot;less than --% THC&quot; people only saw THC and voted NO)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been fighting with the Social Security Administration for the past 6 <br/>
weeks, the kids have been with me and know what&#39;s going on.  To get the wheels <br/>
turning faster, we stopped by Tom Daschle&#39;s office yesterday & met with his <br/>
assistant.  It&#39;s amazing how quickly things get resolved at his command!  I know <br/>
we&#39;re fortunate to live in a small state where we have lots of opportunities to <br/>
personally meet our representatives, it gives all of us (including my small <br/>
children) a sense of real live people instead of *politicians on pedistals* <br/>
representing & helping us.  There is an amazing array of political/governmental <br/>
information available in the office, as well.  Today I picked up &quot;How Our Laws <br/>
Are Made,&quot; I think it will be a handy reference guide for when that inevitable <br/>
conversation comes up &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Our system may be different.  We vote at tall round tables with a divider on top, four voters per table, and use a magic marker connect the line of our choice (candidate --or--yes/no).  Then the ballots are slipped into a machine that verifies the ballot as valid and (same machine) later gives precinct totals.  It&#39;s not like we&#39;re in a small booth where you draw the curtain or close a door.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211037592">We&#39;ve always taken our children along when we vote, but they are 4 and 1, so<br/>
that probably gets a different response than if you were bringing along<br/>
older kids. I&#39;ve rarely seen children along when their parents vote unless<br/>
they&#39;re infants or toddlers, but I wish more parents would include their<br/>
kids. Doesn&#39;t mean they have to be in the voting booth necessarily (which is<br/>
probably what the voting officials frown upon the most). Growing up, I<br/>
remember my parents saying they were going to vote, but I had no idea what<br/>
that involved.<br/>

Yeah, that too. I saw it as someone saying &quot;glad they showed up to vote, but <br/>
geez did they have to bring the kids too?&quot; kinda sarcastic like. Which <br/>
reminded me of the issue I addressed kids in the voting area/booth. Another issue I <br/>
have heard about lately is lowering the voting age to 16, which I think would <br/>
be cool, but I am sure there are those who would oppose that. I mean what 16 <br/>

Dylan comes along when I vote.  They give him a ballot to fill out.  He&#39;s<br/>
very interested in politics and is a member of the Green Party.  He has<br/>
collected signatures for ballot initiatives, and written letters to our<br/>

was so important to vote that they didn&#39;t use the excuse of being too busy<br/>
with the kids to go and vote.&quot;  Or &quot;they picked up their kids from<br/>
daycare/school and then went to vote.&quot;<br/>

Let&#39;s face it...kids are not often found at election centers.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>

parents who read that article (heard the news clip?) might get to thinking<br/>
that it just might be ok to bring kids to the polls.<br/>

  Just left voting, had both girls with me and Lexie told me how to vote <br/>
  (which was how I would have voted anyway...)  I ALWAYS take my girls.  <br/>
  Lexie is very political and very opinionated and is going to be the <br/>
  first Black Woman President &quot;I may not be the first woman president and <br/>
  I may not be the first Black president but I will be the first Woman <br/>
  Black President.&quot;<br/>

**I think 16 would be good.  But tonight I wish it would have been 8.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have similar things going on in these unschooling houses don&#39;t we.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 9 yr old dd couldn&#39;t understand why she didn&#39;t get to vote in the next presidential election.  I had a hard time explaining why the age is at 18. :(<br/>
<br/>
We had an interesting conversation about politics and entertainment,  stemming from Schwartzenegger&#39;s campaign.  She couldn&#39;t believe that a movie star would be running for governor.  And then I clued her in on Reagan and our former Minnesota governor Ventura, yes a professional wrestler/actor can also become governor, &lt;sheesh&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have also always brought our kids with to voting.   People working the polling places are usually grandmas and grandpas here too.   Usually, love the kids and give them the sticker.    My kids have been totally fascinated with the polling places.<br/>
<br/>
Kelli~  who is sure that we will all be able to spell Schwartzenegger after the next few days. <br/>

much, but is old enough and small enough that we mostly know each <br/>
other. The voting location has been in the same person&#39;s garage for <br/>
about 30 years. They have people donate goodies and they have coffee <br/>
and punch and people hang out - kids run around all over the place - <br/>
all outside.  Its time for catching up on neighbors - finding out who <br/>
is doing what, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507901426">I take my kids with me to vote.  Nobody has told me that I can&#39;t bring<br/>
them in.  ONe year, a voting officient even offered a stool to my ds<br/>
so he could see what I was doing!  I live in a small-ish town, where<br/>
the same officients volunteer year after year and tend to know who you<br/>
are when you walk through the door. So maybe that personal familiarity<br/>
has something to do with why I haven&#39;t had trouble.  Also, the<br/>
officients where I go are always lamenting over how so many people on<br/>
the rolls don&#39;t come in to vote, so they don&#39;t complain when a voter<br/>
comes in with kids.<br/>
<br/>
I loved election day when I was a kid.  (in the 1970&#39;s)   My parents<br/>
took us with them into the voting booth.  Voting was an important part<br/>
of the adult world, so I felt really important being in there with<br/>
them, and very curious, too.  (I really remember feeling this way.)  I<br/>
think  I went with them till I was about 10 or so.  <br/>
<br/>
I find it very sad that kids are being kept out of voting places.  I<br/>
think this restriction does us a disserviice, as generating interest<br/>
in voting when kids are curious about it will increase the number of<br/>
voting adults later.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the common argument for not allowing kids in with their<br/>
parents is that they are disruptive.  But I tell ya, <br/>
when I go to vote, the man who comes in and jaws with the officient<br/>
while waiting his turn (booming, &quot;Howdy , Fred!  I <br/>
missed ya at the last something-or-other at the VFW&quot;) is much louder<br/>
and disruptive than my kids are!  Even adults forget to be quiet<br/>
sometimes.</div>
