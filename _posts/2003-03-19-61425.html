<div id="ygrps-yiv-221441897">I don&#39;t remember who wrote about their kid and the badger fur, but I<br/>
keep thinking about her.  I have another little friend so much like<br/>
her.  I have seen him catch fish with his bare hands.  He and my son<br/>
found a mostly dead chipmonk the other day and this kid has nursed the<br/>
little thing back to health.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am writing because our family recently read a book that I<br/>
think your daughter (or any nature loving kid) might enjoy.  It is<br/>
called &quot;Beaversprite&quot; by Dorothy Richards (at least I&#39;m 90% sure that<br/>
was her last name).  She fell in love with beavers and started a<br/>
wildlife sanctuary in upstate New York in the &#39;60&#39;s (about an hour from<br/>
where we live).  She must have been a real character.  I&#39;m not sure I<br/>
agree with all she did, but I loved how passionate she was in doing what<br/>
she thought was right.  There are lots of photos of Dot with her beavers<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Some other books we&#39;ve read that were fun on the animal track are &quot;Ring<br/>
of Bright Water&quot; (also available on video) and another older one called<br/>
&quot;Incident at Hawk&#39;s Hill&quot; by Allen Eckert.  This is an historical novel<br/>
about a 6 year old who can talk to animals.  Oh, &quot;My side of the<br/>
Mountain&quot; and &quot;Frightful&#39;s Mountain&quot; by Jean Craighead George are also<br/>
really wonderful kid-in-nature stories with lots to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would share some of our families favorites since some of<br/>
them are definitely not on the best seller list (and may not even be in<br/>
print anymore; we got &quot;Beaversprite&quot; at a library sale) but are<br/>
wonderful reads.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724374734">Oh, you definitely have a treasure!  Cultivate it and nurture it and cherish it!!<br/>
<br/>
 I was also thinking and forgot to write, that she might love to talk to your local wildlife rehabilitator.  The ones I know love talking to kids.  Who knows, maybe an apprenticeship is in her future!<br/>
