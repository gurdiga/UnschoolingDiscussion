<div id="ygrps-yiv-268798433">Continuing the pet thread...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is turning 10 this month.  She really wants a dog.  Dh <br/>
finally said ok, IF she can be the one to take care of it.  Neither <br/>
he nor I want the responsibility--it&#39;s enough taking care of the <br/>
house and the kids!  Neither of us mind having a dog around if she <br/>
does the work.  We made it very clear to her all of the things she <br/>
would need to do.  She wants a chocolate lab.  We found a breeder and <br/>
are waiting for the dog to have puppies. <br/>
<br/>
When we were at the library she got some books on dog care and read a <br/>
lot.  She wrote stuff down from the book so that she could tell her <br/>
dad and I about it.  <br/>
<br/>
Then one day she came to me crying.  She didn&#39;t know if she should <br/>
get the dog or not.  She said she really wants it but doesn&#39;t know if <br/>
she will be able to handle the responsibility.  She also said that <br/>
she&#39;s afraid she&#39;ll feel that it&#39;s unfair that her younger brothers <br/>
will enjoy playing with the dog but she&#39;ll end up doing all the <br/>
work.  I was torn.  I didn&#39;t know whether to encourage her to go for <br/>
something that she really wanted (a puppy) or to seriously consider <br/>
the reality of all the work a puppy would be.  I ended up telling her <br/>
to just give it some more thought, that the decision was hers, and to <br/>
spend some time thinking about whether she wanted the dog badly <br/>
enough to be willing to spend the time on the puppy that she would <br/>
need to spend on it.  I&#39;d be paying 200 for this dog so I don&#39;t want <br/>
to just get it and give it away if it doesn&#39;t work out. <br/>
<br/>
Now, a neighbor girl has gotten a lab puppy and has spent a lot of <br/>
time playing with it in our yard and even brought it into the house <br/>
once.  Our cat was terrified of the dog.  I grew up with a dog and a <br/>
cat living peacefully in the same house--we even had a cat nursing <br/>
from a dog alongside the puppies!  But our cat really is terrified of <br/>
this dog.  If we got a dog, what if the cat never got used to it? (Dd <br/>
is also very attached to the cat and would be heartbroken if the cat <br/>
changed personalities or got hurt because of the dog)<br/>
<br/>
So what would you do?  Encourage her to get the dog, or encourage her <br/>
not to get the dog?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767761604">Our daughter wanted a dog from the day she first saw one.  I do<br/>
not like dogs.  I like and have cats, chickens emus etc.  Dogs<br/>
eat chickens and chase cats all too often.<br/>
<br/>
That said, here is what we did.  Some of it may work for you.<br/>
First I did some research with folks who use assistance dogs -<br/>
they are very practical about their working dogs.  In their<br/>
estimation essentially no kid is going to be able to take full<br/>
care taking responsibility for a dog, especially for training a<br/>
puppy.  No matter how responsible and dedicated the owner is, we<br/>
are talking kids.  Your daughter may vary in this, but it led me<br/>
to see the responsibility thing differently.  She had to be old<br/>
enough dedicated enough to be the dog&#39;s emotional owner/&quot;alpha<br/>
person&quot;.  She didn&#39;t need to be old enough to drive to the vet&#39;s<br/>
or order Frontline Plus.  5 seemed to be about the right age for<br/>
that and was.  She feeds the dog, brushes the dog (more or less<br/>
daily), plays with the dog because they go on rambles together.<br/>
She is a lost cause for training the dog - smart as Percy is, she<br/>
doesn&#39;t get long explanations of &quot;When I do this, you do that,<br/>
good baby dog&quot; and DD doesn&#39;t get Skinnerian modification as a<br/>
learning style, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Second we did breed research - a lab pretty as they are would<br/>
have driven us crazy, but a collie was a good idea.  She on her<br/>
own selected collie as we researched, read stories, talked to<br/>
people who have dogs.  I would be really sure that your daughter<br/>
has a good idea of what is involved in keeping a lab fully<br/>
occupied enough to be a happy dog - they are pretty and friendly<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Third - and this was a VERY helpful piece of advice - skip the<br/>
puppy stage if at all possible for your first time around.  That<br/>
was the single happiest tid bit we got.  Percy is a rescue dog<br/>
who came to us at about a year, mainly collie, fully vaxxd,<br/>
wormed, housebroken at so forth.  We got to know her personality<br/>
and preferences before we took her; we knew she liked cats.  Her<br/>
former owner still touches base from time to make sure she is a<br/>
happy dog.  After almost 2 years with her, I would be willing to<br/>
undertake a puppy maybe.  DD would love a dog who is not &quot;fixed&quot;<br/>
because she would like to see how mamma dogs raise puppies.<br/>
Dunno; may happen; am hugely glad we got a &quot;broken&quot; mostly grown<br/>
rescue to start with though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-469881051">Not to worry - when we bring animals into the world we are their<br/>
stewards - I never even turn down a rescue cat.<br/>
<br/>
I would have a hard time suggesting a puppy video as a suitable<br/>
substitute for the collaborative homeschool project our Mama cat<br/>
is having with her kittens and our daughter.  Every day one or<br/>
two wild things gets caught by Cat, who brings them up to the<br/>
deck (where kittens are) and who teaches anatomy and killing<br/>
methods to the babies and to DD.   Cat has been bringing an extra<br/>
for DD in the past week so that she can take &quot;hers&quot; in to inspect<br/>
and dissect.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to learning a good deal about how kittens learn to be<br/>
cats and about my tolerance for the risk of disease, it is a<br/>
first hand example of how important it is to have your mom show<br/>
you stuff.  She has seen kittens who left mom at 6 weeks and<br/>
never figured out how to kill the creature they brought in to<br/>
show us.  Terrified mice and baby bunnies released in the den are<br/>
really worse than dinner on the deck.<br/>

<br/>
If it was me, I would say let&#39;s get the dog. I would also be very aware that<br/>
there will be times when I will be doing something for or to the dog. The<br/>
cat will get used to the dog. If the dog isn&#39;t just let loose in the house<br/>
to scare the crap out of the cat, the cat will adjust. It will take time and<br/>
effort and patience above and beyond the puppy situation itself. I would<br/>
want my daughter to enjoy and love this opportunity and also not feel guilty<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
IF you really don&#39;t want to spend any time at all taking care of this dog,<br/>
don&#39;t get it.<br/>

are easy to have as long as you are around for them. Now Jack Russels or<br/>

Reminds me of a story. (I&#39;m starting to feel like Sophia) Picture this, one<br/>
of those birthing stories on cable. The mom was having the baby at home and<br/>
the older brother was there to see the new baby come into the world. The<br/>
little boy was about 4. Well mom was screaming up a storm and scared the<br/>
crap out of the little kid. They finally get him calmed down and she quiets<br/>
up when you could see the baby&#39;s head. So they get the little boy to come<br/>
and see the baby and all he sees is a full head of wet black hair (fur?) and<br/>
screams with such excitement for the first time in hours that mom is having<br/>
a puppy!!!!! Poor little thing must have been disappointed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402357123">lol!  I&#39;ll clear up the confusion.  Yes, you are both right.  The <br/>
child wants the dog but felt overwhelmed at the thought of being <br/>
solely responsible for it.  She&#39;s also worried that the dog might <br/>
chew some things up, and she&#39;s worried about her cat.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to see her get a dog if she wants one.  But quite frankly, <br/>
with three children making messes in the house all day, I can barely <br/>
keep up with the housework now.  On one hand, I can barely fathom how <br/>
I would be able to take care of a puppy on top of taking care of the <br/>
little ones and the house.  On the other hand, I really want to help <br/>
her have a dog and tell myself if I just make myself be real <br/>
disciplined that I can make myself keep up with all the work.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel so guilty with the whole unschooling thing--like I <br/>
should be able to give them so much more than I&#39;m capable of giving. <br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t be sad!  I&#39;m willing to bet if you provide a supportive environment <br/>
for her to have a dog that she will do just fine!  Help her work out a rough <br/>
schedule and talk about the possibility of adopting.  Our shelters here will <br/>
allow you to come in and groom or play with the animals and some even allow <br/>
trial stays for 1-3 nights.  I think a puppy would be hard for your family <br/>
at this time.  But there are plenty of wonderful dogs at the shelters that <br/>
need your daughter and her love and dedication!  Here, it costs anywhere <br/>
from $35-75.  With the rest of the money, you could sign up for obedience <br/>
training and buy initial supplies!  (Even if the dog is trained it would be <br/>
great for them to go to class together and learn how to work together!)<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed yourself!  Take your kids on a <br/>
trip to the shelter.  You&#39;ll be glad you did!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122425757">***Neither <br/>
he nor I want the responsibility--it&#39;s enough taking care of the <br/>
house and the kids!  Neither of us mind having a dog around if she <br/>
does the work.  We made it very clear to her all of the things she <br/>
would need to do. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s a lot of responsibility for a kid who&#39;s never had a dog.<br/>
She can&#39;t know how tired she&#39;s going to be when the puppy has to go<br/>
outside at two AM.   She can&#39;t know now what it will be like if he has an<br/>
accident and she needs to clean it up when she&#39;s sick.   Yes, a dog is a<br/>
big responsibility and if the parents are unwilling to do it, it seems<br/>
unrealistic to expect a ten year old to do it.<br/>
<br/>
And what happens if she fails to meet your expectations of care giving?  <br/>
Will you make her give up her puppy, a dear friend?    <br/>
<br/>
What are your hopes for her?   Do you want her to be a dedicated dog<br/>
owner, or a happy little girl?   <br/>
<br/>
If you really can&#39;t bear the responsibility of a dog right now, tell her<br/>
why.  Don&#39;t make it her burden. <br/>
A dog should be a joy, not a job.   She should have a wonderful friend in<br/>
a puppy not a chore.  You&#39;ll ruin it for her.   <br/>

<br/>
I agree. We can&#39;t give our kids everything. But we can try to provide them<br/>
with what is really important to them at certain times and be supportive of<br/>
those wants and needs. A puppy is a lot of work and getting an older dog<br/>
would certainly help cut down on that whole time thing. Plus explain to your<br/>
daugher what a great thing you would be doing not just for her but for this<br/>
lonely dog who has no home now. Visit the Humane Society and check out your<br/>
options. Visit often and don&#39;t just decide on what&#39;s there because your<br/>
daughter wants a dog. The shelters generally try real hard to be honest<br/>
about the dogs they place. They don&#39;t want an unhappy family bringing the<br/>
dog back. Explain that there are children and a cat. The shelter here states<br/>
whether they are use to children and other animals, whether they are<br/>
housebroken or not. Older dogs are less likely to chew also. Plus you can<br/>
see the size and decide short or long hair. I&#39;m wanting to visit the shelter<br/>
now just by talking about it.<br/>
<br/>
The important thing is to take your time chosing. Good luck and let us know<br/>
how it goes.<br/>

Also, FORGET a puppy!! Yikes. That IS a lot of work when you already have <br/>

I think respecting your own boundaries is important too.<br/>

And generally no doggy smell either. The only thing that I wonder about with<br/>
greyhounds though is the cat. Generally that isn&#39;t a good idea with that<br/>
kind of dog.<br/>

Another idea that Ren mentioned, rescue dogs. If your daughter and you have<br/>
a certain breed in mind, there&#39;s usually a rescue group for that breed.<br/>

homes test all of that out first, so you should be able to get one from a home <br/>

giving. :(  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Guilt will definitely not get you closer to where you think you <br/>
should be. And it won&#39;t keep you in the happy, engaged, loving frame <br/>
of mind that&#39;s the most conducive to the flow of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Let go of the guilt and do what you can.<br/>
<br/>
The dog answer does not have to be yes or no. Those are not the only <br/>
two choices. I know your dd has picked out a breeder and is wanting a <br/>
puppy, but is that her only option? Someone else suggested getting an <br/>
older pup that&#39;s already been trained up a bit. We rescued a dog from <br/>
the shelter at 18 months old and it&#39;s been great. We bypassed all <br/>
those really intense puppy months.<br/>
<br/>
Another choice might be to consider waiting 6 months or to see if <br/>
life settles down a bit to where you could help her out more. Or <br/>
going for a smaller breed of dog that&#39;s maybe not as much work (less <br/>
poop to clean up, less fur to comb, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have *your* answer. You will find that for yourself. I just <br/>
want to remind you to consider the multiple options available between <br/>
yes and no.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

&lt;&lt; What are your hopes for her?   Do you want her to be a dedicated dog<br/>
owner, or a happy little girl?    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would think if another aspect too.  You have a child who wants to have a <br/>
dog.  She doesn&#39;t live on her own.  She lives with a family.  So would the dog, <br/>
live with the whole family.<br/>
<br/>
A little girl isn&#39;t ready for the full responsibility.  But she wants a dog.  <br/>
And unlike a horse, a dog is pretty [removing the word &quot;doable&quot; due to prior <br/>
conversations on this list]...  feasible.<br/>
<br/>
A dog could live much longer than your daughter would be home, and you can&#39;t <br/>
necessarily force her to take the dog.  What if she&#39;s in a dorm, or going <br/>
abroad?  The dog would live at your house, maybe even if your daughter moved.<br/>
<br/>
What if something happened to your daughter so that she couldn&#39;t physically <br/>
take care of the dog anymore?<br/>
<br/>
So think of this:  What if you had a daughter now who couldn&#39;t physically <br/>
take care of her own biological needs, and you had to take care of her day and <br/>
night.  Many people have children like that.  Think in terms of all the work you <br/>
are NOT having to do, and how little work a dog is compared to that.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have a healthy, happy child who really wants a dog, and it will be <br/>
a little more work for you, MAYBE you should say yes just out of gratitude for <br/>
your child&#39;s health.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s convoluted, but I&#39;ve thought things like that lots of times. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.  If I have a kid who wants to do something (and I do have three of <br/>
them, and they frequently want to do something) what does it say about my <br/>
relationship with them, about their relative importance and worth, if I ONLY say <br/>
yes when it won&#39;t inconvenience me?  Do they have just a little corner of my <br/>
life or are they central?  Do they have just a little sliver of reality in our <br/>
home or are they a big, real part of the family?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the things Sandra said about a dog are true.  I have five dogs, none of <br/>
them were originally mine. But through way of children who went to college, who <br/>
moved out and those who still live at home, they are here.<br/>
<br/>
They are not &quot;mine&quot; but they are MINE.  Just in this year, my youngest son, <br/>
oldest child at home called me on my way home from out to town to &quot;break the <br/>
news&quot;.  The puppy was here, the puppy was staying.  We had TALKED at length <br/>
about NOT getting the puppy.  For all the reasons stated.  He already HAS a dog, I <br/>
take care of it.  He loves her but she&#39;s old.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I really didn&#39;t want a dog and I REALLY didn&#39;t want a puppy that <br/>
I have to watch day and night and sleeps with me and my dh, I now have one.  I <br/>
guess I could just ship the dog off to the pound or something but I just <br/>
can&#39;t.  My son LOVES the dog, he&#39;s busy.  I knew he would be busy.  He does take <br/>
her with him when he can and if I remind him she might like to go.  I feed her, <br/>
I play with her, I let her out, I sleep with her.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want her, she loves me, I love her, has it only been three and a <br/>
half months since she came?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we honor our children and it makes more work for us.  Sometimes <br/>
it&#39;s way more work than we wanted but I see the joy in my son&#39;s face when he <br/>
comes in from work or class or a ballgame and HIS puppy runs to greet him.  In my <br/>
opinion it&#39;s way better than a grandchild at his young age.  It lets him know <br/>
real quick that no matter what his girlfriend says, he is NOT ready for <br/>
anymore responsibility than the puppy, she&#39;s too much at times.<br/>
<br/>
I HATED the IDEA of yet another puppy but I LOVE the puppy that is here, work <br/>
and all, chewed clothes and all, crazy face kisses and all, nighttime <br/>
sneaking under the covers and all.<br/>
<br/>
Sorta like the food you were hesitant to try but your mother said it was oh <br/>
so good, maybe your daughter is nudging you towards something you might very <br/>
well love.  The dog however will be around longer than one bite of food.<br/>
<br/>
BTW we have black labs and LOVE them, the new puppy is a pit bull, one of the <br/>
reasons I kept saying NO, but I researched her breed and have a whole new <br/>
perspective on them.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your decision.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-317655097">I have been thinking about the dog conversations and when I saw this one I <br/>
thought I would suggest a site. &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.iams.com&quot;&gt;www.iams.com&lt;/A&gt; Its also the Eucanuba site but I <br/>
don&#39;t think I am spelling that correctly. Anyway you can go there and type what <br/>
you would like in a dog and it will pull up a list of dogs that would work for <br/>
you.<br/>
We have 3 dogs. Two Brittany&#39;s and one shepard/lab mix. The last is a good <br/>
dog but big and sheds wicked and still runs to the neighbors (they have boarder <br/>
collies)<br/>
 <br/>
The Brittany&#39;s are soft, loving, they love to please and shed very little if <br/>
at all. They do chew, poop and pee they are still pups. One is 6 months and <br/>
the other is 2 months. <br/>
 <br/>
I have to say though when I was little I always asked for a dog. (We had them <br/>
when my parents where together) Every Birthday I said that&#39;s all I wanted and <br/>
every year I was crushed it never happened. Mom always bought a bike or some <br/>
other gift I didn&#39;t want. I have had dogs since I moved out and that works <br/>
fine I will always remember how much I longed for one.<br/>
When we got the Brits our 10 yr. old son said he would help. He does some <br/>
times but mostly we take care of them. The female follows me everywhere even to <br/>
the potty its maddening at times but she is a great dog it&#39;s well worth sharing <br/>
the bathroom with her.<br/>
As for pooping there are foods that produce less poop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086256412">While I understand the reasoning about getting a grown dog, if a child wants <br/>
a puppy and the mom gets an adult dog, that child didn&#39;t get a puppy.<br/>
<br/>
Holly loves babies and wants a babysitting job as SOON as she&#39;s legally old <br/>
enough.  She loves to play with toddlers who are just learning to talk.  LOVES <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If she said &quot;Mom, I want to play with a baby,&quot; and I said &quot;Play with this <br/>
eight year old.  He used to be a baby,&quot; that&#39;s not even NEARLY the same.<br/>
<br/>
Marty wanted a puppy and we got a pound dog, knowing NOTHING about the breed <br/>
or anything.  She was so little and grey and black, and Marty had a grey and <br/>
black blanket she could get lost in, and wouldn&#39;t see her without feeling for <br/>
her.  We have photos of her and Marty, both much littler.  There&#39;s a bond and a <br/>
reality that is there because she was a puppy.  She grew up with Marty as her <br/>
main human.  Marty&#39;s fourteen.  If he leaves home for any reason that&#39;s not <br/>
dog friendly (boot camp, I think lately, but that mood might pass in him) <br/>
Gudrun will live here with us, which is still Marty&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s brilliant, friendly, loves the cats (the cats will curl up and sleep <br/>
with her), and is a good watchdog.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Fallacy.<br/>
<br/>
Older dogs often bond IMMEDIATELY to a human because they may have been <br/>
neglected and ignored. <br/>
<br/>
Puppies take much longer to form bonds because they love everybody! The bond <br/>
forms gradually.<br/>
<br/>
Some families can&#39;t handle the puppy thing. It&#39;s hard on everyone for a <br/>
while---sometimes even for a year or two until the pup matures enough to be <br/>
pleasant (depends on the breed and dog, of course). There are lots of breeds that <br/>
always look &quot;puppy-ish&quot;. Beagles come to mind. Pugs. Most of the toys---that&#39;s <br/>
their job---perpetual puppies.<br/>
<br/>
Our GSD was a rescue. Our bond couldn&#39;t be closer. We got her after a two <br/>
year period of horrible abuse and neglect.<br/>
<br/>
The beagle is the cutest damned thing on four legs though! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
