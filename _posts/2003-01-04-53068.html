<div id="ygrps-yiv-587996354">My son wanted to get in trouble at school, told me all the violent<br/>
things he was going to do to people, how cool it would be, etc. He has<br/>
been labeled bi-polar and has dyslexia. The violent, emotional<br/>
disturbances and the way everyone who was looking in on the situation<br/>
nearly drove many of us in the family to want to kill ourselves. It was<br/>
awful. At first when he was diagnosed  with bi polar I thought &quot;great&quot; I<br/>
finally know what the &quot;label&quot; is. Then the heavy drugs took him over and<br/>
he was what he had feared the most a walking zombie. Then time went by.<br/>
We stopped giving him drugs and gave him a nutritional supplement for<br/>
people with bi polar. I took him out of public school and began<br/>
unschooling. His anger/depression decreased greatly. I have been<br/>
thinking again lately about a society that for the most part doesnt want<br/>
to hear about the things that anger children/teens. We are too busy<br/>
trying to get them to comform so we can school them in a public<br/>
building. Forget that they are individuals. Forget the torment some are<br/>
going through. MAKE them fit! This is an old scenario. It is too easy in<br/>
my opinion, to label teens bipolar, pigeon hole them, and &quot;put them<br/>
away.&quot; It&#39;s a &quot;fix.&quot; Another teen we know has just been labeled bipolar<br/>
by this same doctor and is taking lithium. I asked her has anyone talked<br/>
to you about why you feel angry? She said &quot;no.&quot; She is black living in a<br/>
town with maybe two other blacks in 10,000, adopted (brings up issues<br/>
especially in the teen years), adoptive mom tells her she isn&#39;t wanted -<br/>
never was - etc. many, many times a week - she slit her wrist the last<br/>
time she told her that but didn&#39;t tell the doctor because she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to get her mom in trouble, etc. She just got her license and drives<br/>
like she wants to kill herself and/or anyone else - going through stop<br/>
signs for the &quot;fun&quot; of it. I know kids are angry. If people don&#39;t listen<br/>
it gets worse because they want to be heard, cared about, etc. Just<br/>
about every child, teen and young adult we know is on depression/anxiety<br/>
medication. I wonder how many years it will take to figure out why,<br/>
while they all suffer wondering &quot;what is wrong&quot; with them? Our local<br/>
university is doing a program to try to understand kids with emotional<br/>
disabilities and school issues. I think it should be looked at in the<br/>
opposite way. School enables emotional disabilities in children. That is<br/>
hard for people to hear so we will continue with what we are doing for a<br/>
long time, I am afraid. I keep speaking out about it. I tell any young<br/>
person who will listen to me to tell people how they really feel. It is<br/>
time to do that. They have been devalued far too long. Michele<br/>

<br/>
This is just awful!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to have to rethink my theory that it is *school* that makes<br/>
most teenagers miserable.  (I do think it&#39;s perfectly reasonable for an<br/>
average teen in school to be very pissed about having to be there.)<br/>
<br/>
When parents really make an effort to be rotten, they can out rotten the<br/>
schools any day, because it strikes closer to the child&#39;s heart.<br/>
