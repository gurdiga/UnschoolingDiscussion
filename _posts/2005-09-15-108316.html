follow if you want responses.   While I sometimes answer unique questions by <br/>
personal mail, the same-old stuff is better answered in group settings.<br/>

You might also want to read what Joyce Fetteroll has written about choices, <br/>
and follow the link to her VERY new site (which has a section on chores) here:<br/>

<br/>
You can unschool without that concept, but I think it will limit your deepest <br/>
understanding if you don&#39;t even try to see what people are saying and why.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290456005">A couple years ago I read a post from Sandra saying her <br/>
children &quot;had no school, homework, or chores to feel the need to <br/>
escape from&quot; (or something like that.)<br/>
<br/>
I thought, Huh? How weird is that? Her kids never put away anything <br/>
when they&#39;re done with it? Never bring a dish to the dishwasher? <br/>
Can&#39;t and don&#39;t put their dirty clothes in the hamper, never ever? <br/>
Why would anyone even *want* to live like that?<br/>
<br/>
After some time, I began to understand that &quot;no chores&quot; doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean &quot;they should never ever do anything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From my understanding, a lot of it is attitude. My kids are still <br/>
very little .... but I&#39;ll sometimes say, &quot;Could you please bring <br/>
your dish over to the counter if you&#39;re done? Thanks so much!&quot; <br/>
or, &quot;I&#39;m going to put these blocks away, do you want to help me?&quot; <br/>
(She might or might not.)<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is four. Once I came into my bedroom and she was actually <br/>
making my bed. A few days ago she said, &quot;Let&#39;s all clean up this <br/>
living room!&quot; and started putting her toys away. One day she <br/>
announced that she wanted to wash the car (and we all did it <br/>
together.) She has seen me get out the vacuum and ask if she can <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Does she have assigned chores of any kind? No. Do I give her <br/>
stickers or pennies for putting on her shoes or putting her toys <br/>
away? No.  Will I get mad or punish her if she doesn&#39;t do something? <br/>
No. But has she done various things, at times? Yes. Happily. Of her <br/>
own initiative and decision.<br/>
<br/>
Oh -- another thing that helped me was the idea to treat the kids <br/>
like guests in your house. Yes, if I had dinner guests I might ask <br/>
them to hang out with me in the kitchen and talk while I cleaned up, <br/>
and most likely they might say, &quot;Where should I put this?&quot; or scrape <br/>
a plate. But I wouldn&#39;t nag or chastize them, or tell them they&#39;re <br/>
rude and lazy, because they didn&#39;t jump up to clear the table or <br/>
whatever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-265280664">When we required chores, long ago, I felt like screaming.   I cried.   I <br/>
thought bad thoughts.<br/>

When we changed directions, I didn&#39;t feel like screaming.   There was nothing <br/>
to cry about.   I thought sweet thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Forget about chores for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
If you could choose between making your children smile and making  <br/>
them cry or be angry with you, which would you choose?<br/>
<br/>
If you could choose to do something for someone who made you angry  <br/>
and cry or someone who thought you were the bees knees who would you  <br/>
help?<br/>
<br/>
Picture three friends: one friend has decided that since you&#39;re her  <br/>
friend it&#39;s your responsibility to help her out. She tells you what  <br/>
to do and peers over your shoulder at how well you&#39;re doing and  <br/>
criticizes when you aren&#39;t doing &quot;as well as you should&quot; eg, not  <br/>
meeting her standards. When you&#39;re done she says, thanks, you can go.<br/>
<br/>
Another friend calls you up and asks if you wouldn&#39;t mind helping her  <br/>
out on her car since she needs a third pair of hands. She recognizes  <br/>
that you have more important things to do and please do feel free to  <br/>
say no. If she asks you to do something you aren&#39;t doing well at she  <br/>
apologizes for asking that you do something that was more difficult  <br/>
than she thought. When she&#39;s all done she invites you in for a snack  <br/>
or, as a way of saying thanks for interrupting things that were more  <br/>
important for her, offers to take you out for lunch or take your kids  <br/>
for the afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Another friend never tells anyone when she needs help, never invites  <br/>
anyone over even just to keep her company.<br/>
<br/>
Which friends would you like to keep and which would you like to dump?<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid my mother did all the housework. She had assigned  <br/>
chores when she was young and she hated it and swore she&#39;d never do  <br/>
that to her kids. And she didn&#39;t. The housework all belonged to her.  <br/>
She didn&#39;t share it. She didn&#39;t invite us along to be with her. Her  <br/>
job was to clean the house and take care of our needs. Our job was to  <br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
She must have pictured that when we were &quot;old enough&quot; (teens?) we  <br/>
would then spontaneously start helping. I remember her being angry  <br/>
that my sister and I weren&#39;t naturally pitching in. It was rather  <br/>
baffling to me and my sister why she&#39;d taken care of everything on  <br/>
her own all along and now all of a sudden she needed help.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t talking about the last friend (or my mom) who never asks.  <br/>
We&#39;re recognizing that being someone who is pleasant, who appreciates  <br/>
that others have important things to do (even if those things don&#39;t  <br/>
seem important to us) is someone we want to help. And the person who  <br/>
expects us to help and is critical when we don&#39;t meet their standards  <br/>
isn&#39;t someone we want to help.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re recognizing that by making kids do chores we&#39;re modeling for  <br/>
them that when you want someone else to do what you want that a good  <br/>
strategy is to be bigger and stronger and make them. And yet when  <br/>
children use that tactic -- the tactic we use on them -- on others we  <br/>
wonder what&#39;s wrong with them.<br/>
<br/>
If we want our children to be kind and thoughtful and treat others  <br/>
with respect we need to model that for them. We can make kids *act*  <br/>
respectful and act kind and act thoughtful but when we stop making  <br/>
them and give them the choice, they&#39;re unlikely to want to be kind,  <br/>
thoughtful and respectful of those who don&#39;t treat them that way.<br/>
<br/>
Will people who make their kids do chores get more help? To some  <br/>
extent it seems that way while they&#39;re under our control. It will be  <br/>
paid for by anger and resentment (from parents and kids) and kids who  <br/>
would rather be anywhere else than with us. It&#39;s more likely to  <br/>
create kids who want to be away from us as teens and adults. So we  <br/>
will have traded something temporary -- straightening up -- for  <br/>
something permament -- a lesser relationship with our kids.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And how did you feel about that as a child?<br/>
<br/>
It seems like from your shock that your mother filled you with a  <br/>
feeling of resentment towards housework and feeling that it isn&#39;t  <br/>
fair if others don&#39;t help. And now that the burden of housework is on  <br/>
your shoulders you don&#39;t care that your children feel resentful or  <br/>
angry at helping. It&#39;s only important that you not do it all yourself.<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re passing that resentment onto your kids. Who will pass it  <br/>
onto their kids.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt; was like a &#39;gift&#39; to him, to re-set his toys. I looked at her,<br/>

&gt;&gt; will want to kick her butt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Why should the children take no responsibility?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are defining the word responsibility differently for adults and  <br/>
for children and then treating the two as though they were the same.<br/>
<br/>
Try to think of one responsibility that you as an adult have that you  <br/>
didn&#39;t *choose* to take on and that you can&#39;t walk away from. There  <br/>
may be many you wouldn&#39;t walk away from -- a marriage, your kids,  <br/>
paying taxes -- but the truth is that you *could* walk away. There  <br/>
may be many you don&#39;t feel you had a choice about like caring for an  <br/>
aging parent, but the truth is you *could* make other arrangements  <br/>
but for whatever reasons (guilt, financiall) you *chose* to take it on.<br/>
<br/>
The responsibilities we *choose* to take on for ourselves we get to  <br/>
decide what standards we&#39;ll keep them at. If we take on the  <br/>
responsibility of a house, we get to decide how often to take out the  <br/>
trash, how often to scrub the toilet, when to vacuum: daily, weekly,  <br/>
monthly, yearly. We get to decide what quality meals to prepare:  <br/>
quickies, mixes, takeout, scratch cooking, gourmet.<br/>
<br/>
The responsibilities we *choose* to take on for others we get to  <br/>
decide how closely we&#39;ll stick to what&#39;s required. There are  <br/>
consequences to our choices -- our reputation may go down or up, a  <br/>
project may succeed or fail -- but we get to decide if the  <br/>
consequences are worth it or not.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not the situation with kids. Kids don&#39;t have ownership of  <br/>
the tasks they&#39;re assigned to do. They can&#39;t decide to let something  <br/>
go. If someone assigns them the task of mowing the lawn they can&#39;t  <br/>
decide to turn it into a meadow. (An adult could decide that.) They  <br/>
can&#39;t decide the toilet only needs scrubbed every 6 months. (An adult  <br/>
could decide that and I have on occasion!)<br/>
