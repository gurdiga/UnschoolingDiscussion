hi,
<p>i wouldn&#39;t beat yourself up just know you&#39;re not alone in this experience.&nbsp;
i guess it&#39;s just one of those days when your 3 yo learns limits and how
to read people and not push them when they can&#39;t cope - everything and
anything can be a learning experience &lt;g&gt;&nbsp; the big thing is to
be conscious of what you&#39;re doing even if it&#39;s just being aware that it&#39;s
wrong.
