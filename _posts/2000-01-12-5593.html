time, when he sees all of the benefits a really tight family bond can have<br/>
in comparison to the kids being gone all of the time and their main<br/>
influence being other kids rather than you and him, he will believe.  :-)<br/>

Hi<br/>
I am new to this list.  I&#39;m Cordelia, I have two sons, Jeff is 5, and Leif<br/>
is 2.  I am pretty much sold on hs/unschooling.  My husband is not.  He&#39;s<br/>
concerned about our son not playing enough with other children.<br/>
We go to a playgroup every week for homeschoolers.  He&#39;s in a kindermusik<br/>
class weekly, does swimming weekly soon and I&#39;m going to enroll him in a<br/>
class at the rec center.  I do think we could do more individual playdates<br/>
and play more with the neighborhood kids-<br/>
Any suggestions/rebuttals(to my husband&#39;s concern) are welcome.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
