Yeah----me too. I HATE when some books end because it&#39;s like I&#39;m losing  <br/>
friends. When M*A*S*H went off the air too. There are some movies that I just  <br/>
hate to leave---_Troy_ was like that. I really like the characters: I want to  <br/>
stay in my seat and see what they do next! <br/>
 <br/>
No advice! Sorry.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; But what can compare to the world of, say, Harry Potter?  Or Star Wars?  <br/>
&gt; Even Jimmy Neutron?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He wants there to be a real Hogwarts Castle and space ships, etc.  I just <br/>
&gt; wonder if the books we read and the TV we watch make life boring for him, as he <br/>
&gt; said.  I don&#39;t know where to go with it.  I talked to him about pretending <br/>
&gt; to be whatever he wants and that every time we read or watch something or go <br/>
&gt; somewhere that it is an adventure.  That&#39;s why we like to read so much.  But <br/>

Stories don&#39;t have to end just because the book or movie does. You can go on to tell her more (Once you&#39;ve read a book or watched a movie, it&#39;s yours. Bend, tweak, revise, add on as you wish). Listen to stories she might tell. Draw pictures about it together (my daughter and I just drew a female character for her for Warriors of Might and Magic, she&#39;s been watching DH and I play it for days on the PS2). One of the best times babysitting I ever had was when I took the kids outside, everybody grabbed a stick (sword) and we bashed through the woods nearby for an hour or so in character on a fantasy adventure (This winter my kids and I spent time exploring the south pole in our backyard). Play related computer, gamesystem, roleplaying (these are like living the story, I don&#39;t know how kids grow up without them) and board games. Sew up some story related costumes for Barbies or stuffed animals. Make paper dolls. Sing songs. Visit websites. Build the world of the story with lego or wooden block (My daughter was constructed Might and Magic enviroments out of lego yesterday, soooo cool to watch). Simply be a character for awhile and play as you do your normal housework. Share any dreams or daydreams that were neat stories.<br/>
<br/>
I milk stories for everything I can and plan on sharing that with the kids. :) <br/>

I thought I did too.<br/>
<br/>
Andrew is moving onto Lego Creator on the computer and the Harry Potter games <br/>
on PS2 right now, so that is helping because he is the character and can <br/>
control the environment.  <br/>
<br/>
We do extend the stories.  Right now, Harry Potter is his thing and we talk <br/>
about the rest of Harry&#39;s life and the other character&#39;s.  It was actually <br/>
funny because he asked why aren&#39;t any of the professors married or have families <br/>
and kids?  It was kinda interesting to hear a 6.5 year old ask this.  But this <br/>
is also the kid who has said repeatedly that he will live with us forever but <br/>
once he has a wife and kids, we&#39;ll need a much bigger house.  <br/>
<br/>
I think this actually bother&#39;s me more than him cuz I wish I could give him <br/>
all those wonderful things.  <br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;ll try focusing on what magic we can make.  I was just really <br/>
thrown off with this one.<br/>

One thing that helped was telling her stories (The Adventures of <br/>

them as the heroes, and letting them tell me stories, too, and <br/>
writing some down, and letting them illustrate them or cut out <br/>

It passes, or maybe just grows into something different.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a fairly common thing with some of the dedicated, long-history <br/>
boarding schools, for there to be single teachers who live there all their lives, or <br/>
before they&#39;re married and then again after they&#39;re widowed.  Tell him about <br/>
Catholic schools, with priests, monks and nuns as teachers.  Tell him about the <br/>
earlier 19th C. one-room country schools, taught by single women, who would <br/>
quit the job if they got married and other single women (or maybe men) would <br/>
come along for a while.<br/>
<br/>
As to magic, maybe seek out tales in eye-witness to history books.  Pliny the <br/>
Elder telling about the eruption of Vesuvius long ago, that buried Pompeii <br/>
(he was from another town nearby).  Then of people finding Pompeii so long <br/>
after.   The discoveries of some of the Egyptian tombs.  Of Sutton Hoo.   The Mary <br/>
Rose.   I think archeology is about as magical as it comes sometimes.  Though <br/>
some of it is drudgery for years, there are those moments of discovery where <br/>
history just pours out.   In Kansas City there&#39;s the museum of a recovered <br/>
wreck from the 19th century, a paddle boat with freight bound for general stores <br/>
up the river sank, and the stuff (and part of the boat, and the history of the <br/>
recovery) are all there in the museum.  It&#39;s a wonderous bit of history.  <br/>
&quot;Like a 19th Century Walmart,&quot; one of the narrations says. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the 1970&#39;s  (or early 80&#39;s?) a little boy in England found a medieval <br/>
sword in a little stream.   &#39;70&#39;s too, someone walking in the desert near El Paso <br/>
found a long knife some Spanish explorer  dropped hundreds of years before.  <br/>
Its in the museum in Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an e-mail newsletter called Explorator with links once a week to the <br/>
newest discoveries around the world.<br/>
<br/>
Another kind of magic is music.  We just watched Edward Scissorhands, and the <br/>
score is by Danny Elfman, and it&#39;s amazing, the texture and emotion he puts <br/>
in there with that music.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I think real life is magickal (Of course, being a witch helps<br/>
&lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Real life people have fantastic wonderful exciting adventures.  Many of them<br/>
are written in books, in movies.  My kids loved &quot;Shackleton&quot; and so did I<br/>
since I had read his personal account.<br/>
<br/>
I think even without movies and books, people have lots of adventures and<br/>
quests.....some of us just have to try harder to see it.  Most people in<br/>
their lives have at least a moment when they have to decide whether to stand<br/>
up to evil or let it win.  Granted it probably doesn&#39;t look like a fire<br/>
breathing dragon to anyone but the person facing it down.   They have to<br/>
decide if they are willing to make sacrifices for a friend, they have to<br/>
search out the truth for themselves.  I think this is no less magickal than<br/>
attempting to return a ring to a mountain.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would point out to my son that most of the heroes in his stories<br/>
are older than 6 and perhaps his adventures are waiting for him in the<br/>
future, to keep an eye out for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948658584">well, it can be to an extent.  can&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
i think the real difference is in those stories you don&#39;t hear about all the<br/>
down time or prep time or bathroom time, etc. LOL<br/>
<br/>
for example<br/>
he is only 6.5 and harry potter&#39;s life was pretty mundane if not miserable<br/>
until he was 10<br/>
<br/>
that is not to say that he will discover he is a wizard at 10 like harry<br/>
potter, but he will make discoveries about himself and others throughout his<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
just some thoughts,<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I am ususally quite well prepared for most questions my kids ask but this<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; got to me.  Maybe because I, too, feel the same way sometimes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Andrew (6.5) asks me, &quot;Mama, why is real life so boring?  I mean, ahhhh,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; like my life but why isn&#39;t real stuff like Harry Potter and Lord of the<br/>
Rings<br/>
&gt; and why can&#39;t I be part of it?  I like all of the adventures I have when<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; read together and tell stories but when it&#39;s over, I feel sad cuz I wish<br/>
it were<br/>
&gt; real.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Help?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325246560">life can be an adventure for him.  who knows where he will go and what he<br/>
will do.<br/>
<br/>
i understand wishing there was a hogwarts, etc., but who is to say that they<br/>
don&#39;t exist?  maybe we just don&#39;t know where it is because none of us are<br/>
witches and wizards?<br/>
<br/>
it is like santa clause.  i am a big miracle on 34st fan.  i like christmas<br/>
a lot.  i used to like halloween and am starting to again.  but when my son<br/>
was first born i started thinking that i need to be honest with him.  let<br/>
him know there is no such thing as santa, there are no monsters or boogymen.<br/>
let him know that halloween and christmas are hallmark or religious<br/>
holidays.<br/>
<br/>
but what is wrong with still believing in santa?  and you certainly can&#39;t<br/>
tell me that there is no such thing as monsters!  look at the movie call<br/>
monster (which i refuse to see).  that depicts a real life monster right<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
i guess i am honest with my children, but with things like santa that in<br/>
many ways can&#39;t be proved or disprove, i just tell him how i feel about it<br/>
and that they needs to make up their own mind about it.<br/>
<br/>
probably tmi, sorry<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, that&#39;s kinda why I wanted help with this one cuz we do that kinda<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff all of the time.  Like yesterday we played Quidditch in the pool.<br/>
And we<br/>
&gt; &gt; play Treasure Hunt in the house where we build obstacles and leave hints<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a treasure.  And too much to really list here.  So we do this kinda<br/>
stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; frequently so neither of them (6.5 and nearly 3) really lack in<br/>
imaginative<br/>
&gt; &gt; play.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But what can compare to the world of, say, Harry Potter?  Or Star Wars?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Even Jimmy Neutron?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He wants there to be a real Hogwarts Castle and space ships, etc.  I<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder if the books we read and the TV we watch make life boring for<br/>
him, as he<br/>
&gt; &gt; said.  I don&#39;t know where to go with it.  I talked to him about<br/>
pretending<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be whatever he wants and that every time we read or watch something<br/>
or go<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere that it is an adventure.  That&#39;s why we like to read so much.<br/>
But<br/>
&gt; &gt; he just says, &quot;it&#39;s not the same&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I don&#39;t want to lie to him and say, &quot;well, maybe there is a real this or<br/>
&gt; that or whatever...&quot;  But I don&#39;t want to make life more boring by saying,<br/>
&gt; &quot;well, there&#39;s just no such thing as...so that&#39;s why we pretend and use<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; imaginations and read, etc&quot;.<br/>

lie to my child(ren).  Not just in the typical &quot;don&#39;t tell lies&quot; way.  But <br/>
with all the little things many of us grew up hearing...ex. Santa, Easter Bunny, <br/>
just all those little things. <br/>
SO.... as he got old enough to understand celebrating xmas and such, I just <br/>
never said a word either way.  We decorated, celebrated, did the family <br/>
things.... but I never once told him &quot;Hurry and go to sleep, so Santa will come&quot; or <br/>
anything like that.  Once we moved in with hubby and his 2 children, who DID <br/>
believe in Santa he came and asked me &quot;Is Santa real???&quot;  He was about 4 years <br/>
old.  I said, &quot;Well, we&#39;ve always celebrated xmas, and you know that Santa is a <br/>
fun part of the xmas decorations we use, but what do YOU think Joshua?&quot;  He <br/>
didn&#39;t miss a beat, and said, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t want to make anyone sad, but I&#39;m <br/>
not sure I believe he does, but I think it&#39;s fun to make believe&quot;  I gave him a <br/>
huge hug and kiss and told him, &quot;Then lets just leave it at that then&quot;  He&#39;s <br/>
never brought it up again, nor have I.  And we&#39;ve maintained the same thing <br/>
with little sister who&#39;s now 3.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good thing but my aunt helped her kids &quot;grow out of <br/>
it&quot;.  By this I mean, last year they just really didn&#39;t bring the &quot;big guy&quot; up.  <br/>
When her youngest asked if Santa was coming she said something like, &quot;well, <br/>
I&#39;m not sure, once we all grow up a little, he doesn&#39;t visit anymore, just like <br/>
Mama and Daddy don&#39;t get stuff from him.  We just give eachother things&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think she did this to &quot;test the water&quot; and see if the kids would dearly <br/>
miss him or if it would be understood and they&#39;d move on.  Well, they did move <br/>
on.  I was amazed and I&#39;m not sure why they weren&#39;t traumatized like I thought <br/>
they&#39;d be, but it worked.  Her youngest was 7 and oldest 11.  <br/>
<br/>
I think mine would&#39;ve asked, &quot;well, how come they (the older kids) got <br/>
presents from him last year and they were older than me and I don&#39;t get any now&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she just tried that and they still made lists of things they&#39;d enjoy <br/>
and the prospect of still getting a few goodies helped, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
Now if you were gonna go all out and say that there just isn&#39;t a Santa and <br/>
that all these years, the gifts have been from Mom and Dad or whoever, then I&#39;d <br/>
say just do it honestly.  Explain the &quot;tradition&quot; of it all and that it&#39;s just <br/>
something people have done for a long time and it makes X-mas even more <br/>
special than it is.  And that you just thought you&#39;d like to let them know that <br/>
they&#39;ll still have a wonderful holiday but you didn&#39;t want to have them hear it <br/>
from someone else and have them be disappointed without an explanation.  It&#39;s a <br/>
tradition and it may not last forever.  <br/>
<br/>
I still get stuff labeled from Santa and in our family somebody always sends <br/>
something but only labels it Santa and we never really find out who sent it.  <br/>
And I&#39;m almost 33 :o)<br/>
<br/>
And then, they may just figure it out on their own, which I think mine will, <br/>
at least Andrew (6.5) because he is a &quot;thinker&quot; and even last year he asked <br/>
how the elves can make all the toys there are and I said I guess he sends them <br/>
out to shop, that I really didn&#39;t know.  But he was thinking it over and <br/>
eventually he&#39;ll probably just &quot;know&quot;.<br/>

But she might not want the Santa thing to end.  I think I would try to work<br/>

He is a very magickal energy that changes the world for about a week or two<br/>
every year.<br/>
<br/>
I might  not be quite as sneaky with the arrangements.  I might talk to the<br/>
kids in an off-hand kind of way about how magickal Christmas/Yule is and how<br/>
not all things that are real can be seen.  In the same manner, I might talk<br/>
about how sometimes when you can&#39;t see something or explain it exactly,<br/>
people imagine what it might be like and make up stories to explain things.<br/>

I was trying to suggest letting them have and do all the traditional bits of <br/>
those holidays, not trying to give anyone an easy path to dumping them <br/>
altogether.<br/>
<br/>
We never had much of a &quot;Santa mess.&quot;  I never told them any elaborate <br/>
stories.  Didn&#39;t tell them Santa was real, just said &quot;They say...&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ve never <br/>
seen,&quot; and &quot;Those guys at the store are just guys dressed up so the parents can <br/>
hear what their kids want, and some kids think it&#39;s really fun.&quot;  If they <br/>
asked me directly I&#39;d say &quot;What I know is, when I was a kid I put a stocking out <br/>
and in the morning there was stuff, so I think you should put one out and see <br/>
what happens.&quot;<br/>

It makes the same sense as the first.  Christmas trees are facts.  Costumes <br/>
are facts.  Candy is real.  Santa has more reality than lots of fictional and <br/>
mythological characters because he produces cargo (as it were, and if anyone&#39;s <br/>
interested in bizarre anthropology and history and religion, look up &quot;cargo <br/>
cults&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
And a great deal of &quot;fact&quot; of science and history has changed within my <br/>
lifetime.  Yet there are still Christmas trees and costumes, as there have been for <br/>
a long time.   Sometimes non-scientific reality is WAY more real than the the<br/>
oretical declarations of scientists and analysts, who are proven wrong by <br/>
scientists and analysts who follow them.<br/>

&gt; Why can&#39;t they make up their own minds about everything?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why is Santa better than Christmas trees or candy or costumes?<br/>
