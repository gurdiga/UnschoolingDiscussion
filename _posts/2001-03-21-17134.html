<div id="ygrps-yiv-355560546">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about unschooling in terms of &quot;living&quot;<br/>
rather than an alternate method of &quot;education&quot;.  This list does help a<br/>
lot, but I&#39;m also seeking people to spend time with who are pondering<br/>
these issues.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo, I guess I was hoping for a few unschoolers who met at the park once<br/>
in awhile... =^..^=<br/>
<br/>
Next time we head over the pass I&#39;ll let you know.  It&#39;d be nice to meet<br/>
and really cool if there were others in the area!  We are planning to go<br/>
to the Titanic exhibit at Seattle Center, maybe in May.  Which parks do<br/>
you like to go to in Tacoma?<br/>
<br/>
I have a GREAT friend in Tacoma, but she is now a teacher, aaaaggghhhh! <br/>
We are still good friends, but it&#39;s a challenge when there is a major<br/>
difference in child-rearing ideas.  Our daughters are the same age and we<br/>
met when they were newborns.  Also, it&#39;s tough to find time to get<br/>
together because her dd keeps school hours.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about starting an unschooling &quot;un group&quot; locally.  Just<br/>
giving it a name and listing it in the newspaper support groups and clubs<br/>
listing, maybe the library too.  Trying to find out if there are any<br/>
other unschoolers around here.  It&#39;s quite possible that there are other<br/>
unschoolers, but they haven&#39;t felt any need to join a homeschooling<br/>
group.  <br/>
<br/>
I do feel lucky to be part of an eclectic homeschooling group.  Members<br/>
are very accepting of the variety of approaches that other members use. <br/>
There have been a variety of events through the group, but my favorites<br/>
are the park days and play days, where we can just get together without<br/>
an agenda.  There are a couple of unschoolers, but they are losing faith<br/>
that this approach will work as their kids get older and are requiring<br/>
some academics.<br/>

March is National Nutrition Month<br/>
Did you eat your 5 today?<br/>
(fruits and vegetables, that is!)<br/>

<br/>
***&quot;Organized unschooling group&quot;? &lt;gales of laughter&gt; Mary Ellen, I&#39;m<br/>
afraid<br/>
*this* is the only kind of unschooling group I have...here on line. It<br/>
would<br/>
be fun to get together, though. Perhaps you and I could offer (on-line)<br/>
to<br/>
host an unschooling picnic sometime?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m driving through Gig Harbor tomorrow, as a matter of fact. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267275632">Hi Mary Ellen (and anyone in the PNW)<br/>
<br/>
We like going to just about all the parks here. Depends on the weather and<br/>
what we&#39;re doing. For large get-togethers there&#39;s Wright&#39;s Park in Central<br/>
Tacoma (with an old flower conservatory and many different trees, duck pond,<br/>
etc), Point Defiance Park (with the zoo, Japanese garden, Owen&#39;s beach),<br/>
Wapato Park, Titlow Park...and there&#39;s just little parks all over, too. Some<br/>
have wading pools open in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great to get unschoolers together to just play and hang out. And<br/>
see if the kids click or not. My kids like anyone who can pretend. (even<br/>
BOYS)<br/>
