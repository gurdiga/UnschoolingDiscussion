<div id="ygrps-yiv-643980555">Thursday I came home from the grocery store. My mom was home with the kids, <br/>
Tara and her boyfriend were there also. Without even knowing that Tara and <br/>
Dru knew I was home, they came out of the room and casually walked outside <br/>
and brought in all the groceries for me. Then they were in the laundry room <br/>
washing and folding clothes they had already done. Next they were in the <br/>
kitchen as I was putting things away and started cooking. We all talked as <br/>
each one of us went about what we were doing. As Tara finished up their <br/>
food, Dru pulled the rental car he had around back and washed it. He also <br/>
filled in a well dug hole that Ozzy (our bully) managed in the brief period <br/>
he was outside. Buckets, towels, rags and hose were all put back. After the <br/>
two of them ate, the kitchen was all cleaned up. Tara showed Dru all the <br/>
info she has about college. She really wants to go to the University of <br/>
Miami. She&#39;s getting everything ready to apply. (2 years ago I would never <br/>
have thought Tara would even think about going to college) Tara finished <br/>
clothes and went off to work. Dru came over that night right before picking <br/>
Tara up from work with a handful of heart shaped helium balloons, card, box <br/>
of candy and a big red teddy bear. He wanted them here for Tara when he <br/>
brought her back. On Friday they both called me as soon as they got in to <br/>
Orlando for their weekend with Mickey Mouse.<br/>
<br/>
This all going on while Joseph and Sierra had a lengthy discussion about Abe <br/>
Lincoln and George Washington. This went on for quite awhile when finally <br/>
Joe and I could take it no longer. Where on earth did they learn all that??? <br/>
Not from either one of us. Their answer was very matter of factly &quot;from tv.&quot; <br/>
The discussion swung from having babies to fish to marriage to what they <br/>
wanted to do when they were all grown up. Alyssa in the meantime fascinates <br/>
me with her determination to not be a 2 year old and keep up with Joseph and <br/>
Sierra. She does an incredible job. Aside from her being in diapers, she&#39;s <br/>
not 2 at all. But she seems perfectly happy with who she is. They all seem <br/>
very at ease with the people they are.<br/>
<br/>
So now I think about how my in laws have major doubts about what we are <br/>
doing. Sure in their minds we ruining our kids. I think about the <br/>
conversation with Tara&#39;s dad about how upset he was that I was &quot;allowing&quot; <br/>
Tara to go away to Orlando. Didn&#39;t seem to think it was so special that Tara <br/>
and Dru spend every night of the week here at the house. If it&#39;s dinner or a <br/>
movie, they are right back here afterwards. Not really getting that they <br/>
both have such a comfort zone here that&#39;s where they want to be. The only <br/>
thing in Orlando they can&#39;t do here is go to Magic Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
I look at my kids so self assured and comfortable and happy and can&#39;t help <br/>
but think screw everyone else who doesn&#39;t get it. I&#39;m trusting and so are <br/>
they and we are all happier for it.<br/>

<br/>
When I broke my ankle and my husband was out of town I begged my sister to <br/>
come for a couple of nights to sleep here and make sure the kids were ok.  If <br/>
something happened to them I couldn&#39;t have gotten upstairs.  Both kids were <br/>
freaked over my accident, had trouble sleeping for a long time afterwards.  <br/>
My sister didn&#39;t want them to sleep with her, so Nathan slept in the hallway. <br/>
 She hollered downstairs - &quot;Is he allowed to sleep on the floor?&quot;  Why the <br/>
hell would I have a rule against that?<br/>

Your daughter is growing into a wonderful woman because you have allowed her <br/>
to be herself.  <br/>

Yes I do hate that word. My MIL uses it quite often. Same way as in &quot;You <br/>
allow the children to do that??&quot; Of course you need the incredulous face to <br/>
go along with it!!!!!<br/>

Lord knows what could possibly happen if a child sleeps on the floor!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394096328">Sorry for that last post. My puter gremlin sent it before I was ready.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say that I imagine our children will become all sorts of <br/>
wonderful adults just because we &quot;allow&quot; them to do so. I&#39;m pretty proud.<br/>
