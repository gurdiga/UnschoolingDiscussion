<div id="ygrps-yiv-334441970">**&lt;&lt; I have bought step stools for the kitchen so the kids could reach<br/>
the sink <br/>
easily.  I could just have used a couple of phone books, I guess, but I<br/>
went <br/>
ahead and bought a step stool.  Because they&#39;re more attractive, I guess.<br/>
I have one child who *loves* child sized furniture... chairs and such. <br/>
He <br/>
*could* just use our regular chairs but the little chairs are fun for<br/>
him for <br/>
some reason. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Uncle!  Uncle!!**<br/>

Looks like we are ready for a new topic.  My uncle is having a surprise<br/>
party for his 80th birthday this fall, and I&#39;m going to be spending time<br/>
with a lot of far-flung family members, some of whom are public school teachers.<br/>
<br/>
I need some armor and some ammo for when the critical questions start popping.<br/>
