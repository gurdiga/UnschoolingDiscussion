<div id="ygrps-yiv-283455704">Yes, I&#39;m interested in Pagan holidays.  I found Nanci K. in Idaho&#39;s post<br/>
about Samain, etc. fascinating.  I never learned about any of that<br/>
in school, and, well, if it wasn&#39;t taught in school, I didn&#39;t learn<br/>
it...  I did, however, read a book called &quot;The Druid&#39;s Gift,&quot; I forget<br/>
who wrote it, and it talked a little about Samain.  Very interesting<br/>
book.  I&#39;m very interested in the ways different religions, cultures,<br/>
people, etc., celebrate different events.  Oh, and BTW, Santa means<br/>
Saint in many languages.<br/>
<br/>
Also, thank you to all the people who responded to my request for<br/>
advice, public and private.  Sorry I don&#39;t have time to respond to all<br/>
of you personally - maybe when I&#39;m an old great-great grandmother... <br/>
But I got lots of good advice.  It&#39;s nice to be able to talk about this<br/>
(having a new baby and a toddler) without being immediately scolded for<br/>
keeping my son out of baby genius school - he must be the only toddler<br/>
not enrolled...  My MIL is coming for a few days, which will be nice (in<br/>
a way), but like I said, DH is so burnt out and depressed from his job,<br/>
he&#39;s no help at all at home.  Maybe having his mom here for a while will<br/>
help.<br/>

Love, Melanie in Japan</div>
