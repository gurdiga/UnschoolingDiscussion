<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020701162">Hi everyone! I have been lurking here for several months and learning just so <br/>
much. I hope soon to have the time to post a little more. I have lots of questions!<br/>
<br/>
This was posted on my local homeschooling list and it is just too cool:<br/>

This site gives you live satellite photos of the earth. The one on this page<br/>
shows the world as it goes through daytime/nighttime. It is updated realtime<br/>
so you can actually see the night &quot;move&quot;. I have been fascinated all night and<br/>
thought that I would pass it on...<br/>
