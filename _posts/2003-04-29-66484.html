In addition to magazines, you might also like Linda Dobson&#39;s book, The<br/>
Homeschooling Book of Answers.  It includes lots of info about relaxed<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling.  The book is divided into 83 questions<br/>
with 2 or 3 answers from experienced homeschoolers, including Sandra and<br/>
others on this list.  Typical answers are less than a page long, so it&#39;s<br/>
an easy book to pick up and dip into.  You could even bookmark the<br/>
questions that come up over and over. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
