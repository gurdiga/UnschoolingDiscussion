<div id="ygrps-yiv-100163849">I agree about the neat/messy thing being genetic, and in my family, it skips <br/>
a generation. I mean to say, my mom is a messy extraordinaire, with a <br/>
perfectionist complex. This means, she won&#39;t do any job unless it can be <br/>
done to perfection; thus, many big jobs get ignored, while little jobs are <br/>
done to a spit shine. I remember one morning, after I was an adult, and had <br/>
stayed the night at her house, waking up and having to push aside pots and <br/>
pans in her sink to get a drink of water, while she was standing at the <br/>
stove in her nighty, scrubbing around the burners with a toothbrush! LOL<br/>
<br/>
So, I grew up in a house that was a real mess. Ugly. And tougher, because <br/>
our friends&#39; houses were all tidier than ours, so it was kind of <br/>
embarassing. And I didn&#39;t learn housekeeping.<br/>
<br/>
Well, us kids grew up, and all three of us, two girls and a boy, are <br/>
naturally tidier, than my mom. It&#39;s like we see the clutter, and it drives <br/>
us crazy, so we pick it up,while she is able to step over it and ignore it. <br/>
We don&#39;t clean because our mom taught us to keep things neat always. We just <br/>
SEE it, and do something about it, to different levels of tidy.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m watching my kids, the girls especially, look like turning out to <br/>
have the messy gene. Both of their rooms are always (and I mean always. Not <br/>
&quot;usually&quot; but &quot;always.&quot;_) messy, and they both leave stuff out in the <br/>
kitchen and the front room, and they are both capable of walking right over <br/>
messes. And my oldest girl, when she was 10 or so, I asked her to clean the <br/>
bathroom. When I went in 10 minutes later to check on her, there was stuff <br/>
on the floor, the toilet was untouched, there was some scrubbing powder <br/>
sprinkled in the tub...and she was polishing the faucet of the sink! With a <br/>
q-tip! and some rubbing alcohol!<br/>
<br/>
My boys are both more inclined to pick up, and my girls are like their <br/>
gramma, which is a good thing, really, because she&#39;s outgoing and fun-loving <br/>
and friendly. May they have THOSE traits, as well.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Would there have been a bathroom there if you hadn&#39;t had a child?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-But my biggest fear is that when he grows up and gets married, instead<br/>
&gt;of being a man who can clean up after himself like I got from my MIL, he<br/>
&gt;will be a guy who thinks his job is to sit on the sofa playing video<br/>
&gt;games while his wife cleans up around him.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some of the laziest adults I know were made to do a LOT of chores and heavy<br/>
&gt;yardwork and wood hauling, etc., when they were kids.  And the one who is  <br/>
&gt;THE<br/>
&gt;most industrious and concerned about his house and yard and car is the one<br/>
&gt;we used to tease because his mom picked his laundry up and brought it back<br/>
&gt;folded and put it in his drawers for him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, there&#39;s a big genetic component (discovered in studies of adult<br/>
&gt;twins who were separated at birth) and so it&#39;s just like trying to make all <br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt;kids be equally good at writing or math or music, to try to make them all <br/>
&gt;want<br/>
&gt;  to clean up and do it well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-DIL hates me and never lets me see our grandkids lest I infect them with<br/>
&gt;the messy gene.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Too late on the genes (if the kids are your son&#39;s).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-Of course this is just silly &#39;cause Josh is a helpful and kind guy who<br/>
&gt;would probably share household responsibilities.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe the clean genes are dominant. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370500249">I know just exactly what caused it: my mom&#39;s personality was stronger than <br/>
everyone else&#39;s in the family, and she was a messy. Therefore, whether my <br/>
dad liked it or not, or we were embarassed to have friends over or not, <br/>
(and, I&#39;m not kidding, the house was gross. The carpet looked like the floor <br/>
of a car, and there was never any place to sit down in the front room, nor <br/>
any room in the sink for a glass to get a drink...nasssssty filthy living) <br/>
So, whether we liked it or not, it was Mom&#39;s House, (hm, ownership) and Mom <br/>
didn&#39;t want to bother with it. Because she has a stronger personality, my <br/>
natural inclination to keep tidy (in comparison) didn&#39;t emerge until I had <br/>
my own place (ownership, again) I remember scrubbing my bathroom and <br/>
thinking to myself &quot;Hey! I LIKE having a clean house! I can only stand the <br/>
clutter so long, before I HAVE to do something about it,&quot; It was a <br/>
revelation.<br/>
<br/>
So, as for ownership of my own room, nah. More like ownership of my own <br/>
self, I guess.<br/>

If only we could all magically rearrange and trade.  I&#39;d clean  EVERYBODY&#39;s <br/>
ovens, someone else could pick up my general (easy usually) clutter  and mop my <br/>
floor.  I&#39;ll fold laundry for HOURS if I can watch a familiar  movie at the <br/>
same time.  I hate to mop floors.  I like to clean ovens  and stovetops.<br/>
 <br/>
Pathology maybe, but maybe just too much to do altogether for anyone to do  <br/>
it all (which answers another question around here somewhere...  maybe the  <br/>
pathology is the belief that anyone can do it all).<br/>

pick her up, and she can&#39;t leave the house if there is a piece of hair in <br/>
the bathroom sink, or an unwashed dish anywhere. She cleans before she <br/>
leaves the house, and she&#39;s angry at her kids (was. She isn&#39;t in my life any <br/>
more) Her poor little girl, made to clean up her room, and shouted at if she <br/>
didn&#39;t get on the job...age five-ish. But her house was depressing to be in, <br/>
if only because i saw the cleanness and think &quot;man, my house is a wreck!&quot; <br/>
even though my house is NOT a wreck. It just isn&#39;t spit shined all the time.<br/>
<br/>
That woman ended up staying with us, her and her kids, when her water pipes <br/>
froze and her husband out of town...we have cats, and our Rosie Cat got in <br/>
bed with her. Mind you, I had changed the sheets in that bedroom for the <br/>
arrival of our weekend guests. Well, Rosie insisted on sleeping with this <br/>
woman, and the next day, she insisted that the sheets had to be taken off <br/>
and cleaned, even though it would be her sleeping in that bed again that <br/>
night. Her fingers had cracks, from the bleach water she used to wipe every <br/>
surface whenever she passed by. Maybe she had a mental illness...OCD. She <br/>
was certainly germophobic. But it didn&#39;t manifest in her washing herself <br/>
over and over. It was her house that got the treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the clutter gets to me periodically and I do a Clean the House or <br/>
Freak Out kind of thing, and the house gets clean...and pretty often...and I <br/>
keep up with the Big Chunks in between freak outs. But I&#39;ve never had a <br/>
floor you could eat off of (even the countertops are iffy, sometimes LOL) <br/>
and a place like that would make me crazier than what we have now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938745943">I have a red egg basket that was once my Easter Basket from my grandmother.<br/>
It�s quite a well traveled thing..having accompanied me to Germany as an<br/>
exchange student, up and down the east coast at the whim of the Marine<br/>
Corps, and now to Japan.  Ever since I can remember, it has been the �bits<br/>
and pieces� basket:  stray buttons, earrings, game pieces, etc.  Anything<br/>
too big for the basket gets put back in it�s place, but the little stuff<br/>
hangs out there till someone discovers that a piece of something is missing<br/>
or the basket gets too full.  My kids will often ask, �Can we check the<br/>
basket for Wendy�s arm?�  (Peter Pan never loses his limbs, but Wendy just<br/>
can�t seem to keep it together!)  The basket goes a long way in helping me<br/>
keep my intense need for order in check.  I can enjoy PLAYING Hi-Ho-Cherry-O<br/>
instead of worrying about the pieces we�re likely to be losing.<br/>

That&#39;s true.  My kids think I&#39;m crazy for picking up Legos from the  <br/>
baseboards before I vacuum, though.  If I hand it to them, they won&#39;t be  interested <br/>
in carrying it to the bin.  Unless it&#39;s a lightsaber Lego--those  are very <br/>
important.  Those gray barrel shaped ones, aren&#39;t.<br/>

I used to go through the vacuum cleaner bags to get tiny weapons and Lego  <br/>
light sabers and stuff.  It was worth it to me.  I could pick up  what I could <br/>
see, but what was under the couch or in a dustball in the corner  didn&#39;t show.<br/>
 <br/>
About not picking up pennies, someone did a cost analysis of how many  <br/>
seconds it takes to bend over, get it and stand back up.  Keith says he  thinks <br/>
you&#39;d be making $12 an hour if you could pick up pennies  constantly (and have to <br/>
stand up between times, no shovelling piles of  pennies. &lt;g&gt;)   So the pay <br/>
rate for picking up a penny is $12  an hour, but you&#39;re only getting three <br/>
seconds worth of work.<br/>
 <br/>
People who make better than $12 an hour should leave the pennies for  poorer <br/>
people and kids who will get a thrill.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503211223">Funny thing about pennies.  Here on Okinawa, the bases don�t use pennies at<br/>
all.  Not the PX, Burger King, commissary--- no place except maybe the post<br/>
office.  The reason is that the cost for shipping and re-shipping them here<br/>
is greater than their value.  So, we round up or down to the nearest nickel.<br/>
Now, I am really bad at stopping the gas pump at the whole dollar, and in<br/>
the states, I keep an ashtray full of pennies for this reason.  So, since<br/>
almost everytime I pump gas, I go over by 1 or 2 cents, by the time we leave<br/>
the island, I�ll probably have gotten a tank of gas free!<br/>
<br/>
Every so often, we do find a penny on the ground, and since they are so rare<br/>
here, we consider them especially lucky!<br/>
<br/>
And, in Iraq, they don�t use coins at the PX or the fast food places on the<br/>
camps�they have cardboard POGS for 5, 10, and 25 cents that are good on base<br/>
anywhere in the world!<br/>
<br/>
Tami, full of fun facts!  (or not so fun, depending on your politics and<br/>
tolerance for war.)<br/>

I forwarded it to my husband so he can read it tomorrow at work and will  <br/>
print it out and put it in the bathroom.    That&#39;s how cool info  passes here <br/>
