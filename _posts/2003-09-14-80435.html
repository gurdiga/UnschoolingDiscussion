<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521027852">Matt isn&#39;t reading yet, but today out of nowhere he asked me if there <br/>
is a &quot;L&quot; in &quot;wood&quot;.  I said no, but then wrote down both wood and <br/>
would, explained the difference between the two words and showed him <br/>
the &quot;l&quot; in &quot;would&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
And then it clicked why he asked.  He wanted to know if the first <br/>
letter in wood was &quot;l&quot;, because he sometimes pronounces l&#39;s like <br/>
w&#39;s.  For example, he sometimes says wittew instead of little.  <br/>
<br/>
Some wheels in his brain must have been turning somewhere, and he <br/>
must have been trying to put letters together with words somehow.  He <br/>
knows his brother&#39;s name begins with an L and he pronounces that like <br/>
a &quot;w&quot;, and he pronounces the beginning of wood like a w, so he <br/>
thought they must begin with the same letter.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t try to explain that to him, I just said that they both begin <br/>
with a w, not an l.  He just said &quot;Oh&quot; and went off.  <br/>

<br/>
When Holly was learning (at seven) to pronounce &quot;r&quot;s, sometimes she would <br/>
stop still, and ask if a word had an r in it.  Then she would move her mouth and <br/>
think really hard.<br/>
<br/>
It would have helped her if she had been an early reader.    Now, though, <br/>
nobody would guess she was kinda late with &quot;r&quot; or only read recently.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It won&#39;t be a problem unless someone makes it one. At her age, it is <br/>
totally age-appropriate. She&#39;ll grow out of it at some point. In <br/>
between that time, she might start reading and writing herself. Maybe <br/>
her spelling will reflect the way she talks (like my son <br/>
writes &quot;&quot;vewy bootiful&quot;) Sometimes reading his writing is like <br/>
reading Elmer Fudd, but it&#39;s cute. I have no doubts that, as with <br/>
most of the cute things he used to say (&quot;hostible&quot; instead <br/>
of &quot;hospital&quot;), this too will pass.<br/>
<br/>
Now then, if a child was going to school, where other kids would <br/>
tease them for their speech and/or their writing... THEN it becomes a <br/>
problem. One of the great things about unschooling is that so many so-<br/>
called &quot;problems&quot; just don&#39;t exist, as the kids are allowed to grow <br/>
out of them naturally. I know people who have their 3 y.o.&#39;s in <br/>
speech therapy for very normal 3 y.o. speech patterns, just on the <br/>
off-chance that they won&#39;t outgrow it in time not to be teased at <br/>
school. Twisted.<br/>

It will clear up.<br/>
Play with those sounds in your mouth. They&#39;re really close together, with <br/>
your tongue up in the roof of your mouth.  It&#39;s just hard for baby tongues to do <br/>
certain things.   She&#39;ll grow into it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe sometimes just play around with &quot;la la la la&quot; in some funny way and if <br/>
she can&#39;t do it yet, try again in a month or three, and maybe though it&#39;s hard <br/>
to hear details in flowing speech, she&#39;ll hear the &quot;la la la.&quot; Maybe sing a <br/>
song she knows with just &quot;la&quot; or play &quot;guess the song&quot; by doing a song without <br/>
lyrics, only &quot;la.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328950332">You have me singing now:  &quot;La la la la, la la la la, Elmo&#39;s world. La <br/>
la la la, La la la la, Elmo&#39;s world.  He loves his goldfish, his <br/>
crayon too.  That&#39;s elmo&#39;s world!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And if Luke (who&#39;s 4) joins in, it will sound like, &quot;ee ya ee ya, ee <br/>
ya ee ya, Owmo&#39;s world, ee ya ee ya, ee ya ee ya, Owmo&#39;s world.  Me <br/>
loves my goldfish, ee and my crayon, That&#39;s owmo&#39;s world!&quot;  <br/>
