bought him his own computer during this time so that he and Luke didn&#39;t<br/>
have to keep sharing the same one) Oscar didn&#39;t want to miss a thing so<br/>
he&#39;d pee right in his computer chair.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
By learning gaming-related hygiene our unschoolers are definitely becoming<br/>
better citizens.<br/>
<br/>
A librarian I know has said that some gamers who are in their 20s and 30s<br/>
pee into cups as they play computer games in carrels at the public library.<br/>
She says other patrons are often filing complaints about it, and it&#39;s a<br/>
serious and awkward problem for librarians. So dealing with the need to pee<br/>
is an issue for older gamers, and not just young kids.<br/>
<br/>
We bought our son a laptop for gaming, and a year ago he sometimes took it<br/>
into the bathroom with him to Skype or game. Now he types &quot;BYB&quot; (be right<br/>
back) in chat, or tells his buddies, over Skype, that he&#39;s taking a<br/>
bathroom break and he&#39;ll be back in a minute or two. Learning to type BYB<br/>
or AFK (away from keyboard) or a combination of the two (AFK - BYB) may<br/>
help some kids leave a game briefly to pee. It seems to have helped my son,<br/>
and I&#39;ve noticed his friends use it a lot, too.<br/>
