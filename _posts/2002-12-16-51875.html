<div id="ygrps-yiv-515634072">Does anyone else have kids who like to go to Habbo Hotel?<br/>
<br/>
My kids love it and my daughter requested a &quot;splash tastic card&quot; in order to *buy* credits to furnish her virtual rooms.<br/>
It looks like its a pre-pay debit card, so no danger of getting in debt.<br/>
<br/>
The currency is in British Pounds.<br/>
<br/>
I tried one of the currency exchanges on line to make sure, but is 9 British Pounds really $14??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

It wouldn&#39;t surprise me a bit. My dearest friend is Scottish and I am always a little amazed when she translates something from pounds to dollars for me. <br/>
It was pretty funny to see one of the most intelligent people I know try to figure out our change when she was here:)<br/>

I was just on the phone to my friend in London who said she was looking at <br/>
houses to buy but she was unwilling to spend 200,000 pounds ($300,000, she <br/>
quickly translated, and roughly, I guess) on a 1300 square foot house.  <br/>
<br/>
When we were there a few years back, Holly&#39;s allowance was $6.75 and that was <br/>
four one-pound coins in her reckoning (which I don&#39;t hesitate to trust).<br/>
