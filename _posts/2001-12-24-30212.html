<div id="ygrps-yiv-110171562">&lt;&lt;if they could accept there is no line to conform to&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
but there is a line.  We do not live in a vacuum and our and our children&#39;s<br/>
behavior impact others.  Example:  My 3yo is a different kind of a kid.  He<br/>
is my 4th child and I had over 20 foster kids so it isn&#39;t like I have<br/>
nothing to compare him to.  He is tremendously loud, he is tremendously<br/>
active, he is tremendously tactile.  He is an in your face, yelling (at<br/>
least it seems like it to the listener) little whirlwind.  He is prone to<br/>
tremendous meltdowns.  We work with him at home and try to maneuver our<br/>
lives around so he doesn&#39;t have to be overly stressed.<br/>
<br/>
I try to shop when dh can stay with Danny.  I try to make sure when he does<br/>
have to come with me places that we have snacks, he is rested, has something<br/>
to occupy him, etc..  We still have meltdowns in public places.  He gets<br/>
overly excited and loses it, yelling, hitting, throwing things.  I can&#39;t<br/>
just leave, because if I could have possibly scheduled things differently or<br/>
had a sitter for him, I would have.  Sometimes, I am OK and sometimes I&#39;m<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
I really think that it belittles parents to assume that if they just always<br/>
did things &quot;right&quot;, then situations would work out fine and all would be<br/>
happy.  Sometimes, my kids have bad days, sometimes I do, sometimes the<br/>
neighbor does.  Most times, I am able to come up with a plan that keeps<br/>
things running smoothly.  And sometimes the best laid plans of mice and<br/>
men....<br/>

You know, it really makes me feel good to hear that I am not the only <br/>
one out her facing these types of things!  I can&#39;t agree more with <br/>
what you said here.<br/>
