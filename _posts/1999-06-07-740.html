<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704745269">&lt;Olivia cries: &quot;Anyone out there have any suggestions for<br/>
deschooling-related reading material? I feel like I need an unschooling<br/>
boost into the summer. I always like to have a book in progress; it<br/>
helps keep me motivated.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Olivia ~<br/>
<br/>
	I cannot recommend highly enough &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook ~ How<br/>
to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education&quot; by Grace Llewellyn.<br/>
While it is geared more toward teens, it has a *wealth* of absolutely<br/>
fantastic information for *anyone* who is unschooling. She devotes an<br/>
entire chapter to deschooling entitled, &quot;The importance of The<br/>
Vacation.&quot; The first sentence of that chapter reads, &quot;Before you start<br/>
your new life, you have to let go of the old one.&quot; I&#39;m telling you, this<br/>
book is fantastic and talk about motivating!<br/>
<br/>
	A second book I&#39;d like to mention is &quot;Deschooling our Lives&quot; edited by<br/>
Matt Hern. I&#39;m only on page 5 so I can&#39;t actually &quot;recommend&quot; it, but I<br/>
think it&#39;s going to be a good read. It&#39;s actually a compilation of<br/>
essays/articles by various people, including Grace (mentioned above),<br/>
John Holt, John Taylor Gatto, and even Leo Tolstoy! Hmm....that one<br/>
should be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
	For that &quot;boost&quot; you&#39;re talking about, I would also suggest something<br/>
for *you* that doesn&#39;t necessarily involve homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
Something that will encourage you and give you lots to think about. I<br/>
*love* the books by Sarah ban Breathnach, especially &quot;Simple Abundance.&quot;<br/>
Full of great, short essays which especially speak to women.<br/>
<br/>
	But my *ultimate* recommendation to you would be a great book of poetry<br/>
and a cup of good tea! :o)<br/>
<br/>
	Hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>

this one even more than the first book.<br/>

Both are available in hardback in the US but I ordered the paperback from<br/>
amazon.co.uk. I believe the first book is 50% off at amazon.com because it&#39;s<br/>
on the NY Times bestseller list.<br/>

you updates on some of<br/>
the chapters.  Heather Knox who wrote the Homeschooling as a<br/>
single parent chapter is now a fully qualified homeopath and has<br/>
moved to a small town in the interior of British Columbia to<br/>
build her practice and help out her sister with child-care so<br/>
that Megan can continue to unschool.  Megan is doing serious<br/>
swimming six days a week and we miss her in our shakespeare<br/>
troupe.<br/>
<br/>
Matt Hern (editor) has finished his doctorate and is working at<br/>
Windsor House School (a Sudbury Valley type non-coercive school<br/>
here in North Vancouver), as is Mark Douglas who wrote the music<br/>
chapter.  Matt and Selina have had a second child and both the<br/>
baby and Sadie are part of the Windsor house learning community.<br/>

I would say early-teens on up. It&#39;s 216 pgs. The first time I read it I was <br/>
35, so it&#39;s kinda hard for me to say. I keep trying to get my 14y.o. to read <br/>
it. She started it a couple months ago, but only got to chapter 3, then quit <br/>
(you have to understand Angie--she has this aversion to any kind of U.S. <br/>
history). I ask my 16y.o. to read it, but when she&#39;s not out with her <br/>
boyfriend or working, she&#39;s got her nose stuck in a &quot;Stephen King&quot; book. <br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll try reading it to my 8y.o. I know that it was made into a movie <br/>
recently, but a refuse to see it because I get so tired of screaming at the <br/>
T.V., &quot;Hey, that was NOT in the book!&quot; or &quot;WHAT? They left THAT part out?&quot; <br/>
LOL!! My children won&#39;t let me watch a movie with them if they know I&#39;ve read <br/>
the book. They say I get a little too crazy. LOL.(I ruined &quot;Fried Green <br/>
Tomatoes&quot; for them--poor kids).<br/>

&lt;&lt;Thanks for the suggestion! I love autobiographies. I&#39;ll look for it in the<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a fictional autobiography (just so you know...).<br/>
<br/>
There was a big controversy because the University of New Mexico Press <br/>
published it believing as the author said that it was wholly straight and <br/>
honest autobiography, so we heard more of it in Albuquerque than most other <br/>
places might have.  <br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s a philsosophical bind for you.  If a philosopher is dishonest his <br/>
his advice on honesty still good?  If a writer can inspire peace in the <br/>
reader, does it matter if the writer&#39;s own soul isn&#39;t at peace?<br/>
<br/>
Probably there are cool websites all about the particulars of that situation, <br/>
but I haven&#39;t looked.<br/>
<br/>
Different people judge things different ways.  I&#39;ve been kind of appalled at <br/>
some of the reactions to people about Michael Jackson and Paul Rubens/PeeWee <br/>
Herman.  The former committed a greater offense, certainly, but when someone <br/>
refuses to watch a movie because of the politics or sexuality of an actor, or <br/>
won&#39;t listen to music because the singer is lesbian or some such, I wonder <br/>
whether they intended to experience art or be fans.   So for those who want <br/>
to experience art, the Little Tree book will be fine.  For those who want to <br/>
be fans, it might be marred.  For those who really love autobiography, it <br/>
needs a cautionary label.<br/>

&gt;I suggest &quot;The Education Of Little Tree&quot; by Forrest Carter. It&#39;s the <br/>
&gt;autobiography of the author&#39;s life growing up in the 1930&#39;s and being raised <br/>
&gt;by his Cherokee grandparents.<br/>
<br/>

My son read this almost as soon as he left school. I think he basically<br/>
read the entire thing to me as everything was so interesting to him that<br/>
he&#39;d reread it to me to share it. This book led to Tom Brown Jr. and many<br/>
others. But one thing I thought I&#39;d mention is that a few months after<br/>
reading the book, it came out that this was not an autobiography but purely<br/>
fiction.  My son says he&#39;s glad he learned that after reading it as it<br/>
would have changed his opinion of the book had he known before he read it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Thanks for the suggestion! I love autobiographies. I&#39;ll look for it in the<br/>
 library. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Oh, and A&E network just launched the Biography channel.  I&#39;m hoping that one <br/>
goes on the satellite system we have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877940975">There&#39;s another great &quot;fictional autobiography&quot; I love. It&#39;s a movie only, I<br/>
believe, but I think it&#39;s *really* good. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. Tom Hanks plays in<br/>
it and he plays Forrest really well! It&#39;s one of my all time favorite<br/>

Wow! The entire thing. Well, fiction or non-fiction, I still really love the <br/>
book. It says in the book that he also wrote &quot;Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;. I didn&#39;t <br/>
read it, but dh saw the movie.<br/>
My 14 y.o. dd&#39;s favorite book of all time is &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;.  My 16 y.o. <br/>
is always reading those Stephen King books. This past year I got her to read <br/>
&quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;. When she got to the end, she was sobbing <br/>
uncontrollably. I didn&#39;t think she would ever recover! I just love talking <br/>
about books. Can you tell? O.K. I&#39;ll shut up now.<br/>

      Forrest Gump is a book also. I started reading it a couple years ago <br/>
after I saw the movie, but I gave up on it. The movie was wonderful, IMO. I <br/>
think Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor! <br/>
