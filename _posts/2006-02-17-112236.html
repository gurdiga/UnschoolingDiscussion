next month) LOVES Barbies.  Our guest room is a whole other Barbie <br/>
world!  The continuous story involves Wonder Woman, her mother, Queen <br/>
Hippolyta and the Oracle along with Wonder Woman&#39;s various sisters (all <br/>
played by Barbies of course).  Most recently Paradise Island (our guest <br/>
bed) was home to an all women&#39;s Olympics.  Evie has two Ken&#39;s but they <br/>
live in the piano bench and are rarely seen! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend (homeschooler) who forbade her daughter to play with <br/>
Barbies.  She and I talked MANY times about why she had that rule (body <br/>
image, materialism and appropriate role models were some of the <br/>
topics).  We talked about how Evie and I play with Barbies, we talked <br/>
about the worst case scenario she could imagine happening if her <br/>
daughter had Barbies.  This past Christmas this wonderful friend bought <br/>
her daughter two Barbies and gave her her old Barbies as well!!  Now <br/>
her daughter and mine happily play Barbies every chance they get!<br/>
<br/>
My favorite recent quote from Evie regarding Barbies happened when I <br/>
was straightening the house and was about to put away the atlas that <br/>
was lying open on the piano in the guest room. &quot;Mama, please don&#39;t put <br/>
that away!  Everyone knows you can&#39;t play Barbies without an atlas!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Robyn I will email you off-list with some of our Barbie dioramas--the <br/>
latest involves rock climbing and living with a jungle beast (our cat).<br/>
