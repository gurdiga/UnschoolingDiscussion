What he  did in the book was to perpetuate the myth of the &quot;noble savage&quot; <br/>
--  incidentally disrespecting many of their real traditions along the  <br/>
way.  Some words he used were nonsense words, not even aboriginal  <br/>
languages.  It is unclear whether he was trying an experiment to see  how <br/>
far he could mess with people&#39;s thinking -- I know there are several  <br/>
academics who have written that that was his motivation, but as he  <br/>
cannot defend himself I will give him the benefit of a doubt.  There  is <br/>
no question, however, that he didn&#39;t do enough research into the  <br/>
authenticity of everything he presented as Native  culture.<br/>

From someone who read it because it looked interesting, didn&#39;t know a  thing <br/>
about the author or the backstory....it&#39;s just a book.  I never  assume any <br/>
work of fiction has any kind of authenticity which can be regarded as  true to <br/>
any culture.  It&#39;s the author&#39;s idea and imagination and it&#39;s just  a book.  <br/>

Like &quot;Thriller&quot; is just a song.  ;)<br/>

I DO assume that the biographies and especially autobiographies I&#39;ve read are <br/>
true.   For those in the mood for an autobiography, I really liked the Dalai <br/>
Lama&#39;s (which I read 2/3 of the way through, and which he wrote himself in <br/>
English--it&#39;s not a translation) and Kenneth Branagh&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I used to read autobiographies just to the point where the <br/>
people were grown.   Now I read until they&#39;re in their 40&#39;s or so (and so <br/>
Branagh&#39;s I read to the end &lt;g&gt;).   It&#39;s the equivalent of little kids only <br/>
watching the parts of movies that have kids or animals.   I guess when I&#39;m old I&#39;ll <br/>
read them to the ends.<br/>

What I&#39;m saying is that I thought it was a work of fiction when I read it,  <br/>
and that means I didn&#39;t take any of the Native American culture as points of  <br/>
fact--just artistic renderings.  I was saying that I don&#39;t get my  information <br/>
about any subject from works of fiction.  I was pointing that  out because of <br/>
the paragraph I quoted seemed to imply that we should put some  credibility in <br/>
the NA culture represented in the book.  It doesn&#39;t hold  credibility for me <br/>
because I thought it was a work of fiction.<br/>
 <br/>
I looked around for my copy to see how recent it is and see if it claimed  to <br/>
be autobiographical, but I couldn&#39;t find it on first glance.  I&#39;ll look  <br/>
upstairs later.<br/>
