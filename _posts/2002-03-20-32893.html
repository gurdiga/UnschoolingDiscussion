<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454377448">It&#39;s interesting that someone who objected to the use of &quot;mindful&quot; and who <br/>
says &quot;I have issues with certain words/phrases... they set off an internal <br/>
alarm inside of me... like the words/phrases &#39;how to behave&#39; &#39;instill&#39; <br/>
and some others that I can&#39;t think of off the top of my head right now.&quot;<br/>
is arguing so strenuously that the term &quot;unparenting&quot; isn&#39;t a problem.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best things I&#39;ve seen about unschooling is the positive effect on <br/>
the parents.  I&#39;ve seen moms and dads cry real tears because they are giving <br/>
their children the kind of parenting they could only (maybe) dream of when <br/>
they were little.  It&#39;s a method of re-parenting that lots of psychologists <br/>
charge money to help people accomplish, and we can do it free, as attachment <br/>
parents.  Attachment parenting (which is where a lot of the ideas about being <br/>
WITH kids instead of in opposition to them originated) is MOST definitely <br/>
parenting of the highest order.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not unparenting.<br/>
<br/>
Unparenting (as Joyce&#39;s many references showed) does not have a good <br/>
connotation.<br/>
