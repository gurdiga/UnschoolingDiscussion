<div id="ygrps-yiv-834810154">The problem is people not thinking for themselves - but blindly following a leader. I think there is one truth - not 50 zillion - but it is up to the individual to find it. Sometimes you may never find it - but it is the act of looking for it that builds your character.  I don&#39;t think killing other people in the name of religion is the answer - obviously.  To me it appears very logical - if your religion preaches that it is necessary to hurt or rid the world of others that don&#39;t believe as you do - I would think you&#39;d start searching for the real truth. I know there are those out there who don&#39;t see this as absurd - there are always justifications. heck - the Pope is still apologizing for past wrongs -  <br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to discuss religious veiws ( I would like to know what the requirements for the Messiah were in the Old Testament  that weren&#39;t fuliflled by Jesus were?) but often both parties think they are right about opposite sides of a subject - and where is the meeting ground?  If you are truely searching for truth - or have found it...why the need to convince others that your way - is THE way? If they are meant to find it - they will - if they have another path - so be it.  But you can&#39;t find it by listening to someone tell you - you need to find it for yourself. It is in the same nature we discuss education. You can&#39;t TEACH a child - you can only lead them to the water - and let them drink - if they so choose. You can&#39;t make anyone see your way -  I guess you can &quot;strew&quot; but unless they want to find something for themselves - they won&#39;t. And they may teach you a thing or two along the way!<br/>

  &gt; Christianity started in Israel because Jesus came to fulfill the <br/>
  &gt; law.  Now, instead of just the Israelites being God&#39;s chosen people, <br/>
  &gt; all who come to faith in Christ are God&#39;s chosen people.  <br/>
<br/>
  I am not trying to start anything and hopefully I am not reading to much into <br/>
  this.... Are you saying that the only ones that come to faith in Christ are <br/>
  God&#39;s chosen people?<br/>
  Is everyone else dismissed?<br/>
  I just wonder because of the battles of religion right annow and in the <br/>
  past....<br/>
  Two of the major ones say that if you don&#39;t follow this way, you are going to <br/>
  hell. You can&#39;t follow both ways and it just drives me nuts. I can see why <br/>
  alot of people get turned off of religion because of it.<br/>
  I guess that there will always be that battle and I just excuse myself from <br/>
  particpating in it , and let those with those thoughts fight it out.....LOL<br/>

Well, hopefully a good personality; ability to work well with others -- one <br/>
on one, and in groups; flexible hours; provide own transportation; and oh <br/>
yeah: die for the sins of the world, healing sickness and disease along the <br/>
way; conquer death; and return making a really big splash by rolling up the <br/>
four corners of the universe.<br/>
