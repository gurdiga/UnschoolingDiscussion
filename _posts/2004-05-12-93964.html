A neighbor of mine worked from home. She had an Aupair that came to their <br/>
house three full days a week and did not live with them. I&#39;m sure there are <br/>
differences in agencies and areas. I knew the Aupair personally, because we invited <br/>
her to the neighbor &quot;moms groups&quot; we started. She had been looking <br/>
specifically for part time, so maybe that made the difference. She was also relocating <br/>
over here, don&#39;t know how that affected it all. Maybe the term &quot;nanny&quot; would <br/>
have fit her better, but she referred to herself as an Aupair, as did her <br/>
employer.??&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a baby-sitter! &lt;g&gt;  Au pair sounds elegantly foreign! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
