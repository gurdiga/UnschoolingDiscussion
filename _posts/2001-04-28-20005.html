I stumbled into a treasure of beautiful illustrations of children at <br/>
work on farms...along with tips on how to help children work safely <br/>
in such a wide array of outdoor tasks. <br/>
<br/>
Even if you don&#39;t live on a farm...you could learn a lot about how to <br/>
teach, coach and protect children who are learning new skills in the <br/>
real world.  A few of the topics that might apply to the backyard <br/>
include:<br/>
<br/>
Some basic safety techniques:<br/>
   Bending <br/>
   Climbing <br/>
   Lifting <br/>
<br/>
And some walks down memory lane of living on a small farm with <br/>
garden, some row crops and a barnyard: <br/>
   Picking rock <br/>
   Hand-weeding <br/>
   Harvesting strawberries <br/>
   Hand-harvesting vegetables <br/>
   Detasseling corn <br/>
   Pruning trees & vines <br/>
   Harvesting tree fruit <br/>
   Composting  <br/>
   Irrigation systems (installation & operation) <br/>
   Repairing fence <br/>
   Running pressure washer (Well...maybe not in my day...)<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s the intriguing peek into agricultural life with <br/>
topics such as: <br/>
Animal Care   <br/>
   Cleaning service alley (stall barn)  <br/>
   Feeding milk to calves  <br/>
   Feeding of silages or corn (to cattle) <br/>
   Feeding hay to cows (square bales) <br/>
   Feeding hay to horses (square bales) <br/>
   Leading/grooming animals <br/>
   Milking cows (using a pipeline) <br/>
   Working with large animals (horses, cattle, etc.) <br/>
   Catching & holding a pig  <br/>
   Working with poultry <br/>
<br/>
...and there are a lot more at this helpful site. I hope you enjoy <br/>
the exploration as delightedly as I did!<br/>
