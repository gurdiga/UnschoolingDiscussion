<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739592824">I don&#39;t post hardly at all, but I just wanted to share with y&#39;all this<br/>
little event.  My daughter is almost 3 (will be in mid-May), and I took her<br/>
to my sister&#39;s public school, where my sister teaches 2nd grade.  Just the<br/>
very thought of going in this school didn&#39;t thrill me, as I had decided<br/>
several months ago that I wanted to let my daughter learn at home, but since<br/>
I love my sister, and the Scholastic Book Fair was going on (got  a nice<br/>
discount through my sister!), I decided to drive 50 miles across the<br/>
Metroplex (Dallas/Ft. Worth) to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Ripley (my daughter) did very well with all the children in my sister&#39;s 2nd<br/>
grade classroom, ate lunch with them just fine, and played on the playground<br/>
with them just fine.  My sister, who arranged to have playground duty so<br/>
that we could stay through recess, finally told me that she was very much in<br/>
favor of schooling your children at home, whether you home or un-school.<br/>
This is coming from a public school teacher!  I had plenty of opportunity to<br/>
watch these kids in my sister&#39;s class, and most of them were able to deal<br/>
very well with a 3yo interrupting their daily schedule, and one of them even<br/>
let Ripley sit in her lap during reading time (the 2nd grader was, however,<br/>
a little taken aback when Ripley starting asking questions about the book<br/>
the 2nd grader was reading, some Berenstain&#39;s Bears book, I think).<br/>
<br/>
It was just a nice point in an otherwise hairy visit; I&#39;m sure you all know<br/>
the rigamarole you have to go through to even visit a public school anymore.<br/>
Plus, my child likes to eat the stupid stickers they want you to wear!<br/>
<br/>
It was both sad (the whole ps atmosphere) and encouraging (my sister&#39;s<br/>
acceptance and support of me to educate Ripley at home).<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, in Ft. Worth, glad she&#39;s going to keep her daughter at home!</div>

<br>although she worked in private schools. &nbsp;But when my eldest was 2 years she 
<br>told me about home schooling, and that I should do this for him. &nbsp;We traveled 
<br>several roads from that initial thought, but over the next few years, she 
<br>continued to urge me to hs. &nbsp;When we moved to South Florida, I did take the 
<br>plunge, and here we are, ending our 7th year. &nbsp;So I guess sometimes sisters 
<br>do give some good advice! LOL

took a trip to a classroom.&nbsp; Last year when thinking about homeschooling my 
kids, I decided to tell my friend from high school/ kindergarten teacher, that I 
was going to homeschool(not an easy thing to do at the time).&nbsp; She invited 
me to her class, I think hoping for me to see how great it can be.&nbsp; She is 
very proud of her class and a great teacher.&nbsp; When I left the class I was 
more sure than ever I would home school.&nbsp; My friend&nbsp;understood and 
though she thinks it isn&#39;t for everyone, does think it is for me.&nbsp; The 
biggest problem is, there just isn&#39;t enough time nor people to even get to know 
the kids or what level&nbsp;they are working at.&nbsp; There wan&#39;t enough time 
to address the children&#39;s need to be heard.&nbsp; I found the whole day more 
depressing than I imagined I would.&nbsp; I felt really bad for the kids with no 
other choice.&nbsp; And this was in a class with a *very* caring teacher who was 
trying to do her best within the system.&nbsp; The teachers that care&nbsp;are 
often caught between a rock and a hard place.</span></font></div>

was this one little boy who was craving attention so bad.&nbsp; He climbed into 
my lap during the circle time story.&nbsp; He just had such a need to be loved, 
it broke my heart.&nbsp; And my kids are looking at me like, &quot;who the heck is 
that kid who just climbed into my spot!&quot;&nbsp; He was disruptive throughout the 
whole class and the teachers aid spent the whole day just keeping him from being 
more disruptive.&nbsp; She had no time for anything else.</span></font></div>

<br>I have gotten nothing but support from my Mom since she started volunteering

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-186144794100082413-05042001"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">My 
friend who is a PS kindergarten teacher knows about unschooling.&nbsp; She is 
going to be my portfolio reviewer when the time comes so I had to enlighten 
her.&nbsp; I photocopied a section from Holt&#39;s &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot;&nbsp; It was 
the section where a family wrote a letter the superintendant with all their 
reasons to home school their daughter along with all the reasons they were not 
going to use a curriculum.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; a great piece.&nbsp; After my 
teacher friend read it she replied that the conditions that this family spoke of 
were the best conditions to learn under. (when one is interested it is real 
learning, when they are ready to learn not a specific age, and on and on)&nbsp; 
She said that they do try to emulate natural learning in her class but that is 
just isn&#39;t possible to follow all the children&#39;s leads, timetables, etc.&nbsp; 
But from her point of view, it was the best way to learn.&nbsp; In this letter 
unschooling wasn&#39;t mentioned so therefore it wouldn&#39;t scare off the 
uninitiated.&nbsp; I think any open minded teacher would agree that the 
conditions that children learn the best at are the same, esp. if they didn&#39;t 
know they were talking about unschooling, but just the conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The topic of home schooling puts a lot of teachers on guard.</font></span></div>

  a person of high energy. She has slowed down over the years because of age. 
  She is over 85 now. (I cannot remember the exact age). My mom is 60 and like 
  me is a pack rat, but a lot more organized than I am. I am learning how to 
  organize MY way. I&#39;m a stamper and so consequently alot of my clutter has to 
  do with my creativity. My daughter on the other hand....(shakes head) needs to 
  learn to put her garbage into the garbage can and her dishes into the kitchen. 
  She makes worse messes in the livingroom than I do! She&#39;s 10, but I&#39;m still 
  trying to get her to do even those basic responsibilities...I&#39;m hoping time 
  will tell as she gets older and gets disgusted with her own messes that she 
  will clean up after herself. Nagging doesn&#39;t work, it produces the opposite 
  extreme...that of a very angry, moody child. So usually I don&#39;t say anything 
  except like once a week, I will say...today we need to get this room cleaned 
  up...so lets have at it and she will help out. But lately the Dr has been 
  telling her she needs to take over the heavier work that I cannot do anymore 
  and she&#39;s sorta getting the idea. I think it will take time 
  however.</font></div>
