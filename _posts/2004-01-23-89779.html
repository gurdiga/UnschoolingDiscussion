<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865733940">It&#39;s been some time since I could participate here. I started grad school this past fall <br/>
and cut back on online time.<br/>
<br/>
But I feel the need to come to say thank you to this list and all that you contributed to <br/>
me last year. Exactly one year ago, we gave up &quot;school at home&quot; and began the <br/>
unschooloing adventure. I&#39;ve aired many of my concerns as they grew, my <br/>
happinesses when things went wonderfully well and my frustrations.<br/>
<br/>
Today, a year later, I thought I&#39;d go on record with some experience to back up my <br/>
hopes that began a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
1. Unschooling has changed how I see my kids. <br/>
I discovered that though I had had pretty good relationships with all five, I often didn&#39;t <br/>
take them seriously at the level of their immediate experiences. I would hear a <br/>
complaint about &quot;getting math done&quot; as immaturity that needed me to help them out <br/>
of it and onto better work habits. Since last year when we took all controls off of <br/>
education, I hear what my kids are *actually saying* to me. I have one 9 yr. old son <br/>
who really hates to write with a pencil. He types online some but his handwriting has <br/>
really suffered from not writing all year.<br/>
<br/>
We talked recently about writing (he wants to keep a life bird list for all the birds he <br/>
enjoys but hates the physical writing part and can&#39;t use a computer for that task in the <br/>
field). He shared that he finds it hard being left-handed on right handed paper, that <br/>
he finds holding the pencil awkward and that his arm starts hurting when he writes.<br/>
<br/>
But he does want to learn to write.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;ve worked out a way for him to practice slowly (one word a day) and when he <br/>
sees a bird that needs jotting down and he can&#39;t get it done, I write it for him. We tend <br/>
to switch off who does the writing.<br/>
<br/>
18 mos. ago I would have worried about him and felt I must make him write. Now I <br/>
hear his concerns, his ambitions and want to work *with him* to solve the problem. <br/>
It&#39;s so much nicer!<br/>
<br/>
2. I&#39;m much more able to stop what I&#39;m doing to spend time on the floor playing with <br/>
my kids. This year I&#39;ve played X Box games, cards, Monopoly, Yugi-Oh cards, and <br/>
math games. If someone wants to sit by the window for two hours watching birds, I <br/>
happily do it too. If someone wants tea time, we hop up, make the muffins, boil the <br/>
water and have tea. We spend time making fires in the hearth and crafts at the table. <br/>
There&#39;s just been a shift in the value I put on all that *real* stuff that used to be the <br/>
&quot;extra* of life at home.<br/>
<br/>
3. We&#39;re reading aloud more than ever. I let them pick the books instead of my <br/>
choosing them. I do make recommendations, but they have the final say. My 7 yr. old <br/>
daughter has purchased those American Girls of Many Lands Dolls (two she&#39;s bought <br/>
with her own money!) and we&#39;re reading those books which has led to more <br/>
discussion of other cultures and the globe (which has led to studying maps and how <br/>
to make them) than any plan I could have come up with.<br/>
<br/>
4. We watch a lot of TV. A lot. <br/>
I have definitely worried about that off and on all year. I&#39;ve still not interefered, but I <br/>
kept thinking it would get less. It really hasn&#39;t. But I watch with them much of the <br/>
time. We have the sit com (on Disney) down to a science. And I&#39;ve been stunned by <br/>
how much learning has gone on about family dynamics, how to structure a sit-com, <br/>
what an archetypal character is in performance (even found ourselves comparing <br/>
&quot;That&#39;s so Raven&quot; to Shakespeare a few times!).<br/>
<br/>
5. I let go of needing to control my teens&#39; social lives. <br/>
That&#39;s been the hardest one for me. But the result is a much happier home life with <br/>
them. They are more eqager for me to know their friends, they&#39;ve shown amazing <br/>
responsiblity as far as letting me know where they are and when and they have not <br/>
once broken our trust or hid anything from us. (My teens are 14 and 16, one boy, one <br/>
girl).<br/>
<br/>
Not all has been rosy. I got too busy with business and grad school in the fall and <br/>
found that some of the spark and creativity of the spring got lost in a rut. But the nice <br/>
thing is, we have figured out how to live together in a loving, nurturing way. It&#39;s not <br/>
hard to reclaim that sense of creativity because everyone is a part of making the life in <br/>
the home. It&#39;s not just up to me.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I do have one child who asked for a &quot;school schedule&quot; so he could have &quot;days off&quot; <br/>
like his other homeschooled friends. The funniest thing to watch is how he whips <br/>
through the small amount of stuff he wanted to work on only to spend most of his <br/>
days the way he did all year--pursuing his interests. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your support and help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470557510">Julie, thanks for sharing that.  I like longterm and before-and-after <br/>
accounts like that.<br/>
<br/>
As to your lefthanded son, can you get him a legal pad with a top-opening <br/>
holder, maybe, or just a cool clipboard, so it&#39;s not left or right handed?<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a lefty and just uses spiral notebooks back-to-front (spiral on <br/>
the side where he&#39;s not writing).<br/>
<br/>
There might be left-handed writing websites now talking about various <br/>
different ways to hold a pencil.   I&#39;ve been told there are five different kinds of <br/>
lefthandedness (by another left-handed &quot;Keith&quot; I know, Keith Hunter), and Keith <br/>
Dodd says there are three good ways to write.  He turns his paper and does <br/>
hook-hand, but others to differently, and Keith Hunter says it&#39;s because of the <br/>
way their brains and bodies are organized.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m right-handed, so I&#39;m passing this on second hand.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is a lefty, and doesn&#39;t write much.  He types well.  When he had to <br/>
take notes by hand for the junior police academy he went to, he re-wrote the <br/>
notes (again by hand) when he got home.  <br/>

I have two lefties in my home.  Same complaints.  There are SOME left-handed <br/>
notebooks at specialty stores but hard to come by.  One of my daughters <br/>
&quot;fixed&quot; this for herself and turns notebooks, spirals, etc., upside down so the <br/>
spine of the notebook is on the opposite side, to the right instead of to the <br/>
left.  Works great for them.  You might show your son this trick and see if it <br/>
helps him any.<br/>

<br/>
About your son who hates to write with a pencil.  I have a left-<br/>
hander, too (mixed dominance, actually) and at age 9, he hated <br/>
writing.  He needed reassurance that his writing would eventually <br/>
look better and that it was okay that it looked rough.  Now at 16,his <br/>
writing is much improved.  But it&#39;s one of my right-handed DDs who <br/>
hates writing with a pencil.  She prefers a fountain pen.  Smoooooth <br/>
flowing -- there&#39;s nothing like it.  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>

Yesterday, my DS -16 gave me a hug and said to DH, &quot;Have you noticed <br/>
that Mom functions best when she gets lots of hugs?&quot;  What a smart <br/>
kid!  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
