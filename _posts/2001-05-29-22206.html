 </span></blockquote>My mother got her GED (in Oregon) many years ago many<br/>
years after having quit school in Atlanta. My sister<br/>
(the one I had custody of ) got her GED (in Florida) <br/>
She now has a MS in Library Science, BA in Design, is<br/>
a librarian, has 3 beautiful gifted young adult<br/>
children....and is JUST BEAUTIFUL in every way. She<br/>
did get married and have a child at 17.  My brother<br/>
got his GED (In Alabama)after serving in the Marines<br/>
during the Vietnam &quot;Conflict&quot; . He is an EMT now. None<br/>
of them were pregnant (at the time..ha!) or criminals.<br/>
