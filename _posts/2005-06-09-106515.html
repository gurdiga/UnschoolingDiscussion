<div id="ygrps-yiv-918003813">Hi Everyone....I&#39;m new to the list and I wanted to introduce myself.<br/>
My name is Tracy and my husband and I are raising our only child (6 <br/>
year old daughter, Jocelyn) in NE Indiana, on our farm. We grow corn <br/>
and beans, and have a stable where we board horses. My husband works <br/>
a day job for half the year usually, though it looks like he will <br/>
work all year this year.<br/>
<br/>
I stumbled across &quot;unschooling&quot; when looking for homeschooling <br/>
information when my daughter was only 3...I had her in preschool for <br/>
6 weeks and yanked her out immediatly after we visited and observed <br/>
the class inconspicuoisly. Shortly after that I read the Unschooling <br/>
Handbook and, well, never looked back. <br/>
<br/>
From time to time I get hung up on &quot;homeschooling&quot; because part of <br/>
me really feels like she will really enjoy life more if &quot;she&#39;d just <br/>
learn to read!&quot;...but she is teaching herself to some degree - site <br/>
reading many words and even sounding out a few. But she has a speech <br/>
hang up (impediment, whatever) and it really seems to impede her <br/>
understanding of word structure. I keep waiting for *that* to <br/>
magically fix itself because the alternative is speech therapy. <br/>
AND....that would mean taking her to the school district and it <br/>
would mean getting her shots up to date (I&#39;m not crazy about it and <br/>
frankly neither is Jocelyn - my husband on the other hand is crazy <br/>
with anxiety that she hasn&#39;t had all of her shots *sigh*).<br/>
<br/>
Aside from running the stable, I was running a small business <br/>
selling handmade soaps and lotions. That business really took off <br/>
and I became so busy that recently it occurred to me that I <br/>
was &quot;working&quot; and my daughter, house, diet, health, and sanity were <br/>
all suffering because of it. My house became a pig-sty, I became <br/>
anxious and resentful (my hobby was taking over my life and ruining <br/>
my day...even the horses were suffering because of my lack of time <br/>
and organization). So last month I quit...closed up shop. Jocelyn <br/>
was so glad when I made the decision that she ran up to her daddy <br/>
when he walked in and said &quot;Mommy&#39;s not going to sell soap anymore, <br/>
so now she can spend time with me!&quot;...pretty clear that I made the <br/>
right choice. <br/>
<br/>
So we have spent the last month playing with the horses (no big <br/>
surprise that as Unschoolers we also practice Natural Horsemanship, <br/>
which is basically Unschooling for horses), working in the garden, <br/>
and TRYING to get the house organized. But I&#39;ve lost something over <br/>
the last 2 years since my business overwhelmed me: <br/>
direction and motivation. I still can&#39;t seem to get the house <br/>
organized and I&#39;m not used to focusing on &quot;play&quot; with Jocelyn. I <br/>
need something to motivate me again, and to get me using my other <br/>
brain again. I was so fired up about life before, and now it&#39;s a <br/>
miracle if I get dinner on the table.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d love some inspiration! A good book to read. A great story, <br/>
website, anything! Maybe reading the archives on this list will be <br/>
all I need? Maybe posting this novella will be all I need (so sorry <br/>
*b*)....but I feel like the excitement about living an unschooling <br/>
life has been put out. I want it back!<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
If so, I&#39;ll be forever grateful :)<br/>

Reading here will be a big help---and the archives will keep you busy <br/>
for MONTHS!<br/>
<br/>
By the time you&#39;ve read it all,.....&lt;g&gt;.....it will be October and time <br/>
to pack for the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in the St Louis <br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great shot in the arm: a hotel (or two) FULL of unschoolers. All <br/>
ages. Inspirational speakers. Funshops. A Raffle. And lots of surprises!<br/>
<br/>
A MUST-attend!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I often feel the same way after a busy couple of *days* (not to<br/>
mention 2 years).  So for a few days I let the housework go, I make<br/>
sure the kids are happy, I order out for dinner and I hole up and do<br/>
something that probably seems aimless and &quot;unmotivated&quot;:  watch TV,<br/>
read a People magazine, bounce a ball against the garage door, wander<br/>
around the neighborhood, sit in a coffee shop and stare out the window.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s called *resting*. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Resting and letting things go may be what your mind, body and soul<br/>
need to do in order to get in tune with the rhythm of your life and<br/>
your daughter&#39;s life again.  Rest.  Flow.  It can feel quite<br/>
uncomfortable, but I find that if I relax into the discomfort, I can<br/>
learn from it, too.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you said that your soap business turned from a hobby -- playing<br/>
-- into something that ruled your life.  I wonder if you&#39;ve become a<br/>
bit wary of play?  Or forgotten how?  Just a thought.  I think if you<br/>
were in a more playful state of mind, your lack of direction and<br/>
motivation wouldn&#39;t bother you so much -- you&#39;d be too busy having fun.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tracy,<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you put a great deal of careful thought into your decision <br/>
and ended up with a solution that puts your family as your first <br/>
priority after seeing how it had been slipping into the background. <br/>
That&#39;s wonderful! And it sounds like your daughter is just thrilled with <br/>
the decision.<br/>
<br/>
This list is truly inspirational, and I would strongly encourage you to <br/>
attend the Live and Learn Conference Kelly mentioned--you will leave <br/>
thoroughly inspired and recharged after spending several days in a hotel <br/>
full of other Unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to invite you to join the AlwaysUnschooled e-list ( <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a> ) as well where you&#39;ll <br/>
be able to chat with lots of moms and a dad or two who Unschool young <br/>
children. It&#39;s great to &quot;hang out&quot; with a bunch of parents dealing with <br/>
the same joys and the same struggles, and it compliments the veteran <br/>
wisdom you&#39;ll find here at UnschoolingDiscussion very nicely, I think. <br/>
For me, it&#39;s nice to hear both the &quot;I&#39;m going through that now, too, and <br/>
here&#39;s how I&#39;m dealing with it&quot; as well as the &quot;I&#39;ve been there done <br/>
that and it will all work out if you just relax and trust them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re also welcome to check out my webpage and my blog linked from it ( <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a> ) where you <br/>
can read lots about my three children, Emily (7), Julia (6) and Sam (5). <br/>
We&#39;re getting ready to move to a 5.24 acre farmette, and we&#39;re very <br/>
excited! But I will heed your warning and be very careful not to let my <br/>
hobby take over my life! ;)<br/>
<br/>
My almost 8 year old can &quot;read&quot; but isn&#39;t reading. Her journey has been <br/>
incredible to watch, and she&#39;s doing such amazing things and making all <br/>
kinds of great connections. I have no doubt it will all fall into place <br/>
over night when it becomes important to her. My 6 year old is no where <br/>
close to reading, but she likes to &quot;work&quot; at it. She likes to sit down <br/>
and *do* things, but often in fleeting bursts. Again, I trust that her <br/>
approach is exactly what *she* needs and that it will all fall into <br/>
place for her as well when she&#39;s ready. There&#39;s still lots of time!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the AlwaysUnschooled list!<br/>

<br/>
What you describe could be a hearing problem, a problem with what&#39;s called &quot;auditory discrimination&quot;.  Some kids, apparently, can&#39;t process the difference between brief sounds.<br/>
<br/>
With really common speech problems, like not pronouncing R&#39;s, I would think that kids still can come close to phonetic spelling, as they still hear the words clearly.  Real confusion about spelling could be an input issue (clear hearing), not an output issue (speech or sequencing with writing). <br/>
<br/>
Do read Sandra&#39;s links on reading.  &quot;Late&quot; reading is quite common, and outside of school it doesn&#39;t lead to frustration and failure, really.  Learning *slowly* and learning when one is ready to learn make learning less confusing and more lasting.  Confusion is not the desired outcome.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>school district - not necessarily. Speech issues and appropriate <br/>
therapy are not the sole province of the school district. A good <br/>
alternative is a college or university with advanced courses in speech <br/>
pathology - the grad students need patients to try out their book <br/>
learning on (there&#39;s always someone overseeing their work) and they <br/>
often have free or low cost options which help if insurance coverage <br/>
isn&#39;t available. Likewise, an ENT (to check the hearing issues - DH <br/>
spent time getting serious testing done a year or so ago - a nasty ear <br/>
infection caused scarring which took away the higher pitches in one <br/>
ear) is/can be an independent agent - if it was a hearing issue, the <br/>
school would probably have to refer you outside anyhow - they can&#39;t do <br/>
the kinds of detailed testing involved. All this mostly to say if you <br/>
think there&#39;s a problem and it is interfering/comes to <br/>
interfere/frustrates your DD, you don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; get involved with <br/>
the school system - there are alternatives available.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250556950">If you are worried about speech, you can buy materials to use at <br/>
home.  I bought earobics for my middle child and my youngest begs to <br/>
use it.  They think it&#39;s fun because it is game based.<br/>
<br/>
www.earobics.com<br/>
superduperinc.com  - has some free materials and a big catalog with <br/>
everything you could ever need<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I bought a phonics game that can be used for speech therapy.  <br/>
It&#39;s called Color Phonics.  I don&#39;t force the kids to use this <br/>
software, just leave it out in case they want to play with it. <br/>

can hear extremely faint sounds. For instance, she once put her ear <br/>
to an egg that we removed from a chicken and she could hear <br/>
the &quot;peck&quot; inside because it was ready to hatch...this is a very, <br/>
very faint sound and it wasn&#39;t promted by me - I didnt tell her that <br/>
she be able to hear anything if she listened. She described the <br/>
sound too. And just last night she heard dad whisper a word he <br/>
didn&#39;t want her to hear. She was 20 feet away and it wasn&#39;t a word <br/>
she&#39;d ever heard so she didn&#39;t just figure it out (oh no, she <br/>
said, &quot;What&#39;s a f****** bastard?&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
I have always felt that the muscles in her mouth/brain connection <br/>
don&#39;t jive. Because when she concentrates she can say the difficult <br/>
sounds. It takes practice though, and she gets better <br/>
with &quot;exercising&quot; the mouth with that sound. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amy, thank you for responding. You really hit on something for me to <br/>
focus on. I&#39;ve noticed that I really don&#39;t know what to do without <br/>
something to do. I did &quot;nothing&quot; very well when Jocelyn was a <br/>
baby/toddler and nursing. That was my focus and when she quit nursing <br/>
I started doing other things...I felt sort of &quot;freed up&quot; having more <br/>
opportunity to start a project or whatever. That lead into the <br/>
business.<br/>
<br/>
So now, when I start playing with Jocelyn I can actually hear myself <br/>
saying &quot;Okay, mommies got stuff to do!&quot; in my head, yet there&#39;s <br/>
nothing to do (besides barn chores and the horses but that is <br/>
something she very willingly participates in). <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just the transition and I need to remind myself that I really <br/>
don&#39;t have anything better to do than hang out with the kiddo :). I <br/>
think it&#39;s like when I go to the strore without Jocelyn and I keep <br/>
looking to see that she&#39;s near, even though she&#39;s at home with dad. <br/>
It&#39;s a habit and I will break it.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going down to the lake today to build a slide off the dock. <br/>
She&#39;s thrilled and it will be a perfect time to practice not having <br/>
anything *else* to do :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for pointing it out for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721151118">hi Tracey,<br/>
if I were you, this is what I would do (I am a veteran<br/>
of more house-moves and room-moves and changes of plan<br/>
than I can remember)...<br/>
Have your daughter help you with a day or 2 --no<br/>
more!!!--of moving everything not of immediate use<br/>
into one room or closet or shed and leaving it there.<br/>
When you pick up an item, you don&#39;t have to actually<br/>
even know what it is. You just have to decide if you<br/>
have an immediate use for it. (you know: toothbrush,<br/>
hairbrush, pen, a glass, etc.) If you don&#39;t, I like to<br/>
put it in the designated zone by size. You can use<br/>
whatever sorting system works. The key is to make it<br/>
quick. then, close the door.<br/>
Next, give every other room a good dusting. <br/>
then, start over. As you think of things you need for<br/>
whatever projects you will dream up, you can go and<br/>
fetch them then. On some days you will be hit with a<br/>
fever of sorting out those things, and you can do that<br/>
then. Don&#39;t worry about it until it happens.<br/>
My son is 12 and I still have a few drawers I haven&#39;t<br/>
sorted out yet. So what? I know where they are, and<br/>
that&#39;s all I need to know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749803510">Well I was motivated by your advice! I didn&#39;t move things into a <br/>
special area - though I started. It made me realize though, that my <br/>
problem had become those special accessory rooms were wiped out so <br/>
cleaning anything else became impossible. So I spent the wwekend on <br/>
the laundry room, mud room and pantry (all places where I would pile <br/>
when I was too lazy/tired/hurried). My husband was quite helpful by <br/>
keeping Jocelyn occupied so I could just zone out and get it done. <br/>
Once those rooms were tidied, everything else sort of &quot;fell into <br/>
place! The fact was that I couldn&#39;t put anything away, <br/>
because &quot;away&quot; meant going into one of those rooms which meant <br/>
cleaning them (and I wasn&#39;t motivated).<br/>
<br/>
So I am proud to say that everything is tidy enough today, that I <br/>
can now get back to a regular &quot;cleaning&quot; (mopping, dusting) schedule <br/>
and not avoid it because of the disorganization.<br/>
<br/>
What a releif! It&#39;s amazing what reading a post from a stranger can <br/>
do for motivation! <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get to the drawers yet...ther are a couple of them....;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870773557">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I stumbled across &quot;unschooling&quot; when looking for homeschooling <br/>
information when my daughter was only 3...I had her in preschool for <br/>
6 weeks and yanked her out immediatly after we visited and observed <br/>
the class inconspicuoisly. Shortly after that I read the Unschooling <br/>
Handbook and, well, never looked back. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; snip<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d love some inspiration! A good book to read. A great story, <br/>
website, anything! Maybe reading the archives on this list will be <br/>
all I need? Maybe posting this novella will be all I need (so sorry <br/>
*b*)....but I feel like the excitement about living an unschooling <br/>
life has been put out. I want it back! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to second Danielle&#39;s invitation over to Always Unschooled. We<br/>
also have an informal book discussion once a month and a list of oft<br/>
recommended books in the Database section of the home page at Yahoo.<br/>
