<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090360388">I&#39;m back from not-really-even-lurking land, and it is SO good to be <br/>
back among unschoolers (even though the discussion this past few days <br/>
has been dominated by CBS&#39;s shenanigans).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m especially feeling this way after an area park day yesterday -- a <br/>
good group for teen support, but mixed in hs&#39;ing philosophy.  <br/>
Normally it&#39;s not a problem; we all respect each others&#39; right to be <br/>
WRONG &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday there were two new people there who are heavily into <br/>
Calvert and had some ugly things to say about unschooling after I <br/>
shared which approach we use (in response to a direct question from <br/>
another mom).  I didn&#39;t feel like arguing alone.  Another unschooling <br/>
mom was there and she didn&#39;t say anything, and even our regulars who <br/>
fall more into the eclectic camp and are normally pretty supportive <br/>
of us were making sympathetic noises with the new women.  <br/>
<br/>
Ugh.  I just felt so out there.  Not that I doubt that what we&#39;re <br/>
doing is right.  I just get tired of having it misunderstood all the <br/>
time.  What a bunch of boobs.  Their opinions were so off base.  So <br/>
rooted in unreality.  And so insulting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being here, then.  For me to come *home* to.  :-)<br/>

Oh I know how you feel!  We just had a troll on our e-mail loop ~ not that <br/>
the loop is unschooling friendly, they&#39;re merely diana tolerant ~ who expounded <br/>
his *superior* Christian Classical education. I was fine until he talked of <br/>
our inclusive group&#39;s support for unschoolers (we are two out of 38 families): <br/>
&quot;But the acceptance, and politically-correct &quot;tolerance&quot; of, immoral societal <br/>
mores is today closely paralleling that of the Roman Empire&quot; He didn&#39;t get any <br/>
better with his next message in which he called us *inept* AARRGGHH!!  The <br/>
coolest thing to come out of the situation was the reaction of the mother bears <br/>
who jumped to the defense of our faltering group (we&#39;re the only inclusive <br/>
group for 350 miles!).  <br/>
It&#39;s nice to have a place where I&#39;m a freak among freaks and not struggling, <br/>
being the only one!  &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d think you lived in Texas!  :-)  We have two guys <br/>
on our statewide *inclusive* list who talk cr*p like that all the time -- and <br/>
in exactly the same overblown way, too.  *Immoral societal mores* my butt.  <br/>
AARRGGHH is right.  What gives them the right to be so smug and superior, <br/>
anyway?  I like to think that I&#39;m a LOT more tolerant of those who are different <br/>
from me than that.  Maybe I&#39;m kidding myself, considering my reaction to this, <br/>
but it&#39;s what I like to believe.  I&#39;ll calm down in a bit, and I don&#39;t start <br/>
stuff like this -- you know?  It&#39;s just hard to stay cool and collected when I&#39;m <br/>
attacked.<br/>

That is terrible.  And I bet you never said one bad thing about Calvert.  <br/>
Even though the homeschool group I am with here is very &quot;school at home&quot; they <br/>
know we unschool and never say one bad word about it even though I know they <br/>
don&#39;t agree.  We just agree that we disagree about how to &quot;educate&quot; out children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137541508">YOU AND OTHER UNSCHOOLERS ARE JUST WHAT I LOVE ABOUT UNSCHOOLING.  WE GIVE <br/>
EVERYONE THE RIGHT TO DO AS THEY PLEASE.<br/>
I HAVE NOTICED TIME AND AGAIN THAT &quot;THEY&quot; DON&#39;T RETURN THE FAVOR.<br/>
UNSCHOOLING IS  A LIFE PHILOSOPHY THAT WE ALL SHARE AND I HOPE OUR KIDS GROW <br/>
WITH OUR AT ATITUDES.<br/>
I LOVE UNSCHOOLING AND UNSCHOOLERS<br/>
MAYBE THE CBS SHOW  REFLECTS A  THREAT THAT WE POSE THE THE POLITICALLY <br/>
CORRECT &quot; PUBLIC SYSTEM OR GOVERMENT SCHOOLS&quot;  THAT ARE SO OBVIOUSLY FAILING. <br/>

Yes, that is true.  No one has ever been &quot;nasty&quot; to me with thier thoughts or <br/>
opinions about unschooling.  Folks do ask a lot of questions, and they <br/>
usually don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.. but they are not openly hostile about it... LOL.    Of <br/>
course, all of this behavior is to our faces, sooo, who knows what they say behind <br/>
our backs.. Then again, Pam and I usually have our rake handy when the school <br/>
at homers are not within earshot.. LOL. (you know, to rake them over the <br/>
coals...)<br/>

&quot;Guys&quot; you said.<br/>
It&#39;s amazing how many men are telling women and children what to do in the <br/>
Christian Homeschooling corner.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What gives them the right to be so smug and superior, <br/>
anyway?  I like to think that I&#39;m a LOT more tolerant of those who are <br/>

<br/>
Tolerance isn&#39;t a fundamentalist-Christian virtue.<br/>
Hate the sin, love the sinner (IF there&#39;s a chance he&#39;ll convert).<br/>
And LOTS of things are sin for them.  Rock&#39;n&#39;roll.  Most bodily functions.<br/>
<br/>
-=- It&#39;s just hard to stay cool and collected when I&#39;m <br/>

<br/>
I just remind myself that I can&#39;t change them and they can&#39;t change me.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been one them, and they might never be where I am, so I&#39;m ahead of the game. <br/>
<br/>
I just try to shield my kids from their nonsense to some extent.<br/>
