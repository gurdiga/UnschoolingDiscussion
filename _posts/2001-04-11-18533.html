<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204091882">Welcome, Anna. The only thing I can say about Montessori is this ...<br/>
<br/>
When my children were very small, I went to an introductory meeting at <br/>
the local Montessori school. The director said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The children carry mats [small carpets samples, they were!] around <br/>
with them and when they approach another child to play, they must say, <br/>
&#39;can I play with you?&#39; and the other child must say, &#39;yes, you may&#39; <br/>
BEFORE they are allowed put their mat down next to the child. While <br/>
they are playing on the floor, they must stay on the mat. They are not <br/>
allowed to sit on the floor without sitting on their mat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was flabbergasted and ran for the door as quickly as possible and <br/>
never looked back. It sends shivers up and down my spine to think <br/>
about it today ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853676368">I have not had my girls go to a montessori school, but I did know a few others<br/>
that did. One family had 2 boys. The first boy survived a year but then hated it<br/>
so much that his parents took him out. Their second child loved it and wished to<br/>
stay.  I know another family with a young boy that was looking into it, but<br/>
chose not to because it was too restrictive as well. Not sure if this helps or<br/>
not.</div>

Does Montessori specialize in multiples?  (I doubt it.)<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t pay big bucks to ANYONE if you were planning to homeschool and <br/>
especially if you&#39;re interested in unschooling.  Every school experience <br/>
(even Montessori) has to be undone for unschooling to be successful, in my <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
My kids never went to Montessori.  One of their friends did, and it was <br/>
school to the max for him, because his difficulties with school had to do <br/>
with his wanting to be alone more and work slowly, but at Montessori, it was <br/>
&quot;Cooperate!&quot;  &quot;Finish task!&quot; &quot;Smile!&quot; and that direction (not just of <br/>
activity, but of attitude) was oppressive for him.<br/>
<br/>
So this is indirect, as to Montessori specifics.<br/>
<br/>
I shared custody, at a young age, of two kids who were driven to another town <br/>
daily for Montessori (I usually didn&#39;t have to do the driving) and they <br/>
weren&#39;t crazy about it.  They seemed relieved when I asked if they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
just like to go to the local public school instead.  (Don&#39;t I wish I&#39;d been <br/>
willing/able/aware enough to homeschool then!!!)<br/>
<br/>
I see benefits of my own children&#39;s total lack of school.<br/>

You know, this is not the impression I have of Montessori, maybe <br/>
it&#39;s been interpreted differently in the US to over here.  I though <br/>
the point was to keep things child-size but &#39;real&#39; so you might have <br/>
smaller pots and pans and brushes and stuff...  But I never <br/>
thought there was pressure either in time or to &#39;perform&#39; in a <br/>
certain way, apart from a general expectation of fair-play and co-<br/>
operation (this seems to be the one thing &#39;taught&#39; from what I <br/>
know) with everyone else.  I haven&#39;t read any of MM&#39;s work, nor <br/>
have I seen a Montessori school, but I&#39;ve seen different bits and <br/>
bobs in different books, particularly to do with running community <br/>
preschools (playgroups in the UK, I believe this is a slightly <br/>
different thing &#39;over there.&#39;)  I just can&#39;t see that MM would be <br/>
happy to see her name used for something so coercive!<br/>

A friend of mine worked in a Montessori school and trained to be a<br/>
teacher.  She told me that many of the schools are not TRUE Montessori. <br/>
The theory is supposed to be very unschoolish but the majority she has<br/>
seen, including the one she worked in, are basically just pre-schools<br/>
with very little resemblance to anything Montessori.<br/>
<br/>
She advised me to tell anyone considering a Montessori because of the<br/>
theory to be very careful.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The theory is supposed to be very unschoolish  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, but in other ways there are DEFINITE rules and principles.  The <br/>
alphabet is to be studied first through touch--letters made of sandpaper, or <br/>
lately of the soft foam-stuff that they make puzzles of sometimes.  Toy <br/>
dishes are washed &quot;the right way&quot; and things are swept up with kid-sized <br/>
brooms and such.  There is quite a structure to it.<br/>
<br/>
And when people pay big money, it&#39;s not going to be okay with them for kids <br/>
to have choices which don&#39;t eventually even out to them having chosen things <br/>
from all activity areas, so there are checklists and once kids have made free <br/>
choices, the pool of available things to choose from gets smaller and smaller <br/>
until the checklist is fulfilled (from what I&#39;ve read and seen, which could <br/>
be wrong, or not mainstream).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing, as pre-school goes (or early elementary), but <br/>
I think it&#39;s for sure still school and could do some of the undermining of <br/>
unschooling that any school can do.  <br/>

Ewwww, people just can&#39;t resist regimenting learning.  What is it about<br/>
the freedom of childhood that makes everyone so nervous?<br/>
<br/>
My friend who studied to be a Montessori teacher said that this kind of<br/>
structure was NOT correct.  Perhaps she was taught by a closet<br/>
unschooler. LOL  She stated that any attempts to structure the child&#39;s<br/>
exploration was not good.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, she became so disgusted with ANY thought of school that<br/>
she is home schooling now.  I&#39;ve given her a lot of information on<br/>
unschooling and it seems to be a direction she is open to.  Her main<br/>
obstacle will be her natural bent to control and organize life in<br/>
general.<br/>
