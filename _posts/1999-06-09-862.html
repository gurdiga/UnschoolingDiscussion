&gt;      Forrest Gump is a book also. I started reading it a couple years ago<br/>
&gt;after I saw the movie, but I gave up on it. The movie was wonderful, IMO. I<br/>
&gt;think Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, so there is a book. Maybe I&#39;ll read it sometime -- although I&quot;m not sure<br/>
how much better it could be than the movie! :) I agree that Tom Hanks is a<br/>
brilliant actor -- he&#39;s got to be one of my favorites! :_) ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>
