&lt;&lt; Count me in with the non-makeup wearing mamas.  No nail polish either,<br/>
 on fingers nor toes.  I grew up believing that women &quot;had&quot; to wear<br/>
 makeup and I wore it through high school. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See, and I wasn&#39;t allowed to. It was &quot;wordly&quot; and sinful.<br/>
So look at me now!! I use my face as a canvas for the most colorful, artful <br/>
stuff I can come up with (ok, some days I go more natural).<br/>
I like colorful streaks in my hair and tend to the funky side of makeup.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a reaction to over control at this point. It&#39;s just ME. I am an <br/>
artist. I LOVE color and funk and all things artsy. So it makes sense that <br/>
I&#39;d extend it to my body. :)<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
