<br/>
Have you been to a LEARN meeting? LEARN is the Kansas City&#39;s area&#39;s secular homeschool group. We meet the third Monday of each month at All Souls Unitarian Church, 4500 Warwick, Kansas City. The group is very open and has a large number of unschoolers.  I would love to see you there! Email me off-list for more info.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-176626126">Sorry everyone, but I have to bring up games again.  I am taking a big step - I am<br/>
<br/>
 going to go out and get some sort of video/electronic game for my son.  It is one of <br/>
<br/>
his passions but of course I havn&#39;t let him delve into it yet because I used to always <br/>
<br/>
say &quot;we will never have a Nintendo!&quot;.  Well...here I am...I would really appreciate any <br/>
<br/>
help from you that know these games.  I&#39;m wondering which ones are the best to <br/>
<br/>
buy?  He would like Game Boy Advance or any Nintendo or Playstation.  Does<br/>
<br/>
 anyone know if there are ratings anywhere like maybe Consumer Report on <br/>
<br/>
games?  Am I being stupid?  I guess I just want to make sure I&#39;m not spending alot <br/>
<br/>
of money on something that is going to become obsolete or even broken in a few<br/>
<br/>
months.  <br/>
<br/>
My son, 9y, has been researching on E-bay different things, I am also illiterate on <br/>
<br/>
that,  seems to be some good deals, but so much to chose from!<br/>
<br/>
If any of you would just by one big system and one small system which ones would<br/>
<br/>
 you buy?  Like,  which one for TV and which hand held?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help and for putting up with my rambling.<br/>
<br/>
And my computer abilities, I don&#39;t know what this will look like, trying new things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why not have *him* tell you :-) He&#39;ll do the research and love doing it. How<br/>
powerful is that?<br/>
<br/>
But, as some input from personal experience, Nintendo tends to lean towards<br/>
games for the non-Mature audience. That does&#39;t mean childish. It means games<br/>
without graphic violence and sexuality. They do have a fair number of titles<br/>
for mature players (like Resident Evil) now that the GameCube came out but<br/>
their foundation is the Pokemon/Mario/Zelda/Donkey Kong/Sonic type games.<br/>
(And those are exclusive to the Nintendo.)<br/>
<br/>
The Playstation has a &quot;stable&quot; of characters too (Spyro, Digimon are the<br/>
ones my daughter came up with) but they aren&#39;t as overwhelmingly popular.<br/>
But they do have some very popular games like Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy<br/>
that aren&#39;t availble on Nintendo but, those are Teen titles.) She said the<br/>
one advantage of the Playstation 2 is that it plays the Playstation 1 games<br/>
too. The Nintendo consoles never play the previous console version games.<br/>
<br/>
As for handhelds, my daughter doesn&#39;t see a huge difference between the<br/>
GameBoy Color and the GameBoy Advance (GBA) but says most new games will<br/>
only be for the GBA and the GBA does play all the games made for the older<br/>
handhelds too. She knows the GBA can hook up to the GameCube (with a cable)<br/>
but she&#39;s not sure if the GameBoy Color will hook up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634854933">Kelli,  <br/>
I don&#39;t know much about these systems either.  But my ds (10 yrs.) <br/>
has Sega, Nintendo 64 and a Playstation.  He seems to like the <br/>
Playstation best.  He likes the choice of games there is for him to <br/>
play.  The difference between a PS and a PS2 is that it has better <br/>
graphics, plays both PS2 and PS games and has a mod chip that you can <br/>
plug into the back to play copied games. (according to him--he&#39;s <br/>
talking faster than I can write).<br/>
<br/>
A mod chip is a computer chip that lets you play games that you have <br/>
burned or copied over from another cd source.  For example, we bring <br/>
home library games and burn the game onto a new CD if we like it and <br/>
want to keep it.  (You kinda got to get around the ethic part of it: <br/>
i.e. is that stealing?)<br/>
<br/>
A Playstation has that capability if you solder the chip on.  A PS2 <br/>
has that capability by plugging the chip in.<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo 64 is worse than a playstation (according to my son).<br/>
<br/>
We have a old Sega system.<br/>
<br/>
The new ones are good I guess.  He got one for Christmas but <br/>
something was wrong and we took it back.  And we haven&#39;t replaced it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is some help.<br/>
<br/>
You can always email us off line if your son wants to talk to mine.<br/>

I do need to get more of his input,   now I&#39;m just trying to figure out if I just go out and buy it or if I wait until Christmas to give it to him.  That&#39;s what my parents would have done, waited until Christmas, but don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what I want to do!  <br/>

company here).  You can try out virtually any game and any system.  And <br/>
you can buy systems and games used, for less money.  Talk to the <br/>
employees there.  My son will say that x is better because you can get <br/>
these kinds of games, or there&#39;s more variety, or whatever.  But if <br/>
you&#39;d try<br/>
<br/>
My older sons have moved on to mostly computer games now.  So, we don&#39;t <br/>
have a PS II or an X-Box, but we have all the ones from Atari til those. <br/>
 The old standbys are what get played the most.  Mario.  On Super <br/>
Nintendo or N-64.  Donkey Kong on N-64.  If your son likes sports, then <br/>
use those games as your guide.  Some of those sports games are <br/>
unbelievably real these days.  Of course, those realistic games come on <br/>
the newer more expensive systems.  My little one still has fun with <br/>
baseball on Super Nintendo, though.  <br/>
<br/>
And you can rent games at video stores, too.<br/>

I think a Nintendo 64 (N64) would be a good deal, if you can get one new.  <br/>
The joystick on the controller is the only fragile thing.  Just don&#39;t throw <br/>
them down or step on them.<br/>
<br/>
If you get a system back from the newest, you can often find good games, used.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are asleep, or I&#39;d get one to recite recommendations, but I remember <br/>
they being excited about Zelda (Ocarina of Time?), Banjo Kazooie, Mario Kart <br/>
and Kirby&#39;s Dreamland (Maybe...).<br/>
<br/>
All my kids have played a fair amount of Gameboy.  Gameboy Advance plays the <br/>
old games and the color-gameboy games, and the newer Gameboy Advance games <br/>
all.  And those can be purchased used too.<br/>
<br/>
Playstation uses CDs which makes the media more fragile than the plastic <br/>
cartridges Nintendos use.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember whether N64 needs memory cards.  IF you get a system needing <br/>
a memory card, get one right away.  For Game Cube and PSII, you can&#39;t play <br/>
the games without one.  <br/>
<br/>
Before you bring the game home, see if you need any special cords to hook it <br/>
up.  If you know a gaming-older-boy, maybe borrow him as a consultant.  Get <br/>
him to look at your TV&#39;s input situation and see if you&#39;ll need something <br/>
extra or not, and take him with you to the store (or online with you &lt;g&gt;) to <br/>
ask and answer questions.  <br/>
<br/>
For a major system, count on another hundred dollars over the system price <br/>
for memory card, extra controller and whatever else.  (unless you&#39;re buying <br/>
used, then just the card and maybe the cord).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346184818">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
My son is a little older now, 12, and we have most of the older <br/>
systems (not the new Playstation II or X-box or Game Cube).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would say that in general they are all good systems.  If you are <br/>
going for the &quot;newest&quot; my son would probably say go with Playstation <br/>
or X-box (whichever caries the most games your son would like). My <br/>
son doesn&#39;t care much for the Nintendo Gamecube at all.  <br/>
<br/>
As for hand-held systems, Gameboy Advance is the best.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest you make a list of what types of games he would <br/>
like to play, see who makes the most of those games and appropriate <br/>
for his age now and within the next couple of years.  <br/>
<br/>
You can also go to one of those used game stores and see what you <br/>
like there.  They have great deals, especially on some of the older <br/>
systems like Nintendo 64 and regular Playstation.<br/>
<br/>
Let your son help decide what he would like.  Contrary to what many <br/>
people believe, video games are not all bad.  They teach not only <br/>
hand/eye coordination, but logic, strategy, role playing, etc. --- <br/>
depends on what games you buy.  I don&#39;t allow any games that are <br/>
really violent.  Of course, my son mostly likes car and racing games, <br/>
crashes, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck in your choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713526852">I&#39;m not big on video games on the TV at all. Don&#39;t play them and don&#39;t <br/>
really like them much. My husband is the big kid and we did have some <br/>
Nintendo thing but now it&#39;s Playstation and my husband and kids seem to like <br/>
it better. Of course there are all kind of games with that from sports stuff <br/>
to some really violent things so you have to do your homework. Usually you <br/>
can tell just from looking at the cover.<br/>
<br/>
Both our middle kids do have the gameboy advanced and love it. I do too as <br/>
the games for this usually seem more entertaining and thought provoking than <br/>
violent. I&#39;ve been known to try and grab a game of alley way or tetris or <br/>
even Looney Tunes myself!!! Plus they come in handy when waits are <br/>
inevitable whether it&#39;s a long trip or just visiting relatives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657387426">Hi there,<br/>
Our family also resisted the electronic game craze for years before finally<br/>
buying an X-Box this past Christmas. It has been fun, but I&#39;ve had to make<br/>
some rules about usage. (We have a timer on our T.V., It can&#39;t be turned on<br/>
during daylight hours.) You can find out about the various games in the game<br/>
magazines. You should be able to find these in any Target, Walmart, etc.<br/>
We&#39;ve found it useful to rent before we buy so we don&#39;t waste money on games<br/>
that are boring. Hope this helps some!<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Nintendo/electronic games, again<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry everyone, but I have to bring up games again.  I am taking a big<br/>
step - I am<br/>
<br/>
 going to go out and get some sort of video/electronic game for my son.  It<br/>
is one of<br/>
<br/>
his passions but of course I havn&#39;t let him delve into it yet because I used<br/>
to always<br/>
<br/>
say &quot;we will never have a Nintendo!&quot;.  Well...here I am...I would really<br/>
appreciate any<br/>
<br/>
help from you that know these games.  I&#39;m wondering which ones are the best<br/>
to<br/>
<br/>
buy?  He would like Game Boy Advance or any Nintendo or Playstation.  Does<br/>
<br/>
 anyone know if there are ratings anywhere like maybe Consumer Report on<br/>
<br/>
games?  Am I being stupid?  I guess I just want to make sure I&#39;m not<br/>
spending alot<br/>
<br/>
of money on something that is going to become obsolete or even broken in a<br/>
few<br/>
<br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
My son, 9y, has been researching on E-bay different things, I am also<br/>
illiterate on<br/>
<br/>
that,  seems to be some good deals, but so much to chose from!<br/>
<br/>
If any of you would just by one big system and one small system which ones<br/>
would<br/>
<br/>
 you buy?  Like,  which one for TV and which hand held?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help and for putting up with my rambling.<br/>
<br/>
And my computer abilities, I don&#39;t know what this will look like, trying new<br/>
things.<br/>

Close your eyes. Open your heart. Trust your children. Enjoy yourselves. <br/>

children fall and stumble and grow and run and fly and laugh and........ And <br/>
you will too. <br/>

After you&#39;ve REALLY taken the leap, it&#39;s time to enjoy the flight. RELAX!<br/>

time? Are there shows on during the day that you don&#39;t like or do you think <br/>
they should be out doing things? That timer idea would actually be <br/>
conterproductive for Conor. He does most of his reading and thinking and <br/>

screwed up.<br/>
<br/>
What other kinds of rules do you have for the video games? Believe it or <br/>
not, Conor can play his PS2 anytime he wants. He doesn&#39;t play it all the <br/>
time. Some times he goes for weeks without touching it. Right now he&#39;s much <br/>
more interested in D&D and this Physicus game he got for the computer. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275729962">My husband says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When it comes to portable Gameboy Advance is the way to go. When it<br/>
comes down to home the debate rages on between the three major systems -<br/>
X-box (Microsoft), Playstation 2 (Sony), and GameCube (Nintendo).<br/>
<br/>
X-Box is the most powerful amongst the three, hardware wise. It is also<br/>
easily used as a DVD player ($20 upgrade) and a CD music player. In our<br/>
house the X-box is used more as a DVD player than anything else. I<br/>
believe that the X-box has the most long term potential of the three<br/>
systems at the moment, however it also has the fewest games available.<br/>
X-box has parental controls that can be set for games and movies. You<br/>
can limit the game content played, based on the ASRB rating level.<br/>
<br/>
Sony Playstation 2 - the defacto standard in home video game machines,<br/>
with 100&#39;s of games available and millions of users around the world.<br/>
The X-box is substantially more powerful in terms of its graphics<br/>
rendering. Playstation requires memory cards for gamesaving - the X-Box<br/>
does not.<br/>
<br/>
GameCube is less expensive, has a smaller user base than the Playstation<br/>
and has more games than the X-box, and no ability to play DVD&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
My Ratings:-<br/>
<br/>
First choice: X-Box<br/>
2nd: Sony Playstation<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree too (for the most part) If you want the graphics then X-box is the <br/>
way to go. However the X-Box requires an upgrade to become a CD/DVD player <br/>
and the PS2 has it all built in. The PS2 has portals for future add on&#39;s as <br/>
well. To me, it is a toss up between the two, and I doubt we would even <br/>
consider the Game Cube. <br/>
If its games you want, go for the PS2. If its graphics, go for the X-Box. If <br/>
your family doesn&#39;t care and it is up to you and a deciding feature is the <br/>
ability to play DVD&#39;s (nice cause you don&#39;t have to go out and spend another <br/>
$200 for a DVD player) then I would flip a coin over the two. Although if you <br/>
got the PS2, you could save the $20 upgrade needed for the X-Box and buy a <br/>
game. (although most run for about $40. But I did get the new Tetris Worlds <br/>
for $20 the other day. &lt;g&gt;) <br/>

priced WAY to low to get rid of them).  What I have learned in my &quot;gaming<br/>
research&quot; is that each system has it&#39;s TOP games.<br/>
<br/>
I intend to buy another system within a few months, either Playstation or<br/>
Game Cube.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the two Zelda games for N64 but<br/>
there are games for other systems that I want to play.  In the end we<br/>
will have several systems around the house and the kids can pick and<br/>
choose by the games they are currently interested in.<br/>
<br/>
The system which seems to have the widest selection of games is<br/>
Playstation but I&#39;m sure there are fans of other systems which would<br/>
disagree.  The benefit of a Playstation is that it can be used to play<br/>
DVD as well.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It has been fun, but I&#39;ve had to make some rules about usage. (We have a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this a timer you&#39;ve put on? Do you adjust the timer for daylight savings<br/>
time? Are there shows on during the day that you don&#39;t like or do you think<br/>
they should be out doing things? That timer idea would actually be<br/>
conterproductive for Conor. He does most of his reading and thinking and<br/>
creating at night. If that was the only time he could watch TV, he&#39;d be all<br/>
screwed up.<br/>
<br/>
What other kinds of rules do you have for the video games? Believe it or<br/>
not, Conor can play his PS2 anytime he wants. He doesn&#39;t play it all the<br/>
time. Some times he goes for weeks without touching it. Right now he&#39;s much<br/>
more interested in D&D and this Physicus game he got for the computer.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Yes, it&#39;s a timer that won&#39;t let you turn the T.V. on. The daytime thing is<br/>
just what we came up with to limit their playing/watching time. We can<br/>
override it any time we want, which is often, or they ask us to. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it can&#39;t be overridden...<br/>
then it&#39;s a timer that won&#39;t let little kids turn the TV on.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It&#39;s hard to get rid of the idea of school as I grew up with..&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes just paying attention to the language I chose to use made a big <br/>
difference in my thinking.  There are ways people have to justify things by <br/>
using traditional phrases and idioms without really thinking about what the <br/>
words mean.<br/>
<br/>
For a not-so-related example, pregnant women often say things like &quot;My doctor <br/>
says it&#39;s okay for me to...&quot;  or &quot;My doctor says I can&#39;t...&quot;  or &quot;My doctor <br/>
won&#39;t let me...&quot;  And language becomes truth.  If the mom waits for the <br/>
doctor&#39;s advice and takes it as though he owns her and the baby, he IS in <br/>
control.  But he doesn&#39;t actually own her and the baby.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes parents use language that separates them from the children in <br/>
some profound ways.  Unschooling seems to work best the closer families can <br/>
be to being groups of individual humans instead of one or two adults and then <br/>
&quot;them,&quot; the kids.  When families say &quot;We decided&quot; do they mean the parents?  <br/>
Or the family decided?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth thinking about.<br/>
