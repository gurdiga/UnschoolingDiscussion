<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453321786">Okay, hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry I have missed the last two weeks.  My modem was hit by lightening <br/>
through the phone line and it took the company forever to finish it.  <br/>
Luckily, under warranty, but I lost a lot of computer time.  I had sever <br/>
withdraws...lol....I was unsure what to do with the extra time.  Never fear I <br/>
found tons to do.  I just got it back last night.  When I opened my e-mail at <br/>
had exactly 1,000 messages, so needless to say, I had to hit the delete <br/>
button alot.<br/>
<br/>
  I am sorry I misses  the passionate discussions.  I have missed chatting <br/>
with you, all and I am thrilled to be back connected to the world and my <br/>
e-mail buddies.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>
