<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572697893">I&#39;ve been having a difficult few weeks, what with taxes and trying to get<br/>
a loan, my husband out of work, then starting a new job with tons of<br/>
paperwork to fill out, his mood not his usual gregarious, and adjusting<br/>
to his new schedule.  But I am starting to come out of it.  I went<br/>
several times with no sleep, complete insomnia, probably from<br/>
internalizing all my worrying.  That was almost like working graveyard<br/>
again:(    So, I don&#39;t feel I&#39;ve been giving my children the attention I<br/>
normally do.  On the other hand, unschooling has come through again.  <br/>
My son Rex has done nothing but read books non stop, one after the other,<br/>
from morning to night!  And he always avoided books when he was going to<br/>
ps.  <br/>
My son Caleb has been playing a lot of chess, monopoly, yahtzee and<br/>
building games with his younger siblings, as well as watching a lot of<br/>
educational public television.  He is the one who usually loves to read. <br/>
He has been coming up with new jokes every day.  He wants to make movies<br/>
when he grows up, preferably comedies.  <br/>
My son Seth is a theorist who is always testing and figuring out how the<br/>
universe works.  He looks sort of like a mad scientist.  He talks my ear<br/>
off with his ideas.  He has been writing letters to others, addressing<br/>
and stamping the envelopes and mailing them.  He asks me to correct his<br/>
spelling, then he rewrites them.  At bedtime he has been reading books<br/>
until quite late.  <br/>
My daughter Phoebe, in addition to playing boardgames, has been reading<br/>
and making books.  She has a book she made called How I Feel.  Whenever<br/>
there is a trying time in her young life, she writes in it.  She feels<br/>
the stress we&#39;ve been under lately.  She taught herself cursive, and<br/>
writes a lot for the family, like shopping lists and our daily plan. <br/>
(Every morning we talk about what we want to do and then make a list so<br/>
no one gets overlooked.)  It amazes me how well she spells.  She just<br/>
asks me if she doesn&#39;t know, and I tell her.  She often emails her aunt<br/>
and grandma who live out of state.  Using spell check has helped her<br/>
spelling, too, I suppose.  Somehow, I don&#39;t know how, because she<br/>
absolutely doesn&#39;t want me to teach her math and she never breaks out the<br/>
math workbooks, but she already knows almost as much as her older<br/>
brothers do.  Maybe because of the boardgames, and maybe because of<br/>
playing with the calculator.  But at the beginning of the year, she hated<br/>
numbers and avoided math like the plague.  Now she can keep up with her<br/>
brothers who are two and four years older than her when they try to<br/>
figure out how much things will cost or how many things there are to<br/>
split between them.  She still only uses the bedroom clock because she<br/>
hasn&#39;t memorized the hand clock and thinks it&#39;s a waste of time to count<br/>
by fives when she can just run into my room and read the digital.  <br/>
My kids are all very sociable and have felt lonely lately, since I&#39;ve had<br/>
my head in paperwork and not taken them on as many outings as is usual<br/>
for us.  We live in a trailer park full of kids, but most of the neighbor<br/>
kids are grounded lately. My older ones aren&#39;t interested in going to<br/>
teen center anymore because, they say, the kids there only care about<br/>
telling dirty jokes, cussing and looking good.  I told my son Rex that if<br/>
he goes for a walk he will run into some kids his age.  I said that is<br/>
what I used to do when I was young, and how I met some of my best<br/>
friends.  I hope that is not too lame.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LAME?? Good Lord Bonni with all of that on your plate (I can relate because <br/>
my plate is stacked in buffet style portions for a death row inmate) your <br/>
kids&#39; schooling is just the way I&#39;ve learned homeschooling to be for us.  She <br/>
pretty much does most of it on her own.  Some people wonder how much time it <br/>
takes and when I say &quot;30 minutes to 4 hours&quot; they can&#39;t believe it. The four <br/>
hour ones are usually when we go somewhere specific for that time (museum, <br/>
performance, etc.)<br/>
Kelli has been devouring every resource she can in order to work with <br/>
animals. Last week she called vets and asked them some prepared questions. <br/>
She&#39;s very articulate and I&#39;m proud of her for that.  We arranged an hour <br/>
long visit at the animal hospital where a vet showed her the animals there <br/>
and described what their status was, problems they had and how some could <br/>
have been prevented. She wants to start pet-sitting and today she exhausted <br/>
me with that!  We called other pet sitting businesses and she got ahold of <br/>
two women that talked to her for awhile about the business and what she could <br/>
and shouldn&#39;t do, what to charge, what they did, etc.  She took notes and I <br/>
typed them right after the call.  Took us a lot of dials to make connections <br/>
(I guess they were all out pet sitting dangit!)  She asked me to draft an <br/>
advertisement flyer on the computer (I had been promising it for awhile) <br/>
since she hasn&#39;t learned all the tricks and tools of MSWord and her typing <br/>
isn&#39;t so hot. She&#39;s using Mavis Beacon to learn home row and the right <br/>
reaches so she can type instead of writing some day. I guess that&#39;s one area <br/>
that I need to be more consistent in requiring her to do, she wants to write <br/>
so much but gets frustrated at how sore her hands get. Being a writer myself <br/>
I can relate so I want her so much to get typing skills, but its going to be <br/>
at her own speed - you can&#39;t FORCE that at all =)<br/>
She&#39;s spent time this afternoon going to talk to neighbors with animals and <br/>
giving a couple of the flyers out, desperately hoping for a job!!  We talked <br/>
about volunteering and called the places and left messages.  Being 10 and <br/>
DYING TO WORK WITH ANIMALS is hard on her. We have two kitties and they are <br/>
old hat by now =/ LOL<br/>
She&#39;s been devouring her Chicken Soup For the Pet Lover&#39;s Soul, a book of Cat <br/>
Stories by Herriott (great vet and author), and I&#39;m reading aloud one of the <br/>
&quot;All things Wise and Wonderful&quot; books (he&#39;s written a few.)  <br/>
I guess you could say we are just animals animals animals here and that&#39;s all <br/>
that is on the brain!<br/>
We didn&#39;t use a textbook today, although if I find an ANIMAL reading <br/>
comprehension story in her book I&#39;ll bet she&#39;d do it Hehehehehehe  Same thing <br/>
with an ANIMAL math problem.  <br/>
Our day...today...very enjoyable and very focused!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29729055">We just got back from the beach and had a long discussion on the way back<br/>
about how people treat their animals.  We took Tuff E (our newest 4 legged<br/>
family member) and another puppy (older, about 6 months) came running up and<br/>
half cowering.  It wouldn&#39;t go back to the owners when they called it.<br/>
Youngest kidlet got it to chase her down the beach and back to the owners.<br/>
The woman immediately grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and drug it to<br/>
the man who clipped it up along side the head.<br/>
<br/>
We then discussed that that sort of treatment is what causes so many pit<br/>
bulls, pit bull types and pit bull crosses to be mean.<br/>
<br/>
When we got home they did a net search to find out what other breeds had<br/>
been declared &quot;evil&quot; before and which actually had the most bite cases.<br/>
<br/>
Now they are off riding their bicycles and have declared tomorrow to be<br/>
clean the attic day which translates into &quot;we want to find the water stuff<br/>
because it is almost time to head up to the lakes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today eldest was explaining geometry and physics to a kid who goes<br/>
to the local high school.  They headed over to a friend&#39;s house to use the<br/>
pool table to show the relationship between angles and force and which way a<br/>
ball will travel.<br/>

My boys type very fast.  We have typing programs, and they&#39;ve played around <br/>
with them, but I never required it, and they&#39;re not really typing &quot;by the <br/>
book,&quot; necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby bought a computer, and gathered components from here and there.  A <br/>
friend gave him a keyboard which is split and angled, with the left hand keys <br/>
totally separate from the right.  I asked him if that was going to be a <br/>
problem, and he said no.  It&#39;s not.  He&#39;s still zipping along.  I&#39;m wondering <br/>
whether it would be a problem for me, and I learned &quot;right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think requiring it will not be a benefit.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Some people wonder how much time it <br/>
takes and when I say &quot;30 minutes to 4 hours&quot; they can&#39;t believe it. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I bet she learns the rest of the day too.<br/>

piece of your state in our harbor, the Lady Washington.  Wish we had the<br/>
money to take a trip on her but for five it would cost over $200.<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets have started more learning adventures from a day at the beach<br/>
than anyother thing we&#39;ve done, I swear.  And, besides they just love the<br/>
freedom of running in the wind.  One of our favorite things to do is to go<br/>
out there when there is a high wind and stand on a dune and lean on the<br/>
wind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-315829189">Rosie (11) had one friend stay overnight and another come over early this <br/>
morning - they worked on making a newspaper called Dumbledore&#39;s Pride. It has <br/>
a wordsearch and some articles that they wrote - they are made-up stories <br/>
about things that might have happened at Hogwarts. The newspaper is 5 pages <br/>
long and they printed up a half-dozen copies to give out to people at our <br/>
park day. I had nothing to do with it other than eavesdropping a little, just <br/>
because we were in the same room, and helping them with the printer, which <br/>
wasn&#39;t cooperating.<br/>
<br/>
Roya (17) went to work (she commutes with my dh) at 7 this morning. She works <br/>
at Laguna Clay Company - one of the largest manufacturers of clay and glazes. <br/>
She works in the office part of the time, typing up orders, etc., and in the <br/>
retail store part of the time. Ceramics is her passion - she&#39;s been involved <br/>
with a ceramics studio for about 4 years and she will be minoring in ceramics <br/>
and majoring in creative writing when she transfers from the community <br/>
college to UC Santa Cruz.  She came home from work and spent some hours <br/>
working on a website, creating collages out of pictures of friends, and also <br/>
printed up some stationary with pictures of friends along the edges. She and <br/>
her dad went to a bookstore and bought some sort of feminist book, as she <br/>
described it, but I haven&#39;t seen it yet so I&#39;m not sure what it is. <br/>
<br/>
Cyrus (my dh) took Roya to work and went to his work and picked Roya up early <br/>
and went to an optometrist appointment. Then he came home and worked on our <br/>
taxes and took Roya to the bookstore. Judging from the dirty dishes in the <br/>
kitchen, he concocted something from rice-a-roni and eggs and I think he also <br/>
watched a soccer game that he&#39;d taped from this morning.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana (14) was staying overnight at her friend&#39;s house. They met Rosie and <br/>
me and her friends at the park around 1 and the kids all played in the park <br/>
for the afternoon while the moms and dads talked. I left around 4 with <br/>
Roxana; Rosie stayed with friends at the park. <br/>
<br/>
Roxana and I went to the Los Angeles Music Center (about 30 minutes from us) <br/>
to see the LA Opera perform The Magic Flute. I&#39;d never seen it and didn&#39;t <br/>
know anything about it and I can now report that it was the GOOFIEST thing <br/>
I&#39;ve ever seen &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
DH and Roya were asleep when we got home around midnight, Rosie was watching <br/>
the Cosby Show on the couch but fell asleep within minutes of us getting <br/>
home. Rox and I heated up some canned baked beans and she&#39;s reading an Agatha <br/>
Christie book while I&#39;m online.<br/>

&gt;Somebody asked me this lately - this was someone who KNOWS about how we live<br/>
&gt;and that we don&#39;t do school, but had a momentary lapse. I laughed and said,<br/>
&gt;&quot;Well, luckily, none of us spent any time in a coma today, so we didn&#39;t miss<br/>
&gt;a minute.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like that one.  I often say, &quot;none of my time and all of my time.&quot;  Since <br/>
we don&#39;t ever (anymore) &quot;do school&quot;, it doesn&#39;t take any of my time.  But <br/>
I&#39;m always on duty in the sense of observing, listening, keeping an eye out <br/>
for interesting resources, helping when asked, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son had his first paying job when he was 4.  He was with his dad cutting <br/>
up firewood at a constuction site.  The drywallers asked if he wanted to <br/>
make some cash cleaning up after them.  He wouldn&#39;t stop until he had <br/>
finished the job to *his* satisfaction.  Around the same time, they came <br/>
home with a load of firewood.  Dh backed the truck into the yard and then <br/>
went off briefly to do something else.  When he came back, Lars had almost <br/>
the whole load off the truck.  That was when I knew I didn&#39;t need to worry <br/>
about his being able to make some kind of a living.  He has saved us <br/>
service calls for appliances a few times by insisting on having a look <br/>
first.  Kids love to do useful things.<br/>
