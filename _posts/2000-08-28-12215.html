&lt;&lt;The other day he watched 5 videos in a row and I was panic stricken <br/>
that he&#39;d never get up from in front of the television.  He was watching <br/>
about elephants in africa, austrialia and the great barrier reef, madeline <br/>
and winnie the pooh, then back onto a gorilla tape.... So I have to ask <br/>
myself... Would I be this concerned and gripped if he were sitting at the <br/>
kitchen table with math school books for 5 hours... No of course not... I <br/>
think I had to deschool myself first and accept that this was going to be ok <br/>
no matter what.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  We have some video viewing jags here.<br/>
<br/>
I think the one-hour a day recommendations for TV viewing are aimed at kids <br/>
who have already spent 6 hours listening to a teacher lecture.  I think of <br/>
much of the TV that we watch here as a substitute for that classroom sitting <br/>
time.  (LOL -- we are getting our &quot;seatwork&quot; done.)  We&#39;re watching mostly <br/>
PBS stuff.<br/>
