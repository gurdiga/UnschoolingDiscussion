<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090549739">hi sus,<br/>
<br/>
we live in c.tx, my dh&#39;s parents are in n.ca and mine are in e.pa - it&#39;s a<br/>
good 3 to 4 day drive to either set of grandparents.  my dh and i were in<br/>
n.ca when we got together and moved to tx about a year later.  when i first<br/>
got pregnant i literally freaked out because i thought my dh&#39;s parent would<br/>
try and take my son because i&#39;m so different from them.  it was a lot of<br/>
stress but now that we&#39;ve moved, (it&#39;s been nearly 5 years though i still<br/>
love and miss n.ca), - which did not go over big at all - , things are much<br/>
better and we have a lot more privacy to make our way without constant<br/>
scrutiny (dh family are all big ps supports - ex teaches and all:),  which<br/>
i personally love:)   i highly recommend, if your family is not supportive,<br/>
creating large and inconvenient distances, even if it&#39;s to the farthest<br/>
corner of the state you live in, because it seems that out of site out of<br/>
mind has some truth to it.  jmo.<br/>
<br/>
best of luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989296616">Hello everyone,<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for months and felt that it&#39;s time for an<br/>
intro. I&#39;m Susan too, single mom to 4 yr. old Matthew, who has been<br/>
diagnosed as ADHD. I am self employed, work from home also.   Marcie&#39;s<br/>
post really hit home for me , I too have a very controlling mother. Last<br/>
year my mother took me to court to obtain her &quot;grandparents rights&quot;. She<br/>
has turned most of my family against me because I choose to raise my son<br/>
with very different religious beliefs than theirs.I try not to worry<br/>
about what the future may hold for me and my child, but I can see my<br/>
mother taking me back to court to force me to put my son in school once<br/>
she finds out that I&#39;m homeschooling. Marcie commented that the distance<br/>
helps, and I&#39;ve been wanting to move away for this very reason, but my<br/>
son&#39;s father will not let me leave the state with my minor child.<br/>
Leaving my son behind would never be an option.<br/>
Being on this list, hearing others difficulties, and how they cope,<br/>
really helps alot.  Thanks for all your experience, strength, and<br/>
insight.<br/>
Sincerely, Sus</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-142175546">Sus-<br/>
What state are you in? This helps much. I also know how hard it is to have a<br/>
mom from he**, as well as an ex (husband/boyfriend) that will put up a fight<br/>
if I move. My mom lives 1600 miles from my home. I live in Michigan, but am<br/>
moving with my husband to Kansas. I have not told the court yet. have you<br/>
considered talking to your court worker (for your son&#39;s case - In Michigan<br/>
it is Friend of the Court) about wanting to move, and what it would take to<br/>
be able to move? I have a home purchased and I talked to the worker. I am<br/>
with the understanding that a custodial parent can move, but must notify the<br/>
state and non custodial parent. It is worth checking. Now on to your mother.<br/>
I do not know enough about grandparents rights, but I know that as long as<br/>
you are schooling your child, there really is not much she can do. I would<br/>
find a support system to talk to and find out all the little things for that<br/>
too. AND take notes! LOTS OF THEM! Your best defense is a great offense.<br/>
Being prepared makes you one up. I hope that you can finally get away!<br/>
Blessings and prayers<br/>

sometime if you&#39;d like to chat.<br/>

It&#39;s interesting to me that when we open up to each other that we often find <br/>
shared experiences.  <br/>

I totally agree.  This is absolutely true.  We are so much happier living<br/>
two states away from my family.  It is close enough that the Grandparents<br/>
can visit a couple of times a year when the weather is good for driving,<br/>
but far enough that they are not all preoccupied with every little aspect<br/>
of our lives and are not coming over all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300955144">Thanks for all the input. I believe Stephanie asked what state I&#39;m in.<br/>
I&#39;m in IL, about 15 min. from St. Louis.Locally we have a &quot;grandparents<br/>
rights&quot; case  spread all over the news.I&#39;ve been following it closely.<br/>
Right now I&#39;m just working on the financial end of it , getting ready to<br/>
go back to court.  As far as my son&#39;s father goes, we are trying to work<br/>
things out between us ,  and if we were to marry, my mother wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have any rights.  <br/>
I know I brought a lot of this on myself. When I got pregnant, I allowed<br/>
my mother back into my life. Big mistake !! I was suffering from<br/>
depression, and she was a big help to me.  unfortunately, I allowed her<br/>
to manipulate me .  When I finally started to feel like my old self<br/>
again, I asked her repeatedly to back off, but finally had to end all<br/>
contact.  I know the only way to get this woman out of my life is to<br/>
move away. <br/>
Sorry this is so long, but it feels good just to get this off my chest<br/>
(now if I could only get her off my back !) Thanks for letting me vent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-961555934">hmmm.  I live in the same village as my mum, and the next-but-one village from dh&#39;s parents.  Today, we walked to the library, the park, my mum&#39;s for lunch, the &#39;swings-and-slides,&#39; and home.  The girls are very tired :-)  It&#39;s nice to have this convenience, and when we lived in the next village from here, 3 from the in-laws, I said it was good that we were close enough to visit without having to stay the night :-)  But I still find my mum&#39;s attitudes drive me nuts.  She&#39;s relaxed about some things, house-type stuff, but then she&#39;s drilling my kids in competitiveness, choosing teams when there are game programmes on the telly and putting down whoever chose the losing team, can you credit?  She doesn&#39;t mind that my kids don&#39;t ask or say please, but then she acts like a martyr while she&#39;s doing stuff.  She laughs when I try to tell them what I expect, and she tells me things I don&#39;t need them to hear, while they are there, like how they behaved, or whether they used the toilet!  This seems linked with the thread on balance to me, the trust and understanding are there with her, but not the authority, or so it seems to me.  It&#39;s really frustrating, but I can&#39;t find the words to tell her, and I don&#39;t want to while the girls are there, and we never seem to see each other when they are not.  <br/>
<br/>
Moving isn&#39;t an option for us, we have a successful business with a lot of local clients, and we just moved last year anyhow.  This situation is nothing like being under threat of court orders, The best of luck with that, and if you can&#39;t move out of the state, I&#39;d move as far as possible inside the state :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783508944">we live over the stream and through the woods from my in-laws--a definite mixed blessing.  We&#39;ve had to be very clear in setting boundaries, and clear with the kids. We&#39;ve had the kids drilled in what they&#39;re learning, subtle and not-so-subtle sabotaging our homeschooling.Whenever I tell them about something our kids are doing, they always talk about the other grandkids, whom they seldom see and seldom speak to.  But we do the best we can and carry on.<br/>
