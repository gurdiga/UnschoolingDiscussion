<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217291683">This is crazy.  Absolute nonsense.  I am sure there is a double secret agent email list out there somewhere, but it sure as hail isn&#39;t AlwaysLearning.  Double triple check the archives and see that it has only been random messages about this list.  Tell you the truth, I could give a rats patoot if you all chew each other up and spit yourselves onto cast iron - but drop the BS about AlwaysLearning.  If you are going to &quot;report&quot; on activities, do so without a spin.<br/>

&gt;You know, there has been none, absolutely none, of<br/>
&gt;this nastiness on<br/>
&gt;AlwaysLearning. Here, it always seems like it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;lurking, ready to jump out<br/>
&gt;at any time. I stay here, learning what I can and<br/>
&gt;helping whenever I can,<br/>
&gt;but I just keep wondering.....why?<br/>
&gt;Tia<br/>
<br/>
I guess to keep reporting back about what goes on on this list????? It appears that way (see their archives).<br/>

If one can wade through all the posts about poop (and I thought babies were the only ones obsessed with their poop!), you will find quite a few references to what is going on here. They are mostly from the same people.<br/>
But heck... anybody that is curious can go see for themselves by subbing to the list and reading the archives!<br/>
