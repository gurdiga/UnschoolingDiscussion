<div id="ygrps-yiv-838386185">After having a group of eclectic homeschoolers that call themselves unschoolers attack, belittle, and berate me for simply asking what their &#39;definition&#39; of unschooling was, and then saying that the definitions they hold true were not the ones I have for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Someone please remind me that I am not intolerant, disruptive, rude, or a trouble maker simply by asking questions and making people look at themselves?<br/>
<br/>
I am especially licking my wounds over, after posting &#39;my&#39; definition of unschooling at the list&#39;s request, getting this in response:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You know, I guess by your definition I am not an unschooler.  Because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to leave the education of my children up to my children.  I think that is irresponsible and setting my children up for difficulty in the future.   I can&#39;t just assume my children will meet all of their educational needs on ONLY the things they want to do.  Can you major in Barbie? <br/>
<br/>
I want my children to explore their interests, yes.  I want my children to find out what excites them, what interests them, what they feel passion for.  But I also want them to have the skills to function in our society once they are on their own.  I want them to be able to write a letter without appearing to be a moron to someone else.  I want them to speak intelligently and with confidence.   And I don&#39;t think they can do that in the future without my guidance now.  I know it may be very &quot;unschool-like&quot; for me to say this, but I think I know what is best for my children more than they do.  To leave it all up to them, to me, would be the same as neglecting their education all together. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am a new unschooler so of course this feeds on all of my &#39;fears&#39; way deep down inside..Someone remind me that I *AM* doing the right thing!!!!<br/>

Wow, This hurt me that someone would be so blind to the idea of a child is a<br/>
person.. Nichoel, I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that.<br/>
How DO we get people to understand? I totally understand when Sandra is<br/>
blunt and forceful. It is tiring to deal with those who have no desire to<br/>
open their minds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641488982">Pat:<br/>
Here is the email I sent out titled &quot;Nichoel&#39;s definition of unschooling&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling to me is completely child led learning; trusting that your child will learn from life and experiences without the need for adult lead and structured learning..IE: We only &#39;do&#39; what Shanika wants to do as far as her daily schedule goes (with the exception of family errands and the like) I dont use a curriculum to try and facilitate learning with Shanika anymore, we allow her to explore her own likes/dislikes and go from there..We try not to &#39;create&#39; too many &#39;things&#39; for Shanika to do, but if she asks for ideas/help/etc I am there to help her find her own direction..<br/>
<br/>
If you remember the ONLY reason I brought this up was because of a comment about curriculum &quot;Wow, I&#39;m so glad to hear James is liking the book!  Lara is still working out of hers too.  ****We try to work out of it 3 or 4 days a week.  It&#39;s just a great way to make sure they&#39;re keeping up, ya know?****&quot; (by Heather)...*that* is what peeked my interest because in *my* definition of unschooling that goes against the basic principle (Of strictly child led learning).. Linda did come back and explain why she does that with her son and I fully understand and can relate to it....Now I understand Heather&#39;s point of view and Linda&#39;s a bit better...but in my eyes there is nothing for Shanika to &#39;keep up&#39; with; as part of my unschooling I have thrown out the &#39;bars&#39; and &#39;goals&#39; the public school has, so she is never ahead, behind, or even on the same level as anyone else..Her learning is strictly hers. Am I making sense here? I am not saying Heather and Linda are wrong in their views, they are just different than mine =).<br/>
<br/>
Yes Shanika uses workbooks (I&#39;ve said this but it must have gotten lost..) she has one for handwriting she is really into right now..She picks it up when she feels like it and puts it down when she does as well..She has unfettered access to all things around her including TV and the CPU. I dont tell to or coerce her into using anything...She could NEVER pick up a geometry book and that would be OK with me..She could NEVER learn cursive and that would be ok with me...<br/>
<br/>
To *ME* there are several different types of homeschoolers: School at home (strict curriculum users) Eclectic (will use curriculum in a non child led way for some subjects/will unschool on some issues/nice mix of both) and Unschoolers (completely child led learning).<br/>
<br/>
When I &quot;see&quot; unschooling in the title of a group I relate it to what MY definition of unschooling is, that is why I asked what other people see unschooling as, because I gleaned that my definition and someone elses may not match. To me some of the people on this list are eclectic homeschoolers, and that is *great*; I dont behoove anyone their way of teaching their children, nor do I think &#39;my&#39; way is &#39;better&#39; than anyone elses..I just need to know what &#39;angle&#39; on unschooling/homeschooling everyone has so that I can better understand their point of view ..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Birds fly, fish swim, man thinks and learns. Therefore, we do not need to motivate children into learning by wheedling, bribing or bullying. We do not need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning. What we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world as we can into the school and classroom (in our case, into their lives); give children as much help and guidance as they ask for; listen respectfully when they feel like talking; and then get out of the way. We can trust them to do the rest.&quot; ~John Holt<br/>

Oh trust me I agree whole heartedly!<br/>
<br/>
The other list of unschoolers however dont. They think that attitude fits right in with the unschooling philosophy; that unschooling is a large umbrella the encompasses it ALL!<br/>
<br/>
(VENTING)<br/>
I have no problem with how they are schooling their kids, heck they can call it unschooling if they want..All *I* was trying to do was see if they were unschooling in &#39;my&#39; reality or somewhere else (Obviously the answer is somewhere else..).<br/>
What got me about the ENTIRE thread was that I never, not once, was confrontational about the word unschooling. I never said &quot;You are not unschoolers!&quot; because quite frankly after reading their definitions I knew where that would get me...All I ever said was &#39;my definition for us is different, now I know where you are coming from so I wont be surprised when you put things out that are different than my view&#39;....And in return I got fire brimstone and name calling.<br/>
<br/>
And they said *I* am intolerant?!?<br/>

I was just venting in general, since I havent vented about the whole thing yet..It really irked me, especially because this was a local group that I had high hopes of hooking up with from time to time!<br/>
<br/>
Hah! not anymore, one member was so vindictive that I doubt anything she could say would make me feel even remotely comfortable with her IRL..<br/>

Send &#39;em to unschooling.com, home of the unschooling pros. of the world.<br/>
The person who claimed to be an unschooler definitely was not. And all that stuff she wrote about &quot;I want this and that for my child&quot; just shows that she is lacking one basic important thing. Trust. Sounds to me like she is homeschooling her kids and that&#39;s a whole different thing.<br/>
Unschooling is a whole different philosophy about learning and life than she was talking about.<br/>
You *are* doing the right thing. <br/>

Dar, this would SO get you thrown out of Christian homeschooling conferences <br/>
in the Bible Belt!!<br/>
<br/>
Pat Farenga of Growing Without Schooling said he was speaking to 2,000 people <br/>
in North Carolina (that was fewer than half the people who were at the state <br/>
conference) and when he said kids need to have the right to say no, HALF <br/>
(1000 people) stood up and walked out on him.<br/>
<br/>
So I agree with you that kids should be living their lives in comfort in <br/>
their own homes and getting to flit from joy to joy, be careful where you say <br/>
that.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hah! not anymore, one member was so vindictive that I doubt anything she <br/>
could say would make me feel even remotely comfortable with her IRL.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But she might not be homeschooling much longer anyway.  People who try to <br/>
control too much seem to tend to give up sooner.  Or maybe she&#39;ll yet become <br/>
an unschooler!  She&#39;s already wearing the t-shirt.  &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s sorta like when I was in Catholic school and asked a question one<br/>
day, and the response was &quot;If you had asked that during the Middle Aghes,<br/>
you would have been burned at the stake.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow. That would have been something to see... sort of an Exodus, eh? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So, why exactly do people keep trying to convince me that North Carolina<br/>
is a great,. hip place to live?<br/>
