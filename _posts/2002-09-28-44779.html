<div id="ygrps-yiv-165239067">Mary - Both of my kids have gone through this phase. When you think about<br/>
it, most snack servings are much too big for a two year old.  I just gave<br/>
them what they asked for and put whatever was left in a ziplock.  They<br/>
usually ate the rest at another time, or someone else in the house did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474820199">Okay folks. Ran into a problem lately that I thought would pass and it <br/>
hasn&#39;t. I&#39;ve been giving the kids what they want to eat pretty much when <br/>
they want it. No problems with any of them and no one pigs out on the junk. <br/>
Although I am the one who has to watch with my almost 2 yr old daughter as <br/>
she&#39;s the one that too much chocolate gets to. I&#39;m sure it will pass as the <br/>
same thing happened with her older sister. I have also found out that <br/>
recently, like in the past month, she has not asked for as much as before so <br/>
that&#39;a a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I digress, now my problem, if you will. Alyssa, who will be 2 yrs in a few <br/>
weeks asks for food quite often and she&#39;s quite the eater at a tiny 23lbs. <br/>
For the last couple of weeks, whenever she asks for anything, she maybe <br/>
takes one bite, throws it away and asks for something else briefly after. <br/>
She&#39;s been doing this so often during the day that now it&#39;s getting to me. <br/>
Now mind you she is eating, just not everything and quite a bit of the stuff <br/>
not at all. This is usually reserved for the snack foods, whether it&#39;s <br/>
candy, poptart or crackers. Although it has happened at dinner too. I don&#39;t <br/>
want to tell her no she can&#39;t have it. Don&#39;t do it with any of the other 3, <br/>
why her? I have tried to explain as much as her mind can get it, but the <br/>
point is, she doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255164960">New and improved muffin tins - paint palettes!  They come in all<br/>
sorts of shapes and sizes, but the ones we are using right now<br/>
are traditional palette shape, with 8 dimples.  3 raisins here,<br/>
one cheeze cracker there, a bite of chicken over yonder.  Purists<br/>
might worry about whether the plastic is &quot;food grade&quot;  I&#39;m not<br/>
cooking it or leaving much on it long, so I don&#39;t.  The little<br/>
and the thumb hole delight the 2 y.o., especially since I have a<br/>
spot in the fridge where he can store it when he is done<br/>

<br/>
Yes she definitely doesn&#39;t get the expense part and I hate throwing food <br/>
away. Seems like my kitchen is over run with baggies. I do buy things small <br/>
size anyway. It works better for us. I even buy the little snack bags of <br/>
cookies as all the kids can just grab a bag and go. Unfortunately, the <br/>
little one maybe takes one bite out of one cookie. One bite out of one <br/>
popem, or one bite out of one snack size candy bar. I can&#39;t toast a fourth <br/>
of a poptart so the whole things gets done and she takes one bite out of one <br/>
fourth. Same with a bagel. Now when my husband is home, he eats what&#39;s left. <br/>
No one else does. I can&#39;t seem to but smaller sizes or cut smaller pieces <br/>
than I do.<br/>
<br/>
Boy I sure hope this doesn&#39;t last long.<br/>

<br/>
my kids would always do this when they were getting their molars...<br/>
are her 2 yo molars all in yet?<br/>
That might make a difference.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi Judy,<br/>
<br/>
You know I was just wondering about this last night. Not because of her <br/>
eating habits though. She was a bit feverish before bed but acting fine <br/>
otherwise. I thought right away maybe it was her molars as she hasn&#39;t gotten <br/>
them in yet. Gave her some colloidal silver and this morning she was fine. I <br/>
am checking on those gums though. Maybe that does have something to do with <br/>
how she&#39;s eating. She does seem to be picking more than usual.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the heads up and thanks to everyone who gave me advice.<br/>
<br/>
Mary B<br/>

toaster oven is just the right size.) You could cut the poptarts in fourths <br/>
(or whatever) and just toast the one piece. My kids like dried fruits, so <br/>
maybe a small dehydrator would be another good investment? You could dry some <br/>
apples and then she could have just a few pieces, then you wouldn&#39;t feel like <br/>
you were *wasting* a whole apple. <br/>

Robyn, that&#39;s funny about leaving the food around. Alyssa does the same <br/>
thing. I&#39;m always on the hunt for where she might have left something. Down <br/>
here in the south, I have to watch for ants so I need to search. The other <br/>
night, she came out in the living room eating something brown. (Oh Lord) <br/>
When my husband and I asked what it was, she said &quot;totart.&quot; And she&#39;s <br/>
happily eating. I told my husband at least she had poptart that morning and <br/>
good thing it&#39;s not from a week ago, and of course he had to ask, &quot;How do <br/>
you know?&quot;, LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all get through it. It is funny most of the time. Looks like <br/>
we have a mouse in the house as we find food with one little bite out of <br/>
it!! And I must say I&#39;m envious about you nursing. I was ready to do the <br/>
long haul with this one as I finally had some nursing support. Here Alyssa <br/>
weaned herself at a year and half. My husband was laughing at me because I <br/>
was almost trying to force feed her the breast. I was very disappointed!!!<br/>

personal gross factor. If my kids don&#39;t finish an<br/>
apple I stick it in the freezer. Then I can grate it<br/>
frozen to make apple muffins for breakfast or a snack.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also put unfinished toast in the freezer too. Then I<br/>
grate that in the food processor. Then I use the bread<br/>
crumbs in place of some of the flour in when I make<br/>
muffins and when I make pancakes. <br/>
