<div id="ygrps-yiv-427558914">Hi April,<br/>
<br/>
My son who is 6 (almost 7) has always enjoyed the Solar system.  We&#39;ve<br/>
looked at books, watched videos and used balls around the house to<br/>
represent the sizes and them put them in a line in the house and had<br/>
them as far apart as they may be in space.  One of the videos we watched<br/>
was from Bill Nye the Science Guy on the Solar system and he did a<br/>
version of that.  He did it to scale with balls and Pluto was like a<br/>
mile away from the others.  I&#39;ve also draw the solar system as my son<br/>
has.  We have the computer game, &quot;The Magic School Bus Explores the<br/>
Solar System&quot; which is excellent.  There is also a video and book of the<br/>
same episode.   Have Fun!<br/>
<br/>
