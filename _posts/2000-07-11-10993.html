I know this issue from both sides, my DF was a cop for 18 yrs and still<br/>
does security jobs on the side. I was alwasys very worried about daddy<br/>
getting hurt on the job but my parents handled it in a way that I really<br/>
didn&#39;t worry about it till later in life. The main thing I remember us<br/>
doing is that we made a big deal of him weaaring his bullet-proof vest,<br/>
he would start getting ready for work and would have me bring it to him<br/>
and help him make sure it was on correctly. I know that helped me.<br/>
Ironicly enough my dad was injured on the job (a security jobafter he had<br/>
quit the force), not by a shooting but by a reckless driver, it was a<br/>
tough fight but he did make it with a minium of problems.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a little.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Son&#39;s praying for daddy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a situation in my home and I doubt any of you<br/>
&gt; can relate to it but maybe someone has a suggestion as<br/>
&gt; to how to handle this situation. My DH is a police<br/>
&gt; officer. And my 5yo son is very aware of what daddy<br/>
&gt; does. We have been very open with him about it. It is<br/>
&gt; hard not to be when 5 days a week he sees daddy put on<br/>
&gt; his uniform with full gear and head out the door for<br/>
&gt; work. Well, the other night when DS was saying his<br/>
&gt; bedtime prayers one of the things he said was to bless<br/>
&gt; daddy not to get shot. He has never said this in his<br/>
&gt; prayers before and it really took me by surprize. I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know what to say to him. Bed time is often<br/>
&gt; difficult because he misses daddy. So I asked him if<br/>
&gt; that was the reason that he misses daddy so much at<br/>
&gt; bedtime and he said it was. He&#39;s afraid that DH will<br/>
&gt; get shot at work. DS has also said in the past that he<br/>
&gt; thinks that DH sits and shoots bad people all night<br/>
&gt; long. We have tried to explain to him that this is not<br/>
&gt; the case. I don&#39;t think he gets  it though. The other<br/>
&gt; night I didn&#39;t want to say that DH wouldn&#39;t get shot<br/>
&gt; because I don&#39;t know that won&#39;t happen. That is<br/>
&gt; possible however small that likelyhood is. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to say this will never happen and then it does.<br/>
&gt; Then DS will think I lied to him and he will be right.<br/>
&gt; I asked him if I could have some time to think about<br/>
&gt; it and then give him and answer. He said that was<br/>
&gt; fine. When I talked to DH about it he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; make an issue of it with DS. He was afraid that if we<br/>
&gt; said anything more to him or made a big deal about it<br/>
&gt; then it would further dramatize the idea in DS&#39;s head.<br/>
&gt; I feel differently. I told him I would think on it and<br/>
&gt; then give him and answer and that is what I feel I<br/>
&gt; must do. Any suggestions as to what to tell DS about<br/>
&gt; daddy gettin shot at work?<br/>
