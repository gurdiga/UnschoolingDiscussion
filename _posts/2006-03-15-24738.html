Hi <br/>
We have been lurking and de-schooling for a year. Now we are un schooling  in <br/>
earnest. I am at least:). My son is 13 and at an interesting stage in that he <br/>
 seems to be a non-violent young man in a vast band of swagger. I found this <br/>
link  on another site and it seemed to fit us:). There is a revolution afoot <br/>
in  education. Thanks for being on the front lines.<br/>
