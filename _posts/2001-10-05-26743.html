 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t help you with the Bay Area.  Haven&#39;t been down there for over 20 <br/>
years.  But you might want to look for a league that has A, B, and C teams, <br/>
or gold, silver and bronze or something like that.  Where I live only <br/>
fastball (sofball) is available, but the teams are divided first by age and <br/>
then by ability.  The A team is for the more experienced or talented, very <br/>
competitive kids.  The B team is less competitive.  The C team is for the <br/>
kids who either just want to play for fun or are less skilled and/or <br/>
experienced than the other kids.  That way is safer for the less <br/>
experienced kids.  Plus they aren&#39;t getting hassled by the stronger <br/>
players.  And the stronger players aren&#39;t being held back by the less <br/>
experienced ones.<br/>
<br/>
They have to divide by age to make the competition fair.  Otherwise a team <br/>
could pad itself up with older players that they said had lower <br/>
ability.  (Witness the kafuffle over the N.Y. team  in the Little League <br/>
World Series that had a pitcher who was 2 years older than he was supposed <br/>
to be.<br/>
