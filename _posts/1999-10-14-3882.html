<div id="ygrps-yiv-861086748">There are so many skills that are necessary for a society.  Yet many<br/>
of<br/>
us want it to be someone else&#39;s kids who grow up to: put up drywall, lay<br/>
<br/>
tile, deliver mail, maintain and repair autos, cut hair, etc.  This way<br/>
of<br/>
thinking seems exploitive to me.  We do want SOMEONE to do these things<br/>
because they are badly needed.  But if we don&#39;t value these jobs and<br/>
think of<br/>
them as undesireable, it seems like we are using these people.  Does<br/>
this<br/>
make any sense?<br/>
<br/>
yes! it makes tons of sence!! it does bother me alot when i hear people<br/>
say to kids they will end up flipping burgers if they dont go to a<br/>
university. the fast food industry seems to be booming and someone needs<br/>
to fill them and alot of us are thank ful for them specially those 2<br/>
income familys that resort to a fast food meal frequently because of<br/>
schedules. and someone has to clean all those big office buildings!<br/>
anyway i&#39;m glad you brought up the subject because i have been bothered<br/>
by comments i&#39;ve heard lately. the job does not make the person, though<br/>
there are many who believe it does. because they have no life outside of<br/>
thier work. ok i&#39;ll be done ranting.</div>
