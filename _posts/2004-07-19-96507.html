<div id="ygrps-yiv-972518710">Sorry to dive in here with something off topic, but I&#39;m trying to <br/>
find an unschooling family that my two little ones could stay with <br/>
while I work up there for five days.<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be until August 30th, and I would pay of course. It <br/>
would be for my 7 and  3.5 year old children, who would be coming <br/>
with me.<br/>
If you live in Birmingham, or know a nice family up there, would you <br/>
email me please? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks a million,<br/>
<br/>
Ren</div>
