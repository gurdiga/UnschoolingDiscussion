<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005859269">During my time working within the AOLhomeschooling forum we discovered that<br/>
one of the best rules of thumb was not to respond to *the person* but to the<br/>
*idea/topic*.    If you find yourself needing to speak to HOW something is<br/>
said,  whether you think it&#39;s rude or sarscastic or whatever, that needs to<br/>
be done privately.  If you are responding to the information given itself,<br/>
either by agreeing or disagreeing or adding more or correcting what you see<br/>
as incorrect, these go to the list.  This keeps the list from degenerating<br/>
into &quot;you were rude: - no I wasn&#39;t, you were&quot;.  Those kind of exchanges just<br/>
clutter up our mailboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Individual writing styles vary a great deal. One person can sound terribly<br/>
harsh when it was completely untendend or another person can overreact to a<br/>
plainly stated comment.  Without body language and tones of voice, email<br/>
becomes one of the hardest ways to communicate.  I always read something as<br/>
if my best friend is sitting in my own home having coffee or tea with me.<br/>
When I run up on something that grates, I give the benefit of the doubt and<br/>
move on.  Or I write privately and ask for clarifcation.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, LisaKK</div>

of advice that I have heard in a very long time! <br/>
Bravo!<br/>
