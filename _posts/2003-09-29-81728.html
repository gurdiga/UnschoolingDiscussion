<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679744716">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I have posted a bit before and thought some of you might have suggestions as you are good at thinking out of the box. My name is Christine. I live in Costa Rica. I am trying to return to the U.S.A. I would be returning without my husband. Long story but feeling quite abandoned. Unschooling my 4 kids age 1year to 11 years old. I will need to support myself and kids but don´t want to leave my children. Is this impossible? <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone out there have resources for working out of the home? I am completely bilingual(Spanish/English). I am a former elementary school teacher, I am in final stages of production of a natural language learning video but without the cash to market it, a LLL leader, quick learner, versatile<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? Feel free to contact me offline at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wanderfree@...">wanderfree@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks from a desperate mom, Christine<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963761635">Hi Christine - it&#39;s totally possible to work from home and unschool. I do it. It&#39;s not easy - but very do-able! I know the folks on this list will have many ideas and I can send you much information!<br/>

Unless you have family that you want or need to live near, I would <br/>
encourage you to compare the cost of living in different parts of the US <br/>
before picking a place to live.  (When a friend of mine moved from <br/>
Tucson to Silicon Valley, the family income doubled but they had a <br/>
*harder* time making ends meet and felt poorer.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a calculator that compares cost of living in different U.S. <br/>
cities on the Money magazine website, somewhere.<br/>
