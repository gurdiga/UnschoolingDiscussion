<div id="ygrps-yiv-814258327">Someone posted on another list that there is a group of people who <br/>
call themselves radical unschoolers, that don&#39;t teach their children <br/>
anything.  If a child asks a question, they would say, &quot;go look it <br/>
up&quot;.<br/>
I have heard non unschoolers mistakenly describe unschoolers like <br/>
this.<br/>
I had assumed they had just gotten the wrong impression.  I have <br/>
heard IRL people describe unschoolers as those who don&#39;t use books <br/>
and the parents let the children do anything, without any input from <br/>
them.  I have corrected people and said they have come to an <br/>
incorrect conclusion, and went on to explain it a little better(I <br/>
hope).  <br/>
Have I somehow missed &quot;real&quot; radical unschoolers, in all of my <br/>
reading over the years?  I have never had anyone try to defend a <br/>
totally hands off philosophy.<br/>
I&#39;m not assuming there aren&#39;t those out there that may do this, I <br/>
just don&#39;t recall hearing any of them advocate it.<br/>
Can anyone enlightne me?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320941151">I&#39;ve only seen that description of unschooling (totally leaving kids to their <br/>
own devices) by unschooling detractors, or by people saying sarcastically <br/>
when they first inquire, &quot;SO--you&#39;re saying...&quot; and describing it in the most <br/>
cold-hearted way!<br/>
<br/>
In over ten years of reading everything I could find on paper, back issues of <br/>
GWS, online starting with Prodigy&#39;s homeschooling boards, I&#39;ve not seen it.<br/>

I really don&#39;t understand the theory that kids need an<br/>
&quot;opportunity&quot; to live like savages so they can be properly socialized.<br/>
 They can learn the same lessons in the safety of their homes by reading<br/>
&quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;<br/>

One mom came on and said that she had &quot;unschooled&quot; all three of her children <br/>

She went into great detail about what they were doing in their adult lives <br/>

in fact, believe that their lifestyle was a pure form of unschooling.<br/>

I&#39;ve seen people who are as traumatized as this about religion, so it&#39;s<br/>
not a big stretch to imagine that there<br/>
are people this traumatized by school.<br/>
