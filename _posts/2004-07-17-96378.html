&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been told that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; being too much of a control freak by asking the grandparents, aunts and<br/>
&gt;&gt; uncles to limit toys. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I certainly understand feeling overwhelmed by the consumerism of our<br/>
&gt; culture, with every occassion being a time to get more and more stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, it is important to remember that your children may not (and at<br/>
&gt; their ages, probably don&#39;t) share your beliefs.  Things to consider:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Even though it may feel to you that your home is overflowing with toys<br/>
&gt; and stuff.  For that child, it is the only birthday they will have for a<br/>
&gt; tremendously long time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) I would never tell someone what kind of gift to give but you might ask<br/>
&gt; your relatives if they have considered giving activities rather than things<br/>
&gt; (perhaps a home-made coupon book with pages for fishing with grandpa or<br/>
&gt; making cookies with grandma &lt;my kids love these&gt;) or perhaps memberships at<br/>
&gt; the zoo or children&#39;s museum, movie tickets, etc..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a thought.<br/>

watch kids open a big pile of gifts all at once - tear the paper off, <br/>
take a quick look, say a quick thank you, and then on to the next one <br/>
in the pile.<br/>
<br/>
I went to a really nice party once - a gentle attachment-parenting mom <br/>
I admired a lot. She had her son open gifts as people arrived (which <br/>
wasn&#39;t all at once - spread out throughout the afternoon). Each <br/>
person&#39;s gift was opened as if it was the only one - he thanked them, <br/>
spent a little time with them, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I also like to give gifts when I happen to find something that I think <br/>
the person will like and I admit I find it really hard to buy gifts <br/>
when it is an obligation.<br/>

I&#39;ve read just a few pages of a book that I think was recommended by <br/>
someone here. And it has already really given me some major insight. It <br/>
talks about how much we usually don&#39;t like it when somebody tells us to <br/>
do something we were just about to do. For example, we spill something <br/>
and we&#39;re reaching for some paper towels to clean it up and our spouse <br/>
or parent says, &quot;Use those paper towels to clean that up.&quot; Makes many <br/>
of us NOT want to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Well - the author of this book talks about how some people have the <br/>
same reaction to things we tell ourselves to do. This rings very true <br/>
to me. For example, I look at the dirty dishes and I&#39;m really planning <br/>
to wash them, and I say to myself, &quot;You should wash those, get them <br/>
done now, they&#39;ll just be harder to do later, now don&#39;t procrastinate.&quot; <br/>
  My response to MySELF is really similar to my reaction to somebody <br/>

glares at me when I do this to him, sometimes there is a little lecture<br/>

to do ...whatever.  My 3yo says Mommy don&#39;t tell me that.  And yes, it bugs<br/>
me when I do it to myself.<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested once that changing all your shoulds to coulds can be<br/>
helpful. &quot;Hmm I could do those dishes.&quot; sounds more like a choice than an<br/>
order.  But once I started doing it, the trick wore off or something and I<br/>
went back to the same annoyed feeling.  It&#39;s so strange.<br/>

---------<br/>
<br/>
With adult parties we go to it&#39;s often done that way. If someone brings a <br/>
gift its either unwrapped anyway, or maybe it&#39;s opened during the &quot;hi, I&#39;m glad <br/>
you&#39;re here&quot; moment.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve usually waited so the other kids can see, because they like to see <br/>
gifts opened.  If someone has to leave early, we&#39;ll do the gift opening before <br/>
they go, and open theirs first.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not purely a gift thing, but in our old house we had a covered patio in <br/>
back, and I figured out the easiest way to stage places for cake or games or <br/>
gifts was to move kids back and forth from one location to another, especially <br/>
if there were extra adults.  Kids were drawn to the new setup, and the old <br/>
room was cleared and re-set, to draw them back.<br/>
<br/>
At the new house we still do that, with the library and the six-steps-down <br/>
front-room/kitchen.  We can clean away the snack food while kids are upstairs <br/>
playing a game, and set up cake.  Then while they&#39;re eating cake downstairs, we <br/>
rearrange from their game and set the gift-stage.<br/>
<br/>
More peace, less confusion, clean-up is in four stages instead of one big <br/>
mess.<br/>

acknowledge.  Commonly done in my childhood, too, and<br/>
I&#39;m the queen of procrastination now.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a tape in your head, and it takes a while to<br/>
replace it with a tape of your own.  Wow those dishes<br/>
are nasty.  They&#39;re just going to get nastier.  Should<br/>
I do them now, nasty, or later, nastier.  Then just<br/>
choose.  Neither one is good or bad, just nasty and<br/>
nastier.  lol<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one day you&#39;ll wash em right away, *most* of the<br/>
time, like I do now, or not.  Doesn&#39;t matter. Except<br/>
to you (which is hard to remember!).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting better.  ( I&#39;m not dead, I think I&#39;ll go<br/>
for a walk! lol Anyway....)<br/>
<br/>
Story: <br/>
<br/>
We went to the Chinese Buffet last night for dinner. <br/>
It seems like every time I went up ( which is a lot of<br/>
times!) there was a woman with two or three (couldn&#39;t<br/>
tell, wasn&#39;t really paying attention at the time)<br/>
kids, not toddlers but a little older, and she kept<br/>
using the word can&#39;t.  But in this sickly sweet, nice<br/>
as can be, tone of voice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You can&#39;t do that, here let me do that for you.&quot;  <br/>
Or a similar refrain.  I swear to god I thought I was<br/>
going to explode by the fifth or sixth time.  It<br/>
seemed synchronicity by then, btw, I mean what are the<br/>
odds, every time I was up there, there she was?  I<br/>
digress.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course by then there was a total melt down.  That<br/>
kid was screaming from frustration.  I could see it<br/>
clearly, because I had been thru that, had done that<br/>
for a while until I saw the error of my ways.  <br/>
<br/>
She thought she was being a &quot;good mother&quot;.  I would<br/>
even hazard a guess that she thought she was being a<br/>
fantastic mother, jumping up and down the entire time<br/>
to do this or that for her child(ren).  She probably<br/>
has no clue.  And I had no idea what to do or say. <br/>
<br/>
 I did that, my mother did that, she&#39;s doing that,<br/>
maybe her mother did that, maybe her mother was an<br/>
abusive heartless ignoring type mother and she&#39;s doing<br/>
the exact opposite, I have no idea. <br/>
<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I shared this story, really, I have<br/>
no solution to this particular situation.  It&#39;s not<br/>
like it&#39;s abuse, obvious and society agreed upon harm.<br/>
I just know it&#39;s a problem for this child.  She just<br/>
wants to do something, *anything*, *for* herself, *by*<br/>
herself.  God forbid. <br/>
<br/>
She prolly won&#39;t really *know* when to do the dishes.<br/>
She&#39;ll prolly just know excruciatingly well, how, when<br/>
and which way she &quot;SHOULD&quot; do them.  Which isn&#39;t the<br/>
same thing. And when she does finally do them, she&#39;ll<br/>
prolly have this feeling that it wasn&#39;t done quite<br/>
right, and she&#39;ll prolly feel guilty about that too.  <br/>

&gt; Nicely is the worst! lol  Harder to see and<br/>
&gt; acknowledge.  Commonly done in my childhood, too, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m the queen of procrastination now.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a tape in your head, and it takes a while to<br/>
&gt; replace it with a tape of your own.  Wow those dishes<br/>
&gt; are nasty.  They&#39;re just going to get nastier.  Should<br/>
&gt; I do them now, nasty, or later, nastier.  Then just<br/>
&gt; choose.  Neither one is good or bad, just nasty and<br/>
&gt; nastier.  lol<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe one day you&#39;ll wash em right away, *most* of the<br/>
&gt; time, like I do now, or not.  Doesn&#39;t matter. Except<br/>
&gt; to you (which is hard to remember!).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m getting better.  ( I&#39;m not dead, I think I&#39;ll go<br/>
&gt; for a walk! lol Anyway....)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Story: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went to the Chinese Buffet last night for dinner. <br/>
&gt; It seems like every time I went up ( which is a lot of<br/>
&gt; times!) there was a woman with two or three (couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; tell, wasn&#39;t really paying attention at the time)<br/>
&gt; kids, not toddlers but a little older, and she kept<br/>
&gt; using the word can&#39;t.  But in this sickly sweet, nice<br/>
&gt; as can be, tone of voice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;You can&#39;t do that, here let me do that for you.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; Or a similar refrain.  I swear to god I thought I was<br/>
&gt; going to explode by the fifth or sixth time.  It<br/>
&gt; seemed synchronicity by then, btw, I mean what are the<br/>
&gt; odds, every time I was up there, there she was?  I<br/>
&gt; digress.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course by then there was a total melt down.  That<br/>
&gt; kid was screaming from frustration.  I could see it<br/>
&gt; clearly, because I had been thru that, had done that<br/>
&gt; for a while until I saw the error of my ways.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She thought she was being a &quot;good mother&quot;.  I would<br/>
&gt; even hazard a guess that she thought she was being a<br/>
&gt; fantastic mother, jumping up and down the entire time<br/>
&gt; to do this or that for her child(ren).  She probably<br/>
&gt; has no clue.  And I had no idea what to do or say. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I did that, my mother did that, she&#39;s doing that,<br/>
&gt; maybe her mother did that, maybe her mother was an<br/>
&gt; abusive heartless ignoring type mother and she&#39;s doing<br/>
&gt; the exact opposite, I have no idea. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *sigh*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know why I shared this story, really, I have<br/>
&gt; no solution to this particular situation.  It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; like it&#39;s abuse, obvious and society agreed upon harm.<br/>
&gt; I just know it&#39;s a problem for this child.  She just<br/>
&gt; wants to do something, *anything*, *for* herself, *by*<br/>
&gt; herself.  God forbid. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She prolly won&#39;t really *know* when to do the dishes.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;ll prolly just know excruciatingly well, how, when<br/>
&gt; and which way she &quot;SHOULD&quot; do them.  Which isn&#39;t the<br/>
&gt; same thing. And when she does finally do them, she&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; prolly have this feeling that it wasn&#39;t done quite<br/>
&gt; right, and she&#39;ll prolly feel guilty about that too.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *sigh* <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042325159">I remember hearing an interview with someone -a personal coach, maybe?  She/he (can&#39;t remember) said that she/he told clients to tell themselves -- &quot;Only if you want to and whenever you are ready, then [fill in blank with action].&quot;   The coach said that framing it in that way bypassed an automatic &quot;don&#39;t tell me what to do&quot; response that the coach had found that people had even to telling something to themselves. <br/>
<br/>
I think this must also be somehow related to why it seems so much more satisfying for a child to discover that cutting apple quarters into halves always results in 8 pieces, rather than being told (even when ready and curious) that 2*4= 8 or 4*1/2=8.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I sure do relate to the above. Not sure why - I don&#39;t think my mom was <br/>
like that with me, always &quot;doing for&quot; me and making me fee like I <br/>
couldn&#39;t do things myself - but I have spotty memories, too - like I <br/>
was half in a daze throughout my childhood. And my parents were very <br/>
young - only 20 when they had me - so even though my mom was awesome <br/>
later, extremely knowledgeable about children and I learned a ton from <br/>
her - I&#39;m not really sure, can&#39;t really get in touch with, how I was <br/>
raised when I was younger. I know we were absolutely never spanked. And <br/>
I had a happy childhood - with a lot of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
But my mom and dad could easily have been doing and saying lots of <br/>
things that weren&#39;t great for us, psychologically - I know I ended up <br/>
with pretty extreme perfectionism - got that from somewhere, for sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684114522">Yes, and it has been liberating! <br/>
<br/>
To live without fears allows for so much more joyful exploration of <br/>
the world. Actually, my son gave this gift to me. <br/>

I read a quote that your children teach you what you most need to <br/>
learn. Parenting is humbling, challenging and rewarding. I would not <br/>
have missed these lessons for the world. <br/>

Me too, me too.  Happy, lots of freedom, but maybe<br/>
still not &#39;ideal&#39; whatever that is, lol, and still<br/>
went to school...That was really the only thing I<br/>
could point at and say, OK, well, I know not to do<br/>
THAT, lol.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and also didn&#39;t have a father, or had a line of<br/>

And the other side of the perfectionism coin is<br/>
procrastination.  I know I&#39;m not going to do it<br/>
perfectly, so I&#39;m just not going to bother, at all. <br/>
lol <br/>
<br/>
Someone once told me I had a fear of success going on.<br/>
 Perfectionism can sometimes make you fearful of being<br/>
successful, because what if you&#39;re on a pedestal, and<br/>
you get knocked off?  It&#39;s a long, long fall.  <br/>
<br/>
So I avoid pedestals, not success! lol <br/>

When I was cleaning that storeroom this morning, I was thinking &quot;I used to be <br/>
a dynamo!&quot;  I was filing some things, throwing most away, but there were <br/>
finished projects that I&#39;m still impressed by.  And then there were the many, MANY <br/>
more partly, never finished projects.  When I have the energy and opportunity <br/>
to do something really flashy, I&#39;m there.  When flash or follow-through are <br/>
lacking, I tend to freeze up some, or dabble and stall.<br/>

I think it&#39;s genetic.<br/>
