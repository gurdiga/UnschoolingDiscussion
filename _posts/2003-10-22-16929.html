<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009285070">As I am writing this, the kids are home early from school. He was putting<br/>
his shoes on to go out. I said he was staying in today. He completely doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand why. I tried to tell him about being disrepectful to my needs, he<br/>
just went and sulked.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like what I did, but I don&#39;t see any natural consequences here and<br/>
I&#39;m tired of just being ignored. Anybody have any better suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone made a much WORSE suggestion:<br/>
     <br/>
&lt;&lt;He&#39;s made his bed...let him lie in it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, he&#39;s a little boy.  His mom made him a bed he cannot comfortably lie in, <br/>
and she needs to make him a better bed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You gave him a reasonable request, for his own safety, and not just to boss <br/>
him<br/>
around. He ignored it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He made a reasonable request and the mom said no.<br/>
He made a reasonable request and the mom ignored it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He did what he wanted.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When a child is being unschooled, most of his day MUST be doing what he <br/>
wants.  And if the mom doesn&#39;t want to help create an environment where he can do <br/>
LOTS of things he wants, maybe school would be a safer, better place for him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You laid down the law. Now stick to your guns! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is not a cowboy justice list.<br/>
I&#39;m sure you could find one, and they&#39;ll say &quot;take a razor strop to him out <br/>
behind the shed.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This is an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This kind of advice is really not at all helpful:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you give in, he&#39;ll know you are a sucker and he&#39;ll keep<br/>
doing it. After a few days worth of limited freedom, he&#39;ll change his ways.<br/>
But you have to be firm and not give in, and you have to be willing to let him<br/>
dislike you for a little while.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know a lot of people are really into freedom and choices for their kids. <br/>

I wish you all luck with your children and hope they are well and <br/>
happy.  Best of luck in your endeavors.</div>
