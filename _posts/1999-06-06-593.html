&gt;Thought you all might be interested in checking out an editorial by Jeff<br/>
&gt;Berry in the recent Creative Loafing (you can find it at their website:<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clnetwork.net/">http://www.clnetwork.net/</a>  - scroll down the page to &quot;Columns&quot; then click<br/>
&gt;on Jeff Berry).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you have high blood pressure, take care!  Mr. Berry feels<br/>
&gt;homeschooling should not be legal - and his view of homeschoolers is<br/>
&gt;unfortunately as limited and uninformed as that of many of our<br/>
&gt;legislators.  We need better - and more accurate publicity!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A suggestion to anyone interested in responding to Jeff Berry: flaming<br/>
&gt;him back will not accomplish much - educating him might.  As with any<br/>
&gt;lobbying attempts or letters to legislators, thoughtful, polite and<br/>
&gt;reasonable communications accomplish far more in the long run.  Now take<br/>
&gt;a deep breath, calm yourself - and check out the article.<br/>

&gt;Stop home schooling<br/>
&gt;By Jeff Berry<br/>
&gt;Special class: Ignorance & paranoia 101<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Many of you may not know that in addition to being a fabulously<br/>
&gt;talented writer, I am also a lawyer, brain surgeon and architect.<br/>
&gt;   I did not go to college to obtain my lofty degrees. I didn&#39;t have to.<br/>
&gt;Using the logic of a burgeoning conservative movement in this country, I<br/>
&gt;home-schooled myself in these disciplines and awarded myself the<br/>
&gt;diplomas. I was an excellent student, with a perfect 4.0 grade-point<br/>
&gt;average. I graduated at the top of my class.<br/>
&gt;   And by schooling myself at home instead of at some pointy-headed<br/>
&gt;&quot;university, &quot; I was kept safe from the twin evils of liberal elitism and<br/>
&gt;godless secular humanism.<br/>
&gt;   Throughout America, it has become rather fashionable among the<br/>
&gt;conservative kook set to withhold children from public and private<br/>
&gt;educational institutions in order to &quot;school&quot; them at home. To hear them<br/>
&gt;tell it, they have all had great success with their youngsters, who are<br/>
&gt;insulated in a loving home far away from gangs, violence and people of<br/>
&gt;other races.<br/>
&gt;  	Yes indeed, conservative stay-at-home moms with high school educations<br/>
&gt;all over the nation are instructing their children in such advanced<br/>
&gt;academic pursuits as laundry folding, soap-opera watching and house<br/>
&gt;cleaning -- the skills every child needs to succeed.<br/>
&gt;  	Oh sure, Mom occasionally refers the kids to some printed material<br/>
&gt;written by a TV evangelist that is supposed to serve as the child&#39;s<br/>
&gt;home-school &quot;curriculum,&quot; but that&#39;s usually only a momentary distraction<br/>
&gt;from the day&#39;s home-school schedule. The core of their academic day --<br/>
&gt;consisting mainly of shopping, telephone calls, and television -- is<br/>
&gt;rarely interrupted with an attempt at actual &quot;instruction.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  	These parents believe that every school is a hopeless drug-infested<br/>
&gt;wasteland. In their minds, they are simply exercising the essence of<br/>
&gt;freedom -- which is to &quot;school&quot; their children at home, far from the<br/>
&gt;corrupting influences of teachers with college &quot;degrees&quot; and people whose<br/>
&gt;religion, race or political ideology may be different from their own.<br/>
&gt;   But to my mind, they are guilty of aggravated child abuse.<br/>
&gt;  	Removing a child from school is to reject the very basis of human<br/>
&gt;intelligence in an enlightened society. It prevents children from<br/>
&gt;acquiring passable social skills, it deprives them of the opportunity to<br/>
&gt;forge lasting personal relationships, and it causes ignorance and<br/>
&gt;outright stupidity on a grand scale. Home schooling creates an atmosphere<br/>
&gt;of insular paranoia that breeds intolerance and suspicion of people who<br/>
&gt;are different.<br/>
&gt;  	But hey, if our culture is willing to allow children to obtain a high<br/>
&gt;school equivalency certificate even though they have never set foot in a<br/>
&gt;schoolhouse, why can&#39;t I home-school myself in the advanced sciences,<br/>
&gt;such as medicine or law? What liberal tyrant would deprive me of that<br/>
&gt;God-given right?<br/>
&gt;  	Conservatives often use 1950s America as an example of the cultural<br/>
&gt;morality to which all Americans should adhere. But in the 1950s, refusing<br/>
&gt;to send your child to school would have gotten a parent tossed in jail,<br/>
&gt;and the child charged with truancy.<br/>
&gt;  	An Internet search on the subject of home schooling clearly reveals<br/>
&gt;that the  phenomenon is being perpetuated by a host of societal misfits,<br/>
&gt;fringe political activists and fundamentalist religious zealots. Such<br/>
&gt;people are extremely hostile to any assault upon what they believe to be<br/>
&gt;their Constitutional right to deprive their children of an education. As<br/>
&gt;one home &quot;schooling&quot; parent asked me, &quot;Why are you so concerned about how<br/>
&gt;other people elect to educate their kids, Mr. Berry?&quot;<br/>
&gt;	  &quot;It&#39;s Doctor Berry,&quot; I replied. &quot;And home schooling is nothing but<br/>
&gt;parentally sanctioned truancy. It should be outlawed.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
