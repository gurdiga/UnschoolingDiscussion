<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458749004">I&#39;m sorry about this, but I need to vent and I hope that it&#39;s okay to <br/>
do it here.<br/>
<br/>
We had a scare here today, Jaiden and Avery were happily playing in <br/>
their bedroom while I was putzing around the livingroom when I here <br/>
this crash and a scream that I hope I never have to hear again. <br/>
Jaiden&#39;s dresser had fallen on him while he was sitting in the bottom <br/>
drawer. He took the weight of the dresser on the back of his left <br/>
shoulder and had his stomach pressed into the top of the drawer his <br/>
was sitting in. I know understand hom parents are a ble to perform <br/>
amazing feats to get to their kids, I shoved the dresser out of the <br/>
way and ended up throwing the drawers across the room to get to him. <br/>
We ended up going to the ER he couldn&#39;t lift his arm and said his <br/>
stomach really hurt. We got there and he couldn&#39;t eat or drink <br/>
anything, Avery was running all over the place with my mom chasing <br/>
him, Jason was about 45 miles inland and it took him a couple of <br/>
hours to get there. Everything was okay until we got into our room, <br/>
when Jaiden started to get really scared and was begging me to take <br/>
him home, he was crying and trying so hard to be brave but was so <br/>
scared and nothing I could say was making him feel better. Jason <br/>
finally got there, we had yet to see a dr. A resident finally came in <br/>
and looked him over and decided to order blood work, xrays, and cat <br/>
scans but wouldn&#39;t tell us if anything was wrong. None of us had <br/>
eaten they still wouldn&#39;t let jaiden even have a drink of water, he <br/>
was upset, I was upset, and Jason was getting mad. Jason finally told <br/>
Jaiden to get dressed we were leaving. He told hte nurce he wanted <br/>
our dicharge papers. I was shaking, so afraid that something was <br/>
wrong with Jaiden, even though by tis time other than being tired, <br/>
hungry, very thirsty and a little achy he said and seemed fine. our <br/>
decision to leave seemed to really upset the nurces and they got the <br/>
head dr. over to look at him. He decided after really looking at him <br/>
that he was fine and we were okay to go home. He was also nice enough <br/>
to give Jaiden a popsicle. So our day turned out good, Jaiden was and <br/>
is fine but we are all still upset and cranky and thank you for <br/>
letting me get this out.<br/>

hope you never hear again!  I heard it when Kree broke her arm leaping off <br/>
the top bunk bed to catch our leaping cat. Dh thought she had just maybe <br/>
sprained it, three hours later, they were preparing my baby, who was 5 at the <br/>
time, for reconstructive surgery on her arm. It was horrible. So I&#39;m very <br/>
happy that your baby is ok. Dh felt awful that he thought it was no big deal <br/>
at the beginning, but he seemed to arrive at the hospital within minutes of <br/>
hearing the news, carrying in her stuffed buddy, Monkey Butt. <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who also hopes to never hear that scream of pain from her offspring <br/>
again.<br/>

what a scary day.  I am sure you guys are all very tired after all that.  Get <br/>
a hot cup of tea and sit with your children and watch their favorite movie <br/>
all snuggled up together.  That always helps me calm down and feel more <br/>
connected.<br/>

Is his arm okay today?<br/>
<br/>
Poor guy.  <br/>
<br/>
A chest of drawers fell on me once when I was using drawers as steps to climb <br/>
up to get y remote control car (with a wire, ancient days), but luckily I was <br/>
laid out straight on my back and not bent up under it, and our house was <br/>
little.<br/>
<br/>
Little boy bellies are fragile things, and I bet he was in pain AND scared.  <br/>
I hope he&#39;s okay today.  And I hope you&#39;re recovered too.  The adrenaline <br/>
that lets moms lift dressers is a lot of biochemistry to take all at one <br/>
time.  It can be deeply exhausting afterward.<br/>

Thank you everyone for your concern, he&#39;s doing great today. I felt bad dumping on the list and signing off, but Jaiden asked me and Jason to sleep with him so we made a bed on the livingroom floor and watched &#39;Babe&#39; until he fell asleep, I had to move into our bed to nurce Avery but Jason stayed with him all night. They told us what to look for just incase he had any internal injurys so Jason was up every couple of hours checking his stomach, nothing changed. The dr said that if nothing poped up in 24 hours he was fine, so far so good. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again, it was very scary and I&#39;m glad that everything is okay now. I&#39;m lettin Jason sleep for a little while longer, then I&#39;m gonna have him bolt the dressers to the wall.<br/>

I hope he&#39;s okay today.&gt;&gt;&gt; That was one of the things we were most concerned about, him having internal injurys, he kept telling hte first dr(the resident) that his stomach hurt, but the dr wouldn&#39;t listen to Jason and me when we ketp telling him that Jaiden was hungry and thirsty it had been 9 hours since he&#39;d had anything to eat or drink. He was also very scared and really wanted to go home. &lt;&lt;&lt;And I hope you&#39;re recovered too.  The adrenaline <br/>
that lets moms lift dressers is a lot of biochemistry to take all at one <br/>

up the escalator.  Jake had a closed umbrella in his hand, and his right foot <br/>
was crossed over the left.  The umbrella was whizzing along the wall of the <br/>
escalator near the top of Jake&#39;s foot, which was very close to the side, and <br/>
somehow while he shifted his weight the umbrella got lower and helped his shoe <br/>
get pulled into the space between the escalator stair and the wall.  Halfway up, <br/>
he screamed in pain, and I looked and noticed what was happening.  I knew I <br/>
didn&#39;t want him to reach the top with his foot stuck like that.  <br/>
<br/>
With Jon still on my back, I lept up in one giant step the 4 or 5 steps to <br/>
the top, leaned over with my free hand, grabbed Jake by the upper arm and yanked <br/>
him free, all the way clear of the escalator behind me, and all the while <br/>
avoiding the shredder at the top of the stairs.  It was truly herculean, and it <br/>
was *easy*.  I can still remember what it felt like.<br/>
<br/>
Adrenaline is the only way to explain how I did that.  Jake was wearing high <br/>
tops Nike&#39;s.  The rubber edge was cut through on the top and bottom of his <br/>
shoe, and his toes were red and pinched, but they would be just fine.  I screamed <br/>
for an employee and she called the manager and I blackmailed a new pair of <br/>
shoes out of him, saying it could have been a lot worse and they&#39;d be getting <br/>
off easy with just new pair of shoes.  We went down to the shoe department and <br/>
got Jake all fixed up.<br/>
<br/>
When we finally got to the car, I completely fell apart, shaking and crying, <br/>
and was unable to drive for a good 20 minutes.  Then we all went home and had <br/>
a good long nap.  Had to be the adrenaline.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691633617">Rebecca, I&#39;m so glad everyone is okay.  We&#39;ve been a situation where <br/>
Dr&#39;s in the ER won&#39;t see us until we&#39;ve packed up and began to walk out <br/>
the door with our 2 month old and a high fever.  It&#39;s so upsetting.  I <br/>
have dressers I need to attach, but also, I&#39;ve worried about the kitchen <br/>
stove.  I&#39;ve read stories about children opening the oven door and <br/>
tipping the whole stove on top of themselves when the try to stand on <br/>
the opened door to reach the top.  There must be a way to secure metal <br/>
appliances, isn&#39;t there?     Again,  thank goodness Jaiden&#39;s okay.   HeidiC.<br/>
