**One of my best is cheery music, cheery movies<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you find appropriate for your son, so you may want to get <br/>
reviews of these before going out and renting them. My daughters are 11 and 14, <br/>
and have just started to be allowed to watch these types of movies over the <br/>
past year. But I am incredibly too picky -- according to my sister.<br/>
Nine Months<br/>
Sweet Home Alabama<br/>
Grumpy (and Grumpier) Old Men<br/>
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days<br/>
Miss Congeniality<br/>
Run Away Bride<br/>
Bewitched episodes<br/>
Scooby-Doo (not animated, but those are funny, too)<br/>
Freaky Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
