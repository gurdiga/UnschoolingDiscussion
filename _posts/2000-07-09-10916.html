I would feel somewhat violated if people could access totally &gt;personal feelingsa such as these , on a search engine...after all &gt;this is somewhat of a support group, and in these type sof groups it &gt;is in the spirit of the groups to assume soem degree of &gt;confidentiality.  wouldn&#39;t you think?  Not that it matters what &gt;someone might think that reads this, but it is rather personal..I &gt;should be able to choose to whom, I &#39;d like to share it with.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that I agree with whoever it was that said that this medium, unfortunately, does not involve large levels of privacy.  A determined individual can find access to just about whatever they like on here.  The only solution would be not to keep archives, but I think that discourages membership and keeps groups small.  I think it is a matter of accepting the limitations of this medium.<br/>
