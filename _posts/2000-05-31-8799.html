<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh, the joys of country living!!!&nbsp; We moved 
form San Diego, CA to far northeastern Nebraska four years ago, and I have no 
regrets at all.&nbsp; We live five miles from town, I wish we lived further 
out.&nbsp; We live on a gravel road that has a nasty curve that has snowbound us 
more than once.&nbsp; There is no one around us, we can see a neighbor&#39;s house 
about 1 1/2 miles away.&nbsp; Town is small, it has a market to buy essentials, 
but we go to the city for our shopping once a week.&nbsp; The city is about 30 
miles away.&nbsp; Too close for me!&nbsp; My husband commute 45 miles to work, 
and our gas bill is astronomical, but it is worth it.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We have a large garden that gives us most of our 
vegetables in the the summer, and about half of our vegetables in the 
winter.&nbsp; I can most of the vegetables.&nbsp; We have our own chickens, 
raise a few pigs for our own use every year, have goats we milk, a few sheep, 
and a steer and a heifer.&nbsp; We also have a pair of geese and a pair of 
ducks.&nbsp; My kids are learning about responsibility as we get up every 
morning to go out and do chores, and again every night.&nbsp; Animals must be 
fed every day!&nbsp; They are learning about finance as they sell their animals 
and help pay for others.&nbsp; They are learning about hard work when they take 
their animals to fair and show them.&nbsp; And they are learning about the 
rewards of all of this when they receive their fair premiums!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We live in a small town that is populated by people 
who are almost all related to each other in some way, so we are truly 
outsiders!&nbsp; One would expect to be snubbed, but I have not found that to be 
true in our case.&nbsp; Perhaps it is because we didn&#39;t come to the country and 
then complain because it is not like the city!&nbsp; We pitched in and 
volunteered to help with cattle drives, haying, castrating pigs and sheep, and 
clean up after a tornado.&nbsp; In doing so, we learned how to do a great many 
things, and we made some wonderful friends.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">What I have seen is that the people who never &quot;fit 
in&quot; are those who really don&#39;t try.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The country is not for everyone, but if your heart 
is here, then you will be *very* happy, and you will find that country people 
are about the best people there are.</font></div>
