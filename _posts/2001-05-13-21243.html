In the huge rush to build shopping malls and banks,<br/>
no one is thinking about where kids can play.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t generate tax revenue.<br/>

* SUSTAINABILITY: METHOD OR MASSAGE?<br/>
  By Steve Van Matre<br/>
  &quot;Sustainability.&quot; What is it? What does it mean? Author<br/>
  and educator Steve Van Matre, takes a hard-hitting look <br/>
  at one of the most used buzzwords of our times. <br/>
<br/>
* WORKING WITH SIMPLICITY: THE CASE FOR PART-TIME WORK<br/>
  By Linda Breen Pierce<br/>
  Reducing the time that you spend working for money can <br/>
  allow you more time for family, friends, personal growth, <br/>
  volunteering, and changing the world. Linda reminds us <br/>
  that there&#39;s more to life than the nine to five <br/>
  treadmill, and suggests ways we might make the change to <br/>
  fewer work hours in our own lives. <br/>

* FINDING MEANING IN A CUP OF COFFEE<br/>
  By Rodney North<br/>
  Chances are you&#39;re staring at your morning cup of coffee <br/>
  right now. Where did it come from? How was it grown? Who <br/>
  picked the beans? Oh yeah, and how does it taste? For <br/>
  many Americans the answers are: &quot;don&#39;t know, don&#39;t know, <br/>
  don&#39;t know,&quot; and &quot;eh, it&#39;s okay.&quot; A group of <br/>
  businesspeople are betting that there are enough <br/>
  consumers of coffee who would love to purchase a product <br/>
  that is good for the environment, pays a living wage for <br/>
  its workers, and tastes great. <br/>
<br/>
* THE FUTURE BELONGS TO BUTTERFLIES<br/>
  By Mark A Burch<br/>
  Ecologists predict that our current levels of population <br/>
  growth, consumption, resource use, and environmental <br/>
  impact will result in one big global environmental crisis <br/>
  within the next 50 years or so. While some people are <br/>
  predicting the worst, or doing their best to reduce their <br/>
  impact, others are blithely ignoring -- or covering up -- <br/>
  potential problems. In this article Mark Burch assesses <br/>
  the role of voluntary simplicity among the array of our <br/>
  society&#39;s other responses to potential environmental <br/>
  crisis.</div>
