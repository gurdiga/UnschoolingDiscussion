<div id="ygrps-yiv-464005800">Hi-I changed the thread title  to address the questions of kids wanting to go to school to be &quot;normal&quot; or ( for my grandchildren ) wanting to go to public school because everyone they know does and not to do that  is usually too  much of a barrier to having friends to play with.<br/>
The kids they know made a Very big deal about them  not going to public school. The  children had simply never heard of such a thing. They still are puzzled by it when they see Kara who is still  homeschooling while her twin went back to public school last October and loves it.<br/>
I wish they had never gone to school but I think it would have become a very big issue even so.<br/>
I wish I had some answers to how to unschool  when one wants to go to school. <br/>
The biggest problem is that it is impossible  to get away from the public school idea with one in school.There are no homeschoolers  under 12 in the area and all of the others are enrolled in distance learning or a combination of that and Christian based homeschooling.<br/>
We let/ or have  Stephanie stay home whenever  we have to go away or when she is very tired or if she  just wants to (the last almost never happens). <br/>
 We are not able to just take off  whenever we want because  that makes it very difficult for her  at school and we do support her in her choice ( in that we make it possible for her to do as much or as well as she wants to.)<br/>
With over 1000 members on this list is there no one????? who has taken  their young kids out of public school   when there was no real issues-(ie, bad schools-learning difficulties-reluctance to go-bullying)  other than the conviction that  realxed home schooling ar unschooling was a very positive thing?<br/>
I know that the last time I asked I was given the message that if a child really wants to go to public school it is  &quot;not supportive of child led learning or unschooling  to  keep them out and &quot;unschool&quot; .<br/>
Still curious though to hear from  other parents  in similar circumstances.<br/>

unhappy. <br/>

that we found a better way, NOT because we were so disappointed in school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-363555576">Same experience here.<br/>
<br/>
My son wasn&#39;t happy in school, but I had no real complaints about the school or the teachers then.  In fact, they were very cooperative with me most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
That was when I realized that it wasn&#39;t the teachers, it was the system that needed fixing, and since I couldn&#39;t do that, I decided homeschooling was the better option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510867162">I didn&#39;t put them in in the first place when there was no real issue.  I<br/>
always liked school well enough and had a great GPA.  Our local schools are<br/>
said to be good.  My kids didn&#39;t have any issues that were red flags for<br/>
being problems in school.  I didn&#39;t keep them home because I thought school<br/>
was bad.  I liked the idea of letting them learn at their own pace and<br/>
thought 2 students to one teacher sounded good.  (That was before<br/>
unschooling)  It wasn&#39;t until I began homeschooling and learned more about<br/>
education, homeschooling, and unschooling, that I began to think of all the<br/>
negative aspects of school.<br/>

Our older kids all went to school, but I knew before I even conceived Lars<br/>
that he would be unschooled.  It&#39;s certainly because of the bad aspects of<br/>
school, but it&#39;s much more because of the positives of unschooling.  I&#39;m<br/>
especially glad we unschooled now that I know much better &quot;who he is&quot;, and<br/>
that he would have been nearly destroyed by school like his older brother<br/>
was.  But I didn&#39;t know that then.<br/>

Tara was almost 9 when Joseph was born. She was in the 4th grade. Had been<br/>
going to school since she was 4. Aside from being shy and not &quot;social&quot; with<br/>
the other children, she did well. Not saying those 1st two things were good<br/>
for her but that was when school for me was the only way to go. I knew of<br/>
nothing else and it was a &quot;great&quot; school.<br/>
<br/>
I planned on going back to work when Joseph was 3 months old. My boss was<br/>
calling me every day waiting. When he was 2 months old, I knew the doubts I<br/>
had since he was born about working were not going away. Fortunately for us,<br/>
my husband felt the same way. I had stayed with Tara until I &quot;had&quot; to put<br/>
her in school. This was a whole new life for me and the kids. Different<br/>
husband and a whole different way of living. Over the next year, I saw<br/>
Tara&#39;s spark start to flicker. It was school that was doing it to her. 5th<br/>
grade was the start of so much more for her. By 7 & 8th grade, my husband<br/>
and I were at that school at least once a month. Not because of Tara but<br/>
because of the teachers. But we had made our decision by the time Joseph was<br/>
2. And by then Sierra was 1.  So we knew we would homeschool really before<br/>
the trouble started. We just knew we could raise happier children without<br/>
school. We knew our children would learn so much more by being with us most<br/>
of the time as opposed to strangers with &quot;good&quot; intentions. There was a lot<br/>
more to it that strengthened our decision as time went on, but for us there<br/>
was just no other way. We couldn&#39;t understand giving our children up to so<br/>
many different people at such a young age for such a long time.<br/>
