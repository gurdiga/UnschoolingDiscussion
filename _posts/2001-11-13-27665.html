<div id="ygrps-yiv-369764499">Hi Sandra and All,<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for a couple of months now and I&#39;m enjoying many of the conversations. I always look forward to reading Sandra&#39;s posts and I appreciate the time she takes. When I hear you saying what I think, it makes even more sense to me. I&#39;ve met very few people who are respectful of my relationship with my kids. Many feel that I&#39;m shirking my responsibilities, and that I&#39;m not giving them the tools they need for &quot;Success&quot;, etc.... I&#39;ve listened to what the Taking Children Seriously movement is talking about and although I think a lot of it is interesting and important, there&#39;s something missing for me in their philosophy. The method they use to communicate feels a little bizarre for me too, though I understand, that they&#39;re just trying to avoid what often happens on this list, when members feel personally judged.<br/>
It&#39;s interesting how they control the list and the way members communicate all the while claiming to believe in total free will. Anyway, I feel comfortable here and I&#39;m looking forward to reading and contributing. <br/>
<br/>
My kids also know the difference between good stuff and junk, not that I always agree! They know the difference between healthy food and junk food, feeling good and feeling sick. I can&#39;t count the times other children, who have not developed critical thinking skills of their own, come to our place and eat cookies, candy and Popsicles until their sick (when I think about it now I&#39;m realizing that their parents probably blame me!), because they can&#39;t handle the responsibilities that come with the freedom to choose. My kids are all pretty good cooks too. My Dylan,11 makes a beautiful salad, Daisy 7 loves to bake and Sky 18 can cook anything from BBQed burgers to boeuf bourguignonne. Daisy has a sweet tooth but she knows enough to fill up with healthy stuff before she indulges etc... My kids don&#39;t go to school because they don&#39;t want to. They&#39;ve all tried it, the oldest one has tried a couple of times and he&#39;s currently taking Culinary Arts 1 at a local college. Culinary arts and housekeeping are two of the main focuses of our home study program so I&#39;m not surprised that he&#39;s choosing to sharpen these skills :~) <br/>

  &lt;&lt; Do kids watch action because that&#39;s what programmers are<br/>
<br/>
  feeding them or because that&#39;s how they make sense of the world?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Or because the &quot;non-action&quot; dramas that some adults love are in NO way of <br/>
  interest to kids?  Why would a four year old boy watch Casablanca?  It&#39;s <br/>
  people talking.  And they&#39;re talking about things that aren&#39;t even happening <br/>
  onscreen.  Comparing all the chick flicks, past and present, to all the <br/>
  cartoons and saying &quot;more violent&quot; about cartoons is not scientifically <br/>
  valid.   It&#39;s comparing apples and 2x4&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; It&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
  kind of hard not to be aware of what a child is getting from TV when we are<br/>
<br/>
  living right beside them. Sometimes kids get scared. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  A friend my age told me of sneaking up behind his dad&#39;s chair, when he was <br/>
  little, and watching Frankenstein, the old Boris Karloff one, when it was on <br/>
  TV one night.  The dad said &quot;GO TO BED.&quot;  But he stayed and watched and it <br/>
  scared him badly.  He didn&#39;t know it from a news show.<br/>
<br/>
  Now his dad was a sadistic violent kind of guy, but IF (just if) since the <br/>
  kid had already seen some of it, the dad (who was watching it) could have <br/>
  invited said kid to sit on his lap, and he could have told him it was an all <br/>
  made-up story, that no such thing could really happen, and talk about <br/>
  movie-making and make-up, it could have been a really nice session between <br/>
  them, and the fright would have dissipated.<br/>
<br/>
  The model of a school kid zoning out in front of a TV for five hours and then <br/>
  not having studied his social studies which in turn inconveniences his <br/>
  teacher is a world away from my kids watching The Tick with me, and <br/>
  discussing literary references, or parodies of other movies and characters.<br/>
<br/>
  The report of the ideas of teachers about the effects of TV ring like <br/>
  duct-tape bells.  I see my own kids, and others I know, who can turn the TV <br/>
  on when they want, and I see them turning it off as often as they turn it on. <br/>
  I see them learning, and asking intelligent questions, and NOT being average <br/>
  or lowest common denominator kinds of people, but interesting, thoughtful, <br/>
  funny, bright people.  They live without shame and fear, while some other <br/>
  families who hope to save their children from some incidental fears or ill <br/>
  effects of TV do themselves bring shame and fear into the family situation.<br/>
<br/>
  My kids aren&#39;t getting shame and fear from me, and neither are they getting <br/>
  it from the TV.  I&#39;m not having to be dishonest about the horrors and evils <br/>
  of TV, I&#39;m not having to shame them for even having thought to have wanted <br/>
  some of it.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes there&#39;s some junk on TV.  There&#39;s junk at the candy counter too.  There&#39;s <br/>
  junk in books too.  There&#39;s junk on the internet too.  My kids don&#39;t dig <br/>
  through the trash, they don&#39;t hunt up junk, they don&#39;t eat crap.  WHY?  <br/>
  Because it&#39;s not good.  Given a choice between something good and something <br/>
  stupid, why would they choose &quot;stupid&quot;?  (Although when the Simpsons had <br/>
  Judge Judy jokes this week, Marty was able to tell me which parts indicated <br/>
  Judge Judy which ways, because I haven&#39;t seen her but he has.)<br/>
