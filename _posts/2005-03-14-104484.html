<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466845756">-=-=-=-I see the danger in defining unschooling too narrowly, as well.  But  EVERYONE is unschooling is far, far to broad, and I don&#39;t find a single thing  that rings true in the statement.-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re asked all the time to define unschooling---then get blasted when we DO! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The problem comes in when one thinks of unschooling AS learning, which it IS. But learning isn&#39;t necessarily unschooling. But when you read Ned&#39;s statement that &quot;Unschooling is living your life as if school didn&#39;t exist,&quot; is becomes more clear. Unschooling happens ONLY without the presence of school and that which imitates school.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re testing and grading and teaching, that&#39;s NOT unschooling. Even if you&#39;re learning outSIDE that environment.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, EVERYONE learns. Even WITH school. In spite of school. But it&#39;s the ABSENCE of school that makes it unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When I first read Sue&#39;s post, I had two immediate and simultaneous reactions: <br/>
<br/>
YES!<br/>
and<br/>
NO WAY!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Yes! in that I know that all people learn---even while in school. It&#39;s what we DO. But that&#39;s not necessarily unschooling (we&#39;d have to do away with the schooled portion).<br/>
<br/>
No way! in that....well, because unschooling means no school. Unschooling ---the term and its definition---wouldn&#39;t even exist without the presence of school: if there were no school, we wouldn&#39;t have unschooling. Kind of like the first few zillion (or is it just 6,000? &lt;g&gt;) years that man&#39;s been learning.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as we get rid of all the schools, we won&#39;t need the term &quot;unschooling&quot; anymore. Until then, unschoolers are those people who do their learning without schools. Schooled children get to learn outside of schools in their free time.<br/>

I do believe that unschooling *is* simply honoring the<br/>
natural instinct to learn, plus time.Â <br/>
<br/>
And I add:<br/>
<br/>
As a brand new unschooler who just discovered the concept about two months<br/>
ago (it felt like coming home) I really loved Aimee&#39;s  definition.  It seems<br/>
to me, after learning all I know about unschooling from Sandra&#39;s site, you<br/>
all, and the various links, books, etc. that you all have recommended as I<br/>
lurked; that unschooling is &quot;a lifestyle of learning, free from compulsion.&quot;<br/>
Unschooling CAN mean being taught - as in a gardening class, guitar lessons,<br/>
or organized sports.  It can even mean being taught things that are<br/>
kid-specific  (T-ball).  It can mean being taught by a mom or dad (when the<br/>
teaching is not compulsory (done regardless of interest or responsiveness).<br/>
It can include choosing not to be taught by anyone else.  Unschooling is not<br/>
the absence of being taught  - it is the presence of TRUE freedom and choice<br/>
in the matter. I think this is why so many unschoolers wish for a better<br/>
term for what they do (life learning?).  Does this mean that an unschooler<br/>
can choose to be schooled and still be an  unschooler??  I&#39;d say giving up<br/>
the choice over what one will learn and even more so,  giving up the time<br/>
(see Aimee&#39;s quote above) would negate the idea of unschooling.  Entering a<br/>
specific sort of school (such as cosmetology) seems different.  You&#39;re<br/>
choosing to devote more of your time to this specific kind of learning about<br/>
this specific subject.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful. It got a bit muddy at the end. :)<br/>

Your assertion is that learning outside of school = unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what people are disagreeing with.<br/>
<br/>
This new statement further muddies your trying to make for unschooling <br/>
by suggesting that someone can be in school and fit the category <br/>
&quot;without school&quot; when they are learning something other than what the <br/>
teachers are teaching them. If that were true then there would be no <br/>
need for deschooling. There would be no difference between <br/>
unschooled-all-their-lives kids and kids who attend school for 11 years <br/>
and unschool for their &quot;senior&quot; year. There would be no need for this <br/>
list to help people get past the conditioning they&#39;ve picked up in <br/>
school (and society) about how it&#39;s necessary to learn.<br/>
<br/>
School affects schooled kids whether they&#39;re physically in the building <br/>
or physically doing school work or not.<br/>

Ding, ding, ding! You win. Much more concise definition that gets at the essence of what <br/>
my wordier one meant to convey.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! Love that.<br/>
<br/>
Julie<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Your comments about unschooling and choosing to use school ring true. My daughter <br/>
is technically unschooled (she is free to self-educate as she chooses) but she chose to <br/>
attend school part time for three subjects she wanted in school. Like Sandra suggested, I <br/>
don&#39;t make her &quot;do&quot; anything, she can skip if she likes, I don&#39;t care about her grades, yada, <br/>
yada.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with &quot;choosing&quot; school, even part time, is that the school itself is an <br/>
environment that is highly coercive and demeaning to learners. So you &quot;pay a price&quot; for <br/>
that kind of &quot;teaching&quot; whereas in other places we&#39;ve taken lessons (like acting school, sax <br/>
lessons, learning to shoot rifles, vintage dance) we have not felt that same kind of coercive <br/>
and condescending context that overbears, like it does in the public school.<br/>
<br/>
So I support what you said. There is a problem with *school* itself. Choosing to use it, <br/>
even part time, still means &quot;fighting off&quot; a kind of schoolish mentality and that takes daily <br/>
energy away from interest led learning, as I have witnessed in my own home.</div>

unschooling, it is REALLY helpful to not even talk about &quot;teaching&quot; or <br/>
&quot;being taught&quot; as if that equates to &quot;learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is important to deeply know that &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; are very <br/>
very different things - and there is a WHOLE lot of teaching going on <br/>
in this world which doesn&#39;t correspond to any learning and, vice versa, <br/>
a whole lot of learning going on in the world that doesn&#39;t correspond <br/>
to any teaching.<br/>
<br/>
When I took guitar lessons, I had a teacher. But my LEARNING didn&#39;t <br/>
come from the teacher. The teacher could have &quot;taught&quot; until she was <br/>
blue in the face - there was absolutely no way that her teaching <br/>
&quot;caused&quot; my learning. The learning happened inside me - inside my brain <br/>
and my finger muscles and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Because teachers take so much credit for children&#39;s learning, this <br/>
society equates &quot;teaching&quot; with &quot;learning&quot; and it is actually hard to <br/>
get out of that mindset. So - some of us recommend changing the <br/>
language used, whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
So - just for the purpose of understanding learning better, I don&#39;t say <br/>
my guitar teacher &quot;taught&quot; me to play guitar. She explained to me how <br/>
to read chord charts, she showed me how to hold my fingers, she <br/>
listened to me and gave suggestions, and so on. It is much more <br/>
specific and clear and less &quot;magical&quot; sounding when we say what the <br/>
&quot;teacher&quot; really did instead of using the words &quot;teach&quot; or &quot;taught.&quot; <br/>
Makes it far more clear that the learning is under the control of the <br/>
learner.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter just asked me how to do something in Microsoft Word. I <br/>
could say I am &quot;teaching&quot; her Microsoft Word. But better to say she&#39;s <br/>
learning to use it and that I showed her how to do some of it. It is <br/>
more accurate. And the SAME is true for any of those kinds of lessons <br/>
or courses - just a matter of organizational difference, not any <br/>
different when it comes to the learning part.<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
I have been reading bits and pieces of this thread.  I know for  myself, I <br/>
was schooled, never even homeschooled, and I did have interests  outside of <br/>
school and do think that I did learn outside of school.  <br/>
 <br/>
For me the difference is that I didn&#39;t place any value on the things I  <br/>
learned outside of school.  I thought the only place to learn anything  valuable <br/>
was in school, so that was the important stuff.  Anything else was  unimportant <br/>
and I was not encouraged to pursue those outside interests.  I  was encouraged <br/>
and rewarded for good grades and school work.  And that is  how my life went. <br/>
 I chose a profession, nursing, because that was  valued.  <br/>
 <br/>
I remember having passing interests in gardening, sewing, and  cooking.  But <br/>
was not encouraged to pursue these interests.   Horticulture class and Home EC <br/>
were not on my list of classes even, as I was on  the college bound track, no <br/>
time for those trivial classes.  Those were not  the classes that someone <br/>
headed for college took.  And college was the  place to be. So I lost interest in <br/>
those things for a while, and am only  now getting back to what really <br/>
interests me.<br/>
 <br/>
For my boys, they will never feel that.  They are able to explore  whatever <br/>
they want.  They so not see anything in terms of college bound or  not.  It is <br/>
an interest that may lead to more or maybe not.  They  decide what is <br/>
important or not.  Their life will be different.  It  won&#39;t take them almost 40 years <br/>
to find their interests and be able to &quot;go for  it&quot;.  They will not see school <br/>
as where the &quot;important information  is&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
For me it is what school does to your spirit.  Not if you learned  anything <br/>
outside of school.  It is the importance you place on it.   School conditions <br/>
you to place little value on what you learn outside of  school.  <br/>

 <br/>
Not only is it NOT nitpicking, it&#39;s the line between unschooling and  <br/>
schoolishness.<br/>
Anyone who never understands that will be wading in the school water  <br/>
forever.  <br/>
 <br/>
Still the winner for saddest thing I ever heard about homeschooling was  <br/>
someone who gushed that if you homeschool you&#39;ll be your child&#39;s only  teacher!!  <br/>
The idea that my child would learn nothing from anyone but me,  that ALL he <br/>
knew would have come from me, is horrifying.  What a  life-stunting wish that <br/>
was, to be one&#39;s child&#39;s only teacher.<br/>
 <br/>
Better, I think, to provide a child a life without teachers, a life full of  <br/>
learning and resources and people to answer HIS questions and to respond to <br/>
HIS  needs, where he is the learner and the options are his.<br/>

I  thought the only place to learn anything  valuable <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I figured out by the time I was 11 or 12 that the teachers were taking  <br/>
credit for things I learned in years before, or learned on my own outside of  <br/>
school.  What made it different for me than some kids whose interests were  horses <br/>
or cars or bottle cap collection was that my interests were history and  <br/>
geography and the history of words, and of clothes and music.  So in  school, I <br/>
knew more and could do better in class because of what I learned for  fun <br/>
outside.  And the teachers just BEAMED and patted themselves on the  head about how <br/>
much work they had done to make me so &quot;smart.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
But as I also had wanted to be a teacher since I was six and had Miss  <br/>
Tomlinson who was so much nicer to me than my mom was, it didn&#39;t bother me to  see <br/>
teacher-foibles. It was something I learned from.  And other teachers  KNEW <br/>
they weren&#39;t &quot;my teacher&quot; in one way or another, and gave me space and  resources <br/>
to learn more on my own, because they DID see it and were helpful to  me <br/>
about it.<br/>
 <br/>
School gave me an identity outside my family which was great for me.   They <br/>
gave me chances for success in a grades-and-test-scores way, and that was  <br/>
helpful for me.  Not until years later did I reflect deeply on the effect  of my <br/>
&quot;winning&quot; on so many other kids who might&#39;ve liked to have been first or  best <br/>
more often, but school created that competitive field, I didn&#39;t.  And  when I <br/>
did try to throw the curve (as a community service, at the request of  others <br/>
in my 9th grade science class) I got in trouble.<br/>
 <br/>
So when I was in the midst of much &quot;teaching&quot; I was clinically observing to  <br/>
see what kind of teacher I did and didn&#39;t want to be, and that goal of &quot;finish <br/>
 this and come back and teach&quot; lasted through college and some years more.   <br/>
I&#39;m glad some college education professor told me that there&#39;s no such action <br/>
as  &#39;teaching,&#39; the most you can do is facilitate learning.  And that seems as <br/>
 true as anything I&#39;ve ever heard, seen, tasted or felt.<br/>
