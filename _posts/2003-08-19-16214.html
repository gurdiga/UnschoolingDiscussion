<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Malls Of The Damned<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If Secular Consumerism is the new false religion, then its temple is the<br/>
&gt; Shopping Mall. This is where those deluded into Secular Consumerism go<br/>
&gt; and unwittingly take part in anti-Christian activities; this is where the<br/>
&gt; Santamas propaganda and indoctrination are distributed; this is where the<br/>
&gt; moral foundation of our society is being attacked; and this is where we<br/>
&gt; as Christians must go to battle for the souls of the unsaved against the<br/>
&gt; forces of Secularism.<br/>
&gt; &quot;But surely malls are just places of commerce, not deliberate attempts to<br/>
&gt; lead people away from Christ,&quot; you may be thinking to yourself.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately the facts point to the malls&#39; knowing complicity with the<br/>
&gt; cause of anti-Christian Secularism. Besides the complete lack of<br/>
&gt; Christian references in their so-called Christmas displays and<br/>
&gt; decorations (just try and find a Cross or depiction of the Baby Jesus<br/>
&gt; amongst all the Santas and snowmen and shiny balls), more subtle<br/>
&gt; subconscious suggestions of Secularism&#39;s anti-Christian stance can be<br/>
&gt; found by studying the names of common mall stores:<br/>
&gt; J.C. Penny - The J.C. makes us think of Jesus Christ, thus associating<br/>
&gt; our Lord with the lowest monetary value, the penny (even Judas valued Him<br/>
&gt; at 30 pieces of silver!). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wouldn&#39;t that be DIMES, not pennies?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sears - What the flesh of the damned does in Hell. It also sounds like<br/>
&gt; &quot;seers&quot;, Pagan mystics who engaged in occult premonitions. <br/>
&gt; Cinnabon - Sounds like &quot;Sin Upon&quot;. <br/>
&gt; Orange Julius - Named for the Pagan Emperor of Rome. This company&#39;s<br/>
&gt; mascot was once a devil, until they changed it to hide their true<br/>
&gt; intentions. <br/>
&gt; Hot Topic - A recent store aimed at children that openly sells devil<br/>
&gt; paraphernalia. Any guess as to why &quot;hot&quot; is in their name? <br/>
&gt; Hallmark Gold Crown Stores - Purveyors of Santamas tree ornaments<br/>
&gt; depicting anthropomorphized woodland creatures (reference to<br/>
&gt; Evolutionism) and Harry Potter merchandise. What notable person will have<br/>
&gt; a mark and wear crowns? [Rev. 13:16, 13:1] <br/>
&gt; Clearly there are ulterior motives evident. Even the word &quot;mall&quot; evokes<br/>
&gt; evilness being a homonym for &quot;maul&quot; - the violent rending of flesh - and<br/>
&gt; &quot;mal&quot; - Latin for &quot;bad&quot; and root for words like &quot;malicious&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &quot;malevolent&quot;. These Malls of the Damned - open even on Sunday! - are no<br/>
&gt; innocent business centers, but active parties in the conspiracy to<br/>
&gt; promote Secularism.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny, I am an atheist AND I hate malls---how do they figure ME into the <br/>
equation?????<br/>

You&#39;re a backsliding atheist if you won&#39;t hie thee to the temple of <br/>
secularism.<br/>
The wrath of...<br/>
The secret star chamber of commerce...<br/>
Thy loving Master Card will gain interest in your absence? <br/>
There were ninety and nine at the mall, but the Master Card noticed that one <br/>
was missing...<br/>
