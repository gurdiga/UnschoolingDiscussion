<div id="ygrps-yiv-128866735">I&#39;m totally new to all this - and I found out about it thanks to that <br/>
article!<br/>
I&#39;d never heard of the term or concept of unschooling but, that&#39;s just the <br/>
way I&#39;ve always believed that we should learn. I just didn&#39;t know it was <br/>
legally possible under the homeschooling laws - I thought you had to be <br/>
signed up with somesort of school and have a set curriculim.<br/>
Both my kids are currently in a small private school in San Diego. I was <br/>
horribly unhappy with the public system and am now even more so with the <br/>
private! Thier rules and schedules are so rigid it makes me want to rebel! <br/>
My son&#39;s teacher this year has been so bad that several parents have pulled <br/>
thier children from the school and my son has developed a distaste for <br/>
school and learning. What kind of a teacher kills a child&#39;s thirst for <br/>
knowledge?!<br/>
I haven&#39;t taken them out yet because I haven&#39;t figured out yet how I&#39;m going <br/>
to pull this off as a single working parent. I have however, taken the first <br/>
step - I changed my career this year to become a travel agent so I could <br/>
take them all over the world - not just learn about it from books.<br/>
Any single working unschoolers out there? I could use some hints and advice.<br/>
<br/>
   ~ Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh I agree, and I had just told Mary and Michael how cool I thought they<br/>
were.  Ah well, who knows how things can be taken out of context.  The<br/>
other thing I noticed was the comments about the gaps in education some teen <br/>
unschoolers have.  Most everyone has gaps, especially us public schooled<br/>
adults, I have these great big huge gaps, holes in fact, where the information<br/>
just flowed in long enough to take the test and passed right back out!  <br/>
Sometimes<br/>
I feel like I know nothing (that schools think we should know anyhow!!!)  <br/>
Overall, I think it was a &quot;balanced&quot; article from a non unschooler <br/>
perspective.  It surely could have been worse!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332521938">I thought it was a pretty decent, balanced article, too, but was also <br/>
bothered by some of the quotes.  I thought it was kind of crazy when they <br/>
talked about the unschooled kids/teens having gaps.  They gave the Civil War <br/>
as an example.  I happen to have an 11 yr old who&#39;s obsessed with it and he <br/>
can&#39;t understand why most of the adults he tries to talk to about it seem to <br/>
know almost nothing...all adults who came out of our glorious, comprehensive <br/>
public schools.  I don&#39;t know where they&#39;re finding all these public school <br/>
graduates who don&#39;t have gaps in what they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to know.  <br/>
     I know a woman with a B.A. in Art who thought that the Vietnam war took <br/>
place immediately after WW2.  She is, of course, someone who came out of the <br/>
public school system.  I always ask, who is supposed to decide what an <br/>
&quot;educated&quot; person should know?  If it were up to me, I&#39;d like everyone to <br/>
read Thoreau, for example, and John Holt.  Someone else may feel that we <br/>
should all have good hands on survival skills.  And so on.  <br/>
     They act like there is one established body of knowledge that, of <br/>
course, all thinking people would agree everyone should know, but it&#39;s not <br/>
true.  The public schools themselves vary and change their minds regularly.  <br/>
And even if the knowledge does get covered and crammed down their throats to <br/>
pass a test, it&#39;s not remembered because they can&#39;t make the child care about <br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976277190">We watch what hubby&#39;s co-workers called the &quot;See How Dumb You Are Show&quot;<br/>
otherwise known as Jeopardy.  Now, I would say that 99.99999% of the<br/>
contestants are ps&#39;ers and the same goes for the other gameshows like &quot;Who<br/>
Wants To Be A Millionaire&quot; and &quot;Twenty-One&quot;.  The kidlets find it amazing<br/>
how &quot;ignorant&quot; some (o.k., in their NSHO, most) of the contestants are.  I<br/>
get at least a half-dozen questions during every show &quot;but didn&#39;t they<br/>
learn that in school?&quot; and other questions of that ilk.<br/>
<br/>
So, when we have been asked (and it has been rare, I might add) the second<br/>
most asked question (socialization being #1), &quot;Don&#39;t you worry about gaps<br/>
in their learning?&quot;  I give them one-of-those looks and tell them I&#39;m<br/>
definately NOT worried about it.  When one lady got really pushy, youngest<br/>
kidlet (7) piped up with &quot;We did better than those kids on Jeopardy and way<br/>
better than most of the big people on Millioniare.&quot;   (she has a low<br/>
threshhold for nosey people &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
