Unfortunately that&#39;s just not feasible right now and probably won&#39;t be for<br/>
quite a while.  We are in the middle of some major interior remodeling on<br/>
our new home, and my husband is gearing up to start a major project at<br/>
work.  We are also in the middle of an adoption homestudy (which eats up<br/>
time as well as money) and our new daughter (when she comes home) will need<br/>
to stay here for a while and settle in.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone wants to come and see Yellowstone and Glacier Parks in the<br/>
spring??  Think Bison, Moose and Elk calving, wildflowers, bear cubs,<br/>
geysers, some snow...<br/>
That is, if you can stand the dust from our remodel.  Anyone have teens or<br/>
pre-teens they want to bring to do interior sheetrock, electrical,<br/>
plumbing, painting and decorating or exterior landscaping?  How about child<br/>
care?  (LOL)  As you can imagine, with the two babes underfoot, not a lot<br/>
gets done on the house in a timely manner!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, any of you Floridians live near Tampa?  I have a sister there<br/>
who is a doctor. :)<br/>

I used to live in Tampa, my brother and sister live in Tarpon Springs, my dad <br/>
lives in Dunedin.  So, we travel there pretty often.  LOVE Busch Gardens!<br/>
We would love to come visit, but our work will prohibit that right now.  <br/>
About the only way we get to travel is at Christmas thru New Years .  But we <br/>
will keep this in mind.<br/>
