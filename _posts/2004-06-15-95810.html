<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279274584">I am going to see what got my son asking the question.  I&#39;m curious <br/>
if it was used on one of his t.v. programs (he usually watches kids <br/>
channels only).  or was it a piece of literature?  The only b / w <br/>
movie we have watched lately was Casablanca.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I know what kind of movies this genre belongs too.  DOA <br/>
sounds distinctly familiar. Perhaps we should rent one or two to <br/>
illustrate them for him.  <br/>
<br/>
However, he is suseptible to moods and perhaps the genre itself is <br/>
not quite appropriate to him.  If the movie is too dark it may be <br/>
something to research first and explain the  styling and plot.  He <br/>
likes these discussions and I value them because they are so rare.<br/>
