&lt;&lt; And like it has been said before I&#39;m glad YOU got it, no explanation <br/>
needed, <br/>
but there are over a thousand people here.  It&#39;s not wrong to say you don&#39;t <br/>
believe in whipping babies or buying a rod to beat your child and that you <br/>
don&#39;t want associated with them.  It&#39;s just NOT.<br/>

No, it is not wrong to say you don&#39;t believe in it. I never said it was wrong <br/>
but why don&#39;t you try arguing that thought with people that do believe in it <br/>
rather than waste the time here? Or is it that you like repeating yourself <br/>
over and over and over? Please don&#39;t even go there!<br/>
