 </span></blockquote>Your close here, Brenda.  When a E-flat instrument player (alto sax, for <br/>
example) plays a &#39;C&#39; on her sax, a piano player would strike an E-flat to <br/>
get the same pitch.  Therefore, when an alto sax player is reading music <br/>
written for a C instrument, she has to transpose it up (I think) a minor <br/>
third in order to play the same pitches that are written down.  Does that <br/>
explain it?  That&#39;s my best shot.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28607264">I always thought transposition meant that when a piece is written in one key and you had to move it into another key, the whole score was transposed.<br/>
<br/>
I never realized it was so much more than that, probably because I never played a transposing instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your explanation.  I had looked it up because Sandra had me baffled and realized then that we were both right.  A B flat instrument can play a &quot;c&quot;, but it is written as a different note...and a writen &quot;c&quot; is played as a b flat.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, isn&#39;t it true that the transpositions for one instrument would be the same? In other words, no matter what score of music you are playing the &quot;c&quot; would sound as a b flat?  So, as long as you are playing that single instrument, the notations in the music will have a consistant meaning, even if its not the same meaning as another instrument?<br/>
<br/>
Gosh I hope I&#39;m making some kind of sense.  I&#39;m not feeling well today.<br/>

  Did we just make a circle?  Is this what you meant originally when you said math was like  music?  Or wasn&#39;t that you....(sigh)..I can&#39;t remember anymore :o).<br/>

If I&#39;m understanding you correctly, yes.  A French horn will always *sound*<br/>

playing a part written for horn in something other than F.  That gets more<br/>
