<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556999146">Okay y&#39;all.  Please help me out here.  Okay... NO ONE is more surprised about <br/>
my &quot;unschooling&quot; than me!  I had every intention of making my kids sit and <br/>
school at the appropriate age and everytime I would begin to go that way, my <br/>
heart cried out to me to not change a thing.  So, I am not educated on what <br/>
unschooling is.... I just know that we do it.  My main question is this.  Do you <br/>
all just truly let your kids live out their days?  Do you only participate when <br/>
it is a natural participation?  Okay... like my boys wake up somewhere between <br/>
7-8 am.  They watch TV until they feel like doing something else.  Usually, I <br/>
go and exercise or something.  Then they go out and play... come in... grab a <br/>
book to look up something that they saw or argued about while they were <br/>
outside (they usually look stuff up to settle things  : )   They play... they try <br/>
to figure stuff out... they eat... sometimes they prepare their own food... my <br/>
6 yr old does laundry... dusts... vaccuums... he is a worker bee without being <br/>
asked.  My 8 yr old is not very motivated.  When the little one cleans, the <br/>
older one usually reads... like a Magic Tree House Bood or lately, Jackie Chan. <br/>
 Of course we are interacting daily with the world as we are out and about.  <br/>
I went through a &quot;Saxon Math&quot; phase for a short time, but it was SOOOO <br/>
unnatural for us.  My little one LOVES workbooks... my older one does the math one I <br/>
have now without fuss... because I feel that I need to know that he is making <br/>
progress so that I can &quot;prove&quot; that he is making progress if asked to.  <br/>
Okay... so, my question is this... Is unschooling just really letting the kids do <br/>
whatever comes naturally to them in a day?  I mean, after all if I&#39;m gonna do it <br/>
I might as well do it right, right?   : )   ~Kris<br/>

<br/>
This sounds like a perfectly wonderful unschooling day to me. I&#39;d <br/>
join in where it looks fun and if it&#39;s appreciated by the boys. <br/>
<br/>
I kind of look at my job as a facilitator, mentor and maybe even <br/>
cruise director. I throw them ideas, bring home cool books and toys, <br/>
show them interesting websites, let them know if there&#39;s an eclipse, <br/>
help them sign up for classes they want to take..that kind of thing.<br/>

You&#39;re right that this is *your* need and not his.  But if he&#39;s <br/>
enjoying the books, I&#39;d just let him be. I wouldn&#39;t insist he do them <br/>
though.<br/>

Yes that&#39;s it!!!! Live life every day and go in search of whatever interests<br/>
you if it isn&#39;t in your own back yard. As long as it&#39;s fun, then it&#39;s<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I want to say &quot;yes,&quot; but the picture you have in your head might not be the <br/>
same as the one in mine.<br/>
<br/>
Do you only participate when &gt; it is a natural participation? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Natural&quot;&#39;s a hard concept in this day and age, among people who are <br/>
discussing things electronically.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
Today is Marty&#39;s second of five days at the Junior Police Academy.  They had <br/>
to be there at 7:00 a.m. in uniform with sunscreen already on.   I don&#39;t <br/>
consider that natural, but I woke up at 5:50 and took him anyway!  (Half hour <br/>
drive.)<br/>
<br/>
Just as we got there, he realized he had forgotten the lunch I made him.  I <br/>
realized Tuesday was the day they were going an additional almost-half-mile by <br/>
bus to a remote site for a rapelling tower and driving-range day, and bomb <br/>
squad demo.<br/>
<br/>
None of that is natural.<br/>
<br/>
SO I got a map and directions, came home, waited a while and at 8:00 woke <br/>
Holly up to see if she wanted to go with me to see Marty rapel.  She usually gets <br/>
up at 10:30.  She was pretty agreeable and I told her I&#39;d ask her again in <br/>
five or ten minutes.<br/>
<br/>
3:10, we just got back.  AND we never got to see Marty rapel.  But Holly got <br/>
to ride in a chase car, siren and lights,chasing two other cars, going <br/>
through/between cones, swerving...  (Marty was getting out of one of the cars when we <br/>
pulled up.)  We saw the bomb squad stuff.  They blew a few things up, way out <br/>
in the desert there.  We saw lots of other kids rapel.  Saw the kids drill <br/>
and march and run.   When we left a big ladder truck had just shown up.  I heard <br/>
they were going to give the kids a ride and talk about the relationship <br/>
between the fire department and police department.<br/>
<br/>
If Marty had remembered his lunch, I would have come home, read this list, <br/>
done some laundry...<br/>
<br/>
It was a good yet totally unexpected and unplanned adventure.  We had put on <br/>
sunscreen and taken water which was good.  We were out there four hours (not <br/>
counting driving  time, and for the former Albuquerque folk, it&#39;s past the city <br/>
firing/archery range, west of the volcanos, beyond the airport that&#39;s out <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is unschooling just really letting the kids do <br/>
whatever comes naturally to them in a day?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think if no days are that way, there&#39;s a problem, but if ALL days are that <br/>
way that&#39;s also a problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Balance.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there should be something exciting and different to stimulate them <br/>
and give them access to sights and sounds not available at home.  But not <br/>
EVERY day.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some typical days collected here:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your day sounds so interesting, of course without the math thingy added at <br/>
the end.  I truly let my boys live out their day.  They ask questions and ask <br/>
for help on certain things and I may offer different things that I think they <br/>
might be interested in.  Or different events that might be coming up in the <br/>
community.  They can say yes or no.  I also have my interests as well.  While they <br/>
are doing their thing I will be working on a quilt or gardening etc.<br/>

<br/>
I am soooo happy you asked this.  The same exact question has been <br/>
going through my head and I was just thinking today how to post it.  <br/>
My boys are 2 and almost 5 and pretty independent.  Generally, the <br/>
boys play, they have been watching TV at will lately, sometimes we <br/>
head to the park or backyard or try to squeeze in activites or play <br/>
dates.  I always worry I am not offering enough.  Especially since <br/>
they play with action figures all day and pretty much engage in <br/>
imaginative play ALL day.  There is no art work, sometimes blocks, <br/>
but it is all in their heads.  So some days I worry it is enough?  <br/>
How is the reading and math going to come in &lt;s&gt;? Some days we do <br/>
more than others.  Anyway, I was happy to see you ask this question <br/>
as the answers pertain so much to me as well :)<br/>

That&#39;s a kind of art, and it&#39;s an element of writing, and of playwriting and <br/>

<br/>
Well, isn&#39;t that what everyone does anyway?   Schooled kids just have<br/>
others telling them what the days should look like.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan decides his own days.   I might have errands to run, or things I<br/>
really like to do and I invite him along.   I think of things I know<br/>
he&#39;ll enjoy and offer them.   I make as many things available and<br/>
possible for him as I can and from that, and whatever else he can devise,<br/>
he is living every day the way he likes. <br/>
<br/>
 ***Do you only participate when <br/>

<br/>
I participate when he want&#39;s my participation.  I&#39;m always here, I&#39;m<br/>
always available to answer questions, listen to a story or look at a<br/>
spider.     If by participate you mean do I schedule his time for a<br/>
workbook while I supervise, then no.  I participate in the life he&#39;s<br/>
living with us everyday.   I don&#39;t participate in interfering with his<br/>
life in schoolish ways.    I play games, jump on the trampoline, swim,<br/>
hike, watch movies.  I participate naturally in what we both enjoy. <br/>

in Columbus, and on the same night we were to pick up my grandpa from <br/>

scruffy Nick Nolte gave me a shoulder hug, a kiss on the cheek, and <br/>
an autograph. LOL One of my first crushes in junior high was a Nolte <br/>
look alike, and my dh when young, looked like Nick Nolte, blonde and <br/>
deepset blue eyes. Almost like a young Decaprio, but stockier LOL<br/>
<br/>
My other brush was with Rob Schneider at Bob Evans near Port Columbus <br/>
when Megan(10) was a year old. He was there with a very tall, pretty <br/>
girl, and I never realized how short he was. I knew him from SNL, and <br/>
he gave me an autograph that said to the Angela-meister. He was just <br/>
in a movie recently that he played a sorrority girl.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934846649">Well, okay.<br/>
<br/>
When we lived in Montana, Andi McDowell went to the same church we did.  She<br/>
used her real name, Rose Qualley.  That&#39;s still how I think of her.<br/>
<br/>
Tim was born just after we moved there, and I always sat in the back row at<br/>
church so that I could make the quick escape when Tim started fussing.  The<br/>
Qualley&#39;s place was about half an hour from the church, I think, and they<br/>
often arrived just as things were getting going, or a couple minutes late.<br/>
So they sat in the back row quite a lot, too.  Rose loved to hold Tim, she<br/>
said she was going through baby withdrawl with her baby, Sarah Margaret,<br/>
getting so big at three.<br/>
<br/>
My other wonderful memory of her is the day she showed up to church in a<br/>
linen suit that looked like it had been made for her.  Probably had.<br/>
Gorgeous outfit, and it looked like she had just picked it up off the floor<br/>
of her closet that morning, it was so wrinkled.  The crowning touch was that<br/>
she&#39;d just obviously gotten out of the shower before church, because her<br/>
long hair was still wet and dripping down her back.<br/>
<br/>
I loved her for being so real, and she was so sweet to my son.<br/>
