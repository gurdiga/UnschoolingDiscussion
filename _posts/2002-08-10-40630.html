my kids love a book called phonics pathways, and a reading exercise book <br/>
that goes along w/ it called pyramid-it is a game! they have a great time w/ <br/>
it and v&#92;bring it to me to do w/ them---about 35.00 for both of them i <br/>
think. i found them in &quot;the well trained mind&quot;<br/>
good luck!<br/>

&gt; &gt; OK, so my point was that the state in MA puts requirements on <br/>
&gt;homeschoolers<br/>
&gt; &gt; that some homeschoolers fulfill by lying about their plans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You imply I lie when I send in my ed plan. How do you know? Have you been <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;my home? Have you compared my unschooling and my ed plan? Carol Narigon&#39;s<br/>
&gt;letter says exactly what I&#39;m doing. So what would be the purpose of<br/>
&gt;representing what *I* and what all MA unschoolers do as a lie? (Have you<br/>
&gt;been to their homes too? Have you seen their ed plans?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do these broadbrush misrepresentations of MA homeschooers and the<br/>
&gt;Bryants help anyone here unschool better? Your rhetoric may make for some<br/>
&gt;wonderfully scary, heroic stories around the campfire but in the light of<br/>
&gt;day they don&#39;t line up with the real live flesh and blood people I know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Bryants did<br/>
&gt; &gt; not accept forced lying, preferring to be truthful and to expect decent<br/>
&gt; &gt; treatment by the state authorities. Instead, the state refused to accept<br/>
&gt; &gt; honesty and insisted that they lie in order to be free.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again, inflamatory and misrepresentative. Noble homeschoolers against the<br/>
&gt;evil state? Not. People taking a stand for something they believed in? I<br/>
&gt;hope so. But taking a stand or believing in something doesn&#39;t make someone<br/>
&gt;automatically right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s no where near as noble to gather the state&#39;s homeschoolers together to<br/>
&gt;get the regulations changed, is it? It&#39;s the people who get shot who get<br/>
&gt;cheered and held up as heroes. *I&#39;m* not cheering. Though I do cheer for <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;quiet ones in the state group who are politcally active for homeschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Bryants are taking one small step, at huge personal expense and <br/>
&gt;risk, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; order to help ALL homeschoolers everywhere, and you say they should cave <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; to a bad regulation supported by a vindictive and stupid judge?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Funny, they didn&#39;t ask me if I thought that was a good way to help. And I<br/>
&gt;think there was a general feeling they may have harmed more than they<br/>
&gt;helped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re basically saying the homeschoolers of MA are too blind, ignorant and<br/>
&gt;like scared sheep to be able to understand the smoke that&#39;s in their own<br/>
&gt;state. That you who see so much clearer know that every puff of smoke is<br/>
&gt;hiding a ranging inferno about to burst free. That insults every <br/>
&gt;politically<br/>
&gt;active homeschooler in MA.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let us MA people fight our own fights without underinformed inflammatory<br/>
&gt;commentary from passers by, okay? Or if you feel your words need to be<br/>
&gt;heard, then feel free to post at<br/>

&gt;(And by now you should have read the &quot;A gentle nudge ...&quot; post. It might<br/>
&gt;help to reread it if you still feel continuing this would help my daughter<br/>
&gt;explore the world better, or would help someone who wants that Saxon 5/6 to<br/>
&gt;spend her money on something that would bring joy to her son.)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;We are contemplating buying Hooked on Phonics for Brittany.  I looked up<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;the info. on the official web site & it is $299.99 + 27.50 shipping &<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;handling. YIKES!  Do you know of any other places we could buy it?  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;there was a store around that sold it at least we could save the <br/>
&gt;shipping<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;& handling. Also, do you know anyone who has used it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;YIKES! is right. Believe me when I tell you it is NOT worth the money and<br/>
&gt;Brittany does NOT need it to learn to read.  Those commercials make their<br/>
&gt;program sound so fun and easy, but really it&#39;s just tedium in a box. My<br/>
&gt;Casey got sucked in by those commercials once and asked me to get her that<br/>
&gt;program. We borrowed it from the library. She was bored in one day. She was<br/>
&gt;NOT however bored with learning to read. Just the simplistic phonics only<br/>
&gt;approach that this system was using.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We had much more fun and lots of success using a playful, relaxed and <br/>
&gt;varied<br/>
&gt;approach. Everything in that expensive phonics program can be found much<br/>
&gt;better in real life. There are books from the library, blocks, magnetic<br/>
&gt;letters, workbooks from the grocery (for playing, NOT enforcing of course),<br/>
&gt;games like Scrabble and Boggle, computer games, magazines, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would suggest your local library as one of the best resources around. If<br/>
&gt;you feel a need to brush up on those phonics rules for yourself (so you can<br/>
&gt;help Brittany), there are tons of books on the subject. And all for free!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Life is good.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wasn&#39;t Cathy just answering someone&#39;s question about the two different<br/>
&gt; &gt; creation accounts to be found in Genesis? I don&#39;t believe this post was <br/>
&gt;an<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s the way I took it.<br/>

&gt;And I know I read somewhere that there&#39;s a 3rd account that&#39;s different <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;those 2 that&#39;s deeper into the Old Testament. I think I read it in Kenneth<br/>
&gt;Davis&#39;s Don&#39;t Know Much About the Bible. I was sure I owned that but I must<br/>
&gt;have borrowed it from the library.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, look at it this way. The ads make it look like it&#39;s fun for the kids.<br/>
&gt;And it might be. But how much are you willing to spend on a fun way to do<br/>
&gt;something that will happen naturally for free? How much would you have paid<br/>
&gt;for a fun program to help her to walk?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think I ended up paying about $5. $20 for the 100 Easy Lessons which I<br/>
&gt;sold last year for about $15. (And it didn&#39;t work either because my <br/>
&gt;daughter<br/>
&gt;had 0 interest.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What you&#39;re really buying is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) a sense of peace that she&#39;ll learn to read. This is preying on <br/>
&gt;groundless<br/>
&gt;fears. As an unschooler in an environment where reading is naturally fun <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;useful she *will* learn to read. It may be tomorrow. It may be 6 years from<br/>
&gt;now. (Unless you put her in school where life isn&#39;t natural and there are<br/>
&gt;major road blocks to learning to read. (Like expecting her to do something<br/>
&gt;she isn&#39;t developmentally ready for yet.) So for parents with kids in <br/>
&gt;school<br/>
&gt;the fears aren&#39;t quite so groundless.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) *Maybe* early reading. Maybe. Though I&#39;d be more inclined to believe the<br/>
&gt;kids who read early with phonics programs are the ones who would have read<br/>
&gt;early to begin with. And though being able to read before school starts <br/>
&gt;gets<br/>
&gt;cheered, what does it really mean? No one can tell the difference between <br/>
&gt;an<br/>
&gt;adult who read at 3 and an adult who read at 7. (I&#39;d extend that to 13 for<br/>
&gt;an unschooler but a later reader in school might be demoralized by the<br/>
&gt;intervention and end up not liking to read or be convinced he can&#39;t. Sandra<br/>
&gt;has been collecting stories of later readers at<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a> I think the most important thing to realize <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;terms of calming fears is that a 13 yo new reader is *not* 7 years behind.<br/>
&gt;They&#39;ll be indistinguishable from their peers pretty quickly.) Learning<br/>
&gt;through reading is *different* not better than learning by doing or <br/>
&gt;learning<br/>
&gt;by watching. Unless you&#39;re in school where learning is *only* avialble<br/>
&gt;through reading and listening. Then otherwise endowed kids are severly<br/>
&gt;handicapped. That doesn&#39;t need to be true at home. We can adapt the<br/>
&gt;environment to the kid rather than the kid to the environment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you still think you&#39;d like it, first check your library or through<br/>
&gt;interlibrary loan. Just ask your librarian to search. That should be free.<br/>
&gt;(Or a nominal fee. I think one library in our system charges a quarter for<br/>
&gt;each request.) Even if they don&#39;t have a regular system in place, most<br/>
&gt;libraries will call around and try to locate what you want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s some at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.half.com">http://www.half.com</a> You&#39;ll need to read and ask questions<br/>
&gt;of the sellers and perhaps search the internet to figure out what you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;getting since some of the sets are a few years old. (And to make sure the<br/>
&gt;seller has listed his item under the correct heading!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.addall.com">http://www.addall.com</a> it will search 20 or so used book sites<br/>
&gt;(including half.com). It will be very helpful if you have the ISBN of the<br/>
&gt;one or ones you want since there&#39;s 15 of them and they&#39;re not listed by<br/>
&gt;publication date.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The full price one does have a 60 day money back guarantee. Not on the s&h<br/>
&gt;though. But *if* you get to keep the National Geographics on CD that comes<br/>
&gt;as a free gift, it might be worth it even if you never use it and just send<br/>
&gt;it back! ;-) (It&#39;s *way* not worth it if you don&#39;t send it back. You&#39;re <br/>
&gt;much<br/>
&gt;better off getting it used and then reselling. You&#39;ll lose less money!)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Should we disband social services because once in a while a <br/>
&gt;homeschoolien<br/>
&gt; &gt; family is pressured?  Should social services be a free market situation <br/>
&gt;too?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Domestic violence and child abuse (sexual abuse, burning as punishment,<br/>
&gt; &gt; broken limbs)--those are things I would like for the government to help<br/>
&gt; &gt; prevent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Governments don&#39;t PREVENT domestic violence or child abuse. How exactly<br/>
&gt;do you think a government would intervene before anything happened?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Court injunctions sometimes do it when it has gone to an extreme, but<br/>
&gt;the government never sees the inside of most households, and it should<br/>
&gt;stay that way!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My state, FLorida is notorious for its extremely ineffective social<br/>
&gt;services agency. THey keep changing the social service agency&#39;s name<br/>
&gt;(Dept. of Children and Families is what it is called now) so hopefully<br/>
&gt;people will forget the kids who were just murdered, neglected or hurt,<br/>
&gt;and keep funding them. On the other hand I have seen testimony by many,<br/>
&gt;many families whose lives were ruined by social service agencies who<br/>
&gt;tore them apart, ripped kids out of their parents home for no good<br/>
&gt;reason by their own opinions and put them into foster homes where they<br/>
&gt;were raped or abused and neglected.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BUt they change the name of their agency, rather than their<br/>
&gt;fundamentally flawed premise, that the government by intruding and<br/>
&gt;degrading the dignity and rights of its people can get them to &quot;act<br/>
&gt;better&quot;. Do you advocate spanking and punishing your child and use<br/>
&gt;threats of that to increase their judgment? It&#39;s just that the<br/>
&gt;government finds it very difficult to control people in a positive way.<br/>
&gt;I think that is what you are asking for. Punishment (though it has its<br/>
&gt;place) does not control people - it smashes them. A better idea of WHAT<br/>
&gt;to do for people and how to define roles, and helping people help<br/>
&gt;themselves is what is needed. That is a slow hard way to go for it means<br/>
&gt;one-on-one communication and understanding and if you don&#39;t really have<br/>
&gt;any idea how to help someone, you don&#39;t conceive it is possible - but it<br/>
&gt;is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Debbie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So social services are part of what citizens and residents want.   And <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t exist in societies without laws.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are contemplating buying Hooked on Phonics for Brittany.  I looked up <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;info. on the official web site & it is $299.99 + 27.50 shipping & handling.<br/>
&gt;YIKES!  Do you know of any other places we could buy it?  If there was a<br/>
&gt;store around that sold it at least we could save the shipping & handling.<br/>
&gt;Also, do you know anyone who has used it?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Try Ebay they are many people trying to sell copies for at least half of <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;new price...I just checked   www.ebay.com   I have bought some used books<br/>
&gt;from ebay and got great deals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am Jessica from San Diego who would like to &quot;unschool&quot; (I hate the <br/>
&gt;label).<br/>
&gt;I have been lurking for at least a month. I have not started any sort of<br/>
&gt;school or unschool at home as yet, unless one counts summer and just trying<br/>
&gt;to relax, but I am not sending my 12 year old back to public school this<br/>
&gt;fall.  After years of arguing with his father,  I have finally succeeded in<br/>
&gt;at least having him agree to let me try it at home.  (divorce in progress<br/>
&gt;here)  Their father does not trust that I can handle the situation without <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;&quot;facilitator&quot; so I am probably going to sign up for a Charter School, and <br/>
&gt;go<br/>
&gt;from there, at least it is in a little different direction.  My son has<br/>
&gt;largely lost the joy of learning,  although I see him doing things this<br/>
&gt;summer that seem like learning to me...which I would never mention to him.<br/>
&gt;He has never read for pleasure as a for instance.  Maybe that will come,<br/>
&gt;maybe it won&#39;t.  I really believe he needs a large break.  I am hoping with<br/>
&gt;this charter school that we may be able to choose a &quot;curriculum&quot; and do<br/>
&gt;basically what we want, yet documenting it in a way that appears to follow<br/>
&gt;said curriculum.<br/>
&gt;I have two older sons who went through the PS  system.  My seventeen year <br/>
&gt;old<br/>
&gt;is doing fine by most people standards, my twenty year old really would <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;benefited from a completely different situation.  I am feeling very guilty<br/>
&gt;for being so complacent for so many years.... and hope I can at least turn <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;youngest&#39;s life around.<br/>
&gt;Ideally, I would like to do away with any kind of system at all. I believe<br/>
&gt;systems of all kinds are largely a mistake.<br/>
&gt;  I have enjoyed most of the posts on the list although some threads have<br/>
&gt;gotten a bit tedious for me only because there  are an awful lot of posts <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;read through.  I am currently trying the digest version since I also belong<br/>
&gt;to a number of other groups.  At least that way they are somewhat sorted.   <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;have not been offended by anything.  Keep up the great posts.  I thank you<br/>
&gt;all for the lively discussions.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just thought I would introduce myself, My name is Mary and I am a<br/>
&gt;homeschooling mom of 3 1/2 kids (#4 due in Sept).  I have been lurking the<br/>
&gt;last few days and trying to keep up with the &quot;friendly&quot; banter.lol<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway just thought I would put in my opinion of the hooked on phonics<br/>
&gt;program.  I bought this (at a garage sale) and tried it with my son.  He is<br/>
&gt;very music oriented so I thought he would enjoy it.  He listened to the <br/>
&gt;first<br/>
&gt;tape for about ten minutes and lost interest.  We occasionally look through<br/>
&gt;the books but I don&#39;t think its worth the $300 I would have spent if I<br/>
&gt;purchased it new.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess I should have known when I bought it, it was still in the original<br/>
&gt;box with the receipt inside.  I doubt the original owner used it for any<br/>
&gt;amount of time as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, hope that helps.  Will probably go back to lurking for a while,<br/>
&gt;thanks for listening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey, Suzanna. I didn&#39;t know. I am always interested in different<br/>
&gt;religions. Which church is it that you are talking about? What a good<br/>
&gt;idea! Hell is where you have to spend all the rest of time with other<br/>
&gt;evil people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Debbie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That depends on which Christian church you are talking about. The<br/>
&gt;church I belong to does not have the same concept of Hell as most<br/>
&gt;others. We don&#39;t believe in a literal firey pit. We do believe that<br/>
&gt;all of the evil people will spend eternity with each other though,<br/>
&gt;and never be around good people. I think that would be all the<br/>
&gt;punishment neccessary. And by evil people, we don&#39;t mean people who<br/>
&gt;believe differently than us, we mean really evil people like Hitler,<br/>
&gt;child molestors, murders, etc. You know, people who, by just about<br/>
&gt;any standard, would be considered evil.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I spend a significant amount of time writing to a young man in prison <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;selling drugs.  His behavior led to the death of several people.  He<br/>
&gt;grew up<br/>
&gt;in foster care, was beaten, told he was stupid and would never amount to<br/>
&gt;anything.  Is he evil?  I can&#39;t judge him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I swear Jesus/Goddess/the Great I AM/Zeus must be wondering if we<br/>
&gt;will EVER<br/>
&gt;get it, EVER.  I know I do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Julie&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That is wisdom, Julie. Although I enjoyed Suzanna&#39;s post and wondered<br/>
&gt;which church said the rather different idea of hell she expressed, it<br/>
&gt;also occurred to me that worse than spending eternity in hell with evil<br/>
&gt;ones if you are evil, is spending eternity with evil people   when you<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t.... Earth in other words.<br/>
&gt;Or spending eternity with evil people who are really good inside and<br/>
&gt;could possibly be really themselves, and we all have acted in an<br/>
&gt;aberrated way worse than we wished at times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Note: I say eternity and earth in the same sentence because I happen to<br/>
&gt;have the reality that there is not only one lifetime and we may have all<br/>
&gt;been doing this for a really, really long time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just volunteered to write to inmates in a correspondence course for<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I am Jessica from San Diego who would like to &quot;unschool&quot; (I hate the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;label). I have been lurking for at least a month. I have not started any<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;sort of school or unschool at home as yet, unless one counts summer and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;just trying to relax...&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Welcome Jessica. Label or not, the best part of an unschooling lifestyle is<br/>
&gt;that IT ALL COUNTS! The learning continues. The mind keeps on thinking,<br/>
&gt;summer breaks and all. :o)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I really believe he needs a large break.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Absolutely. In homechooling/unschooling circles this break is called<br/>
&gt;&quot;deschooling&quot; and is always recommended. I&#39;ve heard the guideline of one<br/>
&gt;month for every year of school. Like everything else of course, this is not<br/>
&gt;a rule, but a suggestion or guideline based on experience.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I am feeling very guilty for being so complacent for so many years.... <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;hope I can at least turn my youngest&#39;s life around.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While you all deschool, you can also work on forgiving yourself. Lots of us<br/>
&gt;have felt the way you do. You&#39;ve done the best you could with the<br/>
&gt;information you had. Now you have more information and you&#39;re making<br/>
&gt;different choices for your youngest. Try not to let guilt get in the way of<br/>
&gt;a joyful today.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Life is good.<br/>

&gt;Subject: school financing and economics debates<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;Parents -- not politicians or government employees -- should choose how<br/>
&gt;their own money should be spent for their own children&#39;s education.<br/>
&gt;Nobody has a right to anyone else&#39;s property.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ned --<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You have apparently not read enough economics to have understood the <br/>
&gt;concepts<br/>
&gt;of public goods and positive/negative externalities and some of the causes<br/>
&gt;and solutions to market failure. Neither have most of the other people <br/>
&gt;here,<br/>
&gt;so it is difficult for them to counter even some of the most simplistic<br/>
&gt;arguments, without the ability to draw upon and articulate those somewhat<br/>
&gt;more complex concepts. It doesn&#39;t make you right, it just makes it<br/>
&gt;frustrating and annoying to watch the process.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is not a good place to argue economics -  people  are not here because<br/>
&gt;they are interested in that. If I thought they were, I&#39;d jump in and <br/>
&gt;provide<br/>
&gt;plenty of arguments, based on sound economic reasoning, for why it DOES <br/>
&gt;make<br/>
&gt;sense, in a mixed economy, such as that of the United States, for some of <br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt;tax dollars to be used for educating other people&#39;s children and for a <br/>
&gt;number<br/>
&gt;of other purposes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, like I said, people did not COME to this list to argue economics,<br/>
&gt;not even the economics of public school financing. A really good place for<br/>
&gt;that kind of argument, if you want to do it with other homeschoolers, is <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;NHEN-Legislative yahoogroups list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS NOT INTERESTED --- the way list topics get<br/>
&gt;perpetuated is by people responding to them - you vote with your own posts <br/>
&gt;&lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;. If you want these kinds of threads to die a natural death, stop <br/>
&gt;responding<br/>
&gt;to them, no matter how difficult that may be. Those who ARE interested and<br/>
&gt;want to continue - please make the subject line clear so that the rest of <br/>
&gt;us<br/>
&gt;can delete the messages more easily. Thank you.<br/>

&gt;Bible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One thing all Baptists are taught and repeat ad nauseum is that the Bible <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;perfect and never contradicts itself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The list of contradictions on that site is up to 312 now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The problem with TOTALLY absolute statements is that one exception  makes <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;whole thing false.   They worship the book itself, pretty much.  And <br/>
&gt;they&#39;re<br/>
&gt;always telling people to read it!  Read the whole thing!  Read every night!<br/>
&gt;If I hadn&#39;t read it, I could have maintained the facade with them that it<br/>
&gt;answers any question anyone might have, and it never contradicts itself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s a good religion for people who want life to be simple and who want to<br/>
&gt;hang around with others who say they read the whole Bible, but really <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;Or maybe they just sound out the words without going for comprehension.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;(please copy and distribute -- no attribution needed)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The government is failing to educate our children. In (name your state), <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;failure follows the national pattern. The school system is not doing its<br/>
&gt;job. Taxpayers� money is being wasted while the children are being denied <br/>
&gt;an<br/>
&gt;education. More money will not change it. Sending kids to suburban schools<br/>
&gt;won�t change it because all the public schools in the state are run by the<br/>
&gt;state Department of Education by the same rules, methods and mandates and<br/>
&gt;all offer the same poor quality schooling. It&#39;s bad by design.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    The public schools are failing everywhere because they don�t have<br/>
&gt;effective programs; they have no standards and no goals; they use inferior<br/>
&gt;methods for instruction  (i.e., �Whole Language� a proven failure instead <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;Phonics a proven success); their bad teachers are virtually impossible to<br/>
&gt;fire thanks to the power of the teachers� union; the system has a captive<br/>
&gt;audience of consumers instead of parents with choices. The situation allows<br/>
&gt;the schools to fail without losing any customers or funding. In fact, the<br/>
&gt;worse the schools perform, the higher their funding gets. The Hartford CT<br/>
&gt;schools prove that -- they are among the nation�s worst, and yet their per<br/>
&gt;pupil cost is among the nation�s highest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Government school systems are bureaucratic monopolies with one constant<br/>
&gt;objective: to enlarge their budgets. Their structure and practices <br/>
&gt;guarantee<br/>
&gt;poor performance. There are no incentives to improve the schools; no <br/>
&gt;rewards<br/>
&gt;for good teaching and no penalties for incompetence. The system can blame<br/>
&gt;its customers and �society� for its own failures -- that�s convenient but<br/>
&gt;dishonest -- while its cry remains, �Give us more money.� Taxpayers are its<br/>
&gt;captives; the children are its victims.<br/>

&gt;Yes, with this further thought: It&#39;s OUR money to start with.<br/>
&gt;Ideally, we should (be allowed to) keep the money in the first place. No <br/>

&gt;Joanna writes, concerning vouchers:<br/>
&gt; &gt; I chose to take my children out of the system and i don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything else to do with it.  Asking for our fair share comes with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; whole lot more than we are bargaining for.  there is no getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; around that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Joanna<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ned answers:<br/>
&gt;I totally agree. No one should be required to have anything to do with (or<br/>
&gt;be forced to pay for) anything they do not use or don&#39;t approve of. That<br/>
&gt;would be tyranny.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are only two methods of dealing with people: Voluntarily, or by <br/>
&gt;force.<br/>
&gt;Public schools get their funding by force -- the schools use a third party<br/>
&gt;(government) to collect their money for them by force.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The voucher movement is a partial measure in recovering an element of <br/>
&gt;choice<br/>
&gt;for parents, but the idea still leaves the fund collecting to the state and<br/>
&gt;its force, and that will be the next big issue -- making funding voluntary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Meanwhile, if vouchers give just a few children the means of escaping from<br/>
&gt;horrible schools, then they get my support. Ultimately, the only fair<br/>
&gt;solution is for all school funding to be supported by the parents who <br/>
&gt;choose<br/>
&gt;them, with a variety of private scholarship methods to help needy families.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While the government schools are getting more and more oppressive and<br/>
&gt;despotic, there is a balancing movement, such as homeschooling and a growth<br/>
&gt;of private schooling, and growing awareness of the needs of growing<br/>
&gt;children. We are an integral part of that counter balance.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Christianity comes from Christ, religion is man made.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ned carries on:::<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Who knew that this was a religion group....? Well, so be it. I&#39;ll give it a<br/>
&gt;shot.   (it will tie in, just wait)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Bible tells the story of the evolution of man&#39;s perception of, and<br/>
&gt;relationship to, the supernatural -- god -- the &quot;greater force&quot; behind<br/>
&gt;worldly things, and the spiritual life, so to speak. &quot;It&#39;s all in God&#39;s<br/>
&gt;hands,&quot; as they(we)<br/>
&gt;  say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Early on, man desperately needed explanations for things that were, and<br/>
&gt;still often are, beyond our comprehension.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Faced with often overwhelming natural forces, we imagine an all powerful<br/>
&gt;spirit that controls the world, indeed, the universe, and in the process,<br/>
&gt;controls our puny existence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Early &quot;gods&quot; were the very forces of nature...Zeus, Mars, etc. There were<br/>
&gt;graven images of animals, tree worshippers, sacrifices (murders) to show <br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt;fear of the forces of &quot;heaven.&quot; Kings became gods to their people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Humans have, is seems, always had a need to ascribe anthropomorphic<br/>
&gt;qualities and motives to the forces of nature and to the nether world and <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;the firmament. Thus, some gave their god a male human form and placed &quot;him&quot;<br/>
&gt;in the heavens. &quot;He&quot; was to be the good (god) guy who would protect them, <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;they obeyed certain rules. And to explain all the &quot;bad&quot; stuff that happens,<br/>
&gt;they created another guy (bad guy) and he lived, they were sure, underneath<br/>
&gt;everything.....in Hell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All this imagery has been incredibly useful for financial institutions such<br/>
&gt;as churces. The threat of Hell and damnation, along with the promise of<br/>
&gt;someday sitting on the knee of a benevolent &quot;creator&quot; comprise the twin<br/>
&gt;enticements for supporting a huge corps of therapists called clergy. (Hmm,<br/>
&gt;sounds like what the public schools do to create their brand of conformity,<br/>
&gt;&quot;Sit still and be quiet, and you&#39;ll get As; but if you don&#39;t we&#39;ll drug you<br/>
&gt;into a stupor)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But the Bible goes further, because man is still evolving. Man&#39;s view of<br/>
&gt;&quot;god&quot; changed over the centuries to a more and more enlightened idea. That<br/>
&gt;advanced thinking is described in the New Testament. For my money, Jesus<br/>
&gt;(and a few others, like Buddha) led the way out of the era of nature and<br/>
&gt;animal worship into an era in which god is seen simply as man&#39;s highest <br/>
&gt;view<br/>
&gt;of himself. Jesus called it Love. Christianity changed everything, or, as<br/>
&gt;Ren said,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; turn[ed} the status quo on it&#39;s head.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;Religion has become a personal thing, instead of a group thing, even though<br/>
&gt;many people still enjoy group rituals and celebrations or their &quot;truth.&quot;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s even a joke, &quot;Hey, I saw God, and she&#39;s black !&quot;  -- talk about<br/>
&gt;upsetting the apple cart...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, today, we don&#39;t grovel in front of a carved statue of a beast, we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;pray (beg) to an unknowable &quot;man&quot; in the sky, but we grow (if we can) in an<br/>
&gt;understanding and demonstration of our own highest ethics and best<br/>
&gt;attributes. If we read the Bible (which I used to but don&#39;t these days) we<br/>
&gt;learn that we are created in the image and likeness of God.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What &quot;good news&quot; (the meaning of &quot;gospel&#39;) that is!  If we can believe <br/>
&gt;that,<br/>
&gt;then we know that we are not born as &quot;sinners,&quot; but with all the qualities<br/>
&gt;we need in order to perfect our lives. It means there is no need to beg for<br/>
&gt;favors, no need to pay for forgiveness, no need to believe that anyone or<br/>
&gt;anything has power over us or is god&#39;s go-between. (Martin Luther drew that<br/>
&gt;line in the sand for us, saying, in effect, that we could speak driectly to<br/>
&gt;god, if we wanted to. Wow, what a breakthrough)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have examples of people in several cultures coming to similar<br/>
&gt;conclusions. Man has evolved much since the days of cow worship and man<br/>
&gt;worship. Today, there need be no intermediary (priest) between man and<br/>
&gt;whatever we view as a creative/benevolent spirit, or god.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The same evolution took place in nations...America was founded on the <br/>
&gt;still<br/>
&gt;relatively new (in 1750) idea that the individual is more important than <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;group, and our government was viewed by the framers as the mechanism to<br/>
&gt;protect individual citizens from harm, whether from other individuals or<br/>
&gt;groups.  While government schooling is the last vestige of socialist ideas<br/>
&gt;(top-down control, or subsumption of individuals to the group),<br/>
&gt;homeschooling is helping our country to overcome that oppression and evolve<br/>
&gt;to a higher level of self- and universal awareness.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have it bookmarked, but there is a separation of schools and<br/>

&gt; &gt; advocate eliminating public schooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Betsy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks, Betsy. Let me correct one thing, though.<br/>
&gt;  The Separation of School and State Alliance (www.sepschool.org) does not<br/>
&gt;advocate eliminating public schooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It advocates the elimination of FORCED FUNDING of schools by government. In<br/>
&gt;other words, public schools, like all others, should continue to exist so<br/>
&gt;long as there are people who are willing to pay for them voluntarily. That<br/>
&gt;would mean, of course, that those schools are providing a service that lots<br/>
&gt;of people actually want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Today, there is in the ballpark of $400B annually spent on the public<br/>
&gt;schools. If that amount was not forced to be paid by citizens to the one<br/>
&gt;public school system, it would remain in the hands of those citizens who<br/>
&gt;could spend it for any school they would choose for their kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are dozens of private funding programs today that help families <br/>
&gt;afford<br/>
&gt;alternative schools for their kids. Many more such programs would exist if<br/>
&gt;the tax funding of schools ended. And with that, many new schools would <br/>
&gt;open<br/>
&gt;that would satisfy the varied needs of our diverse population.<br/>

&gt;Ned agrees. They&#39;ve sold millions, so surely there are used ones available.<br/>
&gt;Maybe your support group can buy it together, if you want it new. <br/>
&gt;Otherwise,<br/>
&gt;try advertising your need in classifieds or a radio swap program. Those <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;been helpful to us at times.<br/>
&gt;PLUS, if you get it from a former user, they might give you tips about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are plenty of books available, from libraries too, that show us the<br/>
&gt;basics of phonics. You can create your own games once you know what phonics<br/>
&gt;is about, and how simple it is...up, pup, cup, cut,  etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490478556">Dear Beth, and all,<br/>
 I posted my encouragemnt of talking homeschool politics on this list before<br/>
I read the most recent posts. I do agree that any discussion needs to be<br/>
respectful of differences and without personal attack or defense. I hope we<br/>
can keep things going on this note. One person&#39;s interpretation of facts may<br/>
be different than another&#39;s.  We are all here to support eachother. Go team!<br/>
respectfully and always with humor Josie<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You imply I lie when I send in my ed plan. How do you know? Have you been to<br/>
my home? Have you compared my unschooling and my ed plan? Carol Narigon&#39;s<br/>
letter says exactly what I&#39;m doing. So what would be the purpose of<br/>
representing what *I* and what all MA unschoolers do as a lie? (Have you<br/>
been to their homes too? Have you seen their ed plans?)<br/>
<br/>
How do these broadbrush misrepresentations of MA homeschooers and the<br/>
Bryants help anyone here unschool better? Your rhetoric may make for some<br/>
wonderfully scary, heroic stories around the campfire but in the light of<br/>
day they don&#39;t line up with the real live flesh and blood people I know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The Bryants did<br/>
&gt; not accept forced lying, preferring to be truthful and to expect decent<br/>
&gt; treatment by the state authorities. Instead, the state refused to accept<br/>
&gt; honesty and insisted that they lie in order to be free.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, inflamatory and misrepresentative. Noble homeschoolers against the<br/>
evil state? Not. People taking a stand for something they believed in? I<br/>
hope so. But taking a stand or believing in something doesn&#39;t make someone<br/>
automatically right.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s no where near as noble to gather the state&#39;s homeschoolers together to<br/>
get the regulations changed, is it? It&#39;s the people who get shot who get<br/>
cheered and held up as heroes. *I&#39;m* not cheering. Though I do cheer for the<br/>
quiet ones in the state group who are politcally active for homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The Bryants are taking one small step, at huge personal expense and risk,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; order to help ALL homeschoolers everywhere, and you say they should cave<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to a bad regulation supported by a vindictive and stupid judge?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny, they didn&#39;t ask me if I thought that was a good way to help. And I<br/>
think there was a general feeling they may have harmed more than they<br/>
helped.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re basically saying the homeschoolers of MA are too blind, ignorant and<br/>
like scared sheep to be able to understand the smoke that&#39;s in their own<br/>
state. That you who see so much clearer know that every puff of smoke is<br/>
hiding a ranging inferno about to burst free. That insults every politically<br/>
active homeschooler in MA.<br/>
<br/>
Let us MA people fight our own fights without underinformed inflammatory<br/>
commentary from passers by, okay? Or if you feel your words need to be<br/>
heard, then feel free to post at<br/>

<br/>
(And by now you should have read the &quot;A gentle nudge ...&quot; post. It might<br/>
help to reread it if you still feel continuing this would help my daughter<br/>
explore the world better, or would help someone who wants that Saxon 5/6 to<br/>
spend her money on something that would bring joy to her son.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YIKES! is right. Believe me when I tell you it is NOT worth the money and<br/>
Brittany does NOT need it to learn to read.  Those commercials make their<br/>
program sound so fun and easy, but really it&#39;s just tedium in a box. My<br/>
Casey got sucked in by those commercials once and asked me to get her that<br/>
program. We borrowed it from the library. She was bored in one day. She was<br/>
NOT however bored with learning to read. Just the simplistic phonics only<br/>
approach that this system was using.<br/>
<br/>
We had much more fun and lots of success using a playful, relaxed and varied<br/>
approach. Everything in that expensive phonics program can be found much<br/>
better in real life. There are books from the library, blocks, magnetic<br/>
letters, workbooks from the grocery (for playing, NOT enforcing of course),<br/>
games like Scrabble and Boggle, computer games, magazines, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest your local library as one of the best resources around. If<br/>
you feel a need to brush up on those phonics rules for yourself (so you can<br/>
help Brittany), there are tons of books on the subject. And all for free!<br/>

sold last year for about $15. (And it didn&#39;t work either because my daughter<br/>
had 0 interest.)<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re really buying is:<br/>
<br/>
1) a sense of peace that she&#39;ll learn to read. This is preying on groundless<br/>
fears. As an unschooler in an environment where reading is naturally fun and<br/>
useful she *will* learn to read. It may be tomorrow. It may be 6 years from<br/>
now. (Unless you put her in school where life isn&#39;t natural and there are<br/>
major road blocks to learning to read. (Like expecting her to do something<br/>
she isn&#39;t developmentally ready for yet.) So for parents with kids in school<br/>
the fears aren&#39;t quite so groundless.)<br/>
<br/>
2) *Maybe* early reading. Maybe. Though I&#39;d be more inclined to believe the<br/>
kids who read early with phonics programs are the ones who would have read<br/>
early to begin with. And though being able to read before school starts gets<br/>
cheered, what does it really mean? No one can tell the difference between an<br/>
adult who read at 3 and an adult who read at 7. (I&#39;d extend that to 13 for<br/>
an unschooler but a later reader in school might be demoralized by the<br/>
intervention and end up not liking to read or be convinced he can&#39;t. Sandra<br/>
has been collecting stories of later readers at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a> I think the most important thing to realize in<br/>
terms of calming fears is that a 13 yo new reader is *not* 7 years behind.<br/>
They&#39;ll be indistinguishable from their peers pretty quickly.) Learning<br/>
through reading is *different* not better than learning by doing or learning<br/>
by watching. Unless you&#39;re in school where learning is *only* avialble<br/>
through reading and listening. Then otherwise endowed kids are severly<br/>
handicapped. That doesn&#39;t need to be true at home. We can adapt the<br/>
environment to the kid rather than the kid to the environment.<br/>
<br/>
If you still think you&#39;d like it, first check your library or through<br/>
interlibrary loan. Just ask your librarian to search. That should be free.<br/>
(Or a nominal fee. I think one library in our system charges a quarter for<br/>
each request.) Even if they don&#39;t have a regular system in place, most<br/>
libraries will call around and try to locate what you want.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.half.com">http://www.half.com</a> You&#39;ll need to read and ask questions<br/>
of the sellers and perhaps search the internet to figure out what you&#39;re<br/>
getting since some of the sets are a few years old. (And to make sure the<br/>
seller has listed his item under the correct heading!)<br/>
<br/>
If you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.addall.com">http://www.addall.com</a> it will search 20 or so used book sites<br/>
(including half.com). It will be very helpful if you have the ISBN of the<br/>
one or ones you want since there&#39;s 15 of them and they&#39;re not listed by<br/>
publication date.<br/>
<br/>
The full price one does have a 60 day money back guarantee. Not on the s&h<br/>
though. But *if* you get to keep the National Geographics on CD that comes<br/>
as a free gift, it might be worth it even if you never use it and just send<br/>
it back! ;-) (It&#39;s *way* not worth it if you don&#39;t send it back. You&#39;re much<br/>
better off getting it used and then reselling. You&#39;ll lose less money!)<br/>

stay that way!<br/>
<br/>
My state, FLorida is notorious for its extremely ineffective social<br/>
services agency. THey keep changing the social service agency&#39;s name<br/>
(Dept. of Children and Families is what it is called now) so hopefully<br/>
people will forget the kids who were just murdered, neglected or hurt,<br/>
and keep funding them. On the other hand I have seen testimony by many,<br/>
many families whose lives were ruined by social service agencies who<br/>
tore them apart, ripped kids out of their parents home for no good<br/>
reason by their own opinions and put them into foster homes where they<br/>
were raped or abused and neglected.<br/>
<br/>
BUt they change the name of their agency, rather than their<br/>
fundamentally flawed premise, that the government by intruding and<br/>
degrading the dignity and rights of its people can get them to &quot;act<br/>
better&quot;. Do you advocate spanking and punishing your child and use<br/>
threats of that to increase their judgment? It&#39;s just that the<br/>
government finds it very difficult to control people in a positive way.<br/>
I think that is what you are asking for. Punishment (though it has its<br/>
place) does not control people - it smashes them. A better idea of WHAT<br/>
to do for people and how to define roles, and helping people help<br/>
themselves is what is needed. That is a slow hard way to go for it means<br/>
one-on-one communication and understanding and if you don&#39;t really have<br/>
any idea how to help someone, you don&#39;t conceive it is possible - but it<br/>
is.<br/>

I am Jessica from San Diego who would like to &quot;unschool&quot; (I hate the label).<br/>
I have been lurking for at least a month. I have not started any sort of<br/>
school or unschool at home as yet, unless one counts summer and just trying<br/>
to relax, but I am not sending my 12 year old back to public school this<br/>
fall.  After years of arguing with his father,  I have finally succeeded in<br/>
at least having him agree to let me try it at home.  (divorce in progress<br/>
here)  Their father does not trust that I can handle the situation without a<br/>
&quot;facilitator&quot; so I am probably going to sign up for a Charter School, and go<br/>
from there, at least it is in a little different direction.  My son has<br/>
largely lost the joy of learning,  although I see him doing things this<br/>
summer that seem like learning to me...which I would never mention to him.<br/>
He has never read for pleasure as a for instance.  Maybe that will come,<br/>
maybe it won&#39;t.  I really believe he needs a large break.  I am hoping with<br/>
this charter school that we may be able to choose a &quot;curriculum&quot; and do<br/>
basically what we want, yet documenting it in a way that appears to follow<br/>
said curriculum.<br/>
I have two older sons who went through the PS  system.  My seventeen year<br/>
old<br/>
is doing fine by most people standards, my twenty year old really would have<br/>
benefited from a completely different situation.  I am feeling very guilty<br/>
for being so complacent for so many years.... and hope I can at least turn<br/>
my<br/>
youngest&#39;s life around.<br/>
Ideally, I would like to do away with any kind of system at all. I believe<br/>
systems of all kinds are largely a mistake.<br/>
 I have enjoyed most of the posts on the list although some threads have<br/>
gotten a bit tedious for me only because there  are an awful lot of posts to<br/>

I<br/>
have not been offended by anything.  Keep up the great posts.  I thank you<br/>

<br/>
Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would introduce myself, My name is Mary and I am a<br/>
homeschooling mom of 3 1/2 kids (#4 due in Sept).  I have been lurking the<br/>
last few days and trying to keep up with the &quot;friendly&quot; banter.lol<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just thought I would put in my opinion of the hooked on phonics<br/>
program.  I bought this (at a garage sale) and tried it with my son.  He is<br/>
very music oriented so I thought he would enjoy it.  He listened to the<br/>
first<br/>
tape for about ten minutes and lost interest.  We occasionally look through<br/>
the books but I don&#39;t think its worth the $300 I would have spent if I<br/>
purchased it new.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should have known when I bought it, it was still in the original<br/>
box with the receipt inside.  I doubt the original owner used it for any<br/>
amount of time as well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope that helps.  Will probably go back to lurking for a while,<br/>
thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>

others. We don&#39;t believe in a literal firey pit. We do believe that<br/>
all of the evil people will spend eternity with each other though,<br/>
and never be around good people. I think that would be all the<br/>
punishment neccessary. And by evil people, we don&#39;t mean people who<br/>
believe differently than us, we mean really evil people like Hitler,<br/>
child molestors, murders, etc. You know, people who, by just about<br/>
any standard, would be considered evil.<br/>

also occurred to me that worse than spending eternity in hell with evil<br/>
ones if you are evil, is spending eternity with evil people   when you<br/>
aren&#39;t.... Earth in other words.<br/>
Or spending eternity with evil people who are really good inside and<br/>
could possibly be really themselves, and we all have acted in an<br/>
aberrated way worse than we wished at times.<br/>
<br/>
Note: I say eternity and earth in the same sentence because I happen to<br/>

You have apparently not read enough economics to have understood the<br/>

more complex concepts. It doesn&#39;t make you right, it just makes it<br/>
frustrating and annoying to watch the process.<br/>

This is not a good place to argue economics -  people  are not here because<br/>
they are interested in that. If I thought they were, I&#39;d jump in and provide<br/>
plenty of arguments, based on sound economic reasoning, for why it DOES make<br/>
sense, in a mixed economy, such as that of the United States, for some of<br/>
our<br/>
tax dollars to be used for educating other people&#39;s children and for a<br/>
number<br/>
of other purposes.<br/>
<br/>
However, like I said, people did not COME to this list to argue economics,<br/>
not even the economics of public school financing. A really good place for<br/>
that kind of argument, if you want to do it with other homeschoolers, is the<br/>
NHEN-Legislative yahoogroups list.<br/>
<br/>
Please EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS NOT INTERESTED --- the way list topics get<br/>
perpetuated is by people responding to them - you vote with your own posts<br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
. If you want these kinds of threads to die a natural death, stop responding<br/>
to them, no matter how difficult that may be. Those who ARE interested and<br/>
want to continue - please make the subject line clear so that the rest of us<br/>
can delete the messages more easily. Thank you.<br/>

In my favorite places I have<br/>

the Skeptics Annotated Bible<br/>

Bible.<br/>
<br/>
One thing all Baptists are taught and repeat ad nauseum is that the Bible is<br/>
perfect and never contradicts itself.<br/>
<br/>
The list of contradictions on that site is up to 312 now.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with TOTALLY absolute statements is that one exception  makes<br/>
the<br/>
whole thing false.   They worship the book itself, pretty much.  And they&#39;re<br/>
always telling people to read it!  Read the whole thing!  Read every night!<br/>
If I hadn&#39;t read it, I could have maintained the facade with them that it<br/>
answers any question anyone might have, and it never contradicts itself.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good religion for people who want life to be simple and who want to<br/>
hang around with others who say they read the whole Bible, but really don&#39;t.<br/>
Or maybe they just sound out the words without going for comprehension.<br/>

The government is failing to educate our children. In (name your state), the<br/>
failure follows the national pattern. The school system is not doing its<br/>
job. Taxpayers¹ money is being wasted while the children are being denied an<br/>
education. More money will not change it. Sending kids to suburban schools<br/>
won¹t change it because all the public schools in the state are run by the<br/>
state Department of Education by the same rules, methods and mandates and<br/>
all offer the same poor quality schooling. It&#39;s bad by design.<br/>
<br/>
   The public schools are failing everywhere because they don¹t have<br/>
effective programs; they have no standards and no goals; they use inferior<br/>
methods for instruction  (i.e., ³Whole Language² a proven failure instead of<br/>
Phonics a proven success); their bad teachers are virtually impossible to<br/>
fire thanks to the power of the teachers¹ union; the system has a captive<br/>
audience of consumers instead of parents with choices. The situation allows<br/>
the schools to fail without losing any customers or funding. In fact, the<br/>
worse the schools perform, the higher their funding gets. The Hartford CT<br/>
schools prove that -- they are among the nation¹s worst, and yet their per<br/>
pupil cost is among the nation¹s highest.<br/>
<br/>
   Government school systems are bureaucratic monopolies with one constant<br/>
objective: to enlarge their budgets. Their structure and practices guarantee<br/>
poor performance. There are no incentives to improve the schools; no rewards<br/>
for good teaching and no penalties for incompetence. The system can blame<br/>
its customers and ³society² for its own failures -- that¹s convenient but<br/>
dishonest -- while its cry remains, ³Give us more money.² Taxpayers are its<br/>
captives; the children are its victims.<br/>

Yes, with this further thought: It&#39;s OUR money to start with.<br/>
Ideally, we should (be allowed to) keep the money in the first place. No one<br/>
should be forced to pay for other people&#39;s children. If we help others, it<br/>
should be because we want to, not because our home will be confiscated if we<br/>
don&#39;t. This is America...do you have the right to take your neighbor&#39;s<br/>

I totally agree. No one should be required to have anything to do with (or<br/>
be forced to pay for) anything they do not use or don&#39;t approve of. That<br/>
would be tyranny.<br/>
<br/>
There are only two methods of dealing with people: Voluntarily, or by force.<br/>
Public schools get their funding by force -- the schools use a third party<br/>
(government) to collect their money for them by force.<br/>
<br/>
The voucher movement is a partial measure in recovering an element of choice<br/>
for parents, but the idea still leaves the fund collecting to the state and<br/>
its force, and that will be the next big issue -- making funding voluntary.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, if vouchers give just a few children the means of escaping from<br/>
horrible schools, then they get my support. Ultimately, the only fair<br/>
solution is for all school funding to be supported by the parents who choose<br/>
them, with a variety of private scholarship methods to help needy families.<br/>
<br/>
While the government schools are getting more and more oppressive and<br/>
despotic, there is a balancing movement, such as homeschooling and a growth<br/>
of private schooling, and growing awareness of the needs of growing<br/>
children. We are an integral part of that counter balance.<br/>

&gt; &quot;Christianity comes from Christ, religion is man made.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned carries on:::<br/>
<br/>
Who knew that this was a religion group....? Well, so be it. I&#39;ll give it a<br/>
shot.   (it will tie in, just wait)<br/>
<br/>
The Bible tells the story of the evolution of man&#39;s perception of, and<br/>
relationship to, the supernatural -- god -- the &quot;greater force&quot; behind<br/>
worldly things, and the spiritual life, so to speak. &quot;It&#39;s all in God&#39;s<br/>
hands,&quot; as they(we)<br/>
 say.<br/>
<br/>
Early on, man desperately needed explanations for things that were, and<br/>
still often are, beyond our comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
Faced with often overwhelming natural forces, we imagine an all powerful<br/>
spirit that controls the world, indeed, the universe, and in the process,<br/>
controls our puny existence.<br/>
<br/>
Early &quot;gods&quot; were the very forces of nature...Zeus, Mars, etc. There were<br/>
graven images of animals, tree worshippers, sacrifices (murders) to show our<br/>
fear of the forces of &quot;heaven.&quot; Kings became gods to their people.<br/>
<br/>
Humans have, is seems, always had a need to ascribe anthropomorphic<br/>
qualities and motives to the forces of nature and to the nether world and to<br/>
the firmament. Thus, some gave their god a male human form and placed &quot;him&quot;<br/>
in the heavens. &quot;He&quot; was to be the good (god) guy who would protect them, if<br/>
they obeyed certain rules. And to explain all the &quot;bad&quot; stuff that happens,<br/>
they created another guy (bad guy) and he lived, they were sure, underneath<br/>
everything.....in Hell.<br/>
<br/>
All this imagery has been incredibly useful for financial institutions such<br/>
as churces. The threat of Hell and damnation, along with the promise of<br/>
someday sitting on the knee of a benevolent &quot;creator&quot; comprise the twin<br/>
enticements for supporting a huge corps of therapists called clergy. (Hmm,<br/>
sounds like what the public schools do to create their brand of conformity,<br/>
&quot;Sit still and be quiet, and you&#39;ll get As; but if you don&#39;t we&#39;ll drug you<br/>
into a stupor)<br/>
<br/>
But the Bible goes further, because man is still evolving. Man&#39;s view of<br/>
&quot;god&quot; changed over the centuries to a more and more enlightened idea. That<br/>
advanced thinking is described in the New Testament. For my money, Jesus<br/>
(and a few others, like Buddha) led the way out of the era of nature and<br/>
animal worship into an era in which god is seen simply as man&#39;s highest view<br/>
of himself. Jesus called it Love. Christianity changed everything, or, as<br/>
Ren said,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; turn[ed} the status quo on it&#39;s head.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Religion has become a personal thing, instead of a group thing, even though<br/>
many people still enjoy group rituals and celebrations or their &quot;truth.&quot;<br/>
There&#39;s even a joke, &quot;Hey, I saw God, and she&#39;s black !&quot;  -- talk about<br/>
upsetting the apple cart...<br/>
<br/>
So, today, we don&#39;t grovel in front of a carved statue of a beast, we don&#39;t<br/>
pray (beg) to an unknowable &quot;man&quot; in the sky, but we grow (if we can) in an<br/>
understanding and demonstration of our own highest ethics and best<br/>
attributes. If we read the Bible (which I used to but don&#39;t these days) we<br/>
learn that we are created in the image and likeness of God.<br/>
<br/>
What &quot;good news&quot; (the meaning of &quot;gospel&#39;) that is!  If we can believe that,<br/>
then we know that we are not born as &quot;sinners,&quot; but with all the qualities<br/>
we need in order to perfect our lives. It means there is no need to beg for<br/>
favors, no need to pay for forgiveness, no need to believe that anyone or<br/>
anything has power over us or is god&#39;s go-between. (Martin Luther drew that<br/>
line in the sand for us, saying, in effect, that we could speak driectly to<br/>
god, if we wanted to. Wow, what a breakthrough)<br/>
<br/>
We have examples of people in several cultures coming to similar<br/>
conclusions. Man has evolved much since the days of cow worship and man<br/>
worship. Today, there need be no intermediary (priest) between man and<br/>
whatever we view as a creative/benevolent spirit, or god.<br/>
<br/>
 The same evolution took place in nations...America was founded on the still<br/>
relatively new (in 1750) idea that the individual is more important than the<br/>
group, and our government was viewed by the framers as the mechanism to<br/>
protect individual citizens from harm, whether from other individuals or<br/>
groups.  While government schooling is the last vestige of socialist ideas<br/>
(top-down control, or subsumption of individuals to the group),<br/>
homeschooling is helping our country to overcome that oppression and evolve<br/>
to a higher level of self- and universal awareness.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Betsy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Betsy. Let me correct one thing, though.<br/>
 The Separation of School and State Alliance (www.sepschool.org) does not<br/>
advocate eliminating public schooling.<br/>
<br/>
It advocates the elimination of FORCED FUNDING of schools by government. In<br/>
other words, public schools, like all others, should continue to exist so<br/>
long as there are people who are willing to pay for them voluntarily. That<br/>
would mean, of course, that those schools are providing a service that lots<br/>
of people actually want.<br/>
<br/>
Today, there is in the ballpark of $400B annually spent on the public<br/>
schools. If that amount was not forced to be paid by citizens to the one<br/>
public school system, it would remain in the hands of those citizens who<br/>
could spend it for any school they would choose for their kids.<br/>
<br/>
There are dozens of private funding programs today that help families afford<br/>
alternative schools for their kids. Many more such programs would exist if<br/>
the tax funding of schools ended. And with that, many new schools would open<br/>
that would satisfy the varied needs of our diverse population.<br/>

Maybe your support group can buy it together, if you want it new. Otherwise,<br/>
try advertising your need in classifieds or a radio swap program. Those have<br/>
been helpful to us at times.<br/>
PLUS, if you get it from a former user, they might give you tips about it.<br/>

There are plenty of books available, from libraries too, that show us the<br/>
basics of phonics. You can create your own games once you know what phonics<br/>
is about, and how simple it is...up, pup, cup, cut,  etc.<br/>
