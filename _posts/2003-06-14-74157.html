<div id="ygrps-yiv-227153139">We&#39;re off to Las Vegas.  My husband has been offically transfered to<br/>
NV and we now have to sell our home in CA.  we don&#39;t want to pay the<br/>
5% to 6% real estate agent fee and are thinking of trying to do this<br/>
ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m a little nervous about it.  I don&#39;t want to mess anything<br/>
up legally with the paperwork.  My friend told me about Help U Sell<br/>
real estate and I have someone coming over today to tell us about how<br/>
it works.  Basicly they charge a set fee (about $3000) to market our<br/>
home and do all of the paperwork with us but we show the home.  After<br/>
being quoted up to $11,000 (depending on what we sell the house for)<br/>
$3000 sounded really good.  I then got an email from a local real<br/>
estate office who does something similar and I&#39;m going to call them to<br/>
find out what their fee is. <br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if any of you had either sold their home<br/>
themselves (and what was involved) or is you had used Help U Sell or<br/>
something similar and where you happy with the results?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Melissa</div>

&quot;How to Sell your House in Five Days&quot;. My friend is going to do this very soon. <br/>
Sounds interesting.<br/>
