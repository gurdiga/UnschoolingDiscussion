<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465003446">We are going into our third year of &quot;homeschooling.&quot;  Our first <br/>
year consisted of complete deschooling.  The next year I fell victim <br/>
to mother panic mode and went towards some curriculum type learning <br/>
for both my 8yr.old and 11yr. old sons.  I pretty much continued to <br/>
not do any formal lessons with my 6 year old daughter.  Well, at the <br/>
end of last school year I was burned out and and miserable and so <br/>
were my children.  My 8yr. old was still not reading, and my 11yr. <br/>
old was going through the motions of his schoolwork and not enjoying <br/>
any of it!  After spending the summer reading every book I could get <br/>
my hands on in regards to learning, from unschooling books to books <br/>
geared toward better late then early themes, I am now ready to <br/>
unschool.  As usual, I can never stop with the questions...which is <br/>
why I writing to you all now!  <br/>
<br/>
  Example, today we stopped at a gas station to buy a bottle of water <br/>
and driving away I asked the kids since the bottle was $1.39 how much <br/>
change did I get back. I had paid with two dollar bills. Well, I got <br/>
my answer and I had my 8 yr. old count out the change to see if he <br/>
and his brother were right.  Nagging me though was the feeling that <br/>
this was not unschooling but a &quot;teacher-like&quot; conceived coersion <br/>
tactic to get them to LEARN.   Maybe it would be better in the future <br/>
to let them handle the money and pay for things themselves or not do <br/>
anything with the whole money thing at all?  <br/>
 I know this may seem like a very trivial situation,and by all rights <br/>
it is,but I am still in many daily situations trying to come to terms <br/>
with the concept of &quot;unschooling.&quot;   Is stopping to &quot;teach&quot; in daily <br/>
life against the grain of unschooling??  Or instead is that our duty <br/>
as unschooling parents??  I think that perhaps as an parent of a <br/>
unschooled child your role may be more of a facilitator of learning <br/>
as opposed to a teacher.  As a facilitator you would be there to help <br/>
the child locate resources or information as they come to you with <br/>
their interests....such as leading them to music classes should they <br/>
desire to learn music or helping them to navigate the internet to <br/>
locate information,etc..  <br/>
<br/>
  I would appreciate any thoughts you can offer in regards to these <br/>
issues.   Thanks!<br/>

**I would not have asked them that question.  There are times when Dagny and<br/>
Rowan pay themselves, times when I pay and they notice how much the total<br/>
is/what I get back, and times when I pay and they don&#39;t pay any attention.<br/>
It isn&#39;t necessary to create situations (or ask questions you don&#39;t need the<br/>

<br/>
When I decided to unschool (we had been homeschooling for 3 years), I spent<br/>
a couple of months deschooling. I really stepped back and just answered<br/>
questions and let them be.<br/>
<br/>
 Eight months on, if I manage to answer all their questions in a day, I&#39;m<br/>
lucky. My middle son in particular asks me&#39; how much is...?&#39; countless times<br/>
a day. Learning to answer their questions the way I would answer an adult,<br/>
with respect and without turning it into a lecture, has been one of my best<br/>
lessons. It really does build trust.<br/>
<br/>
 My kids know they can ask me stuff now and I am not going to turn it into a<br/>
lesson which has really put them off asking in the past.<br/>

<br/>
Try this: Just do what you would normally do, whether or not the kids were with you, but do it a bit more slowly and out loud. In other words, give them a fighting chance of being able to follow your modeling. THEN - let them take over what they want to take over. Support that urge when they say, &quot;I can do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to teach - but you can behave in ways that are helpful to kids who WANT to learn to do what adults do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pam Sorooshian mentioned (in her conference talk I think) that her daughter<br/>
wanted to buy a slushie and Pam handed her daughter a $20 bill and suggested<br/>
that she estimate how much change she&#39;d get. Her daughter did that on the<br/>
way over and the woman in fact did give her incorrect change. Her daughter<br/>
was able to recognize that and speak up about it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a real situation.<br/>
<br/>
It depends on your kids. On the surface what you did does sound teacherly.<br/>
You already knew the answer and you were testing to see if they could figure<br/>
it out.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are puzzle/quiz oriented, though, they might view the situation<br/>
like a trivia game and enjoy it. &quot;Hey, let&#39;s see if you guys can figure out<br/>
how much change I got,&quot; might sound like a fun game. Or it may sound great<br/>
to one and paralyze the other with fear. Encouraging a joint answer is *way*<br/>
better than each answering indvidually. A joint answer would involve<br/>
discussion and verbalizing number manipulation.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It *is* a tricky area to try to explain since everyone&#39;s concept of<br/>
&quot;helping&quot; is different. Some people may feel it&#39;s helping to stop and have<br/>
mini lectures on something that pops up and some people may feel it&#39;s<br/>
helping to let kids figure things out without interference no matter how<br/>
badly they&#39;re floundering. It&#39;s a balance. What you actually end up doing<br/>
will depend on your children&#39;s needs and their personalities.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra often expresses it as sharing something cool with the kids the same<br/>
way you&#39;d do with a friend. You probably wouldn&#39;t quiz a friend to see if<br/>
she could guess how much change you got? ;-) (But, as I said above, it<br/>
depends on your kids.) If you can get into a mode of sharing what you find<br/>
enjoyable rather than feeling it&#39;s important for them to possess whatever<br/>
knowledge you&#39;re seeing, then unschooling will flow more smoothly for you.<br/>

just some prompting.   Like with the &quot;change left over&quot; thing.  A very natural <br/>
situation would be that JP ( 8)  may want to go in the store to pick up some <br/>
items for me.   (this makes my kids feel very grown up and responsible, to go <br/>
in a get a loaf of bread, a drink.. something like that).  So, I will count <br/>
up, out loud, about how much it is going to cost.. &quot;OK.. we need bread, that&#39;s <br/>
about $2, milk. thats @ $3, and some chips, they are @ $2... so, it should be <br/>
@$7 plus tax.. here is a 10&quot;   Then I would ask, &quot;about how much change will <br/>
you be getting back?&quot;  And he would figure it up and give me an answer..  &quot;  hmm <br/>
$3... can I get a candy bar?&quot;  &quot;Will you have enough left for one?&quot;  &quot;Yeah, <br/>
they are .50..&quot;   Ok, well get me and Anna one too, will you have enough for <br/>
that?&quot;    At any point he might not know the answer.   He would in this <br/>
situation., cause he is very familar with quarters and .50.. If the conversation was <br/>
not easy and natural, if he balked at figuring it up, I would just continue to <br/>
do the math out loud.   But the point is, this is all just every day stuff, <br/>
it&#39;s not contrived. <br/>

&lt;&lt;  We are going into our third year of &quot;homeschooling.&quot;  Our first <br/>
<br/>
year consisted of complete deschooling.  The next year I fell victim <br/>
<br/>
to mother panic mode &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I said &quot;I went through a year of demagnetization, and the next year all <br/>
kinds of metal stuck to me,&quot; you might think I hadn&#39;t really demagnetized!<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling only works when it works.   Doing nothing schoolish isn&#39;t the <br/>
same as actively recovering from school.   Kids will get over school gradually, <br/>
but there needs to be an active unschooling life taking its place as they <br/>
recover.  Parents get over schooling MUCH more gradually, as they were in school <br/>
more and they have parental fears and responsibilities and pressures from <br/>
others.   So it takes more work and more time for parents to see the value of and to <br/>
recognize the form and substance of natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a little article with good links to others similar and better:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I pretty much continued to <br/>
<br/>
not do any formal lessons with my 6 year old daughter. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Any formal lessons at all can keep unschooling from growing and blossoming.<br/>
<br/>
That might sound lame to people new to unschooling, but if the parent <br/>
reserves something (math, usually) as the thing they won&#39;t risk, the child learns <br/>
that math is hard and important, but the other stuff isn&#39;t as important.  That&#39;s <br/>
not a useful lesson.  History is WAY more important than math in almost every <br/>
practical way, and math IS a part of history, bigtime, but by separating them <br/>
and treating history the way Lego is treated (as not-math), there is an object <br/>
and field problem, and there is a valuation problem, and it becomes a <br/>
stoppage.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  Example, today we stopped at a gas station to buy a bottle of water <br/>
<br/>
and driving away I asked the kids since the bottle was $1.39 how much <br/>
<br/>
change did I get back. I had paid with two dollar bills. Well, I got <br/>
<br/>
my answer and I had my 8 yr. old count out the change to see if he <br/>
<br/>
and his brother were right. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the best tool for getting over that is to ask yourself honestly <br/>
whether you would have asked the same question of your husband, or of an adult <br/>
friend who happened to go to the store with you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Maybe it would be better in the future <br/>
<br/>
to let them handle the money and pay for things themselves or not do <br/>
<br/>
anything with the whole money thing at all?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Artificial dichotomy!!!<br/>
Why all of one or all of the other?  <br/>
<br/>
There will be money opportunities LOTS of times.  <br/>
<br/>
What has worked pretty well here is me giving them a larger bill instead of <br/>
trying to estimate exactly how much something would cost, and letting them <br/>
bring the receipt and change back.  They get a printout, they have the money, <br/>
sometimes they look and care and sometimes they don&#39;t.   Instead of sending one to <br/>
the store for bread and saying &quot;It will be about $150, here&#39;s $1.65 which <br/>
should cover the tax too and I should get a few pennies back,&quot; I often just give <br/>
them $5 and say &quot;You can get something for you, too, if you want, for doing th<br/>
e errand.&quot;   Usually they haven&#39;t gotten anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, now that they&#39;re older, there are often short-notice opportunities.  <br/>
&quot;Can we go to the dollar movies with Crystal?  Holly can go.  And they&#39;re <br/>
going to Denny&#39;s.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you have any money?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;$10.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well take this in case you need more, and bring it back if you don&#39;t,&quot; and <br/>
I&#39;ll give Marty  $10 or $20 to make sure Holly gets to eat, and that Marty gets <br/>
to eat, and remind him to tip, and he brings back change.<br/>
<br/>
I think the same way it has worked with my kids not to limit TV or food, <br/>
which made them not needy, trusting them with money and being open to financing <br/>
things like others taking them to movies and such has kept them from a desperate <br/>
need to get out and spend money.   Maybe I&#39;m just lucky, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
so.  I think because we haven&#39;t made money scary or nearly impossible to come <br/>
by, they&#39;re not grasping.  Because we&#39;re open to saying &quot;This month is really <br/>
tight, so we can&#39;t get hamburgers, we have to eat at home,&quot; and we don&#39;t say it <br/>
ALL the time, the flow of information and energy regarding money hasn&#39;t been <br/>
weird here, as it so often was when I was little.<br/>
<br/>
My mom smoked cigarettes and drank a lot of beer.  I knew what that cost.   I <br/>
never got a stereo.  We had some old ratty portable record player found at a <br/>
dump or given to my dad.  When I wanted a book there was no money but when my <br/>
mom wanted beer there was.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a better math lesson (and other lessons thrown in too!) than counting <br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of the chitchat above seems to miss the point, if a person is JUST <br/>
looking for a subtraction problem.  Subtraction problems are too schoolish, <br/>
though, for the purposes of unschooling.  That WILL come in the course of real <br/>
life.   Real life has a hard time unfolding when we stop for subtractions <br/>
lessons.<br/>

I do talk things through out loud sometimes, like if I&#39;m trying to figure<br/>
out how much money she&#39;ll need for a Waterworld and then dinner, or<br/>
something. Then I just give her some bill that seems like enough, and I<br/>
usually tell her about how much change I expect to get back, if it&#39;s a $5<br/>

<br/>
I know that Rain would be upset by my saying things like that to her, no<br/>
matter how easygoing my tone.  I hear you saying that your kid and Pam&#39;s<br/>
kid weren&#39;t, that they enjoy it, but my point is that not all kids will<br/>
respond that way. Rain doesn&#39;t generally like being quizzed, or<br/>
challenged to figure things out. It has worked better for me to just<br/>
verbalize my thought processes occasionally, and eventually she&#39;ll stop<br/>
me and finish figuring it out herself.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes she&#39;ll specifically ask about something, like our half hour<br/>
long exploration of different number bases at a fast food restaurant last<br/>
week, and then I might ask questions I already know, to walk her through<br/>
it... but those are pretty unique situations.<br/>

Kind of like what I was talking about. But - maybe this will help <br/>
explain the difference between &quot;quizzing&quot; for teaching purposes and <br/>
what I was trying to convey about how unschooling parents facilitate <br/>
learning as they&#39;re going through real life with their kids:<br/>

I handed a $20 bill to my young child - she was 9 years old. She went <br/>
across the mall (where I could still see her but not hear or <br/>
participate in the transaction) to buy a cookie. As I handed her the <br/>
money I said something like: &quot;It is good to think in advance about <br/>
approximately how much change you expect to get, to make sure you get <br/>
the right amount.&quot; She sort of quickly figured it out, assumed a <br/>
cookie would be a few dollars and said how much it was, but I wasn&#39;t <br/>
actually asking her to TELL me. It was definitely not a quiz. I was <br/>
offering useful information with a practical purpose - practical and <br/>
useful TO the child, not useful because it is something I thought she <br/>
might need to know someday and not practical because I thought she <br/>
needed to know arithmetic now in order to do algebra later to get <br/>
into college and get a good job, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As it turned out, I couldn&#39;t have chosen a better time to just happen <br/>
to mention predicting your change -- the girl behind the cookie <br/>
counter returned change for a $10 bill, not a $20. My daughter <br/>
pointed it out and got the right change. So - the most important <br/>
thing about this whole incident that was the most cool aspect - my <br/>
daughter got a dose of instant reinforcement that my suggestions are <br/>
worth listening to. She thought I was psychic or something, of <br/>
course! &lt;G&gt; Very impressed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You have to read and believe that the tone in these conversations <br/>
is natural and easy going. &gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
And that they are conversations, not teacher moments. Not necessary <br/>
the same conversation I&#39;d have with another adult, though. I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
suggest to my friend Jocelyn that its a good idea to know how much <br/>
change to expect before you hand over a big bill like that. So it <br/>
isn&#39;t a conversation I&#39;d really ever have with an adult. STILL, the <br/>
principle is the same - would I offer useful information to an adult <br/>
friend? Sure - do it all the time. My friends offer useful <br/>
interesting information tome all the time too. Those are the friends <br/>
I most appreciate and enjoy!! Is this useful information for my child <br/>
and am I offering it in that same spirit that I&#39;d offer it to an <br/>
adult? If yes - that&#39;s an unschooling kind of thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Is it information that I just want to somehow drop into her brain <br/>
because I think it is good for her? Is it for some future need that <br/>
she has no way of understanding? Is it me thinking &quot;you need to know <br/>
this&quot; just because I think she should? Is it something the child <br/>
isn&#39;t going to see any practical use for right now? If the answer to <br/>
these questions is &quot;yes&quot; then I&#39;m not unschooling, I&#39;m schooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And, although I may ask him questions that I know the answers, I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>never ask him questions that he obviously knows ( or has thought out) <br/>
the answers to. Maybe you just have to hear it in person to <br/>
understand it&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Or keep reading with an open mind - it was the accumulation of lots <br/>
and lots of stories like this that helped me grasp the basic <br/>
principles of unschooling. That, and just trying them out in our <br/>
lives and observing the real-life results.<br/>

was not meant as an endorsement that that kind of exchange will be the best <br/>
for everyone.   <br/>
<br/>
 Ethan hates being quizzed.. even in game/fun situations.  Landon and JP love <br/>
to be quizzed ( although, as I said before, the conversation I referred to <br/>
was NOT quizzing, it was talking)  They enjoy answering trivial pursuit <br/>
questions,  Brainquest, watching Jeopardy, &quot;Millionaire&quot;  etc.  I am talking about FOR <br/>
FUN, on thier own accord, requesting these activities, seeking them out.  <br/>
Yeah, I will be the first to agree, some kids may be resistant to a conversation <br/>
that includes questions...  So, of course, you wouldnt engage in that type of <br/>
conversation with that child.<br/>

I kind of responded to this - but I need to be more clear that my kids don&#39;t take well to people quizzing them either. It doesn&#39;t happen to them very often- but once in a while they feel &quot;quizzed&quot; by someone and they&#39;re kind of bewildered by it, to be honest. They&#39;ve asked me, later, &quot;Why was so-and-so asking me those questions&quot; and they&#39;ve even said things directly to the person, like,&quot;I&#39;m sorry, don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re asking me questions like this that you know the answers to.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t my nature to quiz them like that - so it hasn&#39;t come up between us - but I do remember my youngest being suspicious once, of a question I was asking. She responded, &quot;Mom, are you really asking or just trying to find out if I know?&quot; I was really asking - this was before she&#39;d realized how much she knows that I don&#39;t know, I guess. She&#39;s still startled by that realization sometimes &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67254181">**That might sound lame to people new to unschooling, but if the parent<br/>
reserves something (math, usually) as the thing they won&#39;t risk, the child <br/>

Or they learn that mom thinks they aren&#39;t smart enough to learn math without <br/>
special help.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I found that to be very much the case in our household. For a few <br/>
years my husband insisted on math lessons for our son, though dh had <br/>
read some John Holt and liked what he read, though he agreed with <br/>
unschooling for the most part. He still thought math had to be taught <br/>
sequentially, with a lot of practice, on paper. I wasn&#39;t so sure <br/>
about it myself to completely disagree with him (at first) so I <br/>
worked with my son on math for a long time. The result became that <br/>
Glenn hated math and felt he was an idiot where math was concerned. <br/>
It didn&#39;t affect only math. He got to where he distrusted me if it <br/>
seemed I wanted to talk about anything that he thought <br/>
was &quot;educational.&quot; It even seemed to affect reading though I can&#39;t be <br/>
sure the connection is there. He enjoyed reading when he was younger <br/>
but got to the point where he didn&#39;t even want to read. He would tell <br/>
me he &quot;hated reading&quot; like he &quot;hated math.&quot; Since I&#39;d never forced <br/>
reading on him even in our early more structured homeschool days, I <br/>
think he was just closing off reading as a possibility of something <br/>
fun because his dad and I seemed to think books were valuable and <br/>
since we also seemed to think math was valuable he just couldn&#39;t <br/>
trust us. That&#39;s my theory. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true, but it seems <br/>
likely to me.<br/>
<br/>
After the conference last year I had a showdown with my husband and <br/>
told him the math thing wasn&#39;t working, that it was <br/>
counterproductive, and he agreed very reluctantly to have us unschool <br/>
Glenn for real. He&#39;s still not a real supporter and still asks from <br/>
time to time if we &quot;did math&quot; or he&#39;ll say &quot;If I gave Glenn a test <br/>
right now could he pass?&quot; Yesterday he did that. Wanted to know if <br/>
Glenn could still do long division problems, something he could do <br/>
pretty easily a couple of years ago. I told my husband I didn&#39;t know, <br/>
but that if Glenn couldn&#39;t still do the problems it seemed to me it <br/>
would uphold the unschooling point of view that drill and successful <br/>
test taking are not the same as learning. He seemed to listen and <br/>
didn&#39;t continue the badgering so maybe that helped.<br/>
<br/>
Glenn&#39;s had almost a year of unschooling without that holdout of math <br/>
and I think he&#39;s healing some. He&#39;ll notice and mention how <br/>
something has math in it without running scared the other direction. <br/>
He&#39;s more open to talking with me about a lot of different things and <br/>
isn&#39;t worrying that I&#39;m trying to &quot;teach&quot; him. He read a book last <br/>
night and has started another one this morning. Anyway, I sure <br/>
agree that unschooling everything except math is wayyyyy <br/>
counterproductive. It affects the whole unschooling experience in a <br/>
bad way. <br/>

Priss, you can tell your husband that my son was public schooled through 6th<br/>
grade.  He learned long division in 4th grade which meant he had 2 full<br/>
years of practicing long division problems on papers.  Today he says he<br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to do long division.  If you gave him a test today on long<br/>
division he would fail.  You are absolutely right that drill and then tests<br/>
are not the same as learning.<br/>
