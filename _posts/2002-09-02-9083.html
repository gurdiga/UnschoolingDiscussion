Now my experience has been just the opposite.  I was born and raised in<br/>
Texas and have a racially mixed family, so we notice racial undercurrents<br/>
pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
The two most racially intolerant places I have ever been, at least in my<br/>
experience, are Michigan and Pennsylvania.  Yuck.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The duration of captivity seems to continue into adulthood for some people.<br/>
 I wonder what makes the difference in those of us who reject school? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We never got the &quot;stockholm syndrome&quot;?  Nah, I did think school was a <br/>
necessary, wonderful thing when my first child was born. I think some of us <br/>
in this world are able to be very uncomfortable with an idea, but not let it <br/>
go until it&#39;s thought through, evaluated and held up to the light of our <br/>
beliefs. <br/>
When something seems to speak to my heart, or make me uncomfortable, I have <br/>
to know why, I have to read about and seek information on it from all angles.<br/>
Some people don&#39;t have a need to know. They&#39;d rather NOT know.  It is this <br/>
willingness to examine things from other perspectives that makes it possible <br/>
to overcome programming in my opinion.<br/>
I like to think of it as a strong constitution. But maybe I&#39;m giving myself <br/>
too much credit...lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709611130">Greetings everyone,<br/>
I thought I&#39;d introduce myself. My name is Robin, my dh is Mark and <br/>
we have an 18 yr old daughter (in college), a 5 yr old son and a 3 yr <br/>
old daughter. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter went to Montessori school in Michigan until we moved to <br/>
California, there she went to public school for 2 years. After the <br/>
9th grade finished, she stayed home on a mutual decision. She was <br/>
always labeled &quot;gifted&quot; for what it&#39;s worth, and was an excellent <br/>
student, but the social aspects of the public school were horrible. <br/>
We homeschooled for a year, but she was doing 12th grade work so she <br/>
took the CHSPE and started community college. She is now in Santa <br/>
Monica and is working toward Otis a wonderful art college). <br/>
<br/>
I have attachment parented, breastfed, and homeschooled my two <br/>
youngest, they know nothing different and have never stepped foot in <br/>
an institutionalized school setting. <br/>
<br/>
Currently, we live in Las Vegas, but have bought a 3 acre home in a <br/>
small, rural community one hour away. We are looking forward to our <br/>
move and want to raise chickens, own horses again and whatever <br/>
animals suit our fancy! <br/>
<br/>
I have read all of John Holt&#39;s books and just recently decided that <br/>
our style of homeschooling is definitely unschooling. Unfortunately, <br/>
I had a panic attack around the time Kindergarten would have started <br/>
for my son, and purchased a very expensive curriculum. Now it sits <br/>
gathering dust while we do what we&#39;ve been enjoying all along: <br/>
reading, reading, reading, playing with many, many games, play-dough <br/>
(we make our own), blocks, library, ice skating, parks, and learning <br/>
as nature provides. I&#39;ve tried using the pre-packaged curriculum, but <br/>
it&#39;s so boring and and turns my son (and I) off to learning! I&#39;ve <br/>
learned a valuable lesson and perhaps, I needed to buy this <br/>
curriculum so I could be absolutely positive about who we are and <br/>
what works for us. I have much more confidence now! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to the words of wisdom from those of you who are <br/>
on this loop, and am looking forward to reading the archives!<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin</div>

 </span></blockquote>Your story sounds familiar, but it was second grade for us; we skipped<br/>
kindergarten, and did all of first grade.  I let the kids play with the<br/>
second grade stuff, even retrieving the Test Booklet from the locked filing<br/>
cabinet!  They played &quot;baby school&quot; with the Cabbage Patch dolls &lt;g&gt;<br/>

There are quite a few places online to sell used curriculum.  (You<br/>
aren&#39;t the first or last person to want the comfort of a curriculum<br/>
without finding it to be much good. ;-)  )<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine uses Vegsource and TheSwap, I think. I&#39;ve also heard of<br/>
people selling used homeschooling materials on Ebay and on Half.com.<br/>

expensive and non-sellable K12.  :-(  <br/>

<br/>
I was going to ask &quot;what makes it non-sellable?  But I realized it&#39;s a<br/>
computer-based instruction service.  (Right?)<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to write an article, or at least a more detailed post, about<br/>
what&#39;s good and bad about K12?  It might be a valuable service for others.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll bet most of the online instruction people (below college level)<br/>
have a darned high drop out rate.  <br/>

There&#39;s some John Holt online.  But if you know nothing at all about <br/>
unschooling and would like to, go here and click &quot;library&quot;<br/>
www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
or here if that&#39;s not enough<br/>
sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>
<br/>
This is probably not a good beginning list for you, but if you go to the <br/>
first site above and click &quot;message boards&quot; you can read quite a bit about <br/>
people who have taken kids out and you can probably find some information <br/>
local to your state/province/city.<br/>

Parenting section at yahoo groups.  :)  I looked at hundreds of lists trying <br/>
to find the other one.  There are some real freaks out there...but anyway it <br/>
was nice to see a familiar face pop up.<br/>
