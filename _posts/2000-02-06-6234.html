<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923073832">OK..so now I have the idea of attachment parenting down..and am<br/>
happy to know that this is somewhat of a natural occurance for me..<br/>
So now I have another question for you all..Recently coercion parenting<br/>
was brought up..now..as you know I have an almost 3 yo son..Benjamin<br/>
Still very much a toddler..ofcourse..what else would he be...<br/>
My way of dealing with situations which need guidance is to give him <br/>
choices...(they are not exactly choices) ie. Either you stop lying on the<br/>
rabbit or I&#39;ll have to put him away..or ..If you don&#39;t cooperate while I<br/>
change your diaper, you&#39;ll go to bed naked...Stuff like that...Now is that<br/>
considered coersion??  I would hate to be labled in such a manner...and if<br/>
that be the case, does anyone know of other ways to guide our youngsters<br/>
thru the general rights and wrongs???..???  <br/>
Eileen<br/>
ps..not that I should be worrying about being labeled...but I would like<br/>
raise my son as naturally and kindly as possible, whithout ofcourse hurting<br/>
the rabbit, dog, cats, ducks or himself in the process..</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132911792">Giving choices is good but sometimes they are hard to come up with.  Just <br/>
remember a rule is they need to have LOGICAL or NATURAL consequences.  Never <br/>
give a child a choice you yourself cannot follow through with.  I am not <br/>
picking but the one mentioned was he would go to bed without a diaper.  The <br/>
answer you might get is OK mom no diaper for me.  Can you live with that.  We <br/>
always have the problem with being consistent and following through.  If you <br/>
say it, you need to mean it, and complete it, whatever it is.  <br/>
I usually saw something that our son Sam (5) was doing to the dog and I would <br/>
find my first reaction to scream across the room.  But I need to stop and <br/>
look and see where I can get his attention and not his anger.  If you can <br/>
calmly come to his level and touch him gently and find out what you can do to <br/>
help him play better with the animals.  Let them give you ideas.  If they are <br/>
too young to verbalize then you give him suggestions.  Try not to over <br/>
verbalize a situation because they can only handle so much info before they <br/>
turn off.  Try other questions then WHY?  Even an adult usually cannot come <br/>
up with a reason of why they did something.  The reason is usually too <br/>
complex.  <br/>
Remember if your cup is empty you cannot fill your children&#39;s cups.  Give <br/>
yourself what you need so when you come to your children&#39;s needs you are not <br/>
at the end of your rope.  When you are calm and happy you can give more to <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for such a long post but you spoke of a point I feel very strong about. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413048076">hi,<br/>
<br/>
have you tried asking him why he&#39;s &#39;lying on the rabbit&#39;  or telling him he<br/>
can lay on a stuffed animal and give him one but he cannot lay on a real one<br/>
because it will hurt him and even tell him why - turn it in to a teaching<br/>
moment he can learn about the skeleton etc. you can also show him what it<br/>
feels like to have something really big lay on him,  maybe he just needs more<br/>
physical - rough housing- stuff in his life.   also with situations like a<br/>
diapering ask him what he would rather be doing than having is diaper put<br/>
on.   it sounds like he just wants to play and wrestle.<br/>
<br/>
we run into all these kinds of situations with our son (4) and he seems to<br/>
really enjoy all the different approaches often a good 5 or10 minute wrestle<br/>
will get him calm enough to cooperate or a logical reason why there is a<br/>
limitation (sometime the reason needs to be acted out:)   i really think<br/>
if we<br/>
cooperate with our kids they cooperate with us but we have to go first :)<br/>
perhaps if you shifted your focus from &#39;giving choices&#39; (which will naturally<br/>
show themselves) to mutual cooperation the element of coercion may be<br/>
removed.   but the best thing i&#39;ve found is out and out silliness it works<br/>
nearly (nothing&#39;s a sure thing:) every time and it makes life fun.<br/>
