&gt; Dear Vote.com voter,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This Sunday marks President Bush&#39;s 100th day in office.  Now you can log<br/>
on to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vote.com">http://www.vote.com</a> to tell the president how you&#39;d rate his<br/>
performance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has Bush provided strong leadership or are people like Dick Cheney and<br/>
Colin Powell doing his job for him?  Is he looking out for the people&#39;s<br/>
interests or for special interests?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tell the president if he&#39;s on the right track... or if he needs to change<br/>
course.  Make your vote count, and ask your friends and family to vote too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your friends at Vote.com<br/>
