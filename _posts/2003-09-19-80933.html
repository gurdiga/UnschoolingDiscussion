<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most of the things in my lifestyle are things that DO make people <br/>
uncomfortable.  Unassisted childbirth, no immunizations, don&#39;t <br/>
believe in medical care of any kind except if I&#39;m on the brink of <br/>
death, Unschooling, unhindered adolescence, childhood autonomy, <br/>
extended breastfeeding, family bed, psychic experiences, belief in <br/>
time travel and alternate realities, use of the zero-point field and <br/>
directed intention to &quot;create your own reality&quot;.....this all goes <br/>
together, as a lifestyle, for me.  It is all about unlimited personal <br/>
freedom and using the power God/nature gave us to change our lives <br/>
and the world.   We live by two principles:  don&#39;t cause harm, and <br/>
don&#39;t take the un-given.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone is uncomforable with some aspect of my lifestyle, that is <br/>
not bad.  It isn&#39;t causing them harm to be uncomfortable.   It&#39;s <br/>
causing them to look at something maybe they haven&#39;t looked at <br/>
before.  It&#39;s causing them to consider things that are new to them.<br/>
<br/>
Since I believe that before we come here, we make an agreement with <br/>
people to participate in certain events together, I believe that the <br/>
person who might see me naked agreed with me before we came here that <br/>
we should both participate in this event.   Therefore, whatever <br/>
reaction they have, they chose to have that reaction long before we <br/>
actually had that experience together.  Whatever lesson they had to <br/>
learn from it, they chose it.  I don&#39;t have to feel bad about what <br/>
they are experiencing.  It&#39;s part of what has to happen to them for <br/>
them to choose to make their part of the world better by changing <br/>
their attitudes.  If they don&#39;t, well, there&#39;s a lesson there too, <br/>
perhaps to be worked out in another lifetime.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The following  happened at a German-American women&#39;s group get-<br/>
together when we lived in Germany in the late 80&#39;s:<br/>
<br/>
American woman(disbelievingly):  My family was at a local park last <br/>
weekend. A man canoed up to the river&#39;s edge, got out of his canoe, <br/>
walked to his car, took off his clothes, toweled off, got dressed and <br/>
drove away!  Right in the PARKING LOT!!!<br/>
<br/>
German woman(very matter-of-fact): What was he supposed to do? Drive <br/>
home wet?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah yeah. I know. Been there, done that &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But - i think my point is being avoided.<br/>
<br/>
The question is whether there isn&#39;t ANY time or place that she would <br/>
forego insisting on her own &quot;rights&quot; in order to simply make someone <br/>
else more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
If the situation is one, as in northern Europe or the beaches of Spain <br/>
or a nude beach in California, where nudity is already acceptable, then <br/>
that is not an example I&#39;m inquiring about.<br/>
<br/>
My mom took pictures of some people climbing cliffs in Norway. Pictures <br/>
are shot from a bit of a distance - she claims she didn&#39;t notice until <br/>
she got much closer that the people were nude. Cool pictures. Rock <br/>
climbing nude seems likely to be a bit painful, but I think it is <br/>
pretty obvious that in far northern climes, it makes sense to bare as <br/>
much skin to the sun as possible, when you can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613007664">OK, I am about to leave this list, but before I go, I&#39;d like to say <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about letting our children make their own choices, <br/>
choose their own beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently that privilege does not extend to adults on this list.<br/>
<br/>
We all create our own reality.  Those that believe in a heaven and a <br/>
hell create that for themselves.  When they die, that is what they <br/>
will get.  And they will believe for all time that they were right, <br/>
and I was wrong, because their experience will tell them so.<br/>
<br/>
I create for myself a different reality.  Many people who have passed <br/>
over have come back to tell us of this reality.  Whether you believe <br/>
that or not is up to you, but it is evidence to me.  Many people have <br/>
had past life experiences that have been documented with hard facts.<br/>
<br/>
So, I don&#39;t care which one you believe, you have a right to believe <br/>
either one or neither one.  But just because you don&#39;t believe in my <br/>
reality doesn&#39;t mean it is invalid.<br/>
<br/>
I have my own unschooling group now, one where new ideas are <br/>
welcomed, as well as a new spiritualtiy group.  Anyone is welcome to <br/>
join them if they want.  <br/>

<br/>
So unborn people have free will but living breathing people are just acting <br/>
through a play decided before birth?<br/>
<br/>
With a screenname like &quot;Adonai,&quot; with a history of using ABeka and having <br/>
kids in Christian schools, how did you come so hard and fast to beliefs so <br/>
bizarrely different?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Therefore, whatever <br/>
reaction they have, they chose to have that reaction long before we <br/>
actually had that experience together.  Whatever lesson they had to <br/>
learn from it, they chose it.  I don&#39;t have to feel bad about what <br/>
they are experiencing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS THE BIG ONE:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I don&#39;t have to feel bad about what <br/>
they are experiencing. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I really don&#39;t like the &quot;this was all decided&quot; theory (and where <br/>
it came from, I have NO idea, but it&#39;s recent and it&#39;s harmful).<br/>
<br/>
It justifies abuse.<br/>
If you abuse your own children, you don&#39;t have to feel bad about what they <br/>
are experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
If your neighbor comes to you in fright in the middle of the night because <br/>
her husband is after her with a knife or a gun, you can refuse to let her in <br/>
because she chose that life, and you don&#39;t have to feel bad about what she&#39;s <br/>
experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
Really, where does that belief/justification come from?<br/>
Who is promulgating it?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s part of what has to happen to them for <br/>
them to choose to make their part of the world better by changing <br/>
their attitudes.  If they don&#39;t, well, there&#39;s a lesson there too, <br/>

foundation or simply because you &quot;disagree&quot; with it? I ask because I am <br/>
somewhat shocked that you don&#39;t realize that there is both historical and moral <br/>
validity to this belief system. While one may not agree with the premise of such <br/>
a system, to state that it lacks any historic premise is not only an invalid <br/>
statement, but shows complete ignorance of belief systems shared by many. The <br/>
fact that you seem to be stating there is lack of evidence for such a system to <br/>
exist, as opposed to asking for sources or simply stating you disagree, seems <br/>
to make it read as though your statements are factual when in actuality they <br/>
are opinion. What about her beliefs makes you so uncomfortable as to try to <br/>
call it bizarre? If she has moved on a spiritual path from christianity or <br/>
anything else to where she is now, what about that bothers you so as to continually <br/>
argue its existance? If it exists for her and her alone in the entire <br/>
Universe, it is valid because it exists. Validity does not require a congregational <br/>
following, it doesn&#39;t even require two parties to agree. It simply requires <br/>
that it be based on evidence, in which case, what is evidenciary to her, may not <br/>
be so for you. Either way the belief is still valid. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry Sandra, but your lack of knowledge in her belief system (which happens <br/>
to be encompassed by many Earth religions by the way, for many millenia) <br/>
doesn&#39;t negate it&#39;s existance. It simply means you may not understand it, like it, <br/>
agree with it or wish to learn about it. <br/>

science needs to be cautious about what it stamps as &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot;.<br/>

because the subjects don&#39;t appear to relate to unschooling issues.  I don&#39;t<br/>
have a problem with that, but I say this so you will all know that I<br/>
haven&#39;t been reading the main threads.<br/>
<br/>
I did read this one, however (it was a new subject).  And I find it very<br/>
sad to discover that someone feels they have to leave this list because<br/>
they have not been supported by it.  Like I said, I haven&#39;t been reading<br/>
any of the posts... but from this one email I can say &quot;who cares what<br/>
anyone else believes with respect to reincarnation or religion?&quot;  Why did<br/>
it have to become such a big deal so that Judie felt she had to leave?  And<br/>
was the argument, criticism, judgement, or whatever it was really that<br/>
important to the rest of the folks who participated?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really so sad that Judie felt so attacked about her own belief system<br/>
that she had to leave this list... and it&#39;s an unschooling support list at<br/>
that!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859835583">Compassion? Feel bad for her?<br/>
<br/>
I do too.<br/>
<br/>
But she wouldn&#39;t if the situation was reversed - she&#39;d just say that <br/>
you chose for it to happen because you wanted it to happen so you could <br/>
learn some lesson from it and that she shouldn&#39;t feel bad for you about <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t say that, myself, but I do say that when someone chooses (in <br/>
this here-and-now lifetime) to express beliefs on this list, that they <br/>
have been told in advance, in the list posting policies, that they will <br/>
be questioned and people should refrain from posting things they do not <br/>
want to respond about, if they&#39;re going to be upset by the questioning <br/>
of them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s not a support list. It&#39;s a discussion list for discussing<br/>
unschooling ideas. Here&#39;s the list description. The 4th paragraph defines<br/>
the purpose of the list pretty clearly I think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling is not a homeschool teaching method. It refers to a philosophy of<br/>
&gt; natural learning as well as the lifestyle that results from living according<br/>
&gt; to the principles of that philosophy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The most basic principle of unschooling is that children are born with an<br/>
&gt; intrinsic urge to explore -- for a moment or a lifetime -- what intrigues<br/>
&gt; them, as they seek to join the adult world in a personally satisfying way.<br/>
&gt; Because of that urge, an unschooling child is free to choose the what, when,<br/>
&gt; where and how of his/her own learning from mud puddles to video games and<br/>
&gt; SpongeBob Squarepants to Shakespeare! And an unschooling parent sees his/her<br/>
&gt; role, not as a teacher, but as a facilitator and companion in a child&#39;s<br/>
&gt; exploration of the world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling is a mindful lifestyle which encompasses, at its core, an<br/>
&gt; atmosphere of trust, freedom, joy and deep respect for who the child is. This<br/>
&gt; cannot be lived on a part-time basis. Unschooling sometimes seems so intuitive<br/>
&gt; that people feel they&#39;ve been doing it all along, not realizing it has a name.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling sometimes seems so counterintuitive that people struggle to<br/>
&gt; understand it, and it can take years to fully accept its worth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The purpose of this list is to move out of our own comfort zones as we<br/>
&gt; critically examine our beliefs, ideas, and viewpoints about learning, and seek<br/>
&gt; a deeper understanding of unschooling and more respectful relationships with<br/>
&gt; our children. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please read for at least a week or two, before posting, to get a feel for the<br/>
&gt; list. New members are on moderation, to avoid spam and other disruptions.<br/>
&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; can be found in the files area of this list or, along<br/>
&gt; with other list information, at: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/lists/info">http://www.sandradodd.com/lists/info</a>&gt;.<br/>

&gt; (This list is jointly owned by Joyce Fetteroll, Pam Sorooshian and Sandra<br/>
&gt; Dodd.) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pam just posted the short form of the guidelines, but here it is in the<br/>
longer form in case that makes the purpose of the list clearer for anyone:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; UnschoolingDiscussion Posting Policies<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is our sincere wish to provide a forum for those seeking to deepen their<br/>
&gt; understanding of the unschooling philosophy. The primary purpose of this<br/>
&gt; list is to encourage the critical examination of ideas, beliefs and<br/>
&gt; viewpoints. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Questioning of deeply-held ideas and beliefs can be very uncomfortable and<br/>
&gt; sometimes responses to that process can stand in the way of people getting<br/>
&gt; what they need out of the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Therefore, we offer the following guidelines to help our members get the<br/>
&gt; most from the list:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. Read for at least a couple of weeks before posting yourself. Spend that<br/>
&gt; time getting a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members. This will help you<br/>
&gt; decide if this list is worth your time or whether some other list might be<br/>
&gt; more useful to you in meeting your needs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity to<br/>
&gt; critically examine your own ideas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to discussing ideas, not the<br/>
&gt; person with whom you are disagreeing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to public<br/>
&gt; examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5. Before you hit &quot;send,&quot; consider whether your post will contribute<br/>
&gt; positively to the unschooling discussion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6. Avoid using loaded terminology. For instance, &quot;If you have no TV<br/>
&gt; restrictions why don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?&quot; will get you more<br/>
&gt; useful responses than, &quot;I don&#39;t see how your kids learn anything if all they<br/>
&gt; ever do is sit around like zombies watching unlimited TV.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 7. It is not useful to inform the list that you believe someone else is<br/>
&gt; being rude or discourteous; please trust the rest of the list to recognize<br/>
&gt; rudeness for themselves. Saying, &quot;Jane was rude to me,&quot; just bogs down the<br/>
&gt; list. It is also a waste of everyone&#39;s time when participants attempt to<br/>
&gt; correct or improve other list members&#39; manners. It never works and always<br/>
&gt; disrupts the list. Avoid<br/>
&gt; statements such as: &quot;Jane, here is my suggestion of how you could write more<br/>
&gt; nicely so people wouldn&#39;t think you are being rude.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 8. Our brains automatically supply a &quot;tone&quot; to posts as we read. It can be<br/>
&gt; helpful to imagine your best friend speaking the words you are reading, in<br/>
&gt; the gentlest, most well-meaning tone you can imagine. It is unacceptable to<br/>
&gt; attack the &quot;tone&quot; of the list or to make generalizations about it. &quot;I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been on many other lists and this one is the rudest I&#39;ve seen,&quot; would be<br/>
&gt; unacceptable. Instead, attempt to create a positive, helpful tone with your<br/>
&gt; own posts by setting the example you hope others will follow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 9. Envision every post and response as a dish at a potluck dinner. You won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; love every dish at a potluck any more than you will love every poster&#39;s<br/>
&gt; style of help. But a dish/post may be exactly what someone else needs. If<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t like a certain list member&#39;s offerings, skip them and<br/>
&gt; leave them for others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 10. Read and write as clearly as you can. In casual conversation we often<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t realize how much we rely on others to fill in the gist of our<br/>
&gt; conversation based on what they expect us to say. But here, without body<br/>
&gt; language or inflection, all we have to go on are your words and they should<br/>
&gt; say what you mean. If you say, for example, you &quot;never&quot; do something, it<br/>
&gt; should not mean &quot;almost never.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our goal is to make the list as useful as possible for those seeking to<br/>
&gt; deepen their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. To do that, all<br/>
&gt; new list members are initially moderated to prevent spamming and catch posts<br/>
&gt; that could disrupt the list. People will also be moderated if they disrupt<br/>
&gt; the usefulness of the list. Potentially disruptive posts will be returned<br/>
&gt; for revision. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have questions, please write to:<br/>

<br/>
I invite you to read through the archives of this list and to review <br/>
the ideas, as outlined in the &quot;rules&quot;, that inspire the discussions on <br/>
this list. Pam has already pointed to the files section if you want to <br/>
read them.<br/>
<br/>
It is the practice of many in this list to take with a grain of salt <br/>
and to question each and every one of the ideas and beliefs that have <br/>
brought them to the place of considering unschooling as an education <br/>
option for their children. Because, really, in the end, what you will <br/>
see is that unschooling is not an education option but a lifestyle <br/>
choice and that will have repercussions in the way you not only see and <br/>
think about the world but your daily practices.<br/>
<br/>
The speaking in the list, or writing, will be questioned and challenged <br/>
by those who have been unschooling for a while (especially Sandra) <br/>
because it is only this media, your words, that people can &quot;know&quot; you. <br/>
Which is why the guidelines of the list say:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to<br/>
&gt; public examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>

<br/>
I should have also added, Tia L, Pam, Joyce, and others I cant think of <br/>
right now ... Combined they have like, what, a kazillion years of <br/>
unschooling their children and/or children&#39;s children? They are bound <br/>
to steer the discussions ... and that is a good thing.<br/>
