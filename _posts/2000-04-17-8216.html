I
<br>don&#39;t think you&#39;d let your child lead you to give her lessons in arson,
if
<br>she were interested in burning things, would you? :)&nbsp; There are

well pulling some notion of possible &#39;desires&#39; out of the air makes the
discussion unreal and impossible.&nbsp; the desire to play piano and the
desire to break the law are hardly comparable and removes the whole element
of safety which is of concern to every parent.&nbsp; imo this statement
would fall nicely under teri&#39;s request for fallacies of unschooling &#39;unschoolers
allow their children to learn anything even if it&#39;s illegal&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
so my question to you is:&nbsp; have you known of a child who had this
type of desire?&nbsp; do you know unschooling parents who willing endanger
the lives of their children and the lives of others just because their
child expressed an interest?
<blockquote TYPE="CITE">If my daughter had her way, we&#39;d provide gymnastics,
swimming, horseback
<br>riding, piano lessons, and a host of other enriching activities.&nbsp;
I would
<br>love to give her ample opportunity for each and every one of these
<br>activities, but there&#39;s a few problems.&nbsp; One, there&#39;s simply not
enough time
<br>to do all these things; Two, we don&#39;t have the money; and Three, she
is not
<br>real serious about any of the ones she&#39;s tried so far.</blockquote>
even holt says that &#39;you don&#39;t have to have every resource for your child&#39;
(<u>teach your own</u> pg 42) and even if you could there simply is not
enough time to utilize these resources, but this is somewhat common sense
and if it&#39;s not it&#39;s quickly learned once in the trenches.&nbsp;&nbsp;
i would like to add that there is a clear difference between a desire and
a whim,&nbsp; your statement disregards the possibility of a dialog between
parent and child where this information could easily be obtained.&nbsp;
imo this dialog is key and is an essential component to unschooling.&nbsp;
everyone works within their own given limitation (such is the nature of
life and since unschooler learn from life this too would become apparent
if not already experienced e.g. if 2 events are at the same time you have
choose one and not the other hence limitation is experienced so most children
are aware of this reality)&nbsp; but the piano lesson example was given
in the context of the mother rejecting her own experience of having to
take lessons putting this in place of her daughters desire to learn piano.&nbsp;
no other reason was given (e.i $, safety, whim etc.)
<blockquote TYPE="CITE">But when she doesn&#39;t follow through on her end
<br>of the deal--for example, wearing the safety equipment needed, or placing
her
<br>hands on the keys like her teachers says--then it&#39;s time to rethink
the
<br>lessons.&nbsp; Periodically we&#39;ll give her a new chance to try if she&#39;s
still
<br>interested, and if she&#39;s willing to be fully cooperative with the
<br>restrictions inherent in the situation, then lessons will continue
as long as
<br>she is cooperative and we can work out any other problems.&nbsp; But
I&#39;m under no
<br>obligation to provide opportunities to someone who won&#39;t appreciate
and make
<br>the most of them.</blockquote>
this is completely personal and between you and your daughter.&nbsp; these
hurdles, found in all relationships,&nbsp; are typically handles as the
relationship warrants,&nbsp; it is not for me to say (unless of course
you would ask my opinion:)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i&#39;m a firm believer in dialoging
but that&#39;s me and my son seems to do very well with this type of relationship.&nbsp;
we have a budget (we&#39;re luck to clear $28,000/yr) and all decisions on
how we spend our money is made by the whole family and even though rene&#39;
is only 4 his opinion is always regarded as valid and important (we are
presently saving up for a chemistry lab and microscope - he had a choice
between this and a video game player, he chose a chem. lab).&nbsp; he also
knows when it comes to safety it falls in my domain and we discuss it and
find a safe way he can reach his goals -&nbsp; we just had to deal w this
because of the chem lab and we&#39;ve had to limit the type of chemicals because
of his age and dexterity.
<blockquote TYPE="CITE">If my child had a burning *need* to do something--for
example, a child who is
<br>a serious competitive swimmer, or who finds that music, or animals,
or
<br>whatever, is her life, then I would move heaven and earth to provide
that
<br>opportunity.&nbsp; But most kids are just experimenting, which is fine,
if done
<br>with the understanding that it not take over the family&#39;s time and
income.
<p>Well, so much for my plan to lurk :)

i&#39;m sorry that you interpreted my statement as completely disregarding
reality.&nbsp; imo unschooling is <u>always</u> in context of real life
and family - one member&#39;s desires should never always usurp another rights
and desires.&nbsp; yes we must juggle the desires of all the members of
the family (and for some people the state and extended family as well)
though this is challenging at times it&#39;s also beautiful when it&#39;s working.
