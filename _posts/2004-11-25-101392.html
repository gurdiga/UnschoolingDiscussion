<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428913764">&quot;You&#39;re in Florida?! Ah there are a lot of Unschoolers in different <br/>
parts of<br/>
Florida, including Ren. Try www.nhen.org for local groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah see....I should have read before posting!! Robyn beat me to the <br/>
punch.:)<br/>
I should also mention that unschooling.com and unschooling.info both <br/>
have fabulous message boards and both include an area for finding <br/>
people in your part of the country.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
