<div id="ygrps-yiv-251578960">Hi All,<br/>
  Yesterday was a warm but rainy day. The natives were getting restless so I <br/>
decided to take a walk. Two of my children dd 2 and dd 6 happily agreed to <br/>
come with me. While taking a walk in the rain we came to a grated sewer drain. We <br/>
stood there for quite a while watching the water flow in from two drains then <br/>
go out one larger one. We became entranced. My six year old then became VERY <br/>
excited and asked numerous questions about the creation of the sewer system, <br/>
who invented it, when, where, why, etc.... I answered as much as I knew, then <br/>
when Dad came home he in turn did the same (thankfully he&#39;s much more <br/>
knowledgeable on the subject). She was FAIRLY content but would like more info in books <br/>
or videos. I found a few of each from our local library but still not enough. <br/>
(I actually found one video for the actual sewer system in our area!!) She <br/>
has always been interested in architecture in various degrees but now has a new <br/>
found excitement to explore unknown territories in her world. <br/>
   Any suggestions will be appreciated!!! Thanks in advance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did you clarify for your kids that what you were looking at was a storm<br/>
drain, not the sanitary sewer that takes away the waste from your toilet?<br/>
Storm drains are separate systems which, at least here in San Diego, lead<br/>
directly to the ocean.  This is why people are discouraged from washing<br/>
their cars on the street, using pesticides on their lawns, etc.  Also, some<br/>
storm drains can be very dangerous; a 4 y.o. was rescued from one just last<br/>
week.<br/>

&quot;We each have only a limited amount of time here.  We have to do more with<br/>
it -- pay attention, explore, be open to all of life.  Because we have only<br/>
one chance, we have to make life seem longer than it really is.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, we did talk about the fact that we were looking at a storm sewer. We <br/>
also talked about the sanitary sewer and the fact that we just recently (2 or 3 <br/>
yrs. ago) had to go from septic to sanitary sewer on our street. I think that&#39;s <br/>
what helped with the fasination. Of course my smarty pants husband thought I <br/>
didn&#39;t know the difference LOL!!! I guess our storm sewer in our neighborhood <br/>
lets out in a nearby creek (at least that&#39;s what my husband informed us) BUT I <br/>
still wouldn&#39;t want to get trapped in one!!! Too bad for the little one your <br/>
talking about in California. Oh, we also found a lost hockey stick in there as <br/>
well.lol<br/>
  Thanks for the info!!!<br/>

Good point.  And here, to the Rio Grande.<br/>
