 </span></blockquote>CHARGE is an acronym for a set of birth defects,  the letters coming from<br/>
some of the most common features.<br/>
C  is for coloboma ( cleft of the eyeball ), causing vision loss or<br/>
blindness and cranial nerves a kind of facial palsy, swallowing problems,<br/>
 nerve damage, etc.<br/>
H  heart defects<br/>
A  artresia of the choanae, (nose and throat passage<br/>
deformities)affecting breathing.<br/>
R  retardation of growth development <br/>
G genital and urinary abnormalities<br/>
E  Ear  abnormalities and hearing loss.<br/>
<br/>
There are usually other problems but these are the most common.  It is<br/>
genetic.<br/>
It occurs in about 1 in 12000 births, affecting all races, boys and girls<br/>
equally.<br/>
<br/>
A little boy with CHARGE syndrome may be coming to live with us.  I&#39;m<br/>
taking a crash course.  He&#39;s seven and has no effective way to<br/>
communicate that his care givers now can understand.  ( I don&#39;t know why<br/>
he doesn&#39;t sign,  and since he&#39;s  deaf,  doctors may have incorrectly<br/>
diagnosed mental retardation. )  He&#39;s been in the hospital most of his<br/>
young life.  Unschooling will be the way to go as the ps  system has said<br/>
they won&#39;t take him.  He was described to us as having severe behavioral<br/>
problems.  We&#39;re scrambling to learn as much as we can.  I&#39;m finding a<br/>
great deal of information actually, just wondered about personal stories.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
