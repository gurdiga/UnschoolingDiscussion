<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512181948">I&#39;ve felt &#39;ambushed at times, too.  When I first started exploring<br/>
unschooling and  found this list...and tried to contribute in my own way.<br/>
Well,  every time my hot buttons get pushed...I&#39;ve been challenged to open<br/>
my mind and think it through to a deeper level.<br/>
<br/>
People get complacent.....several people on this list (including,  but not<br/>
limited to Sandra) have the ability to knock people out of their<br/>
complacency.  Just when you think you&#39;ve got the parenting,  unschooling<br/>
&#39;thing&#39; down pat....it gets pointed out that maybe you DON&#39;T...there&#39;s more<br/>
growth to come.  Most people who are products of the school system have<br/>
thought patterns about learning deeply ingrained into them....even if you<br/>
WANT to be different,  it takes a lot of effort to prevent falling into old<br/>
patterns.<br/>
<br/>
And I can&#39;t speak for anyone else,  but where I&#39;m living,  I only know of<br/>
one other unschooling family,  and our paths rarely cross since our<br/>
children&#39;s ages and interests rarely cross.  So I&#39;m surrounded by those who<br/>
think differently than I.   I tend to keep the peace most of the time<br/>
(although less and less as I clarify my reasoning)......I hope to be a<br/>
person who can &quot;wake others up&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve been &#39;around&#39; these boards since the old HEM days... about 9<br/>
&gt; &gt;years or so????... not that I think that matters but since you were<br/>
&gt; &gt;pointing out how long you&#39;ve been reading Sandra&#39;s posts, I thought<br/>
&gt; &gt;I should do the same. Back in the old days, every single time I<br/>
&gt; &gt;posted something, she was lying in wait to ambush my posts. It<br/>
&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t take long for me to go into silent mode and just watch the<br/>
&gt; &gt;fur fly with someone else. She&#39;s been bickering for quite a long<br/>
&gt; &gt;time. That&#39;s not to say she&#39;s not had some very informative advice<br/>
&gt; &gt;or information... just that the tone has always been this way with<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sandra.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to support what Sarah writes here. Over the years Sandra and I<br/>
&gt; have had our differences, too. Long-time HEM readers will know this<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t the first time she&#39;s been an HEM columnist...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just FWIW. Water under the bridge. But perhaps it contributes perspective.<br/>
