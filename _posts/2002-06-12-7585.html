<h4>The White&#39;s</h4>
<time>12 Jun 2002, at  4:43am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802415903">When I was a child my uncle found a fawn while hunting.  I&#39;ve never been quite sure if he or one of his fellow hunters had actually killed the mother or not, but I think they were rabbit hunting at the time.  Anyway, he brought it home and raised it.  I have no idea what he fed him at first (it was a young buck) but I do have very clear memories of my uncle cutting pieces from an apple with his pocketknife and feeding them to &quot;Billygoat&quot;.  Billygoat loved my uncle, ran to greet him when he saw him coming and would put his front hoofs on my uncle&#39;s shoulders.  He would also let us pet him and would play games with my uncle&#39;s dog!!  <br/>
<br/>
When he got old enough he began acting more like a deer.  Running and jumping all through the pastures and fields.  Eventually someone did kill Billygoat during deer hunting season and because my uncle lived in such a small community everyone seemed to know it was his deer.  This was probably in 1972 or earlier so I don&#39;t know if the Fish & Game Warden would have cared then.  And being killed by hunters was a realistic concern for my uncle because he never tried to keep Billygoat penned; he had free run of the place and came and went as he pleased.  He was always given treats to eat and petted so he came every day, even once he had racks.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Legs, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find he&#39;s very affectionate!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214285810">that is a sad story  but it sounds like Billgoat had a<br/>
good life with your uncle while it lasted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-580059030">Recess has started (thanks Julie)  The following was a<br/>
posted on a local list by one of the participants :-) <br/>
Sharon of the Swamp<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of us were able to accept Sharon Rudd&#39;s<br/>
invitation for RECESS at her home on the St. Mary&#39;s<br/>
River last Tuesday.  We had such a great time!  It&#39;s<br/>
so pretty and peaceful there.  She&#39;s left the<br/>
invitation open for every Tuesday from 12-2 or 3. <br/>
Bring a towel, water shoes (suggested), sunscreen,<br/>
lunch or snack, and something to catch and keep<br/>
minnows and tadpoles (also just a suggestion).  We<br/>
enjoyed meeting their 2 wk old baby deer, their<br/>
horses, kittens, dog Spot and much more.  Hope to see<br/>
many more there next week. <br/>
If anyone else has any ideas for summer group fun, let<br/>
us know! <br/>
Suzanne <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823007109">We&#39;ve had a pregnant doe coming around for some months now <br/>
with her yearling (a young guy with little nubs for antlers so far).  <br/>
We haven&#39;t seen them for a few days now and are wondering if <br/>
she&#39;s had the fawn yet.  We are hoping she brings it round as <br/>
soon as it&#39;s old enough. Tamzin is very excited about the whole <br/>
thing.  <br/>
We think that there are baby squirrels in a tree out front.  If we get <br/>
too close to the tree in question, the squirrel in residence comes <br/>
out and scolds and scolds us.  She was shaking her fist and <br/>
screeching at me today while I was watering.  Tamzin looked up <br/>
at her and said, &quot;you have to share the garden, and we won&#39;t hurt <br/>
your babies anyway&quot; &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
There was an ENORMOUS raccoon outside last night!  I thought <br/>
it was a person walking around (it was so foot heavy and noisy) <br/>
and I turned on the porch light.  He was right outside the door.  <br/>
We gave each other a bit of a shock &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873436199">Where did everybody go?  Nobody came to Recess<br/>
yesterday either. Or emailed, or called. :-( .  Roy<br/>
was sad. He had even put away his crafts projects so<br/>
that the legos or board games or movies (places to<br/>
sit) could be accessed as it looked like rain.<br/>
<br/>
Last week (at Recess)we did get invited to to church<br/>
and church functions several times. And me to the next<br/>
&quot;Home-educator&#39;s mother&#39;s night out&quot;.  Sigh. At least<br/>
we weren&#39;t asked NOT to come :-). One Mama was<br/>
particulary interested in unschooling as something she<br/>
and her daughter might prefer :-) I promised to send<br/>
links....please someone post a GOOD list of links that<br/>
I can cut and paste for her. Those with a heavy<br/>
missioniary Christian leaning will speak to her<br/>
listening best. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-336834326">Legs eats every 6 hours now, instead of every 4. He is<br/>
SO cute. The longest eyelashes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DH bought poison for outdoor fleas instead of<br/>
diatamaceous earth. I already used lime (can&#39;t be too<br/>
different) and the population is reduced, but not<br/>
eliminated.  I use the (dog)lime to keep mites and<br/>
such down in the chicken pen and to keep the fly<br/>
population down. Gives the chickens and ducks a little<br/>
calcium, and neutralizes odors, too.  I put out fresh<br/>
hay for all of the critters every few days. (They all<br/>
eat it) DH thinks it is totally unnessecary.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t mind flies and odors, I guess. Or he just says<br/>
that so that I&#39;ll do it? Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks I couldn&#39;t go for hay so I raked up<br/>
leaves (mostly water oak, magnolia, and sweet gum) and<br/>
used them.  They decayed too fast under the rabbit<br/>
cages and flies layed eggs.  Horse flies. Yuck.  I dug<br/>
all that out and gave it to the chickens.  They<br/>
thought it was a buffet. I am gratefull to the humble<br/>
chickens.  They eat what I want to get rid of and give<br/>
us wonderful huge brown eggs.<br/>
<br/>
The horses were jealous of the hay in the duck/rabbit<br/>
pen and kicked some holes in it.  They had LOTS of<br/>
their own hay. It was just on the other side of the<br/>
fence.  Spot, the dog, likes to eat the chicken&#39;s<br/>
corn, and the rabbits food.  Not becuase he likes it,<br/>
he is just jealous. The cats eat the horse feed.  They<br/>
actually like it. <br/>
<br/>
I think I will convert the little porch that Legs is<br/>
on to a bird aviary when he gets too big.  It<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be too hard.  Then the cockatiel can sit on<br/>
DH&#39;s head without pooping on the speakers or getting<br/>
dander in my coffee.  Maybe plant some stuff that the<br/>
bird can fertilize.  I have sprouted bird seed all<br/>
over outdoors, now.  Millet is heading.  Wonder how I<br/>
can do that on the porch, so that it will be like the<br/>
zoo. Pretty and comfortable, too. The area is 5&#39;X 10&#39;<br/>
Just right for two or so cockatiels. We have one<br/>
lonesome female, now. They tolerate the weather here<br/>
OK.  The breeder who gave her to Roy keeps hers in an<br/>
outdoor (big) cage with breeding boxes.  It is<br/>
terribly noisy.  Our bird is sweet and sings.  If she<br/>
has a friend I wonder if her people personality will<br/>
deteriorate?<br/>
<br/>
Torential rains nearby. Drizzle here.<br/>
