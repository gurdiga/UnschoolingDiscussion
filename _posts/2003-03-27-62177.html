<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012758520">Friends came over tonight to play.   We played &quot;Who Am I? The Biography<br/>
Game.&quot;<br/>
So this is for some new people who are still puzzling about TV and what<br/>
kids will learn.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve never seen this game it&#39;s like a modern Trivial Pursuit where<br/>
all the questions are about people. <br/>
We were three adults and four children playing.   Dylan was the youngest<br/>
at ten and the others twelve, thirteen and fifteen.<br/>
<br/>
Now, these other kids don&#39;t get to watch The Simpsons so it was actually<br/>
pretty funny when Dylan answered questions right and said &quot;That was on<br/>
the Simpsons!&quot;   I wonder if their mom will give it some thought now?    <br/>
<br/>
Some of the clues my son answered were for Karl Marx,  The Who,  Pope<br/>
John Paul II, Paul Newman, Maya Angelou,  Walt Whitman,  Davy Crockett, <br/>
Jesse Jackson, Steven Hawking and Eric Clapton.  Dylan had the third<br/>
highest score and the highest of the kids, who were all older and in<br/>
public school.   We can attribute most of what he knew to the Simpsons<br/>
and other TV shows and at least one answer to popcorn.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
