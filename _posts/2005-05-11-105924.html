<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549616819">Help!  My daughter&#39;s and I just received the yearly assessment testing booklet and were looking it over and I felt that it was ok, not too bad.  My oldest who has been in ps for 8 years, and is used to those tests, was just amazed at how small it was compared to the tests she had at school.  Anyway, we started these tests and my youngest, who&#39;s always had a slight test anxiety, stated freaking out about it!  She just kept saying she didn&#39;t know this stuff and if she were in school she would have been taught all this and that she is stupid for not knowing it!  the test contained alot of US history and we only learned about Ancient history this semester, so her panic is justified in that sense, but I am just at a loss of what to tell her!  I know these tests are a generlization and this is stuff she proabably should have learned already in ps, but I can;&#39;t convince her that just becuase this is what they &quot;say&quot; you should know, doesn&#39;t mean that you have to know it to be smart!  Can<br/>
 anybody help here?  I have read Grace Lewellyn&#39;s book&#39;s and would love to stay in a more unschooled/relaxed manner, but if she panics every year at testing time, maybe I should be more concerned with teaching what &quot;they say&quot; she should know or she&#39;s gonna end up hating homeschooling, and I don&#39;t want that to happen.  She does not function well in ps.  Any suggestions?  Anyone been there before?  Also, I would love to know if there is a book out there that is made for a younger unschooler?  Like a Teenage Liberation Handbook for elementary age students?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886704997">What are the alternatives? Is some other type of evaluation possible <br/>
legally? Also, what test are you doing? Can you choose a different <br/>
test? What is the required score, if any? Who sees the results (is <br/>
it &#39;submitted&#39; or &#39;retained&#39;)? In most places you are not legally <br/>
required to take the same tests as the public schools. They may limit <br/>
which ones you can choose from (generally it has to be a &#39;nationally <br/>
normed&#39; test) but it usually is NOT the same as the public schools. <br/>
And for good reason - homeschoolers don&#39;t follow the same schedules as <br/>
public schools. Check out your state laws and check out this article <br/>
on the subject of meeting state laws and testing and all <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t remember all the buzzwords, (maybe &quot;norm-referenced test&quot;?) but for many types of school achievement testing, a &quot;desirable&quot; test question is one that half of the kids will get wrong.  This yields a broader spread of scores, which makes the test results more interesting for the test maker than if the scores were all clumped up.  They really do look for questions to ask that many kids don&#39;t know!<br/>
<br/>
I read a chapter in my husband&#39;s educational psychology textbook about testing and I was pretty shocked.  I had initially assumed that performance testing, showing subject mastery, was the purpose of all tests, but that ain&#39;t so all the time.<br/>
<br/>
(I think this book is still in the garage, if people want to hear this in less fuzzy terms, and no one else has it right in the front of their brains, to fill in what I have glided over.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why most of the scores are reported in percentile rather than <br/>
percentage. At the 50th percentile, half the kids got higher scores, <br/>
half got lower scores. So, if you had 3 kids a take a 10 question <br/>
test and one got 5 correct, one got 3 correct and one got 1 correct, <br/>
the percentages would be 50, 30, 10 but the percentiles would be 99, <br/>
50, 1 (I don&#39;t think 100 or 0 are possible but I&#39;m not sure - you <br/>
get the drift anyhow). <br/>

<br/>
What are the requirements for your state?  For us, we only have to <br/>
report LA and Math results.  I know folks that order tests with only <br/>
LA and Math or skip the sections not required.  Also, we only have <br/>
to score around 25th percentile.  The test gives 4 answers per <br/>
problem.  I asked the boys what is the likeliness you can &quot;guess&quot; <br/>
the right answer?  Even a random guess should give you a result in <br/>
the 25th percentile.  Also, I explained this test means nothing to <br/>
me.  It&#39;s a silly requirement for the state.  I pulled out a &quot;test <br/>
prep&quot; book and told the kids if they want to look this over before <br/>
they test they can.  Oh, I gave tips like in reading comprehension <br/>
you can read the questions first, then read the paragraph.  Hope <br/>
this helps.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Short answer:  Don&#39;t test.<br/>
 <br/>
Without more details, we don&#39;t know how viable an option that is for your  <br/>
family.<br/>
 <br/>
Some families (TOO many) test just because &quot;their dad wants us to&quot; or &quot;we  <br/>
wanted to know how they were doing&quot; or &quot;in case they go to school...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The test scores themselves are harmful to people, and to  relationships.  The <br/>
test scores and the test anxiety are harmful to the  health of natural <br/>
learning.<br/>
