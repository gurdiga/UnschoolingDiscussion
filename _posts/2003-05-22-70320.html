Reading Roads<br/>
<br/>
Learning to read is like learning to ride a bicycle. Some kids are presented<br/>
with training wheels at an early age. Some receive formal instruction.<br/>
Some watch older siblings. Some are given shiny new bikes for Christmas,<br/>
just the right size, and some forage some old beat-up balloon-tired Schwinn <br/>
from a neighbor&#39;s dilapidated garage. Some peddle along on the sides of <br/>
bicycles made for adults, the only available two-wheelers, so<br/>
large they can&#39;t reach their leg over the cross-bar or otherwise get to<br/>
the peddles. For some it takes months to get up the nerve to try. Others<br/>
just jump on without any preparation whatsoever and ride away. Some are<br/>
younger, some are older; some end up loving it, and others decide they<br/>
have more important things to do with their time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
The kids learn to read if there are lots of children&#39;s books in the house,<br/>
adult books, or just a few old magazines. They learn to read if they are<br/>
read aloud to from the time they can sit up, or if storytime is ignored.<br/>
They learn to read if they watch Sesame Street, or the X files, or if<br/>
television isn&#39;t allowed in the house. They learn to read even if they are<br/>
obsessed with computer games that require no reading, or if all they<br/>
seem interested in is gymnastics or dance or the succesors to Pokemon.<br/>
They learn to read if they have powers of concentration that would put<br/>
adults to shame, or if they never seem to be able to sit still.<br/>

<br/>
Older Blooming Readers<br/>
<br/>
If your child shows little interest in learning to read on her own, she may<br/>
be an older-bloooming reader. I&#39;ll tell you not to worry, that your child will<br/>
learn to read in her own good time. Not worrying is not so easy, though,<br/>
particularly when siblings, sometimes younger siblings, or the public<br/>
school children across the street, are reading chapter books and your<br/>
child hasn&#39;t mastered a primer such as the Bob Books, and worse yet,<br/>
doesn&#39;t appear to have any desire to read. Try to avoid panicking, and<br/>
don&#39;t let your child know that you are worried.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling families can avoid the biggest disadvantage to late reading<br/>
- feeling stupid. If your child is an older blooming reader, be happy he is<br/>
homeschooling and not in school being labeled learning disabled (because<br/>
he is not) or feeling humiliated by teachers and peers. Reassure your<br/>
child (if he is concerned) that he will find his own time and way of learning<br/>
to read. Meanwhile, keep the love of reading alive. Tell him over and over<br/>
that you know he loves reading because he enjoys being read to. Remind<br/>
him that everyone is unique. Try to find an adult - someone your child<br/>
knows and who now enjoys reading - who was also a delayed reader. It can<br/>
give you (and your child) some perspective.<br/>
<br/>
You should also remind him that there are many other important skills to<br/>
know and many ways to learn besides reading. Isn&#39;t he learning all the<br/>
time? Many older-blooming readers are very active physically and learn<br/>
many difficult sports and skills. Help him make a list of all the things he<br/>
knows how to do and subjects he has learned without the benefit of read-<br/>
ing. Remind him that everyone learns difficult skills when they are ready,<br/>
and reading is no different.<br/>

Benefits of Later Literacy<br/>
<br/>
You may wonder if late reading makes it more difficult for a child to take<br/>
in complex materials when he does begin to read. I have found that though<br/>
Britt read at age 4 and Maggie at age 11, by age 12 both were reading<br/>
the same material. Maggie has an easier time understanding what she<br/>
reads now since she read at a later age and therefore never read any-<br/>
thing she did not understand. It seems important that a child understand<br/>
what he reads rather than just recognizing words. It makes me think of<br/>
something Rosseau wrote in Emile, &quot;Books teach us to talk about things<br/>
we know nothing about.&quot; Many books written for young children to read to<br/>
themselves are filled with informational material that is not very valuable<br/>
to them. Because of this I&#39;ve found that children might just as well wait<br/>
until their understanding is such that the material they read can be <br/>
assim-ilated and used. <br/>

Serious Play<br/>
<br/>
For a healthy and active fantasy life children need time, space, and pri-<br/>
vacy, or at least only as much companionship as they choose. Obviously<br/>
school, or any other large-group situation --- day care center, nursery<br/>
school, play group, etc. --- does not allow much of this. Perhaps worst<br/>
of all, they are usually under the eye and control of adults who, even if<br/>
they will allow children a fantasy life, feel they have to watch it, under-<br/>
stand what it means, judge it, make use of it. It was for just this reason<br/>
that a well-meaning and quite highly praised book, written about ten years<br/>
ago, called Fantasy and Feeling in Childhood, seemed and still seems to me <br/>
deeply mistaken. The gist of it (and there may well be many books like it)<br/>
was that if we, i.e., people who work in schools, paid enough attention to<br/>
the fantasy lives of children, we could learn to uderstand them and bend<br/>
them to our own purposes.<br/>
<br/>
This would be a great mistake and a great wrong. Instead, we should be<br/>
content to watch and enjoy as much of children&#39;s fantasy lives as they<br/>
will let us see, and to take part in them, if the children ask us to and if we<br/>
can do so happily and unselfconsciously. Otherwise, we should leave them<br/>
alone. Children&#39;s fantasy is useful and important to them for many rea-<br/>
sons, but above all because it is theirs, the one part of their lives which is<br/>
wholly under their control. We must resist the temptation to make it<br/>
ours.<br/>
<br/>
We must also resist the equally great temptation to think that this part<br/>
of children&#39;s lives is less important than the parts where they are doing<br/>
something &quot;serious&quot; --- reading, or writing, or doing schoolwork, or some-<br/>
thing that we want them to do --- or to think that we can only allow them<br/>
time for fantasy after all the important work is done, as we might give<br/>
them a piece of candy after a meal. For children, play and fantasy are<br/>
one of the main courses of the meal. Children should be able to do them,<br/>
not just in what little tag ends of time remain after all the &quot;important&quot;<br/>
work is done, but when they are most full of energy and enthusiasm. We<br/>
talk these days of &quot;quality time.&quot; Children need quality time for their<br/>
fantasy and play as much as for their reading or math. They need to play<br/>
well as much as they need to read well. Indeed, we would probably find if<br/>
we looked into it that children who are not good at playing, dreaming, fan-<br/>
tasizing, are usually not much good at reading either.<br/>

F.U.N. Books Special<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we acquired the John Holt Bookstore, we never thought we would<br/>
have the chance to carry a new book by John Holt (who died in 1985).<br/>
Okay, it&#39;s not a &quot;completely&quot; new book, but it is newly revised and has lots<br/>
of new information. Long out of print (with used copies often going for<br/>
much more than the original purchase price!), the classic &quot;Teach Your<br/>
Own&quot; has now been updated and re-released.<br/>
<br/>
The new version is entitled &quot;Teach Your Own - The John Holt Book of<br/>
Homeschooling.&quot; Appropriately enough, it has been updated and edited by<br/>
Patrick Farenga, the president of Holt Associates. Pat has combined<br/>
personal stories and the resources from his own book, &quot;The Beginners<br/>
Guide to Homeschooling,&quot; with this classic work by the father of the<br/>
modern homeschooling movement. The original was published in 1981 and<br/>
was the source of inspiration for many parents considering homeschool.<br/>
Holt&#39;s words are every bit as inspiring today and show a timeless common<br/>
sense that will have you nodding your head in agreement as you read<br/>
along.<br/>
<br/>
This book will help you avoid the trap of turning your home into a<br/>
miniature school. Instead, you will be encouraged to take advantage of the <br/>
flexibility homeschooling offers you to provide an educational<br/>
experience that is nearly impossible to duplicate in schools. If you are<br/>
already homeschooling but have ever had moments of self-doubt, or<br/>
wondered how to face relatives who question your decision, then this<br/>
book will restore your confidence and remind you of the many benefits of<br/>
the path you have chosen. If you are just getting started or only<br/>
considering homeschooling, then this book will help open your eyes about<br/>
the many possibilities and will supply you with a wealth of information and<br/>
resources to help you on your way.<br/>
<br/>
Legal advice and suggestions for countering common objections to<br/>
homeschooling are included. An extensive bibliography and several<br/>
appendices will provide you with information on other books,<br/>
correspondence programs, curriculum suppliers, helpful private schools,<br/>
homeschooling organizations, learning materials, and opportunities and<br/>
activities. This is a &quot;must have&quot; book for every homeschooler!<br/>
<br/>
List price is $18.00, but for a limited time is available from FUN Books<br/>
for $12.50.  Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/specials.htm">http://www.fun-books.com/specials.htm</a><br/>

The Last Word<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had a dollar for every ... defender of the schools who talks about<br/>
Real Life; it&#39;s almost never the fascinating courses, or the challenging<br/>
teachers - their only concern [is] that home-schooled children will miss<br/>
the &quot;social life&quot; of schools. And when I point out that for the most part<br/>
the social life of schools is mean-spirited, selfish, snobbish, conformist,<br/>
ruthless, cold-hearted and often downright cruel and violent, nobody<br/>
disagrees. &quot;That&#39;s Real Life.&#39;&quot; they say, ... &quot;[y]ou have to prepare children<br/>
for the real world. How else are they ever going to get along with<br/>
others?&quot; Notice that they don&#39;t mean others who treat each other with<br/>
kindness and dignity; they can&#39;t seem to conceive of that ...<br/>
