My 4yo is begining to show an intrest in games so this is perfect for her.  And they work with the gaming controller so she doesn&#39;t have to use the keyboard which is great too.  I love old original nintendo games.  They rock!!  Ah, the Jr.High memories!!!  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First you need an emulator for the game system. There&#39;s some great Mac ones<br/>
at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://emulation.net/index.html">http://emulation.net/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
(If anyone needs emulators for PC&#39;s the best ROM sites should have them or<br/>
have links to sites that have them.)<br/>
<br/>
Then you need to download the ROMs (games). I think there&#39;s some links at<br/>
Emulation.net that I started with. And then used the links on the best of<br/>
those to find other sites. The emulators are machine specific. The ROMs are<br/>
universal so you don&#39;t need to look for ROMs for the Mac or ROMs for the PC.<br/>
<br/>
(From what I&#39;ve casually read the disk based game machines (Playstation,<br/>
GameCube, X-Box) and games don&#39;t emulate very well.)<br/>
<br/>
The sites tend to come and go because the best become too popular with too<br/>
many people downloading so the domain owners shut them down. And some sites<br/>
exist solely for the purpose of generating ad revenue and are entirely popup<br/>
ads with a list of other sites (with popup ads.)<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s some links I&#39;ve used that had huge selections of ROMS:<br/>
