<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707999875">&quot;And is it not ironic that the interview itself was on TV, and so the<br/>
website architect who heard that and chose it and put it on a webpage<br/>
to discourage TV use would never have heard that quote had it not<br/>
been for TV?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it ironic that he reached millions of people through his ad<br/>
campaign via television?  Just how does he think political candidates<br/>
reach most people? Let&#39;s see, State of the Union, political campaigns,<br/>
press conferences etc...all depend heavily on television distribution.<br/>
duh.<br/>

Dubba&#39; Duh.<br/>

Well, I&#39;m having fun looking through very crazy websites.  Some  <br/>
people probably think my unschooling page is a very crazy website.   <br/>
Probably think Satan sent me, and that I&#39;m advocating the downfall of  <br/>
pharmaceutical companies who supply Ritalin.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday I was talking to a friend of mine, former best friend,  <br/>
now gradually distanced for various reasons.  I mention kids behind  <br/>
us are (or one of them is) dealing drugs over the back fence into the  <br/>
alley; people park near our back gate, and an exchange is made over  <br/>
the wall.  Must involve cell phones.  Keith and I discussed whether  <br/>
to report, decided no... conversational details flowed both ways.  I  <br/>
said it&#39;s probably the best thing in that kid&#39;s life, maybe the first  <br/>
time he&#39;s been successful and not being berated by his dad.   She  <br/>
said &quot;if it&#39;s just pot, it&#39;s not so bad.&quot;  I said maybe, but looked  <br/>
to be very small packets, so probably cocaine or speed.  Friend said  <br/>
that was worse,  and that maybe it was okay for us not to report  <br/>
them, as long as they weren&#39;t selling ritalin to kids or anything.    <br/>
Honestly, at that point her phone was not so clear for some reason,  <br/>
and I missed a few words, but I laughed and said &quot;Kids have NO  <br/>
problem getting Ritalin; it&#39;s the moms who seem to want it.&quot;  My  <br/>
friend obviously didn&#39;t think it was funny, and we had to go anyway,  <br/>
but I thought it was nigh on hilarious that if it was pot, okay, but  <br/>
if a kid might get Ritalin, it was becoming my duty to call the cops.<br/>
<br/>
I was disappointed this wasn&#39;t about TV, but it&#39;s about Ritalin.  Old  <br/>
guy in Canada says it&#39;s a shame they&#39;re drugging kids instead of  <br/>
spanking them.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?</a> <br/>
ARTICLE_ID=51284  I thought only Americans were that way.<br/>
<br/>
I am THRILLED, giddy, that my kids have never been near someone who  <br/>
wanted to drug them dumber.  I&#39;m overjoyed that they can watch TV if  <br/>
they want to.  I&#39;m relieved that they&#39;re not friends with the kids  <br/>
behind us.  They might&#39;ve been, years ago, but those kids who are  <br/>
yelled at and hit were mean to them, and especially mean to Holly, so  <br/>
my kids just started ignoring and avoiding them.<br/>
