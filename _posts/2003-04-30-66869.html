<div id="ygrps-yiv-100198311">I have never encountered any problem here in FL with nursing anywhere in<br/>
public. No one has ever said anything to more or given me anything but<br/>
approving looks. If there were offended people, I never saw them.<br/>

Ditto from me.  In fact, I have secrectly wished someone would try and make me leave somewhere so I could give them a piece of my mind.<br/>

I was just talking about this very same thing with my friend last week!!!<br/>
She came upon an older woman in the grocery store who asked my friends son<br/>
about school and what followed was not pretty. Needless to say the older<br/>
woman was not pro homeschool and my friend was trying nicely to explain. I<br/>
made the remark that why can&#39;t I ever run into anyone like that!!!!!! With<br/>
my in laws gone, I have no more good fights left!!<br/>
