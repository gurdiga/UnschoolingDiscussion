<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025734989"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;... I realized your comment about &quot;marching their little butts around&quot;<br/>
&gt;was facetious, but I&#39;ve just become more aware in recent years of an<br/>
&gt;unconscious attitude that children are second class citizens.  I make<br/>
&gt;comments like yours myself at times, and then I try to imagine saying<br/>
&gt;the same thing in the same way about a respected adult, or hearing my<br/>
&gt;husband saying it about me.  It&#39;s an eye-opening exercise.<br/>
&gt;Imagine a husband saying to his friends about his wife &quot;I marched her<br/>
&gt;little butt all over creation today and she *had* to keep up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, for one, I have never considered children to be second-class<br/>
citizens; au contraire -- they&#39;re about the only people I understand.<br/>
Second, my wife and I tend to be on the silly side, and I&#39;d be surprised if<br/>
one of us DIDN&#39;T say something like that about the other at one point or<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I fully realize that there are some here who believe a passive session<br/>
&gt;&gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; watching TV is as valuable to a developing mind as an active session<br/>
&gt;&gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; looking for bugs, playing in a sandbox, taking a hike through the<br/>
&gt;&gt; woods and<br/>
&gt;&gt; chasing the local jackrabbits and squirrels, or building forts out of<br/>
&gt;&gt; boxes.  I frankly think the TV is not a good substitute for anything<br/>
&gt;&gt; that<br/>
&gt;&gt; involves activity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is interesting.  I have a few questions if you don&#39;t mind...<br/>
&gt;Do you feel the same way about other non-physically active pastimes-<br/>
&gt;like reading for example?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t consider reading necessarily a passive activity.  It&#39;s a bit<br/>
different than TV, where cascading images with a total duration averaging<br/>
three seconds apiece are spoon-fed to the viewer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In other words, would you say &quot;reading is not<br/>
&gt;a good substitute for anything that involves physical activity&quot;?   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And why is tv automatically a &quot;substitute&quot; for something else in a way<br/>
&gt;that other activities are not?<br/>
&gt;Everything we do is a substitute for something else we could be doing.<br/>
&gt;Hiking in the woods or looking for bugs might be a substitute for<br/>
&gt;painting a picture or baking cookies, but that doesn&#39;t make hiking in<br/>
&gt;the woods wrong.  It&#39;s just the choice for the moment.<br/>
&gt;Also, what about watching tv while simultaneously doing something else?<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ve watched tv while folding laundry, while playing with legos or<br/>
&gt;other building toys, while drawing pictures, while having a conversation<br/>
&gt;about what&#39;s on the tv, etc.  Some people even exercise while they watch<br/>
&gt;tv.  Watching tv doesn&#39;t automatically equal inactivity.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Understood.  We simply have a different view of its value.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wondering the same kinds of things.  And wondering whether Marc isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;heavy on Gardner&#39;s nature intelligence, and lighter on visual and musical, <br/>
&gt;perhaps.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe that&#39;s the impression I&#39;ve given you; if so, I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Because all the bugs in the world you can find and watch life <br/>
&gt;cycles on will not bring you pictures of Nepal, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But traveling to Nepal for a month is even better.  My wife has traveled<br/>
all over the world; I&#39;ve traveled all over the U.S.  This fall, we&#39;re<br/>
taking our son to Australia.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;nor opera, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I was born to a musical family with an opera singer, I don&#39;t have<br/>
much taste for opera.  I do like orchestras and used to play the viola.  In<br/>
any case, seeing either on TV is no substitute for attending a concert or<br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;nor Shakespeare.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I played Romeo and other Shakespearean characters in my youth, and while<br/>
watching someone else acting it out is fun, being one of the characters is<br/>
even more fun.  In doing so, I learned the lines in a way that I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
from even repeated viewings.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yet on TV there are also bugs!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Granted.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, we simply have differing views on the value of video.<br/>

<br/>
What&#39;s the duration of a word or phrase when you&#39;re reading?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;ve read an anti-TV book without really observing kids <br/>
watching TV, or being really analytical about your own viewing of something <br/>
that&#39;s really making you think.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But traveling to Nepal for a month is even better.  My wife has traveled<br/>
all over the world; I&#39;ve traveled all over the U.S.  This fall, we&#39;re<br/>
taking our son to Australia.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When taveling to Nepal isn&#39;t an option, a TV show on Nepal is better than <br/>
skateboarding in the alley (again), as to learning about other places.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; In any case, seeing either on TV is no substitute for attending a concert <br/>
or<br/>
playing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most people in the U.S. live hundreds of miles from any opportunity to see <br/>
live opera, and if you pay bucks to go to an opera and you don&#39;t like it <br/>
you&#39;re stuck.  If you can turn one on for fifteen minutes with option to turn <br/>
it off, it&#39;s a huge luxury people for the past four hundred years would all <br/>
have LOVED to have had.  It&#39;s only been available for the past 40 or so, and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t suck.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I played Romeo and other Shakespearean characters in my youth, and while<br/>
watching someone else acting it out is fun, being one of the characters is<br/>
even more fun.  In doing so, I learned the lines in a way that I wouldn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
Knowing Romeo&#39;s lines is no substitute for having heard some really great <br/>
actors do six or a dozen plays where you can wind back and watch the good <br/>
parts twice.<br/>

reader instead of images being spoon fed to the viewer.  I still don&#39;t<br/>
get why one is passive and the other not.<br/>

Isn&#39;t going to Nepal better than reading about it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But, see, *no one* is saying TV is &quot;instead of&quot;. It&#39;s an *additional* tool<br/>
to access the world. It&#39;s not *instead of* going to Nepal. It&#39;s instead of<br/>
not being able to go to Nepal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Like I said, we simply have differing views on the value of video.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And we should all choose for ourselves. But when unschooling our views<br/>
affect what resources are available to our children. A view that some<br/>
resource is lacking value can impact a child&#39;s access to something that may<br/>
be of great value to them.<br/>
<br/>
If music did nothing for me so that I decided a child was perfectly fine<br/>
without it, a musical child would find the environment limiting. If being in<br/>
nature, or manipulating numbers, or being physical did nothing for me, those<br/>
too would limit a child whose intelligence leaned those directions.<br/>
<br/>
Some children are visual learners. My daughter is one. She gets a great deal<br/>
more in terms of imagination fodder out of cartoons than she does out of<br/>
listening to books or being out in nature. She enjoys both of those, but<br/>
it&#39;s cartoons that have inspired the most creativity in her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If someone has that kind of access. If someone has that desire.<br/>
<br/>
What if they don&#39;t? Shakespeare live is superior to Shakespeare on TV. But<br/>
Shakespeare on TV is superior to reading it. In fact watching Shakespeare,<br/>
especially different productions -- which may be beyond the means and access<br/>
of many people -- will give someone greater insight than even repeated<br/>
readings.<br/>
<br/>
(Assuming someone likes Shakespeare of course. My hsuband would choose none<br/>
of the above ;-)<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most people don&#39;t have that kind of money or time. Are you saying that if<br/>
someone can&#39;t go experience something, then they shouldn&#39;t bother with a<br/>
lesser acess to it?<br/>
<br/>
If I had the choice of going to Nepal or watching it on TV, I&#39;d choose<br/>
going. If I had the choice of denying myself Nepal or watching it on TV, I&#39;d<br/>
choose TV.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I have other choices too: books, music, people. None is a<br/>
substitute for going there but they&#39;re a lot cheaper, easier and more<br/>
accessible to those who can&#39;t go. And I can visit 1000&#39;s of places through<br/>
those, but I doubt that I&#39;ll have the opportunity to actually visit more<br/>
than a handful or so of exotic places.<br/>
