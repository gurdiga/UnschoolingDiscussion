<div id="ygrps-yiv-332558175">Hello everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Stefanie Mohsennia, German and the webmaster of a web site promoting <br/>
respectful parenting and natural learning in my country where <br/>
unfortunately, we have compulsory schooling laws and homeschooling is <br/>
illegal.<br/>
<br/>
I am working on a book about unschooling in German in order to get <br/>
people acquainted with its wonderful possibilities and outcomes and <br/>
maybe get them interested enough to fight for the legalization of <br/>
homeschooling. I have lots of good material already, but I&#39;m still <br/>
collecting real life accounts of the lives of unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you and especially your kids and teens would like to help me <br/>
and answer one or several or all of the following questions:<br/>
<br/>
-  What do you do all day? What are your favorite pastimes?<br/>
- How would you describe yourself as a person? Do you think <br/>
homeschooling had an influence on you becoming the kind of person you <br/>
are today?<br/>
- Do you ever wish you had chosen the school path?<br/>
- What do you like best about homeschooling? What do you consider to be <br/>
its greatest advantages?<br/>
- Do you work (volunteering or paid work)? Do you like it? What have you <br/>
learnt through your work experience?<br/>
- What are your plans or hopes for the future? And how do you work <br/>
towards your goals?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Please give your first name, age and place of residence and tell me if <br/>
you have been homeschooled all your life or if you have spent time in <br/>
school. I would translate interesting answers and contributions and use <br/>
them for my chapter in which children talk about their unschooling lives.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear from you!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Stefanie<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I only have Internet access Monday thru Friday afternoon, so don&#39;t <br/>
be upset if you don&#39;t hear from me immediately.</div>

wondering whether they really want to help.<br/>
