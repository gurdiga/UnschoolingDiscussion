If this looks odd, it&#39;s cos it was 3 separate emails that I decided should<br/>
go together, but I don&#39;t want to spend time editing them now.  Hope no-one<br/>
minds :-)<br/>
<br/>
Bridget, I know what you mean.  I don&#39;t want to get offensive, but I don&#39;t<br/>
mean that formula is &#39;just as good.&#39;  It&#39;s an inferior product, but babies<br/>
can still thrive on it, my own daughter, touch wood, has no physical<br/>
problems with it.  The point is that unless people take breastfeeding down<br/>
from it&#39;s pedestal and say &#39;This is the natural thing to do,&#39; some people<br/>
are going to hold it up as an unapproachable ideal, which I did to an<br/>
extent with the general lifestyle portrayed in the Art of Breastfeeding (GB<br/>
and NZ version from about 10 years ago.)  I was heartbroken when I couldn&#39;t<br/>
continue breastfeeding Heather, partly because I&#39;d held it up so high. <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve been sent the article I was talking about, I&#39;ll attach it.  If<br/>
the group doesn&#39;t accept attachments, I can send it privately to anyone who<br/>
wants it, or if the consensus of the list agrees, I can cut-and-paste it to<br/>
the list.  It explains what I mean much better than I can :-)<br/>

Stephanie, you both deserve a big round of applause for being open to<br/>
discussion, with your past experiences, and your dh&#39;s reservations about<br/>
the benefits.  I know you wanted the discussion closed, but I would like to<br/>
add a few more thoughts.  You don&#39;t have to read them if you don&#39;t want :-)<br/>
 <br/>
I am glad that you have reached a decision that works for you both.  And<br/>
while I understand the desire for the husband to bond with the child, I<br/>
think I have to point out that there are so many ways that we bond with our<br/>
babies, feeding is only one of them.  There are many breastfeeding fathers<br/>
who feel well-connected to their children, and their partners no doubt feel<br/>
indebted for their commitment to their families&#39; well-being.  Yes,<br/>
expressing milk is the next best thing to breastfeeding, with, according to<br/>
the WHO other mothers&#39; expressed milk next and formula fourth and last on<br/>
the priority list.  I would add other mother breastfeeding (in cases where<br/>
maternal breastfeeding is not possible, rather than not desired) &#39;wet<br/>
nursing,&#39; below maternal breastfeeding in this list, because there is much<br/>
more to breastfeeding than nutritional content.  This is what was so<br/>
upsetting for me. I knew that while some babies have allergic reactions to<br/>
formula, some babies suffer medical problems later in life due to<br/>
bottlefeeding, I have not suffered any visible effects (yet) from being<br/>
bottlefed.  I wanted my children to experience the whole experience of<br/>
breastfeeding, the skin contact, the physical developmental differences... <br/>
I wanted to experience breastfeeding, the hormonal rush, the skin contact. <br/>
It was particularly important for me since Heather had spent time in SCBU<br/>
that I become the only person who could provide this for my daughter. <br/>
Other people can do anything else for a baby, and in some societies, even<br/>
breastfeeding is widely shared.  But it is a very special thing for a<br/>
mother to share with her baby, and I am glad that I experienced it, and<br/>
still do, with my second child.  Now, if only I could persuade her to<br/>
stop.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening here, and I hope your dialogue continues, since I<br/>
think that parenting issues are never really closed.<br/>
<br/>
Tracy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I have to admire your commitment to expressing, I found it to be very<br/>
difficult and did not produce enough to feed my daughter fully after a few<br/>
weeks, even though I had provided for her completely while she was on the<br/>
SCBU.<br/>

Wendy, you&#39;re right, that&#39;s why I made the point that I don&#39;t speak for LLL<br/>
earlier :-)<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;d be interested to know what exactly you think gave LLL a bad name,<br/>
either on or off list.<br/>
