  My daughter (11) and I just read these books by Lois Lowry.  There are <br/>
  actually three books in the series, The Giver, Gathering Blue and the new <br/>
  one called Messenger.  We both found them interesting and very thought <br/>
  provoking.  I was very curious about a lot of things from the first two <br/>
  that are cleared up in the Messenger as it brings the two together.  I <br/>
  don&#39;t want to give it away, but Messenger would also be a bit disturbing <br/>
  for those who found the first two like that.  We actually saw Lois Lowry at <br/>
  a book store signing event where she gave a talk and unfortunately I was <br/>
  busy with my younger child, but my daughter did hear her talk.  I had <br/>
  questions I wanted to ask, but didn&#39;t have the chance.  I always wondered <br/>
  what happened to the baby (Gabriel) from the first book.  There was no <br/>
  indication of what happened to him in the third (but Jonas does live).  My <br/>
  daughter found the books to be sad but not so disturbing.  However, she&#39;s <br/>
  never been too bothered by really tough things in stories.  For instance, <br/>
  when I was reading aloud HP and Goblet of Fire I was horrified to read the <br/>
  part about Wormtail cutting off his hand, but it didn&#39;t bother her at all <br/>
  and that was several years ago.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, I would still highly recommend Lowry&#39;s books.  The one that is my <br/>
  daughter&#39;s favorite and the one she chose to have signed by Lois Lowry is <br/>
  Number the Stars which is about the Holocaust.  I haven&#39;t read it, but it&#39;s <br/>
  on my reading list now!<br/>

  Their is a companion to the giver, called Gathering Blue.  Both are very<br/>
  disturbing novels.  Maybe I just take them too seriously, but I was very<br/>
  disturbed by them, and yet I have read both books more than once, and<br/>
  would like to teach the giver to my students (6th grade).  I also don&#39;t<br/>
  want Lexie to read it, yet.<br/>
