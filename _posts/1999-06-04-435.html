Last week while getting ready to race the one car, I pointed out that the whole concept of racing and building a faster car was math.  Ratios, speed, how much gas goes through the carb and etc. was all math.  Then I pointed out that since he wants his kids to be as involved with the cars as he is and taught them everything he know, he was.........UNSCHOOLING!!!!!!!<br/>

You know what???  I have a much more receptive husband.<br/>

I hope that you can find something like this for you, it just makes the homefront a littler easier!!!<br/>

Thanks, Julie, for the good ideas! My husband has cars he wants to rebuild <br/>
and that I want him to sell, LOL. (One has the engine out of it and in boxes <br/>
ALL OVER my basement, the other takes up half our carport. Neither one has <br/>
been worked on in years) Now should I try to get him to keep the cars so that <br/>
he can unschool through rebuilding? Or should I try to get him to sell the <br/>
cars so I can unschool through economics? I&#39;m still thinking economics here. <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks, and I&#39;ll have to ponder some more acceptable ways to get my <br/>
husband involved, LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081665629">Dear Julie -<br/>
<br/>
Good story, and good point.  Actually, what you illustrate through your<br/>
story is that the difference between &quot;unschooling&quot; and other approaches<br/>
to homeschooling are often not as different as some would make it seem.<br/>
All &quot;unschoolers&quot; allow their children to be influenced in what they<br/>
become interested in either by themselves, siblings, other adults, or<br/>
things which come their way.  It is possible to use workbooks and be<br/>
consistent with &quot;unschooling&quot; approaches if the child acknowledges,<br/>
understands, and contracts to use them if s/he appreciates (and desires)<br/>
the value to be obtained at the other end.<br/>
<br/>
Example -- &quot;Jim, you want to be able to set the torque on the engine<br/>
with me?&quot; &quot;Yeah, Dad, that would be great!&quot;  &quot;Okay, but I have to tell<br/>
you that in order to be able to do that you&#39;ll have to understand and be<br/>
able to compute torque ratios.  That&#39;s what I have to do.&quot;  &quot;Oh? How do<br/>
I learn to do that?&quot;  &quot;Well, I could show you how to do the math and<br/>
give you some problems to practice.  Might take a couple of weeks.  Are<br/>
you up for it?&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m not sure, Dad.&quot;  &quot;Well, you think about it, and<br/>
remember, all you have to do is ask and I&#39;ll be here to help.  Okay?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The difference is not whether one sits at a desk, runs the lemonade<br/>
stand, uses the pocket calculator, or just hangs around with Dad (or the<br/>
next door neighbor).  The difference in &quot;unschooling&quot; lies in allowing<br/>
the child to understand the positive consequences of learning and<br/>
allowing her to contract for it when she, and she alone, is ready.<br/>
Facilitating lots of exposure, and giving the kids the benefit of your<br/>
experience and judgment in helping them understand how they can fulfill<br/>
their knowledge quests  (knowing there may be many different ways to do<br/>
so), is what my concept of &quot;unschooling&quot; would be.  So if the<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; word is block to mutual understanding, get rid of it (as<br/>
you found you finally didn&#39;t need to, but it might have helped along the<br/>
way.)<br/>

<br/>
You go out to the garage and start using the Torque Wrench.  Child asks what <br/>
is torque?  You explain.  Child asks &quot;how do you know how to do it?&quot;  You <br/>
explain.  Maybe even give an easier example of the ratio situation.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t ALWAYS require sitting down to problems.  Sometimes it is a matter of <br/>
talking it through as you are doing it.<br/>
