One quote struck me in the article:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;O&#39;Connell has said that students who fail the exam can take another <br/>
year of high school, get extra tutoring, enroll in summer school or <br/>
attend community college until they pass.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmm so if they can take community college classes for a while, why <br/>
would they need a high school diploma? A year or two at community <br/>
college and they would (a) be above the compulsory attendance age (b) <br/>
be able to simply transfer to a 4 yr college or university (should <br/>
they choose to) with not somuch concern about the diploma - unless, I <br/>
suppose, they want to go to a state-run college/university which tends <br/>
to be run by the same people as the high school system.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is wrong. He&#39;s - confused, I suppose. Or ignorant. Sad,  <br/>
considering he&#39;s responsible for both the k12 and community college  <br/>
system here in California.  Public high school students can only take  <br/>
classes at the community college with permission of their principal/ <br/>
counselor who must verify that the student can benefit from &quot;college  <br/>
level work.&quot; Most community college do allow some advanced high  <br/>
school students to take classes, but they are limited to part-time  <br/>
enrollment and to certain courses. The college where I teach doesn&#39;t  <br/>
not allow high school students to take ANY course which is considered  <br/>
remedial or one that is offered at a high school in the student&#39;s  <br/>
district.<br/>
<br/>
Community colleges are going to be thrilled that O&#39;Connell thinks  <br/>
they should be sort of a dumping ground for the thousands of kids who  <br/>
fail the exit exam. Not.<br/>

school diploma is critical to life success.<br/>

as a freshman, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to go to college full time before turning 18,  <br/>
homeschoolers do it, but these are the kids who could NOT pass the  <br/>
high school exit exam and are not going to be the ones who qualify  <br/>
for full-time college enrollment at 16 or 17 years old. Lots are not  <br/>
going to be interested in college, even.<br/>
<br/>
We homeschoolers know a lot about what they could do, as  <br/>
alternatives, but their parents would have to be on the same page.  <br/>
For example, they can start their own private school or they can  <br/>
enroll in a private independent study program. Some of us with  <br/>
private schools would be willing to graduate them almost immediately.  <br/>
But - the parents don&#39;t know there are alternatives and when they  <br/>
hear about them they are often suspicious that we&#39;re wrong - declare  <br/>
yourself to be a private school and give the kid a diploma? Sounds  <br/>
too easy to be true.<br/>
