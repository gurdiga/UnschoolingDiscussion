In many places it is literally not safe physically for youngsters to go to<br/>
school. And in many schools - and it&#39;s becoming almost generally true - it<br/>
is spiritually unsafe to attend public schools. Look back over the history<br/>
of education to the turn of the century and the beginning of the educational<br/>
philosophies...which have led us now into a circumstance where our schools<br/>
are producing the problems that we face.<br/>
