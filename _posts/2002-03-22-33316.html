<div id="ygrps-yiv-248342007">Hi Katy- I am new where as well. Joined 2 days ago<br/>
because I like the theory of unschooling, agree with<br/>
the philosophy, but not yet confident enough I guess<br/>
to apply it. I wanted to learn more from the<br/>
&quot;experts&quot;. Especially concerning the paperwork aspect.<br/>
I haven&#39;t quite dared to jump in to ask questions or<br/>
introduce myself though. I agree, from what I have<br/>
read in past day and a half, it does sound like a<br/>
&quot;closed&quot; list, not at all open to newcomers.<br/>
Rethinking my magazine subscribtion as well. Maybe I<br/>
will check into one of the other lists we were<br/>
rerouted to on here. There were a few here who<br/>
actually did discuss unschooling, but for the most<br/>
part it seems the center of  discussion is about<br/>
exclusion. Maybe we will be more welcome somewhere<br/>
else, as was suggested here earlier. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643373783">It&#39;s funny but it seems to be that 90% of e-lists are run in a<br/>
tyrannical style.<br/>
<br/>
Never understood why but it does seem the case<br/>
<br/>
There are exceptions of course<br/>
<br/>
The advantages of not having one person imposing a &#39;my way or the<br/>
highway&#39; rule is you actually get 50% plus of the list members actively<br/>
posting rather than the less the 20% you get on most lists, the 10% why<br/>
adorate the list owner and the 10% who are not intimidated and have time<br/>
to waste on fighting<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158235428">Dear friends and listmembers,<br/>
<br/>
I wish there was a quick, easy and convenient way to let you all know <br/>
what I&#39;m thinking and feeling this morning. Unfortunately, this email <br/>
mode of communication doesn&#39;t really do much more than give us a way <br/>
to exchange writings. For me, that becomes even more limiting because <br/>
I&#39;ve had trouble with carpal tunnel syndrome for the last few years <br/>
and so I try to limit the time I spend on keyboards these days. What <br/>
I might have at one time spent many paragraphs trying to explain will <br/>
now need to be presented much more concisely than I&#39;d normally <br/>
prefer. Also, because we&#39;re in deadline for our May/June issue of <br/>
HEM, I need to spend more time on non-list related projects, so I <br/>
*really* can&#39;t write as much as I&#39;d like to on this whole topic. And <br/>
if that&#39;s not enough, our oldest son and his family are here visiting <br/>
from Alaska for only a few days, and I&#39;d much rather be spending time <br/>
with them than sorting out the mess on this list. Anyway, all of that <br/>
to say this:<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a major disappointment to see this list fall back into the same <br/>
kind of downward spiral we experienced a few weeks (or was it <br/>
months?) ago. I needed to be gone unexpectedly for a couple of days, <br/>
so I stayed up last night long after everyone here had gone to bed, <br/>
reading and trying to make sense of what was going on with this list. <br/>
I finally fell asleep, got back up early this morning and started <br/>
reading again, missed breakfast with the family in trying to sort <br/>
this out... and have finally caught up with the posts. Now I sit here <br/>
wondering why I spent all that time reading and trying to make some <br/>
sense of all the accusations, defenses, proclamations, and so on and <br/>
so forth. It was truly discouraging to see the disparaging remarks <br/>
about our magazine in the middle of this discussion - even a threat <br/>
to reconsider an HEM subscription - because as far as I&#39;m concerned <br/>
this list has absolutely nothing to do with the publication we <br/>
produce for homeschoolers. To see our magazine called into question <br/>
because of what someone who happens to write for us does on this list <br/>
was probably the final straw for me.<br/>
<br/>
We - the publishers of Home Education Magazine - &quot;sponsor&quot; this list, <br/>
and many others, because we feel it&#39;s important for homeschoolers to <br/>
discuss issues with each other, to offer support and encouragement, <br/>
to have places for communication and networking. I think once upon a <br/>
time that might have been a valid approach, but, unfortunately, after <br/>
what I&#39;ve read here, I think lists like this one are more of a <br/>
liability to our publication than an asset.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be blunt. I do not have the time nor the interest in being <br/>
involved with the kinds of dynamics I&#39;ve read here in the last few <br/>
hours. I&#39;m not even interested in longwinded discussions any more. I <br/>
just need to do my job as Managing Editor of HEM, and this list has <br/>
become a major impediment to that. For that reason, I am removing all <br/>
references to HEM from this list, turning this list over to the <br/>
moderators, unsubscribing, and getting on with what needs doing in my <br/>
life. I wish you all the best in finding appropriate resolutions.<br/>

stunned; I&#39;m sad.  I was on-line when Helen wrote this and I&#39;ve<br/>
been thinking a lot about what this means.  Mary is off-line with<br/>
family activities for another day or so.  We will definitely be<br/>
talking a lot when she is back!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189693454">Hi all,  Jacli here :)<br/>
I&#39;ve been relatively quiet for quite a while.  Going<br/>
through too<br/>
much physical turmoil to get embroiled on the stuff on the<br/>
list too.<br/>
But Helen&#39;s message struck me.  I didn&#39;t appreciate her<br/>
method<br/>
but I understood her madness. <br/>
<br/>
The plain fact is that we seem to have cycles on this list.<br/>
The good, the bad and oh yes, the ugly.<br/>
<br/>
We have moments when we shine.  When we all come together<br/>
to help one another question and answer our collective<br/>
approaches<br/>
to schooling, unschooling and parenting in general.  These<br/>
are the<br/>
moments when we -each of us- contribute just a little<br/>
something, a<br/>
little bit of our own flavor and when taken in create a<br/>
masterpiece.<br/>
<br/>
Then we have moments when we get a little thoughtless or<br/>
insensitive.<br/>
Perhaps too sensitive is what I should say.  Moments when<br/>
for just<br/>
a New York minute we let the bad in and become JUDGEMENTAL.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay.  This list is full of moms, dads, teachers,<br/>
leaders<br/>
and since we&#39;re all human on this list, the occasional<br/>
screw-ups.<br/>
But we acknowledge, apologize and move on.  And thank<br/>
goodness<br/>
for the occasional screw up.  They remind us to think<br/>
before we speak,<br/>
to consider and reconsider the way we treat or mistreat<br/>
others, such <br/>
consideration is probably a big asset for a group of folks<br/>
attempting to guide<br/>
their young-ins and deschool themselves at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is when the Ugly sneaks it&#39;s ugly face in.<br/>
Ahh, the moments<br/>
when we tear down instead of buildup.  Then we go back in<br/>
and do it again.<br/>
The long, long debates on whether so and so said what they<br/>
said they said and so <br/>
forth.  Usually followed by people upset about all the<br/>
people saying what was or<br/>
was not said and then the comments about how people should<br/>
go and say things<br/>
somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
This is not new for us.  But it is shameful.  Because when<br/>
we are good, we are <br/>
AWESOME!  When we shine it is because, as a group we<br/>
encourage, support <br/>
and unite.<br/>
<br/>
I do not care for the way Helen responded to the UGLY.  But<br/>
I do think it came <br/>
from an emotional place of frustration and disappointment<br/>
that it had come back <br/>
again.  And let&#39;s face it, when folks start telling other<br/>
folks to get on other lists,<br/>
UGLY has come back in a big way.<br/>
<br/>
Shame on us.  Do you know what I do when the ugly comes?<br/>
When the first<br/>
whiff of ugly has come I try to ignore it by becoming real<br/>
friendly with my delete<br/>
button.  But at times like this, times when UGLY has come<br/>
back all the way<br/>
and brought friends, I leave.  That&#39;s right.  I&#39;ve been off<br/>
this list several times and I&#39;m<br/>
about to do it again.  And that&#39;s okay too.  Because the<br/>
true feeling of this list is<br/>
strong enough to survive even the ugly and the<br/>
disappearance of one or two faces.<br/>
Ugly is like a fire and if we all just stop feeding the<br/>
flames IT WILL GO AWAY.<br/>
<br/>
Sooner or later The Good will come back and when it does I<br/>
and the others who have<br/>
already quietly slipped away for a bit will come back.  I<br/>
just hope in the meantime that<br/>
we haven&#39;t already permanently alienated some of the<br/>
wonderful people on this list who <br/>
maybe don&#39;t understand our ups and downs.  The list will<br/>
survive, but it could come back <br/>
and bloom and thrive if only we would all work just a<br/>
little harder to stop feeding the ugly <br/>
and start working The Good.<br/>
<br/>
Well, just my two cents, bye all, Jacli :)<br/>
