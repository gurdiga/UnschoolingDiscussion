<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008902002">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
I have a few questions regarding introducing letters and learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
When you read ABC books like the one of Dr Seuss, do you read it as phonics or not??<br/>
<br/>
Did you use phonics to introduce letters to your child. Is anyone using Jolly Phonics.<br/>
<br/>
And the last question is re bilingual children. Which language did your child learn to read first?? My son&#39;s strongest language is Afrikaans, but now that we are living in New Zealand he probably hears more English than Afrikaans??<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079853086"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have a few questions regarding introducing letters and learning <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to read.<br/>
     *My kids just seem to pick things up.  I don&#39;t know where 4yods <br/>
learned that S-A-D spells sad (he told me this yesterday), or how 1 <br/>
1/2yodd learned her letters - the ones she knows - but somehow they <br/>
just picked it up.  We read a lot, and we have a lot of words around <br/>
our house.  Our clothes have words on them, food packages have words <br/>
on them, books, of course, and even toys often have words on them.  <br/>
Sometimes they ask what things say.  Yes, we read Dr. Seuss <br/>
sometimes - ds likes Green Eggs and Ham.  He noticed that certain <br/>
columns of words were the same.  Had I pointed it out, he probably <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have cared, but since he was the one who noticed, he did <br/>
learn.  A friend loaned me a book - Teach Your Child to Read in 100 <br/>
Easy Lessons.  I really wasn&#39;t interested, but I leafed through it, <br/>
and could hardly believe how arrogant the authors encourage the <br/>
parent/teacher to be.  But I don&#39;t think other teaching materials are <br/>
much better.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; And the last question is re bilingual children. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>     *I find that my children are learning both at the same time.  We <br/>
do our best to keep as much Japanese materials around the house as <br/>
English, and we speak mostly Japanese at home.  They get English from <br/>
everybody else.  My MIL sent us some Japanese worksheets that my son <br/>
actually enjoys &lt;gag&gt;, but maybe that&#39;s because he decides when/if <br/>
and how long he spends on them.  We also have frequent contact with <br/>
family in Japan - we&#39;ll be visiting them this summer, and that <br/>
helps.  As long as they see and use both languages as LIVING <br/>
languages (and not just dry rules that nobody in their world really <br/>
uses), they&#39;ll just pick it up, as they will anything else.  DS also <br/>
has a Spanish CD-ROM that he likes to play with, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand or speak the language.  To him, it&#39;s not real.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
know anybody who actually speaks or uses Spanish.  To him, it&#39;s just <br/>
a game.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

All of the above.<br/>

Separating the sounds from reading the words and vice versa never made any <br/>
sense to me.  I read, she reads, she asks, I sound out with her or tell her <br/>
what the word is, we continue.  She stops reading with approximately one <br/>
million questions about the story.  We continue reading.<br/>

use the phonetic sound, I use the letter name.  I&#39;m firmly convinced that it<br/>
matters not which one you do first or second. All that really matters is<br/>
that you give your child information and he uses it to make sense of the<br/>

I have one son that will tell you, in a heartbeat, phonics is a waste of<br/>
time when learning to read.  He became a fluent reader and THEN was willing<br/>
to dissect words.<br/>

So, I vote for telling the kids both names and sounds, along with reading<br/>
lots of fun stuff like Suess. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616116027">Hmmm.... good question!!! I was taught to read by my mom - I would have to sit and read books (not the easy readers either) aloud to her, and she would stop me whenever I would mispronounce a word. I&#39;d have to guess and guess and guess some more until I hit upon the right way to say it so I could continue on. Somehow, I grew up loving to read anyway.<br/>

school. My son learned to read with almost no input from me (except for <br/>
answering questions like &quot;What does this word say?) at about 3.5. <br/>

&lt;&lt; One of<br/>
  the few things I didn&#39;t see was any discussion of how folks<br/>
  themselves had learned to read.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t read when I went to first grade, but I could write my name in <br/>
cursive, and spell some other words.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Fort Worth Texas, W.M. Green Elementary (still exists, but I went <br/>
there the year it and its big neighborhood bomb shelter were brand new) and <br/>
we were using Look-Say, learning words by sight and shape and repetition.<br/>
<br/>
I learned to read quickly and well and they gave me a library card even <br/>
though the regular drill was you had to be a third grader to get a library <br/>
card.  I remember the first day they took me into the school&#39;s little <br/>
library,  just me and the librarian and my teacher, Miss Tomlinson.  I got a <br/>
book on satellites, and it talked about Galileo and the moon and telescopes.<br/>
<br/>
We moved to New Mexico, and I went to second grade in a totally <br/>
phonics-focussed school.  Since I could already read, the phonics drills were <br/>
just puzzles for me.  I&#39;d fill them out, argue with the teacher about the <br/>
pictures (monkey or chimpanzee or ape?  cup or mug?  I remember insisting to <br/>
Miss Bency that if they wanted &quot;cup&quot; they should&#39;ve angled the sides in, <br/>
because with straight sides it was a mug).  <br/>
<br/>
Probably between the two &quot;methods&quot; I was made the strongest, longest-range, <br/>
highest-jumping reader of any of my friends.  <br/>
<br/>
But I think it was the lack of books at my house and the plethora of books at <br/>
school that made the difference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355692703">I remember very clearly 2 parts and have lately gotten<br/>
irrefutable proof of the third piece.  At the risk of lingering<br/>
too long on a topic, I will share how it happened for me, which<br/>
may help somebody understand what is going on with their own kid.<br/>
The Christmas I was 2 1/2, I had a new sister and very little<br/>
pleasure in that fact.  My maternal grandparents came to stay for<br/>
an extra long holiday visit to help over the bump of<br/>
sibling-ness.<br/>
<br/>
My grandfather was academic dean of a university, but had started<br/>
there when it was a normal school (teacher&#39;s college).  As a<br/>
result he had a ton of very cool &quot;Stuff&quot; in his head and on his<br/>
shelves.  He brought with him several sheets of perforated cards<br/>
with pictures, printed in red ink, woodcut style, of all the<br/>
kings and queens of England, with just their names under the<br/>
pictures.  He taught me all the rules of phonics that Christmas.<br/>
I remember after that being able to sound out most anything I<br/>
wanted to, but also that it was HARD - and frequently not worth<br/>
the trouble.  I used the skill as needed, to look stuff up and to<br/>
select things that had no pictures - in a mill town, a lot of<br/>
stuff was labeled with petty generic tags at the store.<br/>
<br/>
I also remember the Summer I was 7, the absolute smothering sense<br/>
of panic that I felt when I realized I could no longer look at a<br/>
word without automatically reading it.  The closest I have ever<br/>
seen to a similar feeling being described is in people with<br/>
psychosis who suddenly have voices in their head.<br/>
<br/>
The third piece that I have recently picked up is a letter my<br/>
maternal grandmother wrote to her sister at Christmas when I was<br/>
5 1/2, commenting that I would be reading independently very<br/>
soon.  She apparently was right, because when I entered first<br/>
grade I read all the way through the first reader Alice and Jerry<br/>
reader that morning (and got into trouble for showing off and<br/>
skipping ahead - I had a rocky academic life).<br/>
<br/>
But among my most treasured books from my childhood are some of<br/>
the &quot;early readers&quot; that my grandfather had collected from<br/>
textbook companies over 50 years.  The pictures are still<br/>
beautiful to me - and the memory of the joy of reading<br/>
independently rises up from those pages whenever I open them.  I<br/>
wish I still had the cards, too.  I have no idea why or how he<br/>
knew that that particular sequence of nouns would pick up all the<br/>
rules of phonics, but it doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to know<br/>
that little girls love kings and queens, especially when shared<br/>
exclusively with a big lapped grandfather.<br/>
<br/>
I could defend any of those steps as being the time I learned to<br/>
read - in a way each one was.  But mainly when I talk about when<br/>
one of ours has started reading (or how), I recall my own<br/>
multiyear sequence.</div>
