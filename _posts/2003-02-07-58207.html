Here&#39;s Steiner on education,<br/>
  <br/>
&quot;Today we study the true essence of human thought so we can train the child in the right kind of thinking&quot;     <br/>
Rudolf Steiner<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s his theory of evolution,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You see, when we really study science and history, we must conclude that if people become increasingly strong, they will also become increasingly stupid. If the blonds and blue-eyed people die out, the human race will become increasingly dense if men do not arrive at a form of intelligence that is independent of blondness. Blond hair actually bestows intelligence. It is indeed true that the more the fair individuals die out the more will the instinctive wisdom of humans vanish.&quot; <br/>
Rudolf Steiner<br/>

I couldn&#39;t resist the opportunity to share some of my research! <br/>
It didn&#39;t take me 10 minutes to find this information. It sure makes you wonder.  <br/>

Leslie, who has a collection of 8 televisions accumulated over some 30 years and all still working. This reminds me of a cute scene the other day at Best Buy. My 8 year old joined a few people gathered around a $25,000 plasma TV and commented innocently, &quot;Now that&#39;s a good picture! It looks like you could reach in and pick those people right out of there!&quot; She couldn&#39;t understand why she got such a big laugh.   <br/>

Yikes!  When I read that tedious student essay against unschooling a day<br/>
or two ago, I thought it would be a long time before I read anything<br/>
more stupid or flimsily reasoned, but --noooooooo.  This is actually worse.<br/>
