<div id="ygrps-yiv-289838052">&lt;&lt;I found a hole in the perimeter fence and crawled out.  &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL... is it still open?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I live on Vancouver Island near Victoria.  As to how I got *in* to Canada,<br/>
the immigration laws that we&#39;re criticized for by the US for making too lax<br/>
now, were a *lot* looser then.  &lt;G&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lax?  You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.  I&#39;ve done some serious research and all<br/>
I&#39;ve managed to figure out is that I could easily get into the US, were I<br/>
elsewhere, but nobody else is letting anyone in with any ease.  And Canada&#39;s<br/>
laws have been criticized by the US?  Someone has flipped his noodle. No way<br/>
I could just roll into Canada that I&#39;ve discovered yet.  *sigh*  But<br/>
anyway...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now your email makes me think you&#39;re a musician or guitar maker or<br/>
something<br/>
like that.  Can I ask about that?<br/>
Tia&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just plink a few chords now and again - and know a bit about collectible<br/>
instruments.  My husband is a luthier (and a fine guitar player as well I<br/>
might add) - he can fix or restore anything with strings on it made of wood.<br/>
Had we the right equipment (which we don&#39;t right now) he could build &#39;em<br/>
from scratch.  One day he hopes to go back to it full time.  For now he&#39;s<br/>
working as an electrician and doing the guitar thing on the side.  He had a<br/>
vintage shop in Richmond, VA for several years which he gave up to come out<br/>
to CA - I asked him what the H*ll he was thinking - but then he wasn&#39;t<br/>
married to me at the time. Or to anyone for that matter... so I&#39;m sure<br/>
everyone is wondering why the heck I&#39;m talking about all this on the list?<br/>
Sorry...  I&#39;ll try not to do that...<br/>

No, it&#39;s interesting!<br/>
We get bored and lonely on this list because we don&#39;t let people come and <br/>
tell us unschoolers are lazy retards who are ruining their kids.  We&#39;re the <br/>
choir people can preach to if they want to say unschooling is great.<br/>
<br/>
So you can amuse us with stories of your real life anytime.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I worry about the young men down there if the US brings back the draft.  It<br/>
won&#39;t be very easy for them to come up here like so many did during the<br/>
Vietnam war.  Then again, my brother in law had trouble getting permission<br/>
to live down there.  My sister got her Canadian citizenship 5 years after I<br/>
did and was able to keep her US citizenship, unlike me.  When they came back<br/>
from living in Greece for 5 years, they were going to live down there and<br/>
look after our mother.  He bought a car down there and stupidly registered<br/>
it in his name.  They came up here to pick up some stuff from their storage<br/>
and got married to allow her to sponsor him.  When they tried to go back,<br/>
the US wouldn&#39;t let him in, because it was obvious he had already been<br/>
living there.  They made him get a place up here for a certain period of<br/>
time and prove it.  My sister stayed down there to wait for him.  Then he<br/>
got a custodial job here that needed a couple, and she came up here to do<br/>
that.  I don&#39;t know how it would have turned out if she&#39;d stayed, gotten a<br/>
job, and tried to sponsor him.  Neither of them has the kind of<br/>
qualifications that countries are looking for in immigrants these days.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s cool.  I know a homeschooling family here in Victoria where the<br/>
husband is a luthier.  But like your dh, he&#39;s doing something else for a<br/>
living.  I guess there isn&#39;t a huge need for luthiers?<br/>

Free choice. If my boys won&#39;t be given free choice,  the Government will <br/>
leave ME no choice. I&#39;ll have to move. <br/>
