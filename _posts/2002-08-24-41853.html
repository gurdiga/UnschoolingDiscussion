Hi Kari,<br/>
<br/>
The board of directors of HSC attended the state SARB hearing on Thursday, the<br/>
day before the conference. It was very interesting and calmed a lot of fears.<br/>
The attorney for the state CDE, Roger Wolferz, stated that the CDE could not<br/>
withhold the private school affidavit from any individual, and that the<br/>
completed private school affidavits could not be used as a &quot;fishing <br/>
expedition&quot;<br/>
to find potential truancies. I spoke to the board and responded to Roger<br/>
Wolferz&#39;s questions regarding the statutory definition of private schools and<br/>
the lack of any statutory authority for the position that private schools need<br/>
to be businesses, among other things. Jim Davis from Family Protection<br/>
Ministries (affiliated with HSLDA and CHEA) and Annette Hall from CHN also<br/>
spoke. <br/>
<br/>
The conclusion is that the private school affidavits will be available on-line<br/>
and through Theresa Cantrell at the CDE later this fall (presumably before<br/>
October 1st), and small private schools will be able to access and file them.<br/>
They will not be used to track down and prosecute homeschoolers for truancy,<br/>
and the letters received from counties in the last month regarding the new<br/>
procedures are nothing more than scare tactics designed to get more<br/>
homeschoolers into the public school homeschooling programs.<br/>
