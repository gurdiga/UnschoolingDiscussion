<br/>
Sorry, Taunya, This is an unschooling list.<br/>
Why is she in eight grade?<br/>
Why is she still struggling in public school?<br/>
Why is she taking algebra?<br/>
Why is she needing a tutor?<br/>
Why would you think *we* would know of anyone that could help?<br/>
<br/>
How about Sylvan Learning Center?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592012892">I agree with what you are saying.  I feel exactly the same.  I lost <br/>
so many nights sleep as a teen struggling with algebra and <br/>
trigonometry.  I was a nervous wreck. I never used any of it in real <br/>
life.  The part that I still remember I cannot explain.  I just do <br/>
the problem and ask, &quot;See how I did that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter wants to be in public school.  She likes being involved <br/>
with the other students and being on the band and chorus. I respect <br/>
her right to persue her future in her own way.  I admire that the <br/>
she has the option to not take it anymore and be homeschooled but <br/>
she will not give up!<br/>

I have a college diploma, even though I got 2 Ds in classes where I didn&#39;t comprehend the subject matter.  Apparently, a D was good enough to get credit for passing the classes.

grade is really important.  AND I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s true that they will fail <br/>
her a whole grade for one math credit.   They might have told you that, but I <br/>
