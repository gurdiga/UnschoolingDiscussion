<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841781274">I have a garden space that I want to either rent out or do a you can  use this and instead of money share some of the produce. I want someone  who will use organic and not chemicals on the stuff. And who wouldn&#39;t  mind unschoolers asking questions and learning. I am not up to renting  a plow and planting myself.<br/>
  <br/>
  Have you ever done it? If yes what was good about it or bad about it?  How did you work out times for them to come ? How did you set  boundaries? <br/>
  and anything else you can think of that I haven&#39;t yet..<br/>
