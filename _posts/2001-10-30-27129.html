<br/>
Okay!  Then discuss unschooling, Cherry.  Your post discussed the issue of <br/>
patriotism too.  And if &quot;patriotism&quot; means blindly following without wanting <br/>
to know background or facts, why would unschoolers be in the forefront?  If <br/>
we were great at blindly following and trusting the government, our kids <br/>
would be in schools, wouldn&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
So it IS philosophically related to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps some people&#39;s homeschooling curriculum company sent them a special <br/>
unit telling them what to teach about a U.S. attack on Afghanistan and how to <br/>
view all the surrounding rhetoric, and telling the parents (for a fee) what <br/>
their children could best use knowing.<br/>
<br/>
Here we are, though, unschoolers--trying to make sense of the world with the <br/>
world itself as evidence.  We are, in this discussion, learning from each <br/>
other&#39;s contributions of evidence, theories and opinions.<br/>
<br/>
We could try to stop doing that to discuss how children learn if you want.  <br/>
But you have as much responsibility as anyone else here to steer the <br/>
conversation, so...<br/>
<br/>
Post about whatever topic would seem more like unschooling to you and I have <br/>
no doubt you&#39;ll get feedback.<br/>

<br/>

(mostly) free country, but we shouldn&#39;t exercise that choice?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having the most weapons doesn&#39;t make you the best.  Most powerful, maybe, <br/>
but not the best.  And nobody has answered my question about why one <br/>
country *needs* to be considered the best.  Can&#39;t we all, all over the <br/>
world, just live the way we think is best without having to be better than <br/>
someone else?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Could we please cut this thread and get back to the reason we all here and<br/>
&gt;the one subject we can mostly all agree on, Unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what do you think we should talk about?  Curriculums?  Spelling the word <br/>
patriotism?  What freedom of speech and thought *really* means?<br/>
<br/>
One of the things wrong with the public schools is that they don&#39;t teach <br/>
kids to think critically.  That&#39;s quite evident here and elsewhere, as <br/>
people try to shut up the dissenters and pretend that the US is a cohesive <br/>
mass of flag-waving patriots.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128086715">Unschooling is a life style, thus unschooling is life, thus anything in life<br/>
is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Without discussing AND acknowledging the deficits of our country, by turning<br/>
a blind eye or jumping up and down in blind patriotism only allows the<br/>
government to continue to abuse its citizens and citizens of the world.<br/>
<br/>
AND, btw, we aren&#39;t a super power because other countries acknowledge we are<br/>
the best country.  We are a super power because in the past we had the most<br/>
money and guns, etc.<br/>
