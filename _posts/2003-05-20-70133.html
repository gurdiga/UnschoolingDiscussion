<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>20 May 2003, at  2:05pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322585362">Does anyone else just LOVE their music?  My kids introduced me to Good Charlotte, Green Day and now Evanescence (not sure if I spelled it right).  And they *thought* the introduced me to Ozzy...LOL.  Of course I had to tell them that Ozzy&#39;s &quot;been around&quot; for a long long time!<br/>
<br/>
I bought the E. CD today and their lyrics are just incredible!!!<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have not heard Evanescence. I am however hooked on Ozzy, and my 7 yr old ds <br/>
thinks he is the coolest also. I also love Pink, Linkin Park, Sum 41, Swollen <br/>
Members, Gob, the list goes on and on.I am enjoying experiencing the music <br/>
with my son. I Love to hear his take on music. At the same time, he loves to <br/>
listen to a classical disc we have called &quot;Baby Dance&quot;, that is a variety of <br/>
composers.<br/>
Neat subject to talk about.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I live for music, I mean it is my sanity keeper especially in my car.  I have <br/>
a Grand Marque Park Lane edition (If you dont know the car it is a retiree <br/>
car looks new but its not) with a chameleon stereo and a sub woofer.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
The teens go by us on the road thinking we are a bunch of old people (over <br/>
65) and they pull up beside us and hear Ozzy or a rap song it&#39;s a (quiet) <br/>
riot.  I of coarse have to beat them out of a light too. lol<br/>
<br/>
My son listens to everything now. Country, Rock, Hard rock, Classical you <br/>
name it.<br/>
I am still trying to be ok with M&M.  He is trying to get used to Betty Davis <br/>
Eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing like Mom and son fly-n down the highway to go to B & N blaring Ice <br/>
Ice Baby, lol. Ahh what a great life it tizzz.<br/>
