<div id="ygrps-yiv-99874962">There is one in Boxborough, MA, but it is not considered Unschooling. <br/>
It is on July 18th & 19th. It is &quot;2003 New England Homeschool & Family <br/>
Learning Conference&quot; <br/>
Looks like some of it is mixed but mostly Homeschool vendors.<br/>
Just in case someone wanted to go and was not aware of it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hated this conference. David Alpert was there, and that was good, but it&#39;s <br/>
overwhelmingly BA Christian, even though it claims to be inclusive. The <br/>
newsletter put out by the people that run it always seems to have SOMETHING <br/>
icky in it.<br/>
