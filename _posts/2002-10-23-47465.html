nodding in agreement! And be picking the switches for us!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT GOING TO GO AWAY if all the family members believe it&#39;s the right <br/>
thing to do! CAN&#39;T YOU TWO SEE THIS????<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;the village&quot; believes that abuse is fine, IT WILL HAPPEN!<br/>
<br/>
If one family abuses and the village says they&#39;re wrong to do it, it MAY <br/>
stop.<br/>
<br/>
But if Mommy was spanked and Daddy was spanked (as well as the grands and the <br/>
aunts and uncles of that extended family you two think are so important), and <br/>
they turned out just fine (and well-behaved after the spanking---right, <br/>
Mike?), WHAT&#39;S TO STOP THEM? THAT VILLAGE???????<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the capital letters mean I&#39;m SHOUTING!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to believe you two would show up at an unschooling list to <br/>
advocate spanking----and DON&#39;T TELL ME YOU&#39;RE NOT! It&#39;s obvious to everyone <br/>
here but the two of you that we think children (ALL CHILDREN) deserve the <br/>
same respect you&#39;d give another adult. What you&#39;re advocating DOESN&#39;T DO <br/>
THAT!<br/>
<br/>
They become property. And property that belongs to the &quot;village&quot;. Foxes <br/>
guarding the hen house. If everyone close to the children thinks that <br/>
spanking&#39;s OK, IT WILL HAPPEN! None of them will step in to protect the <br/>
youngest and most vulnerable. And mental hurt is hurt too. Pain is pain---it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be physical.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve chosen to remove ourselves and our boys from that family village you <br/>
think should intervene (but WON&#39;T). We&#39;ve made out own community of <br/>
like-minded people who value children as young humans, not grubs. All my <br/>
friends speak respectfully to my boys (well, John Tudor doesn&#39;t do a very <br/>
good job in a crowd, but he&#39;s great one-on-one! &lt;G&gt;) and treat them as they <br/>
would like to be treated. My boys are JUST as respectful in return. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re telling you things that WORK and that are gentle and kind and joyful <br/>
and giving and sweet. You&#39;re saying, yeah, but spanking works too---for some <br/>
people (because they&#39;re the parents) and we shouldn&#39;t interfere. You&#39;re on an <br/>
UNSCHOOLING LIST! <br/>
<br/>
As Sandra said, there are lists that will agree with you. THIS ONE WON&#39;T<br/>

story and I thought that a more narrow definition of spanking (versus <br/>
hitting and beating) would clarify the other side.  Now that I&#39;ve <br/>
done my best to unpolarize things, it&#39;s OK with me if I was <br/>
unsuccessful.<br/>

<br/>
This is an interesting point.  I suppose that if a poster (not you) <br/>
is abusive to another one by using capital letters and scolding <br/>
language (IMHO signalling a lack of respect), that poster can still <br/>
expect us to believe that when she turns from her keyboard she will <br/>
be sweet, loving, and kind to her kids.  Even if they argue with her <br/>
or oppose her like Myranda is accused of doing, in that situation she <br/>
will also not YELL or scold.  She only does it online.  Does that <br/>
also call for concentration and effort?  Or is this scolding streak <br/>
ingrained and shows itself more than we think it should?<br/>

These are things that doctors/educated physicians and counselors have all learned.<br/>
Its fine to be an accepting person,  that&#39;s wonderful and honky dorey, but it doesn&#39;t fix anything.  Its fine if we all want to live in la-la land.  But if there is actual stuff going on it won&#39;t stop with us saying &quot;oh, that&#39;s just them, they don&#39;t know any difference&quot;  My parents are just learning to be more compassionate people,  their generation spanked, but you know what.  If I would have just closed my eyes and said that&#39;s the way they are, well,,,,I would never be able to have a close, loving relationship with them.  They never knew how my siblings felt just seeing their baby siblings getting spanked.  They felt so horrible,  these things are just now coming out after 30 to 40 years.  Spanking is emotionally depilitating, to both the person getting spanked and to the siblings around that know that it is happening. ( They don&#39;t even have to see it,  even the implication of someone being spanked.)<br/>
 <br/>
We all will have to live with how we treat our children.  And I know I want mine to remember good and happy times.<br/>
 <br/>
We are all just trying to talk truths and sometimes our life experiences won&#39;t allow us to see them as truths.<br/>

  Kelly is not being pessimistic, she is being realistic. <br/>
<br/>
  ** I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s realistic to assume that most people will make harmful choices, and will not ever look for better choices and work on changing. Maybe I just don&#39;t know the same type people you guys do, but I&#39;ve moved around all my life and have met a LOT of people. <br/>
<br/>
   She is basing what she is saying on documented histories and facts.( and so is Nancy and so is Sandra and so on and so on)   These are not just generalizations or conclusions they have drawn! <br/>
<br/>
  ** I&#39;m confused, which parts of what is being said? I&#39;ve found quite a bit of documented history and facts that proves that when people work together as a family or small community, good changes do gradually come about, some quicker than others. Yes, I understand that people who were spanked are more likely to spank, and that&#39;s been proven and all, but that has nothing to do with what I&#39;m talking about. <br/>
<br/>
   These are things that doctors/educated physicians and counselors have all learned.<br/>
  Its fine to be an accepting person,  that&#39;s wonderful and honky dorey, but it doesn&#39;t fix anything. <br/>

  ** Yes, it can. I&#39;ve &quot;fixed&quot; several things, if you want to call it that, even with my accepting philosophy. My aunt no longer spanks or yells and now stays home with her daughter instead of dropping her off at daycare while she stayed home alone. Two people from a parents list I&#39;m on now homeschool their children, one is unschooling, the other is considering it.

<br/>
   Its fine if we all want to live in la-la land.

<br/>
  ** That&#39;s wonderful that you have that now. But that&#39;s your family, you have a right, maybe even a responsibility?, to teach, learn, and move forward with them.

<br/>
   They never knew how my siblings felt just seeing their baby siblings getting spanked.  They felt so horrible,  these things are just now coming out after 30 to 40 years.  Spanking is emotionally depilitating, to both the person getting spanked and to the siblings around that know that it is happening. ( They don&#39;t even have to see it,  even the implication of someone being spanked.)<br/>
<br/>
  We all will have to live with how we treat our children.  And I know I want mine to remember good and happy times.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871207483">I have been reading the posts on the spanking and I can&#39;t remember if it<br/>
was Sandra or someone else that said that they rarely see Jewish folks<br/>
spanking etc.<br/>
  I am very interested to hear more. Is anyone out there Jewish or knows<br/>
their parenting philosophy? Most of my friends have thought that Jewish<br/>
parents used the rod as much if not more than christians. This may sound<br/>
funny but I am just realizing that there are (true) christians out there<br/>
that don&#39;t believe in spanking.I have been told it is just the &quot;radical&quot;<br/>
ones.If you ask children (little ones) if they think Jesus would ever<br/>
spank...they usually say NO! Interesting isn&#39;t it? I am still learning in<br/>
this area. It doesn&#39;t sound like many of us came from non-spanking back<br/>
grounds.And I don&#39;t hear anyone saying much positive about their spanking<br/>
history...that it taught them alot.<br/>
  The books that seem to float around our neck of the woods (TN) is the<br/>
Train Up A Child sort. There are camps and meetings for them. We were<br/>
given a copy and found it too harsh, but others have said what a blessing<br/>
it was for them. I am just now stopping to wonder if it was a blessing<br/>
for their children!<br/>
  Any insights would be great.<br/>

you&#39;ll see that modern-day Jews are more against spanking than not, that<br/>

 This is an interesting point.  I suppose that if a poster (not you) <br/>
 is abusive to another one by using capital letters and scolding <br/>
 language (IMHO signalling a lack of respect), that poster can still <br/>
 expect us to believe that when she turns from her keyboard she will <br/>
 be sweet, loving, and kind to her kids.  Even if they argue with her <br/>
 or oppose her like Myranda is accused of doing, in that situation she <br/>
 will also not YELL or scold.  She only does it online.  Does that <br/>
 also call for concentration and effort?  Or is this scolding  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you exactly what Kelly does.<br/>
I lived with her for a weekend, and seen her under a LOT of stress, so I <br/>
think I gathered a fairly good idea of how she operates.<br/>
Yes, she yells at people that get on a list, unaware of it&#39;s feel and start <br/>
advocating things that the majority have worked hard and long to rid their <br/>
lives of.<br/>
But with her children?<br/>
She is kind, gentle, TRULY respectful and all this on a weekend where she had <br/>
to have been stressed to the max.<br/>
Her children are interesting individuals that treated me and my children just <br/>
like they would treat any other person, as a friend.<br/>
Duncan asked me to get him cereal in the morning, without hesitation, because <br/>
adults have always treated him with respect and he does not assume they are <br/>
the enemy.<br/>
When he asked Kelly for something, she responded with love, kindness and <br/>
empathy.<br/>
<br/>
I guarantee the yelling is saved for the stubborn people on this list that <br/>
are too engrained in a line of thought to say &quot;aha! I never thought of it <br/>
that way, where can I learn more?&quot; and instead try to defend indefensible <br/>
thoughts.<br/>

They respect their kids, they do whatever they can do to help them show love to them, they sacrifice so one parent can always be available for them, they research things like vaccinations and circumcism trying to get enough info to make the right choice, they start their own businesses so both parents can be with the children, they purchase the safest vehicle on the market when they have the first baby, and so on and so on. Even if they make one harmful choice in the midst of all of the &quot;good&quot; choices, does that make them a bad parent? I don&#39;t think so. No one&#39;s expected to be perfect. Does it scar the child for life? I don&#39;t think so, if they have a good foundation and balance with the parents. <br/>

  ** OK, just had a thought. For all of you who speak up and &quot;scold&quot; parents who are not treating their children right, do you also speak up and praise the ones who are? If positive reinforcement is supposed to be the best way to teach, wouldn&#39;t that be a good thing to do?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-578015188">Yes, it probably is biased. I&#39;ve said that I&#39;m taking this from the people I know. I realize that may not be a good standard, but I&#39;m happy that the people I know are this way.<br/>
Myranda<br/>
  From: Betsy <br/>
  I think you are looking at a biased sample, not the national average. <br/>
  While it is true that most of the moms that I hang out with at park days<br/>
  are stay-at-home moms, I thought recent statistics showed that MORE than<br/>
  half of moms with kids ages three and up are employed outside of the<br/>
  home, either part-time or full-time.<br/>
<br/>
  Generalizing about &quot;Jo Average Parent&quot; is so vague that it may not be<br/>
  fruitful for our discussions at all.<br/>

Okay so again it seems to be a definition of words. Can&#39;t one be unsafe from <br/>
having harmful words said to them? It&#39;s a different kind of hurt but can&#39;t <br/>
it be just as detrimental, if not more so? I think most of us would agree on <br/>
that. People can say some damaging things that do hurt. Think about the lady <br/>
in the store with your son. You blame what she said on undoing things you <br/>
had done with your son. That caused your son not to be safe did it not? <br/>
Wasn&#39;t he trying to kick you and maybe in turn hurt himself? And do you see <br/>
it as hurting him psychologically? He trusts a stranger&#39;s word over yours. <br/>
Words can do harm and make one unsafe in mind. Well spanking does the same <br/>
thing. It hurts the child. Maybe not on the butt, but look at a childs face <br/>
when they are getting a spanking. It hurts. That&#39;s not safe. So if that <br/>
child has the right to be safe, then he needs not be spanked.<br/>

Even went to &quot;tattle&quot; on us.....the community center apparently wasn&#39;t <br/>

I think I have to get this book,     I&#39;m feeling like alot of people think that unhappiness is just a way of life, and there is no other way.    I tell them about the way we are now living, child-led learning/unschooling life and they really think that my kids are going to miss the boat because the &#39;real&#39; world isn&#39;t like that!!      I keep saying, but it can be!   I&#39;m really trying to introduce all of this to them in a way that they won&#39;t think I&#39;m attacking them.   They really think there is no way to live and actually be truly happy.   <br/>
What&#39;s really sad to me is that if people keep thinking that way there won&#39;t be much happiness in their lives!<br/>

it&#39;s wrong.<br/>
Otherwise they&#39;d probably do it.<br/>
You are saying that you have never spanked your children, NEVER, yet you <br/>
don&#39;t have strong feelings about it being wrong?<br/>
How? I&#39;d really like to know.<br/>
Are you just extremely patient? Did your parents never, ever spank you?<br/>

about that? <br/>

The question isn&#39;t whether or not parents have the right to choose. We have <br/>
established that one. The question is, do YOU think, the parents already <br/>
established right (to hurt, to spank) supersedes (goes above) the child&#39;s <br/>
right to not be hurt, to feel safe and loved? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not one to advocate going with the flow, nor am I saying that is what <br/>
should be done in this situation. So please don&#39;t read that into what I am <br/>
about to say.<br/>
<br/>
On this list there are a few truths. A few things almost everyone here agrees <br/>
with, fights for and advocates. Examples of these could be the most obvious, <br/>
unschooling or like this current, never ending topic, spanking. Then there <br/>
are a few truths that many, but not all agree with, fight for and advocate. <br/>
Examples of these could be not circumcising and no vaccinations. Lastly there <br/>
are truths that some but not all believe in, these include things like being <br/>
vegetarians or vegans. <br/>
<br/>
So, maybe you don&#39;t agree with the rest of us about spanking. Fine. But do <br/>
you see how, since the rest of us feel one certain way about spanking, and <br/>
you are out there by your lonesome, crying &quot;but I have that right, and so do <br/>
other parents!&quot; isn&#39;t going to fly with the rest of us? Do you see how <br/>
repetitive, circular, argumentative posts are unproductive? Time and time <br/>
again people have posted EXACT quotes from you, asking you to clarify, asking <br/>
if this_____ (fill in the blank) is what you meant, and you have said, things <br/>
like &quot;Yes, that&#39;s it.&quot; and &quot;Yep that about covers it&quot; only to fairly scream <br/>
at us in the next post that you have been misquoted, that you NEVER said <br/>
THAT! Do you see, at all, that when countless people are saying the exact <br/>
same things to you, that maybe you need to stop, take a look, reread, take a <br/>
deep breath, and really see that what we are saying to you, about the things <br/>
you have said are true? <br/>

go and quit responding, but just couldn&#39;t resist. <br/>
