<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915902757">Hi Michelle and Trisha,<br/>
I too, have an only child, his name is Payton.  He is 5, and will be 6 at the <br/>
end of April.  I feel sorry for him when he says he&#39;s lonely.  It&#39;s funny <br/>
though, when he does get together with his friends or cousins, all he does is <br/>
fight!  He doesn&#39;t really have a problem with sharing, but it&#39;s more that he <br/>
wants to be in control of everything they do.  He&#39;s bossy, and used to having <br/>
things his way.  His imaginary friends seem to get along with him just fine <br/>
;O).  I  think that we have a special bond that may not be there if he had a <br/>
sibling.  It&#39;s a friendship type bond, we laugh and play games all the time, <br/>
we even argue like friends do sometimes, hehe.  As hard as he can be to get <br/>
along with at times, I&#39;m thankful he doesn&#39;t have a sibling!  I would much <br/>
rather be his playmate, it&#39;s very rewarding.  We started homeschooling in <br/>
Dec., that&#39;s when I took him out of ps.  We&#39;re taking it easy and learning <br/>
all the different ways of hs&#39;ing, and finding out what we both like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897993066">Thanks for the comments, I really do enjoy spending time with him and we <br/>
do alot together, but sometimes I feel like he wants more than just I can <br/>
give. I too was an only child, and I am somewhat of a loner. I have to have <br/>
time alone. Gary, seems to always want company he hates being alone. I don&#39;t <br/>
know if it&#39;s just a phase he&#39;s going through? or maybe it&#39;s just his <br/>
personality. What makes it even harder is that he tends to be shy and <br/>
self-concious. I tried enrolling him in community programs like karate <br/>
(which he loves at home) but he wouldn&#39;t participate. I didn&#39;t want to force <br/>
him.<br/>
   I think a pen-pal would be a great idea when he can spell or perhaps they <br/>
could dictate short notes. Sorry it takes me so long to respond, but I often <br/>
don&#39;t get time to be online until late. I appreciate the feedback though.<br/>
                              Thanks again<br/>
                                 Trisha<br/>
