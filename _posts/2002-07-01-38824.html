<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027911086">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i have a 10 year old who is very interested in earning money.  he&#39;s a few months away from being old enough for a paper route here in town.  does anyone have any job/work ideas for kids, or pertinent websites or books he could browse?  <br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556060706">My 9 yo son helps out family members who gladly pay him for his services.<br/>
<br/>
He pooper scoops, Grandma&#39;s yard, comes to help out when she needs to do<br/>
some planting, organizing of stuff (she has lots of stuff) and has washed<br/>
her small car.<br/>
<br/>
He goes to my parents house to mow the lawn with the riding lawnmower, help<br/>
collect firewood, and any other misc. job he can come up with.<br/>
<br/>
The Grandparents pay generously which is a great inscentive.  They are all<br/>
very capable of doing their own work, but thoroughly enjoy his company while<br/>
he is there, and like to help him understand money, which he does anyway.<br/>
<br/>
You might even search your neighborhood or town, for someone that needs yard<br/>
work done.  Maybe a veterinarian who would pay someone to walk the dogs,<br/>
or???<br/>

Mom while she works uninterupted on a project she&#39;d like to finish?  Some<br/>
serious deep cleaning work for you for which you&#39;d be willing to fork over a<br/>
few dollars?  Selling berries he picked in the wild, if you&#39;re lucky enough<br/>
to have a place around?  Holding a garage sale with some friends and all the<br/>
old stuff you can assemble?  Teaching younger children how to play chess or<br/>
do gymnastics or whatever?  Dragging all your/his old, unwanted books down<br/>
to the used book store?  Do you have a pop bottle refund...he could collect<br/>
abandonded bottles.  Not much gets you rich at 10, but it would be some $$<br/>
at least.<br/>

<br/>
OH YES!! A mother&#39;s helper kind of thing, where he plays with boys who don&#39;t <br/>
have brothers, just kinda being there and doing cool things with kids while <br/>
their mom is home but doing something else.<br/>
<br/>
We had a neighbor who did that for me and my kids when Holly was born and a <br/>
couple of years after.  She was 12-14, and I&#39;d give her $3 if I was home and <br/>
$5 an hour if I wasn&#39;t (when they were older, or if she would stay with Kirby <br/>
and Marty while I took Holly with me).  And her mom was three houses up the <br/>
street, so if she needed help it was near.<br/>

gets into it a little bit more seriously than a kid would, <br/>
though.  &lt;g&gt;  (He&#39;s the one I was forced to put back into school after a <br/>
year and a half of unschooling.  Major disaster on his self-esteem.)<br/>
