No stranger on an email list really MATTERS enough to me that I would get &quot;hurt&quot; by anything they say. I just take what they say as input - as <br/>
something to consider. I appreciate ideas that shake me up a little - that are strong and clear and don&#39;t pussyfoot around the point. <br/>

Hi all<br/>
I just had to say that this is exactly how I feel. I have only posted a few times on this list but I read with interest as much as I can. I am unschooling and love it. I also love the feel of community we are trying to build here. <br/>
I just wanted to add in my 2 cents to the topic.<br/>
God bless<br/>
