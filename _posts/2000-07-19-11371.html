chicken (too loud)<br/>

What types of quiet animals are there at the fair would be a good idea to <br/>
raise?<br/>

&gt;Subject: OT-flea bites<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a question--I am highly allergic to flea bites. We were at the <br/>
&gt;Fairgrounds for 4H. and I was sitting on the ground w/my dd&#39;s club. I <br/>
&gt;never thought of fleas!!!  I got many many bites all over my legs and <br/>
&gt;thighs. they get red, hot  & painfully itchy.  does anyone know of any <br/>
&gt;herbal o homeopathic remedies for this?  I kept me up last night(along <br/>
&gt;with the person who called about homeschooling at 12:30am!!!!! but that&#39;s <br/>
&gt;another story!)<br/>
&gt;  thanks<br/>
&gt;   Debra<br/>
