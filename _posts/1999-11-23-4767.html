&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Has anyone heard of Goddard College in Vermont?  I was going through a<br/>
&gt; book I got at the library which lists accredited colleges in the U.S. and<br/>
&gt; Canada that have off-campus/long distance learning with degrees available.<br/>
&gt; Goddard was one of them so I did a search on the Internet and was really<br/>
&gt; surprised to read about them.  They sound like a perfect unschooler&#39;s<br/>
&gt; college.  The learning is very self-directed and the on-campus classes are<br/>
&gt; small discussion groups with teachers acting instead as &quot;facilitators.&quot;  I<br/>
