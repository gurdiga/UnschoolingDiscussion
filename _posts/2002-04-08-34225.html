<div id="ygrps-yiv-462379132">&lt;&lt; I think that unless an unschooler is totally underground, they <br/>
probably ought to use the word homeschooling in cases where there is <br/>
law involved.  After all that&#39;s what most of the statutes call it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t use the same answer in all cases.  If another homeschooler  asks, <br/>
it&#39;s unschooling.  If someone outside of homeschooling asks, it&#39;s <br/>
homeschooling.  It&#39;s a matter of perspective.<br/>
<br/>
This is an example I&#39;ve used before and it&#39;s easy for even kids to <br/>
understand.  If someone asks in person, conversationally, &quot;Where do you <br/>
live?&quot; the answer depends on where THEY live.  If you&#39;re in a foreign country <br/>
and they ask, all you need to give is the name of your country.  They  might <br/>
or might not ask for more.  (So in England, Holly said &quot;the United States.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re across the country, you name your state/province.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re across the state, you name your town.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re across town, you name your neighborhood or cross-streets.<br/>
<br/>
In your neighborhood you say &quot;across from the park&quot; or &quot;behind Hollywood Vid<br/>
eo,&quot; or you give the street name or address.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re standing on your street and can see your house and they ask, you <br/>
point at it and say &quot;right there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same with this: <br/>
they don&#39;t go to public school <br/>
homeschool<br/>
unschool<br/>
radical unschooling<br/>
