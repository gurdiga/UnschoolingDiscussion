<div id="ygrps-yiv-575522211">Well, this is from a whole house full of guitar and other musical<br/>
instrument players.  Hubby who plays all kinds of guitars and has played<br/>
sax and drums, says that a combination kiddy book and fun things by ear are<br/>
the best way.  He says you use the kiddy books (there are some designed<br/>
just for the age you are talking about) to show them the cords and then<br/>
have a tape to record it and then they can hear it away from the guitar and<br/>
then play with the guitar.  There are also some CD&#39;s and tapes that go with<br/>
the books.  He also said that learning cords is really better than learning<br/>
finger picking (single notes) at first because they can learn 2 or 3 cords<br/>
and play whole songs (there are people who have made millions writing songs<br/>
with only 3 guitar cords in them.).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK - here&#39;s my first question  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My boys (5.5 and almost 4) used some of their Christmas money to<br/>
&gt; purchase 1/2 size guitars.  Neither my dh or I play (a 16 YO guy-friend<br/>
&gt; of their babysitter plays and got them interested).  I have a backround<br/>
&gt; in music, but do not know the first thing about the guitar.  I spent<br/>
&gt; some time this weekend learning to tune it and pecking out a few scales<br/>
&gt; (learning my way around the instrument).  What I&#39;m not sure of is how to<br/>
&gt; proceed with the boys.  My instinct tells me the the 4 YO is not really<br/>
&gt; ready yet, the 5 YO is probably on the verge of being ready to learn to<br/>
&gt; play.  Zachary, the oldest one, said that he wanted to learn how to play<br/>
&gt; Home on the Range, but mostly they both have been messing around with<br/>
&gt; strumming and picking.  I want to take the cues from them - they seem<br/>
&gt; interested - but I think that it might be best to just let them mess<br/>
&gt; around some more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe while I&#39;m teaching myself a little, I should wait and see if they<br/>
&gt; follow?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At this age, should I just encourage learning by ear?<br/>

My 5 yr old has a guitar too.  We bought the video lessons from Marcy<br/>
Marxer.  She is really goo I think, and progresses slowly.  He has not done<br/>
much with it, but as he gets older I think we will try more.  Anyway, I<br/>
recommend them.  And hopefully their babysitter will share his knowledge.<br/>
A<br/>
Oh, we got the video, and the guitar from Music For Little People Catalog.<br/>

Unfortunately, the babysitter&#39;s guy-friend wasn&#39;t interested in giving<br/>
them little mini lessons.  That was my initial plan (shucks).<br/>

Can you give us a couple of titles/authors that your hubby recommends?  I <br/>
have a son who wants to learn how to play too.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876955777">I think they are the Mel Bay books and also, Disney use to have a set for<br/>
learning the keyboard and one for the guitar that were really fun for the<br/>
younger kidlets.  they have all the fun little jingle type songs in them<br/>
that the kidlets like to sing like London Bridge and Twinkle Twinkle Little<br/>
Star and the Disney songs the kidlets usually know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572829079">&lt;&lt;what do others do with music?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago, Adriane wanted to take piano lessons from a friend of<br/>
mine.  We bought a piano and she took lessons and occasionally even<br/>
practiced  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Since we moved 2 years ago, she has no interest in lessons.  The piano is in<br/>
the living room and occasionally somebody spends an afternoon playing around<br/>
with it.  The little kids like to pound on it fairly frequently.  We have<br/>
music available and I know how to read music so I answer any questions that<br/>
come up.<br/>
