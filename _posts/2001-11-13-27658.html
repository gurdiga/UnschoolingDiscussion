We usually used evaporated milk.  And...........horror of horrors,  even started<br/>
off mixing the sugar with EGG.     Showing my age.......that was before the<br/>
rules about never, ever, never  using uncooked egg.   (We even put eggs in ice<br/>
cream milkshakes).<br/>

I don&#39;t follow all the rules.<br/>
We never used egg in snow cream, but there are times when uncooked eggs are <br/>
useful, especially when they&#39;re from my sister&#39;s chickens and I trust them.  <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of &quot;rules&quot; that have to do with restaurants not getting sued, <br/>
or with picnic foods (being out in the heat for hours before people eat them) <br/>
that shouldn&#39;t have been applied to home food preparation of things never <br/>
leaving the kitchen and being eaten right away.<br/>
