<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429912178">We got a house!  I&#39;m SO happy and excited!!!<br/>
<br/>
And nervous...we have 10 days to move and I haven&#39;t packed a thing, save <br/>
three boxes of books.  AAAAHHH!<br/>
<br/>
Add that to the fact that I&#39;m packing and moving alone...my husband <br/>
conveniently doesn&#39;t get home until the day AFTER we have to be out of this <br/>
house...and I&#39;m a nervous wreck!<br/>
<br/>
At least I&#39;m a nervous wreck with a house...could be worse!<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share something good since I&#39;ve been feeling so sorry for myself <br/>
as of late. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545053407">Thanks Laura!  I have to buy furniture before I can have a house warming <br/>
party!  LOL I am READY to be out of *this* hot house though!  House <br/>
&#39;warming&#39; doesn&#39;t even sound good right now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Hey, you did the important stuff first...cool.<br/>
You can do it!! I packed 90% of our 3200 sf house by myself, with an 8month old baby in tow when we moved down to FL five years ago. UGH!<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t want to do it again, but we survived.<br/>
<br/>
Just breathe deep and chant to yourself a lot. :)<br/>
<br/>
AND, when you get time, email me with your new addy and I&#39;ll mail the pics of the ocean/ship themed stuff.<br/>
