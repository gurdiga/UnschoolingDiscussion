<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022221939">Put up or shut up time, Sandra.  Either have your supposed sources stand up<br/>
and be counted or stuff your bs!  You are good at English, or so you say, so<br/>
you should know the definition of libel.  Also, just in case you didn&#39;t<br/>
know, being the promulgator of innuendos and gossip is actionable.<br/>
<br/>
I usually ignore you when you stoop yet once again to sophomoric behavior.<br/>
Lots of folks think you are a bag of hot air, posturing and strutting around<br/>
playing expert and that ignoring you would be the best way to deal with<br/>
someone with National Enquirer journalistic proclivities.  Twould appear<br/>
that they were wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are now attacking others, I will be more than happy to send them<br/>
chapter and verse on where you are stepping over the legal line and how to<br/>
deal with you.  I hope we are real clear on this now.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, you are aware that there is medication for delusional behavior and<br/>
paranoia.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; That isn&#39;t an example of dishonesty.  that&#39;s an example of<br/>

&gt; AND, she did come back and explain it and people are still harping.  In<br/>
&gt; fact, she explained it in great depth.  I don&#39;t have to go back to look,<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; was about being the only one who could fix it once it was unhooked.  They<br/>
&gt; know it, she knows it, the whole list knows it if they bothered to read<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; was written, not what they decided was written.  So what&#39;s dishonest.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think part of what&#39;s dishonest is that someone has come onto this list<br/>
&gt; without good intent.  I&#39;ve been told that some of these who are so<br/>
vehemently &gt; defending questionable stuff are on another list together, so I<br/>
wonder (and<br/>
&gt; have been asking, in various ways) how much of the recent noise has been<br/>
for &gt; the sake of disruption.  A kind of social vandalism.<br/>
