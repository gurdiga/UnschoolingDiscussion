<div id="ygrps-yiv-74430660">I need some help please!<br/>
<br/>
This is totally a non-unschooling topic.  But I was wondering if anyone<br/>
knows if the store Laura Ashley is still in business?  We used to have a<br/>
few in Canada and I&#39;ve just found out they have all closed.  I&#39;m<br/>
surprised and devastated.  I&#39;ve never been able to do a lot of shopping<br/>
there but when appropriate, I did hit sales at stores in other<br/>
provinces.  (There&#39;s never been one in Saskatchewan)<br/>
I cannot access them at all via the internet either so if anyone can<br/>
help-out here I&#39;d be much obliged.  I&#39;d hate to think they&#39;ve gone out<br/>
of business.  Do I need a trip to Great Britain to find one?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any and all help,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi Sonia,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I went to the Laura Ashley website at<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.laura-ashley.com/">http://www.laura-ashley.com/</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you follow the links, you will get to a page that tells you where all<br/>
&gt; the stores are located. I clicked on North America and it looks as though<br/>
&gt; there are only 6 listed. Now I don&#39;t know how recent this map is, but once<br/>
&gt; you get to the website, surely you should be able to get more information.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps,<br/>
&gt; Patti<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I just got lost in thought.  It was unfamiliar territory.<br/>
