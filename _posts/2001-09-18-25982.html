I am currently struggling with my almost 10yr old re: reading (or lack<br/>
thereof).....I know part of my struggle comes from my own having been<br/>
&#39;schooled&#39; and having been an early reader.  My dh  and I LOVE to read,<br/>
have always read to her.....she says she hates it (but begs us to read<br/>
stories to her still).  She listens to books on tape,  gets people to read<br/>
to her.  She loves games but her illiteracy is beginning to interfere (i.e.,<br/>
in Harry Potter trivia...you&#39;ve got to read questions to opponents).  She<br/>
loves logic and math problems.....gets Mathmania,  but can&#39;t read the puzzle<br/>
instructions.  She&#39;s oldest of four......and with the littler ones around<br/>
it&#39;s not like I can be there to read things to her when she wants.  I am<br/>
frustrated and exasperated.  I want her to read.  And I&#39;m trying trying<br/>
tring not to allow my feelings to get in her way.  I just cannot understand<br/>
why she doesn&#39;t want to read.....why doesn&#39;t she see its value?  why doesn&#39;t<br/>
she see she needs it to do things she WANTS to do?  Can I stay out of her<br/>
way and let her come to this on her own?  I am struggling with falling off<br/>
the unschooling wagon....though I&#39;m sure if I push her,  she&#39;ll resist<br/>
stubbornly.  (So I&#39;m thinking of a tutor*****and now ducking the backlash<br/>
from this list LOL!*****)<br/>
     Honestly,  do all of you just truly always trust.....Or is reading like<br/>
the swimmimg lessons Nance has mentioned?  In other words,  have I let her<br/>
down by not knowing how to make her comfortable in the great &#39;pool&#39; of<br/>
reading?<br/>
Suz---about to pull my hair out on this one.<br/>
<br/>
I did this a bit with my son, pointing to words or using my finger to<br/>
follow along.  Then I&#39;d look at him and he was very obviously looking away<br/>
from the book until I stopped.  &lt;g&gt;  He read at age 12, and then only<br/>
because I slipped away from my unschooling ideals and made him.  (He still<br/>
doesn&#39;t read very well at 13, likely *because* of the pressure I put on him<br/>
earlier.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-542882394">&lt;&lt;unschooling parenting&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I see a difference between education and day to day stuff.  I don&#39;t<br/>
force my kids to learn anything (education) but sometimes I do need the kids<br/>
to do something they already know how to do, such as clean up a mess they<br/>
made (chores---we call anything that needs to get done a chore, many of them<br/>
we enjoy, many of them are simply necessary, the kids have chores, I have<br/>
chores, dh has chores)<br/>
<br/>
Example:  I don&#39;t need dd to learn to read.  No one is relying on her to<br/>
learn to read.  She will learn it when she either wants to or needs to.<br/>
BUT....I need her to clean her rabbit cages.  The rabbit is relying on her<br/>
for his health.  She doesn&#39;t need to learn how to do it.  She already knows<br/>
how, she just needs to bite the bullet.  The rabbit is a project of hers,<br/>
chosen freely by her from which she earns ribbons, honors and sometimes even<br/>
money based on how she compares with other rabbit raisers.  Because of this,<br/>
I don&#39;t help out much with them.  I help out a lot with the dog, its a pet,<br/>
its hers, but there is no competition as to her husbandry.<br/>
<br/>
The way we as a family have chosen to handle the chore situation is with a<br/>
breakfast meeting.  We all talk about what needs to be done that day<br/>
(shopping, vacuuming, clean rabbit cages, whatever) with everyone having<br/>
input.  Then people begin to volunteer for chores that they prefer.  Today,<br/>
8yo volunteered to fix lunch and dust while 4yo volunteered to clean<br/>
toilets.  I volunteered to clean 10yo rabbit cages because her wrist is<br/>
injured.  All kids volunteered to help straighten mess the 2yo made in 10yo<br/>
room.  Usually there are 1 or 2 things left that nobody jumped up an down<br/>
about and usually I do those or we do them together.  But we consider these<br/>
things chores because they have to get done.  If you don&#39;t feed the goat,<br/>
the goat suffers.<br/>
<br/>
But in my opinion, there is a difference between learning things and doing<br/>
things that you already know how to do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Been there done that.  It&#39;s really a tough one to wait out.  I think my <br/>
impatience started to build when Lars was around 10.  It peaked at 12 and I <br/>
gave in to it, making him do phonics with me.  Try not to make that <br/>
mistake.  I think now that if I had left him alone, he&#39;d be reading well by <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I must have been my karma or something.  For years I&#39;ve done phone <br/>
counselling of new homeschoolers and always told them not to worry about <br/>
reading, that their child would come to it when ready.  Of course I *would* <br/>
have to get an especially late reader.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

either isn&#39;t ready to do it on her own, or she doesn&#39;t yet want to badly <br/>
