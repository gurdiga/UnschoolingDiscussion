<div id="ygrps-yiv-382205152">Thanks for all the input on reading.  I really want to feel like I don&#39;t have <br/>
to justify my choices to anyone, maybe with time I will be able to gain that <br/>
confidence.  I know what is most important is my child and his desire to <br/>
learn.  I don&#39;t want to mess that up with forcing anything.  My friend whose <br/>
son I mentioned read at 5 and is breezing through the Harry Potter books.  He <br/>
did however make a comment that second grade is hard and when his Mom <br/>
questioned him about why he thought that (maybe hoping to be able to help him <br/>
with a particular struggle) he simply commented that is wasn&#39;t fun.  I think <br/>
prior to this he enjoyed school.  Now I wonder if since the fun of learning <br/>
is no longer there, will he continue to be the advanced student that he has <br/>
always been.  The way we do things now, my son really seems to love learning <br/>
and is naturally curious about a lot of things.  I really want to do all I <br/>
can to keep it that way.<br/>
