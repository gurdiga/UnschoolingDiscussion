<br/>
But, to answer your question as respectfully as possible (and then say no <br/>
more! ;-), I don&#39;t consider a fetus to be a &quot;child&quot;, therefore your question <br/>
doesn&#39;t affect my views on abortion OR on unschooling. <br/>

&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are <br/>
to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and <br/>
servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>
