<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731548108">&lt;Grin&gt;  In a parallel discussion on our parent-directed education <br/>
list, someone said she thinks her children learn more from Bugs Bunny and <br/>
Mr.Peabody than from some of NEA&#39;s certified &quot;educational programming. <br/>
<br/>
       Which moved me to post this:<br/>
       <br/>
       Yesterday we were off on a jaunt when 8-year-old suddenly asks why <br/>
Confederate script is worthless. The only context he would have for the Civil War <br/>
that I could think of was one of his Magic Tree House stories, but it turns <br/>
out he had seen a Scooby-Doo cartoon in which this was a plot point. He wanted <br/>
to understand more about what it meant. <br/>
<br/>
       We wound up having a pretty wide-ranging conversation about <br/>
revisionist history, such as what if England had won the American Revolution, or if his <br/>
father and I had never met. <br/>
<br/>
