<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843690517">You&#39;re doing fine, except that if you are trying to place them as eventual<br/>
service dogs they should have *very* little interaction with other dogs (1/2<br/>
hour per day for socialization so they aren&#39;t afraid of other dogs is good,<br/>
much more and they&#39;ll get too &quot;doggy&quot; and not people-oriented enough) and<br/>
MUCH interaction with the people, not to mention a LOT of time &quot;around town&quot;<br/>
getting used to sites and smells, and also time in a formal obedience class<br/>
so that a trainer can point out any deficiencies in the training (and so<br/>
that you can learn how to go beyond &quot;sit&quot; :).<br/>
<br/>
If you have not talked to the service dog organization of your choice and<br/>
been given their guidelines, I&#39;d do that ASAP. Most service dog<br/>
organizations breed their own dogs, and those that don&#39;t are understandably<br/>
very picky about the temperament and intelligence and willingness of the<br/>
dogs they take in, and they reject a lot more than they take. If you don&#39;t<br/>
get a positive response from the organization you&#39;re thinking of, you can<br/>
place them as pets now while they&#39;re still cute enough to appeal to a<br/>
family.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Dog questions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have 2 puppies, courtesy of Dar&#39;s dog (kiss and hug to Nana) that are 13<br/>
&gt; weeks old.  They are half border collie.  I am attempting to teach them<br/>
&gt; manners, etc., hoping a service dog organization will take them in a few<br/>
&gt; months.  Here is the dilemma.  The farthest I have ever gotten in dog<br/>
&gt; training is &quot;sit&quot;.  I have read lots of books but they all deal with a<br/>
&gt; single dog.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have crate trained the pups in their own crates.  They have time to spend<br/>
&gt; playing just with each other and times they are in our half-acre pen with<br/>
&gt; our adult dogs.  I have been trying to use a &quot;lead&quot; system, where the dog is<br/>
&gt; attached to me on a 4-foot lead in the house or attached to a short lead in<br/>
&gt; their &quot;settle down&quot; area.  We have lots of toys, bones, etc..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been working with them one at a time.  Does this sound on track at<br/>
&gt; all or could someone recommend a good book?  Just wanting to do what I can<br/>
&gt; to try to help these pups find a more suitable home than our very pet-heavy<br/>
&gt; one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm I have to disagree with this.  Part of socialization is to get them used <br/>
to all kinds of situations, including other animals.  When they enter the <br/>
school they need to be able to associate with  other dogs.  I have raised <br/>
leader puppies for several years and the school we are affiliated with does <br/>
not discourage interaction with the family pets and in fact encourages off <br/>
leash play with the family dogs.  They do request to attempt to limit in <br/>
house rough play such as running around but not daily contact.  <br/>
<br/>
I do agree with contacting the agency soon though and will tell you that the <br/>
paws for a cause (local name for helping dogs for the deaf or disabled) are <br/>
less stringent on the acceptance standards.  Here they do not have a large <br/>
breeding program established yet.<br/>
