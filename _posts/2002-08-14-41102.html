<br/>
Quite a lively list these days! And always jammed with interesting and<br/>
thought-provoking dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of insurance for an older unschooler - I have tackled this in<br/>
my own way. . . both for the insane realm of health insurance and the<br/>
difficult realm of child support. I enrolled my son in Clonlara. I know it<br/>
doesn&#39;t fit into the supposed outline of unschooling, but we needed to do<br/>
something in order to satisfy the bureaucracy as to the &quot;authenticity&quot; of<br/>
his schooling endeavors. This did it - he got a school ID card and a letter<br/>
from Clonlara saying that he was enrolled. It  cost $500, but this was far<br/>
less than the alternative of loosing insurance and/or child support. Now,<br/>
my son is continuing his own education in his own creative way . . . we are<br/>
currently preparing a &quot;portfolio&quot; of his endeavors (which, by the way,<br/>
looks nothing short of stellar - another unschooling shining star!). He<br/>
doesn&#39;t know where his studies will take him, we remain unattached - but<br/>
the &#39;authorities&#39; are satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful - and by the way, would that unschooled 19 year old<br/>
son be interested in dialoguing with another 19 year old unschooled young<br/>
man? Contact off list, if so.<br/>
<br/>
In aloha, Lee<br/>
