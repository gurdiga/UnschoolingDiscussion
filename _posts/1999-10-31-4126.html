<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      One side thing I thought about while reading this: with a passion for<br/>
&gt; German Literature, you must have read Goethe.  I am just starting to read<br/>
&gt; him, having read some of his quotes in other books.  Are there any of his<br/>
&gt; writings that you would recommend in particular?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try &quot;Faust, Part I&quot; and &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#39;s Apprenticeship&quot; for starters.<br/>
You may also be interested in &quot;Sorrows of the Young Werther.&quot;  That work was<br/>
one of the prominent influences of the Storm and Stress period (1760s) in<br/>
German literature; not unlike the youth rebellion in this country during the<br/>
1960s.<br/>
