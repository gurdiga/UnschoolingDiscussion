<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262233756">Cool.  That brings up a number thing: 2 lights versus halves/half <br/>
light(s).  2 halves make one or one whole, or vice versa, cut or half 1<br/>
<br/>
to get 2.  One whole day is made up of sun and moon (at some point <br/>
during day or night in some phase or other).<br/>
<br/>
Similarly another word revealing opposites is &quot;cleave&quot; which at <br/>
different times means to separate or cut (as with an ax) or to join so <br/>
closely as to defy separation tactics (as when two lives are one -- and<br/>
<br/>
forsaking all others etc -- &quot;you and me against the world&quot;).  More <br/>
precisely the meaning of cleave is to come in close contact with, which<br/>
<br/>
can mean both cut/separate (again the ax) and join.  Definition by <br/>

Kathe....  who got a little attached to the idea of Venus and Mercury <br/>
being twilights-- but now enjoying the sound of the numbers that <br/>
happened while reading the twilight definition.<br/>

<br/>
A bit more OT: Are others like me?  I&#39;m so far behind in email, I know<br/>
I <br/>
ask questions without looking up the answer and probably somebody just <br/>
said what I&#39;m asking.  I did that in my last post.  *sigh*  I used to <br/>
webpost but now I use a desktop email program.  There are pros and cons<br/>
<br/>
both ways.  I get impatient with how the threads aren&#39;t really <br/>
sequential and I also find the same thread in different batches instead<br/>
<br/>
of sorted together.  (Happens on the web *and* on my desktop so I<br/>
assume <br/>
it&#39;s a Yahoodle thing.)  I&#39;m not very good with sequence in real life<br/>
so <br/>
this confuses heck out of me.  If I&#39;m really curious I just ask rather <br/>
than spend time looking around for answers.  Of course this doesn&#39;t <br/>
meant that I never read the archives see what people have said in the <br/>
past on a topic, but I don&#39;t often stop in the middle of reading to <br/>
search the archives.<br/>
<br/>
No need for replies really.  Just a mini :rant:.  Excuse please as I <br/>
read on.<br/>

<br/>
repeating that twilight has anything to do with Venus and Mercury.  It <br/>
probably has nothing to do with it, and was only a wrong idea I had.<br/>
