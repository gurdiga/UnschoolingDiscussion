<br/>
Free speech my ass. Many posts are NOT making it through to the list <br/>
unless they are in agreement with the governing clique. That&#39;s a damn <br/>
shame that they all stick together and the moderator only allows <br/>
posts that make them look good. What a joke & damn pathetic I might <br/>
add, but not very honest! Ha! I guess the reason that only a few <br/>
people post is because no one else is allowed!<br/>
<br/>
Rue, get a life & stop tattling. It&#39;s so unattractive.<br/>

Sandra, I just read your articles elsewhere on the web and was very <br/>
impressed with what you wrote, but when I saw your posts here, the <br/>
hostility shocked me.<br/>
<br/>
As the old addage goes, &quot; you catch more bees with honey than <br/>
vinegar&quot;. <br/>
(anyway, something like that...) I think anyone is probably going to <br/>
get <br/>
defensive if attacked, although Oom seemed to be responding without <br/>
attacking back. I also think picking apart posts really takes things <br/>
out <br/>
of context and leads to unintended nastiness.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree that spanking is wrong. I got ONE  &quot;swat&quot; with a <br/>
paddle <br/>
as punishment in Jr. High School from the principal( I hope that this <br/>
is <br/>
outlawed now--it was punishment for tardiness) and I&#39;m still mad at <br/>
that <br/>
man today, twenty years on! It wasn&#39;t the pain--although it did <br/>
hurt--but the utter humiliation and rage I felt towards him <br/>
afterwards. <br/>
I used to like him, too-- but never again.<br/>
<br/>
As I learned about myself when I first started attending La Leche <br/>
meetings (breastfeeding group), and I believe this to be true of most <br/>
of <br/>
us, is that you do not always really Hear what is being said until <br/>
you <br/>
are ready to hear it. There may come a time when someone who spanks <br/>
(or <br/>
occasionally slaps) is ready to &quot;hear &quot; what opponents say against <br/>
it. <br/>
Then he or she will remember those gentle voices and , I hope , stop.<br/>
<br/>
E.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
E.  I wanted to add that I too have read everything I can find that <br/>
Sandra has written on the web.  I thought how wonderful, what a <br/>
gentle caring person.  THEN I came here, my thoughts on her <br/>
personally are quite different after &quot;experiencing&quot; her &quot;in person&quot; <br/>
so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I think she does a lot of good things with her children and raised <br/>
them remarkably by the evidence of her writings but it sure changed <br/>
my mind about her as a person.<br/>
<br/>
I know people here who&#39;ve met her rave about her kindness and <br/>
gentleness.  I haven&#39;t seen it.  I HAVE seen lots of rude, lots of <br/>
name calling, lots of taking things out of context and then she <br/>
editorializes it and tells YOU what you wrote or were thinking and <br/>
then every one of course (well MOST everyone) then reads what Sandra <br/>
wrote as the FACTS and that&#39;s how life goes.<br/>
<br/>
So, yet again Sandra wonders why others stay if we dislike the list <br/>
so much.  Here&#39;s the answer from my standpoint.  I don&#39;t dislike the <br/>
list.  I dislike Sandra, she&#39;s a small part of the list.  She&#39;s rude <br/>
when she need not be, she&#39;s short and hateful often as well, <br/>
especially to new people.  To some she&#39;s not.  <br/>
<br/>
I stay because there are decent kind people who are willing to put <br/>
out a hand to help someone along the path of this unschooling <br/>
journey.  There is always much to learn and hearing the experience of <br/>
those who&#39;ve gone before is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I personally, am not here because of Sandra, but in SPITE of her at <br/>
times.  If I were only here to complain about how someone posts or <br/>
treats others then I would probably have left a long time ago.  If I <br/>
only wanted to take advantage of Sandra&#39;s wisdom, I could just read <br/>
her articles over and over online for free.  If I had a problem I <br/>
could probably find something she&#39;s written or linked to it online.<br/>
<br/>
The nastiness is just a small part of the list it&#39;s always (again let <br/>
me clarify ALMOST always) a new person finding their way and the same <br/>
people attacking and then saying they never attacked, were never <br/>
rude, etc.  Seems like it&#39;s a cycle.  When one stops posting in <br/>
defense of the non attack (or gets moderated forever) then a new <br/>
person fills the slot very quickly as the new, never will be right, <br/>
wickedly wrong, stop posting or pay the price candidate.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t the first, and I wasn&#39;t the last and I&#39;m sure this last <br/>
attack will not be the last either.<br/>
<br/>
It was hard for me to accept others being treated like this, but it&#39;s <br/>
going to happen.  No one can stop it.  It will only cause the poster <br/>
to leave or get moderated or just stop posting all together, those <br/>
are the options once you&#39;ve raised the ire of certain people here.  <br/>
It won&#39;t change, no matter how much any of us suggest, cajole, offer, <br/>
demand, insinuate or plead.  In a way it&#39;s bullying at it&#39;s finest <br/>
isn&#39;t it?  The one part doesn&#39;t see any bullying at all, others feel <br/>
the lumps and bruises for days and fade back into the background <br/>
where they&#39;ve been sent.<br/>
<br/>
Except we are adults, free to leave anytime to avoid the bullying but <br/>
in leaving we might miss something very important that helps us <br/>
achieve our goals of raising our children in the best unschooling way <br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
So we make a choice, stay and learn, grit our teeth at times or just <br/>
leave.  It&#39;s sad but that&#39;s the way it is, it unfortunately is simply <br/>
not going to change it seems.  If one does not see a problem their <br/>
will be no fix.  Just as was posted that Oom saw no problem with <br/>
smacking her child in such a situation so she couldn&#39;t be regretful <br/>
nor change, it goes both ways.  If no one &quot;sees&quot; it as a problem and <br/>
they very vehemently deny there is one, then it will never change.<br/>

missing and one from you, Glena. And now you&#39;ve gotten yours on the list.<br/>
<br/>
The other 3 you wanted to post were just cluelessly hurtful of people who<br/>
aren&#39;t on anyone&#39;s black list. It was more to save you from looking bad and<br/>
saving some unnecessary hurt.<br/>
<br/>
What is the purpose here? Has the unschooling and parenting advice been so<br/>
bad that we&#39;ve caused you to hurt your children and made your lives so much<br/>
worse than they were before you joined that people want to wreck the list?<br/>

That post of Glena&#39;s was posted by a driveby poster (Beetnikchick) that<br/>
Glena shared privately with her.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a joke. It&#39;s just very very sad. I hope she&#39;s apologized to you.<br/>

You know, she can&#39;t MAKE you read her posts.  You are probably smart<br/>
enough to screen out emails from her or use your delete key or scroll<br/>
bar to move past them without stopping.<br/>
<br/>
You started off your post with some strong words about free speech, but<br/>
now I&#39;m getting the idea that you&#39;d prefer only &quot;free polite unassertive speech&quot;.<br/>

Many of the people you put in the &quot;decent kind&quot; category learned much of<br/>
what they know about unschooling from Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
Think about that for a minute.<br/>
