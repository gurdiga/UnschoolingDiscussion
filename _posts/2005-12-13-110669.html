<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588158979">Our dd (11yo) wants the new &quot;fly pen.&quot;   It&#39;s expensive, but all the <br/>
reviews are coming in that it is a great toy for the middle years.  <br/>
But, she told me she didn&#39;t want or need the &quot;Test in Math, Science & <br/>
History&quot; software for it, saying &quot;I don&#39;t do test!&quot;.  She is also <br/>
getting the &quot;Dark Fairie&quot; PS2 game.<br/>
