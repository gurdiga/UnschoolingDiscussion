<div id="ygrps-yiv-928342531">Many thanks to all for the software suggestions. I especially appreciated <br/>
the idea about downloading portions to see if my son will like it before we <br/>
buy it. We have a DK distributor here in town, too. I&#39;m going to check out <br/>
Zoombinis, Yoiks, Mathblaster, Readingblaster and Mathquest and let you all <br/>
know how Tony and I like them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, I couldn&#39;t have gotten such great, timely advice anywhere <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
Annette<br/>
