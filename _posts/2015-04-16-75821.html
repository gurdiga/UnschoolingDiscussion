<div id="ygrps-yiv-205744956">Even if it&#39;s just internal, it can help to remember that someone (maybe a stranger, maybe a friend or relative) did or said something one time that caused you to change directions, with your parenting or with your educational philosophy.  I asked the other day on Just Add Light and Stir, and as part of a longer response (you can read it at the link below in the comments, or at the link within the post) was this, about magic.   <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t fishing for personal thanks, at all, and this is shared with other voices on my site:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 it was Sandra Dodd and Company who really got the ball rolling with regards to unschooling. Once I discovered her work, I read everything of hers I could find, and then I re-read it, slowly and over time, while trying a little...and then a little more, and then more...and then waited for the magic to work. And work it did! <br/>

Thanks to everyone who writes things others can use to find magic in their own lives.<br/>
