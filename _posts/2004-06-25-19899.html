<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709339559">Hi All,<br/>
 <br/>
I have a question about freedom and choice, or what is related to it <br/>
more to the point.....<br/>
 <br/>
I totally get what has been written here by Sandra and you all....<br/>
 <br/>
Here is my question....<br/>
 <br/>
How do you relate to others who just do not seem to get it?<br/>
 <br/>
I ask this because I am this situation with two people in my life <br/>
right now, both whom do not get this concept of choice and freedom <br/>
at all. It is frustrating and I find myself distancing myself from <br/>
them simply because they do not get it! They do not understand that <br/>
everything in their lives is a choice, including as someone wrote, <br/>
how they choose to feel and how they choose to interrelate with <br/>
myself and others.<br/>
 <br/>
I so wish to be close to these two people in my life, but their <br/>
negativity and emotional and energy draining behaviors are making it <br/>
next to impossible. I know this is there choice, but I am not sure <br/>
what my choices should be? Do I keep trying to brainstorm with them <br/>
in an attempt to &quot;convert&quot; them over to choice and freedom? Or do I <br/>
make the choice to give up these relationships?<br/>
 <br/>
Or are there other choices out there I may not be seeing?<br/>
 <br/>
Any words of direction, would be of great help here! :)<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for this thread Sandra, it has been a great source of <br/>
inspiration for me! :) I am thoroughly enjoying reading all of the <br/>
perspectives on this! It is so ironically funny to me how anytime <br/>
thee is something that I am grappling with in my life or the kids <br/>
are in their lives or just something that is a matter of interest to <br/>
me or my kids (i.e. when my middle son was taking interest in the <br/>
guitar, or egg hatching etc.) somehow, the same exact thing that <br/>
comes up in our lives here seems to pop up as a thread on one of the <br/>
many yahoo groups I am on! :)<br/>
 <br/>
So thank you Sandra and everyone! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197341305">Basically, I have choosen to give up on &quot;shoulds&quot; for others and <br/>
myself. I was counseled that &quot;you can not set boundaries for others, <br/>
you can only set boundaries for yourself&quot;. I am learning/practicing <br/>
this by being true to myself. If I really don&#39;t want to do something, <br/>
I say this or I negotiate for a common preference.<br/>
<br/>
I think by demonstrating/modeling setting boundaries for myself, <br/>
others will see and learn that they too have this option. For <br/>
example, I choose to only have consensual relationships in my life. <br/>
This, sadly, meant that I chose to avoid/remove my father from my <br/>
life. No ultimatums, just: it is my choice. However, my husband <br/>
doesn&#39;t believe that he &quot;has choices&quot; at times, but he doesn&#39;t impose <br/>
his choices on me. I choose to continue to model limit setting in our <br/>
life. And my husband is learning to do so also. Slowly, painfully <br/>
slowly. <br/>
<br/>
But he, of course, can continue to believe that he doesn&#39;t have <br/>
choices as long as they are not imposed on me (my boundary). I do not <br/>
impose freedom from &quot;shoulds&quot; on him, only he can choose to reject <br/>
this for himself. No matter how much I want it for him. Choice must <br/>
be intrinsically motivated, or there is no real choice.<br/>
<br/>
_Happiness is a Choice_ written by Barry Neil Kaufman of the Option <br/>
Institute is fascinating and empowering. You can find the Option <br/>
Institute on line. My husband is going to one of their seminars in a <br/>
couple of weeks. The book has been life/attitude changing already for <br/>
us.<br/>

<br/>
Depends what my relationship with them is otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is frustrating and I find myself distancing myself from <br/>

<br/>
I do that if they&#39;re going to keep on me about it. Then I might just stop <br/>
seeking out their company.<br/>
<br/>
In my life there are some people (like childless friends, I mean) who for one <br/>
reason or another will listen to me, and if they&#39;re being whiney or negative, <br/>
I can speak freely and say &quot;You could just look at it that way.&quot;  Or I can <br/>
make a joke.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I so wish to be close to these two people in my life, but their <br/>
negativity and emotional and energy draining behaviors are making it <br/>
next to impossible. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I have used my kids as an excuse (not an excuse, a really true reason) a <br/>
couple of times.  I&#39;ve asked two different people to be less  negative at my  <br/>
house, because we&#39;re trying to keep a really happy nest for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t really an &quot;If you don&#39;t mind&quot; situation, either.  The message was <br/>
&quot;IF you want to hang around here, or talk while you&#39;re here, it needs to be <br/>
more positive and optimistic.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It is frustrating when you feel that you have a wonderful epiphany of how<br/>
great life can be, and other people just seem blind. Then there are people<br/>
who take your friendship as license to make rude or judgmental comments to<br/>
you because your choices have been different. Relatives are harder. I am<br/>
incredible fortunate in that my dh is totally into it.<br/>
<br/>
I have had to sadly let go of at least one friendship because she started<br/>
saying mean things about homeschooling (let alone Un). Ironically it was in<br/>
the context of a conversation about her concern that the daycare place that<br/>
her then 2 yo was in, was pushing early academics onto him. I must have said<br/>
the wrong thing. Wish I could remember what it was.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I didn&#39;t turn around and say, &quot;I can&#39;t see you anymore, you&#39;re an<br/>
ass&quot; despite a strong desire to do so. I just haven&#39;t called her in a long<br/>
time. I can only assume she feels the same, since she has not called me<br/>
either. We live very different lives, despite both being mothers. I hope if<br/>
she ever genuinely wants a different take on education she calls me. Since<br/>
no ultimata were tossed around, that should be simple.<br/>
<br/>
The people who I have known for ever, as it were, are all back in Australia.<br/>
Most of them are alternative thinkers of one sort or another, and so are<br/>
very supportive of the whole idea. Gee, it makes me feel like sending an<br/>
email of gratitude to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332537274">Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I too understand what you mean.<br/>
<br/>
I have had so many epiphany&#39;s in life, mine and my children&#39;s in the <br/>
last year and a half and I do not always feel I can share them with <br/>
these two people in my life. <br/>
<br/>
One of these people is a friend whom I have just made in the lst <br/>
month. She is apart of the parkday I co-lead and it is a sense of <br/>
frustration, knowing that she has many exclusivity issues that are <br/>
not only effecting our friendship but that of the group I co-lead. <br/>
So I must strive to view this relationship from both a friendship <br/>
and leader perspective. I do not wish to exclude her, however, her <br/>
negativity and exclusionary behaviors are hurting people. So therein <br/>
lies my struggle. The challenges of my being a leader in the <br/>
homelearning community! :)<br/>
<br/>
The other relationship is one that I share with my husband. We have <br/>
been separated for 2 months now, and one of the meany issues <br/>
separating us in heart and in spirit is that of life learning <br/>
(unschooling). This is a relationship though he may not know it, I <br/>
cherish completely. But I feel very torn because he does not view <br/>
the children&#39;s lives as one of choice. He does not see the value of <br/>
life learning for what it truly is, despite my attempts to show him <br/>
the path. (Yes, Sandra he does have your site!:) I feel quite lonely <br/>
and sad at times not being able to share all the wonder and awe in <br/>
life, in being free for our children and us all to choose, in <br/>
unschooling with him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I feel very happy and blessed for you, that you have a husband that <br/>
embraces your views and supports you. I too long for this and am <br/>
searching for a way to have this with him. I do not know whether it <br/>
is possible but I am searching. <br/>
