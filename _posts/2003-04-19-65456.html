&gt; mentioned that we were unschoolers and got a few polite nods and<br/>

&gt; she was interested in learning more about unschooling.  It was<br/>

started going. There are more unschoolers now than when I started, but more<br/>
importantly, some people in the group have become very close friends for me<br/>
and my kids. After a while, the kind of schooling people do doesn&#39;t matter<br/>
as much as the level of respect they have for each other.<br/>
