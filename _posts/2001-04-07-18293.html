<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218753632">Sorry guys for cross-posting and so on, but I&#39;ve tried to let the <br/>
people who told me they were interested in the parenting skills <br/>
chat sessions know that I&#39;d organised them for Thurs and today, <br/>
now-ish, and no-one&#39;s there :-(  I can only assume that either no-<br/>
one&#39;s received the posts or no-one&#39;s actually interested.<br/>
<br/>
Whichever it is, can those who I have on my list let me know, <br/>
please?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Tracy</div>
