programs, but socialism seems like a fairly broad brush.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard various complaints from kids and parents and teachers about the <br/>
program.   But none of their complaints led to THIS conclusion:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Related to undermining the family with socialism... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some families suck.  <br/>
Socialized programs and services aren&#39;t going to hurt any existing, whole, <br/>
strong families.   <br/>
Kids whose families such could use some other input and assistance.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; classes actually increase drug and sex use.-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t talking about sex ed and to combine those two together smacks more <br/>
of religion and politics than of science or research.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly.<br/>
<br/>
I had an aunt of cousins a little younger than I was, and in the late 60&#39;s <br/>
she was all a-rant about sex education coming to the public schools in Colorado <br/>
Springs.  She wouldn&#39;t shut up.  She was organizing parents against it, noise, <br/>
noise, rant-o-rama.<br/>
<br/>
So she went to a meeting and heard the proponents of sex education speak.<br/>
For the first time, she actually heard their justifications instead of the <br/>
Nazarene and Baptist voices in her head.   And in an amazing turnaround, she <br/>
became a supporter and defender of the program, and a volunteer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Check out John Taylor Gatto and perhaps thousands of other writers on <br/>
this subject.<br/>
Because schooling is a great big experiment rather than the 3 R&#39;s is a <br/>
significant reason many people homeschool...and unschoolers in <br/>
particular.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

Some people may think my family &quot;sucks&quot;, and others may think yours <br/>
does.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And who decides who needs &quot;assistance&quot;????<br/>
<br/>
Read these two U.S. Supreme Court decisions for a quick easy read on the <br/>
primacy of the family:<br/>
State (WI) v. Yoder <br/>
Troxel v. Granville (2000) re hashes Yoder and ADDS strength<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How so?<br/>
<br/>
Check out Boston College&#39;s professor William Kilpatrick and his book Why <br/>
Johnny Can&#39;t tell right from wrong.  His book and further research at <br/>
the library or web should come up with plenty of resources.<br/>
The REASON mag source cited by mammaj2000 is excellent......<br/>

I would state that many &quot;sex ed&quot; teachers from the 60&#39;s would be <br/>
appalled at the &quot;modern&quot; curriculum.<br/>
Further,<br/>
People are convinced to make the wrong decision routinely...in all areas <br/>
of life...depends more on peer pressure or marketing than critical <br/>
thinking....</div>
