<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465270444">Hi, Everyone!  I know I have only been here for about a week, but I thought<br/>
I would introduce myself and my family now.<br/>
<br/>
I live in VA (Staunton) with Gary, dh of 28 years.  We have 7 children (6<br/>
living, as I mentioned earlier).  They are:  David, 24 yos, married, in TN,<br/>
expecting first child&#39;s birth in Feb.; Sarah, 22 yod, married, cosmetologist<br/>
for past 4 years, lives in our area; Martha, 20 yod, just returned to TN<br/>
where she is at college (her first year away, she did 2 yrs at com.col.);<br/>
John, 12 yos, who 6 mos. ago started taking baths before going  anywhere<br/>
girls will be present (he is a &quot;theater junkie&quot; and as the director told me<br/>
last night after rehearsal, is &quot;becoming hormonal.&quot;); James, 10 yos who will<br/>
wait on anyone, even his younger brother, is neat, organized, and has<br/>
&quot;always&quot; bathed regularly and dressed neatly (chooses to wear button-down<br/>
shirts and black dress shoes to church) - and he doesn&#39;t get up on stage or<br/>
talk very much;  and Joshua, 8 yos who is just getting into theater and<br/>
loving it.<br/>
<br/>
All 3 boys are in BSA and church choir - because they want to be there.<br/>
Last year John dropped out of both BSA and choir for a year, but this year<br/>
he rejoined.  He&#39;ll probably drop BSA again because that was not really his<br/>
desire - he thinks it&#39;s boring - but friends had talked him into returning.<br/>
He rejoined choir because over the summer at a musical theater camp he<br/>
finally believed that he can sing.  We have Nin64, PS2, GTA, cable, and the<br/>
boys sometimes stay up all night.  All of us frequently sleep in our<br/>
clothes - it&#39;s warmer, and there are no modesty problems with males/females.<br/>
Our house is &quot;lived-in,&quot; which means 20yod (a neatnik) considers it a<br/>
pigsty!<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I began homeschooling the older three children (they were in PS) in<br/>
1990, when John was 6 weeks old.  We began because we wanted more time with<br/>
our children, to get to know them, to be together.  Our Christian<br/>
&quot;conviction&quot; grew to believe that this is what God wants for our family, and<br/>
after 2 years we claimed religious exemption.  Within the first two months<br/>
of homeschooling, I would say that I became a relaxed homeschooler, and<br/>
stayed that way (with occasional twinges of doubt - too strict or not strict<br/>
enough?) until the older three graduated (all received GEDs - that&#39;s how<br/>
Sarah went to cosmetology school, but back then it was  required to have GED<br/>
or Accredited school diploma to receive Fed. Financial Aid, so they just<br/>
took the test.  Now it is legal, federally at least, to have a homeschool<br/>
parent prepare a diploma stating that their child has graduated).<br/>
<br/>
    For the past 2-3 years I have described myself to people who inquire as<br/>
&quot;very close to an unschooler.&quot;  I have read Holt and love what he had to<br/>
say.  I am probably more of an unschooler than I would admit to almost<br/>
anyone - except maybe you folks!  Not only are there very few unschoolers,<br/>
but not very many HSers I know describe themselves as relaxed.  I know many<br/>
in the Christian HS community across VA, and quite a few non-Christian<br/>
HSers, but almost none who unschool.  So this list (the first I&#39;ve ever<br/>
joined) is very interesting and educational for me.<br/>
<br/>
    Now,  I want to share something that I hope won&#39;t make you all either<br/>
hate me or fear me.  I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m a spy or something.  I<br/>
started at U.Va. this fall working on my Ph.D. in Social Foundations of Ed.<br/>
For my dissertation I want to interview HS graduates about their lives, how<br/>
the HSing affected them, what they see as important, how is HSing<br/>
benefitting them, their families, society?  I won&#39;t start the dissertation<br/>
until next year, but in the meantime I want to learn as much as I can about<br/>
different styles/philosophies/attitudes of HSing (and also Unschooling, as I<br/>
think this is really important).  I have known that there are considered two<br/>
disticnt threads of homeschoolers - liberal left and conservative<br/>
right(usually Christian).  I also know that many people do not fit these<br/>
often stereotyped definitions.  Last year I did a research project to<br/>
complete my masters, and I had planned to do a survey of homeschool<br/>
graduates.  Then I read (first with amazement, then with increasing<br/>
understanding) an article by the Kaseman&#39;s telling why some HSers don&#39;t want<br/>
to be &quot;researched&quot; or fit into nice, neat survey categories.  They even<br/>
criticized Mike Farris and HSLDA!  I was *shocked*, but then &quot;got&quot; their<br/>
point-of-view.  I know Mike, and I think he&#39;s done a huge service to all who<br/>
want the freedom to teach (or not teach) their children themselves, but I<br/>
don&#39;t agree with all that he says, nor with HSLDA&#39;s seemingly strong stance<br/>
on the high importance of academics! (Actually, when you know them/ talk to<br/>
them, the academics aren&#39;t always that important).<br/>
<br/>
    One thing the Kasemans did say was that qualitative study (case study,<br/>
family history, etc.) might actually be good for all HSers, and be okay to<br/>
participate in.  I learned about qual. research, did a fascinating study of<br/>
a local family that HSed their four boys between 1946 and 1961, and have<br/>
become hooked on the method, as well as hooked on the idea that this might<br/>
be important.  I will probably mention it more later and ask if any of you<br/>
think your adult children might be interested.  But no more now.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to more reading both here and on the sites,  books, and<br/>
videos that have been recommended.  For those of you who know Jacquie Ensign<br/>
or Will Shaw, they know me and would I think give me a good reference.<br/>
<br/>
Brenda Rose<br/>
<br/>
PS - I hope I&#39;ve used proper abbreviations and the * correctly.  I also wish<br/>
I had some really cool quote for the end of this, but I don&#39;t right now.<br/>
Oh, well... I sure like the others that I&#39;ve read.</div>

<br/>
There is some anti-HSLDA information online you might want to look at if you <br/>
haven&#39;t already (or sometime in your research).   <br/>
<br/>
Cafi Cohen (easily found because of having such a distinctive name) has lots <br/>
of teen contacts.  I&#39;m guessing you already know about Karl Bunday&#39;s list of <br/>
college which have accepted homeschoolers.  <br/>

<br/>
I enjoyed your intro letter.  I&#39;m a newbie to this list too but not to HSing.  I have three children ages 21, 10 and 8 and find I learn SO much from people like you and others on this list that have larger families.  Although I have only 3, having the big age gap between numbers 1 and 2 has given me something in common with larger families that have both grown and young children.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you or others on the list could help me with a concern I have right now.  This is a ways off, but in about a year and a half it looks like my oldest might be moving to Japan to teach English to Japaneese kids.  My second child, 10  1/2 years younger has a very strong bond with his older brother.  Son #2 recently grieved over the move of his best friend.  I realize that in a year and a half he will have a little more maturity to deal with life changes like this, but it will still be hard, as it will be for all of us.  So my question is, how have you and others in similar situations helped younger sibs deal with the move of a cherished grown sib FAR away from home?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Suzanne<br/>

Unschooling.com (But I&#39;m biased ;-) You get to see real live unschoolers in<br/>
action. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The message boards at Home Education Magazine held a wider variety of<br/>
homeschooling styles. They might still be in the archives but they tend to<br/>
scroll off after a while.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the Homeschooling Handbook and Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith<br/>
if you haven&#39;t read those. Both sites have book recomendations.<br/>
