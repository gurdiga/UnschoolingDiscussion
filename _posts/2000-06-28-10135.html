I joined this list (very briefly) b/c I thought I would be talking with<br/>
other folks about unschooling.  I must have joined something else entirely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068458674">hi jenny,<br/>
<br/>
i think all groups get stuck in their &#39;emotional eddies&#39; but it&#39;s my <br/>
opinion that it&#39;s more important that people be heard then it is to <br/>
hurry past a topic.   and when there are nearing 400 member <br/>
discussions are bound to take a bit of time and cover many different <br/>
points of view - many which are conflicting.  sorry you walked into a <br/>
discussion not to your liking but feel free to start your own topic - <br/>
i&#39;m sure people will jump in and have something to say.<br/>
