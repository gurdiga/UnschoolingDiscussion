<div>On September 19, EPIC and Privacy International (PI) released 
their<br>third annual Privacy and Human Rights survey.&nbsp; &quot;Privacy and 
Human<br>Rights 2000: An International Survey of Privacy Laws 
and<br>Developments&quot;, reviews the state of privacy in over fifty 
countries<br>around the world.<br><br>The report finds worldwide recognition of 
privacy as a fundamental<br>human right.&nbsp; Many countries around the world 
are enacting<br>comprehensive data protection laws to safeguard individual 
privacy.<br>Many of these countries, especially in South America, South 
Africa<br>and Central Europe, are introducing such laws to remedy 
privacy<br>violations that occurred under previous authoritarian regimes.&nbsp; 
Others,<br>such as in Asia, are developing information privacy laws in an 
effort<br>to promote electronic commerce.&nbsp; Others still, such as countries 
in<br>Central and Eastern Europe, are hoping to become members of 
the<br>European Union and are adopting laws based on the 1995 European 
Union<br>Data Protection Directive.<br><br>At the same time, both law 
enforcement agencies and private<br>corporations are extending surveillance 
powers through the use of new<br>technologies.&nbsp; The report notes that many 
of the recent threats to<br>individual privacy result from new Internet-based 
commercial services,<br>such as interactive television -- or &quot;SpyTV&quot; -- that 
record the<br>preferences of individuals.&nbsp; The report recommends improved 
oversight<br>and stricter enforcement of current laws to prevent such 
practices.<br><br>The report also argues that the United States government is 
leading<br>a multi-tiered effort to limit individual privacy and enhance 
law<br>enforcement surveillance powers.&nbsp; For example, on the domestic 
front,<br>it is promoting domestic laws such as the Communications 
Assistance<br>for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) that make it mandatory for 
all<br>companies developing telephone switching, cellular, and 
satellite<br>communications technologies to build in surveillance 
capabilities.<br>The government has also sought to limit the development 
and<br>dissemination of encryption products that protect individuals&#39;<br>private 
communications.&nbsp; At the international level, the report finds<br>that the 
U.S. has been vigorously promoting greater use of electronic<br>surveillance and 
pressurizing countries, such as Japan, into adopting<br>wiretapping laws.&nbsp; 
It has also been working through international<br>bodies such as the European 
Union, the Organization for Economic<br>Co-operation and Development (OECD), the 
Council of Europe and the<br>G-8 to promote surveillance and place restrictions 
on online privacy,<br>anonymity, and encryption.<br><br>&quot;Privacy and Human 
Rights 2000: An International Survey of Privacy<br>Laws and Developments&quot; by
