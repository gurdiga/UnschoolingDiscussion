<div id="ygrps-yiv-603350710">I picked up Seen and Heard : Teenagers Talk About Their Lives   by Mary<br/>
Motley Kalergis  at the Library a few days ago.  Even though  my kids<br/>
are still  very young, I thought it looked interesting.<br/>
I highly recommend it to anyone...parent, teacher, grandparent, citizen<br/>
ect....  I  wish teenagers were given more of a voice in this world.<br/>
It is a special book, and I wanted to share...<br/>
