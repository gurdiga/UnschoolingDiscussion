HHHHHUUUUUUUUGGGGGG<br/>
<br/>
You & I sound quite similar-I&#39;m always touching someone on the knee or <br/>
arm...(gee, wonder why my 6yo dd is a tactile learner...? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
We&#39;ve moved recently, too. (catch my intro, tonight--it may be midnight, but <br/>
I promise to post it)<br/>
I&#39;ve found an at-home-moms group (just became international) called <br/>
F.E.M.A.L.E. (Formerly Employed Mothers At the Leading Edge).  I&#39;ll look up <br/>
the chapters in Idaho for ya.<br/>
BTW: What is your e-mail address?  I have something for you! =:~&gt;<br/>

PS: tell your husband not to NAG, fine things take time...<br/>

Thanks for the sympathy.  However, I find it difficult to manage all my<br/>
stress relief, shoulder crying and comiserating, as well as all my<br/>
comraderie and sharing of mutual excitement and ideas, over the internet.<br/>
I don&#39;t know anyone in person who is &#39;like minded.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  I like to get together for tea with girlfriends while my kids are sleeping<br/>
(not happening) or go out to lunch together at a little cafe (not<br/>
happening) or have couples and single friends over for dinner and<br/>
conversation (not happening.)  I am also a very physically affectionate<br/>
person and I enjoy being tactile with people.  I like to hug my friends and<br/>
be close to them when we are talking and sharing.  But I don&#39;t have any<br/>
good friends here like that.  We moved too recently and I am too shy and<br/>
cautious with strangers in person.  The ladies in the Playgroup seem to be<br/>
maintaining their emotional comfort distance, and my husband is always<br/>
nagging me to make some better friends, as he knows I need them.<br/>
