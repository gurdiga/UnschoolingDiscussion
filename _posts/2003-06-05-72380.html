Funny thing is, we have a lock on the outside of Sierra&#39;s door. It could <br/>
leave the wrong impression. Dh put it there to keep babsy Jalen out, not to keep <br/>
anyone in. It has never, ever been locked when anyone was in the room, but I&#39;m <br/>
sure it looks rather suspicious now that I think about it!!<br/>
We have an old house and rather than replace her doorknob with one that has a <br/>
lock, he just stuck a little hook and eye at the top of her door. We can lock <br/>
kids out if we need to, so she can have a sane room without her dolls ripped <br/>
up. :)<br/>
