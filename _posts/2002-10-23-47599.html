<div id="ygrps-yiv-109345228">Here is the problem I encounter when considering whether something is<br/>
worthy of being reported.  I know from experience (working for social<br/>
services) that the conditions in foster homes is not always good,<br/>
sometime even horrific.  I also know, because I worked with them, that<br/>
social workers are as prone to bias and rashness as anyone else.  They<br/>
cannot always be depended on to use calm reason in making a decision<br/>
about what action to take.<br/>
<br/>
One doesn&#39;t have to work in the field to know how traumatic being removed<br/>
from the home can be for a child.  I always wonder if I would be causing<br/>
them to be taken from one situation to something worse.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I don&#39;t like spanking I think most children are better off in<br/>
this situation than being taken away and put somewhere that could be a<br/>
much worse danger.  Even if the foster home is a good one it&#39;s not worth<br/>
the trauma of being taken, not when it comes to spanking.  I guess as<br/>
long as flawed human beings are raising children we will have less than<br/>
perfect answers to the problems.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe, then, it&#39;s even more important that we talk to people who are spanking <br/>
in public.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could say &quot;I&#39;m not going to call social services, but if someone <br/>
else sees you and DOES call them, that will be bad.&quot;  or &quot;If you want to keep <br/>
this child, you need to treat her better.&quot;<br/>

I agree, Sandra.  I don&#39;t remember saying this to any strangers but have<br/>
warned a few folks I knew.  One friend would spank wherever they were and<br/>
I told her that if she kept it up she would be seeing CPS folks at her<br/>
door someday.  She stopped that practice.  If only she had taken my<br/>
advice to stop all together.<br/>
