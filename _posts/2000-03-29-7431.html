 Your post should have come with a disclaimer in Bold to the effect that <br/>
while <br/>
 this is a &quot;typical&quot; day for your family it&#39;s not what you&#39;d be doing every <br/>
 day and &quot;typically&quot; leads to exhaustion and a need for a restorative day. I <br/>
 envision some poor newbie mom out there who signed off the list convinced <br/>
she <br/>
 just doesn&#39;t have the stamina to &quot;do unschooling.&quot;  :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even the &quot;off&quot; days seem like a lot when you sit down and think about what <br/>
you did.  Heck, just getting them both dressed and to the store was a major <br/>
accomplishment today.  Some days are better than others -- whether we do much <br/>
or not.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494648137">Hi Deborah and all<br/>
<br/>
You said-<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think it&#39;s valuable <br/>
 to look at what is going on as a flow of days, some active, some <br/>
 contemplative, some bookish, some sleepy... &gt;&gt;<br/>
Yeah, I agree.  And I certainly hope I didn&#39;t scare anybody away.  That&#39;s why <br/>
I said in the beginning of my post that the afternoon I was doing all this <br/>
running I kind of wished somebody would ask me what my day was like.<br/>
I was probably boasting a little and boosting my own self a bit knowing that <br/>
I had gotten through that day!<br/>
So, I guess that was not my typical day...although as my kids grow and pursue <br/>
different interests, my days definitely are getting busier!<br/>
Loved your comments-<br/>
