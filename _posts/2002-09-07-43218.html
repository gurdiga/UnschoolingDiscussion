&gt; Sometime either today or yesterday, someone wrote a post discussing<br/>
&gt; Christianity and referred to two different men&#39;s names. One was Ezzo and I<br/>
&gt; think the other started with an F. I went back through all of today&#39;s and<br/>
&gt; yesterday&#39;s posts and couldn&#39;t find it. I wanted to read some on these guys,<br/>
&gt; so if anyone remembers the names, or if you wrote that post pleas refer me to<br/>
&gt; it! Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t get mentioned but Michael and Debi Pearl are (or were?) a big<br/>
influence in fundy circles with their Train Up a Child.<br/>

Here&#39;s a couple of things from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nogreaterjoy.org/subject1.htm">http://nogreaterjoy.org/subject1.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Q: Please give me a description of the switch or rod of which you so often<br/>
speak. I wish you could send me one so I could see it.<br/>
<br/>
A: The rod we speak of is a plumbing supply line that can be bought at any<br/>
hardware store or large department store. It is a slim, flexible, plastic<br/>
tubing that supplies water to sinks, and toilets. Ask for &quot;1Ž4 inch supply<br/>
line.&quot; They cost less than one dollar. I always give myself one swat before<br/>
I swat the child to remind myself how much force to exert. It stings the<br/>
skin without bruising or damaging tissue. It¹s a real attention geter.<br/>
Michael demonstrates its use in our new Seminar videos.<br/>
<br/>
Mistraining at Three Months<br/>
  <br/>
One of the young mothers in the church tells how she trained her<br/>
three-month-old daughter to cry and whine to be picked up and held. Upon<br/>
seeing her parents start to drift into another room, the baby cried out. The<br/>
father responded, ³Get little Suzy, she wants to be with us.² Mother picked<br/>
up Suzy, and she spread her beautiful smile in delight. Well, that¹s the<br/>
real life story of how Suzy was trained to whine. She initiated an act,<br/>
whining, to which the mother responded by picking her up. That was the first<br/>
day of a lifelong habit.<br/>
<br/>
She will refine her technique, employing more threats and spreading more<br/>
misery. She will eventually fall on the floor, kicking her feet and<br/>
screaming. The mother will be embarrassed in public, frustrated and angry at<br/>
home, and will eventually have such contention and strife between her and<br/>
her demanding daughter that she will write a letter to us wanting to know<br/>
how to deal with an angry, undisciplined and unthankful teenager.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We could start an email campaign to HEM. But, HEM isn&#39;t just for Unschoolers. <br/>
HEM is a really cool inclusive magazine. There are adds for curriculum, <br/>
schools, etc. So even though I wouldn&#39;t choose that for my family and <br/>
obviously you wouldn&#39;t either, there are some that would. OTOH, I suppose we <br/>
could equate this to smoking adds. Remember when the adds were banned from <br/>
lots of magazines because of the contribution of the adds to smoking? Well, <br/>
we could say the adds for this series contributes to child abuse. I.E. People <br/>
see the add, people buy the books, people read the books, people take the <br/>
books to heart, people smack their kids with plumbing tubes. <br/>

<br/>
Today at a thrift store there was an old (50&#39;s) ashtray, and a matching <br/>
ceramic cigarette lighter, made to go on a coffeetable.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I were looking at it, and I told her that when I was a kid, it was <br/>
very common for school arts & crafts projects to be us all making ash trays <br/>
for our parents.  She was surprised.  She has only lived in a time when <br/>
smoking was wrong and bad and NOT to be encouraged.<br/>
