<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391192885">Cleaning out old documents and I found something I wrote but never sent <br/>
anywhere, I don&#39;t think. I thought those of you with younger children <br/>
might especially appreciate it:<br/>
<br/>
I Just Don’t Want to Mess Up My Child!!<br/>
<br/>
The big secret to being happy with yourself, as a parent, is to focus <br/>
on the little moments. Don&#39;t be constantly worrying about the future, <br/>
but REALLY enjoy each age and stage and respect and honor the child as <br/>
he is right now. Easy to say, but this is so much harder for most of us <br/>
than it sounds.<br/>
<br/>
Let your child teach you how to parent her. Think of yourself as a <br/>
learner. Your child knows perfectly well how to be exactly what she is <br/>
right now; you’re the one who needs to intellectualize because you are <br/>
carrying around all kinds of baggage. Many of your reflexive responses <br/>
to her are likely to be bound up in unexamined societal expectations <br/>
and in duplication of or reaction to how you were, yourself, parented.<br/>
<br/>
So, work on being reflective instead of reflexive; put yourself in your <br/>
child’s place as much as you can. Practice seeing the world from his <br/>
point of view and you&#39;ll realize that he wants to grow up capable and <br/>
competent and successful in his own way and that he wants to have good <br/>
relationships and to feel good about himself. And, you’ll know just how <br/>
much he wants you to support and encourage and help him.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, what your child really needs is for you to recognize and <br/>
celebrate the shining beautiful spirit within her because how her <br/>
parents see her, when she is a child, is very possibly how she&#39;ll see <br/>
herself for the rest of her life.<br/>
<br/>
The rest is just details!<br/>
