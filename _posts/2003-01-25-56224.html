&lt;&lt;     Where exactly is the Bible Belt? I&#39;m guessing Ohio is in it. ;-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ohio&#39;s not, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Texas, Oklahoma, on across the south to South Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
Kentucky and Tennessee are in.<br/>
<br/>
Ohio and Pennsylvania are not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m doing this from a guess and personal experience of people saying it,  <br/>
haven&#39;t looked at anyone else&#39;s official estimation of its borders or any <br/>
&quot;definitions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Southern Florida is probably not included, being so heavily Jewish and <br/>
Catholic these days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480155266">Thanks now I know where never to move to. LOL! It&#39;s just so much of this<br/>
sounds so familiar. I left a church as they were starting to do some of<br/>
these &quot;Parent Classes&quot; I just couldn&#39;t stomach it and I grew up in a baptist<br/>
church. I know where some of it came from for me. I spanked when my oldest<br/>
was very young. I didn&#39;t know the options to pull out of that bag of<br/>
&quot;tricks&quot; yet. Yuck! I&#39;m glad it&#39;s been gone out of my life for good. Now<br/>
it&#39;s getting even better & better. ;-)<br/>

The best preparation for the future is a happy today :-)<br/>
