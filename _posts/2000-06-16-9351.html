Hey, that was my idea too.  But the older 3 are grown and gone and the<br/>
&quot;baby&quot; is 12 (and 5&#39;10&quot;).  &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

&quot;It is every kid&#39;s birthright to <br/>
grow up with something to get over; it teaches them flexibility, <br/>
generosity and humility.&quot; - - Diana Sandberg</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078914547">That&#39;s what we did.  Hubby was born in Mass, spent a few years in Arizona<br/>
and So. Cal and other parts of CA but had never done more than travel<br/>
through the Bay Area.  Saved like crazy so that we could really do it up<br/>
right and spend a few days.  Even managed to spend a night in the<br/>
Claremont!  The kidlets loved it.  We did the whole tourist thingy with<br/>
Alcatraz, the restaurant that turns, Fairyland, Tilton Park and on and on<br/>
and on.  I even managed to not get us lost.  Not bad when one hasn&#39;t lived<br/>
somewhere since they were 12!<br/>

I&#39;ts a small small world...or country, as the case may be.  Isn&#39;t it funny how folks from the San Francisco Bay Area always refer to it as &quot;Home&quot; no matter how long they have been away?  It just gets in your soul and won&#39;t come out.<br/>
