<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462799668"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi everyone. I am relatively new to the ideas of unschooling but have been<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trying to practice for half a year now and am enjoying. My question today is<br/>
about my almost 11 yr olds interest in modeling. She gets people telling her<br/>
that she shoudl be a model all the time becuase she is so tall (5&#39;2&quot;) and<br/>
she is very pretty.<br/>
<br/>
I know nothing about modeling, but keep in mind that she may well not be a<br/>
tall adult.  When I was 11, I grew 6 inches, to 5&#39;6&quot;.  Then puberty arrived,<br/>
and I never grew again (other than sideways).<br/>
