<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577562590">Michele, I apologize if you&#39;ve already told us but: what state are you in?<br/>
Regulations vary, but there will either be someone here who is familiar with<br/>
your state laws, or will know where to direct you.<br/>

&gt; I sent in my enrollment form to &quot;teach&quot; my 11 year old. I was told it<br/>
&gt; was not complete. They want more specifics - table of contents, etc. -<br/>
&gt; for basic communication skills. They also sent a letter saying that I<br/>
&gt; had to have my son in public school until this is completed. He is very<br/>
&gt; upset and so am I about this. I guess it sounds simple to people who<br/>
&gt; have been unschooling for years. I don&#39;t understand why I have to be so<br/>
&gt; specific if I am unschooling. I feel like they are asking too much. I<br/>
&gt; told them I wasn&#39;t sure yet what curriculum I would be following so they<br/>
&gt; said they would send me a sample. I feel like I am lying to them because<br/>
&gt; they are making me say things I don&#39;t want to say in order to be allowed<br/>
&gt; to unschool my son. It doesn&#39;t feel good. I can only imagine what I will<br/>
&gt; go through for my 14 year old with dyslexia in order to unschool him. I<br/>
&gt; feel so anxious about the whole thing now. Michele </span></blockquote></div>
