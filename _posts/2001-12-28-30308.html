&gt; but then I start feeling like he needs to learn, or should I say, do <br/>
&gt; academics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Read. Keep reading - here, unschooling.com, Grace Llewellyn&#39;s books, John<br/>
Holt&#39;s books. Immerse yourself in unschooling, so that it starts to seem<br/>
natural - it is natural, but people have been telling you your whole life<br/>
that it won&#39;t work, that you must force academics or kids won&#39;t learn<br/>
anything. You know in your heart that that&#39;s not true, but you worry...<br/>
<br/>
When you find youself worrying about your son not doing &quot;academics&quot;,<br/>
stop, take a breath, and read some more Holt. Try not to pass your<br/>
anxieties on to your son - he&#39;s probably got enough of them after<br/>
spending so long in the system. Tell him that we think he&#39;s doing fine,<br/>
and whatever he chooses to do is right for him. He can&#39;t fail anymore,<br/>
there is no failure here. <br/>
<br/>
Invite him to try some stuff out. Read the paper, bring up some of the<br/>
things you find - maybe spelunking, an improv group, a museum showing.<br/>
Talk about your passions - if you can&#39;t think of any, develop some.<br/>
Nurturing your own passions is important, you&#39;re modeling this for your<br/>
son. Ariel Gore once said, &quot;Children deserve interesting parents.&quot; Do<br/>
your &quot;thing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when I worry, I remind myself that a 14 yr old can learn K-8<br/>
math in 6 weeks without too much trouble. &quot;Academics&quot; don&#39;t take anywhere<br/>
near as long as the schools spend on them. I think of an unschooled 11 yr<br/>
old I know, who had done pretty much nothing at all academic and had<br/>
actually just learned to read the year before. He ended up having to go<br/>
to school for 5th grade - long story, but he spend 3 months working with<br/>
a tutor and then entered 5th grade and did great. <br/>
<br/>
If your son says he wants to read but find it difficult now, maybe he<br/>
needs new things to read. How about Mad magazine, Calvin and Hobbes,<br/>
Larry Gonick&#39;s History of the Universe?<br/>
<br/>
Have you joined a support group? Is it the right one? I&#39;ve noticed that a<br/>
lot of the younger kids seem to look up to pre-teen and teen boys in some<br/>
of the groups we&#39;ve joined. Maybe it would help him to interact with kids<br/>
who have never been to school, and maybe slightly younger kids would be<br/>
less intimidating than kids his age. <br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635454378">Thank you very much Dar and Kolleen! I&#39;m sorry but the name of the book I&#39;m reading is The Liberation Handbook. I probably confused you earlier. It is so SENSIBLE.<br/>
I have spoken to my son. I know exactly what he wants to do and has for years, computer programming. I told him today that I&#39;m leaving him in charge of what he wants to do, and he chose another programming course. He has always taken academics very seriously and the last two years in ps left him feeling very inadequate and not knowing why. He read a book called The End of Homework about a year ago and told me to also. I did. He then asked me to let him homeschool. He told me that he just did a lot of busy work at school and couldn&#39;t see why he needed to do stuff he already knew. I chuckled at first, but I&#39;ve always admired him for seeing the big picture and always made so much sense. Since we found that he had trouble with focusing and was inconsistent in his math, forgetful and always was, etc. we had him tested and diagnosed with ADD. I wonder about these labels too, and it doesn&#39;t exactly make him feel much better, but he says if they can give him something to take care of the concentration problem, fine. I have always seen him as a very intuitive, bright boy and we have always had a very good, open relationship. He feels he can talk to me and does, so I feel quite lucky.<br/>
We have found a hs group just recently, and my younger son, 12, is enjoying it, but there are no real teens my 14yo son&#39;s age. I think if he found other boys who don&#39;t attent ps, it would be good for him. He&#39;s quite mature for his age so 12yo&#39;s may be on a different level than what he would choose. I am going to continue to work to find other kids his age and take care of his lonliness he says he has. I honestly think this has been a big adjustment for him and he doesn&#39;t feel right about not attenting ps. Hopefully, time will change that.<br/>
I will have to get those Holt books, as I&#39;ve been meaning to for quite some time. Homeschooling should be more relaxed than it has been so far, worrying about if we covered this, covered that. In MA, we have to be able to show documentation such as progress reports at the end of each year and I don&#39;t know how to do that if we unschool. <br/>
Thank you again very much. I am starting to see the light finally.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790874480">Hi Debbie,<br/>
My oldest dd is 15 and imo it&#39;s harder for the teens to get together. <br/>
In our case, dd has met friends through her dance and gymnastics <br/>
classes. Also, the internet happens to be a &#39;hangout&#39; for kids that I <br/>
know. They create these elaborate webpages and other kids surf in on <br/>
them (I can&#39;t quite grasp how they network but anyway...). While I <br/>
advocate safety for teens on the net and using extreme caution, dd <br/>
has met some nice friends (but not IRL ones) this way.<br/>
Once your son finds outside interest that school would have otherwise <br/>
prevented him from doing or attending, he&#39;ll probably meet other guys <br/>
who have similar interests. Perhaps he&#39;ll meet a mentor-type person <br/>
who&#39;s not the same age but it won&#39;t matter! <br/>
I won&#39;t say that the social life of a hsed kid is the same as a ps <br/>
kid.... the kids I know are vastly different. Having said that, I <br/>
think the hs situation is preferable over the other one because the <br/>
kids are able to effectively communicate with a wide range of ages. <br/>
AND, best of all, they learn to feel comfortable with themselves.. <br/>
all alone, doing solitary activities and not feeling dependent on <br/>
someone else.<br/>

You are right. And he has found friends on the internet with similar interests so that is good. Some are much older but he learns a lot from them, and I appreciate the fact that they are willing to do that for my son. He is quite mature for his age, so it makes it easier for him to talk to other older people who share his interests. <br/>
One thing I&#39;ve noticed since he&#39;s been home is he is more relaxed, and he and his brother do get along better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404985234">In the elementary grades, there&#39;s less emphasis on speed and grasping <br/>
things quickly than in  middle and high school. The pace picks up <br/>
quite a bit. So, in your son&#39;s case, it&#39;s probably safe to say that <br/>
he&#39;s been able to cover up his inability to comprehend for quite some <br/>
time.  Now that there&#39;s this diagnosis, he&#39;s bound to be upset.  <br/>
Maybe he&#39;s angry/frustrated that he struggled for so long and nobody <br/>
ever realized it or figured it out. Maybe he&#39;s gotten into more <br/>
detailed material so that covering up is now impossible and he&#39;s <br/>
feeling defeated.  (I don&#39;t know... just making assumptions based on <br/>
my friend&#39;s son who also had the same problem).  In my friend&#39;s case, <br/>
her son began taking a medication (don&#39;t know which one but it was <br/>
akin to a mild sedative) and within three weeks, he experienced <br/>
positive results. Further, more detailed diagnosis was done and it <br/>
was determined that he could do the work when not put under the <br/>
normal time constraints.  *Maybe* by being at home your son will <br/>
learn to relax without the medication (that is probably a bad choice <br/>
of wording)... I&#39;m trying to say that your son may not need <br/>
medications (then again, he may) but at least try <br/>
unschooling/deschooling before drugs. There are side effects and <br/>
concequences to the drug route and you may very well be able to avoid <br/>
that if given time.<br/>

of your son could be a description of mine.  &lt;g&gt;  And, while he hasn&#39;t been <br/>
diagnosed, I&#39;m more and more sure that he *is* ADD.<br/>
<br/>
You say your son is keen on programming.  Is he very far along that <br/>
path?  My son has expressed an interest, but I have no idea how to get him <br/>
started.  (I started learning programming in 1970, never finished the <br/>
course, and it&#39;s *way* different now.)  Do you think your son would have <br/>
some ideas to help mine get started?<br/>
