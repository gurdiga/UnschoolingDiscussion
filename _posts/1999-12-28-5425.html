<div id="ygrps-yiv-367206859">Sorry all this doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with unschooling (though many <br/>
will argue that everything does), but the reason I&#39;m posting this on here is <br/>
because I know there are many on here with chronic diseases.  I went to the <br/>
doctor last week with many many symptoms and he told me it was probably just <br/>
mild fibromylgia (would hate to see severe) but ran some test anyway.  My ANA <br/>
titer came back a high positive.  Doctor said he was surprised, he was <br/>
expecting all tests to be normal.  Anyway does anyone here know what diseases <br/>
this might indicate.  Before the test we were concerned that it might be MS, <br/>
but now think it&#39;s probably lupus, there&#39;s a family history of lupus too.  My <br/>
doctor doesn&#39;t seem to think I fit the criteria, though my mom, who&#39;s an RN <br/>
does.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone here knew of any other diseases that <br/>
an abnormal ANA test might indicate.  And do people with MS have abnormal ANAs?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance,<br/>

My oldest daugher and myself are going to be guests on the Oprah Winfrey <br/>
show. Can you believe it?? I have one of the producers coming here tomorrow <br/>
with a camera crew to tape a segment for the show. Then my daugher and I are <br/>
flying to Chicago on Sunday and taping a show on Monday and flying back <br/>
home. I&#39;m still in shock over the whole thing. It&#39;s all happened so fast. <br/>
The show is about how I watched a show and came to a realization about me <br/>
and my teenage daughter and how what I do affects her. It&#39;s all about self <br/>
esteem.<br/>
<br/>
Cool huh??<br/>

Yes, it was the show that had Jamie Lee Curtis on showing how she posed in <br/>
some magazine with no makeup and lets just say a much less than perfect <br/>
body. It was all about self esteem and the image we have of ourselves as <br/>
women. I&#39;ll let you know when it&#39;s on. Not sure how far ahead they tape <br/>
these things.<br/>

My (almost) sister in law and I were on Oprah in 1997.  It was so much fun to go everywhere by limo and stay in the fancy Omni hotel.  Our topic was a show about road rage......my brother was murdered in &#39;96 by a guy whom he argued with on the side of the road.  Sad topic but a really neat experience to get to go to Chicago and tell our story.  <br/>
<br/>
Just don&#39;t count on visiting with Oprah herself.  She doesn&#39;t visit with the guests at all before or after the show.  I was quite disappointed.  I had taken my cookbook to get autographed (that was when her book with her chef had just come out) but never got the chance.  The only time we had contact with her was during taping of the show.  <br/>
<br/>
Have a great time and take lots of pictures!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946044660"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I can&#39;t walk the dog because she pulls so hard. She actually caused me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>great pain.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help with the training part, but you might want to get a Halti.<br/>
There are a couple of other brands as well.  In fact we have a different<br/>
brand.  I just can&#39;t remember the name of it.  It&#39;s lasted better than the<br/>
Halti.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the Halti goes around the muzzle so the dog feels the pull on the<br/>
side of the mouth rather than the neck - kind of like a horse halter but not<br/>
*in* the mouth.  Dogs don&#39;t really mind the pulling around their neck.  In<br/>
fact they&#39;ll just keep pulling and choking and pulling and choking.  But<br/>
they *hate* the pressure on the side of the mouth.  So they don&#39;t pull.<br/>
With the Halti on, I can just move the leash to one side and he&#39;ll turn<br/>
instantly.  He doesn&#39;t pull at all after the first minute or so.  They cost<br/>
around $20 Canadian, so maybe $14 US.<br/>
