 GOD USED A TOOTHACHE<br/>
 <br/>
 Friday morning I was reading the paper and noticed Darrell Scott (father of<br/>
 Rachel Scott, a student who was killed at Columbine High School) was coming<br/>
 to<br/>
 speak Sunday afternoon at Two Rivers Baptist Church in Nashville.<br/>
 <br/>
 I really wanted to go hear what Mr. Scott had to say but was a little<br/>
 apprehensive about announcing anything to my youth group about the event<br/>
 since<br/>
 it was going to be held at a Baptist church.  I had a feeling someone would<br/>
 get<br/>
 offended if I promoted it.  So, instead of any announcement in the main<br/>
 worship<br/>
 assembly, at the end of my Sunday school class I made mention of the event,<br/>
 told<br/>
 my high school kids I&#39;d be going and invited anyone to ride with me who<br/>
 wanted<br/>
 to go.<br/>
 <br/>
 I expected to take two or three kids in my truck.  Instead I ended up having<br/>
 to<br/>
 fire up the White House Church of Christ van as 11 of us made the short trek<br/>
 to<br/>
 Two Rivers.<br/>
 <br/>
 I wish I could have recorded the looks on the faces of everyone we passed in<br/>
 the<br/>
 parking lot at Two Rivers as our van, with all its Church of Christ<br/>
 lettering,<br/>
 motored to a resting place.  Shock.  Disbelief.Happiness.  I&#39;d be a rich man<br/>
 if I had a dime for every person I saw mouthing the words, &quot;Church of<br/>
 Christ??????&quot; as we passed.<br/>
 <br/>
 I guess we broke traditional protocol, but we had a face-to-face meeting<br/>
 with<br/>
 God we would never have had if we hadn&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
 The service was unbelievable.  Just five short months after the April 20<br/>
 tragedy, Mr. Scott shared the &quot;untold&quot; stories from Columbine, the stories<br/>
 the<br/>
 liberal media may never tell, the stories he has dedicated every waking<br/>
 moment<br/>
 of the rest of his life to sharing.  He talked at length about the 12<br/>
 students, including his daughter Rachel, who left this world on April 20.<br/>
 <br/>
 Of the 12 students who died, eight professed to be Christians.<br/>
 As Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris (the two gunmen) came down the hill behind<br/>
 the<br/>
 school to begin their assault, their first target was Mark Taylor.  At the<br/>
 very<br/>
 moment bullets pierced Mark&#39;s body, he was witnessing to two of his friends<br/>
 about his relationship with Jesus Christ.<br/>
 <br/>
 They next turned their guns on Rachel.  Three weeks earlier Rachel had<br/>
 witnessed<br/>
 to Dylan and Eric and warned them about the violent video games to which<br/>
 they<br/>
 seemed to be addicted.  Their first shot hit Rachel in the leg.<br/>
 A second plowed through her backpack into her midsection, knocking her to<br/>
 the<br/>
 ground.  One of the gunmen walked over to where Rachel lay face down, still<br/>
 alive.  He pulled her up by the hair of her head and asked, &quot;Do you still<br/>
 believe in God?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;You know that I do,&quot; Rachel managed to reply.<br/>
 <br/>
 Immediately after her reply a bullet entered her temple.<br/>
 <br/>
 Mr. Scott shared the story of John Tomlin, another victim.  John had been on<br/>
 mission trips to Mexico and was hungry to do more.  During each school day<br/>
 he<br/>
 decided to do something small in hopes it might cause someone to think about<br/>
 spiritual things.  He left his Bible open in the dash of his truck.<br/>
 <br/>
 At 4 a.m. one morning after the tragedy, Mr. Scott looked around as he was<br/>
 beginning an interview with NBC&#39;s Maria Shriver and noticed a circle of<br/>
 people<br/>
 around John&#39;s truck, talking about the Bible in the dash.<br/>
 <br/>
 Mr. Scott spoke of his son, Craig, who escaped death after looking down the<br/>
 barrel of a gun.  He escaped because his friend crouched next to him in the<br/>
 library, Isaiah Shoels, was black and a more desirable target for the two<br/>
 gunmen<br/>
 who hurled numerous racial slurs and putdowns in his direction before<br/>
 killing<br/>
 him execution-style.<br/>
 <br/>
 Cassie Bernall&#39;s story has received more national attention.  She too<br/>
 answered<br/>
 the gunmen&#39;s question of &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; in the affirmative, taking<br/>
 a<br/>
 bullet after her response.  A national &quot;She Said Yes&quot; campaign has resulted<br/>
 from the statements she and Rachel made, looking down the barrel of a gun.<br/>
 <br/>
 Rachel&#39;s funeral was broadcast in its entirety on CNN.  Millions of viewers<br/>
 tuned in, making it the highest-rated broadcast in network history.  With<br/>
 millions of eyes tuned to the broadcast, Bruce Porter brought the message,<br/>
 asking &quot;Who will take the torch?&quot; referring to the torch Rachel, Cassie,<br/>
 John,<br/>
 Mark and others had dropped.<br/>
 <br/>
 At that very moment a young man in Texas had a gun to his head, ready to<br/>
 take<br/>
 his own life.  As he listened to Porter&#39;s plea and thoughts that followed,<br/>
 he<br/>
 lowered the gun from his head, began to cry and prayed for forgiveness.<br/>
 <br/>
 Not long ago he ran 1,000 miles from Little Rock, Arkansas to Washington,<br/>
 D.C.<br/>
 with a torch in his hand.<br/>
 <br/>
 Needless to say, by the end of the service I had been on an emotional roller<br/>
 coaster. My shirt had a hefty salt deposit in it from the tears I had shed,<br/>
 but<br/>
 I left the service encouraged, excited and ready to share the &quot;untold&quot;<br/>
 stories with anyone I could.<br/>
 <br/>
 We all climbed back in our van and headed back to White House.  We were<br/>
 going to<br/>
 be just in time for Sunday night services.  I kept thinking on the way back<br/>
 how<br/>
 much I would have loved to share with the congregation that night just a<br/>
 tiny<br/>
 bit of what we had experienced at Two Rivers that afternoon.  I was a bit<br/>
 discouraged because I didn&#39;t know how long it would be before I was in the<br/>
 pulpit again and had a chance to share.<br/>
 <br/>
 As I walked in the door, two minutes before services were to begin, one of<br/>
 our<br/>
 elders pulled me aside and asked, &quot;Has anyone said anything to you about<br/>
 speaking tonight?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;No,&quot; I said.<br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;Well Keith (our preacher) has a bad toothache.  He&#39;s not going to be able<br/>
 to<br/>
 speak.  I guess we&#39;ll just have a song service....&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;Please let me speak,&quot; I butted in.  &quot;Something happened to me this<br/>
 afternoon<br/>
 I&#39;ve got to share.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;Okay, you&#39;re on,&quot; he said.<br/>
 <br/>
 During the opening moments of the service I prayed fervently that God would<br/>
 use<br/>
 my words to help someone realize their need for Jesus.<br/>
 <br/>
 As I began to share some of the stories previously mentioned in this email,<br/>
 I<br/>
 felt a peace and strength I have never felt before.  It was not me talking<br/>
 up<br/>
 there.  Even though I had zero preparation for this &quot;sermon&quot; my words seemed<br/>
 to<br/>
 flow like never before.  Everything was coming together.<br/>
 In sports terms, I was &quot;in the zone.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 I pleaded with the young people who had never committed their lives to Jesus<br/>
 to<br/>
 do so.  I told them they didn&#39;t have to know everything at first.<br/>
 That&#39;s what being born again is all about.  Starting new.  I encouraged<br/>
 those<br/>
 who had given their lives to Jesus before and didn&#39;t have him at the center<br/>
 of<br/>
 their lives to make it right.<br/>
 <br/>
 As I stepped down from the pulpit with the words of &quot;Just As I Am&quot;<br/>
 resonating from the walls, I knew something special was about to happen.<br/>
 <br/>
 A teenager came forward, then an 8-year old boy, then a mother, another<br/>
 teenager, and another, and on and on.....<br/>
 <br/>
 Three came to commit their lives to Jesus for the first time and be<br/>
 baptized.<br/>
 Several others came to recommit their lives to Jesus.  They came largely<br/>
 because<br/>
 of the stories associated with 12 young people from a tiny town in Colorado.<br/>
 <br/>
 It only occurred to me about an hour later as I sat in Subway eating a<br/>
 sandwich<br/>
 there was something special about the number of people who had responded at<br/>
 church that night.<br/>
 <br/>
 There were 12.<br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his<br/>
 friends.<br/>
 You are my friends if you do what I command.  I no longer call you servants,<br/>
 because a servant does not know his master&#39;s business.  Instead I have<br/>
 called<br/>
 you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known<br/>
 to<br/>
 you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear<br/>
 fruit - fruit that will last.  Then the Father will give you whatever you<br/>
 ask in<br/>
 my name. This is my command: Love each other.&quot; - John<br/>
