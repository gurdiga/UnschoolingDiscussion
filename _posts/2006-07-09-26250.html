<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649125067">Ren&#39;s post really spoke to me How many times did my kid ask me for <br/>
something and I just forget about it because I don&#39;t think it is that <br/>
great of an idea but when they find someone else who is willing to do <br/>
that thing with them (half-witted as I see it).  That make a bond with <br/>
that other person and is an opprotunity that *I* missed out on.<br/>
Missed out on biulding a bond, on hanging out, on bringing some joy to <br/>
someone else,  and maybe some fun for me,  all because it didn&#39;t <br/>
*seem* like a good idea when first pitched to me.<br/>
How many time have you been out with friends doing &quot;nothing much &quot; but <br/>
made lots of fun memories???<br/>
<br/>
Oh I will be thinking of this post for a while and hopefully be able <br/>
to fain enough interest in something to get me out and doing.<br/>
<br/>
Try it you might like it my mom was right! thanks Ren<br/>
