<div id="ygrps-yiv-242505165"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;This interesting because in our house it&#39;s just the opposite.  Robin&#39;s <br/>
&gt;&gt;friends can all swim with their heads under the water, but he can&#39;t. Their <br/>
&gt;&gt;parents say it&#39;s due to swimming lessons.  I say (and so does Robin) that <br/>
&gt;&gt;he will get it when he&#39;s ready to swim.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good for Robin! Of course he will get it. Both of my kids were &quot;late&quot; <br/>
put-their-heads-under-the-waterers. ;-) Conor took early lessons, Casey <br/>
didn&#39;t. They both swim just fine. Right now Casey likes diving and Conor <br/>
doesn&#39;t. He&#39;ll get that too when he needs and wants to.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
