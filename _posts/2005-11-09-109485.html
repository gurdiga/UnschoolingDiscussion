<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240734427">I actually have a bumper sticker that says &quot;I can&#39;t go to school, I&#39;m <br/>
autodidactic.&quot;  They probably make t-shirts too.  My van is in the <br/>
shop now so I can&#39;t look where I got it from but I will let you know <br/>
when I get my van back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756608971">I thought of a comeback for kids to use to other kids.   <br/>
<br/>
One could say something like &quot;Yeah, but I can go to school later if I want <br/>
