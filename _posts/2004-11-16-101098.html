Okay, scratch that about inclusives....I see it was Pam who used the term  <br/>
first, and I know she doesn&#39;t think inclusive means unschooling!<br/>
 <br/>
I think they writer did a lot of research (how else could he find a guy who  <br/>
uses the bible to advocate slavery?), but except for the one shining moment of <br/>
 Pam&#39;s comments and the rejoinder about Girl Scouts, the rest was just more <br/>
blah  blah blah to me.  <br/>

<br/>
The Bible verses pro-slavery are a major part of any civil war discussions, <br/>
and a (minor) part of the history of the Southern Baptist Church.  I thought <br/>
everyone knew those were there.  But then I&#39;m a trivia and oddity hound and when <br/>
they told me to read the Bible I actually read it, and when they told me to <br/>
ask anything I wanted, I actually asked.  OOps. &lt;g&gt;   They meant ask any <br/>
simple, inane, non-probing questions.  And they meant read the parts of the Bible <br/>
that always get quoted, or just say you read it but don&#39;t really read it, or if <br/>
you do, don&#39;t really think hard, as you&#39;re not qualified.<br/>
<br/>
I learned a lot being Southern Baptist.  It made me pretty disdainful of <br/>
Baptists.  If anyone finds something in scripture that seems crazy, they&#39;ll <br/>
dismiss you by saying unless you can read Hebrew and Greek you&#39;ll easily <br/>
misinterpret things.  Yada yada indeed.<br/>
<br/>
The platform, the bedrock, the basis of much of &quot;Christian Homeschooling&quot; <br/>
(not freeform homeschooling by a family that happens to be Christian) contains <br/>
some ugly old stuff.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve never heard it.<br/>

&gt; I think the writer misunderstood &quot;inclusive homeschooling groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had quite a few conversations with him and unschooling was not the <br/>
topic - it was all about what Rob Reich and Michael Apple were saying <br/>
and my response to that - they believe homeschoolers should be <br/>
regulated - that they should have to &quot;sign up&quot; as homeschoolers (so <br/>
that they can be counted), follow a curriculum of some kind that makes <br/>
sure they are taught beliefs different from those of their parents, and <br/>
be tested to make sure they&#39;re learning.<br/>
<br/>
I debated Rob Reich last April at the American Educational Research <br/>
Association annual meeting in San Diego. The reporter got hold of a <br/>
tape of that debate and some of what he quotes me as saying was pulled <br/>
off that tape - so it is accurate, but  a little awkward, out of the <br/>
context of it being a response in a debate to something said by Reich.<br/>
<br/>
Scott Sommerville of HSLDA and Brian Ray of NHERI were also in the <br/>
debate.<br/>
<br/>
The audience was composed of people doing research or funding research <br/>
in education - who were there because they had an interest in <br/>
homeschooling research. I expected a relatively hostile audience, but <br/>
was pleasantly surprised to discover that they were not.<br/>
<br/>
Reich made a big point about how &quot;we don&#39;t know&quot; so many things about <br/>
homeschooling because research is difficult because homeschoolers are <br/>
not regulated. &quot;We can&#39;t even get an accurate count,&quot; he kept saying. <br/>
He made it clear he wanted homeschoolers to be regulated because <br/>
otherwise it was too hard to do research on homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I made the point that it wasn&#39;t right to regulate us in order to <br/>
research us - that this looked like a solution in search of a problem, <br/>
rather than an existing problem needing a solution. I told the <br/>
researchers there that we had fundamental rights to privacy and to <br/>
raise our children in freedom, but they did NOT have a fundamental <br/>
right to research us. There was a lot of head-nodding and a sense of <br/>
understanding in the room.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Rob Reich - what is the problem you want to solve by regulating <br/>
us? He said, &quot;We can&#39;t tell if there is a problem if there is not good <br/>
data.&quot; I said, &quot;So, just in case there might be a problem, even though <br/>
we don&#39;t see any indication of one, you want the government to step in <br/>
and exert control over our family lives (impose curriculum and <br/>
standardized testing), to make it easier for you to analyze us to see <br/>
if you can FIND a problem?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - that was the gist of the debate.<br/>
<br/>
Rob Reich is so concerned that our kids won&#39;t be good citizens because <br/>
they&#39;re being raised to be &quot;ethically servile&quot; to their parents beliefs <br/>
- by which he means that kids come out of homeschooling incapable of <br/>
even considering the possibility that others&#39; beliefs, different from <br/>
those of their parents, might have some validity.<br/>
<br/>
Brian Ray and Scott Sommerville approached the debate more from a <br/>
&quot;these are our rights&quot; point of view. My approach was more from a &quot;I <br/>
understand the desire to research us because I think we&#39;re interesting, <br/>
too, but you can&#39;t justify regulating us in order to do your research, <br/>
that&#39;s not even good research technique (changing and damaging the very <br/>
thing you&#39;re trying to study); you have to find ways to do the research <br/>
without changing the very nature of what we do.&quot; That was the only <br/>
context in which unschooling came up, because I gave the example of how <br/>
requiring standardized testing would so warp the way my kids&#39; learning <br/>
happened and explained why requiring a curriculum and standardized <br/>
testing would not be a minor inconvenience. I pointed out other options <br/>
to the researchers there (Rob Reich is NOT even a researcher, he&#39;s a <br/>
philosopher) such as in-depth interviews and case study approaches, <br/>
that would allow better understanding of all the variety of <br/>
homeschooling, rather than statistical approaches which are based on <br/>
finding commonalities in a set of data and generalizing from them.<br/>

If he&#39;s been reading The Home School Digest I can see why he would believe <br/>
that.<br/>
It&#39;s the full intent of those parents to do that.<br/>
If their children grow up believing in cultural diversity and the acceptance <br/>
of other religions, they will have failed miserably.<br/>

<br/>
If you were teaching them to obey you as you obeyed your husband, you&#39;d be <br/>
quite clear that it&#39;s not okay for children to question parents.<br/>
<br/>
If you were homeschooling against your own wishes out of obedience to your <br/>
husband, you&#39;d be unlikely to entertain any disbedience to you from children, <br/>
and that&#39;s just the way it would be.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s the way it is with hundreds of thousands of Christian <br/>
homeschooling families. (Maybe only thousands of the moms were told to homeschool without <br/>
it being their idea.)<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right. I wonder how much of that not questioning is just external, though. I wonder if the folks who live that way believe that they have the total of their children&#39;s minds just because they&#39;ve been so successfully at molding outward behavior?<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe they do have their children&#39;s minds, through scare tactics or threats of hell?<br/>

TELL them, but I won&#39;t vote to send government inspectors to their <br/>
houses and MAKE them think the way I think people should think.<br/>

<br/>
I just want you to know that I went to the meeting as part of the <br/>
audience and was invited to be part of the panel itself as I walked in <br/>
the door - so I had ZERO time to prepare. I&#39;d thought about the issues <br/>
a LOT and engaged in the same debate online - with Rob Reich himself <br/>
and had talked about it with Scott Sommerville, in advance, too. So I <br/>
can&#39;t say I was unprepared - but I had no notes - of course I had no <br/>
chance to be nervous, either! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This year&#39;s meeting is in Montreal - I WISH I could have gone back <br/>
again, but that was an impossible trip.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was very useful to the people there to hear the perspective <br/>
of homeschoolers who are not HSLDA-based and I wish that they were <br/>
getting that this year. Maybe next time. Influence educational <br/>
researchers is important, I think. Down the road, schools end up being <br/>
run in accordance with whatever research happens to be in vogue at the <br/>
time. I like to hope that our unschooling experience can make schools <br/>
at least a little better experience, since most kids are going to <br/>
continue to go to school.<br/>
