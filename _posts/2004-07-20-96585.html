<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769461924">Being the innocent child that I am, and being raised and still living <br/>
in the country as I do, the image of shoes on the wire made me think <br/>
of a movie we have called &#39;Big Fish&#39;.  For those who haven&#39;t seen it, <br/>
there is a whole segment in the movie where the main character walks <br/>
to and finds the town of Spectra.  In Spectra, there&#39;s a little girl <br/>
that takes people&#39;s shoes and throws them up on the wire so they <br/>
can&#39;t leave.  Guess there&#39;s all sorts of reasons for having your <br/>
shoes on a wire!</div>
