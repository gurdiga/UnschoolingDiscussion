<div id="ygrps-yiv-600215503">That is pretty cool, and I read even &quot;correct&quot;...um, right...even the <br/>
first time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to test this sentence on a less-than-expert reader...just a <br/>
sec...my 10 year old boy...he sailed through it, having a prob only <br/>
with the word &quot;rest&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In fact, he came in and started reading it aloud, and got to letetrs <br/>
before stopping and saying &quot;It&#39;s all wrong&quot; LOL<br/>
<br/>
so, my boy must be more of an expert than I thought...hmmm, who is <br/>
less than an expert around here? But they would have to be a READER, <br/>
not a pre-reader or barely beginning...<br/>
<br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought: we read it with very little difficulty because we <br/>
are readers, but wouldn&#39;t a newspaper article or college paper look <br/>
pretty strange, if not stupid, with jumbled spelling? <br/>
<br/>
Yet another thought: that goes to prove that being a proficient <br/>
reader equates to being a speller, because at least here, my 10 year <br/>
old knew that the words were misspelled, even though he&#39;s never had a <br/>
spelling lesson in his life. <br/>
<br/>
interesting, indeed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213052967">Jason (14) rattled it off no problems but suddenly came to a grinding halt when he realised that the spelling was all wrong lol.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I see the Target Word puzzle in one of our newspapers over here (it has a large letter in the centre of a grid and 8 letters around the large letter - you have to make words using the big letter in each, plus find the 9 letter word) - um what was I saying?  Oh yeah, the Target Word puzzle - I get the nine letter word right off.  Maybe my eyes just happen to pick out the first and last letters and the rest just sorts itself out in my brain without me &#39;thinking&#39;.  It&#39;s weird because I can pick up the paper sometimes and take a glance down at the puzzle and just blurt out the nine letter word.  Cool.  Other times it takes me much longer.<br/>
<br/>
Would it work for unfamiliar words??  Not one that I can self test because once I&#39;ve seen the word I want to test on it&#39;s no longer unfamiliar lol.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note - Megan the 7 yo does online chatting quite a bit.  One of her online friends said &quot; LMAO&quot;  Megan wanted to know if it was Spanish - lmao &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910412420">One of the reasons we can read that sentence is context, too. The <br/>
target word puzzle you describe...some I get, some I completely and <br/>
absolutely CAN&#39;T GET...because those words are separated from <br/>
context, out there all on their own without anything around them.<br/>
<br/>
The sentence...I read it without a hitch. <br/>
