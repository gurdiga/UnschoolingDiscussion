<div id="ygrps-yiv-962825514">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone here is doing good. Wow, this list has been busy, I have lots <br/>
of reading to do.<br/>
<br/>
We left home unexpectedly to be with mom as the doctors told us she had maybe <br/>
3 days to live. 3 days turned into 3 weeks. We stayed by her side the entire <br/>
time. At the end she went 10 days without food or water. It had to be the <br/>
hardest thing that my family and I have gone through. Now she rests in peace.<br/>
<br/>
I came home and my computer crashed. I lost everything on it. I am looking <br/>
for a woman here named Gail. Her daughter was talking with our son about <br/>
photography before we left unexpectedly. Gail, can you have your daughter e-mail him <br/>
again or e-mail me with your addy? I&#39;m so sorry he never responded to her but <br/>
we lost everything when the computer went. <br/>
<br/>
Off to do the one thing I missed most......read!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your mother and wish you peace during this <br/>
difficult time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have Brenna e-mail your son again.  She&#39;s been carrying her camera <br/>
around with her everywhere and planning on getting some of her pictures today.  A <br/>
friend had a old Nikon<br/>
telephoto lens laying around the house and gave it to Brenna a couple of <br/>
weeks ago.  She was so excited and now has her regular lens, the macro we gave her <br/>
for Christmas and the telephoto.  Cool stuff!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy catching up on your reading and take care of you,<br/>
<br/>
Gail<br/>
