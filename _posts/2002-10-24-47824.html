<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613184005"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am 34 and still<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feel like there is a lot for me to learn. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I am 53 and still feel like I can never grasp all, in this lifetime,<br/>
that I wish I could! . . . it is a constant work in progress . . .<br/>
parenting is the most complex and rewarding task on my personal path - and<br/>
I am grateful for all those who have helped me along the way . .. including<br/>
those on this treasured list.<br/>
Aloha,<br/>
