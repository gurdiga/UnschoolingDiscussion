Maybe carry stationery for &quot;I told you so&quot; notes.  Ask them to write down <br/>
their concerns, and seal them and date them. You can both initial the <br/>
envelope.  Put a date on it, like 2010, and tell them to open it then, and if <br/>
they were right to call you right away and you&#39;ll apologize profusely.   And <br/>
if, when they open it, it turns out they were wrong, there&#39;s no need for them <br/>
to call and apologize to you at all.<br/>

<br/>
My in laws are the worst when it comes to stuff like this. They have never <br/>
asked us about any decisions we&#39;ve made about our lifestyle, they just <br/>
criticize. They can&#39;t understand or more simply, just don&#39;t want to. I can <br/>
handle people not agreeing with me all day long, but not vocally criticizing <br/>
me for decisions they know nothing about. My SIL who works in the public <br/>
school system is adament about making her kids go to college whether they <br/>
want to or not. In her words, you can&#39;t be a success without college. I&#39;ve <br/>
sat through 13 years of this and pretty much kept my mouth shut when I <br/>
realized no one really cared why we made the decisons we did, just that they <br/>
weren&#39;t what we should do according to them. It wasn&#39;t worth the arguments <br/>
that ensued. Keeping quiet didn&#39;t make it go away. Now I simply stay away <br/>
and so does my husband. Just wasn&#39;t worth it. I&#39;m happier and therefor so is <br/>
my family!<br/>
<br/>
Now of course my husband is having a change of heart. We just buried his BIL <br/>
and he wants to take another crack at his family. If he feels like there is <br/>
a chance, I&#39;m willing to do so. But I won&#39;t be keeping quiet this time.<br/>
<br/>
If the opinions are just their strongly stated ones, I&#39;d keep quiet and let <br/>
them talk. If it gets personal and judgemental, I&#39;d say something. Something <br/>
like saying you disagree and then asking if they would really like to know <br/>
why should do the trick.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rant. Sore spot.<br/>

I would ask myself, &quot;Why does this bother me? Why am I having a hard <br/>
time just letting this slide off as I let other things slide?&quot; The pin <br/>
prick reaction is worth looking at deeper. <br/>
<br/>
It might help to think of people having different communication styles <br/>
too, even the grown ups. ;) Some people seem to need to quantify and <br/>
to have benchmarks that are &quot;common&quot; ones easily identifiable by a <br/>
majority of the population. Your own benchmarks could be seen as more <br/>
subtle and not so &quot;common&quot;. We all define success in our own ways. <br/>
Homeschoolers and Unschoolers also do things worth bragging about or <br/>
thinking about for the future.  <br/>

<br/>
It can be awful. But, if it is REALLY awful I would suspect that there <br/>
are some underlying power issues going on. Lunch line at the cafeteria <br/>
isn&#39;t the only place the pecking order surfaces. Family gatherings <br/>
are favorite stomping grounds for this. You can catch the ball and <br/>
throw it back, or you can just let it roll right past you. You don&#39;t <br/>
have to play if you don&#39;t want to. And not playing someone else&#39;s game <br/>
can be a very powerful move.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875504617">How old are your kids?<br/>
When Dylan was younger we got this a lot from my husband&#39;s sisters.  <br/>
But as he got older their concerns and interference lessened.   Still,<br/>
every once in awhile I get some question about his education, but for the<br/>
most part they have all relaxed.   One sister in law (the one with no<br/>
children) was still sending me &quot;educational&quot; news when she read it, about<br/>
how well public school kids were doing or how great some ps program has<br/>
been, etc.   Even this seems to be on the decline after I e-mailed her a<br/>
list of John Holt titles and told her how really glad I was to find<br/>
someone in the family who shared my interest in education.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Offer to loan them your big fat John Taylor Gatto collection or some<br/>
other intimidating looking library of alternative education material and<br/>
tell them you&#39;re just DYING to talk to someone else who&#39;s read it.   <br/>
<br/>
Or just serve some bad eggnog and wave goodbye, cheerily. <br/>

into active aggression.<br/>
<br/>
My parents went from passive to active aggression over an issue.   I wrote <br/>
them a letter saying that I was sorry about the choices they had made and <br/>
that they needed to change if I was going to come back into their lives.  It <br/>
was the best thing I had ever done up to that point in my life.  And it <br/>
worked.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, now you have a government agency involved and she has put your <br/>
family at great risk.  My situation was nothing compared to this.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know anything about your relationship with your mother or about you, but if <br/>
it were to happen to me, that&#39;s what I would do.  <br/>
