<div id="ygrps-yiv-428065855">In our house, we open Christmas presents with a big family celebration, late<br/>
at night Christmas Eve. The older set goes to midnight mass, (after the<br/>
exchange of presents and a super fattening dessert), then the younger ones<br/>
go to bed in new pj&#39;s given by grandma. Santa comes in the early morning and<br/>
leaves small presents (wind-up toys, pens, scented soap, special<br/>
chocolates), and always an orange in the stockings.  When ever I think about<br/>
these family gatherings I smile and can almost smell the pine and oranges!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even though Santa is not a prominent feature at our house, my husband and I<br/>
never discouraged stories about him.  One of my favorite childhood books is<br/>
our &quot;T&#39;was the Night Before Christmas,&quot; that I received on MY first<br/>
Christmas - I still love to look at the drawings! <br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was 8 (she&#39;s almost 11 now), she began reading Judy Blume<br/>
books.  I think it was the SuperFudge book that the main character revealed<br/>
that Santa was not real.  My daughter was very thoughtful after reading<br/>
that, and then asked me what I thought was going to be the BIG question<br/>
about Santa.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, she wanted to know &#39;&quot;But what about Rudolph??!!&quot;  And she would<br/>
say, &quot;Hmmmm, I really wonder, if reindeer would continue to fly without<br/>
Santa?  If I could fly, I&#39;d do it all the time! Yep, I&#39;m sure they fly<br/>
anyway!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it IS fun to believe or fantasize.  She wants to keep that magical<br/>
part of childhood intact awhile longer.  She doesn&#39;t want to be told about<br/>
reality when it comes to Santa or the reindeer.  She loves to tell and write<br/>
stories, and she has two smaller brothers (7 and 3) who lap up every word. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But even in a family, there are always the realists -- Her brother was asked<br/>
when he was 4 if he would like to go with Grandma and have his photo taken<br/>
with Santa.  He said, Heck no, he&#39;d wouldn&#39;t like to sit on some weird guy&#39;s<br/>
lap who&#39;s dresses up in a costume!<br/>
<br/>
All the kids laughed and laughed!  No one was offended by his take on Santa.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think that part of unschooling is just embracing all the stages without a<br/>
negative eye, and all the personalities.  As a parent I really TRY to do<br/>
that, but it is difficult sometimes.  Trust that your children will tell you<br/>
in one way or another, their stage.  Also, as a parent I&#39;ve learned that I<br/>
set the stage for my family&#39;s core values, but that my &#39;stage&#39; is just one<br/>
of many choices available to my children.  Some of the traditions will<br/>
remain with my kids as they mature - some will change or be discarded.  I<br/>
hope the family gatherings and the decadent desserts remain!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So, I say don&#39;t sweat it - a little fantasy about Santa isn&#39;t going to ruin<br/>
your reputation as an &quot;honest&quot; parent.  Your everyday actions will have a<br/>
larger impact.  I have friends who were terribly bothered by their parent&#39;s<br/>
&#39;lies&#39; about Santa.  But, then again, lots of things about their upbringing<br/>
bother them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Gosh! I&#39;m almost in a December frame of mind.  What cooling thoughts on a 98<br/>
degree day!<br/>
