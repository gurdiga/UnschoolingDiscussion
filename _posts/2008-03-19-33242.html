#1, nothing was attached.  Actually that&#39;s good.  (I mean it was  <br/>
probably cut off by the group settings.)<br/>
<br/>
#2, this is not a political list, so what was on the news isn&#39;t our  <br/>
ASAP concern.  Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
#3, I&#39;ve put the poster back on moderation.<br/>
<br/>
#4, this list is for discussing unschooling and how our children  <br/>
learn.  It&#39;s not for just anything in the whole wide world.<br/>
<br/>
#5, some people justify funneling all kinds of stuff to unschoolers  <br/>
because &quot;everything is unschooling.&quot;  Making connections to  <br/>
interesting things can be good for unschooling, but each of you  <br/>
reading this is probably a few inches from a link you could click or  <br/>
a search bar you could write &quot;news ASAP&quot; into and read all KINDS of  <br/>
horrifying, terrible things.  I assume those who are interested in  <br/>
craziness in the world and the scare tactics of action groups have  <br/>
already found sources for those.<br/>
<br/>
The things I don&#39;t think are sufficiently about unschooling, I&#39;m  <br/>
putting here:<br/>

<br/>
#6, the only thing worse for this list than &quot;Fwd:&quot; is &quot;Fwd: FW: FW:  <br/>
PLEEEEEASE READ!!!!&quot;<br/>
If something isn&#39;t worth cutting and pasting and writing a comment  <br/>
about to explain WHY it was so important to bring to this group, then  <br/>
it&#39;s  not worth bringing to this group.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, the owner, who thinks there are enough posts here, not trying  <br/>
to set a record, just trying to stay on the topic of natural learning  <br/>
and unschooling and the parenting that promotes those<br/>
