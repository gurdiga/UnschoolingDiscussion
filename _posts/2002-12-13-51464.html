<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004588067">OK so I have a tactful and hopefully mature question.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to do the &quot;he said, she said&quot; thing so I&#39;m not using any names.<br/>
If a poster states that &quot;I can truthfully say we don&#39;t have any rules&quot; and<br/>
in the same post states &quot;the kids have to pick up before they watch TV&quot;, are<br/>
those two statements mutually exclusive?<br/>
<br/>
Is picking up before watching TV for &quot;parental convenience&quot; or &quot;living for<br/>
principles, not rules&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
We do have rules at our house.  The rule is you must respect others, period.<br/>
And sometimes that is very much a parental inconvenience and it also means<br/>
that my house is not as clean as I would like it to be.  And it also means<br/>
that my kids help clean when they choose, but do pick up after themselves<br/>
usually.<br/>

toys are not lost or broken, so mold doesnt start to grow on dishes.    And, <br/>
I have to say, its not like a daily thing. .. Its more like. OK guys, we cant <br/>
walk in here, there is no where to sit down.. You need to get this stuff up <br/>
before the TV comes back on.   .. Or.. OK, Ethan, you&#39;ve been playing that <br/>
game ( on the PC) for 2 hours, JP wants to play, you can find something else <br/>
to do or let him play with you. ..or maybe, JP, I need to finish my homework, <br/>
you can play again when Im finished. .. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83904367">Well, since you asked why no one responded to you about this :o) I went and pulled it<br/>
from my drafts folder...I had written this yesterday, but it got late and wasn&#39;t sure it<br/>
was going to make sense...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it is truly for family convenience, then why do you need the punishment if<br/>
it is not done (the tv will not be turned on unless it is cleaned up)? If <br/>
the family felt that it was an inconvenience, wouldn&#39;t the family choose to clean<br/>
it up? <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe a different option would be to ask how you would ask your husband...<br/>
&quot;hey guys, we can&#39;t walk in here, can you help me clean it up?&quot; and work with <br/>
them to get it straightened up. I know that if my husband came in and said,<br/>
this place is a mess, no computer time until you get it cleaned up&quot;, I would<br/>
have a few choice words for him (and it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;sure honey!&quot;, more along the<br/>
lines of, if you think that it is messy, feel free to clean it yourself!). I also<br/>
will admit to having asked Jason if he could help me pick up the floor before<br/>
we play a board game. But that is because there is no place for the board game if<br/>
we don&#39;t and I have also explained to him that mommy can&#39;t concentrate and enjoy<br/>
the game if surrounded by a complete mess. If he does not help me, then I just pick<br/>
things up myself, but for the most part he does help because it goes faster and it<br/>
is more fun  because we are doing it together.<br/>
<br/>
If you are happy with doing things the way you are doing them. Great. Please don&#39;t<br/>
take my advice as saying that you *must* do things this way. But rather that there<br/>
are other options that don&#39;t involve threats or punishments. This has been<br/>
one of the best things that I have learned after being on this list for several <br/>
months now, there are always other options.  I am able to look at my interactions<br/>
with my kids and see things from their perspective easier. This has been hard at <br/>
times because I have seen some areas where I have not been as respectful to them<br/>
as I had always thought that I was. Because my parents talked to me that way and <br/>
most of my friends talk to their kids that way. And it is accepted and even promoted<br/>
in parenting books and mags. Some may think that it is extreme, that it is no big deal to<br/>
say that the room must be cleaned before the tv is watched. And it probably works in <br/>
the short run. But I keep coming back to how I would feel if someone held that kind <br/>
of power over me.<br/>
<br/>
You may not agree with me. That is fine. But there are more respectful ways to deal<br/>
with the situation you talk about above. And that is what the ladies here are <br/>
wonderful at pointing out. Because it may not be obvious at first. You may not<br/>
even see it as a problem. If it is not, then don&#39;t take the advice. If it is, <br/>
then you have another option to try. That is all that is being offered here...options.<br/>

Just other options....<br/>

It&#39;s not too painful at all to clean during commercials, if it&#39;s a tv show, <br/>
or to clean during credits and previews if it&#39;s a video.<br/>

That is one of my favorite ways to clean (during commercials), it just <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem as painful somehow. You always get to stop as soon as the show <br/>
comes back and the job is automatically broken into little manageable bits.<br/>
When I ask the kids to help me with something they&#39;ll often say &quot;can&#39;t we do <br/>
it during commercials&quot;. It works well for them too.<br/>

&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t work in this house. My kids watch the commercials more than the <br/>
actual show!!!!<br/>
Of course that would be more cleaning time wouldn&#39;t it??? Or maybe not!<br/>
