I&#39;m going into Amazon.com tonight to make sure they have them, because that <br/>
seems to be where she orders them from.  Also then I can get brief overviews <br/>
of the books myself.  So off to the library again tomorrow on my mission.  <br/>
This turned out to be much easier than I thought it would be (LOL)<br/>

We have a very special deal for our librarian friends - our best <br/>
discount, free sample issue, freebies for their vertical file <br/>
systems, etc., etc. We *LOVE* libraries, and about 20% of our <br/>
subscription list is public libraries, who almost always renew, so we <br/>
must be doing something right! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They can get in touch with us at 1-800-236-3278 or <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HEM-Info@...">HEM-Info@...</a> or visit our website: <br/>

<br/>
As far as books, my favorite general all-purpose recommendation is <br/>
Linda Dobson&#39;s &quot;Homeschooling Book of Answers.&quot; It covers all the <br/>
bases from several different perspectives.<br/>

While you&#39;re giving them a list of books, why not give them copies of your<br/>
favorite homeschooling catalogs. That way they may be able to find even more<br/>
homeschooling books that interest them and the catalogs can be kept as a<br/>
resource for other homeschoolers.<br/>

Am I missing something?  Why is Amazon.com offensive?  Was that a joke or <br/>
have they done something or are doing something to promote something that I <br/>
would find offensive?  <br/>

It was a joking reference to the usual story about a big, evil company<br/>
trying to take over the world by losing lots of money year after year as it<br/>
tries to put everyone else out of business. If they succeed, there will be<br/>
no longer be companies willing to mail out paper catalogs, to accept orders<br/>
by mail, fax or phone, or to answer questions about specific products.<br/>
<br/>
As an independent bookseller, I am admittedly biased, but you can read my<br/>
personal rant on the subject at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444578331">Interesting article... I&#39;ve never looked at it that way.  I buy my British <br/>
Murder Mystery Books from 2 independant bookstores.  Clues Unlimited in <br/>
Tucson, which I can actually visit and M for Mystery in San Francisco, <br/>
California, that I can order from on-line.  I guess it would be good to <br/>
support the &quot;regular&quot; independant bookstores as well.  However I don&#39;t know <br/>
of many of them around anymore.  Isn&#39;t it Barnes and Noble, Borders and <br/>
Amazon.com now?<br/>
