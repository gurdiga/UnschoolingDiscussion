<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812647616">All right! There is one now ... it&#39;s called UnschoolGrads (there was already<br/>
a HomeSchoolGrads - but it&#39;s for Christians who were in a particular program,<br/>
apparently).  <br/>
<br/>
-Thanks for the rapid reply.<br/>

&gt;  Hello,<br/>
&gt;  Is anyone aware of any mailing lists or discussion groups for =<br/>
&gt;homeschool graduates?<br/>
&gt;  I am a former homeschooler (now adult), and would like to meet others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Thanks!<br/>
