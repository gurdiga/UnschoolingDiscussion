 </span></blockquote>or a good beer!!  I<br/>
never drank much...probably less than once a<br/>
week....the reaction <br/>
gradually<br/>
grew worse over the years until I had a very scary New<br/>
Years after one <br/>
small<br/>
glass of Champagne a few years back.  Anyone ever hear<br/>
of such a <br/>
reaction?<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to look it up and I can&#39;t seem to get much.<br/>
The &#39;experts&#39; <br/>
say<br/>
there isn&#39;t an allergy to alcohol and it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
matter what kind <br/>
it<br/>
is...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
This would not surprise me in the least. In my own<br/>
HUMBLE opinion, and I am NOT a medical doctor nor do I<br/>
ever plan to be... alcoholism is related to an<br/>
allergic response to sugars, yeast, and alcohol, aka<br/>
Candida. I say this having been on a strict<br/>
anti-candida diet until childbirth, then eating &<br/>
drinking everything for 12 years: (sugar, cheesecake,<br/>
red wine, yum yum) while running a low grade vaginal<br/>
yeast infection that SUDDENlY with no warning turned<br/>
into a major one, and both of them being very<br/>
responsive to changes in diet. Also I&#39;ve had all of<br/>
the other symptoms of candida, one of which is<br/>
dizziness, various symptoms mimicking alcohol<br/>
intoxication. The medical community is a long way from<br/>
acknowledging any relationship here, but they cannot<br/>
convince me there is none, I know differently.<br/>
<br/>
I have found, re everything, that everyone has<br/>
different tolerances for different substances (both<br/>
legal, illegal, organic, and chemical) and the only<br/>
way of knowing what is best is trial & error. In<br/>
general I feel children should be allowed to grow to<br/>
adulthood before experimenting with substances,<br/>
prescribed or otherwise, but I have found great<br/>
benefit from prescribed medications.<br/>
