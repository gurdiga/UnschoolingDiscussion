It&#39;s lovely here in Nova Scotia. Probably a bit colder<br/>
and snowier in winter than you are used to. You&#39;d get<br/>
used to it :-)<br/>
<br/>
Land is still inexpensive in many parts of the<br/>
province as long as it is not waterfront.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412325099">Well I had three home births, can vax or not it&#39;s up to me, homeschooling is sooo OK, and there is Organic food every where.  Organics must be certified as organic meaning the land has to be chemical free for at least six years and there is a lot of paperwork.  It costs much more $2.00 for regular eggs compared to $4.00 organic unless you know the farmer. <br/>

I live in Alberta and the laws and regulations change from Province to Province so you would have to look at each province separately.  I know some of the smaller Eastern Provinces have different laws regarding home Ed and Birth.<br/>

Moved out to a little town three years ago so the kids and I could be more relaxed.  Now we are trying to decide what to do.  Would like to start an intentional community, dh would like to make more cash so we can break even plus a little for fun which might mean going back to school.

 </span></blockquote>Vax are optional, at least in BC.  Midwives are covered by our medical plan,<br/>
but they&#39;ve been saddled with a lot of unnecessary regulations.  There&#39;s a<br/>
lot of politics around all that right now.  My daughter had one homebirth<br/>
before midwives were licensed, another with a licensed midwife, and another<br/>
where they called the midwife half an hour after baby was born.  &lt;g&gt;  I<br/>
don&#39;t know too much about the regulation of organics here, but I know there<br/>
are certification groups.<br/>
Tia<br/>
ps I find it ironic that you asked these questions.  My daughter&#39;s first and<br/>
favourite midwife is Heather Hall.  &lt;g&gt;  My Heather was so disappointed when<br/>
that Heather moved away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058262064"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;What kind of choices do you have for vax, home birth,  and organic food<br/>
&gt;&gt;regulation etc?<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Vaccinations are optional in the UK although not here in VA. None of my <br/>
kids are vacccinated. (Some of you may remember thesaga of trying to <br/>
emigrate to the USwith 3 unvaxxed kids...). Various of them have had <br/>
measles, whooping cough and rubella although I can&#39;t remember which.<br/>
<br/>
Organic food - I only eat organic, especially now I&#39;m pregnant. I know <br/>
too much about what herbicides and pesticides do to the body and to the <br/>
fetus. Having said that, we do eat out about once every 5 months or so. <br/>
I also eat organic to avoid genetically modified foods. Can&#39;t understand <br/>
why food isn&#39;t labelled here in the US. Any food containing GM <br/>
(including in restaurants) is labelled in the UK. Labelling gives <br/>
consumers choice and it alarms methat the drug companies and food <br/>
companies are lobbying to prevent food being labelled.<br/>
<br/>
As for homebirth. I&#39;ve been to 6. It wasa wonderful experience. Knocks <br/>
the socks off the interferenace etc at the hospital. I&#39;m planning a <br/>
homebirth with number 4 :-) Problem is, here in VA, finding a <br/>
independant midwife is almost impossible and Obs would rather have teeth <br/>
pulled than attend a homebirth. I haven&#39;t been able to find an OB to <br/>
support me through a VBAC after 3 ceasareans as it is.Luckily enough, we <br/>
are moving back to the UK before the baby is born and despite a few <br/>
attacks on homebirth, it is easy to do in the UK and a midwife and <br/>
doctor must attend you by law if you so request :-)<br/>

You can find out right here! My kids were making a<br/>
joke of putting apple stickers on the computer to<br/>
change it from what it is to a Macintosh. That evolved<br/>
into plastering the monitor with all fruit stickers.<br/>
The organic fruits have exactly the same number as the<br/>
non-organic except with a 9 in front. I think we use<br/>
the same numbers and system here as in the US to make<br/>
it easier.<br/>
