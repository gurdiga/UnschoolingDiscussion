<div id="ygrps-yiv-544774262">I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to help Jason (6 yo) deal better with his<br/>
frustration about not being able to do things on the first try. This happens quite a bit,<br/>
most often with video games but also with other things, like writing and now basketball.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, I just try to hold him when he is melting down and we talk about lots of things<br/>
that mommy was (is) not good at and how as you get older you are better able to do things, <br/>
sometimes just because you are older and sometimes because you have more experience.<br/>
I let him back off if he does not want to try (like not making him write like my dad<br/>
wants me to do), but sometimes he does not want to back off and just keeps getting<br/>
upset. If it is a video game, I will try to help him get past the point where he is<br/>
stuck, but sometimes like yesterday with that danged Lego Racers 2 game I couldn&#39;t<br/>
do it either.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what I am looking for, but maybe also ways to help me keep my patience too...<br/>
I try really hard, but sometimes it can be hard. Like when he was melting down at <br/>
11pm the other night because he was too tired but refused to go to sleep and when <br/>
he starts getting mad at *me* because I can&#39;t give him the answers...he did this <br/>
yesterday when the tips I found online did not help him get past the point he was at.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that it is hard because it is not anything that I can &quot;fix&quot; for him. So I feel<br/>
like I should be giving some sage wonderful advice rather then feeling helpless and <br/>
telling him will do it when he is ready.<br/>
<br/>
Also any suggestions on how to handle an almost 3 yo who wants to play the same<br/>
games as his brother? Jason is really into bionicles and Kyle has started wanting<br/>
to play the online bionicle game...well, he is no where near to being able to do it<br/>
which means that he wants me to sit with him and do it for him. I don&#39;t mind doing <br/>
this for a little while, but how do I deal with the fact that this is just not <br/>
fun for me? It was more fun when I was helping Jason do it because he and I were more<br/>
of a team. Kyle has his own reader rabbit toddler and blues clues software, plus<br/>
he just got a cute little &quot;laptop&quot; with lots of games his level and Jason&#39;s level<br/>
from my ILs for christmas. But no dice...he only<br/>
wants to play the games that he just is not developmentally ready for...which means<br/>
he winds up getting frustrated...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I just need more tips on handling frustration with kids in general. I think<br/>
that I have been realizing lately that this is a hot spot for me...how to be<br/>
supportive and not take their frustration and anger personally....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720378364">I have a 6 who on some things is a perfectionist; mostly she is<br/>
pleased if she has tried her best, but we still have the melt<br/>
downs.  I noticed that they are more common when she is already<br/>
stressed, so if the thing is a tough one or much anticipated<br/>
source of joy, I try to make sure it is available for trying out<br/>
shortly after breakfast or maybe lunch.  If she really wants to<br/>
try it out at 11 at night, I won&#39;t stop her, but I will point out<br/>
that she is less likely to succeed when she is already tired, so<br/>
maybe just get the feel of it and start back in the morning.  I<br/>
actively started on this strategy about 6 months ago and notice<br/>
that she now will frequently apply on her own - spreading out all<br/>
the contents of a kit the night before, so she can &quot;play&quot; with<br/>
it, but not doing the project until the morning.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that has helped (I think), is helping her spot<br/>
the things she gets better at.  Improved scores in gymnastics;<br/>
more accuracy in throwing; less re rolling of cookie dough;<br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
As for the littler kid who want to be bigger having had a 2 and a<br/>
5 who love to play together and whose skills are quite different,<br/>
one concrete thing that helped the younger have fun with the<br/>
on-line games was a little kid free exploration by me.  For<br/>
instance, there are a slew of preschool Lego games on-line.  If<br/>
you click through from big brother&#39;s bionicle site to the<br/>
preschool page you may all be happier; you just have to find the<br/>
path when you can remember how you got there, LOL.  On a couple I<br/>
found e-cards.  The 2 y.o. sent great grandparents and half the<br/>
world e-cards from sites that he otherwise had no hope of<br/>
navigating, but he got back tons of e-cards, so all was good.<br/>

Pay Jason ( on the sly) to play it with Kyle every day.  That won&#39;t last too <br/>
long, and it will be money well applied.<br/>

for a little while, but the novelty wore off...maybe $$$ might make it more<br/>
interesting...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the suggestions. I think what gets me is how quickly he gets<br/>
frustrated and how angry he gets. I am becoming more and more comfortable<br/>
with this aspect of his personality, but sometimes it gets hard for me.<br/>
I have realized that he basically likes to wait until he is good and ready<br/>
before he does most things. He learns by watching me do things and waiting<br/>
until he is ready. Then it gets hard to balance our needs sometimes...how<br/>
many times do *I* want to play Lemmings, realizing that this is part of how<br/>
he learns...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, actually computer games have really helped a lot with this...he was *so*<br/>
excited when we finally won the bionicle game. He went back and played it again<br/>
and again, each time needing less and less of my help. Now he likes to see<br/>
how fast he can get through it. And my dad was worried that Jason would never<br/>
learn the benefits of sticking to something that was hard. :o)<br/>

not usually accept substitutes...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821016663">I asked David Albert a very similar question when he was here to speak in<br/>
September (which, by the way, was great!).  He said that one of the best<br/>
ways to show kids how to deal with the frustration involved with learning a<br/>
new skill is to demonstrate.  It&#39;s one thing to say &quot;Mommy couldn&#39;t color<br/>
inside the lines when she was 5 either, but I got better with practice&quot;,<br/>
it&#39;s quite different for them to see you sitting at the piano playing the<br/>
same song over and over again, starting off awful and getting slowly but<br/>
progressively better.  My kids have learned so much through my attempts to<br/>
learn to type, play piano, do yoga, etc..  Sometimes they even get to see<br/>
mom have her own mini-meltdown!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! The boys have definitely gotten to see mom have a melt down before! In fact<br/>
Jason and I are helping to remind the other not to yell....<br/>
<br/>
Good idea...I do try to point out when I make a mistake (usually driving and I <br/>
get lost!) and he has seen me fail miserably at video games (but I do keep trying!)<br/>
