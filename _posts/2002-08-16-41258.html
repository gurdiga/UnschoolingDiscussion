It&#39;s all about golf.  He and his 4 brothers (I didn&#39;t know those guys <br/>
were Bill Murray&#39;s brothers) go around and play famous golf courses, and <br/>
of course, have a blast doing it.  It was hilarious, and golf generally <br/>
makes me fall asleep.<br/>

That is so great. We really love playing, intend to keep at it, and it will <br/>
be my chance at staying out of his way!<br/>
<br/>
Bill Murray recently bought a home up the road from a club I play at on <br/>
occasion (the Valley Center are of north San Diego). He&#39;s been known to drop <br/>
in, and I only wish I could be there when he does. I also love how some of <br/>
the pro&#39;s become annoyed at the pro/ams when he terrorizes the course (I <br/>
guess it&#39;s the anarchist in me).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I had to intervene ONCE at the DR, and that was when my son wanted <br/>
to take a running &quot;slap-shot!&quot; start at the ball -- Happy Gilmore style. I <br/>
told him that there is a protocol that we best observe if we want to be <br/>
allowed back.<br/>
