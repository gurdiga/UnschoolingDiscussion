<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A friend of mine had piqued my curiosity regarding the UU church, so <br/>
&gt; I looked up the local church&#39;s website.  I found that the minister is <br/>
&gt; an athiest.  Most of the impressions I had about UU was that they are <br/>
&gt; open to exploring many beliefs regarding spirituality, but my <br/>
&gt; understanding of atheism is that basically they believe there is NO <br/>
&gt; god, so I don&#39;t quite get how you have spirituality without any form <br/>
&gt; of deity, whether it be god, goddess, buddha, etc.  Am I missing <br/>
&gt; something here?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It also seemed that there was a huge democratic &quot;slant&quot; in the <br/>
&gt; sermons shown on the website.  I don&#39;t really fall in line with <br/>
&gt; either republican or democrat, so I don&#39;t know that I would be <br/>
&gt; comfortable in a setting that was extreme one way or the other.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I guess my question would be whether these observations are in <br/>
&gt; line with the average UU church.  I have not been to any church in <br/>
&gt; over 2 years due to my frustrations with the one I had been very <br/>
&gt; involved with (non-denominational Christian.)  I am not really sure <br/>
&gt; that I feel like I need (or want) a church, but the seeming lack <br/>
&gt; of &quot;doctrine&quot; within the UU church did catch my eye.  (Plus the fact <br/>
&gt; that I also found out a small group of secular homeschoolers meet at <br/>
&gt; the UU church here, as well as an astronomy group...two of my <br/>
&gt; passions!)  Any input from an insider (or otherwise) would be great!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

spiritual nurturance in the goodness and wisdom of people. Some find their <br/>
touchstone to the spiritual parts of themselves in nature. Those people might <br/>
consider themselves Atheists. <br/>
<br/>
Most UU churches do end up being pretty politically liberal, not a neccesary <br/>
by-product of the liberal faith, but it often happens. It is a challenge for <br/>
many congregations....there are fairly politically conservative people in our <br/>
midst at times, and we don&#39;t always necessarily handle it well or with <br/>
respect. Most of the time it does work though. Wars and stuff like that can <br/>
be challenges for some congregations.<br/>
<br/>
Uuism does not have a doctrine or dogma to which one subscribe. Our <br/>
principles are: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We, the member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association, <br/>
&gt; covenant to affirm and promote <br/>
&gt; The inherent worth and dignity of every person; <br/>
&gt; Justice, equity and compassion in human relations; <br/>
&gt; Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our <br/>
&gt; congregations; <br/>
&gt; A free and responsible search for truth and meaning; <br/>
&gt; The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our <br/>
&gt; congregations and in society at large; <br/>
&gt; The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all; <br/>
&gt; Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Note that even this is not intended to be doctrine. They are meant to be <br/>
ideas we gather around rather than a statement of faith. The point is to <br/>
support each person in their own search for truth and meaning. (I often get <br/>
&quot;So I can worship my toaster oven if I want?&quot; The idea is RESPONSIBLE <br/>
search.)<br/>
<br/>
UU churches are often very different from one another. Check it out if it <br/>
sounds interesting.<br/>
