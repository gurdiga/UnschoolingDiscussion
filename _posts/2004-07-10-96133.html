<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072066819">Hello all,<br/>
   This is a question for those of you who have kids who stay at <br/>
home alone. How old were they when you started letting them be at <br/>
home alone.  How old were they when they stayed at home for just a <br/>
couple of hours to a whole afternoon or evening.  I know it depends <br/>
on the child, but I am just interested in a general idea.<br/>
   I am asking this question on this list because I feel that being <br/>
able to be safe and responsible while home alone is definitely an <br/>
unschooling issue....<br/>
  Thanks for your input<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046489280">My oldest son is 12 1/2 yrs and he has only stayed home twice by <br/>
himself.  The first time he was really sick, and I went to the <br/>
drugstore to get him medicine and the second time was that he got home <br/>
from a friends house before I got back home.  I&#39;m not quite comfortable <br/>
leaving him home alone yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621954279">I can only remember leaving Pete home when he wanted to be. Probably <br/>
at 8 or so for a few hours and then at 10 he could go several hours. <br/>
At 12 is when he felt comfortable with me being gone for the better <br/>
part of a day. He still doesn&#39;t care to much for this more than twice <br/>
a week. We would try to find friends houses to visit when I left. <br/>
Before he turned ten I only left him when he had a place to go. Sara</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; home alone.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With us it was a very gradual thing with the kids staying in the house if<br/>
they chose while we were working outside (1 to 5 or so) then maybe staying<br/>
at home while I went down to the neighbor a few doors away for a bit (6 to<br/>
8) then staying home for an hour or so with me in the neighborhood and<br/>
available by phone (8 to 10 or so).<br/>
<br/>
By 10 my kids stay home as long as I am in town running errands or such.<br/>
Adriane is 13 and regularly stays home all day and during the evening, etc..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-512748546">My boys are 12 and 15 now and we leave them alone quite a bit. I work but am<br/>
self employed as a painter. I set my own schedule and allow for time to take<br/>
them to activities and to visit friends. They also help me when I need them.<br/>
They were 7 and 10 when I started leaving them alone for more than a few<br/>
hours. My hubby and I walk to a pub that&#39;s a few blocks away and see a band<br/>
and have a few drinks. They call our cellphone* if they need us. :) HTH&#39;s,<br/>

Cellphones have been great. If I want to shop or run errands and they want<br/>
to stay home they can always call me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; This is a question for those of you who have kids who stay at <br/>
<br/>
home alone. How old were they when you started letting them be at <br/>
<br/>
home alone.  How old were they when they stayed at home for just a <br/>
<br/>
couple of hours to a whole afternoon or evening.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think Holly was seven or eight before we left her all alone, and that would <br/>
be just to deliver another kid somewhere not far, or to go to the grocery <br/>
store for just a few things.  She wanted to stay.  It scared me, but she asked.<br/>
<br/>
I always made sure she had her dad&#39;s phone number at work, and a neighbor&#39;s <br/>
phone number.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I would leave two kids alone (Kirby and Holly, usually) with some <br/>
instructions about what to do in case of a disagreement.  I feared the older <br/>
picking on the younger, especially when it was Kirby and Marty.  Those were <br/>
never more than about an hour and a half or two, the oldest was (in the cases I&#39;m <br/>
thinking of) ten or eleven, and they had phone numbers and usually a rented <br/>
video or something to last as long as I would be gone.<br/>
<br/>
When I would come home I&#39;d spend some time talking with the child (or with <br/>
each separately, if there was more than one) and just kinda casually try to <br/>
totally debrief them about anything that was a problem, or scary, or that they had <br/>
needed and not had, so that the next time I could make it better.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby started wanting to stay alone when he was about 12, instead of going to <br/>
the zoo or whatever.   He wanted to play video games undisturbed.  So we <br/>
always had the plan of where he would go if he got scared to be in the house, and <br/>
who he would call if he went to a public place.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Hollywood Video near our house, and a kid coutore.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a cellphone I wouldn&#39;t have worried much at all.  Moms with <br/>
cellphones, I think, have more range.<br/>
<br/>
Because my kids had a lot of freedom, I wasn&#39;t worried that they would play <br/>
with matches or anything crazy.<br/>
<br/>
A kid in Albuquerque burned down his apartment and all the neighbors were <br/>
homeless for a few days.  He was four, and lit firecrackers in the closet.   <br/>
People were interviewed on the TV and they said it was just terrible parenting.  <br/>
The mom spoke and said firecrackers should be banned.  And that people should <br/>
never let kids get hold of lighters.<br/>
<br/>
I think if she had helped him light all the fireworks they owned on the 4th <br/>
of July, he would have had it out of his system.  And he would&#39;ve known the <br/>
closet was a bad place to do it.  And he wouldn&#39;t have hidden fireworks from her.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe those aren&#39;t related, but as to why I wasn&#39;t afraid to leave my younger <br/>
kids, it is.  I wasn&#39;t leaving them against their will.  If they had wanted <br/>
to go with me they could&#39;ve.  If they WANTED to stay home, they needed to be <br/>
ways that would not scare me (or them), so they could have the privilege again <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t advise about leaving kids home against their will.  Depending how <br/>
unhappy they are about it, things might not be safe and they might not be as safe.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951907109">&lt;&lt;This must vary by state&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It does vary by state.  Some  states have specific laws, and some don&#39;t.  <br/>
Here in New York there are no  specific laws, and law enforcement officials can <br/>
and do interpret each situation  differently.  I have been told that it is <br/>
standard procedure, in the case  of an emergency, to look at any child under the <br/>
age of 14 who is home alone  as a possible case of neglect.  But various <br/>
organizations in our area offer  babysitting courses to children as young as 11.<br/>
 <br/>
I do allow my kids to stay home  alone when the are 10...but not for long <br/>
periods of time.  When they are  11, I may allow them to watch a younger sibling <br/>
briefly.<br/>

wrong the parent is legally responsible.  Personally, I like not having a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166710742">We went camping recently and I let the kids build their own little fires<br/>
next to the fire pit. (kids are7 and 9)  They put a little ring of rocks in<br/>
a small circle (6&quot; diameter) and had a blast burning pine needles and twigs<br/>
and pinecones, etc.  Dh made some comment about how playing with fire is<br/>
dangerous. (He&#39;s Mr. Safety, in his own mind, but I think he worries<br/>
excessively.)  It was as safe a way to experiment with fire as there is.<br/>
There was no wind.  It was in a clearing that was gravel.  They were<br/>
supervised by two adults.  I explained that to him and said it&#39;s better they<br/>
learn to play with fire under these conditions than feel the need to sneak<br/>
away and play with fire under who-knows what conditions.  He then related a<br/>
story from his childhood where his brother caught a cedar wardrobe on fire<br/>
in his house experimenting with fire while hiding in the bedroom.  He made<br/>
my point for me.  <br/>
 <br/>
That said, my Eagle Scout dh can&#39;t light a campfire or woodstove to save his<br/>
life. (He was never aloud to play with fire.)  I spent my childhood playing<br/>
with fire (camping) and most of the time I can light one with one match.<br/>
It&#39;s all in the preparations.  ;0)  My girls are learning some great life<br/>
skills playing with fire.  <br/>

I think if she had helped him light all the fireworks they owned on the 4th <br/>
of July, he would have had it out of his system.  And he would&#39;ve known the <br/>
closet was a bad place to do it.  And he wouldn&#39;t have hidden fireworks from<br/>
her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-47839593">Recently my kids have been  experimenting with starting fires with a <br/>
magnifying glass.  They have  managed to start a fire on a slightly overcast day less <br/>
than an hour before  sunset.  I was very impressed.  This has led to a lot of  <br/>
experiments in starting fires, and they have learned a lot and had a lot  of <br/>
fun.     I also thought that being  able to  start a fire easily was an <br/>
excellent life skill.  But the neighbors  definitely thought that it was a bad idea <br/>
to let my kids *play with fire though*  and thought I should keep the <br/>
magnifying glass away from them.<br/>

It&#39;s all in the preparations.  ;0)  My girls are learning some great life<br/>
skills playing with fire.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the pyrotechnician/pyromaniac at our house.  When I was a kid, we lived <br/>
where trash was burned in barrels in 55 gallon drums [big oil cans], and <br/>
eventually the ashes were taken to the dump.  I loved that job above all.  I would <br/>
arrange the trash so that the cardboard tubes and wax-coated milk cartons and <br/>
such carried smoke in various directions.  It was a boring day when I had no <br/>
building materials like that. &lt;g&gt;   And lighting it with one match was my <br/>
specialty.<br/>
<br/>
We had a big dirt yard and we could play with matches without getting in <br/>
trouble.   We&#39;d play with candles and warp or melt holes in 45 rpm records  <br/>
(reject promos from a radio station my uncle managed) and hang them up for <br/>
decorations on the back porch.  (Stench was bad, but we did it outside).<br/>
<br/>
For years we&#39;ve done medieval/SCA camping.  Until the last few years <br/>
(drought) we always had one of the best fires, with wooden benches around, and that&#39;s <br/>
where the singing and story telling would end up.   Lately, fire restrictions <br/>
make it enclosed-fire-only, not much fun.<br/>
<br/>
Our current house has a fireplace, and though my husband is good with fires <br/>
outside, one of his favorite stacking plans creates something that can make a <br/>
stick roll out of the fire.  I&#39;ve pointed it out, but mostly I just keep the <br/>
grate close and when it&#39;s close to doing its collapse trick, I poke it all in.   <br/>
I don&#39;t know why he so stubbornly clings to the idea that it will always <br/>
collapse in, when he sets it to roll out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Still playing with fire, though, I melt leftover candle stuff (medieval <br/>
feasts generate candle wax) and wax some of the kindling.  It&#39;s a weird hobby, but <br/>
makes some of the easiest fire-starting ever.<br/>
<br/>
Every winter we buy marshmallows, and put them in a hanging basket by the <br/>
fireplace with long forks from thrift stores.  Every spring, I throw out the <br/>
hard, leftover marshmallows.  Less than half a bag a year.  They&#39;re too sweet for <br/>
our kids&#39; tastes, and they don&#39;t have the desperation to play with fire that <br/>
made some kids my age love marshmallows.<br/>

<br/>
Our neighbors are elderly, and in their long lives have had two houses burn <br/>
to the ground.   They&#39;re very afraid of fire.     I can understand.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t keep the magnifying glass away from them, but burning designs on <br/>
wood might be better than lighting piles of leaves, and I *would* be triple <br/>
sure to see that the magnifying glass wasn&#39;t left outside afterwards.  They and <br/>
the sun can start fires without any help.<br/>

come to believe that all hurt, all damage is to be prevented.  That if<br/>
ANYBODY at all gets hurt, somebody dropped the ball.  People are downright<br/>
paranoid, even in the little town we live in, of kidnappers, burglars,<br/>
rapists.<br/>
<br/>
People seem very happy to limit their movements, their freedom, their lives<br/>
in a vain attempt for nothing bad to ever happen to anybody.  Reminds me of<br/>
our country&#39;s reaction to 911.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, I was needed to run into the grocery store for a couple of<br/>
things the other day.  I had my 11yo son and his 10yo friend with me.  They<br/>
were busy playing Gameboy and my son asked if they could just sit on the<br/>
curb in front of the store and play while I got the few things in the store.<br/>
I said &quot;sure&quot; but the friend decided it was a bad idea because somebody<br/>
might try to &quot;steal&quot; them.  My son looked at him like he was crazy but came<br/>
along into the store so his friend wouldn&#39;t be uncomfortable.  This is in a<br/>
small town of less than 5,000 people &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413527005">Roxana (16), reading over my shoulder, says she read it at about 5 or 6  <br/>
years old and then regularly every so often after that. She LOVES it  <br/>
and says she just got more out of it as she got older. She doesn&#39;t  <br/>
think she was so disturbed by it when she was young as she was as she  <br/>
got older. But it was a &quot;good disturbed&quot; - made her think and think.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie read it young, too, and recently read it again. I think she&#39;s  <br/>
read it several times (and the companion book, too).<br/>
<br/>
It comes up on a regular basis - every time any one of their friends  <br/>
reads it they all get started talking about it, again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have said it is not appropriate for younger kids - but Rox  <br/>
disagrees with me.<br/>
<br/>
So - there you have two opinions.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Their is a companion to the giver, called Gathering Blue.  Both are  <br/>
&gt;&gt; very<br/>
&gt;&gt; disturbing novels.  Maybe I just take them too seriously, but I was  <br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally, I think we have entered the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; of safety.<br/>
&gt; We<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have come to believe that all hurt, all damage is to be prevented.<br/>
&gt; That<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; if<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ANYBODY at all gets hurt, somebody dropped the ball.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you read The Giver?  A utopian society where bad things have  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eliminated.  At least at first glance...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I don&#39;t deny that these are wonderful books.  They are so deep and <br/>
thought provoking and incredible.  But the ideas in them are complicated <br/>
and disturbing.  It&#39;s like the Holocaust or a current story about people <br/>
starving in Africa that&#39;s in the LA Times or what happened in Cambodia.  <br/>
Once a child has read about or seen pictures depicting these events, <br/>
they can&#39;t ever ever forget them.  I&#39;ll never forget when I realized <br/>
Anne Frank died, or the first time I went to the Holocaust Museum in LA, <br/>
or when I saw the Killing Fields.  Those memories are burned into my <br/>
brain.  I feel strongly that our children need to know these things, <br/>
they need, must know about the Holocaust, the starvation in Africa, the <br/>
Cambodian Holocaust, Vietnam, the horrors of the US Civil War, etc.--but <br/>
I don&#39;t think they need to have these images, this knowledge, when they <br/>
are so young.  There is enough time to know this stuff, when they are <br/>
older.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, back to the books, they are great books, amazing stories, and <br/>
I will give them to Lexie to read... To me, it&#39;s not about her ability <br/>
to read the books (ie, her reading level, whatever that means), nor is <br/>
it about her ability to understand the plot or story, but instead, <br/>
because I know she will understand the story, and think on it... and <br/>
well, I don&#39;t think she needs to think of those ideas so much when she&#39;s <br/>
so young.<br/>
<br/>
Right now she&#39;s reading Haddax&#39;s Among the Impostors.  She just finished <br/>
Among the Hidden, which are similar kinda of Sci-fi type stuff. She <br/>
asked me today if they took place in modern times, or in the future or <br/>
in the past?  I told her that it was not really any of those time <br/>
periods, it was sorta like an alternative universe type idea...She also <br/>
read Running out of Time, also by Haddax.  Good books, if you like the <br/>
Giver, and a little bit lighter. <br/>

read that book without crying and dreaming, now!  The school has a copy <br/>
that has an afterward by the author, and she talks about whether the <br/>
Jonas and Gabriel die at the end or not.  I had always assumed they had <br/>
been rescued by whomever was in the house, so I was very disturbed to <br/>
find out the author felt they had died.  She said in her essay that she <br/>
gets a lot of readers writing to her upset that Jonas and Gabriel die, <br/>
and insisting to her that they don&#39;t die, which she finds amusing.  It&#39;s <br/>
a very revealing essay, but I can&#39;t say it made me feel better about the <br/>
book. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>yeah, but I don&#39;t want Lexie to have those thoughts just yet.  Maybe I&#39;m <br/>
wrong, but.... she&#39;s just nine.  In packing our books I found some Sweet <br/>
Valley Twins or some such book, and thought about throwing them out or <br/>
bringing them to the HSC conference or whatever, but I&#39;d almost see <br/>
Lexie read such drivel then think too hard on those books.<br/>

as more than just a really good story and it wasn&#39;t until she was older <br/>
that she thought deeply about the themes of it and what was behind the <br/>
plot. As a kid, she just thought it was a great book because it created <br/>
such a real alternative world and so on. She thinks it is disturbing in <br/>
an intellectual way, not in a horror story way, so people won&#39;t be <br/>
disturbed by it unless they are intellectually &#39;ready&#39; to think about <br/>
it. In other words if a child is at the point that they will think <br/>
about it then she thinks they can handle it and if they&#39;re not ready to <br/>
handle it, they won&#39;t think about the implications of it and won&#39;t be <br/>
disturbed by it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is????  I&#39;ve read discussions on PA homeschool lists about this <br/>
and I always came away with the impression that PA law has no age.  <br/>
It&#39;s up to the discretion of the parents, which seems nice but it <br/>
also means that determining whether or not leaving the children home <br/>
alone is up to the discretion of the individual social worker. <br/>
<br/>
I found this site from Erie, PA children and youth.  FAQ #2 says that <br/>
the law doesn&#39;t state a specific age, but that children under 10 <br/>
definitely need adult supervision.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;d be okay leaving my kids home alone for a few hours <br/>
(ages 11,7,and 5) especially if I talked to them regularly by cell <br/>
phone but I&#39;m hesitant to because you KNOW that there are people who <br/>
would report that if they found out...</div>
