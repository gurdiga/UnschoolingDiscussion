<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403136955">We did some heavy checking and our points of concern were do they<br/>
discriminate in their giving and how much of the money goes to frivolous<br/>
spending.  SA doesn&#39;t discriminate when called on to help, they don&#39;t<br/>
discriminate in their charitable work for children and they don&#39;t send their<br/>
mucky mucks on fancy vacations or write off big $$$ for overhead.<br/>
<br/>
We checked other organizations and they were very frivolous with the money<br/>
they received, didn&#39;t do a good accounting of where the money went, were<br/>
slow to get moving with the giving and played pick and choose with who they<br/>
helped and the amount of paperwork they required made the IRS look like the<br/>
good guys!<br/>
<br/>
When we did local fundraising and asked that what we raised be used in a<br/>
particular area of need, they said no problem and then sent us a thank-you<br/>
note with an accounting of where the money had gone.<br/>
