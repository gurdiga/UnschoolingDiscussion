<div id="ygrps-yiv-719713160">-=- I also would like to say I<br/>
think it&#39;s cool that you haven&#39;t gotten your feelings<br/>
all hurt by peole singling you out and said &quot;well fine<br/>
then, I&#39;m not going to say anything anymore&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I used to get my feelings hurt when I was in my 20&#39;s.  I would cry.<br/>
(It wasn&#39;t homeschooling, but other stuff of a similar philosophical nature.) <br/>
 <br/>
And I quit teaching because I was frustrated by the lazy bad attitudes of the <br/>
other teachers, and the dishonest caca of some of the parents, and the low <br/>
goals of the administration, and all that lack of vision and high ideals.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in my 30&#39;s I&#39;d get frustrated and try to figure out why other <br/>
people were more willing to be falsely nice than real, and why people at jobs <br/>
and in families were willing to bend their principles (if they even had any) <br/>
at the least hint of discussion (let alone argument).  I learned a lot.<br/>
<br/>
In my 40&#39;s, I figure some information is more important than comfort level, <br/>
and that I&#39;m not personally responsible for everyone else&#39;s comfort level.  <br/>
If I withhold crucial, life-changing information because it might disturb <br/>
someone&#39;s happy day, I might as well have a lobotomy and put my kids back in <br/>
school.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about the summary of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
So some people who are not in their 40&#39;s or 50&#39;s and like to think that older <br/>
people don&#39;t know anything special even get offended when I discuss that <br/>
progression of understanding.   I could just hush about it lest I might <br/>
disturb someone younger with the thought that they&#39;d keep on learning every <br/>
day for many, many years (if they&#39;re lucky).<br/>
<br/>
No I couldn&#39;t. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br>Well, it is very interesting to hear about one woman&#39;s journey -- so far!
<br>
<br>I am in my 40s and have so far ended up at a different place though.
<br>
<br>Maybe where you get to depends on the journey -- or something like that! &nbsp;:)
<br>
<br>Glad you&#39;re enjoying discovering yourself along the way.

<br/>
It&#39;s probably a more mature version of the journey you&#39;ve been on since your <br/>
20&#39;s, though.  That was my point.  <br/>
<br/>
There are certain ways of being that are my personality and belief.  When I <br/>
was young I was baffled by some things that are no longer baffling.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281978227">hm. very nicely said and explained. <br/>
<br/>
also, just to add, for rambling sake (one of my<br/>
favorite past times)<br/>
I thought I might want to be a teacher at one point<br/>
too. Then thought I couldn&#39;t handle that either cuz<br/>
the parents who really just didn&#39;t care about thier<br/>
kids would drive me insane. My sis was a teacher&#39;s aid<br/>
at a very *exclusive* (read: rich people, or people<br/>
who are broke just from paying the tuition) private<br/>
school in Phx and she said the same thing. Thier<br/>
parents pushed and pushed them to excel acedemically.<br/>
There were some that were involved and cared, but most<br/>
just dropped them off EARLY (6:30 AM) and picked them<br/>
up late (6:30PM) and never asked what was going on<br/>
with them....the part about that that would frustrate<br/>
me would be the same as working at a day care or<br/>
something like that...you are in charge of the primary<br/>
part of taking care of them all day...how they learn,<br/>
etc. But you have no rights and can do nothing else<br/>
for them once they leave your care. I would end up<br/>
ridiculously fighting for custody of 50 kids if it<br/>
were me. :)<br/>
