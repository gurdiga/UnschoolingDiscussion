Many have written saying it sounds too good to be true !<br/>
Well, we are glad it sounds that way, but it really is true :)<br/>
<br/>
They say need is the basis for invention .... This CD came about<br/>
after us becoming a homeschool family and seeing how hard<br/>
it is to track down all the things and information you need to do<br/>
it ... Now it is all available in one easy to use software program<br/>
.... I am not just asking you to use it - I WILL USE IT! ...<br/>
<br/>
The database of listings within this program is HUGE!<br/>
There is information about everything you can think of<br/>
to do with homeschooling !!!<br/>
<br/>
You Will Love It!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-49803432">I just want to let you guys know that I am leaving this list.  I am so <br/>
tired of the arguing and everything, that I have been deleting every <br/>
post from this list for days.  If I&#39;m going to delete them all, why <br/>
bother being on the list in the first place?  Anyone who wants to <br/>
correspond to me privately may.  I hope some of you guys will get <br/>
a life instead of living just to batter each other with words each day.<br/>
