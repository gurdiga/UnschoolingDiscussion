It ALL boils down to respect.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of a child----and ESPECIALLY an adult---that would walk by and toss <br/>
a candy wrapper on the den floor is absolutely incredible to me! <br/>
<br/>
I have a group of kids that comes here----who are pigs (OK, I don&#39;t need to <br/>
catch the same kind of crap I caught for my slug comment earlier this year!). I <br/>
walked up one day, and they had put tictacs in their mouths, sucked the color <br/>
off, and then SPIT them on my floor! TWO canisters of them! I was OUTRAGED. <br/>
Sticky candy pieces all over the carpet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not the queen of clean, but there are limits. That went WAAAY <br/>
over my comfort zone of just existing! Who would actually DARE to behave like <br/>
that in his own house, much less someone else&#39;s????<br/>
<br/>
rant, rant, rant, rant<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. These kids are made to clean up at their own house---whether they <br/>
want to or not. So I figure that they see it as, since they have to clean, that <br/>
they can mess it up however they want----it doesn&#39;t matter. *Maybe* they&#39;ll <br/>
luck out and mom will clean it. Maybe not, but at least *it doesn&#39;t matter*. <br/>
<br/>
It matters to me. Duncan&#39;s room is not sparkling, by any means. I get in <br/>
there and clean it up every week or so. He helps. Sometimes he does it himself. <br/>
But the thing is: He OWNS It. It&#39;s not clean because I make him. It&#39;s not dirty <br/>
because he doesn&#39;t care. We both care. That&#39;s a HUGE difference. <br/>
<br/>
We own the messes. We own the clean. We help each other. There&#39;s no <br/>
animosity. There&#39;s no requirement. There&#39;s no shame. There&#39;s just respect---for <br/>
ourselves, for each other, for our home.<br/>

It really does make me want to scream right out loud.  It&#39;s so simple just to <br/>
hold it in your hand a little while longer until you can get near a trash <br/>
can.  Or stick it in your pocket until later or whatever.  Just DON&#39;T drop it <br/>
casually like no one will notice.  <br/>
<br/>
Truth is some people are absentminded about stuff like that, especially <br/>
children.  My best friend&#39;s kids were huge litter bugs, leaving banana peels and <br/>
stuff like that around the house all the time.  I could understand it out of her <br/>
2 yo, but she never managed to raise the consciousness of the other 3 as they <br/>
grew.  They simply weren&#39;t aware that this item would still be there when she <br/>
spoke sternly at them to pick it up and pick up the rest of the living room, <br/>
too, a couple of hours later.  It was a family trait.  The kids are much older <br/>
now and I haven&#39;t been to her house in a long time because she lives far <br/>
away, so maybe they are aware, now.  Maybe I helped all those years ago by <br/>
pointing it out to them on occasion.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but when grown people throw <br/>
stuff out the car window, they get a honk and pointing finger.  They do it <br/>
because they think no one will notice.  I notice.<br/>

Well, if you couldn&#39;t tell by my rant! &lt;G&gt;---I&#39;m STILL trying to deal with <br/>
it! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I cleaned it up after they were gone (cussing the whole time). I&#39;ve banned <br/>
these particular children from having food outside of the kitchen. I put the <br/>
candy bowl up when they&#39;re here. I &quot;monitor&quot; the bedroom VERY often.<br/>
<br/>
None of the other friends have crossed my &quot;line&quot;, so it is a non-issue with <br/>
them. It&#39;s just these who have lost privileges here. Duncan saw my anger that <br/>
day, and he&#39;s on board with my restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just incomprehensible to me that anybody could be that inconsiderate. I <br/>
don&#39;t feel that I can trust them.<br/>

at dollar stores -- some with lids even) right next to the couch (by the<br/>
television) and the computer are in order.  Then, you can just toss the<br/>
wrappers right there and empty the cans when they are full.  If I had a<br/>
child that habitually left garbage in one certain spot, I&#39;d buy them a<br/>
garbage can for right there wherever that there was.<br/>

Yeah, but we have trash cans near each computer desk, everyone has a trash <br/>
can in their bedroom, and all the bathrooms have trash cans, too.  Huh.  Now <br/>
that I think about it, there&#39;s a trash can in every room in my house!  (It wasn&#39;t <br/>
that way when I had a bigger house.)  <br/>
<br/>
Leaving something on a desk or table is not the same as dropping something on <br/>
the floor.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724371186">So when do we get to expect the kids will see the importance of throwing <br/>
trash in the trash can? And banana peels in the compost or trash? Mine are 5 <br/>
and almost 8 and they are not consistant with this. <br/>
<br/>
I do ask my kids to do things and rarely do they want to.  Yet they will <br/>
spontaneously do some things that do help around the house.  <br/>
<br/>
When some of you are saying it is just plain rude for someone to drop a <br/>
wraper on the floor and not clean it up what age child are you thinking of?  <br/>
Because I can see as a 5yo or 8yo thinking what is  the big deal that a <br/>
wrapper is on the floor?  I am not troubled by it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want  to punish yet how do I get accross that bubble gum goes IN THE <br/>
TRASH CAN not on the floor???    It has been suggested that we accept no as <br/>
an answer.  Then it is up to us to pick up the wrapper or bubble gum on the <br/>
floor.  So when will they do this willingly?  So when the kids are young are <br/>
they being rude or are they just forgetful and unware?  <br/>
<br/>
How much do we expect of our kids in relationship to housework /<br/>
consideration for others when they are young??<br/>
<br/>
I am really struggling with this right now.  Because I see so many things that <br/>
get done that don&#39;t seem necessary to me that I would like the kids to see that <br/>
as well.  Like it&#39;s okay if you need to dump the clean clothes from the laundry <br/>
hamper to find what you want but just put them all back in the hamper when <br/>
you are done.<br/>
<br/>
Or last night my son just dropped his coat in the living room and the right after <br/>
that took out all of the yarn from the yarn/craft drawer and dropped it on the <br/>
floor.  I asked him to either hang up the coat or put it on his bed and put the <br/>
yarn back in the drawer.  He refused at first but I persisted and he finally did it.  <br/>
I don&#39;t belive I was particularly nagging...just persistent with it.<br/>
<br/>
Or like today the kids made a sandwhich and hadn&#39;t put away any of the <br/>
ingredients.  I wanted them to come in and help put them away.  And waiting <br/>
isn&#39;t a good idea because it was perishable foods.  <br/>
<br/>
Or they make a spill in the kitchen and rather than tell me about they leave it.  <br/>
If they would just tell me I would come in and help them clean up.  <br/>
<br/>
There was another thread recently about popcorn being all over the floor with <br/>
rubberbands and toys etc...so when you have just had enough of the mess we <br/>
ask for help and if they don&#39;t can we say yes I will help you after I am finished <br/>
with this?<br/>
<br/>
I guess another question I am trying to understand is so its okay to go to the <br/>
movies before the kitchen is cleaned yet how do we finally say I really want to <br/>
get this done before I do anything else?  Not the they have to help but if they <br/>
do help its more likely the mom will have the energy and time to do what the <br/>
kids want to do.<br/>
<br/>
And when the kids are young I find the other issue is not that they won&#39;t help <br/>
yet they are fighting or bickering with each other then I can&#39;t even get done the <br/>
cleaning I want to get done.  Which I have let slide so I can be available for <br/>
them and not focus on a clean house.<br/>
<br/>
So is the answer both?? We go to the movies when the kitchen is dirty and <br/>
sometimes we go to the movies the next day because Mom really wants to get <br/>
the house picked up?<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;So when do we get to expect the kids will see the importance of throwing<br/>
trash in the trash can? And banana peels in the compost or trash? Mine are 5<br/>
and almost 8 and they are not consistant with this. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter just turned 3 and she understands that when she eats<br/>
candy, the paper gets thrown in the garbage can. She understands when she<br/>
takes her pull up off, it gets thrown in the garbage can. Last year she left<br/>
the papers all over the floor. When she was younger, she saw her brother and<br/>
sisters throwing stuff away and although it wasn&#39;t important to her yet to<br/>
do so, she was watching. And she saw me pick up her stuff and throw it all<br/>
away. Sometimes saying where it goes as I was doing it, sometimes not. And<br/>
if I was right there with her as she unwrapped something, I would say where<br/>
the paper went. Of course she was still throwing it on the floor and I was<br/>
picking it up!<br/>
Paper wrappers are garbage and she understands garbage and where it goes.<br/>
Just as she understands that when she finishes eating something, and there&#39;s<br/>
some left, to throw it in the garbage and not leave it where ever she was<br/>
for me to find days later. She saw the results of ants coming from food<br/>
being left out. Every now and then she gets sidetracked but I always ask her<br/>
what she did with her banana, cookie bar, etc. and she tells me she threw it<br/>
away. She also, most of the time when she&#39;s done eating from a plate,<br/>
remembers to put the plate on the counter so I can reach it from the kitchen<br/>
to wash. They mostly eat in the playroom. Like now I found her almost eaten<br/>
bowl of cereal on the counter. I didn&#39;t say anything to her. It&#39;s just<br/>
something the kids do. And if anything is left around, I just go and put it<br/>
where it needs to be. They forgot, no big deal.<br/>

I didn&#39;t say it but I thought it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids learned to say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; not because we told them to, <br/>
but because from before they were born, my husband and I had always said <br/>
&quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; to each other for everything.  A drink of water.  Opening <br/>
the door.   We had been together eight years before Kirby was born, and we had <br/>
never failed to say &quot;please and thank you.&quot;  Friends of ours commented on it. <br/>
 We thought maybe if THEY did it more  they would have better relationships <br/>
with friends and lovers.<br/>
<br/>
So our kids did it because we did it.<br/>
<br/>
They put trash in the trash can because when they were toddlers and had extra <br/>
energy and wanted to DO things, we would ask them to put trash in trash cans <br/>
for us, and they saw us putting their trash in trash cans too, though they <br/>
would sometimes get grumpy because we were getting all the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly and I ate at a mall food court, and I started to take the <br/>
trash.  Holly grabbed the tray and said she wanted to do it.  She&#39;s twelve.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly were to drop a wrapper on the floor at our house, I would think she <br/>
needed some serious counselling, it would be SO unlike her.<br/>
<br/>
But we didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them to, we just modelled it as a part of life.<br/>
<br/>
We have trashcans in every room, always have.  Sometimes I go to someone <br/>
else&#39;s house and they don&#39;t even have a trashcan in the bathroom.   Mysterious.<br/>

to <br/>
<br/>
get this done before I do anything else? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a matter of whether it&#39;s okay with us, or okay with you.<br/>
I think what people are trying to share is ways in which they&#39;ve moved <br/>
successfully away from the traditional ways of thinking about chores and housework.  <br/>
If it works for me, I&#39;m going to tell people what I did to get it to work.  <br/>
And it took years.  It took my kids&#39; whole lives to get from birth to now.   So <br/>
whether it&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; to go to the movies with dishes in the sink is way too <br/>
particular a question to ask.  It&#39;s not about dishes, it&#39;s about belief and <br/>
attitude and relationships between parents and children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Or like today the kids made a sandwhich and hadn&#39;t put away any of the <br/>
<br/>
ingredients.  I wanted them to come in and help put them away.  And waiting <br/>
<br/>
isn&#39;t a good idea because it was perishable foods.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If my kids are making their own food, I&#39;m willing to clean up after it if I&#39;m <br/>
there, because it&#39;s easier than ME making them food (after which I&#39;d have to <br/>
clean up after myself).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  Like it&#39;s okay if you need to dump the clean clothes from the laundry <br/>
<br/>
hamper to find what you want but just put them all back in the hamper when <br/>
<br/>
you are done.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dumped where?  If they&#39;re clean can&#39;t you just put them away?  If they were <br/>
put away the kid wouldn&#39;t have to be digging for clean clothes.  If ours dump <br/>
clean laundry to look,they dump it on the couch.  It can stay until it&#39;s <br/>
folded, or I put it into the laundry basket myself, because I don&#39;t want to sort and <br/>
fold it yet.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t want  to punish yet how do I get accross that bubble gum goes IN <br/>
THE <br/>
<br/>
TRASH CAN not on the floor??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would punishing help?<br/>
We&#39;ve always wrapped gum in paper before putting it in the trash so the gum <br/>
doesn&#39;t stick to the inside of the trashcan.  But my kids don&#39;t chew much gum <br/>
either.  It&#39;s rare.  They&#39;ll throw it away in its own wrapper if they still <br/>
have that in their pocket, or in a piece of paper that&#39;s already in the trash, or <br/>
a piece of toilet paper.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or they make a spill in the kitchen and rather than tell me about they <br/>
leave it.  <br/>
<br/>
If they would just tell me I would come in and help them clean up.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I find stuff on the floor and I don&#39;t know who did it, I yell &quot;WHO SPILLED <br/>
THIS WATER?&quot; or something, and while I&#39;m getting stuff to clean it up, a kid <br/>
or two will show up, and know or not know, and if it&#39;s the one who spilled it <br/>
(or not), and I&#39;ll be saying it&#39;s dangerous, and if it&#39;s something like milk <br/>
it&#39;s important for them to know it would STINK.  But honestly, it&#39;s been years <br/>
and years since I found a sticky-spill.   We have a box of rags under the sink <br/>
so it&#39;s easy for someone to get a rag.  <br/>
<br/>
Because we don&#39;t MAKE them clean up their own messes in a punitive way, <br/>
they&#39;re willing to help other people clean up messes they make.   So we have <br/>
responsibility and generosity, rather than the kind of individualized ownership of <br/>
chores or messes.   <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;TRASH CAN not on the floor???    It has been suggested that we accept no<br/>
as <br/>
an answer.  Then it is up to us to pick up the wrapper or bubble gum on the <br/>
floor.  So when will they do this willingly?  So when the kids are young are<br/>
<br/>
they being rude or are they just forgetful and unware?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn is 4, she sometimes drops wrappers, and certainly makes a very big mess<br/>
when doing paper cut out projects - her current passion. I do 95 % of the<br/>
picking up. However there have been some occasions when she has refused to<br/>
pick up something small and yucky - like a piece of hot dog and ketchup that<br/>
then starts to soak into the carpet. I pick it up, and tell her that it<br/>
really bothers me because it makes a stain, could attract ants etc. I<br/>
usually then ask her if she will help with the clean up. Since this usually<br/>
involves water she is much more willing. The big leap we seem to have made<br/>
around here recently, is that Jayn will tell me at once if there has been a<br/>
spill or wet mess made. &quot;Are you happy I told you?&quot; she asks with immense<br/>
pride in herself. She has never been punished for making a spill, although<br/>
there are times when she has persisted in some experimental activity, like<br/>
pouring out a glass of juice, despite being asked not to. I get irritated,<br/>
but the greatest punishment she could envisage would be not being allowed to<br/>
help clean it up. I&#39;m really looking forward to having floors without<br/>
carpeting at out next home.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.  Families turn it around all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
There are families here who used to press school, and then had a period of <br/>
being strict school-at-homers (doh!) and who used to ground kids and spank them <br/>
and whatever all, and now they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Putting plates in the sink is nothing compared to all that.    When we&#39;ve <br/>
changed a behavior here, what seems to have worked best is just talking.  &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t want it to be the way it has been.  What can we do to change it?  Please <br/>
remind me if I forget.  Thanks.&quot;  Those kinds of messages, in various <br/>
combinations.  And then when it&#39;s going better, I tried to acknowledge it with &quot;I&#39;m so <br/>
glad we started doing [whatever],&quot; and &quot;Thanks!  That&#39;s really cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The older my kids get the better they are at picking up just anyone&#39;s dirty <br/>
dishes if they&#39;re on the way to the kitchen, and they&#39;re past the urge to say <br/>
&quot;Whose is this?&quot; because they get personal satisfaction and a &quot;thanks&quot; from <br/>
someone sometimes, no matter whose stuff they&#39;re taking.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I wouldn&#39;t have taken someone&#39;s stuff without reporting it <br/>
to my mom as &quot;I brought mine AND Nada&#39;s&quot; or whatever, because my mom was so <br/>
lacking in generosity of spirit herself, so we had our demarcations of whose was <br/>
whose stuff, responsibility, time, rights, and we guarded our meager <br/>
territories jealously.  The tone was set for us, and we just staked our allowed claims <br/>
within that scenario.  Generosity was a weakness, or seen as sucking up or <br/>
&quot;what do you want?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Harshness and inflexibility and cynicism are things I strive to avoid, and <br/>
talking about what in general helps prevent them seems, to me, a good kind of <br/>
commentary.  It doesn&#39;t mean mentioning it is an accusation.  It&#39;s a general <br/>
commentary, a little warning-beacon, an orange barrel by a pothole.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804899622">***trying to find this in the Chicago area....tried WBEZ but could not<br/>
find it....anyone have any more info??/<br/>
maybe I already missed it :(***<br/>
<br/>
If you did miss it, you can listen to it later at www.npr.org.  You&#39;ll<br/>
have missed the opportunity to participate, but you can still hear the<br/>
program.  <br/>
That&#39;s how I have to do it.  I can&#39;t get an npr station here and I seem<br/>
to have missed it on-line. <br/>
