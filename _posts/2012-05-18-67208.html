<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416385913">Hey folks, <br/>
<br/>
My daughter had cradle cap as a baby and it never really went away, I think. There are spots of darker crud you can scrape away all over her scalp. If you try hard and don&#39;t mind pissing her off. :) She&#39;s just 5 this month, and my husband remembers being 6 and having his mom compulsively pick at his scalp. He HATED it. Once he became a beach kid around then with his hair wet for hours a day it went away. She definitely takes way more after him genetically. We never have bathed her much (usually 1-2 times a week unless she seemed to need it) since she had very dry sensitive skin, and doesn&#39;t want a bath often, and it didn&#39;t seem necessary. She gets a lot of art supplies and sometimes sand on her but not dirt. We regularly go a month or so without doing anything other than getting her hair wet. She HATES having her hair washed. The crud isn&#39;t itchy, and it doesn&#39;t bother her, so it&#39;s fine by me. I personally only wash my hair with baking soda once a week and you can&#39;t tell now that my scalp adjusted, so washing every day seems excessive.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re about to change insurance, though, and I&#39;m a little concerned about looking to a new pediatrician like I am neglecting my kid. So my question is, has anyone else had experience with anything like this? I wish I knew whether this is just what happens with some kids when you don&#39;t wash their hair, but I don&#39;t want to force her into frequent hairwashing to find out. We don&#39;t have good pool access anymore or I&#39;d try daily swimming. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838912963">We just finally addressed my 7-year old son&#39;s cradle cap the other day.   I<br/>
asked him casually whether he wanted me to get rid of it, and he said,<br/>
&quot;sure!&quot;  That was not the response I&#39;d gotten when I&#39;d asked previously<br/>
over the years (though I never put any pressure on him).  He&#39;s also an<br/>
infrequent bather and doesn&#39;t like having his hair washed, though these<br/>
days he doesn&#39;t seem to mind as much.<br/>
<br/>
If/when she DOES decide she&#39;s ready to get rid of it, olive oil works<br/>
amazingly well--just coat the scalp with it, let it sit for 10-15 minutes,<br/>
and comb it out with a fine tooth comb.  It&#39;s really pretty easy, if your<br/>
child is agreeable to it.  Sam actually really enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
As for doctors, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it--we have changed doctors<br/>
frequently, and nobody has ever said a thing about it.      If they do,<br/>
just smile and confidently let them know you&#39;ll address it when your<br/>
daughter is ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385155445">I&#39;d gotten advice that some vaseline or baby oil rubbed in would help loosen it, so it would brush out easily. It didn&#39;t work perfectly, but it helped. Made my son&#39;s hair greasy, though. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435336336">It could be an allergy, and I would definitely recommend olive oil.  A good<br/>
pure virgin olive oil.  Just massage her scalp with it and a very small<br/>
amount is all you need.  Just wet your finger tips and do so.  She may even<br/>
enjoy doing this herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052696899">***My daughter had cradle cap as a baby and it never really went away, I think.***<br/>
<br/>
Margaux had that for many years.  She never ever wanted her hair brushed and she hated (still does) having it touched and really avoided washing it.  She&#39;s 10 now and bathes at least once a week and sometimes brushes her hair.  The cradle cap went away on its own about 2 yrs ago.  There was no way she would let me do anything to remove it.  She knew it was there and didn&#39;t care.  We&#39;ve done nothing different, it just went away.  Some kids have really sensitive scalps.  The cradle cap sticks to the base of the hair and will actually pull out hair if you try to remove it.  My daughter found that to be way too painful to experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When she was a baby I&#39;d rub oil into her scalp while she nursed and that would remove it, but it comes right back.  By the time she had enough hair to somewhat hide it, she didn&#39;t want her head touched.  One of her cousins had the same issue but his mom put all kinds of stuff in his hair to get rid of it because it really bothered her.  His went away when he was about 8 too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924106603">In addition to the other suggestions already made, I&#39;ve had good results on<br/>
my eleven year old&#39;s pubescent cradle cap by treating it internally.<br/>
Vitamin D from the sun, liver support like dandelion and nettles, and<br/>
cod/flax/coconut oils.  If your daughter has a hard time with supplements<br/>
you may be able to mix them in to other foods?  My daughter&#39;s scalp was so<br/>
sensitive she wouldn&#39;t let me brush it let alone rub the flakes off.  By<br/>
treating it internally we were able to avoid that! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850842447">I&#39;ve spent the past few years struggling with crud on my own scalp. Apparently, I&#39;ve got the adult version of cradle cap.  In my case, it&#39;s related to my eczema. It&#39;s not a hair washing or not washing thing. It&#39;s stress, and genetics, the weather...and probably other things I can&#39;t put my finger on. <br/>
<br/>
I just Googled and found a ton of articles about cradle cap in older children.  This article &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cradlecaptreatment.org/cradle-cap-in-older-children/">http://www.cradlecaptreatment.org/cradle-cap-in-older-children/</a>&gt; states that it&#39;s *not* caused by poor hygenie and reccomends that you contact your pediatrician if it&#39;s spreading to other parts of the body, irritating, or bleeding. Similar information is here &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_cap">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_cap</a>&gt; <br/>
<br/>
What if you approached the new pediatrician with the attitude that it&#39;s just this mildly annoying skin problem and you&#39;ve been working to find the best way to manage it? The doctor may offer some suggestions, but you don&#39;t have to follow any that you disagree with. <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to try the olive oil on my own scalp -- thanks to those who suggested it! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915622804">Morgan had cradle cap for a long time - and when she was younger she was in the tub a lot and got her hair wet/washed frequently. So in my experience, it&#39;s not a &quot;no washing&quot; thing. She does have a very sensitive scalp, though, so anything involving combing her hair was right out. I think it went away around age 7ish - that time when kids grow out of that sort of generic &quot;little kid&quot; look. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141580975">Thank you SO MUCH. I love you guys. The cradle cap articles confused me a little, and we have more of a brown scum actually than a yellow flake & I&#39;m not seeing that anywhere. But the approach at this point will be pretty much the same anyway. I&#39;ve been reassured that I can let it be a bit longer. <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who were curious, Katya has been off cow dairy since she was a baby and it made her poop blood. Awesome! We&#39;ve reintroduced a tiny tiny bit in goldfish crackers etc but no scalp change. She had one huge ezcema episode as a toddler after eating a whole box of peanut butter crackers and a whole tin of Altoids, so I wonder if it could be peanut butter related...but I&#39;m sure that, if it bumps way further up my priority list, is a better query for the foodlab group. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074600324">Cradle cap is a fungus that can be an indication there is fungus/yeast in the body too. You can certainly treat it topically with an anti-fungal like coconut oil and/or tea tree oil but it may not completely resolve without addressing the internal environment too. A probiotic and a low to no sugar diet is a great place to start. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608510507">I young babies it can be overactive oil glands or a release of mom&#39;s hormones, but if it persists or comes back at an older age, it is always wise to treat it as a yeast conditions. It doesn&#39;t hurt to treat it this way in babies either just in case. If it wasn&#39;t yeast, no harm done. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471573234">Could it just be vernix stuck to the head (in a newborn)? Our son was born with that waxy stuff on his head. I always assumed it was vernix which hadn&#39;t washed off because of his thick hair. It stuck about for a few years (he didn&#39;t like hair washing or combing) but has gone now (he&#39;s five). With my daughter it was the same, only she seems to like a hair wash, so I massaged in olive oil, and then after a shampooing, combed it out. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608471033">My now 10 year old had cradle cap until he was around 6 (I think, can&#39;t remember when it disappeared exactly).  We tried different things when he was a baby (shampoo, oil, ect..), but nothing really seemed to work.  I didn&#39;t worry too much, because he never complained about it and it didn&#39;t seem to bother him.   Washing his hair more did seem to help some (he did go through a phase of not wanting to wash his hair very often) but not entirely.  He seemed to grow out of it at some point and hasn&#39;t had it for at least a few years.  Our younger son (age 6 now) never had it.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting to hear that it might be related to a dairy allergy.  The son that had it is personally averse to most dairy (not allergic).  He does eat yogurt, but that&#39;s about the only dairy he has ever eaten on a regular basis.  Doesn&#39;t drink milk and the only thing he likes a bit of cheese on is a bean burrito.  <br/>
