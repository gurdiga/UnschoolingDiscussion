UNDERSTANDING ADULTISM<br/>
To be successful in our work with young people, we must understand a<br/>
particular condition of youth: that young people are often mistreated<br/>
and disrespected simply because they are young. The word &quot;adultism&quot; <br/>
refers to<br/>
behaviors and attitudes based on the assumption that adults are better<br/>
than young people, and entitled to act upon young people without their<br/>
agreement, writes John Bell. This mistreatment is reinforced by social<br/>
institutions, laws, customs, and attitudes. If you think about it, you<br/>
will realize that except for prisoners and a few other institutionalized<br/>
groups, young people are more controlled than any other group in<br/>
society.<br/>
As children, most young people are told what to eat, what to wear, when<br/>
to go to bed, when they can talk, that they will go to school, which<br/>
friends are okay, and when they are to be in the house. Even as they<br/>
grow older, the opinions of most young people are not valued; they are<br/>
punished at the will or whim of adults; their emotions are considered<br/>
&quot;immature.&quot; In addition, adults reserve the right to punish, threaten,<br/>
hit, take away &quot;privileges,&quot; and ostracize young people when such<br/>
actions are deemed to be instrumental in controlling or disciplining<br/>
them. If this were a description of the way a group of adults was<br/>
treated, we would all agree that their oppression was almost total.<br/>
However, for the most part, the adult world considers this treatment of<br/>
young people as acceptable because we were treated in much the same way,<br/>
and internalized the idea that &quot;that&#39;s the way you treat kids.&quot; For this<br/>
reason, writes Bell, we need to hold adultism up to a strong light.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460537210">Thanks Stephanie.  I enjoyed that very much.  I forwarded it to a friend who is a high school teacher.  I thought it might be a great topic of discussion for her class.  I have always been infuriated over the disrespect shown to little people.  Especially infants.  Their minds to me are amazing and people &quot;goo-goo&quot; at them.  Idiots.  Anyway, I appreciate you sharing this.  I am a big believer in the only way we get the keys to the kingdom of heaven is with the heart of a child.  Perhaps, with freechild.org a few less hearts will be crushed.  Thanks again.<br/>
