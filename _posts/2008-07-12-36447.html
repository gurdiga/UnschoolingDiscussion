<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205053011">**I will keep this thread in mind the next time I discover the socks under <br/>
the couch right AFTER I finished all the laundry.**<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no such thing as finishing the laundry. :) Somewhere, somebody is <br/>
wearing clothes and getting them dirty. <br/>
<br/>
My youngest kids (and last at home) are gone for the summer, my house is very <br/>
quiet, and I&#39;m almost missing their dirty laundry. Last week I went and <br/>
rounded up all the stray cups and mugs and glasses from the parts of the house that <br/>
I don&#39;t visit as much when they&#39;re not inhabiting them. Patrick&#39;s favorite <br/>
Pirate mug was sitting by their computer, and I was weirdly glad to have it to <br/>
pick up and wash. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been putting things on each of their beds that normally I&#39;d be showing <br/>
to them or sharing in some way. It&#39;s kind of fun arranging and rearranging, <br/>
especially picking a spot for the racoon skull! Hah!<br/>
