<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127034094">I have a friend who asked me if I would post a couple of questions here for<br/>
her (she¹s basically an unschooler, but doesn¹t have computer access right<br/>
now). She¹s a single mother (no father in the picture at all for the past<br/>
three years or so) with one boy, 15.5. The boy has been taking long walks at<br/>
night, often leaving the house at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m.. He¹s usually on the<br/>
computer until late, then likes to walk to un-kink, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
My friend doesn¹t like the idea of him being out alone in the wee hours<br/>
(they live in a small town, semi-rural area; he has no friends in the town,<br/>
since they do most of their activities in a large, fairly close-by city),<br/>
but when she told him she thought he shouldn¹t go out after midnight he<br/>
simply informed her he was going to anyway. She doesn¹t know whether to<br/>
press the issue or let it go, hoping the excitement will wear off. They have<br/>
lots of other ³issues² with each other right now and she¹s striving to keep<br/>
conflict to the minimum.<br/>
<br/>
The other question she had was about mixed-sex sleepovers. Her son and his<br/>
new (first) girlfriend are planning a party and want to ask everyone to<br/>
spend the night. The girl¹s parents will be home, but they aren¹t known for<br/>
their supervisory abilities (especially at 3:00 a.m., when their eyes will<br/>
be closed!). She realizes these parties are kind of a trend right now, but<br/>
she isn¹t comfortable with the idea (if the parents of the other kids aren¹t<br/>
either, she might have the reinforcement she needs).<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? I¹m glad most of this stuff is behind me (my girls are 19 and<br/>
21), although now it&#39;s more my having to sit by and watch them go through<br/>
things that I can&#39;t help with, other than to just be a listening ear.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Her son and his<br/>

related to the second...could be he&#39;s going to see her...could be he&#39;s <br/>
pining and can&#39;t sleep...<br/>
<br/>
I have a very sociable, easy-going 17 yo that kind of lost his mind <br/>
during the summer before he was 16.  Girl related, for sure.  All the <br/>
other &quot;issues&quot; I had with him at that time simply disappeared as soon as <br/>
the girl did.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not blaming it on the girl--I blamed it on the intensity of emotion <br/>
he felt and his sort of addiction to it.  <br/>
<br/>
In my city, your friend&#39;s son would be picked up for curfew after <br/>
midnight, and it just wouldn&#39;t be safe for him to be out there.  But, I <br/>
grew up in a small town, and I understand the appeal of being out in the <br/>
solitary and quiet, and often did sneak out.  I would encourage your <br/>
friend to respect his desire to do that, and as long as he&#39;s not getting <br/>
into trouble.  I know what it&#39;s like to really, really want to know <br/>
what&#39;s going on inside a son&#39;s head, but we can&#39;t unless they want us <br/>
to.  I think she&#39;d be better off not to press it, living in a small town <br/>
and all.  <br/>
<br/>
And then I&#39;d be watching like a hawk for signs that maybe he&#39;s not just <br/>
walking.  But that&#39;s just me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405696975">Hi,<br/>
       I&#39;m new here, but it would seem to me that if my son were walking at 1 <br/>
or 2 in the morning, then I would find real work for him to do during the <br/>
day.  Work that would tire his physically so that he would be sleeping, and I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have anything to think about.  I wouldn&#39;t press the issue with him, <br/>
but I would certainly find a way to get him involved with REAL MAN WORK.  He <br/>
is old enough, and obviously capable (no disabilities mentioned).  <br/>
       Does he like plumbing, wood working, gardening, farming, electrical <br/>
work?  I mean, I would see where his interests lie and then find a way for <br/>
him to apprentice someone, or for him to learn it and teach someone else.  <br/>
       About the sleepover, there is no way we would go for that, only <br/>
because we remember being a teenager, and I wouldn&#39;t put my child in a <br/>
situation that would call for EXTRAORDINARY restraint, especially during the <br/>
teenage years!  So many hormones!  So many things going on inside of them <br/>
that I just wouldn&#39;t put them in a situation that would call for that.  I <br/>
would say that he is welcome to have friends over at his house, but not co-ed <br/>
sleepovers.<br/>
       My opinion.  For what it&#39;s worth. <br/>

&lt;&lt; My friend doesn1t like the idea of him being out alone in the wee hours<br/>

<br/>
simply informed her he was going to anyway.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would be afraid of the police bringing my boys home and me getting in <br/>
trouble for them not &quot;being in bed on a schoolnight.&quot;  Since that&#39;s something <br/>
school-families CAN get in trouble with CPS for, and since most CPS folk have <br/>
not a clue about homeschoolers, I don&#39;t want to risk it.  So I tell my boys I <br/>
do NOT want to risk being in trouble and they have to stay inside.<br/>
<br/>
One night a few years back, my husband got up, saw that there were boys (then <br/>
10, 12) awake and told them &quot;Why don&#39;t you go to the park?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The park is three blocks away.  It&#39;s not by a main street.  It&#39;s surrounded <br/>
by residences.  There is an 11:00 or so curfew on park use.  My husband is <br/>
upon occasion not thinking.<br/>
<br/>
The boys thought it was great. <br/>
<br/>
I was horrified.<br/>
<br/>
I would tell the night-cruising boy that no, one of the costs of <br/>
homeschooling is to keep schoolkids&#39; schedules, to some extent.  I might <br/>
probably also put the fear of rape and murder into him (lightly...) and tell <br/>
him that although most perverts prefer girls, there are a few....<br/>
<br/>
My kids are on the other end of the sleepover issue.  They&#39;ve had overnight <br/>
visits since they were little, and kids from the babysitting co-op, and <br/>
neighbors, and many times they were girls.  There was no good time to say <br/>
&quot;Now you&#39;re all too old for this.&quot;  Occasionally after a late night of D&D or <br/>
Anime club there will be a girl among the regular boys.<br/>
<br/>
Although it would have caused heart-attacks in guys my dad&#39;s age, I figure <br/>
the danger is when a teenaged girl is overnighting with a single teenaged <br/>
boy, but if it&#39;s one girl and three or four boys, she&#39;s totally safe.    Dumb <br/>
as it sounds on the outside, it makes sense with this group.<br/>
<br/>
I have a related story to tell.  (Susan&#39;s daughter Kira and I discussed this <br/>
last week, so you might hear it twice, Susan.)<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a house with four girls.  Four teenaged girls all at once.  I <br/>
was well aware of all angles and facets of the behaviors of bad boys, and <br/>
what girls needed to be aware of and careful about, and how evil boys could <br/>
be to girls and how it was a girl&#39;s responsibility, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have boys.  Now I have seen (felt, really) some fears that had never <br/>
occurred to me in my whole life until I saw  my boys in the presence of some <br/>
girls I didn&#39;t trust.<br/>
<br/>
Now I worry about girls who would do just about anything to assert their <br/>
independence from their dads, and if it involved getting knocked up by the <br/>
first guy dumb enough to do her, she wouldn&#39;t hesitate.  And I&#39;ve seen the <br/>
competition between girls for Kirby&#39;s attentions, and I worry about the <br/>
escalating offers of favors if he continues to be his suave, attractive self. <br/>
 (I don&#39;t personally see it--he seems oafish and irritating to me, his mom, <br/>
but even Kira who&#39;s 21 discussed the Kirby-draw.)  I hope the bidding wars <br/>
are never necessary, nor if they start he doesn&#39;t go there.  All his <br/>
girlfriends have been older than he is, and they all (four or five of them, <br/>
depending on whether we count the one long camping weekend deal) initiated <br/>
the social relationship.  <br/>
<br/>
All his friends up to 18, are still virgins.  Even the girls.  He hangs out <br/>
with some older folk, and early-20&#39;s, and college crowd, who fool around (or <br/>
would be willing if opportunity presented--they&#39;re gaming geeks for the most <br/>
part), but they&#39;re not in his range of option yet.<br/>
<br/>
I made it to 17.  My sister made 14.  The cousins in my house...  14 and 15.<br/>
Was it school?  Was it the 60&#39;s/70&#39;s and the atmosphere of <br/>
sex/drugs/rock&#39;n&#39;roll?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve named two girls for my guys to remain clothed at all times with.  I see <br/>
in their eyes--one I&#39;ve seen in action with her (single-parent) dad; the <br/>
other has only a mom with a string of sleepover boyfriends.  Those girls need <br/>
an exit pass.  And they&#39;re both mean in the glance, and mean in the voice.   <br/>
I told the boys (and two of their homeschooling friends) that if a girl gets <br/>
pregnant they have no option.  Their choice is to be a good dad or a bad dad. <br/>
 And it won&#39;t be within their control even what their opportunities to do <br/>
that are, but they will end up being responsible or irresponsible, and living <br/>
with the girl for a long time, or living with the guilt for life.  But that <br/>
one moment can be the end of all their future options.<br/>
<br/>
The other side of that whole coin looks very different.<br/>
<br/>
And now Holly is ten.  Kirby told her last week he doesn&#39;t want her coming to <br/>
Active Imagination if she doesn&#39;t have to.  (That&#39;s their gaming-shop hangout <br/>
and Kirby&#39;s place of employment.   She rarely goes--usually just to deliver <br/>
lunch or pick someone up.)  Why?  What was her sin?   One of the older teens <br/>
had told Kirby, &quot;Dude, your sister is going to be HOT.&quot;<br/>

things...they tend to think boys are the &quot;predators&quot;, but I know that&#39;s <br/>
not always the case.  I have only boys.  My biggest fear when my middle <br/>
was dating that girl was that he wouldn&#39;t say no, because I was pretty <br/>
sure she was willing to say yes.  <br/>
<br/>
My 19 yo son&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s otherwise very strict stepmom took her to <br/>

upstairs to themselves when they&#39;re here from college.  What&#39;s that <br/>
about?  &quot;I&#39;ll take you to get the pill, but I don&#39;t want to know if <br/>
you&#39;re sleeping together.&quot;  (I don&#39;t want to know, either...it&#39;s just <br/>
easier on us all if we don&#39;t pretend and make her take Will&#39;s room.)<br/>

about 17, and we&#39;ve already had some girls following him around and <br/>
calling.  At this point he still seems to be at that yes and no stage about <br/>
girls.  The hormones are clearly raging, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;s interested, but <br/>
it also seems really yucky to him.  (This is my guess.  He&#39;s even less of a <br/>
talker-about-feelings than his dad.)  The one time I heard that he *had* <br/>
met up with a girl at the ball park and spent some time with her that day, <br/>
it seemed all the calls stopped right after.  So he may have been turned <br/>
off by female agression, or simply indicated he wasn&#39;t ready for the mooshy <br/>
mooshy stuff.  I&#39;ll probably never know.  At any rate, now might be a good <br/>
time to talk about the kind of girls you&#39;re referring to.  (and disease and <br/>
pregnancy protection)  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008452911">I used to slip out at night and walk, until I became a<br/>
mother. For miles and miles.  It was dangerous, yes,<br/>
but I did anyway.....and learned how to recognize<br/>
danger in the dark..... and to see the incredible<br/>
beauty that I would have missed sitting under a roof.<br/>
LOTS of physical exercise in the day did not deter me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I have taken the boys (now men,except for<br/>
one) for Night Walks.  Roy and I do this now,<br/>
sometimes, too. A walk with  a teenage son, at night,<br/>
when you don&#39;t have to worry about facial expressions<br/>
and such, can be lovely. A closeness can happen that<br/>
is not possible at other times.<br/>
<br/>
Walking, of itself, isn&#39;t a bad thing. Even at night. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114015886">I know Sandra mentioned other potential natural consequences of sexual<br/>
behavior.  I was simply responding to the one person&#39;s situation because it<br/>
reminded me of my brother.<br/>
<br/>
BTW,  my brother was angry and hurt by the girlfriend&#39;s manipulation.  He<br/>
was able to understand and forgive...but he learned this was not a person he<br/>
wanted to marry.  He is a responsible father.  My nephew is now 11.  My<br/>
brother went on to marry a woman who respects and encourages his<br/>
relationship with his son.  She treats him as her own child...and now my<br/>
brother has 2 more sons.  The boy&#39;s mom struggled for many years to let go<br/>
of the relationship between her and my brother  except as partners in<br/>
parenting.  She has never married (though still young at 30).  It has not<br/>
been an easy road for any of them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone intends to minimize the other problems that sexual<br/>
activity can create....from emotional difficulty to infertility...even death<br/>
(as you&#39;ve seen happen).  I think folks are just relating their thoughts and<br/>
hopes on how to convey messages of responsibility to those in the midst of<br/>
budding sexuality.<br/>

If that is someone&#39;s choice, sure. Many people don&#39;t choose that, so it is a <br/>
good idea to know all the options. I would not presume to tell a young person <br/>

 I made it to 17.  My sister made 14.  The cousins in my house...  14 and 15.<br/>

 sex/drugs/rock&#39;n&#39;roll? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems odd to blame it on school, I was just 14 myself and I think it has<br/>
to do with school vs. home and the years of family separation that it incurs.<br/>
And I think I am and always have been close to my mother.   I don&#39;t <br/>
expect my dd (who is very much like me physically, mentally, emotionally)<br/>
to do what I did.  I think she will have less opportunity and a fuller &<br/>

underage. It gave me a small glimmer of hope.  And Mandy isn&#39;t at all <br/>
like one of those girls Sandra described (but one never knows).  His <br/>
first girlfriend *was* and I did have a frank discussion with him about <br/>
what his goals were (he was in 10th grade) and how I would support him <br/>
if I thought being a &quot;family man&quot; was what he wanted for his life at a <br/>
young age...but that wasn&#39;t something he&#39;d ever expressed an interest <br/>
in--and college, etc., was.  I pointed out that &quot;look&quot; in this girl&#39;s <br/>
eyes (not in so many words).  A few weeks later he said she was sucking <br/>
him dry so he dumped her!  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
But, now that he and Mandy are both adults, it&#39;s really none of my <br/>
business whether they get pregnant or not.  I don&#39;t treat her like her <br/>
stepmother does.  I acknowledge that they are adults and treat them like <br/>
I wish my mom had treated me before I got pregnant at 19.  (There&#39;s not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866186542">Now, understanding that although I was a sexually<br/>
active teenager, I am not the mother of one, and so my<br/>
comments still come with the taint of naivety that<br/>
blessed ignorance brings...<br/>
<br/>
I realize also that the conversation has moved away<br/>
from the original question of co-ed sleepovers to<br/>
teenage sexual activity in general.<br/>
<br/>
I think that group co-ed sleepovers, between<br/>
teens/young adults who are not attracted to each<br/>
other, in a group setting, and where drugs and alcohol<br/>
are not a factor, are *probably* not going to result<br/>
in any sexual situations.  Do you chance it?  Well, if<br/>
you know the kids and the kids families, and it <br/>
<br/>
However, remembering how *I* was from about the age of<br/>
15 on, any &quot;sleep-over&quot; with a boyfriend would have<br/>
resulted in having sex with that boyfriend.  It was a<br/>
given in high school that if you were going steady you<br/>
were having sex.  A result of peer pressure?  Lack of<br/>
training on my parents&#39; part?  Raging hormones? <br/>
Probably a mixture of all three and more.<br/>
<br/>
Given all that, and realizing I am &quot;preaching to the<br/>
choir&quot; here...<br/>
<br/>
Why do we buy into cultural expectations of teens<br/>
being irresponsible, hormone-driven animals? <br/>
Especially about homeschooled teens who supposedly<br/>
have so many more ways to &quot;socialize&quot; and more<br/>
opportunities to interact with others in meaningful,<br/>
productive ways than their schooled (jailed) peers.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, homeschoolers don&#39;t buy into the stuff (that&#39;s<br/>
the polite term) about children suddenly needing to be<br/>
put into the procrustean public school system at age<br/>
5, or needing to be socialized for 13 years with a<br/>
group of 30 children all the same age, so why do we<br/>
buy into the idea that they are in some sort of cocoon<br/>
stage from which they emerge on their 18th birthday<br/>
fully socialized and suddenly functional in society?<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t our children perfectly capable of making<br/>
reasonable and correct decisions before then? <br/>
<br/>
Obviously there are some legal limitations put in<br/>
place that are not in our control.  Beyond that, if we<br/>
have done our jobs as parents to emulate and lead by<br/>
example, as well as explain to them the possible<br/>
results of their actions, can&#39;t we then trust them to<br/>
make good decisions?<br/>

&gt; place that are not in our control.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is precisely what it boils down to, for me.<br/>
<br/>
Before they are 18, I am legally responsible for what happens to them. <br/>
 I was more likely to stick my nose in their business, depending on what <br/>
the business was.  After they are 18, I&#39;m completely hands off, only <br/>
offering advice or opinions when it directly effects me (like with <br/>
regard to the car, whether they live here or whatever).  If it comes <br/>
down to expressing my disapproval and destroying the relationship, or <br/>
keeping my mouth shut and maintaining the relationship, I keep my mouth <br/>
shut.  I have much more influence when we are on good speaking terms <br/>
than if I had insisted on my way or the highway.  I take a long term <br/>
view, and remember well my early late teens and early 20s and the <br/>
problems I had with my parents, and what our relationship is like now.<br/>
<br/>
This has generally been a process, too, that doesn&#39;t just turn on like a <br/>
switch the day they turn 18.  It begins around about the time I become <br/>
aware of their burgeoning adulthood (usually in a state of panic that <br/>
time is running out for me!).  Then I gather my wits and hold on to my <br/>
seat!  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been to college freshman orientation with your kid recently, <br/>
you might have noticed that the first thing they do is separate the <br/>
parents and the students.  The students get a federal form in their <br/>
packet that gives them the ability to give their parents permission to <br/>
get their grades directly from the school.  The parent is automatically <br/>
barred by federal law from getting that information without the <br/>
student&#39;s consent.  My son didn&#39;t fill out the form last year, and I <br/>
didn&#39;t expect him to.  But he did, when he needed me to do something, <br/>
give me the PIN to his student account.<br/>
<br/>
Trust.  It&#39;s all about trust.<br/>

<br/>
Sex is bigger than ever, no doubt about it!! All you have to do is look at the popular fashions, the neck lines are more than plunging and lycra doesn&#39;t leave much to the imagination. Girls in their early 20&#39;s having botox treatments, breast augmentations and liposuction etc.....<br/>
<br/>
Show me a 10 year old who doesn&#39;t know about sex. Brittany Spears makes Barbie look like a puritan! The images that these kids have in their heads from all of the available media is astounding and incomprehensible to anyone raised in the 60&#39;s. As the &#39;cool&#39; mom of a &#39;with it&#39; teen I&#39;ve found that the generation gap is an unavoidable abyss, my kids are on the other side and that&#39;s just the way it is. <br/>
<br/>
What 17yo boy can say no to being seduced by a 17yo gorgeous  (what 17yo girl isn&#39;t gorgeous) girl. Hormones, instinct, overwhelming physical response to stimuli, natural human behavior, I don&#39;t know the answer short of overwhelming religious indoctrination,  fear of hell.......  <br/>
Personally I believe the only way to handle it is give them all of the facts about birth control and disease control and provide them with what they realistically need. Crossing your fingers, closing your eyes or just telling them it&#39;s bad, doesn&#39;t do a dam bit of good.  <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t raise kids without imposed rules and boundaries and then expect to lay down the law when they you get scared. No curfew might mean late night walks or all night dance parties. If we don&#39;t want to tolerate state imposed education why would we use state imposed curfews to do the dirty work for us. <br/>
<br/>
Control is the issue here and even though we might want to believe we aren&#39;t controlling our young ones, we soon become aware of what control really is, when they become teens/adults. We all learn the greatest lessons by making mistakes and there is no time when this fact is more evident than during the teen years. I can tell you from experience that watching your kids make mistakes is a lot harder that making them yourself. I&#39;ve been riding the teen mom roller coaster for 6 years now and I&#39;ve been way up and way down! Now that the ride with my oldest seems to be leveling out Number 2 just turned 12 and he&#39;s going to his friends 14th b-day party this evening, am I worried? I just hope he&#39;s learned some lessons from his big brother!!!  As much as I want to be there for him, be his best friend etc.. I can feel him pulling away, holding some stuff back, becoming a man. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure my now 7yo dd will be the end of me! I knew the moment I saw her that her vulnerability was overwhelming for me. Until then I maintained that there was no difference between sons and daughters. I nursed them all until they were 5, the two younger ones are still in our bed, but they grow up up and away and there really is no holding them back :~(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882240863">&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve seen the <br/>
competition between girls for Kirby&#39;s attentions, and I worry about the<br/>
escalating offers of favors if he continues to be his suave, attractive<br/>
self. <br/>
 (I don&#39;t personally see it--he seems oafish and irritating to me, his mom,<br/>
but even Kira who&#39;s 21 discussed the Kirby-draw.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven¹t spoken much to Kira (my daughter, who¹s traveling and stayed<br/>
briefly with Sandra) in the last couple of weeks, but among the things she<br/>
mentioned when we did talk was Kirby¹s ³draw²! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She needed to catch her next train at 3:45 a.m. to avoid a stopover in El<br/>
Paso; Kirby volunteered to wait up with her, which she thought was really<br/>
sweet of him. I guess they had a great time talking.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I made it to 17.  My sister made 14.  The cousins in my house...  14 and<br/>
15.<br/>
Was it school?  Was it the 60&#39;s/70&#39;s and the atmosphere of<br/>
sex/drugs/rock&#39;n&#39;roll?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughters have often asked me when I ³lost² my virginity (I hate than<br/>
term) and I honestly couldn¹t remember. I told them I thought I was about 19<br/>
or 20. This past week my husband (we¹ve been together since we were 16-17)<br/>
was digging through some old stuff and came across his high school diary.<br/>
There, in black and white, we discovered we ³made it² to 18! (Or, we ³made<br/>
it² AT 18!)<br/>
