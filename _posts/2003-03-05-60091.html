&lt;&lt; But sometimes it all falls apart in chaos and I resort to &quot;We are going to <br/>
get this disaster cleaned up right now, I&#39;m going crazy!!&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had one of those lately, but I did, in December when we were going <br/>
to have house guests and I was still QUITE gimpy, say &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll go <br/>
crazy if I don&#39;t get this ready in time,&quot; so I just sort of declared the <br/>
possibility of future melt-down and they helped a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, did you ask the kids why things went the way they did when their friends <br/>
were there?<br/>
<br/>
My guess just from your account was that they were exhausted from having <br/>
company, that they were all sped up and zippy and when the company left they <br/>
were vegging out.   Maybe they were kind of subconsciously showing off for <br/>
their friends that the rules are relaxed at your house these days.  I doubt <br/>
they thought it, but maybe they were kind of celebrating the new deal <br/>
(accidently, without realizing it would hurt your feelings and peace).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not.<br/>
