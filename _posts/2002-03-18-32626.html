full of life, questioning and ever continuing. However, it may not contain<br/>

He&#39;ll be able to read and write, compute numbers, have an idea of what has<br/>
occured over time (history), a general idea of how our society functions,<br/>
and a sense of the natural world. My opinion is that his attitude and<br/>
outlook on life may be VERY different depending on how he gets there. and<br/>
also his happiness.<br/>
Unfortunately they believe if he would just OBEY, everything would be great.<br/>
(I agree, great for THEM! Horrible for Zack)<br/>

Beatifully put, Elissa. I thought that was what you meant. :o) Eighteen <br/>
years is such a long time to acquire a very basic knowledge of the world, <br/>
isn&#39;t it? I never understand why schools think they have to start so young <br/>
and cram it so hard.<br/>
