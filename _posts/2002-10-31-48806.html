with short but pleasant spring and fall.  <br/>

My husband went there for a six month project.  Nearly four years later I <br/>
asked him to please PLEASE just come back home.  At first, we visited him <br/>
quarterly.  After a while the visits were too expensive and the kids weren&#39;t <br/>
liking the long plane rides.  So some of our free quarterly family visits we <br/>
bypassed.  He got to come home monthly, and so used to work ten hour days so <br/>
he could have a full week and two weekends home.  So my view of Minnesota, <br/>
althought sampled throughout three years, was still as a New Mexican visiting <br/>
for a few days.<br/>
