<div id="ygrps-yiv-268427522"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can people with ADD get excused from jury duty? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could never concentrate on *anything* for that long.  I would be<br/>
&gt; doodling, staring out the window, twirling my hair.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I pity the poor defendant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to the doc on Friday hoping for a medical excuse.  Otherwise I<br/>
have to be available to serve on civil trials in Feb.  I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
having to sit still for that long.  I have to be able to get up and walk<br/>
around whenever I need to, or I start looking for the Tin Woodman&#39;s oil can.<br/>
Then there&#39;s the brain fog.  Once I get tired, clear thinking is nearly<br/>
impossible.  And memory ceases to exist.<br/>
