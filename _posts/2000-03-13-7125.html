<div id="ygrps-yiv-276078833">Thanks everyone who helped me clarify unschooling.  I didn&#39;t realize that<br/>
was what I was already doing.  It&#39;s amazing to me that when I just go with<br/>
the flow of things, I always seem to do it right.  (Or at least IMO it&#39;s<br/>
what is right).  I think unschooling is what will work best for our family.<br/>
 It seems to make the most sense.  I bet their are lots of homeschooling<br/>
families who are unschooling but don&#39;t even know it.  Kind of like<br/>
attachment parenting, tons of people practice it, but don&#39;t know there&#39;s a<br/>
name for it.<br/>
<br/>
I am also delighted there are so many of you breastfeeding moms and<br/>
advocates.  Like Amy, I am also working on my LLL accredidation.  I have<br/>
been nursing my oldest daughter for 4 1/2 years now and my younger daughter<br/>
just turned 2 and she&#39;s still nursing.  All the stories and advice you gave<br/>
to Melanie sounded just right.  I would have put in my 2 cents too, but you<br/>
guys said it all.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am glad to be on this list, and hope to learn lots more from you<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
Carli</div>
