&lt;&lt;  It&#39;s my <br/>
fault that I mixed evolution in with what I originally intended to <br/>
say on this unschooling list.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Review for me what you ORIGINALLY intended to say on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Are you unschooling?<br/>
How old are your children?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because this whole evolution discussion came out of someone sweetly <br/>
encouraging women to breastfeed their babies and sleep with them, wasn&#39;t it?  <br/>
And then we were swept away into how old the earth was.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to go back before the Biblical arguments and see who and what <br/>
we&#39;re dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve unschooled since Kirby was old enough to go to kindergarten and didn&#39;t <br/>
go.  I would like to talk about unschooling, about parenting in such a way <br/>
that learning comes easily.  I&#39;m not interested in this being a list about <br/>
Christianity.  To answer questions is one thing, to be mired in muck for over <br/>
a week is not any good for anybody.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Review for me what you ORIGINALLY intended to say on this list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This thread of old vs. young earth started with two posts by you <br/>
about how people can be led around like sheep into believing in a <br/>
young earth.  I originally intended to say, on this thread, that <br/>
thinking people can believe such a thing, included many credentialed <br/>
scientists.  In saying that, I unintentionally added a reference to <br/>
evolution in general, which you had not mentioned. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you unschooling?<br/>
&gt; How old are your children?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My wife is currently not unschooling, but she is getting fed up with <br/>
the army method of raising kids, so I am encouraging her to consider <br/>
a number of the methods and hints I&#39;ve read on this list.  Her mother <br/>
became alcoholic in her 40s and her father was gone a lot (two-time <br/>
Air Force sergeant), so she didn&#39;t have a great role model.<br/>
<br/>
We have a 29yo daughter in Texas, happily married with two boys: 34 <br/>
months and 18 months.  They are all coming to visit us soon.  We also <br/>
have a girl 9 and two boys 11 and 7. They are lively, active, and <br/>
happy.  They play well with other kids or among themselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your two posts were from late 11/3, so this thread (renamed as you <br/>
requested) has been on for less than two days.  It&#39;s not a thread on <br/>
Christianity.  I took issue with your calling people who have certain <br/>
beliefs &quot;sheep&quot; who teach their children &quot;false history and made-up <br/>
science.&quot;  I don&#39;t think that is fair to them and that was the whole <br/>
purpose of my replying to your posts.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, congratulations on having a son who out-alpha&#39;ed the <br/>
alpha male.  These days, that&#39;s an accomplishment.<br/>

here if you are not the one involved in the education of your children?<br/>
<br/>
We are questioners by nature, which is what led us to unschooling.  We are <br/>
not followers.  You will not convert people on this list.  <br/>

<br/>
Can you please do that without arguing the age of the earth with us? Without <br/>
talking about abortion?  How I feel about propaganda shouldn&#39;t affect the <br/>
benefit you might derive from this list if you read it instead of derailing <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

It didn&#39;t make him happy.  He was so disappointed with the whole group he&#39;s <br/>
reconsidering his friendship with the hostess.  <br/>
