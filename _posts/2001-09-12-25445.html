<div id="ygrps-yiv-823320084">When I despair, I remember that all through history, the way of truth and <br/>
love has always won. There have been murderers and tyrants, and for a time <br/>
they can seem invincible. But in the end they always fall. Think of it, <br/>
always.<br/>
-Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948)hi (1869-1948)<br/>
