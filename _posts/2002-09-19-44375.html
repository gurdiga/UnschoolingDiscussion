Yes, he chose the teachers. They were not imposed on him by some higher <br/>
authority. I  think it isn&#39;t quite self taught in the truest sense, but then <br/>
nothing would be if you had to exclude other teachers, books, resources. One <br/>
could reasonably argue that it is self teaching when a person chooses exactly <br/>
when, where and how they learn. Which is what he did. Semantics <br/>
perhaps.....but I still think of it as self taught.<br/>
