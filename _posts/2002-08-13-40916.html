<div id="ygrps-yiv-89805937">This was just posted to the New Mexico list<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Rio Grande Homescooling Network has its website and a downloadable <br/>
conference registration form online at www.rghomeschooling.org - check it out <br/>
and let us know what you think!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This site is BRAND new and so there are still a couple of glitches, but if <br/>
those of you with New Mexico resource lists could add it that would be great. <br/>
 And if you have any homeschooling friends in New Mexico, please let them <br/>
know about this because typical of the cultural and geographical realities of <br/>
New Mexicans, we&#39;re living in a degree of happy isolation.  Sometimes it <br/>
takes a year for word to get around about something, and we only have a few <br/>
weeks  until the conference.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
