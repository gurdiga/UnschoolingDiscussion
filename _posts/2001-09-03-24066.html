beautiful house on a hill overlooking the ocean).  She and all her siblings<br/>
speak Portugeuse.  She has neices and nephews about your dd&#39;s age.  They<br/>
might be interested in a pen pal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246368975">Noemi,<br/>
My son, nine years old, is wild about Japan and Japanese culture.  We<br/>
purchased a Japanese language course and are doing our best to learn it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would be very interested in exchanging materials with you.  If you&#39;d<br/>
like to contact me privately and let me know what you are looking for<br/>
I&#39;ll see what I can do.  <br/>
<br/>
We received an amazing amount a free educational materials from the<br/>
Japanese Consulate.   Maybe that  would be a good resource for you to<br/>
find Portuguese materials. <br/>
The Consulates often have free lending libraries of language books, <br/>
videos and even music selections.  All you pay is the return postage. <br/>
Check to see if there is a Portuguese  consulate in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list!<br/>
