<div id="ygrps-yiv-355525531">&lt;&lt;Those individuals within a species who have the least desirable <br/>
environment are most likely to grow less and reproduce earlier.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This makes pretty good sense from a reproductive standpoint. If the <br/>
environment is unstable, you may not be around long enough to reproduce if <br/>
you wait. Hmmm...sounds like one of those evolutionary traits that we humans <br/>
have, but don&#39;t realize it. Like the need to seek out fatty foods. (That&#39;s a <br/>
personal evolutionary trait BTW. ;-))<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
