My cousin&#39;s was Merrifield and when she had to learn to spell it I <br/>

There&#39;s a rare surname in New Mexico that is           C de Baca<br/>
It&#39;s old, and pronounced &quot;see de Baca&quot; but is short for Cabeza de Baca.   <br/>
Nobody has used it that way for a long time--hundred years?).<br/>
<br/>
Martinez is very commonly abbreviated &quot;Mtz.&quot; even though it&#39;s not so long but <br/>
people will see that and say &quot;Martinez.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Manzanares and Jaramillo are the only other very long names I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
(form-filling-wise) but England and Spain might be the places to look for <br/>
overly-long and hyphenated last names.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789147277">A &#39;school at home&#39; friend of mine named her daughter &quot;Jessica Katarina&quot; &quot; Blankensopp&quot;<br/>
Very pretty... but I felt so sorry for the little girl when her mom was making her write it over and over at age 6.<br/>
Not sure where Blankensopp originanated from, her father has a lot of Native American in him.<br/>
