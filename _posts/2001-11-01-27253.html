I think that I am too lazy and don&#39;t care enough to do more research on the<br/>
subject, but my image of Patty has changed. I never questioned if she was a<br/>
victim. I just always thought it was awful that no one pardoned her before<br/>
Clinton. So you really think she made up all of the rape and closet stories?<br/>
Those stories seemed like something  only a real victim could tell.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475890974">All pure unadulterated bs.  Nancy said she couldn&#39;t believe the stories<br/>
&quot;that girl comes up with.&quot;  Everyone said she came by her talents naturally<br/>
(newspapers, etc.) and she bombed out pamphlet copy in minutes that would<br/>
take other folks days, weeks or even months to come up with.<br/>
<br/>
One of her comments during one of her People&#39;s Park speaches was &quot;rape<br/>
sells,&quot; so none of us took too much notice of her accusations.<br/>
