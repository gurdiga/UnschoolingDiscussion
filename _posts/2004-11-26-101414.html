<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142946975">While shopping this morning (at 5 a.m.) I found a LOTR Risk game.  This <br/>
combines two of our &quot;guys&quot; favorite things, and will be great for parties <br/>
(maybe the &quot;girls&quot; will even join in, cuz we all like LOTR).  Dh and his <br/>
friends in high school made giant Risk boards and my oldest ds gave him one <br/>
on plywood a few years ago.  The younger boys , ages 10, 12, and 14 all love <br/>
it too, and they all stay up for hours playing it.  But this new one has <br/>
Middle Earth!!  I think I found one present that is sure to be a hit! :&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
They might even want to dress up and play the parts. Last December, two of <br/>
the boys were in children&#39;s theater The Hobbit (Thorin and Goblin Captain) <br/>
so they have some costume parts and props already...<br/>
