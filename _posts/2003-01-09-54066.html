<div id="ygrps-yiv-405288506">My daughter is 17, very intelligent and artistic. (Aren&#39;t all <br/>
unschoolers.)  She has decided not to go to college at this time, but <br/>
is very interested in going to a beauty school to be a hairdresser.  <br/>
She loves the creative nature of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, she got the application for the school and it said you <br/>
must have a GED or diploma.  She was really stressed.  I said don&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
Check out these archived columns from Home Education Magazine:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How Do We Know When We&#39;re Done?&quot; by Cafi Cohen. You can read it free <br/>
at this page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/HEM154.98/154.98_clmn_ok.html">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/HEM154.98/154.98_clmn_ok.html</a><br/>
  An excerpt: If you attend high school, it&#39;s simple. From roughly the <br/>
ages of 14-18, you sit in a chair six hours a day for 180 days each <br/>
year. You study carefully balanced amounts of English, math, social <br/>
studies, and science, and take extras like foreign language, physical <br/>
education, and drama. Do all that with passing grades, and they give <br/>
you a diploma.<br/>
             But how do homeschooling families decide when their <br/>
teenagers have completed high school? What combination of academic <br/>
work, accomplishment, and time is enough?<br/>
        How do families evaluate their teenager&#39;s learning and decide <br/>
What&#39;s Enough?<br/>

  An excerpt: How do homeschoolers get high school diplomas and other <br/>
credentials?&quot; The question is not a new one. We&#39;ve asked ourselves <br/>
and other people have certainly asked us. However, recent <br/>
developments are making the answer more complicated than it used to <br/>
be, in some ways limiting the options available to homeschoolers who <br/>
want conventional credentials.<br/>
             Should we homeschoolers be worried about getting <br/>
conventional credentials? Are homeschoolers&#39; futures jeopardized <br/>
because the path to a conventional diploma is less clear-cut than it <br/>
is for a student in a conventional school? Why and how is the process <br/>
of getting a diploma becoming more complex? What choices do we have? <br/>
This column will address these questions.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re still interested in obtaining a diploma, there&#39;s a good <br/>
list of diploma programs at this site:<br/>

The Homeschool Diploma<br/>
*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*<br/>
<br/>
What is a diploma anyway?  Here is a dictionary definition for you. . .<br/>
<br/>
diploma: a document certifying the successful completion of a course <br/>
of study [Source: WordNet ® 1.6, © 1997 Princeton University]<br/>
<br/>
      A diploma is a piece of paper (unless you use real sheepskin) <br/>
that designates or confers the completion of some line of study.  We <br/>
find it interesting that parents who home school, and do so <br/>
confidently, turn to jelly when it is time to award a diploma.  If <br/>
you have home schooled your child and they have completed your <br/>
designated course of study for high school, you may and should award <br/>
a diploma.<br/>
      The issue is not whether you may award a diploma, but what does <br/>
that diploma mean to others?  There are several considerations here. <br/>
In many states, including New York, the state mandates that only the <br/>
State Board of Education (in NY, the board of Regents) is authorized <br/>
to grant a diploma. That is their opinion.  We do award our children <br/>
diplomas, and though the state may not recognize them as &quot;accredited&quot; <br/>
this does not mean much to us. After all, we know plenty of people <br/>
who hold those accredited diplomas who could not pass the <br/>
requirements to receive one of our diplomas!<br/>
      Frankly, we both hold those accredited and coveted New York <br/>
Regent&#39;s High School Diplomas, and neither of us has had to show them <br/>
to anyone, ever.  We have been hired by employers, accepted into <br/>
prestigious colleges (MIT and the Air Force Academy) and those <br/>
diplomas did not enter the picture.  What did matter was our <br/>
transcript and college board exam scores. The official transcript is <br/>
the official record of the student&#39;s course work and grades.  The <br/>
transcript will be validated by college board exams and sometimes <br/>
with a portfolio of completed work.<br/>
      So, will a home school diploma allow our students to get jobs, <br/>
enter college, receive financial aid, or join the military?  It is <br/>
true that in the past most colleges required those accredited pieces <br/>
of paper.  However, the current climate is quickly changing in favor <br/>
of the home school. Colleges and universities are beginning to <br/>
recognize that home school students are generally very well prepared <br/>
for higher learning, regardless of their lack of &quot;accredited&quot; <br/>
education.  There are now research studies that indicate the academic <br/>
success of home school programs, and the success of home school <br/>
students in institutions of higher learning.<br/>
      In the past, some institutions required a GED or a <br/>
state-accredited diploma for admission.  The United States House of <br/>
Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce and Senate <br/>
Committee on Labor and Human Resources addressed these colleges and <br/>
universities in a report accompanying Pub.L. No. 105-244 <br/>
(Reauthoriztion of the Higher Education Act) with the following <br/>
recommendation to those that accept federal funding: The Committee is <br/>
aware that many colleges and universities now require applicants from <br/>
non-public, private, or non-traditional secondary programs (including <br/>
home schools) to submit scores from additional standardized tests . . <br/>
. (GED or SAT-II) in lieu of a transcript/diploma from an accredited <br/>
high school . . . Given that standardized test scores (SAT and ACT) <br/>
and portfolio- or performance-based assessments may also provide a <br/>
sound basis for an admission decision regarding these students, the <br/>
Committee recommends that colleges and universities consider using <br/>
these assessments for applicants educated in non-public, private, and <br/>
non-traditional programs rather than requiring them to undergo <br/>
additional types of standardized testing.  Requiring additional <br/>
testing only of students educated in these settings could reasonably <br/>
be seen as discriminatory . . .<br/>
      The Committee believes that college admissions should be <br/>
determined on academic ability of the student and not the <br/>
accreditation status of the school in which he or she received a <br/>
secondary education.<br/>
      Clearly, our Congress recognizes the discriminatory practice of <br/>
requiring home schooled students to obtain a GED.  This practice has <br/>
unnerved many home schoolers since we find the GED requirements to be <br/>
an insult to the fine education our children have received.<br/>
      In another section of the Amendments sited above, the Committees <br/>
changed the eligibility requirements for federal college financial <br/>
aid.  The law used to require an accredited high school diploma, GED, <br/>
or a semester of college work to prove eligibility for aid.  Now the <br/>
requirement has changed to include those students who have &quot;completed <br/>
a secondary school education in a home school setting that is treated <br/>
as a home school or private school under state law.&quot;<br/>
      These advances in the recognition of the effectiveness of home <br/>
schools are very promising.  Already two states have enacted <br/>
legislation to restrict discrimination of home school students, <br/>
others are sure to follow.      The military has also changed its <br/>
policies about requiring the GED for home schooled students.<br/>
      Employers will accept a transcript, or they will accept a home <br/>
school diploma.  The reality is, job applications will usually ask <br/>
what school was attended and whether the person graduated.  The home <br/>
school student should just write in &quot;home school&quot; and say they did <br/>
graduate.<br/>
      Lets face it, when we decided to home school, we believed we <br/>
were able to do a good job of educating our children.  We believed <br/>
that we would do better than the government sponsored schools, and <br/>
better than private schools.  (If you do not believe this, you have <br/>
no business home schooling!) Why would we not believe, then, that our <br/>
home school diploma is better than a government diploma?<br/>
      Home school coalitions in some states (for instance <br/>
Pennsylvania) have worked with the state department of education to <br/>
provide a program for home schooled students to obtain a <br/>
state-accredited diploma.  This may be of interest to you.  To be <br/>
honest, we find these efforts counter-productive. We do not recognize <br/>
the state as the ultimate authority in determining what constitutes a <br/>
&quot;good education.&quot;  Therefore, we do not feel the state-accredited <br/>
diploma is of real value.  The essence of home schooling is that it <br/>
is parent-directed.  It follows than that it should be <br/>
parent-accredited.  Colleges, universities, financial aid programs, <br/>
and potential employers are quickly realizing the value of the home <br/>
school diploma, and accreditation is becoming a non-issue.<br/>
      So, where do you get this piece of paper?  You print it <br/>
yourself, or order it from a printer.  There, that was simple! <br/>
Actually, there are organizations that sell diplomas especially for <br/>
home school use, that you can personalize yourself for the graduate. <br/>
Some of these come with very nice covers as well.<br/>

wanted to do) and some spelling. We have continued to talk about it <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248321300">Well, start her out doing what she wants to do: taking courses and getting <br/>
grades. Education Direct is a two or three year course, and is a bit pricey. <br/>
Myself, I wouldn&#39;t spend that kind of money unless I and my kid were really <br/>
committed to doing the work and finishing it. (speaking from the experience <br/>
of having enrolled my oldest in a distance school, and then dropping it when <br/>
we realized how boring and lame that particular distance school managed to <br/>
make EVERY subject. CLASS blech. That little side-trail cost us almost $500)<br/>
<br/>
So, anyway. Start her out doing it how she wants to do it. I think it would <br/>
run counter to Unschooling&#39;s principles to say &quot;we ARE unschooling, like it <br/>
or not, young lady. No, you may not take classes. No, you may not earn <br/>
grades.&quot; LOL<br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s a book out there. A fiction piece, about an unschooling <br/>
family. Life with the???? I can&#39;t remember, but in the book, everyone is <br/>
this free spirit, artistic type, except one girl, who creates projects for <br/>
herself to do, such as discovering and labeling all the varieties of <br/>
butterfly in the nearby meadow, and writing a paper on the project, etc. She <br/>
does all kinds of schoolish things on her own. Her parents simply won&#39;t <br/>
assign things, so she takes it on herself. I can&#39;t think what on earth could <br/>
possibly be wrong with a kid pushing herself academically and jumping <br/>
herself through all the hoops. Some people thrive on that kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;ll keep on desiring it strongly and pushing herself in every <br/>
subject &quot;they&quot; hand down, or maybe she&#39;ll find out that she can relax and do <br/>
the things that she is deeply interested in, not just to have a mark on a <br/>
paper, but for the love of it. And skip the rest.<br/>
<br/>

When we first decided to take Cameron out of school, Ben gave me _The <br/>
Well-Trained Mind_ as a Mother&#39;s Day present (for the new <br/>
homeschooling-mom-to-be).<br/>
<br/>
I read it and was THRILLED! THAT was was *I* would have wanted to <br/>
do---well, that and ride horses and train dogs! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would have thrived on it, yes. But I knew it wasn&#39;t for my children. <br/>
They&#39;re smarter than I am! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569099979">Thats just it she may not finish it and she is so<br/>
worried about getting her High School Diploma.... Got<br/>
any suggestions on how to explain the diploma thing to<br/>
her better? She has plans of just supporting herself<br/>
enough to do full time ministry work (which working at<br/>
Mcdonalds..... is not going to be enough to support<br/>
herself and the other full time) and later be a<br/>
missionary or what our belief calls a special pioneer<br/>
in a foreign country. Maybe We are just all wrong in<br/>
our thinking.?????<br/>

&gt; Myself, I wouldn&#39;t spend that kind of money unless I<br/>
&gt; and my kid were really <br/>
&gt; committed to doing the work and finishing it.<br/>
&gt; (speaking from the experience <br/>
&gt; of having enrolled my oldest in a distance school,<br/>
&gt; and then dropping it when <br/>
&gt; we realized how boring and lame that particular<br/>
&gt; distance school managed to <br/>
&gt; make EVERY subject. CLASS blech. That little<br/>
&gt; side-trail cost us almost $500)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, anyway. Start her out doing it how she wants to<br/>
&gt; do it. I think it would <br/>
&gt; run counter to Unschooling&#39;s principles to say &quot;we<br/>
&gt; ARE unschooling, like it <br/>
&gt; or not, young lady. No, you may not take classes.<br/>
&gt; No, you may not earn <br/>
&gt; grades.&quot; LOL<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, there&#39;s a book out there. A fiction piece,<br/>
&gt; about an unschooling <br/>
&gt; family. Life with the???? I can&#39;t remember, but in<br/>
&gt; the book, everyone is <br/>
&gt; this free spirit, artistic type, except one girl,<br/>
&gt; who creates projects for <br/>
&gt; herself to do, such as discovering and labeling all<br/>
&gt; the varieties of <br/>
&gt; butterfly in the nearby meadow, and writing a paper<br/>
&gt; on the project, etc. She <br/>
&gt; does all kinds of schoolish things on her own. Her<br/>
&gt; parents simply won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; assign things, so she takes it on herself. I can&#39;t<br/>

&gt; possibly be wrong with a kid pushing herself<br/>
&gt; academically and jumping <br/>
&gt; herself through all the hoops. Some people thrive on<br/>
&gt; that kind of thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe she&#39;ll keep on desiring it strongly and<br/>
&gt; pushing herself in every <br/>
&gt; subject &quot;they&quot; hand down, or maybe she&#39;ll find out<br/>
&gt; that she can relax and do <br/>
&gt; the things that she is deeply interested in, not<br/>
&gt; just to have a mark on a <br/>
&gt; paper, but for the love of it. And skip the rest.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Subject: Diploma<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In December my 16 yr old was having problems at<br/>
&gt; school.<br/>
&gt; &gt;We all agreed that she would be better off home<br/>
&gt; schooling, we decided<br/>
&gt; &gt;that we would take things slow and work on algebra,<br/>
&gt; Spanish (which she<br/>
&gt; &gt;wanted to do) and some spelling. We have continued<br/>
&gt; to talk about it<br/>
&gt; &gt;and then we ran across the unschool concept. My<br/>
&gt; husband and I feel<br/>
&gt; &gt;that this is the best avenue for both of our<br/>
&gt; children, yet we can not<br/>
&gt; &gt;get it through her head. All we here is I cant get<br/>
&gt; my diploma that way-<br/>
&gt; &gt;on and on and on she goes. We have told her that<br/>
&gt; she can still take<br/>
&gt; &gt;college courses all she has to do is continue to<br/>
&gt; learn the things that<br/>
&gt; &gt;she is interested in and pass the examines that<br/>
&gt; they would require her<br/>
&gt; &gt;to take in order to enroll in the courses she is<br/>
&gt; interested in.She is<br/>
&gt; &gt;determined it seems. She wants to enroll in<br/>
&gt; Education Direct.What do<br/>
&gt; &gt;we do, what do we say?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

it&#39;s possible that there could be instances in which nothing was wrong, I can <br/>
think of several things right off the bat that COULD &quot;possibly&quot; be wrong with a <br/>
kid pushing herself academically.<br/>
WHY is she doing it?  Who is she trying to please, in case it&#39;s not just only <br/>
herself?<br/>
If she thinks that will make her happy, why does she think that?  Is there a <br/>
fallback position if she doesn&#39;t cure cancer or colonize Mars?  What if she&#39;s <br/>
&quot;just a housewife&quot; a few years up the road.  Will she have a dearth of self <br/>
esteem, or so much debt she could&#39;ve bought a big house and will then have to <br/>
live in an apartment?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stop there and let readers continue the list in their own minds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-694157896">Thank You She has been so schooled its just stuck in<br/>
her head that it has to be that way yet she has made<br/>
it well know to us that she does not want to go back<br/>
to public school.her bio-mom drop out at 9th grade, so<br/>
before she moved in with my husband and I her mother<br/>
had her convinced that she would never do anything<br/>
with her life and would be a drop out( as she terms<br/>
it) like her (like her mom couldnt do anything else<br/>
for herself) my daughter does not have much confidence<br/>
in herself. We believe that unschooling can help her<br/>
in this way and others.<br/>
If she doesnt feel she will succeed with unschooling,<br/>
how does she plan to apply herself in a homeschool<br/>
program? As i said thanks Sandra.<br/>

------------------------<br/>
Uh.... well....<br/>
You have met me.<br/>
 <br/>
I can easily forget to buy groceries, or forget all about the concept of  <br/>
&quot;dinner&quot; until it&#39;s later than most humans eat.   My encyclopedias are  in <br/>
alphabetical order, and all my multi-volume collections are in order on the  shelf, <br/>
but that doesn&#39;t save me from other frightful disorganizational  sins.<br/>
 <br/>
When I was pregnant with Kirby and being angsty, I told a friend &quot;I&#39;m  afraid <br/>
I&#39;ll forget to feed him.&quot;  She laughed and said that would never  happen.  It <br/>
did.  While he was nursing and I was carrying him around,  that was easy.  <br/>
And because we gave him food when he asked for it, he was  pretty much <br/>
self-service boy.  But for instance Holly has been playing Halo  II a lot, and can be <br/>
in there for hours and she forgets to eat and I forget to  offer her food some <br/>
days.  A couple of times that has resulted in a cranky  13 year old girl, and <br/>
for those who have never yet been on the parental end  of a 13 year old girl <br/>
and might someday, I will say this:  FEED HER.   For the good of all involved, <br/>
don&#39;t let her get hungry to the point of  melt-down.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have the same experience. I forget to eat - and I get cranky, too. It <br/>
is worse when I also forget to offer food to my teenage girls. Whew!<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re learning to take the time to eat, even when absorbed in <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
So am I.<br/>
<br/>
And, Betsy, I had to laugh at your &quot;miffed&quot; post. Years ago I had Nancy <br/>
Wooten (hi Nancy) over at my house with her daughter,  for a night or <br/>
two. I can&#39;t remember how old her daughter was - but I&#39;m thinking maybe <br/>
11 or 12 - and she couldn&#39;t stand my disastrously disorganized <br/>
bookshelves - books stuffed in every which way - so she spent quite a <br/>
bit of time organizing them for me. I THINK she enjoyed it. (I don&#39;t <br/>
have a hardcopy encyclopedia - but my History of US set of books is all <br/>
out of order, I&#39;m sure.)<br/>
