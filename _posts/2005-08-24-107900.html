<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423900402">I wish I had saved some more quotes from side conversations over the summer.  <br/>
 There were some good ones, and I had been meaning to bring up the idea of <br/>
helping kids get along in the world.   The paraphrase of it all in general is <br/>
that some people seem to use unschooling as an excuse to do LESS with and for <br/>
their children, rather than more.   Some people seem to see unschooling out of <br/>
the corner of their eye and glom onto it as a way to justify their inability or <br/>
unwillingness to really see their kids directly and help them learn to live <br/>
and act in ways that will benefit them (the children) and others.<br/>
<br/>
That, I think, is a distraction and a disservice to those unschooling who can <br/>
and want to really create a totally nurturing life in which their children <br/>
can thrive.   <br/>
<br/>
I do have one quote: <br/>
&quot;While I totally understand that most parents need to become *way* more<br/>
child-centered and discussions of limits and boundaries are not terribly<br/>
useful for getting to radical unschooling, sometimes the pendulum seems<br/>
to go too far in that direction, imo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There have been others, similar.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t encourage or support or think lovely thoughts about people who want <br/>
to ignore their children&#39;s needs and say &quot;because I&#39;m an unschooler,&quot; and it <br/>
seems that some of this discussion of judgement is a cover for that kind of <br/>
hands-off &quot;parenting.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there are some parents who definitely do that. Sometimes, too, <br/>
however, I think it&#39;s more a difference in the definition of &quot;need.&quot; <br/>
Over on the AU list, people advocating an NVC (non-violent <br/>
communication) approach were very much attuned and focused on their <br/>
child&#39;s underlying needs--whatever need was behind the behavior--and <br/>
meeting those needs, whether it be more time and attention, more <br/>
outings, more food, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Rather, there was dissent about whether a child&#39;s &quot;needs&quot; also include <br/>
receiving information about the wider world&#39;s potential reaction to the <br/>
chosen expression of the need, or the parent&#39;s reaction, or the <br/>
sibling&#39;s reaction, whatever, in evaluative terms. The dilemma seemed to <br/>
me to be over whether a parent choosing to offer personal opinions and <br/>
judgments when the child hadn&#39;t asked was consistent with unschooling. <br/>
Or whether this were the same kind of thing as &quot;teachable moments,&quot; <br/>
demonstrating a lack of trust in the child&#39;s own discerning powers and <br/>
ability to learn about the world.<br/>
<br/>
There also was some discussion over whether it were productive to say <br/>
&quot;hitting hurts&quot; when the child clearly already received that information <br/>
but was still choosing to hit as a way of getting his needs met. Is it <br/>
more productive to ignore the hitting and meet the need, trusting that <br/>
the child knows hitting hurts and will eventually find other <br/>
expressions, or to meet the need *and* have a brief discussion (either <br/>
in the moment or as a later follow-up) about better ways to meet the <br/>
need, such as &quot;Hitting hurts. Can we come up with another way to get my <br/>
attention/ your sister&#39;s attention/ whatever?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, I didn&#39;t see this discussion as an instance of the &quot;hands-off&quot; <br/>
parenting, though I do know what Sandra&#39;s describing and chafe at that <br/>
as well.<br/>

(judgment of better/worse)?<br/>
<br/>
-=-The dilemma seemed to<br/>

<br/>
I think withholding information is inconsistent with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that unschooling is doing nothing until a child asks (for math <br/>
information, reading help or feedback about social realities) is at odds with the <br/>
creation of a rich learning environment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Or whether this were the same kind of thing as &quot;teachable moments,&quot;<br/>

ability to learn about the world.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I suppose my child could learn about the world if I were catatonic, but it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be any good for the relationship between me and my child.    Are people <br/>
advocating not HAVING a relationship with the child past buying groceries and <br/>
paying for the electricity?<br/>
<br/>
-=-There also was some discussion over whether it were productive to say<br/>
&quot;hitting hurts&quot; when the child clearly already received that information<br/>
but was still choosing to hit as a way of getting his needs met.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever productive to say &quot;hitting hurts.&quot;<br/>
I think it&#39;s criminal to allow a child to continue to hit   It hurts everyone <br/>
involved--parent, hitter and hittee, and whether it&#39;s physical danger or just <br/>
harm to integrity and peace, it&#39;s harm.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is it more productive to ignore the hitting and meet the need-=-<br/>
<br/>
Hitting can be prevented by getting the child in a target-poor environment, <br/>
by meeting his need, by calming him down.    But learning not to hit is a VERY <br/>
real need (unless the parents are just planning to have the kid around between <br/>
now and when he goes to live in prison or a mental hospital).   He can learn <br/>
to live with other people, or he will have that privilege removed.   The <br/>
parents have only a few years to do what they can to help him live with other <br/>
people.   After that it&#39;s not their call anymore whether their offspring have <br/>
freedom and choices or not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, in my mind, unschooling kids are living and learning in the world <br/>
by experimenting and exploring and getting real feedback. If we take <br/>
away that real feedback, it&#39;s kind of like hiding part of the data from <br/>
a scientist while still expecting him to draw the same rational <br/>
conclusions that require the whole set of data. I think withholding our <br/>
genuine reactions is akin to kids only having access to a partial data set.<br/>
<br/>
I believe withholding information based on our best experience and <br/>
judgment and expecting kids to learn from others what they could have <br/>
learned more gently with us is unnecessary and potentially cruel, quite <br/>
frankly.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see dealing with such scenarios as they naturally occur through <br/>
life with our children as bearing any similarity to sitting down to <br/>
create a lesson plan that covers such things.  Moreover, &quot;giving them a <br/>
good lesson&quot; is a loaded expression that generally refers to some kind <br/>
of nasty, arbitrary consequence thought up by an instructor and put in <br/>
place to reinforce the contrived lesson.<br/>

<br/>
I was thinking that IF one is trying to teach sibling A to not hit <br/>
sibling B through &quot;lecturing&quot; then that in some ways resembled <br/>
teaching.  That was the only potential inconsistency between discussing <br/>
anti-social behavior and all out unschooling theory that I could see.<br/>
<br/>
But I agree that giving kids information about what we think and about <br/>
what we think other people might commonly think is a necessary part of <br/>
parenting.<br/>

Where did the idea that it&#39;s better to suppress all judgement come <br/>
from?  Was the origin of that discussion on another list?  Is it an NVC <br/>

<br/>
It is always hard when paraphrasing a conversation that is occurring on<br/>
another list to separate what people are saying from our interpretation of<br/>
it. I feel called to defend the folks contributing to a really deep<br/>
philosophical, and practical, series of threads on AU by letting you know<br/>
that nobody said that, and tbh I didn&#39;t think Danielle was implying that<br/>
anyone had (rather the opposite). <br/>
<br/>
The conversation has been very broad including being about ways of speaking<br/>
to them, what idea should be communicated first in different situations, the<br/>
motivations behind the different ways of speaking, choosing a mental label<br/>
for their behavior that promotes a compassionate response, and the best time<br/>
to speak to children about their challenging behaviors - and how these may<br/>
vary depending on the children&#39;s personalities. Danielle may disagree with<br/>
my paraphrase!<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing was instigated by concern about an angry father responding<br/>
punitively to his three year old poorly communicating his desire to play<br/>
with aggressive behavior, and has been one of the most wide ranging,<br/>
intellectually challenging and personally useful (promoting of<br/>
introspection) conversations that we have had over there. Helping our<br/>
children do better - with us, with their siblings, in social situations -<br/>
has definitely been the underlying focus.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Children need information and guidance and practice to be socially <br/>
adept, but I don&#39;t think we would say that we must &quot;teach&quot; them to be <br/>
socially adept, because it is not teaching that causes learning to <br/>
happen.  Unless the distinction between teaching and learning is less <br/>

<br/>
My experience with Jayn is that she resents being given information that she<br/>
already knows (but may have momentarily forgotten in the grip of emotions).<br/>
Trying to offer &quot;familiar guidance&quot; really annoys her and gets in the way of<br/>
our creative conversations about alternative strategies. <br/>

I thought it was hypothetical or originally on another list or both.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and that&#39;s entirely my fault. I wanted to bring the principle <br/>
behind the discussion over to discuss in a broader forum--not an easy <br/>
transition. While I would agree with Robyn&#39;s characterization of the <br/>
discussion (and of course the whole thing&#39;s available at AU for anyone&#39;s <br/>
perusal), for me it went beyond any single recent post about &quot;couch <br/>
dad.&quot; It is more a conglomeration of posts and situations and <br/>
recommendations, compounded by a recent reading of Rosenberg&#39;s <br/>
_Non-Violent Communication_ as part of an ongoing monthly book <br/>
discussion. For me, it&#39;s a bunch of things swirling together that all <br/>
seem to converge at the point of *to judge or not to judge--what is the <br/>
unschooling parent&#39;s role?*<br/>
<br/>
Rosenberg&#39;s theory in a nutshell contains four ordered components: <br/>
observation, feeling, needs, request. First we observe, the &quot;trick is to <br/>
be able to articulate this observation without introducing any judgment <br/>
or evaluation--to simply say what people are doing that we either like <br/>
or don&#39;t like&quot; (6). Rosenberg differentiates between &quot;moralistic&quot; and <br/>
&quot;value&quot; judgments. He writes, &quot;All of us make value judgments as to the <br/>
qualities we value in life; for example, we might value honesty, <br/>
freedom, or peace. Value judgments reflect our beliefs of how life can <br/>
best be served. We make *moralistic judgments* of people and behaviors <br/>
that fail to support our value judgments, e.g. &#39;Violence is bad. People <br/>
who kill others are evil.&#39; Had we been raised speaking a language that <br/>
facilitated the expression of compassion, we would have learned to <br/>
articulate our needs and values directly, rather than to insinuate <br/>
wrongness when they have not been met. For example instead of &#39;Violence <br/>
is bad,&#39; we might say instead, &#39;I am fearful of the use of violence to <br/>
resolve conflicts; I value the resolution of human conflicts through <br/>
other means.&#39;&quot; (17).<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so there&#39;s lots more, but that gets at the whole judgment thing. I <br/>
personally find Rosenberg&#39;s language wordy, stilted and formulaic. <br/>
Moreover, I don&#39;t find moralistic judgments of behaviors to translate to <br/>
the person. I don&#39;t make the logical leap that people who choose <br/>
violence are evil. I believe it is possible to talk about and evaluate <br/>
actions and choices within the moment without translating those <br/>
evaluations to the person over all time.<br/>
<br/>
So, to put it in more practical terms, if one of my children is hitting <br/>
another person (friend, sibling, parent, whatever, even the dog) with <br/>
his sword, I&#39;m not going to stand there using the four wordy steps only <br/>
to end in a request that he please stop hitting with the sword. I&#39;m <br/>
going to say &quot;Stop! Hitting hurts!&quot; or something brief and to that <br/>
effect. If I&#39;m close enough, I&#39;m going to grab the sword in mid air <br/>
before it lands another blow. The sword is available only on the <br/>
condition that it&#39;s not being used to hurt. As soon as that condition is <br/>
met, the sword is immediately available. My child decides that, not me.<br/>
<br/>
Another specific example that I posted today...<br/>
<br/>
The other day, the kids were out in the driveway drawing with chalk with <br/>
our 8 yo neighbor, who is very sweet and quiet most of the time--tends <br/>
to become overwhelmed by my children&#39;s exuberance. Sam (5) got very <br/>
excited and walked up to the little girl sitting in the driveway and <br/>
started doing his &quot;butt dance,&quot; shaking his hips back and forth Elvis <br/>
style, which he does when he&#39;s very excited. However, this meant that <br/>
his groin was right in the little girl&#39;s face shaking back and forth, <br/>
Chippendale style. All I had to say was, &quot;Sam, honey, no thank you.&quot; He <br/>
was fine with that; he was just really excited and having fun. He moved <br/>
off and found something else to do.<br/>
<br/>
Later, however, we had a conversation about how shaking one&#39;s groin or <br/>
butt in someone else&#39;s face or at someone else was *inappropriate.*  I <br/>
judged and labeled the action inappropriate without implying that Sam is <br/>
inappropriate. We talked about how doing the butt dance at home with <br/>
family was fine, but there are some things we only do at home with <br/>
family and we don&#39;t do this in anyone&#39;s face. I had no qualms whatsoever <br/>
in passing judgment on his action or making that sweeping generalization <br/>
about the likely interpretation of his action out in the wider world <br/>
(even though he may someday become a Chippendale dancer and make loads <br/>
of money doing what I labeled as inappropriate for general social <br/>
interaction). It was simple, easy, to the point, useful, practical <br/>
information that he *needs* to have. No shame, no blame.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I had simply focused on his need--to express his excitement and <br/>
exuberance--and expressed C&#39;s need--she needs to feel safe in her space, <br/>
or whatever--that may have helped him in the moment but it would not <br/>
necessarily have translated into the next situation. If I had gone <br/>
through all of Rosenberg&#39;s four steps with Sam in the moment, it would <br/>
have drawn more attention to the behavior than I deemed necessary and <br/>
that attention in and of itself may have been shaming. Sometimes <br/>
sweeping generalizations are useful and expedient.<br/>
<br/>
If Sam had done this over at C&#39;s house where her father, for instance, <br/>
were the one to see it, that may have resulted in a very different <br/>
situation. He could have been shamed and scolded and made to feel like a <br/>
terrible person and sent home. That&#39;s not something I want to happen, <br/>
and if my judgment of his actions, labeling them inappropriate, can <br/>
prevent that--great! That&#39;s what I mean when I say that I believe not <br/>
sharing judgment and rationale can have cruel results. Not everything <br/>
must be learned through trial and error.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe having more specific and less hypothetical situations will make <br/>
this whole discussion more clear, I don&#39;t know. But, there you go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It seems to be a more elaborate version of the same old &quot;I message&quot; stuff <br/>
from the 60&#39;s.   Not horrible, but not necessary.   And I hate to see people <br/>
glomming onto it like a religion instead of using it as one of many tools.   THERE <br/>
comes one of the things he&#39;s preaching against, which is making a moral <br/>
judgment.    I&#39;ve had people tell me (online and in person) that something I said <br/>
wasn&#39;t in keeping with non-violent communication. &quot;Rosenberg says...&quot;       <br/>
Well I don&#39;t go to his church, and if they want to decide I&#39;ve violated their <br/>
boundaries because I didn&#39;t read the book before I talked to them, all I can <br/>
think is that if they need to study remedial conversation-having that&#39;s not my <br/>
problem.   <br/>
<br/>
So for me personally, having YEARS and years of good relationships with kids <br/>
and friends   and relatives who still call to tell me their problems, I don&#39;t <br/>
want to stop what I&#39;m doing and read a book about communicating with <br/>
prescribed phrases.   <br/>
<br/>
Chippendale dancing between consenting adults is fine. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
&quot;Between consenting adults&quot; might be a phrase all children should be required <br/>
to learn.   :-)<br/>

<br/>
Right.   <br/>
<br/>
My kids are really surprised sometimes to hear what others would consider <br/>
totally inappropriate, but they understand it.   A shy Christian family came over <br/>
to visit one day and I had the soundtrack of the Southpark movie playing <br/>
(past the &quot;uncle f***ker&quot; song, but still...) and I didn&#39;t even notice.   Marty <br/>
and Holly did, and one of them just subtly came over and turned the volume down <br/>
gradually to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
They understand the principle.<br/>
<br/>
I do too, but am of an age where I&#39;d just as soon cleanse my life of those <br/>
who would be offended.   They&#39;re not at that point yet, so they&#39;re more careful <br/>
and considerate.<br/>

<br/>
I must confess to not being very good at saying nothing!  You all have <br/>
probably figured that out by now (from my posting style).<br/>
<br/>
I think not judging can be taken too far.  But the first big step on the <br/>
not judging path seems like a good one.  I define that first step as <br/>
saying something like &quot;*I* don&#39;t like that&quot; or &quot;that bothers *me*&quot; <br/>
rather than saying &quot;that&#39;s bad&quot;.  (This would be clearer is I was using <br/>
real examples.  Sorry.)  What you&#39;ve suggested, saying &quot;stop&quot;, is also <br/>
more neutral and doesn&#39;t have a built-in putdown.  (If there are people <br/>
who find &quot;stop&quot; to be too authoritarian, or something, I&#39;m not with them <br/>
ideologically, but I&#39;m willing to listen.)<br/>
<br/>
My kid (11 now) takes moderate feedback without seeming upset by it, so <br/>
I haven&#39;t delved as far into this issue as people who have either kids <br/>
or spouse who make it clear they prefer to be treated a different way. <br/>
(And my kid was very verbal at a young age, which makes this kind of <br/>
dialog easier.)  I haven&#39;t had to think so hard about improving, because <br/>
it&#39;s been &quot;workable&quot; here.  Other people undoubtedly have a deeper grasp <br/>
of the subject than I do.<br/>
