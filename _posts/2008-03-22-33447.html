<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270012217">Z is 8 and we&#39;ve been unschooling for over a year now. When he was in school, he was very negatively affected. It took us too long to pull our heads out of the sand and stop listening to the school about what the issue was. He was a little over 7 then but he was seriously depressed. He hated life, himself and everyone around him. We barely have any pics of him smiling. It breaks my heart that we were so naive for so long in helping him.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s come a long way in over a year, but it&#39;s still a struggle. I battled bi-polar disorder for years before getting it under control (mostly) with vitamins, diet and *choice*. Choosing to be happy was a big one for me - choosing to surround myself with things that make me happy, choosing to focus on happy things instead of the negative, choosing to keep myself healthy, and sometimes just plain old choosing to have a happy day. I try to keep positive affirmations around, saying little phrases to help him learn to choose happiness now. I&#39;ve talked to him about different ideas on how different people handle the subject - prayer, meditation, Law of Attraction. I&#39;ve been modeling these things to him in my actions. (I don&#39;t mention the word &quot;depression&quot; or &quot;pessimism&quot; because I don&#39;t want him locked into a label.) But many days he is still stuck in this unhappy rut.<br/>
<br/>
Usually it starts when he&#39;s tired (a whole &#39;nother topic - I&#39;ll post that one too) or when things aren&#39;t happening the way he would prefer. He says things like &quot;My life is horrible&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m going to have another bad day today!&quot; &quot;Everyone hates me.&quot; &quot;Nothing good ever happens.&quot; &quot;I hate myself/I&#39;m stupid/etc&quot;. He&#39;s even gone so far as to say he wishes he would die or he wants to kill himself. An 8 year old!<br/>
<br/>
When I try to talk to him about what I do to, he doesn&#39;t want to hear it. If I dare mention that being happy is a choice, that you can choose to look at the good things or the bad things, etc he tells me that he can&#39;t choose to be happy because life sucks too much. I&quot;m trying not to become frustrated because I know that where he is at, that will only feel like abandonment. But I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end. I thought that this was mostly residual stuff from a crappy school experience (life really did suck back then) but after over a year and no school in sight, I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s more than that and I&#39;m wondering if I should take him to a naturopath/homepath. This isn&#39;t something we dealt with before school, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s only personality (how some people tend to see the glass half empty). But I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s habit or if it&#39;s more serious thn that either.<br/>

Any suggestions or ideas?<br/>

Stop talking to him about it.  Just create a cheery, comfortable  <br/>
environment.  Smile at him without crowding him.  Thank him without  <br/>
being too mushy, if he does something.  Point out the nice things.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe model the moments-not-days thing by saying, if something goes  <br/>
wrong, &quot;Well this was a bad moment but it doesn&#39;t ruin the day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you get him out of the house?  Not to relatives, but to another  <br/>
town for something?  An overnight trip with you or his dad, where  <br/>
everything&#39;s so new and stimulating that he&#39;s thinking new thoughts?   <br/>
Touristy this-or-that a few towns away, maybe?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378526297">I know that you&#39;re trying to help him by telling him some of the things that work for you, <br/>
but at 8 he may not have that separate voice that he&#39;ll develop later that would enable him <br/>
to &quot;talk himself into a happy day.&quot;  He will feel immersed in the emotion he&#39;s in, and the <br/>
rest might feel really frustrating to him because it doesn&#39;t make sense.  He&#39;s literally not <br/>
self-conscious enough yet for that, developmentally speaking.  Most of the energetic <br/>
practices don&#39;t recommend that you teach a child the practices--they are usually way <br/>
ahead of us in the ability to live in the moment and shift their energy.  My daughter is the <br/>
best wisher I know.  Even NVC recommends just modeling.  <br/>
<br/>
So creating a cheery environment, maybe approaching it through some fun playing that <br/>
you invite him into if he&#39;s interested--some roughhousing always raises the mood around <br/>
here.  An impromptu game of hide and seek or chase or something else physical might <br/>
help to engage him.  I also liked the idea of a trip to someplace fun to give him new <br/>
thoughts.  Maybe finding an indoor swimming facility and playing in the pool.  There are <br/>
some private health clubs with indoor pools that allow for one day use.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never really tried the homeopathic route, but I have a friend that has had great success <br/>
with using them for herself and her daughter for both physical ailments and emotional <br/>
blocks.  I would be careful to ask him if he&#39;d like to try it and how you approach it with <br/>
him--maybe focusing on helping to create shifts rather than &quot;fixing a problem.&quot;  Unless he <br/>
genuinely  feels like he has a problem--then it might help him have hope to know that <br/>
you guys are addressing it and looking for answers.  It sounds like maybe your son is <br/>
reflecting that part of you that is still a little stuck--so maybe focusing on yourself will be <br/>
what it takes to help him &quot;see&quot; how a person creates happiness.  And if you aren&#39;t feeling <br/>
genuine happiness, all the explaining in the world won&#39;t help him to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114783105">Hi Tara!  We&#39;re having the exact same problem with our 6 year old.  We just<br/>
pulled him out of kindergarten, after 7 months (we waited too long, too!)<br/>
He was a pleasant, happy little boy until school.  And I am convinced that<br/>
is what started his negative behavior.  We unschooled during the preschool<br/>
years (I didn&#39;t know it was called unschooling then--it&#39;s just what we did!)<br/>
Once school started, I think he became really bored.  He began saying very<br/>
similar things to your son&#39;s.  It&#39;s pretty scary, hearing that come out of a<br/>
child!<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t really have any answers for you, being that we are in the<br/>
same boat. The only thing I have noticed is that when N&#39;s mind is<br/>
stimulated, he seems happier.  So we&#39;ve been going nuts trying to give him<br/>
opportunities to use his mind (space books from the library, science kits,<br/>
art supplies, etc.)  I don&#39;t know if this is just a short-lived solution or<br/>
if his attitude is actually improving, since we just pulled him out of<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am very curious to see what others have to say on this topic.  If<br/>
you&#39;d like to email me off the group, feel free--I&#39;m sure we&#39;d have lots to<br/>
talk about!<br/>

discussion with him.  Those kinds of discussions are never a win/win <br/>
when one person for whatever reason wants validation in losing.<br/>
<br/>
One of the single best things that I&#39;ve done with this type of thing <br/>
with my kids, is to put on a very funny movie.  One that makes us laugh <br/>
and laugh and laugh.  Laughter in and of itself creates endorphins that <br/>
help people feel happier.  It also allows for later conversations when <br/>
someone goes to that sad space again.  Simply reminding someone of <br/>
something that was really funny, or retelling that joke, or visual <br/>
image, can turn someone around in their thought process directional <br/>
heading.  Sort of a mental jump start of &quot;don&#39;t go there&quot;.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking that too.  I&#39;ve always liked the idea of shaking things <br/>
up a little.  This applies to the general thread too.  Go to a <br/>
different store to buy groceries, go all the way across town to do it, <br/>
or another town if you live in a really really small one.<br/>
<br/>
Stop along the way if something seems interesting.  Take the back <br/>
roads, and stay off the freeway.  You will find interesting houses, <br/>
yards, parks, views, and you can listen to music longer, or books on <br/>
tape/cd or play car games, or plain old talk.  You can get lost a <br/>
little and try to find your way back to somewhere familiar and ask your <br/>
kids for help with which direction to turn.<br/>
<br/>
We have really enjoyed this aspect of life at our house.  The idea of <br/>
expanding our choices in small ways.  But even small ways are hugely <br/>
mind expanding.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267575228">Hi<br/>
its so hard to see a child, our child, sad, depressed, angry...<br/>
<br/>
but really, what a child needs is to be accepted just as he is, where he is.  If he is in a rut <br/>
and complaining, I would be right there, trying to pull out his thoughts into words...if he <br/>
wishes it. <br/>
I know that I love to have someone listen to a rant of mine...with no lectures attached, i <br/>
mean!  then after wards, I might be ready to really listen to advice.  But for an eight year <br/>
old in the throes of it, what he may need is just  some new movement to life... as jenny and <br/>
sandra suggest...shake things up a bit in a &quot;sparkly&quot; way (love that expression, sandra)...<br/>
<br/>
another thing that I do, that echoes sandra again, is really give alot of eyecontact with <br/>
smiles, to my children. If they are in a negative place, they really seem to resist at first <br/>
that eyecontact, but I will do it any way, in a playful way--like as we pass each other, I will <br/>
bonk foreheads with my older children, looking in their eyes, smiling (laughing too)...We <br/>
do alot of head bonking here...we must have learned that one from our goats, lol.<br/>
<br/>
It may sound strange to you, but over the past few years, Ive really noticed how much my <br/>
kids thrive on that seemingly little thing called eyecontact.  The more I do it, the better we <br/>
feel together.<br/>
<br/>

severe depression, I needed someone to liten to me and felt worse <br/>
when people got tired of it or disengaged. I don&#39;t want to amplify <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah that&#39;s a good point. I do say these things but usually in <br/>
reponse to something negative he said (like &quot;this whole day is ruined <br/>
and horrible&quot;). I think I need to start making it a point to do this <br/>

really into Xbox Live at the moment so he often doesn&#39;t want to go <br/>
anywhere. But maybe I just need to be more adament about this. How do <br/>
I do so if he really doesn&#39;t want to go? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also afraid to make his happiness dependent on &quot;fun stuff&quot; or <br/>
just &quot;stuff&quot; in general. Is he too young for me to worry about that?<br/>

membership.  We are happy and tired by the time we leave.  I always <br/>
make sure we can spend a good long time there and we go late <br/>
afternoon or evening.  I also take food so we can have something to <br/>
eat right away and because she might fall asleep in the car.  <br/>

Worries, worries, afraid, scary.<br/>

darkness and &quot;issue.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

Struggles, fighting, hard struggle, unhappy...<br/>

Instead of thinking of this as &quot;fighting very hard&quot; to overcome your  <br/>
own self, maybe you could consider it &quot;taking steps to be happier,&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;moving in more  positive directions.&quot;<br/>

Choices aren&#39;t just big things.  Choose whether to lighten a mood by  <br/>
smiling or putting on music.  Choose whether to cut a sandwich into  <br/>
four pretty pieces or leave it whole.  Choose whether to use negative  <br/>

he&#39;s not or overly focusing on this. I&#39;m certainly not always cranky <br/>
(although I&#39;m not perfect and his crankiness can certainly affect <br/>

These are things I don&#39;t highlight until he&#39;s dealing with them (or <br/>

This book really helped me understand the changes my 7-10 year olds went (and are still going) thru.  It focuses on what is referred to as &quot;The Nine Year Change&quot;, but for many children in our society, that now begins at age 7/8.  And just exactly like what you are seeing, it is about the child&#39;s coming to the realization that they are not connected to you as once thought.  That they are essentially alone in the world, and that they are separate indeed from all things.  OVERWHELMING realization, and can manifest itself in SO many ways!!!  Buy the book--you will not be sorry to have read it.  Most likely it will not be available at the library.  It is not hard reading, it is right on with the views and the author helps by giving thoughts on how to support the process itself in your child.<br/>

Don&#39;t mean to change the subject.  A Steiner book could be helpful, I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801590557">I think that is great that your library might have this book!  (Encountering the Self) Our libraries have only 4 books on homeschooling, and only 1 waldorf type book on any subject!   This book is not by Steiner...and I have to agree on your sentiment about not wanting to read more. :)  He is very difficult reading in most cases as well.<br/>
<br/>
But this book I recommended is not like Steiner reading.  It does include antroposophy perhaps(?), but what I took from it was more of an affirmation of what my gut was telling me and it helped to see the whole picture with a lot more clarity, which in turn helped me relax and BE THERE for my son during this time of huge awakenings; instead of wondering what was &quot;wrong&quot;, it was more what was &quot;right&quot; with what he was feeling.<br/>
<br/>
So, please don&#39;t discount the book based on not liking Steiner.  It would do the book itself injustice.  Just thought I would clarify that part!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790837153">I think that is great that your library might have this book!  (Encountering the Self) Our libraries have only 4 books on homeschooling, and only 1 waldorf type book on any subject!   This book is not by Steiner...and I have to agree on your sentiment about not wanting to read more. :)  He is very difficult reading in most cases as well.<br/>

The book might have some great stuff, but if it&#39;s talking about  <br/>
stages of mental and emotional development, any site that discusses  <br/>
Piaget&#39;s stages of development would do.   Here are the first four  <br/>
that came up on Google.  These are worth knowing about.  It&#39;s one of  <br/>
the things I mentioned when I spoke in Arizona.  Which reminds me,  <br/>
the unschooling panelists  haven&#39;t send me anything and I haven&#39;t  <br/>
answered any of the leftover questions either.  But back to Piaget:<br/>

The fourth one was a rip-off of another one, so three will be way  <br/>
plenty.<br/>

use to request that the library purchase materials that are not<br/>
currently in the collection.  I stumbled across this option when<br/>
chatting with a librarian - we spend a lot of time there!! This can be<br/>
used for any type of media the library stocks: videos, books,<br/>
magazines, cds.  They do not buy everything requested, but if your<br/>
library offers this, it can be a great way to let them know what you<br/>
would like to see. <br/>
