<div id="ygrps-yiv-656427272">Lyrical Life Science.  Silly/cute/almost strange lyrics about all kinds of<br/>
science topics set to familiar tunes like Ole Susanna.--Clementine.  There&#39;s<br/>
a third volume out now and I&#39;m not sure what kind of music those songs are<br/>
set to though...<br/>
<br/>
Wait.. Home Training Tools has them online. (www.hometrainingtools.com)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s their blurb<br/>
Volume 1<br/>
Informally titled &quot;Bacteria to Birds&quot;, this unique life science course puts<br/>
key information to familiar tunes to enhance learning. The 91 pp. textbook<br/>
covers many diverse topics such as: the scientific method, characteristics<br/>
of living things, vascular plants, algae, fungi, nonvascular plants,<br/>
invertebrates, birds, and microscopic organisms. Key information from each<br/>
major topic is captured in one of the 11 songs provided on cassette tape.<br/>
Also includes a 43 pp. workbook with application questions and an answer<br/>
key. Plan about 10-12 weeks to complete the 12 units in Volume 1. Grades<br/>
5-9.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Workbook is good quality paper.... we have it in pristine condition. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Made a good car tape. ;)<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sources for educational songs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am on a quest.  My son *loves* to learn anything that is set<br/>
&gt; to music.  I downloaded the Multiplication Rock songs and he<br/>
&gt; listens to them and sings them around the house.  I found a<br/>
&gt; website that has science songs and put some in a folder for him.<br/>
&gt; He discovered them a few days later and came downstairs telling<br/>
&gt; me about kinetic and potential energy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been trying to find more things like this, but keep coming<br/>
&gt; up empty.  I am not trying to bombard my son with this, by the<br/>
&gt; way.  It&#39;s sort of like with food.  It&#39;s there for him, and when<br/>
&gt; he is hungry he will &quot;forage&quot; for it.  I am just trying<br/>
&gt; to gather these resources so I have them or know where to find<br/>
&gt; them. Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
