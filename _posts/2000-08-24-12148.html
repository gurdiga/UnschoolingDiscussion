<div id="ygrps-yiv-649791302">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
My son Rowyn is 6 years old.  He enjoys writing his name in all capitals<br/>
but will start with the R small and make each letter progressively<br/>
bigger.  He says the bigger the letter is the louder it is.  I think<br/>
that is really neat.  Of course I have all the paper where they are<br/>
suppose to make the letters even but I haven&#39;t introduced that yet.  At<br/>
some time I may tell him that I love the way he writes his name but at<br/>
times it might be easier to read if the letters were all the same size.<br/>
I know he can make them all the same size though because I&#39;ve seen him<br/>
do it.  He&#39;s just doing it this way for fun.<br/>

Ask me how to get paid for what you are already doing for free.  Sherry<br/>
