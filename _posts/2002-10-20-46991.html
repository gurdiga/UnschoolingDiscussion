<br/>
Can we move on, please? I think this is going the way of the polical battles <br/>
a few months ago. It&#39;s getting old--and though oddly interesting as to what <br/>
folks know and don&#39;t know at this point in their lives, how &#39;bout starting <br/>
your own list for debating Jews/Christians/Catholics/Baptists/Jesus-loving <br/>
Jews?<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler, I DO think that I&#39;m open to learning many new things,but <br/>
this is tiring. It truly has nothing to do with unschooling, and it won&#39;t go <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Joyce! If I could think of another subject, I&#39;d start one! &lt;G&gt; Any <br/>
ideas?<br/>

Are you the same poster who didn&#39;t like the dog topic a while back? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You have to come up with something juicy like cat poo or evolution or the<br/>
evolution of cat poo.<br/>
<br/>
Just look at all these unschooling opportunities!  Recipe&#39;s animal care,<br/>
science, religion. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, here&#39;s a topic.  Has any one tried the game Vet Emergency?   It looks<br/>
like something my son would like but before we get it I thought I&#39;d see<br/>
if some wise unschooler had a review.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll that&#39;s still sort of a critter topic, but as far as I can tell, no<br/>
Jesus. <br/>

I think it could be good if there were a helpful aide there making<br/>
suggestions or a vet to follow around and explain what&#39;s going on. But<br/>
you&#39;re figuring out how the program works while guessing what treatments to<br/>
use -- and no follow up on why that treatment was chosen -- all in &quot;real&quot;<br/>
time while the pet is suffering.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea, but a lot more pets will have to die before we learn enough<br/>
to know what to do :-/<br/>

treatment was chosen over the other...  hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Joyce.<br/>
