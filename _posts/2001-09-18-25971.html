<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826154301">I have been one of the silent ones. Well mostly. I did come to the board once for help and really appreciated it. I don&#39;t post much because I am new at unschooling and don&#39;t know if my advice would be much help. I haven&#39;t told anyone how or what I think about unschooling cuz I don&#39;t really think any one cares. But since I am posting I thought I would just tell you after being apart of public school, private H/S, an ISP, Public H/S, and now my own private school it feels good to just let my kids be kids! They watch t.v. they go on the computer, they play board games and card games, they play paint ball (yes with paint ball guns), they ride bikes and rollerblade, they swim, they do arts and crafts, my daughter plays the violin (only when she feels like it no more forced lessons!) My son plays the guitar and writes music. And my daughter at 12 still likes to play dress up and play with dolls and Barbies. My 17 year old is also working. His choice! It supports his music! He is the one you all helped me with when he changed his mind on taking music classes at the college. You all have been such great support and I really appreciate the input from all of you! And yes I make my kids do chores! and I do yell at them when they dont!!! I already know how you all feel about that so we dont have to go there again!! This is who I am and I know it is different then alot of you, thats another reason why I dont post! I am one to avoid confrentation but would love to help if I could. So if I cant be of any help I will just keep my mouth shut and keep reading! Thanks All!! Kasie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083329731">Thank you so much Kasie... I now feel normal and ok and that I&#39;m not <br/>
acting strange with this new unschooling venture.  I can see why <br/>
people don&#39;t do this and stick with the tried and true Public and <br/>
Private Schools.  I was in Trader Joes today (alone, DH was with <br/>
kids) and I heard these two women agonizing over which preschool <br/>
their kids were going too, the ratios, the teachers, the area, what <br/>
they taught.  It brought back memories or me and my friends doing <br/>
that and then I look back and think &quot;what a waste of my time to worry <br/>
about all that&quot;.  Which is probably what I&#39;ll think when the worry <br/>
about whether I&#39;m unschooling &quot;correctly&quot; passes.<br/>
