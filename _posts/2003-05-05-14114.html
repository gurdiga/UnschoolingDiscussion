<div id="ygrps-yiv-556053709">True, they could find cavities in between teeth with x-rays.  <br/>
However, not everyone wants to fill every tiny cavity.  Some people <br/>
may want to wait and see if a cavity develops into something bigger <br/>
or causes pain before taking any action.  <br/>
<br/>
With my dd&#39;s cavities that have caused her pain, they were clearly <br/>
visible.  Besides, she has an extremely difficult time holding the x-<br/>
ray bitewing in her mouth.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really necessary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to take my ds Jack (he&#39;s 6) to the dentist tomorrow and I&#39;m <br/>
really dreading it.  He has had the worst teeth.  Two absested and <br/>
were removed after antibiotics within a 6 month period when he was 3. <br/>
He had to be knocked out the second time around, then he spent 2 <br/>
years refusing to open his mouth for a dentist and grew two more <br/>
nasty cavities.  He got way better about letting them do work on him <br/>
and now has 2 crowns.  He has some small ones to get filled tomorrow <br/>
and they also want to put a spacer in where the two were extracted.<br/>
I&#39;m questioning whether this is necessary since it&#39;s been 3 years and <br/>
his teeth have already moved to fill the space.  They are baby teeth <br/>
that are going to fall out anyway.  <br/>
This is the discussion i have to have tomorrow and this guy is <br/>
intimidating.  <br/>
They already made a mold for the spacer at the last appointment which <br/>
wasn&#39;t suppose to happen til this appointment tomorrow.  I get a bill <br/>
for over $400 for this mold, and I didn&#39;t even agree to have the <br/>
spacer put in!  He had lined up 3 appointment for me with all the <br/>
costs and proceedures layed out and told me there would be no <br/>
suprises with cost.  I had expressed my concern with the expense when <br/>
we started all this.<br/>
The spacer wasn&#39;t suppose to happen til the 3rd appt. and I was still <br/>
debating about doing it or not.  I hadn&#39;t told him that, but I <br/>
thought I had time.  Now I have a bill for something I think I don&#39;t <br/>
want to happen.  I&#39;m not paying if we don&#39;t do it.  I don&#39;t think I <br/>
should, since he is the one that altered our proceedure agreement <br/>
without consulting me.<br/>
Sorry, I&#39;m rambling in my frustration and dread.  I hope i made sense.<br/>
Joanna (who hates dealing with crap like this)<br/>
Oh, and Jack brushes every day.  He&#39;s not the healthiest eater <br/>
though.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567155581">We have been seeing a French dentist here in the Middle East and he hasn&#39;t<br/>
done any xrays on us. Says they are only needed every 5 or 6 years or so.<br/>
He also doesn&#39;t clean children&#39;s teeth (unless really needed) and doesn&#39;t<br/>
go crazy on cleaning adult teeth more than every other year. He says that<br/>
stripping off all the plaque is bad because you need some of it as a<br/>
protective coating. It&#39;s like taking all the bacteria off your body (with<br/>
anti-bacteria soaps etc) and leaving yourself exposed to more problems. He<br/>
even told my kids not to floss until they are in their teens.<br/>
<br/>
He tells us most European dentists laugh at the extreme dental care given<br/>
in the US because they don&#39;t believe it&#39;s all necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Take this as you will -- I haven&#39;t seen reports on the state of teeth in<br/>
France:)<br/>

upwards, lying between the roots of her permanent central incisors within<br/>
the palate, heading for her nasal cavity.  It took immediate oral surgery to<br/>
remove it; it was already 5/8&quot; long, and would have broken through into her<br/>
nose eventually, killing the incisors in the process.<br/>

they wear sneakers, too, for the same reason.  Horses can live past 30<br/>
years, compared to the 12 year average lifespan/ age of retirement for<br/>
Seeing Eye dogs.  They also see things differently and have different<br/>
instincts which seem to work well for the job.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Both. She rode English for a couple of years (pre-4H)  - then started <br/>
switching back and forth. She used to like English MUCH more - liked <br/>
learning to jump....but now she&#39;s liking Western a bit more, I think, <br/>
and I REALLY like western more (watching her jumping was scary for me). <br/>
In 4H they do much more than just ride - they do &quot;showmanship&quot; and also <br/>
things like &quot;horse bowl&quot; and they have horse judging competitions and <br/>
so on.  They go on field trips and they do community service once a <br/>
month that is often horse-related (help out at the therapeutic <br/>
programs/seeing eye horse programs, etc). Rosie did a display about <br/>
Quick Release Knots (why use one, how to tie it, etc) for the Orange <br/>
County Fair&#39;s &quot;youth expo&quot; last weekend - and won Best of Show for <br/>
intermediate age kids (6th to 8th grades) in the Animal and Veterinary <br/>
Science Division. In a few weeks they have their end-of-year horse <br/>
mastership testing -- they get scored on equitation, showmanship, trail <br/>
riding, grooming ability and knowledge, and general horse knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Horses and soccer - that&#39;s been Rosie&#39;s &quot;curriculum&quot; for the past few <br/>
years!  I know I have learned a LOT!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463849591">Hi Mary Ellen and Joanna.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always said no to xrays for my children and myself. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to use a potentially harmful procedure when there is no known problem to warrant it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Joanna, I hate all that crap too! I&#39;ve learnt over the years to be assertive and not allow anyone to make the decisions for me. Now I say firmly and politely what I do and don&#39;t want and I make sure they understand me.<br/>
<br/>
One of my sons had similar dental problems to yours. He had a few baby teeth removed. His adult teeth are beautiful, much to my relief! He also brushed regularly. I got really sick of everyone assuming that he lived on lollies and never brushed, and all those &quot;what a bad mother&quot; looks! All my other kids had lovely teeth. It&#39;s a real mystery.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve given up on regular dental visits all together now. They always want to give fillings, which don&#39;t seem necessary. Then they want to use mercury amalgam, which we decline. They give the kids fluoride toothpaste, which we throw out, and want to coat their teeth with fluoride, also declined. There didn&#39;t seem to be much point in going back after the last time......<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I have to take my ds Jack (he&#39;s 6) to the dentist tomorrow and I&#39;m <br/>
  really dreading it.  He has had the worst teeth.  Two absested and <br/>
  were removed after antibiotics within a 6 month period when he was 3. <br/>
  He had to be knocked out the second time around, then he spent 2 <br/>
  years refusing to open his mouth for a dentist and grew two more <br/>
  nasty cavities.  He got way better about letting them do work on him <br/>
  and now has 2 crowns.  He has some small ones to get filled tomorrow <br/>
  and they also want to put a spacer in where the two were extracted.<br/>
  I&#39;m questioning whether this is necessary since it&#39;s been 3 years and <br/>
  his teeth have already moved to fill the space.  They are baby teeth <br/>
  that are going to fall out anyway.  <br/>
  This is the discussion i have to have tomorrow and this guy is <br/>
  intimidating.  <br/>
  They already made a mold for the spacer at the last appointment which <br/>
  wasn&#39;t suppose to happen til this appointment tomorrow.  I get a bill <br/>
  for over $400 for this mold, and I didn&#39;t even agree to have the <br/>
  spacer put in!  He had lined up 3 appointment for me with all the <br/>
  costs and proceedures layed out and told me there would be no <br/>
  suprises with cost.  I had expressed my concern with the expense when <br/>
  we started all this.<br/>
  The spacer wasn&#39;t suppose to happen til the 3rd appt. and I was still <br/>
  debating about doing it or not.  I hadn&#39;t told him that, but I <br/>
  thought I had time.  Now I have a bill for something I think I don&#39;t <br/>
  want to happen.  I&#39;m not paying if we don&#39;t do it.  I don&#39;t think I <br/>
  should, since he is the one that altered our proceedure agreement <br/>
  without consulting me.<br/>
  Sorry, I&#39;m rambling in my frustration and dread.  I hope i made sense.<br/>
  Joanna (who hates dealing with crap like this)<br/>
  Oh, and Jack brushes every day.  He&#39;s not the healthiest eater <br/>
  though.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>upwards, lying between the roots of her permanent central incisors within<br/>
the palate, heading for her nasal cavity.  It took immediate oral surgery to<br/>
remove it; it was already 5/8&quot; long, and would have broken through into her<br/>
nose eventually, killing the incisors in the process.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
X-rays when I was a teen showed two molars growing sideways.  I finally had them removed in my 30s.  They had not yet given me any problems, other than appearing in x-rays.  The dentist who convinced me to have them removed said, if left in, they would increase my chance of cancer in my sinuses.  Ironically, I never had sinus problems before they were removed, but have since their removal.<br/>
<br/>
If I could do it over, I wouldn&#39;t have had any of the six teeth pulled that I have over my lifetime.  All of them pulled because they were &quot;high risk for causing problems in the future&quot;.  None because they actually were causing problems.<br/>

  ----- snip----- He also doesn&#39;t clean children&#39;s teeth (unless really needed) and doesn&#39;t<br/>
  go crazy on cleaning adult teeth more than every other year. He says that<br/>
  stripping off all the plaque is bad because you need some of it as a<br/>
  protective coating. It&#39;s like taking all the bacteria off your body (with<br/>
  anti-bacteria soaps etc) and leaving yourself exposed to more problems. He<br/>
  even told my kids not to floss until they are in their teens.<br/>

<br/>
I guess you could start saving money for orthodontia, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have insurance, and they want me to pay the same day.  That right there is a pretty good reason to not have x-rays!<br/>
<br/>
She hasn&#39;t had any cavities yet and she doesn&#39;t have any pain in her teeth.  Plus, most of her teeth are still baby teeth.  If they do have cavities that would only show up on x-rays, it wouldn&#39;t be that horrible.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback!<br/>
