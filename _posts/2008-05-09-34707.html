<div id="ygrps-yiv-481168423">I need some advice on how to respectfully help my ds8 (2 yrs <br/>
unschooled, schooled prior) learn that respect, courtesy, and <br/>
politeness are vital life skills.  Long story short, he has a <br/>
love/hate relationship with a 6.5 yr old schooled neighbor boy.  <br/>
Recently my ds has been aggressive toward him, pushing and shoving <br/>
and generally &quot;taunting&quot; him.  They&#39;re both only children and many <br/>
times we&#39;ve commented that they treat each other like siblings <br/>
might.  My ds seems to really enjoy the reaction he gets from the <br/>
boy, which is usually along the lines of, &quot;You&#39;re going to get in <br/>
trouble!  I&#39;m going to tell.&quot;  Ds has recently been making a big <br/>
point of arguing back and saying that he won&#39;t get in trouble and it <br/>
won&#39;t matter if he does tell.  The playing usually ends there and <br/>
somebody goes home, mad, but they come around to play again the next <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
The recent issues of arguing seem to be fueled by jealousy if the <br/>
other one has friends over, play dates, or feels left out.  Today <br/>
they both had friends over.  My ds and his friend were playing by <br/>
themselves outside on their scooters, and spotted the friend and dad <br/>
walking the guest home.  Ds scootered after the neighbor with <br/>
harassing and taunting comments (according to all who heard - I was <br/>
not outside and didn&#39;t hear).  When the boy smacked ds with a shoe <br/>
(that he was carrying), ds kicked him in the shins.  The boy went <br/>
home, told the mom, the mom (who is a very reasonable person) tried <br/>
to call ds over to talk with him about it and ds ran away.  Several <br/>
minutes later ds went over and rang their bell and proceeded to tell <br/>
the mom that &quot;I&#39;m not going to get in trouble and I never will.&quot;  The <br/>
mom phoned me and explained what happened (with empathy, thank <br/>
goodness).  <br/>
<br/>
Having come from punitive parents I&#39;m looking for respectful <br/>
responses.  The part that bothered me the most was ds&#39;s need to go <br/>
ring the bell and &quot;mouth off&quot; to the mom.  Ds&#39;s response was to ask <br/>
why he should treat the adult differently than the child?  I don&#39;t <br/>
think it polite to treat anyone that way, but do realize that he&#39;s <br/>
said this to the boy before and I didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything about it <br/>
except explain it wasn&#39;t cool, so *I am* treating this situation <br/>
differently.  There ensued a discussion of examples of people <br/>
you &quot;must&quot; respect or face punishment - judges in a courtroom and <br/>
policemen.  My main goal is, &quot;What&#39;s the lesson learned?&quot; and so far <br/>
I am not confident I have gotten the point across.  My words so far <br/>
are obviously not working -- I could really use some suggestions on <br/>
how to help ds understand that &quot;mouthing off&quot; isn&#39;t cool and that <br/>
there is indeed a need for politeness and respect.  Also, ds&#39;s play <br/>
date friend was witness to ds&#39;s behavior and is very interested in <br/>
what will &quot;happen&quot; to ds.  Dh and I told ds that we are very <br/>
concerned and will have to think about this some more and will get <br/>
back to him about it in about 24 hours (basically long enough to ask <br/>
for help!).  Since telling him that he has been picking up his <br/>
things, cleaning his room, being sweet....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Why would it &quot;not matter&quot;? Is your child getting the message that it&#39;s<br/>
ok with his parents if he&#39;s mean to others? Where are the parents<br/>
(you) when all  this is going on? Because if my child showed a lack of<br/>
ability to respect other people&#39;s boundaries then I would stay VERY<br/>
present at all times or keep other people away from us until that<br/>
child could handle the social interactions without hurting others.<br/>
<br/>
Had he gone from a punitive lifestyle and is now confused about<br/>
boundaries? It&#39;s not respectful to your child to let them hurt others<br/>
and cause everyone to view them as &quot;mean&quot;. Why hasn&#39;t anyone said &quot;no<br/>
way&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, there is confusion on ds&#39;s part on what &quot;trouble&quot; means.  It used <br/>
to be big consequences of restrictions, loss of priviledges, and/or <br/>
chores.  To the neighbor boy &quot;trouble&quot; means grounding, removal of fun <br/>
things, and the occassional spanking.  I think part of ds&#39;s thought is <br/>
that he&#39;s not going to get a spanking and that&#39;s the worst &quot;trouble&quot; he <br/>
can think of.  So by lack of &quot;trouble&quot; he seems to be assuming no <br/>
consequences.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why would it &quot;not matter&quot;? Is your child getting the message that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s ok with his parents if he&#39;s mean to others?&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It DOES matter, and it&#39;s very much not okay with us if he is mean to <br/>
others.  The usual way it&#39;s dealt with is to end the interaction <br/>
(somebody goes home); the consequence of being mean is that others do <br/>
not want to play with you and those kid&#39;s parents don&#39;t want you around <br/>
either.  They do frequently apologize to each other (on their own) and <br/>
work things out after cooling off. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Where are the parents (you) when all this is going on? Because if my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>child showed a lack of ability to respect other people&#39;s boundaries <br/>
then I would stay VERY present at all times or keep other people away <br/>
from us until that child could handle the social interactions without <br/>
hurting others.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
The meanness issue seems to be highlighted with this one boy.  When <br/>
they are playing together there is someone always there (me or the <br/>
boy&#39;s mom).  There can be a lot of interrupting and redirecting with <br/>
them if they&#39;re having a difficult day.  They are both pretty intense <br/>
personalities and do still need frequent help negotiating with each <br/>
other.  Most of the time they really enjoy playing together and it <br/>
works well, and then they hit a snag and it can unravel really <br/>
quickly.  We have discussed them not playing together for a while, but <br/>
when they do get along they have a really great time.<br/>
<br/>
My main concern is that ds thinks there are no &quot;consequences.&quot;  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to think that not playing together, leaving, having <br/>
friends (and their parents) not want to be around him, etc, <br/>
are &quot;consequences.&quot;  He interacts with a lot of kids in many capacities <br/>
and does have some difficulties sometimes.  Things get really big for <br/>
him really fast and then he will &quot;snap&quot; very quickly.  We really are <br/>
present and paying attention but it&#39;s often hard to catch the triggers <br/>
before they fire.  When they do we leave immediately.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I misread that at first to mean &quot;they&#39;re only (no more than just)  <br/>
children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But you mean each is an only child, I think.<br/>
<br/>

proceeded to tell the mom that &quot;I&#39;m not going to get in trouble and I  <br/>

<br/>
This is very bad.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The part that bothered me the most was ds&#39;s need to go  ring the  <br/>
bell and &quot;mouth off&quot; to the mom. --=-<br/>
<br/>
If you had been really clear about how horrible it was that he said  <br/>
it to the boy, would he even have thought about saying it to the mom?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything about it except explain it wasn&#39;t cool, so  <br/>
*I am* treating this situation differently. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible (I&#39;m guessing) that your unschooling involved a total  <br/>
turn-around instead of gradual change?  Did you TELL him he wasn&#39;t  <br/>
going to be punished anymore or something?   He seems to be using  <br/>
that idea as a club, and seems (from your accounts, if I understand  <br/>
them) to be taking it as a license to do whatever he wants to.  Abuse  <br/>
is WAY past &quot;not cool.&quot;  It&#39;s criminal.<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband were doing those things--kicking the neighbor,  <br/>
ringing doorbells and being threatening?  And it IS a threat to say  <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not going to get in trouble and I never will.&quot;   I would NOT be  <br/>
nice if a kid said that to  me, I don&#39;t care whose kid he was.  What  <br/>
it means is &quot;I can do whatever I want to do and you can&#39;t stop me.&quot;   <br/>
And that after he had just kicked her only child?<br/>
<br/>
-=-My main goal is, &quot;What&#39;s the lesson learned?&quot; and so far I am not  <br/>
confident I have gotten the point across. My words so far are  <br/>
obviously not working -- I could really use some suggestions on how  <br/>
to help ds understand that &quot;mouthing off&quot; isn&#39;t cool and that there  <br/>
is indeed a need for politeness and respect.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t let him out to play for a few days, at all.  If he asked  <br/>
to go out, I&#39;d say &quot;I&#39;m worried that you&#39;re not able to be nice  <br/>
enough to people,&quot; and then distract him with some offer of watching  <br/>
a video or having a snack.  I wouldn&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; him, but I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
let him out.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a dog that was scaring the neighbors, I wouldn&#39;t let it out.<br/>
<br/>
Take him out with you to the movies maybe, and lunch, and keep him  <br/>
busy and happy, but don&#39;t leave him alone with anyone else and if he  <br/>
starts to notice tell him it&#39;s not safe until he can be kind and  <br/>
gentle.  If he were squeezing or kicking a kitten, wouldn&#39;t you  <br/>
protect the kitten from him?<br/>
<br/>
And if the neighbor sees that he&#39;s not able to play, that will be  <br/>
proof that &quot;something happened.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it were my child, I would not let him be with the neighbor until  <br/>
he had apologized to the neighbor and the mom.  And I don&#39;t mean a  <br/>
memorized, forced apology.  I mean until he had actual remorse.  And  <br/>
if it took a week or a month or a year, I wouldn&#39;t back down.<br/>
<br/>
What your son does reflects on you.  And though others will say  <br/>
otherwise, it reflects on unschooling.  If unschooling is going to  <br/>
make him mean, then don&#39;t unschool.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t thing unschooling is the problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-948722597">Oh!  I meant to say maybe use those examples with him.  It could be  <br/>
humorously presented.  If you&#39;re out in a parking lot and see someone  <br/>
doing something you&#39;d like to do (someone with a nicer car, someone  <br/>
with a nice-looking friend or husband) you could say &quot;Oooooh.    <br/>
Should I go and kick her?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It might piss your kid off, but he would also be able in his own head  <br/>
to formulate the arguments against going over and kicking someone.<br/>
<br/>
We used a lot of humor here.<br/>
<br/>
Long ago when I was teaching 9th graders (14/15 year olds), sometimes  <br/>
there would be a fight, or more likely the muttering or talking of  <br/>
fighting.   A couple of times I defused angry situations with humor.   <br/>
When one kid at school was furious with another, that would be a  <br/>
little contagious, and his friends would get into the hope that there  <br/>
would be a fight.  When I caught wind of this one day, I said it was  <br/>
really bad to fight at school, because they&#39;d be suspended and their  <br/>
parents would have to come to school.  And I said in such a tone of  <br/>
voice that it was a really great idea, not sarcastic or shaming, I  <br/>
said to the kid in front of the others in the class &quot;Hey, get your  <br/>
mom to drive you over to his house and beat him up there!  Then it&#39;s  <br/>
not at school and you won&#39;t be suspended.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The very idea of the mom even KNOWING about it made the whole thing  <br/>
seem embarrassingly silly.  Everyone laughed and the tension was  <br/>
broken.  It worked so well that time, I used it another time.<br/>
<br/>
So possibly you could do something like that.  In the way of choosing  <br/>
between two things, you could jokingly say &quot;You&#39;re either going to  <br/>
need to go and apologize to his mom, or go and kick her again.&quot;  One  <br/>
choice is STUPID.<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t set it up so that one of his choices is &quot;act like  <br/>
nothing ever happened.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Male humans do that pretty well.  But  two problems:<br/>
<br/>
1) it&#39;s escalating, and he&#39;s using you, the parents, as back-up<br/>
<br/>
2) he insulted the mom in the doorway of her own home.  Females are  <br/>
NOT in the habit of letting insult slide as males do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-My main concern is that ds thinks there are no &quot;consequences.&quot; He<br/>
<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to think that not playing together, leaving, having<br/>

are &quot;consequences.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then don&#39;t use that word.  Don&#39;t use &quot;trouble.&quot;  Or redefine them both.<br/>
<br/>
Have you by any chance said you love him completely no matter what he  <br/>
does?  I hate it when parents do that, seriously. It&#39;s buying trouble  <br/>
and it&#39;s dishonest, or should be.  If Marty were to rape or kill  <br/>
Holly, I would NOT love him as much as I do now.  (Jesus, I feel  <br/>
horrible just having thought it!!)  My  mom was raped by her  <br/>
brother.  It would be nice if she had been the only one in all of  <br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
So  you have an only child and that image can&#39;t come to you, but if  <br/>
he&#39;s short tempered, look at that.<br/>
<br/>
Would he have any interest in taking a karate class?  Not a street- <br/>
fighting kind of martial art, but something about control and  <br/>
respect?  That could help greatly.  My oldest was a short-tempered,  <br/>
hot-headed kid who would throw things and break them, or grab his  <br/>
brother and pinch him.  We dealt with that directly by helping him  <br/>
learn to take deep breaths when he felt he was *starting* to get mad,  <br/>
not after he was already (and quickly) furious.  You should see him  <br/>
now.   And he was better almost immediately and increasingly, from  <br/>
the time he was little.  We&#39;d remind him, &quot;breathe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe suggest that to your son, that he IS responsible for his own  <br/>
actions, and trouble won&#39;t come from you but from his own failure to  <br/>
be as good a guy as he should be, as he needs to be to get along.<br/>
<br/>
When he kicks, he&#39;s a kid who kicks (like a dog that bites is a  <br/>
biting dog), but if he can step out of reach of others when he feels  <br/>
he&#39;s about to get angry, he won&#39;t be able to hit or kick.  Just a  <br/>
step or two back  might be the tool he needs.  Breathing ALWAYS helps.<br/>

<br/>
Is leaving immediately always the best plan?  I&#39;ve been around  <br/>
families that do that. What I&#39;ve seen work better is taking the kid  <br/>
off and away for a walk and a talk, and the proposal of some better  <br/>
behavior, or amends, or apology.  Helping him see how to calm down  <br/>
and reapproach the same person or group might be better than showing  <br/>
him to hit fast and run away.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree wholeheartedly with this.  There have been times that my daughter has been bossy <br/>
and not kind to children younger than her, and I see a side of her that I don&#39;t entirely love.  <br/>
When that happens and we talk, if I get the sense, like with this child, that she won&#39;t &quot;back <br/>
down&quot; from that position, I do feel a need to protect other children from that &quot;hardness of <br/>
heart.&quot;  And just as importantly, I feel the need to protect her from herself as well.  I want <br/>
to help her find her way out of the hardness and back into feeling whatever feelings put <br/>
her there in the first place.  There is no working with that hard place.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel like it is a much, much more loving act to help her to re-find herself in these <br/>
situations than to go on as though everything is fine.   I tell her that we will need to go if <br/>
she can&#39;t find kindness for everyone.  I&#39;m not talking about something false, like love for <br/>
everyone--but you can treat anyone with kindness.  And I don&#39;t say it punitively--more <br/>
matter of factly.  I explain that it isn&#39;t fair to the other child--and what I&#39;m talkiing about <br/>
is boundaries.  She has no right to infringe on another&#39;s boundaries--just like I&#39;d protect <br/>
her if I see someone infringing upon hers.<br/>
<br/>
I try not to be in situations with children that she doesn&#39;t like, but I can&#39;t always predict <br/>
who will be in every situtation, and it does occasionally come up.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times we&#39;ve left the situation, but more often than not she is able to <br/>
muster basic courtesy which may be enough.  I explain that she can feel how she feels <br/>
about that person, but she must be polite and not mean, or else we can&#39;t stay.  As she&#39;s <br/>
gotten older, if a situation does come up, she will often remove herself for a &quot;time-out.&quot;  <br/>
(These are self-motivated times to go collect herself.)  And if there is a child there that my <br/>
daughter has had problems with in the past, I pay much more attention to what&#39;s going on <br/>
to see if their paths are going to cross.<br/>

Some things I said to Kirby when he was younger (and the other kids  <br/>
too, in general, but it was rarely as pressing with the other two:<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t breathe more than your share of the air.  (That was plenty of a  <br/>
reminder to Kirby not to hog the literal or figurative atmosphere,  <br/>
especially when it was someone else&#39;s special day/outing/moment.)<br/>
<br/>
You *might* get your way a lot, but let it be other people&#39;s idea.   <br/>
(Being persuasive was okay, but being pushy wasn&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
Do things the other kid likes at least half the time.   (That&#39;s a  <br/>
guideline that is kind of a trick.  Really, they need to do things  <br/>
the other kid likes ALL the time, but if they thought it would be  <br/>
half and half, what happened was they became aware of what kinds of  <br/>
things they both liked, and stopped even bothering with things they  <br/>
were trying to foist on the other kid.)<br/>
<br/>
You want them to be glad you came over.  That one&#39;s important for  <br/>
adults, too.  For anyone.<br/>

natural or arbitrary consequence?  <br/>
<br/>
I am discussing a situation on another list where my 9 yr old acted <br/>
badly at a friend&#39;s house.He was there with his siblings and one <br/>
other friend. When he got upset he attacked his little sister. We <br/>
left right away,and the little sister started crying because she had <br/>
to leave too. It&#39;s true it is not fair that she should have to leave <br/>
when she did no wrong,especially when she was the victim. My other <br/>
son felt the same. I felt horrible that everyone including the friend <br/>
was being punished because of one kid&#39;s behavior,so I made a makeup <br/>
day with the two that acted fine and the friend,but I kept my 9yr old <br/>
home. When I mentioned this on the no more spanking list I was told <br/>
that I should not punish him for doing the best he can when <br/>
frutrated.I agree that he was doing the best he could and was <br/>
frustrated,but I also feel it was unfair for the other kids and that <br/>
I had to be prevent the situation from happening again. So, what is <br/>
right? What is fair? What is punitive?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been curious about this - how do you remove the playmate <br/>
without &quot;punishing&quot; the other kid, too?  They aren&#39;t usually playing <br/>
a &quot;thing&quot; that gets removed, they&#39;re playing with each other and then <br/>
one gets removed when there&#39;s a blow up.  Examples please?  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you by any chance said you love him completely no matter what <br/>
 </span></blockquote>he does?  I hate it when parents do that, seriously. It&#39;s buying <br/>
trouble and it&#39;s dishonest, or should be.  <br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
How do you convey that without it feeling like a threat?<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would he have any interest in taking a karate class?  Not a street- <br/>
&gt; fighting kind of martial art, but something about control and  <br/>
&gt; respect?  That could help greatly.&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-------<br/>
<br/>
We have suggested it several times but so far he&#39;s not interested in <br/>
anything that is &quot;class-like.&quot;  Part of that reason is that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like anyone telling him what to do or &quot;teaching&quot; him <br/>
anything.  This has been an issue since he was a baby - he was one <br/>
who didn&#39;t want to &quot;walk&quot; with fingers (would push you away), would <br/>
push his cart around the entire block while running but wouldn&#39;t walk <br/>
without it until he was sure he could do it unassisted, and one who <br/>
wants to do things differently than everyone else because &quot;why would <br/>
he want to do what everyone else is doing?&quot;  I can&#39;t tell you how <br/>
many times beginning from when he was a toddler (pre-unschooling) I <br/>
have heard teachers/adults say, &quot;I wish I could just break him!&quot;  <br/>
That&#39;s a sentiment I&#39;ve felt as well, and one that led us to look for <br/>
ways to interact more respectfully with each other.  It has helped <br/>
tremendously and things are much better, but we still have a long way <br/>
to go.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that martial arts could be a really good thing for him <br/>
though and would love for him to find *someone, somewhere* whom he <br/>
would *want* to listen to (respect).  He&#39;s very athletic and enjoys <br/>
sports, but once there&#39;s coaching or evaluations involved then he <br/>
runs into conflicts.  He&#39;s an excellent skier, yet the coaches are <br/>
all frustrated with him because he just won&#39;t follow instruction or <br/>
listen in a group.  If it&#39;s one-on-one he does much better, but at <br/>
some point it&#39;s very limiting.  They put up with him because he&#39;s a <br/>
good athlete, but they really don&#39;t want to deal with him.  (Think <br/>
Bode Miller... whose autobiography reveals a similar type of <br/>
personality.  On an interesting side note, Bode was unschooled until <br/>
4th grade.)  He doesn&#39;t have any &quot;heroes&quot; or anyone he wants to be <br/>
like - he says he only wants to be like himself, which is great, but <br/>
is frustrating to &quot;inspire&quot; him toward something.<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe suggest that to your son, that he IS responsible for his own  <br/>
&gt; actions, and trouble won&#39;t come from you but from his own failure <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to be as good a guy as he should be, as he needs to be to get along.<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
These have been my words since he was little.  Even when we were <br/>
parenting traditionally we never found &quot;his currency;&quot; we never found <br/>
a &quot;control button.&quot;  The &quot;control&quot; that we&#39;ve found since unschooling <br/>
has been through cooperation and working together.  It goes a lot <br/>
further than the traditional ways, but there&#39;s still that &quot;heady&quot; <br/>
attitude of &quot;nobody will tell me what to do or how to do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-We really are present and paying attention but it&#39;s often hard <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to catch the triggers before they fire. When they do we leave  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; immediately. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is leaving immediately always the best plan?  I&#39;ve been around  <br/>
&gt; families that do that. What I&#39;ve seen work better is taking the kid <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; behavior, or amends, or apology.  Helping him see how to calm down  <br/>
&gt; and reapproach the same person or group might be better than <br/>
 </span></blockquote>showing him to hit fast and run away.<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes he&#39;s capable of renegotiation, but it often takes him a <br/>
couple hours before he&#39;s ready to deal with people again.  As he&#39;s <br/>
getting older, and the longer we&#39;re unschooling, he&#39;s getting better <br/>
at knowing when to quit, but it can still be a real challenge. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the replies!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this is harder when you are starting unschooling- it is a <br/>
different place between punishment and letting it all go-<br/>
<br/>
unschooling is NOT about letting a child get away with bad behavior- <br/>
that is why she said- keep him busy and when he asks you talk about <br/>
what happened and how it is bad and that you know he wants to go <br/>
play but if he treats people with meaness he really needs to stay in.<br/>
<br/>
it is not like a grounding either it needs to be with discussion- <br/>
about how you ought to treat people and maybe he is not ready to be <br/>
around the child or his parents if he acts like this so YOU spend <br/>
time with him so it is NOT a punishment- it is a what can we do <br/>
together kind of thing- <br/>
<br/>
it could be you are nearby for a while so you can step in and give <br/>
them some tools to solve their differences- ways to handle their <br/>
disagreements without it escalating to being physical.<br/>

It&#39;s not being grounded.  It&#39;s doing different, other things until he  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t.   I would try to persuade and reason and distract and find  <br/>
other things for them to do.  If I really couldn&#39;t find a way to make  <br/>
it better or one of the other kids couldn&#39;t (some of the older kids  <br/>
were good mediators), then I would assure the other kid that it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t his or her fault and I was really sorry, and we&#39;d get together  <br/>
again soon.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has suffered too much from other families (three of them I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking of) who would use Holly as a reward, and so if they didn&#39;t  <br/>
earn their time with Holly, Holly was punished too.  Those moms were  <br/>
using Holly as though she didn&#39;t have feelings.<br/>
<br/>
It happened most recently last year, and I called the mom and  <br/>
appealed to her not to cancel whatever it was, because it wasn&#39;t fair  <br/>
to punish Holly.  She said &quot;That&#39;s what she gets for having a friend  <br/>
who doesn&#39;t do what her mother tells her to.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
He sounds a lot like my youngest child. I think utilizing mainstream<br/>
parenting tools could be exacerbating your son&#39;s  oppositional<br/>
behavior and you might be going through a major transition right now.<br/>
<br/>
I can see how Jalen might do some of those things if we&#39;d punished<br/>
him. He&#39;s been raised in an RU lifestyle and I honestly think that has<br/>
&quot;saved&quot; him to a large degree. We still have some pretty challenging<br/>
moments, but we can now have a more &quot;normal&quot; social life where I&#39;m not<br/>
totally exhausted all the time trying to buffer him or stay away from<br/>
situations he can&#39;t handle.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t have a lot of friends over for years! We didn&#39;t eat out<br/>
much, we didn&#39;t put him into situations where we knew he&#39;d have a hard<br/>
time. THAT is what needs to be done when a child can&#39;t handle social<br/>
interactions. Give them space. Keep trusting that he will pick up new<br/>
and better tools, but he really needs a patient adult right there when<br/>
you have friends over...to keep things from getting to the boiling point.<br/>
<br/>
Keep him busy with things that interest him, take him out to places he<br/>
can handle for now and make sure he knows you DO love him no matter<br/>
what.:) I disagree with Sandra on that one. I don&#39;t think you have to<br/>
say you&#39;re agreeing with behavior to say you love someone. I dislike<br/>
certain behaviors VERY much, but still love the person with all my heart.<br/>
<br/>
I would try to find out why he felt so angry towards that mother,<br/>
enough to taunt her and go onto her territory to do it. What was the<br/>
motivation? He may not have words for it yet, but if you can get<br/>
inside his motivation it might help understanding of how to avoid that<br/>
in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I said was &quot;I need to know that Sierra is safe&quot; (or<br/>
whomever) when he was acting out. I didn&#39;t say &quot;You are being mean&quot;,<br/>
it was about pointing out other people&#39;s boundaries and needs. In a<br/>
very simple form too, because he can&#39;t handle much input.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~I can see that keeping a child away from others when they cannot act <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; safe and sane is sensible, but I cannot see how this is different <br/>
&gt; from punishment/grounding. Applying the dog anaolgy the dog is in <br/>
&gt; effect being punished for his behavior. ~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s more about setting the child up for success. If you know<br/>
they can&#39;t handle certain situations, then keep them away from those<br/>
situations or find ways to make it work better. If we put them into<br/>
situations where they don&#39;t thrive, that isn&#39;t going to help them grow<br/>
into better tools very well.<br/>
<br/>
Time is a wonderful thing that way.:)<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t even point out that I was keeping the child away from<br/>
anything, I&#39;d just do it. If it gets asked about, I might talk about<br/>
how we can make it work for EVERYONE (stating the &quot;I need to know<br/>
_____feels safe, how can we do that?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
My thing over the years is that everyone in our home needs to feel<br/>
safe. That&#39;s it.<br/>

<br/>
I guess &quot;completely&quot; and &quot;as much&quot; are the operative words here?  <br/>
Respect has been a big topic of discussion between my 6 y/o & me <br/>
lately.  He is very much into posing hypotheticals in which he does <br/>
something he knows is disrespectful and then asking me if I would <br/>
still love him.  My answer is always &quot;yes&quot; but with a follow-up about <br/>
how distressing the act would be to the disrespected person and how <br/>
he then would have to make things right for that person as much as he <br/>
could. <br/>
<br/>
What is your opinion on this?  Do you think that my response, in its <br/>
logical extreme, is tacitly giving him permission to be abusive?  I&#39;m <br/>
not asking rhetorically.  I really want to analyze this a little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420576469">-=-From Robyn&#39;s and other people&#39;s success with<br/>
being patient and kind with explosive kids, many fewer children are<br/>
punished or shamed for having sudden outbursts of pure neediness.<br/>
And interestingly, both Pam Sorooshian and I have been accused of not<br/>
knowing anything about having such children, because our two<br/>
explosive kids learned ways to deal YEARS ago with what some families<br/>
punish or ignore or exacerbate. Those who know our kids probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to guess which in each set of three was the scary-go-<br/>
nuts kid when they were younger, because we figured out loving ways<br/>
to help them recognize and deal with the emotions. And it&#39;s a<br/>
physical thing with some people, that their emotional biochemicals<br/>
come on QUICKLY, and hard. But they can learn to deal with it<br/>
cognitively and physically, for the good of their own health and<br/>
relationships, and for the good of others around them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Our dog stops if we say stop, but it&#39;s because she trusts us and  <br/>
wants to be cooperative.  Our neighbors cannot shush their dog no  <br/>

well?~~<br/>
<br/>
I tried not to do that as much as possible. The older siblings were<br/>
really giving that way...they understood that he simply needed more of<br/>
me, more of my energy and more protection from certain activities. I<br/>
tried really hard to find ways for them to get with friends in<br/>
environments where Jalen could escape with me (parks with swings,<br/>
campouts with trails etc..) if needed.<br/>
<br/>
There were many times I felt sad, because I knew they were getting<br/>
shorted. But what I learned in the long-run is that they really<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have learned anything great from seeing him NOT get his needs<br/>
met. It was obvious he needed more and for the most part, they could<br/>
let him have that. <br/>
<br/>
I remember some times where they were ready to leave an activity and<br/>
he just did NOT want to get off the swings (swings were really calming<br/>
for him) and someone would complain. I simply asked &quot;Can you give him<br/>
the gift of 10 more minutes, because he really needs this right now?&quot;<br/>
They were usually fine with that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a juggling act, not always a graceful one for sure. But<br/>
seasons change, things get better for him and for everyone one gentle<br/>
choice at a time. I blow it sometimes. We just keep refining and<br/>
getting better as parents.<br/>

<br/>
Same here.<br/>
There are a few children that are wired this way from birth it<br/>
seems.;) I would examine whether it is a trust issue or just something<br/>
that child has a challenge with.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen doesn&#39;t even hear &quot;stop&quot; when he&#39;s wired or angry and explosive.<br/>
&quot;Stop&quot; has to come in the form of a big, swooping hug or removal from<br/>
the situation (as gently and with his dignity intact<br/>
preferably...which takes some delicate maneuvering in groups) or<br/>
something that is physical because he literally doesn&#39;t hear or<br/>
doesn&#39;t care to hear in that rough moment.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s a lot easier to get everyone else away from him in the<br/>
moment. When I say &quot;give us space&quot; my kids know exactly what that means.;)<br/>
<br/>
As far as seeing the pattern, there isn&#39;t always one. There were<br/>
situations and behaviors I KNEW would probably trigger him...but lots<br/>
of times it seemed to come out of nowhere. It gets better. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s seven now and we&#39;ve had some big shifts in the last year. Mostly,<br/>
it&#39;s an up and down thing where the cycles keep me on my toes, but it<br/>
gets better and better overall. One good month usually leads to 3 or 4<br/>
intense months. But the &quot;intense&quot; months are so much better with each<br/>
cycle. That&#39;s the only pattern I&#39;ve really picked up on.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can see that keeping a child away from others when they cannot act <br/>
&gt; safe and sane is sensible, but I cannot see how this is different <br/>
&gt; from punishment/grounding. Applying the dog anaolgy the dog is in <br/>
&gt; effect being punished for his behavior. There is a definite <br/>
&gt; consequence here. A natural one would be if the other kids did not <br/>
&gt; want to play anymore because of his behavior,but is keeping him in a <br/>
&gt; natural or arbitrary consequence?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been said before, but I wanted to say again--this way of looking at things is from an <br/>
entirely DIFFERENT PARADIGM.  I used to speak and think in this way--conventional <br/>
parenting, with its focus on &quot;consequences.&quot;  It is very adversarial.  If you step back and <br/>
look from the lens of partnership of course you couldn&#39;t possibly let your partner go down <br/>
in a blaze and remain in the situation.  You wouldn&#39;t let your dog continue to misbehave, <br/>
because someone might get hurt, and/or he might be taken from you.  You wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
your child abuse another child, because it&#39;s not safe for the other child, and it&#39;s damaging <br/>
to your child&#39;s soul.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband and I are at a party and he&#39;s had a little too much to drink he gets very <br/>
chatty--not his usual m.o.  I know there is a certain point that is my cue to pull him aside <br/>
and make a small comment, because he really doesn&#39;t want to rattle on and ultimately <br/>
embarrass himself.  It&#39;s respectful and appreciated, and I have his best interests at heart.  <br/>
I&#39;m not thinking to myself, &quot;I&#39;ll let him make a fool of himself, our friends won&#39;t have him <br/>
over anymore, and that&#39;ll be the consequence of his behavior.&quot;  That would be mean!<br/>
<br/>
I think the word &quot;consequence&quot; has no place in parental language.  We should be talking <br/>
about respect, helping, supporting, modeling, distracting, communicating, holding, etc.  <br/>
Partnership words, not adversarial words.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to a mom new to our group a few weeks ago, and we noticed her 4 y.o. son <br/>
walking around the outside edge of a trampoline.  It looked potentially dangerous, so she <br/>
had a long distance conversation with him (yelled) about the &quot;consequences&quot; of falling.  It <br/>
was his decision, and if he chose to do what she clearly thought he shouldn&#39;t do, he would <br/>
suffer the consequences.  That was it--no support, no offer to hold a hand or to spot <br/>
him--just making sure he &quot;understood the consequences&quot; of his decision.  If he had <br/>
actually fallen and gotten hurt, what would that do to the level of trust he has in his <br/>
mother to keep him safe?<br/>
<br/>
Life has plenty of it&#39;s own consequences--we don&#39;t need to engineer them or wield them <br/>
like a club over our kids heads.  I feel like it&#39;s my job to help my kids navigate and avoid <br/>
the foreseeable ones.  I want them to be able to trust in the adults around them to be on <br/>
their side, not standing around saying, &quot;I told you so&quot; as they nurse their hurts and <br/>
disappointments.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I get this but I&#39;m not so sure a child still wouldn&#39;t see it as a <br/>
punishment. That&#39;s why I asked how you make it not *seem* like <br/>
punishment to the child. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give an example that happened with us recently. My 4yo has a <br/>
7yo friend who lives in the house behind us. My 4yo says they <br/>
are &quot;bestest&quot; friends. Most of the time they play outside in our <br/>
adjoinging backyards but sometimes they go inside this other boy&#39;s <br/>
house. Two things happened recently that caused me to decide my son <br/>
cannot go into this other boy&#39;s house anymore.<br/>
<br/>
The first was that the boy has asked repeatedly if my son can watch <br/>
very scary movies like The Hills Have Eyes or play video games like <br/>
Grand Theft Auto. I don&#39;t necessarily have anything against these <br/>
moveis and videos. However, I don&#39;t want my son being exposed to <br/>
these things at someone else&#39;s house when I&#39;m not there to judge his <br/>
reaction, discuss things with him, etc. So, I&#39;ve asked the other boy <br/>
not to watch/play those video games while my ds is there. My ds has <br/>
not expressed any desire to watch those movies or the play the video <br/>
games. It was all the other boys suggestion. He said he would not <br/>
but I later found out they &quot;accidentally&quot; put in a R-rated movie <br/>
that scared my ds a lot.<br/>
<br/>
The second (and last straw) happened the last time my ds was over <br/>
there. He came (not upset) and at some point while telling me about <br/>
what they were doing over there said the other boy hurt him. I asked <br/>
what happened and was told the other boy purposely choked my ds with <br/>
nunchuks and my ds couldn&#39;t breathe and it hurt. I asked if the <br/>
adult there did anything. My ds said, &quot;No. She wasn&#39;t there.&quot; I <br/>
think she was in the living room and the boys were in the bedroom <br/>
and she probably didn&#39;t know what was going on. That&#39;s when I told <br/>
my son that he could not play inside that other boy&#39;s house anymore <br/>
because I didn&#39;t think it was safe. As soon as I told my son then he <br/>
started to backtrack and say it didn&#39;t hurt him and it wasn&#39;t a big <br/>
deal and the other boy only did it for a second. The next day my son <br/>
also told me the other boy has a game he plays that is secret so my <br/>
son is not allowed to tell anyone else about it.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was invited over again and I said he couldn&#39;t go, my son <br/>
was very angry with me. He cried and screamed and said I made his <br/>
friend go away. I carried my son inside and sat with him on the <br/>
couch while he cried and then we watched some TV and sat together <br/>
after he calmed down a bit. He periodically got upset all over again <br/>
and I would hold him (if he let me) and tell him again why I didn&#39;t <br/>
think it was safe. Even though to any adult that wouldn&#39;t look like <br/>
a punishment of my son in anyway (and it wasn&#39;t since he hadn&#39;t done <br/>
anything to cause the situation), he still felt like it was <br/>
punishment.<br/>

I agree with this, too. I think it&#39;s very important to make a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250528579">If your principle is to keep your son safe it is important to keep the lines of communication open. If your son belives that telling you about dangerous play or r rated movies will result in him being not allowed to play with his bestest friend, I am guessing he&#39;ll stop talking about those things with you. And that seems really unsafe to me. I would really work to try and come up with ways that they can play together. Rather than making it bad or wrong that they accidently watched a scary R-rated movie, commiserate. Depending on the movie see if you can find some making of stuff about the movie and watch some completely removed from fear sort of moments that dissect the movie. Help him to feel strong enough in that relationship to say no if he doesn&#39;t want to watch a movie, or no to playing with nunchuks. Make coming over to your house really fun. Linnaea has a friend at whose house I&#39;m reticent to have her spend the night. Not actually because of<br/>
 tension between Linnaea and her friend, but because Linnaea and her friend&#39;s older sister have come to near blows. And I know that the parents aren&#39;t that responsive, they don&#39;t move fast for a fight. If Linnaea wanted to spend the night, I would let her, but she knows what my reservations are, and she, at this point, agrees and is fine with being the hostess to sleepovers. Her friend actually prefers to spend the night here, as well, so there isn&#39;t a conflict of desires going on and no one feels that this is a punitive action on my part. <br/>
<br/>
Linnaea has been the younger friend in a few relationships and she had boundaries pushed probably more than if she had been with a child of her own age. I don&#39;t have a problem with that, but it is an aspect of having different aged friends. <br/>

after he calmed down a bit. He periodically got upset all over again <br/>
and I would hold him (if he let me) and tell him again why I didn&#39;t <br/>
think it was safe. Even though to any adult that wouldn&#39;t look like <br/>
a punishment of my son in anyway (and it wasn&#39;t since he hadn&#39;t done <br/>
anything to cause the situation), he still felt like it was <br/>
punishment.<br/>
