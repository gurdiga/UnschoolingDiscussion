&lt;&lt;Science Buffs, Are you there?<br/>
<br/>
I got this e-mail today and think it sounds pretty ridiculous.  I pulled<br/>
<br/>
out the book that came with my microwave oven (installed in 1994, book<br/>
<br/>
written in 1991).  It says that 2:30 at high power can be used to heat a<br/>
<br/>
cup of water for coffee, tea, or hot chocolate.  There are no precautions<br/>
<br/>
anywhere related to the following e-mail.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You know, we found this question in our Aristoplay/Nova  &quot;True Science&quot; game <br/>
this week.  (Or something similar.)  It claims that water lower down in your <br/>
tea cup can be superheated beyond the boiling point and can explode into a <br/>
boil when your tea bag disturbs the water.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not sure I saw the original post yet, so I may be missing the point.)<br/>
