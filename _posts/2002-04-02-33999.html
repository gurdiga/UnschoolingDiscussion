e2.htm&quot;&gt;Read the questionnaire&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; By Ed Oliver<br/>
&gt; When Diane Neely took her 13-year-old daughter Amanda for a check-up at<br/>
&gt; Pediatric Health Care Associates in Peabody recently, she became angry<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; the nurse covertly gave the girl an intrusive questionnaire.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was the first time they had gone to that doctor who was listed in the<br/>
&gt; health care directory of their provider, CIGNA PPO.<br/>
&gt; &quot;My daughter was sickened and felt horribly violated to being asked such<br/>
&gt; questions,&quot; she says. The daughter told her, &quot;These are not things that<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; ask people like me. I&#39;m only 13 years old, for heaven&#39;s sake.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Neely told the pediatrician how offended she was and that she did not<br/>
&gt; appreciate the office giving anything to her daughter behind her back.<br/>
&gt; The doctor replied, according to Neely, state law requires that all<br/>
children<br/>
&gt; are treated as if they are promiscuous and doctors have every right to<br/>
offer<br/>
&gt; sexual advice, birth control, etc. without parental permission.<br/>
&gt; Neely says, &quot;I am so sickened. My daughter is a sweet, innocent girl who<br/>
&gt; believes in God and never even dreamed of the horrible things she was<br/>
asked.&quot;<br/>
&gt; She said her daughter has attended a Christian school in New Hampshire<br/>
since<br/>
&gt; fifth grade.<br/>
&gt; The form asks for information about guns in the home, fighting in the<br/>
home,<br/>
&gt; friends&#39; behavior, sex and drug activity, etc.<br/>
&gt; Nev Moore from the parents&#39; rights group, Justice for Families, tells<br/>
&gt; MassNews, &quot;This questionnaire is not only invasive, it is deliberately<br/>
&gt; designed to undermine parental authority and decision-making, without the<br/>
&gt; parents even being aware of it. In addition, it is a sneaky device used to<br/>
&gt; manipulate children to unwittingly disclose information about their homes<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; parents that can then be distorted and used to open the door for the state<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; enter our homes and lives and take control of them.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Not State Law<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; MassNews was interested in finding out what state law mandates an<br/>
intrusive<br/>
&gt; questionnaire to a young girl at the doctor&#39;s office without her parent&#39;s<br/>
&gt; knowledge. We also wanted to know what the relevance some of the questions<br/>
&gt; were to a check-up, and whether DSS was behind this form in any way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The pediatrician, Dr. Miriam Dunau, did not return repeated calls from<br/>
&gt; MassNews seeking comment. MassNews even visited her office, but she would<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; come out to discuss the matter. The receptionist gave the reporter the<br/>
name<br/>
&gt; and contact number for &quot;Neal Stephany,&quot; the supervisor located at another<br/>
&gt; office. Pediatric Health Care Associates has 6 offices in the area.<br/>
Stephany<br/>
&gt; would not return calls either. The head of nursing, Ann Costa, also did<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; return calls.<br/>
&gt; MassNews called the Mass. Board of Registration in Medicine, which<br/>
regulates<br/>
&gt; doctors, to find out if there is a requirement to interrogate children<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; an intrusive questionnaire.<br/>
&gt; Spokesperson Claudette Houle told MassNews the Board of Registration does<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; have any regulation associated with teen questionnaires.<br/>
&gt; According to Neely, Dr. Dunau later called her and said it was<br/>
inappropriate<br/>
&gt; to send a reporter to &quot;harass&quot; her and turn the incident into a big<br/>
circus.<br/>
&gt; Neely answered that it was inappropriate for the doctor to give an<br/>
intrusive<br/>
&gt; questionnaire to her daughter behind her back.<br/>
&gt; According to Neely, the doctor then told her she must have misunderstood<br/>
&gt; about the form or else Dunau didn&#39;t explain it right during their argument<br/>
&gt; that day. The questionnaire, she said, was a clinic form and not required<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; state law. She said the law does permit them to ask about and dispense<br/>
&gt; contraceptives, and if she objects to the questions on the form, she has<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; right to go elsewhere.<br/>
&gt; &quot;She changed her story,&quot; said Neely, who is considering filing a complaint<br/>
&gt; with the Board of Registration in Medicine. &quot;All of a sudden there is no<br/>
&gt; state law.&quot; She said she not only objects to the questions, but at the<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; top of the form they go behind her back.<br/>
&gt; Neely says, &quot;Now my eyes are open.&quot; She hopes other parents will also be<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the lookout for snooping by their doctors. </span></blockquote></div>

You are making me think too early in the morning! Math jokes, at 8:00 a.m.? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pied on March 14.<br/>
<br/>
To be more precise, it would be at about 2:00 a.m. on March 14, right? Or maybe that thought is irrational. :-)<br/>
