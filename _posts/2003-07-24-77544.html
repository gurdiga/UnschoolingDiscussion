<div id="ygrps-yiv-407342027">&quot;On another network&quot;  it is being claimed that on this list people are <br/>
&quot;called names.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been called names.  But usually by people who aren&#39;t being very <br/>
rational, so I don&#39;t take it personally.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any &quot;names&quot; people have been called to throw out here so we <br/>
can consider whether that claim is true?<br/>
<br/>
The claim was (I think, from what I was forwarded) that the main core of <br/>
people here (? or just me?  me and some?) call people names, and that it&#39;s all in <br/>
the archives.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true, and since there are some people on both lists, I <br/>
thought if it IS true, people here should be easily able to name those kinds of <br/>
names people have been called.   I know I&#39;ve said lots of times that some <br/>
recommended or proposed action or behavior wasn&#39;t the closest way to get to <br/>
unschooling.  I can&#39;t think of times it involved calling a person a name.<br/>
<br/>
Without quoting who and to whom, can we come up with a list of these names <br/>
people have been called?   If it&#39;s true, I&#39;m just losing my memory, I guess.  <br/>
Help!<br/>

fact I feel that people generally go out of their way to be tactful.  As <br/>
&quot;unschoolers I think that rulles would drive us away and that we are a tolerant <br/>
group. I goes with philosopy, in my apinion<br/>

&lt;&lt;Without quoting who and to whom, can we come up with a list of these names<br/>

guess.<br/>
 Help!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;m going to take a stab at this but keep in mind I&#39;m just guessing<br/>
here. I have no clue as to why this all started and think the carrying on of<br/>
a few now, mostly over there, is just annoying and senseless.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I think, and take that for what&#39;s it&#39;s worth, the name calling for at<br/>
least one person, stems from some stuff awhile ago. I do remember someone<br/>
saying that if that&#39;s what you think then you must be as a dumb as a brick.<br/>
Didn&#39;t quote here as I&#39;m going on memory only. I do also remember possibly<br/>
one or two other times that something similar has been said. There have been<br/>
*ifs* and *must* and *maybe&#39;s* used and never anyone that I recall saying<br/>
&quot;blank you are as dumb as a brick.&quot; So actual name calling to a person I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen. Some have gotten annoyed and made statements that probably<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have been posted. I include myself in on that one. I do think that<br/>
when one poster in particular is riling up the rest, it is better after<br/>
seeing that they are not going to at least listen, to just not post at all.<br/>
That for some people though is easier said that done. I understand that, I<br/>
think most her do too. I&#39;ve gotten upset on this list a couple of times but<br/>
just don&#39;t take it personally. Because of how I am, I have a hard time not<br/>
seeing how others can not take it personally either. That&#39;s something I just<br/>
can&#39;t understand and get annoyed with. There was once on this list and now<br/>
on the RUL where I just really want to post &quot;why don&#39;t you just shut the<br/>
f*** up!&quot; It&#39;s stupid. But I don&#39;t post that and just delete instead.<br/>
<br/>
In nutshell I don&#39;s see what all the crap is about. I understand how some at<br/>
first feel stepped on, but not giving any time to really look at the<br/>
situation and spouting off instead just isn&#39;t right. If some people that<br/>
come to this list have a hard time feeling like some think of themselves as<br/>
god like (my words here) then I feel like that&#39;s their problem. If someone<br/>
wants to feel like a know it all, it doesn&#39;t make it so. If someone else<br/>
believes it, it still doesn&#39;t make it so. I see the problem with the<br/>
bitchers.<br/>
<br/>
My not so humble opinion.<br/>

I have been reminded on the side that I called someone a liar.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember the circumstances exactly, but I do have this idea that if <br/>
someone says one thing and then says a different thing and denies having said <br/>
the first, I do tend to sometimes say &quot;then one of those things is a lie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t even need to know which one is true, at that point.  You  just <br/>
(sadly) have to exercise caution in believing anything that person asserts in the <br/>
future.<br/>

recall whether a person was called stupid or an idea was called stupid. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
OK, I see your point.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to feebly point out that it is the convention on e-lists to<br/>
quote what one is responding to.  Some people complain here about<br/>
atmosphere / harshness / attitude without ever giving examples.  Their<br/>
vagueness prevents any significant understanding or meeting of minds<br/>
from occuring. <br/>
<br/>
If people would quote *something* to protest about rather than<br/>
protesting *everything* there&#39;s a chance that the conversation would at<br/>
least deal with recent grievances rather than ancient grudges.  At least<br/>
I hope so.<br/>
<br/>
When tempers flare I&#39;d rather see someone quote one or two sentences and<br/>
say &quot;Hey, this hurt my feelings.  It sounds like you think I &lt;blank&gt;. <br/>
Is that what you meant to imply?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I admit this kind of exchange isn&#39;t directly on the *issues* of<br/>
unschooling, but it&#39;s a level or two more evolved and constructive than<br/>
&quot;Hey, you guys were harsh last week and I hate you.&quot;  There&#39;s not much<br/>
of a way to answer that criticism.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Consider this whole post a critique of those who critique the list<br/>
without quoting specifics.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71581296">Both the fat and happy quote and the &quot;crazed spank-o-matic&quot; quotes were not <br/>
direct name calling.  It was something like, &quot;When someone acts like a crazed <br/>
spank-o-matic&quot; or &quot;if you act like a crazed spank-o-matic&quot;...something like <br/>
that.  Same with the fat and happy....it was a discussion about how we should be <br/>
out there doing more to save the world and someone said something like, &quot;you <br/>
can sit around fat and happy and homeschooling your own kids, but turn your <br/>
back on needy people..&quot; and the &quot;you&quot; was meant generally like &quot;you-all&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always get involved in debates but sometimes read them ;o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I believe that was it.  And I am not saying I disagree with you because <br/>
what you say is absolutely how I feel, but I can see how Chris might have <br/>
thought you were calling her a &quot;spank-o-matic&quot;.  She was the only one defending <br/>
spanking as a good option. Even though you didn&#39;t call her a &quot;spank-o-matic&quot; <br/>
directly, like saying YOU are a spank-o-matic.  Sometimes it is hard to tell <br/>
yourself that people are discussing ideas not you personally especially if you are <br/>
the only one present on the opposite side of a discussion.<br/>

It&#39;s hard for me to play volleyball, so I don&#39;t play.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we should have to lower the level of our discussions to <br/>
accommodate people who can&#39;t participate in discussions without understanding that <br/>
we&#39;re trying to discuss issues and principles.  <br/>
<br/>
On a list about unschooling, if one is TRULY the only one on one end of a <br/>
discussion, it&#39;s probably not an appropriate topic for the list.<br/>

your quote mixed up with others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have to assume people can read and think - no point in the list, <br/>
otherwise. And we can&#39;t guess, in advance, who has the self-esteem or <br/>
strong enough ego or whatever to not take things personally, but to <br/>
stick with discussing ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Chris wasn&#39;t even SOUNDING like a &quot;spank-o-matic.&quot; I don&#39;t know how <br/>
someone could think that  the phrase could possibly be intended to <br/>
apply to her - we all knew already that she had spanked ONLY once ever <br/>
- she&#39;d told us repeatedly.  She wasn&#39;t defending being a frequent <br/>
spanker - she was defending a rare emergency spank. The debate was <br/>
mostly about whether even a rare emergency spanking was a useful thing <br/>
to do, and the &quot;spank-o-matic&quot; comment was an extension of that idea to <br/>
what would happen if spanking was a regular, frequent occurrence.<br/>
<br/>
IF I was a &quot;spank-o-matic&quot; makes it more clear that what followed <br/>
wasn&#39;t about Chris - that the one-time spanking Chris gave her son <br/>
wasn&#39;t what Sandra was referring to - that she was saying that IF <br/>
someone was prone to swatting frequently that a kid might rather brave <br/>
the parking lot than be within arm shot of his parent.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid someone taking something personally, when to the writer and <br/>
others it is perfectly clear that it is about an idea, not a specific <br/>
person, we&#39;d have to do what? Start every sentence with a disclaimer of <br/>
some kind?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In case anybody on this list considers themselves a &quot;spank-o-matic&quot; <br/>
then this may apply to you, but if you are not a person who spanks <br/>
their children automatically for every transgression, then please do <br/>
not take what I am about to say personally?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653172065">***&quot;On another network&quot;  it is being claimed that on this list people are<br/>
<br/>
&quot;called names.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
***Does anyone have any &quot;names&quot; people have been called to throw out here<br/>
so we <br/>
can consider whether that claim is true?***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m clearly lacking in interpersonal intelligence because I usually don&#39;t<br/>
think that means what other people think it&#39;s means.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m probably guilty.   I&#39;ve called people whiners.   I don&#39;t think I<br/>
ever said &quot;oh you&#39;re just a stinking whiner!&quot; but I have said &quot;If you<br/>
just came here to whine&quot;  or &quot;the people who come here and whine&quot;,  that<br/>
sort of thing. <br/>
<br/>
Certain individuals will read something like,  &quot;Calling your kid lazy<br/>
isn&#39;t very nice.&quot;  And it gets translated in their minds to &quot;You&#39;re a<br/>
terrible mother.&quot;    That&#39;s not a problem with the dynamics of this list<br/>
that&#39;s their own personal stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
In the latest fracas here I mostly remember the peaceful person using<br/>
words like hateful and snotty.&lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t ever remember anyone being<br/>
called a wart or a butt or a booger head.   THAT&#39;S name calling.   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;You are a frigging idiot *if*...&quot; was snatched up by one poster who<br/>
claimed ownership and then was offended.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone, (many?&lt;g&gt;) have gently (or not so)  implied I&#39;m immature, but I<br/>
am and so considered it an observation and not a judgement. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
So neener!<br/>
