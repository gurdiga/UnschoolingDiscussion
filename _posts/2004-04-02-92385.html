<div id="ygrps-yiv-589592353">One of the best author&#39;s I know is Ross Campbell, MD.  I personally sat under his leadership at a conference.  Phenominal man.  Fully believes children deserve respect.   The best book to begin with is &quot;How To Really Love Your Child&quot;.  Hope this helps.  <br/>

  I love to give &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by Sears and Sears as a shower gift. You <br/>
  may have something older in mind, but that book got us off to a good <br/>
  start, and it&#39;s pretty accessible to those with fairly mainstream views <br/>
  (which we had at the time).<br/>

Parent Effectiveness Training : The Proven Program for Raising Responsible<br/>
Children by Gordon, despite it&#39;s name.  I also loved The Seven Habit of<br/>
Highly Effective Families by Covey, Nonviolent Communication by   Rosenberg,<br/>
and Punished By Rewards by Kohn.  They all cover aspects of parenting and<br/>
communication.<br/>
