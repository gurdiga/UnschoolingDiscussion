<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584206328">This is so beautifully put, Diana!  I&#39;m keeping this, and sharing this, <br/>
and thought others would like to too. ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be in relationship, find what works for who your son IS right now, what<br/>
engages him and brings him joy. Provide lots of that. Over and over. To <br/>
his heart&#39;s content. When the heart is content the mind is open. He&#39;ll <br/>
learn in his very own way exactly what he needs to know. Trust is *so* <br/>
important. What you do matters. How you feel about what you do matters. <br/>
Even, perhaps especially, if you&#39;re the only one who will remember.<br/>
