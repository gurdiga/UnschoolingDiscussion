<br/>
Okay.  Thanks to the finder of this!!  (Ang, thanks!)  I&#39;ll put it on the <br/>
reading page so it will be easier to find next time (and if I find out it&#39;s <br/>
already there, I&#39;ll be truly embarrassed!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From here down is what I found while looking.  If I had read ALL my e-mail <br/>
before looking, I wouldn&#39;t have found this.  That could be good, or that could <br/>
be bad. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things below which have changed since it was written, <br/>
both about TV. &lt;g&gt;  One is we don&#39;t get TV Guide anymore, and people do channel <br/>
surf *kind of* (meaning I don&#39;t notice, and they usually know what&#39;s on, as I <br/>
did when I was a kid, concerning favorite shows).  Unless someone&#39;s sitting <br/>
down to do something with their hands and they want noise on, I don&#39;t see <br/>
anyone just clicking through channels.  More often they put on a CD or a video/DVD <br/>
if they want something just for background.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking for a clue to when it was written, and skimmed to find Holly <br/>
was four and Kirby hadn&#39;t started karate, so it was seven or eight years ago, <br/>
1995ish.  It seems it was an e-mail for one worried person, based on an e-mail <br/>
exchange with another one.<br/>
<br/>
Quote starts:<br/>
<br/>
This was sent in response to a worried mom.   Take what you can use and <br/>
forget the rest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If they&#39;re college-bound, don&#39;t they need to have studied history, <br/>
mathematics, science, literature, etc.?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt; Mine just wants to play and although I know play is valuable, I don&#39;t see <br/>
what he has learned from it (academically).  What about higher math, <br/>
chemistry, writing, etc.? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your kid is eleven years old!  Do you play with him?  Do you have pattern <br/>
blocks or board games or card games or computer games you do together?  There are <br/>
LOTS of opportunities to discuss things during play, to explain how things <br/>
work, why, what certain toys represent in the real world (playing Lego we&#39;ve <br/>
talked about real masonry, catapults, horses, armor, weapons---while messing with <br/>
plastic representations).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He forgot to capitalize, put periods, or quotation marks and his sentences <br/>
were incomplete.  Do you teach these things to your children? Perhaps you <br/>
don&#39;t use an actual program but gently show him how to punctuate or spell the <br/>
words?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mine aren&#39;t writing, except in a rudimentary way yet.   They see me and my <br/>
husband write all the time, though. I&#39;m not worried.  We always answer their <br/>
questions, and they&#39;ll ask.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you make them look up the words? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make ANYBODY look up words.  I&#39;ll look them up for them.  I&#39;m a <br/>
dictionary fiend, and nobody--adults, friends, relatives, nobody--gets away from me <br/>
without at least FAKING an appreciation for dictionaries. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; As Adrienne said, even to help the kids find areas they are interested in, <br/>
means work on her part.  She has to be aware that she needs to tell them to <br/>
do an art project, for ex..  She can&#39;t leave them totally alone or they would <br/>
do nothing productive.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she did art in front of them they would want to do it too.  If she NEVER <br/>
does art on her own, what makes her think her kids need to know how?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; For ex., unless she teaches them about composers or great artists or <br/>
Ancient Greece or latin, etc., she doesn&#39;t think they would ever willingly or <br/>
knowingly learn about these things.  As for writing, how will they learn the fine <br/>
points of grammar unless they are taught?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She can &quot;expose&quot; them to those topics without &quot;TEACHING&quot; them in a <br/>
structured, scheduled way.    The fine points of grammar are not necessary to those who <br/>
don&#39;t want to write.  To those who DO like that sort of analytical stuff, she <br/>
just needs to offer them the vocabulary and they&#39;ll figure out on their own.  <br/>
There are computer games, paper-games...<br/>
<br/>
I personally disagree with the limiting TV to 1.5 hours after 5:00.  Some of <br/>
the best stuff for kids is on PBS in the daytime.  After 5:00 things get iffy. <br/>
 Helen, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t have a TV.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if your child (like mine) has an interest in one area (Civil War), yet <br/>
hardly reads about it and never shows an interest in other historical periods <br/>
(mine does, luckily)?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Videos.  Novels.  Ignore the periods he doesn&#39;t care about.  He&#39;ll care <br/>
later, or he won&#39;t, and the world will still turn, and he can learn what he wants <br/>
WHEN he wants.  History is NEVER all learned.  It&#39;s all relative.  &quot;Knowing <br/>
nothing&quot; is impossible in this culture.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My son loves to read, but it&#39;s Berenstain Bears chapter books, Garfield <br/>
books, Superman comics, or Hardy Boys.  All twaddle.  No classic books, and he <br/>
has them all&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s too young.  Fifth graders in school are not reading &quot;classic books&quot; <br/>
unless forced, and then they&#39;re not very hard ones (with a few exceptions, which <br/>
being exceptions don&#39;t count).   You should be reading to him, if you want him <br/>
to &quot;know&quot; a certain book--&quot;classics&quot; are not easy, generally, and you could <br/>
read to him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;He says he loves science, but almost never looks at any of the many Usborne <br/>
books we have or other science-type books.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Read them to him, or pay him to read them aloud to you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He has a whole collection of civil war books, but only looks at the <br/>
pictures in the books.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a huge collection of non-fiction books, mostly history, and some of <br/>
them I only look at the pictures in, but when I need to look up details I can <br/>
usually remember by the pictures which books dealt with what subjects.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Word problems are almost impossible for him; I have to hold his hand and <br/>
guide him through them and basically do them for him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No big deal.   He&#39;s young.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Even in cooking, I don&#39;t think he can multiply fractions although he&#39;s <br/>
doing it on paper! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No big deal.   He&#39;s young.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; When we got 2 puppies this summer, he would not even read the books I got <br/>
him about puppy care and training! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you read them?  Did you tell him what was in them?  Did you read any to <br/>
him?  Did you ask him to look something particular up?  (He&#39;d probably read <br/>
other stuff on the side if he went hunting for a particular piece of information.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you teach (or attempt to) your kids anything formally?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She can&#39;t leave them totally alone or they would do nothing productive.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She thinks that but can&#39;t prove it, because she probably won&#39;t leave them <br/>
totally alone long enough to see what they would do.    At Halloween our kids can <br/>
eat all the candy they want, and if they don&#39;t like it we encourage them to <br/>
chuck it in the trash.  Other families ration it out, it lasts a month and the <br/>
kids eat every last crumb because it is VALUABLE.  Ours is cheap trash, and <br/>
half goes in the trash.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a study in economics.  I have forced my kids to watch TV if they weren&#39;t <br/>
getting along, and they&#39;d beg to get up and play and I&#39;d say &quot;wait until this <br/>
show is over.&quot;  &quot;We don&#39;t like it.&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t care.  Just sit.&quot;    I&#39;m <br/>
serious.   A couple of times, but it was all it took.   If I use their room for <br/>
punishment they&#39;ll see it as a prison.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My dau. channel surfs, so she probably would choose cartoons over PBS. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t channel surf.  Even before we had kids, we subscribed to TV Guide <br/>
and unless we know what&#39;s on and what we intend to watch, we don&#39;t turn it on.  <br/>
Kids have learned that from  us.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Rescue 911, Unsolved Mysteries&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting--we don&#39;t limit TV, but my kids have never seen either of <br/>
those shows. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
PBS has music, kid-shows, stories, science shows...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My dh makes comments to him like, &quot;You know, Ricky, when I was your age I <br/>
had already read Robin Hood and King Arthur.  I have them here for you to <br/>
read.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That probably isn&#39;t helping.  Ricky probably just feels more self-conscious <br/>
and might resist reading the books, feeling that when he does he&#39;s just <br/>
&quot;finally&quot; doing what  his dad wanted him to do, instead of what HE wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Science has never been an interest of mine.  I would fall asleep if he read <br/>
them aloud to me.  He likes science, though; I guess I&#39;ll have to lay them <br/>
out attractively so he&#39;ll see them and want to read them! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could be a genetic thing, then.  You have no interest in geology, biology, <br/>
meteorology, chemistry, physics, oceanography, botany, entomology, astronomy, <br/>
flight mechanics, electricity--NOTHING!?   Did school ruin your joy in knowing <br/>
how things work and what they are made of?   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I guess I&#39;ll get them down and tell him to go to it.  I&#39;m just not <br/>
interested in getting involved in them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re that boring and uninteresting, don&#39;t make him do them.   If you, <br/>
knowing what they&#39;re good for, can&#39;t stand the thought of touching them, don&#39;t <br/>
expect him not to pick up on that.  Maybe it would be better to let him wait <br/>
and get interested on his own than for him to sense that he&#39;s doing something <br/>
you think is odious.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; What would you do?  Just tell him to go ahead and read the books in his <br/>
library?  Plan a unit study?  Just read the novels together and rent videos?  <br/>
Give him projects (excuse me, suggest projects) to do?  He obviously wants me <br/>
involved since he could study it on his own any time he wanted to.  He wants me <br/>
to direct him, I guess.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ask HIM what he wants.  Have you done the museum/bookstore/library circuit?  <br/>
Costume books?  Foods of the period?  Architecture of the period?   Books on <br/>
guns, cannons, bayonets--whatever of the period?  I wouldn&#39;t petrify it into &quot;a <br/>
unit study,&quot; but be on the lookout for good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I feel like I&#39;m the one home schooling.  I read so much, at least 2-3 h<br/>
ours a day, at least.  About all sorts of things.  I read instead of cleaning <br/>
house, home schooling, paying bills, or whatever!  I want to learn italics so I <br/>
got me a book to learn how.  I wanted to learn about the Catholic religion; <br/>
I&#39;ve been reading tons of books.  I wanted to learn about British History--I&#39;ve <br/>
been reading biographies.  Will my kids ever do this?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES!<br/>
<br/>
Next level to work toward:   Forget about the concept of &quot;homeschooling&quot; and <br/>
try to move toward the idea that your home/life/family is involved in learning <br/>
all the time, so that you don&#39;t feel foolish learning all the time, and your <br/>
son can&#39;t think of any other way to live.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, what do you do in a day?  Or rather, what do the kids do? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today, support group meeting (I updated the list, which involved some phone <br/>
calls to get spellings of kid-names and verify some info), and I kept two kids <br/>
for moms who had stuff to do (surgery for ovarian cyst, in one case), and <br/>
picked up a kid in our group whose mom&#39;s car wasn&#39;t running.  Took five kids to <br/>
the video store to rent games (dollar day) and a movie, brought them all to my <br/>
house, counseled a depressed friend in Toronto, discussed history and <br/>
philosophy with a e-mail group from Ontario while the kids played video games, the <br/>
little girls played with homemade playdough and watched their videos, played <br/>
house, went back to the park hoping the jumpropes we left weren&#39;t stolen (they <br/>
weren&#39;t), kids talked about adding numbers.  1+2+3+ (etc. and all the totals, as <br/>
they went).  I wasn&#39;t in that conversation, although I was overhearing it.   <br/>
There was a big tag game in the front yard for a while, and a battle of knights <br/>
in the backyard, treehouse was a castle, kids had &quot;boffers&quot; (padded toy <br/>
swords)...   My husband came home with some groceries, grabbed recorders and music <br/>
and went to a Renaissance dance music practice.  There&#39;s another one here <br/>
tomorrow night (rehearsal for some dancing in three weeks), and I need to have the <br/>
living room clean enough for that.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think I feel (for what reason?) that I need to be there to see what he&#39;s <br/>
learning.  Maybe I should just let him do them on his own and tell me about <br/>
them or ask for help if he needs it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because teachers document stuff.  You want to do your teacherly job and <br/>
supervise and document.   Even if he does them on his own and does NOT tell you <br/>
about them he&#39;s still learning.   You have to develop a faith and a trust which <br/>
school conditioned out of you.  You&#39;re not the only one.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He&#39;s adopted!  I remember as a kid liking to collect rocks and bugs.  In <br/>
high school biology was pretty cool.  Chemistry, meteorology, mechanics, <br/>
electricity and physics--ugh.  In college I took zoology--just okay.  I think as a <br/>
kid I liked to learn about birds, too.  Oceanography--the creatures are pretty <br/>
&lt;g&gt;, amazing, really.  I&#39;m more interested in the people of science, their <br/>
lives.  You know, Madame Curie, Thos. Edison, Enrico Fermi, Louis Pasteur, A. <br/>
Bell, etc.  Don&#39;t really care about how things work or what they&#39;re made of.  I do <br/>
like math though--loved working out those trig proofs, doing Algebra <br/>
problems.   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AHA!!!!  Good.  There&#39;s hope for him not to inherit your problems.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
So it&#39;s amazing.    You remember LIKING science but you said science was so <br/>
boring you would fall asleep hearing your own child read to you.   That evil <br/>
conditioning again!    Don&#39;t think of it as science--granulate it.  Think of it <br/>
as &quot;a book about birds,&quot; and &quot;an article about volcanos&quot; and so forth. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even teach my kids the concepts of &quot;science&quot; and &quot;history&quot; and <br/>
&quot;geography&quot;--we&#39;ll say &quot;let&#39;s read about Rome&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s read about stars.&quot;  They&#39;ll <br/>
figure it out but by then they&#39;ll know the parts.    School messes people up.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; His grandmother had a real union uniform custom made for him.  He has a <br/>
cap, insignia, haversack, gun, canteen, etc.  He&#39;s been to the Gettysburg <br/>
re-enactment. He&#39;s taking drumming lessons; specifically civil war drumming!   He <br/>
plays civil war computer games.  He has a bunch of civil war movies.  He met the <br/>
director of the movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot;.  But he wants me to &quot;study&quot; it with him!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds wonderful!   I&#39;ll tell you what--I&#39;m the way he is but about the <br/>
middle ages.  We&#39;ve been involved in the Society for Creative Anachronism 20 and 19 <br/>
years, my husband and I.   By knowing the minutest details of one period of <br/>
history you get the idea that there are similar minute details about every <br/>
other one.  When I talk to friends who do civil war reenactment, or Regency (they <br/>
dance and play cards a lot &lt;g&gt;), I understand immediately that there are <br/>
certain foods, courtesies, superstitions, songs, etc. that they must have found out <br/>
about, and that they know WHY people were doing what they were doing (i.e. <br/>
that there are motivations out the wazoo concerning any historical period or <br/>
event), and it&#39;s more the concepts than the facts which are important.   <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is if your kid wants to learn about the Napoleonic <br/>
wars, it won&#39;t take him half a day to ask the important questions.  He already <br/>
has the grid in his head to fill out.   What were they eating?  How were <br/>
regiments communicating with one another?  Did their uniforms work for or against <br/>
them?   What was the command structure and how dedicated to their cause were <br/>
they?  What were their beliefs about the motivations of the enemy?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;BTW, are your kids involved in activities like music lessons, sports, <br/>
gymnastics, etc?  Do you do support group activities?  Our activities (and we&#39;ve <br/>
cut back to one music lesson and one sports lesson a week, each, plus support <br/>
group stuff) keep us pretty busy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, not yet.   The 4-yr-girl wants to take gymnastics and the boys were <br/>
signed up for a defense class which fell through and are kind of bugging us for <br/>
karate.  I have nothing particular against group activities except that I tend to <br/>
get sucked into management, newsletters, etc. whenever I get near a group <br/>
activity and right now I&#39;m trying to avoid any more commitments on our time and <br/>
energy.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; All is quiet and I want a thin mint girl scout cookie! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can eat just one!?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; a friend and the county extension agent are coming over to discuss whether <br/>
we want to start a 4-H group.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was hit up about starting a 4-H group.  Sound AWFUL.   (I must really be in <br/>
a commitment avoidance phase &lt;g&gt;.)    I was in 4-H as a kid.   Learned to <br/>
arrange flowers and identify seeds, and sang songs.  That part I could <br/>
handle--leading songs.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Is this all we need to do?  Sounds like fun!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like about six times as much as the best school in the country does <br/>
&lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine having a husband who would threaten me that HE (yeah right) <br/>
would put OUR children in school against my wishes.   My husband knows I don&#39;t <br/>
do things lightly, and he trusts me.<br/>
<br/>
As to having been a teacher, I was a radical teacher.  The things I believe <br/>
about how children learn were taught to me in college.  I was an English major, <br/>
but had the requisite 24 hrs of education classes, and had a psychology <br/>
minor.  When I taught I was (as I can&#39;t help but be) very analytical about which <br/>
teachers the kids liked and learned from and which were jokes.  It seems the <br/>
main factors are intelligence and enthusiasm, not method.  If there&#39;s that <br/>
electricity in the air of &quot;THIS STUFF IS COOL!&quot; then whether the kids are goofin&#39; or <br/>
answering questions at the end of the chapter, knowing that the teacher <br/>
really understands and enjoys the subject makes the kids believe there is actually <br/>
something there worth knowing.<br/>
<br/>
I never used textbooks.  I used dictionaries and made up my own exercises.   <br/>
I used a lot of humor.   I tried to make things memorable (appealing to <br/>
different learning styles, although I wasn&#39;t thinking of it in those terms in those <br/>
days--I just remembered having vivid memories of days/lessons in my youth when <br/>
there was an element of surprise).   I wasn&#39;t able to get out of <br/>
grading/scoring/comparing, and that was the worst heartbreak--&quot;giving F&#39;s&quot; and such.  I <br/>
will never, ever do that again.   My children don&#39;t fail.  I&#39;ll move the target <br/>
to make them successes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He complains about their attitude, that school isn&#39;t everything, but some <br/>
of it is in him still.  What can I do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wait.   Ignore.  Dodge.   When he sees your kids happy and enthusiastic about <br/>
things he&#39;ll know it&#39;s okay.  He NEEDS to see other homeschool families.   If <br/>
he won&#39;t read the books, read him the good parts in some natural fashion.   <br/>
If he complains don&#39;t defend yourself, but ask things like &quot;why does that <br/>
concern you?&quot; because he may talk himself into a corner and realize on his own that <br/>
it&#39;s a kneejerk concern.   If he pushes you might say that as you&#39;ve read and <br/>
studied and he hasn&#39;t, you feel insulted that he thinks he knows more about <br/>
it than you do, and you&#39;d be glad to discuss a particular book or article if <br/>
he&#39;s willing to read it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You are my hsing idol, oh great one! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH NO!!!   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And here I am looking at your descriptions and thinking your life sounds much <br/>
more interesting than mine!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Ever been to Medieval Times in Orlando or in NJ?  About 1,000 people fit in <br/>
there and you watch knights jousting while you eat without utensils and root <br/>
for your knight.  It&#39;s neat.  In Orlando they have a medieval village outside <br/>
with a falcon show, torture chamber, people weaving, etc. etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s one in California too.   I&#39;ve had friends who have been.  The bad <br/>
thing is that the people eating are wearing modern clothes, and the food isn&#39;t <br/>
period.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When we have feasts the food is fancier and documentably medieval (usually), <br/>
and everyone involved is garbed appropriately and we eat by candlelight.  They <br/>
don&#39;t do candlelit feasts around Virginia and Maryland, and the rest of the <br/>
country thinks they&#39;re weirdos for eating by electric light &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I really like those things, but I&#39;m so tired of IT (the organization, the <br/>
amount of work I keep being expected to do to maintain it) that the magic fades <br/>
and I take it for granted.   Nineteen years is a long, long time.  A lifetime!  <br/>
(Ask any 19-yr-old &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

I had forgotten making Marty and Kirby watch TV.     When they were little <br/>
pre-Holly sometimes I would get frazzled and we were in a very small house and <br/>
they were pinball boys sometimes.  They turned out okay, though Marty can still <br/>
be too loud too fast.</div>
