&lt;&lt; Hooo boy - that&#39;s a reach back in time.. hmmm If I&#39;m remembering correctly,<br/>
 we used push pins in the top corners and a couple more along the top<br/>
 strategically to keep it straight, and then we taped the pics to each other,<br/>
 rather than to the wall. I&#39;m gonna guess we did the same down the sides<br/>
 (strategic push pins) to keep it close to the wall. It did less damage (push<br/>
 pin hole wise) than the traditional posters that adorn college dorm walls<br/>
 cuz the pins were all along the edges of the wall near the corners. The<br/>
 collage was made up of mostly magazine pictures and captions cut into<br/>
 different shapes and then taped together.<br/>
