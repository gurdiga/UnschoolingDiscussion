One of  the things I sometimes say is along the lines of “Are you sure your<br/>
mother  will let you eat this? She may not let you come back if you aren’t<br/>
doing  what she says.”  I HATE FEELING AN OBLIGATION TO SAY THIS KIND  OF<br/>
STUFF. To be honest I think she is so happy to have a break, that all  that<br/>
would happen is that she would just give them a longer lecture  standing by<br/>
my front door in my presence, about all her rules, and the  little amount of<br/>
leeway they have would be lost. (It is too much to hope  for that they would<br/>
never come back.)<br/>
<br/>

I let the kids do what they want, but if I know it will be an issue I ask  <br/>
them what their mother will think.  I don&#39;t make any promises that I will  keep <br/>
it a secret--in fact I&#39;m going to display for the mother that I trust her  <br/>
kids as much as I trust my own.  <br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t have any M rated games here, since Jon moved out.  But I did  check <br/>
with a 9 yo kid the other day when he wanted to play a T game.  I  asked if he <br/>
usually plays T rated games at home.  He said his mother didn&#39;t  mind.  It&#39;s <br/>
not up to me to enforce their rules, but it&#39;s kind of me to  help the kid <br/>
remember that there maybe consequences at home for the choices he  makes while <br/>
he&#39;s here.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m really going to pass the buck to the kid to make the decision.  I  mean, <br/>
how can I display that I trust the kid if I don&#39;t give him an opportunity  to <br/>
choose based on what he knows?  <br/>
 <br/>
If their parent asks me to keep them from playing T rated games, I&#39;m likely  <br/>
to say something to the crowd to indicate the parent&#39;s preference.  But I&#39;m  <br/>
not going to enforce it.  I&#39;m going to let them choose.  I&#39;m not the  hall <br/>
monitor around here.  <br/>
 <br/>
The little girl Renee is displaying a deep need to have enough, I  think.  <br/>
She&#39;s empty.  I know Jayn is probably too young to get this,  but I&#39;d explain it <br/>
to my son, and he would likely give her everything she wants  until she gets <br/>
at least partly filled up.  I think pretty soon that she  would see that <br/>
you&#39;re not going to withhold anything, she won&#39;t want anything  else.  <br/>
 <br/>
In the restaurant I&#39;d say, &quot;It&#39;s okay, Jayn will share all the fries she  <br/>
wants!&quot;  If the other parent still objects, on the basis of good food vs.  bad, I <br/>
think I&#39;d call the waitress over and order my girl a sundae just to make  the <br/>
point.  But that&#39;s just me.  lol.<br/>
