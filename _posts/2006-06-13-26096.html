Worm Attacks Yahoo Email<br/>
Mass-mailing worm exploits a vulnerability in the Web-based e-mail,<br/>
but its impact is low.<br/>

<br/>
A mass-mail worm that exploits a vulnerability in Yahoo&#39;s Web-based<br/>
e-mail is making the rounds but the impact appears to be low, security<br/>
vendor Symantec said today.<br/>
<br/>
The worm, which Symantec calls JS.Yamanner@m, is different from others<br/>
in that a user merely has to open the e-mail to cause it to run, said<br/>
Kevin Hogan, senior manager for Symantec Security Response. Mass-mail<br/>
worms have usually been contained in an attachment with an e-mail note<br/>
encouraging a user to open it.<br/>
<br/>
The worm, written in __JavaScript, takes advantage of a vulnerability<br/>
that allows scripts embedded in HTML e-mail to run in the users&#39;<br/>
browsers. Yahoo users should be able to modify their settings to block<br/>
the zero-day exploit, Hogan said.<br/>
<br/>
Symantec rated the worm a Level 2 threat, one notch above its least<br/>
harmful ranking. Hogan said the worm did not appear to be spreading<br/>
widely, and he did not anticipate the threat level rising.<br/>
<br/>
How It Spreads<br/>
<br/>
When activated, the worms then sends itself to other users in the<br/>
victim&#39;s address book who also use Yahoo e-mail with the suffixes of<br/>
@... or @yahoogroups.com. The worm mimics a function within<br/>
Yahoo&#39;s Web mail called &quot;Quickbuilder,&quot; which allows a user to add<br/>
contacts in an address book from received e-mail, Hogan said. The<br/>
process, however, is transparent to the victim, he said.<br/>
<br/>
The harvested e-mail addresses are sent to a remote server. Users of<br/>
Yahoo Mail Beta do not appear to be affected, Symantec said.<br/>
<br/>
The worm also opens a browser that displays a Web page that does not<br/>
appear to contain malicious content.<br/>
<br/>
Although Yahoo&#39;s Web e-mail has not been fixed, users are advised to<br/>
update virus and firewall definitions and block any e-mail sent from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:av3@...">av3@...</a>. The subject line of the e-mail with the worm says &quot;New<br/>
Graphic Site,&quot; and the body says &quot;this is test.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo officials could not immediately be reached for comment. (end<br/>

New Email Threat Targeting Yahoo! Mail Accounts<br/>

What It Is<br/>
New Email Threat Targeting Yahoo! Mail Accounts<br/>
<br/>
Symantec Security Response today identified a new worm that exploits a<br/>
vulnerability in Yahoo!&#39;s Web-based e-mail program. The worm <br/>
JS.Yamanner@m  spreads itself to the user&#39;s Yahoo! e-mail contacts<br/>
when the user opens an e-mail infected by the worm. In addition, the<br/>
worm also sends these e-mail addresses to a remote server on the<br/>
Internet. Only people with an e-mail address that is on yahoo.com or<br/>
yahoogroups.com may be impacted by this worm.<br/>
<br/>
Symantec currently provides antivirus detection signatures to protect<br/>
Yahoo! Mail account users against the JS.Yamanner worm. Symantec<br/>
encourages these users to run LiveUpdate to ensure that they have the<br/>
latest security updates.<br/>
<br/>
Symantec Security Response is currently categorizing JS.Yamanner as a<br/>
Level 2 threat (on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being most severe). Users<br/>
of Yahoo! Mail Beta do not appear to be vulnerable to the worm.<br/>
<br/>
The e-mails can be recognized by the following title and contents:<br/>
From:<br/>
Subject: New Graphic Site<br/>
Body: This is test<br/>
Note: If users accidentally open an infected e-mail, they will also<br/>
see that their browser window is re-directed to the URL:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.av3.net/index.htm.">http://www.av3.net/index.htm.</a><br/>
<br/>
Yahoo! is a popular e-mail program and is not normally affected by<br/>
this type of threat. There is no patch at the present time and<br/>
Symantec is recommending that users ensure that they have the latest<br/>
security updates.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Protect Yourself<br/>
To reduce the possibility of being affected by the JS.Yamanner worm,<br/>
Symantec Security Response advises users to do the following:<br/>
<br/>
Do not open or view any emails whose subject line or address matches<br/>
those listed above. These emails should be deleted immediately. Ensure<br/>
that the latest virus detection signatures are being used. Both Norton<br/>
AntiVirus and Symantec AntiVirus automatically download the latest<br/>
updates, but users can use LiveUpdate to check for updates as a<br/>
precaution if they so desire.<br/>
<br/>
Email gateways should be configured to block emails received from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:av3@...">av3@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Firewalls should be configured to block outbound traffic activity to<br/>
