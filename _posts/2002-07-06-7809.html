<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508231589">My house is so quiet this morning.  The nephew&#39;s are gone the nieces are<br/>
gone, the extra dog, the two extra cats.   <br/>
After the fourth festivities we have no food left in the house and<br/>
there&#39;s a mountain of wet towels and I can&#39;t find the water sprinklers or<br/>
my good cake pans.  <br/>
<br/>
We went to a fireworks show in another town on the night of the third<br/>
because our little town doesn&#39;t do one.  We spent the fourth eating and<br/>
playing and the kids put the trampoline right beside the pool and tried<br/>
to launch each other in.  We had company and neighbors coming and going<br/>
until I couldn&#39;t keep track any more.  We stayed up late on the fourth<br/>
and helped everyone else on our street set the neighborhood ablaze.  One<br/>
of Kyle McIntyre&#39;s roman candles fell over and spun  itself under our<br/>
truck for a wild fizzing display and the whole street cheered.  <br/>
<br/>
Since the tenth of June we went from a one kid household to a six kid<br/>
household and now back to one.  Dylan had a wonderful time with all his<br/>
cousins and I don&#39;t know how I can make the rest of his summer stand up<br/>
to this last month, but we&#39;re planning a trip and some camping and hiking<br/>
and spelunking.   I&#39;m afraid nothing is going to seem as good as having<br/>
all those kids around.   <br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a great Fourth.  (and are recovering nicely) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re in the midst of it all right now.  We have cousins and <br/>
grandparents and aunts and uncles coming and going for the whole <br/>
month of July. (lighter traffic in June and August)  None of them <br/>
stay at my house because my mom gets a summer apt. next to the beach <br/>
and they all stay there, but we do get cousin sleepovers and trips to <br/>
the waterpark and all the other vaction stuff we have in our resort <br/>
town.  Every morning we wake up and are on the go, go, go.  I barely <br/>
keep food in my house these days because we are always up and out.  <br/>
My kids usually are ready for a little peace by the time it all ends, <br/>
but it is so much fun while it lasts, no matter how exhausting.<br/>
My ds 8 is sleeping at my SIL house tonight because other cousins are <br/>
there.  They were all here last night.  I had a motherly instinct to <br/>
say no and make him come home and get a good night sleep, but I would <br/>
have majorly been the bad guy if i had.  I got a girl cousin here in <br/>
the trade for my dd to hang with.  We spent the day at the beach and <br/>
the boys did a lemonade stand in front of my moms.  4 of them made <br/>
$18 and went to the arcade 2 blocks away with their winnings.  <br/>
Our summers here are a constant vacation.  <br/>

minute if I could from the far reaches of the Earth.  Well, Colorado and<br/>
Kansas (now, Germany.)   <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My ds Jack (5) has long hair.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dylan&#39;s always had his hair long until just May or so when he cut it. <br/>
It&#39;s not really short, but not as long as it was, almost to his waist. I<br/>
miss his long hair, but he doesn&#39;t miss the tangles, and the yanking in<br/>
Judo class.<br/>
