<div id="ygrps-yiv-568976551">Hi, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to check in and introduce myself.  I&#39;m a married mom to a <br/>
9 1/2 year old boy who hated public school.  Although he is very <br/>
bright, he has sensory integration dysfunction issues (although MUCH <br/>
improved thru Integrative Manual Therapy and homeopathy/ <br/>
naturopathy).  He scored above average in every area tested on the <br/>
Terra Nova in 2nd grade, even a 99% in science, but he absolutely <br/>
couldn&#39;t stand a single thing about school and he began to get angry, <br/>
defiant, depressed, sad, hopeless, enraged...<br/>
<br/>
So, we started unschooling in October of 2001, very loosely, I might <br/>
add, as I feel that my son, Dylan, is still decompressing to a <br/>
degree, and here we are in Feb., 2002!  He is, once again, happy-go-<br/>
lucky, loving and generous, and he feels very sorry for every child <br/>
who must attend public school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m attempting to utilize exciting and interactive software covering <br/>
core subject information, and he&#39;s recently discovered Calvin & <br/>
Hobbes, so we&#39;re now able to incorporate reading which he was <br/>
adamantly opposed to before he &quot;found&quot;  Calvin!  <br/>
<br/>
Math being one of his most hated subjects, I was thrilled to find a <br/>
website www.naturalmath.com which sparked quite an interest in me, <br/>
although I found it cumbersome and difficult to read and understand, <br/>
at times. <br/>
<br/>
*** I AM INTERESTED IN ANY INFORMATION YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING <br/>
INTEREACTIVE SOFTWARE, BOOKS, WORKBOOKS, TUTOR/MENTOR GUIDES, <br/>
MANIPULATIVES, OR ANYTHING ELSE REGARDING NATURAL MATH. Any info <br/>
would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!  Freedompanther</div>

 </span></blockquote>People often mistake the word unschooling for homeschooling. Unschooling is<br/>
actually a philosophy of homeschooling, which by it&#39;s very definition is<br/>
loose! You can&#39;t get much looser than unschooling ;-) It gets defined<br/>
(rather inadequately) as child-led learning, natural learning, interest<br/>
driven learning.<br/>
<br/>
As a general rule unschoolers don&#39;t divide the world into subjects. There&#39;s<br/>
just life :-) Though sometimes we share resources it may not be as much as<br/>
you&#39;d like. We tend more towards discussing learning from life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621215854">You&#39;re story sounds like mine. My son (who&#39;s 10) started attending an <br/>
unschool school in september and is still decompressing from public school. <br/>
He still has a hatred of anything academic, but he very much wants to learn <br/>
Japanese and any and all computer programming languages. He hates math too, <br/>
so the most I can get him to do is play games, but he is also responsible for <br/>
budgeting his own lunch money for the month(His school is in a city <br/>
neighborhood so he goes out to eat or goes to a 7-11 almost every day)<br/>
<br/>
       However, the fact that he has changed from being an angry, uptight, <br/>
worried little boy to a happy, thoughtful, curious , repsonsible and <br/>
self-confident 10 year old is amazing. Right now I don&#39;t care if he does any <br/>
academics this year, I&#39;m glad that he has become this wonderful person.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would consider Sudbury Valley schools to be an unschool school.<br/>
Maybe it should be an unschooling institution though instead of<br/>
school. (And if that particular program actually follows the<br/>
Sudbury Valley model.)<br/>
