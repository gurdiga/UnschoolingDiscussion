Students seeking admission to United States colleges have mostly<br/>
heard by now about whether they got into the college of their<br/>
choice for the next school year. The time is NOW for students in<br/>
the tenth grade (&quot;high school sophomores&quot;) to prepare for getting<br/>
into college. I have a free on-line resource for parents and<br/>
students preparing for college, with special helps for<br/>
homeschooling families. That&#39;s the &quot;Colleges That Admit<br/>
Homeschoolers FAQ&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html">http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html</a><br/>
<br/>
which is designed to answer the questions many people have about<br/>
homeschoolers being admitted to college and to link to other<br/>
on-line resources. The Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ is<br/>
recommended by professional journalists and other researchers, for<br/>
example the editors of the Newsweek magazine October 5, 1998 cover<br/>
story about homeschooling and the Education Week recent story<br/>
about homeschoolers and college admission<br/>

<br/>
Check the main FAQ page<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html">http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html</a><br/>
<br/>
and the several linked subpages for information about more than<br/>
1,010 accredited colleges known to have admitted homeschoolers,<br/>
including links to more than 990 college Web sites. The subpages<br/>
of the Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ include pages on<br/>
college ratings, financial aid for college study, books on the<br/>
college admission process, and more. Feel free to link to the<br/>
&quot;Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ&quot;<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html">http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html</a><br/>
<br/>
if you keep a Web site of your own, and tell your friends about<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If your favorite college isn&#39;t listed on the FAQ, please contact<br/>
it to see whether it has admitted homeschoolers (which it probably<br/>
has) and then let me know. I&#39;m always eager to add names of<br/>
accredited colleges to the FAQ, based on verifiable information<br/>
from people in the know. I owe a big thank you to hundreds of<br/>
parents and college admission officers who have helped me<br/>
personally verify the names of more than 710 colleges that have<br/>
admitted homeschoolers. Your reports confirming, correcting, or<br/>
clarifying the information in the FAQ are always welcome.<br/>
