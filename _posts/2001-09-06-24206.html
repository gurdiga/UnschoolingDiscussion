&lt;&lt; Tanya and Dawn have hit on something I would like to ask others their <br/>
opinion of, bedtimes. What do you folks think about having bedtimes? Do many <br/>
of you find your children often open up and want to discuss everything <br/>
personal to them at bedtime? When my children need sone individual time or <br/>
something is heavy on their hearts, they ask to sleep with me. My husband is <br/>
on the road most of the time so we usually end up having deep converstions <br/>
late into the night with the older children. Right now we have bedtimes but I <br/>
am considering changing it.<br/>

daylight lengthens so does this kids clock. She has difficulty falling <br/>
asleep,always has actually. I try and get her in there around 9 and I usually <br/>
emerge half asleep after 10. I read the whole time and tell a story. She gets <br/>
up around 8:30 at the latest. I have tried waking her early but it makes her <br/>
surly and the day goes to hell.<br/>
<br/>
   I envy parents whose children go to bed at 7:30. But it wouldn&#39;t work in <br/>
this family during summer. Dh and I are both mountain bikers and each night <br/>
it is a tag team event. Who is running or riding (not enough time for both to <br/>
ridr in one night). Summer is exhausting but so short here you miss it <br/>
terribly soon enough. Each year we say we&#39;ll come up w/ a better plan. Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
   I would love to spend more time w/ dh. I hardly hear about his day <br/>
anymore,we are both asleep by 11.<br/>
