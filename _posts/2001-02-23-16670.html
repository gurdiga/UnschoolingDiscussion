<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206317748">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been unschooling for a while.  I have an almost 7 year old.  I have<br/>
a friend who&#39;s a big unschooler and have go loads of info from her.  I&#39;m<br/>
currently reading &quot;Escape from Childhood&quot; by John Holt.  I also<br/>
currently have &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; by John Holt.  This talks about<br/>
how children begin to read, write and count as they investigate the<br/>
world, without being taught.   I think it&#39;s re-assuring as a parent when<br/>
we can realize what we do that fits in with learning the &quot;basics&quot; and it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean we are not unschooling.  I think children naturally what to<br/>
find out about everything.<br/>
<br/>
blessings,<br/>
Sherry</div>
