<div id="ygrps-yiv-551020860">Hi. I wrote a while back with another question, and you were all so <br/>
helpful that I thought I would write again. I think I am handling <br/>
this OK, but would like some advice if anyone is willing to give it. <br/>
My 11 year old keeps asking me to give him a curriculum. He wants to <br/>
do school at home. All the subjects, specifically. At first I was <br/>
asking him what he wants to do, and he said a few specific goals <br/>
like cursive writing and math in general. I asked him if he wanted a <br/>
cursive book, and he decided he just wanted a sheet to show the <br/>
cursive letters so he could work on them himself, so I gave that to <br/>
him. I asked him if he wanted a math book or just to work on math <br/>
together, he wanted a math book. I got some developmental math <br/>
books, Key to... books and miquon, and thought he could see if that <br/>
was what he wanted. He liked the books. He did work on the cursive <br/>
and math one day and then left them alone. It has been about a month <br/>
since that happened. I did not bug him about it, or push him to do <br/>
it. The past couple of days he has been asking me again about doing <br/>
a curriculum. I asked him once again what he wanted to &quot;do&quot;, and he <br/>
said... math, science, reading writing, history, - a realy <br/>
curriculum. I remided him of the books I purchased for him and he <br/>
said that was fine , but he wanted everything. He said he wants to <br/>
be prepared to take his GED when it was time and that I need to <br/>
force him to do his work. He wanted me to go back to a couple of <br/>
years ago when I did not know any better and make him do his work. I <br/>
am sensitive to this because we both ended up in tears when that <br/>
happened. I don&#39;t want to go back to that, and I have told him so. I <br/>
asked him if he would like me to get him a mentor and he can work <br/>
with them, and he said no. So, I am working with him, but I told him <br/>
that it has to come from him. I can wake him up in the morning and <br/>
remind him that he wanted to do some work , but I will not struggle <br/>
with him to do it. I am going to try and just figure out what he <br/>
wants to learn, and be there for him. <br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that he is stressed because our homeschooling <br/>
groups have mostly kids that school at home, and people ask him all <br/>
the time what he is doing. I think maybe he is trying to fit in, or <br/>
feels scared that he will not get to go to college or work or <br/>
anything if he does not go. I am trying to just keep the <br/>
communication going, and give him examples of what he &quot;is&quot; learning <br/>
all on his own. Life has been really good since we started <br/>
unschooling. I realize that he is much older now, and a lot more <br/>
mature, so maybe he could handle &quot;school at home&quot; better, but that <br/>
is not what I want. We will se what happens, I just thought that if <br/>
anyone had any advice on workbooks, or things that might get him <br/>
going that I may have not thought of, it would give me some more <br/>
insight. I know that he is asking for a reason, and maybe I am just <br/>
making it more difficult than it has to be. People in my <br/>
homeschooling group think I am crazy, because my son is begging to <br/>
do work and I have such a relaxed attitude towards it, but I truly <br/>
think that by forcing him even when he is asking is not the answer. <br/>
I like a more realistic approach.  <br/>
<br/>
IF you have any thought, I appreciate it. Thank you so much for <br/>
listening.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like he doesn&#39;t necessarily want to do a curriculum (or he&#39;d be<br/>
doing the workbooks) so much as he&#39;s afraid that what he&#39;s doing won&#39;t let<br/>
him get to college.<br/>
<br/>
I think handing him a curriculum is going to feel like you&#39;re saying that<br/>
you&#39;re washing your hands of the responsibility of preparing him and placing<br/>
it all on his shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
One bad side effect of sending kids to school or doing school at home is<br/>
that kids can become as convinced that school is the only way to learn as<br/>
thoroughly as adults. Plus the fact that up until recently you were saying<br/>
&quot;Trust me, you have to do this or you won&#39;t succeed in life,&quot; but now you&#39;re<br/>
saying &quot;Oops, I was wrong. But trust me, now I know you don&#39;t have to do<br/>
that to succeed.&quot; It would be natural for him to worry that you&#39;d discover<br/>
you were wrong again and he did need to do the work.<br/>
<br/>
I think what would help most is if he met other unschoolers so he could see<br/>
that following interests works and to counter the messages he&#39;s getting<br/>
elsewhere. Have you advertised an unschoolers get together? Try the library,<br/>
natural food stores, coops and so on. Lots of people have said that when<br/>
they put out the call for unschoolers that unschoolers came out of the<br/>
woodwork. :-) Even -- or maybe especially -- in heavily Christian areas<br/>
where Bob Jones rules. Unschoolers tend to feel like they&#39;re alone so they<br/>
go out of their way to meet other unschoolers when they find others are<br/>
actually out there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would help if he&#39;d write out all his concerns and post them here so<br/>
people could sort of remotely show them their unschooled children and what,<br/>
especially the older ones, are doing without curriculum. And he&#39;d hear other<br/>
adults saying what you&#39;re saying about not needing school work and it might<br/>
sound more credible to him.<br/>
<br/>
Would he let you read him the Teenage Liberation Handbook?<br/>
<br/>
Then I&#39;d make sure he has easy access to exploring his interests. And fun<br/>
educational stuff like computer programs and online games and things you&#39;ll<br/>
do with him, which might be an easier step than going from schoolwork to<br/>
doing &quot;whatever&quot;. And then be available to help him set up a schedule but<br/>
not enforce it -- like you&#39;re doing now -- to do school work if he wants. If<br/>
he feels like you&#39;re a road block in what he wants, even if it&#39;s schoolwork,<br/>
it will make it harder for him to let go of it since it will feel like<br/>
you&#39;re making the decision for him to make him let it go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355676731">** My 11 year old keeps asking me to give him a curriculum. He wants to<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Angela -<br/>
<br/>
(I like what Joyce posted a lot more than what I wrote, but maybe part <br/>
of my post is still useful.)<br/>
<br/>
OK.  If he believes he wants curriculum and is asking for it, I&#39;m not <br/>
going to try very hard to stop you.<br/>
<br/>
One thought -- get something used, don&#39;t blow a pile of cash on <br/>
something of dubious value that he&#39;s likely to tire of.  Get it cheap <br/>
enough so that some day you can happily toss it out.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m in CA and at the Sacramento bookroom, I can get recycled public <br/>
school textbooks for generally less than $10.  And I can get college <br/>
level textbooks at my local library sale for $1 each.  I bought a World <br/>
History text on Saturday for that price.  But I&#39;m not sure why I wanted <br/>
it.  Maybe I&#39;m storing up textbooks and nuts for the winter. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Second thought -- involve him in the selection process.  Have him look <br/>
through some of the curricular materials that your homeschooling friends <br/>
have.  I also like The Complete Homelearning Source Book, which reviews <br/>
lots of &quot;learning materials&quot;, not just curriculum in a box.  I&#39;ve also <br/>
lived in cities where the public libraries had math textbooks on the <br/>
shelves.  He can &quot;audition&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
Third thought -- debrief him on your prior school at home experiences.  <br/>
What parts of it did he think were &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot;.  He&#39;s either <br/>
going to revisit some of the unhappy feelinsg now, or when he repeats <br/>
those experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Final thought -- he mentioned GED prep.  Can you get a GED prep book <br/>
from the library and look at that first? <br/>
<br/>
Post-final thought -- just this week someone on one of these lists <br/>
posted a link to an Alfie Kohn article on what it means to be educated.  <br/>
You could make that article into a lesson on philosophy and critical <br/>
thinking for you son. &lt;g&gt;  (If he&#39;s ready for it.)  It&#39;s fairly <br/>
thought-provoking stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I have some empathy for you son, because when I was trying to learn more <br/>
about computer programming in my 30s, I would only make progress when I <br/>
was signed up for a class.  Somehow I needed that &quot;push&quot; of having a due <br/>
date for assigned homework.  I think the reason I needed that was that I <br/>
wasn&#39;t really sincerely interested in programming, just thought I <br/>
&quot;should&quot; learn about it and that it would be &quot;good for me&quot; to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS     OK, this is an evil idea and you can take it or leave it, but an <br/>
imp on my shoulder said &quot;Make him pay for it.&quot;   In theory he would.... <br/>
um... appreciate it more.</div>

If one person did give you an unqualified endorsement, would that prove it <br/>
would work for you and your family?<br/>
<br/>
If you heard one unqualified endorsement that the public schools were really <br/>
the best way to go, would you send your kids there?<br/>
<br/>
What if you had a dozen such endorsements?<br/>
<br/>
What if you find one formerly schooled person (are there any?  Who went to <br/>
public school for twelve or thirteen years?) who said public school was <br/>
horrible?  Would that turn you off to public school all by itself?<br/>
<br/>
What if you find one formerly unschooled person who says &quot;It was terrible&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
(Just questions to keep in mind as you move along toward finding  &quot;adult <br/>
results.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Angela, I&#39;m late on this thread, but I have a son like this. He&#39;s almost thirteen and we <br/>
started unschooling when he was 11. I got great advice at the time.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, some kids measure themselves against others. My son was worried that if he <br/>
couldn&#39;t quantify his progress in a subject, then he wasn&#39;t learning. As a result, I told him <br/>
if he wanted to floow his original curricula, he could. So I would pull it out in the mornings <br/>
(several different books) and put it on the table. But I told him that I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
&quot;enforce&quot; his doing it.<br/>
<br/>
This riled him up some. He thought he &quot;should&quot; be pushed to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of a year, he did less and less of the curricula. He became more and more <br/>
engaged in his own interests. Still, occasionally he would go to bed at night anxious that <br/>
he wasn&#39;t getting an education.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of last year, I wrote up a narrative of all he had learned for the state. I read it to <br/>
him so that he could verify ot modify it. By the end, he was grinning ear to ear. He said, <br/>
&quot;Wow, I really am learning a lot! Could you do this for me each month so that I can have <br/>
evidence that I really am learning?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was the heart of his concern.<br/>
<br/>
And this year, he has chosen to use a math curricula even though I&#39;m convinced he doesn&#39;t <br/>
need it (after not liking the one he used last year... he decided that for math, he enjoys <br/>
following a program but wanted to try something new. We looked at programs together <br/>
and bought MathUSee because it appealed to him. He loves it and I say nothing one way or <br/>
the other.)<br/>

over fifty books and I assure you, she wouldn&#39;t write a book on how well we turned out, <br/>
ask us to write the introduction and then ignore the complaints we have about how we <br/>
were raised.<br/>
<br/>
If a mother writes a book like this, on what grounds could she write it if the child in <br/>
question opposed it?<br/>
<br/>
I read her website too and what I loved about it is that she wasn&#39;t endorsing unschooling, <br/>
she was affirming openly the person she&#39;s become. Isn&#39;t that the point of unschooling? To <br/>
become a someone - not to promote an ideology.<br/>
<br/>
And the word &quot;unqualified&quot; is also a red herring. What choice have you ever made that is <br/>
&quot;unqualified&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
When asking for the comments of adults who&#39;ve been unschooled, I&#39;d think you&#39;d want to <br/>
hear their honest remarks including qualifications so that you have a realistic picture. <br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t for everyone. But for those who have chosen it and enjoy it, there is an <br/>
abundance of stories that reveal satisfied, happy family lives. No promises of straight As in <br/>
college or even college. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a way of life and a philosophy of learning. You have to see if you share the <br/>
philsophy or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825303047">Thank you so much Julie. It helps to hear from someone who has gone <br/>
through it, also. I think my son is getting it. I did end up doing <br/>
just what you said, I pulled together some of his old curriculum, <br/>
and some of the stuff he picked out himself when we were at book <br/>
stores, and he worked on it a couple of days, but has ended up doing <br/>
what he usually does, writing books and making movies. I am hoping <br/>
this was just a passing thing, but whatever, I am always here for <br/>
him. One thing I am trying to do is get him involved with other <br/>
unschoolers more, that way he is seeing other kids like him. Well, <br/>

Nobody here will make a commission if you do, so it&#39;s not our &quot;job&quot; to sell <br/>
you something.   What people do here pretty well is share details of their own <br/>
lives for the benefit of others who are considering unschooling.   We don&#39;t do <br/>
custom work, in the way of doing someone else&#39;s research for them or <br/>
defending people who aren&#39;t even here, or speculating on the veracity of <br/>
recommendations made on websites.   <br/>
<br/>
All that business (including reflections on what is read here) is internal to <br/>
the reader.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t believe the moments of unschooling shouldn&#39;t <br/>
(and probably can&#39;t anyway) mess with it at all.   Those who live the glorious <br/>
moments seem often to find themselves much less concerned with the <br/>
hypothetical eventualities.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who waits for a guarantee of 15 years out from now isn&#39;t being <br/>
realistic, AND will miss all opportunity to unschool from hesitation while a child is <br/>
growing older every day.<br/>

-=-So I was trying to encourage people to show me real <br/>

<br/>
This just really grates on my emotions.<br/>
You can certainly look for what you want to find, but the many layers of <br/>
antagonism of this sort of statement is hard to bear.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t write about unschooling one single bit.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s <br/>
because they were never in school and have been home all their lives, so <br/>
unschooling is not a big deal to them, it&#39;s not a part of their lives they&#39;ve <br/>
analyzed and discussed.  It just IS their lives.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-I KNOW unschooling parents are enthusiastic, but so are every other kind <br/>
of homeschooling parent and quite a few parents of kids in schools. <br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s nice to hear from the lab rat and not just the <br/>

<br/>
#1 my children are not lab rats.<br/>
They are real, whole, un-labbed people.<br/>
<br/>
#2, if you think every other kind of homeschooling parent is as enthusiastic <br/>
as unschoolers, maybe that&#39;s where your research ought to start.  There is a <br/>
HUGE undercurrent of burn-out and resentment throughout the Christian <br/>
homeschooling movement.  They pray about it a lot.   They try to keep it secret.  There <br/>
are VERY many curriculum-using families who are doing irreparable damage to <br/>
the relationships between parents and children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Come to think of it, if anybody knows where to read a well thought out <br/>
critique of what worked and didn&#39;t work in somebody&#39;s unschooled <br/>

<br/>
Heaven forbit someone find you something you claim to want, just for you to <br/>
declare it &quot;not well thought out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re rejecting more than you&#39;re accepting, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you go to google and look up some negative words and homeschooling <br/>
or unschooling you&#39;ll find the seamy underbelly (or whatever) you&#39;re looking <br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
What I see when I meet unschooled kids is a heck of a lot of joy and sparkle.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t been to an unschooling conference, maybe you should go and <br/>
meet some unschoolers in person.  Especially with your simple assertion that <br/>
every kind of homeschooling parent is enthusiastic, I suspect you are writing <br/>
about something pretty foreign and theoretical to you.  That&#39;s not necessary, as <br/>
there are live unschoolers in the world.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking just this morning about how some people turn on the TV and <br/>
wait for the news to see if it&#39;s going to rain, instead of looking outside at the <br/>
sky and the clouds.   <br/>

not many grown unschoolers out there. And, of those, how many are going <br/>
to be writers. And, of those, how many are going to want to write <br/>
specifically about unschooling? They LIVED it - they don&#39;t think of it <br/>
the way we do - as something - as &quot;something.&quot; For most of them, it was <br/>
just their lives. They are each unique. They don&#39;t necessarily see <br/>
themselves as having anything much in common, even, with other <br/>
unschooled young adults. Their interests and passions are their lives <br/>
and unschooling isn&#39;t their interest or their passion.<br/>

talking about how unschooling is so great. My guess is that they are <br/>
probably out in the world living their lives. <br/>
<br/>
I get the impression that you think most unschooling parents are <br/>
really enthusiastic about the &quot;philosophy&quot; of unschooling, and we <br/>
thrust it upon our children, without regard for what they want or how <br/>
they may turn out. What you will probably find, however, is that the <br/>
vast majority of parents here have kids who really WANT to be <br/>
unschooled. My son begged me to take him out of school. He often says <br/>
to me &quot;I love my life!&quot; He wouldnt change a thing about how he is <br/>
&quot;educated&quot; or how we live. He is proud to be an unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
I dont unschool my child because another unschooler has grown up <br/>
somewhere and decided they liked their unschooled life. I unschool my <br/>
child because it brings him joy, and we are both happier for it. I <br/>
unschool my child because he wants me to. I unschool my child because <br/>
i believe it is his best shot at growing up happy, healthy, whole <br/>
(and yes &quot;well educated&quot;)...i am not sure what you are looking for? <br/>
Instead of looking for validation from others, look at your child. If <br/>
unschooling would make them happy, and you are happy to do it, go for <br/>
it. If not, then dont. <br/>

&gt; growing older every day.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People keep saying &quot;no guarantee&quot; to me when I haven&#39;t asked for a <br/>
guarantee.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;-=-So I was trying to encourage people to show me real<br/>
&gt; enthusiasm if it was out there. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This just really grates on my emotions.<br/>
&gt; You can certainly look for what you want to find, but the many layers <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; antagonism of this sort of statement is hard to bear.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, Sandra, I didn&#39;t mean to make your day harder. I thought when I <br/>
started this topic that maybe I ought to first run up the white flag <br/>
and say &quot;This is Not, Repeat, Not, an Attack. Nobody needs to get out <br/>
the long guns and run me off.&quot; Then I thought, nah, that&#39;s just being <br/>
paranoid and starting the conversation in an antagonistic way. But <br/>
maybe I should have after all.<br/>
<br/>
I assure you, I&#39;m not antagonistic. I&#39;m curious, open and want to <br/>
gather all the information I can and think about it carefully (in fact, <br/>
critically, if that&#39;s not too war-like a word). I&#39;m sorry if my <br/>
language doesn&#39;t successfully convey my attitude. Perhaps it would help <br/>
to imagine that I was your best friend speaking in a gentle, <br/>
well-meaning tone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also aware that the relevant information is not degrees or grade <br/>
point averages, but people&#39;s happiness and level of satisfaction with <br/>
their lives.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;My kids don&#39;t write about unschooling one single bit.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>
&gt; sure it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; because they were never in school and have been home all their lives, <br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; unschooling is not a big deal to them, it&#39;s not a part of their lives <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; analyzed and discussed.  It just IS their lives.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why it would be interesting to hear from people who have been <br/>
grown up long enough to think about it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;-=-I KNOW unschooling parents are enthusiastic, but so are every <br/>
&gt; other kind<br/>
&gt; of homeschooling parent and quite a few parents of kids in schools.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s nice to hear from the lab rat and not just the<br/>
&gt; scientist.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; #1 my children are not lab rats.<br/>
&gt; They are real, whole, un-labbed people.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to dehumanize your children or mine or anyone <br/>
else&#39;s.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;#2, if you think every other kind of homeschooling parent is as <br/>
&gt; enthusiastic<br/>
&gt; as unschoolers, maybe that&#39;s where your research ought to start.  <br/>
&gt; There is a<br/>
&gt; HUGE undercurrent of burn-out and resentment throughout the Christian<br/>
&gt; homeschooling movement.  They pray about it a lot.   They try to keep <br/>
&gt; it secret.  There<br/>
&gt; are VERY many curriculum-using families who are doing irreparable <br/>
&gt; damage to<br/>
&gt; the relationships between parents and children.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now that IS interesting, and I didn&#39;t know it. But since I was never in <br/>
any possible universe going to be a Christian Homeschooler, I will skip <br/>
that branch of research.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;-=-Come to think of it, if anybody knows where to read a well <br/>
&gt; thought out<br/>
&gt; critique of what worked and didn&#39;t work in somebody&#39;s unschooled<br/>
&gt; childhood that would be really interesting to see too.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heaven forbit someone find you something you claim to want, just for <br/>
&gt; you to<br/>
&gt; declare it &quot;not well thought out.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re rejecting more than you&#39;re accepting, it seems.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By &quot;well thought out,&quot; I mean that the person meant to sit down and <br/>
think for a while about unschooling in particular and wasn&#39;t just <br/>
randomly reminiscing. I didn&#39;t realize they were fighting words.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe if you go to google and look up some negative words and <br/>
&gt; homeschooling<br/>
&gt; or unschooling you&#39;ll find the seamy underbelly (or whatever) you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; looking<br/>
&gt; for.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now, why is it that you suppose that I&#39;m looking for a &quot;seamy <br/>
underbelly&quot; when all I&#39;ve asked for is positive reports?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;If you haven&#39;t been to an unschooling conference, maybe you should <br/>
&gt; go and<br/>
&gt; meet some unschoolers in person.  Especially with your simple <br/>
&gt; assertion that<br/>
&gt; every kind of homeschooling parent is enthusiastic, I suspect you are <br/>
&gt; writing<br/>
&gt; about something pretty foreign and theoretical to you.  That&#39;s not <br/>
&gt; necessary, as<br/>
&gt; there are live unschoolers in the world.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps I should have said &quot;every kind of homeschooling parent who <br/>
communicates in print.&quot; I&#39;ve been to a couple of workshops - in fact I <br/>
met you at the one in Chicago- and to the Wisconsin Homeschooling <br/>
Conference. And I read a lot of books, which<br/>
ARE more abstract than real life, but one gets information where one <br/>
can. I&#39;m certainly grateful to people who are willing to share first <br/>
hand experiences - the more the better.<br/>
<br/>
I could enthuse about perfect moments my children and I have had or <br/>
really interesting things they said, and maybe I will someday. I could <br/>
post my own thoughts on unschooling, and maybe someday I&#39;ll do that, <br/>
but just at the moment I&#39;m trying to satisfy my curiosity and expand my <br/>
data base as much as I can.<br/>

&gt; not many grown unschoolers out there. And, of those, how many are going<br/>

&gt; specifically about unschooling? They LIVED it - they don&#39;t think of it<br/>
&gt; the way we do - as something - as &quot;something.&quot; For most of them, it was<br/>
&gt; just their lives. They are each unique. They don&#39;t necessarily see<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, not MUCH beyond that. I did say it was second and third hand <br/>
information and not at all substantial. I think it&#39;s easy for you to <br/>
dismiss that kind of stuff because you have a broad base of experience <br/>
with successful unschooling. I don&#39;t; I&#39;m trying to broaden it.<br/>
<br/>
I really am going to run up that white flag now: This is not and never <br/>
was an attack! I mentioned the &quot;ghost stories,&quot; because I figured you <br/>
all must have heard the same kind of thing from your friends and <br/>
neighbors and would see where I was coming from.<br/>
<br/>
Still, since you ask, here are the three closest to first hand that I <br/>
remember:<br/>
<br/>
Someone wrote into our local homeschooling list asking for information <br/>
on getting a young relative she was taking in &quot;caught up&quot; because<br/>
his mother &quot;wasn&#39;t really homeschooling him like she said she was.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A woman I met at a dance who had seven unschooled children described <br/>
one who was apparently very angry with his upbringing and had therefore <br/>
gone off to join the army, where he had terrible experiences. The <br/>
others were apparently fine, but the conversation never got far enough <br/>
for me to hear much about them.<br/>
<br/>
On a list I belonged to earlier this summer, a young person wrote in <br/>
describing her dissatisfaction with her unschooled childhood and her <br/>
great relief at finally getting to spend her senior year in high <br/>
school. She seemed very disgruntled with her parents, could not believe <br/>
they thought  she could make educational decisions for herself and used <br/>
the phrase &quot;an endless search for structure&quot; to describe her childhood. <br/>
There was some speculation on the list that the post was phony and the <br/>
person never wrote back.<br/>
<br/>
And, O yes, while it&#39;s not in the ruined life category, a friend from <br/>
church, whose children are now in Montessori School has said several <br/>
times: &quot;Don&#39;t do it the way I did, they never even learned their times <br/>
tables.&quot;<br/>

Critical thinking is great.  But the idea that not finding an unqualified <br/>

unschooling wasn&#39;t optimal didn&#39;t seem to be valid.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any analysis of unschooling itself written by adult <br/>
unschoolers.  Just random reminiscing.  Even the video Peter Kowalke made called &quot;Grown <br/>
Without Schooling&quot; is random reminisces.<br/>
<br/>
I think all autobiographies are random (or sometimes more organized) <br/>
reminisces.  That isn&#39;t usually considered a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;ve been to a couple of workshops - in fact I <br/>

<br/>
No older unschoolers were there, though.  Only nursing babies.<br/>
<br/>
Even when there&#39;s a teen or young adult panel at a conference, though, the <br/>
people who speak were interested in a conference, and willing to spend hours to <br/>
days hanging out with other unschoolers.  I haven&#39;t heard many negatives in <br/>
such situations.  I guess the kids who hate unschooling don&#39;t go to conferences.<br/>
