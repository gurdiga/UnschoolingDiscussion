<div id="ygrps-yiv-840289200">Hello to everyone out there. I was so happy to find your group and know <br/>
I wasn&#39;t alone. I am a mother of four, ages 10,7,3, and 11 weeks. My <br/>
children have never attended school. We have always followed a pretty <br/>
traditional approach to schooling and have just recently tried to embrace <br/>
the philosophy of unschooling. I was so excited when I began reading about <br/>
unschooling. Traditional homeschooling was not working. I didn&#39;t know what <br/>
else to do. It seemed to be bringing more tears and frustration than <br/>
anything else. Unschooling has given me hope and inspiration that we can <br/>
continue.<br/>
     I have several questions that I am sure you have answered before and I <br/>
appreciate your patience. What about reading? My 7 year old is not reading <br/>
and trying to teach him is like pulling hair. I have backed off and am <br/>
trying to understand that he will read in his own time and his own way. But <br/>
I am so nervous. How is he going to learn if he doesn&#39;t know how to read? <br/>
Can anyone give me advice or comfort? I guess I am just having trouble <br/>
backing off. I understand the philosophy but am having trouble implementing <br/>
it. Is it really good to let my 10 year old lie around 24 hours a day, <br/>
reading Harry Potter over and over again?<br/>
      Does anyone out there have a son or daughter who would like to <br/>
communicate with my ten year old son? He needs to feel that there other <br/>
people out there like him too. We live in a very small community and don&#39;t <br/>
know anyone with even similar philosophies as us.<br/>
      Thanks to everyone. It means so much.<br/>
<br/>
                         Sincerely,<br/>
                           Robyn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756989159">Hi Robyn!<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on the new baby!!!  Who wouldn&#39;t be &quot;needy&quot; with all<br/>
that you have on your plate right now?  I&#39;d like to offer some support<br/>
if I may.  Have absolutely NO FEAR about your 7 year old not reading. <br/>
My 8 year old is only just beginning the basics and I have at least 3<br/>
other homeschooler friends with kids who are taking their sweet time at<br/>
the reading trick too (one boy is 10 and can barely read a word but he<br/>
is nonetheless an alert, aware, interested-in-learning child and is<br/>
doing well).  It will come, I can assure you!  I just read something<br/>
recently about the ideal age for reading being 11 years!  So you&#39;ve got<br/>
a way to go...I&#39;d think one of the best possible homeschooling<br/>
experiences for a family would be what you&#39;ve just been through and will<br/>
continue with over the next year or so.  What a phenomenal opportunity<br/>
for your children to have shared in your pregnancy, the fetal<br/>
development and now study of the newly arrived infant!  When my then 9<br/>
and 6 year old children immersed themselves in my last pregnancy, (my<br/>
baby turns 2 tomorrow...) the euphoria lasted to this day.  We got every<br/>
book and video the library had on pregnancy, fetal development and<br/>
birth.  My children have become completely engrossed and amazed with the<br/>
growth and moulding of a fellow human being.  What they would&#39;ve missed<br/>
had they been away all of every day at a public school is enough to<br/>
depress anyone.  What an amazing opportunity your family has right now! <br/>
And if your 10 year old would rather read Harry Potter all day I&#39;m sure<br/>
the day will come when inevitably he will grow tired of it and be ready<br/>
for something new.  &quot;Don&#39;t sweat the small stuff&quot; and just enjoy the<br/>
rare and precious moments with the newborn and the unification of your 4<br/>
children into a new family dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
If your ten year old is looking for penpals, I&#39;m sure my now 11 year old<br/>
son would be most pleased to reciprocate!<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations again and my very best wishes,<br/>
<br/>
Sonia in Saskatoon<br/>

You need to read &quot;Better Late Than Early&quot; by the Moore&#39;s.  Some children,<br/>
especially boys, aren&#39;t ready to read until around 10.</div>

program the VCR? or know when their favoriate TV show comes on?<br/>
<br/>
Your 7 year old will read on his own timetable, but only if you don&#39;t pull<br/>
all of his hair out. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Were you and the 10 year old fighting over schooling before?  Does it make a<br/>
difference what a child is reading, as long as they are reading and<br/>
thinking?  And are you sure that&#39;s all that&#39;s being done? No food is being<br/>
eaten, no trips to the bathroom, no fighting between siblings?<br/>
<br/>
One of the best ways to help the nervousness is to write down eveyrthing the<br/>
kids do during the day. Everything.   Then after a week or so, take a look<br/>
at what has been done. This might not be the thing to do during intense<br/>
deschooling, where everyone is getting their bearings back, but for a little<br/>
later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll ask my 10 year old. He&#39;s reading fluently now, but still not writing<br/>
much as he does not spell yet.... he might love the chance to talk to<br/>
another 10 year old.  :)<br/>

<br/>
This is SO true.<br/>
I still do it, on days when I feel I&#39;ve let too much slip. Last week, on a<br/>
day that felt as though pieces were missing, I wrote down what the girls had<br/>
worked on. Puzzles. I calculated that they spent roughly 4 hours that day<br/>
just doing puzzles.<br/>
This was a big deal for me, because I have bought and left puzzles around<br/>
for years, and no one has been interested in them ... ever. Then there was<br/>
the day that my 8yo disapeared upstairs while I was reading with the 4yo,<br/>
and didn&#39;t come down until much later. She had been playing Chessmaster on<br/>
the Nintendo...a game that I bought and that had laid there for months<br/>
without any interest whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Those &quot;Oh No, What did we DO today?!&quot; days, are sometimes the best.<br/>
