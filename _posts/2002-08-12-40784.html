Quotations or Brewer&#39;s Dictionary of Phrase & Fable. Google just brought up <br/>
stories that contained the phrase. A least the way I searched it. &lt;sorry&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-899366904">Yeah, I couldn&#39;t find it online either.  Thanks for trying, though.  My friend who knows everything think it&#39;s a Monty Python quote, but that doesn&#39;t seem quite right. Anybody else have an opinion?  (And this is unschooling because it&#39;s about practical applications of literature -- how our modern language is shaped by allusion to popular cultural works.)  Debi<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041173288">I found a song on an old record album by a group called &quot;Headstone&quot; (the album is apparently their one and only, also called &quot;Headstone&quot;) titled &quot; Large Weather We&#39;re Having, Lucy&quot;. It&#39;s $1.99 here, plus shipping: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cozzen.freeyellow.com/CROCK.html">http://cozzen.freeyellow.com/CROCK.html</a><br/>

It might almost be worth it, to get a lead on the mystery!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683497835">Thanks, Dar!  The kids are really intrigued, too -- they&#39;re used to my being able to identify obscure references, and they love that I&#39;m having to wrestle with this one.  It&#39;s good for them to see ME pursuing something with passion (they&#39;re in the tail end stages of de-school-at-homing). I&#39;ll get the album and see if that sheds any light.  Debi<br/>
