<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Annette, I agreed with your post....I hear alot 
about people being , well let&#39;s just say, not so friendly to people who have not 
made the decisions that they have, and it goes both ways.....it&#39;s so hard in 
this world, as it is , to be &amp; do what you feel is best for your own family, 
but adding the extra element of judgement, or biased, just isn&#39;t fair in my 
opinion. Now, if I expect people to respect, and leave my family to do things 
our own way, which I do......I would expect the same from myself, towards 
others.&nbsp; All of us are unique &amp; diverse , and I consider this a 
strength...not all people are best suited to be SAHM&#39;s, but they are wonderful 
Mothers.&nbsp; ANd some people , like my aunt, who didn&#39;t want to be a Mother, 
and wasn&#39;t....was a wonderful teacher of 2nd graders for 40 some years, and I 
knew how wonderful she was as a teacher, having stayed summers with her when I 
was young.......some do this , some do that......if we can all see that there 
are ways of doing things that are not the same, but just as good for others, as 
our ways are for us....we may have a better chance of learning from, and living 
with all types of people with all kinds of ways of doing things.&nbsp; I do 
think that when we get stuck in the mindset that their is only one right way of 
doing something, then we close the door of learning.&nbsp; Just my 10 cents.
