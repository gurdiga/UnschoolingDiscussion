 </span></blockquote>We aren&#39;t yet, and this is the first I&#39;ve heard of this game, and my <br/>
oldest is only 6...but *I* want to play it, now! I think she&#39;ll love <br/>
it! Thanks for the link!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and that other game link that Sandra posted, on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gprime.net/game/">http://gprime.net/game/</a> , we ended up playing one game after another <br/>
all through the week of Thanksgiving with my dad. They just got high-<br/>
speed internet, and so we had a blast trying all the new games out. <br/>
Many of them were easy enough for my 6 year old, and my 4 year old did <br/>
pretty well, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137428379">The thing I love about puzzle games is that they can sometimes be  <br/>
played while doing other things, like waiting ten minutes for cookies  <br/>
to be ready (I keep the timer with me), or laundry, or watching a  <br/>
movie I&#39;ve already seen and am only  needing to fully attend to the  <br/>
best parts.<br/>
<br/>
I think the patterns and colors appeal to the same parts of people  <br/>
that used to be satisfied by embroidery or beadwork, through  <br/>
history.  Crochet maybe (minus the colors, generally).  Woodcarving.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like putting color into the patterns of my crochet, but then, I&#39;m all<br/>
about the colors, so naturally my crocheting must have color!<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I&#39;m working on a crochet project that has random color and<br/>
that&#39;s kind of interesting to me, since it&#39;s not something that I can<br/>
control at all, and I have to be ok with the outcome of random within a<br/>
controlled pattern of my making.<br/>
<br/>
As a kid, I never would&#39;ve been able to let that go.  I simply wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have done a project involving random color within a pattern.  As an<br/>
adult, I&#39;ve come to appreciate the perfect beauty in imperfection.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at Chamille&#39;s myspace page yesterday and she had some new<br/>
stuff on it.  At the top of the page it says &quot;F*** trying to be perfect,<br/>
I want to be flawed.  I quite enjoy crazyness!&quot;  Intentionally<br/>
misspelled, which adds to the saying!<br/>
<br/>
I love that in her craft and art, Chamille has always done intentional<br/>
randomosity!  Margaux is a pattern maker just like her mom!<br/>

My son also found some games where you are trapped in a room, or house, <br/>
or phone booth and you have to find clues to get out.  They are fun <br/>
games too.<br/>

I haven&#39;t tried this one, yet, but I did Weffriddles over a year ago, <br/>
and enjoyed them very much.<br/>
<br/>
I found a few of those &quot;trapped in ...&quot; games on the gprime.net, but <br/>
haven&#39;t looked for anymore, yet.<br/>
<br/>
I love riddle games, though I admit I have to cheat every now and then <br/>
because I&#39;m just not patient enough. Though I will say that a couple <br/>
of the Weff ones depended on &quot;common&quot; knowledge that was based on <br/>
modern media (pop singers and such) and I don&#39;t retain that sort of <br/>
knowledge very well at all! I&#39;m not a great partner for Trivial <br/>
Pursuit because of that - though Jim is pretty much the opposite so <br/>
we&#39;ve made a good team before. <br/>
<br/>
I often joke that I totally missed my growing-up years as I don&#39;t know <br/>
most of the bands, TV shows, etc. But even the ones I watch and listen <br/>
to *now* don&#39;t stick very well in my head. Names, dates and faces are <br/>
definitely NOT my intelligence area!<br/>
