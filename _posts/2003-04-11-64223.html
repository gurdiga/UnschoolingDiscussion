She is mad that the pants she wanted at walmart in the fall didn&#39;t hold up, <br/>

unique. I LOVE the thriftstore. <br/>

Add me to that boat. Like i always say, even if we get things that aren&#39;t new with tags, by the time my kids have worn something new once, you couldn&#39;t tell the difference. It&#39;s new to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394718060">Yard sales are even cheaper.  My daughter recently went up in size, <br/>
and was showing me everything at Wal-mart that she wanted.  I told <br/>
her that soon it will be yard sale season and that a whole bunch of <br/>
teenagers who think that they need to have brand new wardrobes every <br/>
year will get rid of last years stuff for practically nothing.  Then <br/>
she&#39;ll be able to get 5x the amount of stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
We do thrift stores too of course, but we can&#39;t wait until yard sale <br/>
season! <br/>
