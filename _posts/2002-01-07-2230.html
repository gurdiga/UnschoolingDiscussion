Hi, I&#39;m a Julie too.. do you really have goats???  I raise Nubians.. and<br/>
just love them..they are my babies! The kids should start happening in mid<br/>
April..we are so looking forward to the fresh milk and yogurt again!<br/>
Julie in MO<br/>
(no porch here either, but do have a goat barn too and a wonderful shady<br/>
yard with huge Maple trees next to the herb garden.. if anyone is stopping<br/>
by Missouri.. of course it&#39;s pretty chilly here right now.. so would be<br/>
better to gather around the fireplace!)</div>
