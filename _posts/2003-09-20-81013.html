##################################<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I am sure others have posted on this already, but I&#39;m just getting <br/>
going this morning and so I took this challenge up myself! &lt;g&gt; I spent well over <br/>
an hour reading through countless predestination sites from Google. I&#39;ve known <br/>
about predestination for quite some time so I didn&#39;t find much new to me on <br/>
any of the sites. The one thing that has been new to me recently is that a form <br/>
of predestination that says; rapists, murderers, child molesters, all the way <br/>
down to bad parents, kids who stomp bugs, and eat their boogers, and throw <br/>
temper tantrums in the middle of the store, all chose that particular *thing* <br/>
before birth. I&#39;ve heard of the Mormon belief that we all chose our birth parents <br/>
and we are all destined to live again with God and become gods and goddesses <br/>
in our own right after we die. (that is if we do all the right things on <br/>
earth) I have heard of many many ideas revolving around predestination. Some even <br/>
sound valid to me, although *I* don&#39;t believe them, I do recognize that the <br/>
beliefs are true and valid to others. <br/>
<br/>
What I didn&#39;t find was the idea or form of predestination presented here on <br/>
this list by Judie and seconded by Rhonda. Not to say it doesn&#39;t exist or isn&#39;t <br/>
true to them, but I myself, did not find it on Google. BUT that is certainly <br/>
not to say Google is the definitive place for answers about obscure religions <br/>
and belief systems. So, I called my pastor, who is currently going through <br/>
more school to further his degree and since he is close to the source of <br/>
information and knowledge right now, I thought maybe he could give me an answer. No <br/>
such luck. (He recommended Google &lt;g&gt;) So I am now stuck. Google didn&#39;t do it <br/>
for me and neither did my pastor, I&#39;m sure there are other places and people I <br/>
could go to for information, but really all the people here wanted to know was <br/>
where THIS form or idea of predestination comes from. If it comes from just <br/>
you or just Judie, then just say so. <br/>
<br/>
As for is this unschooling or not, I think it is, I never stop learning. Many <br/>
discussions here spark my interest and I learn more and more everyday. I&#39;ve <br/>
changed political beliefs, educational beliefs, parenting ideals, food beliefs, <br/>
(is there such a thing?) beliefs about TV and video games.... The list is <br/>
long and wide! My MIL always wonders what exactly it is that the kids are <br/>
learning, and I&#39;m always tempted to say not much, but I sure am learning a lot! So if <br/>
you could please tell me where this one particular idea of predestination <br/>
comes from then there is one more thing I will have learned!<br/>

I think he talks about predestination and difficult times. It&#39;s been a <br/>
while since I read this, but you might give this a try. Sylvia Browne <br/>
was already mentioned - she&#39;s a kind of love her or hate her kind of <br/>
thing. (not offering an opinion here, just info).<br/>
<br/>
Another book is &quot;Karma and Reincarnation&quot; by Elizabeth Claire Prophet. <br/>
It&#39;s a little purple book, found in the new age section. Info on <br/>
reincarnation can be found in Buddhist, Hindu, new age, Wiccan, pagan, <br/>
Gnostic Christian writings. It varies some, but has a lot of <br/>
similarities too.<br/>
<br/>
Most of what I&#39;ve read doesn&#39;t talk about &quot;predestination&quot; as much as <br/>
life lessons and karmic debts, which is similar but does have some <br/>
similarites. I think the key difference is that in karmic debts/life <br/>
lessons, we are presented with a choice (this is pre-determined) but it <br/>
is up to us what we choose. In predestination, how we choose is also <br/>
predetermined, rather than simply the situation. And then of course, <br/>
once you choose, a whole different set of options, lessons, experiences, <br/>
open up based on which choice you made.<br/>

I didn&#39;t say I had never even heard of it.  I&#39;m repeating the entirety of a <br/>
post which seemed to me to be important.  It&#39;s my post, quoting the person who <br/>
said she didn&#39;t have to feel bad about what others were experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ver heard versions of that theory for years, but never this harsh, and <br/>
never used as an excuse to not even CARE how other people felt even in extreme <br/>
circumstances.  This started with her saying she didn&#39;t care whether others were <br/>
uncomfortable about nursing, but when questioned in more extreme instances, <br/>
the clarification was made the even extreme instances are no exception.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t say I had never heard of it.  I wanted to know what the source of its growth <br/>
and continuance was.  She either didn&#39;t know or didn&#39;t  want to say.  I&#39;m  <br/>
glad others had a better idea of the origins.<br/>

<br/>
With a screenname like &quot;Adonai,&quot; with a history of using ABeka and having <br/>
kids in Christian schools, how did you come so hard and fast to beliefs so <br/>
bizarrely different?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Therefore, whatever <br/>
reaction they have, they chose to have that reaction long before we <br/>
actually had that experience together.  Whatever lesson they had to <br/>
learn from it, they chose it.  I don&#39;t have to feel bad about what <br/>
they are experiencing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS THE BIG ONE:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I don&#39;t have to feel bad about what <br/>
they are experiencing. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I really don&#39;t like the &quot;this was all decided&quot; theory (and where <br/>
it came from, I have NO idea, but it&#39;s recent and it&#39;s harmful).<br/>
<br/>
It justifies abuse.<br/>
If you abuse your own children, you don&#39;t have to feel bad about what they <br/>
are experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
If your neighbor comes to you in fright in the middle of the night because <br/>
her husband is after her with a knife or a gun, you can refuse to let her in <br/>
because she chose that life, and you don&#39;t have to feel bad about what she&#39;s <br/>
experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
Really, where does that belief/justification come from?<br/>
Who is promulgating it?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s part of what has to happen to them for <br/>
them to choose to make their part of the world better by changing <br/>
their attitudes.  If they don&#39;t, well, there&#39;s a lesson there too, <br/>
perhaps to be worked out in another lifetime.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

the way we live while we ARE here (as opposed to deals we allegedly make with <br/>
other dead people before we go back onstage) doesn&#39;t have any historical or <br/>
moral validity as far as I know or can imagine.<br/>

<br/>
I see where you are coming from. ( I was perplexed):-)<br/>
I had read that post, but didn&#39;t assume  the ideas that you did from <br/>
it.  While I think people can believe there is destiny (Gods will, <br/>
pre planned...whatever) I would never think to take the human element <br/>
out of it.  Feeling compassion for someone in pain is human.  Our <br/>
beliefs don&#39;t take that away.<br/>
We can believe it was suppose to happen but still feel sad, sorry, <br/>
compassion....<br/>
The &quot;I don&#39;t have to feel bad&quot; comment, was read by me as; &quot;this is <br/>
something they have to go through.  This was their plan.  While I&#39;m <br/>
sad for them as a human,  I don&#39;t feel bad for them because they are <br/>
fullfillng their plan.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I would ever assume someone with that belief system <br/>
would purposely be mean and say &quot;it was pre planned&quot;  I especially <br/>
wouldn&#39;t assume that of someone unschooling.<br/>
I have a whole side of my family into New Age and this type of <br/>
thinking.<br/>
My Aunt is a New Age minister.  She&#39;s really into Eurancha.<br/>
NONE of them would ever purposely cause harm.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine anyone into this type of soul searching trying to <br/>
figure out how to be mean and &quot;get away with it&quot;,  which is what <br/>
seems to be your fear.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that the original poster dropped the ball here.<br/>
If it&#39;s a firm belief, I feel you should stand up for it.<br/>
It&#39;s not a firm belief for me.  But, I don&#39;t dismiss what she said. <br/>
I think we read her differently, and I was just extremely curious why <br/>
you seemed to have a whole different view of what she and Rhonda were <br/>
saying.<br/>
Thankyou for clarifying.  ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Whether or not we can guess Judie is mean based on her beliefs isn&#39;t the<br/>
issue. The list isn&#39;t for discussing Judie. It&#39;s for discussing ideas.<br/>
<br/>
The ideas she brought to the list are a topic of discussion. Ideas,<br/>
principles, view points are like filters. They help us decide what are good<br/>
and bad ideas and solutions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a whole side of my family into New Age and this type of<br/>

&gt; figure out how to be mean and &quot;get away with it&quot;,  which is what<br/>
&gt; seems to be your fear.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The ideas of Christianity have helped some people make positive social<br/>
changes.<br/>
<br/>
The ideas of Christianity have also justified some horrors and incredible<br/>
abuses.<br/>
<br/>
Same with Islam.<br/>
<br/>
I would bet the same with Hinduism but I don&#39;t know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Those belief systems are the filters people used to decide what was right<br/>
behavior. Some people have filtered ideas through Christianity and founded<br/>
leper colonies and soup kitchens. Others have filtered ideas through<br/>
Christianity and started crusades and come up with charts of rod sizes based<br/>
on age to whip children with.<br/>
<br/>
If someone brings a bit of a belief system to the list that could justify<br/>
harming children, it&#39;s worth examining those ideas if those ideas have some<br/>
impact on people&#39;s ability to filter the solutions that will help them<br/>
create a peaceful joyful homeschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to seemingly go off on a tangent for a bit: Think about the most<br/>
difficult child problem you&#39;ve solved and think about how you went about<br/>
deciding what were good and bad solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Sibling rivalry comes up a lot. One filter that many people have is that<br/>
sibling rivalry is normal. Another is that it&#39;s mom&#39;s job to fix things.<br/>
Another is that it&#39;s a parent&#39;s job to control children&#39;s behavior until<br/>
they can control it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
That first filter, that it&#39;s normal, filters out any agressive techniques to<br/>
force children to change. It tends to relieve us of guilt we might feel that<br/>
it&#39;s our fault and that we should be doing something about it. It doesn&#39;t<br/>
stop us from interfering but it filters out ideas that are based on &quot;These<br/>
incidents are wrong and need to stop.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The second filter tends to filter out solutions that tell us to do nothing.<br/>
It increases the guilt we feel when we see them fighting. It&#39;s our job to<br/>
make them stop. It&#39;s a reflection on our abilities as parents that they&#39;re<br/>
even fighting to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
The third filter lets through solutions that have control at their<br/>
foundation.<br/>
<br/>
When looked at through those filters, all the solutions make some sense. It<br/>
does make sense to punish kids for fighting because it&#39;s our job to shape<br/>
them into decent humans. It does make sense to only step in when there&#39;s<br/>
blood because sibling rivalry is normal. If someone has all those filters<br/>
they have a head full of incompatible solutions and they don&#39;t know what&#39;s<br/>
right or best and they understandably feel confused.<br/>
<br/>
But none of those filters helps us make the decisions that help our chldren<br/>
live more joyful and peaceful lives. Neither does the belief system that<br/>
Judie brought up. None of those prevents us from joyful peaceful families.<br/>
Just as Christianity doesn&#39;t prevent people from mindful parenting. But it<br/>
doesn&#39;t help them make the distinction between the decisions that will<br/>
create that joyful atmosphere and the decisions that will prevent it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that Judie or anyone needs to change her beliefs to be on the list,<br/>
but that the ideas she expressed on the list -- and it was the ideas she<br/>
brought up *before* she explained her spiritual beliefs that prompted<br/>
someone (Sandra?) to ask for futher clarification since the reasoning behind<br/>
her words wasn&#39;t clear -- aren&#39;t helpful to people trying to get to unschool<br/>
and more peaceful families. The ideas don&#39;t help people filter out the<br/>
solutions that will help them get to more peaceful family life and the ideas<br/>
that will hinder them.<br/>
<br/>
This list is for discussion of ideas. We&#39;re not here to stop people from<br/>
holding ideas but we are here to hold up ideas brought to the list for<br/>
examination and talk about the ideas and why some ideas have helped poeple<br/>
reach unschooling goals and how some ideas have or could hinder them. No one<br/>
needs to stop believing in an idea just because they can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to<br/>
discuss how it helps people get to unschooling. They can hold it quietly.<br/>
But if the idea returns to the list, it will get held up for examination<br/>
again. Not as punishment for wrong thinking but because the purpose of this<br/>
list is for examining and discussing ideas that will help people get to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If someone can talk through their ideas and help others see how their ideas<br/>
are better at getting people from schoolish thought to unschooling thought<br/>
or to more peaceful families, then that&#39;s awesome! But if someone can&#39;t or<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to, if their ideas still look harmful, then the ideas *will* be<br/>
held up for examination every time they come up.<br/>
<br/>
One of the misconceptions of the discussions is that we&#39;re trying to tell<br/>
people they aren&#39;t allowed to believe the ideas that they do. That they have<br/>
to toe some group-think line. No. People can *believe* what they want. But<br/>
people can&#39;t *express* whatever they want *without it being discussed*. If<br/>
someone thinks an idea is harmful to someone getting unschooling or living<br/>
more peaceful lives with their children, that idea is going to be examined.<br/>
It&#39;s what this list is for.<br/>

Just to clarify, my post had nothing to do with Judie, but in <br/>
figuring out why I had a different reaction to her ideas than others.<br/>
I came to the conclusion that I wouldn&#39;t assume &quot;meaness&quot; behind any <br/>
of it.  It was a personal reflection of myself (not necessarily a <br/>

It was a shame we were left to have to assume.  <br/>

together, in a former lifetime to happen exactly like this. No need to <br/>
feel bad about it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really belief the above, but I&#39;m still a bit fascinated by the <br/>
ideas. I can&#39;t get a grasp of why bother to really even &quot;think&quot; about <br/>
decisions - whichever decision made would be one that, after the fact, <br/>
I&#39;d say, &quot;That was the decision we decided on before this lifetime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t get a hold of what basis there is to trying to make better <br/>
decisions. You can&#39;t make a &quot;wrong&quot; decision under this belief system <br/>
since all decisions were already decided upon.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing, for us to have all decided on this particular outcome, <br/>
together, before we cam to the life, is an amazing feat of coordination <br/>
far beyond that which any computer could accomplish. Every single <br/>
decision any of ever made in our lives had to be coordinated to make <br/>
sure we were all here on this list together and posting exactly what we <br/>
posted. And that means every decision anybody else any of us have ever <br/>
had contact with had to be coordinated to make sure we had the <br/>
experiences we had that would guarantee we&#39;d be on this list posting <br/>
exactly what we posted.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to Joanne, I never thought Judie would be mean. I doubt it very <br/>
very much - based on what I saw here I suspect she actually is very <br/>
compassionate and kind. It is the &quot;belief&quot; itself that seems, not mean, <br/>
but dangerous in terms of how society would function if too many people <br/>
believed it. There would be no point in locking up child molesters, for <br/>
example, if the molester and the child had already CHOSEN in advance <br/>
whether or not the molestation was going to take place.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of unschooling, it says to me that it doesn&#39;t matter how we <br/>
parent or educate our children, that its already been decided what they <br/>
will experience in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Its the mechanical nature of life, under this kind of belief, that <br/>
makes me want to look at it more closely. The people I know who believe <br/>
things similar to this don&#39;t, in practice, ACT like they believe it, in <br/>
my opinion. They act like the things they do really matter, they act <br/>
like they are making decisions now (not just carrying out decisions <br/>
made in a former lifetime or predestined by God or otherwise <br/>
predecided). They say things like, &quot;We homeschool so that we can do <br/>
what we want.&quot; But that doesn&#39;t even make sense if they really believe <br/>
that they&#39;ve already decided, in advance, what is going to happen and <br/>
nothing could stop it anyway.<br/>

<br/>
No, maybe he PLANNED to go to prison, and all involved have already chosen <br/>
the lawyers, judge and jury so that it will work out as they &quot;predestined&quot; it to.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of predestination is along the lines of how many angels can dance on <br/>
the head of a pin, and can God make a rock so big he himself can&#39;t pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the idea that if God is omnicient, he must know what he&#39;s going to do <br/>
and what we&#39;re going to do.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone propose that humans are <br/>
omnicient, not even spirit-plane humans, so it&#39;s not a philosophical question of <br/>
omnicience.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way I think of this, it&#39;s not the decisions that are made before we are <br/>
born, but it&#39;s the circumstances and experiences we choose to have that are <br/>
thought out and decided upon before we come into the world.  <br/>
<br/>
Free will is part of this idea, that we can choose how we react and deal with <br/>
the circumstances in our lives.  The feeling that something was supposed to <br/>
happen in order for other things to happen is something that I experience <br/>
often.  I even get the feeling that those experiences were somehow planned, <br/>
organized, and that there is, indeed, a divine hand at work in the course of my life. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is the &quot;belief&quot; itself that seems, not mean, <br/>
but dangerous in terms of how society would function if too many people <br/>
believed it. There would be no point in locking up child molesters, for <br/>
example, if the molester and the child had already CHOSEN in advance <br/>
whether or not the molestation was going to take place. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People who believe in this idea often also believe in karma, reincarnation <br/>
and that we are spiritual beings in a physical body.  It is the experiences of <br/>
physicality that are important, profound, no matter what the experience, good <br/>
or bad.  The idea follows that if we were a molestor in one life, that we may <br/>
then choose to experience the other side of that behavior as the victim. ( <br/>
That&#39;s how I understand karma. ) In order to be a victim, someone must agree to be <br/>
the offender.  That offender may offer their life to spend in jail, that <br/>
could be one circumstance agreed upon as well.  Maybe that person would try to <br/>
find value in that time spent on earth, I dunno.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In terms of unschooling, it says to me that it doesn&#39;t matter how we <br/>
parent or educate our children, that its already been decided what they <br/>
will experience in their lives.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it does matter what we each one of us choose to do, I believe in free <br/>
will.  We can forget about the agreements we have made, we can choose to <br/>
ignore that still small voice that speaks from our hearts.  I believe that this <br/>
happens more often than not, and is why the world is as it is. <br/>
<br/>
And that some children that are molested, for example, did not agree to that <br/>
experience, and they have the hardest time with their experience in life.  The <br/>
person whom hurt someone else must then attone for the pain they caused, and <br/>
karma kicks in.  In their next life, or maybe inbetween lives, they will <br/>
experience the pain they inflicted.  I believe that the idea of heaven and hell <br/>
comes from this karmatic balancing.  We are all one, what we do to one, we do to <br/>
ourselves, in that way.   <br/>
<br/>
There are some that do remember, and those people don&#39;t necessarily stop <br/>
learning lessons, or have a perfect life, either.  Most choose to try to make life <br/>
better for everyone and take on challenges that others aren&#39;t ready for.  I <br/>
think of people like Ghandi and Mother Theresa and even Jesus or Buddha.  Those <br/>
people didn&#39;t have perfect lives, I believe that they were human and did the <br/>
best that they could with the life they chose.  But I believe those people <br/>
followed the path they decided upon much more closely than most do, if that makes <br/>
sense.  They remembered who they really were.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; They act like the things they do really matter, they act <br/>
like they are making decisions now (not just carrying out decisions <br/>
made in a former lifetime or predestined by God or otherwise <br/>
predecided). They say things like, &quot;We homeschool so that we can do <br/>
what we want.&quot; But that doesn&#39;t even make sense if they really believe <br/>
that they&#39;ve already decided, in advance, what is going to happen and <br/>
nothing could stop it anyway. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I hope I shed a little light on the idea by explaining my beliefs, but they <br/>
are only as I understand them.  I am always learning.  :-) <br/>

&lt;&lt;People who believe in this idea often also believe in karma, reincarnation <br/>

<br/>
Karma doesn&#39;t say you choose anything in advance.<br/>
<br/>
It says people should be and are ultimately striving to be good, and some <br/>
people do it in a few lifetimes and some take many more lifetimes because they&#39;re <br/>
not focussing.  So their suffering and their ill deeds are affecting others, <br/>
and eventually they&#39;ll become more enlightened.   <br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t even BEGIN to say that people deserve or chose to be victims.  <br/>
Being a victim is a moment when the victim decides how to act, and his own <br/>
choices affect his own karma.<br/>
<br/>
Each soul is growing toward a better place.<br/>
No soul would choose to be bad or to cause harm in advance of rebirth.  That <br/>
makes no sense.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the theory someone mentioned earlier that there are just some bad souls <br/>
who keep coming back bad is more akin to vampire fantasies than anything else <br/>
I&#39;ve ever heard in my life.  That or the Christian idea of demons tempting <br/>
people so Satan can get the soul instead of God.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In order to be a victim, someone must agree to be <br/>
the offender.  That offender may offer their life to spend in jail, that <br/>
could be one circumstance agreed upon as well.  Maybe that person would try <br/>
to <br/>
find value in that time spent on earth, I dunno.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This kind of stuff is made-up new-age stuff.  People will write and sell all <br/>
kinds of fantasy &quot;what if&quot; that they thought might make someone feel better.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as a religion in any way whatsoever, and that goes back to my <br/>
other question about what &quot;beliefs&quot; we should honor as someone&#39;s sincerely <br/>
held view of the universe and their moral place in it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I believe that the idea of heaven and hell <br/>
comes from this karmatic balancing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Karmic.<br/>
<br/>
One way or another, no matter what people believe, doing good has got to be <br/>
better than doing evil.<br/>

When I was molested at 13 it was my destiny and he should not have been <br/>
locked up? Im surprised at this statement. If this ever happened to your child you <br/>

<br/>
MY molester just went to jail for molesting his own daughter over the past 10 <br/>
years. She is now a mess you think that is destiny???? <br/>
<br/>
I think not. Destiny should have been me putting him in jail had the people <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749599809">It was a quote from one of my posts, but I wasn&#39;t saying I believe it.  <br/>
Quite the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
My point was that if someone REALLY believed that individuals had,  <br/>
before this lifetime,  chosen to be molested - in fact had arranged it  <br/>
with their molester - that there would be no reason to jail a molester.  <br/>
If it was supposed to happen it would happen - jailing wouldn&#39;t prevent  <br/>
anything. And, according to the same beliefs, we&#39;re supposed to  <br/>
recognize that the poor molester was doing the molested person a favor  <br/>
by carrying out this horrendous act so that the molested person could  <br/>
learn whatever lesson they were supposed to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t promoting it - I was saying that it would be dangerous if too  <br/>
many people believed it. It is the most extreme version of &quot;blame the  <br/>
victim&quot; I&#39;ve ever heard.<br/>

Yeah.<br/>
We&#39;re trying to explain WHY people were questioning the philosophy that said <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
No sense getting grumpy now.  The person who explained that her beliefs <br/>
included that has left the list, but why didn&#39;t you get angry when SHE said it?<br/>

There are just too many people here who chose NOT to read all that stuff as <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; If this ever happened to your child you <br/>

<br/>
I was NOT &quot;speaking that crap,&quot; I was explaining why we weren&#39;t being <br/>

those decisions were made before people are born.<br/>

Yes, I think it was crap.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464428362">I just needed to add this...  I don&#39;t think anyone was ever saying <br/>
that we should not have compassion for other people.  Using <br/>
different wording, I feel like what was meant is that everything <br/>
happens for a reason.  Everything happens in order for each of us to <br/>
reach enlightenment.  It may feel great or it may feel bad, but it <br/>
happened to teach us something we needed to know, to work though, to <br/>
experience in order to reach enlightenment and to be truely happy.<br/>
   So again, I don&#39;t believe it was ever meant that we should not <br/>
care what happens to people, or that we should say &quot;well it&#39;s her <br/>
fault such and such happened because she decided it would before she <br/>
came to this earth.&quot;<br/>
   It is really hard to have a conversation like this over email.  <br/>
No one can really understand what someone else is saying because you <br/>
can&#39;t see the person, you can&#39;t hear his/her tone of voice (infact <br/>
we tend to add a tone ouselves wether or not it&#39;s valid) etc....<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As a general statement about emotional tone on email lists, it is sure <br/>
enough true.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t very often possible to know from people&#39;s general comments if <br/>
they believe in predestination in a stern way or in a gentle, <br/>
compassionate way.  I think we&#39;re teetering on the brink of the big <br/>
chasm between &quot;how it sounds&quot; and &quot;how it sounds inside the brain of the <br/>
person that wrote it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not really intending to argue here.  Just seeing some truth in the one <br/>
sentence quoted above.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been so hot here that we haven&#39;t wanted to leave the house, except <br/>
early in the morning, and we&#39;re all getting kind of crabby.  Tomorrow <br/>
will be more exciting because I&#39;m going to the dentist.  (oh, joy) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  My 2 cents on predestination: life is harsh enough that I find <br/>
believing that life is harsh on purpose to teach us lessons WAY too <br/>
harsh to accept.  Even though I&#39;ve seen how terrible experiences can <br/>
build character, I don&#39;t recommend that path to anyone that I&#39;m fond of.<br/>

longer posts that wore me out.</div>

  I just needed to add this...  I don&#39;t think anyone was ever saying <br/>
that we should not have compassion for other people.  Using <br/>
different wording, I feel like what was meant is that everything <br/>
happens for a reason.  Everything happens in order for each of us to <br/>
reach enlightenment.  It may feel great or it may feel bad, but it <br/>
happened to teach us something we needed to know, to work though, to <br/>
experience in order to reach enlightenment and to be truely happy.<br/>
Maybe YOU feel this way, and I am sure others believe/feel this way too. <br/>
Regardless, the original poster said in one of her many posts, and I quote; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Whatever lesson they had to learn from it, they chose it.  I don&#39;t have to <br/>
feel bad about what they are experiencing.&quot; From Judie, the original poster of <br/>
this comment. Who after many direct questions, couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t explain <br/>
herself or her ideals more clearly. And you can say that you think she may have <br/>
meant this in a different way, but we will truly never know one way or the <br/>
other. All the rest of us can do is accept that what she said is what she meant. <br/>
It is faulty logic to say she might have meant something more gentle, when she <br/>
repeatedly said that was exactly what she wanted to say and never clarified <br/>
it with better language. Arguing the point again and again amongst ourselves is <br/>
a moot point, shaming others for posting their opinions of her posts won&#39;t <br/>
get us further either. She is gone and we can&#39;t interpret what she might have <br/>
wanted to say because all we have to go on is what she did say. <br/>
<br/>
I really must repeat what better people have said before me. Commenting on <br/>
one snip in a post out of hundreds isn&#39;t realistic. Maybe reading the whole <br/>
thread would help. And that could be hard to do at this point because subject <br/>
lines have changed, the original poster has left. Without explaining her beliefs <br/>
more clearly, I doubt you or anyone could say, I don&#39;t think she meant this or <br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
   So again, I don&#39;t believe it was ever meant that we should not <br/>

   It is really hard to have a conversation like this over email.  <br/>
No one can really understand what someone else is saying because you <br/>
can&#39;t see the person, you can&#39;t hear his/her tone of voice (infact <br/>
we tend to add a tone ouselves wether or not it&#39;s valid) etc....<br/>
   Anyway, that&#39;s how I feel, thanks<br/>
-Jennifer V<br/>
No, it isn&#39;t hard to have a conversation like this in email, what is hard is <br/>
when people don&#39;t say what they mean. Assigning a tone of voice isn&#39;t a good <br/>
excuse either. One of the tenants of this list is to be careful of what you <br/>
write so that people can take what you have written at face value. At the risk of <br/>
repeating others, another guideline is that if you don&#39;t want a belief <br/>
questioned then don&#39;t hold it out to the group. This is a discussion group, not a <br/>
support group. I hate the subject line of this thread, unschooling isn&#39;t a form <br/>
of homeschooling, unschooling is beyond that, so when someone questions <br/>
whether something is unschooling or not then I realize that someone does not grasp <br/>
unschooling fully. I am not saying that person is you. I am just making a <br/>
general observation. I&#39;ve seen this heading before. Unfortunately, I am sure I will <br/>
see it again.<br/>

be the value of a lesson learned by a molester who goes free?  Not as<br/>
valuable a lesson as that learned by a molester who is penalized I<br/>

Let me just close by saying - so there&#39;s no question in anyone&#39;s mind -<br/>
I in no way support letting the bad guy go because the good guy might<br/>
learn something from it... That&#39;s crap.  If people believe that it was<br/>
all arranged beforehand for the purpose of a lesson, they would likely<br/>
further believe the molester has a lesson coming too (possibly in the<br/>
form of several years of torture from his fellow inmates... Sorry this<br/>

Subject: Re: Re: Beliefs is this unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
It was a quote from one of my posts, but I wasn&#39;t saying I believe it.  <br/>
Quite the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
My point was that if someone REALLY believed that individuals had,  <br/>
before this lifetime,  chosen to be molested - in fact had arranged it  <br/>
with their molester - that there would be no reason to jail a molester.<br/>
<br/>
If it was supposed to happen it would happen - jailing wouldn&#39;t prevent<br/>
<br/>
anything. And, according to the same beliefs, we&#39;re supposed to  <br/>
recognize that the poor molester was doing the molested person a favor  <br/>
by carrying out this horrendous act so that the molested person could  <br/>
learn whatever lesson they were supposed to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t promoting it - I was saying that it would be dangerous if too  <br/>
many people believed it. It is the most extreme version of &quot;blame the  <br/>
victim&quot; I&#39;ve ever heard.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the problem that most people have with it as well, and I understand <br/>
that.  In it&#39;s simplest version that&#39;s exactly what it sounds like.  That&#39;s why <br/>
I wasn&#39;t surprised when Judie did not get a warm reception about her beliefs.  <br/>
It seemed to me that she may have had a incomplete understanding at the time <br/>
and wasn&#39;t comfortable answering about that aspect.  Sometimes I am as well.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s incredibly difficult to understand and explain that blaming the victim <br/>
is not at all what I am implying when I tell someone that maybe something was <br/>
meant to be.  I am only thinking that when something has already happened and <br/>
the person is trying to move on from, to heal from, to recover from, that <br/>
trauma, at a certain point in their life or process, that idea MAY help them. This <br/>
is not a theory for me, but personal experience.  It is a complicated, painful <br/>
experience, to learn a life lesson from something they most definitely DID <br/>
NOT WANT to happen to them. <br/>
<br/>
But maybe, if that person looks back and sees the progression of their lives <br/>
from that moment, sees the path they have taken and that they like where they <br/>
are now, they may look back and see that if all that good came from the bad, <br/>
would they undo the trauma if they could?  Would they remove all they learned <br/>
from that experience from their life?  In my own experience I could honestly <br/>
say, no, I wouldn&#39;t, and part of that acceptance is that maybe it was meant to <br/>
be that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Our spiritual selves are different in many ways then our physical selves.  We <br/>
may choose things on the spiritual plane that we would NEVER AGREE TO if we <br/>
were in a body at the time. The spiritual self wants to learn, and does what it <br/>
needs to do.  It knows that it will be hard on the physical self. It chooses <br/>
it anyway.  I think that this idea may be what most people have a hard time <br/>
accepting or understanding or agreeing with, and without that, the rest makes no <br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
This applies to unschooling because we might not know what&#39;s going to happen <br/>
in our lives, but we can learn as we live, to do our best when the worst comes <br/>
along.   My son is living life and learning about himself, is following his <br/>
own path with courage and confidence.  That might enable him to live his <br/>
purpose, his path, his destiny, whatever you want to call it, whatever he was born <br/>
to do.  I feel that&#39;s my responsiblity to him, to love him and support him as <br/>
he learns about this world and how to live in it, in whatever way he sees fit.  <br/>
Something inside him knows much better what&#39;s good for him and what is not, <br/>
than I do.  I have learned to trust that as much as I can.  <br/>

right support from his parents and others around him, he might be <br/>
enabled to tread that right path?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound like predestination to me, particularly not like a <br/>
predestined path that he&#39;s chosen already and contracted with everyone <br/>
else who would need to carry out their part to make it all happen <br/>
exactly as it is supposed to. It sounds like hopefulness that he&#39;ll <br/>
live a life that is meaningful to him, regardless of what life throws <br/>
at him, and awareness that how he is parented matters in that process.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say there are many, infinitely many, possible paths that are open <br/>
to him and that this is more like a joint interactive story - a sort of <br/>
&quot;choose your own adventure&quot;  life - that our life&#39;s path is being <br/>
created by how we respond to the tests and difficulties (and joys and <br/>
triumphs and everything else) along the way AND how other people are <br/>
responding in their own lives.<br/>
