text came from me.  Perhaps your email software is burping.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;let them, but I don&#39;t buy it. I grew up with very limited TV<br/>
&gt; &gt; watching, and (as a result, I believe) I don&#39;t watch much TV now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Virtually all the folks I know who don&#39;t watch TV as adults grew up<br/>
&gt; &gt; without TVs or with very limited TV watching. Sure, kids clamor for<br/>
&gt; &gt; forbidden fruit, but they also fill their lives up with other<br/>
&gt; &gt; interesting things and forget that the TV is even there.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My dh grew up with no electricity at all. He never saw a tv until he<br/>
was<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; older teenager.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He LOVES it -- he still has the same sense of it being VERY COOL and<br/>
amazing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We got a tv when I was 4 or 5 -- we watched a lot, I think. My mom says<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; limited it but I sure remember watching it!!! There are shows I like --<br/>
but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t watch a whole lot. I&#39;m pretty selective about what I&#39;ll spend my<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; on -- I have too many other things to do - like participate in email<br/>
&gt; discussions &lt;G&gt;. My 17 yo has had unlimited tv and she watches almost<br/>
none --<br/>
&gt; only an occasional episode of the the Simpsons. My 14 yo has always had<br/>
&gt; unlimited tv and she watches almost none - she does watch videos of<br/>
operas<br/>
&gt; and musicals. My 11 yo has always had unlimited tv and she watches<br/>
slightly<br/>
&gt; more than the other girls - but is, like me, pretty selective about<br/>
what<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; watches. My husband, who had no tv as a kid, watches more than the rest<br/>
of<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; put together, for sure.<br/>
