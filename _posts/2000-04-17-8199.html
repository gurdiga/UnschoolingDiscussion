<div id="ygrps-yiv-986103907">Hi Amy:<br/>
<br/>
My big worry for not having a 4th is we can&#39;t afford a van to transport<br/>
a family of 6!!!  But we may yet work that out...We have a 3 bedroom<br/>
house in yet all 5 of us co-sleep in one room.  If we ever have another<br/>
baby Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s room will be VERY crowded!!!  It seems the joy of a<br/>
new baby surely outweighs the need for my husband and me to have free<br/>
space in our bed.  Even my older children positively BEG for another<br/>
baby.  They recognize what a gift a little bundle truly is.  They&#39;re<br/>
willing to sacrifice all kinds of priveleges if we were only blessed<br/>
with a 4th.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your house-hunting!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I just had to chime in on this one. I was so disapointed when dh told me it<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t realistic for me to keep having babies and I said I would stop once<br/>
&gt; we had grand kids LOL. Unfortunatly due to space limitations I think we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; going to have to be done at 3, althogh we won&#39;t do anything permantly. If we<br/>
&gt; ever get out of our tiny little 2br. house I&#39;d be pregnant with #4 as soon<br/>
&gt; as we sign the purchase and sale.&lt;G&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey Bridget,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You know I&#39;m starting to think of some options along those lines too!<br/>
&gt; &gt; (re: foster children or adoption)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wow, can I relate to the baby addiction!  It&#39;s unbelievable to me how<br/>
&gt; &gt; many of my cohorts - many of them past 40 yr.- who are still holding out<br/>
&gt; &gt; for another baby.  (I&#39;m not yet there but give me a moment...)  I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of us are just &quot;baby machines&quot; and it&#39;s what makes us happiest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Even as a child I used to love everyone else&#39;s babies.  Being only 7 or<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8 myself I&#39;d ring the neighbours&#39; doorbells asking if I could take their<br/>
&gt; &gt; babies on walks.  And I&#39;d just want to sit and cuddle those babies and<br/>
&gt; &gt; very young children.  It was such fun!  I&#39;ve travelled, have almost 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; degrees, have various talents/abilities/social connections and have had<br/>
&gt; &gt; all kinds of &quot;worldly experiences&quot;, yet babies are still my number one<br/>
&gt; &gt; interest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW, I&#39;m Sonia Ulan (my maiden name)...S.Ulan...SULAN!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think Sulan must be a real name on it&#39;s own as I&#39;ve tried using it as<br/>
&gt; &gt; a password or user name on some sites and get refused that it&#39;s already<br/>
&gt; &gt; taken.  Our family has traced back our family tree to Gengis Khan, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; other &quot;royal ties&quot; to Mongolia.  (Capital city:  Ulan-Bator)  For<br/>
&gt; &gt; centuries though, our ancestry has been of Ukrainian descent.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You didn&#39;t ask for all that but I thought I&#39;d pass on some history.<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Turns out Princess Diana was a descendent of Gengis Khan too!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I always think of you as being named sulan b/c of your e-mail.! LOL!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway,my dh and I decided we will have to do foster care if there is<br/>
&gt; any lag<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time between our kids being grownup and grandchildren arriving! We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; addicted to babies!<br/>

<br/>
I remember being really impressed when I once read that Paul and Lynda<br/>
McCartney restricted themselves to two bedrooms in their home and they<br/>
slept with their four children.  Despite having a rather grand English<br/>
estate and &quot;all the money in the world&quot;, they still had their<br/>
priorities:  BABIES!!!  And close family intimacy.<br/>
<br/>
Now that&#39;s a testimonial.<br/>
