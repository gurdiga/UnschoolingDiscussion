&gt;  then cut 1-2 a month till he was 12mo. This sounds like it was a very <br/>

&gt;  had was the drooling and a cold/runny nose the weekend prior to the <br/>
&gt;  teeth cutting in. Corallyn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both of my children had a similar schedule...except that they cut their first <br/>
teeth at 3 months.  Imagine my surprise.<br/>
<br/>
DS #2 lost his first baby tooth when he &#39;bit&#39; 2 legos apart.  I didn&#39;t even <br/>
know he had a loose tooth and rushed him to the dentist, complete with <br/>
putting the tooth in milk to preserve it so it could be re-implanted!  The <br/>
dentist was very kind about it when he assured me the tooth was simply loose <br/>
and had fallen out just like it was supposed to.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
He also explained that when the milk teeth are getting ready to come out, the <br/>
new tooth absorbs the root of the baby tooth, so there really is nothing for <br/>
the tooth to hang on to when it&#39;s time for the new tooth to come in.  That&#39;s <br/>
why they get wiggly.  So, if you want to verify whether it is decay or simple <br/>
growth, look at the tooth.  If there is a distinct ring around it at the gum <br/>
line and there is still root, decay would be an issue.  If (as I suspect) <br/>
there is pretty much no root, but only a jagged bottom with a normal looking <br/>
tooth on top, the tooth was simply ready to come out.  <br/>
<br/>
Another clue would be which tooth came out.  If it is a front tooth, top or <br/>
bottom, I&#39;d place my bets on natural growth.  These teeth do not have decay <br/>
as readily as the back teeth and they are the first to grow in/fall out in <br/>
the normal teething pattern.<br/>
<br/>
The real give away will be if a matching tooth gets loose or comes out <br/>
soon...I&#39;ll bet it does.  Besides, even if it is decay...good brushing habits <br/>
now will protect the adult teeth and it hasn&#39;t hurt him any at all to have <br/>
this one lost at age 5.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW,<br/>
