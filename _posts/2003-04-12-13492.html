&lt;&lt; So, is unschoolingdotcom<br/>
 <br/>
 and unschooling-dotcom the same e-list? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a message board AND an email list. We refer to both of them as <br/>
unschoolingdotcom at times.<br/>
It&#39;s the email list that gets people&#39;s knickers in a twist! Most of the time <br/>
anyway....we had a bad week at the message board not too long ago also.<br/>

Okay, thanks. I&#39;m on the e-list I just wasn&#39;t sure if there was one I didn&#39;t know about. I don&#39;t understand how to navigate the message boards though so I don&#39;t really read there.<br/>
