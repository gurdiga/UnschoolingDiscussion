<div id="ygrps-yiv-273032918">But I  like my own time a lot <br/>
more now than I ever did. I have more books I want  to read, want to <br/>
watch movies I choose, want to eat when and what I feel  like eating, <br/>
and so on. <br/>

***You are so right Pam.  A few years ago I went to a dance weekend by  <br/>
myself and was camping.  I was at a complete loss to know how much food to  take.  <br/>
How much food to I eat??  Do I need to use the bathroom?? It  was so strange <br/>
to scale down, and be self-focused.  For years I didn&#39;t let  myself have <br/>
fiction in the house for me.  I wasn&#39;t an attentive mom with my  nose in the book, <br/>
and I couldn&#39;t seem to read just a little!!  In these  last few years I have <br/>
made up for that.  A time, and a season----<br/>
