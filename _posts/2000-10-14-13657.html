<div><font face="Sans" size="4">&nbsp;I&#39;m also homeschooling an &quot;only&quot; child. Well, 
not really , my oldest is 28 with children older than her sister. I&#39;m 48 myself 
and had not encountered any &quot;baby boomer&quot; moms with young homeschoolers. sherry, 
have you thought of developing a new interest, something perhaps you always 
wanted to learn but never had the time before. After years as an RN,and 
suffering from severe burn out, I dropped out of the work force, re-evaliated my 
life and proceeded to start over. during this recouping phase, found myself 
unexpectedly, &quot;expecting&quot; and thus begun this wonderful and creative phase of my 
life. I found that I had interests and talents I never knew I had, took up oil 
painting with a passion. Now, at age five, daughter is developing her own 
creative pursuits right along side Mom. sherry, I would say take some 
&quot;reflective&quot; time. I know deep down there&#39;s a yearning to do something that 
perhaps you always felt you couldn&#39;t or circumstances wouldn&#39;t let you.
