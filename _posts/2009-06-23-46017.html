&gt; Right.  She&#39;s very right.  Too much eye contact is hostile primate<br/>
&gt; behavior.  Don&#39;t go against instincts when you don&#39;t have to!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was in an anatomy for bodyworkers class this weekend, and the<br/>
instructor is a somatic psychotherapist. He was talking about eye<br/>
contact, and how incredibly potent it is from a biochemical<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, gazing into the eyes of another at the distance of a<br/>
nursing baby from its mother (about 18&quot;, roughly) has the potential to<br/>
release large amounts of oxytocin into the bloodstream,<br/>
creating/facilitati ng bonding between two people on an emotional<br/>
level. Thus, he explained, it&#39;s *extremely* important that if you&#39;re<br/>
going to engage in eye contact at that general range, you need to make<br/>
sure your intent is loving and connecting and no other thing, because<br/>
it &quot;screws with the hormonal soup&quot; otherwise, and that&#39;s part of why<br/>
eye contact with the intent to manipulate or intimidate is so<br/>
incredibly upsetting. On a biochemical level, it&#39;s wrong.<br/>
<br/>
He suggested that for conversations involving two people but not that<br/>
level of deep contact, it&#39;s often far better to be facing the same<br/>
way, shoulder to shoulder (which is why talking on walks or during<br/>
drives is often really good), because there isn&#39;t the same level of<br/>
hormonal involvement that way.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, YMMV,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548020857">I accidentally sent a &quot;post returned&quot; note to the list and it  <br/>
embarrassed the sender.<br/>
<br/>
We just recently discussed why it&#39;s not good to send a post that says  <br/>
no more than &quot;thanks&quot; or &quot;me too,&quot; and it was added to the new posting  <br/>
guidelines, also discussed here, but the purpose is not to gum up the  <br/>
list.  I accidently gummed up the list myself, and I apologize to  <br/>
Clare.  I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
