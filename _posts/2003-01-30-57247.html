 </span></blockquote>Me too, Kevin.  All the stuff that you said in your post is true in our <br/>
lives; why, I could&#39;ve written it and changed the name of the kid and the <br/>
pronouns to he and him.  Not only did our son&#39;s unschooling swimming <br/>
convince us (well, we were already convinced, but it was a great talking <br/>
point when speaking to others), it convinced our son!  He had the <br/>
confidence to know that if he could teach himself when all those lessons <br/>
had &quot;failed,&quot; he could be responsible to know what he wanted to learn and <br/>
how and could do it.  He had the experience the week after we pulled him <br/>
out of school.<br/>

P.S.  The other difference is that we don&#39;t have a big shallow area with <br/>
steps, but we do have a LOT of fun! <br/>
