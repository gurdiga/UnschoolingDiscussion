<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-56608755">I hope its ok for me to send this to you guys.  YOu are all so creative, so I&#39;d love to hear what you all think of this, and let me know if you have any other ideas or experiences.<br/>
<br/>
If the list is the wrong place for this, can you send it to me privately at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:litlrooh@...">litlrooh@...</a>  .<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m compiling ideas for my husband&#39;s 50th birthday and wanted to run some of them past you guys.<br/>
<br/>
I think I will have a party with all of his friends etc.  They will be told to either dress in black or wear a black armband.<br/>
<br/>
When I send the invitations, I&#39;ll send a questionaire with it that they have to fill out and send back (so nobody forgets to bring them to the party).<br/>
<br/>
The questionaire will have stuff like &quot;my favorite memory&quot; or the &quot;the funniest thing I ever saw Dan do&quot; and more.<br/>
<br/>
During the party, I&#39;ll make a toast (or someone will) and say a eulogy.  Then we&#39;ll have each person read their memories out loud.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take pictures and scrapbook the pictures and the memories.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I figure everyone can take care of their own socializing etc.  It will be BYOB.  Its supposed to be an outdoor party, unless it rains.  I think for decorations I&#39;ll stick to black balloons and crepe paper with some candles.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have any other ideas to add to this?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Kristen<br/>

For my mom&#39;s 60th birthday, I made a big poster with photos of her <br/>
from her whole life (you can take old photos to a place with a color <br/>
photocopy machine, or scan and print them from your computer). Since <br/>
my mom&#39;s birthday was a 50&#39;s-era theme, I made the poster like a <br/>
giant neon clock and across the top in neon-ish letters, I <br/>
wrote &quot;Rock Around the Clock with Marsha&quot;, then arranged the photos <br/>
chronologically around the clock. It was one of the biggest hits of <br/>
the party to see all the photos from her life.<br/>
<br/>
Also you can go to this website: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thisdayinmusic.com/cont/choose.html">http://www.thisdayinmusic.com/cont/choose.html</a><br/>
and find out what the number one song was on the day he was born. <br/>
Also maybe search the days/weeks around there and compile a tape of <br/>
the music? Or a tape of his current favorite songs? Have a video <br/>
compilation done of him (you can transfer old home movies to video at <br/>
many camera stores), or a computer running a screensaver of photos? I <br/>
think it&#39;s fun for people who know a person in one facet to see all <br/>
the different sides of them, and photos/music/video are good ways to <br/>
do that.<br/>
