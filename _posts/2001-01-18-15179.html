<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806024655"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE="4" FACE="CAC Moose">Hi everyone I just wanted to share how things were going for myself and my 
<br>son since we began to unschool. 
<br>
<br>We are coming to the end of my third week &quot;unschooling&quot;. &nbsp;Although I am still 
<br>maybe not a pure unschooler, (i am sometimes just nudging him with a 
<br>suggestion - if he says no I drop it, i am trying though!) &nbsp;I have been 
<br>allowing my son to lead the way and it has been wonderful! 
<br>
<br>Not only am I more relaxed, (no more, oh no he doesnt want to do &quot;school&quot;) he 
<br>has been doing more than I ever imagined. &nbsp;We went to a learning store 
<br>together on Tuesday (not even for him but for his brother) and at his 
<br>suggestion came home with way more stuff than I imagined! &nbsp;(and spent more $$ 
<br>too lol)
<br>
<br>My dining room now has posters with the Periodic Table of Elements (which 
<br>even though I haven&#39;t seen him studying he already has more than half down), 
<br>the human skeleton, and the solar system. &nbsp;Also a huge wall map of the US 
<br>that he has been laying on the floor and using while playing Carmen SanDiego!
<br>
<br>Right now, as I check my e-mails and finish a much needed cup of coffee, he 
<br>is watching the National Geographic channel. 
<br>
<br>Since removing him from ps and beginning homeschool on Nov 1st, I was amazed 
<br>at how happy and relaxed he was! &nbsp;Now he has amazed me again because - he is 
<br>even MORE relaxed and happy! &nbsp;And so am I! &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I don&#39;t know if I will be able to 100% unschool, by never nudging him in any 
<br>direction, but what I am doing right now is working, we have banned the word 
<br>school, there is no &quot;start&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; to the learning and he is choosing the 
<br>direction and how deep. &nbsp;He has even worked on some of the workbooks on his 
<br>own. &nbsp;It has been a liberating experience. &nbsp;I am providing the materials and 
<br>stepping back and watching, when he wants to relax and play - ok - that&#39;s 
<br>great too!
<br>
<br>I would like to thank you all for your opinions on unschooling and eclectic 
<br>styles, and I hope I havent bored you all with my long e-mail but I needed to 
<br>share this with other moms who are in this same boat.
<br>
<br>Thank you - Dawn

 </span></blockquote>Hi Dawn!<br/>
<br/>
It is mighty hard to not suggest things to the kids.  I do that myself.  I <br/>
do not feel like I am pushing them as much as exposing them.  For example, <br/>
last summer I signed our son up for tennis with the National Junior Tennis <br/>
League.  The classes were dead cheap ($15 per session each session was <br/>
three weeks long two hours a day m-w-f).  Ian was a bit apprehensive at <br/>
first, but I really just asked him to go to the first class.  Up until the <br/>
time he hit the court he balked!  But you know what, after that first <br/>
class, he LOVED it.  He ended up taking all three summer sessions (nine <br/>
weeks of tennis for $45 is a GREAT price, if you have this program in your <br/>
area, check it out!).  If he had not loved it, I would not have made him <br/>
stay.  Exposing is one thing (even if you have to nudge), forcing it upon <br/>
them against their will is really bad!<br/>
<br/>
Now, he really enjoys tennis.  He will probably never play competitively <br/>
(nor do I want him to), but now he has something he enjoys, and may never <br/>
have known if I had not nudged him.  Now, I did give him full freedom of <br/>
going or not going to the classes.<br/>
I really wanted him to enjoy it, not feel forced into it.<br/>
<br/>
On the opposite side, he had wanted to take Tae Kwon Do, so we arranged to <br/>
go with a homeschooling friend to one of her TKD classes.  He got in there <br/>
and HATED it.    He did the same with soccer.  He wanted to play soccer, so <br/>
I signed him up, paid the $70 to have him go to one 45 minute practice and <br/>
one game a week for 6 weeks.  By the third week he was HATING it.  I did <br/>
not force him to stay with it.  He was really feeling badly about it and <br/>
himself, and the worst thing in the world I could have done is force him to <br/>
stay just because I was out some money.<br/>
<br/>
The same can be applied to academics too.  Nudging them or exposing them to <br/>
new ideas and concepts can be great as long as they are not force <br/>
fed.  Many times resistance to things has to do with just not being ready <br/>
for a concept.  My eight year old son is still not reading (thanks public <br/>
school system).  He spent a full three months thinking about a job he could <br/>
one day do that did not require him to read, hahahahaha!  That led us to <br/>
all kinds of discussions about jobs, what people do, why people do them, <br/>
etc.  Granted, I wish he had put all of that energy into reading, but  I <br/>
will take what I can get. I expose him to books, read to him, point out <br/>
words, spell things out, etc.  I want him to get comfortable with letters <br/>
and words so he will read, so I expose him to them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as far as &#39;leading&#39; goes, I figure that they have led me into many <br/>
new areas of learning MYSELF.  Their questions and ideas have led me on my <br/>
on quest for new knowledge in my own life.  Exposing them to new ideas and <br/>
concepts is just my way to repay the favor.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778772741">Hi Sandi! My 7 year old son reminds me of your 8 year old son. He loves to <br/>
tell me he is going to wait till he is 14 to read. I just smile. It is <br/>
amazing to me how much reading type activities actually take place during <br/>
the day. My son checked out all 4 unabridged audio books of the Harry Potter <br/>
series and sat through them several times. My older son, 11 who is almost an <br/>
obsessive reader (I have to tell him not to take books when we go on bike <br/>
rides.) got the harry Potter trivia game for Christmas. My 7 year old wins <br/>
the game almost every time. This really helped me relax about my son not <br/>
reading. Have a great Day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914026808">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
First, let me say I am really enjoying this list.  A lot of lists are very <br/>
cliquish and hard to come into, but this one has not been that way, so <br/>
thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, today while surfing around looking up some info I came across <br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s (the Teen Lib Handbook and Real Lives author) camp for <br/>
unschooled teens.  Since I am new I have no idea if the info has been <br/>
posted before or not, so I am going to post it and hope maybe someone out <br/>
there can use it.  It does have a link to her personal homepage where you <br/>
can email her directly if you wish.<br/>
<br/>
This is the page of the camp (the Not Back To School <br/>
Camp)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nbtsc.org/">http://www.nbtsc.org/</a>  I kind of wish mine were old enough to send <br/>
to it, but they have quite a few years.<br/>
<br/>
Hope someone finds it useful!  The camp really is run by Grace herself, and <br/>
I thought that was very cool.  If you have older kids, check it out.  It is <br/>
$450 for the week long camp, plus they do have some financial aid available <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
