it&#39;s impossible to not be passionate one way or another.  For <br/>

not having a loved one killed by a drunk, I&#39;m not *passionate* about <br/>

MANY, stanch pro-abortionists have had an abortion, thus their <br/>

own guilt and dont project it onto others.  Its an ineffective ( and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-606973771">Can&#39;t it be its own issue?   According to Jewish Law it is not murder, but<br/>
it is akin to murder; it is allowable when the health of the mother would be<br/>
severely compromised, and I&#39;m not certain there is an actual choice about it<br/>
(according to Jewish law.). This is, of course, if you are Jewish.  Women,<br/>
who have sought out their Rabbi&#39;s for permission, have received the right to<br/>
an abortion for myriad of reasons, which are based on the person. Everyone<br/>
is unique. <br/>
<br/>
I can see helping someone make an alternate choice, but to do so I must<br/>
really be willing to find them other solutions for the reason they are<br/>
seeking the abortion and be willing to step aside respectfully if they deem<br/>
my help inadequate to meet their needs, and choose something else, including<br/>
abortion.  I don&#39;t think most people like abortions; it is a matter, for<br/>
most who make the choice of needs.  Of the women I know who have had them,<br/>
they do not regret; they may wish circumstances were different so they could<br/>
have gone on to have the baby, but they do not regret.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can not see the logic of abortion being equivalent to murder from<br/>
conception on, or every woman who has an early natural abortion has had<br/>
someone die.  Do we bury the remains of our cycle, because perhaps there is<br/>
a conception in there? The chances that a woman has had an extremely early<br/>
miscarriage are quite high...I don&#39;t remember the statistics on it....as far<br/>
as I know I have not, but then have you ever had a late period? One heavy<br/>
than normal? <br/>
<br/>
My child and my unborn child are different in an emotional, and I feel legal<br/>
sense.  I guess I see it this way; were I drowning, and my child drowning, <br/>
and a choice must be made,  please save my child. Even if I&#39;m pregnant. Even<br/>
if the baby is about to be born.  The child I have held, nursed, and loved<br/>
is the one whose rights take precedence.....<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann<br/>

<br/>
I wonder if you are misinterpreting something here. Some people don&#39;t defend abortion per se, but the CHOICE of women to abort or not, and they don&#39;t need to have had one to want to defend that choice. Two different issues.<br/>
I may not agree with abortion myself, but I do support the fact that women should have the right to choose, according to their specific situation and perception of the issue.<br/>
