I once expressed a similar sentiment to a friend, who wisely pointed out that being a hypocrite means saying one thing while doing another; in essence, lying.  Or holding yourself to a different standard from your expectations of them.  Instead, what I was experiencing, as are you, is not that - it&#39;s change.  Growth.  Learning from mistakes.  Or working on your &#39;stuff&#39; and working at appropriate change for the better.  <br/>

That&#39;s western type thinking. You&#39;re seeing it as something to<br/>
acheive, someplace to &quot;get to&quot;, but it&#39;s already right there inside of<br/>
you. <br/>
Being mindful is understanding that everything is perfect in this very<br/>
moment and just living in this moment exactly as it is. Nothing to<br/>
change, no place to get to, nothing need be different. Just sink into<br/>
the moment.<br/>

<br/>
Why don&#39;t you put your kids in school?<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s no &quot;why,&quot; there&#39;s not a reason to do ANYthing.<br/>
<br/>
But many people live with a bad set of &quot;why&quot;:<br/>
**Because my mom will get mad if I don&#39;t.   (and I&#39;m talking grown  <br/>
women here, mothers themselves)<br/>
**What will the neighbors think?<br/>
**I&#39;m afraid of the principal.  (again... grown adults who haven&#39;t  <br/>
been enrolled in a school for years)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve thought about the &quot;why&quot; to have your kids home, it&#39;s worth  <br/>
considering &quot;why&quot; for every other thing.<br/>
<br/>
WHY do you make them go to bed at 8:00?<br/>
If you don&#39;t, WHY not?<br/>
<br/>
WHY do you let them have choices?  What&#39;s the purpose and the benefit  <br/>
to doing that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-or if I should keep plugging away and struggling and put the<br/>
time I would have used &quot;delving&quot; into &quot;working at it.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
DELVE!  (great line from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.)<br/>
<br/>
Delving is working at it.<br/>
Working at it without delving can prolong confusion.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to stop working at it to sit and think about it.  You  <br/>
can think about it while you&#39;re doing it.<br/>
<br/>
-=--Feeling like a hippocrite each time I reverse a &quot;No!&quot; to a  <br/>
&quot;.......Well,<br/>
actually, I don&#39;t see why *not*......&quot; (Which is happening a LOT,  <br/>
recently)-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to feel like a hypocrite anyway, delve into that.   <br/>
&quot;Hypo&quot; and &quot;hippo&quot; are both from Greek.  One means horse.   <br/>
Hippopotamus means &quot;river horse.&quot;  Hippodrome was a place for horse  <br/>
races and chariot races in the good old days (of Greece and Rome).    <br/>
The &quot;hypocrite&quot; word has to do with acting, and not liking the way  <br/>
one&#39;s acting, or feeling that one is not acting in accordance with  <br/>
one&#39;s beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t care a bit about words, ignore all memory of what you  <br/>
just read.<br/>
If you care even a little, though, there&#39;s an example of how you can  <br/>
delve into connections and history and beliefs and spelling and  <br/>
geography and your own feelings with just a quick visit to an online  <br/>
dictionary. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And as to feeling hypocritical about reversals...<br/>
Maybe the problem is just that you say &quot;no&quot; without thinking.<br/>
If FIRST you think and then you speak, you won&#39;t have to reverse  <br/>
yourself so much.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something wonderful Joyce wrote about saying yes:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes</a><br/>
You can say &quot;yes&quot; even when it&#39;s &quot;Yes, but not today.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Objection.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want murderers and sexual deviants to be soothed by the idea  <br/>
that everything is perfect in their moments.<br/>
<br/>
I think mindfulness needs to involve having feelers out for other  <br/>
people&#39;s needs and rights and boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom feels that having a screaming crying fit would make her feel  <br/>
better, and she had no regard for the fear and guilt it might induce  <br/>
in her children, that&#39;s not mindfulness.<br/>
<br/>
I see mindfulness as an active awareness.  There is the potential for  <br/>
better or worse in each moment, and if one mindfully chooses to move  <br/>
toward &quot;better,&quot; then there&#39;s some progress being made.<br/>
<br/>
Too much acceptance of &quot;whatever&quot; is a step away from living mindfully.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not western type thinking to want to get to the better place  <br/>
inside of you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Here&#39;s something Osho wrote:<br/>
-=-&quot; There is no need to search, because all that is, is here and now,<br/>
within you.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
No need to hike around the world, maybe, but people have a lot of  <br/>
things inside them they have suppressed and ignored and denied.  We  <br/>
can&#39;t be everything we can imagine.  There&#39;s not time, for one thing.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  And  some of the things we imagine in our frustrated moments  <br/>
might get us imprisoned or executed.  We can mindfully sort through  <br/>
and do the good things we can imagine, mindful of the people around us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And............<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Truth surrounds you.  It is in the air, it is in the fragrance of  <br/>
the<br/>
flowers, it is in the flow of the river, it is in the green leaves, it<br/>
is in the stars, it is in the dust, it is in you. Only truth is!&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really pretty, but there&#39;s some bullshit out there in the dust  <br/>
and the river and under the leaves too, and it&#39;s best not to step in  <br/>
it and track it all over the house. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the Osho quotes are for advanced maintenance, not for those  <br/>
who say &quot;What on earth are you talking about!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was a baby I bought a book called Chop Wood, Carry Water.   <br/>
It was really inspiring, and reading it was like a mental massage.   <br/>
Years later I went to read it again and found in the end notes of the  <br/>
first chapter, I think, references to Growing Without Schooling and  <br/>
John Holt. &lt;g&gt;  I didn&#39;t notice the first time, because that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
how I was scanning the world.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to see peace, they need to scan for it. If they&#39;re  <br/>
mindful only of things to be afraid of, or to object to, or to be  <br/>
angry about, they&#39;ll see them in the thousands.  If they&#39;re looking  <br/>
for sweetness and peace, they can find that too.<br/>

not trusting MYSELF. I think about whether I lack trust in my children, then I <br/>
think I do, then I second-guess myself and wonder if I&#39;m just lying to <br/>
myself... Could very well be - the way my mother interacted with me caused huge <br/>
self-doubt, lack of confidence and self-loathing. I know I haven&#39;t &quot;dealt&quot; with <br/>
all those old issues, so maybe I need to look more in that direction and clear <br/>
up some of that &quot;old trash&quot; in my closet. Thanks for that questioning! I&#39;ll try <br/>
to &quot;flow&quot; more-I do tend to get uptight and worry about certain things (like <br/>
if I&#39;m approaching things from a poor angle, using less-than-optimal wording, <br/>
etc.).<br/>

Why? Why do you think you feel that way? That should make you feel good and <br/>

Because I feel I&#39;ve been working at &quot;getting it&quot; for so long, I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
have said &quot;No!&quot; in the first place. I hear that, &quot;Time is short&quot; ringing in my <br/>
ears and *see* how fast its going by, and I want to get it right ASAP...  It IS <br/>
moving forward... just so, so slowly... I see what you&#39;re saying... Maybe <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If there&#39;s no &quot;why,&quot; there&#39;s not a reason to do ANYthing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read this and thought, &quot;*I* wrote that??&quot; Aparently, I did not express <br/>
myself well. Appologies.<br/>
<br/>
What I was wondering was if there was enough purpose to spend time figuring <br/>
out why I&#39;m having difficulty getting to that &quot;being respectful&quot; vs. &quot;acting <br/>
respectful&quot;. As someone who can get into a spiral of &quot;if&#39;s&quot;, self-doubt and <br/>
doubts about my own truthfulness with myself, it *might* be either counter <br/>
productive or a waste of a *lot* of time that could be better spent just &quot;getting <br/>
there&quot;. Not why should I bother doing it, just trying to expidite things.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You don&#39;t have to stop working at it to sit and think about it. You <br/>
can think about it while you&#39;re doing it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
Can I? (Not sarcasam-honest question) Maybe the why is what&#39;s keeping me from <br/>
doing it... Maybe the why would show me a different route/method I should be <br/>
taking to get there. I think I make things more difficult than they have to <br/>
be-especially when I don&#39;t understand something very well...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you don&#39;t care a bit about words, ignore all memory of what you <br/>
just read.&gt;&gt;<br/>
:~) Ah, no, I care deeply about words-it may not seem like it when I&#39;m deeply <br/>
emotionally involved in what I&#39;m writing, though. I knew the Greek/river <br/>
horse connection, but not the &quot;acting&quot;. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe the problem is just that you say &quot;no&quot; without thinking.&gt;&gt;<br/>
Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If FIRST you think and then you speak, you won&#39;t have to reverse <br/>
yourself so much.&gt;&gt;<br/>
Yes, it was a problem when I was younger, and a lot of embarrassment helped <br/>
me work through that. This is probably hinged in Wyl wanting an answer &quot;NOW&quot; <br/>
and me feeling rushed, but more in &quot;mother&#39;s voice&quot;  hanging around in my <br/>
subconcious. Another project I need to undertake, but again, not sure how deeply and <br/>
involved that project will be-and honestly, a lot of fear of going there. Not <br/>
to mention fear of the possible solutions I may have to undertake. None of <br/>
which is a valid (or any kind of) reason. I seem to get involved and caught up <br/>
in the middling details and  end up far from where I was originally headed-HEY! <br/>
Focus-that&#39;s what that is, lack of focus!! Wow-this group is SO theraputic. <br/>
Now, I just have to figure out how I can keep myself from going off on tangents <br/>
and keep myself focused.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Here&#39;s something wonderful Joyce wrote about saying yes:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes</a> <br/>
You can say &quot;yes&quot; even when it&#39;s &quot;Yes, but not today.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
I will check that out-I have been heading in that direction and doing a lot <br/>
more of that, but its not often enough.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the thought-inspiring questions and comments. It actually gave <br/>
me more energy and a positive perspective-a direction to head in.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
It might be a normal, healthy part of the search to look outside, and  <br/>
then a common experience of those who feel they&#39;re getting somewhere  <br/>
with it all to see that it&#39;s inside them after all.  Kind of like  <br/>
Dorothy in the movie version of The Wizard of Oz.  But her life  <br/>
wasn&#39;t all that great before she had the experiences (real or  <br/>
imagined).  So if her experiences were head-bonk-and-fright-induced  <br/>
delirium, still she had extreme thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
=So don&#39;t try to &quot;get it&quot;, just BE. And there will be your answer.<br/>
Thank you-I&#39;ll work on that. No, I won&#39;t... I&#39;ll... keep it at the  <br/>
forefront<br/>
of my mind/thinking :~)=<br/>
<br/>
Just be emotionally alert and relaxed.<br/>
Not emotionally zingy and raw, but while you&#39;re thinking, think about  <br/>
your emotions, and how they feel.  If you get angry really easily, be  <br/>
aware of that and also aware of what soothes you (internally).  If  <br/>
you prefer a state of unsettleness and fear, look back into your past  <br/>
and see what that might mean.  It might be worth reading about  <br/>
dysfunctional families if one grew up with parents who were  <br/>
inconsistent in bad ways (alcohol, drugs, other weirdness), and maybe  <br/>
in some cases even talking to a counsellor a few times if self-help  <br/>
books or groups can&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
Work at knowing how it feels to be still, and if it takes a formal  <br/>
practice (meditation, yoga, prayer, trance-of-some-sort, music- <br/>
induced stillness) maybe do that, but when you know what your  <br/>
stillness feels like you&#39;ll be able to get there on your own more  <br/>
often, sometimes just by conscious thought, posture, breathing or  <br/>
something.  It&#39;s not just breathing and posture, it&#39;s the thoughts  <br/>
that go with it.  Prayer works for some people all by itself, because  <br/>
of the attitude of awe and humility.  Some people pray without those,  <br/>
and saying &quot;God grant me patience right now&quot; doesn&#39;t help. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Reading about parenting can be helpful, but I figure people who find  <br/>
a list like this have done lots of that, and now are doing more.   <br/>
Reading bad examples and good examples and running those through our  <br/>
own memories and filters can help.  Knowing what we want NOT to do is  <br/>
as important as having a good model or ideal to aim toward.<br/>
<br/>
Reading doesn&#39;t do it for some people.  Some people run, or hike, and  <br/>
the change of scene, and the rhythm, and the endorphins, and the  <br/>
opportunity to be without outside verbal input helps them sort and  <br/>
clarify.<br/>
<br/>
Something that helped me every time was to smell a  young child&#39;s  <br/>
head.  It helps less with teens than it did with young children (and  <br/>
babies&#39; heads can be intoxicating for moms, which is good!).  One  <br/>
long slow deep breath filled with the smell of my own child&#39;s head  <br/>
was a centering, focussing thing for me.   It won&#39;t work for  <br/>
everyone.  Acrimonious divorces and kids who smell like the dad can  <br/>
be a problem, I think, and anything that works against the increase  <br/>
of peace should probably be avoided.   Smells aren&#39;t talked about  <br/>
much in our culture, except in the ways we spend money and effort to  <br/>
mask our smells.  There&#39;s a whole lot going on in the olfactory  <br/>
realm, but English speakers especially seem to like to reject it and  <br/>
insult any who do base anything on smell.  It&#39;s one of our biggest  <br/>
bastions of ignorance, and won&#39;t be changed in my lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to make conditions like &quot;I will work on being more mindful  <br/>
when my whole house is clean&quot; or &quot;After we finish remodelling&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;After we move&quot; or &quot;When my irritating relatives move away.&quot;  When  <br/>
that happens, it&#39;s almost like co-dependency, or like blackmailing  <br/>
our own souls.  Mindfulness can increase under any circumstances once  <br/>
the person is at a point to understand it as a thing to be desired.    <br/>
Before that point, it can&#39;t be increased at all.   And the Maslow  <br/>
heirarchy of needs comes into play too.  It helps  to have basic  <br/>
needs met before spiritual or emotional learning/growth.  On the  <br/>
other hand, though, prisoners and trauma victims sometimes become  <br/>
very spiritual and philosophical.   There are unknowns, and  <br/>
individual differences.<br/>

If you work on trusting your kids, you might be able to transfer some  <br/>

progress, your trust will increase too.<br/>

<br/>
Are you the kind of person that feels very uncomfortable doing something <br/>
imperfectly?  My son has sometimes seemed to have a pattern of watching <br/>
and waiting and thinking and then sometime after kids his age are <br/>
jumping in and doing something, he&#39;ll finally try it and can suddenly do <br/>
it completely.  This might be the behavior of a person who doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to do things until he can do them without doing them &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
(I wouldn&#39;t say that as a crawling baby he sat there and thought &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
not going to let go until I figure out the not-falling-down part&quot;, but <br/>
he definitely sees performance pitfalls in advance and he apparently <br/>
will practice a new skill inside his head or where other people aren&#39;t <br/>
looking for quite awhile before he tries it.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I also think that some people (including me) can feel flawed and <br/>
shameful when the comment is made that some behavior could be &quot;better&quot;.  <br/>
I suspect that this gremlin is perfectionism. <br/>
<br/>
When people tell me I could do something better, then I get a sense of <br/>
&quot;oh, sh--&quot; and realize that I am NOT perfect and, worse,  that other <br/>
people know it.  (There&#39;s probably some kind of flawed black-or-white <br/>
thinking underlying this, that if I am not completely good, then I must <br/>
be all bad.  Not true!  But an easy trap to fall into.  And even when <br/>
not consciously thinking &quot;Oh, I&#39;m terrible&quot;, I still get nasty feeling <br/>
shame chemicals in my body sometimes over making very simple and <br/>
innocent mistakes.)</div>

  That&#39;s western type thinking. You&#39;re seeing it as something to<br/>
  acheive, someplace to &quot;get to&quot;, but it&#39;s already right there inside of<br/>
  you. <br/>
  Being mindful is understanding that everything is perfect in this very<br/>
  moment and just living in this moment exactly as it is. Nothing to<br/>
  change, no place to get to, nothing need be different. Just sink into<br/>
  the moment.<br/>

Go to your yahoogroups, then to this group, then click &quot;messages.&quot;<br/>

I did save one of Ren&#39;s just this morning, though, here:<br/>

I went to make a page with links to things that would help in these  <br/>

it&#39;s &quot;new/improved.&quot;<br/>

*think* there is a fear of doing something wrong (it &quot;feels&quot; like I am solving a <br/>
puzzle when I do this-and I love puzzle-solving... and yet, I still like to <br/>
eyeball the move or the fit before I do the physical...), but I did get a lot of <br/>
ridicule growing up (peers and parents) when I did something wrong. (I tend not <br/>
to make little mistakes-when I do it, its dazzling! LOL) However, if I do <br/>
something &quot;not right the first time&quot;, NOW, I don&#39;t feel ashamed or &quot;bad&quot; or <br/>
negative... just like I need to do it differently next time... I&#39;m not sure how <br/>
knowing this would help, as I was thinking of it as an &quot;ability&quot; kind of thing? <br/>
I&#39;m not sure :~) I have too much in my head at this point :~)<br/>

I finally made up a word to describe &quot;try&quot; -- it&#39;s a proverb, a word that <br/>
takes the place (and the credit for) an actual verb, i.e. I tried to play <br/>
basketball *really* means, I played basketball.  Though it&#39;s often put in <br/>
where someone doesn&#39;t do as well as expected, &quot;I tried and I failed&quot; is <br/>
somehow easier to accept that &quot;I did and I failed.&quot;  It&#39;s much better to give <br/>
yourself and others credit for what is actually being done (or not done) than <br/>
to use a worthless word like &quot;try.&quot;  One is either doing or not, as in Yoda&#39;s <br/>
powerful quote, there is no in-between.  <br/>
Even &quot;trying&quot; new foods, is really &quot;tasting&quot; or &quot;experiencing&quot; and &quot;trying&quot; <br/>
new behaviors is &quot;doing&quot; new things... <br/>
<br/>
So indeed, nothing would get done if one did not DO &lt;bg&gt; <br/>

That&#39;s so inspiring!<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t like it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I like it for foods, and basketball.  One can play basketball  <br/>
alone in the back yard, or with a friend or two, but there is another  <br/>
level (several levels) of &quot;playing basketball.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone can claim to have tried unschooling, and might tell all their  <br/>
friends and half the online world that they unschooled for a  year  <br/>
and it didn&#39;t work.  On closer examination, sometimes it&#39;s hard to  <br/>
find out what they did that made them think &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unless one reaches a certain point, it&#39;s neither trying nor doing.<br/>
<br/>
I could say I&#39;m being a vegetarian.  I didn&#39;t have meat at breakfast  <br/>
or at dinner last night.  That&#39;s almost 24 hours of no meat.<br/>
<br/>
I could say I&#39;m exercising now, because I worked in the yard half an  <br/>
hour yesterday, walked to the video store and walked to the grocery  <br/>
store, all in one day.  But if I really &quot;started exercising&quot; I think  <br/>
I would need at least an hour a day of some sort of real, planned,  <br/>
fairly concentrated activity, not just three small happenstances.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t try vegetarianism or exercise.  I didn&#39;t start either one,  <br/>
either.  I had a more meatless and more active day than usual. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, you&#39;re right, and still it doesn&#39;t apply in all cases.<br/>
