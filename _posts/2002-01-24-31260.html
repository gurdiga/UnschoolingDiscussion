<div id="ygrps-yiv-245226852">Ouch! That is high. Now I understand why my son&#39;s plastic surgeon (7<br/>
year old had a cleft lip and has a cleft upper gum) charges me $110 for<br/>
15 mins of his time. He is still paying off his loans and for insurance.<br/>
<br/>
Here again is where I think trade school is great. I was just looking at<br/>
my husband&#39;s school loan stuff when I was cleaning out the file cabinet<br/>
and I didnt realize he only spent 12 grand on school. Not bad really. To<br/>
us at the time it seemed like huge amounts of money (we were 21 with 2<br/>
toddlers and  a 3rd on the way). Of course this was for Graphic Design<br/>
like I said before most of what he does now he learned from working with<br/>
company after company and having them put him threw training and paying<br/>
for it as well.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the system changes too. I would love to see college cost a lot<br/>
less. That would be nice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve searched all my shelves for that book so it must have been one I <br/>
checked out at the library. I&#39;ll keep looking for the exact figures <br/>
and will post them then. I just remember being floored by the amount <br/>
of insurance these doctors have to pay. Some pay less, others pay <br/>
more. I think $50,000 was the average for a general surgeon. Brain <br/>
surgeons were much, much higher. Regular MD&#39;s were less, etc. If it <br/>
was a specialty doc, though, the numbers were high.<br/>
So, yes, doctors make a lot of money. But they also have a tremendous <br/>
school debt to pay off and insurance premiums to pay and on and on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759922432">I know I have a terribly unrealistic view of college costs and I&#39;m sure it<br/>
will jump up to bite me one of these days....soon.  But my husband and I<br/>
both went through college and between the two of us we only had $300 in<br/>
student loans.  He went for 5 years and was there on a disability<br/>
scholarship for a knee injury.  My parents paid for one semester, then I<br/>
lived on my own long enough that when I went back to the university a year<br/>
later I was &quot;independent&quot; and qualified for Pell grants for all except part<br/>
of summer school on semester.  My husband&#39;s knee injury was fairly serious,<br/>
but he&#39;s 40 and just hiked 90 miles in the mountains last summer (plus much<br/>
more physical stuff with Scouts), so it obviously doesn&#39;t hamper him much (a<br/>
few rainy day aches, on occasion).  But his senior year in high school, the<br/>
state dept. of vocational rehabilitation came to his school *begging* people<br/>
to apply for state disability funds.  He comes from a small rural county<br/>
(MO) and there aren&#39;t that many who go to college...they had money to burn.<br/>
So he got a full scholarship that would have paid everything for as long as<br/>
he wanted to go to college.<br/>
<br/>
As I said...I know it is unrealistic and I know that grant money has been<br/>
cut way down in the last decade or so, but I just can&#39;t get serious about<br/>
thinking about paying for college yet.<br/>

Somebody slap me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690110862">There is absolutely scads of money out there for college!  The problem is<br/>
you have to work for it, as in research and sending out tons of apps.  Most<br/>
kids aren&#39;t willing to do that.  There are dozens of scholarships that go<br/>
unclaimed every year at most colleges.  Why, because no one wants to apply<br/>
for them because they aren&#39;t worth the bother, they are only $100 or $200<br/>
each.<br/>

Well, when I went back to school (just 10 year ago), I went through the<br/>
financial aide office like a cloud of locusts and ended up receiving checks<br/>
between Pell and the scholarships that totaled over $1200 a month plus a<br/>
book grant, fees grant, daycare grant (didn&#39;t need), transportation/mileage<br/>
grants, supplies grant and what and all else I don&#39;t remember, oh and an<br/>
on-campus employment grant which was another $800 a month!<br/>
