<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020917683">Hi Pams and honorary members of the Pam Club,<br/>
<br/>
I somehow didn&#39;t receive a few digests so I didn&#39;t catch exactly who&#39;s coming <br/>
to the Sacramento conference.  Just references to people improperly named!  <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
So how about this?  Let&#39;s meet at the pool at about 5:15 on Saturday.  If <br/>
some people can&#39;t stay long, we could at least try to come up with another time <br/>
and place there.<br/>
<br/>
Pam T., hoping to actually get to see your replies this time<br/>
<br/>
