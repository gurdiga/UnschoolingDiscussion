&lt;&lt; Socratic method is the &quot;humiliate the student&quot; method of teaching<br/>
<br/>
law,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in Paper Chase it was portrayed that way, but in pure form it is NOT a <br/>
&quot;humiliate the student&quot; method.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Practitioners of them would say that any other teaching method is<br/>
<br/>
watered down instruction and that if you don&#39;t want the degree<br/>
<br/>
badly enough to endure the humiliation, you shouldn&#39;t be there in<br/>
<br/>
the first place.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
Socratic method (the term) came from the drawing out of a student toward a <br/>
truth by asking him questions designed to help him come to a certain realization.<br/>
<br/>
More modern useage (more general application) don&#39;t necessarily aim for one <br/>
single answer, as Socrates himself seemed to be doing, at least according to <br/>
what some of his students reported.<br/>
<br/>
If we ask someone a question knowing that their thinking through their answer <br/>
will lead to greater understanding for them and in them than they would have <br/>
if we just recited an answer to them and expected them to get it, then we&#39;re <br/>
using &quot;Socratic method.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;How will my child understand percentages without workbooks?&quot; <br/>
someone might say &quot;When did you really understand percentages?&quot;  They&#39;ll be <br/>
hoping, probably, that the answer will involve some real-world application or <br/>
need, and they&#39;ll probably be right.  So rather than say &quot;Many don&#39;t understand <br/>
it until they have a real-world need,&quot; they set up a situation in which they <br/>
ask the other to think back to personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
A longer dialog where more questions are asked like &quot;Why would someone want <br/>
to do that anyway?&quot;  &quot;What WOULD you do if he didn&#39;t?&quot;  &quot;What&#39;s the worst that <br/>
can happen?&quot;  &quot;What is the purpose for it, ultimately?&quot; can be leading someone <br/>
toward a pre-thought goal.   In a one-on-one (as Socrates worked often) or in <br/>
a voluntary exchange like this, why would there be any risk of humiliation?  <br/>
We&#39;re not calling on anyone to state their answers to those questions.  Some <br/>
voluntarily do, and some just think it to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Socratic method isn&#39;t an oral exam.  It&#39;s dialog which draws a person toward <br/>
a realization.  Not all questions are &quot;Socratic.&quot;  If the answer is a matter <br/>
of simple fact, that&#39;s a whole different thing.  If the question is designed to <br/>
trick a respondent (as interrogations before or in courtroom situations <br/>
sometimes are), that has nothing to do with Socratic method.   <br/>
<br/>
If the questions have to do with helping a person clarify his ideas and <br/>
beliefs, then that&#39;s &quot;Socratic,&quot; and why is that humiliating?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075272680">We&#39;re going on a &quot;baseball&quot; trip around New England going to various minor<br/>
and major league teams. Well, Carl and Kathryn are doing the baseball, I&#39;m<br/>
going along for the other stuff. So far we&#39;ve got Lipizzan stallions,<br/>
Vermont Teddy Bear Factory and Ben and Jerry&#39;s factory.<br/>

We&#39;ll be in Montreal for a couple of days and perhaps Quebec depending on<br/>
what there is we&#39;d like to see. They&#39;ll be going to an Expos game and we&#39;re<br/>
going to the Mosaicultures exhibit. Is there anything else unique and kid<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029063647">For any who are interested, here&#39;s something the moderator of RUL did and<br/>
posted on RUL. -- Joyce (Unschooling-Discussion moderator)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi, all<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are a lot of lingering issues concerning the discussion dynamics at<br/>
&gt; Unschooling.com&#39;s Discussion list.  These issues have been inappropriately<br/>
&gt; taken to RUL (Radical Unschooling List).  It is my understanding that<br/>
&gt; meta-discussion is not encouraged on the actual Unschooling-Discussion List.<br/>
&gt; So, I have created a private, quick-topic message board<br/>
&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.quicktopic.com/22/H/jFAwwus29ND)">http://www.quicktopic.com/22/H/jFAwwus29ND)</a> for all interested individuals to<br/>
&gt; further discuss the issues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joyce, you may want to alert your members of this board.  Let me know your<br/>
&gt; feelings about the creation of this board.  I know you&#39;ve already stated your<br/>
&gt; list&#39;s mission, so I don&#39;t know if this new board will be anything more than a<br/>
&gt; venting platform.  Perhaps it&#39;s necessary for that purpose?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone can &quot;subscribe&quot; to this board so that you get all new messages sent to<br/>
&gt; you via email.  This board is not to replace any unschooling email list.  It<br/>
&gt; serves only to discuss unschooling.com&#39;s discussion dynamics.  It will be<br/>
&gt; deleted when this service is no longer needed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not moderating this new board--no one is.  Use this space to come to a<br/>
&gt; resolution, a truce, or at least a better understanding of the opposing<br/>
&gt; viewpoints.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a Jr. High slam book.<br/>
<br/>
Are there &quot;opposing viewpoints&quot; to unschooling discussions?  I could find <br/>
lots of people in my own neighborhood or town to say I should put my kids in <br/>
school and they won&#39;t learn to read on their own.  Bummer is, they DID learn to <br/>
read on their own, and Kirby&#39;s turning 17 today, never having been to school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not interested in discussing discussions of discussions, and I&#39;m not too <br/>
interested in a semi-permanent home for the petty lies being spread about me <br/>
by women who should grow up.<br/>
<br/>
Why would one discussion list create a side discussion about a DIFFERENT <br/>
discussion list?<br/>
<br/>
I lived through seventh grade once.  My kids never have experienced any of <br/>
that nonsense.  Those who need to live it again might want to consider a <br/>
therapist instead of &quot;a venting platform.&quot;<br/>

list who apparently responded to Joyce&#39;s defense of this list, it seems.  One day <br/>
last week I read lots of things from the other list, but haven&#39;t seen <br/>
anything lately.  I thught they were through discussing this list.    Anyway, this <br/>
was interesting like a train wreck:<br/>

&gt;well the niche it&#39;s trying to reach. What&#39;s unfortunate is that people<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t know beforehand what niche the Unschooling-Discussion list serves<br/>
&gt;and are understandably upset when the list isn&#39;t what they expected. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;apologized for that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=-So, ethically speaking, any list which satisfied its members need not<br/>
defend (or justify) itself?  If the Nazi party has a list (I&#39;m using an<br/>
extreme example to make a point, not to say that you&#39;re nazi-like)-<br/>
and its members are very happy with it, you don&#39;t see a problem with what<br/>
it&#39;s promoting?<br/>
<br/>
-=-If &quot;your&quot; list thinks it promotes &quot;a&quot;, but because of the methods used it<br/>
might actually promote &quot;b&quot;  (where &quot;b&quot; is in some way quite the  opposite<br/>
of &quot;a&quot;) - isn&#39;t that something worth pondering??<br/>
<br/>
-=-R.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why would someone join a Nazi list?<br/>
If someone joined one knowing it was, why would they complain?<br/>
If they DID see a problem with what it was promoting, would they drop off or <br/>
go to another list and badmouth that list?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And back to the shaky analogy to this list, if what this list promotes is <br/>
unschooling, and someone doesn&#39;t see a problem with unschooling, then...<br/>
<br/>
-=-If &quot;your&quot; list thinks it promotes &quot;a&quot;, but because of the methods used it<br/>
might actually promote &quot;b&quot;  (where &quot;b&quot; is in some way quite the  opposite<br/>
of &quot;a&quot;) - isn&#39;t cal.<br/>
It&#39;s not worth pondering something that doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying not even to ponder why people would bother to focus on a list <br/>
they&#39;re not on that reminds them (even a little) of Nazis.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a pretty nice day here, all my kids are home and happy and busy and it&#39;s <br/>
not as hot as it&#39;s been being, which is great.  I hope it will rain.  I just <br/>
got back from taking a friend home from an urgent care center.  Food poisoning <br/>
from leftover fajitas.  Don&#39;t let this happen to you!  Refrigerate!  He <br/>
looked like hell, poor guy, and slept all the way to his house and could hardly get <br/>
up the steps.   Unscheduled activity, but so it goes.<br/>

&gt; I just<br/>
&gt; got back from taking a friend home from an urgent care center.  Food <br/>
&gt; poisoning<br/>
&gt; from leftover fajitas.  Don&#39;t let this happen to you!  Refrigerate!  He<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oooh spooky &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Its a nice day here too in Southern California - kind of near the coast <br/>
- cooled off a little. Rained last night and we had an unusual and <br/>
beautiful lightening/thunder storm last night. I&#39;m picking up a friend <br/>
from the hospital today. We finished eating a breakfast of leftover <br/>
fajitas so I don&#39;t have to worry about refrigerating that.<br/>
<br/>
Roya (18) is traveling around the country by bus, train, ferry, and <br/>
airplane visiting unschooling friends - I miss her but she&#39;s having a <br/>
great experience and I am so GLAD for cell phones and weblogs - this <br/>
kind of thing would have been harder on me if it had been 10 years ago <br/>
when long distance phone calls were expensive and so on. Other <br/>
daughters are here and we&#39;re doing stuff together and happy and life is <br/>
good!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and I&#39;ve been doing ChangeOne diet plan and going to Curves - for <br/>
3 months and today I got weighed and measured and I&#39;ve lost 27 pounds <br/>
and umpteen inches and I feel better than I have in a long time, <br/>
physically. I bought some new clothes at our county fair - and they <br/>
were clothes I&#39;d thought about buying at last year&#39;s fair but they are <br/>
one-size-fits-all and those NEVER fit me before. You&#39;ll see them at the <br/>
conferences!!! I bought a deep purple dress and I&#39;m told I need a red <br/>
hat to go with it - we&#39;ll see!<br/>
<br/>
My house is messy and we have ants. Soccer starts next week and it just <br/>
seems like we didn&#39;t get much break from it at all. My husband is a <br/>
coach - in fact he is the &quot;chief coach&quot; for the under-14 yo girls <br/>
teams. Rosie has been riding horses for 3 years now and is just as into <br/>
it as ever she was, if not more, and that takes a LOT of time. Roxana <br/>
just finished a production of Les Miserables which was fantastic and is <br/>
going to audition to be in Grease at the local community college - <br/>
she&#39;s singing &quot;Stand Back, Buenos Aires&quot; as an audition piece so I have <br/>
that pretty constantly playing in the back of my head. Rox and Rosie <br/>
are both in Midsummer Night Dream in a couple of weeks - I&#39;ll be at the <br/>
Sacramento and South Carolina conferences when they are performing - <br/>
bad timing! Rosie will be with me in Sacramento but not in S. Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
Our homeschooling group is the best it has ever been - I really really <br/>
enjoy all the people and we have great diversity and wonderful kids and <br/>
adults. I&#39;m feeling really satisfied and lucky.<br/>
<br/>
It is especially good because after my mom died last October I really <br/>
went into a bad depression and I&#39;d have never believed that 8 months <br/>
later I could feel so good again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been EXTREMELY amazed to see how much my own state of mind <br/>
influenced my kids - how much happier they are too, now that I&#39;m okay <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
So - that was a big dump of a lot of stuff.<br/>

said. Because there are so many of you, it gets to looking like you <br/>
went there in a pack to pick on some poor defenseless sweet person.<br/>
<br/>
Leave her to the other list - let them figure out their own way to work <br/>
things out.<br/>
<br/>
I mean - instead of having to start another list to talk about this - <br/>
which seems pointless OTHER than to move the contentiousness off the <br/>
existing lists - how about you all be the ones to let others have the <br/>
last word. It is hard to believe at the moment (believe me I KNOW <br/>
this), but giving someone the last word doesn&#39;t mean people hear them <br/>
and not you.<br/>
<br/>
So how about you all say thanks for being given the opportunity to <br/>
explain how you see things and that you appreciate that that list was <br/>
open to it - and that you realize that they&#39;d like to move on to other <br/>
content and you&#39;ll honor that? It would be the right thing to do, imo. <br/>
Stay and talk about unschooling there - or whatever the topic goes to <br/>
(they aren&#39;t quite as focused on unschooling as we are here, it seems) <br/>
- but how about showing what wonderful insightful generous kind <br/>
intelligent women you are by conversing about other subjects and <br/>
dropping this one, ignoring any further comments about it no matter how <br/>
incendiary - so far the observers on the list don&#39;t have any way to <br/>
really know the real you.<br/>

I didn&#39;t know it was still going.<br/>
It should&#39;ve stopped already. <br/>
I thought they made another list to MAKE it stop, but I don&#39;t think there <br/>
should be another list.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling!  Let&#39;s talk about that.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s birthday party was bigger than anybody expected.  The kids were 12 to <br/>
24ish, and they&#39;re getting old enough to bring dates, and so I think (haven&#39;t <br/>
counted a final count) there were 35, and four parentals/food prep.   There <br/>
are still a dozen up there, and it&#39;s nearly 11:00.  Some are spending the <br/>
night.  I think the Los Alamos contingent is leaving at 11:00 because they have a <br/>
nearly two hours drive.   When it&#39;s down to four or so male people they&#39;ll <br/>
probably head for the new X-Box.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I posted lightly after Pam had posted asking people to cease and <br/>
desist.  Pam&#39;s right, and my humor probably fell like a rock anyway.<br/>
<br/>
There are still cookies up there, but all the turkey and meatballs and <br/>
broccoli and cauliflower are gone, even though we had refills on that.  <br/>
Cheese--GONE.  Chips, still there.  <br/>

posting.  Then we are told to take it to &quot;another room.&quot;  Detention <br/>

slightly away from you, so my whole point was to try to ease a little <br/>

Seventeen.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the guests were older, talking about college and jobs.<br/>
One I&#39;d never met before, with some of the anime guys, was also homeschooled <br/>
and we talked about his having taken the GED cold, which is what I&#39;m <br/>
recommending to Kirby--just take it and see how you do, and then take it again after <br/>
however much time passes.   It would be cool to see how well he could do totally <br/>
flat footed.  I liked the new guy.  Gabe.   He has an artsy haircut so I made <br/>
sure to introduce him to Holly.  He did his own hair too.  It&#39;s not as wild <br/>
as Holly&#39;s but has two longer points in the front, and has red highlights.  <br/>
<br/>
It was a really nice party.  Still is, for the eight or ten still stomping <br/>

<br/>
I saw that.  I LOVED that. &lt;g&gt;  Pretty funny, under the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they should pick on Joyce.  How tacky.  Joyce works hard to <br/>
make the list good, and she&#39;s WAY more patient than necessary, and the list is <br/>
extremely more accommodating than some other lists are.<br/>
<br/>
Once at the church I attended when I was a teenager a woman stood up to <br/>
testify, right in the middle of the sermon, right in the middle of a word.  It <br/>
wasn&#39;t that kind of a church, but more than that, maybe some of the adults there <br/>
knew her (I didn&#39;t) and she hadn&#39;t gotten fifteen words out before a couple of <br/>
deacons were politely ushering her out.   It&#39;s always a judgment call, but if <br/>
they had just let her go on with whatever she was saying, some people would <br/>
have been unhappy and some people were unhappy that she wasn&#39;t allowed to speak <br/>
as the spirit moved her.<br/>
<br/>
The spirit moves some people to go on and on at the wrong time, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean everyone else is obligated to sit back and say amen.<br/>
