<div id="ygrps-yiv-42432900">anthing by Robert Kiyosaki?<br/>
<br/>
If you can get a copy of his book, &quot;If You Want to be Rich and Happy, Don&#39;t Go to School&quot; - I would highly highly recommend it.  It deals with the programming that school (and society/family etc...) gives you.  Actually, if you can devour any of his books I&#39;d suggest it!  His books are usually financially geared, but they are very interesting and deal with the mindset that we are programmed with from school.  His book &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; is excellent as well and shows the difference between his biological father (&quot;Poor Dad&quot;) who was a public school teacher, etc... and his best friend&#39;s dad and his financial mentor (&quot;Rich Dad&quot;) who did not have the education his biological father had.  <br/>
