<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293178024">The buildings they are in use recycled air.  The floor coverings they use<br/>
have formaldehyde in them.  The partical board they use to build the shelves<br/>
have formadehyde in them.  The counters have formadehyde in them.  They buy<br/>
whole trainloads of things which either have already been or they warehouse<br/>
with tons of chemicals that are meant to keep moths, mould and critters out.<br/>
<br/>
Unless they have changed, they are printed receipts using therma-print which<br/>
off-gasses.  They are one of the few places left that use the old type<br/>
chemicals for cleaning.<br/>

What you have is a chemical bomb just waiting to happen to folks that are<br/>
even slightly allergic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-939701618">But eventually it has to start hitting their bottom line.  I mean I <br/>
don&#39;t go there unless I have no other option.  In other words, when I <br/>
need cheap fabric, I go there.  Otherwise, I try to stick to Target, <br/>
K-mart and many other smaller stores.  <br/>
I&#39;m also on a shop locally kick, so I patronize a lot of really small <br/>
local places like the grocery store up the street that is straight <br/>
from the fifties and the pharmacy with a working soda fountain down <br/>
the street the other way.<br/>
