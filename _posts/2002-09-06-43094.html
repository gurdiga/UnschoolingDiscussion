&lt;&lt; You sound like a pretty cool bunch.  Are there no Christian<br/>
 unschoolers on the list though? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Helen.<br/>
I think the Christians that are regulars here are of strong constitiution and <br/>
at least understand the downfalls of the religion in general.<br/>
I consider myself Christian in that I am a follower of Christ. But I don&#39;t <br/>
adhere to any other rigid Christian ideals, so maybe I am disqualified? :)<br/>
Don&#39;t believe that Christ was God, don&#39;t believe in the Trinity and so <br/>
on.....so maybe I&#39;m just a &quot;Follower of Christ&quot; and not a Christian?<br/>
Anyway, we&#39;re a fairly tolerant, liberal bunch all in all. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fortunately, my dh is right on board with the unschooling, and really,<br/>
really REALLY happy about the homeschooling in general. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That is really great!!! You are very fortunate.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;There are some things, however, that we do that I think may &#39;disqualify&#39; us.<br/>
I have set up a room here in our house, which has lots of math<br/>
manipulatives, language materials, geography stuff - all kinds of things -<br/>
set out on shelves for her.  My husband started calling it &#39;the classroom&#39;<br/>
and that name has stuck. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that disqualifies you at all!!!  That is just a resource room, <br/>
a place to curl up with a book maybe?  Or find some reference material when <br/>
needed.<br/>
Sounds cool.<br/>
But I think I&#39;d try to drop the &quot;classroom&quot; title.<br/>
Just to get the kids thinking outside the box of school, since they have been <br/>
in school.<br/>
Just make it a fun room, full of art supplies, collections and nature <br/>
stuff...along with all your books and reference material.<br/>
You don&#39;t need lessons, you don&#39;t need a classroom, you don&#39;t need curriculum.<br/>
But it sounds like you already know that. Enjoy the room. We used to have one <br/>
just like it. That in itself could certainly not make you NOT an unschooler.  <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;  There is a definite influence there, though, and again, I<br/>
wonder if that &#39;disqualifies&#39; me as an unschooler.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that you recognize how being a teacher could get in the <br/>
way of joyful unschooling!  It sounds like your&#39;e on the right track.  The <br/>
main thing is honoring her interests and requests.<br/>
If your &quot;teacherishness&quot; gets in the way, it just means it&#39;s time for some <br/>
probing and thinking about how to get away from that. Being aware is the most <br/>
important thing.<br/>
Most all of us have had to deal with some kind of schoolish baggage....that&#39;s <br/>
not the end of the world.  Being aware of my baggage was the most important <br/>
step in trying to change.<br/>
I think you&#39;re going to like it here. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838045937">Hi. I am a Christian. I believe in the trinity. I don&#39;t debate my<br/>
faith.. But, I believe in what Christ taught about love and<br/>
Christianity. I am very caring when it comes to other peoples views and<br/>
faiths. I teach my children Religion as well as teaching them about<br/>
Christ. I don&#39;t condem anyone for there choice of religion or no<br/>
religion. I was raised in the United Methodist Church but, turned away<br/>
when they decided to turn against gays. I didn&#39;t against Christ. I guess<br/>
I am very liberal. I have four children. Now days I tend to lean more to<br/>
the UU church. I have learned a lot about other religions and<br/>
Christianity from my father. Who left being an ordained Methodist<br/>
Minister for the same reasons I sited. Take Care, Diana<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422943144">To be truthful I don&#39;t know. My father left the ministry because they<br/>
were opposed of having a gay minister in their conference. Even though<br/>
he was a brillant minister. I doubt if I will ever go back...but, if<br/>
they keep opening doors maybe some day I will. Take care, Diana<br/>
