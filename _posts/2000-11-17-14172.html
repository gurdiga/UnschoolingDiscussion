From: The Internet TourBus - A virtual tour of cyberspace<br/>
[mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:TOURBUS@...">TOURBUS@...</a>] On Behalf Of Patrick Douglas Crispen<br/>
<br/>
Encouraged by the &quot;don&#39;t be a fool, stay in school&quot; commercials, I can<br/>
honestly say that college was the best 13 years of my life.  And as an<br/>
expert in registration and drop/add, I&#39;m here to tell you that if you<br/>
or someone you know is thinking about attending college next Fall, NOW<br/>
IS THE TIME TO START APPLYING FOR ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where today&#39;s TOURBUS stop comes in.  The Embark home page at<br/>
<br/>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.embark.com/&quot;">http://www.embark.com/&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.embark.com/">http://www.embark.com/</a> &lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
is a free, one-stop, higher educational portal that helps you find a<br/>
US community college, technical program, four-year college or<br/>
university, or graduate school that is right for you.<br/>
<br/>
The Embark home page has four main sections: undergraduate schools;<br/>
business schools (MBA or executive education programs); international<br/>
students; and graduate schools.  Click on the appropriate section and<br/>
you are taken to a page that shows you the five steps you need to<br/>
follow to become a professional college student like me:<br/>
<br/>
     1. Research<br/>
     2. Prepare<br/>
     3. Apply<br/>
     4. Finance<br/>
     5. Get Ready<br/>
<br/>
This is where Embark shines.  The wealth of information that Embark<br/>
offers in each of these steps is stunning.  For example, in step one<br/>
(Research), Embark has a tool called &quot;Matchmaker.&quot;   By asking you a<br/>
series of questions about where you are interested in attending<br/>
college, what type of program of study interests you, and so on,<br/>
Matchmaker helps you find a college or group of colleges that is<br/>
specifically suited to you and your interests.<br/>
<br/>
Cool, huh?  And the Matchmaker is just ONE of the tools available in<br/>
the Research section!<br/>
<br/>
Once you have found school or group of schools that interests you, the<br/>
next step is to prepare for and take the college entrance<br/>
examinations.  Embark&#39;s &quot;Prepare&quot; section gives you free practice<br/>
tests for the SAT, ACT, GMAT, and GRE.  The site also explains how<br/>
each test works and tells you where you can turn for test prep<br/>
tutorials and classes.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have taken the entrance exams, the next step is to fill out<br/>
an admissions application (step three: Apply).  Through Embark you<br/>
can apply to a BUNCH of colleges online and Embark&#39;s Apply section<br/>
gives you advice and information on how to improve your chance of<br/>
admission, how to write an admissions essay, and how to survive a<br/>
college interview.<br/>
<br/>
Since a lot of parents ride our little bus of Internet happiness, I<br/>
have a feeling that the next section will probably be the most<br/>
popular: Step four: Finance.  In the Finance section you can get<br/>
advice and information on how to pay for college, use tools to help<br/>
you find and apply for college loans, search and apply for<br/>
scholarships, and even find out how to manage what little money you&#39;ll<br/>
have left after the bursar&#39;s office gets done with you.<br/>
<br/>
The final section, &quot;Get Ready,&quot; gives you advice and information to<br/>
help you gear up for college, including how to save money when you buy<br/>
your textbooks, how to choose a computer, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Embark is *NOT* perfect.  For example, Embark&#39;s Matchmaker doesn&#39;t<br/>
include every school in the US, so its results may exclude some<br/>
schools that might be a better match for you.  Because of this, I<br/>
can&#39;t recommend that you use Embark as the sole tool you use in<br/>
determining which college to attend.  However, Embark is an AMAZING<br/>
site, it has a wealth of information, and it is a wonderful place to<br/>
START researching and preparing for your new college career.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and yes, it did indeed take me 13 years to get my bachelors<br/>
degree.  But, if it is any consolation, I will receive my masters<br/>
degree in 13 months.  Now if only I could find a 13-week PhD program,<br/>
the symmetry will be complete.  :)</div>
