<p>Welcome back, Potter. 
<p>The Durham District School Board last night announced there no longer is a 
restriction on the use of the popular Harry Potter children&#39;s books in the 
region&#39;s classrooms. 
<p>The Durham school system, once acknowledged as one of the 
best school systems in the world, has received unwelcome worldwide attention in 
recent weeks over its decision to prohibit the use of the book in classes where 
at least one parent objected to its use. 
<p>Last night, education director Grant Yeo, simply told trustees parental 
permission no longer will be sought before the series of four books by British 
author J. K Rowling can be used in the region&#39;s public school classrooms. The 
decision was made by school board administrators yesterday. 
<p>About 150 people filled the board room, booing and cheering alternately 
depending on the speakers&#39; views. Most in the crowd seemed to support the 
restrictions. 
<p>Many left before the board actually voted to drop the restrictions. 
<p>Parents who object to the Potter books must file a written complaint with 
their local school under the board&#39;s existing learning materials selection 
policy. 
<p>It will then be up to each school principal to decide if the books are to be 
used. 
<p>If a school decides to go ahead and use the Potter series in the classroom 
and parents still are unhappy, their children can be given ``alternative 
studies,&#39;&#39; which in most cases will be another book, said program superintendent 
Bev Freedman. 
<p>She had said earlier this month she was aware of about 20 telephone 
complaints and about 10 letters from parents objecting to the use of the books 
at various Durham Region schools. 
<p>Trustees last night heard emotional pleas from 16 parents on both sides of 
the Harry Potter controversy. 
<p>But they later endorsed the action to remove the restrictions by a vote of 
7-4. 
<p>Dianne Kelly of Whitby said she couldn&#39;t understand how any school board 
could even consider ``banning&#39;&#39; a book in the year 2000. 
<p>``In a time when there is so much competition for children&#39;s attention, these 
books are encouraging them to read in a way few other books have,&#39;&#39; she said in 
an interview. ``I&#39;ve read them all and they are a lot of fun.&#39;&#39; 
<p>But David Castell of Oshawa said his 12-year-old son Kyle stands a chance of 
being ostracized by the rest of his class if he chooses not to take part in a 
coming study of a Harry Potter book with his Grade 7 classmates at Kedron public 
school. 
<p>``My son decided of his own volition this book wasn&#39;t for him. 
<p>``I can&#39;t understand why in a democratic society a school board would allow 
this sort of thing to happen.&#39;&#39; 
<p>The board directive was sent out last April after a dozen parents and one 
Oshawa school trustee claimed the four books in the series glorified witchcraft. 

<p>The books describe the adventures of orphan Harry Potter who goes to the 
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
<p>Potter finds a new life and much respect by becoming a wizard. He uses his 
new powers to help others and to fight evil. 
<p>Oshawa school trustee Jane Weist, who first raised the matter at a board 
meeting last spring, still believes the book should be restricted in the 
region&#39;s schools. 
<p>``As far as I am concerned the books teach witchcraft and putting it in such 
a nice little story about a little boy simply puts a sugar coating on it.&#39;&#39; 
<p>She said with the restriction removed, parents who do not want their children 
exposed to Harry Potter will have to ask their children to stand out in the hall 
while it is being discussed. 
<p>Durham board Chair Doug Ross said it was never the intention of the board to 
ban the books or place such a strong restriction on their use. 
<p>``If it was going to cause a war with parents and half of the kids wouldn&#39;t 
be attending, then common sense would tell the teacher or principal to use 
another book in class.&#39;&#39; </p></font></div>
