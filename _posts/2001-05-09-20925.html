<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971209117">I think 4yods needs more time with me.  He spends all day outside <br/>
with his friends - I need to take care of 1 1/2yodd.  I do spend as <br/>
much time as I can outside with dd.  When I go inside to take care of <br/>
dd, he runs off where I can&#39;t see him and don&#39;t know where he is.  <br/>
His behavior is getting worse - becoming more and more aggressive.  I <br/>
would like to have a time where I can spend with him alone, but most <br/>
days, that&#39;s impossible without neglecting his sister.  During her <br/>
naptime (whenever she falls asleep), he is usually playing outside <br/>
with his friends.  I can play with him, though his friends don&#39;t <br/>
appreciate it, but I feel we do need some time alone, just the two of <br/>
us.  I also worry about him playing where I can&#39;t see him for safety <br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, is this just a stage I should let him be?  He&#39;s only started <br/>
this since the weather got warm enough to be outside.  The more time <br/>
he spends with his friends, the more aggressive he gets.  Should I <br/>
limit his time with his friends??<br/>
<br/>
I kind of wish one of you experienced unschooling parents would come <br/>
over and show me how it&#39;s done.  But I guess I&#39;ll just have to settle <br/>
for asking a million questions.  Often I can trust my feelings and <br/>
judgement, but sometimes, I don&#39;t know what my feelings are...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16585911">Maybe try to get him to come in during nap time and sit him in your lap &<br/>
read to him. He may need that extra contact with you. That seems to have<br/>
worked for me when my now 7 year old was 4 & I had his brother who was about<br/>
6 months then. Mine didn&#39;t nap easily either but I tried to stop whatever<br/>
else I was doing when it did happen because he was one that needed that<br/>
extra bit of attention.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369763959">Maybe offer him a treat to start, something he really likes.I think that he<br/>
might be avoiding you like that to deal with his jealousy. My 7 year old<br/>
still will withdraw & it&#39;s almost like pulling teeth to find out what&#39;s<br/>
bothering him. He will get involved in anything to avoid his insecurities.<br/>
But once you get through he is very loving. My boys don&#39;t have friends<br/>
around during the day because others are in school or daycare in our<br/>
neighborhood. But if I notice them acting more aggressive or any other<br/>
behavior that is out of their usual character I do limit their playing with<br/>
others for a day or so. After all ,the aggression is part of the problem of<br/>
the school systems that I want to avoid. He may then get to realize that his<br/>
sister is getting old enough to play with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480614747">I think my ds was a little older when this came up and he doesn&#39;t have any siblings but when he started to have playdates and really spend time with his friends his behavior towards me was sometimes quite nasty. I talked it over with several moms and found that this was not uncommon. And we all agreed that we just don&#39;t accept that kind of behavior. So no being patient or understanding, the behavior was not acceptable and we went from there. And now he is much better about making the transition from playing with his buds and then coming back into the family.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re probably also right in that he needs some time and attention - good luck! And, of course, take what you like and leave the rest  :o)<br/>

children.  I would arrange a play date with some children I approved <br/>
of, and either he would go to their house, or them to our house.  He <br/>
is now 10.  Last summer, I did allow him more freedom to play <br/>
outside and be around neighborhood kids.  But he never stayed out <br/>
with them very long.  Some of them would come to our door and <br/>
ask if he could play.  He&#39;d be standing to the side whispering &quot;tell <br/>
them to go away.&quot;  They were too rough, didn&#39;t play fair, were <br/>
always fighting about something stupid, and stealing his things.  I <br/>
had to go down to their house more than once to get back <br/>
something that belonged to him.  He just didn&#39;t enjoy being around <br/>
them because of their bad behavior.  He always learned to play <br/>
nice, with kids whose parents made sure they learned manners.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525473292">Seems to me the friends need to go home.  You need to be able to see where <br/>
the 4 yo is at all times.  And too much of a good thing has gotten out of <br/>
hand.  And he needs down time, spent partly with you and partly by himself.  <br/>
<br/>
Quiet is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
An unattended 4 yo is not a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents.<br/>
