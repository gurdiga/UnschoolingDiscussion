&lt;&lt; Housekeeping is NEVER my forte - I HATE it. I&#39;d like to figure out how <br/>
to do it with all that wonderful calm joyful attitude that people here <br/>
talk about it - but to me it is boring boring boring and more boring. <br/>
When I&#39;m not feeling great, too, I just can&#39;t make myself do much of it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to do so much of it, just a little.<br/>
I mean if you wanted to practice the attitude.  <br/>
<br/>
Put on music you can sing along to and that will make you feel like dancing, <br/>
and it makes the time go by more happily.  Or plan a presentation in your <br/>
head, or be making a list for something (have the paper and pencil there, but <br/>
work cleaning whatever until you think of another item.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I do, anyway, is I do two things at once and the housework is the <br/>
mindless one.<br/>
<br/>
I used to HATE the resentment of &quot;Why should *I* do this?&quot; and so I just <br/>
decided to change what I thought about what &quot;this&quot; was and why anyone had to <br/>
do it.  It was a philosophical shift.  But I still like to play music.<br/>
<br/>
Floors, I don&#39;t like.  I need to really steam clean the carpet in the <br/>
library, but it would involve putting so many things up I can&#39;t think of <br/>
doing it.  But when it gets springlike I&#39;ll ask the kids to help me get the <br/>
floor clear, and open the doors and windows up there and just DO it.  It will <br/>
kill a whole day but I&#39;ll play loud music and sing and get it done.  And <br/>
we&#39;ll all be happier for a while, in that room.  Other teens have taken to <br/>
coming and gaming there a couple of times a week, and it&#39;s still a dormitory <br/>
when necessary (concerts and SCA events bring relatives and friends from <br/>
outlying towns), and the kids feel as much ownership and need of that as they <br/>
do their own rooms, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never have a really spiffy, decorated house.  But I have figured out <br/>
ways to accept that instead of berating myself, and ways to be happier when I <br/>
DO declutter and clean.<br/>
