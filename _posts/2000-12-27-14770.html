<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Read Nicki and David Colfaxes book about their<br/>
&gt; homesteading experience. They couldn&#39;t have done it if<br/>
&gt; the kids didn&#39;t help in some way.  So depending on how<br/>
&gt; old your kids are (mine are still quite young) find<br/>
&gt; out what they would like to do to help.  Some things<br/>
&gt; that come to mind for me is:  read about<br/>
&gt; permaculture/natural gardening as a family, ask the<br/>
&gt; kids for help, make a list of the things to do in a<br/>
&gt; garden then everyone helps do what they would most<br/>
&gt; enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has anyone any experience of coming to this sort of lifestyle when the kids<br/>
are already older (17, 13, 10) and have already developed interests in<br/>
indoor, city things? The 13yo is kind of interested, the 17yo helps with<br/>
building the house, the 10 isn&#39;t interested at all - and is the most needy.<br/>
Is it too late to inspire them? I guess that&#39;s a silly question, as I have<br/>
come to it older than they are. But it&#39;s frustrating &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Look for permaculture groups  in your area or start<br/>
&gt; one and let them come over to your place and get lots<br/>
&gt; of hands on experience.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are gradually getting a small support network going with a handful of<br/>
people, mostly just starting out like us. There is another group of<br/>
permaculturists around here, but they all got into it at the same time, did<br/>
a PDC together, and although they are friendly enough on a casual basis,<br/>
they have their support network up and running among themselves and don&#39;t<br/>
seem particularly interested in expanding to include new  comers :-(<br/>
<br/>
But as I say, we do have a small group going - and better still, all<br/>
homeschoolers as well! Thought the others are younger than me and have much<br/>
younger children - their oldest children are the same age as my youngest.<br/>
Still, that support is good.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I was just feeling extra frustrated yesterday, as there was only a<br/>
very small &#39;window of opportunity between rainfalls, which is due to<br/>
continue for several more days.<br/>
<br/>
But most of the time I am blissfully happy on our land. :-)<br/>
