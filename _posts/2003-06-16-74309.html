When Kirby brings a new friend over, he introduces them to me and his dad.  <br/>
Just always has.  We do the same. If we have new people over, we introduce the <br/>
kids, and them, and tell them something about each other.<br/>

Yes, she would address the Pope and tell him her dogs name, rather than the <br/>
other way around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will have to think on that more, although my gut reaction is no. But then I <br/>
think about what if I met the President. I mean once any one reaches the <br/>
status of being an United States President, that rank and title stay forever. Yet <br/>
then I pause because I wonder if I truly had access to such a person, would my <br/>
personal biases or distain for particular Presidents change my feeling about <br/>
their rank or title? I will definately think on this portion harder. Does rank <br/>
and title necessarily make one deserved of good manners. i.e. If I were to <br/>
meet Sadam Hussein, the president of Iraq, who I&#39;m pretty sure thinks of himself <br/>
as ranking and worthy of said title, would I be polite or use proper <br/>
etiquette, simply because he holds such? Or would my disdain for the individual <br/>
override the general politeness during introductions.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If not, how you decide how to manage introductions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So at this point having not contemplated further, I can only explain that <br/>
thus far I have managed intros by simply doing them, not basing them on who holds <br/>
a higher social status than another. If I know both parties, yet they do not <br/>
know each other, I would probably choose whoever I knew more as the one to <br/>
introduce first, but not exclusively. <br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>

there one?<br/>
<br/>
Your CEO gave you access.  You couldn&#39;t have taken it without his &gt; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cooperation.  It was his option, because he ranked.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OMG I finally found a statement to disagree with Sandra Dodd on. LOL No ever <br/>
gave me access, I took it as I usually do, if such thing exists.  From day <br/>
one, company policy was everyone was addressed by first name, regardless of <br/>
title. Lucky for me cuz I probably never would taken the job otherwise. But for <br/>
some reason when it came to the CEO & CIO, everyone called them Mr. Surname. Well <br/>
that just wasn&#39;t my thing, so I called them by their first names just as they <br/>
would call me by mine. Had they preferred to be called by their surnames, <br/>
several things would have to follow. First, I&#39;d expect to be referred to as Mrs. <br/>
Hill, not Rhonda and secondly I&#39;d expect company policy to change also, in <br/>
writing so that such an infraction would have to be written down somewhere for <br/>
any cause of action to take place. Lastly, I would want clear definitions of <br/>
what ranks them worthy of change in dialogue venue. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, for me, that has to do with something more on a soul/spiritual <br/>
level. For in my view, money never makes one human more worthy of my kindness than <br/>
another. I know this is in general the &quot;American Way&quot;, just not how it works <br/>
for me. Again I will have to dwell on it.<br/>

would share with us, what that sight was. For this I thank you. <br/>

<br/>
Think of a wedding.  Brides rank HUGELY at their own weddings.  If you didn&#39;t <br/>
like her, you wouldn&#39;t be at her wedding.  But during and surrounding <br/>
weddings, brides are like queens.  They get to sit where they want, and what they <br/>
don&#39;t like doesn&#39;t go.<br/>
<br/>
That example came to mind because a friend who is usually very quiet and very <br/>
&quot;non-ranking&quot; in any of MANY different situations I&#39;ve known her in, social <br/>
and professional, was married recently (second marriage, but BIG damned deal) <br/>
and I was a musician.  Musicians rank very low in weddings, and I played my <br/>
part for sure.  When I needed anything, I talked to the maid of honor, and I <br/>
waited as long as it took for an answer.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;there is real rank.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

is <br/>
there one?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Any person who doesn&#39;t know how to find out or figure it out can choose not <br/>
to &quot;follow suit&quot; but will risk paying a social price.  &quot;Follow suite&quot; is a <br/>
ranking term. &lt;g&gt;  How do you decide who to follow?  (Even in cards, there&#39;s a <br/>
heirarchy of card values.  Ace of hearts outranks ace of diamonds.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; No ever gave me access, I took it as I usually do, if such thing exists. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;Had they preferred to be called by their surnames, <br/>
several things would have to follow.....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well... One thing that could have followed would have been you losing your <br/>
job.<br/>
Because people who had the power and authority to let you stay or send you <br/>
away allowed you to take the liberties you chose to take, you were in a safe <br/>
position.  Not because YOUR choices could guarantee it, but because they gave it <br/>
to you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps, for me, that has to do with something more on a soul/spiritual <br/>
level. For in my view, money never makes one human more worthy of my kindness <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I thought this may come up, and is why I stated that company poilcy dictated <br/>
the first name intead of surname or title. Therefore, I could not have been <br/>
fired for such an infraction, since policy in writing supercedes verbal <br/>
precedence, at least in a court of law. And considering a foundation for wrongful <br/>
termination, campanies are much more carefull in this age of litigation. So, in <br/>
this case, I still believe, I was not &quot;given&quot; any liberties, as the policy <br/>
pertained to all individuals working for the company. I simply acted upon the <br/>
policies as was any other employee availed to.<br/>
<br/>
I like the thought of a bride having rank on her wedding day, though. Perhaps <br/>
my quibble is with the word rank, though. My sister and I had a conversation <br/>
just Saturday evening about her wedding should she ever have one. Her concern <br/>
for feelings of betrayal over Matron of Honor/Maid of Honor/Bridesmaids, I <br/>
found so disturbing. My view was it&#39;s her day, her wedding and things are done <br/>
her way, period. That includes me. I&#39;m sure my mom would have a fit if I wasn&#39;t <br/>
Matron of Honor, but<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this to me is one of the major dangers of assuming other people&#39;s &quot;rank&quot;<br/>
or blindly operating on a &quot;rank&quot; system.<br/>
<br/>
I worked in the university world for many years.  And there are few places<br/>
where rank is more important.  You have staff, then undergrads, then grad<br/>
students, then faculty, then administrators.  Although some faculty outrank<br/>
some admins.<br/>
<br/>
BUT if the faculty isn&#39;t in YOUR department, then they rank lower than your<br/>
faculty, even if they are faculty.  And you better stand up to them and say<br/>
no (if neccessary,) even if you are just lowly staff.<br/>
<br/>
I was forever having to point out to people that I worked for the<br/>
university&#39;s LIBRARY and not for the department which our branch happened to<br/>
live in or serve.  AND I was forever having to point out to MY superiors<br/>
that our job was to serve the entire system, not just them or our local<br/>
faculty.<br/>
<br/>
It was a lose/lose situation.  And it sucked royally.  But the reality was<br/>
that none of those people &quot;gave me&quot; the right to fight those fights.  It was<br/>
inherent in doing the JOB correctly.   Serving who we were supposed to serve<br/>
and doing it well.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like in the original example, the whole &quot;rank&quot; issue had<br/>
NOTHING to do with doing the job.  It was part of an assumed hierarchy--like<br/>
parents are assumed to be in charge and thus treated differently.  Someone<br/>
treated the &quot;big&quot; boss like a collegue and confused the hell out of her<br/>
boss.  Much like us treating our children like actual members fo the family<br/>
and not &quot;just the kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

concerned.  As far as the soul/spiritual matters go, I must have missed that part. For <br/>
me there are still no ranks even in that realm. I know that in itself may be <br/>
hard to conceptualize, but that is how I see it.<br/>

    It is as an illogical assumption on your part to make distinctions of <br/>
better or worse the same as acknowledging differences or variation.  There is a <br/>
difference between discernment, and judgement.  You can discern without judging <br/>
something as bad or good, better or worse.   Discerning for yourself what is <br/>
appropriate is not at all the same thing as assigning value.<br/>
