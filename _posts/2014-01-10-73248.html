<div id="ygrps-yiv-138333598">I have nine children: 23, 20, 17, 16, 12, 10, 7, 4 and 1. I just<br/>
learned about Unschooling a few years ago. My two oldest children were<br/>
never homeschooled (the oldest graduated from college last year and<br/>
the second one will graduate next year). My third child went through<br/>
10th grade and then decided she wanted to come home last year. She<br/>
went back to school a few months at the beginning of this year and<br/>
then decided she wanted to come home again. My fourth child went to<br/>
school until third grade and then was homeschooled through sixth. He<br/>
decided he wanted to go to the school for seventh grade where my<br/>
husband teaches and tested into the 8th grade. Now he is in 11th.<br/>
<br/>
I am guilty, especially since I first started reading the Unschooling<br/>
advice of Sandra (and Joyce, Pam S. and Pam L...), of trying to ingest<br/>
as much information as I could without taking a breather. I did not<br/>
take the advice to &quot;read a little, wait a little, watch...&quot;. As a<br/>
result, I do not think our journey into Unschooling has been as smooth<br/>
a transition as it could have been. I have always been an attachment<br/>
parent (family bed, extended breastfeeding, no set bedtimes, food<br/>
available when hungry etc.) so some of the advice has been implemented<br/>
flawlessly. I understand the difference between &quot;principles&quot; and<br/>
&quot;rules&quot;. There are other areas that I really struggle in.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most challenging aspects of our family is having a child<br/>
that goes to a conventional school and children that are home and that<br/>
are free to learn at their own pace and follow their passions. I think<br/>
it is also challenging for my husband because he is a math teach and<br/>
varsity swim coach at that same, very &quot;academically rigorous&quot;, school.<br/>
My husband&#39;s paradigm about learning has been changing as well and I<br/>
think he would like to be working in some other area but that<br/>
opportunity has not materialized yet (even though he has been actively<br/>
looking).<br/>
<br/>
This morning (and it has happened several days in a row), my fourth<br/>
child did not get up in time to go with his father to school (they<br/>
have to leave at 5:30 every morning because varsity swim practice is<br/>
at 6 before school starts). My son is in danger of not getting credit<br/>
for his classes because he is getting close to having missed 10 days.<br/>
I tried to encourage him to go anyway (even if he missed his first<br/>
class) so that he could be marked &quot;present&quot; for the other courses. He<br/>
broke down and said that it was &quot;too late&quot;. I wrote my husband and<br/>
told him that I would be willing to be the &quot;wake up&quot; person (and make<br/>
sure that he has his uniform ready, breakfast etc.) since I know how<br/>
hard it is for my son to get up that early.<br/>
<br/>
My husband wrote me in an email that &quot;...And by the way, if you let<br/>
him go out tonight with friends and not do any work all day long, that<br/>
is horrible parenting; I completely disapprove if that is what is<br/>
going to happen.  It&#39;s time to get a little tough here.&quot; I feel caught<br/>
in between loving, respecting, being gentle with my son and being<br/>
&quot;tough&quot; like my husband feels I should be. At the same time, if my son<br/>
wants to continue going to that school, there are certain rules that<br/>
need to be followed (even if he thinks they are unfair, ludicrous,<br/>
poorly thought out...). I know he feels ambivalent about being there-<br/>
wants to be there for the &quot;social&quot; aspects of school (he is very<br/>
&quot;popular&quot; and is able to mingle with people that are very materially<br/>
wealthy...)- but does not like putting in the &quot;required&quot; academic<br/>
muscle.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure how to navigate this situation in a way that shows that<br/>
I respect and love both my husband and son. I do not know how to help<br/>
keep the peace between my husband and son. My husband interprets my<br/>
son&#39;s &quot;lack of motivation&quot; as a &quot;lack of respect&quot; towards him.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for any advice and thoughts of wisdom. I have benefited<br/>
tremendously from the thoughtful responses on this list and I thank<br/>
you.<br/>

So maybe your husband&#39;s reaction has less to do with a desire for your son to buckle down and has to do with how your son&#39;s behavior and attitude towards school reflects on your husband. Maybe someone at school said something to him. Or the fact that your son is close to failing for non-attendance. That&#39;s not going to go unnoticed by the people your husband works with.</div><div><br></div><div>So your son&#39;s choices are impacting more than just him. What would be easier on your husband is for your son to decide if he&#39;s in or out rather than half in for the social part.</div><div><br></div><div>Have you asked your husband what&#39;s concerning him?</div><div><br></div><div>Joyce</div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472211798">Maybe you could spring for a mediator—someone who knows about unschooling, and parenting, and could let your son explain his feelings to a neutral person who could help interpret.<br/>

<br/>
I agree that if a child IS in school and needs to be up and out early, he should NOT be out with friends the night before.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t a part-time thing.<br/>
