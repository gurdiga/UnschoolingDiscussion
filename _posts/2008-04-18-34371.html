<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735725295">My son doesn&#39;t read books on his own and I&#39;ve been pondering this.  I&#39;m just wondering if <br/>
anyone else&#39;s kids have had a similar pattern and what has happened in the long run.  I <br/>
have no attachment to whether he reads books or not, except that it&#39;s something that <br/>
brings so much enjoyment to my life--I don&#39;t judge books as inherently better than other <br/>
media, for example, just another option amongst many--but an option consistently not <br/>
chosen, so I&#39;m just curiously pondering that.<br/>
<br/>
As background, DS (almost 13) began homeschooling at 7.5.  We were very loose and <br/>
exploring unschooling, and then really went with it by the time he was about 9.  Sometime <br/>
around there he took off with independent reading and blazed through 2 or 3 series like <br/>
The Magic Treehouse books.  Then he read all of the Harry Potter books straight through.  <br/>
That was by about 10.  He hasn&#39;t really picked up a book for pleasure since then.  He gave <br/>
a few a try after HP but nothing compared for him, so he lost interest.  He, of course, <br/>
reads all the time for information.  I have no &quot;concerns&quot; about reading--it&#39;s just more of a <br/>
curiosity about the lack of interest in all the fantastic stories that are out there--it seems <br/>
like there is just a profusion of good stories that fall in line with many of his interests.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I read all the time.  My mother would let me stay home from school to <br/>
finish books because I&#39;d become so wrapped up--I still do, and read all the time.  But <br/>
books are what we had.  So what I&#39;m wondering is has other media filled that need?  There <br/>
are such great stories available now in movies and t.v.--we&#39;ve started renting the seasons <br/>
of good tv series that we hadn&#39;t seen before.  He&#39;s loving MacGuyver!  And I love t.v.--we <br/>
all do--and movies, and...  I&#39;ve been thinking lately about how people just love stories, <br/>
and t.v./movies gives stories life in a different way than books.  They are all different, <br/>
though. Watching t.v. and movies doesn&#39;t make me any less interested in a good book, <br/>
because the experience is different.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to toss this out there and see if others had anything to say.  Thank <br/>
you, Joanna</div>

&gt; in the long run<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, the most helpful thing anyone can do for their kids is accept  <br/>
that they&#39;re all different. Why *should* everyone like to read? Not  <br/>
everyone likes to listen to music. Not everyone even likes ice cream!<br/>
<br/>
Also the preteen years are a time of transition from kid interests to  <br/>
more adult interests. They often do flounder around looking for the  <br/>
right something. Though I suspect what really happens is they get old  <br/>
enough to appreciate what&#39;s available in what interests them. It&#39;s an  <br/>
awkward age and hard for them to find the right mix until they grow  <br/>
into the mix that&#39;s available.<br/>
<br/>
And I think, as you say, we&#39;re generally drawn to stories. Stories  <br/>
have probably existed since there were fires to sit around in the  <br/>
evening ;-) But, even for those parents who are in their 30s, while  <br/>
TV filled a niche in story telling when we were kids, you were at the  <br/>
mercy of the networks of what story you could experience and when. If  <br/>
you wanted a fantasy wednesday night, the only choices were books  <br/>
with a huge variety to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
Now, of course, there&#39;s an explosion in story media and availability.  <br/>
TiVo to watch whenever you want, series to buy, video games, books on  <br/>
tape, even internet dramas :-) And they&#39;re becoming more  <br/>
sophisticated. Though visual media are different from novels -- where  <br/>
you can get inside a character&#39;s head -- the story telling has  <br/>
improved dramatically just in the last 2 decades. I remember a post  <br/>
on a blog that pointed out how simple the stories were -- Twilight  <br/>
Zone not withstanding ;-) -- in weekly series up until the recent  <br/>
decades. The characters were exactly the same from week to week. The  <br/>
only time there were changes were when actors left or a real-life  <br/>
pregnancy had to be written in ;-) And usually the changes didn&#39;t  <br/>
work well because the series were set up to exist in a world where  <br/>
nothing much changed.<br/>
<br/>
When you think about it, only &quot;stupid&quot; housewives were trusted with  <br/>
complex storylines in their soaps ;-) And you can easily pick out the  <br/>
shows where the producers were saying &quot;Trust us, people aren&#39;t as  <br/>
mind numbed as you think!&quot; M*A*S*H*, Dallas (or was there a &quot;night  <br/>
time soap&quot; before that?), Hill Street Blues ...<br/>
<br/>
Slowly it&#39;s shifted to where we *expect* the characters and lives and  <br/>
worlds in most TV shows to change. We&#39;re trusted to keep track of  <br/>
multiple ongoing story lines. While shows may not generally have  <br/>
reached the level of nuanced storytelling of many of the literary  <br/>
classics, they&#39;re certainly as complex as Gone With the Wind. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I remember watching some Japanese imported cartoons back when I was a  <br/>
kid (Kimba, Speed Racer, Star Blazers with no idea they came from  <br/>
Japan) and feeling there was something special about them. I can look  <br/>
back now and see that the writers trusted me to be able to follow an  <br/>
ongoing story line (even if they were dumbed down by the American  <br/>
producers for the stupid American kids ;-) And, goodness, what the  <br/>
Japanese trust *they&#39;re* kids to handle is phenomenal: 300+ Pokemon,  <br/>
hugely complex storylines starting with Dragonball and now the too- <br/>
complex-for-adults Naruto and Bleach.<br/>
<br/>
While visual storytelling may not be for everyone, I suspect it&#39;s  <br/>
more natural than following a story reading. But even so, have there  <br/>
ever been so many books available?<br/>

<br/>
We saw that at our house, too.  One of the reasons I liked Keith  <br/>
better than the guy before him was that guy-before didn&#39;t read, and  <br/>
Keith did.  (I was reminded of that when yesterday I found my notes  <br/>
from the time I was deciding between before-and-Keith.  I read them  <br/>
twice, tore them up and burned them in the hot tub stove.  Some  <br/>
things shouldn&#39;t be read by people&#39;s children.)<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this, a while back, when I had an epiphany about why I had  <br/>
valued books (and band) so much, and why my kids don&#39;t need to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/bookandsax">http://sandradodd.com/bookandsax</a><br/>
<br/>
For me they were escape, privacy, the best way to learn.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have freedom and privacy and learning.<br/>
<br/>
I know kids with all that who still read lots of books, and I knew  <br/>
kids who could&#39;ve used those things and didn&#39;t read books.  There are  <br/>
other factors.  But this seems the big one with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wants to read Snow Angels (we saw the movie) and it&#39;s on  <br/>
order.  She was talking about Stephen King as an example of author- <br/>
within-an-author, which I&#39;m going to add to my art-within-art page   <br/>
along with Kurt Vonnegut/Kilgore Trout.<br/>
<br/>
And now I&#39;m rambling, but all those rambles are samples and examples  <br/>
of why my kids don&#39;t need to have something to do while they&#39;re  <br/>
forced to sit in one place for an hour or six.<br/>

Peyton Place was more like the Vikings showing it could be done and  <br/>
Dallas, et al, were Columbus &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 From Wikipedia<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera</a><br/>
<br/>
The primetime serial<br/>
<br/>
Primetime serials were just as popular as those in daytime. The first  <br/>
real prime time soap opera was ABC&#39;s Peyton Place (1964-1969), based  <br/>
in part on the original 1957 movie (which was itself taken from the  <br/>
1956 novel). The popularity of Peyton Place prompted rival network  <br/>
CBS to spin off popular As the World Turns character Lisa Miller  <br/>
Grimaldi into her own evening soap opera entitled Our Private World  <br/>
(originally titled &quot;The Woman Lisa&quot; in its planning stages) in 1965.  <br/>
Our Private World ended in the fall and the character of Lisa  <br/>
returned to As The World Turns.<br/>
<br/>
The structure of the Peyton Place with its episodic plots and long- <br/>
running story arcs would set the mold for the prime time serials of  <br/>
the 1980s when the format reached its pinnacle.<br/>
<br/>
The successful prime time serials of the 1980s included Dallas,  <br/>
Dynasty, Knots Landing and Falcon Crest. These shows frequently dealt  <br/>
with wealthy families and their personal and big-business travails.  <br/>
Common characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes, the presence  <br/>
of at least one glamorous bitch-figure in the cast of characters, and  <br/>
spectacular disaster cliffhanger situations. Unlike daytime serials  <br/>
which are shot on video in a studio using the multicamera setup,  <br/>
these evening series were shot on film using a single camera setup  <br/>
and featured much location-shot footage, often in picturesque  <br/>
locales. Dallas, its spin-off Knots Landing, and Falcon Crest all  <br/>
initially featured episodes with self-contained stories and specific  <br/>
guest stars who appeared in just that episode. Each story would be  <br/>
completely resolved by the end of the episode and there were no end- <br/>
of-episode cliffhangers. After the first couple of seasons all three  <br/>
shows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera with  <br/>
interwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes. Dynasty  <br/>
featured this format throughout its run.<br/>
<br/>
The soap opera&#39;s distinctive open plot structure and complex  <br/>
continuity also began to be increasingly incorporated into major  <br/>
American prime time television programs. The first significant drama  <br/>
series to do this was Hill Street Blues. This series, produced by  <br/>
Steven Bochco, featured many elements borrowed from soap operas such  <br/>
as an ensemble cast, multi-episode storylines and extensive character  <br/>
development over the course of the series. It and the later Cagney &  <br/>
Lacey overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives  <br/>
exploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the  <br/>
regular characters.[8] The success of these series prompted other  <br/>
drama series and situation comedy shows such as St. Elsewhere to  <br/>
incorporate soap opera style stories and story structure to varying  <br/>
degrees. The legacy continues in more recent series such as The West  <br/>
Wing and Friends.<br/>
<br/>
The prime time soap operas and drama series of the 1990s, such as  <br/>
Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place, and Dawson&#39;s Creek, focused more  <br/>
on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the  <br/>
primetime soap opera format by premiering shows such as Alias,  <br/>
Desperate Housewives, Grey&#39;s Anatomy, and Ugly Betty. These shows  <br/>
managed to appeal to wide audiences not only because of their high  <br/>
melodrama but also because of the humor injected into the scripts and  <br/>
plot lines. In the fall of 2007, many new primetime soaps premiered  <br/>
on U.S. television such as Dirty Sexy Money.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356249374">Then came radio series such as the Lone Ranger?  Families would gather around the radio and listen to stories.  Though those were probably more like a series with each episode had a beginning and an ending. Some did have &quot;To be continued....&quot; at the end and that particular story line would be continued the next time.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the comic books from my childhood (in the 60&#39;s) were serial stories. I guess they still are.  Zachariah likes the old war ones we find at the comic shops - and some Star Wars.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese Manga books Zachariah loves are serial in nature - you have to have the series to have the whole story - One set he has is 30 something books.  The shortest series he has is about 12 books.  I&#39;m not talking about books where the main characters are the same and each book is it&#39;s own story, but a true serial. <br/>
<br/>
I loved the Little House On The Prairie series when I was about 8 - the whole series of books is one long story starting before the Little House On The Prairie book and extending far beyond that book too.  I guess each time the family moved was kind of like an ending to that book - then she wrote about the next place they lived or the next stage of her life.  One book deals with her husband&#39;s childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and some of the comics in our news paper are often serial in nature - the story never really ends it just keeps going.<br/>

characters -- were popular in the silent film era.<br/>
<br/>
The ones I remember hearing about, probably from relatives and  <br/>
elsewhere, were the Saturday film serials with the cliffhanger  <br/>
endings that started in the 30&#39;s up to television, aimed at kids.  <br/>
They were part of an entire afternoon of film: cartoons, newsreels,  <br/>
film serials and a feature film. The stories in the film serials  <br/>
would continue for weeks (15 it says below was typical). I know about  <br/>
Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers just from reading about the early days  <br/>
of science fiction but I guess the most popular were Westerns. Those  <br/>
Saturday matinees were also the source of the great Bugs Bunny  <br/>
cartoons :-) (And loads of other cartoons from that era.)<br/>
<br/>
So the audience for continuing stories was there, and an  <br/>
understanding that continuing stories could be popular, but, for  <br/>
whatever reason, the TV studios didn&#39;t trust that people would (or  <br/>
could) come back for a continuing story line. Or didn&#39;t trust that  <br/>
the audience would join in on a show with a continuing story line.  <br/>
And it wasn&#39;t until recently that the studios trusted more complex  <br/>
stories would actually hold an audience. Or, perhaps, with cable and  <br/>
all the choices, they found that to hold an audience, they had to  <br/>
create a need to come back or people wouldn&#39;t show up week after week.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, I saw Hill Street Blues when it first aired and thought  <br/>
&quot;Wow!&quot; about the interwoven stories, but now it&#39;s &quot;eh&quot;, pretty  <br/>
standard. ;-) (But they were pioneers! :-) And now, when I rewatch  <br/>
Buffy, though each episode is pretty self contained, the ones that  <br/>
were outside of the ongoing story arc tend to feel flat. And when I  <br/>
was growing up, that&#39;s the only kind of TV story telling we had! No  <br/>
arcs at all.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Serials, more specifically known as Movie serials or Film serials,  <br/>
&gt; were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction  <br/>
&gt; with a feature film. Known as &quot;chapter plays,&quot; they were extended  <br/>
&gt; motion pictures broken into a number of segments called &quot;chapters&quot;  <br/>
&gt; or &quot;episodes.&quot; Each chapter (a typical serial usually had as many  <br/>
&gt; as 15 of them) would be screened at the same theater for one week.  <br/>
&gt; The serial would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine  <br/>
&gt; would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which  <br/>
&gt; there could be no escape. The audience would have to return the  <br/>
&gt; next week (and pay admission) to find out how the hero and heroine  <br/>
&gt; would escape and battle the villain once again. Serials were  <br/>
&gt; especially popular with children, and for many youths in the first  <br/>
&gt; half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included  <br/>
&gt; a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons,  <br/>
&gt; newsreels, and two feature films.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most serials were Westerns, since those were the least expensive to  <br/>
&gt; film. Besides Westerns, though, there were films covering many  <br/>
&gt; genres, including crime fiction, espionage, comic book or comic  <br/>
&gt; strip characters, science fiction, and jungle adventures. Although  <br/>
&gt; most serials were filmed economically, some were made at  <br/>
&gt; significant expense. The Flash Gordon serial and its sequels, for  <br/>
&gt; instance, were major productions in their times.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The idea of ending a tale at a point where the audience is left in  <br/>
&gt; suspense as to its conclusion (which is then given at another time)  <br/>
&gt; has been a staple part of storytelling for almost as long as the  <br/>
&gt; idea of stories have existed. It is a central theme and framing  <br/>
&gt; device of the collection of stories known as the One Thousand And  <br/>
&gt; One Nights, wherein the queen Scheherazade, who is facing a morning  <br/>
&gt; execution on the orders of her husband King Shahryar, devises the  <br/>
&gt; solution of telling him a story but leaving it at a cliffhanger,  <br/>
&gt; thus forcing the king to postpone her execution in order to hear  <br/>
&gt; the rest of the tale.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The term &#39;cliffhanger&#39; is considered to have originated with Thomas  <br/>
&gt; Hardy&#39;s serial novel &quot;A Pair of Blue Eyes&quot; in 1873. At the time  <br/>
&gt; newspapers published novels in a serial format with one chapter  <br/>
&gt; appearing every month. In order to ensure continued interest in the  <br/>
&gt; story many authors employed different authorial techniques; in the  <br/>
&gt; aforementioned novel Hardy chose to leave one of his protagonists,  <br/>
&gt; Knight, literally hanging off a cliff staring into the stony eyes  <br/>
&gt; of a trilobite embedded in the rock that has been dead for millions  <br/>
&gt; of years. This became the archetypal — and literal — cliff-hanger  <br/>
&gt; of Victorian prose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once Hardy created it, all serial writers used the cliff-hanger  <br/>
&gt; even though Trollope felt that the use of suspense violated &quot;all  <br/>
&gt; proper confidence between the author and his reader.&quot; Basically,  <br/>
&gt; the reader would expect &quot;delightful horrors&quot; only to feel betrayed  <br/>
&gt; with a much less exciting ending. Despite the rhetorical distaste  <br/>
&gt; all serial authors used the cliffhanger and Wilkie Collins is  <br/>
&gt; famous for saying about the technique: &quot;Make &#39;em cry, make &#39;em  <br/>
&gt; laugh, make &#39;em wait – exactly in that order.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Collins is famous for the Sensation Novel which heavily relied upon  <br/>
&gt; the cliffhanger. Some examples of his endings include:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The next witnesses called were witnesses concerned with the  <br/>
&gt; question that now followed--the obscure and terrible question: Who  <br/>
&gt; Poisoned Her? (The Law and the Lady) &quot;Why are we to stop her, sir?  <br/>
&gt; What has she done?&quot; &quot;Done! She has escaped from my Asylum. Don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; forget; a woman in white. Drive on.&quot; (The Woman in White) &quot;You can  <br/>
&gt; marry me privately today,&quot; she answered. &quot;Listen--and I will tell  <br/>
&gt; you how!&quot; (Man and Wife)&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This anticipation and conversation inducing authorial technique  <br/>
&gt; would often be very contrived as the only purpose was to maintain  <br/>
&gt; interest in the monthly serial. Therefore, these were regularly  <br/>
&gt; removed from the plot when the serial was published as a full novel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The cliff-hanger was converted into film and is best known from the  <br/>
&gt; very popular silent film series The Perils of Pauline (1914), shown  <br/>
&gt; in weekly instalments and featuring Pearl White as the title  <br/>
&gt; character, a perpetual damsel in distress who was menaced by  <br/>
&gt; assorted villains, with each instalment ending with her placed in a  <br/>
&gt; situation that looked sure to result in her imminent death – to  <br/>
&gt; escape at the beginning of the next instalment only to get into  <br/>
&gt; fresh danger at its end. Specifically, an episode filmed around the  <br/>
&gt; New Jersey Palisades ended with her literally left hanging over a  <br/>
&gt; cliff and seeming about to fall.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-437364341">I really enjoy reading manga, manhwa (like manga but from Korea, not Japan),<br/>
anime and watching dramas (serial tv shows) in Korean and Japanese.  My<br/>
younger brother got me started watching manga and reading anime and it is<br/>
one of my favorite things to do.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of manga and manhwa, there are stories that are one volume and even<br/>
short stories, but most stories I&#39;ve read are long.  They typically have a<br/>
chapter published in a weekly (or monthly) magazine with comics.  Later on<br/>
you can buy the bound volumes with just one story (the way you typically buy<br/>
them here), but that is not how it is originally published.  Some stories<br/>
end suddenly because the serialization is cancelled and those can have rapid<br/>
endings that aren&#39;t that great, and some are really successful and seem to<br/>
stall and drag it out a little too long with what seem like filler.   Those<br/>
can be some of the disadvantages of serialization, but it probably also<br/>
means that it is easier for the publisher to try out a new author on the<br/>
public.  Most of the stories are a great length, but I think that it is<br/>
interesting to see how serialization can make   Lots of GREAT stories of all<br/>
different lengths out there and I really enjoy them.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese and Korean TV shows that I watch are serial stories.   Not all<br/>
of their shows are like this, but I think a lot of the prime time live<br/>
action (vs. animated) shows are.  The Korean shows are typically 16-24<br/>
episodes and an hour long (w/o commercials).  They have some historical<br/>
dramas that are more like 50 episodes, but I haven&#39;t gotten in to them yet.<br/>
I like comedies.  Japanese shows seem to be shorter (40min, if I remember<br/>
correctly) and more like 10-12 episodes.  Good stuff :)<br/>

&gt; The Japanese Manga books Zachariah loves are serial in nature - you have<br/>
&gt; to have the series to have the whole story - One set he has is 30 something<br/>
&gt; books. The shortest series he has is about 12 books. I&#39;m not talking about<br/>
&gt; books where the main characters are the same and each book is it&#39;s own<br/>
&gt; story, but a true serial.<br/>
