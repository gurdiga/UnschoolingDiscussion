Yesterday we went shopping. All the recent posts had me inspired.  When 4 yo <br/>
asked me for Red Vines, I said, &quot;yeah, grab a bag for us.&quot;  Then 3 yo <br/>
immediately wanted chocolate teddy bear graham crackers.  &quot;OK.&quot;  MY budget is so <br/>
strict that I shouldn&#39;t have been buying this stuff, but I was inspired to let them <br/>
pick.  Well, they of course wanted EVERY single sweet treat they saw. <br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The magic phrase is &quot;next time,&quot; but you need to mean it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-= We tried to watch a movie at their request (they&#39;d already watched 3 that <br/>
day), but the baby wouldn&#39;t let us and it was getting late, -=-<br/>
<br/>
Coulnd&#39;t the older two watch the movie while you took the baby for a walk <br/>
around the house or lay down with her elsewhere?  If you expect full-group <br/>
agreement all the time,  you&#39;re expecting something you&#39;re unlikely to get.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I suggested watching the movie later the next day, and 4 yo was fine, but <br/>
3 yo balked, even though she wasn&#39;t really watching the show anyway.  She <br/>
finally came around, though grumpily and she was obviously tired at 10:30.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Could you have done something with her in the same room?  Coloring, <br/>
Playdough, lego, sorting, cutting paper?<br/>
Could you rock her to sleep (if the baby was already down)?<br/>
<br/>
-=- Would she like an apple or some cheese?  4 yo squeals, &quot;Yes! and <br/>
apple!and some chocolate bears!&quot;  3 yo screams, &quot;NO and stomps her feet and crosses <br/>
her arms and demands red vines.&quot;  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have asked.  I would have cut up some snacks and put them out on a <br/>
plate to let them choose through the day.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the questions and answers are frustrting you.  Try to arrange <br/>
choices without the asking and answering and aproving and disapproving in <br/>
cases where you can.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I gave her another red vine, cored and sliced and apple and gave everyone <br/>
some bears.  4 yo says she doesn&#39;t have enough bears even before eating one.  <br/>
I told her that if she was still hungry afterward and wanted more, she could <br/>
have some-=-<br/>
<br/>
One shared platter prevents who has more, who didn&#39;t finish, etc.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Before I could even get the dish water started, 4 yo says she is full and <br/>
leaves the table full of uneaten apple wedges--beautiful, crispy, tart-sweet <br/>
Braeburns that she used to love.  I bite my tongue and ate them myself even <br/>
though I&#39;m not hungry. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Zip loc bag in the fridge would&#39;ve prevented you eating them or being grouchy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  I hate to see them turn brown and go to waste.  Then, about 20 minutes <br/>
later, 4 yo comes up to me and says she&#39;s hungry.  She asked me for chocolate <br/>
bears.  3 yo asked for more red vines. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cheaper than future therapy.<br/>
And it&#39;s not waste if they get fed to birds or hamsters or put in a compost <br/>
pile.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m sorry this is so long.  It doesn&#39;t even scratch the surface of what <br/>
goes on around here.  Though we also have fun, many of our days are filled with <br/>
fighting, crying,  and whining.  I just don&#39;t know what to do.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you give yourself two choices each time you&#39;re deciding what to do, you&#39;ll <br/>
gradually ratchet toward better decisions.   Moving from frustration to <br/>
togetherness isn&#39;t a one-step trip.  But taking the first step puts you in position <br/>
to take the second one.<br/>
<br/>
Can you cut red vines into little pieces? (If kids would hate that, never <br/>
mind.)<br/>
Can you use more alluring distractions than &quot;no&quot; or &quot;enough&quot;?  Instead of <br/>
saing, &quot;No more movie,&quot; can you set up a fun table of something in another room, <br/>
and lure them there as soon as the movie&#39;s over?<br/>
<br/>
When a baby is holding something dangerous, it works better to offer her <br/>
somethig eciting.  Often she&#39;ll just drop the forgotten dangerous item.  If you <br/>
try to wrestle it away, though, the baby cries and feels deprived, instead of <br/>
feeling she&#39;s just gotten hold of something beautiful and better.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s hard to have babies. Sorry if this all seems dismissive.  I don&#39;t <br/>
mean to be.  Maybe it&#39;s like discussing whether childbirth hurts.  It does <br/>
hurt.  That part can&#39;t be changed.  Having babies at home means too little <br/>
sleep, conflicting requests and demands, exhaustion.  Frustration.   The kinder you <br/>
are now, the better things will be next year, next month, next week, <br/>
tomorrow, and now.<br/>

=================<br/>
<br/>
I use this, and yes, it does work just fine, and I do mean it.<br/>
<br/>
=================<br/>
Coulnd&#39;t the older two watch the movie while you took the baby for a walk<br/>
around the house or lay down with her elsewhere?  If you expect full-group<br/>
agreement all the time,  you&#39;re expecting something you&#39;re unlikely to get.<br/>
=================<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to give the impression that I expect consensus.  In this<br/>
particular case, the movie was one that I needed to watch with them, in case<br/>
it was scary for them or whatever.  And also because they asked me to watch<br/>
it with them.  (Close Encounters of the Third Kind)  Otherwise, I would have<br/>
done just as you suggest, taken the baby away to do something else.  I&#39;ve<br/>
done that many times, believe me! LOL<br/>
<br/>
==============<br/>
 I wouldn&#39;t have asked.  I would have cut up some snacks and put them out on<br/>
a plate to let them choose through the day.<br/>
==============<br/>
<br/>
I do this too, but I can see why that would have helped in this particular<br/>
situation to have just done that instead of asking.  I could have gotten the<br/>
red vines AND some other things, protein included, to entice them, and then<br/>
not worried about it.    When I do put platters out, they eat all of it up<br/>
for the most part.  Hmmm....this is an important insight for me.<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
One shared platter prevents who has more, who didn&#39;t finish, etc...<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I actually did put out one shared platter, except for the red vines,<br/>
which they wanted control of.  I use platters of food quite often.<br/>
Sometimes they bicker over who is grabbing the last piece, but I keep<br/>
reminding them that they can have more food if they are still hungry when it<br/>
is all gone.<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
 It&#39;s cheaper than future therapy.<br/>
And it&#39;s not waste if they get fed to birds or hamsters or put in a compost<br/>
pile.<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can see this.  I think I need to work on my own attitude about waste<br/>
and such.<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
 Can you use more alluring distractions than &quot;no&quot; or &quot;enough&quot;?<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
Of course I can, and DO.  My grabbing her firmly and saying, &quot;Enough.  I<br/>
don&#39;t like to be screamed at!&quot;  is an example of my losing my patience in<br/>
the fray.  She was being so unreasonable and I was getting tired and<br/>
frustrated.  It was a perfect place to breathe, but I didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
Instead of saing, &quot;No more movie,&quot; can you set up a fun table of something<br/>
in another room, and lure them there as soon as the movie&#39;s over?<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
This seems like a really sensible and useful idea for me.  I think the only<br/>
reason I haven&#39;t done more of this type of thing lately is because I&#39;m<br/>
overwhelmed and need a break.  When they are happy with a movie, I often<br/>
forget to look ahead to the end of the movie.  Instead I either watch with<br/>
them and enjoy the peace, or I try to catch up on housework, or I am doing<br/>
something with the baby.  I think I would like to be caught up, but even<br/>
when I am, it&#39;s hard to keep up.  Anyway, I know this will get easier as<br/>
they get older.<br/>
<br/>

No, I understand that you don&#39;t mean to be dismissive.  I don&#39;t feel<br/>
dismissed.  I&#39;m thankful for yours and everyone else&#39;s time and help.  You<br/>
help me to see things differently sometimes and sometimes you remind of what<br/>
I know and this is good. I have a 15 yo son as well, and I remember how<br/>
things got easier in many ways as he got older.  Still, he was one kid<br/>
compared to the three I have now, and he was VERY mellow.  Very.  Still is.<br/>
I wish I could let things flow around me the way he does.  I need a good<br/>
meditative practice, and I will work harder at developing that.  Thanks for<br/>
taking the time to read and respond to my emotional, frustrated posts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066679941">My kids could never resist a new warm batch of home-made play dough and the<br/>
bucket of cookie cutters.  Do you have a recipe?  <br/>
Also, when my kids were small, taking them outside when things were starting<br/>
to get tense, always worked.  They also really like playing with water.  A<br/>
pot of water on towels on the floor with barbies or beanies is always fun.<br/>
(and some shaving cream or a little shampoo)  They can each have their own<br/>
pot of  water and they get clean to boot.  Shaving cream on the table to<br/>
draw in is fun too.  Once we even brought the kiddie pool into the kitchen<br/>
in mid winter and filled it up and had a beach party.  Lots of towels, our<br/>
pool had a small slide!  And the kitchen floor got clean too.  Maybe you<br/>
could think of some things that would be really new to them and make a list<br/>
and when things are falling apart, you could refer to the list with<br/>
enthusiasm and pick something to do.  &quot;I have a great idea, come here...&quot;<br/>
Who can resist that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735661490">Andrea,<br/>
<br/>
I understand completely how you feel.  My kids were 1,3 and 5 when we moved<br/>
to a new city for DH&#39;s job.  The plan was supposed to be that he would go<br/>
from a job where he worked from home and traveled half the time to a regular<br/>
9-5 job with occasional travel.  What we ended up with instead was a 7-7<br/>
office job where he was traveling almost as often!  Add to this the fact<br/>
that I left all of my mom friends in the old city and accidentally moved<br/>
into The Stepford Village from Hell!<br/>
<br/>
I was so overwhelmed and isolated and unhappy.  I got short tempered with<br/>
the kids, depressed and cried everyday, at least once.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few suggestions.  Take what might work and leave the rest.<br/>
<br/>
*Try to find a friend or two.  Take the kids to story time at the library or<br/>
bookstore, go to a park, La Leche League Meeting (if applicable), homeschool<br/>
support group, etc.  Anywhere you might strike up a conversation with<br/>
another like-minded mom.  Sometimes it helps just have a short<br/>
I-know-what-you&#39;re-going-through conversation with another mom at the<br/>
playground.<br/>
<br/>
*If you can, put a few things out at night after the kids go to bed that<br/>
might be interesting to them the next day.  Set out paper and glue and<br/>
feathers ,pom poms, sequins, etc for an impromptu art project. Or play-doh<br/>
with cookie cutters and rolling pins.  Rice and bean tub with measuring<br/>
spoons and cups. <br/>
<br/>
*When everyone seems a little crabby, put on some great music and Dance!<br/>
<br/>
* When things get really bad, just add water!  I don&#39;t know why, but water<br/>
is a great relaxing diversion.  Put them in the tub, take them outside to<br/>
wash the car, fill a tub with bubbly water to play in, get out the<br/>
sprinkler......anything wet.  (I had a friend confide once that they had<br/>
such a bad day, her son was on his third bath!)<br/>
<br/>
* When a long movie is coming to an end, and you think all hell might break<br/>
out, get them a snack tray to share about 15-20 minutes before then end of<br/>
the movie.  You also might want to have an optional activity planned right<br/>
afterwards.  Like &quot;Hey, now that the movie is over, who wants to help me<br/>
bake cookies?&quot; or &quot;I was thinking about washing the car, anyone want to<br/>
help?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
* Find something YOU want to do while they are watching TV and do it.  They<br/>
may decide it looks interesting and join you.  If not, you still get to do<br/>
something of your own choosing.<br/>
<br/>
* If the noise of the TV running constantly bugs you (and I can relate,<br/>
because I have a hard time even with background music that I choose!) you<br/>
can compromise.  &quot;I know you guys really like to watch the TV, but I need a<br/>
little quiet for a while.  How about we watch a movie, then turn the TV off<br/>
for an hour?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of these are useful to you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and keep us posted on how things go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758535614">My kids could never resist a new warm batch of home-made play dough and the<br/>

==========<br/>
<br/>
I have several of MaryAnn Kohl&#39;s books and we do this quite a bit.<br/>
Yesterday we made edible dough with peanut butter, corn syrup, powdered<br/>
sugar and powdered milk.  It was fun.  We all ate a little, but it was so<br/>
rich.  The texture was different than other doughs we have made and we liked<br/>
the oiliness of it.  We had a good time.<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
 A pot of water on towels on the floor with barbies or beanies is always<br/>
fun. (and some shaving cream or a little shampoo)  They can each have their<br/>
own pot of  water and they get clean to boot.<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
We do a version of this too, but I haven&#39;t tried the shaving cream or<br/>
beanies.  Thanks for the tip!<br/>
<br/>
I can see the sense in just getting things ready to do, and when I remember<br/>
to do that, things go much more smoothly.  Like last night when their movie<br/>
ended, there was ingredients for edible dough set up on the table.  They<br/>
just jumped right in!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminder!<br/>

I started doing kids&#39; birthday parties that way when they were little, and I <br/>
still do it.  If there are two places they&#39;re toggling between (like patio and <br/>
living room, at the old house, and library and kitchen here) I go and take <br/>
down and set up the next phase--food, game, cake, gifts) while they&#39;re occupied <br/>
in the other place, then when they change rooms I go straighten up and <br/>
re-stage the room they just left.<br/>
