<div id="ygrps-yiv-229104390">As far as easy-ish yet interesting books, have you tried the Magic Treehouse<br/>
series? Casey loves those. She also likes Nate the Great and anything with a<br/>
bit of a mystery in it. Conor liked The Zach Files.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Mary<br/>
The books above are too difficult and intimidating, she prefers the larger<br/>
print of the easy readers but the stories are &quot;dumb&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m going to get her a bunch of comic books and magazine subscriptions too.<br/>
