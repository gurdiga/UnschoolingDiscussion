<div id="ygrps-yiv-636888564">Our basically unschoolers group (we don&#39;t run you off for using curriculum<br/>
but we don&#39;t let it be a focus of the group) doesn&#39;t have a fixed leader.<br/>
We have an email loop, meet for park days, sometimes people organize a group<br/>
rate for the children&#39;s series at the symphony or whatever.....it is nothing<br/>
very formal but lots of support goes on.<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] unschooler support groups<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi all.<br/>
&gt; My local area homeschoolers are reactivating an unschoolers support group.<br/>
More than 6 years ago there was a monthly group in our area with a wonderful<br/>
facilitator.   As the facilitator&#39;s son is now grown - she has moved on to a<br/>
professional life and is willing to work with our group but does require a<br/>
fee for her time and services.  There is no doubt in anyone&#39;s mind that she<br/>
is well worth the money.  However, we are questioning the need to have a<br/>
facilitator at all.   Whether we decide to hire someone or not - the<br/>
question has come up as to a &quot;format&quot; for our meetings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am curious of those of you who have attended or do attend a regular<br/>
&#39;unschooler support group&#39; what format has been used?  What has worked and<br/>
what has not?  I know each group evolves differently - as will this group.<br/>
I am simply looking for a variety of ideas and experiences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any feedback.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; btw - if anyone is in the Metro NY area and would like to attend...contact<br/>
me off-list- first meeting is scheduled next month in Nyack, Rockland County<br/>
area.<br/>

We have one person in our group who organizes and facilitates our &quot;parent <br/>
meetings&quot;. She uses parents within the group, and people from the community, <br/>
depending on what the subject of discussion is.  We polled families within the <br/>
group and found out what kind subjects they would like to see discussed.  <br/>
Here are some examples:<br/>
<br/>
Dual enrollment-We had a dual enrollment representative from the local <br/>
college and a parent who at the time had her second child attending the college <br/>
under dual enrollment. <br/>
<br/>
Library help-had a rep from the local library and a parent who uses the <br/>
library frequently. <br/>
<br/>
Favorite curriculum-We had parents bring some of their favorite curriculum to <br/>
show and talk about what they liked best about it. Including websites. <br/>
<br/>
Portfolios- Have a rep from the local county homeschool office or a favorite <br/>
portfolio evaluator<br/>
that could answer any questions and have a demonstration of how to put <br/>
together a portfolio, and what the expectations are.<br/>
<br/>
There are just endless activities and discussions to choose from, and <br/>
utilizing the strengths of different parents in the group can be valuable. Hope this <br/>
helps.<br/>

I am<br/>
simply looking for a variety of ideas and experiences.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am totally, completely baffled as to why you would need any kind <br/>
of facilitation to form and run any kind of homeschooling group, <br/>
much less an UNschooling group!!<br/>
It&#39;s about getting together for fun right?<br/>
What exactly is the agenda?<br/>
I run a support group in Pensacola that is quite successful, and we <br/>
don&#39;t hold &quot;meetings&quot;, we get together and play every week. The only <br/>
more formal thing we are now starting is a 4-H club, for those that <br/>
are interested. That will mean an actual meeting 2x per month.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to read more about us, or see pictures, you can visit <br/>
pensacolaunschoolers.com.  We have planned some of our get <br/>
togethers, because someone had a cool idea or game to share, and we <br/>
like to do parties for the holidays and such, but it&#39;s very relaxed, <br/>
very much about building friendships and NOT doing a bunch of <br/>
planning. Most of the planning falls on me because I LIKE that kind <br/>
of thing.:)<br/>
<br/>
Some of us met down at the Earth Day festivities on Saturday, and <br/>
we&#39;re doing a tour of the EPA facility on Sabine Island. So we do <br/>
plan stuff here and there, but it evolves in it&#39;s own way and only <br/>
when someone wishes to organize such events.<br/>
<br/>
I say, take it easy, just invite folks to hang out with you. Ideas <br/>
will come up, the group will take on a life of it&#39;s own. Unschoolers <br/>
don&#39;t need some &quot;facilitator&quot; to make a group successful. Part of <br/>
being a successful unschooler is recognizing your own power and <br/>
ability!  She may be a hugely successful unschooler, and she may <br/>
have had a fabulous group, but she didn&#39;t PAY someone to help her do <br/>
it, she just figured it out! So you do the same.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008444435">Our unschooling group meets once a month for roller skating.  That is <br/>
our only set activity.  We have a Yahoo group and anyone is welcome <br/>
to organize a trip or &quot;class&quot;.  My son and I recently organized an <br/>
owl pellet class for over 30 kids.  That is all we do with our <br/>
group.  It works for everyone involved I think.<br/>
