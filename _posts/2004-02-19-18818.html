<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747187815">I&#39;d love some game ideas for my 5yo daughter.  We&#39;ve tried some that she<br/>
has seen at Costco, but they don&#39;t really hold her interest.  Basically,<br/>
they are fun for a few hours and then she pretty much exhausts them - and I<br/>
can tell that she would like something more challenging.<br/>
<br/>
With the things we have tried she has liked adventure sorts of finding<br/>
expeditions, draw your own scenes, and timing challenges (where you try to<br/>
do several tasks within a certain amount of time -- I don&#39;t really know<br/>
what these sorts of games are called, but I think of them as arcade games.)<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that the things she has picked out are because she likes<br/>
the characters (Winnie the Pooh Kindergarten, for example) - but the games<br/>
themselves are a bit too repetitive and dumb her down.  It&#39;s even been hard<br/>
to do the wrong things with these games, which is just no fun at all!!<br/>
(She really likes to do this with games, as many of you can probably relate<br/>
to.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329203437">My girls (4 and 6) love Zoombinis and I Spy (several versions of each). <br/>
They have some character ones too but they don&#39;t hold their interest too<br/>
long.  We are always in search of new ones too.  <br/>

********************************<br/>
My daughter just turned 6.  Her favorites (some of  which were also favorites when she was 5 are not arcade games -- but FWIW here are some:  Zoombinis (all three games available), Freddie Fish (I think there are 5 or 6), Scooby-Doo mysteries (we have 3 or 4, I think there are 5 or 6), Barbie Detective (there are 2 that I know of), Pajama Sam (she likes these less well than the others, but still likes them). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103570885">I guess it is time I introduce myself.  I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for a few months.  I have a 6 yro and a 4 yro.  They really enjoy the Magic School Bus computer games.  We have the games about space, dinosaurs and rain forests.  They also enjoy going online to Nick Jr and Playhouse Disney.  They have a lot of really neat games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94991270">My kids all liked Putt-Putt games.  They&#39;re simple, and seemed really slow to <br/>
me, but kids sometimes really LIKE slow.  They&#39;re pretty.    Putt-Putt is a <br/>
little cartoon car who does helpful things and is sent on little jobs and <br/>
errands and though it sounds lame, it didn&#39;t seem lame to little kids at all.<br/>

Harvest Moon would be great then.<br/>
<br/>
You can buy a used SNES (Super Nintendo) and a Harvest Moon game probably <br/>
either at a local used gaming shop or easier off e-bay or online gaming exchanges <br/>
and though it takes a little reading, mostly it&#39;s a giant puzzle that can be <br/>
solved tons of different ways.<br/>
