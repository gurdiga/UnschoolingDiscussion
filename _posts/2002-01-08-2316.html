The Santa Fe Staircase<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
I was in Santa Fe New Mexico doing research for The Strange.  I was looking<br/>
for the mysterious Santa Fe Staircase and I found it inside a tiny chapel in<br/>
the heart of Santa Fe.<br/>
<br/>
The staircase is strange because of two reasons.  The first being the<br/>
strange man that built it.  The second reason being that according to many<br/>
engineers and carpenters it is a marvel of engineering.<br/>
<br/>
The story of the staircase is as follows.  Inside the tiny chapel there is a<br/>
choir loft in the back.  This loft is ten or twelve feet above the floor of<br/>
the chapel and when the place was new, the choir had to climb up a shaky<br/>
ladder to go up into the loft to sing.  It was getting to the point where<br/>
many of the members were refusing to climb up the rickety ladder into the<br/>
loft to sing on sunday morning.  The women of the church were distraught and<br/>
gathered one day to pray to God for a solution.  Some days later, a<br/>
mysterious stranger came out of the desert.  A man no one knew, yet he said<br/>
that God had sent him to build them a staircase.  He set to work on it with<br/>
only a hammer and saw and nothing else, except for a giant tub of hot water.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s so very strange about this spiral staircase is the fact that it was<br/>
built with only a hammer and saw and that there are no nails in the entire<br/>
work.  I got as close as I could to this piece of craftsmanship to examine<br/>
it thoroughly.  I can tell you first hand that I couldn&#39;t even find a single<br/>
peg.  It looks as though it was carved out of one gigantic block of wood.<br/>
Another thing about the staircase is that it is absolutely beautiful.  I<br/>
stood there in awe of the sheer aesthetic value of<br/>
this expertly crafted wonder.  I wish I had one just like it in my home.<br/>
<br/>
Some say the man who came out of the desert to build the spiral staircase<br/>
was none other than Jesus himself.  The carpenter of carpenters.  In fact<br/>
the descriptions that were written about the man say that he indeed looked<br/>
like Christ.  Who knows?  As soon as he had finished with it, he disappeared<br/>
without a trace and no one ever heard from him again.  Some say that the man<br/>
was an angel sent from God.<br/>
<br/>
Scientists, engineers and carpenters come from all over the world to examine<br/>
this spiral staircase.  Many of them say that by all rights the staircase<br/>
shouldn&#39;t even be able to hold up it&#39;s own weight, much less hold the weight<br/>
of thousands of people climbing up and down its steps for well over a<br/>
hundred years.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re ever in Santa Fe, I urge you to visit the tiny chapel and witness<br/>
for yourself this beautiful and mysterious wonder and, while you there, go<br/>
to a nearby restaurant and dine on the best southwestern cuisine you ever<br/>
tasted!<br/>

That&#39;s funny! I was thinking when I read Sandra&#39;s<br/>
post, &quot;I know that story. I watched a movie about that<br/>
at my mom&#39;s house&quot;. I can&#39;t remember the name of it<br/>
though.<br/>
