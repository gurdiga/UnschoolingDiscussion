<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210624196">Hello Unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of you met me at the L&L Conference this August (or saw my little <br/>
cards)... my name is Regan and I have made a survey to count <br/>
Unschoolers!  (Why did I do this?  For fun, for my own interest, <br/>
because maybe I&#39;ll make a documentary or something, who knows?)  You <br/>
can read more of my introduction at the survey start page <br/>
(www.xed-out.com/unschooling), and I am happy to answer questions here <br/>
on this list or privately via email.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to invite the unschooling families that read here to <br/>
participate in the survey by going to the page I listed above and <br/>
following the instructions there.  Additionally, if anyone tried the <br/>
survey before and couldn&#39;t get it to work, I&#39;ve re-set the answers so <br/>
you should be able to try again.  Best results come from using Netscape <br/>
as your browser, and taking the survey at &quot;odd&quot; times of the day.  If <br/>
possible, don&#39;t take the survey on a Saturday morning in any time zone! <br/>
  I used a free service to host the data, and it gets overwhelmed if too <br/>
many people access it at once.  (But if there&#39;s a lot of interest in <br/>
the survey, next year when I run it again maybe I can get a grant to <br/>
have it hosted on a more robust computer.)  Last technical note:  if <br/>
you are RETAKING the survey due to having had problems before, please <br/>
make a note to that effect in the comments field at the end so that I <br/>
will double-check that you have not been counted twice.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some exciting survey data so far!  Please bear in mind that the <br/>
only place the survey has been publicized so far was at the L&L <br/>
Conference, so at the moment the results are heavily weighted in the <br/>
direction of the US Northeast and South regions.<br/>
<br/>
38 households have taken the survey so far.<br/>
<br/>
100% of the households have been represented by mothers of the children.<br/>
<br/>
53% of the households responding so far are located in the Northeast of <br/>
the US.  (26% from the South)<br/>
<br/>
84 children are so far represented by the survey: 57 of compulsory <br/>
school-age, 19 not-yet-school-aged, and 8 past the age of compulsory <br/>
schooling.<br/>
<br/>
46% of the school-aged children have never been to school, nor schooled <br/>
via curriculum at home.<br/>
<br/>
89% of the children who are currently unschooling have unrestricted <br/>
access to media in their homes.<br/>
84% of the children who are currently unschooling do not have a <br/>
prescribed bedtime.<br/>
46% of the children who are currently unschooling are not required to <br/>
do chores.<br/>
33% of the children who are currently unschooling are also currently <br/>
taking a class or lessons.<br/>
<br/>
28% of the children who have never been to school (or had <br/>
curriculum-at-home) have listed &quot;reading to self&quot; as a favorite <br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
94% of the children not yet of school age will be unschoolers, once <br/>
they reach compulsory school age.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
and I look forward to seeing more results come in!<br/>
<br/>
Regan<br/>
