<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817851041">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and subscribed because I am<br/>
interested in the opinions of other unschooling moms<br/>
and how your children have learned writing skills.  We<br/>
unschool in the sense of trusting that our children<br/>
will know when they are ready to take on tasks and<br/>
following their lead for what they want to learn and<br/>
how they want to learn it.  My daughter is nine this<br/>
month and took off on reading about 6 months ago.  She<br/>
spends a fair amount of time reading both fiction and<br/>
non-fiction, but also still loves to spend time with<br/>
her various critters and engage in make-believe play<br/>
with her sibling and other children.  She loves to<br/>
draw, but she HATESs to write.  If she wants to leave<br/>
herself a note, for example, to bring her tortoise in<br/>
for the night instead of writing out the words she<br/>
will draw a picture of the tortoise grazing and post<br/>
that where it reminds her.  I have been fine with this<br/>
approach and have trusted that when she is at a point<br/>
in her life where she wants to truly express her<br/>
feelings she will feel compelled to write.  I have<br/>
kind of expected this will happen in adolescence. <br/>
Recently an event happened that is causing me to<br/>
question my judgement.  Has anyone else out there left<br/>
it up to divine providence that their children will<br/>
indeed want to, and then proceed to, learn to write<br/>
when they are ready?   Has anyone any regrets about<br/>
not being more proactive with their child in teaching<br/>
writing?  Thanks in advance for any input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161272980">Tammy,<br/>
  I am definetly not an expert in this area - but here is my 2 cents.<br/>
  My oldest wrote at an early age - part of that was from attending ps for 2<br/>
years.  However her penmanship is horrible.  My 2nd child - my son, I waited<br/>
till he was about 7 to attempt writing.  We did the &quot;Teach Your Child to<br/>
Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; - it worked for him.  His penmanship is nice and<br/>
neat.  We also used the &quot;A Reason for Writing&quot; lessons.  <br/>
My 3rd child is a lefty - I tried &quot;Teach Your Child&quot; method with her, we<br/>
both would end up frustrated.  I decided to allow her to do as she wanted -<br/>
no lines, no forced writing.  She is not writing fluently, well she can&#39;t<br/>
even write her name - but she is interested in learning because it is what<br/>
she wants to do, not what I am forcing her to do.  I will write something on<br/>
a piece of paper and she will copy it on another piece.<br/>
You might try asking your daughter if she would like to put some of her<br/>
&quot;make-believe&quot; stories in a book, and let her illustrate it also.    Kate<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-863778687">Hi Tammy,<br/>
Elly (7yo), Has numeruos pen pals, which has really helped her, right now I <br/>
do the formal writing but she does the rough draft. She will read for me, <br/>
but no one else, ( my mom and family has tried to convince her she should <br/>
already know how to read and shame on her mommy ;),<br/>
so she trusts me, her daddy too at times but no one else. Right now her <br/>
writing skills are pretty basic, her spacing, capitilization (sp), etc are <br/>
very rough. I dont mind, she knows more on other things than kids twice her <br/>
age so....... Things like this used to worry me, but now, that I have seen <br/>
her learning life&#39;s skills all by herself and with some inquistive <br/>
questions, I am prretty much comfy with the fact that she will learn what <br/>
she needs to, when she needs to!<br/>
Indiana Tami-no sleep for over 24 hrs. so very rambling :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912111439">I have a daughter who wasn&#39;t really writing at 9. At that time we were still<br/>
doing &#39;school at home&#39; and I tried to &#39;make&#39; her write. It didn&#39;t do much<br/>
good.(there&#39;s my regret, trying to force her to write)  I finally left it<br/>
alone. Now, at almost 15 she writes a lot. Sometimes out of need, sometimes<br/>
for pleasure. She would rather type than write but she&#39;ll do either. Her<br/>
penmanship isn&#39;t great, but neither is mine or her Dad&#39;s so I&#39;m not worried<br/>
about it. My 12 yr old wrote much earlier, and much prettier. My 10 yr old<br/>
who is just now reading can write beautifully, knows the basic rules (spaces<br/>
between words, periods, cap. letters) but only writes thank you notes and to<br/>
label his intricate drawings of inventions and such, nothing else. His time<br/>
will come. As long as they have the tools, when the need or desire to write<br/>
comes, they will put it all together amazingly fast and be just fine.<br/>

<br/>
My kids all write, very different things, and none of the things look like <br/>
book reports or essays.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly doesn&#39;t read, but has been writing for years.  She makes little books.  <br/>
Someone else writes what she dictates and then she copies and illustrates it, <br/>
and reads it back (over and over and over).<br/>
<br/>
Marty (12) designs games.  He writes the rules down in an interesting <br/>
narrative way, not traditional rules style.  He wants me to put his rules on <br/>
webpages when he&#39;s worked out the bugs of his newest RPG.  He didn&#39;t know the <br/>
term, but he wants me to edit it into a neutral voice.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby (14) writes in character in RPG games, real-time fast, in chatrooms and <br/>
instant messages.  He&#39;s doing a pretty good pseudo-medieval formal  voice.  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen a couple of reports he&#39;s written--short, actually-necessary things. <br/>
 One summary to work about what they had in stock for Pokemon league and what <br/>
was needed, and another report on the status of the players in his area of <br/>
responsibility in the RPG.  They were real writing, for a real purpose, and a <br/>
specific recipient.  There are adults who &quot;got A&#39;s&quot; in writing who have never <br/>
written one thing that wasn&#39;t just practice.<br/>
<br/>
School might not count any or much of that, but I taught composition and I <br/>
taught &quot;language arts,&quot; and I&#39;m not one bit worried.  I talk to these kids <br/>
all the time, and they have language, ideas, and organizational skills.  I <br/>
have dealt with lots of kids who had the ability to construct a complete <br/>
sentence, write legibly and punctuate, but they had no word-art, no ideas, <br/>
and no organization.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are ahead of the game (if there is one).<br/>

And if they don&#39;t have the tools but they have learned to read on their own, <br/>
and learned about geography on their own, etc., they&#39;ll have no problem with <br/>
and no fear of learning to write, because now they want to.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not rocket science, writing.  <br/>
They can learn rocket science on their own too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I recommend the Space Cube rocketry museum in Alamogordo, New Mexico for part <br/>
of that!<br/>

There are times I feel so confident, and other times I&#39;m not so sure....<br/>
We have just had two weekends of company...public schooled kids...and that<br/>
always helps me see that my kids are really, really, really nice kids.<br/>
It isn&#39;t so much the schooling though, as the parenting...or lack of....<br/>
In fact 3 of the kids are private schooled...if that makes any difference...it<br/>
doesn&#39;t to me.<br/>
It is definitely something to do with the parenting....<br/>
It has really been on my mind since our company has departed.<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is....<br/>
What do you truly think of your son?  That is what is important....  Not what<br/>
his so called &quot;educational&quot; level is....  Or what he should know or be able to<br/>
do at his age....<br/>
Does this make sense without being hurtful?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716270878">&quot;What do you truly think of your son?  That is what is<br/>
important....  Not what<br/>
his so called &quot;educational&quot; level is....  Or what he<br/>
should know or be able to<br/>
do at his age....<br/>
Does this make sense without being hurtful?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a good point and one I struggle with at times.<br/>
 I want her to feel good about who she is and I don&#39;t<br/>
want to create negative paradigms for her around that.<br/>
 But at the same time I know before she learned to<br/>
read she compared herself to her ps friends and would<br/>
often say &quot;I&#39;m stupid&quot; or other negative things about<br/>
herself.  Now that she has learned to read she often<br/>
remarks about how smart she is.  Now the paradox - I<br/>
didn&#39;t teach her to read other than giving her some<br/>
very basic phonics skills.  She taught herself by<br/>
asking what words were or asking me to show her a word<br/>
that I had just read to her and practicing all on her<br/>
own unbeknowst to me.  Maybe that is my answer - to<br/>
write with her.  Some people on this list have<br/>
suggested having her dictate while I do the actual<br/>
writing.  Does that lead to independent writing the<br/>
way reading to a child leads to an interest in reading<br/>
independently?  I think the light bulb is coming on...<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to everyone,<br/>

Oh Barb....I know the feeling, and really enjoyed your<br/>
email.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
There are times I feel so confident, and other times<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure....&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
We have just had two weekends of company...public<br/>
schooled kids...and that&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
always helps me see that my kids are really, really,<br/>
really nice kids.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
It isn&#39;t so much the schooling though, as the<br/>
parenting...or lack of....&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
In fact 3 of the kids are private schooled...if that<br/>
makes any difference...it&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
doesn&#39;t to me.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
It is definitely something to do with the<br/>
parenting....&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
It has really been on my mind since our company has<br/>
departed.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is....&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
What do you truly think of your son?&nbsp; That is<br/>
what is important....&nbsp; Not what&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
his so called &quot;educational&quot; level<br/>
is....&nbsp; Or what he should know or be able to&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
do at his age....&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Does this make sense without being hurtful?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535465228">Ann,<br/>
    I couldn&#39;t thank you enough. Ds11 is the sweetest kid. Away with his red<br/>
hair being noticed and his he*lpful attitude. I&#39;m very proud of him. I&#39;m<br/>
hoping that the talking/encouraging him to write more does the trick.<br/>
    Right now he in considering the sugestion in our activity schedule for<br/>
next years &quot;school year&quot;. He really enjoys our community here. He&#39;s almost<br/>
old enough to participate in the volunteer community as well.<br/>
    I just don&#39;t want him to be embarrassed unwittingly.:-(<br/>
    Thank you to whoever said to write down an ongoing story. That sound<br/>
like a great way to approach it all this fall. Now how in the world do I get<br/>
all these great ideas/sports/classes/homelife/etc to work out without losing<br/>
it. ;-) <br/>
    Now if I could just figure out my soon to be 16yo son. Chillin&#39; in that<br/>
arena gets more difficult as time goes by. I&#39;m so afraid of letting him<br/>
down. Dropping the ball if you will. :-( Whole other story. I have three.<br/>
LOL! Or should that be 4 w/dh. (EG)<br/>

The ideas are the writing.<br/>
<br/>
When kids play make-believe stuff they&#39;re practicing future-writing skills.<br/>
When a child tells you about a movie he saw, or tells you what happened at <br/>
grandma&#39;s, that narration is a necessary skill for writing too.  ANY language <br/>
use leads to more ease at language use.<br/>
