A friend has a craft book and in one recipe it calls for non-biological dish <br/>
soap.  Could you please tell me what that means?  The book was originally <br/>
published in London.  Thanks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I totally agree Shyrley,  we live in a great land of hypocracy!    If<br/>
&gt; &gt; I ever have a painful type of cancer or other illness I sure hope I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can find a good supplier of weed!  In certain ways our country is so<br/>
&gt; &gt; behind on somethings and then on other things we are ahead.   We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the land of free, but are we?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kelli<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Well, judging by the Patriot Act maybe the US should be labelled<br/>
&gt;Land of the Not So Free now Where Did I put the Constitution...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t speak for anywhere apart from North Virginia and I&#39;ve only<br/>
&gt;been here for 15 months and while there are things about the US<br/>
&gt;that I think are just wonderful my main impression (and this is from<br/>
&gt;middle class suburbia) is that there is a puritan anal attititude here<br/>
&gt;towards having fun and especially towards children. It&#39;s weird.<br/>
&gt;Maybe its north Virginia with its middle class suburbs, conservative<br/>
&gt;conformist people in their SUV&#39;s who ferry their kids to 300 after<br/>
&gt;school enrichment activities every week and measure their lawns to<br/>
&gt;make sure all the grass is the same length....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey! I&#39;m foaming again.<br/>
&gt;I need to fly home and have a joint....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Shyrley<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different. I laugh at you because you are all <br/>
&gt;the same.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m only guessing, but sometimes enzymes are an ingredient in cleaning <br/>
products.  I&#39;m guessing that this would be a dish soap that has no enzymes. <br/>
(I could be TOTALLY wrong, though.  I just love to spout ignorance whenever <br/>
possible!)<br/>
