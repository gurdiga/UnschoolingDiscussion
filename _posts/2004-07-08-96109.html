<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928578863">Hotel Rooms at the Peabody Marriott, the Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>
Conference  site, are almost sold out! We’re still hoping to get some more rooms there, <br/>
but we’ve blocked rooms at another hotel nearby.  It’s only a 4 minute drive <br/>
from the Marriott, and we were able to get the same $89 per night rate. (I <br/>
think a couple of people already booked rooms there for more. If so, call and <br/>
ask them to change your reservations to the cheaper conference rate.)<br/>
 <br/>
The hotel’s site:   <br/>

 <br/>
Call 1 (888) 287-9400 or (978) 535-5000 and ask for the Live and Learn <br/>
conference rate.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come to the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference August 27-29 in Peabody, MA!<br/>
