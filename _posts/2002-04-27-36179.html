 How about asking her during or after a tantrum if she had corn? How about<br/>
 asking her to have her tantrum elsewhere because it isn&#39;t fair for the whole<br/>
 family to suffer for the choices she makes? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly how we handle our food sensitive children around here.<br/>
Even from a very young age. It&#39;s not a safety issue (as diabetes would be) so <br/>
to me it&#39;s something they have to learn to control.<br/>
My oldest is the first to shun all dairy and sugar products if he starts <br/>
feeling lousy.<br/>
He can handle them in much larger quantities the older he gets though.<br/>
It has made him act in very grumpy ways before, but I just let him know we <br/>
are tired of being grumped at and maybe point out ways to help himself feel <br/>
better.<br/>
Even my four y.o. is aware of the foods that bother her.....she is less <br/>
likely to control herself as of yet. But again, it&#39;s not a safety issue so I <br/>
want it to be their choice.<br/>
Heck, I&#39;ve had allergies all week and I just can&#39;t seem to stay away from my <br/>
own trigger foods...I&#39;d be very resentful if dh, instead of gently reminding <br/>
me, was forcing me to eat the way he thought I should.<br/>
