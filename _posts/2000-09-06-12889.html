<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191872744">&lt;&lt;I would love to spend <br/>
<br/>
some time alone with my hubby, I am not will to sacrafice my childrens <br/>
<br/>
happiness or security to do it.  My dh and I have aired out our feeling and <br/>
<br/>
we understand how each other feels (this has taken us awhile to do.  we just <br/>
<br/>
needed effective communication) now we are in a problems solving mode&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
julie,<br/>
i, too was not willing to sacrifice my childrens feelings of security by <br/>
leaving them before they were ready.  i think it is a great place to be <br/>
coming from and your children are very lucky.  wouldnt you agree that the <br/>
stability of our marriages is soo important to that security that our <br/>
children feel?  so the spousal relationship becomes the higher priority -- <br/>
not that both needs cant be satisfied.  in my experience, we have been able <br/>
to BOTH not leave the kids before we were comfortable, AND make special time <br/>
for ourselves.  it is work, but it is worth it!  our marriage partners will <br/>
be around long after our children are grown and gone!  and i believe our <br/>
children will benefit from seeing our relationship flourish.  i encourage you <br/>
to make this a high priority, which it sounds like you already are trying to <br/>
do!  good luck!<br/>

ps i remember a plaque in my parents home that read:  the best thing a father <br/>
can do for his children is to love their mother.</div>
