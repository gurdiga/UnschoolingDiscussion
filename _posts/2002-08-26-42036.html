 Oh, Ren, that sounds AWESOME!!  Remind me what state you&#39;re in again -- I <br/>
wish I could go.  Where will you hold it -- in someone&#39;s house?  Rent a <br/>
community hall?  What other prep are you doing?   Will there be snacks?  What <br/>
are the liability issues?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m looking at a community center that is right on the bay. We meet at <br/>
their park weekly, it&#39;s beautiful. The center has a nice, large basketball <br/>
court and a side room that would be perfect for this type of thing.<br/>
I am going to talk with the guy in charge of renting it to see if we can get <br/>
it for free...I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll work with us. Very nice on the phone.<br/>
Anyway, I haven&#39;t done any other prep yet as it&#39;s still in the planning <br/>
stages. I will encourage everyone to bring a sack lunch and picnic in the <br/>
park and play afterwards.<br/>
I don&#39;t think the liability issues will be important since it&#39;s on city <br/>
property and it&#39;s a voluntary thing. Just the same as when we meet up for <br/>
park day probably.<br/>
I&#39;ll let you know how it progresses. My initial dream, which almost became <br/>
reality before I woke up and realized this was NOT the time in my life, was <br/>
to open a business. It was heavy into the planning stages before I pulled <br/>
out. We were going to have an art store in which people could come and have <br/>
all sorts of materials available to them...canvas, paints, ceramics, wood <br/>
projects etc.....and dabble with different materials. There would be a gift <br/>
shop and a coffee bar with mocha&#39;s, capuccino, Italian soda, cookies etc....<br/>
After I realized it was too much with a baby, I thought I&#39;d approach an art <br/>
gallery about opening a resource room to the public.<br/>
Maybe only have it open three times a week and make loads of art materials <br/>
available, a kiln and what not.  There would have to be funding for it of <br/>
course, don&#39;t know how that would go over.<br/>
Someday when my kids are all growed up I&#39;ll probably start something up!<br/>
In the meantime, the community center will fill the need.<br/>
