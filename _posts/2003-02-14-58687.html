Lynn M. Stuter<br/>
February 12, 2003<br/>
NewsWithViews.com<br/>
&quot;USA Today&quot; carried an article on February 6, 2003, stating that parents in=<br/>
 Lebanon, Pennsylvania, may be among the first in the nation to receive a re=<br/>
port card from their child&#39;s school on &quot;how involved they are in their child=<br/>
&#39;s education.&quot; <br/>
What does the school mean by this? Does the school mean how active is the p=<br/>
arent in overseeing the education of his or her child? It would not appear s=<br/>
o. Further on in the article, school district superintendent, Marianne Bartl=<br/>
ey, is quoted as saying &quot;the goal is to make sure parents are sending their =<br/>
kids to school ready to learn and keeping on top of their academic progress.=<br/>
&quot; <br/>
There&#39;s that nebulous term again: ready-to-learn. How is that defined? Acco=<br/>
rding to the article, one parent stated, &quot;if you take care of your kids, it&#39;=<br/>
ll show up in the report.&quot; <br/>
So, if you take care of your kids, they will be ready-to-learn? Think again=<br/>
. It becomes obvious, in reading the article, that it isn&#39;t the parent defin=<br/>
ing the terms, setting the standards, deciding what constitutes ready-to-lea=<br/>
rn, it is the school. Likewise, it isn&#39;t the parent doing the grading; it is=<br/>
 the school. So actually, what we are talking about here, with parent report=<br/>
 cards, is parents being accountable to the school. <br/>
Remember when the &quot;partnership&quot; concept was pushed: parents in partnership =<br/>
with the school? So, is this how &quot;partnership&quot; is defined: the school sendin=<br/>
g home a report card on how well parents are doing in providing to the schoo=<br/>
l a child deemed by the school to be ready-to-learn? It would appear so. Doe=<br/>
sn&#39;t this, then, make the parent the junior or silent partner in this partne=<br/>
rship? It would appear so. Isn&#39;t this the very concept that Joseph Fields pr=<br/>
esented in his book, &quot;Total Quality for Schools&quot; when he wrote, &quot;Parents lea=<br/>
rn that they must provide the best ready-to-learn student possible&quot;...? Oh d=<br/>
ear you say? Oh dear, indeed! <br/>
When parents objected to the &quot;partnership&quot; concept years ago, at the beginn=<br/>
ing of education reform, their concerns were dismissed as the paranoid ravin=<br/>
gs of the &quot;religious right.&quot; Guess concerned parents were not so paranoid af=<br/>
ter all; guess they had good reason to be concerned. How short our memory; h=<br/>
ow quickly we forget that parents were lied to, made fun of, ridiculed. <br/>
Should parents be &quot;anxious&quot; about these report cards, as the article sugges=<br/>
ted some might be? &quot;Anxious&quot; doesn&#39;t come anywhere close to describing what =<br/>
parental reaction to this should be. Parents should be very concerned and ve=<br/>
ry outraged. Why? <br/>
A child that is deemed not ready-to-learn is considered to be &quot;at risk for =<br/>
failure.&quot; Under Goals 2000 and its peripheral legislation, a child at risk f=<br/>
or failure must be given the help he or she needs to alleviate the at risk f=<br/>
or failure factors. If it is deemed the parent is the problem, is obstructin=<br/>
g or refuses to do what the school deems is necessary &quot;in the interests of t=<br/>
he child,&quot; then intervention by social and health services, even child prote=<br/>
ctive services, is indicated. Either of these agencies can remove a child fr=<br/>
om a home without cause, without warrant, without due process. This is alrea=<br/>
dy happening. <br/>
The long and short of this is that the schools have gained the authority th=<br/>
ey need to force parents to do what they want in the raising and education o=<br/>
f the child. <br/>
Parents should be outraged. Capital switchboards should be jammed with call=<br/>
s from angry parents. Parents should be marching in the streets. This is not=<br/>
hing short of the communist polytechnical system of education in which the c=<br/>
hild is a ward of the state. <br/>
The parental right to oversee the upbringing and education of the child is =<br/>
an inherent, God given right. That means no legislature under our constituti=<br/>
on has the authority, directly or indirectly, to infringe on that right. <br/>
While the &quot;USA Today&quot; article tries to downplay the authority the school ha=<br/>
s been given over the parent, the implications are very clear: <br/>
&quot;... parents who do not live up to any of their responsibilities would be c=<br/>
ontacted by an outreach worker who would try to help them become more involv=<br/>
ed. And parents who cannot or will not cooperate would have an &#39;adult mentor=<br/>
&#39; assigned to their child.&quot; The adult mentor is there in the interests of th=<br/>
e school, not the parent. As such, it is obvious that an adult mentor will c=<br/>
ause alienation of child and parent. <br/>
The article goes on to quote Superintendent Bartley as saying, &quot;If they&#39;re =<br/>
just really resistant, they say, &#39;Get out of my home, go away,&#39; we still hav=<br/>
e a responsibility for that child.&quot; That responsibility includes reporting t=<br/>
he parents to social and health services or child protective services. <br/>
But this won&#39;t happen to you? Don&#39;t bet on it. The list of what constitutes=<br/>
 &quot;at risk for failure&quot; covers the imaginable as well as much that is not. <br/>
The parents in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, whose daughters were given g=<br/>
enital exams by the government school never thought what happened would happ=<br/>
en either. The genital exams were also the outreach of Goals 2000 and readin=<br/>
ess-to-learn. The school was checking the girls to make sure they were not a=<br/>
t risk for failure by having been molested by an adult or parent. It didn&#39;t =<br/>
matter that there was no indication that these girls had been molested. It d=<br/>
idn&#39;t matter that the parents were not notified of the exams, did not give p=<br/>
ermission, were not present when the exams were done. The school was merely =<br/>
acting on the authority given it to ensure nothing stood in the way of the s=<br/>
chool producing &quot;a world class workforce.&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s outrageous? Yes, that&#39;s outrageous. Certainly, it&#39;s outrageous! But =<br/>
parents and citizens need to understand that in dealing with the government =<br/>
schools, they are dealing with a system that sees the child as a &quot;resource&quot; =<br/>
or &quot;human resource&quot; to be conditioned to the perceived environment of the &quot;c=<br/>
reated future&quot;--the sustainable global environment. If the parent gets in th=<br/>
e way, the child will simply be removed to an environment more conducive to =<br/>
the conditioning process. <br/>

That&#39;s like the booga-booga stuff I used to get from HSLDA when I was first <br/>
homeschooling and they assumed they could scare me into joining for my <br/>
immediate PROTECTION.  They told me what to be angry about, who to call, and <br/>
exactly what to say when I got them on the phone.<br/>

Educational reform has been going on in the U.S. since schools were <br/>

in the mid-80&#39;s when the Christian Homeschooling movement got going.<br/>

Just this week, my dentist told me of a case where this happened to him.<br/>
 (And presumably he lives in a ritzy neighborhood with &quot;good&quot; schools.) <br/>
An administrator threatened to call CPS and have his teenage daughter<br/>
*taken away from him* solely because the father argued with the school<br/>
about having his daughter serve an unfair detention.<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone thinks that schools would only use this power and these<br/>
threats discreetly and reasonably, get over that idea real fast.<br/>

<br/>
It sounds like the schools are saying to the parents &quot;you work for us&quot;<br/>
and thinking &quot;and we work for the funding&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In this high pressure system, it seems like no one is working for the kids.<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely true.<br/>
<br/>
One reason I quit teaching was that it wasn&#39;t about kids at all.  It was <br/>
about test scores and competition with other schools for special federal <br/>
funding.  If the funding involved manipulation of numbers so our district was <br/>
shown to be poorer than the next one over so we got more federal funds, fine.<br/>
<br/>
In the budgetary considerations, there are school busses and cafeterias and <br/>
re-roofing contracts and all kinds of truly necessary expenses and <br/>
considerations of making government factory schools work.  But none of the <br/>
decisions look at the kids first.  They&#39;re the product, not the budget and <br/>
not the management, poor things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I worked as a nurse in school clinics and ended up<br/>
quitting because I couldn&#39;t stand anymore how we<br/>
treated the kids.  Everything was done to &quot;help them&quot;,<br/>
but it felt totally false to me (even though done with<br/>
good intentions by a lot of the staff).  Asking kids a<br/>
million questions about their family life,<br/>
&quot;risk-factors&quot; (ie alchohol, drug, food choices),<br/>
grades, and then funneling them to a counselor if they<br/>
fell out of the range we considered &quot;normal&quot;.  <br/>
These poor kids must&#39;ve felt like they were under a<br/>
microscope.  And if they were doing poorly in their<br/>
classes, the assumption was always that it was the<br/>
kid&#39;s (or family&#39;s) fault--not that perhaps the<br/>
classes weren&#39;t relevant to these kids&#39; lives.<br/>
If kids don&#39;t fit the mold there&#39;s something wrong<br/>
with them--they must need counseling, medication etc<br/>
etc--never is there talk that they system they are in<br/>
might be damaging.<br/>
