&lt;&lt; Left hand in your lap, eyes to the front, both feet flat on <br/>
the floor, napkin in lap, no teeth raking, lip smacking, finger licking. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do ask my kids not to suck liquid when they&#39;re drinking and not to bite <br/>
forks.  <br/>
Not to chew with their mouths open (smacking).   That&#39;s about it for table <br/>
manners.  <br/>
<br/>
And those are because they really bother LOTS of people.  And the teeth on <br/>
forks thing is like squeaky chalkboards for me.  The noises that really <br/>
bother some people don&#39;t bother me.  Fingers squeaking balloons, chalk on a <br/>
chalkboard, fingernails on porcelain fixtures.  I tell my kids that those <br/>
sounds DO bother some people, and I&#39;ve heard them ask people in the room <br/>
&quot;Does this noise bother you?&quot; before they play obnoxious balloon noise games. <br/>
  My horror-sounds are nail clippers and people biting forks.  My whole <br/>
nervous system shakes out, down past my fingers.  I have to leave the room if <br/>
it&#39;s going to continue.<br/>

My Tara would drive you out of the house then. Her lips never touch a fork <br/>
or spoon. Not sure where she learned to eat that way but it&#39;s been for a <br/>
very long time now!!<br/>
