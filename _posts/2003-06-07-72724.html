<div id="ygrps-yiv-928381503">Does anyone play &quot;Settlers of Catan?&quot;  I know some high school kids who love it and am debating whether to spend the $38.00.  I have a  9yo boy, 11yo and 14yo girls.  Is it hard to learn?<br/>

It&#39;s a great game.  It&#39;s not hard.  If they like it a WHOLE lot, spring for <br/>
the expansion set, too.  It is pricey, but it&#39;s the price of taking them to the <br/>
movie once, and will last for years.  Probably one of the kids&#39; lifetime (and <br/>
who will get it when they move out?  You might end up buying more than one...)<br/>
