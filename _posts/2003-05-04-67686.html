You mentioned not having to deal with the snakes here, I wonder if it&#39;s where <br/>
you live?<br/>
<br/>
Our first house here was in a rural, wooded area. We were right on the bay <br/>
and it was a wildlife haven. We dealt with snakes regularly. Mostly non <br/>
poisonus, but also a couple of water moccasins and a pygmy rattler.<br/>
I also saw poisonus ones while hiking.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we live in town, I NEVER see snakes. Which surprised me at first, <br/>
because it&#39;s very wooded behind our house and there is a marsh/pond area and <br/>
a creek that empties into the bay. All within a stones throw of the house.<br/>
But being in town must mean that the snakes that have survived development <br/>
are more cautious, or there are just a lot less of them. Or maybe both <br/>
reasons!<br/>
Anyway, if you live in suburbia, it&#39;s doubtful you&#39;ll have to deal with the <br/>
slithery guys very often, if ever.  But they live all over Florida, it&#39;s just <br/>
part of our state.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>
