peers.  So you wind up with peer dependent kids role modeling themselves<br/>
after their peer group which is a highly abnormal and dangerous state of<br/>
affairs given that children don&#39;t really have all they need to guide each<br/>
other. Many of these kids appear very independent but looks are deceiving.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is what bothers me so much about day care - you hear so much about how<br/>
day care fosters independence - but somehow I always thought babies were<br/>
supposed to be dependent!<br/>
<br/>
What I read was about how these very young children are transferring their<br/>
dependence from parents/family to other kids - so what appears to be<br/>
independence isn&#39;t!  Then suddenly they are teenagers and at the place in<br/>
their life when they should be questioning/moving away from parental<br/>
attachment - and with an unhealthy dependence on their peer group and no use<br/>
for their family - and no respect for the value system of their family.<br/>
It&#39;s like they don&#39;t have the parental attachment to balance against the<br/>
peer attachment that would naturally happen at that age  As more and more<br/>
kids are being &quot;raised&quot; by strangers in institutions the problem continues<br/>
to grow.<br/>
<br/>
It also seems like alot of people are eager for their children to be<br/>
independent so they can get on with their owns lives/interests.  Meanwhile<br/>
the kids dangle somewhere in search of a family attachment - and their peer<br/>
group becomes their &quot;family&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bothers me alot - I cared for children in my home for many years - and those<br/>
kids had the advantage of our family as their extended one.  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
their parents realized how attached to me/my family they were and how<br/>
wrenching it was for them when they started school or moved and had to<br/>
seperate from us. Children have always been cared for by people other than<br/>
their parents - but at least in the old &quot;governess&quot; days they were in their<br/>
own home with their siblings instead of being dropped off in an instution<br/>
and warehoused for most of their day.<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell this is one of the things that I get on my soap-box about?<br/>
Thanks, Joel, for the reminder.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-390224102">I have seen this post a bit the last couple of days:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He believes much &quot;independence&quot; that people are so proud of in their<br/>
 </span></blockquote>children is actually displaced dependence which winds up being<br/>
dependence on peers.  So you wind up with peer dependent kids role<br/>

<br/>
No duh looks are deceiving!<br/>
I have seen this post repeated several times, and MAN, I am SO glad<br/>
somebody is on the ball about this false independence thing.  All it is,<br/>
is definitely displaced dependence on peers!<br/>
<br/>
A child desperately needs the love and support of a family.  That is why<br/>
they were born into one.  It is horrific the kind of weird social groups<br/>
that kids create at peer-grouped institutions.  And because these<br/>
institutions are ubiquitous, the majority of people think that they are<br/>
good, despite repeated murders that take place at them, despite the rise<br/>
in young teens having babies as a result of twisted relationships<br/>
spawned at these institutions, despite the verbal cruelty kids dish out<br/>
to one another on a daily basis at public schools, despite the tears of<br/>
kids each day who come home humiliated.  And THIS is our national<br/>
standard of &quot;socialization.&quot; Then God help our society!<br/>
<br/>
I think too many parents are kicking their kids into a world they are in<br/>
no way prepared to deal with at way too young an age.  These kids&#39; role<br/>
models are television characters and mouthy popular kids at school who<br/>
hide their feelings with smart remarks and put downs.  The &quot;real world&quot;<br/>
that homeschoolers supposedly shelter their kids from is NOT real at<br/>
all.  It is largely made up of immature &quot;shunnings,&quot; as well as  poorly<br/>
informed, loudlyvoiced opinions, and celluloid characters whom few know<br/>
yet many adore without question.  There ya go.  There&#39;s &quot;real&quot; for ya!<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooled kids deal with the real world on a daily basis -- a world<br/>
populated with REAL people of all ages.  Homeschooled children know and<br/>
meet people of  all interests, all occupations.  They are not forced<br/>
into a &quot;herd mentality&quot; due to ridicule if you don&#39;t ascribe to the<br/>
popularly held views of your peers.<br/>
<br/>
I know studies have been done that show public school fosters peer<br/>
dependency.  I thought that after the Littleton, Colorado incident we<br/>
would have an awakening and people would see that alienation is a<br/>
dangerous lifestyle to practice.<br/>
<br/>
Instead it brought on a host of paranoid rules -- students must now own<br/>
see-through backpacks, they cannot wear trenchcoats, there are increased<br/>
regulations in appearance and EVEN THOUGHT!!! The thought police are now<br/>
no longer a piece of science fiction!  They are the counselors and<br/>
teachers (even the students) at any public school.  If someone overhears<br/>
you say something, their word is enough to get the police onto your<br/>
case.  Our youth are being raised bereft of fundemental rights and are<br/>
being prepared perfectly to fit into a police state. It&#39;s downright<br/>
scary.<br/>
<br/>
Really, what they needed to do was get kids together and have them<br/>
overcome their prejudices and cruelties practiced against one another.<br/>
The jocks, preppies, goths, druggies, skateboarders, surfers,<br/>
Caucasions, Latinos, Asians, African Americans (African Africans,<br/>
Carribean Africans, etc.)  all just need talk to one another as human<br/>
beings, get over it and get along.<br/>
<br/>
But the structure they are existing in is not likely to foster that kind<br/>
of mentality.  Only a family can do that.  Government rules the masses,<br/>
but love rules the family.<br/>
