Buy the kid a calculator.<br/>
<br/>
Those who care about patterns and numbers and have a facility for  <br/>
that will figure it out, and those who don&#39;t won&#39;t remember anyway.<br/>
<br/>
That said, there&#39;s a pattern to the 9&#39;s.  Write them down in a column  <br/>

  I don&#39;t know any tricks for sevens and eights (others better than I probably do though). But a trick for nines goes like this; write the numbers zero through nine down and then the numbers nine through zero beside those, down as well. Confusing? Looks like this:<br/>

  9 0<br/>

  As you can see, the first number goes up and the second goes down, one each. That is how I learned my nines. Another thing we have fun with is the *School House Rock* DVDs. <br/>

  put your hands in front of you <br/>
  thumbs pointing to thumbs<br/>
  if your fingers were numbered left to right the left pinky would be 1 the right pinky 10<br/>
   <br/>
  example:<br/>
   <br/>
  3x9<br/>
  put down finger #3 (tall finger on right hand <br/>

   <br/>
  there are 2 fingers left on the left side of the down finger and 7 on the right side answer 9x3=27<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  honestly its simple even though these dirrections make it sound a little complicated... try it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343387839">Divisibility Rules:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/wrightj/MA22/Num/DivRule.htm">http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/wrightj/MA22/Num/DivRule.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
The formatting will probably all be gone here, and there&#39;s more at  <br/>

<br/>
Divisibility Rules<br/>
<br/>
How can you tell whether a number is divisible by another number  <br/>
(leaving no remainder) without actually doing the division? Why do  <br/>
&quot;divisibility rules&quot; work?<br/>
<br/>
3<br/>
<br/>
If the sum of the digits is divisible by three, the number is also<br/>
<br/>
4<br/>
<br/>
If the last two digits are divisible by 4, the number is also<br/>
<br/>
5<br/>
<br/>
If the last digit is a 5 or a 0, the number is divisible by 5.<br/>
<br/>
6<br/>
<br/>
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 2, it is also divisible by 6.<br/>
<br/>
7<br/>
<br/>
Take the last digit, double it, and subtract it from the rest of the  <br/>
number; if the answer is divisible by 7 (including 0), then the  <br/>
number is also<br/>
<br/>
8<br/>
<br/>
If the last three digits are divisible by 8, the number is also<br/>
<br/>
9<br/>
<br/>
If the sum of the digits is divisible by 9, the number is also. *This  <br/>
holds for any power of 3<br/>
<br/>
10<br/>
<br/>
If the number ends in 0, it is divisible by 10.<br/>
<br/>
11<br/>
<br/>
Subtract the sum of the even digits from the sum of the odd digits;  <br/>
if the difference, including 0, is divisible by 11, the number is also.<br/>
<br/>
12<br/>
<br/>
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 4, it is also divisible by 12.<br/>
<br/>
13<br/>
<br/>
Delete the last digit from the number, then subtract 9 times the  <br/>
deleted digit from the remaining number. If what is left is divisible  <br/>
by 13, then so is the original number.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do these &#39;rules&#39; work?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dividing by 3<br/>
<br/>
Add up the digits: if the sum is divisible by three, then the number  <br/>
is as well. Examples:<br/>
<br/>
111111: the digits add to 6 so the whole number is divisible by three.<br/>
87687687. The digits add up to 57, and 5 plus seven is 12, so the  <br/>
original number is divisible by three.<br/>
Why does the &#39;divisibility by 3&#39; rule work?<br/>
<br/>
The only way that I can think of to explain this would be as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Look at a 2 digit number: 10a+b=9a+(a+b). We know that 9a is  <br/>
divisible by 3, so 10a+b will be divisible by 3 if and only if a+b is.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, 100a+10b+c=99a+9b+(a+b+c), and 99a+9b is divisible by 3,  <br/>
so the total will be iff a+b+c is.<br/>
<br/>
This explanation also works to prove the divisibility by 9 test. It  <br/>
clearly originates from modular arithmetic ideas, and I&#39;m not sure if  <br/>
it&#39;s simple enough, but it&#39;s the only explanation I can think of.<br/>
<br/>
Doctor Darren, The Math Forum<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dividing by 4 and 8<br/>
<br/>
Since 100, 1000 and so on are multiples of 4, it follows (as for 2)  <br/>
that a number is divisible by 4 if the number represented by its last  <br/>
two digits is a multiple of 4. Example: 3728 is a divisible by 4  <br/>
because 28 is.<br/>
<br/>
Powers of 10 from 1000 on are divisible by 8, therefore it follows  <br/>
that a number is divisible by 8 if the number represented by its last  <br/>
three digits is a multiple of 8. Example: 3728 is a divisible by 8  <br/>
because 728 is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dividing by 11<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s look at 352, which is divisible by 11; the answer is 32. 3+2 is  <br/>
5; another way to say this is that 35 -2 is 33.<br/>
<br/>
Now look at 3531, which is also divisible by 11. It is not a  <br/>
coincidence that 353-1 is 352 and 11 x 321 is 3531.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a generalization of this system. Let&#39;s look at the number  <br/>
94186565.<br/>
<br/>
First we want to find whether it is divisible by 11, but on the way  <br/>
we are going to save the numbers that we use: in every step<br/>
<br/>
we will subtract the last digit from the other digits, then save the  <br/>
subtracted amount in order. Start with<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
9418656 - 5=<br/>
<br/>
9418651<br/>
<br/>
SAVE 5<br/>
<br/>
Then<br/>
<br/>
941865 - 1 =<br/>
<br/>
941864<br/>
<br/>
SAVE 1<br/>
<br/>
Then<br/>
<br/>
94186 - 4 =<br/>
<br/>
94182<br/>
<br/>
SAVE 4<br/>
<br/>
Then<br/>
<br/>
9418 - 2 =<br/>
<br/>
9416<br/>
<br/>
SAVE 2<br/>
<br/>
Then<br/>
<br/>
941 - 6 =<br/>
<br/>
935<br/>
<br/>
SAVE 6<br/>
<br/>
Then<br/>
<br/>
93 - 5 =<br/>
<br/>
88<br/>
<br/>
SAVE 5<br/>
<br/>
Then<br/>
<br/>
8 - 8=<br/>
<br/>
1<br/>
<br/>
SAVE 8<br/>
<br/>
Now write the numbers we saved in reverse order, and we have 8562415,  <br/>
which multiplied by 11 is 94186565.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an even easier method, contributed by Chis Foren:<br/>
<br/>
Take any number, such as 365167484.<br/>
<br/>
Add the 1,3,5,7,..,digits.....3 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 4 = 22<br/>
<br/>
Add the 2,4,6,8,..,digits.....6 + 1 + 7 + 8 = 22<br/>
<br/>
If the difference, including 0, is divisible by 11, then so is the  <br/>
number.<br/>
<br/>
22 - 22 = 0 so 365167484 is evenly divisible by 11.<br/>
<br/>

There were things on there I&#39;d never seen on TV, and Holly especially  <br/>
liked one about getting allowance that went &quot;I get seven-fifty once a  <br/>
week...&quot; and we got it when she was ten, and getting $7.50 a week, so  <br/>
it seemed like just her song. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I should go put that on.  It&#39;s very comforting background music.  And  <br/>
&quot;Conjunction Junction&quot; is a cool song.  Schoolhouse Rock helps with  <br/>
MadLibs.  MadLibs and Schoolhouse Rock make parts of speech make more  <br/>
sense than any schoolbooks ever have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-398685691">That&#39;s pretty cool..I never knew that! I only learned the hand trick for multiplying by 9s about two years ago; you hold up your fingers, and whatever number you&#39;re multiplying by 9, you hold that finger down ie: three, hold down the third finger on your left hand. To the left of that finger is 2 fingers, to the left is 7. The answer is 27. Or 5, tuck in your thumb and you&#39;re left with four fingers to the left and 5 on the right. 45. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113959506">Here is a way to multiply 6 thru 10 by 6 thru 10. You cannot multipy <br/>
5 or below for this method.<br/>
<br/>
Hold your hands up, fingers spread, back of hands facing you, then <br/>
make the fingers face each other. (elbows will be straight out)<br/>
<br/>
6- thumbs<br/>
7- pointers<br/>
8- middle fingers<br/>
9- ring fingers<br/>
10- pinkies<br/>
<br/>
What you are going to do is to touch the 2 fingers that you are <br/>
multiplying. then count the number of fingers from those touching to <br/>
below. that will be your 10&#39;s digit. then count the number of fingers <br/>
above the touching one&#39;s on each side. Multiply the 2 sides together, <br/>
add that to your 1&#39;s digit (or for the funky numbers&lt;see below&gt; add <br/>
the 1&#39;s to the 10&#39;s). Voila there is the answer.<br/>
<br/>
For example: 7x8<br/>
<br/>
right hand pointer touches left hand middle. counting the right hand <br/>
pointer and thumb that&#39;s 2, counting the left hand middle, pointer <br/>
and thumb thats 3.... add 2+3=5.... so 5 is the 10&#39;s digit....<br/>
<br/>
then right hand above those touching is 3 (middle, ring, pinkie) Left <br/>
hand above those touching is 2 (ring & pinkie).... 2x3=6<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
50+6=56   7x8=56<br/>
<br/>
Now sometimes it&#39;s a little funky like 6x6... You would touch your <br/>
two thumbs.... adding up the touching ones and below is only 2.... <br/>
but taking the ones above (4 on each side) 4x4=16... add 16 to 20 <br/>
voila 36.<br/>
<br/>
I tried uploading a picture of a set of gloves I scanned...But as I <br/>
have a new computer I am still learning my way through it I was <br/>
unable use it.<br/>
<br/>
Be Well,<br/>

&quot;math games&quot; was Buzz... where you go around in a circle of people,<br/>
counting, and when someone gets to a multiple of say 7, instead of 7<br/>
you say Buzz.<br/>
<br/>
So, it might go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, buzz, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, buzz, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun to add in numbers (bang, bop, etc.) (and then you sometimes<br/>
have to say more than one word on your turn... playing 7 and 8, for<br/>
example, on 56 you&#39;d say &quot;buzz bang&quot;.<br/>

Has anyone tried the Schoolhouse Rock computer games? Are they any good?<br/>
<br/>
And if it&#39;s not too far off topic, in the theme of getting them what<br/>
they really want, I&#39;m looking at getting a gameboy for dd this<br/>
Christmas, but don&#39;t know the first thing about them. Any<br/>
recommendations for model and/or games?<br/>

I prefer to think that we use numbers to play games, rather than play games to learn numbers.<br/>

We&#39;ve been playing a lot of cribbage lately.  Yesterday in the car, Jackie was manipulating cribbage hands in her head.  She commented that she is getting bored with playing cribbage because she wins most of the time!  Pat (dh) thinks he is cursed by our new cribbage board.  He used to ALWAYS win when we played together, but he hasn&#39;t won a single game on the new board that has 4 tracks.  He has played cribbage for years and the girls just learned how to play a few months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Jackie and I have talked about the way we look for combinations of 15 when we play.  For instance, if I see a 6, 4, and 5, I think, &quot;6+4=10+5=15&quot;.  She thinks, &quot;4+5=9+6=15&quot;.  She also has very interesting ways of calculating numbers in her head - but she is far better at it than I am!  I need paper for more than the simplest calculations.  Someone else suggested the idea, and I tend to agree, that I may be learning disabled from the way I was taught math in school.<br/>

&gt; we&#39;ve been playing Yathzee and well that phase is passing. But  <br/>
&gt; anyway I was<br/>
&gt; wondering what fun and inventive ways you all might have come up  <br/>
&gt; with that<br/>
&gt; worked and was umm cheap? :)   -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My idea was not to worry about it.<br/>
Buy the kid a calculator.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
  Hehe, that was my first thought too, get a calculator.<br/>
   <br/>
  I work as a barista in a drive thru coffee hut. We HAVE to be FAST. When I&#39;m working register I always punch in the amount that the customer gives me and the change amount comes up.<br/>
   <br/>
  There are a few other baristas that used to be waitresses and they make their own change-they always hit amount tendered and do the math in their head.-<br/>
  The customers have complained that they are taking to long, and the owner has found that the nightly deposit is off and has asked that we all punch in the amount given and let the computer make the change amount.<br/>
   <br/>
  calculators. gotta love them.<br/>

We liked them.  We have everything they&#39;ve ever made.  I don&#39;t  believe Will <br/>
has played the games in years, though the Multiplication Rock CD  stays in the <br/>
CD changer in the car.<br/>

But what math is there, besides counting?  You count up from the  amount due <br/>
to the amount tendered.  Check is $4.86...4 cents makes 4.90, a  dime makes $5.<br/>
 <br/>
I really dislike when the servers don&#39;t count the change back.  If  they <br/>
short you, they usually have NO idea how they did it, and then there&#39;s  <br/>
math-under-pressure and frustration in the line behind me.  If the punch in  the wrong <br/>
amount tendered, it gets even MORE confusing.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m all about not having to wait in line longer than I have to, but I also  <br/>
want my server to be competent enough to handle money.  Love calculators,  but <br/>
counting back change is still a necessary skill.<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, when I worked at Wendy&#39;s as a teenager, we had a change dispenser  (most <br/>
still do) and the change figured by the register, but we were still  required <br/>
to count up from the next dollar.  It only makes sense.<br/>
