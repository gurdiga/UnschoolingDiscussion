<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073465978">These are quotes from a couple of Amazon review of a book I&#39;m  ordering.  A <br/>
different review from either of these said the historical  section should&#39;ve <br/>
been longer, which I took to mean the historical section was  good so I&#39;m <br/>
ordering it.  But I thought of this list when I read this first  bit, and I&#39;ve <br/>
included the negative comment so people won&#39;t buy it just because  of the first <br/>
good review.  <br/>
 <br/>
The book is The Compleat Gentleman: The Modern Man&#39;s Guide to Chivalry, by  <br/>
Brad Miner.  (I&#39;m getting it from Quality Paperback, for a friend of  mine.)<br/>
 <br/>
==============too much buildup, but here comes the good  part:==============<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Mr. Miner does not take the &quot;Etiquette&quot; by Emily Post approach to the  <br/>
subject. A gentleman does not follow a checklist of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. No  checklist <br/>
can address every circumstance in which the gentleman may find  himself. <br/>
 <br/>
Rather, the author attempts to show the aspiring gentleman how he should  <br/>
think, for if a man understands the principles that inform gentlemanly behavior,  <br/>
he will need no checklist. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
======<br/>
Reading this book was as interesting as reading the  geneologies listed in <br/>
the Bible. Every now and then a good nugget of information  would appear, then <br/>
back to the begatting. Being much more history than a guide,  the recent grad <br/>
will have dropped this book long before the necessity of its  contents could be <br/>
appreciated. I was looking for situational based advice and  lessons from <br/>
another voice and found this source lacking.<br/>
<br/>
=================================<br/>
 <br/>
AHA! (oh, this is Sandra again)<br/>
 <br/>
I just noticed the complainant DID miss the point, and is complaining  that <br/>
the book didn&#39;t give &quot;situational based advice.&quot;  The advice to become  a good <br/>
guy and develop some principles wasn&#39;t good advice for him.  &lt;g&gt;  (Maybe.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t read it.)<br/>

Well, how will he *LEARN* if he doesn&#39;t have RULES to follow?!<br/>
 <br/>
He needs rules. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
