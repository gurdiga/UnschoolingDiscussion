<div id="ygrps-yiv-970663000">I&#39;ll start off by saying I feel like a real poop!!!<br/>
<br/>
My Sierra is very sensitive. Some of you may remember awhile ago me talking about how she would sometimes cry and get so worked up over what seemed like nothing to the rest of us. She would really lose it. Well some of you here helped me try and understand what it must be like for her and we have thankfully ended those crying jags and overwhelmed moments. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still very sensitive about certain things, especially when it comes to any kind of injury or the slightest bit of discomfort. We work with that and are also doing well.<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s the me being a poop part. She has this tooth, front upper tooth that is very loose. She has lost 2 bottom and the other front tooth, latest one just like last week. I actually pulled it for her. It takes her awhile to want it out. I have been patient, never pull unless she says to do it and I let her know I will try. I try once and if she says no more, than no more. <br/>
<br/>
Last week, after the first top tooth came out, the next one seemed even looser than that one. I tried to get it out, it was in there much more than I expected and she decided not to try again. (she doesn&#39;t want to ge them out herself) So far everything okay. <br/>
<br/>
This tooth is still hanging there. I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s still there. She can&#39;t eat right, talk right or brush her teeth right. The permanent tooth is already in behind it. I don&#39;t know what it is about this situation that has me so anal. She doesn&#39;t want this tooth out. No big deal, it&#39;s bound to come out eventually. <br/>
<br/>
My problem is why I&#39;m so darn anal about this that I can&#39;t let it go and leave her alone. It&#39;s a stupid little tooth!!! Tonight I actually got upset with her for crying about not wanting it pulled. How stupid is that? Don&#39;t answer. I plan on talking to her tomorrow morning and apologizing to her for what I said or how I made her feel. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m wondering why such a back slide over something so small? I am so easy going with the kids and am usually the one to calm situations if my husband gets a little antsy over something. Tonight it was the other way around. I&#39;m just wondering why this bothers me so much and although I won&#39;t let it happen again, I&#39;m worried that something else might make me react the same way. This just doesn&#39;t seem like me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407171878">Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself!  I bet your desire is to make her <br/>
comfortable.  I bet it would bother you to have a loose tooth hanging <br/>
like that in your mouth.  I bet it doesn&#39;t bother her.  You probably <br/>
can&#39;t understand how she could be more comfortable with the tooth <br/>
hanging there than to have you try to get it out.  Just keep telling <br/>
yourself that your goal is to make her comfortable and that what <br/>
makes her comfortable is different than what makes you comfortable.  <br/>
She can be comfortable without having her loose tooth pulled just <br/>
like kids can learn without doing workbooks.  Different strokes for <br/>
different folks. :) <br/>
<br/>
Know that there are many of us who would rather have a loose tooth <br/>
hang there for months than let someone pull it out.  I definitely <br/>
fall into that category!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170732796">Mary, I know exactly how you feel.  I&#39;ve had similar reactions over loose <br/>
teeth.  I know, its just a little tooth, it will come on out it own, etc etc <br/>
etc.. And, I HAVE gotten much much better with each child.  I&#39;m thinking back to <br/>
when Landon and Anna lost thier baby teeth and I obsessed over it so much.  The <br/>
only thing I can attribute it to ( and I know this is no &quot;excuse&quot;, just an <br/>
explanation), is just the sight of that tooth, HANGING there, barely held on.  <br/>
You just keep thinking.. &quot;oh oh, I can get it.. I can get, it will only take a <br/>
tug.. its SOOOO loose!.&quot;   Its the same feeling I get when I see an annoying <br/>
bug just hovering, posing, waiting, BEGGING for me to SMACK! it.    I am the <br/>
same way with zits and stuff.. I just have to squeeze them. ( on myself, I mean) <br/>
  The loose tooth is an attractive nuisance .. lol.    You see the kid being <br/>
bothered by it and you think,  oh, just let me get ahold of it.. come on, it <br/>
will only take a second...  <br/>
<br/>
The best way I got over being annoyed by a hanging on tooth was to just try <br/>
to ignore it.    I would keep telling myself, it will fall out, it will just <br/>
fall out.. be patient.   And, I would often remind myself that the tooth was <br/>
bothering ME a lot more than it was the kid.   Now, IF and WHEN the kid wanted <br/>
the tooth out, if they asked me to help them get it out, I found a great way to <br/>
pull teeth.  Get a dry hand towel, cover your hand with it and then get ahold <br/>
of the tooth.    The kid has so much towel in his mouth, and they can hardly <br/>
feel you getting the tooth.  When the tooth is so loose its just hanging there, <br/>
all you really have to do is get a grip on it.with the towel and it comes <br/>
out.  And the towel soaks up any blood or slobber.   Usually my kids don&#39;t even <br/>
know I have pulled the tooth.  They actually liked this method so much that <br/>
sometimes they asked me to pull thier tooth when it got really loose.    But, my <br/>
kids have lost many more &quot;on thier own&quot; by biting an apple, jumping on the <br/>
trampoline, wrestling with thier siblings, .. that loose tooth would just fall <br/>
out in the normal process of living and playing.  <br/>

LOL!! Thanks Sheila. I had a hard time sleeping last night. I was really<br/>
upset and couldn&#39;t wait until Sierra woke up so I could talk to her. She<br/>
came bounding in this morning to my bed like nothing happened at all last<br/>
night. The ohter kids were out and about the house so we had a chance to<br/>
really talk. She was fine with the whole thing and acted like it was no big<br/>
deal. I think too, after thinking very long about it, I am projecting some<br/>
of my own problems with my gums, because of not going to the dentist, on to<br/>
her teeth. Silly. I think I have a guilty conscious. I feel so much better<br/>
today and will remember this for future reference. It&#39;s all about her and<br/>
last night, well it wasn&#39;t.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I can guarantee that something will make you respond the same way (or<br/>
another, new creative way) again, and you&#39;ll be disappointed about it. &#39;Cuz<br/>
sometimes<br/>
we&#39;re all jerks. But we can all apologize.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Thanks Kathryn.......I think. No really , thanks!<br/>

Teresa, you made me laugh. You sound like Tara when she sees a pimple....on<br/>
anyone, she doesn&#39;t care!!! She&#39;s ran after Joe quite a few times wanting to<br/>
&quot;get it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And yes I think that is a part of. I&#39;m reminded of that damn tooth every<br/>
time Sierra looks at me. Since the other front one is gone and this one is<br/>
soooo loose, it&#39;s about in the middle of her mouth turned sideways. She<br/>
looks like snaggle tooth. But really doesn&#39;t even care about that. She talks<br/>
funny and has a hard time brushing around there. And although it certainly<br/>
hasn&#39;t stopped her from eating, (she&#39;s on her 2nd bagel so far this morning)<br/>
it takes her forever to do it. And I guess just see it as so much easier to<br/>
just pull it out and it&#39;s over with. Tara keeps reminding her that the kids<br/>
get 3 bucks for a top front tooth!!! She doesn&#39;t care!<br/>
<br/>
Tara pulled all her own teeth. She would sit up on the bathroom counter with<br/>
a paper towel and not get down until that tooth was out. She made me cringe<br/>
a few times!! Joseph, as soon as they were loose enough to bother him would<br/>
come and ask me to pull them. I&#39;m thinking already that Alyssa will knock<br/>
hers out before their time!!! (she feel off her step stool today)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for understanding and the light moment.<br/>
