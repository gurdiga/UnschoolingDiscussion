<div id="ygrps-yiv-108120737">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know of book that would exist to cover the above topic?  I have<br/>
been asked to track down such a book that would cover the unique situations<br/>
that exist for such families.  I&#39;m sure there are homeschooling books around<br/>
that have chapters on this (if there are, I would be interested in knowing<br/>
about these, too) but in searching Amazon.com I have been unable to find a<br/>
complete book on this subject.  If you can help, please email me privately<br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:blondie@...">blondie@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

I don&#39;t think there is one.<br/>
<br/>
The HEM (Home Education Magazine) message boards used to have a folder<br/>
devoted to this topic.  It&#39;s probably still there.<br/>
