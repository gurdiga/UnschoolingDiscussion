<div id="ygrps-yiv-920392312">Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling for 6 years, this is the 6th.  I have a dd <br/>
in the 11th grade, a ds in the 5th grade, a ds who will be 4 in April <br/>
and a dd who is 17 months old.  I stumbled across this list in search <br/>
of answers to the problem of getting ds (10) to do &quot;school&quot;.  He is a <br/>
child with many &quot;problems&quot;.  He has problems with anger and <br/>
frustrations and dealing with disappointments.  I think, looking <br/>
back, it might be because of trying to get him to do &quot;school&quot; the way <br/>
everyone sees school and does homeschool, for the most part.  he <br/>
hates worksheets and doesn&#39;t do well under the pressure of a test.  <br/>
He has a hard time focusing, too.  Except on video games!  He is very <br/>
stuborn and so am I, so we tend to clash, wonder why!  DH is telling <br/>
me I need to put him in public school so he can get an education and <br/>
get him out of the house for awhile.  I am waring inside myself about <br/>
it.  Everything in me says NO.  Except for the fact that I might have <br/>
some time without having to deal with his behavior.  But, here is a <br/>
thought....<br/>
<br/>
What if unschooling is the answer?  What if the pressure was off and <br/>
he just did the things he liked to do and wanted to do.  How do I <br/>
unschool myself?  It eats me up it they aren&#39;t doing something!  How <br/>
do you unschool a teenager, too?  I want her to have a good education <br/>
and she was in PS for the first four and 1/4 years of her school <br/>
years.  So that school stuff is in her head, too.  Will his behavior <br/>
get better if he is enjoying life instead of being hounded about <br/>
school all day long?  Do I give him a list of responsiblities around <br/>
the house (he doesn&#39;t have a formal list right now, I just assign <br/>
stuff)and let him do &quot;real life&quot; stuff to get him to learn things <br/>
without him thinking it is school?  <br/>
<br/>
I know I am asking so many questions and seem so confused, too <br/>
confused to have done this for so many years, but I am none the less, <br/>
asking for your help.  I love my children so much and I feel that if <br/>
I put my ds in PS, I will be failing him and setting him up for so <br/>
many things I don&#39;t want for him.  He soaks up other peoples likes <br/>
and dislikes, to a certain extent.  He has a friend that he met a <br/>
year ago and he has aquired his laugh, much to my dismay.  It is not <br/>
an attractive laugh.  He has aquired some other bad qualities from <br/>
him and I am afraid he will get much more from other kids at school.  <br/>
I just don&#39;t know what to tell my dh about all this.  He thinks I <br/>
just won&#39;t listen to him when he suggests things.  NO, just not <br/>
that.  I know I am rambling.  Please forgive me.  I am at my wits end <br/>
over this.  Thanks for listening and for your help in advance.<br/>

<br/>
Well, obviously there are people who think it IS the answer! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
School at home is harsh, because the kids can&#39;t go home at the end of the day <br/>
and get away from it.<br/>
<br/>
If the pressure is off, at first he will revel in what might seem like doing <br/>
nothing, just like June and July after a big schoolyear.  That&#39;s natural.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something about deschooling yourself:<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Will his behavior <br/>

<br/>
I think so.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do I give him a list of responsiblities around <br/>
the house &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;. . .and let him do &quot;real life&quot; stuff to get him to learn things <br/>
without him thinking it is school?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re thinking of &quot;real life stuff&quot; as housework, I wouldn&#39;t.  I would <br/>
take him places without pressure to &quot;learn&quot; or report (museums, movie, new <br/>
and different stores or restaurants), just hang out with him.  Do things <br/>
together.  Consider reading these two articles:<br/>

What I meant by real life learning was teaching him how to cook and make up<br/>
menus and such, shopping for that menu, having an assigned day that he does<br/>
the meal planning and cooking?  Things like that.  I have been reading many<br/>
posts on the unschool.com message boards and getting lots of insites.  I<br/>
have much to think and pray about.  I know what my heart is telling me, I<br/>
just have to figure out a way to get dh to understand it.  Thanks for the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pam Sorooshian often recommends The Explosive Child. Here&#39;s what she wrote<br/>
about it:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Another book I liked even more than [Raising Your Spirited Child] was:<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; (From their website) -- The Explosive Child is the<br/>
&gt;&gt; internationally acclaimed book by Dr. Ross Greene that provides a more<br/>
&gt;&gt; contemporary conceptualization of inflexible, easily frustrated, explosive<br/>
&gt;&gt; children, and describes a new, practical, comprehensive approach for helping<br/>
&gt;&gt; these children at home and school. This approach Â­ called the Collaborative<br/>
&gt;&gt; Problem Solving Approach -- is aimed at decreasing adversarial parent-child<br/>
&gt;&gt; interactions, reducing family hostility, and improving children&#39;s capacities<br/>
&gt;&gt; for flexibility, frustration tolerance, communication, and self-regulation.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; he hates worksheets and doesn&#39;t do well under the pressure of a test. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; He has a hard time focusing, too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your husband daily made you do things you hate, how well would you deal<br/>
with it? How well would you focus? Being upset because you&#39;re being forced<br/>
to do something doesn&#39;t require &quot;many &#39;problems&#39;&quot;. It should be normal! But<br/>
our society trains us and our kids to believe that kids have a problem if<br/>
they protest doing things that they dislike and see as useless. :-/<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What if unschooling is the answer?  What if the pressure was off and he just<br/>
&gt; did the things he liked to do and wanted to do. .  How do I unschool myself?<br/>
&gt; It eats me up it they aren&#39;t doing something!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if your husband had an agenda for you, and a goal that he wanted you to<br/>
reach? What if regardless of how he explained it and how much he believed in<br/>
it, it made no sense to you? What if he watched over you and judged what you<br/>
were doing against his standards of what was worthwhile for you to do? What<br/>
if you felt his eyes on you as you turned on the TV for your favorite show,<br/>
and you knew he prefered you to be reading something educational or doing<br/>
housework? What if he thought the meals his mother cooked were the best for<br/>
a family and your ideas were worth less?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Will his behavior<br/>
&gt; get better if he is enjoying life instead of being hounded about<br/>
&gt; school all day long?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would your behavior improve if you were enjoying life and not being hounded<br/>
by your husband for not sticking to the agenda he felt it was important for<br/>
you to follow?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do I give him a list of responsiblities around<br/>
&gt; the house (he doesn&#39;t have a formal list right now, I just assign<br/>
&gt; stuff)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They aren&#39;t really responsibilities if someone imposes them on us.<br/>
Responsibilities are things we feel are important to us and accept for<br/>
ourselves and own. *His* responsibilities are living a joyful life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and let him do &quot;real life&quot; stuff to get him to learn things<br/>
&gt; without him thinking it is school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think one of the big hurdles of unschooling is letting go of the idea that<br/>
we need to get them to some place that we think they need to be. We think we<br/>
need to get them to understand math, for instance, so we try to think of<br/>
&quot;natural&quot; ways to get them from where they are to where we want them to be.<br/>
<br/>
So part of unschooling is letting go of that and trusting that people will<br/>
learn what they need when they need it. Learning is not artificial. It comes<br/>
from needing something. If someone doesn&#39;t need to know something, then why<br/>
should they learn it?<br/>
<br/>
You probably don&#39;t need to know about Mongolian history. But if you needed<br/>
to know, wouldn&#39;t you learn it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I meant by real life learning was teaching him how to cook and make up<br/>
&gt; menus and such, shopping for that menu, having an assigned day that he does<br/>
&gt; the meal planning and cooking?  Things like that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those can all be part of unschooling if *he* thinks they&#39;re fun.<br/>
<br/>
But rather than thinking in terms of finding things he could learn from,<br/>
learn yourself to see the things he learns in what *he* does. And do things<br/>
because they&#39;re enjoyable not because the kids could learning something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know what my heart is telling me, I<br/>
&gt; just have to figure out a way to get dh to understand it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you could print out all your emails and the replies for him to read.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he WANTS to learn to cook and he really might enjoy having a day to <br/>
cook---sure. If it&#39;s just a way to get him to &quot;do&quot; math, no. <br/>
<br/>
My son likes Japanese sushi maki, so we did all the shopping ( and playing) <br/>
in the oriental market, and he made supper one night. Now he knows how, and <br/>
if we&#39;re ever in the mood for maki, he volunteers to make it.<br/>
<br/>
He loves Emeril Legasse (I like his food, but not his show)---and everything <br/>
cajun. We have 4-5 of his cookbooks. Cameron will occasionally concoct a <br/>
cajun supper for us---either from thumbing through the books or watching the <br/>
show late at night.<br/>
<br/>
At one time he ASKED that we each have a night to cook---an &quot;assigned&quot; night. <br/>
That was pretty cool! Then one day HIS night rolled around and he asked, &quot;Can <br/>
I make anything I want?&quot;  &quot;Sure.&quot;  He &quot;made&quot; a reservation! &lt;g&gt;  It lasted as <br/>
long as he was interested. He&#39;ll still cook when he wants to because he likes <br/>
to. But if I had made him stick to his &quot;assigned&quot; cooking night, he MIGHT <br/>
have learned to hate to cook. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the same way: I LOVE to cook but if I don&#39;t feel like it, I can always <br/>
say, &quot;Call Domino&#39;s&quot; ---or &quot;Get your shoes on, we&#39;re going out to eat.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177057374">***He has problems with anger and <br/>
frustrations and dealing with disappointments.***<br/>
<br/>
Man, so do I.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
Ten is pretty young to have anger and frustration and disappointment.   I<br/>
avoid it if I can but I have the luxury of being old enough to tell<br/>
people who are trying to make me angry or frustrated or disappointed to<br/>
take a hike.   Mostly kids aren&#39;t given the freedom to express themselves<br/>
when they feel things are unfair or mean or too boring or dreadful.  <br/>
Mostly parents are trying to raise nice children who won&#39;t talk back and<br/>
what happens is they feel they have no voice and then those emotions that<br/>
they can&#39;t put into words get released some other way.   Your son at ten<br/>
is a great communicator.   You as a grown up now need to listen.<br/>
<br/>
***  DH is telling <br/>
me I need to put him in public school so he can get an education and <br/>
get him out of the house for awhile. ***<br/>
<br/>
Does your son want to go to school?<br/>
<br/>
***What if unschooling is the answer?  What if the pressure was off and <br/>
he just did the things he liked to do and wanted to do.  How do I <br/>
unschool myself?  It eats me up it they aren&#39;t doing something!  How <br/>
do you unschool a teenager, too?  I want her to have a good education <br/>
and she was in PS for the first four and 1/4 years of her school <br/>
years.  So that school stuff is in her head, too.  Will his behavior <br/>
get better if he is enjoying life instead of being hounded about <br/>
school all day long? ***<br/>
<br/>
Have you been able to read much about unschooling?  Some people come to<br/>
unschooling because their school at home life is so stressful, but they<br/>
don&#39;t really understand the philosophy and have a hard time with what<br/>
unschooling really is.   The more you can educate yourself about it, and<br/>
this list can help, the more ways you will see that it can be wonderful<br/>
for your kids.    My own son is ten and I have to run to keep up with his<br/>
interests.  He&#39;s always doing something and if you can get away from the<br/>
idea that text books and worksheets are the &quot;somethings&quot; they need to be<br/>
doing you&#39;ll be able to see the things they enjoy and you&#39;ll be able to<br/>
help them find ways to do those things.   <br/>
<br/>
***Do I give him a list of responsiblities around <br/>
the house (he doesn&#39;t have a formal list right now, I just assign <br/>
stuff)and let him do &quot;real life&quot; stuff to get him to learn things <br/>
without him thinking it is school? ***<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t.   Talk with him and tell him you think maybe he&#39;s just<br/>
amazing.   Tell him you want him to be happy.   Tell him you want him to<br/>
do the things he loves to do and not worry about school work.  Tell him<br/>
he&#39;s so darn smart he doesn&#39;t need that stuff.   Help him find wonderful<br/>
things to do and interesting people to talk to.  Let his job be being a<br/>
kid.  <br/>
<br/>
***He soaks up other peoples likes <br/>
and dislikes, to a certain extent.  He has a friend that he met a <br/>
year ago and he has aquired his laugh, much to my dismay.  It is not <br/>
an attractive laugh.  He has aquired some other bad qualities from <br/>
him and I am afraid he will get much more from other kids at school.***<br/>
<br/>
He might see his friend as an interesting person and himself as not so<br/>
much.   You can help him do things he loves to do and in his own eyes<br/>
become an interesting person.   He won&#39;t be as inclined to adopt the<br/>
interesting qualities of others if he&#39;s satisfied with the kind of person<br/>
he is.   His life needs to be bigger and he needs more opportunity to<br/>
find out how cool he really is.   <br/>
<br/>
I just told someone who is trying to figure out unschooling to live each<br/>
day with her kids like she was on a three day vacation in Rome.  If you<br/>
had three days in Rome what would you do?   Would you sit in your hotel<br/>
and make your kids do worksheets about the Vatican or would you get out<br/>
there and see stuff and talk to people and sample the food and touch<br/>
everything you could and jump fully into Rome?<br/>
<br/>
Ten year olds want to do stuff.  Not yucky, boring school stuff.  Cool<br/>
stuff.  Think like a ten year old and if you need ideas, I&#39;ll ask my son<br/>
because he&#39;s always doing stuff. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

&lt;&lt; If he WANTS to learn to cook and he really might enjoy having a day to <br/>
cook---sure. If it&#39;s just a way to get him to &quot;do&quot; math, no.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly and I were playing Five Crowns with a friend of ours who&#39;s a <br/>
statistician professionally, and very mathish.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a good scorekeeper, and I don&#39;t like to keep score.  I asked who <br/>
wanted to and Holly volunteered.   I&#39;m 49 and embarrassed to make a <br/>
scorekeeping mistake in front of ANYBODY.  Holly&#39;s 11 and has no fear.<br/>
<br/>
When ONCE Annealiese looked over and pointed out an error of 20 points to <br/>
Holly, Holly said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly told us that when she plays Harry Potter with the homeschooling group, <br/>
some of the parents don&#39;t like her stating how much damage is done by a <br/>
certain card.  She said &quot;If I say &#39;that&#39;s seven against me,&#39; the moms look at <br/>
me like I should have let them figure it out.  They want them to play Harry <br/>

Holly couldn&#39;t read well enough to play those kinds of games a year or so <br/>
ago.  Now she can.  But she doesn&#39;t see it as something people should do for <br/>
the purpose of learning, but for the purpose of playing!!  She happily helps <br/>
other players because people have always happily helped her.<br/>

Cooking is exactly like playing Harry Potter. &lt;g.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Play video games!  Do I let him? That just doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  I am<br/>
going in search of some books, The Teenage Liberation Handbook, The<br/>
Unschooling Handbook, Learning all the time, How children learn, and How<br/>
Children Fail. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of How Children Learn and How Children Fail, look for some of  John <br/>
Holt&#39;s later books, after he gave up on school reform and started writing <br/>
about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find it, get &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not necessarily the particular activity that matters at any given <br/>
moment. It&#39;s the path of learning and exploration that the child is on. <br/>
Video games can indeed lead to other things, besides being way more mentally <br/>
stimulating than we parents give them credit for. Here&#39;s link to an article <br/>
