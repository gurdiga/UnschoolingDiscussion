<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743890788">Actually, these are bigger than damage counters. They&#39;re about an inch and a <br/>
quarter across.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We buy some that are smaller than that....more like the damage counter size. <br/>
We keep them for vases, but more importantly the damage counters and <br/>
MANCALA!!  They&#39;re perfect for Mancala replacements after babsy boy spreads <br/>
them everywhere.<br/>
