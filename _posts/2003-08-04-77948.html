<div id="ygrps-yiv-561973399">Just wondering,  <br/>
<br/>
Madeline and others familiar with Atlanta,     have you ever been to the Center for Puppetry Arts?<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at things to do when we are there (before the conference)  and saw they are performing Alice in Wonderland while we are there.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if it is worth going to?   It looks really cool.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971832467">Yes, we have been, actually just last weekend to a Birthday party there.  It is really good, some better than others of course.  Maybe we could go with you.  Meet you there?  How old are your kids?  Mine are 6 and 3.  Plus we&#39;ll have visiting cousins that are 3-8.  Email me if you are interested.  We could maybe get a group rate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711308867">Well,  Kelli, i guess we aren&#39;t supposed to meet up via personal E-mail.  Mine to you was returned as well.  Wierd.   I wrote that I don&#39;t want to bust into your trip to the Puppet Center.  I think I&#39;m just so eager to meet other unschoolers; and I had just read a brochure form the Center for Puppetry Arts right before reading your E-mail.  Anyway, I can give you other ideas as well of things to do in Atlanta depending on your kids&#39; ages, if you are interested.  You can try my other E-mail -  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:madnic@...">madnic@...</a> <br/>
