<div id="ygrps-yiv-382861829">=-His  response is <br/>
usually to ask to do something he *knows* I can&#39;t do while  nursing. It&#39;s <br/>
very antagonistic - almost as if he&#39;s *looking* for a reason  to get mad.=&#92;=<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
 <br/>
People with a high level of frustration or free-floating anxiety DO look  for <br/>
other things to blame it on.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Question: If I try to avert possibly volatile situations and tip-toe  <br/>
around <br/>
him, will he learn to handle frustration? -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Absolutely.<br/>
 <br/>
My  mother in law told us once that we needed to frustrate our  children so <br/>
they would learn to deal with frustration.   She&#39;s plenty  of frustration for <br/>
us all. &lt;bwg&gt;  There are real frustrations.   No sense welcoming more.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- Or will he just learn that Mommy <br/>
will &quot;make everything ok?&quot;  Example:  He knows that I know the *right* way <br/>
to cut/prepare his food.  So when Dad has to make his food, he lashes out <br/>
and insists Mommy has to do  it.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Tell dad the right way, or do it yourself until he&#39;s older.<br/>
He&#39;ll get over it.<br/>
 <br/>
But the self-image of himself as a lashing-out kid, and your responses to  <br/>
it, and the stories that will probably be told forevermore are harmful to  him.  <br/>
Help him be happy.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Doesn&#39;t he need to learn that he can not *always* be the center of  <br/>
attention?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
He is the center of his universe.<br/>
Is.<br/>
 <br/>
If you draw him close to the center of yours, it might help.<br/>
 <br/>
I was a firstborn and I resented my sister&#39;s coming BIGTIME.  My  mother <br/>
mishandled it in the extreme.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I mean, my husband and I can&#39;t hold all our conversations until <br/>
he  goes to bed in hopes that this will head off an outburst.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Not for 15 more years you can&#39;t, but for a few months you  can.<br/>
 <br/>
FIRST see to him.  While he&#39;s fed, comfortable, and has been heard,  THEN <br/>
have your conversation. Maybe try to include him.<br/>
 <br/>
My husband used to start TOTALLY adult conversations in the car when there  <br/>
was a kid or two there.  I finally explained to him how shut out then and  <br/>
bored the kids get, and how we&#39;re not together anymore once the kids zone out  <br/>
because he&#39;s talking about refinancing the mortgage or something.    <br/>
Conversations that can&#39;t involve kids probably should take place in their  absence.<br/>
