<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008575866">&quot;I do think <br/>
that unschooling will prepare them for that independence. I went to <br/>
public school, and from personal experience I can say that naturally <br/>
I am a very independent person, but when I was ready to leave my <br/>
parents house and when I was prepared to, differed greatly because <br/>
of my inexperience with the daily life tasks that would be necessary <br/>

I agree.  And wish to add that school was like a crutch for me.  I understood it and was decent at it.  Now in adulthood, even to this day, I find myself wanting more direction from other people for MY life.  I know how to cook and other basic things, but i really don&#39;t understand life as much as i need too.  I don&#39;t understand myself as much as i need too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300132873">I have that experience also. School is a babysitter until you <br/>
graduate, then you&#39;re on your own. So in a way you become dependent <br/>
upon a system to feel comfort, security, successful, accepted.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This is true for me; I have spent my &quot;adult&quot; life figuring out just <br/>
who I am.  I was defined growing up in two ways: there was the <br/>
identity I had within my dysfunctional and heavily emotionally <br/>
abusive family, and the identity I was given by teachers and peers <br/>
within the &quot;school&quot; structure.  With both identities, achievement <br/>
and good behavior were key.  <br/>
<br/>
The most difficult part for me as a mo so far is to not pass that <br/>
identity on to my children.  My kids tend to hit landmarks earlier <br/>
than other kids and also be pretty well-behaved (well, my first was <br/>
what you would call &quot;well-behaved&quot;); this of course made me feel <br/>
like a &quot;good mom.&quot;  About a year ago I realized how hard I was <br/>
pushing my daughter to learn; how much pride I was getting from the <br/>
things she *achieved,* and that understanding is what led me to the <br/>
idea of unschooling.  I&#39;ve just started a book called &quot;don&#39;t push <br/>
your preschooler.&quot;  My husband was pointing out that Orion doesn&#39;t <br/>
do a lot of what Morgaine did at his age, naming colors and shapes, <br/>
reciting the alphabet, identifying letters.  It made me happy.  He&#39;s <br/>
enjoying his babyhood -- not that Morgaine didn&#39;t enjoy hers, but he <br/>
has more freedom just to *be.*  Isaac, at 7 wks, is also benefitting <br/>
from my learning -- he hasn&#39;t rolled over yet -- because he hasn&#39;t <br/>
been put down long enough.  I don&#39;t feel the pressure to give <br/>
him &quot;tummy time&quot; so he can learn to crawl and roll like I did the <br/>
other two.  <br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it wonderful to be able to step back sometimes and just see?<br/>
