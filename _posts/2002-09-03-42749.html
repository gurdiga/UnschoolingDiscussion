&gt; I&#39;m  thinking that&#39;s okay and that I should be grateful that we have <br/>
&gt; agreement to homeschool because *I* want to and believe in it so much (with <br/>
&gt; conditions).  I like the idea of posting quotes...it would serve a purpose <br/>
&gt; for inspiring me and if it goes beyond that, then great!  The conditions <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; that our children be prepared to enter ps if it becomes necessary....cover <br/>
&gt; same learning objectives as ps.  Just got to figure out how to do this in <br/>
&gt; unschooly kind of way.  Please don&#39;t say its impossible! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to all,<br/>
&gt; Robin<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dear Robin,<br/>
Yes, you probably will be the one doing the reading. That&#39;s okay. I do wonder <br/>
about these &quot;conditions&quot; though. The one thing about unschooling I have tried <br/>
to stress to Darin is that the kids will learn better this way (as opposed to <br/>
the rigors of a ps curriculum.) but for him not to expect them to pick up a <br/>
math book or ask for a history book. He says he understands, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think he does. I know that if Moly *had* to go to school starting tomorrow, <br/>
she would be ages ahead of the other kids (I think third grade?) in reading, <br/>
but miles behind in math. She would be all over the place with everything <br/>
else. Moly knows tons about the human body, but I don&#39;t think a typical third <br/>
grade curriculum covers that. So although she knows some *science* the <br/>
teacher would probably assume we never studied any science at all. (true and <br/>
not true at the same time.) Moly could name many constellations, and knows <br/>
all sorts of things about the planets. But if that wasn&#39;t what the teacher <br/>
was teaching at the time, she wouldn&#39;t be able to appreciate Moly&#39;s <br/>
knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
My husband Darin thinks homeschooling is a fine idea. (But) I get the <br/>
impression that he isn&#39;t too sure about all this *free learning*. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
say much, but every now and then he will make a small comment. Usually it <br/>
goes something like this. Moly is counting out her money. She has a pile of <br/>
change and some paper bills. She announces she has four dollars, 7 quarters, <br/>
18 nickels, 5 dimes and 143 pennies. Darin says &quot;how much is that?&quot; and Moly <br/>
says, &quot;I just said how much I have.&quot; Darin will look at me, I am sure you <br/>
know that look. &lt;g&gt; and try to give Moly this 5 minute math lesson on how to <br/>
count her money. The first problem that comes up is she isn&#39;t wanting a <br/>
lesson on counting money. Then there is the problem that she doesn&#39;t know how <br/>
to add large numbers. So he tries to describe how to carry the one. She <br/>
doesn&#39;t get that so he tries to tell her about number placement. It goes on <br/>
and on and Moly gets bored and upset that her Dad isn&#39;t impressed with the <br/>
amount of money she has saved, rather he wants to turn everything into a <br/>
lesson. Darin gets upset that Moly doesn&#39;t seem to want to know how to add up <br/>
her money. Moly leaves and Darin says to me, &quot;I thought you started school <br/>
already.&quot; (meaning the public schooled kids have gone back, why haven&#39;t you <br/>
started teaching our kids something?) I gently remind him that we don&#39;t do <br/>
school, we are learning all the time, the kids and I follow our interests. To <br/>
which I usually hear, &quot;That&#39;s great, but when are you going to do math?&quot; He <br/>
just doesn&#39;t get it and I doubt he ever will. <br/>
<br/>
I have tried to get him to read books on the subject, then I tried to get him <br/>
to &quot;Just read this chapter honey!&quot; then I tried reading whatever paragraph <br/>
had just struck me as an extraordinarily, eye-opening, what ever idea I <br/>
thought just might help him *get it*. I&#39;m going to try tapes next. He likes <br/>
books on tape so maybe this will work! Someone else telling him what I have <br/>
been saying all along, in their words. I think, over the years, he has come <br/>
to accept it though. He knows the kids are smart. He is just so impressed <br/>
with the way Moly had taken to reading, and is always asking about what she <br/>
is reading. But I am sure if there were worksheets with big gold stars, all <br/>
over the fridge, he would be more comfortable. Marrying me has definitely put <br/>
Darin outside his comfort zone! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
My best advice is, be gentle with it. For many people the idea of unschooling <br/>
takes time. So read little blurbs out loud, post short articles where he will <br/>
find them. Take the Field and Stream magazines out of the bathroom and put <br/>
your copy of The Homeschooling Handbook out, open to the unschooling chapter. <br/>
Subscribe to Home Education Magazine and leave it open to that great article <br/>
on his side of the bed...<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

How about if next time he just plays with the coins and makes piles that add <br/>
up to $1? That&#39;s how Casey started understanding it. With the amounts Moly <br/>
had, her Dad could make 1 pile with 4 quarters, 1 pile with 3 quarters 2 <br/>
dimes and a nickel, 1 pile with 3 dimes 14 nickels, one pile with 100 <br/>
pennies, and one with the leftovers of 3 nickels and 43 pennies. The dollars <br/>
are then easy to count up and the leftovers aren&#39;t nearly so overwhelming. <br/>
No  big numbers or carrying. Just counting up the money to see how much <br/>
you&#39;ve got to spend. As you said, though, it&#39;s better if it&#39;s not a lesson, <br/>
and if Moly was interested in playing with the coins too. :o)<br/>

Maybe you want to get PamS&#39;s Joyful Math tapes?  They might convince him<br/>
that if you try to force kids to &quot;carry the one&quot; when they don&#39;t<br/>
