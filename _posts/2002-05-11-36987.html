<div id="ygrps-yiv-704041728"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think it might be VERY useful for you to modify Carol Narigon&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &quot;Unschooling Curriculum&quot; write-up and print it on some lovely paper, making<br/>
&gt; it look very official (if not officious &lt;g&gt;) and give that to your family<br/>
&gt; members.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Pam.  My family may never see it, but I suspect they may hear it,<br/>
and I had a good hour or so poking around other links on Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>
(Thank you, Sandra!)<br/>
