<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461789386">Just thought I&#39;d take a minute to introduce myself and offer up a few words of thanks.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Betsy. I have a 2.5 year old boy named Sam. He is incredible--I had no idea I would be this blown away!<br/>
<br/>
I am just learning about unschooling, but I am really nodding my head in agreement with what I&#39;ve found so far. It feels like jumping off a cliff--scary and freeing at the same time. I have a lot of deschooling to do.<br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying this list and the links and the resources tremendously! Every day my mind gets blown open in ways I can&#39;t believe--it&#39;s pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will continue to read and learn and try to participate.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
Betsy<br/>

Hi Betsy, welcome to the list! About your cliff analogy, this is a <br/>
paraphrase of something i read somewhere about HSing: Homeschooling <br/>
is like jumping off a cliff until you realize that you and your <br/>
child both have wings to FLY!<br/>
