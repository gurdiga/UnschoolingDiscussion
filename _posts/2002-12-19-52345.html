like. Critiquing other people&#39;s &quot;attitudes&quot; on email lists always <br/>
disrupts list discussion and does not contribute to better discussion <br/>
of topics relevant to the list purpose. If you feel you must teach <br/>
others here to be more gentle or anything else, how about doing it by <br/>
example - just post about unschooling in ways you wish others would <br/>
post and trust people to learn.<br/>
