hi,
<p>i read this book last fall.&nbsp; i enjoyed it and felt it was a good
portrayal of one family&#39;s approach to opening up a vast world for a child
by following her lead.&nbsp; but would have <u>loved</u> to read more about
your younger daughter (and your wife) and her learning experiences because
it would shown a more diverse picture since their styles and approaches
seem so different.&nbsp; overall i felt it was honest and fascinating,
especially your ability to utilizes your community because this is an area
i am very weak at.&nbsp;&nbsp; but when you have a child whose interests
lay well outside your own, in your case music and in mine robotics, looking
toward the community would be the next logically step.&nbsp; i think you
covered the &#39;how to&#39; part very well and you showed just how exciting life
can be when a family embrace learning as a lifestyle.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686595615">hi david,<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the update!  sorry i didn&#39;t use meera&#39;s name but i literally<br/>
just loaned your book out so i couldn&#39;t look it up.  i remember the thing<br/>
about aliyah&#39;s b-day, it makes sense and imo the book didn&#39;t lose anything<br/>
by this.  i guess because my son is only 4 those early years, which meera<br/>
was in during much of the book, are still very fascinating.  thanks again.<br/>
i  look forward to the new gws mag.<br/>
<br/>
best wishes,<br/>

<br/>
I would have loved to have written more about Meera as well, but felt it<br/>
was more important to end at Aliyah&#39;s 10th birthday (for reasons I state<br/>
in Skylark).  Meera, by the way, is doing just fine!  She is an<br/>
extremely talented gymnast (spends about 20 hours a week at the gym),<br/>
has taught herself to play the flute at an extremely high level, is<br/>
currently working her way through Mozart&#39;s 23rd Piano Concerto, and<br/>
occasionally (though only occasionally) opens a book.  She reads well!<br/>
it&#39;s just that she has decided she has better things to do with her<br/>
time!<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of the year, Meera started taking band with the local<br/>
5th grade.  About the 5th week in, the teacher decided she should teach<br/>
the other kids (she herself had never had even a single lesson) -- well,<br/>
we didn&#39;t allow this to go on very long, got her moved to 6th grade<br/>
band, where she is bored, and stays in with promises that she&#39;ll be in<br/>
the 8th grade band next year.  (she&#39;s only 9)  Meanwhile, she may have<br/>
been the only kid in Washington state enrolled in recess! Recess<br/>
followed band, and she wanted to go to the schoolyard with her friends,<br/>
so they made us enroll her (allows the school district to capture<br/>
revenue! and they think it helps them with liability, though I can&#39;t<br/>
figure out how.)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, my younger is very different from my older one, but the way we go<br/>
about meeting her learning aspirations does not differ in any<br/>
substantive way.  My wife no longer delivers newspapers (she&#39;s still a<br/>
massage therapist) -- she now cares intermittently for Alzheimer&#39;s<br/>
patients in their homes, and has lots of fascinating information to<br/>
bring home!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;I had the pleasure of meeting David last night and listening to him speak. <br/>
&gt;His talk on hsing was wonderful. Meeting him and Ellen and  their girls was <br/>
&gt;like meeting up with old friends. They are a wonderful family. (And to top <br/>
&gt;it all off, I got to hear his daughter play the piano). :-)<br/>
