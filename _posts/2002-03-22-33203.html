<div id="ygrps-yiv-441771540">Somebody asked some questions about this school.. and I lost the darn <br/>
replies twice. Power went out and then I retrieved all the ones I wanted <br/>
to respond to and then again. Since time is short here tonight, I&#39;m going <br/>
to try to remember some of the questions.<br/>
<br/>
yes, I&#39;m sure some of the kids choose to be there. I&#39;m sure some of them <br/>
are there becasue parents work and they can&#39;t stay home. Some of them are <br/>
probably there from single parent households. Some have no choice in the <br/>
matter.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t answer how or why the students are all there.<br/>
<br/>
The campus is open. They can choose to leave whenever they want although <br/>
some of the parents have their own rules. Mostly for the younger ones. <br/>
Can your 5yo unschooler do that at home? Can they just walk out the door <br/>
and leave? What a scary thought.<br/>
<br/>
Attendence is what is required by law. If you can find away around this, <br/>
I&#39;m sure they would welcome hearing this. As a NY resident, I am required <br/>
to &#39;teach&#39; my son the same cirriculum that ps do for 5 hours a day. I am <br/>
bound by the law, even if I choose to be creative with it. The school is <br/>
as creative as they can be considering the legalities.<br/>
<br/>
One can come, sign in and leave. They can do this for the entire year if <br/>
they choose. Most choose to stick around because there is so much <br/>
activity and &#39;doing&#39; going on.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if they want to be called an &#39;unschool&#39;. They are a &#39;free&#39; <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
When my son attended Cedarwood Sudbury in Santa Clara, CA, because as a <br/>
single parent that was the next best option, they didn&#39;t think of <br/>
themselves as unschoolers.. or anything associated with Holt. I heard of <br/>
Greenberg long before I heard of Holt, even though they have many <br/>
ideologies that cross paths.<br/>
<br/>
If there were any other question, I&#39;ll be sure to field them when we get <br/>
back next week sometime.<br/>
