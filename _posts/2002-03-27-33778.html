<div id="ygrps-yiv-75061817">I&#39;ve been spending a lot of my time since Saturday reflecting on being<br/>
one of the new owners of this list.  I&#39;ve been in contact with a number<br/>
of friends both on-line and IRL and I&#39;ve spent a lot of time talking<br/>
with my dearest friend of all, my husband.  The conclusion that I<br/>
reached is that I cannot be an owner of this list now.  In fact I<br/>
will no longer be a member of this list.  The reasons that drew me<br/>
here in June, 1999 no longer exist for me.  Just so no one feels<br/>
like I am singling out this list - I&#39;m leaving a lot of others too.<br/>
I&#39;ve unsubbed from 18 lists in the past 24 hours and I have a few<br/>
more to go...  (I guess my Flylady 27 Fling Boogie will be email<br/>
lists this week.)<br/>
<br/>
I wish all of you well in your unschooling journey.  It&#39;s very likely<br/>
I&#39;ll see you around the Internet in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Good-bye and good luck whereever your journey takes you, <br/>
<br/>
Cindy</div>
