<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365794130">&quot;Hi. I&#39;m from the Atlanta area as well and am so glad to see someone else from<br/>
 round here.   I don&#39;t know anyone locally who is unschooling.&quot;<br/>

Madeline,<br/>
there are several unschoolers in Atlanta...one invited us to stay with them last year. There is an inclusive group up there that has unschoolers, can&#39;t remember the name. I bet you could find them at the homeschool registry or by checking in at the unschooling.com message board.<br/>
