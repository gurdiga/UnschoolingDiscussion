<div id="ygrps-yiv-283540262">There probably is some effect on the eyes and electromagnetic parts of<br/>
the body?  Can&#39;t anything be unhealthy if it is a substitution for<br/>
experiencing life, I mean, if it is a coping mechanism we turn to instead<br/>
of dealing with our problems?  Just like gambling or eating or other<br/>
potential addictions.  Most addictions are just a dampener for pain, a<br/>
false stimulant or sedative.<br/>
On the other hand, everyone eats.  Can&#39;t gambling just be simple<br/>
entertainment?  So what I&#39;m saying is, tv can be unhealthy, but it can<br/>
also be healthy.  Couldn&#39;t watching tv for a while help us get through a<br/>
grieving stage?  TV can be educational and entertaining.<br/>
Speaking of addictions, the book The Alcoholic Personality said that<br/>
people who, either by neglect or too much control, never developed<br/>
self-discipline were potentials for alcoholic personalities.  That is why<br/>
we talk about why&#39;s, give information and let the children participate in<br/>
coming up with solutions.  I want my son to learn independence, but<br/>
sometimes it is too stressful for him to make some choices.  So, I will<br/>
sit with him and do a pro&#39;s and con&#39;s list to help him learn<br/>
decisionmaking.  That way he doesn&#39;t feel overburdened with<br/>
responsibility or powerless to make a choice.  We also do the serenity<br/>
prayer for figuring out what we can change and what we cannot change.  <br/>
