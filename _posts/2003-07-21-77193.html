<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000410951"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; You mean there really are authorities?  Who are they?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on your point of view.  &lt;g&gt;  I was using the term a lot more loosely<br/>
than the person I was replying to.  What I meant was that there are people<br/>
on this list whose advice is almost always really good in my opinion.  Some<br/>
of those people are also the people who were referred to as &quot;authorities&quot;,<br/>
and it was used in a very negative sense, like they want to be in control.<br/>
Obviously I don&#39;t see it that way.<br/>
