What is MSAL?<br/>
<br/>
The short answer: MSAL stands for Maitland School of Advanced Learning. It<br/>
was created in 1980 by rebellious thirteen year olds who could not stand to<br/>
continue in traditional schools. It has evolved into an organization which<br/>
is both an online alternative education organization and an experiment in<br/>
how to take full advantage of the information revolution.<br/>

<br/>
A more detailed overview of MSAL:<br/>
<br/>
MSAL is one of the few academic organizations in the world formed by<br/>
students rather than by professional teachers or by institutions such as<br/>
governments or churches. This has resulted in certain profound differences<br/>
between MSAL and other organizations. A few key examples:<br/>
(1) There are no teachers. Students learn from more advanced students or on<br/>
their own.<br/>
(2) There are no grades.<br/>
(3) There are no attendance requirements.<br/>
(4) There is no tuition.<br/>
(5) There are no admission requirements.<br/>
(6) There is no school building. MSAL operates on the internet and in the<br/>
real world, not isolated in classrooms.<br/>
(7) There are MSAL students who are teenagers and others who are senior<br/>
citizens, and they come from around the world. They are not divided into<br/>
classes by age, race or religion but only by their own interests .<br/>

Additional information can be found in the two texts below. They detail the<br/>
story of the founding of MSAL, as well as MSAL&#39;s belief that the right of<br/>
students to choose what they have to learn must be respected.<br/>

Study Groups and Projects<br/>
<br/>
MSAL is not about grades or diplomas or degrees. It is about learning what<br/>
you want to learn, learning things you never imagined before and using that<br/>
knowledge to carry out ambitious projects. Sometimes the projects are for<br/>
fun. Sometimes projects are carried out to make a lot of money. Sometimes<br/>
projects are carried out to change the world.<br/>
There are two main forms of organization at MSAL. One is study groups which<br/>
are simply groups of students informally learning about some particular<br/>
subject. The other is student projects. Projects are usually group efforts<br/>
and typically attract students from more than one study group. Any student<br/>
may start a new study group or project, they are not part of any set<br/>
&quot;curriculum&quot; decreed by the school.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Student Revolt and Information Revolution<br/>
MSAL is still serving its original purpose of giving young people an<br/>
alternative to the traditional school system. It is also striving to create<br/>
a new kind of future for its students.<br/>
<br/>
Among college students, there is often an atmosphere of idealistic visions,<br/>
of becoming aware of the wider world and the vast possibilities it holds.<br/>
But then comes graduation and the conventional wisdom is that you must at<br/>
some point leave school, get a job, settle into a routine existence and<br/>
spend the rest of your life doing what someone tells you to do even if it is<br/>
boring and has no great significance in the scheme of things.<br/>
It is becoming increasingly obvious that this is no longer a recipe for<br/>
success if it ever was. Success increasingly depends upon being able to<br/>
constantly learn new things and develop new products, new technologies and<br/>
new ways of doing business.<br/>
The ideals and visions of youth should not be abandoned. A sense of vision,<br/>
an ability to see possibilities and effectively pursue them... this is what<br/>
is needed to thrive when change is rapid and constant. Is there any reason<br/>
to graduate and quit learning? On the contrary, we need that sense of<br/>
youthful idealism, those grand visions of the possible. We need lifelong<br/>
learning, not a degree. And we need it in the real world, not locked away in<br/>
a classroom somewhere, disconnected from everyone else.<br/>
The world is in the middle of a vast transformation which is sometimes<br/>
called the &quot;information revolution.&quot; The most obvious result of this<br/>
revolution is to make available to us immense amounts of information and to<br/>
quicken the pace of change.<br/>
Information is thrown at us in the form of junk mail, spam e-mail,<br/>
telemarketing and advertising of every kind. The pace of technological and<br/>
economic change is increasing and most individuals and organizations are not<br/>
able to closely monitor the changes which affect them directly, much less<br/>
the changes which are longer term or indirect. Most people and organizations<br/>
can scarcely wade through the flood of information rushing at them, much<br/>
less explore the oceans of information which are sitting out there on the<br/>
internet, but which are not part of the news announcements and<br/>
advertisements which grasp for our attention.<br/>
Modern library systems and the internet make it relatively easy, for the<br/>
first time in human history, to access every bit of knowledge written down<br/>
by the human race in the last 6,000 years and to access current information<br/>
on what is happening now in every part of the world.<br/>
Who is fully using the potential of this global information network? There<br/>
are trillions of dollars to be made from this, political upheavals waiting<br/>
to happen, new frontiers which will be opened, and transformations of<br/>
society which will occur because of the information revolution.<br/>
Is there any government, any corporation, any charitable organization, any<br/>
academic organization, anyone at all who is putting to use the vast<br/>
potential of the information revolution? No. There is not. Yet, the tools<br/>
for this revolution are available to anyone with a library card and internet<br/>
access.<br/>
What is lacking is an understanding of how to set up an organization to<br/>
process and act on such a vast amount of ever-changing information. For that<br/>
matter, there is a lack of understanding that this is a goal which<br/>
individuals and institutions should be working toward.  Yet the stakes could<br/>
not be higher.<br/>
Whoever can create an organization which can effectively process ALL the<br/>
available information in the world, recognize the knowledge which is<br/>
important, and act on it... whoever can do that first will have undreamt of<br/>
possibilities before them.<br/>
If the chaotic mass of information which is now available can be<br/>
assimilated, understood and used to guide the progress of mankind, it will<br/>
be a level of intelligence which has never existed before. No one has ever<br/>
had access to all the public information which exists, in real time, in a<br/>
form which quickly and easily can be used to make informed decisions.<br/>
Every human being and every human organization in the world from<br/>
corporations to governments is stumbling through life without the benefit of<br/>
that knowledge. Life and death decisions affecting millions of people are<br/>
being made based on an analysis of only one millionth of the available<br/>
information simply because there is no way to assimilate it all. Whoever<br/>
solves that assimilation problem will transform civilization. It will be<br/>
like a blind man gaining sight for the first time. It will be like a<br/>
sleepwalker awakening.<br/>
How much more money could be made, how much economic prosperity could be<br/>
achieved, if business decisions had the benefit of most or all of the<br/>
relevant information? How much better would our government be if the voters<br/>
had most or all of the relevant information when they voted?<br/>
What new technologies would be developed if scientists could know everything<br/>
which was already known including things which had just been discovered<br/>
today? Extended life spans, space colonization, utopian societies,<br/>
unimagined prosperity, nanotechnology, understanding the workings of the<br/>
human brain, genetic engineering... who knows what is possible with that<br/>
kind of information processing capability?<br/>
<br/>
MSAL is trying to be such an organization, to be among the first of a new<br/>
generation of human institutions, focused on the pursuit of knowledge and<br/>
the realization of the full potential of the information age.<br/>
