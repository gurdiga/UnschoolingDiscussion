<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Attending school is not unschooling. Using a full curriculum is not <br/>
unschooling. Unschooling is &quot;not schooling.&quot;<br/>
But when unschoolers choose to attend school or use a curriculum, it is <br/>
a very different experience than it is for kids who are there with no <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters will identify themselves as unschoolers - they&#39;ve been <br/>
raised as unschoolers for long enough that that is their identity - it <br/>
isn&#39;t just something they &quot;do.&quot; They really truly feel there is a <br/>
definite difference between people who have been unschooled and those <br/>
who have been schooled - a difference that persists beyond school age. <br/>
But my daughter who is a full-time college student studying for a <br/>
specific degree is not &quot;unschooling college.&quot; She is an unschooler who <br/>
is no longer unschooling.<br/>

Thanks.  The post Pam wrote earlier 3/7 in response to YES, how unschooling works, also went a long way in answering my question, but I didn&#39;t see that one until after I wrote.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that WHY a person is attending school or using a curriculum is more important than whether or not they are doing it, in terms of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
All too often I hear new unschoolers say that their child, often quite young, is choosing to go to school or *wants* a curriculum.  It seems that the child isn&#39;t making an informed choice, really.  But the families want to say that it is still unschooling because it is what the child wants.<br/>
<br/>
On the other end, I&#39;ve encountered some families whose older children have &quot;chosen&quot; to follow a curriculum, but it seems often to be in response to pressure from parents or elsewhere that it is the best way to prepare for their future.  Again, I&#39;m not convinced that the child is truly informed of all the possible options when making the choice.  As in &quot;go to college or end up at McDonalds&quot;, so the child chooses the college prep curriculum, not having support for choosing from the multitude of options between those two choices.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Identifying what is and isn&#39;t unschooling on the list is a way of helping<br/>
people build up their own image of what unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
Helping people understand what unschooling is is like helping little kids<br/>
figure out what a dog is. Dogs come in so many different forms that I doubt<br/>
anyone could define &quot;dog&quot; in a way that a child could unerringly sort all<br/>
dogs from other animals properly. So we help them build up their own<br/>
criteria for what constitutes dog/not-dog and they refine that as they<br/>
encounter stranger breeds that push the edges of the understanding they&#39;re<br/>
building.<br/>
<br/>
(And really that&#39;s how *any* learning works. We build up an image of what we<br/>
think it is and we test it (or it tests us!) and we refine it.)<br/>
<br/>
Some unschooling kids will use workbooks and use school. But pointing to<br/>
workbooks and school won&#39;t help anyone understand what unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
Once someone understands unschooling then they don&#39;t need to ask if<br/>
workbooks and school are unschooling ;-) Because unschooling is defined by<br/>
true freedom to learn free from false ideas of what learning needs to look<br/>
like rather than what a child is doing.<br/>

I don&#39;t personally think going to school is unschooling.<br/>
If Holly goes to 8th grade next year, I&#39;ll say &quot;Holly&#39;s in school.&quot;   She&#39;s <br/>
still going back and forth on it, and I&#39;m thinking of writing to get her a  <br/>
full-day visit, if the school will allow that; I got the principal&#39;s name from a  <br/>
neighbor who&#39;s a teacher.  <br/>

 <br/>
It matters in real-life terms, more than &quot;in terms of unschooling.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
A child in a class (or a whole school) by her own choice and for her own  <br/>
reasons will have a different experience there than a child who is there against  <br/>
her will or without having considered she HAD a choice.<br/>
 <br/>
A child whose parents would rather her come home than stay there will have  a <br/>
VERY different experience.  The teachers had better be DAMNED nice and  <br/>
entertaining and inspiring, or the kid is gone.  Teachers aren&#39;t at all  used to <br/>
that.  But still, that child in school isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>

I agree. And the parents aren&#39;t either, if they think it&#39;s not harmful to  <br/>
say &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll teach you math a little each day.&quot;  It&#39;s the path to more  <br/>
lessons and more teaching, not to less.<br/>

We live in NJ, and I don&#39;t know how things work in your state. But, my daughter was able to spend a day at our local regional high school. She went as a visitor with a student who went to the school. The girl had to request permission from each of her teachers. It was eye-opening to my daughter -- she liked the french class, probably because she is studying french at the local community college. She found the day very disjointed, moving from class to class -- never fully covering anything. In the grammar/reading class my daughter helped show the class how to read poetry with feeling -- the teacher was so impressed she invited my daughter back for a reading of Anne Frank. My dd has never had a reading/grammar class in her life. I found this quite amusing. It is doubtful that my daughter will go, she said she attempted to read the book a while ago, and found it too hard (emotionally) on her. All in all her visit to the local high school was another experience in life, that she doesn&#39;t feel she needs to explore any further.<br/>

I want to ask for opinions here because maybe I dont fully understand unschooling. <br/>
 <br/>
My daughter has some anxiety about needing to learn to read ( I honestly dont know where she got it from ). After many requests I got headsprout reading for her. She had a lot of fun with it untill episode 35 and quit ( there are 40 episodes) She was always free to come and go as she pleased and she is now back in read to me mode. <br/>
I never pressured her to do it but I think headsprout was a good experience for her. It think it removed a lot of her anxiety and she feels confident to explore reading on her own now . <br/>
 <br/>
Now i hate to put things in categories but her new thing seems to be science concepts. Her questions lately have been about volcanoes, where does gas go when the car runs out? What is water made out of? <br/>
If there is oxygen in water why can we breathe it?<br/>
 <br/>
So as a means to answer her questions I will go get books, find info and mini movies on the internet, etc. If she is interested at the moment Ill talk more about it and we will look at even more things relating to the subject. If she says no I want to make dominoe rallies right now I leave her to it . <br/>

I think it might be that way for Holly, too.<br/>
 <br/>
It just occurred to me that I could arrange for her to have a day at Sandia  <br/>
Prep, too, a private school, to be there all day with another student.  The  <br/>
danger there is if she loved it a lot, I&#39;d be sad because we can&#39;t afford  it.  <br/>
But if she just goes as an anthropologist or tourist, that&#39;s okay.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

This reminds me of what I used to say early on in our unschooling when  <br/>
people would ask, incredulously, if we did ANY structured learning.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d explain that yes, we were doing an important unit on Multicultural  <br/>
Vocational Homeschooling Education: I was teaching Julian to say &quot;Do you want  <br/>
fries with that?&quot; in fourteen languages.<br/>
 <br/>
Generally they would laugh and then drop it.<br/>

This is another of those posts where I kept waiting in vain for the problem<br/>
to be revealed. Sounds like a bunch of great Unschooling moments and great<br/>
parental facilitating. <br/>
<br/>
Still worried? Keep on posting about your days like this. Then next time you<br/>
get anxiety you can refer back to your own experiences for reassurance.<br/>
