I, too, sometimes have self-doubt about what my children know or<br/>
don&#39;t know.  My 8yo son just last week announced that he wanted to go<br/>
to 3rd grade ps.  I was shocked to here this (but kept it to myself)<br/>
and went on to discuss with him why he wants to go.  He stated a<br/>
couple of things like, &quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m learning what I&#39;m supposed<br/>
to.&quot; and &quot;The teachers at school make you do your work and don&#39;t help<br/>
you; you try to help me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We talked about what he does know, how he&#39;s learned it, compared that<br/>
to grade levels and the pace of a classroom and he walked away<br/>
apparently convinced that he&#39;s doing well.  His love for math sounds<br/>
much like your son&#39;s and he continuously astounds us at his growing<br/>
knowledge (I believe he was 5 when he started saying things like, &quot;9<br/>
nine times is 81&quot; or when he asks to be &quot;challenged&quot; by me into<br/>
figuring out &quot;the biggest math problems I can think of&quot;.  He is also<br/>
a self-taught reader and has the freedom to read what he wants when<br/>
he wants (oh my, Pokemon has a huge role in his love of reading and<br/>
this really isn&#39;t open for comments!!).<br/>
<br/>
I watch a 10yo 4th grader after school a couple days a week and<br/>
occassionally, I find myself looking in her workbooks to see what she<br/>
is working on.  Not only do I find that simple things like the 3 R&#39;s<br/>
are made into very complicated subjects, but that through our<br/>
everyday life and the natural loves & curiousities of my children,<br/>
they are getting everything they need academically.<br/>
<br/>
My 6-1/2yo daughter is learning how to read and often wants my help.<br/>
I can see with her what a challenge 1st grade would of been and<br/>
probably would have diminished her desire to read.  We have to step<br/>
back from certain parts of it to avoid aggrevation on both of our<br/>
parts.  I have found that, given a couple of weeks, she always<br/>
revisits the stuff that originally stumped her.  Then she comes to me<br/>
and shows me (because she wants to) that she gets it now and we can<br/>
go on to other parts of reading or spelling.<br/>
<br/>
My 3-1/2 yo is being asked by everyone we know if he&#39;s going to pre-<br/>
school in the fall.  What a question!  I&#39;m not sure, my 8yo didn&#39;t<br/>
and my 6yo did, and the baby is due in March.  I&#39;m not sure that I<br/>
want to put him into preschool or that I can even afford it.  He&#39;s<br/>
also a little math whiz and he has the benefit of older siblings who<br/>
engage and challenge him all day long, so I&#39;m not sure that preschool<br/>
would be beneficial.  I also dread all of the illness that comes from<br/>
preschool and exposing the baby and the older children to that.<br/>
<br/>
Last week the subject of Jesus came up here and I had remarked that<br/>
maybe there was a better place for these discussions.  Most people<br/>
seemed to reply to the fact that unschooling covers all aspects of<br/>
our lives and we should have a free message board.  Then the dogs and<br/>
abortion came up.  Personally, I am pleased to see the diversity of<br/>
this unschooling group and do agree that unschooling pretty much<br/>
covers all aspects of life.  I was very hurt and disappointed when<br/>
personal attacks were started because we don&#39;t all believe in the<br/>
same things.  It seems as though, with a new day started, that the<br/>
opinions and comments keep coming in but that the attacks have<br/>
stopped, which I am grateful for.<br/>
<br/>
To those who have expressed pro-life support and to those who have<br/>
expressed pro-choice support, I applaud and respect you all, our<br/>
beliefs shape every aspect of our lives.  To those who responded with<br/>
the intent to offend, I hope, that in the future, we can express our<br/>
opinions and leave out the hurtful attacks to those who don&#39;t share<br/>
the same belief as you.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you and all...<br/>
<br/>
