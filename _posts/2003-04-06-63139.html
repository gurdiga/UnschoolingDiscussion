<div id="ygrps-yiv-816831090"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;We choose unschooling, we choose community.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey Robin, we&#39;re planning on moving this summer and are checking out several <br/>
different IC&#39;s. Where do you live? I&#39;d love a community with built in <br/>
unschoolers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In fact, if anyone else lives in an intentional community that might be open <br/>
to a family of 4, let me know!<br/>

&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green <br/>
earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.&quot;<br/>
