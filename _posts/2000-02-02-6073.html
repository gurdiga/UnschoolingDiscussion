<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603175783">I just posted a long winded story of our day.  I have to share this<br/>
great site with you.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org">http://www.pbs.org</a><br/>
This is just the basic pbs site which can be very interesting...From<br/>
there you can either get to the Nova home page, or go to Nova Online<br/>
home page by this  url<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/</a><br/>
Then go explore the Secrets of the lost Empires.  If you click on<br/>
Medieval Siege, and then scroll down and click on Destroy The Castle,<br/>
you can play like we did.  It was really fun.  The whole family got into<br/>
this.  There is lots of interesting other things to find too.<br/>
Just wanted to share....<br/>
