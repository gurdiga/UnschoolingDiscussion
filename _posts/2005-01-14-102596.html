<div id="ygrps-yiv-805764849">O.K. that was negative.  I must say that you are right that there are no guarantees in life whether one eats healthy &#39;type&#39; foods or &#39;junk&#39; foods.  However, I am negative about my husband&#39;s food choices because I don&#39;t want to see him have a heart attack or die young from his choices.  I do love him.  I must admit that I have a hard time letting go of the bad food/good food issue.  Perhaps this is my way of hanging on to some sort of hopeless control in our lives.  Hmmm, I have a ways to go, I know, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m here;-)<br/>

<br/>
======================<br/>
 <br/>
Stress is known to cause heart attacks.<br/>
Maybe you could love him enough to be calm even if he&#39;s eating corn chips  or <br/>
whatever it might be, and he could live more happily.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe if you drop the struggle, he could make healthier choices on his  own.<br/>
With the struggle intact, he can&#39;t make any choice except to let you win by  <br/>
not having his way, or to &quot;win&quot; by doing what you don&#39;t want.  Either way  is <br/>
bad, and you set up the options yourself.<br/>
 <br/>
If you see it work with your husband, you&#39;ll have a clearer belief that it  <br/>
will work with your children (or vice versa).<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Your life?<br/>
Can you practice controlling your own choice of words and thoughts about  <br/>
&quot;junk&quot;?<br/>
Or try to control how you express it?<br/>
 <br/>
We really can&#39;t control other people without some risk and cost.  The  best <br/>
we can aim for is to control our selves.<br/>

Honestly, I don&#39;t give him a hard time or hassle him when he is eating corn chips or anything else for that matter.  I just have in the past had conversations with him about both of us making healthier food choices.  Hmmm, I don&#39;t think that it is wrong to express concern over someone&#39;s choices.  I don&#39;t sit there and nag him about his food choices or anything.<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm, see I don&#39;t really feel that there is a big struggle.  I have just expressed to him that there is so much &quot;junk&quot; in regular food and he has agreed with me. He still makes the choice to eat a lot of unhealthy food.  I honestly leave him alone about it.  He knows what I think.  Again, I don&#39;t nag him about it.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If you see it work with your husband, you&#39;ll have a clearer belief that it  <br/>

<br/>
I pretty much let Lindsay eat whatever she wants and whenever she wants.  However, in the past I have said that candy is not good for us because it has very little nutritional value vs. other foods.   I told her in two-year old terms by saying that it sometimes makes us tired, sluggish and can hurt our teeth, if we eat too much/too often.  I told her that, not while she was eating it, but a little bit after.  I have also, told her fruit, vegies and protein give us energy and help her grow.  I don&#39;t think that there is anything wrong with that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Can you practice controlling your own choice of words and thoughts about  <br/>
&quot;junk&quot;?<br/>
Or try to control how you express it?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh sure, I know this is my issue.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We really can&#39;t control other people without some risk and cost.  The  best <br/>

Yes, that I know is true.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933272681">My husband watched sports on tv - by the hour. I hated it. It took him <br/>
away from us, it kept him sitting on the couch, it was annoying noise <br/>
in the house, and I just had NO interest and it bugged me.<br/>
<br/>
I bugged HIM - not constantly, because I&#39;m not a nag, but he KNEW that <br/>
I disapproved. For one thing, he wanted to spend his bonus on a <br/>
big-screen tv and I made it very clear I was NOT going for that. He <br/>
knew I thought his choice to watch all that tv was a bad choice.<br/>
<br/>
One day I had an AHA moment. He LOVED watching tv - especially sports. <br/>
Why would I not support him in doing something that gave him such <br/>
pleasure. So I suggested that the next bonus go for a big-screen. I <br/>
reminded him when sporting events were going to be on tv. I arranged <br/>
our schedule, to the degree I could, around his favorite sports events. <br/>
Just did what I&#39;d do for the kids, if they had a big interest.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what? Over time he started being more discriminating about what <br/>
he chose to watch. He started being FAR more willing to tape sports <br/>
shows and watch them delayed (he&#39;d always insisted that it was no fun <br/>
to watch sports that weren&#39;t &quot;live.&quot;) He actually watches FAR less now <br/>
than he did then - and enjoys what he watches far more. I really truly <br/>
think that my change of attitude released him from feeling like he had <br/>
to insist on watching.<br/>

Now if you were talking about *you* making healthier choices, then you&#39;d be<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you picture home as a haven from pressures, a place to be who you are,<br/>
surrounded by those who love and support you, then knowing that someone<br/>
disapproves -- even silently -- of what you&#39;re doing is like a discordant<br/>
note. It makes home a less pleasant place to retreat to.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe try picturing something you love but something he doesn&#39;t think much<br/>
of. Like reading romance novels or science fiction, or a favorite TV show,<br/>
or your favorite chocolates. And think of the feeling you get when you do<br/>
something you love. And imagine a voice intruding on your relaxation that<br/>
says &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be doing that. There are better things you could be<br/>
doing.&quot; And the thing is that even if you only say something occasionally<br/>
just your presence when he&#39;s eating something &quot;junky&quot; is a reminder of your<br/>
words and your disapproval.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect he&#39;s well aware of what are healthy foods and what aren&#39;t. What<br/>
you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t news to him. What he&#39;s hearing is disapproval.<br/>
<br/>
If you want him to eat healthier, rather than trying to get him to change,<br/>
you change. Make things he loves that are healthy. Make lunches and snacks<br/>
that are healthy. Ask him for feedback on what you&#39;re making.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186221649">My DH already has hypertension - partially familial (his mom, dad, <br/>
and grandparents all were hypertensive), and partially from <br/>
lifestyle (relatively sedentary, food choices, etc). He also has a <br/>
severly damaged arthritic hip joint (or what&#39;s left of the hip <br/>
joint) which makes even walking painful often (try walking a long <br/>
distance with one leg on a curb and you begin to approach what he <br/>
lives with) so while movement is good for him it is also painful and <br/>
while excess weight exacerbates the problem, it is hard to shed when <br/>
moving is painful. When HE chose to start moving more, changing his <br/>
eating, etc, I researched health clubs, water aerobics, treadmills, <br/>
found lower sodium or fat versions of favorites, looked up recipes <br/>
for him, etc - he&#39;s the head chef in our house so my task was to <br/>
make sure the resources were available for him to do stuff like <br/>
perfect his really tasty low sodium heart healthy vegetarian chili. <br/>
In the process, we talked about things like sodium, protein, fat, <br/>
etc. Since DS (6 1/2) is living life right alongside us, he learned <br/>
about what sodium and potassium do, what fat/cholesterol do, etc. He <br/>
can read and make sense of label packaging and he requested we post <br/>
lists of protein foods and potassium foods (since potassium is the <br/>
balance to sodium). I also asked him one time when he was bouncing <br/>
off the walls and getting in my face if he wanted a PBJ or some <br/>
cheese because I had noticed that having some protein snack helped <br/>
him keep his own self more comfortable (he said when asked to stop <br/>
what he was doing that he -couldn&#39;t stop himself-). He asked for PBJ <br/>
and now he regularly goes in and makes himself something or asks for <br/>
us to help him with something (and we propose something if we know <br/>
its been a while - like I&#39;m heading to the kitchen, want me to bring <br/>
you some cheese slices?). And lately I&#39;ve been hoist on my own <br/>
petard so to speak - I started back up on the treadmill a few weeks <br/>
ago for my own self. DS likes to come and walk with me or he&#39;ll <br/>
bounce on his mini-trampoline or whatever. Well, last night I wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to head down to the treadmill (it had been a long day) but DS <br/>
said &quot;Are you going down to the treadmill?&quot; and I said No, he got <br/>
sad - he wanted to go down and walk with me. What could I do - I <br/>
went (lol)! And felt better myself after a nice walk. <br/>
<br/>
Long story short - cheery example beats disapproval hands down.</div>
