<div id="ygrps-yiv-716476101">There&#39;s a kind of building set called Ramagon.  Discovery Toys used to sell <br/>
them and still might.  They&#39;re pricey, but worth it.  Maybe there&#39;s a web <br/>
source?<br/>
<br/>
We have two sets.  They&#39;re Lego-compatible, meaning some of the flat surfaces <br/>
are made with the lego base-mat mold pattern (Lego guys can stand on them, <br/>
you can put Lego pieces on them).  You can make space ships for your Lego men.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a different kind of construction, with angles, cross pieces, wheels... <br/>
hard to describe.  I&#39;ll look for a link to pictures if they&#39;re still being <br/>
made.<br/>
