&gt;How did you make reading available to your boys to<br/>
&gt;learn on their own?  I know you had a more than subtle<br/>
&gt;influence!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Would your electrician son consider posting to us on<br/>
&gt;this list? Or at least to me?  My seven year old is<br/>
&gt;not reading yet.  He understands how it is supposed to<br/>
&gt;work, but it just isn&#39;t fun for him.  He doesn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;want to read directions for things that he wants to<br/>
&gt;make! yet. He seems so resistant, but I feel he is<br/>
&gt;missing out.....there are SO MANY really good fun<br/>
&gt;things to read! And reading gives me so much pleasure<br/>
&gt;that, well, he says &quot;Mama, we just aren&#39;t the same all<br/>
&gt;the time.&quot;  So I read TO him. And I have a sore throat<br/>
&gt;just now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe I just need some reassurance.  My little boy is<br/>
&gt;very bright.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks, Sharon<br/>

I forgot to also mention she is very bright/witty in other areas, she <br/>
gardens can tell me all the herbs and what they are used for, she is also <br/>
very good with math, and she has empathy towards everyone and animals. She <br/>
is like a 7 yo hippie LOL<br/>

&lt;&lt; My 7 yo (will be 8 in July) isn&#39;t reading fluently yet either &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that 7 and 8 are young ages to be reading and in my opinion you do <br/>
not need to be concerned. None of my four ( two boys and two girls ) read at <br/>
7. I know there are some children that read at 5 and younger but there are <br/>
also some children that take algebra at 10 or younger. One of my daughters <br/>
was in an advanced gymnastic class at 4 and my other three children could <br/>
care less about gymnastics. They all have their own likes and dislikes. I <br/>
would not worry about the reading, it will come. And since you are reading to <br/>
them you are giving them a love for books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561629644">That would be cool! She doesn&#39;t have many friends and has a hard time <br/>
relating to kids her age. But she does play well with all age groups.<br/>
Yes we are ALOT alike &lt;g&gt; but her hair is longer( down to her lil bum) and <br/>
more red than mine :)<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1257<br/>
&gt;Date: Tue, May 22, 2001, 12:14 PM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; I must have missed this message somehow, and just caught it here on<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Sandra&#39;s wise reply. We &quot;made reading available&quot; simply by always<br/>
&gt;&gt;  having lots of stuff around to read, which we&#39;d have done whether we<br/>
&gt;&gt;  had kids or not because we&#39;re both reading addicts<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For all of you who have always unschooled your kids, I&#39;m curious about the<br/>
&gt; mechanics of how they learned to read. Did they pick it up on their own from<br/>
&gt; having watched and listened to you, or did you use some sort of program when<br/>
&gt; they indicated that they were ready?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest (6) is partway through &quot;the process&quot; (and when does &quot;the process&quot;<br/>
end, anyway? I&#39;m STILL learning to read -- every time I read a new word, or<br/>
have a bit of a struggle with a new written idea or way of phrasing).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to watch. She started learning to read at about 2 months<br/>
old, swatting at books I held. She soon graduated to chomping on them and<br/>
drooling on them (yes, she&#39;s gifted), then to looking at them, frequently<br/>
holding them upside down, by the time she was 8 months.<br/>
<br/>
She learned the alphabet from Barney and from being read to. She learned to<br/>
write her first word from watching Nick Jr. (&quot;The first letter of &quot;FACE&quot; is<br/>
F, then comes the letter A...&quot; -- she came downstairs with her Magnadoodle,<br/>
she was about 4 1/2, to show us). She sight reads some -- Pokemon, Pooh,<br/>
cat, Clover (the name of our street), etc. She sounds out some, especially<br/>
since she likes the stories and humor in the &quot;Bob&quot; books.<br/>
<br/>
She is by no means &quot;ahead&quot; of what would be her classmates -- all of her<br/>
Brownie troop reads. If in school, they&#39;d put on frowny faces and try to<br/>
worry us over her. And, with her temperament, they&#39;d destroy her. Push Brit,<br/>
she turns into a puddle and leaks away. Push Mikey (little sister) and she<br/>
turns into Mighty Mouse and sends you to the moon. Thank G-d we unschool. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I fully expect that Brit will continue to learn to read in dribs and drabs<br/>
and occasional brilliant outbursts. I fully refuse to worry over it -- it&#39;s<br/>
happening, I can see it unfolding right in front of me, and her timeline is<br/>
her own.<br/>
<br/>
Her sister may very well read much later than Brit. I worry over Mikey (3)<br/>
even less, as she simply doesn&#39;t let other people&#39;s expectations affect her<br/>
as Brit will. Brit might very well care if some child taunts her for not<br/>
reading. Mikey would give them her &quot;Me Queen, You Peasant&quot; look and move on.<br/>
