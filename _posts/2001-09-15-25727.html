misattributing words to you.  I was speaking TO brenda so the &#39;you&#39; in<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t say your thoughts weren&#39;t welcome here.  I asked what you were <br/>
hoping to gain being here.  That&#39;s not the same thing.  And I didn&#39;t really <br/>
get an answer, but it doesn&#39;t really matter.<br/>
<br/>
IF someone comes here I often recommend they go to unschooling.com.  You <br/>
received that same advice, from me and from others.  <br/>
<br/>
Coming to this list for intro advice is not ideal.  It&#39;s even LESS ideal if <br/>
other types of advice are being offered without question by others here.<br/>
<br/>
Can we talk about unschooling now instead of the list itself please?<br/>
