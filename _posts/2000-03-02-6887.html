<div id="ygrps-yiv-563109373">What is a SUPERWOMAN?<br/>
<br/>
A SUPERWOMAN gets up in the morning, steps over the blanketed sleeping child<br/>
to let the dog out. She goes into the bathroom, and closed the door, but<br/>
still answers the questions that are whined her way. She comes out makes<br/>
breakfast, be it eggs, soup, or nachos. She then starts a load of laundry,<br/>
picks up a toy, heads to the living room to read. Sits down, opens her book,<br/>
closes her book, gets up goes into the kitchen, gives seconds, glasses of<br/>
juice and milk, and then starts the dishes. She goes back into the living<br/>
room to help one of the children find a shoe, and then starts cleaning out<br/>
under the sofa. The laundry is done, so she hangs the laundry up. She picks<br/>
up the breakfast leftovers, lets the dog in, feeds all the pets, and then<br/>
finishes the dishes. She eats the leftovers, and runs to catch the glass<br/>
that was put tooo close to the edge of the table. She finds the elusive pair<br/>
of socks, kisses her husband, hands him his keys, and makes sure he has the<br/>
keys to HIS car. (Not hers, again) She dresses the lagger, remembers that<br/>
she is in her robe, dresses herself, and then grabs books on the way out the<br/>
door. AND this is before any schooling!<br/>
I AM A SUPER WOMAN<br/>
I am not the thin, tall, brunette that Major Steve Austin adored.<br/>
I am in sweats, socks, and sneaks (matching if lucky)<br/>
I am not in red, white, and blue<br/>
I am using my fingers to tie my hair up<br/>
I am not the perfect hair person<br/>
I am with a wonderful, hard working man<br/>
I am not with an actor<br/>
I am a mother and wife, therefore all my days, in someone&#39;s eyes, I am a<br/>
SUPER WOMAN<br/>
