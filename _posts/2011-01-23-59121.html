<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186733270">***Last night was a big thing for me.  I was having fun in a deep way. <br/>
Holly had been invited out, but was opting to stay home with me instead.***<br/>
<br/>
Last week Dylan planned a monster movie marathon for us.  It was really <br/>
sweet.<br/>
When he was three, TNT had a &quot;Monster Movie Bash&quot; on the weekend of New <br/>
Year&#39;s eve.   They were showing Godzilla movies and some other Japanese <br/>
monster movies.   We watched and recorded them.   Last week Dylan (now 18) <br/>
pulled out those old tapes and we watched them again.  I made his favorite <br/>
cookies, we had snacks and popcorn.  He told me some of the things he <br/>
thought about the movies and the monsters when he was little.  I reminded <br/>
him about some the monster games we used to play.   It was wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t have other plans that he opted out of to be with me, but he made <br/>
plans to include me and I&#39;m so grateful.  I know people whose kids don&#39;t <br/>
want to spend any time with them and I&#39;m glad Dylan still wants to watch <br/>
monster movies with me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017816943">Last night about 20 minutes after I removed  her ability to continue to post on the list, Arsh sent this.  It went to &quot;moderator, but seemed addressed directly to me.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t share it immediately because I wasn&#39;t sure she was gone, and often people say &quot;I&#39;m outa here&quot; but they aren&#39;t really. I hoped she would continue to stay and read the really wonderful things people were writing.<br/>
<br/>
One of the moderators corresponded with her and asked her to stay.  I don&#39;t know how that will go, but some of their side exchange might help Arsh&#39;s children.<br/>

-=-Slow down. Read some of the links posted. When you post, avoid telling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
people what ideas are acceptable or unacceptable. If you don&#39;t want some of<br/>
the words you&#39;re getting, then go onto what you are willing to discuss more<br/>
about rather than posting guidelines to what is acceptable to write to you.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Katherine wrote that, and I agree. <br/>
<br/>
And speaking of guidelines for posting, the list has some.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningNEW">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningNEW</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearningPOSTS</a><br/>
<br/>
I let all of Arsh&#39;s posts through, even though they generally ignore the guidelines, but now, really, it&#39;s time to read, try, wait and watch.<br/>
It&#39;s time to realize that the spanking section of my site is more than one page long.<br/>
 <br/>
We opened and read together EVERY LINK on that page. I know it&#39;s more than one page long. I said I&#39;d read all of it. Why do you REFUSE to believe that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Arsh, you&#39;re welcome to read on the list, but not to post for a while. If you&#39;re truly willing to learn, work through what was written today, slowly and thoughtfully. Consciously. It will take a week just to read it at a pace that will begin to help, because for each point any of the posters made, you need to try, wait and watch.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t read what I said. I&#39;ve been reading since I was pregnant. We&#39;ve talked together as a group for over a week.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A week isn&#39;t nearly enough time to see a change, or to learn to make the kinds of choices that will help. <br/>
There&#39;s a sound file at the bottom of this page that might help you with finding ways to make choices that move you from where you are today to where you would like to be:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s free. You can download it and put it in the car or iPod or whatever. It will sound different the second time you hear it. It will sound different again after three months, and after a year.<br/>
<br/>
Everything on my site and Joyce&#39;s will look different when you read it after unschooling has begun to work for your family, in your home.<br/>
<br/>

How can you unschool your kids if you can&#39;t even really pay enough attention to get all the details of this message correct? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll find another place to learn. You are not helping. You aren&#39;t even listening. You&#39;ve just chased two families away instead of helping. <br/>
<br/>

====================================<br/>
Sandra note:  <br/>
<br/>
This is kind of classic:  &quot;How can you unschool your kids if you can&#39;t even really pay enough attention to get all the details of this message correct? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
When someone contradicts herself and backpedals and denies what she just wrote, she herself doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s said.  What I paid attention to  was the changing nature of the requests and reports.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care if every family leaves the list who spanks, or if every poster who doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m serious about posting carefully and clearly leaves.  <br/>
I&#39;m more concerned with those who are dedicated to discussing unschooling.  I hope those will stay.<br/>
<br/>
