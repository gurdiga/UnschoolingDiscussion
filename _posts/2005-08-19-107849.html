There  are also a couple of liberal arts colleges that are tuition free with <br/>
room  and board based on family income.  One is Berea in Kentucky and the  <br/>
other I know of is Berry in Georgia.  I personally attended Berea and  it was <br/>
an amazing experience.  So there are always those options to  consider.<br/>

I&#39;d never heard of Berea, so I went to the website. What an awesome place!  I <br/>
read their perspective on their Christian values (and shared the whole site  <br/>
with my son), and was blown away with how inclusive and loving the whole thing <br/>
 is.  Julian said that if all Christians were like that, the world would be  <br/>
a better place.<br/>
 <br/>
Very, very cool.<br/>

Yeah---the reason I asked was that I have a friend, Brian Wendel, who <br/>
went to Berea. We met in Vienna in our junior year abroad. Brian was <br/>
one of the sweetest, kindest, gentlest people I have ever known. I have <br/>
very fond memories of Brian.<br/>
<br/>
Brian was a Christian---so although we clashed a bit even then! &lt;g&gt;, we <br/>
got along really, really well. He was Catholic when he went to Berea <br/>
but later changed to Protestantism---he was very proud of that and made <br/>
sure to let me know! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We wrote a lot way back when, but we&#39;ve lost touch. For a while he was <br/>
with the Peace Corps in Tonga. He sent me some lovely shells and coins <br/>
and photos from Tonga. I should get back in touch with him...<br/>
<br/>
The world IS a better place because of Brian.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506049546">Is this the Berea college in (I think) Kentucky?  If it is, there&#39;s a  lot of <br/>
kids from our state that go there (WV)  They have an awesome  international <br/>
dance team, and many of the people who run the 4H dance camp in  our state now <br/>
went to Berea college.  It does look like a really nice  place.<br/>
