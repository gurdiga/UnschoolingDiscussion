<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089846538">Hi.  I&#39;m going through my old mail and find that I got a complaint about the <br/>
virus problem on May 25.  May 25 I was  out camping, and when I got back <br/>
there was a ton of e-mail, and while I thought I had gone through it all, I <br/>
had not.  So I&#39;m REALLY really sorry if my slow attention caused the problem <br/>
to get worse.  Here was the first (that I had) notice of this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just went off nomail for the AlwaysLearning list, and as soon as I posted <br/>
I got an empty email from someone named Cottonwood Farms <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_angus@...">_angus@...</a>&gt; that had a weird looking attachment to it. It was <br/>
pretty aggressive at trying to get the email program to open the attachment. <br/>
I deleted it, so don&#39;t have any more info. Except that they had the Re: <br/>
AlwaysLearning Irritated Parent in the subject line.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know the addresses your weird attachment-bearing e-mails came <br/>
from so I can let those members know they have a virus problem, and I can <br/>
take them off the list if necessary (if they haven&#39;t fixed it already).  <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

I just emailed someone else re. the &quot;Cottonwood Farm&quot; virus that supposedly my system keeps sending.  I&#39;ve had it taken in and cleaned out  twice andthe norton protector  downloaded.  I believe that&#39;s the best I can do plus continue to advise people not to open attachments or mail that looks a bit odd.  If you have any suggestions let me know.  I only subscribe to a few lists and enjoy this list in particular.  I&#39;m bummed about how an old virus keeps creeping up to infect others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128951025">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem for the list, but please, people--if you get <br/>
something with an always learning header, please forward it to me and back to <br/>
the person who sent it (remove the line from in front of the address) so we <br/>
can get it cleaned up.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t open anything that looks wrong in the meantime!  <br/>

Thanks.<br/>
