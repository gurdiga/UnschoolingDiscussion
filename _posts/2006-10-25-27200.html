<div id="ygrps-yiv-921975738">Hi everyone:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a while again (for at least 6 or 7 months) <br/>
again!  Its Dawn originally from Tucson, who now lives in Temecula <br/>
California.  We have tried the schools and I&#39;m ready to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
Zak, who is now 11, came to me today and asked me to buy Bookworm <br/>
for him so he could learn more words (I was thrilled to hear that he <br/>
was learning something) and then I realized that every day he has <br/>
been learning about life and how to live it and I don&#39;t have to <br/>
categorize what he does into &quot;good&quot; = school type validaiton work <br/>
and &quot;bad&quot; = can&#39;t be measured using the school standards without <br/>
twisting it.<br/>
<br/>
He also wants me to find out whether there are books on line that he <br/>
can read.  He often rips the covers off by accident or rips a page <br/>
and invariably the books seem worse for wear.  He had the brilliant <br/>
idea today to see if we can find them on line so he can read them at <br/>
his computer and not have to worry about accidentally ripping them.  <br/>
I was so proud he figured that out on his own.<br/>
<br/>
Max, who just turned 7 loves things that wiggle around outside.  I <br/>
am having to take off my high heels (just a joke I haven&#39;t worn them <br/>
in years) and look for ear wigs and snails.  Zak wasn&#39;t really into <br/>
having animals when we lived in Tucson so I just assumed Max would <br/>
be that way too.  Which of course he&#39;s not!<br/>
<br/>
So Steve takes them to a homeschooling Spiral Scouts Group and a <br/>
Homeschooling Bowling league and they want go back to Karate now <br/>
that we have moved and all the other things they do with me such as <br/>
going to Barnes and Noble with Zak so he can buy some more <br/>
Dragonball Z books that he&#39;s collecting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway Steve just came home from work (11pm), kids are asleep, I <br/>
think they are going to the corn maze tomorrow.  Time to go and <br/>
watch episode 6 of season two of LOST.  We have watched Season One <br/>
and Two back to back and I can&#39;t wait to see what happens next.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll finish my musings... with I think I got it finally...<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
