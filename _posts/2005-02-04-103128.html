&gt;infamous &quot;SEAHORSE&quot; report.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had a VERY similar situation with &quot;The Roots Project.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same deal: a project due on Cameron&#39;s family. He was to interview several family members to find out more about their childhoods and families. He interviewed both my parents, Ben&#39;s parents, Ben&#39;s paternal grandmother, and my paternal uncle. He asked for photos and knick-knacks and such. <br/>
<br/>
He &quot;scrapbooked&quot; it with stickers and photos and lots of colored papers. He had a ration book from the war and a photo of my uncle at the famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. He had family recipes and photos of relatives with the food. A family tree.  He learned how to calligraphy FOR this project, and you could actually *see* his improvement on each page.<br/>
<br/>
Not only was the teacher impressed, but all the kids dragged their parents over to see Cameron&#39;s on the &quot;day of viewing&quot;----&quot;Mom, Look at Cameron&#39;s project!&quot;  He was SOO proud of it----and the teacher made a point of pointing out how well-done it was. He was SOOO proud---and just beamed!<br/>
<br/>
The next day, he received his grade: a B-<br/>
<br/>
One child, who had ---like eight sheets of B & W paper bound with bread ties got an A.<br/>
<br/>
He was crushed. He asked his teacher why, when his was the one everybody thought was so good,---why did he only get a B-?<br/>
<br/>
He hadn&#39;t followed the directions that said a large portion of it needed to be typed. He *had*, in fact, typed a part of each page (the &quot;body&quot; ws typed; the &quot;filler&quot; was hand-written), but he had &quot;written&quot; too much! This was sixth grade, and they needed to practice on their typing----just the opposite of your daughter!<br/>
<br/>
As with you, this kind of sealed our fate. Arbitrary rules like this were so incredibly insane.<br/>
<br/>

a book report was assigned. When i turned in my book report, i got a <br/>
failing grade (an E...do other places have that? I never went to a <br/>
school that gave out Fs) because it was written in pen, and the <br/>
teacher had said to write it in pencil. No &quot;rewrite this&quot;, no &quot;i&#39;ll <br/>
mark you down one letter&quot;...he didnt even read it. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if most teachers know that the things they do can stay with <br/>
their students forever. I dont think i will ever forget Mrs. <br/>
Stefacik telling Jimmy Lear he had to turn the garter snakes (that <br/>
he&#39;d brought in a coffee can and was hiding in his locker)loose <br/>
outside because &quot;their part of nature and belong outside&quot;--they were <br/>
his brother&#39;s snakes! Or another teacher telling me to &quot;go back and <br/>
walk&quot; when i was running down the school hallway in fourth grade---<br/>
no matter that a diabetic kid was having problems in gym and i was <br/>
sent to go get his teacher as fast as possible. <br/>
<br/>
Do they even go over this in teacher training? Do they say &quot;The <br/>
things you say and do can scar a kid for life, or leave them with <br/>
happy memories of you, so choose carefully&quot;?? I&#39;ve often thought <br/>
about writing seamus&#39; former kindergarten teacher, and telling her <br/>
about how he still remembers the awful things she did, and that he <br/>
is happily unschooling, but she should be more caring in the future. <br/>

up on math. I&#39;d always enjoyed it and been good at it. <br/>
<br/>
And then there was _that_ teacher...on quizes and tests, you lost <br/>
full credit for a minor mistake, like forgetting a negative sign or <br/>
copying the answer wrong from your work to the answer blank. I got <br/>
the same low score on one quiz as Steve sitting behind me, who didn&#39;t <br/>
understand a damn thing that was going on in class. <br/>
<br/>
So I really couldn&#39;t see the point in trying after that. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I loved the reasoning behind the policy. If you were an <br/>
engineer building a bridge, it wouldn&#39;t matter if it were a &quot;little&quot; <br/>
mistake or not, the bridge would still fall down. <br/>
<br/>
Yeh.<br/>
<br/>
I may sometimes say things to my kids that wound them, but we have a <br/>
strong enough relationship that they can complain and react and we&#39;ll <br/>
go on to build a stronger bond. I never felt close enough to a <br/>
teacher to heal anything negative that was said to me. I just got a <br/>
little more defeated about school--but fortunately, not about <br/>
learning.<br/>

<br/>
I remember a girl in the fifth grade (one grade ahead of me) asking to <br/>
go use the restroom (because she was starting her period, for the first <br/>
time) and the teacher refused.  He made her wait until after the lesson <br/>
and by then she had bled through her clothes and onto the chair and <br/>
then everyone in the class knew!  In fifth grade we had to draw and <br/>
color every state bird, flower, flag, and state on large index cards <br/>
and my teacher gave me an F because she didn&#39;t believe I did it myself. <br/>
  I could draw and write pretty well for my age.  This was after my <br/>
evil, wicked stepmother made me stay in my whole spring break and do <br/>
this!  The teacher didn&#39;t believe my stepmother either when she called <br/>
her.  This teacher was always saying how she was perfect and that she <br/>
thought she made a mistake once, but she was wrong!  My teacher was the <br/>
wife to the teacher above!  So happy my 3 little ones will never have <br/>
to deal with school.<br/>

&gt;&gt;this were so incredibly insane.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I want to share my own most bizarre teacher&#39;s arbitrary rule experience.<br/>
It was a 7th grade math teacher.  Math was my favorite subject.  I loved<br/>
it, lived to do all the homework, could have done more, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Well, this particular teacher not only graded the math, but the spelling,<br/>
the neatness, the organization of the work, how you showed your work, etc.<br/>
If there was anything, and I mean *anything* out of place, you got an F.<br/>
You were required to completely re-write the entire homework assignment,<br/>
and then if you got it perfect you would receive the grade she would have<br/>
given you the first time.<br/>
<br/>
I used to spend hours getting absolutely every question on the homework<br/>
perfect, with my penmanship, spelling, etc.  I would dote over it until it<br/>
was just pristine, and then I would find one place where I would make a<br/>
really silly mistake - something that had nothing to do with the math - and<br/>
I would purposely put in that one mistake and hand in my homework.  I never<br/>
intended to redo it.  I was getting a straight F in the class, and I was<br/>
driving the teacher mad in the process.  Eventually my Mom got me<br/>
transferred to a new teacher, who came to be quite confused as to why I was<br/>
getting all Fs, because I got straight As on all of his work!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always loved to mess with the system ;-)<br/>

It&#39;s a sort of consumer rating page- good ratings as well as bad.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, I went to the homepage, and it looked civilized <br/>
and possibly useful. My professor dh reads it and sometimes adjusts his <br/>
teaching in response. He says a lot of the criticisms are more funny <br/>
than vicious, but he&#39;s pretty thick skinned, I have yet to hear of <br/>
another professor who will go near it, or even let anybody tell them <br/>
what it says about them. But they know it&#39;s out there. Yes indeed they <br/>
do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537804865">I taught myself to read at age 2 and according to my Mom I had an <br/>
insatiable curiosity until, you guessed it, I started school.  My <br/>
parents didn&#39;t know what to do with me because I refused to do anything <br/>
more than put my name on the paper in first grade.  They had me tested, <br/>
I was labeled &quot;gifted&quot; and from that moment forward every decision my <br/>
parents made revolved around my schooling.  I was shuffled from one <br/>
school to another in search of a decent gifted program and because my <br/>
family moved several times.  I was unhappy in every one except one <br/>
special program that was &quot;child led&quot; (but it was an hour bus ride each <br/>
way).  I was in that program 1 year before we moved again--from DC to <br/>
Chicago.  Again, my parents and three siblings sacrificed a lot so that <br/>
I could go to the best school in the area (on the North Shore--where all <br/>
the John Hughes teen angst movies were filmed-- my high school was in <br/>
the nation&#39;s top 5).  We moved into a house that was way too small for <br/>
the 6 of us and needed major renovations so we could be in this very <br/>
affluent school district. <br/>
<br/>
I entered 4th grade there halfway through the year.  On my first day of <br/>
school I proudly wore my favorite jump suit that my grandmother had made <br/>
for me.  It had a matching hat and was 100% polyester.  Before I was <br/>
even welcomed into the classrom, I was scolded by the teacher for <br/>
wearing a hat in class in front of everyone.  I was also teased <br/>
mercilessly for having homemade polyester clothes instead of all the <br/>
&quot;preppy&quot; fashions, which my family couldn&#39;t afford.  That was the <br/>
beginning of many years of hell, which included horrible teasing, mean <br/>
teachers, and rare moments of actual learning.  This led to serious <br/>
teenage rebellion, complete with drug use and ditching class.  The only <br/>
things that got me through it were being in orchestra and having a few <br/>
good teachers. <br/>
<br/>
My husband was in one school system his whole life (Albuquerque) and <br/>
spent most of grade school and middle school trying to figure out how to <br/>
not get beaten up.  He developed a deep rage that he still struggles <br/>
with today.  The only thing that saved him was joining a cajun music <br/>
group (of adults--he was 14) and seeking solace from touring and the <br/>
companionship of adults.<br/>
<br/>
The other day a friend and I were at the store and we ran into a mutual <br/>
acquaintance who we hadn&#39;t seen for a while.  The acquaintance asked me <br/>
if I was still going to homeschool (our kids are all turning 5 this <br/>
year) and I said yes.  She asked my friend if they were too and she said <br/>
&quot;hell, no!&quot;  I felt so sad to think that she wouldn&#39;t even consider the <br/>
effects that school might have on her kids.  I said &quot;wow, if you asked <br/>
me if I was going to send my kids to school the answer would be a <br/>
resounding &#39;hell no!&#39;&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
NO WAY!  (unless they want to, of course)<br/>

Kirby showed me a site called something more like rate your professor, and <br/>
his English teacher wasn&#39;t listed but another one was.  One of the ratings was <br/>
&quot;hot&quot; and so the teachers were marked as whether they were easy to look at, I <br/>
guess, basically. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
