&lt;&lt; do you mean the mother drank two regular size bottles and one smaller<br/>
 bottle of wine by herself?  That is a lot of wine for an adult!  I would<br/>
 be falling over drunk and then hung over for probably two days<br/>
 afterwards! &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
   Yes. She wasn&#39;t &quot;drunk&quot; either. Amazing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371980379">That is a symptom of a heavy drinker. When you drink a lot frequently, you<br/>
don&#39;t get as drunk, almost like building an immunity. The alcohol is still<br/>
in your bloodstream, but the outward signs are not as noticeable. Kinda<br/>
scary for that baby. If I have more than one glass I get tipsy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263061213">My mother had that tolerance.  She drank vodka every night after work.  I<br/>
cannot to this day tell how she managed to get up every morning and go to<br/>
work!<br/>
<br/>
The sure cure for me was working as a cocktail waitress back in the dark<br/>
ages and seeing how absolutely stupid people act when they have even a<br/>
couple of drinks.  They think they have it all together, that the alcohol<br/>
isn&#39;t having any effect on them and that they are soooo cool, NOT!!!  I<br/>
decided right then and there that I was never going to spend money to make<br/>
myself look that foolish!<br/>
