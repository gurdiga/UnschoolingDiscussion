 </span></blockquote>Madeline, thanks for sharing that very informative post.  Although I didn&#39;t <br/>
start the thread on eczema/food allergies/healthy eating, I have loved it and <br/>
learned so much.  And at least for me, it is VERY unschooling related.  My <br/>
hands (last summer) got so bad I had to go for days doing nothing...couldn&#39;t <br/>
garden, cook (any food made my hands burn) shower,...even holding a book would make <br/>
them itch.  Forget rubbing a kid&#39;s back or my husband&#39;s...and I was just <br/>
plain miserable.  I&#39;d like to talk even more with you about your transition.  It <br/>
sounds like something I really need.  We have a small farm and grow a LOT of <br/>
our own food with absolutely no pesticides/herbacides at all.  It takes a long <br/>
time, but I just pick bugs and bug eggs off the plants, and let the chickens <br/>
run through the garden once a week or so for about an hour and pick bugs and <br/>
weeds.  <br/>
<br/>
I am into day 3 of no milk, no wheat, no tomatoes, no strawberries, no eggs, <br/>
no soy,...when I get ready to eat something I think whether it was mentioned <br/>
as an allergen and avoid it.  I have had to shear sheep though, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think that (wool and lanolin) bothers me because for the past 3 days or so my <br/>
hands seem to be healing and are so soft.  Probably the only think I can&#39;t avoid <br/>
is dust/dust mites.  Our house is INCREDIBLY dusty (open walls, we&#39;re doing <br/>
construction) but I&#39;ve had this eczema forever (as a kid I had it terribly on my <br/>
feet) and never before now lived in an extremely dusty house. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing your story.  I may email you, with your farming techniques <br/>
you sound a lot like us and what we&#39;re trying to establish at our homestead.<br/>

My farmer husband recommends Elliot Coleman&#39;s New Organic Gardener.  He says to get the most revised edition.  Now I&#39;m worried I left something outof the title, and he&#39;s at the market.   This should find it for you though.  It has a lot about hoop houses which might be a good idea with such a short growing season (aren&#39;t you Nancy from B.C.?)   You can also e-mail us anytime with questions. He has learned a lot by just doing it, for 11 years.   Hang in there with the food.  You&#39;ve given up a lot!   My dh had eczema on his feet as well when he had it as a child and when he would eat really badly as an adult.  That must be horrible.  I know salt water helps as well.  I hope you are able to find a homeopathic Dr.  My MIL does consultations with people all over the world by phone if you can&#39;t find anyone there.  E-mail me privately.   But seeing someone in person would def. be preferable, I would think.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually I&#39;m the Nancy from West Virginia.  But our growing season is pretty <br/>
short...seems like there&#39;s a tiny window of time we can get things in or it&#39;s <br/>
too late.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I have heard of that book.  I really like anything on Permaculture.  <br/>
I did have the huge Permaculture Manual by Bill Mollison, but it was like a <br/>
science textbook and I could never get past the first chapters.  So I sold it <br/>
and got, instead, the Introduction to Permaculture book which is much more user <br/>
friendly.  <br/>
<br/>
My hands were feeling great for about 3 days, then I started going through <br/>
files, shelves, drawers, etc doing some heavy duty decluttering, and they&#39;re <br/>
itching again.  I&#39;m thinking it might have to do with all the ink and chemicals <br/>
on the papers.  Still, it&#39;s nothing like it had been.  I was well on my way to <br/>
ending up like I did last summer at the beginning of this week and knew I had <br/>
to do something.  Thanks again for the help.<br/>
<br/>
