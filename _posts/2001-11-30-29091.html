<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098424901">I tend to agree with Kolleen too.  It&#39;s just that we seem to define<br/>
things a little differently.  And here&#39;s the biggest thing right now;<br/>
Where do you draw the line between physical problems, emotional problems<br/>
and academic ones?  How frustrated does one need to be before she tries<br/>
to find out if there is an underlying condition like dyslexia causing<br/>
some of the problems?  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is on Prozac at 16.  I&#39;m not happy about it and I hope she<br/>
learns to cope without it but it really is what she needs right now -<br/>
unless you think it is okay for her to sleep 17 hours a day and sit<br/>
absolutely still for most of the other 7 and not care what&#39;s happening<br/>
around her (and no that is NOT an exaggeration).  But I still have people<br/>
telling me about how often prozac is overprescribed.<br/>
<br/>
And we are right back to where we started when I joined this list - - The<br/>
only people who can judge what really needs to be done and when something<br/>
really is a problem are those who are living with it.  You can&#39;t tell me<br/>
what I HAVE to do to make my son happy, I can&#39;t tell you what to do for<br/>
yours, we can only offer to share what happened to us and hope that it<br/>
may be helpful to others, who have to judge that for themselves.<br/>

of some stuff here, my email client sent it for me (how nice). Hence the <br/>
reason I sent it with nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This must be a difficult situation for you and your family. I don&#39;t think <br/>
you are exaggerating.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, prozac is overprescribed. It shouldn&#39;t have been developed at all. <br/>
But what does one do when the normal conventions of the Western world <br/>
dictate necessities for medications like that.<br/>
<br/>
In a perfect world, there would be no poisons that alter our normal state <br/>
of being. There would be no vaccinations, no environmental issues. We <br/>
would give birth to children that only need GOOD air, food, water and <br/>
love to become a healthy adult.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t live in a perfect world. The violent acts that are put upon our <br/>
bodies, just by existing on an earth that suffers as much as its <br/>
inhabitants, are nearly impossible to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
If I went into detail of the low-level virii and bacteria in our water <br/>
systems alone, it would take it so off-list that I dare not get specific. <br/>
<br/>
We all are aware of the inescapability of dioxins, hormone-disrupters and <br/>
the breakdown of immune systems on a cellular level.<br/>
<br/>
The need for &#39;band-aids&#39; was borne out of a breakdown in humanity. In the <br/>
way we have allowed civilization to progress. Everything from education, <br/>
to pregnacy being treated as a disease, to substance that is passed off <br/>
as food (GMO, pesticides etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Embracing unschooling as a lifestyle is a small part of turning the world <br/>
around. Hopefully, it will happen before the earth gives up on us. (I <br/>
have faith)<br/>
<br/>
Until then, there will be &#39;medical&#39; interventions that wouldn&#39;t happen if <br/>
we had ample opportunity to give our children the *true* substances their <br/>
bodies need.<br/>
<br/>

exclusive. In a *natural* world -- which is the one evolution has shaped us<br/>
to live in -- those who aren&#39;t biologically fit, die.<br/>
<br/>
Though it would be nice to be able to blame the ills of the body on external<br/>
chemistry, I think it does a great diservice to those who have genetically<br/>
different chemistry to assume they could be better if they&#39;d just eat better<br/>
and avoid unnatural chemicals. (There&#39;s plenty of natural chemicals that are<br/>
poisonous too.)<br/>
<br/>
In fact it&#39;s because biology isn&#39;t perfect that we&#39;re here at all. It&#39;s the<br/>
small chance genetic changes -- many neutral, many bad, a few good -- that<br/>
allow a species to exploit the environment in new ways. The bad changes die<br/>
off and the good gain an advantage in reproduction.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible in a more &quot;natural&quot; society, many of the people who have<br/>
problems adapting to modern society would thrive. It&#39;s possible that many of<br/>
the people who adapt very well to modern society would be ill suited and<br/>
considered crazy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for your kind words about Rachel.  I&#39;ve BTDT with anti-<br/>
depressents in the past.  My problem is that if there is a rare and <br/>
unusual side-effect, I&#39;m the rare and unusual person who gets it - <br/>
especially where neorological drugs are concerned.  She seems to <br/>
tolerate them better than I but I am still trying to help her <br/>
understand how I survive without them.  I avoid chemicals as much as <br/>
I can.  Lowering exposure to cleaners, perfumes, additives, food <br/>
coloring, etc. helps me immensely.  Knowing what foods set off what <br/>
reaction helps a lot too but takes a long tome to sort out.  <br/>
<br/>
Having been sick enough to be on handfuls of pills daily (post MI) I <br/>
now rebel against any extras.  My doctor and I disagree on my <br/>
philosophy that the barest minimum of meds to keep me breathing is <br/>
the way to go.  I don&#39;t NEED two accolate a day for 9 months out of <br/>
the year, I NEED them for the other 3.  SHe wants me to take them all <br/>
the time, I refuse.<br/>
<br/>
And just to tie this back to unschooling, I think that the &quot;everyone <br/>
needs to be doing the same things at the same times&quot; attitude is a <br/>
definite contribitung factor in overprescribing drugs.  If you can&#39;t <br/>
cope with life at all or are desperately unhappy, it is time to <br/>
explore the options - including drugs - BUT If you are just having <br/>
trouble doing the stuff someone else thinks you should do, then you <br/>
need to explore life instead.<br/>

altering our environment but I also think that nature plays a part in <br/>
our problems too.  But we all need  to learn to take what we need to <br/>
feel good and leave the rest.  The problem is with those who want to <br/>
say, &quot;Well this worked for me, if it doesn&#39;t work for you, you must <br/>

might or might not work.<br/>

Including natural selection in which those that aren&#39;t fit to survive, <br/>
won&#39;t.<br/>

&gt;poisonous too.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just as &#39;unschooling&#39; wasn&#39;t even conceived of at some point in society <br/>
(with the exception of a few) its hard to imagine that genetically <br/>
different chemistry can&#39;t be altered.<br/>
Finding available information on people like Dr. Schimmel(Vegatest before <br/>
Occidental Institute bought out his Vegatest and altered its purpose) and <br/>
other such modern day pioneers, is as difficult as it was to find a book <br/>
on today as the Family Bed was 75 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I&#39;m just a person. I haven&#39;t done anything that alters the future of <br/>
education or of medicine. BUT I have been lucky enough to have met many <br/>
who have, simply by being related to one of the pioneers.<br/>
<br/>
The toxic information that sits on the RNA/DNA can be altered. Can be <br/>
repaired. Or rather it can be given what it needs to repair itself. <br/>
<br/>
That information is on there for many reasons. And like I said in the <br/>
past we simply cannot just eat right anymore to balance our bodies. We as <br/>
a planet have become too many generations of such toxicitys to do that <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
There was a few books that best explained it in english. I lent them out <br/>
(of course) and haven&#39;t been able to track them down, even on the <br/>
internet. One of them called &#39;Hidden Killers&#39; about the low level virii <br/>
that is the root of a good number of neurological disorders and disease. <br/>
The other explained the non-invasive medicine that would hopefully be the <br/>
future &#39;21st Century Medicine&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Will the truth of how the body can cure itself, when given what it needs <br/>
on a cellular level ever surface to mainstream? It all depends on how our <br/>
future unfolds in regards to corporate ownership of the earth and its <br/>
inhabitants.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you are saying in the above. I think its a situation <br/>
where so much of what I&#39;ve learned and seen cannot be summed up in just a <br/>
few sentences.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, it goes against the core of what we all learned as far as <br/>
Medicine.<br/>
<br/>
But after seeing people walk who were doomed to death, after seeing small <br/>
miracles like &#39;slow&#39; children show light and laughter for the first time, <br/>
I&#39;m barely scraping the surface of the neurological advances here... <br/>
after seeing it, I can beleive it.<br/>
<br/>
I AM NOT AN EXPERT on this. Hence my feeble attempts at trying to explain <br/>
a science that just might be our future. I say might because it goes <br/>
against everything that is already in place. And what we would do with <br/>
all those people in the medical field (non-emergency) if they became <br/>
obsolete overnight. I&#39;m a cynic when it comes to fighting the AMA, the <br/>
CDC or the big pharmaceutical companys.<br/>
<br/>
How do you explain to a person who had gone to school for 12 years that <br/>
MOST, not all, of what they learned was wrong? How do you tell them that <br/>
unseen influences matter? Something that can&#39;t be studied under a <br/>
microscope actually exists? Making a book such as &#39;The Dancing WuLi <br/>
Masters, a laymans guide to quantum physics&#39; required reading ISN&#39;T going <br/>
to happen anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that thinking outside the norm like pioneers before us in <br/>
other fields, can hopefully allow those that do engage in this research <br/>
to continue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, None of this research is done stateside. None of the people I <br/>
mentioned were treated stateside. Too many lobbyists in Washington. <br/>
<br/>
Joyce, I&#39;m not here to debate issues with you that I generally stay quiet <br/>
about. Unfortunately, learning, moods, abilitys, education, health all <br/>
seem to come together and sometimes become hard to distingush.<br/>
