<br/>
Ben cut out a really good article from the publisher of _Forbes_ <br/>
magazine. &quot;Real-World Advice for the Young.&quot; It&#39;s very school-y, but <br/>
he&#39;s pointing out that we need to focus and the children&#39;s strengths, <br/>
not their weaknesses....duh! How &quot;partnering&quot;---finding someone who <br/>
shares your interest, but has strengths where you are weak. Yeah! Like <br/>
CHEATING! &lt;bwg&gt; You rely on his strengths, he relies on yours, and you <br/>
make a good team.<br/>
<br/>
Gatto has his own website where you can read several things he&#39;s <br/>
written and find out what else he&#39;s up to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093807716">I think this has more grounds in science than you could imagine.  I remember<br/>
learning in some psychology class about how if you don&#39;t have a certain need<br/>
met as an infant or a child you can get stuck in that stage for the rest of<br/>
your life?  Remember?  That&#39;s why people were said to have &quot;oral fixations?&quot;<br/>
What is the psychological term for that?  Am I off?  Who are the<br/>
psychologists associated with this concept?  Maybe this will help in<br/>
learning more about why if we aren&#39;t allowed to &#39;just be kids&#39; we can get<br/>
stuck in a perpetual childhood even in adulthood?  Does this make sense?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049826382">Yes, it is a Freudian concept.  You pretty much have it.  There <br/>
are &quot;psychosexual&quot; stages (oral, anal, genital), if one stage isn&#39;t <br/>
fulfilled, you stay (according to the theory) stuck in that phase, <br/>
until the need is met.  Then you can move on.  So if you, for <br/>
instance get stuck in the oral phase, you continue to pursue <br/>
pleasure orally (cigarettes, overeating, etc.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450921729"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;for instance get stuck in the oral phase, you<br/>

&gt;overeating, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking more along a different line than the<br/>
Freudian (sp?) one of early childhood development<br/>
blocks to maturity I think.  I was thinking of the way<br/>
young people in our culture have their blossoming<br/>
independence and maturity squashed and stifled at a<br/>
critical time as young adults when they should be<br/>
making that leap from childhood to adulthood.  We<br/>
stand in their way with laws (applying to &quot;minors&quot;<br/>
under a sweepingly general age) as well as (and<br/>
perhaps more importantly) with the general familial<br/>
and cultural message at every turn that they are<br/>
stupid, irresponsible, incapable children until the<br/>
sudden magic morning of their 18th birthday.  For some<br/>
families even that age milestone is not enough, and<br/>
the continue to hold thier young adult offspring under<br/>
their thumbs until well into their 20s or beyond. <br/>
Just to clarify, I am not talking about kicking &quot;kids&quot;<br/>
out at 18 or telling them when to &quot;mature&quot; but rather<br/>
about not getting in their way when they are doing it<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In light of how other list members were thinking of<br/>
this &quot;extended childhood concept&quot; in a somewhat<br/>
opposite way to what I was, that our kids are not<br/>
ALLOWED to be children at a young age (which I also<br/>
believe) and thus they are unable to progress into<br/>
maturity when the time comes, it&#39;s got me considering<br/>
how those factors collide.  We have an interesting<br/>
paradox in our culture where children are expected to<br/>
act like miniature adults while not extended any of<br/>
the courtesies, respect or independence that comes<br/>
with that status.  The results, I feel, are often<br/>
twisted and broken adults who don&#39;t know who or what<br/>
they are or where they belong and have little or no<br/>
confidence in their own abilities or decisions.<br/>
<br/>
As a radical unschooler, how do I best avoid such<br/>
pitfalls both early in childhood and in young<br/>
adulthood, or how do I mitigate and repair damages<br/>
done by this set of circumstances?  Of course I have<br/>
my own ideas and approaches but I am interested in<br/>
what others have to say about this topic also. <br/>
Thoughts?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are on the same page, I&#39;m just remembering that there is some psychology<br/>
- research out there to back that up.  Did Erickson (sp) say anything about<br/>
this?  It seems there was an article on Ann&#39;s website about how she met him<br/>
and he seemed to have something to say about this?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  I am guilty of that as I have wanted to manipulate my oldest son into<br/>
being at home next year instead of returning to public school.  I need to<br/>
respect his decision.  He&#39;s 13 and has opinions and reasons for making that<br/>
decision.  I need to step back, know that he sees the pros and cons of both,<br/>
and let him decide and live out that choice.  I have told him that I am<br/>
proud of him no matter what he decides.  It&#39;s a choice that will affect his<br/>
life and he&#39;s getting good practice at making choices that come with<br/>
freedom.  The choices are all wonderful for him - makes it hard to decide -<br/>
but that&#39;s freedom.  <br/>
