<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457949473">I was just wondering if there are any online forums that unschooled <br/>
kids belong to.  My kids really only write emails to their dad when he <br/>
is gone.  They mostly talk to relatives on the phone.  All the friends <br/>
that they have ever made have been lost in the sauce of life.  We move <br/>
approximately every 2.5 years and maybe because they were younger or <br/>
whatever they just never kept in touch.  I think it would be nice if <br/>
there were some other kids that they could relate to.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were also very sheltered from life itself so they have never <br/>
had the experience of having an online conversation with someone.  <br/>
Just curious if you all knew of anything or sites I could point them <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 11.5, almost 10 (going on 30), 8, 6 and 5.  Most likely <br/>
only the older 3 would be wanting to participate.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Dana</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465210424">I suggest that you make it to Albuquerque next September - the kids  <br/>
will almost certainly make friends there and then want to carry on  <br/>
those friendships online.<br/>
<br/>
There are message boards for kids at &lt;unschooling.info/forum&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452082242">Is there a similar forum for teens?  We checked the Kids Talk out <br/>
and my sons (11 and 12) thought it was a little juvenile.  They are <br/>
instead devouring the discussions of Harry Potter &quot;spoilers.&quot;<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Marge (back to lurking)<br/>
