<div id="ygrps-yiv-68513802">Overheard, Holly&#39;s end of a phone conversation to a friend she hasn&#39;t seen for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I got a job at Walgreens.<br/>
(other... unheard)<br/>
All of it.  Mostly cashier, because I never give people the wrong change.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to ask her, but will here speculate that others she works with have given people the wrong change to the point that they sent them to stock shelves or clean something.  <br/>
<br/>
One of her co-workers is nursing and co-sleeping with a child who is already walking and talking, but had never heard of unschooling, and asked Holly more than once how it could be that if she didn&#39;t go to high school she has any friends. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Just a little data point. :-)<br/>
