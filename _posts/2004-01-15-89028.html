[news] -  AmericanMaid - @ 12:16 pm <br/>
well, it was about time again, the latest strongbad cartoon is absolutely the <br/>
best. If you have ever played any video games back in the old days, you must <br/>
watch this… Gives me some good ideas for my own game, if I ever get around to <br/>
coding it <br/>
PS. if you ever were as addicted to Zork as I was, you must play Thy <br/>
Dungeonman at the end… <br/>

How far did you get in Dungeonman? I “won”, but I couldn’t figure out what <br/>
to do with the rope or the flask. <br/>

not sure what to do with the flask, however you can hang yourself with the <br/>
rope “take rope” I think was the command I used… Too funny. Kicking Dennis did <br/>
not work either  <br/>

you can TALK to dennis, GIVE TRINKET to dennis, and that’s about it. I worked <br/>
for almost an hour running basic text-based RPG commands, and barely any <br/>
worked. You can look at stuff (LOOK at FLASK) but the reaction is always the same. <br/>
I even tried ‘RUN STRONG_BAD_EMAIL.EXE’ and stuff like that. No good. <br/>

Try grabbing the flask a couple more times…after a couple of tries you can <br/>
finally grab it and something happens. <br/>

Or you can just say “get flask”, and it gets it.<br/>
My list of commands:<br/>
“Direction” — Goes a direction, such as north, south, dennis, or not dennis. <br/>
Must type the name of the direction in place of direction.<br/>
“Get ___” — Used to get an item.<br/>
“Take ____” — Used to take an item. See “Get ___”<br/>
“Dance” — This one’s great. Makes you dance.<br/>
“Talk ____” — Talks to someone/thing. If you choose someone who’s not a <br/>
registered person to talk to, it brings up a funny message. (&quot;Talk someone from <br/>
work&quot;)<br/>
“Look ___” — Looks at something. If it doesn’t have a pre-set message, it <br/>
brings up a default.<br/>
“Go ____” — Same as direction. If it’s not a pre-set direction, you get a <br/>
default message.<br/>
That’s all I can recall. There’s probably more I know, but they’re not <br/>
springing to mind. <br/>
