&gt;It makes a slick, shiny, malleable stuff, like Slime(tm) without the<br/>
&gt;stickiness. I thought we&#39;d have  probs with the color staining<br/>
&gt;things, but nope. It&#39;s just gloppy and stretchy and gooey. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I just bought some Borax yesterday and I think we&#39;ll definitely try making<br/>
this.<br/>
My boys would love it.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Borax, I just had to let everyone know about the success I had<br/>
yesterday.<br/>
I never could figure out why my white laundry loads came out looking dingy<br/>
and gray.<br/>
And when I looked in the washing machine while a load is washing, there&#39;s<br/>
hardly any suds - just gray water.<br/>
<br/>
I saw the Queen of Clean talking about this and it happens if you have hard<br/>
water.<br/>
Any detergent you buy won&#39;t even work as well as it should if your water is<br/>
hard - I guess we have really hard water!<br/>
Anyway, mix 1 cup Borax and 1 cup washing soda (couldn&#39;t find that so I just<br/>
used baking soda) into 1 gallon container of warm water. Shake and mix to<br/>
dissolve and add 1-2 cups of this mixture to your wash load (white or<br/>
colors) and you will have soft water and lots of wonderful suds. I tried it<br/>
yesterday with a load of whites and they really came out white. I was so<br/>
impressed.<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share my success. :-)<br/>
