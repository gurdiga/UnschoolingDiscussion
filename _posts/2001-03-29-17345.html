<div id="ygrps-yiv-159145405">Hi--I am also new to the list. We are very interested in unschooling and feel <br/>
that we have been doing this--to a degree--since our first child was born. <br/>
Since we &quot;officially&quot; decided not to put our children into public school, I <br/>
have found unschooling.com and this email list to be extremely informative. <br/>
Thanks! <br/>
<br/>
My question is to the people discussing limiting TV. My 5 year old is not <br/>
limited on the computer and we do not have nintendo, gameboy, etc. BUT--he <br/>
LOVES the TV. My 3 yr old never watched TV--not even Barney :) But suddenly <br/>
she watches it whenever her brother watches it. I do limit TV  --my son has <br/>
to ask me to watch it and then I give my answer and usually its a yes if I <br/>
can&#39;t entice him to do something else right at that moment. I know this is <br/>
probably a big &quot;no no&quot; right? How did any of you deal w/TV  specifically at <br/>
this young age (5 and under). Do you feel there is a difference when they are <br/>
young? or no difference at all? My son does not seem to resent this set up at <br/>
this point but I&#39;m sure that may change--any advice appreciated. Thanks! Merri</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336652503">Ever since my kids began to talk, when they say they want to watch tv I say,<br/>
oh how many shows are you going to watch?  They usually say one or two.<br/>
This seems to help them think about how much time they want to spend doing<br/>
it, where otherwise they would just vegetate all day (which they sometimes<br/>
choose to do).  I don&#39;t turn off the tv if they change their minds, or try<br/>
to convince them to watch the amount of tv I think they &quot;should&quot; watch.  It<br/>
has always been totally their decision.  They know why I ask the question,<br/>
and they are very responsible tv viewers - probably more so than I am.  -Rue<br/>

Hi Merri<br/>
<br/>
Personally I believe that limiting any interest does not reflect the ideals <br/>
of unschooling.  My TV is on all the time and my kids would rather do just <br/>
about anything else.  During the summer they rarely watch because we are <br/>
outside so much.  When I suggest an activity they show NO hesitation to leave <br/>
the TV.  Even when it&#39;s on they are usually doing something else.<br/>

  learning, it does not mean that I give my kids free reign<br>to do whatever

  because of our own principles. For instance, in our family<br>we&#39;re 
  vegetarians, we boycott all Nestle products, we don&#39;t allow toy guns<br>in our 
  house, we ride our bicycles instead of taking our car, we buy 
  almost<br>everything second-hand, and we don&#39;t watch TV. All of these things, 
  we<br>believe are for the overall health and well-being of our family and/or 
  for<br>the health and well-being of our earth.and other people. Are we 
  not<br>unschooling because we&#39;re vegetarian?? Not unschooling because we won&#39;t 
  buy<br>our son a mini replica Uzi? Not unschooling because we don&#39;t watch 
  the<br>television? Not unschooling because our kids have to bicycle instead 
  of<br>riding in the car? To me, unschooling is not a list of things we do or 
  do<br>not do, it&#39;s a mind-set that allows my children to learn by following 
  their<br>own interests instead of being told what to learn, when, and where. 
  I<br>*don&#39;t* believe that means I have to allow them access to every single 
  way<br>to learn things. Sure, they could learn anatomy and human sexuality 
  by<br>watching porn movies. They could learn about hurricanes by watching 
  TV.<br>Both, *I personally* believe are damaging. And why do I think TV 
  is<br>damaging? Because young children don&#39;t have the mental context to place 
  the<br>images they see in. Sure, my son might be watching a show about 
  hurricanes,<br>but he will also see commercials where it is implied that you 
  need this,<br>that, or the other product in order to be happy in life. He will 
  see ads for<br>things that we are not going to buy (for frugality and 
  earth-saving reasons)<br>and that until that point he didn&#39;t know existed 
  (thus making his life and<br>ours so much happier, not to know about all the 
  things you can&#39;t have :-).<br>He will also see ads for other programs with 
  guns blazing or scantily clad<br>people pawing each other. At some point in 
  his life, he&#39;ll be able to put<br>these images in a context, but it&#39;s pretty 
  clear that right now all they do<br>is cause him concern, judging by the way 
  he&#39;s reacted when he&#39;s seen them.<br>He&#39;s an extraordinarily sensitive child

  also think it&#39;s dangerous to generalize from one&#39;s own personal<br>experiences

  and my kids never touch it&quot;, or &quot;we have the TV on all the time and<br>my kids 
  rarely watch it&quot;. Well this is great, and it may work quite well for<br>those 
  individual families. I also know families that have candy out all the<br>time 
  and their kids are 40 pounds overweight. And I know families<br>that have the 
  TV on all the time and the kids are glued to it like<br>little sponges for 7 
  hours a day. So much depends on individual kids and the<br>preferences and 
  innate personalities they were born with, as well as the<br>family 
  environment. All of this &quot;it&#39;s unschooling to do this&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Excellent post, Robin. Homeschooling gives us the 
advantage of being sensitive to what &quot;our&quot;(we don&#39;t really own them) children 
can handle and are ready for. Sometimes we must set limits. Unschooling as I 
understand it means my children learn as they want. I have one son who hardly 
watches TV but my oldest daughter would sit in front of it morning till night if 
I let her. She has even thanked me later for making her shut it off! As adults 
we need imut from our friend and family sometimes when our lives are not in 
balance. By that I don&#39;t mean I listen to everything people have to say and 
agree, but I listen and see if they are right.</font></div>

  environment. All of this &quot;it&#39;s unschooling to do this&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s

  but<br>they&#39;re really not&quot;, etc. (not just responding to this particular post 
  but<br>to many in the same vein) remind me of my high school punk rock days. 
  It was<br>&quot;punk&quot; to do this, but &quot;poser&quot; to do that. I could never keep it 
  all<br>straight and I still can&#39;t. If I wasn&#39;t &quot;punk&quot; because I wore 
  Birkenstocks<br>with my mohawk, and I&#39;m not &quot;unschooling&quot; because I limit TV,

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Collette<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, that&#39;s a very thought-provoking question and has a couple of different<br/>
facets to it. We&#39;re vegetarians for many different reasons. I guess the<br/>
first and foremost would be for the earth&#39;s sake. The amount of water,<br/>
energy, chemicals, land abuse, etc. needed to sustain production of meat<br/>
animals is horrific on the environment. Secondly would be health reasons, we<br/>
eat organic produce or stuff we grow ourselves, I don&#39;t want to be putting<br/>
meat into our bodies that has hormones, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. in it,<br/>
and also I feel that meat doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to my body on a cellular<br/>
level (I&#39;ve been a veggie for going on 20 years now, it was when I started<br/>
exercising and came to a better awareness of my body that I first felt how<br/>
wrong it felt for my own body to eat meat). Thirdly would be animal-loving<br/>
reasons as the way most meat animals are raised and slaughtered is pretty<br/>
inhumane. But I&#39;m not totally against eating meat for this reason - if it<br/>
was like my ancestors where it was myself, a deer , and an arrow, I&#39;d most<br/>
likely shoot the deer. After all, the mountain lion would be doing the same<br/>
thing, nature is in itself fairly cruel to animals across the board. But<br/>
modern methods go above and beyond in the cruelty department and so I don&#39;t<br/>
like to support them.<br/>
<br/>
That brings us to the aquarium. This is an issue I&#39;ve gone back and forth on<br/>
for many years. Do I go to zoos, circuses, wild animal parks, or not? On one<br/>
hand, they are keeping animals in cages which feels wrong to me. On the<br/>
other hand, zoos, aquariums, etc. have come a long way since the day of the<br/>
bear in the concrete cage staring out through the bars. Nowadays most zoos<br/>
are into wildlife research, reproduction, animal-trading with other zoos to<br/>
breed species whose decline in the wild is bordering on extinction, etc. And<br/>
they also play a big role in educating the public about the dangers to our<br/>
earth&#39;s wild areas. So does the good they do balance out the bad? Or does<br/>
the bad of keeping wild animals caged outweigh the good of perhaps saving<br/>
the whole species? Would panda bears be extinct now if people didn&#39;t see how<br/>
magical they are up close and therefore send money, time, and energy to<br/>
organizations to keep their remaining habitat safe? The Oregon Coast<br/>
Aquarium, where we went, has some measure of fame because of their efforts<br/>
to rehabilitate Keiko (the orca from &quot;Free Willy&quot;) and return him to the<br/>
wild. Is supporting this a good thing? Right now, we do go to the aquarium,<br/>
and to the zoo. We don&#39;t go to the circus because I feel that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
have any redeeming qualities, the animals are only there for entertainment<br/>
and no research or educational benefit is present.<br/>
<br/>
A long-winded reply to a question that for me doesn&#39;t have an absolute<br/>
answer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145328556">our tv is on all the time. pbs, nickjr, disney,<br/>
discovery,travel,animal planet, a &quot;cooking<br/>
show&quot;....the possibilities are endless with cable.<br/>
before cable, pbs was on all the time...from sesame<br/>
street until charlie rose started and he just bugs us<br/>
all so we turn it off until arthur or dragontales.<br/>
they are NOT the type to sit still and watch it for<br/>
those HOURS in a row... but they have it on to kinda<br/>
watch while they draw, play, flip, jump on the<br/>
furniture or me, run in and out of the backyard and<br/>
house, tracking mud from their &quot;experiments&quot;<br/>
everywhere... They watch movies for a nice sit down<br/>
treat...or at least half a movie, anyway. :) I don&#39;t<br/>
think it does anything bad to them unless they are<br/>
watching something &quot;bad&quot; or not age appropriate. It<br/>
fuels their imaginations and vocabularies and like<br/>
someone else said sometimes they couldn&#39;t be MADE to<br/>
watch tv. But they learned at a very early age how to<br/>
spell &quot;play&quot; &quot;stop/eject&quot; &quot;POWER&quot; &quot;vol&quot; &quot;chan&quot; &quot;video&quot;<br/>
&quot;VCR&quot;, etc, etc...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:louisaem@...">louisaem@...</a><br/>
&gt;   &gt;Personally I believe that limiting any interest<br/>
&gt; does not reflect the ideals<br/>
&gt;   &gt;of unschooling.  My TV is on all the time and my<br/>
&gt; kids would rather do just<br/>
&gt;   &gt;about anything else.  During the summer they<br/>
&gt; rarely watch because we are<br/>
&gt;   &gt;outside so much.  When I suggest an activity they<br/>
&gt; show NO hesitation to<br/>
&gt;   &gt;leave<br/>
&gt;   &gt;the TV.  Even when it&#39;s on they are usually doing<br/>
&gt; something else.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hmmmm, I&#39;d have to say I respectfully disagree<br/>
&gt; with this one. Unschooling to<br/>
&gt;   me means child-led learning, it does not mean that<br/>
&gt; I give my kids free reign<br/>
&gt;   to do whatever they want whenever they want to.<br/>
&gt; There are things in life<br/>
&gt;   that we limit, because of our own principles. For<br/>
&gt; instance, in our family<br/>
&gt;   we&#39;re vegetarians, we boycott all Nestle products,<br/>
&gt; we don&#39;t allow toy guns<br/>
&gt;   in our house, we ride our bicycles instead of<br/>
&gt; taking our car, we buy almost<br/>
&gt;   everything second-hand, and we don&#39;t watch TV. All<br/>
&gt; of these things, we<br/>
&gt;   believe are for the overall health and well-being<br/>
&gt; of our family and/or for<br/>
&gt;   the health and well-being of our earth.and other<br/>
&gt; people. Are we not<br/>
&gt;   unschooling because we&#39;re vegetarian?? Not<br/>
&gt; unschooling because we won&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt;   our son a mini replica Uzi? Not unschooling<br/>
&gt; because we don&#39;t watch the<br/>
&gt;   television? Not unschooling because our kids have<br/>
&gt; to bicycle instead of<br/>
&gt;   riding in the car? To me, unschooling is not a<br/>
&gt; list of things we do or do<br/>
&gt;   not do, it&#39;s a mind-set that allows my children to<br/>
&gt; learn by following their<br/>
&gt;   own interests instead of being told what to learn,<br/>
&gt; when, and where. I<br/>
&gt;   *don&#39;t* believe that means I have to allow them<br/>
&gt; access to every single way<br/>
&gt;   to learn things. Sure, they could learn anatomy<br/>
&gt; and human sexuality by<br/>
&gt;   watching porn movies. They could learn about<br/>
&gt; hurricanes by watching TV.<br/>
&gt;   Both, *I personally* believe are damaging. And why<br/>
&gt; do I think TV is<br/>
&gt;   damaging? Because young children don&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt; mental context to place the<br/>
&gt;   images they see in. Sure, my son might be watching<br/>
&gt; a show about hurricanes,<br/>
&gt;   but he will also see commercials where it is<br/>
&gt; implied that you need this,<br/>
&gt;   that, or the other product in order to be happy in<br/>
&gt; life. He will see ads for<br/>
&gt;   things that we are not going to buy (for frugality<br/>
&gt; and earth-saving reasons)<br/>
&gt;   and that until that point he didn&#39;t know existed<br/>
&gt; (thus making his life and<br/>
&gt;   ours so much happier, not to know about all the<br/>
&gt; things you can&#39;t have :-).<br/>
&gt;   He will also see ads for other programs with guns<br/>
&gt; blazing or scantily clad<br/>
&gt;   people pawing each other. At some point in his<br/>
&gt; life, he&#39;ll be able to put<br/>
&gt;   these images in a context, but it&#39;s pretty clear<br/>
&gt; that right now all they do<br/>
&gt;   is cause him concern, judging by the way he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; reacted when he&#39;s seen them.<br/>
&gt;   He&#39;s an extraordinarily sensitive child and I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like to see him keep his<br/>
&gt;   &quot;magic&quot; for a few more years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I also think it&#39;s dangerous to generalize from<br/>
&gt; one&#39;s own personal<br/>
&gt;   experiences to every other person. I hear people<br/>
&gt; say &quot;We have candy out all<br/>
&gt;   the time and my kids never touch it&quot;, or &quot;we have<br/>
&gt; the TV on all the time and<br/>
&gt;   my kids rarely watch it&quot;. Well this is great, and<br/>
&gt; it may work quite well for<br/>
&gt;   those individual families. I also know families<br/>
&gt; that have candy out all the<br/>
&gt;   time and their kids are 40 pounds overweight. And<br/>
&gt; I know families<br/>
&gt;   that have the TV on all the time and the kids are<br/>
&gt; glued to it like<br/>
&gt;   little sponges for 7 hours a day. So much depends<br/>
&gt; on individual kids and the<br/>
&gt;   preferences and innate personalities they were<br/>
&gt; born with, as well as the<br/>
&gt;   family environment. All of this &quot;it&#39;s unschooling<br/>
&gt; to do this&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;   unschooling if you do that&quot;, &quot;some people CALL<br/>
&gt; themselves unschoolers but<br/>
&gt;   they&#39;re really not&quot;, etc. (not just responding to<br/>
&gt; this particular post but<br/>
&gt;   to many in the same vein) remind me of my high<br/>
&gt; school punk rock days. It was<br/>
&gt;   &quot;punk&quot; to do this, but &quot;poser&quot; to do that. I could<br/>
&gt; never keep it all<br/>
&gt;   straight and I still can&#39;t. If I wasn&#39;t &quot;punk&quot;<br/>
&gt; because I wore Birkenstocks<br/>
&gt;   with my mohawk, and I&#39;m not &quot;unschooling&quot; because<br/>
&gt; I limit TV, well so be it<br/>
&gt;   I guess :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001727468">I am not sure who it was who said something about, is it the TV that <br/>
makes a person inactive, or is it an inactive person who is more <br/>
likely to watch TV ?- or words to that effect!!<br/>
<br/>
My dd is not active.  She does not like sport, or anything very <br/>
physical, not even walking! She preferes to be doing some thing <br/>
quiet. She will sit for hours writting out songs while listening to <br/>
them on the radio.  Drawing, reading (occasionally),  writting <br/>
letters, doodling.  My grandsons on the other hand are very active, <br/>
especially the elder one - sitting watching TV would be his very last <br/>
choice!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, like your family Bobbie, my dd will do other things while the TV <br/>
is one.  Some times i dont think she has any idea what is on Tv, it <br/>
is just back ground noise.<br/>
I do often find if i start to do some thing - sewing for example, my <br/>
dd will come over and say &quot;My turn!&quot; - but she would never dream of <br/>
getting the sewing machine out!!!!<br/>
