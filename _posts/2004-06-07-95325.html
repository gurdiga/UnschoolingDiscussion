<div id="ygrps-yiv-143466240">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I posted this on another list, but want to share with you as well,<br/>
because your insight has been so helpful to me and I&#39;d like different <br/>
perspectives.<br/>
<br/>
It has been suggested to me that forcing children to clean up after <br/>
themselves is not respectful or healthy, and that having toys, etc. <br/>
picked up is a parent&#39;s issue. For some time, we have imposed clean <br/>
up time once or twice a day and required the girls (3 & 5yo now) to <br/>
put away toys in the living room and throughout the house. Of course, <br/>
they have never wanted to do so at any time, and in the past we have <br/>
used punishment as an &#39;incentive&#39; but have decided, after seriously <br/>
questioning our lifestyle that we don&#39;t want to coerce this any more <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is very small and our humble livingroom is the only place<br/>
toys can be kept. So it gets out of control to the point that I<br/>
cannot stand the clutter/lack of floor and sitting space. If left<br/>
unchecked, it spills over into the kitchen and diningroom and starts<br/>
to choke out the entire house. At times before we would help the<br/>
kids clean up, and try to make the chore a game by singing songs,<br/>
etc. Now and then we would get good results, but usually ended up<br/>
with two frustrated or angry parents who did most of the work.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, we want good relationships with dds, and are seeing<br/>
that perhaps cleaning should be up to us, as we did choose to have<br/>
children and provide them with the toys. And a tidy home (key word:<br/>
tidy, NOT perfect)is just not a priority that the kids (and not<br/>
really to dh, sigh) can understand yet. We have stopped making it a<br/>
daily requirement (and I have been trying to let the mess bother me<br/>
less) and have been saying, &quot;I would like to get these toys put away<br/>
today&quot; instead of &quot;time for you to clean up&quot;. Then one or both of us<br/>
does the job and casually asks the kids for help. When they refuse<br/>
(act deaf) we have been trying to let this go, BUT...I (more so than<br/>
dh) still feel, deep down, anger and resentment at times when I<br/>
am &#39;stuck&#39; cleaning up after them while they sit and watch or go<br/>
merrily on their way. Hmmm...is this how they felt when I made them<br/>
do it alone?<br/>
<br/>
I have been feeling selfish - it really upsets me that I do so much<br/>
for the family and no one (not even dh, really, but he tries to keep<br/>
the peace)wants to help me take care of things that are important to<br/>
me now and then. I have been controlling in the past, so perhaps that<br/>
is part of the issue right now, but as we have relaxed our parenting<br/>
over the last few months, I wonder is anyone appreciative at<br/>
all? I am almost 9 months pregnant and cannot physically keep up<br/>
with all that I usually do. I have been skimming the surface and<br/>
leaving the toys, but after several days, it needs an overhaul so we<br/>
can utilize the house comfortably! I just wanted to cry today as I<br/>
was bending over (difficult task) doing it myself again before<br/>
company came. It didn&#39;t bother anyone else but me.<br/>
<br/>
Help me see the light? Or get my head out of the sand (or at least<br/>
above water)? Or do I just need a hormone adjustment?<br/>

months pregnancy does make it more difficult to clean up.<br/>
<br/>
Can you just not have anyone over right now? Eliminate the need for a really neat home by <br/>
not entertaining.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How quickly do yu try to clean up? Can you spread it out? Turn on some music you like <br/>
and take your time? One of the problems with cleaning when you have little kids is trying <br/>
to get things &quot;back to order&quot; quickly before they are in disorder again.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can simply clear a path to walk in, or you can put up toys that have too many <br/>
little pieces. You might want to let your kids know that if you are going to keep cleaning <br/>
up, then you need to make clean up easier on you by eliminating the number of items to <br/>
clean up until your body is smaller and more agile again.<br/>

<br/>
One of the difficulties of removing coercion is that there is a lengthy backlash. Kids will be <br/>
so relieved not to &quot;have to&quot; that they don&#39;t have empathy for your feelings for a long time. <br/>
Modelling and genuine service to them comes first and takes awhile to produce <br/>
reciprocity.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra often says to change how you do things: with a smile, with music, with thoughts of <br/>
affection for the people you&#39;re serving. It really does make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
And when I get overwhelmed with too much to do, I try to remember that I don&#39;t have to <br/>
do it all right now or really fast. I can wipe up one mess in the refrigerator, not all of them. <br/>
I can clear a path in the living room. I can stack the books on the coffee table instead of <br/>
hauling them down to the basement. I can throw clean clothes in a lanudry basket and <br/>
leave them there for people to sort through when they need clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Lower the demands on yourself while you are finishing up pregnancy.<br/>

Thank you, this helps a lot, and I will try to keep it in the <br/>
forefront of my mind.<br/>

Yes, when I remember/make myself BREATHE (as Sandra has said) all <br/>
goes much better.</div>

*********************************<br/>
Another trick I do...I take a big laundry basket from room to room, and <br/>
everything that doesn&#39;t belong in that room goes into the basket.  When I&#39;ve been <br/>
through all the rooms, I tell everyone to come and get their own stuff out of <br/>
the basket and put it where it belongs.  Then I stick the basket under the <br/>
stairs with the remaining stuff and if anyone&#39;s looking for their things I say, <br/>
&quot;check under the stairs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also REALLY enjoy having a day with nothing else to do, sending the kids <br/>
someplace fun with my husband, popping in a book on tape, and going from room to <br/>
room tossing stuff and cleaning.  And it seems if you can do this once every <br/>
6 months or so, it&#39;s just easier to have some sort of order, and things just <br/>
don&#39;t get messy as often.  With 10 people in our house, this is just a <br/>
necessity.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We keep a big basket in our living room and just throw the toys from <br/>
the floor into there at the end of each day. I have one in my bedroom <br/>
too (which, for some reason, seems to accumulate the kid&#39;s stuff :). <br/>
The one in my bedroom is a large picnic hamper, with the flaps that <br/>
fold down over the basket part. It looks very cute and neat, even <br/>
jammed full of toys :-) When either basket gets too full, they just <br/>
get taken upstairs and dumped back into the kids&#39; toy bin - if the <br/>
kids feel like sorting them into various places, they can. Makes <br/>
cleanups pretty darned quick and painless.<br/>

I think when your motivation is being driven by what everyone else is <br/>
thinking instead of by the pure delight of living this way there is a tendency <br/>
towards martyrdom.  And nobody cares too much for a martyr.<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t doing this as much for you as you are for them, take another <br/>
look.<br/>
Life is challenging for you now and will probably be even more so in the <br/>
months to come.  Try to relax and do what you can when you can, but realize <br/>
everyone has limits.<br/>
Ask for help but don&#39;t necessarily expect it.  Take what you can, be grateful <br/>
and breathe....<br/>
