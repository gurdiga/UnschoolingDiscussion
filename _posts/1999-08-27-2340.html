 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to clarify that we didn&#39;t insist that he stay for one <br/>
marking period.  That happened to be how long he stayed.  He could <br/>
have come home the first day if he wanted to.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with you, Beth,  but I used to feel like your husband.  I <br/>
thought that if the kids started something - lessons, etc.  that they <br/>
needed to finish.  Finally,  I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the <br/>
process is more important than the end result.  Just because they <br/>
don&#39;t finish a project, a book, a class, etc.  doesn&#39;t mean that they <br/>
didn&#39;t learn what they needed to at that time.  Now,  if I paid for a <br/>
class and then they didn&#39;t want to go,  we would probably work out a <br/>
compromise.  I certainly don&#39;t want to throw money away.  I have <br/>
found though,  that sometimes the kids are more willing to give <br/>
something a try because they know they&#39;ll have a say in whether they <br/>
continue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535060601">to Sandra Brown in Ann Arbor: The issue of the kids deciding to attend<br/>
school eventually was one my husband and I discussed before we decided to<br/>
homeschool.  He was had many questions in that regard. Such as how would<br/>
they adjust? Would they fit in? and if they decided to go, could they change<br/>
their mind?  I found Diane in KS response interesting.  My husband felt that<br/>
if the girls decided to attend school they had to stick with it for the full<br/>
school year.  His perspective is that I start lots of things and don&#39;t<br/>
follow through and finish, he wants the girls to learn the importance of<br/>
finishing what you start.  My perspective is that I try lots of things to<br/>
see what I like and if it doesn&#39;t work for me I set it aside.  This allows<br/>
me to get to know myself and do what is true to me--something that I wasn&#39;t<br/>
allowed the opportunity for in PS.  This being &quot;forced&quot; to follow through on<br/>
things that weren&#39;t true for me caused me to continue in jobs and education<br/>
choices that were not only a waste of my time but of my resources and money<br/>
as well.  I tend to agree with Diane, let them try it for one marking period<br/>
and then if they decide to come home they must stay through the rest of the<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Sandra, I recently received a brochure for a Waldorf Homeschool<br/>
Conference in Oct.  Have you ever attended this, and if so what did you<br/>
think?  When I began homeschooling it was partly because I wanted to send<br/>
the girls to a Waldorf school but couldn&#39;t afford it and there wasn&#39;t one<br/>
close enough.  Now that we&#39;ve been doing it awhile I&#39;ve moved away from<br/>
Waldorf and toward unschooling.  It did look like they had some interesting<br/>
and informative speakers and topics scheduled.<br/>
<br/>
Becky:  I&#39;ll be sitting next to you at the neighboring bridge table being an<br/>
outspoken old lady too!  My dear Grandma is still a very outspoken old lady<br/>
at 95 and I&#39;ve been told I take after her!<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth:  I&#39;m interested in the apprenticeship question too. I&#39;m curious<br/>
to see the responses you get.<br/>
<br/>
I have other things to say and ask but my post is already too long and wordy<br/>
so I&#39;ll close for now and compose my other thoughts later.<br/>

This is something that also bothers my husband about me (and about our<br/>
son). I often start things with gusto, then move on to something else, then<br/>
return to it later...or not. He had the same fear about my involvement with<br/>
homeschooling.  My husband is very goal oriented: you must start and finish<br/>
something in a linear way, and in a timely fashion. But I think if you<br/>
don&#39;t try something in fear that you won&#39;t like it or won&#39;t complete it,<br/>
then you may miss finding a new passion or interest. <br/>

maybe you could tell him that you are going to take something that you have <br/>
to finish-- like skydiving!  This always shuts my hubby up (in a nice way!) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653771172">I&#39;m the same way, always jumping in with both feet and, when the interest wanes,<br/>
jumping out just as quickly. My dh also has a problem with it, well, actually it<br/>
is just a standing joke:) He&#39;s always asking what my new passion will be (this<br/>
month, its bellydancing;). I think he&#39;s getting used to it.<br/>

Enjoy,<br/>
