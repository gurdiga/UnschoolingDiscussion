I&#39;ve recently figured out that I have a yeast imbalance, which has led to my slowly becoming allergic to more and more items as the years pass. Part of the healing process, is NO carbs of any kind for several days. No sugar for even longer...but carbs are definitely high on the glycemic index. <br/>

How do you know if you have a yeast imbalance?  What are the symptoms<br/>
and how do they test for it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m part Greek and I grow Greek oregano in the garden (mostly to cook with).<br/>
It has strong anti- fungal properties and can really help to eat it if<br/>
fungus or yeast is bothering you.  It needs to be actual oregano though,<br/>
most of what&#39;s in the spice section at the store is really Mexican sage and<br/>
wont work.  You can also buy oregano oil in some places for a more<br/>
concentrated form.  Good luck.<br/>
