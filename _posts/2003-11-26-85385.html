<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643102652">I think most people here don&#39;t like standardized tests, but I wonder if it would be good for mamabeth to start looking for someone who uses a relatively non-threatening test like the Kaufman in case it gets to a point where &quot;they&quot; want to see &quot;test scores.&quot;  If you can find someone who does the Kaufman (or somethingsimilar) who will work with you maybe Sarah could be &quot;tested&quot; and you&#39;d have &quot;proof&quot; of her achievement.  I give the Kaufman but I live in VA.  I&#39;ve worked with non-testing families when they were caught in a bind similar to yours (DSS, court cases).  Even if we had to &quot;test&quot; several times, we managed to help the child pass (in VA, 4th stanine, 23rd percentile), which is all the DSS or court could really ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318212395">I have run Sarah through the online diagnostic at School Of Tomorrow (about the only free online test I have found) and she&#39;s testing above her current grade level according to their PACE system. I wonder if they&#39;d accept that even though it isn&#39;t &quot;official&quot; testing.<br/>
 <br/>
I run her through it every now and again to see where she might be needing me to guide her into something. Like one of their areas was properly addressing envelopes and abbreviations for Mister, Miss, etc. SO I&#39;ve had her helping me write out Christmas Cards. Easy. No Hassle. Yet &quot;academic&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547442143">**I&#39;ve worked with non-testing families when they were caught in a bind <br/>
similar to yours (DSS, court cases).  Even if we had to &quot;test&quot; several <br/>
times, we managed to help the child pass (in VA, 4th stanine, 23rd <br/>
percentile), which is all the DSS or court could really ask.**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if DSS would agree with my logic, but look at how old your <br/>
child is (in months) relative to his expected classmates.  From my point <br/>
of view, it&#39;s not at all surprising that a student (for example) born 7 <br/>
or more months after the school eligibility cutoff date would be <br/>
&quot;behind&quot; half of his classmates.  (Particularly in the earliest grades <br/>
when the relative age discrepancies are the largest.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Underperforming children&quot; are sometimes held back a grade to &quot;remediate <br/>
them&quot; because being swept along trying to keep up with new material when <br/>
they have gaps in their basic skills doesn&#39;t work very well.  This isn&#39;t <br/>
an issue in homeschooling, when there is no need to move on and <br/>
&quot;lecture&quot; on new material is old material isn&#39;t learned.  (I&#39;m not <br/>
really addressing unschooling here.)  Even though grade levels are not <br/>
truly pertinent to homeschooling, you could tell DSS or the school <br/>
district or whatever concerned &quot;authority&quot; you have to satisfy that you <br/>
are retaining your child one grade.  People who only have to submit test <br/>
scores but not tolerate snoopy visits can often &quot;solve&quot; testing <br/>
performance problems this way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grasping at fairly thin straws here, but I wanted to try to say <br/>
something constructive (however feeble).  My heart goes out to you.<br/>
<br/>
Doing some testing or other assessment and then saying &quot;Yes, there are <br/>
some deficiences and this is how we plan to address them&quot; may be what <br/>
you need get them off your back.  And (god forbid) you might consider <br/>
being &quot;willing&quot; (ouch) to take parenting classes as a way of <br/>
propitiating the &quot;powers that be&quot; so that they won&#39;t take your kids or <br/>
make them go to school.  I know it sucks, but it could be the much <br/>
lesser evil.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I have a wreath of bells on my front door because I&#39;m getting into <br/>
the Xmas spirit early.  Hanging bells or windchimes or something on the <br/>
inside of your front door might work as an alarm.</div>
