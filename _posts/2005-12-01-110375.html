 </span></blockquote>I think in the original game, you were supposed to play something that DID <br/>
fit in one of those three categories.<br/>
<br/>
When we play, one other common #1 question is &quot;Is it or was it ever alive?&quot;   <br/>
But that doesn&#39;t really apply to some things either, like a rock or a <br/>
mountain or a cloud--they&#39;ve been other forms, maybe liquid, and maybe they&#39;re <br/>
moving.   <br/>
<br/>
When people play in person you can get an indication with the &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; <br/>
that it&#39;s not a purely enthusiastic YES!   It&#39;s a hesitant &quot;I can&#39;t decide&quot; or <br/>
&quot;not really&quot; yes, and that makes a difference in the way the game is played.<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s kind of fun with a computer, it&#39;s a different game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Plastics - once animal and vegetable which died and were compressed <br/>
over millenia to mineral (does petroleum count as a mineral for the <br/>
purposes of 20 questions?) and now something other - often an <br/>
amalgam of things as in a plastic chair seat with metal legs. We <br/>
generally stretch the answers a bit not just yes and no but <br/>
perhaps &quot;it used to be&quot; as in a cotton tablecloth &#39;used to be&#39; plant <br/>
or &#39;is made from&#39; plant. Typically, right after &quot;is it alive?&quot; <br/>
and &quot;was it ever alive?&quot; we move on to &quot;is it made by people?&quot; <br/>
and &quot;is it made of....(wood, metal, plastic, fabric, etc)?&quot; Some of <br/>
the hardest ones have been the really simple everyday things.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is (or was) a 20 questions type board game. One team <br/>
would read clues, one at a time. The quicker you got the answer the <br/>
more points you got - if it took 5 clues, 20-5=15 points; If it took <br/>
18 clues 20-18=2 points; and so on. I think the categories were <br/>
person, place, thing rather than animal, vegetable, mineral.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The handheld game can be answered yes, no, or unknown.<br/>
<br/>
The player needs to be consistent in their thinking about the object for it to work.  For instance, I had &quot;rock&quot; and was thinking specifically of a rock that could be held in my hand.  It asked, &quot;Can you walk on it&quot;.  I said no, because although rock can be used for paths, etc., and you could step on the rock I was thinking of, my specific object was not something that would be commonly walked on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll try it again with the same object and say that it can be walked on.  See what happens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943464789">My kids have come up with plenty in that category. They love that game. They<br/>
actually think it&#39;s kind of spooky how it guesses everything. Sometimes it<br/>
misses but I think that depends on how my kids answer the questions. They<br/>
punched in a mermaid once and that would be other. It guessed it. Or a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585428774">There is one called 20 questions for kids.  We&#39;ve played it a local restaurant that has a bunch of games.  We don&#39;t bother with the board - just take turns asking each other the questions.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday at Target I picked up several decks of trivia question cards, in the dollar section at the front of the store.  There are separate decks for movies, sports, etc.  They were only a dollar a set.  They look like they could be a cheap thrill for car rides.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, the intangibles.<br/>
In college I hung out with a small group of friends and after we mastered <br/>
Chinese Checkers (meaning the more mathematical had it down to where the game was <br/>
always an exact draw) we moved to 20 questions, but we didn&#39;t limit to 20.   <br/>
One game went a day and a half, every mealtime, and we were getting grumpy, <br/>
but then it happened that we were at Frontier Restaurant which has big windows <br/>
and I asked &quot;Can we see it from here?&quot; and the answer was YES.   That was the <br/>
breakthrough we had needed.   <br/>
<br/>
It was &quot;a mountain.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Up to that point we had gathered that people could get inside it (mines and <br/>
caves), it had moving parts (water, trees in the wind), but it wasn&#39;t moveable, <br/>
it was and was not alive...<br/>
<br/>
Another really hard one was &quot;a dream.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
So after those two we started asking whether it was tangible, if we thought <br/>
it might be getting toward the kinds of things Pam named above.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Twenty questions is related to how many times you can fold a single piece of <br/>
paper in half and then half again, etc.   and also related to guessing a <br/>
number between 1 and 1000.<br/>
<br/>
If the person giving the answers on the 1 to 1000 always divides in half, you <br/>
can&#39;t miss.   It&#39;s possible to ask bad questions and never get it, but if the <br/>
questioner attempts to divide the universe in half each time, you get to the <br/>
answer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339891034">We love this game! Mostly we&#39;ve played it on the computer, but as <br/>
Sandra said, it&#39;s a whole different game in real life, and more fun. <br/>
For example, there&#39;s a pretty obvious difference between my daughter <br/>
looking really confused upon my asking a questions and saying <br/>
something hesistantly versus shouting YES! in a fit of giggles. <br/>
Those body language signs give you extra clues.<br/>
<br/>
After dd and I realized how *good* the computer was at guessing <br/>
answers (and boy, is it good), we took to trying to come up with <br/>
words that would stump the game. It&#39;s also just interesting to see <br/>
how our children answer the questions. At one point she said &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
going to try &#39;my mind&#39;!&quot; Some of her answers were fairly non-<br/>
standard. :)<br/>
<br/>
Is it colorful? Yes. Can you find it in a church? Rarely (lol). Is <br/>
it annoying? Sometimes. Does it come from something larger? Yes <br/>
(cool, I wonder what). Does it grow over time? Depends. Is it <br/>
fluffy? Rarely. Is it very large? Yes. Is it worth a lot of money? <br/>
Maybe (LOL!).<br/>
<br/>
The game came up with &quot;You are thinking of a Casino!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I didn&#39;t know 20 Questions came as a hand-held game - <br/>
that&#39;s so cool! We might have to add it to our Christmas list...</div>
