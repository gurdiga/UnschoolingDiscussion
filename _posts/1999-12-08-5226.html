<div id="ygrps-yiv-306201500">Hi Carol!  Nice to see you on this list too - I enjoy your Florida-homeschool<br/>
(also on onelist.com).<br/>
<br/>
We are in Orlando, and have an almost 10yo girl and 6yo boy.  We love Florida<br/>
for unschooling, as we can take advantage of all those wonderful field trips!<br/>
Our favorites do include Disney - we love to go and look for Hidden Mickeys -<br/>
but also some of the &quot;off the beaten path&quot; activities - Orlando Science Center<br/>
and Green Meadows Petting Farm. <br/>
<br/>
We can also take the time to enjoy things that many tourists just don&#39;t have<br/>
the time to do.  A couple weeks ago, we went to the Millennium Village (a new<br/>
pavilion in Epcot).  I let the kids do what they wanted, and there are lots of<br/>
activities there, so we spent a couple hours.  Time after time, as I sat back<br/>
and let my kids play, I would see kids come up to an activity, barely spend<br/>
30 seconds at it, and the parents grab their hands and say &quot;come on, we&#39;ve<br/>
got lots to do...&quot; and the kids never did really experience the activity!<br/>
<br/>
This is such a great time of year too - Epcot&#39;s Candlelight Processional, ice<br/>
skating at Downtown Disney, &quot;snow&quot; nightly in Celebration - lots of fun, and<br/>
the crowds won&#39;t be here until Christmas!<br/>

Hi Jennifer,<br/>
We are waaaay up near AL, in Pensacola.  We do plan to visit Orlando <br/>
eventually...possibly this winter.<br/>
Sounds like all the unschoolers are in the Peninsula!! Actually, we have a <br/>
nice little group up here now.<br/>

There is an e-mail list specifically for FL unschoolers. There are <br/>
quite a few of us and we&#39;re trying to stay in touch so that get <br/>
togethers will be more likely.<br/>
I could e-mail you the link if you (or anyone else here) are <br/>
interested.<br/>
