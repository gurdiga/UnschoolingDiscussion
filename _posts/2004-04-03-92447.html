&quot;Shelly is half-black and she looks it.  She is gorgeous and I think when <br/>
parents act like their kids shouldn&#39;t notice, it sends a message to their <br/>
kids and to Shelly that something is wrong with her<br/>
being in our family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of when I was in college at The Evergreen State College <br/>
(btw, it is a great liberal arts school with no grades.  Today I realize it <br/>
is pretty much an unschooling college.  It has programs where you can <br/>
develop independent contracts to set up your own project and grade yourself <br/>
- I set up an independent contract to go to Thailand for six months to study <br/>
Thai language, teach ESL, and study women&#39;s roles in Buddhism)...oops, went <br/>
off on a tangent there...anyway, there was a girl who wrote into the school <br/>
newspaper.  What I remember is that she explained how people would try to <br/>
describe her out of a crowd of white people.  They would say the &quot;girl with <br/>
the long black hair,&quot; or anything else that wouldn&#39;t actually point out her <br/>
heritage.  She was Asian (I can&#39;t remember from where exactly), but she <br/>
couldn&#39;t understand why people wouldn&#39;t just describe her as being Asian.  <br/>
She explained that she was proud of her heritage and knew that people were <br/>
trying to be PC by not singling her out, but she also knew that it was <br/>
rather false as it would be the most obvious to describe her as being Asian.<br/>
<br/>
I have also traveled a lot, to places like Jamaica and Thailand where I <br/>
stuck out like a sore thumb.  All the people there always called me the <br/>
&quot;white girl&quot; or &quot;falang&quot; (which means fat, white guava in Thai - that is <br/>
what they call all white people - heh).  There wasn&#39;t this hush-hush about <br/>
the fact that I was different.  In a way I felt like they were saying, &quot;we <br/>
know you are different, but that&#39;s okay.&quot;  It just felt more straightforward <br/>
and real.  Obviously we have different race issues here, but it&#39;s just <br/>
something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure if that was about unschooling, but the college part is!  <br/>
If any of you are looking for a great college for your kids, I would check <br/>
it out.  Located in Olympia, Washington.  :)<br/>

Sometimes the tangents are even more interesting than the linear parts <br/>
of the posts.  Yours was especially cool.  Taking juicy bites out of <br/>
life is what unschooling is all about, no?<br/>
