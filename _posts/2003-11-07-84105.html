<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050314386">There is nothing wrong in choosing a career or a lifestyle and enjoying what <br/>
you&#39;ve chosen, traditional role or untraditional. I want my daughters to see <br/>
that being a wife, mother, teacher, secretary etc. is something that they can <br/>
certainly do and be content and happy at doing/being rather than following <br/>
along with a hurtful &quot;You don&#39;t HAVE to be a nurse, wife, mother, etc.&quot; (which <br/>
rather denigrates their choice to be a nurse, wife, teacher, etc.) and thus <br/>
becoming something they don&#39;t truly enjoy because women &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; choose <br/>
traditional roles any longer.<br/>

Thank you for saying this, Elizabeth, because I was feeling the same way but <br/>
didn&#39;t quite know how to express it.  I had a few things I wanted to be <br/>
growing up because of books I had read that made those careers sound glamorous, but <br/>
in my heart all I&#39;ve really ever wanted to be was a mother and a wife.  That <br/>
is frowned upon in today&#39;s society, and guess what?  I DON&#39;T CARE.  If I did, I <br/>
certainly wouldn&#39;t have homeschooled, and CERTAINLY wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.  <br/>
I tried to go back to college and finish my degree in early childhood <br/>
education, but even in college, learning just doesn&#39;t take it to the level I&#39;m <br/>
interested in.  With unschooling my son, we&#39;ve been able to take things to the <br/>
deepest level he wants to and in untraditional ways, so that he actually remembers <br/>
what he is learning.  Quite often I find myself going even deeper on my own <br/>
because I can-I don&#39;t have to rush off to the next area to &quot;keep up with my <br/>
class&quot;.  What is important to me is to let my children know they have <br/>
choices-choices to be anything that makes them happy-whether traditional or <br/>
nontraditional.  If we were to follow it with &quot;you don&#39;t HAVE to be a nurse, secretary,&quot; <br/>
etc, then we are imposing and impression that is not fair and balanced and <br/>
counteracts all we&#39;ve worked hard to accomplish in deschooling/unschooling.  <br/>
