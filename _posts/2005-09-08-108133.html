<div id="ygrps-yiv-62482324">**The book is probably great for some people, but if it justifies several <br/>
<br/>
instances of pressing lessons on kids, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an ideal <br/>
recommendation.**<br/>
<br/>
Nah, it doesn&#39;t justify them at all. She says something like - I screwed up <br/>
and here&#39;s how and why and what I thought we would gain from it, and you know <br/>
what, I was wrong and I wish I hadn&#39;t done it.<br/>
<br/>
I think once people have read it they&#39;ll have a harder time trying to tell <br/>
themselves &quot;it&#39;s okay if I make him do this just once&quot; because she&#39;s so eloquent <br/>
about the consequences in her family of that sort of thinking.<br/>

If they had just read the first review, I was thinking they might think   <br/>
&quot;Well here&#39;s someone who went back and forth several times, and her kids ended up <br/>
fine and she wrote a book, so no rush for me to understand unschooling.&quot;<br/>
