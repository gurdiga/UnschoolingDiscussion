<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001929414">Last night was an unbelievable night. My 10yo daughter Megan accidentally put <br/>
her hand on a stove burner that had been cooling down after being very hot <br/>
for a period of time. Dh thought she was fine, and just wanted her to go to <br/>
bed. We tried that. She said her fingers were hurting worse and turning <br/>
white. <br/>
<br/>
We ended up in the ER all night treating second-degree burns on her left <br/>
hand, three of her fingertips. She is glad it is her left and not her right, <br/>
she is right handed. But she will have to stop teaching herself chords on the <br/>
guitar for a while I think. Dh was tired and he knew we would be in for a <br/>
late night, and he&#39;d rather I not make such a fuss. I don&#39;t think he believed <br/>
it was as bad as it was. But after the conversation we had I am about to talk <br/>
about, he wouldn&#39;t fight me. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my 3yo Ashlyn was visibly upset by my older daughter&#39;s pain, before <br/>
we tried going to bed. I don&#39;t think my dh caught on. She was then playing in <br/>
the sandbox on our back screenporch (it was late, she was tired and upset) <br/>
and she bit her little 1yo brother. Her daddy immediately grabbed her and <br/>
spanked her butt and sent her to the corner. <br/>
<br/>
I then said that is it. No more. From either of us. He was defensive at <br/>
first, but I had to talk him through it. I reminded him of a conversation a <br/>
few weeks ago he had with Megan, saying that he hates to spank her and <br/>
sometimes she just needs her reset button hit. I reminded him that he said <br/>
that &quot;Mommy doesn&#39;t like spanking, she read all these books when you were a <br/>
baby, about time out and other things instead. So it takes a lot for her to <br/>
let me spank you.&quot;  I reminded him of the conversation last week where I said <br/>
Ashlyn is already lying, in fear of getting spanked or punished. I think just <br/>
knowing Megan gets spanked causes her to be afraid. <br/>
<br/>
I told him that we spanked because we simply didn&#39;t know what else to do. <br/>
That we have been wrong about a lot of things, like school and obedience and <br/>
punishment, and that it won&#39;t continue. <br/>
<br/>
I told him that he didn&#39;t know the 3yo&#39;s personality as well as I did, and <br/>
that upset him. I had to rephrase it to I know her temperament differently <br/>
than you do. And I never wanted the day to come that she would get spanked, <br/>
just like with Megan.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t in the car the day before when this child, my 3yo cried for 45 <br/>
minutes that she didn&#39;t like my sister (her favorite aunt) anymore because <br/>
she didn&#39;t like a toy she gave her. Instead of berating her for being a <br/>
selfish brat, I let her go on and on until I understood what she was saying. <br/>
She meant she thought she liked her, but she must not since she treated her <br/>
badly, and she was upset that she acted that way. She felt bad for acting <br/>
like she didn&#39;t like her, that&#39;s why she cried that she didn&#39;t like her for <br/>
45 minutes. <br/>
<br/>
 I spanked Ashlyn once a few weeks ago and immediately hugged her and <br/>
apologized. I knew it was wrong. I knew that allowing spanking with Megan to <br/>
continue was wrong. I hated it. He thought it was necessary. I made him take <br/>
her out of sight of the other kids, it wasn&#39;t fair to upset them. <br/>
<br/>
Why I let it continue as long as I did, I&#39;ll always regret. Just like I&#39;ll <br/>
regret forcing her to go to school as long as I did. I still lose my temper <br/>
and yell and scold, but it gets better every day. I am not the tyrant I used <br/>
to be. I knew being yelled at and verbally berated was wrong and hurtful, <br/>
that&#39;s how I grew up. But it seemed to be the programmed response in me. <br/>
<br/>
It has taken a lot to change those reflexive behaviors, and a lot to admit <br/>
some of it on an email list. But if it can help break the cycle for someone <br/>
else or show how much a simple homeschooling method can change lives, I have <br/>
nothing to hide. <br/>
<br/>
The fact that my daughter somehow still trusts me, knows that I love her, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to escape me and go to school is more than I can wrap my mind <br/>
around. Our family is growing stronger every day, sometimes by trial, but we <br/>
help each other get through it. Wow. <br/>
