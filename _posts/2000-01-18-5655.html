the rain and clouds cleared out and I snapped away and took tons of<br/>
pictures for the kidlets.  Well, not as many as they wanted, like I&#39;m a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, we did go to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.  They had a<br/>
great program explaining with models and slides what the total lunar eclipse<br/>
was, what to expect, how often it happens, etc.  That was about a half hour<br/>
long.  Then it was time to go to the telescopes.  Unfortunately, this was the<br/>
first time all week we hadn&#39;t thrown the winter coats into the back of the<br/>
van, and we hadn&#39;t been back to the condo since we left earlier that day<br/>
on field trips, so we didn&#39;t have them with us.  And, yes, the telescopes<br/>
were all outside.  There were two huge ones - we saw Saturn through the first<br/>
one.  The kids said it looked fake, and it did! It was very white and solid,<br/>
and the rings were very clear.  It looked like a sticker, but of course<br/>
it wasn&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
Then we saw the moon through a couple other telescopes... but we Floridians<br/>
were standing out there with the temps in the 40s, with only light sweaters<br/>
on, and our teeth were chattering.  We asked if the view from there would be<br/>
much different from what we could see elsewhere, and they said other than the<br/>
fact that you could the telescopes to see it closely, it might actually be<br/>
better viewed out of town, where the lights from the town below weren&#39;t a<br/>
distraction.<br/>
<br/>
So we went back to our condo, went to the second floor, and sat on the bed<br/>
looking out the window. We saw it all - but it wasn&#39;t very spectacular! We<br/>
saw the shadow of the Earth on the moon get bigger and bigger, eventually<br/>
covering the moon... but it never really turned color.  It was definitely<br/>
not &quot;blood red&quot; from here!  We used the binoculars, watched for a while,<br/>
took a few pictures, then gave up.  We did look outside a while later and saw<br/>
the shadow leaving the Moon... <br/>
<br/>
So, the experience was definitely interesting - I&#39;m glad we went to the <br/>
program at the Observatory to learn more about the eclipse... but it&#39;s like<br/>
the &quot;incredibly bright full moon&quot; we were to have on 12/21/99 - good, but<br/>
didn&#39;t live up to expectations!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190591219">I was the only one here (NC) that stayed up.  I did wake up my husband to see,<br/>
but my 7 yr old after giving me instructions to wake him up to see the red moon,<br/>
wouldn&#39;t budge when I woke him up.  Yep, it did seem reddish, orange, and brown.<br/>
I though it was really neat.  We had perfect clear weather.  So in between<br/>
staining a coffee table, I ran out to see the moon.  What fun!<br/>
