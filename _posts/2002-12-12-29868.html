****<br/>
Two homeschooled brothers (both Oregon state chess <br/>
champions) <br/>
created this award-winning ThinkQuest Jr. site in 1999.  If <br/>
you <br/>
are a beginner, start with their How to Play section, and <br/>
then <br/>
proceed to Basic Strategies. If you are already playing <br/>
chess, <br/>
take a look at Advanced Tactics, Opening Book, and the <br/>
twelve <br/>
Chess Puzzles.  If you are considering entering a <br/>
tournament, <br/>
and are wondering just what to expect, be sure to read  <br/>
Tournament Play for an explanation of chess etiquette and <br/>
the <br/>
difference between Quads and Swiss tournaments.<br/>
