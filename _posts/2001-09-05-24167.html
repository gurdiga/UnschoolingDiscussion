<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089834276">&lt;&lt;I get addicted to video games. Especially the puzzle<br/>
kind. I&#39;ll play them for hours at a time, resenting<br/>
the time I have to stop and go cook dinner or<br/>
something. But when I figure out the whole puzzle or<br/>
know that I have gone as far as I can with my<br/>
capabilities I stop. Maybe that&#39;s what happened with<br/>
your son. He learned all he wanted from it and set it<br/>
aside. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
HA!  I too love, oh my gosh- MYST I played that straight through with out even eating- 10 hrs., then ran out and bought the sequel, certain puzzle games.  Also, my son got pokemon game boy game and a game boy one year for x-mas (we had no idea what it was- our tv doesnt work) and he couldnt read it so I read it for him- oh lordy!  We both stayed up some really late nights (once 3 am!) figuring out all the puzzles of it- I was amazed!  such a NEW thing (for me), interactive games!  SO, when ever anyone says they hate that gross pokemon- I ask if they ever played it- and they havent! <br/>
<br/>
Oh- and it is super boring for me (and my son) after I figured it out.  You know what is fabulous, that ZELDA game boy game- loved it!  <br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

Hi, this is Rebecca&#39;s son, Chauncey. Age of Empires 2 (AOE2) is a game where <br/>
you take the roll of people such as, Joan of Arc, Genghis Kahn, and so on. On <br/>
a more detailed basis, in the first mission of the Joan of Arc campaign you <br/>
would have to escort Joan of Arc to the castle of the king of France. In the <br/>
first mission of the Genghis Kahn campaign, Genghis Kahn gives orders for you <br/>
to take 6 horsemen and persuade the 6 tribes to unite into one tribe and <br/>
become friends. The game has a lot of history in it, and I for one would <br/>
ignore the fact that the game is rated teen. You can also create your own <br/>
campaigns and single levels to play. They even have a history book that you <br/>
can read in the game. You can play this game on the MSN Gaming Zone with <br/>
other people on the Internet. You can also play your custom made maps with <br/>
them. I could go on all day talking about this but I don&#39;t want to bore <br/>
anyone. Plus I have been neglecting my Sega Dreamcast. If you need anymore <br/>
info I am happy to help.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243237177">It is a computer game distributed by Microsoft.  All the kidlets and their<br/>
friends  play it from age 9 up.  There are several games in the series.  If<br/>
you get the expansion game for Age of Empires you go from Stone Age to Tool<br/>
Age to Bronze Age to Iron Age and then you choose a civilization such as<br/>
Ancient, Assyrian, Babylonian, Carthaginian, Egyptian, Greek, Hittite,<br/>
Macedonian, Minoan, Palmyran, Persian, Phoenician, Roman, Shang, Sumarian or<br/>
Yamato.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose when you want to live in each civilization and so forth and<br/>
so on.<br/>

of the coasters and two of us (including me) were sitting on a bench<br/>
watching, the car stopped at the top of the lift hill.  I turned to<br/>
Rachel (my daughter) and said, &quot;Well now some guy in a blue uniform will<br/>
come and kick the tracks!&quot;  She got this funny look on her face and<br/>
pointed behind me.  I turned and saw . . . .<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yes, but I sort of figured that dead guests brought it down even<br/>
further.. maybe I&#39;m wrong and she&#39;s actually come up with a unique way to<br/>
increase her park rating. ;-) She also intentionally designs roller<br/>
coasters that  crash and kill people, an does something with towers,<br/>
throws them off, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
She really is a sensitive, gentle kid in real life, honest...<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s interesting, though, how differently we play thse games.<br/>
After my 17+ years of school, I have apparently become so goal-driven<br/>
that just *playing* never occured to me. I try to get the best rating,<br/>
the most money, the biggest house, all that. I&#39;m much less driven in real<br/>
life, honestly... but Cacie usually just plays, she tries out different<br/>
things and doesn&#39;t mind if they increase or decrease her rating, as long<br/>
as she has fun doing them. She spends money on Sim hot tubs and pizza,<br/>
and quits Sim jobs regularly,  while I&#39;m saving up for a bigger house and<br/>
trying to make more money, get more stuff, do what the game wants me to<br/>
do... it&#39;s just different.<br/>
<br/>
THe only exception is Logical Journey of the Zoombinis, which she seems<br/>
to play heavily for a week or so every 6 months. She approaches this game<br/>
like I would approach  geometry proofs (which I loved), and really<br/>
working at figuring out each puzzle. Maybe because it&#39;s less open-ended,<br/>
I don&#39;t know, but she has over 300 Zoombinis in Zoombiniville already and<br/>
I think she&#39;ll eventually save them all...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t played Zoombinis in ages but I had most of them saved.  I play<br/>
RTC for fun sometimes but I like to beat the parks.  We finished the<br/>
initial set and have both add-on - corkscrew follies and loopy<br/>
landscapes.  I think I am about halfway through the parks in loopy now.<br/>
My son on the other hand - he crashes coasters, and drowns people too. <br/>
Here&#39;s a cool trick - slope a land square and bring the water level up so<br/>
it is half covered - you can then drown your guests in the grass!<br/>
