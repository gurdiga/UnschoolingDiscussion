<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069584002">HI,<br/>
  This is from a friend of mine not on this list, but she didn&#39;t care if I<br/>
shared it, and I enjoyed reading it.<br/>
Wendy<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s what I realized about the homeschooling that&#39;s been going on around<br/>
&gt; here.  I allow myself to get negative and down on myself sometimes for not<br/>
&gt; doing enough, but then certain things happen, certain conversations, that<br/>
&gt; remind me that things do work out, and for the better usually.  I realize<br/>
&gt; more and more that we are definitely unschoolers.  Sure, we do some of the<br/>
&gt; curriculum stuff sometimes, mostly with reading because I realize Oliver<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ready to read and needs some pushing/guiding.  But it&#39;s unbelievable what<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First of all there&#39;s the socialization he&#39;s getting from being around good<br/>
&gt; friends, new &quot;friends&quot; that aren&#39;t quite friends yet, and adults I meet<br/>
&gt; with.  It&#39;s so important that children be around people of all ages and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just 25 kids of the same age for 6-8 hours a day.  But here&#39;s what he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; getting from his passion, baseball.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The most obvious is the math skills.  I&#39;ve told some people about how he<br/>
&gt; organizes his baseball cards in his notebook - by batting average.  He<br/>
&gt; starts his notebook with the highest average and works his way down.<br/>
&gt; Whenever he gets a new card, he takes as much time as he needs to get it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the right place.  His attention span is huge during &quot;baseball card<br/>
&gt; organization&quot; time.  I knew he was (further) developing his incredible<br/>
 </span></blockquote>math<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; skills already.  Lately more things have come to me.  He&#39;s learning how to<br/>
&gt; write.  This is something he hasn&#39;t wanted to do until fairly recently and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never pushed him in this area.  (Mostly due to my belief in children<br/>
&gt; not being ready to write until they&#39;re ready to write.)  He copies stats<br/>
 </span></blockquote>off<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the internet, he finds world records from his baseball cards and copies<br/>
&gt; them, and the other day he started a channel list (we have a satellite<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dish<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and have a zillion channels and it gets difficult to find the channel with<br/>
&gt; the Braves game on sometimes.)  The channel list has channels we go to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>more<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; frequently but forget later - name of channel and number is what he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>writes.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He&#39;s learning to read - names of teams, players, words pertaining to<br/>
&gt; baseball.  He&#39;s learning geography by having a huge interest in where the<br/>
&gt; Braves are playing each night.  He&#39;s learning how to look at weather maps.<br/>
&gt; He tunes in to the weather channel and looks to see if it is raining in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; city where the Braves are playing.  Just yesterday I realized something<br/>
 </span></blockquote>else<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he has learned - the days of the week in the correct order.  Previously<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; had a mental block about the days of the week.  All of a sudden,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yesterday,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he said, &quot;Sunday, Monday, Tuesday...&quot; and went on to name them all.  When<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; asked him when he learned that he said, &quot;The Braves aren&#39;t playing today,<br/>
&gt; Tuesday, and I heard the announcer yesterday say that they were playing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; next day on Wednesday.  So now I just know all of them.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So there you go.  I average about one hour per week of formal teaching.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is so bright, he is learning so much, he has such love of learning.  He<br/>
&gt; would be &quot;learning&quot; to read and write and do math problems and read maps<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; school, but would he love it so much?  Would he have time and energy at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; end of the day to pursue his basebal interest?  No he would not.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; completely satisfied with our homeschooling life, at least for this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>moment.<br/>
