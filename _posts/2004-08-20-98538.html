negative and positive aspects of a new baby coming, and got a lot of you who <br/>

comes up in our day to day lives? It seemed to be fine. He never really asked <br/>

really thought it could do no harm and I agreed to let him watch it. Ever since he <br/>
started watching it, he now has little episodes where he&#39;s afraid of the dark <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930375288">My kids (almost 8 and 9.5) are still often blown away when they see family<br/>
members on TV being really mean to each other.  It gives us the opportunity<br/>
to talk about how we treat each other.  Which type of family would you<br/>
rather live in, one where you talk about differences and work things out, or<br/>
one where they scream at each other and treat each other hatefully?  <br/>
 <br/>
When my kids were toddlers I felt similar to you in that I didn&#39;t want them<br/>
exposed to nasty behavior before they&#39;d have thought of it themselves.  I<br/>
was concerned that they would imitate the mean behavior they saw on TV.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t go to all the trouble that you do to keep it from them, though, and<br/>
gradually, as they saw more of that type of show, I realized that my fears<br/>
were unfounded because they didn&#39;t automatically start acting like the kids<br/>
on TV.  That sounds like a lot of work to tape everything before you watch<br/>
it.  What happens when you want to watch something *now* instead of after<br/>
it&#39;s taped?  <br/>
 <br/>
With regards to being afraid of the dark, perhaps he was just trying out<br/>
what he saw on TV to see how you would react.  My kids have never been<br/>
afraid of the dark or had nightmares despite the fact that they&#39;ve watched<br/>
some pretty scary stuff.  They like me to lie down with them while they go<br/>
to sleep and I still do.  I enjoy the snuggle time and the talking that<br/>
happens at the end of the day.  They don&#39;t lie there with their imaginations<br/>
running wild with no one to talk to.  &lt;reminds me of a Junie B. Jones book<br/>
we just read where her parents make her go to bed alone and scared even<br/>
though she is afraid of the monster under her bed.  The kids wanted to know<br/>
why she just couldn&#39;t sleep with her parents.  It seemed so mean.&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s always a good idea to be there with your son when he watches a show so<br/>
you can answer any questions he might have or talk about what you see.<br/>

<br/>
My kids are good at seeing things and thinking (or saying) &quot;that&#39;s not very <br/>
nice,&quot; or &quot;why are they doing that?&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s not the way I want to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t emulate bad parts of things unless they were already feeling some <br/>
frustration.   They need bad examples too.   Fairy tales wouldn&#39;t work if none <br/>
of the characters were underhanded liars.  But I&#39;ve never known any child to <br/>
hear fairy stories and say &quot;I really want to grow up to be the wolf,&quot; or <br/>
whatever.   <br/>
<br/>
(I do expect that someone will be willing to make up a story now just to <br/>
dispute that, which is unfortunate but has happened before.  But it seems the <br/>
little team who came here to kick my butt have gone on now for a while anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not afraid of mild bad examples.  I have kept some things out of their <br/>
field of vision in subtle fashion.   I don&#39;t link or strew EVERYthing.   They&#39;ve <br/>
always really liked LaVar Burton, but I didn&#39;t bring Roots home and say, <br/>
&quot;Look, this is the role that made him famous.&quot;   Marty watched Glory recently, but <br/>
at 15 he&#39;s old enough to know the time period and the context.    Very young <br/>
kids who have no internal framework don&#39;t know when the civil war was, and <br/>
that makes a difference.<br/>
<br/>
I warned Holly away from The Patriot.  She&#39;ll see it someday, and if she <br/>
really wants to see it now/soon that&#39;s okay, but I would prefer to be there and <br/>
distract her a bit with talk about camera angles and special effects rather than <br/>
leave her to, perhaps, experience the parts involving children as a real-time <br/>
news report rather than the piece of storytelling art it is.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I <br/>
thought of going with &quot;Maybe bunny families treat each other like this, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think this would be a good way to deal with it in our family&quot; or some <br/>
such thing, but it just doesn&#39;t feel right... and once that seed is pla<br/>
nted... <br/>
Anyone have any ideas for us? Thanks!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Whether it&#39;s good or not, jealousy about second children is inevitable.  If <br/>
you set it up so that he thinks he&#39;s wrong or bad, it adds insult to injury.   <br/>
I remember when my sister was born.  I was 3 and four months.   My only-child <br/>
life was over forever, and she was sickly, and my mom blamed me for things I <br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly have done or thought.  I started being wrong about everything.<br/>
<br/>
Try to avoid that, if you can.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was born, Kirby was two and a half.  I tried to talk to Kirby as <br/>
much as possible through those early days, to include him with me in lots of <br/>
actions and observations, so that he felt a part of the &quot;we&quot; that was me and <br/>
Keith and him, the ones who were there already, observing Marty as the new <br/>
member.   It seemed better than having the parents on one &quot;team&quot; and the kids on <br/>
another, where the oldest is comparing what he has to what the other has all the <br/>
time.<br/>

<br/>
My kids never slept alone until they were old enough to request it, and <br/>
Holly&#39;s not afraid of the dark, but Marty has been sometimes.  (Not anymore.)  <br/>
Kirby likes to go to sleep with a TV or music on, and I don&#39;t mind unless he leave <br/>
it on too long and too loud.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Marty goes to bed with the TV on and a timer to turn it off, but <br/>
usually he stays up until he&#39;s moments from being asleep and then just times it <br/>
so he&#39;s in the bed when he falls asleep. &lt;g&gt;  That&#39;s how I do it, so I totally <br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby watched a scary movie visiting other teens the other day, and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t usually.   He jumped out of his chair and yelped at a scary part, and they <br/>
commented on it, and he wasn&#39;t embarrassed at all, he said, but just told them <br/>
he doesn&#39;t like scary movies and usually avoids them entirely.<br/>
<br/>
His dad does too, so I understand!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wished I&#39;d seen it.<br/>
 <br/>
I asked my mother one day-----and I remmeber this vividly---- whether  <br/>
dorwning meant that you went down the drain.<br/>
 <br/>
She was (and I knew it at the time) distracted and just said, &quot;Uh  huh.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It was a long time before I really knew what drowning was and that it  didn&#39;t <br/>
mean to go down the drain. I also avoided sink drains, pool  <br/>
drains----everything. I would let the plug out of the tub only after I was OUT  of the tub. <br/>
And I&#39;d freak if a friend would let the water out too soon.  It  took a long <br/>
time for me (teens?) to be able to be in a tub with just a little  water while it <br/>
drained. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The GOOD part about this is that it made me make a concerted effort to  never <br/>
be so distracted that I can&#39;t really *be there* for my kids when they ask  <br/>
something. I *make* myself stop and think about the question and have never uh  <br/>
huhed them----just in case. They also KNOW what drowning means. <br/>
 <br/>
I was also surprised to know that other children thought this. I thought  *I* <br/>
was the only one! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, *I* haven&#39;t had the need/want to watch anything *now*, but <br/>
sometimes Wyl does. If that comes up, its most often a show that I&#39;ve seen enought <br/>
time to know what to expect or am familiar with the show, and if it hasn&#39;t had <br/>
anything or much of anything &quot;mean&quot; on it, I might let him watch by himself, <br/>
but we most often watch together. We do often (now) discuss things that might <br/>
come up on a show, such as hitting or meanness, but it rarely comes up, now. <br/>
I&#39;m kind of looking to the future more when his interests expand and as my <br/>
parents are buying more &quot;non name brand&quot; videos that have some scary ideas in them <br/>
(such as a group of 5 very young bunnies running off into the forest to find <br/>
their baby brother who was kidnapped by foxes without telling police or <br/>
parents, etc.). Oddly enough, I find the &quot;adult&quot; stuff with much less controversial <br/>
subjects than the kiddie stuff! LOL He loves Guys and Dolls and other <br/>
musical/stage stuff, and we really don&#39;t try to &quot;ban&quot; anything, but he has a very low <br/>
scare factor, so he can&#39;t sit through much of anything (Nemo-the sharks scare <br/>
him, Shrek 2, the Fiona kissing Prince Charming scared/upset him, etc.)., but <br/>
we let him try and either turn it off or fast forward through the scary parts.<br/>
<br/>
With regards to being afraid of the dark, perhaps he was just trying out<br/>
what he saw on TV to see how you would react.<br/>
That&#39;s a possibility. I hadn&#39;t thought of that... though it has been going on <br/>
for several years, now, so I&#39;m *thinking* that probably isn&#39;t it... but I&#39;ll <br/>
be more observant on that front to see. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
They like me to lie down with them while they go<br/>
to sleep and I still do. I enjoy the snuggle time and the talking that<br/>
happens at the end of the day.<br/>
We do that too, but not until he falls asleep. He shoos us out when he gets  <br/>
tired-apparently people laying down with him keeps him from the actual sleep.<br/>
<br/>
They like me to lie down with them while they go<br/>

If one of us (usually me) isn&#39;t right there watching something with him, I&#39;m <br/>
always in the next room. But he usually only watches re-runs by himself or <br/>
movies that he&#39;s seen lots and lots of times.<br/>
<br/>
He does do a lot of imitating what he sees, and before I was on this board <br/>
and learned more about relaxing and seeing things from different perspectives, <br/>
it bothered me some. But, now I see how the swordplay, video games, and other <br/>
ideas don&#39;t quash his imagination-they stimulate it quite a lot! He makes up <br/>
his own &quot;video games&quot; with wooden blocks and action figures on his floor, makes <br/>
up wonderful stories with the characters from games and stuff he&#39;s watched, <br/>
draws intricate pictures and puts them with stories from the same sources. Maybe <br/>
that&#39;s part of what makes me uneasy about the hatefullness and meanness on <br/>
things he might watch-since it really works into his play and stimulates him to <br/>
copy and emulate the behaviors...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for giving me a lot to think about!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

don&#39;t *seem* that way-but I also don&#39;t see them at home in a relaxed, un-public <br/>
atmosphere.<br/>
I think a lot of my little brother being born trauma is part of my worry, <br/>
here, too. I was also 3 (and 3 weeks), and my brother was born with Spina <br/>
Biffida, which most people hadn&#39;t heard of to that point (late 60s), and up until the <br/>
mid 60&#39;s, was pretty much fatal. My parents changed (which never really <br/>
occurred to me until I was married many years) into quite different, somber, <br/>
worried, fretful, fearful people-so not only did I get a &quot;someone&quot; to share my <br/>
parents attention, I got a &quot;different set &quot;of parents along with it. I think <br/>
realising this has helped ease that concern for him, but he&#39;s also been the only <br/>
child for 2 1/2 years longer than I was. BUT, he&#39;s also more mature because of <br/>
it...<br/>
I think we&#39;re doing okay in the &quot;don&#39;t  present the bad stuff&quot; area... He&#39;s <br/>
very excited about changing diapers, holding, carrying, teaching, etc.-even <br/>
wanted the baby to sleep in his room, until I explained about the crying babies <br/>
sometimes do in the middle of the night, and napping he would have to play <br/>
almost silently through... so now he&#39;s happy to have the baby in the room next to <br/>
his. He DID surprise me one day by referring to the baby as &quot;your&quot; baby-but I <br/>
was quick to let him know it was ALL our baby-Daddy, Wyl and Mama&#39;s. People <br/>
outside of the three of us don&#39;t help, though-they think they are, but my Dad is <br/>
especially ... severe-telling him very somberly that he will have lots of <br/>
RESPONSIBILITY when the baby comes, and &quot;you know, you won&#39;t be able to ____ <br/>
(shout, run recklessly through the house, whatever) when the baby comes, and stuff <br/>
like that. He *thinks* he&#39;s helping, but it worries me...<br/>
Maybe its all just pre-new baby jitters...? I don&#39;t know-last time, all I <br/>
could focus on was the delivery and the *pain* that no one would tell me anything <br/>
about-except &quot;its the easiest pain to forget&quot;. ::eyeroll:: not helpfull. But, <br/>
now I know what to expect at labor time, so maybe my focus is moving to the <br/>
unknown step beyond that? I&#39;m not a worrier by any means, but with new stuff, I <br/>
do like to do reasearch and try to find out what to expect, so maybe...<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

some  frustration.***<br/>
<br/>
I remember when the Simpsons first arrived on our screens and I was in<br/>
Vancouver with my father and his family. My 7 yr old brother became Bart.<br/>
Frustrated the hell out of my stepmum and dad. Last I heard he had been in<br/>
trouble with the police for stealing or assault. (I think he would be about<br/>
18 now) But his dad worked long hours and most of the talking they did was<br/>
question and answer stuff you know, &quot;have you done your homework?&quot; &quot;not yet<br/>
dad&quot; that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
My boys love the Simpsons, they hang out for 6pm. I have never seen them<br/>
acting it out.<br/>

I think it&#39;s understandable to feel uneasy about these<br/>
things, but I would suggest that it&#39;s GREAT that he<br/>
acts out these things in play, he&#39;s processing and<br/>
exploring the *ideas*. Sometimes parents misinterpret<br/>
this as him *accepting* these ideas about life, and<br/>
yes, that might happen, like the being afraid of the<br/>
dark issue.  <br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re there, you&#39;re paying attention, you&#39;re<br/>
responsive to the issues he is dealing with as he<br/>
becomes exposed to them, and that makes *all the<br/>
difference in the world*. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re doing great, try not to *worry* so much! Try to<br/>
remember that these issues fade and change with time. <br/>
He won&#39;t be afraid of the dark forever, his<br/>
experiences will change his beliefs about things. <br/>
<br/>
Like, my 10 year old still leaves his closet light on<br/>
at nite at home, but when we were on vacation, he<br/>
shared a room with his uncle, and he slept in there<br/>
with all the lights off and the door closed, no<br/>
problem.  ;-) <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that he&#39;d &quot;rather&quot; have a bit of light,<br/>
that&#39;s all. <br/>
