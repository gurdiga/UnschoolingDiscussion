&lt;&lt; Although it doesn&#39;t often *occur* to him to clean <br/>
 things up (especially his room), he&#39;s quite helpful when asked.  So the 3 yo <br/>
 stage won&#39;t last forever &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Laura-- I&#39;m so glad this phase won&#39;t last forever... I do have a child who <br/>
is older t than  my 3 yo.  He will be 6 in Sept, and is a little bit better <br/>
about helping to clean...but not a whole lot.  He is more or less <br/>
inconsistent attitude-wise when it comes time to clean.  Maybe he&#39;s crossing <br/>
out of one phase into another.  :)  Sounds like your son did a great job <br/>
taking care of his mess in the kitchen!  I look forward to that!  :)  ~Karen</div>
