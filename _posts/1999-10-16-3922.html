<div id="ygrps-yiv-730707361">I may be way behind the times here... but I&#39;ve only found the Redwall series in harback around here.  Yesterday, the entire series was at my local supermarket in paperback.  I don&#39;t know if the paperback version is new or not... just know I hadn&#39;t seen it before... and thought it was perhaps worth mentioning. :-)<br/>

    Redwall is a youth fantasy series with mice and other animals. It looks <br/>
great! I have just found out about it myself and I know my kids will love it! <br/>
It is right up our alley, genre-wise. All you gamers out there should enjoy <br/>
these books!<br/>
