<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711000308">&lt;&lt; But this &quot;I would rather yell than...&quot; argument is a lot like the &quot;I would<br/>
rather spank...&quot; arguments I&#39;ve heard. &quot;I would rather spank than scream at<br/>
my kids.&quot; &quot;I would rather spank than ground them.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good tool, though, to make the better of two choices when a person is <br/>
stressed adn trying to decide what to do.  It&#39;s cheap justification if the <br/>
two choices remain the same, but it&#39;s grown and progress if then afterward <br/>
the parent says &quot;I chose yelling over spanking.  Next time my two choices are <br/>
going to be yelling or taking a deep breath and saying something quietly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the time after that it can be either the quiet put-down or walking away <br/>
for a few minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
Progressive growth toward an ideal is doable by anyone with a desire to be <br/>
thoughtful about it.<br/>
<br/>
It works for all kinds of things, like getting a more period SCA camp, taking <br/>
better care of your car, making your bedroom more organized (I could just <br/>
leave the laundry on the bed, or I could put it back in the basket...  that <br/>
could build up to taking a deep breath and putting at least SOME of it in the <br/>
drawers and closets even though you&#39;d much rather not).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358088085">Has anyone ever heard of the book How to Make Your Children Mind Without<br/>
Losing Yours?  I read it when my oldest was a baby.  It helps me whenever<br/>
I babysit another child who I really don&#39;t have a lot of control over. <br/>
But I don&#39;t have it anymore.  Still, I remember two points that really<br/>
help.  One is to do it with them, that is, whatever it is that they don&#39;t<br/>
want to do.  The other is, if they try and weasel out of something, just<br/>
say &quot;Susie, take out the garbage&quot; repeatedly in a calm, distinct and<br/>
polite manner until they see you&#39;re not going to let it go or bow to<br/>
them, and do it.  Something else I remember learning in a program called<br/>
Second Step, (I think that is the name), was to give the child a choice. <br/>
This really helps teachers in public school who are working with special<br/>
needs children (abused, violent backgrounds who do not respond well to<br/>
threats).  They would say, &quot;John, will you put the apple in the garbage?&quot;<br/>
 If he&#39;s defiant, the teacher would say, &quot;You have a choice to either put<br/>
the apple in the garbage or sit down in the hall, which do you choose?&quot; <br/>
That way the child has a feeling of control, so it takes away the need to<br/>
rebel.  Rebellion is a result of a feeling of powerlessness.  Choice<br/>
gives the child power.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if any of this helps.  I know it&#39;s a good reminder for me.<br/>

aren&#39;t real choice, these are artificial - any kid who hasn&#39;t been<br/>
totally brainwashed by the system will say something like, &quot;Neither, I&#39;m<br/>
going to sit here on my butt and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333079191">Another question related to how do you get your kids<br/>
to do something (good) or to not do something (bad).<br/>
How do all of you handle kids not taking &#39;no&#39; for an<br/>
answer.  For example one of my dd may want me to<br/>
purchase something that we can&#39;t/don&#39;t want to (for<br/>
whatever the reason.) Another example is when dd wants<br/>
to do something that I do not feel she should do<br/>
(example: go to a party of 18-22 yo where no parents<br/>
will be present -she&#39;s 13, but begs to hang out with<br/>
18-20yo sisters. They say go ask mom because they know<br/>
I&#39;ll say no and they don&#39;t want to be the &#39;bad guys&#39;. <br/>
If I didn&#39;t say no (thinking they wouldn&#39;t bring her<br/>
anyway) they may actually bring her - (they&#39;re the<br/>
type who would have eaten the brownies rather than<br/>
back down themselves.)  This really relates back to<br/>
the rules regarding safety thing. So...how does<br/>
everyone else handle it when kids won&#39;t take no for an<br/>
answer (without &#39;begging&#39;)?<br/>

get it when I say No as they point something out -- and usually their 2 cents <br/>

can afford it.  And they are allowed to spend their birthday money on <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128963042">&lt;&lt; They would say, &quot;John, will you put the apple in the garbage?&quot;<br/>
 If he&#39;s defiant, the teacher would say, &quot;You have a choice to either put<br/>
the apple in the garbage or sit down in the hall, which do you choose?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;Could you put the apple in the garbage, or take the dishes to the <br/>
sink?&quot; that&#39;s a more reasonable, helpful, healthy choice.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;give a choice&quot; advice is used a lot with kids who were traumatized and <br/>
are stuck without being able to think easily.  Instead of showing them a <br/>
whole menu and saying &quot;What do you want to eat?&quot;  if you see them becoming <br/>
stuck and zoned out, say &quot;Do you want a hamburger or grilled cheese?&quot;  That <br/>
makes it easier for them<br/>
<br/>
To use &quot;sitting in the hall&quot; (a punishment) as the option, it&#39;s on the <br/>
slippery slope to what abusers do when they say the victim had a choice <br/>
between doing what they said or being hit or abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
And I think with &quot;chores&quot; as well as with many other things, under normal <br/>
circumstances kids should be able to negotiate their way out of doing <br/>
something.  Maybe they&#39;re really upset about something and they need to stay <br/>
in their room to maintain their calm.  Maybe they have a hurt foot from <br/>
kicking something stupid and they don&#39;t want to talk about it.  Maybe they&#39;re <br/>
too angry with a sibling to be cooperating with them yet, and the mom is <br/>
trying to get them to go stack wood together.<br/>
<br/>
When parents are sensitive and flexible with their kids they&#39;re more likely <br/>
to get respectful sensitivity and flexibility in return. <br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;please&quot; a lot, and &quot;thank you&quot; a ton.<br/>

<br/>
Marty is younger than Kirby and sometimes gets told no, he can&#39;t go (by Kirby <br/>
or by me).  Kirby&#39;s friends might be saying they don&#39;t mind if Marty goes, <br/>
but Kirby minds, and I don&#39;t want Marty ruining Kirby&#39;s fun just by being <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
So I offer Marty an alternative.  I&#39;ll get one of his friends over, or take <br/>
him and a friend to a movie (and pay their way).  Or Marty and I take his dog <br/>
to a park to chase balls.  Something where Marty is NOT in his room feeling <br/>
sorry for himself for being home alone.<br/>
<br/>
I buy them off with a distraction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977243283">Yeah, I see your point.  I was just quoting a story I heard at second<br/>
step.  The teacher made the mistake of saying, &quot;Throw that in the garbage<br/>
right now!&quot; and the child went ballistic, throwing chairs around and<br/>
everything.  She said she wishes she had requested, then given choices if<br/>
he refused to cooperate, to have been more respectful.  I have given my<br/>
children choices between a positive or negative behavior, and they will<br/>
pause, and say, &quot;Okay,I choose this.&quot;  I have only done it a few times<br/>
when to have not done it meant not respecting my child.  I would never<br/>
say it to my older children, because they already know it is their<br/>
choice.  I just wanted them to know that they did not have to only have<br/>
the choice of throwing a fit.  I think the clue is in your motive.  Do<br/>
you want to control them, then they&#39;ll see through it.  Do you want to<br/>
show them you respect them and yourself enough to give a boundary?  They<br/>
will feel honored.  Choosing your battles.  Some things are just stupid,<br/>
and there is no need to get control of a situation.  But at times, the<br/>
child is asking for direction or for safe boundaries, because they never<br/>
learned them at home in a positive, nurturing environment.  If my husband<br/>
were cheating on me, I would respectfully give him the option of leaving<br/>
that person behind or of leaving me.  That is because I respect myself,<br/>
and I respect him.  But if he is leaving his socks on the floor, I will<br/>
just ask them to pick them up.  If he doesn&#39;t , I leave them there or<br/>
move them to his side of the room.  Because it is not a battle worth<br/>
fighting, even if it does get on my nerves.  If I told him &quot;Get rid of<br/>
the socks or else...&quot;  that is stupid.  This an interesting subject.<br/>

safety, and I love you too much for that.  <br/>
Begging doesn&#39;t get you the things you want at the store, getting a<br/>

decision and then change my mind (because it was a bad<br/>
call in the first place - like I told dd no tv during<br/>

mind) and dd interpret the change as being due to<br/>
begging. (And this is not to say that I haven&#39;t, at<br/>
times, given in because they really did wear me down.)<br/>

just ask them to pick them up.  If he doesn&#39;t , I leave them there or<br/>
move them to his side of the room.  Because it is not a battle worth<br/>
fighting, even if it does get on my nerves.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d pick them up for him, and he would do the same for me.<br/>
<br/>
Works the same way with kids, pretty much!<br/>

everything to be where he can see it and his side of the room is really<br/>
very small.  We live in a very small place.<br/>
