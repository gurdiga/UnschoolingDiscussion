 </span></blockquote>Thank you Tracy, that was lovely.  I lost a child when I was a teen, and I was crying and sharing my grief with a friend last year.  She is a very spiritual person and has reached a high level of psychic development in our mututal religious path.  She said to me that she believed that my elder son was that child, come back to me.  He found his time to be born.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971820757">My youngest was drawing on herself a couple of weeks ago and <br/>
told me it was for protection.  I just said &#39;oh,&#39; and now I leave her <br/>
to her doodling.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to mess with natural <br/>
