<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769364880">Hi Deana<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve been given lots of advice- excellent websites to read...it&#39;s early<br/>
days of course, but I don&#39;t think you really understand unschooling.  When<br/>
you do, and are doing it- your husband will see the value in it.  He can&#39;t<br/>
see it while noone he knows is doing it...just my opinion.<br/>
<br/>

Any ideas on how to convince my<br/>
husband unschooling is better and any ways to feeling like I am not a<br/>
failure mom by letting her do what society says is wrong.<br/>
