        I&#39;m sure you must be able to get some. The small city where I live <br/>
has two mexican restaurants and they must be getting them from somewhere. <br/>
Which bit of England are you in? I&#39;m in the East Midlands. Maybe I can ask <br/>
around on some of the UK lists I&#39;m on to see if I can find a source for you?<br/>

it was by a highway with exits.  Maybe south of Beverley.  But if it&#39;s at one <br/>
Safeway, it might be at most).   On packaging, if it says &quot;chile verde&quot; it&#39;s <br/>
probably a green chile sauce for cooking.  If it says &quot;green chile&quot; it&#39;s <br/>
probably the ingredient itself, just canned.   Just like England brought <br/>
Norman words in and let the Anglo-Saxon word mean one thing and the Norman <br/>
French word mean something slightly different, New Mexico does that with <br/>
Spanish and English sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
One VERY common thing to do with it here is to put it on cheeseburgers.   The <br/>
local hamburger chains will ask if you want green chile, very often (it&#39;s ten <br/>
or fifteen cents exta sometimes, or free) and even the national chains might <br/>
have it sometimes.   At a restaurant you might be asked simply &quot;red or <br/>
green?&quot; meaning what kind of sauce you want on a plate meal.<br/>
<br/>
But if you get it in England, it would be good mixed with eggs with that <br/>
REALLY good bacon you have there.  We have nothing like that here.  A <br/>
teaspoonful of chile&#39;s a good single-dose for eggs or a sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
On an enchilada plate, it will have about half a cup of sauce or more.  Lots. <br/>
 It&#39;s okay to leave lots of it there if you need to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146579883">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the offer, but having eaten at a few Mexican restaurants <br/>
since we arrived I&#39;m not to sure of their sources.  We are in <br/>
Durham, so may be more limited than you are to sources.  I think the <br/>
plan is to get by as best we can until we go back to the U.S. this <br/>
summer for a brief visit and then smuggle as much dried chile as we <br/>
can manage to get fit into our luggage.  I&#39;m hoping that the chile <br/>
sniffing dogs will be down with colds when we come through.<br/>
