<br/>
I totally disagree with your comparisons of our President... you must be<br/>
focusing on one aspect of the man (and office) and I on another.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, am saddened by the thought that many mothers can&#39;t find food for<br/>
their children. And the US gives and gives to help. Many nations call upon<br/>
our government for help in their political crisis... our we to respond by<br/>
turning our backs on them? Should we have ignored the plea from the French?<br/>
the Jews? the Vietnamese? the Kuwaities? Just to name a few... That would<br/>
seem far crueler.<br/>
<br/>
Has America stuck it&#39;s nose were it doesn&#39;t belong? Most certaintly. Even<br/>
where it wasn&#39;t wanted? Most certatintly. Was that right? Absolutely not.<br/>
But it happens in the life of an individual and it happens in the life a<br/>
nation too.<br/>
<br/>
We make mistakes, our generation makes mistakes, our nation makes mistakes.<br/>
In the USA I have the right to make those mistakes and to learn from them.<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t we give our nation the same chance?<br/>
<br/>
Imperfect people = Imperfect nation<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858059258">Our nation has had over 200 years to learn from their mistakes.  However,<br/>
our government does not feel that it has made mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Should we have turned our backs on the French?  Most certainly!!!  What<br/>
right did they have to keep a sovereign nation in servitude and what right<br/>
did we have to help them?  And asking about Vietnam shows a little lack of<br/>
historical knowledge.  Vietnam was the country we marched into at the<br/>
request of the French.<br/>
<br/>
And, you can&#39;t look at the end of any given set of circumstances to make<br/>
your judgement.  Had our government not interfered to begin with and<br/>
assisted Suddam&#39;s power drive there never would have been a Kuwait.<br/>
<br/>
Had our government never jumped into the middle of there *attempted* Russian<br/>
takeover, there were not be a Taliban.  In fact, if we had been so busy<br/>
giving the Taliban MILLIONS of dollars each year including $3 mil less than<br/>
a month before 9/11 they wouldn&#39;t have the money and resources to fight us<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
We did the same with Noreiga.  We in our so great and marvelous American<br/>
wisdom decided who should be the government.  Then when he wouldn&#39;t play by<br/>
our rules we hauled him in and put him in prison.<br/>
<br/>
And, no offense to anyone who is Jewish on this list but exactly why should<br/>
be help the Israelis invade a land they hadn&#39;t lived in for over a 1000<br/>
years so they could establish a religious community?<br/>
<br/>
As to focusing on one aspect of the man whose daddy bought him a presidency,<br/>
please go study his whole life.  You can go and find out all there is to<br/>
know about prior presidents&#39; grades when they were in college.  Not one of<br/>
their transcripts has ever been sealed.  The minute the campaign started his<br/>
were sealed.  His daddy bought him into the National Guard AHEAD of 500 men<br/>
on the waiting list.  AND, to make sure he didn&#39;t have to go to war, he<br/>
bought him into training on a plane that was decomissioned and would never<br/>
be used in the war so that he wouldn&#39;t have to go to war.  He never showed<br/>
up half the time and was AWOL on more than once.  He couldn&#39;t run a business<br/>
if his life depended on it.  He was a figure head for political purposes.<br/>
His oil businesses were on the verge of bankruptsy when they were bought up.<br/>
<br/>
Shall I go on about the many negative aspects and zero positive aspects<br/>
about this person?<br/>
<br/>
And I certainly hope everyone wakes up and smells the coffee before this<br/>
recession becomes a depression!<br/>
