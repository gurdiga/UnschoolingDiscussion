I&#39;m Nancy, 35 yr. old mom to Joshua, 7, and Hannah, 5. The kids are still<br/>

I think the first step is to accept the fact that your mom might always<br/>
disagree with your parenting choices.  I still get that same feeling of<br/>
anxiety when I  make a parenting choice I know my father will disagree with.<br/>
Even though I am almost 37 years old, I have this innate desire to please<br/>
him!  I believe many adults never outgrow this.  But for me, it came down to<br/>
the choice of whether or not I wanted to compromise my beliefs, and my<br/>
children&#39;s happiness, to please my father.  And of course I had to<br/>
prioritize.  My children won.<br/>
When I have to present my parents with a decision I have made, I try to<br/>
state what I have to say as succinctly and firmly as possible.  The longer I<br/>
talk about it and try to explain it, the more nervous I get.  My response to<br/>
their objections is usually something along the lines of &quot;Thank you for your<br/>
opinion, but we have made our decision.&quot;  Repeat if necessary!<br/>
Hope it works out for you!<br/>
Lisa<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nancy, do not worry, you are not the first person to be more worried about<br/>
their mom than they are about actually homeschooling.  And not to sound<br/>
melodramatic, but this is truly a large step for you and your own growth.<br/>
When we as adults need to take action to protect our children, and bump up<br/>
against the control used against us for most of our lives......well... it&#39;s<br/>
a big hair deal and scary as all get out.  Once you *defy*, once you make<br/>
this your own decision, a hundred other things will come up.  Things you<br/>
need to change for the good of your family.<br/>
<br/>
All I can really offer you is that the worst part is THIS part, this<br/>
worrying and thinking about what to do.  Once you decide to just do it, say<br/>
it and live with her reaction, then things begin to settle down.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not the best one to talk about what happens after you take your life<br/>
into you own hands and disregard your mother&#39;s input.  When I drew the line<br/>
in the sand and said no more..... my mother quit talking to me.  It&#39;ll be 9<br/>
years this coming March.  We always had  a difficult relationship and my<br/>
mother has some serious problems, well mainly she&#39;s just downright hillbilly<br/>
mean, but you could make a case for mitigating circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
However you decide to handle her, just know that doing so creates a way for<br/>
you to grow and become even more of your own person. It&#39;s well worth doing,<br/>
no matter how hard it is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that you are your kids&#39; mom (I sound like Dr Laura,<br/>
ack!), and your mother isn&#39;t. She raised you in the way she thought best,<br/>
now it&#39;s your turn with your children. If she can&#39;t handle that, then I<br/>
probably just wouldn&#39;t discuss it with her. Smile and change the subject.<br/>
You need to do what you feel is best for your children.<br/>
<br/>
How close do you live to her? Can you move?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some things I did with my mil:<br/>
<br/>
I thanked her for caring about her grandchildren.<br/>
<br/>
I gave her a list of books and other resources she could read. (She hasn&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
I offered to copy the education codes and send them to her so she could read<br/>
them herself (she declined.)<br/>
<br/>
I gave her phone numbers for both inclusive homeschooling organizations in<br/>
my state so she could call for more information (to balance out the fact<br/>
that she had already called the county education department, and they told<br/>
her what we were doing was illegal... sigh) I also gave her a contact for a<br/>
homeschooling group in her state and encouraged her to call and ask<br/>
questions. I knew somebody in that group who offered to accompany her to a<br/>
park day and meet some other homeschoolers. She declined.<br/>
<br/>
It helps that we are 1000 miles apart.<br/>

Hi Nancy --<br/>
<br/>
My thought is that you have tried the ps system and it has not worked for <br/>
you.  The way we did it was to do it and then tell Gramma.  (MIL, <br/>
surprisingly, and school teacher SIL, were both completely for hsing.)  Not <br/>
that she was as upset as your mother seems to be about the hs possibility.  <br/>
But she had her very strong doubts.  She rarely (if ever) questions my <br/>
decisions about my children, but felt compelled to ask her questions (all the <br/>
usual ones so I had all the usual answers from this and other lists).  After <br/>
about an hour on the phone she was satisfied.  Now she buys them workbooks <br/>
and regular books and art supplies and she started volunteering in the elem <br/>
school I went to as a child and I hear a lot of reports about how awful it is <br/>
-- she has started buying the teacher supplies, the classes are overcrowded, <br/>
in this case, the teacher has been forced back to work (in a 1st grade class <br/>
with 28 kids) while recovering from a crushed foot and still in a wheelchair. <br/>
 She is not 100% (probably about 99%) convinced but has gotten over her <br/>
initial fears.<br/>
<br/>
I would say:  inform her after fact, brace yourself, prepare answers for the <br/>
questions you know she will have, give her time to get used to the idea, send <br/>
her lots of good news updates, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, you are not obligated to inform anyone (even your mom) about the actual <br/>
ins and outs of your hsing day -- if she is more comfortable thinking of <br/>
school at home but you plan to evolve to a more un approach, this might not <br/>
be the best time to broach that subject.   <br/>
<br/>
Also, you could throw her a bone.  &quot;You know, Mom, we do wish it had worked <br/>
out at the ps.  We really did try it.  But then X happened and little Wally <br/>
was having problems with Y and you know Z has been terrible for him.  But, <br/>
maybe sometime in the future, we might consider re-entering the system.  We <br/>
want to keep all of our options open.&quot;  You don&#39;t even have to mean it but it <br/>
might give her comfort during the transition period.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353133741">Boy can I relate.  My Mom has become quite a supporter of homeschooling,<br/>
family bed, long term breastfeeding, but it has taken time.  Does your<br/>
mother live nearby?  I used to cringe when my dd told Gramma on the phone<br/>
that &quot;we didn&#39;t have school today&quot; as we ventured from homeschooling<br/>
kindergarten to unschooling.  She still doesn&#39;t know exactly how we spend<br/>
our days.<br/>
Buy her a book about homeschooling.  I like David Guterson&#39;s book &quot;Family<br/>
Matters&quot; as a general introduction to those who are anti-hs.  He shares<br/>
how his father, an attorney, thinks homeschooling is wrong but defends in<br/>
court parents&#39; rights to homeschool.<br/>
I also think &quot;adhd&quot; kids can really thrive at home.  Ask her to give you<br/>
a year and then see what she thinks. <br/>
Let her imagine you spend time at the table doing school every day. <br/>
Learn some &quot;educationese&quot; about what your kids are doing.  (Playing in<br/>
the sandbox can be described as geometry)<br/>
Or .. just throw it all in her face and risk her disapproval.  What is<br/>
the worst that could happen?  <br/>
It seems to me that your real problem is a fear of her disapproval.  Have<br/>
you read the &quot;Dance of Anger&quot;?  This was recommended to me for people who<br/>
have trouble letting their parents see who they really are.  Remember to<br/>
use &quot;I messages&quot;.  <br/>
I try to give my mom positive strokes for what I like about the way she<br/>
parented me and the fact that everything she did was out of love and what<br/>
she thought best based on what she knew then.  Sometimes parents can take<br/>
it as rejection when we do things differently.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758256862">Bury her in paper, books, articles off the net and that great list of<br/>
homeschoolers that are famous (anyone have that??  Isn&#39;t Supreme Court<br/>
Justice Day-O&#39;Connoer or whatever her name is one of them??) and somewhere<br/>
there is also, maybe on the list for ADD/ADHD homeschoolers, some real good<br/>
info that shows that ADD/ADHD kids go much better in homeschooling than ps<br/>
and, in fact, quite frequently there &quot;symptoms&quot; disappear.  Also, what ps<br/>
doesn&#39;t address is different learning styles and I have a kidlet that would<br/>
be &quot;labeled&quot; ADHD because she is a wiggle learner (someone on the list<br/>
knows the real name for that).  She just has to wiggle and there is no way<br/>
short of a straight jacket and strapping her down to a gurney that you are<br/>
going to keep her in one place.  She is 7 and at home she taught herself to<br/>
read (reads at 7th grade level) and is doing 3 digit adding and subtracting<br/>
(a need she found because she loves her money &lt;g&gt;).  This wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
happened in ps.  She would have been labeled and they would have been<br/>
screaming for her to be drugged.<br/>
<br/>
I also have 3 kidlets that are ADD/ADHD and believe me they do 100% better<br/>
in homeschooling (actually we unschool) than they ever did in ps!   AND, no<br/>
meds!!!!<br/>

children at a late age (late 30s mom and early 40s dad) with my brother and<br/>
I, yet they then resented (and told us as much) having children &quot;our age&quot;<br/>

and not children wanted from some need to parent.  They were already not<br/>
parenting the children that they had.<br/>
<br/>
You add to that the fact that my father&#39;s first wife of 18 years (and<br/>
parent to 4 of my siblings) was a therapist/counselor and my father has a<br/>
multiple Master&#39;s degree education.  My mother had some college but was<br/>
definately more ignorant than my father, even though she was the eldest of<br/>
7 siblings, the youngest of whom were born when she had a child of her own.<br/>
 So she knew about children even before she began to have her own.  My<br/>
father had an innate distrust of counselors, therapist, mental health<br/>
professionals, child psychology in general, due to his nasty divorce and<br/>
refused to see problems with us or address them as what they were.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll ask you all for your opinion on this (just one small example.)  If you<br/>
have a five year old child who was writing &quot;dark&quot; poetry (I was an early<br/>
literate) and writing runaway notes, packing a suitcase with blankie and<br/>
teddy and heading to the yard to sit and cry all day, or going on crying<br/>
jags after school for hours at a time, hiding under the bed to avoid school<br/>
or feining illness, WHAT would you do?<br/>
<br/>
Would you completely ignore the behavior?  Would you not even talk to the<br/>
child about it?  Would you blame the child and punish them for lying?  How<br/>
can a parent be so blind and so egocentric that they do not even see or<br/>
care to address a child with that kind of obvious pain and difficulty?  It<br/>
still makes me angry and it was just the very beginning.  It only got worse<br/>
from there.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Backs of the books she chooses.  If you look at the back where the <br/>
&gt; price<br/>
&gt; code is there will be a notation on most kids books that says &quot;RL&quot; <br/>
&gt; followed<br/>
&gt; by a number which can be a decimel.  So, if the book says &quot;RL7&quot; that <br/>
&gt; means<br/>
&gt; the reading level is 7th grade.  Also, I have some reading lists from<br/>
&gt; different school districts and some of her books appear there.  I <br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; had her tested, I don&#39;t believe in that because testing is just a <br/>
&gt; test of<br/>
&gt; the kids ability to take a test, IMHO.<br/>
