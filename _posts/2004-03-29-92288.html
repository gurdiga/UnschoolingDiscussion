<br/>
Harvest Moon?<br/>
It&#39;s for various gaming systems:  Nintendo and Playstation.  There are at <br/>
least four versions of it (somewhat different, but same guy and same <br/>
farming/village scenario in general).<br/>
<br/>
My kids at four really liked the Playroom/Treehouse/Backyard stuff.  Used to <br/>
be by Broderbund which is now defunct and I think maybe The Learning Company <br/>
has them now.<br/>
<br/>
I liked them because they all had musical this-or-that in addition to other <br/>
stuff.  They&#39;re not overtly educational.<br/>

Oh!  Holly likes Third Grade Adventure too.  It&#39;s a pattern-games &quot;mystery&quot; <br/>
kind of like Zoombinis.  Doesn&#39;t take much reading, it talks to you.  And the <br/>
games don&#39;t have numerals or words.  (One does, I think, now that I think...)<br/>

&lt;&lt; At that age Lydia liked Freddi Fish, PuttPutt,  Blue&#39;s Clues (particularly <br/>
Blue&#39;s Art and Blue&#39;s Birthday),  and Bear in the Big Blue House.   She likes <br/>
us to play with her, though, so I don&#39;t know how well a 4yo could play them <br/>
solo.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Putt Putt!  Yeah, those are good too.<br/>
<br/>
We have an art game with about a bear with patterns, and they liked &quot;A to <br/>
Zap&quot; (not much game to it, just clicking on alphabet blocks and things happen).<br/>

Jayn (4) likes almost all the online games at NickJr.com especially Dora,<br/>
Max and Ruby, and Bob the Builder. She also likes the games at Barbie.com,<br/>
Pollypocket.com and Divastars.com.<br/>
<br/>
We own on CD Rom a number of Barbie games, some of which she only plays part<br/>
of: &quot;Rapunzel&quot; she can now do all of, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;Pet<br/>
Rescue&quot;(a good beginner one), &quot;Barbie&#39;s Magical House&quot;, &quot;Princess Bride&quot; (no<br/>
connection to the book/movie) and &quot;Barbie Fashion Designer&quot; (also good for<br/>
sewers because it creates a doll size paper pattern).<br/>
<br/>
The other games Jayn loves are &quot;Kelly Club Clubhouse&quot;, &quot;Dora&quot; (we have two<br/>
different ones - one is more number oriented than the other), and numerous<br/>
(possibly all that exist) Disney Princess games, the favorite of which is a<br/>
dress up one where you can create your own princess model. <br/>
<br/>
On the Xbox we have &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;Barbie Horse Trails (or something)&quot;,<br/>
&quot;The Simpsons Hit and Run&quot; and &quot;Scooby Doo Haunted Mansion&quot;. Jayn&#39;s<br/>
abilities on these games are mostly just moving the characters around at<br/>
this stage, but we all play together and we have a small size controller for<br/>
her. She also watches her father playing his Halo etc. She is really clear<br/>
about what is &quot;computer generated&quot; animation these days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302899007">Oh, yeah,  more votes for some of the games that Robyn mentioned.  We also<br/>
have all the princess games -- her particular favorites are Cinderella<br/>
DollHouse, and 2 dress-up princess games, Barbie Detective 1 and 2, Barbie<br/>
Spy, (Barbie Detective 1 would be easy enough to be played by a 4 yo solo).<br/>
We LOVE the Barbie Fashion CD.  That was the first computer game that Lydia<br/>
had (found it at a thrift store when she was 3) and she still likes to play<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, also, here is a link that a friend sent me a couple of days ago for<br/>
&quot;free&quot; software-- works out to about $3/disk after you pay shipping.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.smart-estore.com/product_list.asp?StoreId=403897&CategoryId=52&SI">http://www.smart-estore.com/product_list.asp?StoreId=403897&CategoryId=52&SI</a><br/>
D=9871713655891&i=0&c=WSMS084&a=<br/>
Don&#39;t know anything about the company and Have no idea why they are selling<br/>
the disks this cheap.  We have all the ones on offer, so I haven&#39;t tried to<br/>
order from them myself.<br/>

You can get lots of old games for older game systems there to play on the PC. The site owners are seem ethical (they will remove downloads if a game is rereleased of if contacted by the software company) but it&#39;s still a legal gray area from my understanding.
