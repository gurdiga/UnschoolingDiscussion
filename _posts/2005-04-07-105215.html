<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304936960">**There is Japanese art, there are electronic  motion-activated singing <br/>
fish to mount on walls, there&#39;s the history of boats  and there&#39;s cooking!  **<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s cooking the fish, and then there&#39;s cooking *for* fish. There are <br/>
whole books written about making baits for various fish. <br/>
<br/>
I have volunteered to start a worm bin so my son and husband can have ready <br/>
bait to hand and so might be able to just go out fishing any old day after Mike <br/>
gets home from work. Maybe kids will get interested in the wormies life <br/>
cycle, and maybe they won&#39;t, but the worms will be there in any case, illustrating <br/>
soil building and decomposition and invertebrate biology. :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089527233">DH and DS stumbled upon a great way to get worms to surface so they <br/>
could go fishing: take a long metal spike (like the ones used to hold <br/>
landscaping railroad ties) and pound it into the ground a few inches. <br/>
Then tap on it with a wrench or other metal implement - they found a <br/>
ratcheting wrench worked great - apparently the vibration bothers <br/>
or &#39;tickles&#39; the worms and up they come - big long &#39;juicy&#39; ones too!</div>
