<div id="ygrps-yiv-717290045">&lt;&lt;Where are you, Liz? We&#39;re in West Toledo. The weather man is predicting 2<br/>
days of 30&#39;s next week, then 10 more days of frigid temps.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi Amy, we live in Sylvania.  Not too far from you at all.  My brother and<br/>
SIL live in West Toledo off of Jackman Rd.  Small world!<br/>
<br/>
I knew something was wrong this morning when I got all excited at the<br/>
prediction of 34 degrees one day this week.  I am not a fan of cold weather,<br/>
and this whole Winter season has been down right frigid.<br/>
