This is our family&#39;s favorite song.  My 5 year old sings it along with<br/>
all the rest. My favorite line from it is &quot;I ain&#39;t the sharpest tool in<br/>
the shed!&quot;<br/>
My 5 year old sings songs from Offspring, fortunately omiting some of<br/>
the more &quot;creative&quot; lyrics that he is not allowed to say.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about being a radical unschooler but I am most decidedly a<br/>
radical mom.  This summer I drove 13 kids 6,000 miles all over the<br/>
Southwest for 30 days, and hosted 26 kids (20 teenagers, 6 elementary<br/>
age) at my house for 18 days for an Ocean Challenge program that my<br/>
husband and I ran for our church.  We took the kids waterskiing, we had<br/>
a sea captain come to our house and teach them about navigation and that<br/>
<br/>
the sea can be a pretty cruel teacher.  He also taught them about video<br/>
production and we made a small skit and edited it at my house.  It was a<br/>
<br/>
pretty wild time.<br/>
<br/>
I got my butt chewed on this unschooling list for saying that I have no<br/>
qualms about pushing kids if they need it.  SO, if I get my butt chewed<br/>
again for saying so, so be it.  I deal with my 4 kids and all their<br/>
friends, and let me tell you, &quot;child-led&quot; may be fine, but &quot;20<br/>
teens-led&quot; can get to be annoying.  They DEFINITELY had to clean up the<br/>
messes they made, do their own cooking and laundry, and not beat on each<br/>
<br/>
other (let me rephrase that. not beat on each other TOO much (The arm<br/>
wrestling match at 3 a.m. after watching scary movies all night was a<br/>
hoot!).<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, by the time I got home from this insane summer, all I<br/>
wanted to do was have 7 margaritas, hop on a Harley and ride off into<br/>
the sunset never to be seen again.<br/>
<br/>
Our theme album for the entire summer was Americana by Offspring.<br/>
Staring at the Sun became our theme song.  (ALthough my 5 year old<br/>
REALLY liked the song &quot;Get a Job&quot; and I thought &quot;She&#39;s got issues&quot; was<br/>
hysterical.<br/>
<br/>
If ya&#39;ll don&#39;t know these songs, never mind.  I am not a sane person,<br/>
and normally am surrounded by my kids, their friends, my husband and the<br/>
<br/>
few hardy souls who can take my level of chaos and survive.<br/>

I have a T-shirt that says &quot;Living Example of Chaos Theory.&quot;<br/>

I just had to tell you all that we sing this one together too.  And we had a <br/>
lengthy discussion about the line, &quot;Only shooting stars break the mold.&quot;  My <br/>
children had never heard that expression before.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330419345">Well, D.J., apart from wanting to point out that you are (in case you didn&#39;t<br/>
realise the fact) totally insane - 26 kids - the very thought of it makes my<br/>
brain start to disintegrate &lt;g&gt; I wanted to point out something.<br/>
<br/>
You said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I got my butt chewed on this unschooling list for saying that I have no<br/>
&gt; qualms about pushing kids if they need it.  SO, if I get my butt chewed<br/>
&gt; again for saying so, so be it.  I deal with my 4 kids and all their<br/>
&gt; friends, and let me tell you, &quot;child-led&quot; may be fine, but &quot;20<br/>
&gt; teens-led&quot; can get to be annoying.  They DEFINITELY had to clean up the<br/>
&gt; messes they made, do their own cooking and laundry, and not beat on each<br/>
&gt; other (let me rephrase that. not beat on each other TOO much (The arm<br/>
&gt; wrestling match at 3 a.m. after watching scary movies all night was a<br/>
&gt; hoot!).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IMO there is a big difference between pushing a child to learn something they<br/>
don&#39;t want to that they can&#39;t see any relevance to or whatever, and<br/>
contributing to making the household they are living in work. I would have<br/>
asked the same - if I was mad enough to allow 20 teens near me at the same<br/>
time - but pushing them to do academics or learn mechanics or whatever is<br/>
different IMO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408107604">Hey there DJ, Sessuale (radical lurker *and unschooler mom) here :)<br/>
<br/>
You are too much!  Although I most definitely would not have done the summer thang the way you did I definitely have to agree with you.    I liked the points you made (and your 5 yr old sounds like a hoot) but it saddens me that even now and even on a list like this one there are still times when a home/unschooling mom feels like she has to preface or apologize for talking about the way that her family runs smoothly.  I guess I&#39;m talking about that sometimes heated debate over child-led vs. discipline.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in child led, but I also believe in give and take.  *And I think there are more of us out there than you might think.  There are many  *radical unschooling moms who * also take a hand as well as lend it you know.  We tend to be quieter but we&#39;re out there.  Personally I believe pushing your child is wrong.  But a gentle nudge?  No prob.  The way I see it I don&#39;t believe that all children are lazy or lethargic or that they all need to Pavlovian motivation (the way the majority of the American school system believes) but I do believe they are human.  And we humans can be a tad stubborn and yes, sometimes even a little lazy (gasp!) at times.  That nasty bug procrastination can bite any of us.  Even children.  I think most of us can think of a time when we could have kicked ourselves for taking so long to do something or other.    A friendly nudge in the right direction balanced with loving discipline can sometimes be just the ticket.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I want that T-shirt!<br/>
<br/>
ciao, Sessuale2323<br/>
