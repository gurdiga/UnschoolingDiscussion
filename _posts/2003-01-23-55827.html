Dear Sandra, <br/>
 I am a reader of your articles in HEM, as well as of your posts on Unschooling-dotcom.  I admire your wisdom and experience, and would appreciate some advice.<br/>
I am a mom of 2 kids, ages 3 and 5+.  Neither child has ever been to daycare, preschool, or school.  I have mountains of books on homeschooling, unschooling, classical education and the like.<br/>
Unfortunately, I am lacking in the arenas of confidence and well-being as they relate to my participation in the &quot;education&quot; of my children.<br/>
Recently I went to my 1st review under an umbrella group.  The reviewer is a Christian who operates under the OK of her church.  I am not religiously affiliated;  I am placing myself and children under this umbrella to avoid BOE scrutiny/ interference.  I went to the review with a daily log detailing our family&#39;s activities as they related to living, loving, learning,discovering and amazement--with a dash of humour thrown in here and there.  The reviewer was almost astounded with the format and amount of information.  Alas, when all was said and done, she didn&#39;t even read what was made available for her, but wanted instead, an outline form to keep for her records, and worksheet books/ papers as proof that my child was actually doing &quot;required&quot; work.<br/>
Well, I had been anxious before, what with my young &#39;uns spending mucho time on the computer playing games, in front of the TV watching cartoons fervently, ( in addition to many other activities, discussions, etc. both in and out of doors,) and disdainful of any coercion period.  Now with the specter of workbooks looming on the near horizon, I am approaching meltdown and am very unsure of myself, and what the future holds.  I am attracted to what I understand of unschooling.  Then when I pick up a book like The Well~Trained Mind, by Jessie Wise and Susan Wise Bauer,  I freak out and want to throw in the towel.  <br/>
I am afraid that I have not developed even myself to an &quot;acceptable&quot; degree and have a Swiss cheese archetype to show for my personal curriculum model.<br/>
If you have read thus far, thank-you for your time.  Should you choose to reply, I would be immensely grateful.<br/>

Hi, &quot;edgeofchaos&quot; --<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in?  Are you familiar with the laws of your state<br/>
that pertain to homeschoooling?  A good, local homeschooling group, or a<br/>
state homeschooling organization can fill you in on laws, plus give you<br/>
current information about the homeschooling &quot;climate&quot; in your state.  I<br/>
just want to say that homeschooling really isn&#39;t dangerous.  (In the USA.)<br/>
<br/>
I know a few homeschoolers who are into classical education and none of<br/>
them do everything that is outlined in The Well Trained Mind.  I don&#39;t<br/>
see how anyone could possibly do all that.  I think trying to do all<br/>
that is a recipe for a nervous breakdown.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I still do have occasional fits of nervousness about whether<br/>
enough learning is happening in my house.  I just try not to give in to them.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149156398">I&#39;m not Sandra, but we have pretty rigourous requirements in PA, including an end of year evaluation.<br/>
<br/>
We have the advantage of choosing our own evaluators though.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible for you to find another umbrella, or to use another evaluator within the umbrella you have?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d start there before freaking out over textbooks and such.  You need an end of year resource that agrees with your philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43509917">I&#39;m glad you sent this here.  I looked for the original one earlier today and <br/>
couldn&#39;t find it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s usually better to ask hundreds of people than one person anyway.<br/>

<br/>
Where do you think you&#39;ll get those things?<br/>
<br/>
How did you learn to feed babies?  From books before you had babies?<br/>
<br/>
How did you learn to hold and carry a baby?  How did you learn to change <br/>
diapers?<br/>
<br/>
All that happens on the job.  So does unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You need to just be DOING it, not reading about it.  And as you do it it will <br/>
start to make more and more sense.  Every success will give you confidence.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...but wanted instead, an outline form to keep for her records, and <br/>
worksheet books/ papers as proof that my child was actually doing &quot;required&quot; <br/>
work.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ask her for samples of other families&#39; records?<br/>
Find a different umbrella group?<br/>
<br/>
Learn to see the learning happening in all the things you&#39;re doing.  You can <br/>
do that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Well, I had been anxious before, what with my young &#39;uns spending mucho <br/>
time on the computer playing games, in front of the TV watching cartoons <br/>
fervently, ( in addition to many other activities, discussions, etc. both in <br/>
and out of doors,) and disdainful of any coercion period.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t need coercion to write down what they&#39;ve learned.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now with the specter of workbooks looming on the near horizon&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t have to use workbooks if you don&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am afraid that I have not developed even myself to an &quot;acceptable&quot; degree <br/>
and have a Swiss cheese archetype to show for my personal curriculum model.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Forget curriculum then.  You don&#39;t need one.<br/>
<br/>
Please read these and actually DO some of the stuff.  Reading and being <br/>
surrounded by readings and verbal input is like surrounding yourself with <br/>
articles on diapering and nursing, but not actually picking up the baby and <br/>
doing it, and looking at the baby to see what she thinks about it, and <br/>
smiling and cooing back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
The same way the kids can learn from videos and computer games and stuff, YOU <br/>
can be learning too, with them, not necessarily the same things.  DO what you <br/>
want them to do.  Do it with them and start to feel the rhythm of natural <br/>
learning.<br/>
