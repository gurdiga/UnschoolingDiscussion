&gt; If people ask me what curriculum I use, I say &quot;The Wing-It&quot;. It usually<br/>
&gt; takes them a minute to realize what I mean. (and by that time, we&#39;re<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624300075">Youngest kidlet is the workbook guru of all time.  She costs me a fortune. <br/>
Of course, she doesn&#39;t use them the way they intended kids to use them &lt;g&gt; <br/>
She makes books out of them by tearing pages of different ones and says she<br/>
is going to sell them to the schools so kids won&#39;t be so bored.  She plucks<br/>
stuff out of various topic workbooks and puts them together to form books<br/>
that she says go together.  She&#39;ll find a math page from one that has word<br/>
problems that have to do with something she found in a spelling book and<br/>
something she found in a science book and do all those then make a new<br/>
cover for them with a title that she thinks works better.<br/>

gets hung up on things not having &#39;right&#39; answers.  but, hey, he&#39;s <br/>
young, he can get used to that idea *grin*  when he&#39;s had enough, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486740649">My son likes these too because they are colorful and concise. When it is a<br/>
topic that interests him, he usually goes into greater depth through<br/>
software and library books.<br/>
<br/>
I figure, if he can do a worksheet with , say, twenty noun identification<br/>
problems on it, and get them all right, why force him to do a chapter, or<br/>
make some sore of creative hoo-ha that is designed to show what the<br/>
worksheet already proved--he understands what a noun is!!<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, though, I must add that I think that it would probably<br/>
be deadly for ME to use all worksheets. I doubt ds would mind!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923601049">Thanks for the feedback on worksheets.  I am not going to worry about it b/c <br/>
it is not all that we do and he does seem to enjoy it and get something out <br/>
of it.  It is kinda funny to me that his association with &quot;school&quot; is ps <br/>
except that the only time he has ever been was preschool for 6 weeks!<br/>
