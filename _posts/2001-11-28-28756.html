I believe Barbra Streisand is totally shy.  Have you read/heard anything<br/>
baout that?   I imagine many stage/show business people are shy.  Could be<br/>
an interesting way to learn about how others have coped with being shy and<br/>
attaining succcess.<br/>
<br/>
My s-i-l....who has a great voice and dreamed of ebing a country<br/>
star.....says it&#39;s harder and harder to get by with a great voice.  In fact,<br/>
she felt that voice isn&#39;t even important anymore with all the mechanical<br/>
assistance there is to help the sound.  It&#39;s the performance ability that<br/>
counts.  That was HER take on it, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the group Hanson.  They&#39;ve been homeschooled.....I&#39;ll bet<br/>
they&#39;d offer your dd lots of insight.  maybe she could write them?<br/>
Susan<br/>
<br/>
I have no clue how to help her with this endeavor. IMO it *is* all those<br/>
things you mentioned and there&#39;s little I can offer in the way of help. She<br/>
enjoys watching the bios of rock singers on television and yet she&#39;s not<br/>
made the realization that most of them are not shy (she is) & not afraid of<br/>
singing in front of a crowd (she would be). She&#39;s still young and I keep<br/>
thinking that she might change her mind but meanwhile, I offer encouragement<br/>
to be what*ever* she wants to be.  Whatever she chooses, I &#39;m betting it<br/>
will be in a creative vein and will involve her voice (she talks constantly)<br/>
in some way. Whatever I do, I don&#39;t want to tell her she can&#39;t do<br/>
something... I was raised that way  and I believe it&#39;s wrong to do that to a<br/>
child.<br/>
I don&#39;t care what either child chooses to do as long as they are happy and<br/>
healthy.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086587994">I remember hearing once that Carly Simon was so shy, threw up every time<br/>
before going out on stage.  Talk about stress!  &#39;Course your daughter<br/>
probably never heard of Carly Simon.  = )   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641930758">Carly stopped touring for years because of the stress.  For a great majority<br/>
of folks they acclimatize or adjust or even get over the effects of going on<br/>
stage.<br/>
<br/>
At first I use to puke, then after I got over that, my legs wouldn&#39;t move.<br/>
I swear I couldn&#39;t move for anything.  My dad use to give me a push and then<br/>
once moving I was fine.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it doesn&#39;t bother me at all.<br/>
