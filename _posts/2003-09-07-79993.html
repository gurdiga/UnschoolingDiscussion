From Education Revolution E Newsletter, September 7. 2003 <br/>
<br/>
We need you to do something to help save a school: The Booroobin <br/>
Sudbury School;<br/>
a pioneering democratic school in Australia has been threatened with <br/>
closure.<br/>
The Queensland Non-State Schools Accreditation Board has decided that <br/>
their<br/>
accreditation will be withdrawn. The means the cutting off of all <br/>
funds for the<br/>
eight year old school, mainly because the Board thinks Booroobin&#39;s<br/>
non-compulsory classes mean that they can&#39;t impose the Board&#39;s <br/>
curriculum.<br/>
Please go to their site and if you are so moved, sign their petition <br/>
and send<br/>
some e mails to the address indicated there. We helped save <br/>
Summerhill that way<br/>
a few years ago. <br/>
<br/>
The Booroobin Sudbury School has asked that you consider signing the<br/>
following online Petition:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/408446208">http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/408446208</a>  <br/>
<br/>
Their future as a School is on the line.  The more support they get, <br/>
the<br/>
better their chances of survival will be.  Send the Petition on to <br/>
friends and<br/>
people interested in education and human rights.  Check out their web <br/>
site: <br/>

for details of their latest battle with their State Government.<br/>
