<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Once, my 5dd saw an open mouthed kiss between<br/>
&gt; a couple. She asked, &quot;Mom, are they really kissing with their mouths<br/>
&gt; open?&quot; I told her yes they were. She replied, &quot;Don&#39;t they know they can<br/>
&gt; get germs that way?&quot;<br/>
&gt; No more explaining was needed. She just thought they should know better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 6 year old son asked questions about that sort of kissing once.  I tried<br/>
to give him a short, simple answer that people who love each other the way a<br/>
Mommy and a Daddy do sometimes kiss that way.  He asked questions, wanted<br/>
details (about tongues), and wanted to try.  I&#39;ll answer questions, but I&#39;m<br/>
NOT going to show my son how to kiss!!!!!  Sheesh!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a couple weeks ago, before my husband left town, we were kissing.<br/>
And Tim watched us carefully, and when we quit, asked if we take so long<br/>
kissing because we can&#39;t get our tongues to touch at the right angle?<br/>
<br/>
I at least know that my husband left with a smile on his face!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
