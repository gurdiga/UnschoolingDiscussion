<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312604055">Sarah is wanting a Gameboy. Her only experience with them is an older Gameboy Color that someone gave her. She&#39;d been asking for the SP I think it is..the game opens like a laptop, only much smaller? But I&#39;m hearing alot of talk about the DS. I&#39;ve been looking online at them, and I&#39;m wondering how difficult the DS might be to learn to play. Is there a way to only use one screen at a time rather than both or is it not quite as difficult to get used to as it seems to me? I myself haven&#39;t had a Gameboy since the Colors came out either. (been awhile, we&#39;re a little behind the times)<br/>
   <br/>

&gt;    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would recommend a DS because you don&#39;t have to use both screens and <br/>
actually CAN&#39;T use both screens when playing the older games.  My 8 year old still <br/>
has an SP and loves it, easy to use, etc.  BUT if I were to buy again it would <br/>
be the DS as it will allow them to grow into as well.  It has a lot of <br/>
capabilities that can be used later.  And all the previous games can be used on it <br/>
too.  So if you have some Gameboy Color games you can use those on the SP or DS.  <br/>
If you want fewer bells and whistles, get the SP.  What does your child want <br/>
it for?  Let them choose.  If they want to have the touch screen cuz they want <br/>
to interact with say, the Nintendogs, then get that.  The stylus feature is <br/>
cool too.  But the SP is great for gamers who just want simple and fun games <br/>
without a stylus and all that.  Pop it in your pocket and go.  <br/>
<br/>
As for a console, what is your family into?  If your child(ren) enjoy playing <br/>
together and you like bright and fun games-the Gamecube has a better library <br/>
for that.  Darker,  more adult type games-Xbox, something that does it all and <br/>
is backward compatible-meaning it can play games from older <br/>
systems-Playstation 2.  They all have great games but some games are exclusive to each system.<br/>
<br/>
Our family has just begun to get into games (Daddy and I have always played <br/>
but now our 4.5 and 8 year old are getting into it too) so it has been a fun, <br/>
family time.<br/>

The thing that would swing me towards the last generation Gameboy, the GB Advance is that they&#39;re the last generation handheld and so can be bought pretty cheap. The games are often marked down in stores and likely you&#39;ll find games in the buy and sell papers and pawn shops and such because they&#39;ll be sold by kids wanting to buy the newest one. If money&#39;s not an object though the DS is really cool. <br/>

They have a lot more titles for younger kids then PS2 or XBox or XBoz 360 and if you have Pokemon fans they&#39;re the only console with rights to those games. They&#39;re also just about obsolete and there have been some great deals around on the consoles and games. The next generation Nintendo system is still at least 6 months away from release though it will be backwards compatible and play Game Cube games. But it will likely be pretty expensive too. <br/>
<br/>
  Regardless, this is a great time to purchase new last generation consoles. We&#39;re in the perfect time where most of the consoles are just about obsolete and makers are clearing them out in anticipation of the next version and people who own the older ones will be selling the consoles and games to make money to buy them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-644301683">We&#39;ve had both GBA and GBA SP and DS prefers the SP - the backlit <br/>
screen is much easier to manage in all sorts of lighting conditions. <br/>
The GBA has an add-on separate light piece but that was a real pain to <br/>
deal with, even for us grown ups. Also, something to consider is hand <br/>
size for handhelds - when both Dh and DS held the Nintendo DS, it just <br/>
didn&#39;t fit their hands right - DH was squashed and DS had to stretch <br/>
awkwardly to reach some of the controls. <br/>
<br/>
So, you might consider going to a gaming place where you can actually <br/>
get your hands around each one you are considering.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also got a PS2 - DS really liked some of the games available for <br/>
it so that&#39;s what we went with (of course this is after I told DH &quot;How <br/>
about we get a gaming system for your birthday?&quot; and he said &quot;Sounds <br/>
great. What did you do with my wife?&quot; - I had been pretty anti-video <br/>
game based on DH&#39;s prior relationships with them but it&#39;s changed now).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817020925">-The DS is not ANY more difficult to play.  You don&#39;t actually play on <br/>
the top screen, just the bottom.  We just got 2 for Christmas, and my <br/>
girls are loving Nintendogs and Animal Crossing.  I have played the <br/>
old style gameboy as well as the SP, and the lighting is so much <br/>
better on the DS.  I often had a hard time seeing the screens well in <br/>
certain lighting.<br/>
<br/>
-We also have a Gamecube and a PS2.  We use the Gamecube much more, <br/>
and besides it&#39;s cheaper.  You can get a new one, sometimes with game <br/>
included, for $99.  <br/>

SPs without missing the uber potential of the DS, most of which they&#39;d <br/>
likely not take advantage of at this stage of the game. We chose (2 mos <br/>
before the DS was released) to buy 3 SPs at the newly reduced rate <br/>
because the DS was about to come out rather than waiting and buying the <br/>
more expensive DS. We figure the kids will drive their SPs into the <br/>
ground, and by the time their ready for an upgrade, there will likely be <br/>
a new one out anyway and we&#39;ll just skip a generation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I *LOVE* Hannah&#39;s new DS!!!  She&#39;s 9 and she&#39;s had a Gameboy Advanced <br/>
for a couple of years, but this is a great handheld system :)  Okay, <br/>
I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m terrifically excited because I&#39;ve discovered a new love <br/>
of games &lt;bwg&gt;  The stylus is the ticket for me!!  I&#39;ve not played many <br/>
games, the buttons intimidate me... but Yoshi Touch and Go is my new <br/>
favorite video game (though all time is Centipede - 1 button, 1 roller <br/>
&lt;g&gt;). <br/>
<br/>
We started with PS, then PS2, which we&#39;ve enjoyed for a few years.  We <br/>
just got a Game Cube at Xmas and that&#39;s a whole different kind of fun -- <br/>
there are many exclusive games for Game Cube.  We&#39;re hoping to pick up a <br/>
cheap XBox when the 360 glitches get worked out and there&#39;s a mass <br/>
dumping of the original &lt;g&gt; Hayden, 7, has really enjoyed his chances to <br/>
play Halo 2 and wants his own.  He&#39;s even willing to pay for xBox Live <br/>
to play with friends! <br/>
<br/>
I pop into pawnshops & mom and pop music/game stores, they&#39;re usually a <br/>
cheap source for used systems & games. <br/>
