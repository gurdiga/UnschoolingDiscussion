<div id="ygrps-yiv-530787472">&quot;Through my behavior to him his whole life, I have<br/>
wanted him to learn that making a mistake is no big deal; that almost<br/>
all mistakes can be corrected; that he has the know-how to correct<br/>
them, and that we will help him as well; that he will not lose our<br/>
affection or respect by making mistakes. Woo-hoo!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I loved reading this Su.<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m healing myself as a child, when I help my children <br/>
feel empowered after making a mistake, instead of smaller. <br/>
Thanks for sharing that.<br/>

SCA camping, and he was in the mountains or on uneven ground lots.   Walking <br/>
on tent floors, or rugs on lumpy ground.   Tricky.<br/>
<br/>
When he would fall, after we comforted him or helped him up, we would take <br/>
him back and show him what it was that he tripped on or ran into.   When we <br/>
would go to a new place, house, wherever, we&#39;d scope it out and point out to him <br/>
things like the corners of tables so he could be careful.   By the time the <br/>
other kids came along, Kirby was doing that same thing for them, very patiently <br/>
and sweetly, because he thought that&#39;s just how people WERE with babies.   <br/>
<br/>
All three of my kids really like younger kids and all plan to have children <br/>
(though I try to talk them out of it, lightly, and tell them only to have <br/>
children if they couldn&#39;t stand not to), and I think the&#39;d all make great parents.<br/>
