<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719252784">I am really concerned for my son&#39;s will to learn some things and to<br/>
accept challenges without being told.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is the situation.  He is 13, and we started homeschooling in Feb.<br/>
of this year.  He attended traditional public school until the 4th<br/>
grade, then moved to a charter school for the 5th and 6th grade.  The<br/>
charter school was a good move in a lot of ways, but not without<br/>
problems.  My son is a very visual learner and the school incorperated<br/>
art into the core subjects which gave him other ways to &quot;see&quot; the<br/>
information.  The classes were 15 or less and thy always had an art<br/>
assistant assigned to help the instructor.  It worked quite well for<br/>
him, but lack of funding and lack of discipline is killing this<br/>
school.  It has become the county wide dumping ground for problem<br/>
students and has become quite rough because of it.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to move to a location outside the metro Atlanta area this<br/>
past summer, which put Nick (my son) in a very large Jr. High school.<br/>
At the same time, he decided he wanted to join the football team,<br/>
which has been a dream of his for a while.  We agreed, he tried out<br/>
and made the team.  The understanding was that practice would be 4<br/>
nights a week for the first few weeks before school started and then<br/>
would go to 2 nights a week after.  This did not happen, and we stayed<br/>
on a 4 night a week practice schedule (from 6:00 pm until 8:30 pm)<br/>
with a game on Saturday.  I asked my son to quit as this was to much,<br/>
but he really wanted to keep going.  This proved to be to much for<br/>
him, as I thought it would.  Not only was he in a great deal of shock<br/>
from returning to &quot;regular&quot; classes, but he had no time for a life.<br/>
He ran home from school did homework, went to practice, then straight<br/>
to bed with barely time to eat or say hello to his friends or family.<br/>
By the time Sunday rolled around, he was so behind in his homework he<br/>
had to spend the day working on that and still had no free time.n He<br/>
started having trouble sleeping in September and again, I wanted him<br/>
to quit the team.  He was insistant that he wanted to continue and my<br/>
husband reluctantly agreed.  HIs grades were really bad, as would be<br/>
expected, but his teaching team agreed with him that removing him from<br/>
the team would not be good, since he wanted it so badly.  He started<br/>
missing school because he was not feeling well most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
In November he developed daily migrain type headaches and had to leave<br/>
the team.  He started missing school 2 or 3 days a week and when he<br/>
was able to attend his headaches were so bad he could not participate<br/>
in class.  We went to a total of 7 physicians and 1 psychologist<br/>
trying to determine the cause of the headaches.  I will not even begin<br/>
to tell you what we all went through here, but school became a very<br/>
small priority to us.  Football was out, and Nick did not even argue<br/>
about it.  (thankfully)  By the end of January my son, who has always<br/>
been an A/B student was failing the 7th grade and we were thinking of<br/>
homeschooling as an aletrnative.  During this time, the school tested<br/>
my son for learning disabilities and discovered he has some reading<br/>
and language problems, not surprising to me, he was almost totally a<br/>
visual learner, and also that he was suffering a great deal from<br/>
stress.  We all decided that homeschool would best serve his needs and<br/>
with the school&#39;s blessing, we took him out of school.<br/>
<br/>
I have been considering homeschooling and have done a good deal of<br/>
reading because before we found the charter school, my son was<br/>
starting to have a good deal of trouble in school.  I knew it was not<br/>
going to work for him to give him a lot of books to read and expect<br/>
him to learn, he can not do that very well at all.  I started looking<br/>
in to several options, and decided to unschool, hoping he would take<br/>
this as an opportunity to do things his way.  I have not pressured him<br/>
a great deal about it so far, but am concerned that he is not real<br/>
willing to do much more than play games.  (computer and D&D type roll<br/>
play)  This is all he talks about and all he wants to do.  He has<br/>
always been very quick at math, but he will not look at math at the<br/>
moment.  I asked him to figure a tip for me at a restaraunt Sunday and<br/>
he could not even do that.  It is like he has forgotten all he knows<br/>
on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
He will write, however, to some extent.  He is playing in a game with<br/>
a friend&#39;s family and the kids get extra experience if the journal<br/>
their character&#39;s life outside the game.  He has written one paper and<br/>
is working on the second.  They are not extensive, but they are<br/>
something.  Of course, they take him forever to accomplish due to his<br/>
problems.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I have no idea of how to help him with his learning problems.  I<br/>
am not really a good teacher, I lose patience and focus a lot and am<br/>
very disorganized.  My husband would be great, but he is away from<br/>
home enough that he is really unable to participate.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been following this list for some time, but was waiting for all<br/>
the &quot;discussion&quot; to calm down before I approached you with questions.<br/>
I really did not want to fan the flames any further.  <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated.  How do you motivate a teen?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Jane,<br/>
<br/>
Well my first thought is to give him more time.  He needs to just <br/>
decompress after an experience like that.  With our exchange student, <br/>
I&#39;ve found that sports has become a major pet peeve of mine about the <br/>
schooles.  Vaidas was on the B-Ball team and quit because his grades <br/>
were falling.  Now he&#39;s in Tennis and it&#39;s the same thing all over <br/>
again.  Practice or matches every night.  The only day off is Sunday. <br/>
 It sucketh!<br/>
<br/>
But back to your son, he really needs some time to unwind and allow <br/>
the headaches to become a distant memory.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but am concerned that he is not real<br/>
&gt; willing to do much more than play games.  <br/>
&gt; (computer and D&D type roll<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s playing D&D he&#39;s getting math.  But beyond that, don&#39;t even <br/>
worry about it right now.  When he needs it he&#39;ll learn it.  D&D has <br/>
also led my girls into a lot of stuff about medieval history <br/>
(mostly the weaponry) and folklore in general.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have to know more about the learning problems to help with that, <br/>
but for the most part, I think a lot of the stuff the schools worry <br/>
about can be safely ignored IRL.<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas for you: <br/>
Talk to him a lot.  Ask him what kind of things he&#39;s interested in, <br/>
where he&#39;d like to go.  Then find things that match that you can do.<br/>
<br/>
Find other unschoolers and homeschoolers in your area that he can <br/>
relate to.  This may take some time and effort.  I&#39;ve been looking for <br/>
7 years and only just this year found exactly what we wanted.  But the <br/>
search was worth it and was an adventure in and of itself.  My girls <br/>
learned a lot obout individuality in the process and are quite content <br/>
with who they are.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t push the reading thing.  My ds HATED reading, until he found out <br/>
he could read books about motors and trains and stuff.  Now he loves <br/>
reading best of all.  So explore that avenue a little, maybe get some <br/>
role playing game manuals and stuff like that for him to read.  But <br/>
don&#39;t present them as reading material.  Present them as an <br/>
extenuation of his interests.<br/>

always been very quick at math, but he will not look at math at the<br/>
moment.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That IS math.  D&D dice games involve a ton of math.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I asked him to figure a tip for me at a restaraunt Sunday and<br/>
he could not even do that.  It is like he has forgotten all he knows<br/>
on the subject.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You tested him on 15%?<br/>
It would have been more productive for you to figure the tip aloud in front <br/>
of him.  And I hope you didn&#39;t expect him to do a whole formulaic process to <br/>
get the tip, other than 10% plus half of that amount, if you DID press him <br/>
about 15%.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They are not extensive, but they are<br/>
something.  Of course, they take him forever to accomplish due to his<br/>
problems.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Try looking at what is instead of what isn&#39;t.  He IS writing.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take him &quot;forever.&quot;  &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;never&quot; and &quot;forever&quot; are <br/>
depressing words, and don&#39;t open a door for &quot;now&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any suggestions would be appreciated.  How do you motivate a teen?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How do you motivate a mom?  Motivating him to &quot;study&quot; shouldn&#39;t be the goal.<br/>
Learning with him, providing him opportunities for easy, visual learning and <br/>
companionship with you while it&#39;s happening will be your most valuable tool <br/>
while you (the mom) begin to really see how natural learning can work.<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation is to watch at least one video a day, together if possible. <br/>
 Let him watch it again all he wants, or none.  Rewind if you miss a line.  <br/>
Watch the best scenes twice.  Don&#39;t &quot;test&quot; or do anything schoolish.  <br/>
<br/>
Every day, watch a video.  Let one lead to another, by actor or subject, or <br/>
by time period or genre.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s only been out two months.  Deschooling is usually &quot;prescribed&quot; as one <br/>
month per year of school.  Don&#39;t expect him to have recovered from school <br/>
until he&#39;s been doing something different for nine months.   <br/>
<br/>
But it will speed the process if you stop talking about school, stop talking <br/>
about &quot;subject matter,&quot; stop measuring and poking and checking him every day <br/>
or two.  <br/>
<br/>
If a cake&#39;s going to be in the oven for 45 minutes, it does NO good (and in <br/>
fact does harm) to start opening the oven and sticking toothpicks in it at <br/>
five minutes, seven minutes, ten minutes, twelve minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Leave him alone about school.<br/>
But enrich his life with thought-expanding input.  <br/>
<br/>
On the movies, they don&#39;t have to be classic stories, either.  Maybe the 100 <br/>
top movies of all time (a list that came out a few years back) would be a <br/>
starting place.  Or maybe your video store has an Academy Award section.   <br/>
But you could go for any kind of theme or experimental pattern.  Holly&#39;s <br/>
liking musicals from the 1930s and has become a big Judy Garland fan.  It&#39;s <br/>
fun to find &quot;first of&quot; things, like Willow had morphing (and the DVD has a <br/>
bit about how they did it).  One of the Sinbad movies from the 70&#39;s had <br/>
claymation (or some figure-animation) interacting with the characters.    You <br/>
could follow one actor, or focus on war movies for a while, or stuff about <br/>
Rome.   <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t treat it as a chore, treat it as a vacation!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410731103">Jane, your son needs a period known as &quot;deschooling.&quot;  This is where you<br/>
learn to relax and not worry and he gets to get to know himself instead of<br/>
what some school official was telling him.  He may do absolutely nothing at<br/>
first, he may veg in front of the tv or he may get lost in video games.<br/>
This WILL pass and he will become interesting in &quot;things&quot; and &quot;stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If he worries about &quot;learning&quot; things, tell him not to worry.  Most people<br/>
learn more outside of school than all the stuff they have forgotten from<br/>
school!<br/>
<br/>
Read some books about unschooling, Mary Griffith and John Holt are<br/>
excellent.<br/>
<br/>
As to sports, Pop Warner football is an option instead of going to a ps to<br/>
play football.<br/>

quite long, sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370565219">Hi Jane<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He is 13, and we started homeschooling in Feb.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It could take months for him to &quot;deschool&quot;, to recover from school.  The<br/>
more you understand unschooling the more you&#39;ll see how mind and spirit<br/>
numbing school is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have been considering homeschooling and have done a good deal of<br/>
reading because before we found the charter school, my son was<br/>
starting to have a good deal of trouble in school.  I knew it was not<br/>
going to work for him to give him a lot of books to read and expect<br/>
him to learn, he can not do that very well at all.  I started looking<br/>
in to several options, and decided to unschool, hoping he would take<br/>
this as an opportunity to do things his way.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The key element of successful unschooling is trusting your child.  Trust<br/>
that they can and will learn.  Learning is like breathing, can&#39;t be<br/>
stopped.  My opinion is that a majority of the time spent &quot;deschooling&quot;<br/>
is the child testing the parents, &quot;Are they REALLY gonna let me do this?&quot;<br/>
 Who can blame them for resenting and even fighting against being forced<br/>
and judged by the school system?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have not pressured him<br/>
a great deal about it so far, but am concerned that he is not real<br/>
willing to do much more than play games.  (computer and D&D type roll<br/>
play)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As long as we see books and lessons as learning we miss the value gained<br/>
in other activities.  If you&#39;re able to truly see the value in what he IS<br/>
doing you&#39;ll be able to let go of the old ideas.  Math, science,<br/>
language, etc. are all tools and to be used for our purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I tell my daughter to follow her passions and use whatever tools she<br/>
needs to do so.  One of her passions is Pokemon card game play and for<br/>
this she uses math, logic, strategy, language, reading and discipline. <br/>
Because she uses these tools in way they are allies and friendly thus she<br/>
is more confident in using them in other and new passions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is all he talks about and all he wants to do.  He has<br/>
always been very quick at math, but he will not look at math at the<br/>
moment.  I asked him to figure a tip for me at a restaurant Sunday and<br/>
he could not even do that.  It is like he has forgotten all he knows<br/>
on the subject.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In school things like math become a chore, knowledge with no purpose<br/>
except but being regurgitated for testing.  My daughter can do complex<br/>
calculations for her real life endeavors but if they were put on paper<br/>
and tested she would freeze up.  It may take time for your son to see<br/>
math as a friendly tool.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately your son&#39;s learning problems belong to him and he will learn<br/>
how to find ways to compensate.  A friend with dyslexia, after years of<br/>
struggling in the &quot;school&quot; way,  finally taught himself to read and study<br/>
in his late teens and managed to graduate college with a master&#39;s degree.<br/>
 Now I realize that most of us are capable of doing the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
My place as parent is to give support and demonstrate my faith in them. <br/>
When kids are given the message that they can&#39;t be trusted to learn they<br/>
usually rise no further than that.  My opinion is that this is the MAIN<br/>
problem with any school, kids are told when and how to learn and then<br/>
tested to make sure they are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-483856753">Hi Jane and welcome! It&#39;s great that you&#39;ve decided to check out unschooling <br/>
for your family. :o)<br/>
<br/>
After reading your post about your wonderful son and his painfully stressful <br/>
experiences, my first suggestion is to ::::::::breathe:::::::::: Take a <br/>
moment, a day, a week, a month....and just breathe, relax, and get used to <br/>
the idea of this new life WITHOUT school.<br/>
<br/>
I remember very well what it was like to be on the school&#39;s timetable. I <br/>
remember thinking that if my son didn&#39;t learn it on *their* schedule, he was <br/>
behind, or disabled or just NOT going to be able to succeed, ever. The good <br/>
news is, though, that I have discovered how wrong my thinking was. :o)<br/>
<br/>
A standard piece of homeschooling/unschooling advice is to take awhile to <br/>
&quot;deschool&quot; when your child first comes home. This is a time where you don&#39;t <br/>
think about school or subjects or required learning or learning disabilities <br/>
or anything of that sort. It&#39;s a time to reconnect with your son. Use it to <br/>
go to movies, read what you like and share it with your son, go to a cool <br/>
play, take a trip, browse online, play D&D together....anything that helps <br/>
you shake off the school stress and get to know each other without all that <br/>
baggage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Also, I have no idea of how to help him with his learning problems. I am <br/>
&gt;&gt;not really a good teacher, I lose patience and focus a lot and am<br/>
 </span></blockquote>very disorganized.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about teaching as much as it is about learning. You don&#39;t <br/>
need to teach your son what he wants to learn about. But you can help him <br/>
find his way to learn. There are mentors and classes and apprenticeships and <br/>
computer programs and museum docents and artists and all sorts of community <br/>
resources that are out there once you open yourself up to look for them. :o) <br/>
You are not alone and do not have to do it/know it all.<br/>
<br/>
AHhhhh...big relief. And after a good healthy period of deschooling, your <br/>
son will start opening up more and following his own passions and interests <br/>
and goals. I think the things he is doing now sound great, and I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
worry that he&#39;s not learning. There&#39;s so much to learn at every corner and <br/>
your son is taking it all in. Right now. Just playing. Promise. I have seen <br/>
it happen in my own kids and lots of others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;How do you motivate a teen?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Listen to him. Give him time to find his interests again. Don&#39;t expect his <br/>
learning to look like school.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is lucky to have you looking out for him. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

not &quot;regular&quot; school things.  I have some computer games that I have<br/>
found that are great teaching tools, and I am letting him veg a bit.<br/>
I have, however, limited some of his TV viewing.  I told him that<br/>
cartoons all day are not a good thing and that he should tune in the<br/>
Discover stations more.  he enjoys them a lot, I think he just forgets<br/>
thay are there.  <br/>
<br/>
We are also reading together and playing &quot;Diablo&quot; in multi player mode<br/>
together a lot.  He plays D&D regularly with firends, but we do not<br/>
have a big enough group yet to play here in the new neighborhood.  We<br/>
will soon, though.  Several of our home school group kids are<br/>
interested.  <br/>

want him to become addicted to the games like a couple of his friends<br/>
have.  It is all they think about and it is, IMHO, not a healthy thing<br/>
for a kid.  <br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; (computer and D&D type roll<br/>
&gt;play)  This is all he talks about and all he wants to do.  He has<br/>
&gt;always been very quick at math, but he will not look at math at the<br/>
&gt;moment.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That IS math.  D&D dice games involve a ton of math.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I know that.  I play myself.  The thing I worry about is that he<br/>
was able to figure a tip for us on the fly last year with no problem<br/>
and now he seems to have forgotten how, even the simple things like<br/>
figuring ten percent.  He has always been really great with math and<br/>
loved the subject.  Math and Science, art photography and drame are<br/>
his favorite subjects.  He just seems to have lost ground.  Maybe it<br/>
is just decompressing from all the stress, but it is worrysome to me<br/>
and my husband.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;problems.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Try looking at what is instead of what isn&#39;t.  He IS writing.<br/>
&gt;It doesn&#39;t take him &quot;forever.&quot;  &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;never&quot; and &quot;forever&quot; are <br/>
&gt;depressing words, and don&#39;t open a door for &quot;now&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am very happy that he is writing.  I look at his work and do not<br/>
correct it unless he asks me to.  I leave him to do this as he wants<br/>
and to feel the joy in doing so.  He is very proud of what he is<br/>
working on, and that is good.  I just have personal concerns for<br/>
helping him learn to express himself better in a written form.  He<br/>
wants to go to college and become an architect.  He is going to need<br/>
to be able to write to do this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do you motivate a mom?  Motivating him to &quot;study&quot; shouldn&#39;t be the goal.<br/>
&gt;Learning with him, providing him opportunities for easy, visual learning and <br/>
&gt;companionship with you while it&#39;s happening will be your most valuable tool <br/>
&gt;while you (the mom) begin to really see how natural learning can work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He loves the computer and games, so I am buying what I can find in<br/>
game format for him.  I have found an algebra game that he enjoys and<br/>
a friend has loande me &quot;Zoombinis&quot; stuff that we both love.  I need to<br/>
find a copy of this we can keep!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;My recommendation is to watch at least one video a day, together if possible. <br/>
&gt; Let him watch it again all he wants, or none.  Rewind if you miss a line.  <br/>
&gt;Watch the best scenes twice.  Don&#39;t &quot;test&quot; or do anything schoolish.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do a lot of this kind of thing already.  He and I are both movie<br/>
people and he is interested in acting, so movies are great.  We also<br/>
watch a lot of specials on Discover and TLC together.  We discuss<br/>
them, and try to connect what we saw with other things we know from<br/>
other media, but I do not test him.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He&#39;s only been out two months.  Deschooling is usually &quot;prescribed&quot; as one <br/>
&gt;month per year of school.  Don&#39;t expect him to have recovered from school <br/>
&gt;until he&#39;s been doing something different for nine months.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe by the fall......<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;But it will speed the process if you stop talking about school, stop talking <br/>
&gt;about &quot;subject matter,&quot; stop measuring and poking and checking him every day <br/>
&gt;or two.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hear that.  I will try to follow and to get my husband to do so as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you and others who have taken the time to respond to me.  I<br/>
am happy to have someone who is listning. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973419638">Sorry to take so long to respond to you.  This has been a very busy<br/>
week!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Well my first thought is to give him more time.  He needs to just <br/>
&gt;decompress after an experience like that.  With our exchange student, <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve found that sports has become a major pet peeve of mine about the <br/>
&gt;schooles.  Vaidas was on the B-Ball team and quit because his grades <br/>
&gt;were falling.  Now he&#39;s in Tennis and it&#39;s the same thing all over <br/>
&gt;again.  Practice or matches every night.  The only day off is Sunday. <br/>
&gt; It sucketh!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. Sports have become such a focus and it is not productive to<br/>
society, IMHO.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;But back to your son, he really needs some time to unwind and allow <br/>
&gt;the headaches to become a distant memory.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This much I do know, and I am willing to give him that.  I am just<br/>
looking at next fall and how to prepare.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;If he&#39;s playing D&D he&#39;s getting math.  But beyond that, don&#39;t even <br/>
&gt;worry about it right now.  When he needs it he&#39;ll learn it.  D&D has <br/>
&gt;also led my girls into a lot of stuff about medieval history <br/>
&gt;(mostly the weaponry) and folklore in general.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love D&D and roll play.  My husband and I play and my son grew up<br/>
with this in his life.  I was happy that he loves it as much as I do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d have to know more about the learning problems to help with that, <br/>
&gt;but for the most part, I think a lot of the stuff the schools worry <br/>
&gt;about can be safely ignored IRL.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He seems to have a problem processing information he reads and he can<br/>
not express himself in written form very well.  Language stuff just<br/>
does not &quot;click&quot; for him.  He has expressed a desire to go to college<br/>
many times and wants to be an archetect or possibly a psychologist.<br/>
for either profession he will need to read well and be able to write<br/>
clearly.  I just do not want this to be a wall he cannot climb.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Other ideas for you: <br/>
&gt;Talk to him a lot.  Ask him what kind of things he&#39;s interested in, <br/>
&gt;where he&#39;d like to go.  Then find things that match that you can do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do, he never wants to go out of the house unless it is to see his<br/>
friends.  I can&#39;t seem to get him interested in doing much of<br/>
anything.  He does not like to read, so that is not a great way for<br/>
him to learn things either.  He can not live his whole life in our<br/>
house in front of the computer or playing his games with friends.<br/>
Left to his own, this is what he will do, however.  We have joined a<br/>
homeschool group and we are starting to plan field trips, so this will<br/>
help.  He is willing to go to these as the others are going as well.<br/>
None of these families unschool, though.  They are trying to talk me<br/>
out of the concept but I do not think that what they are doing would<br/>
be good for my son.  I may as well put him back in school if I am<br/>
going to buy him mountains of books and expect him to learn from them.<br/>
The only problem with the group is the &quot;normal&quot; teen stuff is going<br/>
on.  This one has a crush on that one, this that one has a crush on<br/>
someone else, and so on.  The moms are stressing this like mad,<br/>
wanting to forbid boy-girl things within the group.  I think that<br/>
although we do need to watch what is going on, we also need to stay<br/>
out of it.  They need to learn to deal with each other. I also think<br/>
that by forbidding them to say they like this one or that one, we only<br/>
make it more attractive.  It&#39;s not like they are doing any more than<br/>
talking.  They are 12-15 years old.  This is the way 12-15 year old<br/>
kids are.  Of course, I have a boy.........<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the suggestions.  I wish I could find an unschooling<br/>
family near here. <br/>

because I was in school and I didn&#39;t fit in.  In an effort to fit in, <br/>
