<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054607960">Not a homeschooler / unschooler.  Just gathering information at this <br/>

work to deadlines?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did it take you 12 years of school and four years of college to be able to <br/>
meet your deadlines? Did you need to be &quot;trained&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
LIFE has deadlines; and as unschoolers, we deal with the &quot;natural <br/>
consequences&quot; of a normal life. I&#39;m putting on a conference. It can&#39;t happen <br/>
overnight. I have to do things incrementally over a year to get there. I&#39;m <br/>
gardening. I have to shove things in the ground after frost and before the <br/>
heat of SC sets in to grow anything---and tend them all summer to expect to <br/>
eat fresh tomatoes and cukes. I plan to have supper on the table each evening <br/>
(or not! &lt;g&gt;). I&#39;m training a dog to be able to show by fall--the deadline is <br/>
set because the shows are already planned. Pool&#39;s got to be acid washed <br/>
before we can swim in it this spring; finshed that yesterday and am filling <br/>
it with water now. I have David Albert coming in to speak Friday afternoon: I <br/>
have my &quot;to do&quot; lists (three or four of them!) bouncing around here so that I <br/>
can meet the deadline of the 4:00 talk. I have an MNO tonight---I need to <br/>
have more flyers for the Albert talks printed up to hand out by 6:30 this <br/>
evening. <br/>
<br/>
My 15 year old son has his first job working in a deli. He is incredibly &quot;on <br/>
time&quot;, conscientious, and dependable. He didn&#39;t learn that by so many years <br/>
in school writing papers and doing science projects. He&#39;s seen his parents be <br/>
&quot;on time&quot;, conscientious, and dependable. He WANTS to be those things as <br/>
well. And so he is.     His passions are music and filming. Neither have <br/>
&quot;deadlines&quot;. But he DID work really hard on a screenplay to have it finished <br/>
in time for his friends to learn their lines in order to begin filming.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re creating artificial deadlines in order to TRAIN our children, we&#39;re <br/>
&quot;playing&quot; with them (and I don&#39;t mean that in a good way!). There are natural <br/>
deadlines to be met in a normal everyday life. Children NATURALLY pick up on <br/>
things they want to do and steps they need to take to get there. The &quot;natural <br/>
consequence&quot; would be that it doesn&#39;t happen. If he wants to swim in the <br/>
upcoming swim meet and he doesn&#39;t get his entry in by the deadline, he <br/>
doesn&#39;t get to swim---natural consequence of not meeting his deadline. If he <br/>
wants to prepare an authentic Japanese supper, he&#39;ll need to start preparing <br/>
early enough to buy and cut up and cook in stages throughout the day <br/>
or---natural consequence: his guests will get too hungry and go OUT for <br/>
supper! <br/>
<br/>
A child may need to be reminded that he needs to get that entry in by a <br/>
certain date or that he needs to get to the asian market before 2:00---but <br/>
he&#39;ll get to the point he can do it on his own. WE have no deadline to have <br/>
our kids &quot;ready&quot; to be on their own, answering to some boss. There&#39;s no <br/>
magical age that he&#39;s got to be able to meet deadlines. And school&#39;s <br/>
artificial project deadlines don&#39;t help with that. LIFE does---and the more <br/>
NATURAL deadlines he can experience, the better he&#39;ll be able to deal with <br/>
them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One problem with the workplace is that the worker is often excluded from the <br/>
information that would make deadlines obvious and not arbitrary.  When a boss <br/>
hands a worker an assignment, the worker may have little idea or input into <br/>
where his work fits into the larger picture.  People who have a good grasp of <br/>
how their piece of the puzzle fits in can see deadlines, and can meet them <br/>
more easily, because the logic of them is obvious.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids set their own deadlines. Or, they have the freedom to seek <br/>
information they need to see the logic in other people&#39;s deadlines.  If they <br/>
don&#39;t think the deadline is doable, they&#39;re more likely (IMO) to try and <br/>
change it or to ask the other people to consider other ideas.  If the <br/>
homeschooler&#39;s theater has it&#39;s performance set for May 10, and first <br/>
rehearsal is April 1, an unschooler can see that it would be best to know <br/>
their lines by then.<br/>
<br/>
I personally wouldn&#39;t work at a job where I couldn&#39;t see or didn&#39;t have <br/>
access to the big picture.  I&#39;ve done plenty of grunt jobs, so it&#39;s not about <br/>
being in charge.  I perform better when I have a complete grasp of it, and <br/>
some control over what my part is and how I get it done.  (&quot;Punished by <br/>
Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn has a good section on that.)   I can&#39;t see any of the <br/>
unschooled kids I know going into a job without a secondary goal in mind...it <br/>
being a means to an end (spending money, new car, tuition), or &quot;paying their <br/>
dues&quot; in a field they love, or gaining experience to work for themselves.  <br/>
Unschooling gave them that ability, because most of them have been operating <br/>
on that principle since they were little.  <br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling makes better, happier workers.  They might cause trouble <br/>
for the establishment by challenging everything, but that&#39;s a GOOD thing.  :)<br/>

Then the only thing to motivate him is fear of punishment or hope for a good grade -- external control, which is very similar to many work environments. Is that why so many people spend 8 hours a day (one-third of their lives!) doing as little work as possible in jobs they don&#39;t like? <br/>

is music and drama, and he is a member of a chorus, etc. He also likes to <br/>
take the occasional class or workshop. He often has situations where there <br/>
are deadlines: plays for which he needs to memorize lines or concerts for <br/>
which he needs to learn songs, a class where he needs to have something read, <br/>
etc. <br/>
<br/>
He does those things because he knows it&#39;s important to get the result he <br/>
wants. He memorizes lines for a play because he has a committment to the <br/>
other people. You don&#39;t need to go to school to learn about the importance of <br/>
meeting deadlines -- you just have to have a life. <br/>

<br/>
  Exactly. With unschooling mine kids learn, are self motivated to give all they got to an activity. I have seen this happen. When they immerse in something they have perserverance and focus like I&#39;ve never seen or experienced myself. I think this comes from having unimpeded time and having the freedom to go their own directional interest. I think life provides us with the lesson of having to do things we don&#39;t like all the time. I don&#39;t think when they are little that we need to teach them this.When my people choose to do something they either accept the deadlines that come with it or they get creative and find an acceptable alternative.<br/>

<br/>
My  kids have never been to school, but they have never missed deadlines.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is 16 and has a job.  I just heard him get out of the shower.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
wake him up.  He will come down and make sure I&#39;m up.   He must be considered <br/>
responsible, because he&#39;s had the same job since they offered it to him just <br/>
before he turned 14.  It&#39;s a retail games store.  He works with customers, <br/>
with cash, stock, teaches games, organizes league play and tournaments.  He <br/>
meets deadlines fine, even though he never practiced on make-believe <br/>
deadlines for homework.<br/>
<br/>
The same son goes on trips to conventions  and camping trips sometimes with <br/>
others.   He gets me to help him checklist whether he&#39;s thought of <br/>
everything, but he has never made people late nor forgotten anything crucial.<br/>
<br/>
He also teaches karate on Tuesdays (part of his own training is to teach <br/>
lower-level students) and has only been late once in a year, and only called <br/>
in sick once in that year.  <br/>
<br/>
My second son is 14.  He made up a game he calls &quot;orc ball&quot; and has friends <br/>
come to play each week.  He sends out announcements on time, lets people know <br/>
which park, or whether it&#39;s cancelled.   I coordinate with him about snacks <br/>
and whether they&#39;re staying for videos (in which case the den has to be <br/>
cleaned up).<br/>
<br/>
Those things are MUCH more real and useful than a book report or research <br/>
paper which will only be read by the teacher (if that).<br/>
<br/>
Holly, at 11, is the most organized of all.  She plans her day the day <br/>
before, and has her clothes ready for various things (and often has two or <br/>
three different outfits per day).  She knows already what she&#39;s wearing to a <br/>
wedding May 17. She tried it all on yesterday and  showed me what needs to be <br/>
adjusted.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How do parents help homeschooled / unschooled <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How do parents whose kids are in school help them?<br/>
They say &quot;do your homework&quot; and &quot;get up and go to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The way I help my kids is that I know what they are doing and what they would <br/>
like to do, and we talk.  We discuss things quite a bit.   We remind each <br/>
other of upcoming commitments on anyone&#39;s part.  We keep a big calendar in <br/>
the kitchen where we write who has promised what.  But I don&#39;t have to do <br/>
these things for them.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had wanted to do a picnic in a park on May 2, but friends of hers have <br/>
a big dance performance that evening with afternoon prep, so she is very <br/>
maturely changing her plans to accommodate the people she wanted to have <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
My kids seem much more able to plan and and accomplish than I remember most <br/>
of my friends being when we were their ages.  We rarely even got <br/>
opportunities to try.<br/>

Oh right!  That&#39;s an example I forgot to give.  Holly was in a play, put on <br/>
by the city&#39;s theatre, but an all-homeschoolers&#39; session with daytime <br/>
rehearsals.<br/>
<br/>
Holly learned all her lines early, since she couldn&#39;t read and needed help.<br/>
As rehearsals went on, she learned everyone else&#39;s lines too.  Since they <br/>
were leaning on being able to read from scripts during rehearsals, they <br/>
weren&#39;t memorizing their lines.<br/>
<br/>
When the performance came two of the three main characters were Holly and her <br/>
best friend, who knew their lines.  The third didn&#39;t know his.  A couple of <br/>
times when it didn&#39;t matter, one of them said his line, and left the response <br/>
to him.  If he didn&#39;t catch it, the other of the girls would say the <br/>
response.  (Most of what they were doing was exposition or dialog that wasn&#39;t <br/>
at all character specific.)   If it made him mad, he didn&#39;t dare say so, <br/>
because he didn&#39;t know his part.<br/>
<br/>
But Holly was so disgusted with the others, she had no interest in the next <br/>
play they offered.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too bad.  Somehow she met deadlines TOO well?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672816177">I&#39;ve got something about deadlines from another point of view. My oldest,<br/>
Tara goes to school. Always has and with only one year to go, she will<br/>
finish. She has always hated deadlines in school. Always. No matter what it<br/>
was that she was &quot;supposed&quot; to have at a certain time, she never had it.<br/>
Homework, projects, supplies to bring in from home, even permission slips to<br/>
go on trips. It was always last minute, a day later, or just never in. She<br/>
suffered the natural consequences of school but it made no difference at<br/>
all. I tried then to ask, every day as to what she needed to have done. She<br/>
would &quot;forget&quot; to tell me. I would ask at school and that didn&#39;t work<br/>
either. I finally just let her have her way and deal with it. She did. It<br/>
was never done on time!<br/>
<br/>
Well she&#39;s had a great job now since Nov. A job that pays very well here and<br/>
she loves it. She loves the job and the people and doesn&#39;t want to go<br/>
elsewhere. She&#39;s never been later since she started. She works 5 days a week<br/>
and still goes to school. I never had to remind her of the time. When she<br/>
needs to work early on the weekend, she&#39;s up all by herself. They have even<br/>
called her last minute because they need her and she&#39;s there in a half an<br/>
hour. She still has some days when she&#39;s late to school and some days when<br/>
she doesn&#39;t go. She&#39;s never missed work or been late.<br/>
<br/>
Point to this story is that when kids are left to find their own interests,<br/>
whether that&#39;s school or not, they do what they need to do to make it work.<br/>
So being forced to meet deadlines doesn&#39;t work any better than not being<br/>
made to meet them. When and if the child puts themselves in a situation<br/>
where deadlines are necessary, and it&#39;s important to the child, then it&#39;s<br/>
not a problem at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552466821">-=- My question is, how do unschooled children learn to <br/>
work to deadlines?-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-As an outsider, it seems like part of the appeal of <br/>
 homeschooling / unschooling is allowing the children to direct their <br/>
own learning and to take the time needed to really grasp each <br/>
 subject, but does that create problems in adapting to the workplace <br/>
where having an adequate result on time often outweighs having a <br/>
 better result later? -=-<br/>
<br/>
My  kids have never been to school, but they have never missed deadlines.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is 16 and has a job.  I just heard him get out of the shower.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
wake him up.  He will come down and make sure I&#39;m up.   He must be considered <br/>
responsible, because he&#39;s had the same job since they offered it to him just <br/>
before he turned 14.  It&#39;s a retail games store.  He works with customers, <br/>
with cash, stock, teaches games, organizes league play and tournaments.  He <br/>
meets deadlines fine, even though he never practiced on make-believe <br/>
deadlines for homework.<br/>
<br/>
The same son goes on trips to conventions  and camping trips sometimes with <br/>
others.   He gets me to help him checklist whether he&#39;s thought of <br/>
everything, but he has never made people late nor forgotten anything crucial.<br/>
<br/>
He also teaches karate on Tuesdays (part of his own training is to teach <br/>
lower-level students) and has only been late once in a year, and only called <br/>
in sick once in that year.  <br/>
<br/>
My second son is 14.  He made up a game he calls &quot;orc ball&quot; and has friends <br/>
come to play each week.  He sends out announnd whether they&#39;re staying for <br/>
videos (in which case the den has to be cleaned up).<br/>
<br/>
Those things are MUCH more real and useful than a book report or research <br/>
paper which will only be read by the teacher (if that).<br/>
<br/>
Holly, at 11, is the most organized of all.  She plans her day the day <br/>
before, and has her clothes ready for various things (and often has two or <br/>
three different outfits per day).  She knows already what she&#39;s wearing to a <br/>
wedding May 17. She tried it all on yesterday and  showed me what needs to be <br/>
adjusted.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How do parents help homeschooled / unschooled <br/>
<br/>
children work to deadlines, if indeed it is even a consideration?-=-<br/>
<br/>
How do parents whose kids are in school help them?<br/>
They say &quot;do your homework&quot; and &quot;get up and go to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The way I help my kids is that I know what they are doing and what they would <br/>
like to do, and we talk.  We discuss things quite a bit.   We remind each <br/>
other of upcoming commitments on anyone&#39;s part.  We keep a big calendar in <br/>
the kitchen where we write who has promised what.  But I don&#39;t have to do <br/>
these things for them.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had wanted to do a picnic in a park on May 2, but friends of hers have <br/>
a big dance performance that evening with afternoon prep, so she is very <br/>
maturely changing her plans to accommodate the people she wanted to have <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
My kids seem much more able to plan and and accomplish than I remember most <br/>
of my friends being when we were their ages.  We rarely even got <br/>
opportunities to try.<br/>

I was actually having a conversation with a co-worker about this.<br/>
He has a good friend that is a professor at that college (you know Kelly, <br/>
they one you promoted at the conference) that is home/unschool friendly. Very <br/>
open, relaxed atmosphere where the students are very much in control of their <br/>
learning.<br/>
Anyway, he was saying that his friend taught a lot of homeschoolers that were <br/>
coming to the college. He had all good things to say about them EXCEPT the <br/>
fact that they found it a bit of a challenge to deal with deadlines at first.<br/>
His comment was &quot;big deal, they&#39;ll figure it out after the first few months&quot; <br/>
and apparently they did.<br/>
So it was a bit of a challenge for some of them, but like any smart person <br/>
does, they learn. I guess it was not a big deal at all and this professors <br/>
experience was that the self-taught and homeschooled students were WAY more <br/>
fun to work with.<br/>
They were so interested and self-directed.<br/>
I&#39;d say that isn&#39;t much to overcome if deadlines are the worst thing they <br/>
have to figure out!! And I bet some of them already have it figured out just <br/>
fine LONG before they go to college.<br/>
Not worth worrying about.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There&#39;s no magical age that he&#39;s got to be able to meet deadlines. And school&#39;s artificial project deadlines don&#39;t help with that.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In fact, it seems to me that artificial deadlines imposed in school can impede a child&#39;s natural tendency to do things constructively. 50-minute time periods, arbitrary deadlines, timed tests all encourage a child NOT to engage, NOT to get too interested or involved. Then the only thing to motivate him is fear of punishment or hope for a good grade -- external control, which is very similar to many work environments. Is that why so many people spend 8 hours a day (one-third of their lives!) doing as little work as possible in jobs they don&#39;t like? <br/>

some will buckle under and try to please but all will be damaged inside <br/>
by it to some degree. And this is what the schools do with subject <br/>
matter too. A little here, a little there until finding out what the <br/>
teacher wants and how to please them becomes the reward, not internal <br/>
satisfaction or enjoyment in the depth of the material learned.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786556007">From: &quot;Sandy Duggan&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:m-s_dugg@...">m-s_dugg@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My question is, how do unschooled children learn to<br/>
&gt;work to deadlines?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the real question is how do schooled children ever get to learn<br/>
this? All they&#39;re given is artificial and meaningless deadlines for which<br/>
there may or may not be a penalty for failing to prepare or meet the<br/>
deadline. I rarely did homework in school, or if I did, I did it on the bus.<br/>
Crammed for all the tests, regurgitated the knowledge and then wiped it from<br/>
my memory. Got all A&#39;s without learning a thing, the least of which being<br/>
how to actually prepare for a deadline. When I started my career and was<br/>
faced with real deadlines, I hadn&#39;t a clue about how to work towards them. I<br/>
tried to follow the same formula that had been successful for me in school,<br/>
only to find that in real life you can&#39;t procrastinate and then cram.<br/>
Unfortunately, where I worked (Microsoft) I found that this was often the<br/>
case with people coming out of school. Smart kids only knew how to<br/>
manipulate the system, they had no idea how to actually prepare. It was a<br/>
continual problem when I got into managing teams of people (as was<br/>
motivation, but that&#39;s another post :-)<br/>
<br/>
As for unschoolers learning how to work to deadlines. Mine so far have<br/>
learned in two ways:<br/>
<br/>
1) They learn from planning for things that they want to accomplish. For<br/>
instance, my son (then 5) held several plant sales last summer. He wanted<br/>
some large Lego sets and decided to earn his own money. So he had to acquire<br/>
supplies, plant seeds, and take cuttings ahead of time so that they had<br/>
plenty of time to grow into good sized plants to sell. Then before the sale,<br/>
he had to make signs, get money for change, decide on prices and put price<br/>
stickers on the plants, and borrow a card table to display his wares. He had<br/>
to get to the sale on time and set up. Of course, being as he&#39;s so young, I<br/>
helped with a lot of the logistics (driving, etc.) But he did a huge amount<br/>
of the work/preparation himself.<br/>
<br/>
2) They learn from our example. My kids constantly see me working with<br/>
deadlines. I train/prepare for triathlons. I write articles, I schedule<br/>
playdates and homeschool activities and put together the supplies ahead of<br/>
time. Last week it was &quot;Homeschool Hogwarts&quot;, we had our &quot;Sorting Hat<br/>
Ceremony&quot;. So I had to gather the stuff I needed to bring, reserve the hall,<br/>
make the food, etc. Since unschooled kids are an integral part of the every<br/>
day life of adults, they get an insider&#39;s view into how adults really do<br/>
plan for deadlines. Whether it&#39;s packing for a camping trip, or editing my<br/>
writing, my kids see what I&#39;m doing and I&#39;m sure they learn from it (they<br/>
also learn from my mistakes, of course. Like the time I didn&#39;t print out my<br/>
camping list and therefore forgot important things like silverware).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778815644">Thank you to all who replied to my question regarding how to teach <br/>
children to meet deadlines.  It sounds as if no specific effort is <br/>
required from the parents to teach this concept, which is <br/>
reassuring.  I especially agree with Kay who suggested that <br/>
artificial deadlines such as 50 minute class periods can work against <br/>
the learning process.  Your personal stories of how your children <br/>
develop such a strong sense of commitment on their own are <br/>
inspiring.  In fact, as I read through this list of mostly positive <br/>
experiences, I wonder if there is another segment of the <br/>
homeschooling / unschooling population that isn&#39;t represented here, <br/>
or if such experiences are generally normal?  Again -- as an outsider <br/>
and someone who basically felt my educational needs were met by the <br/>
public school system -- children self-directing their own learning <br/>
sure seems too good to be true, but I don&#39;t want to argue with <br/>
success.  Obviously, I&#39;m intrigued or I wouldn&#39;t be reading the <br/>
messages here.  I do have to say that becoming a parent for the first <br/>
time later in life and not having spent much time with babies and <br/>
toddlers, I am so amazed to watch the development process of my son.  <br/>
I don&#39;t try to teach him anything at this point (he&#39;s only three) <br/>
other than to brush his teeth, wash his hands, manners, and <br/>
other &#39;survival&#39; skills.  Of course, I&#39;d like to see his sense of <br/>
wonder last indefinitely, so we&#39;ll see; maybe I will join your ranks <br/>
someday . . . <br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re used to school, where everyone has to turn in a paper, and if <br/>
you&#39;re used to class averages, you might think that way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are over 1,000 people on this list.  A few chose to respond.  If <br/>
someone has a child who&#39;s never met a deadline, they won&#39;t likely bestir <br/>
themselves to tell everybody.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not to say that I think there are a lot of people who are <br/>
withholding bad stories, either.<br/>
<br/>
You will never, ever get statistics on homeschoolers because there&#39;s no way <br/>
to even tell who homeschools in an &quot;everyone turns in a paper&quot; way.  And the <br/>
vast majority of homeschoolers are doing some or all school-at-home and so <br/>
their patterns will be school patterns in many ways.<br/>
<br/>
The best you can hope for is what you got here.  You had a concern and people <br/>
showed you it&#39;s not a guaranteed or inevitable outcome.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Again -- as an outsider <br/>
<br/>
and someone who basically felt my educational needs were met by the <br/>
<br/>
public school system -- children self-directing their own learning <br/>
<br/>
sure seems too good to be true, but I don&#39;t want to argue with <br/>
<br/>
success. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Self-directing their own learning&quot; is a very stiff construct, and still <br/>
school-vision-based.  It seems each child will somehow unfold one day into <br/>
some sort of natural curriculum.  That&#39;s not how it works.<br/>
<br/>
What you can get with unschooling IF you let the child unfold like a flower, <br/>
like a tree, is children learning constantly and joyfully.  They don&#39;t direct <br/>
themselves.  They live.  You provide the yard, the good soil, the water, the <br/>
atmosphere, and you protect them from the cats and birds and lawnmowers and <br/>
crazy stomping people.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Of course, I&#39;d like to see his sense of <br/>
<br/>
wonder last indefinitely, so we&#39;ll see; maybe I will join your ranks <br/>
<br/>
someday . . . .&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I found that my own sense of wonder at my children&#39;s grown and learning <br/>
needed to be nourished and encouraged.  So I quit hanging around with any <br/>
other moms who were cynical or mean to or about children and gravitated <br/>
toward moms who were sweet and patient so I could be more like them.  And now <br/>
with kids who are 16, 14, and 11, I still have a sense of wonder at their <br/>
observational skills, their ideas about relationships and politics and how <br/>
teaching works (Holly is wanting to take a break from her fiddle lessons and <br/>
her teacher is baffled and using arguments that amuse Holly in an attempt to <br/>
guilt Holly into staying) and how people respond to them as opposed to how <br/>
they respond to &quot;schoolkids.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still deeply interested in their responses to music, movies and jokes.  I <br/>
was reading poetry to Holly last night and got really sleepy, but she asked <br/>
me to keep reading, so I walked and came back a little more awake and read <br/>
her to sleep.  That is interesting to me, too.<br/>
<br/>
So there is more two-way than a mom waiting to see a child self-direct.  It <br/>
starts sooner.  It is a bolstered relationship where the mom provides safety <br/>
and opportunity and input and freedom.  <br/>

many stories posted here of delightful, exuberant children turning into<br/>
pale shadows of themselves due to their K or 1st grade experiences. <br/>
It&#39;s doubtful that the child himself can remember the extinguishing<br/>
process, though.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;   In fact, as I read through this list of mostly positive <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; experiences, I wonder if there is another segment of the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; homeschooling / unschooling population that isn&#39;t represented here, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; or if such experiences are generally normal?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To underline what others have said, unschooling is different from homeschooling in general- I would imagine there are allot of kids who are &quot;homeschooled&quot; who deal with deadlines the way school kids do.  Also, school and parents/societies lack of trust can damage kids, so even if they are &quot;unschooling&quot; now, they are having to heal and center themselves.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe the real question is-<br/>
<br/>
 Is it possible that a human being could be born with out the ability to learn and live as a person?  <br/>
<br/>
Are there &quot;dud&quot; people, who with out coersion, gold stars, and punishments, would sit and drool on the couch?  (maybe anticephalics?)  <br/>
<br/>
I mean, millions of years- no &quot;school&quot;- <br/>
Is it that *now*- in these last two hundred years, in the evolution of our species, we have developed something in our society that has to be &quot;hammered in&quot;?   <br/>
<br/>
To answer your question- <br/>
<br/>
I think it is impossible that any person, given freedom, interdependance, love and respect would not grow up to be someone who is aware of his gifts and generously gives them to society.  <br/>
<br/>
The trick, however, is giving our children and ourselves that freedom, interdependance, love and respect.  It is not just school that denies people those things.<br/>
