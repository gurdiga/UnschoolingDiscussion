I just read your article about stuff in your home and sharing it with <br/>
your kids.<br/>
<br/>
My father in law, who is 90, has a ton of stuff in his garage;  old <br/>
sewing machines, old motors, cars, motorcyles, just about anything and <br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
I never thought about taking Elizabeth into that maze and just letting <br/>
her explore and ask questions.  Before this my FIL would take me in <br/>
and tell me stories about the things in there.  He is very week now, <br/>
but I think I will put a chair there for him and let him share with my <br/>
dd some of his stories.  We can just do a little at a time because he <br/>
tires easily now.<br/>
<br/>
DD doesn&#39;t like museums, she like hands on, so this I feel will be <br/>
such a wonderful experience for her.<br/>

Flea markets and thrift stores (or not-so-uptight antique shops) can  <br/>
be wonderful for those purposes, too.  And if the shopkeeper seems  <br/>
impatient or doesn&#39;t know much about the items, make a sketch (or  <br/>
photo if they don&#39;t mind) and look the things up with google, maybe.<br/>
