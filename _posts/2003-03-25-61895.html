<div id="ygrps-yiv-457672408"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Sheila asked:<br/>
&gt; How do you make flashlights?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Apparently we just need &#39;D&#39; size batteries little flashlight bulbs and wire<br/>
to connect it. I have been advised on another list it would be safer with<br/>
special wires from radio shack with alligator clips. OK so then we put a<br/>
toilet paper tube around this contraption and tape it on with strong tape<br/>
and write something like &quot;Let There Be Light&quot; on the tp tube so that it has<br/>
something remotely to do with Church!<br/>
I am also one who gets told off for my groups getting a bit rowdy and having<br/>
too much fun as someone else mentioned :-D.<br/>
PS if you are reading this Shyrley you will have to help me teach SS when<br/>
you visit *grin*. I&#39;ve gotten a couple of my best ss ideas from non<br/>
Christians!<br/>
