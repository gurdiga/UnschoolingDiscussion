<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805219563">Zak went to soccer practice last night and one of the kids on his team asked <br/>
Zak to come to his house to play for a while.  The dad was talking to my DH <br/>
and asked which school Zak went too.  DH said &quot;he doesn&#39;t we homeschool him&quot;. <br/>
 One of the older brother&#39;s whose 8 look at Zak with a look of awe and said <br/>
&quot;you mean you never have to go to school?&quot; Zak said proudly &quot;No I have school <br/>
at home I get to do what I want to do everyday and do it at home isn&#39;t that <br/>
great&quot;.  The other boy turned to his dad and said &quot;why do I have to go to <br/>
that school, why can&#39;t I have school at home&quot;?  Dad didn&#39;t know what to say <br/>
but said &quot;we&#39;ll talk about this later&quot;... I thought &quot;I bet they won&#39;t&quot;!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Score 1 for keeping kids home from institutions.<br/>
