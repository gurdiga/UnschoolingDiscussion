<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986347480">Judy,   <br/>
Here are some points from the essay, by Mark Douglas<br/>
-Stop thinking about music as a thing to learn and start thinking about it as a thing to do, you play music, you make music<br/>
-Encourage playing or making, versus practising<br/>
-He feels there is a period of exploring and experimenting with making music which takes place in a child&#39;s life,  from 2 to 5 years, and usually ends near puberty<br/>
     -this period should be one of uncompromised and unjudged support, no talk of long commitment<br/>
-A child should never be forced to play, even if parents feel its a waste of money<br/>
-We should have great patience, just as when a toddler is learning to talk, learning music is like learning a language.<br/>
-He doesn&#39;t know if a child needs to know how to read musical notation.<br/>
-Most of the world&#39;s music is made by people who don&#39;t need a notation system and who havn&#39;t learned their music from a teacher in the same sense that we have.<br/>
He concludes his essay with:&quot;The best way to learn music is to play it, play it, and make it with your family and friends.&quot;<br/>
For me I am trying to just keep music available for my children, now that we have stopped official suzuki lessons.  Neither one has said they&#39;ve missed it as of right now. And its been about 3 months.  I am going to have a violin, cello, piano, tin whistle, recorder and what ever else I can afford, available to them.  But it really has to be their decision.  They loved their music but I think they started because I really wanted them to do it, I grew up playing violin and piano but gave it up in college and regretted it.  So I was putting those feelings onto them. Living vicariously, ya know.  <br/>
I just have to keep in mind that they are so young --  9, 7 and 5.  And if they want to be musicians I&#39;ll be excited about it, but if they don&#39;t that&#39;s OK too!<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
