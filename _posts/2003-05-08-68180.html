&gt; we need to buy an old school bus and let the kids paint it however they <br/>

&gt; school desperately so she can ride the school bus.  That&#39;s her sole reason. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; LOL  As if I&#39;m not weird enough to my family and others...imagine us <br/>
&gt; trekking around town in a big &#39;ol school bus!!!  Oh, just the thought makes <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; me want to rush out and trade my boring conversion van in.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh my GOD!!!!!  I just had an idea...it&#39;s probably way weird, and would be <br/>
too expensive, but...<br/>
<br/>
What if part of the Unschooling Conference that I&#39;m planning in New England <br/>
involved renting a school bus and driver for an hour or so...maybe going <br/>
somewhere, or maybe just the ride.....<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm....<br/>

orchard at my cousin Nada&#39;s house, being a little house.<br/>
<br/>
But my dad bought it, and converted it to a camper.  This was in the early <br/>
60&#39;s.  Time passed.  The late 60&#39;s came and suddenly my dad&#39;s hunting bus was <br/>
two degrees from being groovy and that was NOT okay with him, not one bit.  <br/>
He was mortified that what he had worked so hard on was now considered a <br/>
hippie thing.  (We kids were not mortified, of course. &lt;g&gt;  But we didn&#39;t <br/>
paint it orange and flowery, although we sure asked him if we could!)<br/>
<br/>
My dad did his own upholstery (cushions with zippers and piping) for the bed <br/>
that converted to a dining table with bench seats.  I hadn&#39;t known he could <br/>
sew until he did that.<br/>
<br/>
Funny that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever thought of that bus AND the one I bought <br/>
in the late 1970&#39;s at the same time before.  Life goes so fast in my head...<br/>
