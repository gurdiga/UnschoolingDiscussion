Okay. I&#39;ve got a better picture of where her reading is now. :o)<br/>

Comics are definitely a great way to go. Garfield and Peanuts were good ones <br/>
for Conor to start. Then he eventually moved on to Foxtrot, Calvin & Hobbes, <br/>
Zits and Doonesbury. Those latter ones are great for discussion as well as <br/>
reading practice BTW. Politics, science, human relations, philosophy...it&#39;s <br/>
all in there.<br/>
