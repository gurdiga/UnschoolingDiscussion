So THAT&#39;S what I was doing wrong...sheesh, the things I just don&#39;t seem to <br/>

And to think all I have to do is get rid of my candles. Begone foul demons, <br/>
begone!!<br/>
Ah, but then I couldn&#39;t keep my peace vigil candle going in the window...oh <br/>
well. I guess we&#39;ll just have to keep some demons around anyway. sigh.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Look through your home as you pray and the Lord will let you know what items<br/>
&gt; need to be destroyed that have become an idol to you. Any type of collection -<br/>
&gt; dolls (roots come from voodoo), owls and frogs (abominations to the Lord, as<br/>
&gt; stated in the Bible), unicorns (lust and financial problems), etc. You may<br/>
&gt; have only one or two of these items, but they are just as deadly as a<br/>
&gt; collection. We have read and heard countless testimonies of what these items<br/>
&gt; can do. Dolls levitate, walk and talk; owls caused cancer and when destroyed<br/>
&gt; the person was totally healed. Please pray and seek the Lord regarding which<br/>
&gt; items you must destroy. With pictures of movie stars you form a soul tie. One<br/>
&gt; example is of a woman who came to us for DELIVERANCE from men and drugs. As I<br/>
&gt; was praying for her the Lord impressed that the picture of Marilyn Monroe that<br/>
&gt; was hanging above her bed was part of the problem. Marilyn Monroe had trouble<br/>
&gt; with men and drugs and she died because of it.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You do not have to worship any item for it to be idolatry. Just having these<br/>
&gt; things in your home give demons legal right to be in your home.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>====<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;I want to give you some information about two demons that were recently<br/>
&gt; revealed to me. The first one&#39;s name is &quot;GYROMANCY&quot;. GYROMANCY is appearing on<br/>
&gt; the new FRUITOPIA bottled fruit drink. GYROMANCY is a COIL like the coil on<br/>
&gt; your electric stove. GYROMANCY&#39;S design is to keep you moving in &quot;circles&quot;, so<br/>
&gt; you never accomplish your goals. GYROMANCY is the COIL inside the picture of<br/>
&gt; the palm readers hand. GYROMANCY is the COIL that hypnotists have you stare at<br/>
&gt; to put you OUT. GYROMANCY unlike the gyroscope tries to keep you OUT OF<br/>
&gt; BALANCE. The Lord showed me that GYROMANCY, is on the &quot;belly&quot; of the POKEMON<br/>
&gt; figures that are recently being released in BURGER KINGS. POKEMON in Japanese<br/>
&gt; means &quot;POCKET MONSTER&quot;. These little toys come in all shapes, one is a<br/>
&gt; UNICORN, there are gold plated tokens and secret boxes to place the figures in<br/>
&gt; which draws the children to buy them. I have heard children in stores, BEGGING<br/>
&gt; their parents for POKEMON gameboys, videos and games... THIS IS OUT OF<br/>
&gt; CONTROL... (TAKE A BREATH)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The &quot;DARK BLUE&quot; POKEMON figure has a COIL on his belly. The COIL is the OPEN<br/>
&gt; DOOR to the DEMONIC WITCHCRAFT attack being brought into homes. The COIL is<br/>
&gt; also appearing on the BURGER KING sacks at present and I am seeing this COIL<br/>
&gt; on many products in the store.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; LAWRYS SEASON SALT has it! Isn&#39;t this bizarre???? We were even in Red Lobster<br/>
&gt; and the plates we were being served on, has the spiral COIL throughout the<br/>
&gt; center and on the outside edge were 8 fish with spirals in their belly.<br/>

There was more but Internet Explorer MYSTERIOUSLY SHUT DOWN when I was about<br/>
to find out what Wiccans don&#39;t want me to know about them. The fact that<br/>
Internet Explorer frequently shuts down my computer doesn&#39;t mean that it<br/>
wasn&#39;t significant THIS TIME. And I think I was going to find out how the<br/>
Trinity Broadcast Network was related to demons too. How is an ordinary<br/>
person to KNOW who to BELIEVE?<br/>

I have a few old dolls, staring at me now with their demonic eyes.  I<br/>
don&#39;t have an owl but I have a small duck collection. (could explain my<br/>
devilish delight with swimming)    We have three swimming frogs and I can<br/>
see now they have a real problem with lust.   I don&#39;t think I have any<br/>
unicorns but maybe in the frog tank...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m worried that my coffee mug collection may be causing my addiction to<br/>
caffeine.<br/>
I have a collection of dinner plates and I KNOW that&#39;s why I ate too much<br/>
last night.<br/>
There seems to be a collection of carrots in my crisper.<br/>
There is definitely a collection of toothbrushes in my medicine cabinet! <br/>
And Band-Aids!   <br/>
I have cats.  It might be a collection.   I know they think they&#39;re Gods.<br/>
  Could I be at risk?<br/>
And these BOOKS.  There&#39;s even one about collecting pottery there, next<br/>
to the bible... Wait THREE bibles!  A collection of bibles!<br/>

Maybe I need to exercise.  <br/>

No problem, my yoga class is at ten thirty.   <br/>

I don&#39;t know Shyrley,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
a few years ago I ran into a homeschooled family who were pulling their kids out of our music and art school. <br/>
I asked the mother why?    She informed me that she knew the school was only going to experience bad troubled times.    She didn&#39;t want to be part of it.  <br/>
 I later found out that she had seen in the directors office that he had several candles around and liked to burn them!    She thought he was worshiping the devil.   And then on top of it she knew he was evil because he was gay.<br/>
 <br/>
  I&#39;m wondering how many candles I have in each room?   5 or 6?     Ah, oh!<br/>

wanted their kids to learn karate but they were disturbed by the shinto and <br/>
Buddhist overtones, and they didn&#39;t want their kids bowing to anyone.   So <br/>
they started a class that (I heard) involved starting with a prayer and ended <br/>
with something about making their bodies strong to serve Jesus or something.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was interesting and wondered why they didn&#39;t just do some kind <br/>
of other more European-based martial arts form.  Fencing or something.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; YOGA????  Maybe you&#39;d better check that website again.  I thought yoga <br/>
helped <br/>
 the demons to enter! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, Darla...you just reminded me of an interesting comment I heard from a <br/>
fundamentalist Christian once that still has me baffled (maybe she reads at <br/>
the demon website).<br/>
I taught a vegetarian/healthy cooking class and afterwards one of the women <br/>
and I got started on some topic that led to talking about meditation.<br/>
She said that she didn&#39;t believe in meditation because it opened you up to <br/>
evil spirits.<br/>
I asked her how she prayed to God if she didn&#39;t see it as a form of <br/>
meditation....she said only the kind of meditation where you &quot;emptied&quot; <br/>
yourself would make it possible for demon problems. <br/>
I about DIED!! That was tooooo weird. She really believed it. And all because <br/>
her dh told her so.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
