<div id="ygrps-yiv-285810201">Why should you watch something you don&#39;t like.  YOu wouldn&#39;t ask your <br/>
daughter to watch something she didn&#39;t like, would you?  You wouldn&#39;t <br/>
let an adult ask you to watch something you don&#39;t like, would you?  Just <br/>
tell your daughter that if she likes the wiggles, that&#39;s great, but you <br/>
don&#39;t particularly like it so you are going to read, watch another <br/>
program upstairs, clean the toilet, whatever, during that time.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
Can you tape it so she has a whole tape of it and can watch it by herself <br/>
when you&#39;re busy elsewhere in the house?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you need to tell her much about how you feel about it, just <br/>
that it&#39;s not your favorite and you want to do something else instead.  If she <br/>
wants to go with you to do the something else, you could offer to tape it for <br/>
her then, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I don&#39;t want to hurt her feelings by telling her I think it&#39;s the <br/>
absolute rock bottom in entertainment.  Ideas, anyone?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would tell her instead that different people like different kinds of <br/>
things, and that probably some of the shows you like she doesn&#39;t like, but you&#39;re <br/>
really glad she likes it.<br/>
<br/>
Not much help, maybe, but I&#39;ve been there.<br/>
<br/>
One show I didn&#39;t like at first but grew to like better was Power Rangers, th<br/>
e original series.  I kinds forced myself on that one, but ended up really <br/>
caring who the gold ranger was going to be, when that week came. &lt;g&gt;   And I like <br/>
Teletubbies, after a few false starts.   Instead of looking at it as a story, <br/>
I looked at it as production, asking myself all the mental questions I wasn&#39;t <br/>
voicing about the who/what/why behind it and what messages they were <br/>
intending to convey.  Holly liked the videos (on color, or foreign cultures and <br/>
holidays), and I liked that they repeated them, so the first time we could just <br/>
watch and the second time we could point things out to each other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380447482">Why not leave her to watch the Wiggles alone?  While it may be excruciating,<br/>
its harmless.<br/>
<br/>
Or why not do something else you need to do in the room but not focused on<br/>
the tv?  like writing letters, paying bills, getting a pedicure?<br/>

&gt;    How do you handle it when your child is in love with a television<br/>
program but you find it excruciating to watch?  My daughter, who just turned<br/>
four, just adores The Wiggles.  I would rather put my tongue in a light<br/>
socket than watch.  It is absolute torture for me.  I always watch TV with<br/>
Kayla, but I don&#39;t know if I should just continue to watch and keep quiet,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I go check my emails. :) My son loves the Teletubbies and they both love Finding Nemo (which I like but not as much on the 150th viewing as I did the first time I saw it) so in goes the tape and off I go for a break. There&#39;s no hard subject matter that requires much discussion with Po and Lala and I think we&#39;ve talked about Nemo enough to work out any questions. I don&#39;t even bother to say I don&#39;t like the Tubbies, just that it&#39;s time for my break. I don&#39;t mind the TV being a babysitter sometimes.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it would be necessary to tell her you dislike the Wiggles, and <br/>
I don&#39;t think it is absolutely necessary to watch that kind of program with <br/>
her. While I understand you wanting to watch and know what she is viewing so you <br/>
can discuss with her something you might not feel she is ready for, IMHO the <br/>
Wiggles don&#39;t fit in that category. KWIM? I really believe that she would be <br/>
safe watching the program by herself for that half hour. You OTOH could catch <br/>
up on that book you have been wanting to read, wash a load of laundry, or <br/>
answer emails here! :o) A whole half an hour of Mommy time! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157463718">Aw, I went thru this with Barney in my day.  I did<br/>
get used to it eventually, and spent *some* time with<br/>
my son while he watched it.  But most of the time I<br/>
tried to be busy with something in another room. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
   I say, if it doesn&#39;t bother her for you to be<br/>
elsewhere, go ahead and leave, but I wouldn&#39;t share<br/>
your feelings with her unless she asks.  Then I would<br/>
be careful to state your opinion, simply, and lightly.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
   I feel for you.  I&#39;ve seen the Wiggles. I even<br/>
think it&#39;s worse than Barney, and that&#39;s saying a<br/>
lot!!!  <br/>
