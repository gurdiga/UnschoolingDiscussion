NHEN&#39;s newest email newsletter just for NEW HOMESCHOOLERS:<br/>
<br/>
N-H-E-N<br/>
New Homeschoolers&#39; Encouragement Newsletter<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/newhser/default.asp?id=402">http://www.nhen.org/newhser/default.asp?id=402</a><br/>
<br/>
Each month, N-H-E-N will focus on particular questions that new<br/>
homeschoolers have been asking.  If you&#39;re new to homeschooling, you won&#39;t<br/>
want to miss this monthly encouragement. If you&#39;re not new to homeschooling,<br/>
we&#39;d love to have you offer your advice to the new families!<br/>
<br/>
The theme for the September issue centers around a question that many new<br/>
homeschoolers ask themselves:<br/>
<br/>
CAN I REALLY DO THIS???<br/>
<br/>
Ann Lahrson-Fisher addresses the question with her article, &quot;Your Trusty<br/>
Homeschool Emergency Toolkit.&quot; And homeschoolers from all over the country<br/>
want to reassure you that &quot;Yes, you CAN homeschool your child!&quot; Be sure to<br/>
read all their responses. As Denise Thompson from the NHEN Homeschool<br/>
Editors&#39; list reminds me, &quot;Choosing to homeschool may be a leap of faith,<br/>
but it isn&#39;t a leap into the unknown.&quot; So, let the the newest NHEN<br/>
newsletter show you how to get started!<br/>

<br/>
NEXT MONTH:<br/>
The question is : What ABOUT Socialization?<br/>
<br/>
Most homeschoolers have heard this so often they simply roll their eyes at<br/>
the person making the comment. Still, new homeschoolers are only now running<br/>
into the question and could benefit from hearing how you all respond! Send<br/>
any responses to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:N-H-E-N@...">N-H-E-N@...</a><br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
