&lt;&lt;  I can&#39;t emphasize enough how vital to unschooling I consider free choice <br/>
 to be.  To me it is much more important than how it looks on the outside or <br/>
 what kind of classes they take.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

   Thank you so much for this post. I usually lurk here but I wanted to reply <br/>
to this and to thank you for taking the time to boost my confidence. I live <br/>
in PA so we are legally bound to certain laws such as a portfolio and book <br/>
lists and objectives. These things have a tendency to upend your confidence <br/>
when you arent &quot;doing&quot; school. The way this year has gone for us, &quot;doing&quot; <br/>
school has been scarce indeed. I wince when I think of the other day and how <br/>
angry I was at my 10 yr old for forgetting how to borrow in subtraction. You <br/>
see, THAT would look bad for me if anyone knew. &lt;sigh&gt; I must constantly keep <br/>
in mind that I am not doing this for the school system. Basically what I am <br/>
saying is that it is soooooooo encouraging to know that they will grow into <br/>
the peop[e they are meant to be if I will allow it without pushing them.... <br/>
And your letter helped remind me.<br/>
ty :o)<br/>
