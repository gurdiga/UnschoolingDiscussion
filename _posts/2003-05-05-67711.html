I agree, mostly.<br/>
But when all of our insurance rates are affected by people not wearing them, <br/>
then it&#39;s more than simple freedom.<br/>
The whole insurance thing seems like such a scam though...don&#39;t even get me <br/>
started.<br/>

Here is some information to help you decide. I couldn&#39;t find the website<br/>
I have seen before that shows that motor vehicle accidents are the<br/>
leading cause of death for people between 1 and 19 but I did find this<br/>
information. I googled &quot;cdc child deaths&quot; and found a lot of lengthy<br/>
statistics, including that 63% of mva fatalities are in rural areas.<br/>
(Who would have guessed that?) Also there are fewer mva deaths now than<br/>
in 1953, a result that the website writer attributed almost entirely to<br/>
safety features in vehicles including seat belts, and stronger crack<br/>
downs on drunk drivers.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line for me: I don&#39;t think we can expect our children to put on<br/>
their seatbelts if we don&#39;t do it. <br/>

National Child Passenger Safety Week<br/>
February 9-15, 2003  <br/>
<br/>
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children in<br/>
the United States. In the United States during 2001, 1579 children ages<br/>
14 years and younger died as occupants in motor vehicle crashes, and<br/>
approximately 228,000 were injured. That&#39;s an average of 30 deaths and<br/>
more than 4,300 injuries each week (NHTSA 2002). <br/>
<br/>
Of the children ages 4 years and younger who were fatally injured in<br/>
2001, nearly 50 percent were completely unrestrained (NHTSA 2002).  <br/>
<br/>
Most of these injuries could have been prevented. Placing children in<br/>
age-appropriate restraint systems reduces serious and fatal injuries by<br/>
more than half (NHTSA 2002).  <br/>
<br/>
National Child Passenger Safety Week occurs each year during the week of<br/>
Valentine&#39;s Day, bringing public attention to the importance of safely<br/>
transporting children. This year, the focus of National Child Passenger<br/>
Safety Week is on the 4 Steps for Kids: rear-facing infant seats,<br/>
forward-facing toddler seats, booster seats, and finally seat belts. Of<br/>
course, all children ages 12 years and younger should ride in<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, the issue for me isn&#39;t whether or not wearing seatbelts is a good <br/>
idea.  It probably is.  I just don&#39;t like that the &quot;experts&quot; are <br/>
making the decision for me whether or not I or my kids wear a belt.  <br/>
I&#39;m capable of making an intelligent decision on my own.  I don&#39;t <br/>
mind that people do studies and statistics and speak passionately <br/>
about wearing seatbelts.  I just don&#39;t like a law that says, &quot;We&#39;ve <br/>
decided this is what is safest for you, it doesn&#39;t matter if you <br/>
agree or not.  Do it or else.&quot;  <br/>
