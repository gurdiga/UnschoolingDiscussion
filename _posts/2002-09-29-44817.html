 </span></blockquote>When they eat scraps daily, for the most part, they expect it and then won&#39;t <br/>
eat regular dog food without it. Would you? I&#39;ve had way too many dogs that <br/>
this has been proven with. Does it make them sick, yes sometimes and then <br/>
the consequences are gross for us and upsetting to the dog. Will it kill <br/>
them, no. Is there a reason why they need it, no. Will it fatten them up, <br/>
most of the time yes. Are there exceptions to the rule, of course. Is it <br/>
easier for me to feed only dog food and biscuits, not have a fat dog or one <br/>
that has an upset stomach and not worry about whether I have to cook for him <br/>
or not to get him to eat? Most definitely.<br/>
<br/>
Many people do the whole food diets with their dogs and do the raw meat and <br/>
veggies and all. Great for them. I don&#39;t have time for it, and honestly <br/>
don&#39;t see the need for it. My dogs are part of our family but they are not <br/>
my kids. They are happy, healthy and well loved.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, don&#39;t feed her scraps ;-) Put them in the refrigerator for lunch the<br/>
next day. Our dog gets to lick plates and pots. Occasionally she gets<br/>
something that&#39;s been in the fridge for a week that clearly no one wants.<br/>
And she gets apple cores, butt ends of carrots. She thinks they&#39;re treats<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
She may beg. We tell her to go lay down. She may not like her dog food<br/>
because of the people food she tastes but she knows that&#39;s her only choice.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;re talking about the bits left behind by a toddler that seem like a<br/>
waste. Those won&#39;t make up a significant portion of a dog&#39;s diet.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;It seemed out of place in the conversation with the dog food but then<br/>
maybe I missed something. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The answer won&#39;t focus, but will probably scatter the ideas even further!<br/>
<br/>
The discussion was about what dogs need.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I can decide what my dog needs or doesn&#39;t need much more than I <br/>
can decide in advance what my kids need.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m probably more personable with my dog than some people want to be.  <br/>
<br/>
I think people&#39;s beliefs about dogs and what they need and should and <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have and do is very culturally based, and the idea that dogs should <br/>
NEVER have table scraps (or kitchen prep scraps, or to lick pans) seems <br/>
reactonary to the fact that not so long ago in this culture dogs ONLY had <br/>
scraps.  <br/>
<br/>
When was &quot;dog food&quot; first invented and sold, y&#39;think?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about need or health, it&#39;s about culture and marketting and control.<br/>
<br/>
For me, for MY mental health, it&#39;s important for me not to feel ownership and <br/>
control over the very biological functions of people OR animals.  I feel bad <br/>
sterilizing pets, but I do it.  I don&#39;t like it.  So I try not to control <br/>
every tiny bit of the rest of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
I think when people are compassionate it&#39;s about making them better people, <br/>
on a mental and spiritual level, and not even so directly about the effect it <br/>
has on others around them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a chasm between the way a person treats a child and the way a <br/>
person treats a dog.  It&#39;s the treater, not the treatee, sometimes we see.  <br/>
<br/>
Our neighbors are really mean to their dogs.  Two spaniels who are yelled at <br/>
for barking when someone comes to the door, and one shepherd puppy (nearly a <br/>
year old now) who is similarly yelled at if he barks or jumps up on the wall <br/>
when we go out into our yard.  We&#39;d be glad to talk to him and pet him but <br/>
he&#39;s insulted and berated just for coming to look at us.  <br/>
<br/>
Their kids are all grown, and I don&#39;t know them.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side, they had a shepherd puppy who got LOTS of attention when <br/>
he was little, and was chained up untrained when he was older.  I would have <br/>
loved to liberate him, but they would have noticed if he lived next door, I <br/>
guess.   When he was about a year old they gave him away to someone.  I was <br/>
glad, but sad that most of his first year had been lacking in attention and <br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure they tell their children they can&#39;t have another dog because they <br/>
didn&#39;t take care of that one, but the kids are little, and the parents are <br/>
irresponsible.  So the kids get the blame for what the parents didn&#39;t do.  <br/>
Not just about the dog.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes solutions to problems require changing what we believe.  Sometimes <br/>
what we believe isn&#39;t very well founded and changing is a relief!  That&#39;s <br/>
happened with me lots over my life.  I will claim to &quot;believe&quot; something but <br/>
when I really look at it it&#39;s not &quot;belief&quot; in the way beliefs should be, but <br/>
parotting, or accepting the facade of what I&#39;d heard and seen.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to be that way about school.  Either my own investment or training or <br/>
hopes had made school the great hope of the future.   Other people&#39;s points <br/>
made way more sense than my &quot;beliefs.&quot;  I didn&#39;t even need  new evidence, I <br/>
just needed to squint, kinda, and look at the same old thing a different way.<br/>
<br/>
How many people today believe formula is cleaner and more scientific than <br/>
breast milk?  Why would they believe that?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maggie (our Boston Terrier) eats just about everything, even potato peels, <br/>
onion, carrots, peas, meat, what have you. I even have doggie *recipies* I <br/>
have invented for her. For example, I made a roast with carrots, potatoes, <br/>
and onions in the crock pot yesterday. I saved the middles from the onions, <br/>
(I don&#39;t use them because the core is bitter) all the carrot ends, the fat <br/>
that had to be trimmed off the meat, a little meat, potato peals, and one <br/>
small potato. After the crock pot was loaded, I put my scraps into a pot on <br/>
the stove added some water and cooked the scraps for Maggie Stew. I cook it <br/>
until it is basically a mush and add some to her food and freeze the rest in <br/>
old bread bags that I twist off (looks like a row of plastic sausage links). <br/>
Whenever I want to treat her, I cut off one section of the bag, thaw it out <br/>
in the microwave and mix into her food. I also put her heart worm pill in <br/>
with the treat when I put it in her food.<br/>
Now I realize this is the extreme of dog ownership, and many won&#39;t go that <br/>
far for treats, its easier to buy a doggie treat at the store, but for me it <br/>
is cheaper to do it this way. Maggie sits in the kitchen when I am cooking <br/>
and I tell her I am making her treats. She talks to me with small barks, <br/>
moans, growls and wiggles all over. She gets so excited when I cook, she gets <br/>
to talking to me, and wiggling so much, she slips around on the kitchen <br/>
floor. She loves the smells of all the food. Sometimes she will sit on Moly&#39;s <br/>
stool and stick her nose up in the air, she is perfectly still, closes her <br/>
eyes and she just sighs. I am positive she knows I am cooking for her. She is <br/>
hardly fat, she weighs about 13 lbs. Last year she got up to 18 lbs. but she <br/>
was pregnant. I save just about everything and make up all sorts of treats <br/>
for her. I freeze most in the sausage link/bread bag thing. She gets so much <br/>
pleasure from the smells, and like I said, she knows I am making something <br/>
for her, I would hate to take that away from her. I agree with Sandra, I <br/>
would rather have a fat happy dog than waste even the fat, potato peals and <br/>
carrot ends. <br/>

&lt;&lt;I bet my kids would eat dry cheerios and nothing else if that&#39;s all I had <br/>
ever given them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No matter how agreable your kids may be, I find that very hard to believe!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;d rather have a fat happy dog than to throw meat scraps (or cheese or<br/>
anything a dog would like to eat) away right in front of a dog.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well a fat dog may be happy but he&#39;s not necessarily healthy and has better <br/>
chances of not living as long and healthy either. And I wouldn&#39;t necessarily <br/>
throw the scraps away &quot;right in front of the dog!&quot;<br/>

For me, for MY mental health, it&#39;s important for me not to feel ownership <br/>
and<br/>
control over the very biological functions of people OR animals.  I feel bad<br/>
sterilizing pets, but I do it.  I don&#39;t like it.  So I try not to control<br/>
every tiny bit of the rest of their lives.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay I don&#39;t get it all then. You don&#39;t want to feel ownership or control of <br/>
people or animals. You don&#39;t like the idea of sterlizing animals but do it <br/>
anyway. That&#39;s a choice you make but don&#39;t like. You control that part of <br/>
them you don&#39;t want to??<br/>

&gt; At one point, earlier, I think we were talking about pop tarts.  If I<br/>

afreind), table scraps and kibble. I would say table scraps make up <br/>
50% of their diets. This is pasta, veggies etc.<br/>
They are happy and healthy although the Lab has put on a bit of <br/>
weight since we moved to the US. Thisis cos back home I would <br/>
walk for two hours a day on the Malvern Hills with the dogs running <br/>
free. Here in uptight Virginia dogs are not allowed off the leash :-(<br/>
so she doesn&#39;t get the excersise she used too.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t give them things with sugar in. It will rot their teeth and I <br/>
don&#39;t want to have to clean them.<br/>

go out hunting and then the meat is free. Back home people don&#39;t <br/>
hunt. I&#39;m not sure if its cos its illegal, or wildlife is protected or that <br/>
we ain&#39;t allowed guns. (I&#39;m not counting the aristocracy chasing <br/>
foxes. Thats not hunting, more like torture and slaughter).<br/>

My dogs will eat everything except rice and potato peelings.<br/>

And don&#39;t forget Hunt Saboteurs, who go out and sabotage fox-<br/>
hunts and the grouse and pheasant shoots.<br/>
With any luck , Fox hunting will be banned some time soon in <br/>
England. It already is in Scotland.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Whats heartworm?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shyrley<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hearworm is passed to dogs through the female mosquito. The larvae inters the <br/>
dogs bloodstream and infects the heart and lungs. It is common throughout all <br/>
the US, and there are some areas where it is extremely prevalent. Left <br/>
untreated, Heartwrom will clog the heart and lungs of a dog. Heartworm is <br/>
best treated by prevention as it is very hard to treat after infestation. <br/>
Symptoms include weight loss, and coughing. Heartworms can grow up to 12 or <br/>
more inches in length, and a dog or cat heart infested with the worms looks <br/>
rather nasty. <br/>
Because I was a nurse, I am kind of on the fence when it comes to <br/>
vaccinations (kids and pets) But, because heartworm is so prevalent here, we <br/>
give Maggie a monthly pill. We also get her parvo vaccination because we have <br/>
parvo in our ground. There are some sites with explanations of heartworm, and <br/>
I looked for one with pictures of the worm infestation, but couldn&#39;t find <br/>
one. (I didn&#39;t look long though) Our vet has a dog heart in a jar that has <br/>
the infestation and it is really nasty. <br/>
