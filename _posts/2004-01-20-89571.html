 </span></blockquote>       I would be more worried about the &quot;do not allow . . .&quot; rather than <br/>
what particular kind of play or stories goes in the blank, be it witchcraft or <br/>
anything else.<br/>
<br/>
       Thinking of ANY kind of play or stories as something to be *allowed* <br/>
or not could be a stumbling block to abundant unschooling imo. <br/>
<br/>
       The phrase reminded me of how I used to hate the universal imperative <br/>
for outdoor play -- for my own good of course! -- rather than what I lived <br/>
for, which was reading and writing in quiet indoor places surrounded by books and <br/>
knowledge and ideas. My parents and teachers and the whole culture conspired <br/>
to demand this of me, for years and years. The irony was that I was strong and <br/>
fast and quite liked physical play if given an opportunity to choose, rather <br/>
than them dictate it to get my nose out of the books. <br/>
<br/>
       (Also I recall vividly how much I loved the cool, crisp <br/>
air-conditioning and dreaded the outdoor heat/humidity of central Florida. I resented that <br/>
the teachers got to stay inside with the books; more than anything, I think my <br/>
driving desire for THAT  privilege shaped my career in education. &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>
      <br/>
       DH catches himself doing this now, pronouncing that the children <br/>
&quot;need&quot; more or less of this or that, when it&#39;s really just echoes in his head of <br/>
the old grown-up imperative to control and standardize, and to seem to be <br/>
&quot;doing&quot; something to, or for, or about, the children, no matter which direction (on <br/>
very rare occasions I&#39;ve caught myself doing this too &lt;g&gt;)  JJ<br/>
