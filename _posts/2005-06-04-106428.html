hey, except for Ritalin! as a public schooled kid who<br/>
took all the drugs I could find just to cope with the<br/>
boredom of waiting for high school to be OVER, I<br/>
object to this! Just think, if The State had really<br/>
had control of us then, like they were supposed to, I<br/>
would have been on Ritalin way back then and never had<br/>
a kid!<br/>

Except I don&#39;t think ritalin is prescribed for boredom in high  school.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for birth control either...  You still would have  been on <br/>
your own...<br/>
