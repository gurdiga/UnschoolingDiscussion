I wonder if you all have heard about the new &quot;career&quot; identification program in the public schools.  It is sweeping close to being implemented on a national level now.  Some schools make it mandatory for graduation, while others leave it optional.  What is it, you may ask?  It is a program in which Highschool Juniors must choose a vocational direction (like Medical, or Public Services, etc) and take the corresponding courses as part of their graduation requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks, even staunchly institionalized families, are screaming pigeon-holing, but proponents are touting career education, advanced opportunities, &quot;real life&quot; experience.  Does anyone else have any more information, or thoughts or comments on this issue?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888327135">There was a thing on the news the other day about <br/>
psycometric testing being brought in in our schools, <br/>
&#39;to help students choose courses in keeping with their <br/>
aptitudes.&#39;  Blech!  Problem is, who&#39;s setting and <br/>
marking such tests?  What personal biases do they have <br/>
towards certain types of intelligence?  Ugh Ugh!  Scary <br/>
stuff, let&#39;s all sit in our boxes and be told what <br/>
we&#39;re going to be good at...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for bringing this up. Its helped me see that<br/>
what I need to maybe focus on is that my kids are<br/>
having fun. First of all they are very very young<br/>
still.  Some of the things they are interested in now<br/>
could be normal growing development some could be life<br/>
long hobbies/ learning/ pursuits some maybe their<br/>
&#39;career.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I remember having to do a report on what I wanted to<br/>
be when I grew up when in jr. high. I had no clue what<br/>
I really wanted to be. I thought the project was<br/>
stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I decided would be a mechanic. I picked it because I<br/>
felt it to go against the grain of the upper middle<br/>
class carreers most of my classmates were choosing. My<br/>
best friend at the time decided to do her project on<br/>
being a trucker. We decided that we would be a team<br/>
she would drive the truck and I could fix them. <br/>
<br/>
In college I entered into a Electrical Engineering<br/>
Degree more to prove a point that I could because I<br/>
was a woman rather than because I really wanted to. <br/>
<br/>
When I decided that wasn&#39;t for me I fell into a trap<br/>
of so what now. I looked through the university<br/>
catalog which is basically based on professional type<br/>
degrees.<br/>
<br/>
I crossed out everything that didn&#39;t appeal to I got<br/>
down to Architecture. I like the classes then decided<br/>
to specialize in Landscape Architecture. I liked it<br/>
but to some degree ;) this was a default education. I<br/>
wonder if I spent some time out of school/ unschooled<br/>
myself that I would have gone a different direction.<br/>
<br/>
This is problably more that anyone wanted to know<br/>
about my life but its reminding more why I chose to<br/>
unschool my kids that I want them to be able to create<br/>
a job/ work whatever you want to call it that might<br/>
not fit into the current cultures concept of work!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Samantha<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821066554">I am sure it is a different test than what I took in 11th grade but I<br/>
remember taking this silly test my mom so wanted me to take to see what<br/>
career would be best suited for me. At the time I had no idea what I<br/>
wanted to be so I took it to make mom happy and to see what it would<br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
Never did I laugh so hard in my life. And my husband and I still laugh<br/>
about it. My best suited career was to a be a parole officer. I could<br/>
never in my mind ever imagine little old me trying to do that job. Nor<br/>
would I want to . Not that it isn&#39;t a good job but it isn&#39;t for me.  I<br/>
remember telling my mom and she was in shock as she had so hoped it<br/>
would say I would be become a artist. I am sure that wasn&#39;t even the mix<br/>
of results. *L*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458818701">There for a while they were doing what was called out here, Careers 2000.<br/>
You couldn&#39;t graduate from a high school if you hadn&#39;t taken that class.<br/>
Now, that wasn&#39;t a &quot;bad&quot; class.  It was an exploration class.  You<br/>
investigated various jobs and learned how to fill out a job application and<br/>
how to do a resume.  They did mock interviews and they held a careers day<br/>
where folks from all walks of life and careers AND ethnic origin came in and<br/>
had boothes where the kids could pick up information.  Kids liked it because<br/>
they spent a day at the local junior college and a day at the local<br/>
university.  They went on trips to various employers in the community.<br/>
<br/>
It did NOT mandate that they make any choices except for one report they had<br/>
to do (interview a professional that they thought had an interesting job).<br/>
<br/>
Now, when I was in school (back in the dark ages) you did choose a track to<br/>
be on, college prep or vocational.  You were not, however, required to stay<br/>
within the bounds of either track.  So, you could take algebra, geometry,<br/>
Latin, foreign languages, honors English and history all in junior high.  If<br/>
you choose the vocational track you could take typing, filing, home ec,<br/>
woodshop, metalshop or various other &quot;vocational&quot; classes in junior high.<br/>
In high school the classes got serious with algebra II, trig, and prep<br/>
classes for college.  The vocational classes went so far (and our local high<br/>
school still does) as to build a house each year, build cars and actually<br/>
race them, etc.  They also had a complete range of the arts (which somehow<br/>
fell into the vocational category, go figure) and our high school orchestra<br/>
played with the SF symphany.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is choice and being able to not be labeled.<br/>
