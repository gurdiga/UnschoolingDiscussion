Jim Brown and Jenni Parker<br/>
Agape Press<br/>
<br/>
The CBS Evening News is being accused of taking a cheap<br/>
shot at home schooling.<br/>
<br/>
In the first of a two-part series on what CBS News calls &quot;a<br/>
dark side to home schooling,&quot; correspondent Vince Gonzales<br/>
highlighted an isolated case in rural North Carolina where<br/>
a teenage boy committed suicide after killing his brother<br/>
and sister in their squalid trailer home. The parents of the<br/>
two children had reportedly been home schooling them, and<br/>
were under investigation by the Department of Social Services<br/>
for abuse and neglect.<br/>
<br/>
Mike Smith, president of the Home School Legal Defense<br/>
Association (hslda.org) (HSLDA), believes CBS used the<br/>
tragic case to push for government regulation of home<br/>
schooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What does home schooling have to do with this? Nothing,&quot;<br/>
Smith says, adding, &quot;The only thing that [the media] can<br/>
point to is that these folks were alleged home schoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Smith says he does not think the parents in the CBS news<br/>
story ever even attempted to comply with state home-<br/>
schooling association guidelines, something his group is<br/>
attempting to verify. In any event, he feels CBS News is<br/>
taking an isolated incident out of its true context to bolster<br/>
its case against home schooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re trying to figure out why they&#39;ve taken this situation to<br/>
try to support their position, because it doesn&#39;t do it,&quot; Smith<br/>
says. He believes that instead of operating on a factual basis<br/>
and reporting the news fairly, CBS was using emotionalism<br/>
in the hope of sparking public outrage against the home<br/>
schooling movement.<br/>
<br/>
Smith feels the CBS reports are deflecting attention and<br/>
concern from where they should be focused. &quot;I&#39;m trying<br/>
to figure out why this turns against home schooling rather<br/>
than against the Department of Social Services,&quot; he says,<br/>
&quot;because they&#39;re responsible for protecting children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Smith points out that the system in place requires Social<br/>
Services to investigate abuse and neglect, which that<br/>
department claims to have done. &quot;It appears to me that the<br/>
conclusion CBS is making of these facts is totally illogical,&quot;<br/>
he says.<br/>
<br/>
The HSLDA was established to defend and advance the<br/>
constitutional right of parents to direct the education of their<br/>
children and to protect family freedoms. The legal defense<br/>
group has been involved in a number of home schooling<br/>
disputes in North Carolina, including the recently resolved<br/>
Stumbo case, in which the state&#39;s Supreme Court finally<br/>
ruled against the Department of Child Protective Services<br/>
and in favor of safeguarding the privacy of home-schooling<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
According to Smith, the Stumbo case was significant<br/>
because North Carolina&#39;s high court found that social<br/>
workers are obligated to examine reports alleging abuse<br/>
or neglect to make sure they rise to the level as defined<br/>
by the law before initiating an investigation.<br/>
<br/>
The HSLDA president feels that every anonymous report<br/>
of abuse should not necessarily result in an investigation,<br/>
but that social workers need to carefully scrutinize each<br/>
report so that they will not subject families to unjustifiable<br/>
trauma due to a trivial or false allegation. While the incidents<br/>
reported in the recent CBS Evening News story were tragic<br/>
and may have been a situation of actual abuse, Smith<br/>
contends that the story has little or nothing to do with home<br/>
schooling. He believes the media simply used that spurious<br/>
connection for their own purposes, and is urging families to<br/>
phone or e-mail CBS to complain about its &quot;Eye on America&quot;<br/>
report.<br/>

<br/>
This won&#39;t help.<br/>
If an anonymous report of abuse or neglect is treated like proof that&#39;s <br/>
really bad, but if anyone&#39;s recommending not really checking up on all of them, <br/>
where is the safety for abused children?  Do they have to wait for a second or <br/>
third report, or worse?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing HSLDA wants spanking to be exempt from considerations of &quot;child <br/>
abuse,&quot; so their defense of spanking is, from my point of view, problematical. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is the case where a 2 year old little girl ran out the front door <br/>
of their house naked and was quickly rounded up and brought back <br/>
indoors - but not before an anonymous neighbor called police who <br/>
reported it to social services and they came out immediately and <br/>
demanded to interview their little children without their parents <br/>
present. The case was about whether social services had the right to do <br/>
that - based on nothing more than an anonymous call. HSLDA defended the <br/>
Stumbos and won. It was decided about a month ago or so.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also very curious about what triggered the CBS news report at this <br/>
time.<br/>

<br/>
Someone should ask the reporter.<br/>
<br/>
ABC had a new story two years ago about homeschooling&#39;s &quot;dark side&quot;.  It<br/>
was right after the Warren children died, I think.   They did bring up<br/>
Andrea Yates and maybe others.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it was as strongly holding homeschooling responsible for<br/>
child abuse as the CBS story. <br/>
<br/>
But really, I think it had to come.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve wondered for years when the poo would hit the fan.  The first time I<br/>
saw a copy of Home School Digest<br/>
I wondered how/ why every homeschooler in the world wasn&#39;t being<br/>
investigated, with all that &quot;train up a child&quot; crap and their happy<br/>
advertisements for &quot;THE ROD - the ideal tool for child training.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Religious freedom includes the freedom to hit kids.  Fundamentalist folks<br/>
are homeschooling to keep their kids away from secular influences.  They<br/>
*are* homeschooling to isolate their kids and they are &quot;disciplining&quot;<br/>
their kids and they do keep them away from doctors because they&#39;re afraid<br/>
of the questions.   It&#39;s bad.<br/>
<br/>
If you google Gods Creation Outreach Ministry you can read all about what<br/>
the Edgars believed.  You can read some stories about how church members<br/>
hog tied kids and left them in bathtubs and closets as discipline and how<br/>
the boy who died was once tied &quot;crucifixion style&quot; to a bunk bed.  Nine<br/>
year old Brian Edgar had a sock stuffed in his mouth, duct tape wrapped<br/>
around him and a belt round his arms and chest and was left to die in his<br/>
bed that way.  <br/>
<br/>
CBS linked child abuse to homeschooling because they didn&#39;t have the<br/>
balls to link it to fundamentalist freaks. <br/>
