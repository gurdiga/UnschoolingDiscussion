&lt;&lt;  and a revolver<br/>
is a small black handgun like the FBI carry in films? &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
A shotgun fires a bunch of little pellets (shot, like B-Bs [doh!  if you <br/>
don&#39;t have B-B guns...].  There is a paper case/tube about the size of your <br/>
thumb, with a charge of gunpowder [anyone here should feel free to describe <br/>
this better] and it propels a number of little brass balls, way smaller than <br/>
marbles.  The size of (although there are different sizes)...  all my <br/>
examples are being for American things.  Bigger than sand or salt.  Barley <br/>
grains, if they were round.  Rice.  But round.<br/>
<br/>
It might look like a rifle, but a rifle shoots a bullet--one pointy piece of <br/>
lead mounted in the end of a little shell (looks like a missile, the size of <br/>
your finger or smaller--a .22 shell is small like a...<br/>
<br/>
********wait.  this reminds me of when I tried to explain Cheetohs to someone <br/>
from New Zealand who wrote and asked what cheesiepoofs were.*******<br/>
<br/>
So in the back end of the bullet is a charge of gunpowder which is set off <br/>
and propels the ACTUAL bullet (the shot, the lead) out.  &quot;Bullet&quot; is for the <br/>
whole pointy missile-like thing, and also for the bit that leaves the gun.   <br/>
The shell stays, like a rejected booster rocket.<br/>
<br/>
This is the kind of (possibly faulty) learning that came from just being <br/>
around guns kinda vaguely.  I&#39;ve fired a rifle once (I was twelve or so, and <br/>
my parents wanted to see if I was interested and had me fire a hunting rifle, <br/>
but I got hit with the scope and had no further interest) and a B-B gun <br/>
several times, and I was done.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably websites with illustrations, and there might be people <br/>
here who know where they are!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573260646">Dunno, but I&#39;m surprised Shyrley doesn&#39;t know what a <br/>
shotgun is, since it&#39;s used in one of the sports we won <br/>
a gold in at the Sydney Olympics *grin* hi, Shyrley...  <br/>
I think &#39;skeets&#39; are &#39;clay pigeons.&#39;  Anyone with money <br/>
can go and shoot game, though, and shotguns are usually <br/>
what farmers have.  Revolvers are a type of handgun, <br/>
not the ones the FBI carry in films, but the older <br/>
&#39;western-style&#39; ones, they only hold 6 bullets, where <br/>
the other kinds hold &#39;clips&#39; of 9 or so.  Though you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t know this watching a film, cos sometimes they <br/>
just don&#39;t seem to run out...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, have I warned you that in the town where BIL lives <br/>
(I hope youn were taking notes before, dear *grin*) <br/>
that if you walk anywhere you&#39;ll be seen as either a <br/>
bag-lady or an eccentric brit?  They are at least used <br/>
to my mil walking around when she visits...<br/>
<br/>
Now, to catch up on the hundreds of messages on the UK <br/>
list...  see you there, Shyrley!<br/>
