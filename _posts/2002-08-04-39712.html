<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585645033">Oh, my!   Methinks that age is showing. <br/>
English is an ever evolving language. <br/>
I am not sure that makes usage that was taught less than half century ago a &quot;mistake&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, my less than a decade old Websters Collegiate New World STILL has dove listed as an alternate past tense of dive.  <br/>
<br/>
I well remember doing lists of present tense, past tense, past participle. <br/>
<br/>
Drive, drove, driven<br/>
swing, swung, swung, <br/>
hang, hanged, hanged (for an execution)<br/>
hang, hung, hung (on the clothesline)<br/>
swim, swam, swum<br/>
run, ran, run<br/>
eat, ate, eaten<br/>
see, saw, seen<br/>
DIVE, DOVE, DIVED<br/>
<br/>
Might be fun to make longer lists or &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;irregular&quot;.  I would not be surprised if one could fine in &quot;good literature&quot;  instances where the hero &quot;dove&quot;  in to swirling waters to save the damsel.   Or someone on the ground watched as the plane dove to the ground, spinning in flames.  <br/>

  &quot;Dove&quot; is a little white bird, a noun. <br/>
  &quot;Dived&quot; is the past tense of dive, a verb.<br/>
  It IS good and correct grammar. &quot;I dove into the pool&quot; is NOT.<br/>
  Common mistake. <br/>

saint, &#39;dived&#39; is really &#39;dove&#39;; Pluto is not a planet and the <br/>
Spanish RR is non-existent in many a Spanish dictionary. What is the <br/>
world coming to?!?!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936793746">Only on the second pass did I realize I had the need to address that many words cannot be identified as one of the eight &quot;parts of speech&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Just as &quot;dove&quot; can be both a noun and a verb,  &quot;dive&quot; has the same quality.    Need I give a definition of &quot;dive&quot; as a noun?<br/>
