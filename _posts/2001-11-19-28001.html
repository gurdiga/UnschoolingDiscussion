<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770356112">My best friend from Louisiana got involved in NLP. . .Neuro Linguistic <br/>
Programming (I&#39;m pretty sure this is the actual name). I don&#39;t know exactly <br/>
how it works. . . I don&#39;t want to even try to explain it, because its been so <br/>
long since I even talked to her about it. But I know she got rid of all her <br/>
allergies using this technique and even stopped wearing glasses as her <br/>
eyesight improved dramatically. She then began to use it in her profession <br/>
and has helped lots of people. I have never had allergies, nor have my <br/>
children so we never tried it. Her son had a fairly severe peanut allergy <br/>
that was gotten rid of.<br/>
<br/>
I know it involves going back in time in a meditative type thing and finding <br/>
a trigger point on your body that you can then use. . . but more than that I <br/>
can&#39;t really say. For instance, I know she had pretty bad allergy to cats. <br/>
When the NLP was done, she found out how far back it went, and what the <br/>
trigger was that led to it, and healed herself of it. THey now have about 5 <br/>
cats running around the house.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to post about it in case anyone is interested, they could <br/>
probably find a practioner in their area. . . I know there were several in <br/>
Louisiana, so I suspect its pretty common. . . .I would guess massage <br/>
therapists would be a good place to start looking, or probalby the Net as <br/>
well.<br/>
