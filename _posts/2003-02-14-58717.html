 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  This is what I&#39;ve been struggling with recently.  I&#39;ve let my son<br/>
choose, and he had been making the choice to play pacman on his gameboy<br/>
almost constantly, a choice that left him frustrated and crying, but unable<br/>
to quit.  I gave him time, and let him play, figuring he needed it.<br/>
<br/>
I know why my son is not happy, he&#39;s been very sad with his father gone this<br/>
particular time.  Sad to the point of depression.  To the extent that I have<br/>
some seriously concerned friends.   (He&#39;s 6, by the way.)<br/>
<br/>
But it eventually reached a point where I simply stepped in and removed the<br/>
gameboy.  Calmly put it up and told him I think he desperately needed a<br/>
break.  He asked once where I was, and I told him.  He didn&#39;t go get it, and<br/>
it hasn&#39;t been mentioned in over a week.  He could have it whenever he wants<br/>
it now, but it&#39;s as though the spell has been broken.  He isn&#39;t needing it<br/>
right now, or perhaps he&#39;s far enough away that he sees what happened.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m spending most of my energy and time with him now.  Yes, I pulled the<br/>
plug and cut him off.  I did the regulating.  I&#39;ve struggled many times with<br/>
whether that was the right decision, although it wasn&#39;t made lightly.  But<br/>
we&#39;re doing a lot more things together.  I have a lot less personal time, a<br/>
lot less time when he plays alone, and I feel it.  It&#39;s tiring, emotionally<br/>
for me.  <br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s helping, and that&#39;s been wonderful.  He&#39;s much more like himself,<br/>
and more fun to be with.  He&#39;s happier and doesn&#39;t cry so easily and<br/>
frequently.  I cannot imagine deciding that it wasn&#39;t worth the time spent<br/>
or effort I&#39;ve made, or thinking that he&#39;s old enough to do it himself.<br/>
<br/>
I felt like I was losing my son to this creeping darkness.  That&#39;s very<br/>
different than deciding that video games are evil and so I will limit them.<br/>
That&#39;s not deciding that even though a child is happy with them, that 2<br/>
hours a day is enough.  I think there&#39;s a point where you&#39;re only<br/>
considering the child, and ignoring your opinion of the games, the tv,<br/>
whatever, and making a decision based on the child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676634439">I think it also might have to do with a kid not being able to envision <br/>
what else to do with himself - when he&#39;s grieving, especially. <br/>
Something that occupies his mind - like gameboy - at least puts that <br/>
grief into the background - when he stops playing it, that sadness is <br/>
what pops into the foreground and it is hard, then, to get excited <br/>
about doing something new. Easier to just pick up the gameboy (or <br/>
whatever) and push the troubles back out of the way again.<br/>
<br/>
The way  you handled, it Brenda, reminded me of  how we started <br/>
homeschooling in the first place &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I calmly reached in and said, &quot;Let&#39;s just put school up on the shelf <br/>
for a while and see how things go without it.&quot; My oldest child was <br/>
actually pretty unhappy about that - she couldn&#39;t imagine how she was <br/>
going to be able to have any friends if she didn&#39;t go to school and she <br/>
LOVED her teacher and lots of stuff about school. I asked her to give <br/>
it 6 months and promised that she could choose to go back then. I <br/>
insisted on it. She did not actually agree, but I just moved on as if <br/>
she had agreed because I just KNEW she&#39;d be happier and it would change <br/>
her life in a major way, for the better.  I was right and, just like <br/>
his gameboy, school sat on the shelf and she always knew she could <br/>
choose it (although the analogy falls apart here - since she really <br/>
couldn&#39;t just keep taking it down and putting it up  - on an <br/>
hourly/daily basis - like he could with the gameboy).<br/>
