<div id="ygrps-yiv-719519447">Interestingly enough, I was browsing through a copy of &quot;Raising a <br/>
Healthy Child in Spite of Your Doctor&quot; that I picked up recently and <br/>
thoroughly enjoyed what Dr. Mendelsohn had to say about spanking and <br/>
parental roles. His chapter on &quot;What to expect of your child&quot; says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children must, of course, be guided toward responsible adult <br/>
behavior, but parents shouldn&#39;t expect them to achieve it all at <br/>
once.  Nor is there any convincing evidence that it can be <br/>
effectively achieved by emplying the old maxim &quot;spare the rod and <br/>
spoil the child.&quot;  Corporal punishment at  any age confuses and <br/>
traumatizes the child, because he can&#39;t understand why the mother and <br/>
father he loves, and who are supposed to love him, are suddenly <br/>
raging at him and causing physical pain.  He is made to feel <br/>
insecure, resentful, and even worthless, and the consequence may be <br/>
psychological harm.<br/>
The impact of physical punishment on child deveolpment has been <br/>
studied extensively, and the consensus of this research is that <br/>
violence damages both parent and child.  It fails to teach children <br/>
WHAT TO DO and yields only temporary benefits, if that, in teaching <br/>
them WHAT NOT TO DO.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wise words imo.<br/>
