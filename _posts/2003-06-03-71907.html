<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really that *I&#39;m* concerned about... but I know that the evaluators in my <br/>
area very much have the mentality of what a child should know when.  I have <br/>
chosen 2 potential evaluators and I have been encouraging them to understand <br/>
that whatever my boys *don&#39;t* know is not because they aren&#39;t smart enough to <br/>
know it... it&#39;s because they haven&#39;t run into it yet.  My boys know how to find <br/>
information... they are thinking individuals... they are VERY verbal and <br/>
amazing when it comes to figuring out stuff.  Just this past month I was convinced <br/>
that I needed to start them with the Calvert curriculum.  I almost bought <br/>
it... then thought, &quot;What am I doing... I am not going to use Calvert any <br/>
differently than any other curric we have&quot;.  My boys use Hooked on Phonics on their <br/>
own... they do the Spelling Workout books  (I was heavy into the Well Trained <br/>
Mind last year.. bought all the books   : )   They enjoy doing math workbooks... <br/>
they are really doing AWESOME by my standard.  Unfortunately, I must answer <br/>
to a higher authority.  I am not very creative in the sense of creating a <br/>
portfolio out of what we have done.  I am more of a &quot;here is my kid... go ahead... <br/>
evaluate him&quot; but the law in Florida is that the portfolio gets evaluated, not <br/>
the child.  The homeschoolers I know down here are very &quot;school&quot; minded.  A <br/>
lot of the women think I made up the term &quot;unschool&quot; just to justify what we <br/>
*don&#39;t* do.    I am a rebel to them.  My kids don&#39;t know geography well enough <br/>
to hang in our group&#39;s geography B... but they are well enough adjusted to <br/>
particpate and get every answer wrong and not hate themselves for it  : )   They <br/>
understand that they are not *failing* just because they don&#39;t yet know <br/>
something.  And.. they take opportunities like that to learn from the correct answers <br/>
that they hear.  I just don&#39;t know anyone in person who does things the way I <br/>
do, so although I have not changed how we do things over the years, I am <br/>
easily made to feel insecure about it.   ~Kris<br/>

   Hi. Just wanted to let you know that evaluation is not the only option in <br/>
Florida. You can also sign up with an umbrella school if you don&#39;t want to <br/>
deal with the county. Here are a couple of links with Florida umbrella schools <br/>
listed:  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/regional/FloridaUmbrella.htm&quot;">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/regional/FloridaUmbrella.htm&quot;</a>&gt;Florida Umbrella Schools - A to Z Home&#39;s Cool Homeschooling in Florida&lt;/A&gt;  <br/>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.educationalfreedom.com/heart/pages/private.html&quot;">http://www.educationalfreedom.com/heart/pages/private.html&quot;</a>&gt;HEART Private School Directory for Florida&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
<br/>
    If you sign up with an umbrella school you will not be considered a <br/>
homeschooler but would be signed up under a private school. These are not all <br/>
expensive (some are free) and vary in what they offer and the accountability you <br/>
have to provide.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

<br/>
Have you also thought about all the other incredible ways they are <br/>
learning besides with the workbooks? Have you thought it out in your <br/>
own mind? Are you really seeing what they get in bits and pieces that <br/>
goes way beyond geography Bee&#39;s and spelling? <br/>
<br/>
When you can really see that in your own mind, coming up with <br/>
portfolio items will probably be easier.<br/>

<br/>
We just had a portfolio discussion here if you want to go look in the <br/>
archives for a few days back. A portfolio doesn&#39;t need to be fancy. <br/>
Just keep photos, library lists, video lists, copies of stories or <br/>
artwork, ticket stubs from museums or shows, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Florida isn&#39;t tough to unschool in from what we&#39;ve heard from other <br/>
unschoolrs there. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be along soon with the details.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you also thought about all the other incredible ways they are <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup... all the time   : )   Guess that&#39;s why I am really not concentrating <br/>
very much on doing a portfolio with anything other than workbooks.  I am a &quot;stop <br/>
and smell the roses&quot; kind of mom... not a &quot;stop and get it recorded&quot; one.  I <br/>
suppose I need to learn to be both.  We were just down at the bay collecting <br/>
shells and holding sea cucumbers, starfish, crabs and several other creatures.  <br/>
My boys were finding skeletons of various things and we had a great time.  <br/>
So, now what?  Take a picture of what we found?  Have the boys draw pictures of <br/>
what they found?  Seems so &quot;bubble-gummish&quot; compared to the actual learning <br/>
and growing that took place, know what I mean?  My 6 year old son was explaining <br/>
how &quot;rare it is find a shell like this this small&quot;.  THAT is true learning.  <br/>
So, I suppose my issue with compliance to the law isn&#39;t that we aren&#39;t doing <br/>
enough, it&#39;s that it is all recorded in mine and my children&#39;s minds and <br/>
hearts.  I am looking for an evaluator who will check there  : ) ~Kris <br/>

Do you usually take family pictures? Use those. Explain to the <br/>
evaluator what you were doing and what you observed them learning.<br/>
<br/>
I notice Ren and others come on with the advice about an umbrella <br/>
school. I think that sound like the easiest alternative.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I am not very creative in the sense of creating a <br/>
&gt; portfolio out of what we have done. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither was I. I posed this question last week and got some good suggestions.<br/>
I dont know much about FL but this is what I did.<br/>
<br/>
I made a binder of photos we had.  Some of the photos where of Dustin Surfing <br/>
(Gym and Science),on his go cart,(gym and science) at Chuck E Cheese for his <br/>
sisters party (Math and public speaking), On the computer (English, Spelling, <br/>
Math, History, Art and Science) and a photo of him and the pups and how he was <br/>
training them and had taught one or both Sit, lay down, to pee on command, <br/>
Kennel up, fetch and others.<br/>
<br/>
I listed books he has read. Brought the testing that he had done at the <br/>
beginning of the year told her that reading was 1.9 and then showed several books <br/>
he chose to read. (she was pretty impressed with this and the other parents <br/>
where jaw dropped).<br/>
<br/>
I brought a science book 101 Science Experiments that he had picked out and <br/>
told her he was shooting rockets off the deck and had tried other mixtures. <br/>
<br/>
Meals he had cooked (Math, Science and reading)<br/>
<br/>
Computer games he has and uses.<br/>
<br/>
I brought some mini photo&#39;s of things Dustin has sold on Ebay and a full <br/>
print out of our 142 100% positive ratings. I told her he has his own Paypal card <br/>
(second off of my account, yes its legal for him to have one) and balances his <br/>
funds, uses the card and uses some HTML for the listings.<br/>
<br/>
A shed he and his Dad built with photo&#39;s and the flooring they laid down. <br/>
(Math)<br/>
<br/>
For History he read many books, watched Fox, CNN, History Channel, read some <br/>
in his old Text book, visited some places in Maine and NH.<br/>
<br/>
Other places we have gone is to Town Meetings which falls under many subjects <br/>
but was a good one for health because it was about a Sober Home that someone <br/>
wanted to add to our town and brought on great debate. This lead to many <br/>
things he looked into.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t list what subjects I thought all these fell into I just told her <br/>
what we did over the year. I told her I really was pleased at his new love for <br/>
reading this year and that in itself was all I had wished for.<br/>
<br/>
The 15 min went by so fast I had actually forgotten some stuff. She didn&#39;t <br/>
look at any of the papers, I held the book of photo&#39;s up for all to see (group <br/>
of 5-6 parents). <br/>
When I was out of words I asked if there was anything I have missed and she <br/>
said no you covered it all.  I was so nervous when I was done my hands where <br/>
numb.<br/>
<br/>
When I began to talk I said &quot;Now I may be on the radical side of Unschooling. <br/>
This works for us and I&#39;ll show you how&quot; I said that because I followed <br/>
someone who said they Unschooled but forced piano on both kids and had this huge <br/>
box of text books and units they had done.  <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck on yours, please let us know how it turned out.<br/>

Only if they really want to draw a picture!!! If not, take plenty of<br/>
pictures and put those in the portfolio. Easy as that!!!<br/>
