<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699338522">If you don&#39;t mind sharing this with me ... someone made this statement..<br/>
<br/>
btw: In our household, there are no chores, no TV limits, no limits <br/>
besides self imposed ones. <br/>
<br/>
Does this mean that you do all the chores or that the kids participate willingly?  My kids are young - but I would like them to grow up and participate as family members... the unschooling mindset would seem to suggest you wouldn&#39;t use a &quot;chore list/chart&quot; or have consequences for things not done - <br/>
<br/>
I have a question about this - as I have an issue with this in my life- in my household there is this problem... my husband likes everything really neat (insanely neat) - he pitches in and definitely does more than his &quot;fair&quot; share - but as far as the kids go there is this stress. I don&#39;t tend to have them pick up everything.... books are everywhere. If we are working on a project, I have no problem leaving it out.. etc.  I have little ones, and they seem to make incredible messes - and I could go  crazy running around and picking up after them.... but when dad comes home - instead of dinner and fun and games it is a major clean-up which just ends in tears for all involved...  <br/>
<br/>
So what are the suggestions here - as far as having kids do chores, or being responsible for their &quot;room&quot;. I have heard from many people that in order for kids to learn to do these things and take control of their belongings, etc they need to be made to do chores - however small they may be... I just have not been organized enough to do this - it seems quicker for me to just do it - which doesn&#39;t seem to help the overall situation....<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions......<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

  &gt;I think the people on this list handle the idea of chores in a lot of <br/>
  &gt;different ways.  I think I&#39;m somewhere near the middle.  I do insist on one <br/>
  &gt;kitchen chore daily.<br/>

  This is interesting considering the flavour of the topics in the past <br/>
  week. I&#39;m going to use this line as an example, but I&#39;m not saying that <br/>
  its only the mindset of Tia. <br/>
<br/>
  Okay, let me walk through my thought process and you can let me know if <br/>
  you see the same two-sided monster that I do.<br/>
<br/>
  Everything is learning, hence life itself is educational.<br/>
<br/>
  A parent chooses to enforce one &#39;rule&#39; such as a chore, yet finds issue <br/>
  with any other enforcements such as TV control.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, doesn&#39;t that then make every  idea fall under people being allowed <br/>
  to be somewhere in the middle and still be considered an unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
  thoughts please,<br/>

  btw: In our household, there are no chores, no TV limits, no limits <br/>
  besides self imposed ones. This is all purely in theory as to why I ask.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The self-imposed restrictions are from trial and error.<br/>
<br/>
My son was 4ish when I gave him full reign of his room. He subsequently <br/>
turned it into an area that was impossible to walk through. He soon <br/>
realized that he couldn&#39;t find most pieces to his toys and suffered for <br/>
months.<br/>
 <br/>
Eventually he asked me to help him and I did. We cleaned it up and <br/>
organized the mess. It took 3 days and lots of plastic bins. As we did <br/>
this, I discussed with him how he could choose to put away things before <br/>
he moved onto the next.<br/>
<br/>
Now thats what he does and he&#39;s quite happy to find all his stuff. The <br/>
fact that the plastic bins, drawer and other storage helpers are around <br/>
makes it a breeze to put back together.<br/>
<br/>
If he makes a mess that a bit overwhelming, he might ask me to help and I <br/>
do. Because we ask eachother for help.<br/>
<br/>
I might be up in the bedroom and ask him to bring me something. He does <br/>
most of the time. But he knows he isn&#39;t obligated and will tell me, I <br/>
can&#39;t or I&#39;m busy if he is.<br/>
<br/>
Its something that has evolved out of letting him see how things work one <br/>
way and how things work another way.<br/>
<br/>
He helps me cook some things. But only certain things that he likes. And <br/>
as far as cleaning, we pick up our plates from the table, or floor where <br/>
we ate and put them in the sink. I might ask him to put the trash bag in <br/>
the can and he is glad to help.<br/>
<br/>
As far as bedtime. He chooses his own. And its usually very late. Between <br/>
11-1. Because we have a family bed, sometimes he waits up for me and <br/>
sometimes he goes to bed just because I am. There&#39;s no set rules about it.<br/>
<br/>
He needs to be at basketball by 9am on Saturday. So after a many weeks of <br/>
feeling icky in the morning, he finally said to me &#39;I&#39;m going to go to <br/>
bed at 10 on the night before basketball&#39;. This was self-declared and it <br/>
just happened this past weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it will take a few more months to realize that he can&#39;t choose 10 on <br/>
one night and 1 on the other nights because he&#39;ll never get to sleep on <br/>
the 10 night. So in the next few weeks, I will discuss this with him when <br/>
the issue comes up. I don&#39;t have an agenda about it. It will just happen.<br/>
<br/>
TV is something that I don&#39;t mind him watching. But most of the time its <br/>
MY fault that he might watch it too much. Either I&#39;m not offering <br/>
environmental stimulation or I&#39;m to under the weather to.  When he has <br/>
options, he chooses the best one for him.<br/>
<br/>
His father can&#39;t understand why he would rather watch TV than go to work <br/>
with him. But he hasn&#39;t quite caught up with the whole unschooling thing. <br/>
He thinks that the kid just wants to watch TV. He hasn&#39;t put together the <br/>
options he&#39;s offering.<br/>
<br/>
If I walk over and say &#39;lets go to the zoo and carasel (sp)&#39;, the kid is <br/>
dressed and bugging me to leave.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that gives you a good idea what I mean by self-imposed. And at <br/>
this point I am unschooling my son and my unhusband. The latter being a <br/>
bit harder since his brain is way hardwired in one direction :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726390109">Hi<br/>
Heather asked about chores. As a new unschooler I have no idea whether or<br/>
not this fits under the cover of &#39;unschooling&#39; (!!!) but this is what works<br/>
for us. My kids have the whole day to do their thing. But there are 2 times<br/>
designated as &#39;tidy-up time&#39; - 8h00 and 17h30. (Oh, and the older kids clear<br/>
up after meals.)<br/>
This because I become tense and stressed if my home is always upside down.<br/>
So at those times, whoever is home pitches in and tidies up whatever is out<br/>
of place. At all other times<br/>
(unless mother-in-law is coming for tea!!!) I ignore the mess and let them<br/>
live.<br/>
The children didn&#39;t have much say in deciding this; it was instituted when<br/>
the first was a baby. It has become one of our family habits, and generally<br/>
it works without problems.<br/>
There is a lot of focus on the list about respecting and trusting children -<br/>
this has been wonderful.However, I also feel that my children need to<br/>
consider me. So whether or not it is what they would chose, there are some<br/>
things that really infringe on my enjoyment of our home, and I therefore<br/>
expect them to be sensitive to this in the same way as what I try to be<br/>
sensitive to their needs.<br/>
Comments from any &#39;experienced&#39;  unschoolers?<br/>
Regards<br/>
Cathy</div>
