<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550648363">&lt;whew!... about those pliers). I agree.. neutering will make a big <br/>
difference in the <br/>
dog.<br/>
 <br/>
(for the inqui-ree..) <br/>
Get lots of little doggie treats and reward the good behavior and <br/>
ignore the bad. <br/>
Most dogs want to please their owners and will do what it takes to <br/>
get your love.<br/>
Crate training is very effective if done properly. The dog needs to <br/>
find it a <br/>
pleasurable thing to be in the crate and not a punishment. Since this <br/>
particular dog <br/>
has had a bad experience with the crate, you may have difficulty <br/>
changing his mind <br/>
about a crate but I&#39;d at least try *really* hard.  Maybe new bedding <br/>
and toys in it <br/>
would help along with putting him in for very short periods of time. <br/>
(do *not* <br/>
reward him by letting him out if he is barking and not behaving as <br/>
you&#39;d like). <br/>
Good luck<br/>
