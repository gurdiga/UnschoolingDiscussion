I hope that you will take this with the respect with which it is intended.<br/>
I&#39;m a fairly religious Jew, and I&#39;m also a molecular biologist by training.<br/>
I was on a curriculum development project a few summers ago writing the<br/>
segment on the origin of life, and read more of the primary scientific<br/>
literature than anyone probably really needs to.<br/>
<br/>
Scientifically, I&#39;m sorry to have to inform you, there really is no gray<br/>
area.  We use the word &quot;theory&quot; differently in science than we do in general<br/>
parlance.  Gravity, in science, is also a theory, but we don&#39;t hear people<br/>
arguing that alternate views should be taught (well, okay, if you want to<br/>
include general relativity, then fine, but that&#39;s not an alternate view,<br/>
just an expanded one).  The word &quot;theory&quot; in general parlance is more like<br/>
the scientific word &quot;hypothesis,&quot; which means educated guess, reasonable<br/>
possibility according to the data still present.  For something to be a<br/>
scientific theory, it generally means that the data present overwhelming<br/>
support for it, to the point where there really aren&#39;t any other reasonable<br/>
and testable hypotheses.  Evolution is about as close to a fact as we<br/>
scientists are willing to call anything that we cannot directly observe<br/>
because we don&#39;t have a time machine handy.  We do certainly observe change<br/>
in species over time happening in real time right now.  We also certainly<br/>
observe evolution occurring in test-tube situations, and it is beginning to<br/>
be used as a technique for &quot;designing&quot; useful things.  The people who<br/>
propose alternate hypotheses don&#39;t have data to back them up, and are<br/>
basically just creationists trying to use scientific-sounding language in<br/>
the hopes of being taken seriously by scientists and sneaking the Christian<br/>
version of creation into biology texts.  Just because something is phrased<br/>
like a hypothesis doesn&#39;t mean that it is testable (which is a requirement<br/>
in the scientific world), nor does it mean that it has any data to support<br/>
it.  Not all hypotheses are worthy of equal time, because they&#39;re not all<br/>
equally likely to be true.  There are a variety of different hypotheses<br/>
within the basic evolutionary hypotheses (steady state vs. punctuated<br/>
equilibrium, etc), but none of them require the presence of a conscious<br/>
Creator.<br/>
<br/>
(1) Natural selection is *not* actually a biological process.  It is a<br/>
mathematical and thermodynamic one, and *no one* (not even the<br/>
fundamentalists) is disputing the mathematical and thermodynamic laws (they<br/>
are so certain as to be actually called &quot;laws&quot;) which give rise to it.<br/>
Here&#39;s how it works:<br/>
<br/>
(a) Any time there is an object which can replicate itself, it is using<br/>
energy to resist entropy (disorder).  Things are naturally disordered;<br/>
making a copy of yourself is creating order and hence costs energy to do.<br/>
The Second Law of Thermodynamics says, &quot;The amount of useful energy<br/>
available in any system always goes down -- some useful energy is always<br/>
lost.  In short, not only can&#39;t you win (the First Law), you can&#39;t even<br/>
break even.&quot;  To make a perfect copy every time would require spending<br/>
infinite energy, which is not  available.  Therefore, it is a thermodynamic<br/>
*certainty* that some copies will be imperfect in random ways (the random<br/>
mutations of Darwinian evolution).<br/>
<br/>
(b) Any time there is an object which can replicate itself, the number of<br/>
objects of this type will grow (or shrink) exponentially (faster and faster,<br/>
y = pe^(rt), the number of individuals at any time is the number you started<br/>
with times the number e=2.71828... to the power of the intrinsic rate of<br/>
growth over time, times the time that has passed).  That&#39;s the mathematical<br/>
law of exponential growth, which is derived easily in any Algebra II class.<br/>
You take advantage of this law every time you put money in the bank -- in<br/>
finance, it&#39;s called &quot;the law (or the miracle) of compound interest.&quot;  Even<br/>
for very small intrinsic rates of growth (I won&#39;t go into it here, but<br/>
suffice it to say that the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the mathematical<br/>
principle of trichotomy make it impossible to have a growth rate of exactly<br/>
zero), any population of self-replicating objects will eventually produce<br/>
more and more individuals (or die out completely, if the growth rate is<br/>
negative).  Eventually, *any* self-replicating population will grow to the<br/>
point where there is not enough of *some* resource (typically food, which<br/>
contains the energy the critters need to continue resisting entropy) to go<br/>
around.  This was Malthus&#39;s big insight.  No one is disputing it.<br/>
<br/>
(c) Any time where there are more individuals wanting a resource than there<br/>
is resource to go around, they will compete for it.  This is known in<br/>
economics as the law of supply and demand.  Those who have more of whatever<br/>
skills or other resources they need to get the limited resource, well,<br/>
they&#39;re the ones who will get it.  It&#39;s just like when there aren&#39;t enough<br/>
Tickle Me Elmo dolls to go around: people with more money and more quickness<br/>
and more shrewdness about where dolls might be located are the ones who get<br/>
the dolls.  When there&#39;s not enough food, the critters who are better able<br/>
to locate, move to, and utilize the energy sources in the environment are<br/>
the ones who will be more likely get the energy they need to survive and<br/>
reproduce.  Because there is variation in the population (part (a) of this<br/>
argument), whatever biological or behavioral variations make their owners<br/>
lucky enough to get more bananas than the guy next door, well, those are the<br/>
ones you&#39;ll see more of in the next generation, because the guy next door<br/>
*died*.  There isn&#39;t room for everyone to win.  Again, no one disputes this<br/>
mathematical law.<br/>
<br/>
This is the basic cycle of natural selection.  Two mathematical laws and a<br/>
thermodynamic law, none of which are in dispute in any even remotely<br/>
scientific circles.  Repeat the cycle a few million times, and the<br/>
population gradually refines to be better able to take advantage of whatever<br/>
resources are available.  All sorts of weird things show up (both complex<br/>
structures and complex behaviors), but it didn&#39;t take either a God or a<br/>
Watchmaker or an inscrutable space alien to make them show up.<br/>
<br/>
So why don&#39;t we get watches and Mount Rushmores appearing out of nowhere?<br/>
Because metal bits and rocks don&#39;t have self-replicating machinery.  Those<br/>
critters that *do* have self-replicating machinery *do* in fact have watches<br/>
(as you know when you feel jet-lagged flying across time zones), not to<br/>
mention calendars (as you know when you see geese flying south for the<br/>
winter), and funny faces (like the Japanese crabs with angry samurai faces<br/>
on their shells (which Carl Sagan showed in the classic Cosmos videos) as<br/>
well as countless species of fish and butterflies).  Indeed, those watches,<br/>
calendars, and funny faces could *easily* have arisen through the process of<br/>
natural selection.  Once you have the ability to self-replicate, the whole<br/>
rest of the game follows without your being able to stop it.<br/>
<br/>
(2) Proponents of creationism, er, intelligent design theory often say that<br/>
we have no experimental evidence to show this process occurring.  When<br/>
pressed with evidence of real-time observable evolution such as the obvious<br/>
changes in bacterial antibiotic resistance in recent decades, the change in<br/>
frequency of dark and light morphs of the peppered moth during the<br/>
Industrial Revolution, and cute examples like the samurai crabs, they<br/>
backtrack.  They choose some complex structure, such as the flagellum<br/>
mentioned by your guest today, and state without proof that it is too<br/>
complex to have arisen without an intelligent designer, and further state<br/>
without reference to the scientific literature that there is no scientific<br/>
evidence to support any possibility of its having arisen by chance.<br/>
<br/>
(a) Actually, cytoskeletal structures like flagella are tremendously simple;<br/>
much of their apparently complex structure and behavior arises through very<br/>
simple mathematical laws (which I will be happy to explain if you are<br/>
interested).  In fact, most biological structures are surprisingly simple<br/>
and inevitable when you look at them with a mathematical eye.  The classic<br/>
book in this area is &quot;On Growth and Form&quot; by d&#39;Arcy Wentworth Thompson.<br/>
Even the abridged version is rather thick reading, but you might try reading<br/>
&quot;Life&#39;s Devices&quot; or the even easier &quot;Cat&#39;s Paws and Catapults,&quot; both by<br/>
Steven Vogel.<br/>
<br/>
(b) In computer science, self-replicating computer programs with initially<br/>
random code have been shown to evolve through natural selection.  Not only<br/>
do we see increased efficiency in their use of system resources, but we also<br/>
see complex behaviors such as predation, parasitism, cooperation, betrayal,<br/>
sexual reproduction (one of the best ways nature has found to increase the<br/>
variability in the population and hence speed a population&#39;s evolution!),<br/>
and so forth, all arising by chance.  It&#39;s wild.  If you want to learn more<br/>
about this, do a search on the topic &quot;artificial life&quot; on the web, or read<br/>
the book, &quot;Artificial Life&quot; by Steven Levy or the many other books on the<br/>
topic.  They&#39;re quite readable.<br/>
<br/>
(c) In the test tube, biochemists are doing experiments to answer the<br/>
question of whether living critters could evolve from nonliving Campbell&#39;s<br/>
Primordial Soup purely by the mathematical process of natural selection.<br/>
You think that scientists are satisfied with only studying life as it<br/>
exists, without caring about how it got started?  Don&#39;t be silly.  The field<br/>
is currently called &quot;astrobiology,&quot; because many of the scientists are<br/>
trying to figure out how likely it might be that intelligent life has<br/>
evolved on other planets as well as trying to figure out how it might have<br/>
started here.  Take a look at www.astrobiology.com or<br/>
www.astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov to get the basics and to meet some of the key<br/>
players.  Here are some of the kicker experiments.  Jack Szostak started<br/>
with random short RNA molecules (which could plausibly have existed in the<br/>
soup), and showed that natural selection alone produced a population which<br/>
could draw energy from nucleotide triphosphates (the universal energy<br/>
currency for life today) and which could use that energy to join together<br/>
oligonucleotides into longer chains.  In 2001, scientists at MIT used<br/>
test-tube evolution to produce a form of RNA that can reproduce itself with<br/>
95% accuracy.  Other scientists have had plenty of success using test-tube<br/>
evolution to select for various resource usage and other important<br/>
behaviors.  And folks are homing on on how those nucleotides could have<br/>
arisen in the first place through random chemical reactions that could<br/>
reasonably have occurred on the early Earth.  In other words, science *has*<br/>
a plausible answer to the question, one that we are actively testing and<br/>
refining.<br/>
<br/>
The more we learn about life, the more it looks like it&#39;s a mathematical<br/>
certainty for life to occur, even in the harshest environments.  We don&#39;t<br/>
need to imagine a God or a friendly space alien or a soul of the universe<br/>
(where did *they* come from, anyway?) to have plausible and testable<br/>
scientific hypotheses about how life could have evolved from nonlife.  We<br/>
certainly don&#39;t need to give equal classroom time to so-called &quot;theories&quot;<br/>
that have no more scientific status than the &quot;theory&quot; that there&#39;s a little<br/>
man hiding in the Coke machine dispensing soda.<br/>
<br/>
All living critters are caught up in a mathematical cycle: they replicate,<br/>
the replications have variations, the variations make them more or less able<br/>
to compete for resources, which affects how likely the different varieties<br/>
are to be able to replicate in the next cycle.  It&#39;s not really something<br/>
that you can escape from unless you start positing an all-powerful Supreme<br/>
Being who tampers with things and tries to trick you into believing in<br/>
evolution when it&#39;s actually false.  However, God is not a testable<br/>
hypothesis.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the reasons people have a hard time accepting evolution is<br/>
because of the amazing variety of structures and functions which are present<br/>
in the many varied ecosystems of this planet.  It *is* truly amazing, and<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s hard to imagine that sort of variety and excellence of design<br/>
without imagining a watchmaker.  It&#39;s hard to imagine because our everyday<br/>
experience doesn&#39;t lead us to much understanding of large numbers (read the<br/>
excellent book _Innumeracy_ by John Allen Paulos), but when you&#39;re more<br/>
comfortable with the large numbers involved, it becomes a lot easier to see<br/>
how things that look intelligently designed could in fact have come about<br/>
through a very long process of chance.  (To refute one of the more common<br/>
arguments, more and more, scientists are demonstrating how partially-formed<br/>
versions of things (for instance, an insect wing that wasn&#39;t strong enough<br/>
to permit actual flight) could still confer a selective advantage (for<br/>
instance, by allowing the bug to skitter very fast across the surface of the<br/>
water)).<br/>
<br/>
That said, how does that fit in with the Biblical version of creation?  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve heard lots of people suggest that if you simply redefine the<br/>
length of a &quot;day,&quot; then everything&#39;s fine.  But it&#39;s not.  Things get<br/>
created in completely the wrong order.  It&#39;s a nice idea, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
really match with what science is pretty darned sure of.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, hard-nosed scientist hat off, spiritual hat on.  When I learn of a new<br/>
scientific discovery which shows me more of the incredible beauty and<br/>
diversity that has created itself according to the incredibly simple<br/>
mathematical laws of the cosmos, I am moved to say a blessing to God who set<br/>
such a wondrous self-creating system in motion.  Frankly, I am *more*<br/>
impressed by a God who built a self-creating system than I am by the image<br/>
of someone with a whole lot of Tinker Toys.<br/>
<br/>
Did things come about the way the Bible says?  Of course not.  Is it true?<br/>
Absolutely.  There&#39;s a big difference.  Mythological stories are the way we<br/>
tell ourselves about our world and ourselves, and they can have deep truth<br/>
to them without needing to have even a shred of literal truth.  Figure out<br/>
what you can learn about the world and your place within it from this text<br/>
and from what other people have said about it over the centuries -- that&#39;s<br/>
what&#39;s important about the story, not whether creation started on a Thursday<br/>
or a Sunday.<br/>

<br/>
My reaction to that post:<br/>
This item on evolution is a marvelous post.  In my experience, belief <br/>
in evolution can be a big stumbling block to a person&#39;s belief in <br/>
God.  But here is a scientist who doesn&#39;t let her belief in evolution <br/>
get in the way of her belief in God.  In fact, as she pursues <br/>
science, she discovers more to admire God for.  I appreciate and <br/>
agree with this approach.<br/>
<br/>
When Peggy posted this item, she did not include a reference to any <br/>
particular previous post, so it is hard to tell what she was arguing <br/>
for or against (although I have an idea) ;-). So for those who are <br/>
interested or who want to show their children how to look at both <br/>
sides of an issue, I have listed some points where a Christian non-<br/>
scientist who believes in the Biblical account of creation can agree <br/>
with a Jewish microbiologist who believes in a creator and <br/>
evolution.  I&#39;ve also noted some points of disagreement.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the author of that item has asked that it not be reposted <br/>

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Points of agreement  (author&#39;s statements are numbered, followed by <br/>
my agreement).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1. Natural selection is *not* actually a biological process. It is a <br/>
&gt;mathematical and thermodynamic one, and *no one* (not even the <br/>

&gt;give rise to it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True.  Creationists and evolutionists both believe in natural <br/>
selection.   You can see it at work, and you can see evidence of it <br/>
in the past.  Natural selection works within a species to help <br/>
organisms to adapt.  <br/>
<br/>
Note:  Creationists do not believe that natural selection can help an <br/>
organism evolve into another species. We all should be aware of what <br/>
someone means when they use the word evolution:  are they talking <br/>
about adaptation within a species, transformation to another species, <br/>
formation of life, or origin of the universe (claymation, as someone <br/>
cutely termed it earlier)?  &quot;Evolution is a fact&quot; can be quite <br/>
believable when referring to natural selection (adaptation), but much <br/>
less proven (or scientifically verifiable) when referring to the <br/>
origin of the universe. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2. How does that fit in with the Biblical version of creation? It <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True.  The Biblical account of creation does not describe evolution, <br/>
even if you just call each day so many thousands or millions of <br/>
years.  And the word for &quot;day&quot; in the Bible is the same word that is <br/>
used for a 24 hour day.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  3.  And folks are homing on on how those nucleotides could have <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True.  Science has a hypothesis that a reasonable person could <br/>
imagine happened, and scientists are testing it out to see if it will <br/>
work.  <br/>
<br/>
Note:  However, even if it does work, and reasonable mathematicians <br/>
agree that there is some chance of the random chemical reactions <br/>
creating life, it does not mean that it did happen that way.  And a <br/>
reasonable person will place less stock in it if the math equations <br/>
show a very small chance.  This is where many evolutionists are <br/>
unwilling to even consider the possibility of a young earth, because <br/>
then none of the millions of years needed for this hypothesis would <br/>
be present.  But young earth is a subject for another post on another <br/>
forum.  I&#39;ve already posted a number of URLs that address creation in <br/>
an earlier post.  E-mail me if you&#39;d like them.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  4.  The more we learn about life, the more it looks like it&#39;s a <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True.  Earth is the perfect place for life to occur.  The atmosphere <br/>
protects us from meteorites and provides oxygen, the distance from <br/>
the sun provides water in a liquid state (rather than gaseous or <br/>
frozen), and many other things.  As for &quot;even in the harshest <br/>
environments&quot;, she expands on that later in point 6, where she finds <br/>
that the laws of nature were created to cause life to occur.  Amen.<br/>
<br/>

on a Thursday or a Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
True, and I said the same thing in a post earlier.  I wholeheartedly <br/>
agree that the Bible accounts have great impact, whether they are <br/>
taken literally or allegorically.  I&#39;ve copied the URL for a web site <br/>
(there are many others) that says the same thing:  &quot;Will I approach <br/>
the Bible as God&#39;s message to me?&quot;  <br/>
http://www.salisburybible.org/Questions%20About%<br/>

just ignore any indication of a creator.  Some even admit that they <br/>
strive to defend evolution and ignore evidence for creation because <br/>
they can&#39;t face the fact that there might be a creator.  It is great <br/>
to read a post from a scientist who believes there is a creator and <br/>
who enjoys seeing his work.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yesterday an excellent item entitled &quot;Evolution&quot; was posted.  The <br/>
author is a Jewish scientist who believes in a creator and in <br/>
evolution.  Previously I posted six points of agreement with her, <br/>
even as a Christian non-scientist who does not believe in evolution.<br/>
<br/>
My wife told me I should have mentioned the link between Judaism and <br/>
Christianity, since Jesus was of Jewish descent and faith.  This <br/>
country was founded by firm believers in God through the Judeo-<br/>
Christian faith.  Jews and Christians share the same scriptures: the <br/>
Old Testament, as Rachel Ann mentioned, was passed intact from Jews <br/>
to Christians.  I believe that our Biblically-based Constitution and <br/>
laws are the reason our society has lasted longer than just about any <br/>
other democracy.<br/>
<br/>
The Jewish scientist closed with this quote about the Bible:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Did things come about the way the Bible says? Of course not. Is it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>true?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Absolutely.   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>In other words, the Bible is true, and we are just reading it wrong.  <br/>
Christians agree that the more the Bible is investigated, the more <br/>
accurate it is known to be, when interpreted correctly.  The problem <br/>
with evolutionary theory is that it doesn&#39;t even try to match to what <br/>
the Bible says.   <br/>
<br/>
Today I am posting some quotes from eminent scientists and <br/>
evolutionists (even microbiologists) who find weaknesses in the <br/>
evolutionary theory.  This is to answer the question, &quot;Since <br/>
evolution is scientific and all but proven, why all the fuss about <br/>
teaching creation?  Isn&#39;t evolution state-of-the-art science?&quot;  No, <br/>
there is still much debate inside and outside of scientific circles.  <br/>
It is not &quot;all but proven.&quot; Here are some quotes that show this, <br/>
compiled from the web page below.<br/>

&quot;So many essential conditions are necessary for life to exist on our <br/>
earth that it is mathematically impossible that all of them could <br/>
exist in proper relationship by chance on any one earth at one time.&quot;<br/>
-Dr. A. Cressy Morrison, past president of the New York Academy of <br/>
Sciences.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...contrary to what is widely assumed by evolutionary biologists <br/>
today, it has always been the anti-evolutionists, not the <br/>
evolutionists, in the scientific community who have stuck rigidly to <br/>
the facts and adhered to a more strictly empirical approach.&quot;<br/>
-Dr. Michael Denton, Evolution: A Theory in Crisis (London: Burnett <br/>
Books, 1985), p. 353, 354. (Note: Dr. Denton is neither a creationist <br/>
nor a Christian.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Biologists are simply naive when they talk about experiments <br/>
designed to test the theory of evolution. It is not testable. They <br/>
may happen to stumble across facts which would seem to conflict with <br/>
its predictions. These facts will invariably be ignored and their <br/>
discoverers will undoubtedly be deprived of continuing research <br/>
grants.&quot;<br/>
-Professor Whitten (Professor of Genetics), University of Melbourne, <br/>
Australia, 1980 Assembly Week address. <br/>
<br/>
...Every single concept advanced by the theory of evolution (and <br/>
amended hereafter) is imaginary as it is not supported by the <br/>
scientifically established facts of microbiology, fossils, and <br/>
mathematical probability concepts. Darwin was wrong. ...The theory of <br/>
evolution may be the worst mistake in science.&quot;<br/>
-I.L. Cohen, in Darwin Was Wrong - A Study in Probabilities.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do not be afraid of being free thinkers! If you think strongly <br/>
enough you will be forced by science to the belief in God, which is <br/>
the foundation of all religion. You will find science not <br/>
antagonistic but helpful to religion.&quot;<br/>
-Lord Kelvin, Father of Thermodynamics and modern Physics.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s such a deeply ingrained faith, such a strong dogma on which we <br/>
are all raised from an early age. Interestingly, I&#39;ve read a number <br/>
of biographies of scientists who are leaders in both creationist and <br/>
evolutionary thought. The overwhelming trend is that the leaders of <br/>
evolutionary thought all make their living purely from evolutionary <br/>
theory. They are &#39;specialists in evolution&#39; and there is no way that <br/>
you could see how someone whose entire life and reputation and <br/>
livelihood were bound up with the theory could turn against it. On <br/>
the other hand, the leaders of the creationist movement usually have <br/>
made a name for themselves in some area of fundamental and applied <br/>
science -- real science -- before moving into creation science.&quot;<br/>
-Kouznetsov, in Dr. Carl Wieland, &quot;Interview with Dr. Dmitri <br/>
Kouznetsov,&quot; Creation Ex Nihilo, Vol. 14, No. 1, p. 36. <br/>
<br/>
An ACLU member says:<br/>
&quot;For the past five years, I have closely followed creationist <br/>
literature and have attended lectures and debates on related <br/>
issues.... based solely on the scientific arguments pro and con, I <br/>
have been forced to conclude that scientific creationism is not only <br/>
a viable theory, but that it has achieved parity with (if not <br/>
superiority over) the normative theory of biological evolution. That <br/>
this should now be the case is somewhat surprising, particularly in <br/>
view of what most of us were taught in primary and secondary school.<br/>
In practical terms, the past decade of intense activity by scientific <br/>
creationists has left most evolutionist professors unwilling to <br/>
debate the creationist professors. Too many of the evolutionists have <br/>
been publicly humiliated in such debates by their own lack of <br/>
erudition and by the weaknesses of their theory.&quot;<br/>
-Robert E. Smith, &quot;Origins and Civil Liberties,&quot; in Creation Social <br/>
Sciences and Humanities Quarterly, 3 (Winter 1980): 23-24.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At this point the war centering around Darwinism and its control <br/>
over the scientific discussion of origins is going well for the <br/>
creationists, and evolution is being defeated in many battles.&quot;<br/>
-Dr. Paul D. Ackerman, It&#39;s a Young World After All (Grand Rapids: <br/>
Baker Book House, 1986), p. 12.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When confronted with the marvels of life and the universe, one must <br/>
ask why and not just how. The only possible answers are religious. <br/>
For me that means Protestant Christianity, to which I was introduced <br/>
as a child and which has withstood the tests of a lifetime. But <br/>
religion is a great backyard for doing science. In the words of Psalm <br/>
19, &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth <br/>
His handiwork.&quot; Thus scientific research is a worshipful act in that <br/>
it reveals the wonders of God&#39;s creation.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270028784">Another addendum. <br/>
<br/>
There have been alterations between the what Christians call the Old Testement and what the Jews call the Torah.   They may seem minor to some but the significantly affect the philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember any off hand, but even a good translation of the Torah does not convey perfectly, the meaning of the text.<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>
<br/>
  My wife told me I should have mentioned the link between Judaism and <br/>
  Christianity, since Jesus was of Jewish descent and faith.  This <br/>
  country was founded by firm believers in God through the Judeo-<br/>
  Christian faith.  Jews and Christians share the same scriptures: the <br/>
  Old Testament, as Rachel Ann mentioned, was passed intact from Jews <br/>
  to Christians.  I believe that our Biblically-based Constitution and <br/>
  laws are the reason our society has lasted longer than just about any <br/>
  other democracy.<br/>
<br/>
  The Jewish scientist closed with this quote about the Bible:<br/>
  &gt;Did things come about the way the Bible says? Of course not. Is it <br/>
  true?<br/>
  &gt;Absolutely.   <br/>
  In other words, the Bible is true, and we are just reading it wrong.  <br/>
  Christians agree that the more the Bible is investigated, the more <br/>
  accurate it is known to be, when interpreted correctly.  The problem <br/>
  with evolutionary theory is that it doesn&#39;t even try to match to what <br/>
  the Bible says.   <br/>
<br/>
  Today I am posting some quotes from eminent scientists and <br/>
  evolutionists (even microbiologists) who find weaknesses in the <br/>
  evolutionary theory.  This is to answer the question, &quot;Since <br/>
  evolution is scientific and all but proven, why all the fuss about <br/>
  teaching creation?  Isn&#39;t evolution state-of-the-art science?&quot;  No, <br/>
  there is still much debate inside and outside of scientific circles.  <br/>
  It is not &quot;all but proven.&quot; Here are some quotes that show this, <br/>
  compiled from the web page below.<br/>
