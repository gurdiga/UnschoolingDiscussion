<div id="ygrps-yiv-860895995">Any ideas for computer games that two 11 year old girls can play together actively?  Lately, they seem to have decided that Age of<br/>
Empires and Sims are one-at-a-time games (or maybe they&#39;re just tired of them).  I guess I could buy a second copy and let them network<br/>
together but I&#39;m hoping to find one game they can both play since one of them doesn&#39;t live here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Carolyn</div>
