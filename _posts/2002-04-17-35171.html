<div id="ygrps-yiv-767319977">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to thank Sandra and other seasoned unschoolers for helping me with <br/>
my inner debate regarding TV. Today is a home day unti1 1pm, then go, go, go <br/>
until night fall. Mary Griffith is speaking in town and I&#39;m going no matter <br/>
what!!. A few weeks ago Peggy O&#39;Mara was here and illness kept us all home. <br/>
So my kids woke up late wanting to use the TV to watch a library video. They <br/>
looked at the PBS schedule and saw Caillou was on after the video finished. <br/>
We&#39;ve all had laryngitis and my 5 year old has it pretty bad today. They got <br/>
to see Caillou decide what he wanted to eat and my little guy  asked to have <br/>
the same for breakfast. I&#39;m here next to the TV waiting for them to have <br/>
needs. I&#39;ve read all my emails which fills my cup. I&#39;m glad I have worked on <br/>
my issue to allow for more freedom for them. We are in a community with lots <br/>
of people who believe TV is damaging to little spirits. We have a local <br/>
Waldorf school where lots of my kids friends attend. The school has very <br/>
strict TV limits for families and I&#39;ve gotten caught in their web. I&#39;m <br/>
freeing myself, thank you again.<br/>
<br/>
My hubby and I got to work out the problems from the night before. Really <br/>
stupid stuff. He has a temper and does loudly loss it when he&#39;s tired. I&#39;m a <br/>
total baby when yelled at... so. enough said, we will survive...<br/>
<br/>
Friday am we will head to the Redwood forest to help plant with the rangers. <br/>
I&#39;m ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to you all soon,<br/>
Mary H.<br/>
<br/>

You&#39;re welcome, and I&#39;m glad your kids are having fun with it.  Is that the <br/>
show about the little cats in China?  Holly likes that show (if that&#39;s the <br/>
one).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard Mary speak before.  You&#39;ll have fun!!<br/>
