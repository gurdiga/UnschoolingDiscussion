<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018771787">Well, this list has been a bit too quiet lately so let&#39;s chat.<br/>
<br/>
What are all of your kidlets up to these days?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what mine are doing:<br/>
DISCLAIMER -- They signed up for this stuff on their own, so I guess <br/>
we can still call it unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My girls decided to take a another chemistry class this spring at a <br/>
local college.  A group of homeschoolers arranged it.  My girls go <br/>
because they think it&#39;s a funthing to do.  They made silly putty in <br/>
the first class, incinerated popcorn in the second one and are waiting <br/>
to get to blow something up.<br/>
<br/>
They also decided that their dad was never going to get around to <br/>
helping them get their amateur radio licenses, so they signed up for <br/>
the class dh&#39;s friend was starting up for a group of boy scouts.  I&#39;m <br/>
anxious to see how they get along with the boy scouts.  They have a <br/>
personality conflict with the homeschoolers mentioned above.  They <br/>
just are so plain different from the other teens that they don&#39;t fit <br/>
in, but they don&#39;t care either and they sort of revel in it.  It&#39;ll be <br/>
interesting to see if they make friends with the boy scouts.<br/>
<br/>
They went to youth group meeting at a friend&#39;s church yesterday.  They <br/>
go to be subversive, I think.  Rachel claims to be a Militant Agnostic <br/>
Procrastinator.  Jenni is becoming a witch I think.  Alas, last night <br/>
was compliment night.  They sat in a circle and took turns being in <br/>
the middle.  They went around the circle giving compliments to the <br/>
person in the center.  Rachel is apparently Smart, Nice, Funny, and <br/>
Treats those younger than herself as friends.  Jenni is Quiet, Nice, <br/>
Patient, Has nice hair and is smart.  They both have nice boots!  But <br/>
they didn&#39;t get to be subtly subversive!<br/>
<br/>
Normally, I would discourage this behaviour and explain that other <br/>
people&#39;s parents may not appreciate it.  However, they keep getting <br/>
invited because their friend&#39;s father is trying to &quot;save&quot; them.  I <br/>
figure, it goes both ways.  Besides, they are having such fun with it <br/>
and who am I to tell them what to do?<br/>
<br/>
Well, spring is coming.  We have had a few very warm days.  Rachel put <br/>
in one new flower bed already.  She has many plans for more.  I&#39;ve <br/>
given up trying to get my ideas in.  She is really good at designing <br/>
them, so, I&#39;ve decide to just let her run with it even if it isn&#39;t <br/>
exactly what I was picturing.<br/>
<br/>
Other signs of spring:  <br/>
Jenni has started reading on the tree swing again.  That&#39;s like seeing <br/>
the first robin!<br/>
<br/>
All three of my kids have decided kite flying is cool.  Now, they just <br/>
need to learn that kite flying with gusts up to 40 mph is not a good <br/>
thing!<br/>
<br/>
Wyndham is wearing his winter coat.  He only does that when it is <br/>
warming up.  When it was 25 degrees out, he left the house without it <br/>
on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
Other than taking care of their invalid (they pronounce it like the <br/>
word that means &quot;not valid&quot;) mother and doing their ongoing crafty <br/>
stuff, that about wraps  it up  I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502332993">That sounds like a really fun life. Your post made me giggle (well, chuckle,<br/>
I&#39;m not really a giggle type) to the end.<br/>
Emily and Max have been going up to teh CSA farm with me, I&#39;ve taken on the<br/>
project of starting herbs from seed, in order to learn more about seed<br/>
starting for when we move to our homestead.<br/>
Max is very into star wars, I have started getting VERY interested in Star<br/>
Trek: TNG, love the pseudo-science! I would like to take max to a science<br/>
fiction/star wars/star trek convention. Any one have ideas?<br/>
Emily and I have been focused on building her socila life. Not that it is<br/>
really lacking there are just some kids that she is intent on getting to<br/>
know better. Our unschooling community is really growing. That is the worst<br/>
thing about moving out of the area, leaving my tribe. BUT, I&#39;ll just make a<br/>
new one! There&#39;s unschoolers in NYstate!<br/>

&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>
have<br/>
not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A. Einstein</div>
