OOOOOOMbers...<br/>
Ren said the &quot;w&quot; word.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, folks...<br/>
<br/>
If this conference had a lot of Christians and if it was in the South,  it&#39;s <br/>
easy for people to roll over.  <br/>
<br/>
Even my courageous self stalled on putting up the non-spanking page until <br/>
after speaking in Saskatchewan.  Partly scheduling, partly cowardice.<br/>
<br/>
If a couple of strong men have had intimidating experiences at Christian <br/>
conferences, it seems it would be easy for a less strong female to soften up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And some people are braver, more dynamic, clearer and more committed to <br/>
unschooling than others.<br/>
<br/>
It happens.<br/>
<br/>
So there will be this WONDERFUL conference in South Carolina.<br/>
I&#39;ve been practicing walking very consciously, and have been working on <br/>
handouts.  <br/>
It&#39;s going to be just lovely!<br/>
No, not just lovely.  INTENSELY lovely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17306251">Hi Patty,<br/>
  I remember back to when I had just 2. I thought I&#39;d never have enough <br/>
energy or pateince to get thru the day.  Now I have a just turned 8 yo, Sam and I <br/>
am chasing 5yo Max with Down syndrome, trying to keep him out of everything, <br/>
seems impossible! BUT wait I have a 13yo and a 17yo that have a million places <br/>
to go karate, the college, the library and friends that need rides, too. And I <br/>
am a single Mom ..ugh! (no wonder younger chicks looked so good....I don&#39;t <br/>
know if I am coming or going). Anyway, Sam has to really want to do something and <br/>
ask me to my face. Hanging out with guys his age is what he really likes. He <br/>
has his surfing buddies, maybe you can find something that fits your area, an <br/>
outside activity. Getting Sam&#39;s energy out is really important, he seems very <br/>
clingy if he hasn&#39;t run around in a while. He will develop his own interests. <br/>
Sam is always needing to do the things a Dad would do with him, That is <br/>
stumping me. Guess I have to learn to drive a boat!<br/>
   Alot of things come up just when I can not stop everything I am doing <br/>
(like driving). But if it is something that interests him It WILL come up again. I <br/>
keep my eye out for it, soon or later we run into it.<br/>
 <br/>
  Hugs, Patti- who has 24 hours til Nita(17) is leaving for the Bahamas on a <br/>
sailboat for 5 weeks. Yikes!  <br/>

Unschooling that&#39;s what should spill from her mouth.  I would never explain <br/>
Unschooling to someone and change the definition. That&#39;s almost like telling a crowd of <br/>
alcoholics that a sip is ok when it will really send them into a downward <br/>
spiral.<br/>
<br/>
That MAY be why some come to this group thinking a few books is ok. <br/>
<br/>
I think my area is a bit &quot;a child should be in school&quot; thinking but if <br/>
explained properly it actually sounds pretty exciting and taken in well. <br/>

If &quot;not so much&quot; takes, maybe stopping is possible.<br/>

There are lots of places for people to get skewed ideas about unschooling, <br/>

be done.  We have hundreds of books, even some text books but I DONT break <br/>
them out and insist that they are used. They are there if wanted but not <br/>
suggested or pushed. <br/>

speaking to since her talk was tailored to them. (Though I think Patty said<br/>
it wasn&#39;t well attended.) It&#39;s not like she was caught unawares or someone<br/>
made her speak. Would an unschooler change the definition of unschooling to<br/>
suit her audience? I write about *homeschooling* differently on the HEM<br/>
message baords but I don&#39;t change what unschooling is to make it more<br/>
palatable to a broader audience.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s planning on doing this often with her husband&#39;s famous unschooling<br/>
name it makes it even more difficult to keep the word unschooling meaning<br/>
what John Holt described since there&#39;s some &quot;authority&quot; telling them<br/>
something different.<br/>
<br/>
Here what was written in the Press Release for that conference: &quot;Wondering<br/>
about the &#39;unschooling&#39; method? Day Farenga will speak about this popular<br/>
topic.&quot;<br/>
