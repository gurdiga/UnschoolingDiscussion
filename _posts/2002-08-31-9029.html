 </span></blockquote>Vomit was originally Pizza - at least, they were trying to make a<br/>
pizza-flavored jelly belly and came up with one to try, but everyone who<br/>
tested it thought it was gross. So they shelved it for a while... then<br/>
when they started the Bertie Botts they remembered it, pulled it out, and<br/>
renamed it Vomit. <br/>

to chat it up with the guides.<br/>

They are even more ridiculously expensive than the regular Jelly Belly&#39;s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022665836">We found some at the Winn Dixie grocery stroe. The new<br/>
ones, in a box, are expensive.  I found the fist batch<br/>
(in cute little draw string bags) at Walmart. The<br/>
first ones were only 25 (I just realized my computer<br/>
keyboard has no cents sign!!) cents. There was a<br/>
flavor key included.<br/>
