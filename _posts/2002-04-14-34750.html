&gt; It was originally a single-use thing, designed for distribution in a <br/>
&gt; certain <br/>
&gt; workshop.  But it was fun and well received, so I&#39;ve always given them away <br/>
&gt; when I do workshops.  And sure enough, there&#39;s permission to change it.  <br/>
&gt; But <br/>
&gt; that one single change seemed to me to show a lack of faith in real-world <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, I used the certificate (as written) to give to participants in a <br/>
workshop I led for Religious Educators in Unitarian Universalist churches,  <br/>
about bringing joy into the classroom.  The workshop went pretty well, but <br/>
when I gave them the certificates at the end, they were transformed. They <br/>
begged for permission to share it with everyone they knew (I agreed <br/>
magnanimously, pointing out the permission granted at the bootom) and it led <br/>
to conversation that made everyone late for lunch, quite happily.<br/>
<br/>
Next time maybe I should just hand out the certificates and let them talk. <br/>

<br/>
HOW COOL!<br/>
<br/>
Several times I&#39;ve passed it out at the beginning, while people were coming <br/>
in, and asked people by the doors to keep distributing them as others came.  <br/>
Then I say school gets people used to learning just to get the grade, or the <br/>
certificate, and that they already have their certificate so they can leave <br/>
if they want to.  Some people laugh, but others look very thoughtful and I <br/>
can just see them thinking &quot;Ooooh....  that&#39;s true.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also had some criticism from people, mostly about the not finishing <br/>
everything you start part.  Too many people were forced to do things with <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s good for you,&quot; and they internalized that so much that if a child is <br/>
bored with so much as a card game and wants to quit before &quot;the end,&quot; the <br/>
parents are nervous and feel that urge to make him finish.<br/>
