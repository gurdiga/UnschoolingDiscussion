<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418982417">From: &quot;Gary & Lisa Williams&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:glmnw@...">glmnw@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So I guess what I&#39;m asking is, how involved are you and your<br/>
 kids involved in weekly lessons of some sort or how involved are you in<br/>
 homeschool groups that provide kid interactions, etc.?  And do you feel<br/>
 these lessons/activities are enjoyable and/or useful?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is working for my kids right now isn&#39;t what was working last year. My<br/>
kids that are unschooled are 8, 7 and almost 3. Last year they were<br/>
perfectly happy to do a homeschool sports camp one day a week for 3 hours<br/>
and then maybe have a friend over once a week and the rest of the time hang<br/>
out with me, either out or home. Preferably at home.<br/>
<br/>
Now they enjoy the outtings more. We will be doing park day every Tues.<br/>
starting next week. I think it&#39;s something they will want to do every week.<br/>
We do craft day every Wed. at a friends house and then have plenty of play<br/>
time after we do the craft. Fridays will again start their sports day in a<br/>
couple of weeks. So that will be 3 days of doing things outside the house<br/>
with other kids on a regular basis. We&#39;ll see how that goes. Of course the<br/>
youngest doesn&#39;t do the sports day but she does do the park and crafts. This<br/>
is the most my kids have done so far on a regular basis. I&#39;m figuring that<br/>
will eventually change too depending on their needs.<br/>
<br/>
 I know they will give up park day and craft day if other things come up,<br/>
like more interesting field trips with our group or fun stuff with mom and<br/>
dad. I know from experience they are not willig to give up their Fridays and<br/>
sports though. In between, as they like, we will do water park and friends<br/>
over too. My kids still are at the point though where too much away from<br/>
home is not to their liking. A few hours 3 days a week are just enough so<br/>
far.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to <br/>
&gt; me, responsibility is doing those things that I have a duty to take<br/>
&gt; care of.  And we all have those kind of things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think you&#39;re seeing responsibility as something you have to do.<br/>
<br/>
It helps *loads* to see that you *do* have a choice and athat you&#39;re<br/>
choosing to do what *you* feel you should be responsible for.<br/>
<br/>
You *could* not clean up. That *is* a choice. But you will probably<br/>
eventually chose to clean. I think it helps to choose to clean when someone<br/>
feels there&#39;s a real reason to clean rather than because they &quot;have to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Someone recently said they would start approaching cleaning with a different<br/>
attitude so her daughter didn&#39;t get the idea that cleaning was a nasty<br/>
chore. Rather than saying she was going to clean because she had to, she was<br/>
going to be more honest and say she was cleaning because she enjoyed the<br/>
house more and felt more peaceful when it&#39;s orderly. So she&#39;d be cleaning<br/>
because she wanted to rather than because she had to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s how my son feels, and if you walk in his room right now, you<br/>
&gt; will see an unmade bed, piles of dirty clothes, dirty dishes, empty<br/>
&gt; glasses, food trash and empty food containers, and ants following a<br/>
&gt; little trail to his room because they know that&#39;s where the food<br/>
&gt; crumbs are.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would clean up the food myself because I don&#39;t want ants. But then neither<br/>
does my daughter, nor does she like her favorite cups filled with mold if<br/>
she forgets them somewhere so she chooses to eat food in rooms that are high<br/>
traffic.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Eventually this is going to<br/>
&gt; get to be a health hazard, but that&#39;s ok because we don&#39;t have to do<br/>
&gt; anything we don&#39;t WANT to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where do we draw the line here?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No lines. We turn our thinking around from making them do what we want or<br/>
what we think they&#39;re supposed to, to seeing our role as their partner in<br/>
their exploration of life.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than making him shower, suggest that if he wants to go somewhere that<br/>
he&#39;ll offend people if he smells. But let him decide.<br/>
<br/>
Puberty will help too. And introduce him to deodorant.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than seeing his room as his to manage or not, ask him if he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
mind if you came in and straightened up. Not as a favor to him, but because<br/>
you want to and because it will help him get a feel for the benefits of<br/>
organizaiton and how to go about it. It needs to be a gift rather than<br/>
something you expect him to appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re cleaning resentfully, he&#39;ll resent you for cleaning and he won&#39;t<br/>
help.<br/>

medium. We go to park day once a week with our support group and meet with <br/>
another homeschool family to hang out one day a week. My son (the home-body) is <br/>
getting ready to start kids classes at the art museum on Saturdays. We have lots <br/>
of friends with kids who we see socially on the weekends sometimes.<br/>
