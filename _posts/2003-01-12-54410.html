<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055336224">&lt;&lt; On a side note to this, my son (4 1/2) is not potty trained over night.  We <br/>
put him in good nites pull ups but he soaks them.  Sometimes he gets up, <br/>
sometimes he doesn&#39;t.  He has horrible itchiness and some rashes from the <br/>
wetness, or maybe from the chemicals in the pull up.  Any suggestions of <br/>
natural overnight protection?  Brands or cotton diaper type pullups to buy <br/>
and where to get them?  I&#39;d like to try something for the poor kid. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a brand of diapers that is totally natural and biodegradable, made out of corn. They&#39;re called Nature Boy & Girl. You can find them at health food stores but sometimes at other stores too, or order them from drugstore.com. That&#39;s what we&#39;ve used since we switched to disposable diapers. I&#39;ve heard people complain about regular diapers because of rashes and allergic reactions. These diapers are totally friendly to the body and the environment. <br/>

 I&#39;ll check out the site.<br/>
