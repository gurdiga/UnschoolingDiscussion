HesFes stands for Home Educators Seaside FEStival.  It happens in late  May <br/>
every year, in England.  Holly got to go this year.<br/>
 <br/>
I got two e-mails yesterday from people who had photos online of  this.  I <br/>
had received a note to a blog about another dad&#39;s photos.   Now I&#39;ve put those <br/>
links in one place, so if anyone wants to look at photos of a  wild week-long <br/>
home educators&#39; blowout in SE England, there they are.<br/>
 <br/>
AND if anyone has photos online and would be willing to send me a link,  <br/>
Holly will be thrilled to have more and more photos to remember what  to  date has <br/>
probably been the best thing in her whole life.<br/>
