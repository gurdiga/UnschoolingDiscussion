Actually I only wore them a few times anyway.<br/>

I keep threatening to dye my hair purple for an orchestra concert sometime.<br/>
(We have to wear all black.)  Still haven&#39;t done it.<br/>

I&#39;ve never een wanted to do a color like that. Just isn&#39;t in me I guess. I<br/>
love it on others though. I love the commercial with the older woman who&#39;s<br/>
hair comes out fuschia and still goes to Outback Steakhouse anyway!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just went from really blond to almost black. I love it. Of course<br/>
it&#39;s not that dark now as the blond is coming through a bit. Different hair<br/>
color every day. Talk about me being bored. How can I now? And Joe gets to<br/>
go to bed with a different women every night and not get into trouble!!<br/>
