<div id="ygrps-yiv-464836507">Hi Jodye!<br/>
I&#39;m in Wichita, KS, not too far from Oklahoma, depending on which part we&#39;re<br/>
talking about!<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m new to the list and I was just skimming through the new posts.  I<br/>

&gt; By the way...my kids are 12, 9, 5 and 1.  I had the first one at 23 and<br/>

&gt; one.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jodye, what kind of problems does the baby have from the brachial plexus<br/>
injury?<br/>
<br/>
 Still, in some ways it&#39;s easier for me to be a mother now than it was<br/>

We&#39;re just starting  a combination schooling/unschooling.  We&#39;re reading<br/>
Charlotte&#39;s web, and my 5 year old decided to write &quot;Terrific&quot; like<br/>
Charlotte does, first with dominoes, then on paper.  Pretty interesting,<br/>
since he wasn&#39;t interested in learning to write his last name 2 days ago.<br/>
Oh, and he&#39;s writing with all angular lines.  (large T, E, F, small r&#39;s, i &<br/>
c. )  He loves to do numbers with his dad and can tell you what 10 to the<br/>
3rd power is from watching &quot;Cosmos&quot; since he was 3 years old! LOL!<br/>
