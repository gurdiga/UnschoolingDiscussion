&gt; &gt; The Bill Bennett that was on the list was a &quot;fundy&quot; (he called himself<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he and I discussed &quot;good&quot; fundies and 3Rs, so this was not a bad<br/>
thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;g&gt;).  He was very conservative and left (don&#39;t know if he returned) to<br/>
join<br/>
&gt; &gt; a Christian men&#39;s homeschooling list (I think, mommy brain is kinda<br/>
foggy<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes).  At any rate, I think he wrote articles and just wondered if<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; were one and the same.<br/>

&gt; Are you thinking of the one who signed his name BBB, lived in Indiana or<br/>
&gt; some place near there?  And was mostly a stay at home dad?  Check out the<br/>
&gt; middle initial. BBB used to be on HEM-networking and the NHEN lists.<br/>

Don&#39;t keep wondering. :) You didn&#39;t miss anything. From that website (which <br/>
feels creepy to me).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; This is an ideal public school, but it is one that is not out of reach. <br/>
Models for academic excellence are all around us-again, simply consider the <br/>
two million homeschooled children who are already receiving an extraordinary <br/>
education. If we keep our eyes on the goal of giving all kids the best <br/>
education possible, if we reinvigorate the bonds between students and adults, <br/>
we can see schools like this grow everywhere. If we base our decisions on the <br/>
needs of children, and not the convenience of bureaucracies, we will see the <br/>
abilities, knowledge, and character of our young people soar.<br/>
<br/>
â€”William J. Bennett, former U.S. secretary of education, is co-director of <br/>
Empower America, co-author of The Educated Child, and the chairman of K12, an <br/>
Internet-based elementary and secondary school &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Okay, William J. is talking about his &quot;ideal&quot; school in this article. I <br/>
suspect &quot;unschooling&quot; doesn&#39;t meet his requirements for the ideal homeschool <br/>
situation. When he says &quot;...simply consider the two million homeschooled <br/>
children who are already receiving an extraordinary education&quot;, I don&#39;t think <br/>
he would include my leetle self-directed learners in those 2 million.<br/>
<br/>
Yucky site.<br/>
