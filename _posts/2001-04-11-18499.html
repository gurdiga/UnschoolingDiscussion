<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757630154">Thanks to whomever had the idea about the cutting box. My son loves to cut<br/>
stuff up and I decided to take that idea and give him a bunch more stuff.<br/>
This morning he cut up all our old mail, and cut the window thingies out of<br/>
business envelopes and is making astronaut masks out of them.<br/>
On the subject of dialect, yesterday I overheard him in his room repeating<br/>
JFK&#39;s &quot;We choose the moon&quot; speech but when he got to the &quot;not because it is<br/>
easy...&quot; part. he said &quot;but because it is hod&quot; in a perfect recreation of<br/>
JFK&#39;s Bostonian accent, I was ROTFLOL!!<br/>
<br/>
And FWIW, if anyone has a real space fanatic like I do right now, I highly<br/>
recommend the series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. We rented it at our local<br/>
video store. It comes on 4 DVD&#39;s, who knows how many video tapes that would<br/>
make, but it is excellent. A recreation of all that led up to the US moon<br/>
landings, along the lines of the movie &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, except 6 hours of it. My<br/>
son is in heaven!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     *Thanks for the suggestion.  I&#39;m hoping they have it at the <br/>
library.  4yods LOVES anything to do with space.  Last year, we got <br/>
some solar system books from the library - written for adults, but he <br/>
loved the pictures and short descriptions - and he asked me to draw <br/>
circles on paper.  He colored them and cut them out, and now he has a <br/>
model (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really the right word) of the solar <br/>
system up on his wall complete with moons and &quot;planet X&quot;.  My mom got <br/>
him the Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System, and his <br/>
fascination with the solar system just grew.  He also became <br/>
interested in all the other Magic School Bus books, and has become <br/>
interested in other things from the series, like ants, electricity, <br/>
etc.  (just an example of one thing leading to another naturally.)<br/>
<br/>
Just rambling<br/>
