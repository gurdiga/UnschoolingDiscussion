<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534255588">Dear group and Sandra, <br/>
 <br/>
 My last few posts have helped me see a great flaw and in my ability to communicate my thoughts and my lack of taking the time to step away and look at my words and how they might be taken. <br/>
 <br/>
 First, it is knows my all of my friends that I am very honest, to a fault even at times. I feel very adaptable when it comes to walls standing in my way. I feel like I could help my child make transcripts in any way a college would like and no lie, even if I had to help my child pick her learning apart and put grades on what she knows. Others think this is wrong, and I can understand that, but not everything is so black and white. Life is far from black and white. This is however a topic I know little about and should leave it alone until, or when, it is needed for me to learn more about. My point was to support other parents with children who may want to get into a college that insist on transcripts. I have high hopes that when my little one is ready, if she wants, that it will not be a topic we need to deal with. <br/>
 <br/>
 Second. Goddess do I have a lot of learning to do! I did read REJECTING A PRE-PACKAGED LIFE. So much of it I agree with. Too many people live with the idea of someday. Someday I will be happy when: Fill in the blank, better job, more money, better home, new car, married, kids.... could go on and on. And for a long time I lived like that. It takes work not to, we have been programmed to feel like that and every day we are hit by it sometimes not even knowing it, watching TV, talking to friends, ads online. It is hard to deal with. But I think it is something we learn and I hope to not teach my child that it has to be that way. I think we should be happy. <br/>
 <br/>
 But again, my views on happy are different. I really feel like life is about being useful. It is not opposed to happy. I think that by being useful we are happy. I will strive to explain this more in a different post. <br/>
 <br/>
 Third, thank you for putting up with me. I have a great deal to learn and many ideas to re-think and things to get over. More questions, more reading. <br/>
 <br/>
   Blessings,<br/>
    Kimmy<br/>

Would you tell that to my uncle? At 18 he was paralyzed from the neck down. <br/>
Mostly, I guess he&#39;d be considered just a burden----hardly &quot;useful.&quot; He died at <br/>
45.<br/>
<br/>
But I know he was happy. He was surrounded by people who loved him. He had <br/>
his books and music and tv. He loved fast cars. He knew a lot about a lot of <br/>
things and was a great conversationalist. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-901932897">OK I&#39;m jumping in here without reading the whole OP but your uncle was certainly useful. Like you said he knew alot about alot of things and was a great conversationalist. I&#39;m sure the knowledge he gave and the friendship he provided was very useful too many. Not to mention the possible inspiration he was through a positive attitude after such a great hardship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405838420">He was useful because he was happy.  Not happy because he was <br/>
useful.  There are plenty of miserable people that know how to do <br/>
alot of things and can be considered useful.  I still wouldn&#39;t want <br/>
to be around them.<br/>

and that you know what they meant. The other person didn&#39;t say what <br/>
they meant and you didn&#39;t bother to ask, but are more eager to give <br/>
your own opinion than to learn more about theirs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748648514">Kathy, I so very much agree! <br/>
<br/>
 Being a friend is being useful, talking to others, sharring life with them. I am sure so many learned a lot from him. He had many reasons to be happy, being an uncle you remember! He did not lock himself away, give up on life, and refuse to bother with people. He was very useful..... sad to think some people might not think so. <br/>

OK I&#39;m jumping in here without reading the whole OP but your uncle was <br/>
certainly useful. Like you said he knew alot about alot of things and <br/>
was a great conversationalist. I&#39;m sure the knowledge he gave and the <br/>
