<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487016232">Joyce, Pam L, Sandra, and Julie,<br/>
<br/>
  Thank-you for taking the time to give some feedback regarding VG use with<br/>
my 6yo son.  Not micromanaging his time has been a huge shift for me, and<br/>
there is no one in my life who is doing this, so I appreciate any feedback I<br/>
can get to help me get through this change.  I particularly appreciate<br/>
suggestions about how I can be involved even if I&#39;m not right there:<br/>
bringing snacks, moving his console upstairs, talking with him about it,<br/>
finding him magazines, etc.etc.etc. - I really get a feel for how this<br/>
looks/feels and can focus my efforts constructively to do these things.<br/>
Your feedback also really met my need for reassurance that how he is<br/>
choosing to spend his time is most certainly in line with my beliefs of not<br/>
wanting to make decisions for him.  As I mentioned, it is just such a<br/>
radical shift, some perspective from you is very helpful.  I also<br/>
appreciated, Sandra, your comment that VG research has often been measured<br/>
by school success (you didn&#39;t say that specifically, but that is what I<br/>
understood - is that a correct statement?) - this helps tremendously as I<br/>
shelve all the books I&#39;ve read regarding this issue - I feel that I can shut<br/>
the door without looking back if that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyways, this is a very active list - it&#39;s hard to keep up with the<br/>
volume!  Thank-you again,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Almost everything in our culture has been measured by school success.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;tests&quot; (such as they are) involve schoolkids, and the considerations are <br/>
&quot;how will this affect their lives&quot;?  Attention span, time with family, <br/>
willingness to go to bed in time to get up for school, mood when they&#39;re made to <br/>
stop...   <br/>
<br/>
None of those are issues with unschoolers, but researchers don&#39;t care about <br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
The proofs that this culture wants have to do with schoolkids.  We just have <br/>
to look at all that through our own new lenses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448858635">Two things I forgot.<br/>
<br/>
Just in case it didn&#39;t come into that exchange, there is a collection of <br/>
video game information, testimony and links here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games/page">http://sandradodd.com/games/page</a><br/>
<br/>
And another thing.  The subject line &quot;Thank-you for VG feedback&quot; made me <br/>
think &quot;very good feedback,&quot; not video game feedback.  And that reminds me of my <br/>
sister&#39;s report cards in the late 60&#39;s, when the schools decided that letter <br/>
grades were harmful and not very informative.  So they &quot;did away with&quot; letter <br/>
grades and percentages, and moved to an evaluative system.  there were still <br/>
reports, but they were a long page of specifics, rather than six or eight subject <br/>
areas.  And the marks weren&#39;t A B C D F<br/>
<br/>
they were:<br/>
<br/>
E VG  G  NI  and U<br/>
<br/>
Excellent<br/>
Very Good<br/>
Good<br/>
Needs Improvement<br/>
Unsatisfactory<br/>
<br/>
Excellent was very sparingly given.  It was a kind of &quot;best in class&quot; award.  <br/>
VG covered A and high B.  G was low B, high C.  NI was &quot;below average, but <br/>
tried some&quot; (low C and D) and U was the old F.<br/>
<br/>
Just goes to show I&#39;ll never live long enough to completely recover from <br/>
school.<br/>
