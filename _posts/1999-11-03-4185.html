<h4>Julie Sisemore</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067052752">I&#39;ve been listening in for a while now, and thought I&#39;d go ahead and send an <br/>
intro.  My name is Julie Sisemore, my dh is Ken.  We live in Southeastern <br/>
WA.  We have 5 children: 9 1/2 yog, 7 1/2 yob, 6 1/2 yob, 4 yob, and 16mo <br/>
old girl.  We have always homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
So far we have mostly always *unschooled* although I&#39;ve become more <br/>
irritated by labels recently!  Now, with my 2 older, I&#39;m beginning to use <br/>
some math workbooks.  I just don&#39;t feel creative enough to unschool math <br/>
once we begin things like long division!  But we still look for plenty of <br/>
daily experience to use our math.<br/>
<br/>
We live in a rural area, which we love.  We have enjoyed nature study this <br/>
past year.  We&#39;ve also been doing some American history mostly from a <br/>
literature aspect, finding really good biographies, etc...<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter LOVES horses.  We can&#39;t afford one right now.  But some <br/>
friends of ours whose children are older and busier with school and have 3 <br/>
horses, have agreed to *mentor* her in this.  They have given her some books <br/>
to read, and in the spring, in exchange for some light work, they will teach <br/>
her horsemanship.  She is SO excited about this, and so are we!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to make this too long.  I appreciate the posts about *quitters* <br/>
and couldn&#39;t agree more!  Sometimes we struggle (parents) with unschooling <br/>
and have those  nagging doubts and fears.  I thought a list that is <br/>
supportive of this method may be helpful ;)<br/>

Recently I&#39;ve been struggling with the *ideal* theory of <br/>
homeschooling/learning I have in my head from studying and reading and <br/>
thinking about it over the years, and how I so often don&#39;t feel I can <br/>
realize that learning method.  I have been told lately by other larger <br/>
families, that once they had *so many* kids, they really needed a more <br/>
conventional approach to school.  I&#39;m still wanting to believe that my way <br/>
is possible. Any insights?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The &quot;ideal theory&quot; point of view is more a cultural construct than anything<br/>
else.  As I see it, if my wife and I are active learners and we model this<br/>
to our children through our daily activities, and we stay emotionally close<br/>
to our children, we will be headed in the right direction.<br/>

P.S.  Your oldest is just 6 days younger than our oldest!  Your second one<br/>
is a few months older than our second son.<br/>
