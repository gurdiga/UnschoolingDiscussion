&quot;Leaders are not, as we are often led to think, people who go along with<br/>
huge crowds following them. Leaders are people who go their own way<br/>
without caring, or even looking to see, whether anyone is following them.<br/>
&quot;Leadership qualities&quot; are not the qualities that enable people to<br/>
attract followers, but those that enable them to do without them. They<br/>
include, at the very least, courage, endurance, patience, humor,<br/>
flexibility, resourcefulness, stubbornness, a keen sense of reality, and<br/>
the ability to keep a cool and clear head, even when things are going<br/>
badly. True leaders, in short, do not make people into followers, but<br/>
into other leaders. &quot;<br/>

Like inspiring people to create their own unschooling conferences.  Now, that&#39;s leadership.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Deb, thanks so much for finding this quote.  The real words of John<br/>
Holt are so much more inspiring, and more complete than the paraphrase.  I<br/>
knew it would convey a different picture IRL.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
