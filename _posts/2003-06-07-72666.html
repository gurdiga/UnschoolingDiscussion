<div id="ygrps-yiv-948696251">**I went to high school with a guy who often came to school dressed as<br/>
Wonder <br/>
Woman. He also mostly did murals of her in art. I have no idea how he<br/>
turned <br/>
out.**<br/>
<br/>
Well... in the last year or two I read a newspaper feature about a man<br/>
who had been totally obsessed with Wonder Woman in his youth who had<br/>
just been appointed editor or chief writer for the new Wonder Woman<br/>
comic.  So there really is a perfect job out there for everyone!<br/>
<br/>
(You could try googling your friend&#39;s name and see if you can find any<br/>
evidence of him.  A man in a Wonder Woman costume should leave a fiery<br/>
trail. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
