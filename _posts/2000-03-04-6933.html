<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259366975">Hi all!  Anyone out there with any ideas or instructions for making your<br/>
own balancing scale?  We&#39;re about to delve into the Guinness Book of<br/>
World Records for awhile and it has set off an interest in measuring<br/>
around here.  We thought it would be fun to compare weights and volumes<br/>
until we checked into how much a brand new balance and weights costs! <br/>
WHEW!!  So any and all ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Kerry</div>
