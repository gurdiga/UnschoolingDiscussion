<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866585208">Hi Jodye;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how helpful this will be for you, but it can&#39;t hurt to<br/>
try...When was the last time your son had a complete &quot;going over&quot; by a<br/>
really competent dentist?  (i.e. X-rays, bite tests and the whole<br/>
works)  This might sound bizarre but I once knew a person who was<br/>
compulsive about chewing gum, gnawing on anything she could get her<br/>
hands on (pencils of course, but also her earpiece on her glasses etc.),<br/>
and snacking constantly.  She was positively driven to chew or bite.  It<br/>
turned out her jaw alignment was way out and the tension in her jaw,<br/>
though she was completely unaware of it, drove her to chewing<br/>
inappropriately.  If you think of the jaw as being potentially<br/>
mis-aligned or &quot;too-tightly wired&quot;, it would be understandable that<br/>
there would be &quot;energy&quot; that needs to be released.  Maybe it&#39;s a physics<br/>
or engineering thing...Anyway, ask a dentist about &quot;T.M.J.&quot; syndrome. <br/>
Or, if you&#39;re up to it, and as was recently discussed on this list,<br/>
could a chiropractor help?  Just an idea.  Good luck dealing with it. <br/>
If the dental visit doesn&#39;t work, I don&#39;t suppose drawing undue<br/>
attention to your son&#39;s condition will help.  Could he yet grow out of<br/>
it?  I doubt it&#39;s a serious problem.<br/>
<br/>

PS  Are you aware of him grinding his teeth (at night) which could also<br/>
signal a TMJ problem?<br/>

really loudly at night, I just thought it was one of those things, darn!&nbsp; 
OK, that&#39;s it I&#39;m getting her checked over by a cranio-sacral&nbsp;therapist 
asap!!!!!&nbsp; BTW, what would a dentist do about such a problem, it sounds 
like a bone-structure thing more than a teeth thing to me</font></div>
