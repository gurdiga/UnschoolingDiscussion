<div id="ygrps-yiv-55855017">Nance, the ladies are $50 every time they come. We have a small house, 2 <br/>
bedrooms, 1 bath. So, it costs us $100 a month, and yes, I should be saving <br/>
that for the 3yo&#39;s college, but then I would lose my mind amid the mess long <br/>
before I saw him in his cap and gown. Another thing I love about these <br/>
housekeepers is there are six of them and they are done in 45 minutes or <br/>
less. They pile out of their van and deploy to every room of the house, <br/>
while I grab the boys and flee. I&#39;ve tried having one person do it but it <br/>
takes half a day and it&#39;s a bother having someone in the house that long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378098421">Hey all, <br/>
<br/>
righ off the bat you&#39;ll going to have to excuse the spelling of anything i<br/>
post--i just a little on the dyslixic side of things. <br/>
<br/>
I also have a little confushion to make. I am 22 just over the teen list<br/>
age. But i thought i&#39;d indroduce myself, my work, and see if you&#39;ll will<br/>
make an exception. I joined the list becuase i had a fucking nightmare<br/>
exsperince in school and i feel that i could be a resouce for people in the<br/>
unschooling population who stuggle wiht Learning disabities. <br/>
<br/>
I was diagnossed with Dyslixia in four grade and depression as a reulst of<br/>
living in fucking systmes that can not understand diffrence. I did not<br/>
actually learn to read untill i was 12--at that point the shame,<br/>
hummilation, and anger that felt towards a school system that was<br/>
systemcially teaching me that i was worthless and stupid was to much to<br/>
bear--i dorped out with the support of my partents completly. i have to say<br/>
that perioed was one of the most difficult times in mylife--sucicde was<br/>
cerntently on my mind most of the time. our schools have so much power and<br/>
this power if very rearlly quested--in the end they are more concered with<br/>
socilzaing conformaty then empowering people as thinkers. But when you are<br/>
12 that shit is to hard to understand specfically when the common<br/>
assocation with a learning disabilty is that you are stupid that spelling<br/>
is a direct indication of how your minds works. <br/>
<br/>
But my story does that end there. I was lucky to be a gifted soccer player<br/>
and reenrooled under that pignoned indenty which schools are so quick to<br/>
give out. I ended up barging graduating and reviving a school scholarship....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But i decided to drop soccer a go with of all things writing (there is a<br/>
lot of shit left out here in the abriged vershion--problmes wiht achohall,<br/>
a coulpe of artsest, tranfersing unversityies, you the good stuff). Now I<br/>
am a recent graduate for Brown University and author of the forth coming<br/>
book entitled Learning Outside the Lines (Simon & Schuster, September<br/>
2000). It book is based on the success stories of me and my co-author. It<br/>
starts with my journey from being a sixth grade drop and  then turns to my<br/>
co-author--diagnosed with ADHD in second grade, high school drop out turned<br/>
IVY league student also. Together we then explore and outline the learning<br/>
strategies that we have used to be successful as alternative learns, to be<br/>
successful as people learn out side the lines. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This book dirctly attacks that fucked things about ourschools and its goals<br/>
it to outline a road map for learning outside the lines, it takes the<br/>
reader on a journey towards personal empowerment and profound educational<br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that all kids deserve an education that is about freedom,<br/>
empowerment, and educational revolution. you guys have mad courge for<br/>
pursing an education that is fucking truly outside the lines. i wish this<br/>
tyep of enviorment would of been around for me. <br/>
<br/>
if i can be of any help, around the issue of ld, or aroudn the isseu of<br/>
going to college after untraditional education please feel free to contatct<br/>
any time. here is my contact information:<br/>
