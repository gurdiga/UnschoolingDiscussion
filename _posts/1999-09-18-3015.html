that miracles never cease. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Next week, an historic event will take place. On September<br/>
 16, the<br/>
 United States Senate, by unanimous consent, officially<br/>
 passed Senate<br/>
 Resolution 183, designating the week of September 19-25,<br/>
 1999, as<br/>
 &quot;National Home Education Week.&quot; This resolution, drafted by<br/>
 and<br/>
 lobbied for by Home School Legal Defense Association, was<br/>
 sponsored<br/>
 by Senator John Ashcroft.<br/>
 <br/>
 Several highlights of the resolution state that: parents<br/>
 have the<br/>
 fundamental right to direct the up-bring of their children;<br/>
 family<br/>
 participation and parental choices in pursuit of educational<br/>
 excellence are important; and training in the home<br/>
 strengthens the<br/>
 family and guides children in setting the highest standards<br/>
 for their<br/>
 lives which are essential elements to the continuity of<br/>
 morality in<br/>
 our culture.<br/>
 <br/>
 Although this resolution does not hold the weight of law, it<br/>
 is an<br/>
 official recognition of home schoolers by our United States<br/>
 Senate,<br/>
 and can be used as powerful tool in public relations.<br/>
 <br/>
 Join us in celebrating this historic event in Washington,<br/>
 D.C. on<br/>
 September 23 and 24, as HSLDA sponsors the Proclaim Liberty<br/>
 Rally and<br/>
 Conference. For more information please call Dana Henry at<br/>

 <br/>
 Below is the full text of the resolution.<br/>
 <br/>
 Yours for Liberty,<br/>

 S. RES. 183<br/>
 <br/>
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>
 <br/>
 Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. ABRAHAM, Mr. COCHRAN, Mr.<br/>
 COVERDELL,<br/>
 Mr. DeWINE, Mr. GORTON, Mr. GRAMS, Mr. HAGEL, Mr. HELMS, Mr.<br/>
 INHOFE,<br/>
 Mr. GREGG, Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire, Mr. SMITH of Oregon,<br/>
 Mr.<br/>
 THURMOND) submitted the following resolution; which was<br/>
 referred to<br/>
 the Committee on the Judiciary:<br/>
 <br/>
 September 14, 1999<br/>
 <br/>
 Designating the week beginning on September 19, 1999, and<br/>
 ending on<br/>
 September 25, 1999, as National Home Education Week.<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas the United States is committed to excellence in<br/>
 education;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas the United States recognizes the importance of<br/>
 family<br/>
 participation and parental choices in pursuit of that<br/>
 excellence;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas the United States recognizes the fundamental right<br/>
 of parents<br/>
 to direct the education and upbringing of their children;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas parents want their children to receive a first-class<br/>
 education;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas training in the home strengthens the family and<br/>
 guides<br/>
 children in setting the highest standards for their lives<br/>
 which are<br/>
 essential elements to the continuity of morality in our<br/>
 culture;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas home schooling families contribute significantly to<br/>
 the<br/>
 cultural diversity important to a healthy society;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas the United States has a significant number of<br/>
 parents who<br/>
 teach their own children at home;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas home education was proven successful in the lives of<br/>
 George<br/>
 Washington, Patrick Henry, John Quincy Adams, John Marshall,<br/>
 Robert<br/>
 E. Lee, Booker T. Washington, Thomas Edison, Abraham<br/>
 Lincoln,<br/>
 Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Mark Twain, John<br/>
 Singleton<br/>
 Copley, William Carey, Phyllis Wheatley, and Andrew<br/>
 Carnegie;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas home school students exhibit self-confidence and<br/>
 good<br/>
 citizenship and are fully prepared academically to meet the<br/>
 challenges of today&#39;s society;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas dozens of contemporary studies continue to confirm<br/>
 that<br/>
 children who are educated at home score exceptionally well<br/>
 on<br/>
 nationally normed achievement tests;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas a March 1999 study by the Educational Resources<br/>
 Information<br/>
 Center Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation at the<br/>
 University<br/>
 of Maryland found that home school students taking the Iowa<br/>
 Test of<br/>
 Basic Skills or the Tests of Achievement and Proficiency<br/>
 scored in<br/>
 the 70th to 80th percentiles among all the students<br/>
 nationwide who<br/>
 took those exams, and 25 percent of home schooled students<br/>
 were<br/>
 studying at a level one or more grades above normal for<br/>
 their age;<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas studies demonstrate that home schoolers excel in<br/>
 college with<br/>
 the average grade point average of home schoolers exceeding<br/>
 the<br/>
 college average; and<br/>
 <br/>
 Whereas United States home educators and home instructed<br/>
 students<br/>
 should be recognized and celebrated for their efforts to<br/>
 improve the<br/>
 quality of education:  Now, therefore, be it<br/>
 <br/>
 Resolved, That the week beginning on September 19, 1999, and<br/>
 ending<br/>
 on September 25, 1999, is designated as National Home<br/>
 Education Week.<br/>
 The President is authorized and requested to issue a<br/>
 proclamation<br/>
 recognizing the contributions that home schooling families<br/>
 have made<br/>
 to the Nation.<br/>
 <br/>
 Passed the Senate September 16, 1999<br/>
