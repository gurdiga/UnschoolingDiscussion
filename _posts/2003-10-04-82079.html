<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059477415">We had a particularly nice day yesterday...thought I would share!<br/>
<br/>
We started out the day with all four of us snuggled under the duvet until<br/>
close to 9:00-it was cold, windy and overcast so we didn&#39;t feel too<br/>
motivated to get out of bed. We could hear all the schoolkids outside making<br/>
their way to school (we live a block from the school). We finally got up so<br/>
Joe (dh) could take Nathan (4) to his gymnastics class at the Y. After<br/>
Nathan and Joe left, Noah (almost 6) and I (still in pj&#39;s &lt;g&gt;) started<br/>
making some oatmeal cookies, which Noah had asked to do today when we were<br/>
tucking him in bed last night. Noah was running back and forth between the<br/>
living room (watching Scooby Doo Christmas video) and helping me with the<br/>
cookies-he really only likes to help with the measuring parts (and the<br/>
eating of course). As I was finishing up baking the cookies, Joe & Nathan<br/>
got back. Nathan was very excited about using the trampoline and the balance<br/>
beam and &quot;slithering like a snake&quot; at gymnastics, which he demonstrated for<br/>
me with gusto.<br/>
<br/>
Joe had a quick lunch and went back out to do some yardwork for one of his<br/>
lawncare customers. The boys and I weren&#39;t hungry for lunch yet (too many<br/>
cookies &lt;g&gt;) so they watched a bit of a video, played with Legos/Bionicles<br/>
and a Power Rangers CD on the computer. They&#39;re all excited because they&#39;ve<br/>
inherited our old computer so they don&#39;t have to wait for me to get off the<br/>
computer anymore! While they were doing all that, I was reading email and<br/>
setting up a few things on the new computer system. An email came through<br/>
from one of the women on our local homeschool list, saying that there was a<br/>
picture of Joe and the boys (Joe pulling the boys on their tandem<br/>
trail-a-bike) in that day&#39;s paper. I thought this was pretty funny because<br/>
neither Joe or  I knew the picture had run (I didn&#39;t even know it had been<br/>
taken in the first place; it had been taken on Wednesday when Joe was coming<br/>
home from running errands downtown with the boys and he had forgotten to<br/>
mention it to me). So I went and picked up the paper which was sitting on<br/>
the dining room table and found the photo. I showed it to the boys, they<br/>
thought it was no big deal (reminded me of Sandra&#39;s article about how Holly<br/>
takes the world for granted-this is Noah&#39;s second time in the paper and<br/>
Nathan&#39;s third, so I guess to them it *is* no big deal!).<br/>
<br/>
We finally all got hungry and the boys decided they wanted veggie dogs for<br/>
lunch. I made them two each (only one bun each though) and they polished<br/>
those off and asked for more. There were only 3 more left in the package so<br/>
I cooked them up and they split them. I had some leftovers from the night<br/>
before. We all had another cookie or two. By this time I was really feeling<br/>
like I wanted to have a shower and get dressed so off I went while the boys<br/>
went back to their Legos. As I was getting out of the shower, I hear someone<br/>
coming in the house. I figure it&#39;s Joe running in to pick up something he&#39;s<br/>
forgotten, but it was my parents dropping in for a surprise visit (very<br/>
unusual for them!) They live a half hour&#39;s drive from us so usually visits<br/>
are planned but they were on their way back from a Woodcarving Show and<br/>
decided to stop in. Nathan ran to get them cookies and we visited for a bit,<br/>
then my dad helped me set up my new printer/scanner/copier which I am very<br/>
excited about! We then tested it out by making a copy of the newspaper photo<br/>
for my mom, then we scanned the photo and started playing around with it.<br/>
After my parents left (close to 4:00) I realize I never started the laundry,<br/>
so I run downstairs to do that. The boys decide they need popsicles so I<br/>
grab some from the downstairs freezer on the way up. I also realize I don&#39;t<br/>
have a clue what I&#39;m going to make for dinner and that Joe and I are going<br/>
out to see a play tonight (our anniversary gift to each other). I rummage<br/>
around in the fridge, see we have peppers, a patty pan  [summer] squash,<br/>
carrots. I remember that I wanted to use up this &quot;tofu helper&quot; mix that I<br/>
bought for our camping trip this summer but never used, so came up with a<br/>
tofu, veggies and sauce concoction with orange couscous for dinner. Joe came<br/>
back and we sat down to eat, but the boys weren&#39;t hungry (not surprising<br/>
after 4 hotdogs each!) and continued playing.<br/>
<br/>
They started playing this &quot;raccoon game&quot;. We have been reading this story<br/>
called _A Week of Raccoons_ (basic premise: an elderly couple go outside<br/>
every morning to find damage done by raccoons-in the garbage one day, drank<br/>
the sugar water from the hummingbird feeder, ate a fish out of a bucket of<br/>
water, etc. The man sets a wooden-cage type trap every day, catches a<br/>
raccoon, and drives him out to the pine forest. Every day he catches a new<br/>
raccoon and the whole trap-trip thing repeats itself). The boys had taken<br/>
the two large boxes from the new computer and were pretending they were the<br/>
raccoons in the traps. Noah wanted to be the Wednesday raccoon, and Nathan<br/>
wanted to be the Monday raccoon. They asked Joe to put them in the fire<br/>
engine tent and drive them to the pine forest, so he did. It was *very*<br/>
cute.<br/>
<br/>
After dinner, I was desperately trying to clean off our large coffee table a<br/>
bit so the babysitter wouldn&#39;t think we were total slobs-it was covered with<br/>
Lego, videos, books, part of a jigsaw puzzle and these cool plaster of paris<br/>
dinosaur fossils Joe made with the boys the other day from a kit Nathan got<br/>
for his birthday last weekend. I picked up the fossil pieces to put them in<br/>
a place where they were less likely to get smashed, and remembered that the<br/>
boys had asked to paint the fossils but we hadn&#39;t got round to it, so now<br/>
it&#39;s probably going to be one of today&#39;s projects.<br/>
<br/>
Our babysitter (much loved by the boys) arrived and the boys were showing<br/>
her around our new place excitedly (we moved in July and she hasn&#39;t sit for<br/>
us since we moved). As we left they were all snuggled up on the couch with<br/>
popcorn and a video.<br/>
<br/>
Joe and I took the bus downtown to see the play (a musical comedy called<br/>
Beehive featuring lots of 60&#39;s tunes) which we really enjoyed. We got home<br/>
just after 10 pm and Nathan was asleep, but Noah was still awake so I went<br/>
and read him a story - a new one we just got from the library that the<br/>
sitter had read to him and he was really excited about. He was quite<br/>
concerned when we got to the part where a little boy was riding a Snow<br/>
Leopard. He looked at me quite seriously and said &quot;Mom, he shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
doing that! Leopards are carnivores! He&#39;s going to get eaten!&quot;. We talked a<br/>
bit about the difference between make-believe and real life, then I gave him<br/>
a goodnight hug. He said &quot;mom, you&#39;re the best mom a boy could have&quot;. What a<br/>
great ending to a fun day!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368889594">I am trying to place the feeling I have today, peace, joy, contentment, or <br/>
all I am not sure. The reason is really something simple and I am sure a good <br/>
number people would look at me like I was nuts if I shared why with them.<br/>
<br/>
My husband took our son snowboarding today, well, actually to work to teach <br/>
snowboarding. Not such a big deal but to me it is. Pete doesn&#39;t have to work <br/>
today, he told them yesterday he would come in if he could. He did work <br/>
yesterday and I took him and later returned to pick him up, spending about 3 hours on <br/>
the road. This has been a big commitment on all our parts. What is so <br/>
wonderful to me is that dad is taking a part and willingly. He has always been a great <br/>
dad but he was raised in a family that does not take children seriously. When <br/>
I first mentioned that Pete was going to take this job I could see my MIL <br/>
thought I was crazy, that this was going to be a big waste of my time. My own <br/>
mother said she wouldn&#39;t do it but she can see that I am fine with it and want to <br/>
do it and that she supports whatever I want to do.<br/>
<br/>
My 23yro son told me during a conversation the other day that &quot;Dad has really <br/>
changed since we (the older boys) were younger.&quot; He is so right!<br/>
<br/>
So, my joy does not come because I did not have to drive, I would have <br/>
willingly. My joy comes from knowing that dad understands (or is beginning to) what <br/>
we are doing. He went today because he wanted to, because he knew if was <br/>
important to Pete and because he wanted to spend the time with Pete in the car, he <br/>
told me it was quality time, LOL. If you would have told me 5 years ago that <br/>
this day would come I am not sure I would have believed it. This is the same <br/>
man who I had to talk into letting me pull the younger son out even though &quot;He <br/>
wasn&#39;t having any problems&quot; in school. The same man who has agreed to attend <br/>
the Unschooling Conference in August..WOOHOO!<br/>
