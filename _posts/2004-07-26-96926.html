<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458666126">So my 17 yr old son and I visited a college this past weekend. He had an interview with <br/>
one of the admissions people and was asked about his educational background. This <br/>
school has admitted lots of homeschoolers so they were familiar with homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My son, though, asks, &quot;Have you ever heard of unschooling?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Admissions lady says, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So my son proceeds to explain it like this.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My mom traditionally homeschooled me for most of my life. But then she started a <br/>
business a few years ago. She got overwhelmed with homeschool so she decided to <br/>
unschool where we can do whatever we want in order to learn whatever we want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was then asked what he had learned and he told her that he couldn&#39;t remember <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
What?!?!?<br/>
<br/>
On the debrief with me, I reminded him that I&#39;ve had my business for five years and that it <br/>
had nothing to do with changing to unschooling. Secondly I asked him what he meant <br/>
when he said he hadn&#39;t learned much or couldn&#39;t remember anything! This is the Klingon <br/>
speaking, guitar and piano playing, book reading, computer programming, Shakespeare <br/>
performing, sign language skilled kid.<br/>
<br/>
Well, boiled down it turns out that when put in a &quot;schoolish&quot; context he just couldn&#39;t <br/>
understand how to explain us or his learning. He did say that once the conversation got <br/>
going, her found himself sharing lots of good that had come of our educational style citing <br/>
books and history we had studied together as well as mentioning some of the above. it&#39;s <br/>
just that he didn&#39;t think that was what she wanted to hear.<br/>
<br/>
It made me conscious of how important it is to give our kids language to express what we <br/>
do when asked by school type people. I thought I had done that.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have stories like this one? How do your kids expalin unschooling? What have <br/>
you suggested they say?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>============<br/>
<br/>
Oooh, I&#39;m very interested in hearing the responses to this. I was thinking<br/>
along these lines after reading Sandra&#39;s story about Marty&#39;s description--at<br/>
the dentist was it?<br/>
<br/>
We were on vacation this past week up in New Hampshire, and while there, we<br/>
went to an American Indian Educational Center (non-profit, but still owned,<br/>
collected and described by non-Native people) and a Shaker Village. Both<br/>
times we had exchanges with the people there--both negative and relatively<br/>
positive.<br/>
<br/>
At the American Indian Center, there was a very rigid tour given by a very<br/>
rigid tour guide who found herself very flustered by Emily&#39;s (7 yo) many<br/>
questions because it threw her off her very scripted talk. Towards the end,<br/>
Em asked about some stories and costumes that she&#39;d seen the kids enjoying<br/>
in the introductory video. The tour guide told her that was the story room<br/>
only used for school groups and that Em should come back sometime with her<br/>
class. Well, Emily said that she didn&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; and that she was on<br/>
vacation. The tour guide launched into this whole, &quot;Well, someday you&#39;ll<br/>
have to do school&quot; yadda, yadda. Em responded that she would &quot;never have to<br/>
do school!&quot; to which the tour guide retorted, &quot;Well, then, you&#39;ll never get<br/>
to try on those costumes then.&quot; Grrr! It was so mean-spirited, I was<br/>
floored. Later, I heard the tour guide remark to a co-worker that she was<br/>
going to have to quit because she just didn&#39;t have the energy to keep doing<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
The next day, we went to the Canterbury Shaker Village and had a really<br/>
great experience. They just got a grant to begin some children&#39;s<br/>
programming, so we went on a tour geared towards families that is,<br/>
apparently, a modified version of the tour they give school groups. We were<br/>
the only family in the early tour, and the young gal was so friendly and<br/>
kind--she even mended Julia&#39;s purse strap after the tour because it broke<br/>
while we were there. She encouraged all kinds of questions, listened<br/>
attentively and kindly reminded them when they weren&#39;t allowed to touch<br/>
something. The tour ended in the schoolhouse, where she started asking Emily<br/>
how she learned in school, to which Em replied that we &quot;unschool!&quot; The gal<br/>
was so positive about homeschooling, &quot;oh, it&#39;s so great you guys can do<br/>
that&quot; kind of stuff. Then she asks what Emily learns about at home, and<br/>
Emily blurts out something along the lines of &quot;nothing! Absolutely nothing!<br/>
I don&#39;t have to learn about anything!&quot; It was a very defensive kind of<br/>
stance, left over, I think, from the day before. So, I said something along<br/>
the lines of, &quot;No, you don&#39;t *have* to learn about anything, but you *like*<br/>
learning about lots of stuff--why don&#39;t you tell her what kinds of things<br/>
you&#39;re interested in and what you like to do.&quot; She still didn&#39;t have much to<br/>
say, so I ended up listing off topics like mythology, egypt, butterflies,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now, who&#39;s being defensive, I wonder? *g*  While in the first instance I was<br/>
glad Em stood her ground and declared that she did *not* have to go to<br/>
school, the second day with someone open and positive, I found myself<br/>
cringing at Em&#39;s description of us doing &quot;nothing.&quot; I ended up talking about<br/>
how we do an awful lot of stuff just like the tour we were on that day and<br/>
that the kids learn things in hands-on, self-directed ways.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m really interested in hearing how others feel about how unschooling<br/>
gets described and whether we should &quot;arm&quot; our kids with responses and cues<br/>
that tell when people are looking for more traditional information about<br/>
what we do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235476243">My son&#39;s only 8 and doesn&#39;t really need to explain. But when asked why he&#39;s not in school, depending on the person asking, he sometimes responds with:<br/>
 <br/>
I am autodidact (said while assuming a karate type pose and pronounced as if he is about to do battle). It&#39;s hard to explain, but it is funny. People never understand it, even when he says the word correctly. He explains what we do as autodidactal learning. He made that word up and likes it better than autodidactic, so that&#39;s the one he uses. No one knows the difference.<br/>
 <br/>
We run into people all the time asking what grade he&#39;s in or what curriculum we use. He tells them we don&#39;t do grades and we use whatever we want. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s when they ask me that there is a problem. I know what I&#39;m doing, but can&#39;t seem to explain it for the life of me. I always come off sounding like an idiot, unless I can take time and describe some of the learning experiences that occur. When I can do that, people usually say things like &#39;Wow&#39; and &#39;Awesome&#39; and &#39;Good for you (or him)&#39;. Still, they don&#39;t understand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026051848">My son is 8 and only really talks about it with me.  But I have talked to <br/>
him about the kinds of stuff he learns while playing video games, joked <br/>
about how to write it in educationalese for the annual evaluation, how I <br/>
explain to other people.  And he&#39;s heard me talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
So, at some point, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be able to spout the &quot;party <br/>
line.&quot;  However, given how shy he is, I wonder if he&#39;ll clam up at the last <br/>
minute, too.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My kids answer pretty much the same way. Sometimes with &quot;we just have fun&quot;<br/>
which usually translates for the other person into &quot;we don&#39;t do anything.&quot;<br/>
It really doesn&#39;t bother me and I feel no need to defend the position by<br/>
telling people we actually do &quot;something.&quot; I usually reply that while the<br/>
kids sit and do nothing, I sit and eat bon bons and watch TV all day!!!<br/>
<br/>
Of course that&#39;s the wise ass in me. It&#39;s hard to get rid of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-72092449">Sometimes I tell people that I think most of what kids study in school <br/>
gets forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
But I also like you discussing the inspiring things that your kid(s) are <br/>
doing.  That&#39;s probably the most persuasive testimony that you can give.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834786590">** Anyone else have stories like this one? How do your kids expalin<br/>
unschooling? What have you suggested they say?**<br/>
<br/>
My kids usually  respond to questions about what they do with comments like<br/>
&quot;we play all day&quot; or &quot;we do whatever we want to do&quot;. I heard Jacob telling<br/>
one his friends (who is homeschooled) that he played all day and didn&#39;t have<br/>
to do schoolwork. His friend didn&#39;t believe him and came and questioned me.<br/>
I told him Jacob was telling the truth and his mouth dropped open and he<br/>
said &quot;but how will he learn?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If the questioning is about what or how they learn, they usually say &quot;we<br/>
learn lots of things every day&quot; and often include an example, like making<br/>
things or experimenting in the kitchen or something they saw on TV. My boys<br/>
are 10 and 8.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028385464">Hiyas all,<br/>
<br/>
I think for me one of the best ways I have &#39;seen&#39; that my daughter <br/>
knows and on some levels &#39;gets&#39; why she is not in school &quot;like <br/>
everyone one else&quot; (her words) is this;<br/>
<br/>
I was watching my friends kids one night a week while she and hubby <br/>
worked odd hours, he would bring them over around 9pm and they would <br/>
have to go right to bed so they could be up in the a.m. for school.<br/>
<br/>
After a few weeks my daughter (who wants to goto school and feels she <br/>
is missing something there more often than not it seems) said to <br/>
me &quot;Mom the little girl is jealous that I have no bed time and I feel <br/>
bad for her&quot;. I encouraged her to write a note to her friend (since <br/>
they don&#39;t get to talk much seeing as how the schedules were set up).<br/>
<br/>
All along I have been telling my daughter why I continue along this <br/>
path called home/un schooling, what I enjoy about it, what it means <br/>
to me and us as a family, what I recall about going to school as a <br/>
child good and bad. But moment to moment she rejects my opinion <br/>
saying she wants to try school anyway.<br/>
<br/>
That being said her note reads like this she wrote a nice little note.<br/>
<br/>
After reading it I questioned her and she explained in depth how much <br/>
she understands all the things I tell her about what why we do what <br/>
we do, and how much she sees the truth of it in our daily life even <br/>
tho she tells me more often than not she&#39;d rather we didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
She also said she understands that tho this is right for our family <br/>
it doesn&#39;t mean other families making different choices are making <br/>
wrong ones.<br/>
<br/>
Which all speaks to the fact that I have given her those truths in <br/>
word and deed all along. It was the first time I had heard her <br/>
express it in a way I knew she really does believe it deep down. And <br/>
it came at a time when she could see someone she cared about outside <br/>
of the situation was worried that they were on the wrong side of <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not I guess ha ha funny but cute in a kid way which always makes <br/>
me smile.<br/>
<br/>
In chance daily encounters I am most likely to be the one saying we <br/>
don&#39;t really do anything special just live our lives with the <br/>
learning as a goal and after thought simultaneously. Because it&#39;s <br/>
hard to explain in a sound byte and not all the truly great moments <br/>
or factual implants seem like all that in the moment. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082158664">My 16 yo daughter had a similar interview. We tackled it by writing a letter<br/>
in advance. At first she didn&#39;t know what to say in the letter, but I helped<br/>
her start with: &quot;I have been home educated in an environment that encourages<br/>
self led learning. My parents&#39; philosophy on education is that people learn<br/>
best when they are interested in the topic they are studying. So, my<br/>
learning has been interest based.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This opened the door for a long letter about her music, her reading &<br/>
writing,  various computer programs she&#39;s used, how she learns about<br/>
different cultures from the Wwoofers we host (Willing Workers On Organic<br/>
Farms), her goals, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
After doing this she was able to approach the interview feeling positive<br/>
about her learning, instead of fearful that she hadn&#39;t learned enough.<br/>

past and that past was not an &quot;unschooling&quot; per say model since I have just recently <br/>
become commited and really aware of what that means.<br/>
<br/>
My son has sort of quoted me in that I have heard him explain to questioning people <br/>
that &quot;everything we do every day is school work&quot;.  &quot;We are learning all the time with <br/>
everything we do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I didn&#39;t understand when I said that and he repeated it, was the true meaning of <br/>
unschooling.  I am glad that we at least had those sentiments from the start.  I think <br/>
as we continue along, it will help.  I have always explained to inquiring people that <br/>
everything in every day life can be a learning experience, from cooking to cleaning to <br/>
grocery shopping to playing games and visiting the zoo.  What&#39;s funny is that I didn&#39;t <br/>
really internalize it until now.  I always believed in the concept but was fearful to let <br/>
go of the &quot;curriculum.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-997090086">Rowan, Dagny and I have great conversations about unschooling.   Dagny<br/>
(who&#39;s 11) reads the dotcom message boards - the &#39;adult&#39; sections - every<br/>
day and has read most of the books about unschooling/peaceful parenting that<br/>
I have.  Does anyone else have kids who are interested in parenting<br/>
philosophies and unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
She was asked a lot of questions about it at a sleepover recently.  From<br/>
what I heard later, it sounds like she gave answers that a regular poster on<br/>
dotcom would have given.  She&#39;s pretty cool :0).  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848564529">Wes Beach is  well known in the California homeschool community - he <br/>
runs Beach High School in Santa Cruz, with students from all over the <br/>
country -<br/>
&quot;Beach High School offers you, if you&#39;re a teenager, an opportunity to <br/>
gain the freedom to pursue your authentic interests and develop your <br/>
natural talents outside of a traditional high school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wes gives kids a diploma - sometimes within a week or two of enrollment <br/>
- more often a year or two after enrollment. He has no particular <br/>
academic requirements for graduation - just that they are ready to move <br/>
on. One of the ways they can earn a diploma is to write an essay.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to post his description of what he suggests including in the <br/>
essay, because Julie&#39;s post about her son and the college admissions <br/>
questions made me think that these might be very useful points for <br/>
unschoolers to prepare to talk about for college admissions. Wes&#39;s <br/>
website has more information - he is a STRONG supporter of unschooling <br/>
and has been an amazing source of inspiration and strength to countless <br/>
teenagers and their parents.<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html">http://members.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here are his essay instructions:<br/>
<br/>
Include in your essay the following:<br/>
	• 	Your past educational experience. This can begin with the utterance <br/>
of your first word, with a description of your wonderful fifth grade <br/>
teacher or your terrible eighth grade English teacher, with an account <br/>
of a trip to Australia, or at any other point in your life. It should <br/>
include those parts of your education that you think are the important <br/>
ones; they can be experiences in school and/or outside of it, they <br/>
certainly don&#39;t have to be limited to the narrow academic areas that <br/>
school deals with, and they can be positive and/or negative.<br/>
	• 	Your goals for the next few years. You do not have to have a lot of <br/>
specific plans, but to the extent you do I&#39;d like to read about them.<br/>
	• 	Your skills. There used to be sections here on reading and math, <br/>
but I&#39;ve come to the point where I believe there are more important <br/>
skills. To successfully get on with your life, you need to be able to <br/>
seek out necessary information, deal with people you encounter, and set <br/>
up opportunities for yourself through planning, job interviews, college <br/>
applications, and so on. Reading and arithmetic at a very basic level <br/>
are important for everyone, but only as two skills among many. As I was <br/>
thinking about writing this section, it occurred to me that food <br/>
handling is more important than math; if you don&#39;t know which foods to <br/>
put in the refrigerator, you might kill yourself. Reading and <br/>
mathematics--especially reading--do take on added importance if you <br/>
want a lot of formal academic education. Please write something about <br/>
the degree to which you possess each skill listed above in bold type, <br/>
and any special difficulties you may have (learning &quot;disabilities,&quot; <br/>
etc.). Also, write about any special skills you believe you have.<br/>
	• 	Your emotional sturdiness. Of all the characteristics that will <br/>
make you successful, I believe that emotional sturdiness is most <br/>
important, and that self-knowledge and confidence are two vital <br/>
components of this. If you are clear about what you are capable of <br/>
doing and are confident of your success in your chosen endeavors, you <br/>
will be successful. Do you feel you do know your own capabilities well? <br/>
Are you confident in yourself? Are there any emotional issues in your <br/>
life that are problematic? Can you deal with these issues?<br/>
	• 	Your passions. What do you do that allows you to concentrate fully, <br/>
to become completely absorbed, to lose track of time and all your <br/>
worries? Sing? Hike alone in the woods? Volunteer at an animal shelter? <br/>
Play chess? Throw pots? Write poems?<br/>
	• 	Your intelligences. Read the section titled Seeing Your <br/>
Intelligence before you write about this. What activities do you engage <br/>
in that allow you most fully to express yourself? The same question can <br/>
be asked this way: How do you demonstrate your strongest intelligences? <br/>
Are they related to your passions? Did you get to use them fully in <br/>
school? Did the fact that school typically focuses only on the use of <br/>
words and numbers cause problems for you?<br/>
	• 	Any specific life experiences you&#39;ve had that have enabled you to <br/>
grow into a more mature, stronger, wiser, more knowledgeable, and more <br/>
accomplished person: working, learning to set tile, traveling, living <br/>
through a divorce, caring for a sick family member, becoming an <br/>
accomplished dancer, facing a tough life issue, etc. Again, don&#39;t limit <br/>
yourself to the narrow academic concerns of traditional schooling.<br/>
	• 	And, finally, why you deserve a diploma. Be very specific and <br/>
detailed about this. Make it very clear why you&#39;re finished with high <br/>
school and, in a concrete way, tell me what you&#39;re going to do next and <br/>
how you&#39;re going to get started. You don&#39;t have to have elaborate <br/>
plans--just a direction and a starting point.<br/>
  It isn&#39;t appropriate to write, “I deserve a diploma because I want  <br/>
one.” You deserve a diploma if you have the interests, talents, skills, <br/>
  and confidence to move on with your life beyond high school.<br/>
<br/>
Do not believe that your life isn&#39;t interesting or valuable enough to <br/>
write about. There will never be a valedictorian at Beach High School <br/>
because I don&#39;t believe there is any possible way to decide that one <br/>
set of accomplishments is more significant than another. Many BHS <br/>
students who have written essays have won awards and scholarships, <br/>
traveled extensively, or reached high goals at a young age. But you can <br/>
write a wonderful essay too, even if you&#39;ve never won any contest or <br/>
been publicly recognized in any way and all your friends live within <br/>
six blocks. A single moment in your life when you&#39;ve recognized a <br/>
humble but important truth can be just as important to you as anything <br/>
else that anyone has ever done. &quot;Any life explored in depth is unique, <br/>
even extraordinary, and if told at all well anyone&#39;s story is unusual.&quot; <br/>
(Charles B. Strozier, Apocalypse,p. 23.)<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;ve rambled on for a while, I&#39;ll say that what all this comes <br/>
down to is, Who are you, where are you headed, and why do you believe <br/>
you&#39;ll succeed?<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Funniest explanations of unschooling by<br/>
your kids<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So my 17 yr old son and I visited a college this past weekend. He had an<br/>
interview with<br/>
&gt; one of the admissions people and was asked about his educational<br/>
background. This<br/>
&gt; school has admitted lots of homeschoolers so they were familiar with<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son, though, asks, &quot;Have you ever heard of unschooling?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Admissions lady says, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So my son proceeds to explain it like this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;My mom traditionally homeschooled me for most of my life. But then she<br/>
started a<br/>
&gt; business a few years ago. She got overwhelmed with homeschool so she<br/>
decided to<br/>
&gt; unschool where we can do whatever we want in order to learn whatever we<br/>
want.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He was then asked what he had learned and he told her that he couldn&#39;t<br/>
remember<br/>
&gt; anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What?!?!?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the debrief with me, I reminded him that I&#39;ve had my business for five<br/>
years and that it<br/>
&gt; had nothing to do with changing to unschooling. Secondly I asked him what<br/>
he meant<br/>
&gt; when he said he hadn&#39;t learned much or couldn&#39;t remember anything! This is<br/>
the Klingon<br/>
&gt; speaking, guitar and piano playing, book reading, computer programming,<br/>
Shakespeare<br/>
&gt; performing, sign language skilled kid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, boiled down it turns out that when put in a &quot;schoolish&quot; context he<br/>
just couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understand how to explain us or his learning. He did say that once the<br/>
conversation got<br/>
&gt; going, her found himself sharing lots of good that had come of our<br/>
educational style citing<br/>
&gt; books and history we had studied together as well as mentioning some of<br/>
the above. it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just that he didn&#39;t think that was what she wanted to hear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It made me conscious of how important it is to give our kids language to<br/>
express what we<br/>
&gt; do when asked by school type people. I thought I had done that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Apparently not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else have stories like this one? How do your kids expalin<br/>
unschooling? What have<br/>
&gt; you suggested they say?<br/>

just what I want my mil to hear when she visits this fall! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly (12) was helping with a Q&A session at the convention in Las Vegas, and <br/>
when asked what she does with her days said &quot;I sleep a lot and watch TV.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t know the bad response that would make in some of the undecided. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Had they asked her about particular things, talked to her about the world, <br/>
they would&#39;ve been impressed, but she doesn&#39;t know &quot;the right answers&quot; and they <br/>
didn&#39;t know the right questions.<br/>

Those kinds of conversations are SO FUNNY (in a sad funny way), and that was <br/>
a gem.<br/>
<br/>
Catherine just didn&#39;t know it&#39;s a traditional dialog with another traditional <br/>
part (&#39;yes&#39;) and then short answers to what school, who&#39;s your teacher, do <br/>
you like her, and what&#39;s your favorite subject?<br/>
<br/>
After a hundred years of that being the conversation older people have with <br/>
younger people, I wonder how long it will take for it to be amended and the <br/>
older people to really listen to what the kids are saying?<br/>

It happened when we joined the 4H club (it is not a homeschool 4H club, <br/>
but the people there are very aware of homeschooling). It happened once <br/>
at the ice rink - where homeschoolers have one day a month special <br/>
rates. So - that will probably replace the other traditional start-up <br/>
conversation.<br/>

We saw Bill Cosby live the other night. He brought a 10 yo up from the <br/>
audience and asked her, &quot;Do you like school?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;What do <br/>
you like about it?&quot; &quot;Everything.&quot; &quot;Even math?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Go sit down.&quot; <br/>

I kept my mouth shut because I didn&#39;t want to step on Catherine&#39;s toes but I was getting a little steamed myself at the dentist and her half distracted conversation. If she didn&#39;t want answers why ask the questions? Imagine how interesting it could have been for her if she&#39;d just listened. Oh well...Her loss.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091926094">I think the funniest thing that happened to us in regards to unschooling <br/>
was when we were at the state tournament for Destination Imagination.  <br/>
At the end of the day, the team manager and three of the kids, and two <br/>
more parents (lexie included) all went to see the score the kids earned <br/>
on their central challenge.  The name of our group is &quot;Dragontree <br/>
Homelearners&quot; so I thought it was pretty obvious we were homeschoolers, <br/>
but the judge just didn&#39;t get it.  He said to the kids &quot;ok, you guys <br/>
know when you are in school and you only get 50 out of 100 points on a <br/>
test, and that&#39;s bad in school?&quot;  The kids just looked at him with blank <br/>
expressions.  The guy tried again &quot;you know in school, if you only get <br/>
half the points on a test, then you failed the test...&quot;  The kids were <br/>
still looking at him as though he was talking a strange language.  The <br/>
team leader finally said &quot;they don&#39;t go to school, they don&#39;t take <br/>
tests, they are homeschooled.&quot;  The man looked really confused and then <br/>
said &quot;they don&#39;t take tests?&quot;  This was obviously an amazing fact to <br/>
him, how could any child reach age 9 and not understand or take tests?  <br/>
So he then tried again with the kids &quot;ok, on a test, if you only get 50 <br/>
questions right out of 100, then...&quot;  I spoke up and said something like <br/>
&quot;they don&#39;t take tests, they are homeschooled.&quot;  If he had just said <br/>
&quot;normally 50% is not good but in DI it is very good&quot; the kids would have <br/>
gotten that immediately, but instead he was trying to relate this to <br/>
school and testing and none of the three kids involved had ever been to <br/>
school, besides preschool, and didn&#39;t understand at all.  He finally did <br/>
explain the scores to the kids and to us, but every few minutes he would <br/>
look at the adults with a very strange look and say something like &quot;they <br/>
don&#39;t take tests?&quot;  or &quot;they don&#39;t have to go to school?&quot;  On the way <br/>
back to the hotel the kids and I discussed percentages, and all three of <br/>
them very much understood percentages, but didn&#39;t understand 50% being <br/>
bad or failing.  A percentage was just a portion of something based on <br/>
100.   <br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; older people to really listen to what the kids are saying?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been happily surprised to hear my children asked, by adults, &quot;Do<br/>
&gt; you go to school?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It happened when we joined the 4H club (it is not a homeschool 4H club,<br/>
&gt; but the people there are very aware of homeschooling). It happened once<br/>
&gt; at the ice rink - where homeschoolers have one day a month special<br/>
&gt; rates. So - that will probably replace the other traditional start-up<br/>
&gt; conversation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We saw Bill Cosby live the other night. He brought a 10 yo up from the<br/>
&gt; audience and asked her, &quot;Do you like school?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;What do<br/>
&gt; you like about it?&quot; &quot;Everything.&quot; &quot;Even math?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Go sit down.&quot;<br/>
&gt; BIG laugh from audience.<br/>

conference going on during the next few days.  It&#39;s interesting you <br/>
mention Wes Beach, because he&#39;s the guest tomorrow morning.  I guess <br/>
you call the number and can ask a personal question of different <br/>
homeschooling people, who will answer questions on specific topics.  <br/>
Tomorrow is Pat Farenga talking about unschooling. <br/>

You know, it&#39;s really cool that  many unschooled kids don&#39;t know those right<br/>
answers isn&#39;t it. There&#39;s no need to perform for others to gain approval or<br/>
worth. One experience can have as much value as another, ie watching TV then<br/>
reading a book or discussing politics. There is no pressure to meet outside<br/>
expectations of &quot;productivity&quot; so they can be honest and real about who they<br/>
are and what they do. Reminds me of something Jacob (8yos) said two days<br/>
ago--learning free. Very cool!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julie, this reminded me of the admissions advisor I met at the college this last weekend. <br/>
He told me that he had had good experiences with most homeschooled kids. Maybe 4 out <br/>
of 100 weren&#39;t prepared for their school (St. John&#39;s college).<br/>
<br/>
He went on to say that the reason their particular college doesn&#39;t trust SAT tests is that <br/>
they rely more on testing a student&#39;s cunning than their aptitude to learn. He said that <br/>
their college, otoh, preferred students without guile.<br/>
<br/>
Without guile<br/>
<br/>
Guileless.<br/>
<br/>
I realized that that was what happened with my son. He responded without guile or <br/>
cunning. He told the truth as he understood it. And he even got around to sharing things <br/>
that did explain his &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we underappreciate that quality of guilessness... Perhaps I do.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have found that when schooled kids are asked &quot;what did you do at school<br/>
<br/>
today?&quot;, the answer is usually &quot;Nothing.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I always said.  And the answer to &quot;What did you do today?&quot; was <br/>
usually &quot;nothing&quot; too, until I thought about it.<br/>
<br/>
The things I learned at school that were exciting and worth reporting to my <br/>
mom were things like whose parents were getting a divorce, or who ran away or <br/>
wrecked a car or got pregnant.  <br/>
<br/>
Then years and years later I read Howard Gardner and figured I just was an <br/>
interpersonal intelligence kind of person.  At school, that meant sometimes I&#39;d <br/>
get a report card with lots of As and a C in conduct.  &quot;Too much talking.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Not here to socialize.&quot;  Often, bad conduct grades.  It &#39;bout drove me crazy to <br/>
sit in that desk quietly for half an hour after I&#39;d finished my work.  And <br/>
often the only reward was we started other work without me getting to even get <br/>
up and stretch and wiggle and squeal or sing; still in the same desk for the <br/>
next fifteen minute exercise after which I&#39;d have to sit still for another <br/>
thirty minutes.    YUCK!<br/>
<br/>
Every day there was WAY more &quot;nothing&quot; than something, unless there was <br/>
interpersonal news. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591136297">Hayden (age 5) came to me after a discussion on automatic vs standard <br/>
transmissions and announced, &quot;I figured this out on my own, so I <br/>
don&#39;t want to be homeschooled anymore!&quot;  I asked, &quot;Do you think that <br/>
going to school means you get to figure it out on your own?&quot; I got <br/>
the BIG eye roll and a sigh, &quot;HOMEschool is when mom is your teacher, <br/>
