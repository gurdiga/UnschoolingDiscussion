 </span></blockquote>Yep, sounds like our &quot;advocate&quot; here in FL. She helped push through a law <br/>
that prevents any kids that are truant AND had trouble with the law from <br/>
homeschooling.  I was the ONLY one speaking up against it at a homeschool <br/>
meeting a couple years ago...they thought I was nuts.<br/>
Aren&#39;t those the kids that the school wants to get rid of? How does a law <br/>
like that make sense on any level? No one has the right to decide who can and <br/>
cannot homeschool.  All these fundies are so afraid of anyone making <br/>
homeschoolers &quot;look bad&quot; that they are actually limiting our freedoms. <br/>
Another reason that HSLDA is dangerous.<br/>
Kind of like the laws that require testing. Someone on here said they will <br/>
obey the law.....why? Why as an unschooler would you place the law above your <br/>
beliefs?<br/>
Laws have been unfair, invasive and dangerous. Why would a person that <br/>
unschools hold the law in such high regard as to do something that apparently <br/>
even some ps&#39;ers have protested against.<br/>
I think it is a persons duty to disregard laws that go against basic personal <br/>
freedoms.<br/>
