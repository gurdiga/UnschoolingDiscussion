<br/>
Honest is allowing people to respond, not letting them<br/>
to post and then cutting them off so that other are free<br/>
reply with fear of rebuttal.  You guys live very sheltered<br/>
lives.<br/>

academia says that we are living sheltered lives (unlike those who live in <br/>
school-land).<br/>

Michael runs his own list, turns out, where he&#39;s badmouthing unschooling and <br/>
other things.<br/>
He sent an announcement to invited people to his list, but because it was <br/>
insulting it wasn&#39;t passed through tot he list.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s so worked up he can&#39;t even write well, and yet he keeps writing.   Some <br/>
kind of mania.   He should spend that time with his kids instead.    <br/>
<br/>
That list, if anyone wants to go and discuss these things with him on his own <br/>
turf, is <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HSDiscussions/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HSDiscussions/</a><br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t think he mentioned there, and didn&#39;t mention here, is that he&#39;s <br/>
working on a PhD in Education.   What he does mention there is that he was <br/>
thrown off another homeschooling list recently.   He detailed it.   Honestly, he <br/>
could be spending that time with his children.<br/>
<br/>
One of our moderators (there are several) wrote this of the list, and it <br/>
applies here:<br/>
<br/>
-=- This list is for people who want to unschool, or who (whether<br/>
they want to or not) think unschooling might be what their kids need.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The purpose of this list is not to wrestle with people who don&#39;t want to<br/>
unschool just for exercise, or to entertain spectators.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. . .that&#39;s the purpose of the waiting period, to let people do some of <br/>
their<br/>
own reading and thinking, rather than banging their spoons on their<br/>
trays and insisting we feed them whatever they want.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Last night Keith and I were reviewing the day, and we both had stories of our <br/>
kids being sweet to each other, and funny, and surprising us with their <br/>
generosity.   Not many people&#39;s days end so nicely.<br/>
