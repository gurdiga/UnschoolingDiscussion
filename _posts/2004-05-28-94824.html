<div id="ygrps-yiv-854731711">The purpose of this list is clearly to discuss unschooling.  Getting off <br/>
topic sometimes is inevitable.  Dragging a political matter here and trying to get <br/>
it to stick is unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
Below is the text of a post I&#39;ve rejected, yet I&#39;m posting. &lt;g&gt;   The <br/>
sender&#39;s e-mail address has been inserted so those who are interested can write to <br/>
her as requested in the text.   Other than this, then, let&#39;s try to keep <br/>
non-unschooling, non-homeschooling stuff elsewhere.  <br/>

====================<br/>
<br/>
I received the email about the draft a month or so ago and became very <br/>
alarmed. I researched it and asked around and there was so much speculation <br/>
and <br/>
disinformation surrounding these bills. Many people thought they had died and <br/>
weren&#39;t even being considered, so they weren&#39;t worried...except in New York <br/>
where <br/>
some friends of my parents mentioned it was still a very hot issue in the <br/>
press. <br/>
<br/>
According to my Congressman&#39;s office and Congress&#39; Thomas search Engine it <br/>
has not died; though, for such a disturbing bill it is not receiving much <br/>
press <br/>
outside of NY to my knowledge, and that makes me suspicious that the intent <br/>
is <br/>
to sneek it through. When I researched comments made re: these bills at the <br/>
Thomas website the thinking behind them is that if everyone is made eligible <br/>
for the draft and no one can get out of it or leave the country then Congress <br/>
won&#39;t be so quick to go to war because kids they care about will be drafted, <br/>
too. Rationale that makes no sense to me whatsoever. <br/>
<br/>
This is a very real bill and I created an email w/a sample letter and links <br/>
to congresspeople and lists of committee members whose committees these bills <br/>
are currently sitting in. If anyone is interested please email me and I&#39;m <br/>
very <br/>
happy to send it to you.   [<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Rosybluestar@...">Rosybluestar@...</a>] My feeling is that this bill <br/>
is way too dangerous for speculation as to whether it will be passed into <br/>
law. I&#39;ve never felt <br/>
stronger in my life about taking action on anything...these are our babies <br/>
and <br/>
grandchildren whose lives are being threatened. <br/>
<br/>
Shane is half Canadian and I have his dual citizenship paperwork here. After <br/>
he was born and I registered him with the Social security office I <br/>
immediately <br/>
regretted it because of a potential draft (and other reasons, too). Anyway in <br/>
Canada, if you have dual citizenship and you are called to serve in the <br/>
military in a country where you are also a citizen that country&#39;s citizenship <br/>
takes <br/>
priority over your Canadian citizenship. I have to double check but I think <br/>
merely renouncing your citizenship of the other country won&#39;t cut it. <br/>
Thankfully sneaking across the border is always an option!<br/>
<br/>
Shane asked me to help him find countries w/out the draft that will welcome <br/>
our dogs and kitties, so we can move before he turns 18, if the law is <br/>
passed. <br/>
I hadn&#39;t mentioned it to him (he&#39;s 5 1/2) until I realised this is so very <br/>
real and researched it and took action. He feels much better now that he has <br/>
taken action, too....knowing he has options and that he won&#39;t be 18 for a <br/>
long <br/>
time, but we do know so many people who will be affected by this if it gets <br/>
through.<br/>
