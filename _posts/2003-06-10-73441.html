  &gt; &lt;&lt;Unschooling is a fantastic oppertunity for self motivated individuals<br/>
  &gt; but with lazy and unmotivated people it is more difficult. ( again that<br/>
  &gt; probably sound harsh but these guys will do as little as possible even <br/>
  &gt; accepting<br/>
  &gt; punishment rather than help out or even take care of their own things)&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
  Well, what on earth caused  this perfect, whole, wonderful newborn you had to <br/>
  become &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;unmotivated&quot;?  I doubt you saw him as a lazy and <br/>
  unmotivated toddler?<br/>
  Could it be that punishment and school have actually CAUSED these character <br/>
  traits, rather than him being a flawed individual. He HAS interests, honor <br/>
  them.<br/>
  He is just fine the way he is, he simply needs time to heal. A year off? What <br/>
  do you have to lose at this point? Obviously the current methods have created <br/>
  a lazy, unmotivated individual ( I truly, really hope you drop these very <br/>
  thoughts from your head though) and the best thing you could do to reverse that <br/>
  damage is to take a year off and focus on being his friend, not punishing him <br/>
  and getting really excited about the interests he DOES have.<br/>
