<div id="ygrps-yiv-851935414">A little background: Over a year ago, when we were still waffling <br/>
about homeschooling and before learning about unschooling, ds (now 4 <br/>
1/2) attended a semester of preschool. As best we could discern, he <br/>
seemed ok with being taken out- though he didn&#39;t hate school by any <br/>
stretch and had in fact had just started warming up to the structure <br/>
of it and participating a lot more when he quit- which I didn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily see as a positive thing.<br/>
<br/>
Well, several months after stopping he started saying pretty often <br/>
that he wanted to go back to his preschool. I muddled through a bunch <br/>
of excuses and reasons why we couldn&#39;t do that and we eventually <br/>
settled on trying a new &quot;school&quot; which was a once a week homeschool <br/>
co-op where he does a mixed age Spanish class and then <br/>
play/craft/game/activity time- all pretty unstructured. This seems to <br/>
have satisfied his need and he seems to like the idea of having <br/>
a &quot;school&quot; and a &quot;teacher.&quot; Except for the first few weeks with the <br/>
co-op last fall and very briefly the other day when he saw his old <br/>
school backpack, he hasn&#39;t mentioned any desire to go back to the <br/>
preschool.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I should add is that ds is very perceptive and seems <br/>
to strongly sense we do things pretty differently than all of our <br/>
family and most of our friends. He doesn&#39;t take our word for much- <br/>
has great curiosity about the things &quot;everyone else&quot; does and seems <br/>
to almost have a &quot;grass is greener&quot; mentality toward many things. <br/>
<br/>
I feel like we&#39;ve made great strides in re-establishing trust after a <br/>
rocky beginning coming from traditional parenting and in really <br/>
trying to help him explore the world and making fun, play and freedom <br/>
our way of being.<br/>
<br/>
In light of all the above, these are the things I&#39;m trying to work <br/>
through:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Now that he has experienced school in these ways- for better or <br/>
worse- how to best frame it in an unschooling way? It feels <br/>
inconsistent when people ask if he&#39;s in school and I say we&#39;re <br/>
homeschooling, but then we refer to the co-op as his school. I wish I <br/>
could do away with the labels altogether, but I&#39;d settle for <br/>
something uncomplicated that helps him feel most like a &quot;normal&quot; kid.<br/>
<br/>
* When/if to bring up the subject of &quot;regular&quot; school- wait for him <br/>
to bring it up? Continue to treat his coop school as such until he <br/>
expresses a need otherwise? It makes me a little sick to my stomach <br/>
to think about asking him this summer if he wants to go to <br/>
kindergarten...I feel like I need more time to get better at <br/>
unschooling and to just plain keep my baby home a little longer.<br/>
<br/>
* What to say when the questions about &quot;regular&quot; school come-  How to <br/>
postively frame my beliefs about school and preference for <br/>
unschooling in a way most likely to be attractive to my guy? Is is ok <br/>
to play a little dirty and really drive home all the bad stuff about <br/>
school, lol?<br/>
<br/>
* My primary purpose and experience with unschooling so far has been <br/>
to do it for the joy of it...yet I find part of me feeling pressure <br/>
and a motive to do it and do it really well so that the contrast will <br/>
be sharp and real when/if he decides to go to school. Is this a bad <br/>
thing? <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for your feedback,<br/>
Kristin</div>
