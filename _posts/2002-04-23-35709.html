This peeked my interest :) They have a disease, but are still used for beef. Does anyone know what disease this is?<br/>

&lt;&lt; A cow is a cow is a cow.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Linguistically speaking, that&#39;s true.  The medieval word was pluralized <br/>
&quot;kyne&quot; (more than one cow).   There&#39;s a lot of linguistic coolness around <br/>
cow/beef.  The reason it&#39;s &quot;boeuf&quot; when it&#39;s on the table is because of the <br/>
Norman Invasion of England, and the English loss of the Battle of Hastings.  <br/>
(It&#39;s why a deer on the table is &quot;venison,&quot; and a chicken on the table is <br/>
&quot;poultry,&quot; etc.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-667736916">And in Australia they run whole herds of bulls for slaughter.  This meat is<br/>
extremely lean and is added to regular ground beef to lean it up.<br/>
<br/>
Some cattle come naturally without horns, such as Angus and Polled<br/>
Herefords, most others are dehorned at an early age.  Horned Herefords<br/>
aren&#39;t dehorned and weights are placed on the ends so they curve instead of<br/>
sticking straight out.  Shorthorns are both beef and dairy cattle, one of<br/>
the few breeds that is generally so designated.<br/>
<br/>
And two beef breeds that are usually not sold for beef are Watusi and<br/>
Longhorns.  They are both rich man&#39;s toys now.<br/>

through contaminated body fluids and in milk.  It is almost non-existant in<br/>
