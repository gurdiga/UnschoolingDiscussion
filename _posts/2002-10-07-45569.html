<div id="ygrps-yiv-234381226">Deb,<br/>
<br/>
I have 531 unread e-mails, but I HOPE some of them are pointing out to you <br/>
that writing on lists like this and saying things that make other people <br/>
think and change is as real as writing gets and that you do it well.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; I just thought this needed repeating. Maybe Deb should write a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; book.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;G&gt;  &quot;Maniacal Musings&quot;?   &quot;The Obnoxious Opinions of a Nobody&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;s funny!  I can&#39;t even write a shopping list... &gt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986767559">That was nice Sandra, thank you.   As I look back through my in box here<br/>
I see your name over and over and your writing,  always so calm and<br/>
clear, and those are the ones I save and make my husband read and anyone<br/>
else who might be remotely interested.   At least once a week I tell<br/>
someone on the Montana unschoolers list to go to sandradodd.com because I<br/>
 know you can make the light come on for anyone who&#39;s tired of being in<br/>
the dark.   So, there are words on a page, and then there&#39;s writing,  and<br/>
you&#39;re awesome.<br/>
