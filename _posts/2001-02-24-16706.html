<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523345545">My oldest sometimes says he&#39;s bored. I tell him to go find something to do <br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it doesn&#39;t do to try to entertain them when they&#39;re in that <br/>
mood. Getting really bored is a great motivator for figuring out how to <br/>
entertain yourself!<br/>
<br/>
I do wish we had the option of just sending the kids out to play. We have <br/>
quite a bit of traffic on our street and our back yard is, well, boring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717975207">Hi, I&#39;d appreciate some input on a problem. My 14 dd has been relaxed-homeschooled for 4 years and unschooling starting this year. She has decided to go to high school next year. I am not thrilled but accept she wants to try it out. We live in an isolated area- friends for her are at least 20 min drive away and all in school. <br/>
I have been trying many of the ideas here and feel like I&#39;m getting the hang of it, read Sandra&#39;s article about boredom, about school on your own terms, etc. Just telling you this because I want to continue to unschool her until she goes to HS, and if she decides to come back out after a while. <br/>
But I feel stuck. She is just so bored right now. I think she just wants a wider world but I don&#39;t seem to be able to help her make that work. She has interest in theater which we pursue and always have, but I guess that isn&#39;t enough right now. I try to strew more info about things that interest her but she just isn&#39;t interested in much of anything. <br/>
Well, I feel like I&#39;m whining. I keep thinking there are lots of things she could be doing but her interest is not &#39;piqued&#39;. I kinda remember feeling restless too around that age. Has anyone else faced this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-520605528">LOL ! At 14 they can get boy crazy! (as my mom used to refer to it)<br/>
And they reach the age that they<br/>
know more than you, so be prepared.<br/>
this stage usually lasts for a few more years.<br/>
I would say that what used to work, needs some changing.<br/>
You might have to be creative and get a feel for what <br/>
her interests are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168014350">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My son is only 11 but we went through this last year.  Dustin attended public <br/>
school for grades k-3 1/2.  We just helped him find something that motivated <br/>
him. <br/>
For him this was surfing, we went several days a week to the beach and later <br/>
in the winter month it was snowboarding.  For my son he needs new <br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
To cure the at home boredom I brought him beside me in what I was doing to <br/>
see what interested him.  He became very interested in Ebay, half. Com and <br/>
began to sell stuff he no longer wanted. He thought this was great as he <br/>
could watch the bids all week. He still does this now and lists his own items <br/>
with some HTML, I review it and he posts. Its great!<br/>
<br/>
I have also said to him when he says he is bord &quot;well would you rather be <br/>
bord a couple times a week or you can go back to school if that is what you <br/>
want&quot; &quot;Um, no that&#39;s ok Im not bord anymore.&quot; He says.<br/>
<br/>
I also notice when he does say this that it is because I haven&#39;t spent enough <br/>
time with him.  Usually all he wants is to just on the trampoline with me or <br/>
play xbox.<br/>
<br/>
