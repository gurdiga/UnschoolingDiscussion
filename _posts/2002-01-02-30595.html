Been thinking about your post on this.  I remeber some book I read in<br/>
college called High Level Wellness (don&#39;t remember author).  He discussed at<br/>
some length the importance of using natural,  oragnis sweeteners like honey,<br/>
molasses, etc.  HOWEVER&lt;  when the book was revised,  the author had done a<br/>
180 on that.  Something about....sugar is sugar is sugar,  organic or not,<br/>
your body still reacts with the same hormones,  etc.<br/>
    While I understand somewhat what you&#39;re saying....I know plenty of<br/>
people who manage to consume sugar (refined or not) in moderation without<br/>
&quot;overriding&quot; their system.  I personally lean more toward having an<br/>
addictive reaction to sugar,  refined carbs.  My 21 yr old niece was<br/>
recently dx&#39;d with PCOS....her body is unable to metabolize insulin well.<br/>
Her cells have a hard time absorbing it,  though insulin is produced at<br/>
normal levels.  As a result,  she craves sugar.  She informed me that I am<br/>
in a high risk for PCOS considering the way it&#39;s passed genetically (and<br/>
considering I appear to have almost every symptom).<br/>
    I still go with the every - body&#39;s individual and has individual needs<br/>
in this area.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Agreed here Susan, to each and every body is its own barometer.<br/>
<br/>
If one has an insulin problem, then any kind of sugar, slow or fast <br/>
acting would be a detriment to the body.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;.sugar is sugar is sugar,  organic or not,<br/>
&gt;your body still reacts with the same hormones,  etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Refined sugar IS more addictive than honey or molasses or fruit sugar. If <br/>
there is evidence otherwise, I would welcome it.<br/>
<br/>
If one doesn&#39;t have an insulin problem, then the choice would be to go <br/>
towards the natural way, not the processed way. An insulin problem person <br/>
must limit more than just sugar. They need to limit fruit and other food <br/>
intake.<br/>
<br/>
In &quot;extended&quot; family, I am an organic household, so is one of my sisters. <br/>
My other two sisters are not. My niece is not. (she&#39;s just a few years <br/>
younger than I and has more children)<br/>
<br/>
The organic families have choices for the kids, no limits. They will <br/>
invariably ask for something to &#39;eat&#39; when they are hungry. As opposed to <br/>
just go into the cabinet for a nosh when wanting *something*.<br/>
<br/>
The processed food families seem to have to limit their children, cajole <br/>
them to &#39;eat&#39; food and oversee their intake on their choices.<br/>
<br/>
Establishing that none of the children spoken of have an insulin problem <br/>
(as of yet). I say that because processed sugar addictions is a <br/>
*possible* reason that a genetically disposed child would develop an <br/>
insulin problem (research is still being done, so no facts yet on this <br/>
issue).<br/>

While I understand that sugar is sugar is sugar, and that it may change your <br/>
insulin levels, it is my understanding that the natural sugars are superior <br/>
because they are self limiting.  When a person (or me) is hungry and craving <br/>
chocolate or some such sweet, it would really be very simple to have OD on <br/>
candy bars instead of a healthy meal.  With natural sweets like honey, it is <br/>
just impossible to eat that much.  Naturally self limiting.  You don&#39;t need <br/>
will power to refuse.<br/>
