<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141438978">You know what?  Maybe all of this religious/abortion discussion would<br/>
better be addressed on a list specifically devoted to religious issues. <br/>
Maybe one of you could begin such a list and allow this one to return to<br/>
to its original intended purpose.  There is nothing wrong with brief<br/>
discussions on tangent issues, but this one is rapidly spiraling out of<br/>
control.      Amy in NY<br/>

It is truly pointless to try and convince someone you<br/>
are &quot;right&quot;, when they are trying just as hard to<br/>
convince you that they are &quot;right&quot;. We all believe<br/>
differently on these subjects, let&#39;s get over it. How<br/>
do you guyz even have the time to devote to such<br/>
debates?<br/>
