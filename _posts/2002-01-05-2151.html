I&#39;ve been thinking it&#39;s time for a road trip down further southwest. It&#39;s <br/>
been awhile. Y&#39;all better be prepared for a knock on your door. ;-) Having <br/>

about 5 to 10 min. northeast of Burien (just south of Seattle).  It&#39;s <br/>
in between two golf courses and has a small itty bitty stream <br/>
running through the backyard as well as a small pond.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the house is very large and I&#39;d love to have people <br/>

We would love to be a home base for other unschooling families <br/>

mix.  If anyone is interested, let me know!!   The<br/>
house is located <br/>
about 5 to 10 min. northeast of Burien (just south of<br/>
Seattle).  It&#39;s <br/>
in between two golf courses and has a small itty bitty<br/>
stream <br/>
running through the backyard as well as a small pond.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the house is very large and I&#39;d love to<br/>
have people <br/>
come on over,,,,,,whenever!!!  That&#39;s after we move in<br/>
of course.<br/>
<br/>
We would love to be a home base for other unschooling<br/>
families <br/>
to gather.<br/>

Wow! Sounds like an awesome situation! I&#39;d love to get<br/>
up north and see WA and BC. Thanks for the invite.<br/>

Well, it took us 6 days to drive from NJ to WA this past<br/>
September.  Hubby drove the Ryder truck and pulled one<br/>
of our cars behind it, while I drove our other car with two <br/>
kids and two guinea pigs!   I was impressed that the kids<br/>
did soooo well!!   <br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could do it in 4 days if you&#39;re just driving<br/>
a regular car and not hauling anything behind you!  :-)<br/>

I keep forgetting how big America is. We&#39;ve barely ventured more than<br/>
hundred miles from home so far.<br/>
Good thing about england. You can be just about anywhere in less than a<br/>
day.<br/>
