&lt;&lt; Did you have to show some kind of ID to get this card?  I was thinking<br/>
about making one up on my computer and maybe laminating it.  Do <br/>
teacher ID cards have pics on them? Thanks<br/>

<br/>
not for this one.  they just take your word.  but i have a card from barnes <br/>
and noble (do you guys know about their 20% discount for teachers?)  so i <br/>
have used that card to get my zany brainy and hollywood video teachers cards. <br/>
 most places arent too sticky about it.  i dont know about making a card, bc <br/>
anyone could do that, so where&#39;s the proof?  like if they really wanted <br/>
proof, seems like they&#39;d need something more than a homemade card....  ?  <br/>
good luck.  erin</div>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m just wondering, have you ever known anyone whom unschooling did not <br/>
work for??  Are there any tales of tradgedy?  I&#39;m sure there are tales like <br/>
that no matter what educational method you choose, I&#39;m just wondering how one <br/>
prevents such a tragedy with unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i think this is a good question, bc it can alleviate fears and allow us to <br/>
relax.  not that there is a formula to follow (tho we all sometimes may wish <br/>
for that!) but that there are cases to be avoided.  however, even in the <br/>
tales of failure, i dont think i would blame it on the unschooling (even in <br/>
the case above, i bet there was more to it...)  kids can learn in spite of <br/>
strange attitudes.  tho it sounds like this strange attitude of the mama <br/>
could have done some damage, providing that rich environment, and taking them <br/>
places, etc couldnt have lead to &quot;failure&quot; i dont believe...<br/>
