<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how I feel, too. My mother was a HORRID mother, and I moved far away <br/>
when I got married. We rarely visited (since every visit would end up in a <br/>
fight), and almost never called, but after our son was born, we very quickly ended <br/>
up seeing them every Sunday. My mother (who is still pretty mean and rotten <br/>
to me) has ended up a pretty darn good grandmother. My FIL hates me (and from <br/>
DHs opinion, was an extremely rotten father) and tried to talk DH out of <br/>
marrying me a couple of weeks before the wedding, but he is a very loving <br/>
grandfather! There is NO WAY, however I feel about these people, that I could deny my <br/>
son the wonderful relationship he has with them. I had to bite the bullet at <br/>
first, but now that he is older and can spend time alone with them, it is much <br/>
easier. And no matter how tough it might have been on me in the beginning, it <br/>
is/was SO worth it. He asks to call them, to e-mail them, to visit them. Last <br/>
week, he spent the night 2 different nights at my parents, along with our <br/>
regular Sunday visit, and when we got home, he was sad because he missed them!! <br/>
How&#39;s that for unconditional love?! I&#39;m very happy for him. Hopefully, that will <br/>
translate to his kids, and even more hopefully, to his father and I when we are <br/>
old and decrepit! ;~D Thanks for sharing, Elizabeth!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92482616">It is an interesting anomaly.<br/>
<br/>
Many people feel free to enjoy children when they are not COMPLETELY <br/>
responsible for their upbringing. I&#39;ve known grandparents, <br/>
aunts/uncles, even neighbors, who could play with great abandon, as <br/>
long as it was with somebody else&#39;s kids.<br/>
<br/>
As far as daycare goes, it has become an expensive and extremely <br/>
limited option, for those who must work outside the home. I was the <br/>
youngest of 3 children and my mom babysat a number friends/neighbors, <br/>
over the years. It was like having younger sibilings for me. Finding <br/>
responsible people to provide this type of support is difficult these <br/>
days. In our city, full-day Public pre-school is now available for 3 <br/>
year olds, as a solution.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that there are a large number of families that have parents <br/>
that have overextended themselves. We live in New Jersey and I am <br/>
constantly amazed by the amount of farmland here that has been plowed <br/>
under and replaced by $700,000 houses. Who has families large enough <br/>
to fill these places? How many hours do both parents have to work to <br/>
pay those kind of mortgages? Whose watching the kids? -schools. <br/>
Clearly, that type of life was not your choice (or mine).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the fact that your parents can be &quot;Grand&quot;. It is good to see <br/>
that you don&#39;t seem to resent their new found abilities. Just make <br/>
sure that your homeschooling efforts are not being undermined <br/>
by &quot;schoolies&quot;. I try not to mention the &quot;UN&quot;-part too much when I <br/>
discuss our schooling with those types of family members. It tends to <br/>
make them doubt their own traditional approach to education and they <br/>
get defensive.<br/>
<br/>
My dd just turned 4 and unschooling suits her just fine. She will say <br/>
she want to go to school and do homework, but I think it comes from <br/>
watching PBS Kids shows, where everybody GOES to school. She does <br/>
inform people that she is a homeschooler when they ask her if she <br/>
goes to pre-school.<br/>
Live!<br/>
Learn!<br/>
Laugh!<br/>
p.s. I too am interested in Hand & Foot. It sounds fun!</div>

&lt;&lt; My mother (who is still pretty mean and rotten <br/>
to me) has ended up a pretty darn good grandmother. My FIL hates me (and from <br/>
DHs opinion, was an extremely rotten father) and tried to talk DH out of <br/>
marrying me a couple of weeks before the wedding, but he is a very loving <br/>
grandfather!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s very cool.<br/>
My mom was a crummy grandmother.  Really lame.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...  She was a good mom to my sister.<br/>
<br/>
My sister talked about this last  week, when I delivered my mom&#39;s ashes to <br/>
her.  She had told me on the phone that when I was at her house, she wanted me <br/>
to tell her what I thought about why I had been hurt by my mom and she didn&#39;t <br/>
seem to have been.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t really want to talk to her about it too much.  I planned a couple of <br/>
short statements to get out of it, and that worked fairly well.  What I <br/>
mainly did was to remind her that 20-some years ago, when my dad died, she had been <br/>
telling me bad things about her relationship with him (nothing horrid, just <br/>
frustrations and resentments) and I told her that he wasn&#39;t that way with me, <br/>
and that it was really okay (and inevitable) that her relationship with him was <br/>
hers, and separate from mine.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with friendships.  I have some friends other friends don&#39;t <br/>
like.  I see why.  I just don&#39;t hang out with them at the same time.  My husband <br/>
has some friends I don&#39;t have any fun around, but I do see why they enjoy being <br/>
together, so I just subtly arrange to be elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
My relationships with my three kids are different, in the ways that they&#39;re <br/>
different people, and in the ways I was different when we settled on patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s dad is the greatest grandparent my kids have.  He&#39;s much lighter and <br/>
looser with the kids than he was with his kids.    Keith&#39;s mom isn&#39;t light or <br/>
loose with anyone, and that&#39;s okay.  We just work around her inflexibility, <br/>
and we&#39;re all civil and as fakey-nice as we can be.  (Two weeks, we&#39;ll be <br/>
there...  preparing my smiles and slightly-forceful comebacks.)<br/>
<br/>
So I told my sister and her newish husband who doesn&#39;t know us very well and <br/>
hardly knew my mom (only in recent years when she was a mess) just a couple of <br/>
symbolic stories and summarized with them not needing to know more, just to <br/>
know that I had hurts Irene didn&#39;t need to know about.<br/>
<br/>
And Irene told me something I had never known.  She&#39;s 47, I&#39;m 50.  We were <br/>
the only two kids of that family.  My parents were married for 17 years.   My <br/>
mom used to tell Irene that my dad never wanted her, that he only loved me, but <br/>
that my MOM loved her and was glad to have her, and that I was just a daddy&#39;s <br/>
girl, but Irene was my mom&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s hardly designed to foster trust and warmth.<br/>
<br/>
So parents can screw up hugely, and I&#39;m glad I get to communicate with so <br/>
many people here and at unschooling.com and at conferences who have no interest <br/>
in settling for screwing up until the kids are gone.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m glad to hear stories of grandparents who see the value in being sweet <br/>
to grandchildren.  Maybe some of them kept on learning about children and <br/>
relationships even after their own children were gone.  Good for everyone <br/>
involved, and good for those who only vicariously get to hear about it from far away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038167889">Doesn&#39;t it make you a bit jealous? :) My husband and I both grew up <br/>
in very strict, over-bearing, over-protective households. Now that <br/>
we are grown, our parents are much more laid back and fun. Our son <br/>
has a great relationship with both sets of grandparents. I think it <br/>
is wonderful, but sometimes it does make me a bit jealous, not that <br/>
I ever say anything about it.  There is just a twinge when I see my <br/>
son having the relationship with my father that I wanted. But, I am <br/>
happy for the both of them. Instead of longing for that with my dad, <br/>
now that I am an adult, I can focus on creating the relationship I <br/>
want with my son. It still almost knocks me over everytime I hear my <br/>
dad say something like &#39;he&#39;s a kid, let him play, he&#39;s having fun&#39;, <br/>
when I would&#39;ve gotten in big trouble, as a child, for doing the <br/>
same thing. I think life does give you that perspective. I don&#39;t <br/>
want to be sixty before I see things that way. Peace - Tara<br/>

fine, you could tell what letter it was, and he didn&#39;t need any &quot;specific&quot; way <br/>
to make them, she had a fit and started to argue with me, but when I firmly <br/>
stood my ground, she looked me in the eye, saw that she wasn&#39;t going to win and <br/>
gave up! My only victory with her! LOL She&#39;s a mother-she should know better <br/>

me when he is around-which is fine with me!<br/>

and my hand is killing me. I&#39;m definitely going to<br/>
save that web the other versions sound cool. I&#39;m not<br/>
great at writing and was even willing to go up to the<br/>

I wasn&#39;t clear before it&#39;s my mother-in-law that I&#39;m<br/>
close with she is the mother I always dreamed of. She<br/>
is a war bride from Japan and when she moved here in<br/>
1952 her mother-in-law taught her about the states so<br/>
I think she thinks thats how all mother-in-laws<br/>
are(I&#39;m not going to enlighten her shes great)!!!! <br/>
I have a very stressed friendship with my own mom.<br/>
When she got pregnant with me and it had only been six<br/>
weeks since she had lost a pregnancy of six months.<br/>
she was very depressed and thinking of divorcing my<br/>
dad and there I came not a happy time for her,and I<br/>
was the scape goat. My brother who is older by 2 years<br/>
has a great friendship and my younger sister by 9yrs<br/>
also love her to death. I on the other hand get teased<br/>
in restaurants about how big my maturity underwear<br/>
were as I&#39;m tring to talk to the waiter definitely no<br/>
warm fuzz es there. We spent six weeks with her while<br/>
FL. is turning green and It was very very hard to to<br/>
keep a civil tongue around my kids. I can&#39;t say I feel<br/>
all that comfortable letting her babysit she is still<br/>
not soft and cozy and short tempered with kids but my<br/>
boys love her any way and that is great. I was hoping<br/>
she would get nicer but sometimes you get what you get<br/>

I am so glad to hear that she is not rotten to you in front of your son.  I<br/>
know someone who had a very cruel mother and she visits her now because she<br/>
says she&#39;s a wonderful grandmother but her mother still cuts her down in<br/>
front of her kids.  I personally wouldn&#39;t put up with that.  If she wanted<br/>
to be around her grandkids, she&#39;d have to treat me with respect. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm... I had never thought of that aspect. I think you&#39;re right... It <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be teaching (I know, that word! but I can&#39;t figure out what else to use...) <br/>
him how to be an adult or a parent. (Showing? :~) ) That would be a tough <br/>
one-I&#39;m sure glad I don&#39;t have to deal with it! :~) Thanks for giving me <br/>
something to think about!<br/>
