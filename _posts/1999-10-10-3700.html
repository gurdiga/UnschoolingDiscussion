<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433367661">Mary, I hate to see you go.  The Christian unschoolers, attachment parenting<br/>
types are a hopeful light in the dark for me.  I think (in my brain) that the<br/>
two are mutually hard to reconcile but I continue to see both on the internet<br/>
and here in Vancouver where I live people who combine the two quite gracefully.<br/>
<br/>
Yes keep shouting it from the rooftops.  I&#39;ll save this post of yours to pass on<br/>
to people in the future as it says volumes about a number of important issues.<br/>
Do drop by this list occasionally.  I understand the volume problem.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  I am glad for your website and I think I will bookmark it and pass<br/>
on it on to those folks who seem like they need it. Indeed best wishes.<br/>

&gt; Joel wrote&lt;&lt;&lt;Speaking of vaccinations:  I would avoid Hep B vaccinations for<br/>
&gt; children&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Reading this reminded me of the notice I got in the mail from the health<br/>
&gt; department a few weeks ago. It reads:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Immunization Changes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; HepatitisB is no longer being offered at birth to newborns (at least in<br/>
&gt; Idaho). HepatitisB is one of the vaccines containing thimerosol (no one ever<br/>
&gt; mentioned this word to me, ever. I had to learn it myself a few years back),<br/>
&gt; A bactericidal MERCURIC compound. To avoid any possible risk of MERCURY to<br/>
&gt; the developing newborn brain, physicians are choosing to delay Hep B series<br/>
&gt; until the infant is two months or older ( the rest is the revised schedule)<br/>
&gt; (parenthesis and emphasis mine)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I found this interesting. I have read (and posted) plenty of information on<br/>
&gt; vaccinations but never anything so self damning from the medical<br/>
&gt; community/government.  No one ever said the words thimerisol, mercuric or<br/>
&gt; mercury to me nor did I read it in any of the pamphlets they gave me when my<br/>
&gt; children were vaccinated (before I got myself educated). My oldest has all<br/>
&gt; but the ones you get right before you enter school and he missed out on the<br/>
&gt; HepB I believe (have records somewhere) my next one did his last at 18<br/>
&gt; months and I did refuse the hepB in the hospital and delayed it 2 months. My<br/>
&gt; youngest got to her 4 months shots and low and behold she is by far the most<br/>
&gt; healthy, able to fight sickness, robust child of them all (my other two are<br/>
&gt; step and I haven&#39;t got mom convinced yet).  I still have much to learn but<br/>
&gt; after what I have read and heard so far I am definitely on a better track<br/>
&gt; than I was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for delivery, My oldest was born in a small hospital, great doctor but<br/>
&gt; very main stream. They couldn&#39;t monitor baby that well (I was heavy) so they<br/>
&gt; suggested one of those monitors that they reach in and SCREW to the babies<br/>
&gt; skull. That spot got infected and he had to be on antibiotics before he was<br/>
&gt; a week old. Aside from that major problem the rest was cake. My second was<br/>
&gt; born in a much larger hospital. My friend had had her son there a few months<br/>
&gt; prior and she had told me a story of the nurse wheeling her baby off in the<br/>
&gt; baby cart thing and not knowing that grandma was right behind her, used the<br/>
&gt; cart to push open the doors, jarring the baby. Grandma got irate. I got an<br/>
&gt; earful before I even went in so I went in on the offensive. Delivery was<br/>
&gt; fine but right afterwards, as they were getting ready to move us to our room<br/>
&gt; (used a &#39;birthing room&#39; but you can&#39;t stay there past an hour) some burley<br/>
&gt; nurse came over to me sitting in a wheel chair and started, without warning<br/>
&gt; I might add, punching me in the stomach (or so it seemed) she was pushing<br/>
&gt; and pushing really hard while I was in a sitting position. No one ever<br/>
&gt; mentioned this to me, it didn&#39;t happen with my first child and it was very<br/>
&gt; traumatizing. Not once did I ever allow them to take my son out of the room<br/>
&gt; without escort and when I was questioned by the nurse about it, I told my<br/>
&gt; friends story. Turned out to be the same nurse. She asked to be taken off my<br/>
&gt; case and rightly so.  After that they kissed my behind but refused to take<br/>
&gt; the iv out of my arm, I had to make it bleed for them to take it out at<br/>
&gt; which time they informed me that I had to have it cause it contained pitocin<br/>
&gt; (which I had not been informed I was receiving, I thought it was just<br/>
&gt; fluids). I told them tough, get it out now or I will take it out.  I refused<br/>
&gt; the hep B for my son but they insisted in revaccinating me for rubella and<br/>
&gt; how could I argue with the threat of a deaf child if I got it with my next<br/>
&gt; pregnancy (I was still so very ignorant).  I got out of there 18 hrs after I<br/>
&gt; delivered but not until the head nurse came in and made sure everything was<br/>
&gt; good with me. The gave me a little trouble with my husband staying with me<br/>
&gt; the entire time and sleeping with me in the bed but I would have walked if<br/>
&gt; they hadn&#39;t allowed it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My 3rd (and last) child was born at a birthing center, underwater. I still<br/>
&gt; had to be induced (she was late, the others were right on time)but in the<br/>
&gt; least invasive way. I was there 8 hours total, I got to hold my baby right<br/>
&gt; away and no one did anything to her. Am I the only one who didn&#39;t know that<br/>
&gt; it is preferable to not bath the baby thoroughly when they are born. She had<br/>
&gt; the softest sweetest skin (and still does) and I think it is from all that<br/>
&gt; stuff they scrubbed off my other two.  I would recommend this experience for<br/>
&gt; anyone who is afraid to go it alone. My doctor listened to me and respected<br/>
&gt; me and my decisions but it was right near a hospital incase of<br/>
&gt; complications. Now, of course, if I were able to do it again, have another,<br/>
&gt; I would stay home, rent a pool and go for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just keep talking folks, to anyone who will listen and even to those who<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t. It is not just what you say about your birth experiences, your<br/>
&gt; unschooling, your family and it&#39;s closeness, it is what they see. They see<br/>
&gt; healthy, extraordinary children, people, individuals. My children are by far<br/>
&gt; not the most unschooled, confidant, well cared for, together children (I am<br/>
&gt; just starting to see the light as I pull my head out of the sand) but I can<br/>
&gt; still see the difference between them and mainstream children. I watched a<br/>
&gt; weekend dad at the park this morning so ill at ease with his 2 yr old, so<br/>
&gt; untuned and he was trying so hard but was just clueless.  I went out tonight<br/>
&gt; to burger king to let my kids run around for a bit (so I could stay up late<br/>
&gt; tonight, we family bed now and usually all go at once) and there , in<br/>
&gt; playland was a maybe 3 month old baby in a baby carrier/carseat planted on a<br/>
&gt; table top with mom sitting out in the restaurant out of site. There were two<br/>
&gt; preteen boys climbing on the outside of the equipment totally not watching.<br/>
&gt; It broke my heart, sweet baby with bottle propped in his mouth, mom shoving<br/>
&gt; fries at the other end of the establishment. I think I am going to stay home<br/>
&gt; for a few more years!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, I am done rambling and ranting. I am up way too late and can&#39;t keep a<br/>
&gt; coherent thought for more than a few minutes. I hate to do it but I must<br/>
&gt; seriously consider leaving this list. I have no more time. I have so many<br/>
&gt; unanswered posts sitting in my files and I am going to just have  to let<br/>
&gt; them go. I really enjoy it here, but as it was when I first started, it is<br/>
&gt; yet, far too big for my little bit of time. I would (while I am at it with<br/>
&gt; my monster post) like to again extend an invitation to anyone interested to<br/>
&gt; check out my list Gods_way_naturally on onelist. It is for Christian<br/>
&gt; unschoolers who are into attachment parenting, non coercive parenting and<br/>
&gt; simple, natural living and natural health alternatives. (or at least<br/>
&gt; interested in the above, we have folks to whom only a few of those apply). E<br/>
&gt; mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mrstar@...">mrstar@...</a> if you are interested. It has been great<br/>
&gt; hanging here and I may come back in a few years when they are not all so<br/>
&gt; small here.<br/>

want me to hear his heartrate drop so I would not become distressed. I was <br/>
only 18 when he was born and pretty ignorant but after the moniter had <br/>
dropped out for the third time, I refused to let them put it back in! The <br/>
nurses tried to humor me, but I was not in the mood. Ha ha! <br/>
    Also, both of my chldren were induced, even though I told the doctors <br/>
their due dates were wrong. Again, as I said, I was young and nieve. If I <br/>
were to go through it now I would do things much differently. <br/>
