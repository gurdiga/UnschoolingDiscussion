<div id="ygrps-yiv-88939764">Please send some symphathetic thoughts toward us up here in Minnesota,  I just found out we lost a very liberal Democratic senator near my town in an airplane crash, his whole family and 3 campaign supporters and 2 pilots died.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Paul Wellstone did some great things in Washington and my heart is so sad that we&#39;ve lost him.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not much of a political person because I&#39;m too radical for most politicians but Wellstone was a radical for a politician.  We are going to miss him in Washington.<br/>
