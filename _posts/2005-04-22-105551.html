<div id="ygrps-yiv-350663802">I was in the other room and my three kids were in the living room. <br/>
Things had gotten quiet so I went to go check on them. They had gotten <br/>
out the art supplies and were making crafts with construction paper. <br/>
My youngest,3 1/2, was making a barbie bed according to her using the <br/>
construction paper. Now my other two were were making something too <br/>
but I decided I wasn&#39;t going to get mad over it. They had taken <br/>
construction paper, cut out a house, grass, sun, and cloud and used a <br/>
glue stick to glue the cut outs onto the living room window. I asked <br/>
them why they made the picture on the window instead of using paper <br/>
and my oldest,7, said cause the window was boring. I have to give her <br/>
that one since the view from our window is a giant wall from the <br/>
building across the street. I took a picture of the picture they made <br/>
and said &quot;here, let&#39;s put the cut outs on paper before the glue dries <br/>
and this way we can save the picture.&quot; I was also impressed to see <br/>
what my daughter used for glitter on the house. We use rock salt and <br/>
have a salt grinder, so she put glue on the house where she wanted <br/>
glitter and sprinkled salt over it. I wouldn&#39;t have thought to use <br/>
salt for glitter. I just had to say the nice creative moment we had in <br/>
our house yesturday.<br/>

Out of the mouths of babes... It&#39;s interesting to see the logical<br/>
views that our kids have that sometimes we don&#39;t even see. It&#39;s nice<br/>
to have them remind us of thinking that is uncluttered by convention.<br/>
Thanks for sharing your nice story.<br/>
