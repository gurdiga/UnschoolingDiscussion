<div id="ygrps-yiv-305780608">Well Mike, I wasn&#39;t going to get into it, but since you insist....<br/>
Here is some information on that infamous vote, and why I believe the Bible <br/>
is hugely decided by man, not God. Even if many of the writers were God <br/>
inspired, there is a LOT of room for mangling.<br/>
This is a short excerpt from a website for skeptics like myself.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine what the Bible would look like today if voting had gone differently? <br/>
In the year 325 CE, Constantine (a non-baptized Pagan) convened the Council <br/>
of Nicea to settle disputes in the Church. The council changed Jesus from man <br/>
to God in the flesh, they changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, and <br/>
the Passover was changed to Easter. So what does this say about the Bible? It <br/>
says that MEN, not god, composed the Bible. Apologist Richard Sisson, in his <br/>
book, Answering Christianity&#39;s Most Puzzling Questions (Volume 1), states,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In fact, after the death of Jesus a whole flood of books that claimed to be <br/>
inspired appeared... [...] Disputes over which ones were true were so intense <br/>
that the debate continued for centuries. Finally in the fourth century a <br/>
group of church leaders called a council and took a vote. The 66 books that <br/>
comprised our cherished Bible were declared to be Scripture by a vote of 568 <br/>
to 563.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
568 to 563? If 5 people had voted differently the Bible would be nothing like <br/>
it is today. You would be reading books that you had never heard of. Perhaps <br/>
there wouldn&#39;t even be a Bible? What happened to the books that are mentioned <br/>
in the Old Testament? The Book of the Wars of the Lord is mentioned in <br/>
Numbers 21. Joshua 10:13 mentions the Book of Jasher. First Chronicles <br/>
mentions the Book of Nathan and Gad while Second Chronicles mentions the Book <br/>
of Acts of Solomon. Where did they go? Why were they not chosen? Were they <br/>
deemed by vote to not be the word of God? If that is so, then why do books <br/>
they deemed to be the word of God mention the other books?<br/>
<br/>
What happened to the extra books from the New Testament era? Books like the <br/>
Gospels according to Hebrews, Judas Iscariot, Peter, Marcion, Matthias, Eve, <br/>
and Philip. The Acts of Peter, Book of Judgment by Peter, Hymn of Christ, <br/>
Magical Book by Christ, and the Letter to Peter and Paul by Christ. If a <br/>
letter BY Christ didn&#39;t make the cut one has to wonder what criteria these <br/>
men were using to influence votes. These books have become collectively known <br/>
as the Apocrypha. <br/>

<br/>
There was a book supposedly written by Jesus father too, I just don&#39;t see how <br/>
books by Jesus and family weren&#39;t deemed worthy of being put in.<br/>
<br/>
AND, I heard (but have not confirmed) that there is an article floating <br/>

<br/>
If anyone is interested in hearing some of the research that shows the differences between Judaism and Christianity, and learn about Christianity&#39;s origins, and why it has actualy lasted for 2000 years, go to Bet Emet Ministries.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a link, but if you do a google search, you&#39;ll find it.<br/>
<br/>
I mention Judaism and Christianity because Christianity claims to be the fulfillment of Judaism, so its wise to start with Judaism and see why and at what point in history, Christianity became its own religion instead of just another sect of Judaism.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785711277">The Bible doesn&#39;t say that Judas bought himself a field with the <br/>
silver. One account has Judas hanging himself, and another account <br/>
has him falling and bursting asunder. If you think about it, a dead <br/>
body, after a few days, falling from the limb it was hanging on, or <br/>
the limb breaking...it would VERY EASILY burst asunder and its bowels <br/>
gush out. Ugh. <br/>

Have you ever read a biography of, say George Washington? Then read <br/>
another Washington bio by a different author. would they be <br/>

  &gt; Imagine what the Bible would look like today if voting had gone differently? <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; In the year 325 CE, Constantine (a non-baptized Pagan) convened the Council <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; of Nicea to settle disputes in the Church. The council changed Jesus from <br/>
  &gt; man <br/>
  &gt; to God in the flesh, they changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, and <br/>
  &gt; the Passover was changed to Easter. So what does this say about the Bible? <br/>
  &gt; It <br/>
  &gt; says that MEN, not god, composed the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
  I would hope that parents are helping their children to gain a more nuanced <br/>
  understanding of history than this kind of statement represents.<br/>
<br/>
  So, for example, if they read that Emperor Constantine was not baptized until <br/>
  his death bed, is the point brought out that he was a Christian catechumen?  <br/>
  As a &quot;student&quot; Christian he was not a pagan.<br/>
<br/>
  Why did Constantine convene a council of the whole church throughout the <br/>
  Roman Empire?  (The word &quot;catholic,&quot; by the way, means &quot;according to the <br/>
  whole.&quot;)  He banked on using Christianity to renovate the Roman Empire, and <br/>
  therefore thought the bishops had to get their act together since there <br/>
  seemed to be disagreements among and within the local churches in various <br/>
  cities and provinces.  So he convened the first ecumenical (empire-wide) <br/>
  council of all the bishops of the church and asked them to set forth the <br/>
  beliefs and practices of the church.  In the process they produced a creed <br/>
  that was constructed by comparing all the baptismal professions of faith used <br/>
  in the local churches.  They produced a canon of Scripture by comparing the <br/>
  books read in the local Christian assemblies.   In the battle against <br/>
  gnosticism Christian assemblies had already agreed to four canonical gospels <br/>
  and excluded gospels they regarded as gnostic.  They accepted the canon of <br/>
  Old Testament books that the Jewish rabbis had already established, although <br/>
  they changed the order in the Old Testament so that the prophetic books came <br/>
  last.  They believed that all of these books in the Old and now in the <br/>
  canonized New Testaments were inspired.  The bishops affirmed the doctrine of <br/>
  the Trinity (which necessarily includes the co-divinity of Christ with the <br/>
  Father and the Holy Spirit) by appealing to the statements in the gospels and <br/>
  epistles and the devotional practices of their people.  Confessing one God in <br/>
  three co-equal persons excluded the Arians who taught that the Son was <br/>
  subordinate to the Father.  They synchronized the Christian calender <br/>
  throughout the Empire by agreeing that the Pascha (later called &quot;Easter&quot; by <br/>
  the Anglo-Saxons) should be observed on the first Sunday after the first full <br/>
  moon of spring and not on the 14th of Nisan, as the Christians of Asia Minor <br/>
  had been doing.  So Rome won on this one. <br/>
<br/>
  After the Council Constantine decreed that Sunday would be a day of rest <br/>
  throughout the Empire.  That meant that sabbath ideas were transferred to the <br/>
  Lord&#39;s Day.  But catholic Christianity has always understood that the Lord&#39;s <br/>
  Day and the Sabbath are two different days.  In the Latin church calendar <br/>
  Saturday is still called &quot;Sabbato&quot; (&quot;of rest&quot;) and Sunday is called &quot;Dominca&quot; <br/>
  (&quot;of the Lord&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
  I would hope that homeschoolers would learn to understand the dynamics at <br/>
  work in history, and not just facts which, in and of themselves, might not be <br/>
  true. or conclusions which usually, in the study of history, are untrue.  As <br/>
  I&#39;ve tried to indicate by the above discussion---as an illustration of this <br/>
  principle---it simply would not be true that Constantine remained a pagan or <br/>
  that he turned Sunday into the Sabbath.  The reality was more complicated <br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

I was a Christian and I&#39;ve done a great deal of studying about Judaism, which was supposed to be the origin of  Christianity.  What I discovered is *not* what I was taught in church.<br/>
<br/>
According to Judaism, there were Noahides first, and then a subset of Noahides became Jews as Mt. Sinai.  The Jews were to be the &quot;priests to all nations&quot;, but all the other nations were never required to convert to Judaism to go to heaven.  Gentiles had their own covenant, the covenant of Noah.<br/>
<br/>
Many people today who consider themselves &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot; would be comfortable with the Seven Laws of Noah.<br/>
<br/>
I hope its ok to post this here, since we are discussing different faiths anyway.  But here are the Seven Laws of Noah:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Do not murder<br/>
<br/>
2.  Do not worship idols<br/>
<br/>
3.  Do not have illicit sexual relations (this does not refer to premarital sex by the way, it refers to a specific list of illicit acts).<br/>
<br/>
4.  Do not eat the limb of a living animal (this is to discourage animal cruelty).<br/>
<br/>
5.  Do not commit theft<br/>
<br/>
6.  Do not blaspheme, which means not using G-d&#39;s name to curse Him or any of His creation.  (G-d&#39;s name is more than just the term &quot;G-d&quot;._<br/>
<br/>
 7. Establish courts of justice<br/>

  Can you send me some links.<br/>
<br/>
  I would like to read more about this.<br/>
<br/>
  Over the last two years, I&#39;ve learned a lot about the origins of the church, some of which you mentioned here.  But the rest, like Saturday being the Sabbath while Sunday being the Lord&#39;s Day is new to me.<br/>
<br/>
  I have taken the path of a Noahide myself, which is the gentile sect of Judaism and follows the Seven Laws of Noah, the first covenant made between G-d and man.<br/>
<br/>
  THanks,<br/>

    &gt; Imagine what the Bible would look like today if voting had gone differently? <br/>
    &gt; <br/>
    &gt; In the year 325 CE, Constantine (a non-baptized Pagan) convened the Council <br/>
    &gt; <br/>
    &gt; of Nicea to settle disputes in the Church. The council changed Jesus from <br/>
    &gt; man <br/>
    &gt; to God in the flesh, they changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, and <br/>
    &gt; the Passover was changed to Easter. So what does this say about the Bible? <br/>
    &gt; It <br/>
    &gt; says that MEN, not god, composed the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
    I would hope that parents are helping their children to gain a more nuanced <br/>
    understanding of history than this kind of statement represents.<br/>
<br/>
    So, for example, if they read that Emperor Constantine was not baptized until <br/>
    his death bed, is the point brought out that he was a Christian catechumen?  <br/>
    As a &quot;student&quot; Christian he was not a pagan.<br/>
<br/>
    Why did Constantine convene a council of the whole church throughout the <br/>
    Roman Empire?  (The word &quot;catholic,&quot; by the way, means &quot;according to the <br/>
    whole.&quot;)  He banked on using Christianity to renovate the Roman Empire, and <br/>
    therefore thought the bishops had to get their act together since there <br/>
    seemed to be disagreements among and within the local churches in various <br/>
    cities and provinces.  So he convened the first ecumenical (empire-wide) <br/>
    council of all the bishops of the church and asked them to set forth the <br/>
    beliefs and practices of the church.  In the process they produced a creed <br/>
    that was constructed by comparing all the baptismal professions of faith used <br/>
    in the local churches.  They produced a canon of Scripture by comparing the <br/>
    books read in the local Christian assemblies.   In the battle against <br/>
    gnosticism Christian assemblies had already agreed to four canonical gospels <br/>
    and excluded gospels they regarded as gnostic.  They accepted the canon of <br/>
    Old Testament books that the Jewish rabbis had already established, although <br/>
    they changed the order in the Old Testament so that the prophetic books came <br/>
    last.  They believed that all of these books in the Old and now in the <br/>
    canonized New Testaments were inspired.  The bishops affirmed the doctrine of <br/>
    the Trinity (which necessarily includes the co-divinity of Christ with the <br/>
    Father and the Holy Spirit) by appealing to the statements in the gospels and <br/>
    epistles and the devotional practices of their people.  Confessing one God in <br/>
    three co-equal persons excluded the Arians who taught that the Son was <br/>
    subordinate to the Father.  They synchronized the Christian calender <br/>
    throughout the Empire by agreeing that the Pascha (later called &quot;Easter&quot; by <br/>
    the Anglo-Saxons) should be observed on the first Sunday after the first full <br/>
    moon of spring and not on the 14th of Nisan, as the Christians of Asia Minor <br/>
    had been doing.  So Rome won on this one. <br/>
<br/>
    After the Council Constantine decreed that Sunday would be a day of rest <br/>
    throughout the Empire.  That meant that sabbath ideas were transferred to the <br/>
    Lord&#39;s Day.  But catholic Christianity has always understood that the Lord&#39;s <br/>
    Day and the Sabbath are two different days.  In the Latin church calendar <br/>
    Saturday is still called &quot;Sabbato&quot; (&quot;of rest&quot;) and Sunday is called &quot;Dominca&quot; <br/>
    (&quot;of the Lord&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
    I would hope that homeschoolers would learn to understand the dynamics at <br/>
    work in history, and not just facts which, in and of themselves, might not be <br/>
    true. or conclusions which usually, in the study of history, are untrue.  As <br/>
    I&#39;ve tried to indicate by the above discussion---as an illustration of this <br/>
    principle---it simply would not be true that Constantine remained a pagan or <br/>
    that he turned Sunday into the Sabbath.  The reality was more complicated <br/>
    than that.<br/>
