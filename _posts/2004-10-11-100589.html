&lt;&lt; Did you ever see &quot;Rat Race&quot;?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty has, I think, but he wants to go because of &quot;wild West&quot; elements.<br/>
<br/>
I should rent it.  Thanks for the tie-in!  <br/>
(Oh, I just remembered he got me to watch part of it.  Yes, I have an <br/>
image... &lt;g&gt;  Well, we&#39;ll stay on the highway, for sure. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Have you guys seen Hidalgo?  (It came out on DVD in the last month.)<br/>
<br/>
Viggo Mortensen with an &quot;aw, shucks&quot; cowboy accent is just <br/>
irresistable.  (For you, not for Marty.)<br/>
<br/>
And I think it would tie-in well with Secondhand Lions for the <br/>
American-movie-ized melodrama with the Arabian/N.African setting.<br/>

We saw Secondhand Lions last night.  Will didn&#39;t like it, but I  did.  I <br/>
laughed a lot.  I love Robert Duvall.   I thought  Michael Cane&#39;s hick accent was <br/>
horrible.  <br/>
 <br/>
I really related to it because in the movie Haley Joel Osment is at the  same <br/>
stage of development as Will has been this summer.  Still a skinny  little <br/>
runt, but changing, growing a jaw-bone instead of baby cheeks, getting  long in <br/>
the legs.  Puberty.  :)<br/>
