<div id="ygrps-yiv-16215675">Hi, my name is Pat and I&#39;m new to this group. I have been hsing my <br/>
13yo son since October but using a more traditional approach. <br/>
Sometimes I wonder if it is the correct one or should I be &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>
him more. I am a member of some other hsing email groups but lately <br/>
those groups have been spending too much time in-fighting about <br/>
politics,etc so I am searching for new alternatives. Thought I&#39;d give <br/>
this group a try for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to reading your posts and hopefully gaining some <br/>
more info on unschooling. Already wrote down some titles of books<br/>
that I&#39;m going to read so it seems we are off to a good start.<br/>
<br/>
Also just wanted to comment on sleeping with your kids - my son still <br/>
wants me to sleep with him now but only when he is ill. He will get<br/>
up and down up and down and no one will sleep but let me lie down next<br/>
to him and hold his hand and his breathing slows and in 10 minutes he <br/>
is asleep for the rest of the night and I can return to my own bed. <br/>
When he was little he hated his crib and always climbed out and came <br/>
to our bed finally at about 14 months we put a twin bed next to our <br/>
bed and he slept in it and never woke up at night. Not much help for <br/>
romance but......he soon outgrew it and went into his own room at <br/>
around 4 yrs old. So my advice is not to worry about the effects,<br/>
just <br/>
know that you are making them feel safe and secure.<br/>
<br/>
Once again looking forward to the group....</div>

<br>I am in a different loop also - that tends to do the negative things that you 
<br>describe. &nbsp;This loop however has been only wonderfully supportive. &nbsp;I find 
<br>that even when styles conflict everyone is happy to lend an ear and offer 
<br>advice when needed!
