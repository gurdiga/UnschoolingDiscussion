 </span></blockquote>First thing, GET HIM A BUDDY! Rats are VERY social and need to be sold in <br/>
pairs----same sex, perferably, unless you&#39;re planning on breeding. But you <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be doing THAT unless you know a whole lot more about rats! Go to a <br/>
reputable breeder---NOT  a pet store {those are feeder rats (bred to be snake <br/>
food) and are not going to be the healthiest or well-socialized (why bother <br/>
if they&#39;ll become snake food?)}<br/>
<br/>
They eat almost anything (they&#39;re RATS! &lt;G&gt;). I&#39;d recommend asking the <br/>
breeder about any questionable foods. Mine love nuts (but I haven&#39;t tried <br/>
walnuts). Potty training should occur naturally. The cage should be very <br/>
large; no fish tanks or hamster cages (and wheels are a no-no unless they <br/>
wheel is huge---and the tail cannot get caught). Don&#39;t use pine or cedar <br/>
shavings---they can cause respiratory problems.<br/>
<br/>
Training is almost too easy. They love to explore and many are natural <br/>
&quot;hams&quot;. There are many books and websites on rat-training---but you could use <br/>
dog training books for much info. <br/>
<br/>
Google:  fancy rats /  rats breeders /  rat lady /  rat cage building /  rat <br/>
health   for more info than you&#39;ll need!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats! They&#39;re great !<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043743258">I learned something about rats and training.  Its pretty basic though, and <br/>
most of you may already know it, but I found it very interesting.  At a local <br/>
science museum, we saw a &quot;rat basketball&quot; game.. it was too cute.. The rats <br/>
had been trained to dunk a ping pong ball into a tiny basket ball hoop. The <br/>
rats &quot;competed&quot; on each side of the cage, the object being to see which rat <br/>
got the most points ( of course, the rats didnt care.. lol, but the <br/>
spectators loved cheering thier &quot;team&quot; on)  They were rewarded with treats <br/>
when they dunked the ball. ANYWAY, the rat handler said that the rats were <br/>
female, because if they were male, they would fight each other rather than <br/>
focus on the task.  So, I would surmise from this that two male rats might <br/>
tend to be aggressive towards each other in some instances.  <br/>

<br/>
Sure it washes out!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should agonize so much.  Get him a buddy or two, feed them <br/>
various kinds of food (he&#39;ll leave what he doesn&#39;t want, theoretically; mine <br/>
ate all kinds of stuff) and enjoy them!  <br/>
They&#39;re not going to live for fifteen years, so brace yourselves for <br/>
short-lived pets.  That&#39;s one problem with rodents and like that...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059336926">Dear Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
First, let me introduce myself. My name is Lisa, I live in Brooklyn, my son<br/>
is turning 8 this month (always unschooled), and I just joined the list<br/>
today. The rat message is timely, because we just brought one home two days<br/>
ago. I need some advice, if you can spare the time.<br/>
<br/>
We started thinking about getting a rat last year. I was unable to find any<br/>
breeders in NYC, so we put the idea on the shelf until recently. My son<br/>
saved his money, and we started gathering supplies for a rat. We bought a 20<br/>
gallon long tank because we have 3 cats, and we were concerned they would be<br/>
able to get a claw through a cage. (I know it will need more frequent<br/>
cleanings to keep down the ammonia.) We got recycled paper bedding, which I<br/>
really like, (very clean, no odor), a bowl, and water bottle. We found a man<br/>
who could &quot;special order&quot; a rat from a breeder. I had very mixed feelings<br/>
about this. I still didn&#39;t know who the breeder was, or how they shipped the<br/>
animal, etc. And I wasn&#39;t crazy about &quot;ordering&quot; an animal sight unseen. I<br/>
posted to our local homeschool group to see if anyone else had any rats, or<br/>
breeder recommendations. Zip, zero. (It is even difficult to find rat food<br/>
in NYC; how weird is that?) Anyway, I did the unthinkable. (And, yes, I<br/>
know, I&#39;m an idiot.) While buying some supplies in the local shop in<br/>
preparation for our future rat, I let the moronic sales guy show us the nice<br/>
feeder rat they had. I know, I know, just shoot me. Well, obviously, after<br/>
we saw the poor little thing, terrified out of his mind, peeing everywhere,<br/>
how could we leave him? My son looked at me with those big, sappy brown eyes<br/>
and said, &quot;Can we keep him? I&#39;ll name him Frodo.&quot; My mind was saying, &quot;You<br/>
have got to be kidding&quot;, but my heart was breaking. He had a name; how could<br/>
I let him be eaten? Fool that I am, we brought poor Frodo home. My son is<br/>
over-the-moon on love. He is a very sweet rat, very lovey. I&#39;m not sure how<br/>
old he is, but a fairly educated guess is 4 to 6 months. His health is<br/>
obviously questionable. He looks OK, no discharge, no lumps, nice body, but<br/>
occasional sneezes. Doesn&#39;t sound wheezy. So far he is really only eating<br/>
the crappy kibble mixture that was available in the pet store. (We are going<br/>
into the city Friday to look for something of better quality.) He has had a<br/>
tiny bit of apple (yesterday), and today a tiny bit of tangerine. Today he<br/>
had very soft poop, almost diarrhea. I&#39;m assuming from the tangerine. He has<br/>
obviously never had treats, and we are being very cautious. I would like to<br/>
improve his diet, and I am concerned about his sneezing. Another issue is<br/>
getting him a playmate. My plan was to buy two siblings. Great plan, right.<br/>
I had NO intention of buying a feeder. So now what do I do? Do I try to get<br/>
a companion animal from a breeder? Do I go back to the pet store and see if<br/>
he had a &quot;nice&quot; sibling? Do I wait and see how his health is? If I wait too<br/>
long, will it be more difficult to introduce a new pet? More importantly,<br/>
since he&#39;s been inside my shirt and bathrobe for two hours, does rat pee<br/>
wash out? (I don&#39;t feel any wet yet, but he&#39;s certainly peed on me before.)<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to be so &quot;needy&quot;, but I have had such a difficult time finding<br/>
anyone else who has a pet rat. I have been on numerous web sites, but I<br/>
wanted to talk with someone personally. I hope you don&#39;t mind. We adore our<br/>
little guy, and want the best for him.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, and thanks.<br/>
Lisa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493777738">Hi Lisa<br/>
<br/>
I have had pet rats since before my daughter, Lanora (12), was born.  Now she <br/>
wants to begin breeding them and has been doing research for months now.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We bought a 20gallon long tank because we have 3 cats, and we were <br/>
concerned they would be able to get a claw through a cage.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have two cat and both are afraid of the rats.  It&#39;s hysterical to watch, <br/>
one of the cats comes to investigate while on of our girls is out with us.  <br/>
The rats sees the cat and CHARGES it, mouth wide open showing her teeth and <br/>
the cat RUNS away.  Our ratties will even hiss and jump at the cats when they <br/>
dare to come near their cage.<br/>
<br/>
Your cage is good but I recommend getting something bigger when you can, or <br/>
make an extension to the one you fave.  There are a LOT of web pages about <br/>
pet rats and many of the owners have a page dedicated to their cages.  You <br/>
can find a lot of examples of home made cages and some of them start with a <br/>
large aquarium at the bottom.  We managed to snag a great deal on a ferret <br/>
cage for half price but we want to make one of our own too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyway, I did the unthinkable. (And, yes, I<br/>
know, I&#39;m an idiot.) While buying some supplies in the local shop in<br/>
preparation for our future rat, I let the moronic sales guy show us the nice<br/>
feeder rat they had. I know, I know, just shoot me. Well, obviously, after<br/>
we saw the poor little thing, terrified out of his mind, peeing everywhere,<br/>
how could we leave him?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good for you!!! You rescued a rattie!  A LOT of the dedicated rat lovers <br/>
rescue feeders like this.  Temperament is the main concern in these cases and <br/>
it sounds like your guy is real sweet.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;His health is obviously questionable. He looks OK, no discharge, no lumps, <br/>
nice body, but occasional sneezes. Doesn&#39;t sound wheezy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rats and respiratory problems just seem to go hand in hand.  In fact, <br/>
virtually all pet rats are born with one particular rd, I can&#39;t recall the <br/>
name right now but almost all the good web sites have a section on it.  Their <br/>
environment and care make a big difference on how long it takes for the <br/>
symptoms to appear and worsen.<br/>
<br/>
Your rat may just be still dealing with the care he got in the store.  If he <br/>
was on pine bedding his respiratory tract may be irritated and he&#39;ll probably <br/>
get better soon.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So far he is really only eating the crappy kibble mixture that was <br/>
available in the pet store.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I recommend giving them a good lab block and providing the variety with fresh <br/>
food.  Our girls get a portion of what we have everyday (the stuff thats good <br/>
for them that is).  We buy mostly organic produce and when we eat we think of <br/>
them, we give them our apple cores, carrot greens, etc.  The kids also find <br/>
bugs for them outside, they LOVE bugs, especially grasshoppers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Another issue is<br/>
getting him a playmate. My plan was to buy two siblings.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The younger the better.  If they&#39;re both still babies they should do fine.  <br/>
Perhaps you can find another &quot;rescue&quot;?  If you go to the pet store the best <br/>
plan is to look for &quot;volunteers&quot;, little rats that will willingly come up to <br/>
your hand.  They grow fast so I would recommend finding a buddy for him right <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do I go back to the pet store and see if he had a &quot;nice&quot; sibling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is what I would do in your situation.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;More importantly,<br/>
since he&#39;s been inside my shirt and bathrobe for two hours, does rat pee<br/>
wash out?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes!  The more your rattie loves you the more he&#39;ll &quot;mark&quot; you.  He&#39;s <br/>
letting all the other ratties (he doesn&#39;t know there aren&#39;t any others) know <br/>
that you are HIS human.  Sometimes our little girls will leave tiny bits all <br/>
over us, we are wet but honored.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m sorry to be so &quot;needy&quot;, but I have had such a difficult time finding<br/>
anyone else who has a pet rat. I have been on numerous web sites, but I<br/>
wanted to talk with someone personally. I hope you don&#39;t mind. We adore our<br/>
little guy, and want the best for him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can email me anytime!  Lanora too, her email is &#39;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eeveegirl@...">eeveegirl@...</a>&#39;, she <br/>
loves to talk about ratties.<br/>

<br/>
Training is basically encouraging things they do normally.  Some rats are <br/>
more prone to do certain behaviors like potty training.  You can get corner <br/>
litter trays at the pet store but some rats will just sleep in them.<br/>
<br/>
Walnuts, like any high fat food, should only be an occasional treat.<br/>
