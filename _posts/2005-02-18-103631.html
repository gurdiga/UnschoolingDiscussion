<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226542073">I immediately saw this as as strewing.<br/>
Making available stuff/info that builds on  a childs interest<br/>
If they want to look at it-go there-try it (&quot;it&quot; being  &quot;whatever&quot;)  at a more in depth level or an offshoot of  an interest and theirs to take in, or interact with, or explore or not; but  &quot;trying&quot; to demonstrate that you or someone or something could be &quot;a scaffold&quot; to help them move up or over to an interest.<br/>
For me , just knowing that these &quot;scaffolds&quot; exist&quot; is something I store away as a valuable bit of information. Again, connections <br/>
