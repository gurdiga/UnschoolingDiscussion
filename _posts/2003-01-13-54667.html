&gt; Have you ever asked him why he spits it out? There&#39;s cases when people<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fear they&#39;re being poisoned (and that&#39;s a rubric for the homeopath), but he<br/>
may have other reasons. I won&#39;t say anymore. I was personally (privately)<br/>
asked not to talk about homeopathy on these lists.<br/>
<br/>
Really?  By the moderator?  Because I&#39;m quite interested in what you have to<br/>
say about homeopathy.<br/>
