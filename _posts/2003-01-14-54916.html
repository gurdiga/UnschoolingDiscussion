<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should I quit doing the checkbook?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The checking account BORES ME TO TEARS!!!!!!!!! I HATE it! I never<br/>
&gt; want to do it, and never once have I balanced it. Not once. But in<br/>
&gt; our family, I am the bookkeeper, because my husband has short term<br/>
&gt; memory loss and Severe Procrastinitis<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not going to answer your question, because several other folks have<br/>
done that quite nicely.  But a couple things to consider....<br/>
<br/>
First, I read an article somewhere (who knows where, now!) about a guy who<br/>
retired and discovered that his wife had always done the checkbook by<br/>
rounding to the nearest dollar, up or down, as needed.  He was an accountant<br/>
type, and had a fit.  He went through old checks and bank records for<br/>
several years to straighten out the mess.  Total amount checkbook was off:<br/>
34 cents.  That gave me pause for thought.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I have been able to balance my checkbook easily since we came to<br/>
Europe.  That&#39;s because I can&#39;t write checks here.  Not writing checks means<br/>
I pay either by cash or credit cards, or things are automatically deducted<br/>
from my checking account (like car insurance and stuff).  Cash comes from<br/>
the ATM and appears on the bank&#39;s records the next day.  I use one credit<br/>
card only and pay it by internet transfer once a month.  It&#39;s recorded the<br/>
next day, too.  Balancing the bank account involves going on-line and<br/>
marking things in my checkbook.  At the end of the 2 minute session, the<br/>
bank and I always agree.  I&#39;ll never go back to writing checks, this is just<br/>
WAY too easy.  <br/>

COOL!<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I used to shop together a lot and we would estimate in our heads <br/>
what the total would be.  I was ALWAYS closer.  Sometimes within a dollar or <br/>
two. Finally he asked me how I was doing it.  I only rounded to dollars.  <br/>
Things were either almost a dollar or not much more than a dollar or two for <br/>
a dollar, like that.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith keeps his checkbook balance by rounding up.  $11.90 is $12 but so is <br/>
$11.10.   He doesn&#39;t mess with pennies.  And he figures that slush will cover <br/>
any overage boo-boos, like me using a debit card for $80 when I really only <br/>
have $50 on the balance.<br/>
