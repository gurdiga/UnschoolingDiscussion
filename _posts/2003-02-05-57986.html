<div id="ygrps-yiv-689302256">***Don&#39;t they have a craft/art type festival in the summer down at the<br/>
beach?<br/>
Ren***<br/>
<br/>
There are so many craft shows throughout the year, some on the beach<br/>
(Santa Barbara has an ongoing sidewalk craft sale every weekend on the<br/>
beach), some in parks.  So many!  I&#39;ve participated in a few of them,<br/>
the nice part is since there are so many of them I get to be picky about<br/>
which ones I&#39;ll put my stuff in (mostly my stuff is in a local bookstore<br/>
right now).<br/>
<br/>
I think there is also a sandcastle building contest on the beaches here<br/>
(or maybe that was  in the north bay - I can&#39;t remember right now).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you ever make back out here, feel free to call (we have an<br/>
extra futon!).<br/>
