hi,
<p>i guess the difference in my personal understanding of unschooling and
the one you&#39;ve put forth is that in my mind unschooling lies squarely in
ones attitude and is not dogmatic in any real way but flows and utilizes
<u>everything</u>.&nbsp; i see that it&#39;s not a reject (as many surmise
because of the un prefix) of anything but a shifting of perspective from
control and schedules to a more individualized organic growth based on
the inner workings of each individual.&nbsp;&nbsp; personally i &#39;m turned
off by <u>any</u> restrictions at all including not using textbooks.&nbsp;
it makes me wonder what&#39;s the difference between a textbook and a cookbook
?&nbsp; how could a more unschooling person see the use one but not another?
<p>just curious,
<br>susan

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i think this is only human - it&#39;s the rare person who glides right on<br/>
thrrough&lt;g&gt; and that having an unschool attitude is an overall thing not a<br/>
moment to moment or even a day to day thing.  i don&#39;t believe perfection is part<br/>
of it.  i think striving for something other than this flux gives a false<br/>
impression and creates stress.<br/>

&gt; have a pretty surface-y conversation anyway -- like, how&#39;s the hsing going?<br/>
&gt; great.  OK, see you.) on any given day, then I feel free to.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t feel I have to eschew text or cook books or fit anyone else&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i was just curious because you said in your other post that some people would<br/>
not consider textbooks unschooling.  i was just trying to grasp to whole notion<br/>
of what some believe to &#39;qualify&#39; - where the line was drawn for them.  it<br/>
certainly has no really baring on my personal beliefs just helps me understand<br/>
another&#39;s beliefs, something i enjoy doing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some people question a lot of things that I don&#39;t.  Whether &quot;subjects&quot; should<br/>
&gt; be taught at all, whether &quot;classes&quot; should be taken, what approach those<br/>
&gt; classes should take, what books are informative and what are too textbook-y,<br/>
&gt; etc.  My day-to-day answer to these and other questions is to do what works.<br/>
&gt; There is not a big philosophical overlay.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for me it&#39;s helpful to have a philosophy in place and use it as a sort of spring<br/>
board but i try and stay clear of a dogmatic or a purist type stance because it<br/>
become rigid and exclusive which for me is not unschooling.  kind of middle of<br/>
the road thing:)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For instance, some people say they have been damaged by their school<br/>
&gt; experience.  Personally, I don&#39;t feel that way.  But I can see how it can<br/>
&gt; happen.  But that&#39;s not where I am starting from and so I don&#39;t have some of<br/>
&gt; the negative reactions to school-y stuff that some people have.  They are<br/>
&gt; right for them and, I think, we are doing right for us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my childhood is a bit of a blur so i can&#39;t really say that it was bad,  but i<br/>
can say i don&#39;t unschool because i&#39;m against something but i unschool because<br/>
i&#39;m for something.    i was fortunate enough to have never lost my thirst for<br/>
knowledge and love getting it where ever i can - i pick peoples brains because i<br/>
feel i&#39;m ever changing always on the move and if someone else values it it must<br/>
have some value whether it&#39;s clear to me or not:)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Many, many, many shades of grey (or is it gray? :) ) and they are all OK with<br/>
&gt; me.  And I think if you want to call yourself an unschooler and you are any<br/>
&gt; of those shades, good for you, call yourself whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i would assume that everyone one this list calls themselves an unschooler (at<br/>
least to themselves) or why would they subscribe.  but to be honest calling<br/>
myself anything has never been one of my issues.   using the label &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>
is merely for the sake of brevity and a way to find some common ground (or not:)<br/>
with other people.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is probably true but i really enjoy listening to other people&#39;s take on<br/>
things,  so i really appreciate you taking the time to post your thoughts.  i<br/>
learn a lot from this sort of thing and wanted to follow up on some curious<br/>
points you raised.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again<br/>
