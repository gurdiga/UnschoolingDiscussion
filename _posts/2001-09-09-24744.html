<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837877930">&lt;&lt;just don&#39;t want to waste my time on something that is going to end in<br/>
accusations and judgment&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the difficulty comes when people offer blatantly non-unschooling<br/>
advice and call it unschooling and get defensive when it is suggested that<br/>
it isn&#39;t unschooling.  When someone comes in and says they want to explore<br/>
things, they aren&#39;t radical unschoolers but this is how they do things, even<br/>
when they acknowledge Holt would turn over in his grave at their<br/>
suggestions, I don&#39;t think anyone would have any problem.<br/>
<br/>
But if you went to a Catholic email list and started talking about how you<br/>
don&#39;t baptize your babies but wait until they are &quot;of the age of reason&quot; and<br/>
do a full submersion (sp?) baptism, somebody is going to call you on it,<br/>
particularly if you are putting it forth as a Catholic practice.<br/>
