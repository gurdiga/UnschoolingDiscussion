<div id="ygrps-yiv-875095861">Hi Nance,<br/>
<br/>
This is ever-so-slightly off topic but my heart goes out to the<br/>
deprived/neglected/abandoned &quot;street urchin&quot; you mentioned.  We actually<br/>
have one of those on our street too.  I guess just about every<br/>
neighbourhood does.  Is there ever a time you are able to show the poor<br/>
boy some kindness, as it is obvious he&#39;s really lacking in anyone caring<br/>
for him.  When kids like that grow up they often become societal<br/>
problems we will all have to deal with on some level.  Anything to help<br/>
the poor child along a different path if at all possible?  I know, I<br/>
know, easier said than done... <br/>

&gt;  Thanks<br/>
&gt;  Teri &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No.  You&#39;re not horrible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How to tell tactfully tell someone they are not welcome?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This would work if the person on the receiving end was at all in tune with<br/>
&gt; the rest of the world and capable of receiving a tactful, subtle message.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For example.  We have a neighbor girl who I adore.  She is welcome at our<br/>
&gt; home at any time.  But then dinner comes or we are going out and it is time<br/>
&gt; for her to leave.  All I have to say is:  &quot;OK, K, we are going to be having<br/>
&gt; dinner soon.&quot;  She says OK, see you later.  Thanks.  And she has the grace<br/>
&gt; and manners to leave.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She had been raised properly by caring and intelligent and decent parents.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then there is N.  He is a little street urchin who, I predict, will end up in<br/>
&gt; prison some day.  He is on the street allllll the time, his mother is never<br/>
&gt; home, I have never met her!, and he is &quot;watched&quot; by the mother&#39;s boyfriend<br/>
&gt; (who I met once when I returned his 2 dogs who were wandering the streets.  I<br/>
&gt; think it is a pretty good description of this family to say that the dogs<br/>
&gt; have never again been seen just wandering the street but the 6 yo boy is out<br/>
&gt; all the time!)  He is not yet so rowdy as to be a bad influence on my kids<br/>
&gt; but I am not expecting this to be a long-range friendship.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It would be completely useless for me to be subtle with N.  He does not take<br/>
&gt; hints.  What I says to N is:  &quot;Go home.  It is 6:00 (no, not 9:00 -- as he<br/>
&gt; has told us this is the time he is expected home).  And you have to go home<br/>
&gt; now.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your neighbor is older.  But obviously has not been raised to respect or even<br/>
&gt; be aware of others.  I have other neighbors with teen children and they are<br/>
&gt; lovely and considerate.  So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a teen thing.  I think it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; whole way of looking at the world.  Being self-centered or not.  Having been<br/>
&gt; raised correctly or not.  Etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So ... my 2 cents (ha) is to forget about being subtle, forget about being<br/>
&gt; good friends with these neighbors, and get on with your own thought-out life.<br/>
&gt;   Maybe I wouldn&#39;t agree with you about everything if we were neighbors, but<br/>
&gt; my kid would not be making the sort of remarks this girl has made, and I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t expect you to put up with it if they were this rude.  Speak up.<br/>
&gt; Tell her you don&#39;t talk like that in your house.  That you have other<br/>
&gt; interests.  That bragging isn&#39;t what you do.  Maybe it would be the first<br/>
&gt; time in her life anyone suggested there was something else to talk about.<br/>
&gt; Maybe she will storm off.  Big loss?  I don&#39;t think so.  Maybe her mom will<br/>
&gt; get huffy.  Probably not.  Probably won&#39;t give a good darn.  But if she does,<br/>
&gt; are you really this woman&#39;s bosom buddy anyway?  Probably not going to happen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I vented.  Please excuse me.  I just wanted to say you don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt; put up with any sort of smart-alec behavior you don&#39;t approve of and, on the<br/>
&gt; other hand, you are the one who has to speak up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck.  It sounds unpleasant.  But your other choice is to be a doormat<br/>
&gt; for this boorish behavior.<br/>

just finished re-reading Faber &amp; Mazlish&#39;s &#39;Siblings Without Rivalry&#39; and I

similar discussion to this on another list, (different circumstances, but still)

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] neighbor kid rant and question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a question, I came to you all because many of you know how I feel<br/>
&gt; about the things I am going to talk about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a problem with the neighbor girl. My ds and dd are 10 and 9. The<br/>
&gt; neighbor girl is 13 and public schooled. Now I know many very sweet ps<br/>
teens<br/>
&gt; so please don&#39;t think I am being purely prejudice. I feel like an ogre<br/>
when I<br/>
&gt; say that I can&#39;t stand this girl. She is one of the most self centered<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; I have ever met, adult or child. Almost to the point of being sociopathic.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; have tried to keep my children and her fairly separate over the past three<br/>
&gt; years, simply because this girl welds the age thing over my children&#39;s<br/>
heads<br/>
&gt; so effectively. The power is not equal, you know what I mean? She is very<br/>
&gt; manipulative and talks incessantly about what her parents buy her, how<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; her clothes cost, how she has a horse, (which my dd in the middle of a<br/>
horse<br/>
&gt; phase would love to have.) and I feel it is breeding discontent, in my<br/>
&gt; daughter especially. We have chosen to live more deliberately. We have<br/>
told<br/>
&gt; our children many times why we live as we do, so that we can spend more<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; together, do more things together ect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For some reason my kids seem to hang on her every word. Which frustrates<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; to know end as I have tried to raise them outside the box. I am not an<br/>
&gt; isolationist. I want my children to be exposed to a variety of ideas and<br/>
&gt; people. But I am worried about the influence the girl will have on my<br/>
&gt; daughter. They have plenty of friends but this girl is so close that it is<br/>
&gt; hard. I am not especially welcoming to this child but she doesn&#39;t take the<br/>
&gt; hint very well. I feel horrible..... she is just a child.... but really I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t feel like this is good for my DD who seems to be easily influenced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the question. Do I just say enough is enough tell the neighbor lady<br/>
&gt; sweetly that I feel her dughter is just too old to play with my daughter?<br/>
&gt; Which, of course, is going to create horrible neighborhood relations. I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; tried just keeping the kids otherwise occupied when she is around but I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to feel like I can&#39;t even let my kids out to play!!!!! LOL This girls<br/>
&gt; best friend, across the street, will be moving away and summer is<br/>
&gt; coming.......I see conflict ahead. Any advice???? Any at all??? Even if it<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; just to tell me how horrible I am for having such a deep dislike for a<br/>
&gt; child??? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt; Teri<br/>

<br/>
Yep.  He&#39;s at our house all the time.  But at arms length.  He&#39;s not as <br/>
welcome for as long as he would like -- which seems to be forever.  But I not <br/>
going to adopt him :) so he just stops by and he plays and then I send him <br/>
&quot;home&quot; -- I&#39;m pretty sure he never actually goes home from here.  As I said, <br/>
I predict he ends up in prison.  Even in our middle class/working class <br/>
normal neighborhood, everybody knows where to go if you want drugs or other <br/>
trouble.  So, it shouldn&#39;t take him long.  There was another crop of these <br/>
boys a few years back.  The oldest now has a job at the local supermarket.  <br/>
This after having been arrested several times and then finally becoming <br/>
what-looks-to-be partially disabled due to a drug overdose.  This is <br/>
conjecture on my part from knowing he and some other neighbor kids had to be <br/>
rushed to the hospital from eating some sort of flower that is popular around <br/>
here and now he looks like a mini-hunchback and has apparently straightened <br/>
out a little, gotten this job anyway.  His younger brother (9?) still roams <br/>
the street.  These are the children of one of the local police officers.  <br/>
Yep, I know it&#39;s a harsh old world out there and that this is one way kids <br/>
get started in the job of screwing up their lives and it is, in my mind, very <br/>
largely the parents&#39; fault -- but I can&#39;t fix it.  I let the kid in to play <br/>
sometimes but that&#39;s as far as it goes.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re an ogre at all.  I guess we&#39;re all familiar with this <br/>
kind of situation.   We moved here just last Nov.  And the kids have found <br/>
other short people to play with.  Wonderful!  However, we&#39;ve come to find <br/>
out that the family directly behind us, across the alley, have a tendency <br/>
towards lying.<br/>
I am not keen on lying.  First it was my son coming home telling me that C <br/>
was kinda mean and had lied to him about this or that.  So, I advised my son <br/>
to play, have fun, but know that C is just this way.  If he should ever feel <br/>
that C is leading them into something &quot;wrong&quot; or is simply uncomfortable <br/>
around C, that he&#39;s just to come home for a while.  Then my little girl was <br/>
out playing when C&#39;s older sister came over to play with her.  The girl, K, <br/>
is really too old for Mackenzie.  But, I thought, no big deal, they are <br/>
where I could see them.  Well, after a while, Mackenzie and K came into the <br/>
house.  M said that K asked her to go play at her house.  I agreed thinking <br/>
that after a short time, I&#39;d go get her.  My daughter&#39;s NEARLY 5, and K is <br/>
about 11.<br/>
Well, I didn&#39;t have to go get her.  After a while, M came home and said &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
here, Mom, where are we going?&quot;  I told her we weren&#39;t going anywhere and <br/>
asked her why she tho&#39;t we were.  She said that K&#39;s Mom had told her that <br/>
she had to go home now, cuz her Mom (me) was calling her and that we were <br/>
gonna go somewhere.   I was livid!!!<br/>
I told Mackenzie that I had not been calling for her; but that I DID want <br/>
her home.  I told her that K was really too old for her and that I did not <br/>
want her to play with K anymore.  I then became the &quot;stand-in-friend&quot; for <br/>
Mackenzie...as there aren&#39;t any little girls her age in the neighborhood.<br/>
Anyway,  I was so disgusted.  Gee, how difficult is it to use your brain and <br/>
come up with a statement like &quot;M....we have somethings we need to do today, <br/>
you&#39;ll have to go home now...&quot; or whatever???  But, God forbid we should <br/>
over-exert ourselves mentally!!!   I nearly went over and banged on her <br/>
back-door and explained just how low I felt that was.  Not only did she lie <br/>
to a four yr. old, but involved ME in it as well.<br/>
HOWEVER... I did not.  I had developed a bit of a bad attitude toward C <br/>
already.  And now, not holding his mother in high esteem.  I know better <br/>
than to think it&#39;s my job to &quot;save the world&quot;.  But, I believe very much <br/>
that, if we&#39;re willing, we can make a difference in our own little corner of <br/>
the world.  I also know my ability to annihilate others verbally when I&#39;m <br/>
angry.  I have learned to use my powers for good and not for evil. (I hope.) <br/>
  :)<br/>
C had been in our home a few times, full of boastings and tall tales and I <br/>
was very smart-mouthed toward him.  My way of letting him know, I didn&#39;t buy <br/>
his &quot;stuff&quot;.  OBVIOUSLY, he can&#39;t help that he&#39;s being raised by an idiot.  <br/>
:)  ha ha   It&#39;s a ferocious cycle.  I&#39;m sure she has reasons for having <br/>
become a mindless, careless boob.<br/>
Anyway....I do want to be a help to people (in general).  Now, me <br/>
personally, I&#39;m not open to people who&#39;re looking down their schnoz at me in <br/>
disgust.  I will not allow that person to help me in anyway.  None of us are <br/>
open to being rejected.  So,  I&#39;ve chosen to be kind and understanding.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t confronted the Mom, and won&#39;t unless it really is necessary.  As for <br/>
C, well, the last time I saw him, he burst into my house unannouced, yelling <br/>
for my son.  I caught him, and told him that Josh wasn&#39;t home.  And very <br/>
calmly and politely (tho&#39; I could NOT believe the nerve of this kid to enter <br/>
my home without so much as a knock or ringing the doorbell), I said <br/>
&quot;Charlie, please do NOT come into my house again without first knocking or <br/>
ringing the doorbell.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I did ring the doorbell&quot; he said.  &quot;No, Charlie.  If you had, I would&#39;ve <br/>
heard it.  From now on, you stay outside until I come to the door.  You&#39;ll <br/>
have to wait; but I promise if you ring the bell I WILL come.  Okay?!!!&quot;  I <br/>
told him.   He agreed.<br/>
My son still plays with C on occasion; but it&#39;s gotten to the point that <br/>
I&#39;ve told Josh that he&#39;s only allowed to play with him when others are <br/>
around.  Not alone.   And I&#39;ve told him that he isn&#39;t have to say anything <br/>
mean or hurtful back at C.  He&#39;s the way he is and acting like him isn&#39;t <br/>
going to help.<br/>
Do what you feel is best for your children and explain to them why.  Even <br/>
politely telling the older girl the rules of your household and letting her <br/>
know she must abide by them when she&#39;s there.  Maybe making the rule that <br/>
your kids are only allowed around her at your home.<br/>
You are a kind and tho&#39;tful person.  You&#39;ll think of a way of protecting <br/>
your kids without crushing this other child.  And if the girl&#39;s Mom, is <br/>
somehow offended in the process, consider the source.  You have to do what <br/>
is best for your family.<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my 2 cents, for what it&#39;s worth.  :)  :)  :)<br/>
Have a good day!<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] neighbor kid rant and question<br/>
&gt;Date: Sun, 7 May 2000 12:28:07 EDT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a question, I came to you all because many of you know how I feel<br/>
&gt;about the things I am going to talk about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a problem with the neighbor girl. My ds and dd are 10 and 9. The<br/>
&gt;neighbor girl is 13 and public schooled. Now I know many very sweet ps <br/>
&gt;teens<br/>
&gt;so please don&#39;t think I am being purely prejudice. I feel like an ogre when <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;say that I can&#39;t stand this girl. She is one of the most self centered <br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;I have ever met, adult or child. Almost to the point of being sociopathic. <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;have tried to keep my children and her fairly separate over the past three<br/>
&gt;years, simply because this girl welds the age thing over my children&#39;s <br/>
&gt;heads<br/>
&gt;so effectively. The power is not equal, you know what I mean? She is very<br/>
&gt;manipulative and talks incessantly about what her parents buy her, how much<br/>
&gt;her clothes cost, how she has a horse, (which my dd in the middle of a <br/>
&gt;horse<br/>
&gt;phase would love to have.) and I feel it is breeding discontent, in my<br/>
&gt;daughter especially. We have chosen to live more deliberately. We have told<br/>
&gt;our children many times why we live as we do, so that we can spend more <br/>
&gt;time<br/>
&gt;together, do more things together ect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For some reason my kids seem to hang on her every word. Which frustrates me<br/>
&gt;to know end as I have tried to raise them outside the box. I am not an<br/>
&gt;isolationist. I want my children to be exposed to a variety of ideas and<br/>
&gt;people. But I am worried about the influence the girl will have on my<br/>
&gt;daughter. They have plenty of friends but this girl is so close that it is<br/>
&gt;hard. I am not especially welcoming to this child but she doesn&#39;t take the<br/>
&gt;hint very well. I feel horrible..... she is just a child.... but really I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t feel like this is good for my DD who seems to be easily influenced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So the question. Do I just say enough is enough tell the neighbor lady<br/>
&gt;sweetly that I feel her dughter is just too old to play with my daughter?<br/>
&gt;Which, of course, is going to create horrible neighborhood relations. I <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;tried just keeping the kids otherwise occupied when she is around but I <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want to feel like I can&#39;t even let my kids out to play!!!!! LOL This girls<br/>
&gt;best friend, across the street, will be moving away and summer is<br/>
&gt;coming.......I see conflict ahead. Any advice???? Any at all??? Even if it <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;just to tell me how horrible I am for having such a deep dislike for a<br/>
&gt;child??? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt;Teri<br/>

<br/>
i guess my 2 cents would be set up ground rules w/ both your dd&#39;s and the<br/>
neighbor girl.  you take the position of authority and say: &#39;we have a different<br/>
value structure then the one you are talking about, we value time together above<br/>
all else.  i think it&#39;s wonderful that you have many beautiful things and i know<br/>
my dd&#39;s would love to have a horse but we do things a little different.&#39;  then<br/>
explain to her what you value and how your day looks.  that way you remove the<br/>
element of judging and comparing lifestyles and turn the situation to a learning<br/>
experience for the neighbor girl (broaden her horizons so to speak) and at the<br/>
same time &#39;disempower&#39; her because, as you have described this girl (and pop<br/>
culture/ps re-inforces this), she appears to believe that because she was more<br/>
material things she is better (and perhaps more powerful) than those who have<br/>
less.  the reality is it&#39;s apples and oranges and lifestyles and personal values<br/>
are not comparable they just are.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s hard to know why people do what they do but if you set up some boundaries<br/>
and this girl doesn&#39;t respect them (i.e. rubbing it in that she has things your<br/>
dd&#39;s don&#39;t) she isn&#39;t being a friend and then you need to act.   it would be a<br/>
good lesson for your dd&#39;s learn how to discern who is being friendly and who is<br/>
not, as well as learn not to envy what other&#39;s have but to relish what they<br/>
themselves have.  we are on the poor side and my son is very aware that other<br/>
have things that we don&#39;t have (and vice versa), for both reasons of finance and<br/>
lifestyle,  and he&#39;s learned to see the world differently and appreciate what we<br/>
have as a family.<br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>
