<div id="ygrps-yiv-872265164">Have you asked how far she’s willing for you to go to wake her up?<br/>
Pulling covers off?<br/>
Lights and loud music?<br/>
Wet wash cloth?<br/>
<br/>
I’ve sent this to my kids.  They’re all busy with jobs and stuff but maybe they’ll have ideas.  They’ve gone through such phases, and if they can remember it might help.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe others here with older kids could ask, too.<br/>
<br/>
MAYBE she doesn’t really want to wake up, but wishes she really wanted to.  Sometimes people really wish they wanted to exercise, or clean closets, or make a big meal but they don’t really want to.  They really WANT to want to. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477452950">Holly thinks the mom’s planning to be too gentle.  Maybe if she goes in and says “Good morning!  The sun’s up.  Can I make you something for breakfast?  I’m looking forward to spending the day with you. Do you want a shower before you eat?&quot;  To get her thinking.  To show excitement, to show that it would be really nice for her to get up and start the day.  Enthusiasm.  Not to guilt her into getting up, but to show that she could affect the house and family in a positive way if she wants to get up.  To make her feel really welcomed to wake up.<br/>
<br/>
My other idea (Holly said) is that the daughter said she felt like she was “wasting her day” because there’s not a lot of sunlight, but I have three different things to say about that.  <br/>
There are so many ways I do not see that as a waste of time.  If she’s staying up late, then that’s how she’s spending her time.  (Not wasting it.)<br/>
<br/>
Sleep is vital.  There is no person alive who doesn’t sleep.  Sleep isn’t a waste of time.  People are still alive when they’re asleep.<br/>
<br/>
The mom is recognizing that it’s natural, but the daughter isn’t really accepting of that.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the daughter’s perspective on things, Holly thinks that at night it’s daytime somewhere else and in the daytime, it’s nighttime somewhere else.  This might seem like total bullshit (said Holly) but the sun’s still shining when it’s dark.  So it’s not so important to measure time by the apparent sunlight.  The sun is infinitely shining. :-)  (Holly asked me to add that.)<br/>
<br/>
If she’s doing indoor activities, it will matter less whether it’s daylight.  If she wants to do outside activities, it’s understandable, but in the mom’s description of what she likes to do, those are things being done in the evening.  So she IS doing her activities during the day, but it’s daytime in Australia, or India (or the mom could mention any country on the other side of the world that the daughter has an interest in).<br/>
<br/>
Holly thinks enthusiasm will help.<br/>
<br/>
*I* think the smell of bacon and coffee can help.  Unless you’re Mormon, or Jewish, or Muslim, or vegetarian.   But there might be something else that smells good.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the words above are Holly, me transcribing while she was on the phone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-437647145">I read her the last part of this and she said that it rings true. She feels like she &quot;should&quot; get up so she has more daylight and gets &quot;more done&quot;, but she also doesn&#39;t want to get up. She thinks daylight helps her mood. I think she may also be comparing herself to neighbors and cousins.<div><br></div><div>I hadn&#39;t thought about it in this way- the wanting to vs. thinking she wants to.

___________________<br/>
<br/>
I had some ideas about getting up early, but haven&#39;t figured out the formatting posting to always learning from my phone. <br/>
<br/>
Food in the morning can reset the body clock. That&#39;s why it helps adjust time zones when you fast and then eat breakfast at the new time. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d bring her breakfast in bed for a few days, and tell her she can go right back to sleep after she eats it. Then, her body might start expecting food at that time and wake her up on her own. <br/>
<br/>
Doing that helped me adjust my daughter&#39;s schedule, though she was 2 at the time, which is different. <br/>
<br/>
Another idea is shining a bright blue light in the morning (Amazon has them) or wearing orange glasses at night to block blue light. And setting the computer to produce less blue light at night (if relevant, there&#39;s an app called Flux). <br/>

Marty came by yesterday afternoon, and talked to me about your question.<br/>
He says that when she really wants to wake up, she will.  She won’t ignore the alarm if she honestly does want to get up.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I think a hour of pre-ordered mom activity is a bit much.  I wouldn’t work that hard to help a child not feel guilty about staying in bed on a day when there was no scheduled activity.<br/>
There are alarms with snooze functions all over the place.  Phones.  Let her operate her own alarm clock, if she doesn’t need to be somewhere, and she could turn it off herself, or let the snooze wake her up “a few more times if needed.”  <br/>

<div dir='ltr'><div>All of our kids, as they moved into their teen years, went through a stage of staying up really late and sleeping till noon or later. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s hormonally driven - recent research shows that teens&#39; body clocks naturally shift later. For most of our kids their super late-night phases were fairly short-lived or else sporadic, because they didn&#39;t like the feeling of sleeping so much of the daylight away and/or had things to get up for and didn&#39;t like feeling fatigued.</div><div><br></div>However, this past year our youngest (13) has had this ongoing issue of sleeping in past when he &quot;wants&quot; to be up. He really likes routines and he especially loves his evening routine, which has come to include staying up well into the night watching his favorite Netflix shows. He loves cocooning with the dog and his TV in the quiet time when everyone else is asleep and hasn&#39;t wanted to give that up. Yet he would often regret it the next day if he slept too far into the afternoon. I offered many suggestions and we have tried different things that haven&#39;t consistently worked, and sometimes ideas he thought of or agreed to the night before would make him angry upon being implemented the next day. I told him it was asking too much for me to become his snooze alarm every morning - that I would wake him up when he wants me to, but it&#39;s up to him to move himself out of bed if he really wants to be up. Most of the time now I let him sleep (his choice) and he gets himself out of bed in time to not &quot;regret&quot; the time...though just two days ago he accidentally slept till 2:30. So he decided that from now on when the clock hits 2 AM he will finish whatever episode he&#39;s watching on Netflix and go to bed. I am interested to see if this new solution will take hold. &nbsp;<div><br><div>He has only one day a week when he has something scheduled that he needs to be up for, and he does tend to sleep through his alarm, so we always make sure someone wakes him up. On those days he prefers to be woken up with minimal time to get ready (15-20 minutes) so that he doesn&#39;t have time to lie in bed - he knows he has to move right away and he does, with minimal prompting.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>One idea I am going to suggest here is using an energizing blend of essential oils rubbed on the soles of the feet and insides of the wrists. I haven&#39;t done this for our son specifically as a wake up method, but there have been a few occasions where he was feeling very out-of-sorts, lying on the sofa extremely annoyed and apathetic, and when I rubbed one drop each of lemon and lavender oils (mixed in 1/2 tsp almond oil) onto his feet and wrists, in every case (despite his irritation and skepticism that it would make any difference) within 5 minutes he was on his feet with an idea for something to do and energy in his step. He was off and running. If the OP (or anyone) wants to try this, I strongly recommend going with oils from a company like Rocky Mountain Oils, Doterra, or Young Living, as they all use the highest standards for therapeutic grade oils, which is important for purity/effectiveness. RMO is my company of choice because their oils tend to be slightly less expensive and have free shipping in the States, and there is no membership needed for the best prices.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In a nutshell, I agree with Marty that when a child truly wants to be up - when their reason becomes compelling enough to them - they will make it happen.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>~ Leah<br><div><div style="color:#fff;height:0;"></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046687596">-=-One idea I am going to suggest here is using an energizing blend of essential oils rubbed on the soles of the feet and insides of the wrists.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was eight, nine, ten, he used to become agitated sometimes at night.  He would sleepwalk.  He never left the house, but he would get up suddenly and start walking, and muttering unhappily.  I had some juniper massage oil, and sometimes if he was very sleepy but had the unsettled feeling, I would rub that on his feet, slowly, gently, to help him relax, and then put loose socks on, I said so he wouldn’t slip if he got up.  But I would also say “Stay in the bed until this soaks in, okay?”  And the combination of the touch, attention, scent and thought of waiting could really help him go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
So do the opposite of all that to wake kids up, I guess. :-) <br/>
(Kind of a joke… kind of agreeing with Leah Rose.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996388798">Hi,<div><br></div><div>My daughter is also 12 and finds it hard to get up. &nbsp;She has things that she really wants to do in the mornings (she works at a pony yard 3 mornings a week) but finds it incredibly hard waking.</div><div><br></div><div>I have explained how I really hate getting her out of bed as it feels like I am battling her and forcing her against her will - which we haven&#39;t &nbsp;done in our family for some time &nbsp;- and yet she has asked me to get her up. &nbsp;I have explained how this is very difficult for me - I don&#39;t want to let her down but I don&#39;t want to be forcing her against her will.</div><div><br></div><div>Each evening she needs to get up next day we work backwards (when do you need to get to sleep by?), then she writes anew her request to me (on a little white board!) to help her get up the next day and we put it by her bed. &nbsp;This helps me feel better (I am only following her orders!) and helps her remember her resolve. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Practically, She sets her own alarm, so I am not the first thing she experiences (she is already primed even if she has fallen back to sleep again!), I open the curtains, chat, maybe switch on a perky radio station, talk about the day, walk in and out constantly, put her clothes for the day to warm on the radiator (ask which clothes she wants to wear so she has to answer), send the dog in to bounce on her bed and make her tea. (me, not the dog!) &nbsp;I occasionally resort to removing and hiding the duvet, but with a sense of humour. &nbsp;It always helps if there&#39;s some cake or croissant or something decadent to look forward to for breakfast!</div><div><br></div><div>I find this difficult and stressful at times, to be honest. &nbsp;She is sometimes less than polite. &nbsp;But it is getting easier with time. &nbsp;Though I&#39;m not sure if it was just a general desire to be &#39;up earlier&#39; whether it would work... &nbsp;she finds it much easier to be externally motivated, than to will herself to do things against her will (if that makes sense). &nbsp;<span style="word-spacing:normal;">She loves her job, gets great pleasure from it and so there are never any recriminations. It&#39;s still hard though. &nbsp;Being bright and chirpy when you know it is grating on someone.... i know how annoying it is to be on the receiving end of that!</span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;">I suppose what I&#39;m saying is that because we have a written pledge that she really wants me to be like that, it is a reminder to us both that what I&#39;m doing is ultimately loving and supportive even if it feels grating at the time. &nbsp;And that each evening when we are snuggling in bed, in a calm and loving atmosphere, she makes that decision and request anew.</span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;">Belinda</span></div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361643483">Most 12 year olds have to be in school until at least 2 or 3 pm. They don&#39;t get to start their own day until after school, so even if an unschooled 12 year old slept all the way until 2 pm every weekday, they wouldn&#39;t be missing much more than most 12 year olds (who would also probably like to spend more of that time sleeping).<br/>
That might be a way you could help her look at it, in addition to helping her arrange the things she wants to do that require day light hours in ways that allow her to sleep until she&#39;s not sleepy, on those days that there isn&#39;t some specific thing that needs to be done earlier. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171632449">Update on how things are going... Things are great!<div><br></div><div>I think that my posting here and sharing the responses I got with her let her know I really cared and was willing to try something different to make things better between us :)</div><div><br></div><div>At this point, I am asking her each night when she wants me to wake her up, when she wants to be out of bed, and if there is anything that will help (food, shower, etc.)</div><div><br></div><div>The reason I decided (in a previous post) to start with waking her up an hour before she wants out of bed is because I think she likes waking up slowly. I thought it would take the pressure off of me and my thinking that she was ignoring me. It means I am willing to go back in once or twice, not that I am spending an hour of my time waking her.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The first day, I went in an hour before she wanted to be out of bed, took her some snacks and a drink, encouraged her to sit up and speak with me, and hung out til she drank something. She said she wanted a bit more sleep. I left to go do my own thing. She came down half an hour later, said she had gotten up and checked her iPod messages and stuff and decided to stay up.</div><div><br></div><div>The next day was basically a repeat minus the snacks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since then, I have offered to come back if she wants a bit more sleep (before the time she said she wanted to be out of bed), and nudged her toward the shower when she thought it would help her wake up.</div><div><br></div><div>Our attitudes toward each other are much improved!</div><div><br></div><div>Kiersten</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
