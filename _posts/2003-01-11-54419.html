Chores are a way and fact of life for many people. If you personally chose <br/>
not to have you children do their chores or responsibilty..then that is your <br/>
choice.<br/>
It just happens not to be mine or my husbands.<br/>
He would not appreciate working hard on the road for 6 days and see no dishes <br/>
washed, counters nasty greasy and the stove filthy, clothes thrown about the <br/>
house , or the house looking like a tornado with through it. That would not <br/>
be fair to him. He should have to come home and clean the kids mess. It is <br/>
not in our  particular nature or culture to have dirty homes.<br/>
Energy flows better in a home that is not overly filty. cluttered or <br/>
dirty..... I am even starting to look into feng shui.<br/>
<br/>
What will happen to your chldren if they don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
That is private...... but it is dealt with, but we rarely have too. They know <br/>
that they have to pull their weight around here.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I asked you to ponder why you used the phrase &quot;have to&quot;. If your kids<br/>
*had* to do chores that means you have no power over the situation. Nothing<br/>
you could do could change it.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not true, is it? You *choose* to *make* them do chores.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not implying you&#39;re an evil witch for making your children do chores.<br/>
Most people do that. But the words we use affects the way we view things.<br/>
There&#39;s a big mental outlook change between thinking we have to do something<br/>
and realizing we choose to do something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; People run their houses differently....... I will not defend that to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unlike casual conversation where we share parts of our lives as a way of<br/>
giving other people an idea of who we are, this is a discussion list.<br/>
Anything that&#39;s posted is potential fodder for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Besides, I will not live in filth<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are people who don&#39;t live in filth who don&#39;t make their children clean<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; nor will I clean up behind them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are people who don&#39;t make their children do chores who don&#39;t have to<br/>
do everything.<br/>
<br/>
Neither Kathy Ward nor Cheryl Seelhoff who have over 8 kids need to live in<br/>
filth nor clean up on their own behind them.<br/>
<br/>
You are seeing only 3 choices: Living in filth, cleaning up after them,<br/>
making them do chores.<br/>
<br/>
Most people are certain those are the only 3 choices. When they realize<br/>
there are more choices then they realize they don&#39;t have to make the<br/>
compromises that appeared to be part of just how life is.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve never had a child cry or be angry over chores or any of the things<br/>
you&#39;re certain they &quot;have&quot; to do, then there isn&#39;t any reason to find<br/>
another way.<br/>
<br/>
But many people do come to the realization that they have been choosing to<br/>
take daily withdrawls from their own joy and their children&#39;s joy for<br/>
something that will be gone without a trace by the next day. (Or the next<br/>
hours sometimes!)<br/>
<br/>
It hits some people hard when they realize they&#39;ve been making their child<br/>
cry or be angry over a toilet that will be dirty again next week. We extract<br/>
a permanent price for something that isn&#39;t permanent.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they <br/>
&gt; mess it up it is their job to clean it up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In life people get to chose the (paying) jobs that match their interests. If<br/>
they don&#39;t like the job, they know they can quit anytime and get a new one<br/>
that suits them better.<br/>
<br/>
In life there are unpleasant tasks that adults choose to do (taking out<br/>
garbage, cleaning toilets) that they would rather not do. They don&#39;t *have*<br/>
to do them. They *choose* to do them because they don&#39;t like the<br/>
consequences of not doing them.<br/>
<br/>
When it first hit me that I didn&#39;t have to do anything I didn&#39;t want to it<br/>
made it a whole lot easier to do the unpleasant tasks because I realized I<br/>
was *choosing* of my own free will to do them.<br/>

feels she can handle.<br/>
