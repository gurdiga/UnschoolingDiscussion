Me, I never, ever read the bottom of the posts.  But having that &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
forget to change the subject&quot; post pop up out of context does help me.  It&#39;s<br/>
so easy to click reply on digest and not even notice the subject line.  I<br/>
can get lax about it and need reminders.<br/>
<br/>
A request: a couple posts sent recently included the entire digest in the<br/>
reply.  It&#39;s kind of a pain to scan past that on the digests.  I personally<br/>
appreciate when writers eliminate as much as possible from the end of their<br/>
message.  It makes the digests easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your work moderating; it&#39;s appreciated!<br/>
