<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567138561">It&#39;s been wonderfully eye-opening to read such<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a breadth of beliefs, and I hope that everyone still feels welcome on the<br/>
&gt;list. None of us would have had the chance to &quot;meet&quot; folks from such diverse<br/>
&gt;belief systems in our day to day lives, and I value hearing from all of you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I appreciate you sentiments, and I do share you valuing of being able to<br/>
have access to a community as diverse as this internet one, especially in<br/>
my current home in a very mono-culturatic area.  However, I feel I must<br/>
point out that my life was very diverse and I knew people and had friends<br/>
from all walks of life where I grew up, in San Francisco.  While most folks<br/>
do not get the chance to live with such diversity daily, and it was one of<br/>
the up sides of growing up in the city, to say that NONE of us have ever<br/>
gotten that opportunity is not correct.  <br/>
<br/>
I had friends of every possible sexual orientation, family make-up, and<br/>
belief systems.  I had gay friends, srtaight friends with gay parents, and<br/>
every possible variation of that scenario.  I had friends who were homeless<br/>
and lived in youth shelters or in the park or on the beach.  I had friends<br/>
with all sorts of substance abuse problems, friends from borken homes or in<br/>
abusive situations, friends with single or divorced parents, friends who<br/>
lived on their own and took care of themselves guite well at 14 and 15.  I<br/>
had friends who were Buddhist, Toaist, Protestant, Baptist, Catholic,<br/>
Lutheran, Athiest, Wiccan, Pagan, Eclectic, or just plain confused.  <br/>
<br/>
That was one of the things I loved the most about living there.  There was<br/>
so very much rich diversity in cultural and personal beliefs.  It was easy<br/>
to learn to be tolerant and accepting and open minded, and to learn to that<br/>
everyone is a human being with the potential to be good and kind and<br/>
wonderful or full of hate and rage.  I was weaned on these things.  It was<br/>
all normal for me to see all these folks around me, to be the only English<br/>
speaker on the bus, the only white kid on the playground, the only person<br/>
with a two birth parent family, etc.  It was a wonderful element in growing<br/>
up there, and I had the opportunity to open the minds of some folks who<br/>
were less fortunate in their environment by introducing them to some of my<br/>
wonderful friends.<br/>
