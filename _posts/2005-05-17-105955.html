<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030846859">We got the movie last week, and have probably watched it about 10  <br/>
times...it&#39;s SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!  We got the 2 dvd set,  and the <br/>
second DVD was worth the price...lots of really cool stuff on how they  made it, <br/>
how the original musical came about, etc.  We&#39;ve sort of gone into  a phantom <br/>
craze at our house.  We&#39;re reading the original turn of the  century <br/>
book...really interesting, says it&#39;s based on real people.  My 11  year old son dug out <br/>
his dracula cape and runs around outside with our 9yo  foster daughter, playing <br/>
Phantom...We are now &quot;hungry&quot; for musicals and are  heading to the library in <br/>
search of fiddler on the roof, annie, and any others  we can find!<br/>
 <br/>
The original website (for the musical) has a really cool part under  <br/>
&quot;education&quot; with a lot of neat questions, thought provoking stuff, related to  the <br/>
movie...one of my kids started a few of the &quot;projects&quot; on her own...for  example, <br/>
write a sequel, or change the ending, or write about the phantom&#39;s life  <br/>
before the story (as a child...)  THere&#39;s also message boards on the  phantom <br/>
movie site...lots of teenagers there.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyhoo,,,..just wanted to suggest it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134112083">My daughter saw it last night and loves it! Do you have  a link for the<br/>
website that has the &quot;education&quot; part on it. I just did a search but all the<br/>
sites I tried didn&#39;t have it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
