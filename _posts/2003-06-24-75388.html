<div id="ygrps-yiv-833875404"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We&#39;ve become a society who believes the media, no questions asked, &<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the dairy industry is a big money maker...for political figures<br/>
especially.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet that most people on this list do not believe everything they read.<br/>
Questioning public school often opens the door to questioning everything!<br/>
<br/>
When the food pyramid was developed about 10 years ago, it was going to be<br/>
the other way around - with grains on top and sugar/fat on the bottom.  The<br/>
meat and dairy industries lobbied to flip it over, because they did NOT want<br/>
people to think that grains, fruits, and vegetables (as shown at the top of<br/>
the pyramid) are more important than dairy and meat.  Hmm.  The USDA is<br/>
currently revising their recomendations, again.  I have a copy of one of my<br/>
mom&#39;s books from nurses training in the 50&#39;s.  Back then the pyramid was<br/>
like a wheel.  Eggs and ice cream daily, but also citrus and leafy greens<br/>
daily.  USDA keeps searching for a way to give the public simple but<br/>
healthful dietary recomendations.  Meanwhile our groceries are full of<br/>
plenty of not so nutritious foods to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
It is very difficult to &quot;prove&quot; theories on food and nutrition.  It is hard<br/>
to find subjects who will follow very specific diets 100%, and even then the<br/>
experiments just can&#39;t continue long term.  Even then, there are so many<br/>
other factors that impact health - genetics, environment, exercise, mental<br/>
health, proximity to pollution, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Anecdotal evidence of how people feel when they change their diet or other<br/>
habits means something, but it simply cannot prove that one factor will<br/>
result in the same change in all people.<br/>
<br/>
I do have many concerns about the handling and processing of foodstuff.<br/>
Chemicals, colors, high-tech processing, food that is old by the time it<br/>
reaches the consumer, yada, yada.  Yes, people need to inform themselves<br/>
from more than one source.  Unfortunately, many people never have the chance<br/>
to learn to trust their own bodies and easily become victims of the latest<br/>
dietary fads.<br/>

I agree about the dermatologist.   They mostly prescribe topical drying<br/>
agents or, in severe cases, antibiotics.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610006700">My husband suffered with acne during his teen years.  It wasn&#39;t until <br/>
one of our kids had a milk allergy and we learned that one of the <br/>
common symptoms of milk allergies is acne that he realized that&#39;s <br/>
what it was.  His acne always got worse in the winter and better in <br/>
the summer.  He now realizes it was because he drank tons of milk in <br/>
the winter but drank mostly kool-aid type drinks in the summer.  <br/>
<br/>
Try omitting milk and milk products for 2-3 and see what happens!  <br/>
(But you have to omit it completely--read labels, make sure you don&#39;t <br/>
eat cake that was made with milk, make sure there&#39;s no cheese in the <br/>
casseroles you eat, etc.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>One component to acne that we found with my third teenager was infection.  It <br/>
LOOKS just like any acne, and they aren&#39;t those really huge red swollen <br/>
obviously infected spots.  Just your run of the mill acne not even what I would <br/>
consider really bad acne, compared to some of their friends.<br/>
<br/>
It was found quite by accident when during a particularly bad (for him) break <br/>
out he was also put on antibiotics for strep throat.  By the time the <br/>
antibiotics were gone there wasn&#39;t a trace of acne, not for many weeks after.  We <br/>
didn&#39;t really get the connection of the antibiotics until probably almost a year <br/>
later when he had a pretty bad break out (and he gets it on his back and <br/>
face), he seems to think when he sweats a lot, like during baseball season, he gets <br/>
lots of breakouts.  He&#39;s also extra tired during this time and extra busy and <br/>
seems to always get strep at the end of the season.  Once again antibiotics <br/>
(which I am NOT suggesting that you take just for acne but saying it appears <br/>
with my children at least that their is a component of infection involved) <br/>
completely cleared up all acne on his face and back.  My older son tucked that <br/>
thought away and he tells me when he gets a bad break out he takes antibiotics and <br/>
it goes right away.  Instead of just traditional antibiotics prescribed by a <br/>
doctor, I know there are many other remedies that could suit this purpose.  <br/>
Maybe an antibacterial soap instead of the specialized acne soap?  I know there <br/>
are probably lots of other things that you all have tried successfully and I&#39;m <br/>
anxious to hear your replies.<br/>
<br/>
Also one other thing, have any of you with teenagers noticed your child that <br/>
has relatively clear skin but occasional breakouts gets more breakouts if they <br/>
are dating a girl/boy with severe acne?  I don&#39;t think this is possible but <br/>
one son was dating a girl with just horrible acne and her parents would do <br/>
nothing about it, he ALWAYS got really bad acne when he was with her (nothing to <br/>
do with eating the same foods, etc.) I bought her some skin cleansers and acne <br/>
remedies and she cleared up some, he cleared up a lot.  Later when she had <br/>
used all the products and was back with the horrible acne, he got it pretty bad <br/>
again.  When he stopped dating her, he gets a couple minor outbreaks a year.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t make sense to me unless it is some kind of infection based and that <br/>
with their heads umm lips and such always together it was spread.  I watched <br/>
that for about two years and always wondered if anyone else noticed anything <br/>
similar?<br/>
<br/>
What did the dermatologist say?  He said a certain type of acne does react to <br/>
antibiotics and a good dermatologist will use antibiotics before prescribing <br/>
some of the very harsh medications for acne, many times it works.  I asked <br/>
about &quot;spreading it&quot; he said infection travels, germs intermingle, it happens <br/>
with teenagers.  But I&#39;ve never really read anything like that anywhere and he <br/>
was treating us for a different skin condition so I hated to press him more at <br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone notice anything like this?<br/>

Hi, Paula --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d consider encouraging her to do a trial of dairy-free eating.  My<br/>
brother was a dairy-lover with bad acne.  When he was prescribed<br/>
tetracycline, he actually couldn&#39;t take it at all regularly because (as<br/>
I recall) one had to not consume dairy for an hour before taking a pill.<br/>
 He was rarely able to do that.  He had severe cystic acne and his back<br/>
was badly scarred and bumpy. (It still is, and he&#39;s over 40.)  He feels<br/>
the acne has really blighted his life.  As an adult experimenting with<br/>
improving his nutrition he has recently given up drinking milk and feels<br/>
that this is healthier for him.  (I&#39;d ask him for more info, but it&#39;s<br/>
too early to call him this morning.)<br/>
<br/>
As an adult my mom consistenly gets diarrhea from eating dairy products,<br/>
and I sometimes do which somewhat supports the idea that my brother has<br/>
a physical response to dairy.<br/>

local massage therapist if lymph system massage is available ~ it really <br/>
helps move the *gunk* (for lack of a better word) out of your system (via <br/>
digestive tract) so it&#39;s not trickling out thru your skin.  <br/>

Maybe it&#39;s the stress of the dating.  With anything that&#39;s kind of indwelling <br/>
(herpes/cold sores/acne) it will be worse when there are other infections, or <br/>
stress.  It&#39;s not like one &quot;gets&quot; a cold sore (outside the first time--my <br/>
poor husband caught this oral herpes, which it was NOT called in those days--from <br/>
me), but the body can keep it under control until the immune system is busy <br/>
elsewhere (as I understand it, and as it seems from experience).<br/>
<br/>
I think acne&#39;s the same way.  The healthier a person is in general, AND THE <br/>
HAPPIER!, the less likely the outbreaks will be their worst.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, those are excellent points, because at his worst break outs he was <br/>
sick.  But he was what he called at the time deliriously happy and in puppy love <br/>
when he was with Chelsea.  I don&#39;t think John has ever had a stressful moment <br/>
in his life, sometimes I wish he&#39;d be a little stressed over something that <br/>
is important.  Most times I&#39;m just in awe that he can be so utterly unfazed <br/>

at least have an idea of how things will/might turn out.<br/>
