&lt;&lt; Have we bred rebellion into teen life in an effort to <br/>
 scuplt who they are and what they value? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think it&#39;s societal. Part of what is viewed as rebellion is simply the <br/>
natural pulling away process that teens need to go through. But the actual <br/>
rebellious behavior is partly societal messages and hugely the way parents <br/>
control.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
