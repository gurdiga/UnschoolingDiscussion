<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095612251">**I basically let her do whatever she wants, and at first<br/>
I was &quot;worried&quot; because she would only seem motivated for &quot;real<br/>
learning&quot; in<br/>
spurts, then I read how children learn in waves, sometimes taking longer<br/>
<br/>
periods to process and reflect, and they are still learning whether it<br/>
shows<br/>
from the outside.**<br/>
<br/>
This is a good reminder for me.  My 8yob seems to have learning cycles<br/>
that are 2-3 weeks of active expansion, trying new stuff, demonstrating<br/>
new maturity, followed by 2-3 very quiet weeks.  I **know** this by now,<br/>
but **still** find myself biting my fingernails when one quiet,<br/>
TV-intensive week leads on to the next.  Gotta keep reminding myself<br/>
that it&#39;s part of the cycle, that it doesn&#39;t last forever.<br/>
