<div id="ygrps-yiv-692426730">-=-=-I would agree with you. But I think I would also add though that some people may not have the financial resources or the research skills as parents to help facillitate an exposure to learning outside of the home.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
I think *everything* is available---and almost all of it can be acquired at no-to-low cost or at trade or by borrowing or by simply asking. If a parent is unable to think of ways to go about meeting her child&#39;s needs and wants, maybe she should put that child in school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-I believe that this is where we as the people who have the resources, support, and guidance, that it is our job to step up to the plate and help them, as we on this list and on many others have and are doing just that!:)-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, that&#39;s not my job. Not at all. My job is to spend my time and effort to help MY children get those things they need and want. Other parents are responsible to get off their butts and do their own work for their own kids!   <br/>
<br/>
We can talk about different ways we go about to achieve these things, but *everyone* has resources and google and libraries. There are local e-groups (and if there isn&#39;t, everyone reading here is capable of starting one!) that can help local unschoolers get together and make connections.<br/>
<br/>
I am more than willing to help someone who is just starting out---who is figuring out how to leave school-think behind and start looking at the world through unschooling glasses. But hand-holding can only go so far. Parents really do need to take responsibility in order to unschool. Those with limited abilities, who have no interest in the great big world, who---how did you put it? who &quot;may not have the financial resources or the research skills as parents to help facillitate an exposure to learning outside of the home&quot; ....well, they will probably not make very good unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
Part of this job is to make that effort---and in SPADES! <br/>
<br/>
BE. DO. FIND. ASK.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooling parent really does need to be a doer, in my opinion, to be an inspiration to her children. They need to SEE her following passions (hers and her kids&#39;) and not floundering and waiting and---oh---and being lazy! I had a mom tell me the other day that she thought she should unschool because she was just too lazy to do the seatwork with her son. :-P~~~*  I told her she might want to rethink unschooling. It&#39;s NOT for the lazy or the unimaginative or the uninspired. It&#39;s just NOT.<br/>

We&#39;ve done vintage dance lessons for two kids at once by distributing flyers every week of <br/>
the classes (in the snow, no less). We expressed our interest and our financial limitations <br/>
and they offered a solution that benefitted us all.<br/>
<br/>
We work as ushers at the local Shakespeare company&#39;s performances and attend the entire <br/>
series all year for free.<br/>
<br/>
My middle child wanted to go to space camp ($800+) and worked selling cookies in the <br/>
neighborhood for two years to *earn his way*. He has continued to earn money (he&#39;s 13) <br/>
and has purchased for himself an iPod, a Nintendo DS, collectible LOTR books and swors, <br/>
and has an eviable CD collection. He also pays for part of his weekly sax lessons and is <br/>
saving to go to Costa Rica with AFS. He knows he can go because he knows he can earn <br/>
money.<br/>
<br/>
Grandparents kicked in for some of our extra curriculars instead of birthday gifts (like the <br/>
first year of Shakespeare camp).<br/>
<br/>
My oldest bought his own car.<br/>
<br/>
We found ballet lessons for a few dollars a week through our church for years.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve traded tutoring in math for tutoring in writing with another family.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had literature groups in our home.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve worked as counselors in our local homeschool camp to offset the expense of our <br/>
kids attending.<br/>
<br/>
These experiences have taught our kids more about the relationship of work to having <br/>
what they want than any other method. I&#39;m extremely proud of my kids for their initiative <br/>
and their willingness to go the extra mile to make their dreams come true. <br/>
<br/>
(And this is from a mom who was given everything she ever wanted including a brand new <br/>
car at 16.)<br/>
<br/>
To me, it&#39;s part of the unschooling journey to be able to help our kids imagine that their <br/>
dreams can be realized through creativity and personal effort.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989334514">I&#39;m with Kelly & Julie.  I think anyone can unschool -- it&#39;s not a matter of how much a parent knows today, or how much research they&#39;ve done in the past, or past education or anything else.  I&#39;ve found that the essential qualities for unschooling is a willingness to question everything, to seek answers until you&#39;re satisfied, and then follow your heart, and your children&#39;s hearts.  <br/>
 <br/>
I also agree that if parents just put forth what it would otherwise cost to go to even public school, that&#39;s a huge bucket of money.  I remember an article in our local newspaper last August about the high cost of getting the kids back to school.  The estimate was that parents spend $170 just on the backpack and supplies to fill it.  For uniforms, or new seasonable clothes, add another $350.  Then you have to replenish school supplies throughout the year. School lunch costs $10 a week (that was in &#39;01 when we last had one in school).  <br/>
 <br/>
We spend about $200 on zoo and museum memberships every year, and that&#39;s for the whole family.  I probably spend $60 a month on fuel for my car that could be saved if the boys walked to school, but then again if they were in school, I&#39;d use that fuel driving to a job because there&#39;d be no point in staying home. We buy new clothes on clearance after the school year starts, much less expensively. My kids wear flip-flops by choice virtually year-round -- can&#39;t do that in school.  For school you need sneakers every few months, at $15 a pair (if they&#39;ll still wear cheap shoes in school). Flip flops cost $3 a pair.  I can certainly feed them lunch every day for less than $10 a week each.  Field trips are included in the museum memberships, so no extra expense there.   <br/>
 <br/>
Even tho unschooling can be less expensive than public school, it&#39;s unrealistic to think being  a parent won&#39;t cost money. <br/>

It&#39;s not important what the parent knows or how much research they HAVE  <br/>
done, but do they have the ability to do it now, and learn now?  There are  other <br/>
things too; other elements need to be in place to be made to make it work  <br/>

 <br/>
I do think anyone can, but only if they are willing, committed really, to doing it.  Once a parent is determined to figure out how to make it work, they&#39;ll find the things they need to make it happen.  Without a conviction that it can be done, and that we&#39;ll keep trying until we get it right, it may take too long for the kids to benefit.  <br/>
 <br/>
I suppose there are people whose situation -- disagreeable ex or something like that -- simply can&#39;t truly unschool, but most people give up on unschooling just because they weren&#39;t willing to try hard enough.  Kinda like those who give up on nursing because it gets hard at the first growth spurt, or who hate to hit their kid but never bother to look for a better answer.  I agree that there are many qualities required to make unschooling work, and lots of folks don&#39;t bother to find in themselves what it takes.  That&#39;s not to say they couldn&#39;t do it -- they just don&#39;t make it happen.<br/>
 <br/>
Then again, I&#39;m not in a really generous head space today -- underslept, kid in a (heavy)leg cast, grief from my family, etc. I tend to feel if one can&#39;t make it work, one just didn&#39;t want it enough.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982991831">I totally agree with the &quot;if you want it you can get it&quot; attitude.  When my husband and I discussed goals we had for our children, number one on that list was to be free thinkers.  Neither of us came from wealthy backgrounds, although mine was not deprived either, but we have now achieved a healthy lifestyle for our 8 children though creativity and hard work.  <br/>
We&#39;ve never let anyone tell us we CAN&#39;T do anything!  Experiences and money are out there.  You just have to think outside the box.<br/>
This attitude has lead us to unschooling because we don&#39;t want our kids to be sheep.  I saw a day care class os 2yo&#39;s in the food store with their hands wrapped around a loop in a rope.  I couldn&#39;t help but think to myself that my kids could never be lead that easily.  They want to explore and touch and ask questions and it&#39;s my job to answer them!  We encourage their creativity and with that hope they&#39;ll never waste our most valuable resource-TIME.<br/>

  In a nut-shell or elaborately what are those elements?  <br/>
<br/>
  * trusting your child to learn what she needs when she needs it<br/>
<br/>
  * ability and desire to show your children the world through living a rich and interesting life<br/>
<br/>
  * a deep respect for your child as an individual, regarding her as a whole human being right now<br/>
<br/>
  * ability and desire to learn every day, to try new things, and go new places, meet new people<br/>

Reading under the desk while you&#39;re supposed to be doing math isn&#39;t  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
It is learning.<br/>
 <br/>
Staying in and doing art instead of going to the cafeteria at school isn&#39;t  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
It might be learning, but it&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
I learned a lot despite school.<br/>
My kids learn a lot without school.<br/>
 <br/>
Those aren&#39;t the same thing at any level.<br/>
 <br/>

Then your definition of unschooling won&#39;t be very useful for  discussions of <br/>

mind  you, I know they&#39;re not really free, and will maybe get in <br/>

learning&quot; in whatever he&#39;s  doing, even after school hours or in his <br/>

It&#39;s learning.  Probably most of the people on this list were schooled  AND <br/>
learned on the side, during, around, on top of school.  Still  schooled.  <br/>
 <br/>
Things change when the school is entirely out of the picture.<br/>
When people are encouraged to leave parts of school IN the picture,  <br/>
unschooling is diluted and doesn&#39;t work as well as it could.<br/>

<br/>
If you just mean to say that people who go to school also learn outside <br/>
of school, then I think that is self-evident.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling is a radically different kind of life - it doesn&#39;t <br/>
refer to the learning that occurs outside of or in spite of school - it <br/>
means learning without schooling at all. It means rejecting <br/>
conventional education altogether - not doing it in a brick-and-mortar <br/>
school and not doing it at home, either.<br/>
<br/>
This list exists to help people understand unschooling in as much depth <br/>
as they can and the assertion that &quot;everybody unschools&quot; is confusing <br/>
and not helpful.<br/>
<br/>
We could use it as a springboard, though, to talk about how unschooling <br/>
is, in fact, different than any schooled student learning what he/she <br/>
can in spite of and outside of school.<br/>
<br/>
What makes unschooling different is that the kids are not being told by <br/>
ANYBODY what to learn, when to learn, how to learn. They&#39;re also not <br/>
being tested or assessed by anybody. Unschooled kids are not learning <br/>
the &quot;real&quot; lessons of school. They&#39;re not learning that they need <br/>
somebody else to tell them what to learn and how to learn. They&#39;re not <br/>
learning that their interests are less valuable than what the teacher <br/>
says is important. They&#39;re not learning to work on somebody else&#39;s <br/>
timetable. They&#39;re not learning to memorize instead of understand so <br/>
that they can repeat back on the test exactly what the teacher has told <br/>
them. They&#39;re not learning that &quot;math is torture,&quot; &quot;history is boring,&quot; <br/>
&quot;writing is painful,&quot; and on and on. AND the most important thing they <br/>
are not learning is &quot;learning is hard not very pleasurable&quot; and that it <br/>
has to be coerced.<br/>

Unschooling isn&#39;t just learning without being taught.<br/>
Unschooling is learning without being taught *full time*.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who learn things outside of school are being taught math and <br/>
reading and history. It&#39;s pretty easy to believe that the learning of <br/>
older kids that happens outside of school wouldn&#39;t be possible without <br/>
much of what&#39;s being taught in school. It&#39;s hard to understand how kids <br/>
can learn to read and do math without being taught. It&#39;s hard to <br/>
understand how kids can learn what they&#39;d get in high school without <br/>
being taught. (Which they can&#39;t. They&#39;re on a different track.)<br/>
<br/>
Learning without any schooling is the essence of unschooling.<br/>

 <br/>
You&#39;re defining unschooling so vaguely as to render it meaningless.  <br/>
 <br/>
Babies and dogs and organutans are unschooling, by your definition.<br/>
 <br/>
All growth is learning.  But unschooling doesn&#39;t exist without the  presence <br/>
of school.  A person who might otherwise be in school but  isn&#39;t--and then <br/>
spends the rest of their time doing things that aren&#39;t like  school, but learning <br/>
anyway, is unschooling.  A baby is not  unschooling because there are no <br/>
schools for babies.  <br/>
 <br/>
I see the danger in defining unschooling too narrowly, as well.  But  <br/>
EVERYONE is unschooling is far, far to broad, and I don&#39;t find a single thing  that <br/>
rings true in the statement.<br/>

Unschooled children are free FROM schooling. Kids  who are schooled are <br/>
not free from  schooling.<br/>

<br/>
When I spent my own little-kid money to order a Rocky and Bullwinkle  <br/>
electronic quiz game (punch card on a circuit board and if you stuck the pin in  the <br/>
right hole the light bulb lit up), I was aware that I was learning outside  of <br/>
school.  I knew that some of the things I was learning would come up in  <br/>
school and some would not, so even as I was learning for fun, I was checking off  <br/>
in my head what was and wasn&#39;t &quot;school stuff.&quot;  One of the cards was about  <br/>
currency in different countries:  yen, lira, peso.   That was  fun, and useful <br/>
to know my entire life.  But I was deeply and thoroughly in  school.  I was <br/>
learning lots under the desk and before and after, and I had  40 minutes every <br/>
afternoon before my bus came (2nd trip) so I could go to the  public library or <br/>
the school library, and did, and read them up.  I wasn&#39;t  an unschooler.<br/>
 <br/>
It did add to my confidence that learning for fun is not only possible, but  <br/>
inevitable if the fun is pervasive.  If it can happen with school hogging  up <br/>
a big chunk of the time, focus and energy, how much better it can work MINUS  <br/>
the school, without the school, UNschooled.  <br/>
 <br/>
When school is gone, life is left.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t what&#39;s between the lockers at school, or happening in the  <br/>
five minute passing periods.  <br/>

****<br/>
It&#39;s your premise that&#39;s false.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sandra&#39;s comparison that everyone learns is more accurate.<br/>
 <br/>
Not all learning outside of a school building or agenda is unschooling.<br/>
Unschooling is learning entirely free of schools or agendas.<br/>
 <br/>
If someone is learning while in an unstructured moment outside of school, but will be returning to school as part of their everyday life, then they&#39;re not unschooling.<br/>
