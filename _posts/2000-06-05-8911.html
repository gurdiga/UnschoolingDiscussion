<div id="ygrps-yiv-288158202">Hi Becky,<br/>
I am an unschooling mother of 3 girls, 7, 4, and 2. We spend our days just<br/>
going through life lke a lot of people. Cooking, cleaning, running errands,<br/>
ect., but we do it with the twist of turning as much as we can into a<br/>
learning experience. I agree with Sue that it&#39;s hard for us to spend time<br/>
talking about what we&#39;re not doing. Even an a homeshooling (not unschooling)<br/>
list I don&#39;t think you&#39;d find people only talking about &quot;school&quot;. I&#39;m on 4<br/>
lists, 3 of them unschooling and the topics are about things like extended<br/>
nursing, vegetarianism, the family bed, food allergies, organic gardening,<br/>
music lessons, and so on and so on.....Homeschooling is a way of life and it<br/>
encompasses a lot of our days. I hope this is helpful.<br/>
Amy<br/>

input!]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello! This is my first day of being on this unschooling e-mail list.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; not familiar with e-mail lists and I know I&#39;m behind on<br/>
&gt; discussions, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have received 14 e-mails today and none of them were related to<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling. Is that a typical day? I can talk about other stuff<br/>
&gt; with all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the people I see in person, but I can&#39;t talk about unschooling with<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear what your children are doing and learning so I<br/>
&gt; might not<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel all alone in this lifestyle and so that I might get some new<br/>
&gt; ideas and<br/>
&gt; &gt; perspectives--especially from those of you with young children.<br/>
&gt; Mine are 5,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4, and 3. Thank you! --Becky<br/>

&gt; Hi Becky,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The problem with unschooling is that it is basically not doing<br/>
&gt; something; i.e. not schooling, so it is very difficult to spend a lot of<br/>
&gt; time talking about what we are not doing.   However to me<br/>
&gt; unschooling is more of a lifestyle than a method of education, so<br/>
&gt; this makes any topic at all relevant to an unschooling mailing list,<br/>
&gt; and pertenant to unschooling itself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example my children follow no curriculum & have no<br/>
&gt; worksheets, they do nothing purely for the purpose of learning, but<br/>
&gt; after saying that I must add that nearly all of what they do<br/>
&gt; encourages and fosters learning.   Home is a 175 acre farm, with a<br/>
&gt; 600&#39; hill, a valley with two trout stream, ponds, animals etc.  They<br/>
&gt; have a microscope, many books, pencils, paper, computers with<br/>
&gt; all kinds of programes and they have responsibilities.   Right now<br/>
&gt; my 11 year old daughter has gone to Chicago with a family who<br/>
&gt; visited the farm two weekends ago, their daughter ended up staying<br/>
&gt; here last week and when her Mother came back to get her Rhianon<br/>
&gt; went with them.  This is amazing to me considering that I only met<br/>
&gt; these people 11 days ago, but we meet some really great people<br/>
&gt; and strong friendships are sometimes formed.    Anyway where I<br/>
&gt; was heading was to say that with Rhianon away, Madeleine [6] has<br/>
&gt; to take the responsibility of milking the goat, Stephanie [4] is<br/>
&gt; helping her and they collect the eggs from the chicken coop<br/>
&gt; without being remended.  Milking the goat was Rhianon&#39;s descision<br/>
&gt; as she wanted to bottle feed some kids, so I told ehr that to bottle<br/>
&gt; feed kids she would have to milk a goat so they could be reared on<br/>
&gt; fresh goat milk, she took this responsibility on the first day of<br/>
&gt; February and until she went away yesterday has only missed one<br/>
&gt; milking when she was sick one day.  Nathan [15] bottle rears three<br/>
&gt; dairy calves at a time and takes care of most of the feeding of the<br/>
&gt; animals, he can drive a truck, tractor, van and is just getting the<br/>
&gt; hang of a 4 wheel drive pick-up that we bought from auction a few<br/>
&gt; weeks ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some days are too long for all of us and the children all help out<br/>
&gt; with whatever tasks they are capable of, mostly for the girls that<br/>
&gt; involves care of the chickens and chicks, assisting with candling<br/>
&gt; eggs and checking the incubators [I&#39;m guessing that we have at<br/>
&gt; least 1000 chicks that we have hatched this year].  We have 4<br/>
&gt; cows, 5 heifers, 3 bulls, 12 steers, a boar, 2 sows, a ram, 24<br/>
&gt; ewes, 26 lambs, a buck, 8 does, 8 kids, 6 turkeys, 6 domestic<br/>
&gt; geese, 5 Canada geese and their 9 goslings, 4 ducks and 23<br/>
&gt; ducklings that we have incubated with 10 more due to hatch today<br/>
&gt; [along with about 230 chicks] and of course about 200 chickens &<br/>
&gt; at least 1000 chicks with around 200 more every six days.  So for<br/>
&gt; my children between the wild creatures living here and the farm<br/>
&gt; animals biology lessons take care of themselves(-;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When the daily tasks are done the kids have the freedom to do<br/>
&gt; what they want with their time, Nathan spends a fair bit of time at<br/>
&gt; the computer on web design or designing cars for GTA, the girls<br/>
&gt; watch about 1 hour of television but prefer to spend time writing,<br/>
&gt; drawing playing legos, playing in the sandbox or out exploring.  I<br/>
&gt; am not actively teaching Maddi [6] and Steph [4] how to read, the<br/>
&gt; only reading lessons they get is having people read to them and<br/>
&gt; giving answers when asked what a word says or how to spell<br/>
&gt; something.  I am not activelty teaching math, day to day life and<br/>
&gt; expenses does that, for more advanced math if the need for it<br/>
&gt; arises such as for Nathan with work on the computer answers are<br/>
&gt; found by asking or researching.   My children who were in school<br/>
&gt; [Rhianon for 1 1/2 years and Nathan 6 years] have regained their<br/>
&gt; love of learning that school all but destroyed with it&#39;s mind<br/>
&gt; numbingly boring games, Madeleine and Stephanie will never have<br/>
&gt; to endure the hours of sitting at a desk being force fed<br/>
&gt; unnecessary information [which is mostly forgotten anyway] just to<br/>
&gt; pass some stupid test, they are free to learn at their own pace, if<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t read fluently &#39;til they are 12 it won&#39;t matter in fact it may<br/>
&gt; be good for them as once we become literate the world changes,<br/>
&gt; yes it can be for the better as we are then able to find all the<br/>
&gt; information we need in books or on the &#39;net, but by having the<br/>
&gt; ability to find what we need from books it partly kills off the<br/>
&gt; scientist [who has to find his/her own answers] that is inate in all<br/>
&gt; new-born babies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe if a few others on the list describe their lives it may help out<br/>
&gt; any newbies who are looking for answers, we were all there once.<br/>
