<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732328278">My has never really used those sheets where the lines are available for<br/>
them to print correctly and neatly.  He has instead draw his own<br/>
letters.  When he asks how to write a word I get out the scrabble<br/>
letters or magnetic letters and put the word in front of him.  He copies<br/>
the word unto his own paper then.  A friend of mine who is more of a<br/>
traditional homeschooler (though John Holt and Waldorf is what turned<br/>
her onto homeschooling) has her son use the sheets.  When her son uses<br/>
the sheets his letters are even.  When her son doesn&#39;t use the sheets<br/>
the letters are not even.   My son who is a year younger writes much<br/>
more evenly without having ever used the sheets.  It turns out that in<br/>
Waldorff schools they never use the sheets because children need to find<br/>
their own space for the letters. Sometimes my son writes each letter of<br/>
his name progressively bigger because it is getting louder.<br/>

We tried that too and it didn&#39;t seem to reap any improvement in her <br/>
penmanship, sure got us both a lot of frustration though!  LOL  That was a <br/>
long time ago and since then it has just improved naturally.  Heck, they can <br/>
see what the letters are supposed to look like, they&#39;ll imitate it is it&#39;s <br/>
important to them.  I think the most improvement came after my dd got <br/>
interested in keeping a diary.<br/>

<br>Heck, I&#39;ll be happy if my son learns to print decently! &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Really though, the local schools here are talking about discontinuing cursive 
<br>instruction all together. &nbsp;More computers, no cursive. &nbsp;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035602564">I&#39;m actually considering not teaching printing--just cursive. It&#39;s easier to <br/>
learn. Moving the pen/pencil along the paper is easier than picking it up and <br/>
replacing it all the time. You don&#39;t even have to be able to draw a straight <br/>
line!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, for us it&#39;s not an issue yet; we just use the computer.<br/>

**I think it&#39;s more important that they can _read_ others&#39; handwriting,<br/>
whatever form that may take. And also, that however they write can be easily<br/>
read by others. We have a cursive practice pad...the kind where you use a<br/>
blue pencil and peel off after tracing. They use it whenever they dig it up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764525236">Holly, who still isn&#39;t reading fluently, likes writing, and she practices <br/>
cursive sometimes (a few words) and even blackletter calligraphy (with felt <br/>
tip calligraphy pens.  She will copy words in other scripts and has for years <br/>
been able to make big poster-style letters--the outlines of the kinds of <br/>
things that sign-painters paint on windows.   So her her, writing is plaing <br/>
with the shapes of the letters.  Once she can write and spell, she&#39;ll already <br/>
be there with cursive and calligraphy.<br/>
<br/>
My boys, on the other hand, seem literate (if crummy spellers) on IM and <br/>
e-mail but once they&#39;re stuck with a pencil and paper, all slows down to <br/>
sludge.<br/>

<div><font face="Century Gothic">Yes.&nbsp; Because it is usually a faster and 
more fluid form of handwriting.&nbsp; I encourage him to keep a journal and want 
his energy to be able  to go into putting his thoughts on the paper rather than 
how to form the letters.&nbsp; If he chooses to use printing/manuscript for his 
writing, I have no problem with that, but I would like him to have the skills so 
he has the choice.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">Also I feel it is important that he be able to 
read other people&#39;s writing and most adults write in cursive rather than 
print...at least that&#39;s been our family&#39;s experience. </font></div>

<div><font face="Century Gothic">FWIW, DS is 12 and we have just begun teaching 
cursive.&nbsp; It is coming along quickly (big surprise...Not!).</font></div>
