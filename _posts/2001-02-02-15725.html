<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; THIS is personal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I only say your name because it is you insisting that you can describe the<br/>
entire Christian religion and what it stands for in one post.<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s personal.  I know you weren&#39;t naming anyone, but it&#39;s over <br/>
simplified<br/>
generalizations such as you made that make Christians look like strange<br/>
zealots.  I named you only so you knew what post I referred to, since the <br/>
whole<br/>
group exploded about that time.<br/>
I had just said I am Christian, and you come up with a post saying &quot;That&#39;s <br/>
what<br/>
Christians believe, I know!&quot;.  So I felt it encompassed me.  Not that you <br/>
meant<br/>
me or directed it at me, but I&#39;m sure others know what I am saying even if<br/>
you don&#39;t.<br/>
I can&#39;t help but wonder if you are being deliberatly obtuse, acting as if you<br/>
don&#39;t realize which post I am referring to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Does the list exist for people to be welcomed, or to exchange information <br/>
&gt;  among homeschoolers?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, this is a humorous statement coming from you.  I would say it&#39;s to <br/>
exchange information, of course.<br/>
Again.......I was not saying I was upset by not being welcomed.  I said the <br/>
arguing<br/>
was so loud that no one heard any homeschooling discussion going on.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a couple of people now that want to say I am leaving because I was<br/>
not welcomed.  That&#39;s not true, that fact is only one aspect of many reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I THOUGHT it was about exchanging information among homeschoolers, but<br/>
was shown differently, as were many people who quietly agreed with me on<br/>
private emails.  You now make the above statement to say it IS to exchange <br/>
info,<br/>
and yet you were one of the most vocal, saying inflamatory things about <br/>
religions<br/>
you don&#39;t truly show a respect for..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt;  The political problem involved jumping on a family about raising dogs.  My <br/>
&gt;  pointing to the juxtaposition of that and the earlier pro-life arguments <br/>
&gt;  (also about politics) was jumped on as being personal, which is was not.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t thinking of EITHER of these posts.  I&#39;m talking about your <br/>
generalization<br/>
that all Christians think they HAVE to save you, that everyone is sinful, etc <br/>
etc.<br/>
You went so  far in one sentence as to say &quot;I&#39;m serious, they really believe <br/>
that!&quot;&quot;<br/>
When in fact, many many Christians do NOT.  <br/>
Many of us hold ideas exactly opposite of what you state as FACT.<br/>
I cannot imagine that any Hindu&#39;s, Pagan&#39;s, Buddhist&#39;s or any other religion<br/>
represented here, would appreciate you over simplifying their beliefs and<br/>
adding to anti-whateverreligion beliefs...<br/>
I imagine that they, too, would mention that that is an oversimplisitic <br/>
generalization<br/>
that is not true of many people in their religions.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t find your pro life posts personal at all.  I understood you were <br/>
generalizing<br/>
about RADICAL pro lifers.  It was your generalization on what YOU think the<br/>
Christian religion is all about.  For myself and my family, your description <br/>
was<br/>
far from accurate.  <br/>
<br/>
If you had the right to state your opinon, I also had the right to state mine.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t like it, and others didn&#39;t care for how you said your <br/>
opinon.<br/>
Such is life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Neither the presidential nor the dog overpopulation posts were mine.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, but I wasn&#39;t referring to either of them.  Others found other things <br/>
objectionable<br/>
I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
I joined several unschool groups at the same time as this one.  This is the <br/>
only<br/>
one that is soooooo disrespectful about people beliefs.  I cannot believe the <br/>
arguing<br/>
here, and am kind of getting upset with myself for responding and <br/>
participating.<br/>
Yet I felt I needed to say something.<br/>
<br/>
Now you can justify it any way you want, say it got personal, say you never <br/>
said<br/>
what you did, and claim I left because I wasn&#39;t welcomed properly.<br/>
I&#39;m done deciding whether or not I&#39;ll stay, when well over half the posts are<br/>
negative and nothing to do with unschooling, it&#39;s an easy choice.  I&#39;m off<br/>
to another less inflammatory group.<br/>
You can have the last word.<br/>
