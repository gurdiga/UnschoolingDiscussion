Frank  Smith said when he spoke at the HSC conference a couple of years back <br/>
that  people need to be with the people they want to become like (not a <br/>
quote,  <br/>
he said it better).  If people want to &#39;be recovered,&#39; they need to  be <br/>
around <br/>
people who care about not drinking (or whatever it is).  If  parents want to <br/>
become parents who are courageous about freedoms for  children, they need to <br/>
commune with those kinds of parents (at least  online or somehow if they <br/>
can&#39;t find <br/>
a group of them in  person).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
In less than a month, my family has spent a weekend at the L&L  Unschooling <br/>
conference and at a local homeschooling (very relaxed) family  camp-out.<br/>
 <br/>
We had a very good time at the camp-out----some very nice people and lots  of <br/>
neat activities---all in the magic of the mountains. BUT... (ain&#39;t there  <br/>
always? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s so easy to see how Frank Smith&#39;s idea plays out. This was an inclusive  <br/>
group---anyone can attend. It seems that most are unschoolers (several  <br/>
radicals) and relaxed homeschoolers: they seem to be the only  ones who are willing <br/>
to spend a weekend with their kids! &lt;G&gt; But it was  NOT a solely radical <br/>
unschoolers group----and you could feel the  difference.<br/>
 <br/>
I NEED to be around unschoolers. I know that. Just having a few curriculm  <br/>
users there made it &quot;acceptable&quot; to use a curriculum! Made it OK to discuss  <br/>
Saxon Math. Made it OK to yell at kids (not a lot; just a couple). It just  <br/>
wasn&#39;t the same. <br/>
 <br/>
I think when your options are homeschoolers OR schoolers, then  homeschoolers <br/>
are more like-mided. But if you have an option of unschoolers OR  an <br/>
inclusive homeschool group----it&#39;s just not like-minded at all and.....well,  it&#39;s <br/>
HARD to be around the c-word. <br/>
 <br/>
I guess I&#39;m just not very inclusive! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
In the first hour of the L&L conference, a few of us heard a mom being  very <br/>
short-tempered and snapping at her kids. One mom whispered to me, &quot;I  didn&#39;t <br/>
think I&#39;d hear *that* an this conference.&quot; I responded that this was the  first <br/>
hour---that she must be new, and that she won&#39;t be acting like that by  <br/>
Sunday! I was right. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Being surrounded by radical unschoolers makes it so much easier to BE a  <br/>
radical unschooler. The feeling permeates the air---and US!<br/>
 <br/>
It was also easier to see how controlling your children is easier when  <br/>
surrounded by controlling parents with controlled kids. Moms whose kids are  <br/>
getting &quot;out-of-hand&quot; are immediately made to feel that they NEED  to do  something <br/>
about it. <br/>
 <br/>
We really had a good time, but we recognized *our* need to be around  <br/>
unschooling families---around like minds.<br/>

Holly said after the trip to the Peabody conference that it was really nice <br/>
being around so many unschoolers, and the kids were different.  She has <br/>
commented since (obviously still thinking about it) about kids from the structured <br/>
homeschooling families being less fun to be around.  I mentioned this on another <br/>
list and a couple of people assured the list that THEIR kids couldn&#39;t tell <br/>
any difference and Holly must just be [what did they say? intolerant, I think].<br/>
<br/>
I think Holly is perceptive and interested in the differences in families.   <br/>
She knows the kind of parent she doesn&#39;t want to be, and in part it seems <br/>
she&#39;s going by the ways the children interact on the side, when the parents aren&#39;t <br/>
there.<br/>

I am relatively new to this list -- I joined after attending the Live and Learn conference. I have to say that this conference was really altering to me and my family. We have always felt uncomfortable in our local homeschooling groups, and truthfully didn&#39;t quite understand why. I must say that after a day at the conference we all just started feeling like we had found home. My daughter felt totally comfortable, and commented that everyone she met was different, and it was okay! They were not necessarily different like her, but different like themselves. So after trying to figure out what type of learners we are, we have learned that we are much more in tune with unschoolers. Why has it taken us so long? I am learning so much from this list, and I am questioning so much about myself as a parent. And I agree with needing to be around people who inspire me. Thank you!<br/>
