&lt;&lt;  Please <br/>
 be assured I am not asking questions or starting arguments just to ask <br/>
 questions or start arguments, I genuinely would like to look at this from <br/>
 different perspectives &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can tell from your honest questions and willingness to hear the answers <br/>
that this is true!!!  <br/>
It can be really difficult, but often a shift in how we view the child is all <br/>
that&#39;s needed.<br/>
I do believe you could give her more freedom, less direction about the little <br/>
things.<br/>
Some of the things you&#39;ve listed are typical of many children. They don&#39;t <br/>
understand that the baby is in danger, and just because you&#39;ve told them so <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they believe you.<br/>
I don&#39;t have time to answer to every single trait you&#39;ve listed right now, I <br/>
could do it tonight, but I&#39;ve got to get ready for work soon.<br/>
I really think you would benefit in a BIG way from reading some of Anne O&#39;s <br/>
posts about her son over at unschooling.com.<br/>
The article she wrote for the Nov./Dec issue of HEM brought tears to my eyes.<br/>
Her son has challenges far above and beyond ADD. Things like high level <br/>
autism and other labels could be applied to him. She talks about her quest <br/>
for information in understanding his difficulties and how she chooses to not <br/>
label him or see him in any way but her sweet, wonderful boy. There are ways <br/>
that she meets his uniqe needs, but she largely credits him for leading them <br/>
to unschooling.<br/>
For teaching them, and for changing their lives.<br/>
She writes eloquently and beautifully on this topic, I think you&#39;d really <br/>
enjoy reading her stuff.<br/>
You can back order that issue of HEM for 6.50 ( I recently did so myself) and <br/>
Sandra has a great article in that issue also.<br/>
She has also written a lot on the topic over at unschooling.com message <br/>
boards.<br/>
More later...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475336367">&lt;&lt;We just kind of asked and expected them to be nice and eventually they<br/>
were&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you are saying because we have always had various species<br/>
living well together, currently 3 dogs, a cat, 5 goats, a parakeet and 10<br/>
rabbits.  The border collie doesn&#39;t appear to be trying to harm the cat in<br/>
anyway, just herding it like the sheep dogs on &quot;Babe.&quot;  The poor cat will<br/>
finally just sit down and the dog will circle and circle him in a crouched<br/>
manner.  It seems like the dog just thinks this is what she is supposed to<br/>
be doing.<br/>

MY kids to be subjected to such ridiculous instructional methods and it gives <br/>
me absolute confidence that unschooling is a way better idea.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; challenging anymore? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some traits may be challenging still of course - some yes, some no. But all <br/>
kids have traits that are challenging. Imagine (I&#39;m sure it is difficult &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
having an overly passive child who doesn&#39;t have much energy, for example. <br/>
Imagine ME - social butterfly that I am - having a child who craves solitude <br/>
and only wants a friend or two - not a group person. Imagine unschooling kids <br/>
who don&#39;t communicate well. Imagine kids who are explosive - who get really <br/>
angry easily.<br/>
<br/>
All of these are challenges - personality traits that make parenting more <br/>
difficult than with easy-going kids.<br/>
<br/>
And kids each have their own individual mix of these traits and they interact <br/>
differently with each different member of the family and differently in <br/>
different situations.<br/>
<br/>
But they don&#39;t need labels -- they just need to be recognized and handled as <br/>
you, the parent, figure out works best for your child. In fact, to label them <br/>
is to make it seem like the label really TELLS you anything more than what <br/>
YOU already know, as a parent. Lots of the traits listed for ADD are common <br/>
traits in all kids - the ADD lable just means that these traits are so <br/>
persistent and intense that they always interfere with their functioning in <br/>
at least a couple of different environments.<br/>
<br/>
But -- the label itself is not going to be relevant at all unless a kid is in <br/>
school and needs special services there.<br/>

where a border collie lived.  After the party had been going for a while, <br/>
the people noticed that they were all standing in the middle of the room!<br/>
The only thing I can think of is to notice and reward the dog anytime she <br/>
*isn&#39;t* herding the poor cat.<br/>
