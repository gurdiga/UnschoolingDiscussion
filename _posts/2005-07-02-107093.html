<div id="ygrps-yiv-220775032">&lt;&lt;The problem I was describing in my earlier post is that my 2  year old<br/>
will nurse, lie there for a while, and then pop up and want to  play,<br/>
roll over us, etc.  *That&#39;s* when I bring in the sensory stuff  --<br/>
something to help him release the awake. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I feel better now  that I&#39;ve clarified. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

Our children are 13,5,3 and 1<br/>
We co-sleep also with our 1 and 3 yr old.  We don&#39;t practice naps we  just <br/>
sleep when we feel the need.<br/>
Is it possible to turn the lighting down a bit more? We have found that  with <br/>
our 3yr old Nicholas needs less light to sleep by.<br/>
Our 1 yr old nurses to sleep but I have found if he hears the theme song  to <br/>
PBS Sprout OnDemand he sits up and may begin to dance around.  We do play them <br/>
still but just as soon as we get into bed.  <br/>
We also go to bed later. <br/>

Yes, the lights will be out, everyone asleep, it will be 10 or 11 at<br/>
night, and dear 2 y.o. Riley, after nursing and lying there for a few<br/>
minutes, will be perched on my chest, pressing his face hard into mine<br/>
and smiling.  This will be after low lights for a while, PJs, some<br/>
nice lavender lotion on his body, watching some Baby Einstein, etc. <br/>
It&#39;s not every night, but when it happens, that&#39;s when I know he wants<br/>
to go to sleep, but his &quot;active-ness&quot; hasn&#39;t left his body yet<br/>
(overall he is a *very* active and intense 2 y.o.).  That&#39;s what I<br/>
mean by attending to his sensory needs.<br/>
<br/>
What we do lately is he lies on top of me in bed while I hold him<br/>
tight and I rock him side to side with both my arms and my body.  It&#39;s<br/>
a pretty hard rocking, but the pressure and the rhythm of it allows<br/>
him to finally release and relax enough to get to sleep.  It&#39;s also<br/>
really pleasant and snuggly and comforting for both of us. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone also mentioned naps, and I agree that I have to watch those. <br/>
He still falls asleep easily in the afternoon, and it doesn&#39;t work to<br/>
try to skip his nap.  But if he sleeps too long or too late, he&#39;ll be<br/>
up until 12 or 1 a.m., and then up again at 7 or 8.  Not enough sleep<br/>
for Mama! &lt;g&gt;  So it works to start being noisy at a certain point in<br/>
his nap -- 2 hours or less. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our situation is certainly working for us, but I also have to pay much<br/>
more attention to helping Riley sleep than I ever did for Fisher, our<br/>
8 y.o. son.  I don&#39;t mind having to do so -- it&#39;s just interesting and<br/>
a bit surprising for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found with my DS that sometimes a really firm back rub or foot rub <br/>
(even when he was a toddler) really helped him relax his energetic <br/>
self. At that age, we&#39;d be snuggled as you describe, face to face, <br/>
and I&#39;d wrap my arms around and slowly &quot;walk&quot; my fingertips down his <br/>
back, pressing gently with all fingertips then moving down a bit and <br/>
pressing again, on both sides of his spine, especially in the area <br/>
between the shoulder blades. One good thing about a foot rub is that <br/>
the recipient is going anywhere because you&#39;ve got their feet in <br/>
your hands. DS is 7 now and still requests back and foot rubs when <br/>
he needs help unwinding - and I&#39;ll still offer them when it looks <br/>
like he needs to unwind. He has different &quot;Settings&quot; now - snow (a <br/>
smoothing type motion), rain (fingertip pat like raindrops), etc.</div>
