<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955637831">Gee, even if Star Search were still around, I&#39;m not thinking this would win<br/>
the $100,000 for comedy routines.  But to answer the question, however<br/>
snidely (or would that be snarkily) put, for starters, dyslexia does not<br/>
mean &quot;difficulty reading.&quot;  That is a ps definition put out there by<br/>
non-medically trained personnel intent on getting more special ed money.<br/>
<br/>
Under the dyslexia umbrella are:<br/>
<br/>
Dyslexia - a language-based disability in which a person has trouble<br/>
understanding words, sentences or paragraphs; both oral and written language<br/>
are affected.<br/>
<br/>
Dyscalculia - a mathematical disability in which a person has unusual<br/>
difficulty solving arithmetic problems and grasping math concepts.<br/>
<br/>
Dysgraphia - a neurological-based writing disability in which a person finds<br/>
it hard to form letters or write within a defined space.<br/>
<br/>
Dyslexics are visual, multi-dimensional thinkers sometimes described as<br/>
&quot;intuitive and highly creative, and excel at hands-on learning.&quot;  They think<br/>
in pictures, so it is sometimes hard for them to understand letters,<br/>
numbers, symbols, and the spoken and written words.<br/>
<br/>
Dyslexia is a congenital and developmental condition which creates<br/>
neurological anomalies in the brain. These anomalies bring about varying<br/>
degrees of difficulty in learning when using words, and sometimes symbols.<br/>
<br/>
About 60% of dyslexic people have phonological difficulties--difficulties<br/>
sorting out the sounds within words.  This isn&#39;t limited to problems with<br/>
reading, writing and spelling.  The majority of dyslexic children have<br/>
difficulty with language, memory and sequencing processes of basic<br/>
mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
But then you are the resident expert on learning disabilities, so you knew<br/>
all that, right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031150518">Even if a child is &#39;diagnosed&#39; with real dyslexia does<br/>
that mean the child needs reading lessons or any kind<br/>
of specialized help? I have a friend who was<br/>
homeschooled very child lead until she was heading<br/>
into highschool I think. She had something similar to<br/>
dyslexia. I don&#39;t think her parents ever knew that<br/>
when she was young. She learned to read late. She said<br/>
it was always a struggle to keep the words still on<br/>
the page. She learned to read by word recognition not<br/>
by the shapes of the letters. She is still challenged<br/>
by spelling. Yet she learned how to read with out any<br/>
intervention. That is what I as unschooler wants to<br/>
know. Later she did get identified with a rare form of<br/>
something I don&#39;t really know of it fell in the<br/>
Dyslexic label or not. She wears a special form of<br/>
glasses  that helps calm the words on the page down or<br/>
calms her eyes down and helps the messages reach her<br/>
brain more clearly. Later in her life it was helpful<br/>
to know she had a physical problem with reading so she<br/>
could get help. Just like we would go get glasses for<br/>
a kid who was near sighted or far sighted. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t go get glasses for a kid early to prevent<br/>
the child from getting poor eye sight that might<br/>
actually be the wrong thing to do. It might more<br/>
likely ensure a childs eyesight becomes weeker. So we<br/>
might want to know if Dyslexia runs in the family to<br/>
know if our kids has it just in case there is<br/>
something we could do to make it easier. Like the<br/>
glasses my friend wears. My friend did learn to read<br/>
without them.<br/>
<br/>
If one of my kids had dyslexia I don&#39;t think I would<br/>
ever sit down and do the lesson ideas or a program<br/>
with them in a real formal way like it happens in<br/>
schools. I would probably read up more about it and<br/>
find a way to help without her knowing it. I would<br/>
also allow room for a late reader. If a kid has<br/>
dyslexia this a problem that never goes away. They<br/>
will likely always struggle with reading. Or it might<br/>
take a person who has dyslexia longer to read. It<br/>
seems to me over focusing on the problem would make<br/>
reading more of a chore more of an issue. A kid who<br/>
was unschooled would hopefully never get the stigma of<br/>
the dyslexic label. They would be allowed to follow<br/>
their passions that don&#39;t require lots of reading.<br/>
They would naturally figure out methods to learn<br/>
things they want to learn without reading. When they<br/>
finally wanted to learn to read or learn to read<br/>
better they would. Reading would be a tool for them.<br/>
So they would learn better how to use the reading<br/>
tool.<br/>
