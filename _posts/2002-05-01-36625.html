&gt; once <br/>
&gt; in awhile to be reminded that sometimes what we meant when we wrote <br/>
&gt; something <br/>
&gt; is not the way it&#39;s being read and so we as writers and readers have to <br/>
&gt; take <br/>
&gt; that into consideration.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It hurts the list, though, because there are hundreds of us here and if we <br/>
each pull out an example of what we think is bad posting and say that it is <br/>
just a reminder to everybody to be considerate, then the list will be filled <br/>
up with that and with people defending themselves and so on.<br/>
<br/>
People who are offensive will still be offensive no matter how many gentle <br/>
reminders they get.<br/>
<br/>
But - the subject does make me think about....<br/>
HOW do we help our kids develop into people who are courteous and considerate <br/>
enough to be good company and yet honest and forthright too?<br/>
<br/>
Some kid - probably 8 or 9 - walked up to me and my kids once and said to me <br/>
(yes, right out of nowhere), &quot;Your shirt is ugly.&quot; Seriously. It was sort of <br/>
muddy tie-dyed shirt that one of my kids had made and was ugly. The kid&#39;s dad <br/>
was right there. Unschoolers. (NO - nobody on this list, so stop wondering if <br/>
it was your kid &lt;G&gt;.) <br/>
<br/>
So - what should that kid&#39;s dad have done - what should I have done (a kid I <br/>
knew, not a stranger).<br/>

Some of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>
harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>
uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I were the one wearing the ugly shirt and a kid I knew told me it was<br/>
ugly, I would smile and say &quot;It&#39;s not ugly. It&#39;s just DIFFerent!&quot; and I<br/>
would continue to smile.<br/>
<br/>
If my son were to tell an adult we know that their shirt is ugly, I would<br/>
probably just give him a &quot;look&quot; and maybe tell him &quot;that&#39;s not a nice thing<br/>
to say&quot;. I would hope that my son would already know not to say someone&#39;s<br/>
shirt is ugly, even if they truly feel that way.<br/>
