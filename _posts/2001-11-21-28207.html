<div id="ygrps-yiv-121614592">Somebody recently (within the past year or so) wrote a book about why<br/>
teenagers take risks (drunk driving, dangerous drugs, out late at night in<br/>
dangerous places, etc.) The point was that teens need challenge, and if they<br/>
dont get real, worthwhile, grownup things to do, to test their skills and<br/>
inner resources against, and to use for finding their place in the world,<br/>
theyll settle for doing dumb, pointless, teenage stuff. Does anyone know<br/>
the name of the book? Would you recommend it?<br/>
<br/>
John Holt also wrote something once (maybe in Instead of Education) about<br/>
why some alternative schools (back when alternative school meant a place<br/>
where kids were allowed more freedom than in most schools) seemed to harbor<br/>
fairly large numbers of angry, depressed, frustrated young people (not just<br/>
kids who were recovering form having been badly treated in traditional<br/>
schools, but kids who had spent their entire childhoods relatively free).<br/>
<br/>
His conclusion was that, in a school where the kids are freed of the petty,<br/>
silly demands of tests and grades and homework and dress codes and proper<br/>
use of titles in addressing the adults and correct format for chapter<br/>
outlines and so on, at a certain age they cant help waking up to the fact<br/>
that they are basically here in a society and a world that often makes very<br/>
little sense and that most adults are doing little to try to change. In the<br/>
words of Paul Goodman (in a book by this title), they are growing up<br/>
absurd.<br/>
<br/>
John wrote that this doesnt mean the alternative schools failed  because<br/>
it wasnt really their job to turn out happy people. You allow kids to spend<br/>
early childhood stomping in mud puddles, throwing things up in the air,<br/>
reading the storybooks they like best and building whatever they want out of<br/>
Legos - and at some point that isnt enough anymore. They want to tackle<br/>
real problems.<br/>
<br/>
Im thinking a lot about this lately because my husband and I are trying to<br/>
figure out a way for him to do something better with his life than be the<br/>
manager of a Manhattan consumer electronics store for a major corporation.<br/>
We had been thinking about this for a while, but the events of Sept. 11th<br/>
clinched it.<br/>
<br/>
If my husband and I believe, as we do, that (for example) our wasteful use<br/>
of oil has something to do with the tensions and bloodshed connected to the<br/>
Middle East and, increasingly, other parts of the world, why are we not<br/>
doing something about it? The saddest thing about this society to me is that<br/>
so few adults do work they really believe in, and that contributes to<br/>
positive change, rather than just something to make a living.<br/>
<br/>
How can teenagers not be upset to look around and see that this is true?<br/>
They are bombarded by urgent messages from the media about all that is<br/>
terrible in the world, and then they look around and see that their own<br/>
parents are doing nothing to change anything. If the kids are asked to help<br/>
at all, its in the form of penny drives (not to knock the charity, but it<br/>
doesnt tend to get at the roots of big problems). If you were a teen,<br/>
wouldnt all this make you feel like snapping and carping at your parents,<br/>
rebelling and picking fights over nothing?<br/>
<br/>
I myself left home at 15 and, aside from the fact that we had a lot of<br/>
family problems, part of it was feeling that I was growing up absurd.<br/>
<br/>
(Okay, so now the person who posted the original question about teenage<br/>
rebellion will probably respond that his/her parents were full-time<br/>
environmentalists/peace activists/alternative technology promoters, in an<br/>
organization that truly accomplished practical things, who always allowed<br/>
him/her to be involved in important volunteer work - and that will blow my<br/>
theory about his/her own disaffected youth!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if anyone has any leads on positive jobs for my husband, possibly in<br/>
alternative (solar, wind, fuel cell, etc.) energy, ethical investing or<br/>
microcredit, please email me privately. His experience is in retail and<br/>
computers but he has a degree in psychology, for what thats worth. We want<br/>
out of New York City, too.<br/>
<br/>
I myself am busy with our two-year-old and with writing a book on attachment<br/>
parenting/the continuum concept, but could do something part-time to<br/>
supplement his pay (translating, interpreting, childcare, environmental ed,<br/>
teaching English as a second language, writing, editing).<br/>
