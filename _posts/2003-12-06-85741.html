<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934799200">For the moderators and oldtimers here, from someone new:<br/>
<br/>
       It&#39;s my impression that almost all the posts on this thread have been <br/>
positive toward owning and using guns, hunting, playing gory video games, et <br/>
cetera, with no ill effects. The personal stories shared seem pretty positive <br/>
toward integrating guns with family life, society and entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
        Please refer me to threads in the archives or to other links if you&#39;d <br/>
rather not explain onlist, but I am genuinely curious to know more about why <br/>
it appears (at least to me, for the moment) that there&#39;s a pro-gun orientation <br/>
among experienced unschoolers. I  never expected this topic to come up in <br/>
relation to unschooling, and if I had expected it, I&#39;d likely have predicted the <br/>
opposite leaning -- JJ</div>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t call myself pro gun any more than I would call myself pro<br/>
pointy stick.&lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t own a gun and I&#39;ve never fired one.  My<br/>
husband, in a previous life, liked to shoot targets, but he hasn&#39;t in a<br/>
few years.   He was never a hunter. <br/>
<br/>
I think guns are tools.  They happen to be effective killing tools, but<br/>
humans are all about killing, and I&#39;m not surprised we develop better and<br/>
better tools to help us do that.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the tool makes us<br/>
killers.  I think killers make their tools. <br/>
<br/>
We evolved as hunters, defenders of self and territory.  I think those<br/>
are part of our selves and to think we can ignore it or suppress it is<br/>
naive.   I&#39;m all for evolution, and I&#39;m idealistic enough to believe<br/>
humans will eventually be better able to control their violent natures.  <br/>
<br/>
From my vegan point of view it seems no more violent to me to own a gun,<br/>
shoot targets or critters, play shooting games, than it does to buy<br/>
cleanly packaged meat from a slaughter house or wear leather shoes or<br/>
play with a leather baseball glove or smear emu cream on our owies.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s a matter of perspective.  Is my neighbor who hunts more<br/>
violent than my neighbor who lets someone else do her killing for her? <br/>
<br/>
And am I less violent when I drive my car forty miles to the vegie store<br/>
all the while smashing a berzillion bugs on my windshield?   Dylan&#39;s<br/>
going to invent pheromone mile markers that keep bugs from flying and<br/>
crawling over roads.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a really nice kid.  He doesn&#39;t eat meat because he loves animals<br/>
and thinks they shouldn&#39;t have to die for his sake.  He loves bugs and<br/>
all kinds of creeping things and happily carries flies and spiders out of<br/>
our house.  He&#39;s kind and has never hurt anyone.  He likes to hit a<br/>
target.  He likes Quake and Medal of Honor.  It won&#39;t hurt him because<br/>
his real life is full of respect and caring and decency.  <br/>
<br/>
I know parents who won&#39;t let their kids play violent video games but who<br/>
stomp spiders and trap mice and chop heads of chickens by the back door. <br/>
 If we&#39;re going to get uptight about violence lets first start talking<br/>
about what is violent.  If we&#39;re so worried our kids won&#39;t have respect<br/>
for life, let&#39;s think about being respectful of life. <br/>
<br/>
I think we can gives games like that a lot of power they don&#39;t really<br/>
have.  They are not more powerful than loving parents, real compassion<br/>
and kindness, or a life of goodness and joy.   <br/>
<br/>
No one is harmed in a game.  None of it is real.  That steak on the<br/>
dinner plate is real though and means someone really died.   No one will<br/>
ever convince me the connection between kids and violence is video games<br/>
or TV.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, I&#39;m not pro gun.  I&#39;m pro kid.  I think my kid has more control<br/>
over his mind and life than a gun or game has.&lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452990891">Just wanted to comment on this one. I wouldn&#39;t say we are pro gun here at<br/>
home. We don&#39;t own any guns, never have and no one here has ever fired one.<br/>
<br/>
When Joseph (almost 9 now) was little, I was not wanting him to play with<br/>
guns. Just didn&#39;t think it was a good idea. Not really sure why but I think<br/>
in part it was because I didn&#39;t want a violent little child who ran around<br/>
and pretended to shoot people. (like I had seen other children do at the<br/>
park) So my idea to just never have anyone buy him toy guns was put in<br/>
effect. I also must add that he never asked for any toy guns either.<br/>
<br/>
Well eventually he would build guns out of Legos and plastic whatevers he<br/>
would find. When I would ask him about the &quot;guns&quot; he would explain that they<br/>
were tranquilizer guns and he was hunting dinosaurs. (He saw Jurassic Park<br/>
and that&#39;s where that all started) Starship Troopers was one of this<br/>
favorite movies also and well, you *need* guns to shoot the bad bugs! By<br/>
then I changed my thinking about guns, (along with watching wrestling on TV<br/>
&lt;BG&gt;) and they both had squirt guns and laser noisy guns to play with. There<br/>
was never any desire for other real looking kinds and the play was still<br/>
always shooting &quot;bad&quot; stuff. When Joseph decided to be an army guy for<br/>
Halloween because he liked the outfit, he wanted a machine gun to go alone.<br/>
He never played with, just carried it along on Halloween and put it away. I<br/>
think Alyssa broke it and no one missed it. He also has play knives from his<br/>
ninja costumes too.<br/>
<br/>
The kids play wrestling games on playstation and Joseph likes army shooting<br/>
games and sniper type video games too. He&#39;s really pretty good at them and<br/>
even finished one game all the way through long before Joe was ever able to<br/>
get that far. Sierra loves wrestling and gets a kick out of smashing people<br/>
all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
They know they are games and they know they aren&#39;t hurting real people or<br/>
animals or whatever. All my kids are gentle when it comes to other living<br/>
things. Joseph has gotten himself in the middle of a few squabbles with<br/>
other kids only because he tries to be the peacemaker. Sometimes the kids<br/>
don&#39;t want someone to stop them. He can&#39;t understand why people would want<br/>
to fight.<br/>
<br/>
So no matter how many studies come out saying violent video games create<br/>
violent kids, ( and another just recently did come out saying that&#39;s a fact)<br/>
I don&#39;t listen. I can&#39;t possibly see how all the nurturing, love and respect<br/>
we give our kids would not be more of an influence than a game.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170470210">Deb L&#39;s response was wonderful.  Some of my favorite parts:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t call myself pro gun any more than I would call myself pro<br/>
pointy stick.&lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt; So, no, I&#39;m not pro gun.  I&#39;m pro kid. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not &quot;pro gun.&quot;  I&#39;m anti-&quot;anti-gun,&quot; because &quot;anti-gun&quot; not only doesn&#39;t <br/>
serve its intended purpose, it causes damage in the relationship and IF a <br/>
child gets a gun-fascination and is deprived of even playing with toy guns, he&#39;s <br/>
going to be a more dangerous teen/adult than one in whose lives guns were <br/>
treated like what they are instead of a demonized representation of all evil <br/>
violence.   Chain saws are dangerous, but I don&#39;t know any mothers going on <br/>
anti-chain-saw rants.   Electric drills are dangerous.  Nail guns are dangerous.   <br/>
(Even without exposure to the movies Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Pi and Color of <br/>
Night, respectively.)<br/>
<br/>
Believing that gun-banishment is wrong is not the same as feeling guns should <br/>
be issued to all children and they should be put on a gun-use regimen.<br/>
<br/>
This swinging from one extreme to another isn&#39;t good for thinking and it&#39;s <br/>
not good for discussion and it&#39;s REALLY bad for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I think I thought about that a couple of months ago:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not pro-gun, it&#39;s anti-controlling.<br/>
<br/>
Toy guns or video games, like television, food, bedtime, reading, clothes, <br/>
etc., all involve issues of learning, experimentation, thought, sharing, <br/>
individual preference, and the same arguments against requiring or restricting or <br/>
mom-chosen limits apply to guns as to so many other things.<br/>
