<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remind my kids about time.  My 13 yo can go to bed when she feels <br/>
like it.  I let her know what&#39;s going on the next day, we work out <br/>
the details of the morning and then she makes a decision about how <br/>
much sleep she will need accordingly.  Sometimes she chooses to stay <br/>
up really late and not get much sleep, sometimes she goes to bed <br/>
early so that she can wake up feeling rested.  She knows the <br/>
difference and is willing to live with her decision.  She is also <br/>
welcome to take naps as needed.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 yo will only go to bed when I do.  Wether she&#39;s tired or not.  <br/>
If she isn&#39;t tired, she doesn&#39;t go to sleep, she stays awake and <br/>
watches tv or plays in bed with dolls or a game.  I tell her when it <br/>
is bedtime, or rather when it is MY bedtime.  Sometimes she wants to <br/>
stay up with her dad, but mostly she wants to be in bed with me.  <br/>
When I&#39;m getting my pj&#39;s on and brushing my teeth, that is what she <br/>
is doing, just so that she&#39;s ready for falling asleep when she is <br/>
tired enough to do so.<br/>
<br/>
We call it bedtime and prepare for it.  I remind her of the time and <br/>
let her know how much more time there is before we climb in.  This <br/>
particular child doesn&#39;t need as much sleep as other kids her age, <br/>
she never took naps ever and still won&#39;t even if she is so tired <br/>
she&#39;s loopy and cranky.  We just work around that and offer other <br/>
ways to rest and get sleep, like sleeping in or going to bed a tiny <br/>
bit earlier, or doing quiet activities together that don&#39;t require <br/>
lots of energy.  Sometimes it&#39;s really hard to deal with a very tired <br/>
child, but it&#39;s easier than being disrespectful of her needs about <br/>
sleep and sleeping arrangements.</div>

If you go there, there&#39;s a player.  On the righthand side of the  <br/>
player is an up and down arrow.  Clicking there shows you the songlist.<br/>
<br/>
I just found this today.  It&#39;s very sweet, and goes to a three-part  <br/>
harmony section near the end that&#39;s glorious.  But it reminded me  <br/>
that separating children from adults is a problem.  Is &quot;bedtime&quot; a  <br/>
think adults enforce on children, or is it a sensible, shared,  <br/>
pleasant part of the day?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point!  I never really thought of it exactly like that, but that <br/>
is exactly what we do in our house.  A sensible, shared, mostly <br/>
pleasant time of the day.  Sometimes being really tired doesn&#39;t make <br/>
it as pleasant as could be.  <br/>
<br/>
We just recently realized this and started going to bed a wee bit <br/>
earlier to make it more pleasant.  If we wait till everyone is really <br/>
tired, it&#39;s sooo much harder and less pleasant.  I think part of <br/>
growing up is learning to listen to your internal cues.  Margaux is <br/>
still not really able to cue herself in to the fact that she is <br/>
getting tired, and we, the parents, keep missing Margaux&#39;s cues, as <br/>
she tends to go from happy high energy, to crash in 5 seconds.  Okay <br/>
I&#39;m exaggerating a little, but when we go to bed before everyone is <br/>
tired, there is a huge difference in attitude and pleasantness that <br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
Getting ready for bed doesn&#39;t mean going to sleep, something that <br/>
both my girls are keenly aware of.  Getting ready for bed, or having <br/>
a bedtime is just something we do to prepare ourselves for the <br/>
inevitable sleep that comes when we are tired enough to sleep.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a subtle shift in *purpose* of commentary, I think.<br/>
When Hayden, 8.7, seems over/under-whelmed by what&#39;s going on, I&#39;ll offer<br/>
other things. When there&#39;s no one available on Skype to talk to while he<br/>
plays WoW with them, for example. I can offer to sit with him (generally<br/>
with food in my hands, peanut butter or chicken works well here) and watch<br/>
(he loves to fill me in on the game), cheer him on; or we can play a board<br/>
game; or we can ride bikes... I don&#39;t think he needs to get off the<br/>
computer, though some of the things I offer are not computer related. Mostly<br/>
when he&#39;s been doing any one thing for a long time, I miss him. He&#39;s not<br/>
been playing too long, I&#39;ve been away too long. Yesterday I struck a cool<br/>
balance between hovering and absence. I heard friends sign off, I made up a<br/>
plate, I hung out & we chatted, then I excused myself when a friend came<br/>
back. win/win/win.<br/>
If a child wants to hear options, of course playing the piano would be on<br/>
the list - it&#39;s an option. When Hannah didn&#39;t tinkle on the piano for a few<br/>
days, I might mention it because I noticed and I missed it. She&#39;d still play<br/>
when *she* felt like it; it was nice for her to be reminded it was a<br/>
pleasant part of our life too, without obligation to play.<br/>
When I see that Hayden has a big pile of freezie-pop wrappers in front of<br/>
him and he&#39;s reaching for 5 more, I might mention I&#39;d be happy to make him<br/>
some food, did he know I just got more of his favorite X? - not a judgment,<br/>
reading the signs that he&#39;s hungry and is reaching for what&#39;s easy - he does<br/>
appreciate the offer and often takes me up on something more substantial. I<br/>
have to remember to have the substantial things easily accessible, too.<br/>
Hayden&#39;s been cooking his own eggs for months (he&#39;s moved up from scrambled<br/>
(wet or dry?) and is perfecting his over-easy) and has just added Ramen and<br/>
Grillers to his repertoire. Sometimes easy sweets is just what he needs.<br/>
(me, too! I requested and received popcorn and chocolate to perfect my<br/>
evening, last night!!)<br/>
He&#39;s been showering a lot lately. At least twice a week since we&#39;ve moved<br/>
(up from semi-monthly). And brushing his teeth. He&#39;s asked me to remind him<br/>
daily. So I do. Sometimes he goes and brushes right then and sometimes he<br/>
doesn&#39;t. He showered and brushed and put on new clothes for the Bowling for<br/>
Soup concert last weekend. I merely had the supplies ready.<br/>
I go to bed before he does. I make a sleeping spot for him and set up his<br/>
comforts before I turn in. I make sure he&#39;s fed and watered and well-loved.<br/>
He&#39;s asked me to curl up with him and I do. At some point I get crowded and<br/>
move to my own, larger, bed. He&#39;s even come to bed with me and the DVD<br/>
player. Having different schedules doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t have a *bedtime*<br/>
routine, or two or three ;) We also use this time to talk about the upcoming<br/>
days and what the time schedule is like. He&#39;ll often curl up in my bed if he<br/>
wants me to wake him up when I get up, before 10. He&#39;ll take the sofabed if<br/>
he&#39;s up late and wants to sleep in. I&#39;ll remind him, when he has asked, to<br/>
*begin cool down* earlier so he can get sleep for the next day. Sleep is<br/>
important, you should talk about it. There are ways to make it a<br/>
win/win/win/win/win situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m free to say things.<br/>
I&#39;m free to be sure those are comments that add to our relationship and not<br/>
detract.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821593006">-=-and using the computer too much-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s the idea of &quot;too much&quot; and not the child&#39;s computer use  <br/>
that&#39;s the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Parents have a model image of the way their child &quot;should&quot; be and  <br/>
they look at that instead of looking at their real, live child as she  <br/>
actually in that moment is.  That&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One parent reminds the child that its bedtime-=-<br/>
<br/>
If there IS a bedtime, someone might as well remind her.<br/>
<br/>
When something is scheduled, reminders are good (from anyone, to  <br/>
anyone).<br/>
<br/>
If something isn&#39;t scheduled, and the child is to be allowed to make  <br/>
her own decisions, or go to bed when she&#39;s tired instead of by the  <br/>
clock (if she&#39;s old enough to be up without others with her) that&#39;s a  <br/>
different deal.<br/>
<br/>
Mixing and matching can&#39;t work very well.  If one wants to take away  <br/>
reminders but not requirements, that doesn&#39;t make sense.  If one  <br/>
wants to take away requirements but still remind (shame?) kids to do  <br/>
the thing that is no longer &quot;required&quot; that&#39;s not good either.<br/>
