<div id="ygrps-yiv-556066893">The VHEA conference will be in Charlottesville, VA on April 21, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
Details are available on-line at: www.vhea.org<br/>
<br/>
FUN Books will be there and we will be bringing our discount bins of <br/>
overstocks, clearance, and &quot;scratch and dent&quot; items that will have <br/>
discounts of up to 50%. In addition, we will be offering 10% off the <br/>
marked prices of just about everything we bring to the conference <br/>
(including items in the discount bins that have already been marked <br/>
down!)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we will have limited space and can&#39;t bring everything <br/>
we have in our catalog. If there is an item that you have been <br/>
wanting to see in &quot;real life&quot; or something that you know you want to <br/>
purchase, send us your list. We will make every effort to bring the <br/>
items you request and we will even hold them in your name until at <br/>
least noon, so that you don&#39;t have to worry about us running out of <br/>
the items you want. If you like, you can place an order in advance <br/>
and pick it up at the conference so you won&#39;t have to pay any <br/>
shipping costs. You can see our selection at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.FUN-Books.com">http://www.FUN-Books.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Send your requests by e-mail to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fun@...">fun@...</a>. If you would like <br/>
to special order any items not listed in our catalog, and to help <br/>
make sure we have what you want in stock, please place your order by <br/>
4/16/01.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
