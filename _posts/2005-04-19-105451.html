that the first story involved her mother&#39;s ex boyfriend, not a <br/>
total stranger.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, he was a total stranger nothing at all to do with the Mother.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
and the dad was off at his girlfriend&#39;s house for the night.  That&#39;s not a story <br/>
of a close, happy family and an unknown neighbor.  <br/>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
She lived with her Father and his parents... The father raised a few other children also and she was his youngest and maybe the last at home. I don&#39;t think bad of him for sleeping at his girlfriends house that night, at least he had respect, and he was home at 6AM to wake her, that&#39;s how he found out she was gone....Sad and you NEVER ,NEVER no who is living right next door to you. That Man that killed her didn&#39;t live there all that long, he moved in with his sister....a total stranger. but you are right it could happen with your brother in law or cousin ... scary<br/>
