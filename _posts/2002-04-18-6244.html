I totally agree with you Elissa.<br/>
I think that the art of negotiation is vital in all of our relationships.<br/>
I need to honor and respect his needs/desires as much as my own.<br/>
And where he isn&#39;t as well informed, he does back off and let me have my way.<br/>
But we have to discuss it to figure out who is more informed and what the <br/>
intentions are.  He cares very much for his children too....it&#39;s not fair to <br/>
say that I&#39;m giving power away when I respect my dh.  It&#39;s not about power. <br/>
It&#39;s about love and respect.<br/>
