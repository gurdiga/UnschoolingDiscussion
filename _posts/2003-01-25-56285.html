&gt; Can you send me some links.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like to read more about this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Over the last two years, I&#39;ve learned a lot about the origins of the <br/>
&gt; church, some of which you mentioned here.  But the rest, like Saturday <br/>
&gt; being the Sabbath while Sunday being the Lord&#39;s Day is new to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t use a lot of web sites for this kind of information, but we read a <br/>
lot of books.  Probably the most definitive study of *Sunday* is by the <br/>
German scholar Willy Rordorf, in English translation as *Sunday: The History <br/>
of the Day of Rest and Worship in the Earliest Centuries of the Christian <br/>
Church* (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1968).  The early Christians <br/>
gathered for worship on the first day of the week in honor of the <br/>
resurrection of Christ.  They struggled with the commandment about observing <br/>
the sabbath, and some early Christians observed both the Sabbath and the <br/>
Lord&#39;s Day (especially in Eygpt).  But by and large they believed that the <br/>
new reality of Christ superceded or fulfilled the Law of Moses, at least in <br/>
its ritual aspects. <br/>
<br/>
If the Rordorf book is unaccessible you might want to check out the <br/>
multi-authored book, *The Study of Liturgy* edited by Cheslyn Jones, Geoffrey <br/>
Wainwright, and Edward Yarnold (Oxford University Press).  It was issed <br/>
recenly in a new edition and  can often be found on the shelves at Borders or <br/>
Barnes and Noble.<br/>

Hope this helps.<br/>
