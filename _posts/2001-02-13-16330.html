<div id="ygrps-yiv-267411725">&quot;I don&#39;t want a new baby.&quot;<br/>
This was my oldest son Brian&#39;s response when I told him his father <br/>
and I were expecting a third child.  We&#39;d survived the first round of <br/>
sibling rivalry when his brother, Damian was born.  But now, three-<br/>
year-old Brian had made his stand about this new baby, and neither <br/>
logic, reason, noe persuasion could budge him.<br/>
Puzzled, I asked him, &quot;Why don&#39;t you want a new baby?&quot;  With wide and <br/>
teary eyes, he looked straight at me and said, &quot;Because I want to <br/>
keep Damian.&quot;        by Rosemary Laurey<br/>

<br/>
My sister&#39;s best friend was very pregnant with her<br/>
second and my niece was told often that she had a baby<br/>
in her tummy. She stopped talking to her. Didn&#39;t say<br/>
anything mean, just started ignoring her mom&#39;s friend.<br/>
Then one day she very quietly and looking very<br/>
betrayed and sad said she didn&#39;t like her anymore.<br/>
when my sis asked her why she said &quot;Cuz she ATE her<br/>
baby, mom!&quot;<br/>
kids. gotta love &#39;em.<br/>
