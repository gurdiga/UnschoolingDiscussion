<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496766031">&quot;I believe that if you bring your children up knowing quality they will<br/>
recognize &quot;ugly&quot; in an instant! So far that is true.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying not to get offended by this statement....trying really hard.<br/>
<br/>
My boys LOVE some violent video games, hard-core music, some really <br/>
scary movies, they adore witty, crass humor, they swear and their some <br/>
of the most interesting, fun people I know.<br/>
<br/>
If they only watched things *I* thought weren&#39;t &quot;ugly&quot;, that would be <br/>
limiting their world. I&#39;ve learned to appreciate the intricacies of <br/>
crass humor, the very intelligent writing behind it.<br/>
<br/>
They were surrounded by Enya, Mozart and Bach as young children...they <br/>
love Metallica, System of a Down and Disturbed.<br/>
They were surrounded with &quot;lovely&quot; food, made from scratch, super <br/>
healthy vegetarian and all...they love potato chips, soda and <br/>
twizzlers.<br/>
They were surrounded by little or NO television, and only PBS or <br/>
other &quot;quality&quot; kids shows...they love Futurama, Family Guy and movies <br/>
like The Grudge.<br/>
They were surrounded by very little cussing (their Dad doesn&#39;t cuss at <br/>
all, I used a few words, very rarely) and Trevor tends to use some <br/>
pretty colorful language...though he does know when to put it on <br/>
hold.:)  He walked outside today and came back in saying &quot;It&#39;s FECKING <br/>
cold out there!!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So....I don&#39;t know what your version of &quot;ugly&quot; is, but I have a <br/>
feeling some of our tastes are in that category.<br/>
To me, &quot;ugly&quot; is how people treat each other, not their musical <br/>
tastes, use of swear words or what they watch.<br/>
<br/>
If my boys were mean to me, or hurtful to their family, that would <br/>
fall under &quot;ugly&quot;.<br/>
They are kind and condiderate human beings for the most part (I&#39;d love <br/>
their dishes to find the sink one day...but that&#39;s another issue) and <br/>
we all like being around each other.  I guess my definition of &quot;ugly&quot; <br/>
is just different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004751271">When I was a teenager, I was a punk rocker. At the same time I was  <br/>
loving the Sex Pistols, the Breeders, and the Circle Jerks, I was  <br/>
playing Beethoven, Debussy, and Clementi in piano lessons, and loving  <br/>
that too, and playing piano for a school choir that did corny old  <br/>
show tunes (&quot;oh, what a beautiful moo-o-orning!&quot;). I could see the  <br/>
beauty in all these things. I still can.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a young radical feminist, I never watched action movies  <br/>
because I knew they were sexist, violent, evil, and so on. All my  <br/>
teachers and role models had told me so. One night when I was about  <br/>
22 I came home to my parents&#39; house after working a late shift at a  <br/>
restaurant. I was too wired to sleep, so I turned on the TV. The only  <br/>
thing on was a late-night re-run of &quot;Die Hard.&quot; I watched it. I loved  <br/>
it. It changed my life! Not only did I love action movies for years  <br/>
(now I&#39;m swinging the other way and don&#39;t enjoy the realistic  <br/>
violence anymore), but I learned to stop judging things without  <br/>
exposing myself to them.<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time when I kept a blog I wrote about my days with punks:  <br/>

<br/>
I live in a college town. Sometimes when I&#39;m down near campus I like  <br/>
to watch the young men go by and wonder which one of them my son  <br/>
might grow up to be: The guy with the safety pin through his nose?  <br/>
The guy with the fraternity tattoo? The guy holding hands with the  <br/>
other guy, god bless their queer little hearts? The guy with no  <br/>
fashion sense and a book about the history of the vacuum tube? The  <br/>
one with the t-shirt that says, &quot;Come to MSU--it&#39;s a riot!&quot; with a  <br/>
picture of a couch burning in the street? I am very fondly disposed  <br/>
towards them all. It is perhaps the most important parenting goal I  <br/>
have to see the beauty in whatever young men my boys grow up to be.<br/>
