appears that babies can suffocate.<br/>

**I wanted to say  this, also. Babies who can roll over but can&#39;t push<br/>
themselves up well are at risk on a waterbed. They roll (or get rolled) onto<br/>
their face and can&#39;t push off again. We have a floatation mattress and love<br/>
it. Looks like a bed, but has a water &quot;bladder&quot; inside a mattress shell.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t need heat and takes regular sheets. I think I&#39;ll go back to bed<br/>
now....<br/>

on a waterbed.  Apparently, they need to be full so the <br/>
tension isn&#39;t saggy...<br/>
