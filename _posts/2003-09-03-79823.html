<div id="ygrps-yiv-185401185">&quot;Isn&#39;t unschooling giving you kids what they want? helping them learn in the<br/>
way that they want even if they are asking for more structured learning<br/>
tools?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes and no.<br/>
Yes, it is about helping them get what they want. BUT, what if they don&#39;t see that learing is everywhere? What if they&#39;ve been damaged by school and think they HAVE to use a curriculum to learn?<br/>
Our job is then to help them see learning everywhere. From what I remember, Lars was in school previously and all of his friends are schooled. This may be a hang up in thought, not what he truly wants. <br/>
I think our job is often to figure out the why&#39;s of things, not just respond immedietly with school books/work.<br/>

<br/>
No, actually he&#39;s never been in school, though all his friends are.<br/>
I&#39;ve just failed badly at helping him to see learning everywhere.  And at<br/>
this point I&#39;m not sure how to rectify that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think our job is often to figure out the why&#39;s of things, not just<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s the thing here.  I don&#39;t want to just hand him assignments and<br/>
curriculum.  If I was going to that, we might as well have done school at<br/>
home all along.<br/>
<br/>
All summer I never heard that he was bored.  The day school starts, he&#39;s<br/>
bored.  He fell asleep watching TV yesterday.  He never falls asleep<br/>
watching TV, but he said it was because he was bored because all his friends<br/>
are in school.  But anything I suggest?  No.  Last night he said we should<br/>
talk about it this morning.  I&#39;ve tried.  &quot;When do you want to talk about<br/>
schoolwork and stuff?&quot;  &quot;mmmnnnmmm&quot;.  So I follow him around a bit until he<br/>
sits down.  I sit down across the table.  He picks up the newspaper and<br/>
starts reading.  I write the beginnings of some lists:  Big Goals, Smaller<br/>
Goals, What he needs.  He doesn&#39;t look or ask me what I&#39;m doing.  So I pick<br/>
up a magazine and start looking at it.  &quot;Whatcha doin&#39;?&quot;  &quot;Reading a<br/>
magazine&quot;  &quot;Oh&quot;.  After a while he puts the paper down and goes up to watch<br/>
TV.  If I push it, he&#39;ll just huff at me.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t talk with this kid.  I don&#39;t even *want* to talk about schoolwork,<br/>
but I make myself available.  So he doesn&#39;t want to talk.  The car doesn&#39;t w<br/>
ork because he always turns the radio on.  It&#39;s too loud for me to hear what<br/>
he says, but if I turn it down he gets annoyed.  Then there&#39;s little point<br/>
in talking because he&#39;s started out annoyed.  I&#39;ve tried lately to just hang<br/>
out with him, watching TV or whatever.  He seems to appreciate it when I do,<br/>
but he still doesn&#39;t talk.  (I should take lessons from his girlfriend.  He<br/>
talks to her.)  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it hadn&#39;t been close to a year since the last time, I&#39;d think I was<br/>
PMSing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gentle hugs to you Tia!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was shocked to hear the statement of failure from you. I did a double take. <br/>
Thinking, surely Tia doesn&#39;t think she is failing her kid! Perhaps he is <br/>
simply going through a rite of passage of sorts. He is trying to find his own way, <br/>
and more than likely from the sounds of it, he silently appreciates you <br/>
&quot;being there&quot; but doesn&#39;t want your help right now. Kind of like when they are <br/>
babies and they are just beginning to walk, they don&#39;t want to hold your hand, but <br/>
they keep checking to see how far they can go and still be able to trust you <br/>
will be there if they fall.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a doubt in my mind that no matter how old he is now, your baby is <br/>
simply transitioning into manhood. And even if he refuses to talk about this <br/>
stuff with you, do you really believe that his not sharing with you is a <br/>
reflection on you? Maybe if you can just realize all you have done for him and all <br/>
he has learned without ever being &quot;taught&quot; you can rest assured that he is <br/>
going to be just fine. <br/>
<br/>
As far as bookwork goes, let him decide. Again his choice is not a reflection <br/>
of you, it&#39;s just him finding his own way. He may be inamorate (sp?) with <br/>
&quot;doing&quot; schooly stuff right now, but you have raised a free thinker and I am sure <br/>
he will continue to grow while traveling his own new roads.<br/>
<br/>
You are a fine mother Tia, please don&#39;t feel anything otherwise. He is lucky <br/>
to have a mom like you and for you to have a son like him.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you,<br/>
Rhonda<br/>

But if my kids thought they weren&#39;t learning anything and insisted that I get <br/>
books, that WOULD be a reflection on unschooling, and whether we had lived it <br/>
to the point that it was inside them and that they were confident in their <br/>
ability to learn, and aware of the legitimacy/&quot;realness&quot; of what they had <br/>
learned on their own, informally, from movies and humor and songs and conversations.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids could say &quot;I haven&#39;t learned anything, I need to take a course to <br/>
finally learn something,&quot; that might be more than just a choice among many <br/>
options.  It could be them NOT seeing options.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could this be similar to a child being brought up in a parent&#39;s <br/>
faith? Many kids will have beleived what they&#39;ve been brought up <br/>
in until there are challenges from the outside. At that point, one of <br/>
the ways kids reaffirm to themselves that the parent&#39;s values are <br/>
meaningful to them is to challenge them and test the other ideas <br/>
they are encountering.<br/>
<br/>
And while we say that learning happens naturally and all the <br/>
time, it may be that our kids need to experience what &quot;canned <br/>
learning&quot; is like to fully appreciate just how educated they are!<br/>
<br/>
One of the repeated comments I hear from moms with kids <br/>
who&#39;ve been exclusively homeschooled is that one or more of <br/>
their children feel they coudn&#39;t &quot;handle&quot; going to school like <br/>
regular kids. They almost feel that they are being raised at home <br/>
because they aren&#39;t &quot;good enough&quot; or &quot;capable enough&quot; for <br/>
school. This notion is reinforced when public schooled friends <br/>
talk about the heavy loads they bear and the importance of their <br/>
courses.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just wondering if our kids need not more <br/>
explanations about learning, but the concrete experience of <br/>
learning in the schoolish way to reaffirm to themselves the <br/>
choices we made on their behalf.<br/>

Marty thought that for a while, when he was 7 or 8.  He asked me if he was <br/>
home because he wasn&#39;t smart enough to go to school.  It must have been <br/>
something someone in the neighborhood had said, because I had early on assumed Marty <br/>
would want to go to school and would like it (for the sports, at least), but he <br/>
chose to stay home.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess I&#39;m just wondering if our kids need not more <br/>
<br/>
explanations about learning, but the concrete experience of <br/>
<br/>
learning in the schoolish way to reaffirm to themselves the <br/>
<br/>
choices we made on their behalf.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby found when he took Driver&#39;s Ed that the other kids were sloughing, pret<br/>
ty much, and doing the least required, while he was really interested!  But he <br/>
also knew he had the book at home (somewhere, lost in his room &lt;g&gt;) and COULD <br/>
have learned a lot of it on his own.  So he appreciated the whole week <br/>
(partly because of the novelty) while others did NOT (partly because it was eating <br/>
away their whole spring break, and was just more of the same school for them).<br/>
<br/>
Marty was really interested in the presentations at the Live & Learn <br/>
conference.  He had never heard people talk about unschooling that way.   Maybe that <br/>
was like being a native of a place and knowing it pretty well, but hearing some <br/>
visiting historian tell stories about the things all around you in ways you <br/>
didn&#39;t know others would see it.  Some of it&#39;s news to you, but the physical <br/>
landscape is totally familiar.<br/>
