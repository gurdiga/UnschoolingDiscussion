 </span></blockquote>  Hello Mary.  I didn&#39;t post the original message about the baking <br/>
soda and vinegar but couldn&#39;t help responding to your question &quot;isn&#39;t <br/>
this science too?&quot;.  YES, YES, YES!  probably chemistry? Sterling and I recently did the <br/>
erupting volcano thing - it&#39;s just vinegar and baking soda!  when you <br/>
first mix them together, they foam and bubble up causing it to <br/>
overflow the hole in the volcano mold, simulating the &quot;eruption&quot;.  <br/>
I lost count of how many times we had to make the volcano erupt that <br/>
day - Sterling was extremely fascinated by it.<br/>
When i first saw the other message, i had visions of Sterling using <br/>
the toilet bowl as a larger volcano model if he ever caught site of <br/>
anything bubbling in the toilet!  &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t know what the proportions would be for cleaning purposes <br/>
though.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794038030">Its definately science. I have a little book called &quot;The Vinegar Book&quot; by<br/>
Emily Thacker. It has recipes for all kinds of stuff, not just<br/>
housecleaning. You can get the book from Tresco Publishers (1-800-772-7285)<br/>
I think its about $10. There are lots of sites on vinegar here&#39;s one that<br/>
talks about a lot of different uses:  Vinegar<br/>
<br/>
As for the recipe I use, I just pour in a 1/2 cup of baking soda, let that<br/>
settle in and then pour in a 1/2 cup vinegar so that it bubbles. I let my dd<br/>
do the measuring and pouring so its not real exact. We have hard water<br/>
deposits so we let it bubble awhile and then she scrubs it with a brush and<br/>
repeats it as many times as she wants. I don&#39;t have to worry about it since<br/>
it isn&#39;t toxic:)<br/>
She wears gloves because they are neato;)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;Play at  every age is vitally important. Just think, if your kids<br/>
&gt; thought of life and<br/>
&gt; &gt; learning as play then everything would be fun, from cleaning the house<br/>
&gt; to going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; work to scrubbing the toilet (my dd thinks this is the most fun, she<br/>
&gt; wears  fun gloves and &gt;since we use baking soda and vinegar to clean<br/>
