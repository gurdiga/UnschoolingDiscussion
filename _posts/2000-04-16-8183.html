   I think you did a great job with your son!  My daughter is also shy at 11, <br/>
but she was terribly shy when she was younger.  I did just what you did - let <br/>
her know it is OK to be scared and we went to things anyway.  I never pushed <br/>
her and many times I was the only mom joining in and helping her find Easter <br/>
eggs etc.  But that was all right with me.  I realized that helping my <br/>
daughter learn to do things that scared her and keeping her self-esteem <br/>
intact were more important than me feeling a little foolish.  And sometimes I <br/>
did feel embarrassed that at 7 she still needed me to stay at birthday <br/>
parties with her - but then I would realize that it was only my ego that had <br/>
the problem thinking other moms were judging me or my daughter, and I learned <br/>
to let go of that.  Now my daughter is still shy in new situations, but much <br/>
better that she ever has been.  I think you need to continue to respect that <br/>
your son&#39;s feelings are OK and support him when he needs you and I think you <br/>
will be fine!   Jackie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418280941">Hi Jackie and Karen and other parents of shy kids,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s heartwarming to see parents who are so in-tune with and sensitive<br/>
to their children.  I think Jackie hit the nail on the head that often<br/>
it&#39;s us as parents who &quot;need to get a grip&quot;.  There are TONS of shy kids<br/>
out there so this has GOT to be completely normal behavior.  It&#39;s<br/>
typical social development for most of us.  And look how many adults<br/>
still struggle with some level of shyness and depend on a glass of wine<br/>
to get their courage up at gatherings etc...Pushing the issue, denying<br/>
it exists, lacking the understanding or humiliating a child only<br/>
exacerbates the situation.<br/>
