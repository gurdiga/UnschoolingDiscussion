<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414168978">To the NHEN Board,<br/>
<br/>
DoDEA (Department of Defense Educational Authority) is the governing<br/>
authority for all DoD military schools.  DoDDS (DoD Dependent Schools)  is<br/>
the governing authority for DoD schools overseas, and they fall under the<br/>
authority of DoDEA (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/index.htm)">http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/index.htm)</a>.<br/>
USAREUR (US Army Europe) is a separate command, and the lines of authority<br/>
are separate.  Think of DoDEA as the Board of Education for the military,<br/>
whereas USAREUR is doing the *job* of the *army* in Europe.   They both<br/>
report up the chain (up to the Secretary of Defense), and they meet with each<br/>
other formally, but neither one has authority over the other.<br/>
<br/>
This is my understanding of what&#39;s happening.  If anyone has a different<br/>
understanding, I would appreciate hearing about it so that we can resolve the<br/>
differences and arrive at a correct understanding.  Also, if any of my<br/>
terminology is incorrect, I would appreciate the correction.   I am basing my<br/>
understanding on discussions I have had personally with people within DoDEA,<br/>
web research and contacts in Germany.  I am the homeschooling spouse of an<br/>
Air Force officer.<br/>
<br/>
DoDEA is under pressure to develop policies allowing homeschoolers to receive<br/>
services from DoD schools.  HSLDA has been exerting this pressure via<br/>
congressional directives and, since the language in subsequent DoDEA policy<br/>
letters was not satisfactory, and because they wanted a standardized policy,<br/>
they found sponsors to introduce HR830.  This forced DoDEA to begin<br/>
considering the establishment of a home school task force, and the<br/>
discussions of establishing such have taken place at meetings of the Defense<br/>
Education Council (DEC).  The Dependents Education Council includes<br/>
DoDEA/DoDDS as well as command/regional/operational commanders (&quot;flag<br/>
officers&quot;), who, again, are in a separate chain of command from DoDEA.<br/>
<br/>
At least one regional commander, including USAREUR (General Jordan),<br/>
reportedly has had isolated bad incidents occur at one or more of their<br/>
bases, in which people claimed they were homeschooling, *or* they have base<br/>
commanders who are worrying along the lines of &quot;well, what if?.&quot;   Base<br/>
commanders are not typically any more savvy about or accepting of<br/>
homeschooling than your everyday Joe.  Thus, when the subject of providing<br/>
DoD school services to homeschoolers was raised, their concerns were seen as<br/>
potentially addressable, and the issue was raised &quot;how do we know they&#39;re<br/>
really educating their kids?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There exists a draft DEC report, which has yet to be approved by the DEC,<br/>
which reportedly contains recommendations for the establishment and conduct<br/>
of a home school task force to study homeschooling issues.  DoDEA personnel<br/>
have stressed to me that nothing has been approved yet, and that thus there<br/>
is no direction from the DEC for any sort of task force meetings to be taking<br/>
place.  In fact, in a recent meeting, DoDEA asked the DEC members to hold off<br/>
on any such meetings.  However, DoDEA cannot direct the DEC members to act or<br/>
not act, as the DEC members are not under the authority of the DoDEA.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that the questionnaires and school liaison meetings in Germany are<br/>
being driven by USAREUR, as an initiative of their own, related to but not<br/>
directed by the possible DEC action.  The USAREUR commander who apparently is<br/>
driving this, is the Deputy Commanding General, HQ USAREUR, General Jordan<br/>
(see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hqusareur.army.mil/htmlinks/cmdgrp.htm)">http://www.hqusareur.army.mil/htmlinks/cmdgrp.htm)</a>.  Also, a Dr. Perez<br/>
who is listed in a set of minutes from the European Schools Council as the<br/>
Education Director for USAREUR<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/esc0900.pdf)">http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/esc0900.pdf)</a> especially has been active<br/>
at school liaison officer meetings with homeschoolers in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell, the appropriate intended audience for a letter from<br/>
NHEN is, then, at this time, Dr. Perez, and probably General Jordan, even<br/>
though the letter would go to the school liaison officers.  The school<br/>
liaison officers, who are holding the focus group meetings, do not have<br/>
authority to work policy; they are (no offense) worker bees.  Perhaps<br/>
addressing it to the school liaison officers and sending courtesy copies to<br/>
Dr. Perez and General Jordan (or to General Jordan&#39;s Chief of Staff) would be<br/>
appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, The European Schools Council - European military commands<br/>
(including USAREUR) and DoDDS - evidently have established their own working<br/>
group, independent of DoDEA.  &quot;ESC recommended establishing a working group<br/>
with DoDDS to develop a home schooling policy for the Theater. This policy<br/>
will be sent to OSD for possible implementation throughout DoD&quot; (September<br/>
2000, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/esc0900.pdf)">http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/esc0900.pdf)</a>.   This should be<br/>
followed up, and it may be appropriate to send a courtesy copy to Mr. David<br/>
Labuhn, Chief of Staff, DoDDS-E (DoDDS Europe).<br/>
<br/>
I believe DoDEA has no desire to get involved with regulating homeschoolers.<br/>
To my understanding, they don&#39;t see themselves having the authority to do so.<br/>
  The regulations give them authority only within the military schools.  At<br/>
least one high-ranking DoDEA person has a close family member who has<br/>
homeschooled.  They are more concerned with their efforts to reform DoD<br/>
schools, measuring progress with the NAEP, standardizing curriculum across<br/>
the board in order to address transition issues, etc.  It is not an<br/>
environment in which homeschoolers should be making themselves an issue or a<br/>
target.  They are being pressured by congressional directives to standardize<br/>
policy for services to homeschoolers.  I think it would be *wise* to start<br/>
actively working against HR830 so that the pressure is taken *off* DoDEA.  I<br/>
think they&#39;d be glad not to have to go through this.<br/>
<br/>
It is troubling to me that members of HEART of Germany (an HSLDA-affiliated<br/>
group) apparently knew about the USAREUR efforts for weeks, and did not make<br/>
the information publicly known to the general homeschooling community.  I<br/>
wish I knew who has been controlling the flow of this information.<br/>
Nevertheless, now that it&#39;s come out into the open, I&#39;m glad that NHEN is<br/>
stepping forward to help make the entirety of the homeschooling community<br/>
visible to the military.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I have some background documentation and additional information which I&#39;ve<br/>
collected, which I will send in a separate email, after I&#39;ve made the<br/>
collection manageable.<br/>
