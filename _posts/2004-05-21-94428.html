Am I the only one who had SEX dreams while pregnant?  With the first kid I<br/>
had dreams that I wish to HADES I could have recorded.  They were so vivid,<br/>
so complete, that I wasn&#39;t entirely sure they hadn&#39;t happened when I woke<br/>
up.  Except that hubby was working nights, so he couldn&#39;t have been there!<br/>
<br/>
And I mean X rated, clear as a bell, and darned good, too.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, everyone tell me how weird that is, go ahead.   -sigh-  I&#39;m always the<br/>
odd ball out.<br/>

First pregnancy, I was more interested in sex than usual, and that was no <br/>
problem!<br/>
<br/>
Second, I was interested in sex, but had a baby.  Problem.  Had fantasies <br/>
even while I was asleep.  <br/>
<br/>
Third time, I wrote some down, wishing I&#39;d done it the second time.<br/>
<br/>
Have considered maybe, after the kids are grown,  getting some doctor to dose <br/>
me with whatever pregnant women are full of so I can become a famous author <br/>
of &quot;women&#39;s erotica&quot; (word porn).  I don&#39;t think it pays much, though, seein&#39; <br/>
as how people do it for free.   Oh well...   One of those temporary <br/>
hormone-induced career possibilities. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
No!  I had dreams about my BROTHER-IN-LAW when I was pregnant with my last <br/>
baby.  Ack!  The scary thing is it really made me wonder if there was <br/>
something I wasn&#39;t admitting to myself!  ROFL!!!  Everytime I&#39;d see him, I <br/>
felt like I was on fire.  It was so strange.  Once I stopped nursing, it all <br/>
ended completely.  But I didn&#39;t stop nursing, or rather Chloe stopped <br/>
nursing at 10 months so it took a LONG time.  Talk about feeling like a <br/>
complete loser and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it!<br/>
<br/>
Shameful what we admit sometimes, isn&#39;t it???<br/>

Yeah, I have a friend who came to the conclusion, during her third <br/>
pregnancy, that she could make a good income writing porn (under the <br/>
influence of the pregnancy hormones).<br/>
<br/>
Funny that this never gets talked about in polite society. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I personally had a big hormone surge around the age of 42.  Very <br/>
distracting, but fun.  Unfortunately it eventually tapered off.<br/>

PS  I wish I dreamt about sex more!  Regrettably I&#39;m still having <br/>
anxiety dreams about forgetting to do my math homework.  Bleeaahhh!</div>

It&#39;s funny, because I would have the nastiest fantasies while pregnant, and <br/>
as soon as the babies were born, I would be disgusted with myself or anyone <br/>
else who had ever thought anything so disgusting.  When the babies weaned I was <br/>
neutral about it again.  So it had to have been hormonally induced.  And I <br/>
probably couldn&#39;t make any money without that &quot;induction.&quot; &lt;bwg&gt; And wouldn&#39;t I be <br/>
disgusted with myself entirely as soon as I smelled a grandchild&#39;s head or <br/>
something?   Best to just stay off roller coasters, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
But I did learn alot about the power of hormone storms, and I try to remember <br/>
that when Kirby is having a season and is impatient with the rest of us.  <br/>
Marty has shorter ones, and I just try to give him the day or week he needs.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe how big these boys are, who were seven pound bitty things <br/>
once.  And hairy, and strong, and resourceful and reliable.   But they don&#39;t get <br/>
all that growth without some spurt-spurts.   And I wouldn&#39;t want them to grow <br/>
up without whatever manliness was theirs with the package.  But it can be <br/>
frustrating, and memories of the power of hormones on me more lately helped me be <br/>
calmer through it.<br/>
