<div id="ygrps-yiv-112964239">SORRY about not changing &quot;Weaning.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry.  A post which hasn&#39;t yet shown up is called &quot;weaning&quot; <br/>
because it was near the beginning of the discussion about whether Bible <br/>
literalism should change the way people feel about weaning babies... I <br/>
should&#39;ve changed it because my post was response to a question about WHERE <br/>
in the Bible it said Jesus was coming right back, everyone should just wait.</div>
