<div id="ygrps-yiv-573957246">*******This family is always doing �No eat this first� despite over a year of our fine example before them (sigh).******<br/>
<br/>
I find myself doing this a lot... I try not to, but it&#39;s so hard when it seems DD eats only breads and fried stuff.  With her severe constipation problems, I am afraid she&#39;ll never get straightened around if she never gets anything fiberous.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn goes to other&#39;&#39;s houses, do you tell her that other people have different rules and she has to listen to those rules?  (i.e. at home she can jump on the couch but at so-and-so&#39;s house she can&#39;t do that)  I ask because I wonder if this idea couldn&#39;t work the same with your two visitors, especially if their mom isn&#39;t there... &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-593966904">&lt;&lt;&lt;I find myself doing this a lot... I try not to, but it&#39;s so hard when it<br/>

<br/>
Does she like bacon? Have you tried &quot;Devils on Horseback&quot;? Pitted Prunes<br/>
wrapped in bacon (secure with wooden toothpick) and broiled or grilled (I<br/>
use my George Forman). Tastes like fried, lots of fiber. Don&#39;t eat too many<br/>
at once or you will have the opposite problem.<br/>
<br/>
Really though, I think all you can really do is explain to her about the<br/>
connection between fiber and comfort, and continue looking for a fresh fruit<br/>
that she likes, or a cereal, or maybe a Metamucil type product in a<br/>
smoothie?<br/>
<br/>
I have told Jayn, fairly simplistically, that fruit helps makes her poop<br/>
come out easily. I have found that if she ever has a movement that is pebble<br/>
like, she will look at it and say she needs to eat some fruit.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When Jayn goes to other&#39;&#39;s houses, do you tell her that other people<br/>
have different rules and she has to listen to those rules?  (i.e. at home<br/>
she can jump on the couch but at so-and-so&#39;s house she can&#39;t do that)  I ask<br/>
because I wonder if this idea couldn&#39;t work the same with your two visitors,<br/>
especially if their mom isn&#39;t there... &lt;BEG&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, we don&#39;t have rules, at least we don&#39;t ever express our requests to<br/>
Jayn in those terms. I guess we have a few &quot;habitual behaviors&quot; that we<br/>
pretty much always ask of Jayn, such as to wait for one of us to go down to<br/>
the pool with her, even if there is someone already swimming. Speaking to<br/>
other visitors to our home in terms of &quot;our house rules&quot; would feel<br/>
hypocritical to me, even though I am sure that other kids have a greater<br/>
understanding of what the word means than Jayn does. I usually say more like<br/>
&quot;I prefer you to....&quot; or &quot;That could be dangerous/disturbing to someone...&quot;<br/>
or &quot;Those things are not available today&quot; (for some toy that is put up).<br/>
<br/>
I must say that the vast majority of homes that we go to have a free and lax<br/>
attitude towards stuff like jumping on sofas, and mostly rules are<br/>
invisible. However there are places we go to where behavior standards are<br/>
different, usually public places. When forbidding and grumpy docents express<br/>
themselves in terms of &quot;It&#39;s The Rule Here&quot;, evidently expecting a reaction<br/>
of instant compliance because of that word, I find Jayn kind of looks at<br/>
them with a &quot;What&#39;s up your ass?&quot; expression (possibly one of Sandra&#39;s<br/>
cobs). I translate for her into our more gentle language. For example: &quot;They<br/>
don&#39;t want people to run in here because they are afraid people might fall<br/>
or run into each other or things and get hurt&quot;; &quot;They want everyone to keep<br/>
their socks on because it is more hygienic&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
When we visit someone&#39;s home Jayn generally takes her cue from the host<br/>
children. It has been a really long time since we have been to a home when<br/>
someone had some kind of stated rule. It was &quot;No food in the schoolroom&quot; (I<br/>
think you can see instantly why we have not ended up in a close ongoing<br/>
relationship with that family). I&#39;m afraid I was the person who didn&#39;t<br/>
realize that it was a &quot;RULE&quot; and that was why the little girl (they were<br/>
both just 2 at the time) was getting distressed. Also we had been to a party<br/>
when the kids specifically ate in the schoolroom set up for the purpose, so<br/>
I was confused.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t express anything to Jayn with the words, &quot;Their rule is...&quot;<br/>
Instead I say, &quot;So-and-so doesn&#39;t want you to ....&quot; Jayn will often ask<br/>
questions about why if someone makes a sweeping statement like &quot;We don&#39;t<br/>
....&quot;<br/>

I did this with Mia. Sometimes I&#39;ll hear her calling me and she will be<br/>
sitting on the toilet with an &#39;earnest&#39; look on her face and she&#39;ll say<br/>
&quot;Mummy, Can you please get me some fwoot? I weeally need some fwoot.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185797832">DD loves frozen blueberries or grapes. Something about freezing fruit <br/>
makes it more appealing to some kids who resist eating fruit. Also <br/>
drinking enough water is key. Maybe let kids drink out of a special or <br/>
unusual container to get them to drink more water?<br/>
<br/>
Also sometimes canned or jarred fruit (not baby food) like pineapple or <br/>
mandarin oranges are appealing because it&#39;s different from the everyday <br/>
apples and bananas. I think they even have exotic tropical fruits in <br/>
jars now, like mangoes and papayas.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m lucky, my DD LOVES fruits and veggies and we never have poop <br/>
problems. Lots of diaper changes, lol, but no problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166068334">I did the same thing with my kids. That fruit and veggies have <br/>
something called fiber in them, and that is what helps them poop. <br/>
Also that if they don&#39;t drink enough water, that can also make it <br/>
hard to poop. I have had similar &quot;bathroom conferences&quot; with both of  <br/>
my little ones. LOL<br/>
