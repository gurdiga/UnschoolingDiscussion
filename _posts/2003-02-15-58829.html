&gt; Interesting. My mom didn&#39;t care if I skipped as much as I wanted...I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t even live at home my senior year - lived on my own. In fact, I<br/>
&gt; skipped so much high school that they had the problem of figuring out<br/>
&gt; what to do with someone who had a 3.9 gpa but not enough days of<br/>
&gt; attendance to be allowed to graduate. (It was the 60&#39;s - school was<br/>
&gt; easy - there were a lot of other things to do and the beach was only a<br/>
&gt; few minutes away.)<br/>

&gt;&gt; I skipped school when I wanted to, too, with my parents support. That<br/>
&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t mean I was unschooled. Perhaps &quot;sometimes to often<br/>
&gt;&gt; non-schooled&quot;.<br/>

high school, I quit school at the end of my sophomore year, and took the GED<br/>
(I think it was still called the GED then &lt;g&gt;) the following autumn.<br/>
