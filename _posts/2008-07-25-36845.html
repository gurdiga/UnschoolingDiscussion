<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917283395">I have a couple of issues (though that doesn&#39;t really feel like the right<br/>
word).<br/>
<br/>
First, my youngest , Lilly (4.5) seems to need nearly constant engagement<br/>

My oldest never really wants to play with my youngest for whatever reason<br/>
(when asked she just says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;) even though Lilly practically begs<br/>
her to play on a daily basis. It seems like we are wearing pretty thin with<br/>
Lilly&#39;s need for constant engagement and we are all getting kindda grumpy<br/>
with each other. I can&#39;t seem to think of many other options really as we<br/>
are really strapped for money right now (so we don&#39;t have extra for classes,<br/>
etc). I don&#39;t know what to do so I wanted to bounce ideas of ya&#39;ll.<br/>

Second, Marti (just turned 8), seems to want to be electronically engaged<br/>
(lol) most of the day, which wouldn&#39;t be a problem except that about the<br/>
time that it is time to get off the computer (when it&#39;s time to go upstairs<br/>
so that Lil and I can go to bed because we are morning people) is when she<br/>
wants to talk to us, jump on the bed, get her exercise, say all her words<br/>
for the day and tell stories. I am at a loss here. By then I have already<br/>
been playing with Lilly all day and I am near exhausted. I have no energy<br/>
left for her, which isn&#39;t fair to her, but I don&#39;t know how to work<br/>
with/around it. I can&#39;t ask her to get off the computer. I invite her to do<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776448199">Sounds like you have similar dynamics in your household as I have in mine.  The book Raising Your Spirited Child was recommended to me by a loving friend and advisor.  I found it to be extremely helpful in understanding the differences in my children (and myself!).  One of the principles of the book is determining if your child is an introvert or extrovert, which are terms used to describe how a child gets her energy (as opposed to how we think of the word in terms of being outgoing or not).  It sounds like your younger daughter is an extrovert, and needs to be around other people to get her energy; whereas your younger daughter is an introvert who needs quiet time in order to recharge.  It is not uncommon for an introvert to unload all her thoughts at bedtime.  If that&#39;s the case with your older daughter, maybe you could work 15 or 20 minutes into your night time routine as her sharing time with you.  As for your younger daughter, I can sympathize with how draining she can be!  I found that if I participated in activities with my son (such as reading with him, or playing a game with him), he was pretty good at letting me have a little bit of quiet time (although he usually wants to be near me).  In any event, Raising Your Spirited Child is a pretty popular book, so you&#39;d probably be able to find it in your local library.  It did wonders for me.  I can&#39;t say it changed everything in our household, but it gave me insight into both of my children, and that alone was a gift! <br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497013279"><p>&nbsp;We often have similar moments, and after much much discussion (if the kids are feeling that interested, which is usually true), we end up researching more online. My kids (15,12 and 10) like to hear or read from as many sources as possible and then draw their own conclusion(s). They value my input, and what they can research. &nbsp;I have also discussed the ideas of truth or narratives or many points of view, and that science is ever-changing with them,so they really like input and then their own final analysis ( which I believe is critical thinking). So I do understand when Sandra says &quot;google it&quot; is not always the best answer, and I am more than willing to let things go per the kids interest level....more often than not, in our home, there is a very layered sort or research where everyone contributes, with the internet often playing a very significant role.</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1497013279ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1497013279ygrps-yiv-721827551">-=-<span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;I always&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">tell them that we should google it when we get home,-=-</span><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Don&#39;t do anything &quot;always.&quot;</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Some questions don&#39;t need google. &nbsp;They might need &quot;What do you think?&quot; or &quot;Who do you think would know things like that?&quot; or &quot;Do you think there&#39;s any way to really know that?&quot; or &quot;Maybe the answer is different in different places,&quot; or &quot;Maybe we can be on the lookout for more info about that.&quot;</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Or &quot;I used to think [this] about it, when I was a kid, but now I&#39;m not sure.&quot;</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">-=-</span><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Would you recommend carrying a small notebook to jot the questions down?-=-</span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Not if you&#39;re trying to drive. &nbsp;Not if it will keep you from speculation and conjecture and sharing what you do know, conversationally.</span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">If something comes up in a conversation and then it doesn&#39;t come up again later, that&#39;s fine. &nbsp;The tide comes in, leaves some stuff on the sand, and goes out; some things stay, some go back out. &nbsp;All of it still exists—the sand, the shells, the water—they&#39;re all still there, just rearranging a bit.</span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Sandra</span></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291869462">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Last time I wrote I got a lot to think about and the advice to just ask <br/>
some questions here. Now I&#39;m at a point I feel comfortable to do that.<br/>
I noticed a lot of things going on in my family (husband, son 3.5yr, <br/>
daughter 15 month and me) and I don&#39;t know how to resolve or handle them.<br/>
<br/>
First I finally understood we are all different from each other. We <br/>
share a household, food, money and time but we are different human <br/>
beings with different interests and personalities.<br/>
I know our children learn by watching us adults so I try to be a better <br/>
person every day.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m at a point where I just want to be myself. But myself isn&#39;t <br/>
always nice or thoughtful - even though I wish I were. How do or did you <br/>
handle this internal process? When I go over my limits a lot I start to <br/>
be a nasty, loud, unfair/accusing person. This hurts our relationships <br/>
and destroys any peaceful atmosphere in our home.<br/>
<br/>
I was very permissive before, saying &quot;yes&quot; without thought a lot (same <br/>
result as above). Now I have great difficulty in handling my son (3.5yr) <br/>
when he gets upset.<br/>
Really, I have a whole lot of difficulty to handle &quot;upset&quot; in any <br/>
person, including me. What has helped you?<br/>
<br/>
I read on breathing on Sandras page - it is wonderful, but often I&#39;m <br/>
still overwhelmed by my own feelings. I get scared and defensive when <br/>
someone is upset, I get aggressive and mean when I am upset. Not good at <br/>
all. How do whole, unhurt people handle upset?<br/>
Or feelings in general? I suppressed lots of feelings in my childhood, <br/>
so I don&#39;t really know how to express anything safely.<br/>
<br/>
I have some parenting questions as well, I know since my children aren&#39;t <br/>
school age I&#39;m technically not unschooling, but you give such mindful <br/>
advice, so I hope it&#39;s ok to ask here.<br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;m still confused about what the best approach is. (I notice, <br/>
that &quot;best&quot; is still schoolish thinking).<br/>
<br/>
I want my son to wear underpants (or even be fully clothed) at home <br/>
(even when it&#39;s just us 3 or 4 here). I know families who don&#39;t care <br/>
about that, I know families who are really strict about that. I <br/>
personally think it is a good idea for various reasons: i.e. being warm, <br/>
not showing genitals in everyones face.<br/>
Should I let him run around naked despite my feelings? My husband <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to care about our children being in underwear or clothed at <br/>
all - until they want to go out. But then he (husband) complains about <br/>
it, telling the children to go and dress themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I still help my son to get dressed when he wants or needs it - my <br/>
husband just tells him to do it. It&#39;s alwasy a conflict between them.<br/>
<br/>
How do you organize your day and home?<br/>
I dress the children in the morning (sometime, it depends; but underwear <br/>
is important to me from the start), we eat, we go places or do stuff at <br/>
home. I&#39;m available but not actively playing with them or offering them <br/>
stuff to do as long as they have or find things to do on their own.<br/>
Is this ok? (Yes, I really need some kind of assessment :( )<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy because at least I know and notice my schoolish thinking, me <br/>
need for approval, I didn&#39;t earlier and that I do now is thanks to your <br/>
help!<br/>
<br/>
When my husband is home I really hope (and need) to relax, but the <br/>
situation gets complicated as he wants the children to play and do what <br/>
he thinks is fun/interesting... although he is embracing the idea of <br/>
unschooling, he can&#39;t change his behaviour just now in all aspects.<br/>
I try to help him be offering options which he often declines. So I end <br/>
up telling him just what to do. I&#39;m aware our children listen and it is <br/>
these days our son tells his sister what to do or not to do most often.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is saying no a lot - instead of looking for options.<br/>
Is it okay if I offer my ideas, even tell him what to do? I feel bad <br/>
about telling other people what to do. I know if I stepped in and just <br/>
did everything my children want with them even though their dad is home <br/>
we wouldn&#39;t have those conflicts, tears and yelling. But they want their <br/>
dad! And I want my rest, so there&#39;s that.<br/>
<br/>
How can I rest alongside my children? Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Now my son is ill and he refuses to dress or stay in bed. How can I <br/>
handle that?<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670102429">On Oct 12, 2014, at 6:11 AM, awa <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:claire_oberon@...">claire_oberon@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now, I&#39;m at a point where I just want to be myself. But myself isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; always nice or thoughtful - even though I wish I were. How do or did you <br/>
&gt; handle this internal process? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I picked up through out your post is a need to control. A lot of what&#39;s rousing anger, frustration, irritation in you is a need for people to stop doing things that are bugging you.<br/>
<br/>
So I think when you say &quot;be myself&quot; what you mean is you want to stop stuffing down your feelings, stop pretending that something isn&#39;t bugging you. That&#39;s definitely a step away from feeling your feeling don&#39;t matter. But you want to keep moving to an even healthier place.<br/>
<br/>
The key to inner peace is working towards life not bugging you. The reason life is bugging you is that you&#39;ve been living in a world where you must choose between meeting your needs or other people&#39;s needs. But you grew up with the message that your needs aren&#39;t important. As you realize, all those years of stuffing down the feelings and needs doesn&#39;t make them go away. They just accumulate. They build up to the point where people wanting you to give more grows resentment. You want it to finally be your turn in life and for others to stop needing you.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not good either! <br/>
<br/>
Too many parents -- mothers especially -- either give and give and give then get silently resentful when people want more, or give and give and give then say, &quot;I&#39;m done taking care of you. I need a break.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A healthy place is where you can meet your needs AND others&#39; at the same time. Or meet your needs without taking from others.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if you&#39;re running low on energy while out doing errands, you don&#39;t wait until you&#39;re at your wits end, screaming for the kids to stop having needs. You stop when you first notice you need to stop. You stop where you can get some food or coffee AND where the kids can run around and get their needs met. Show your kids how people can take care of themselves AND keep others&#39; needs in mind at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
There are two authors people have recommended over and over. Start with these two books and browse through the comments. If they don&#39;t strike a chord, check a couple of their other books. I know Byron Katie&#39;s books have been translated into German. Your library might have them. If not, Amazon should. There&#39;s also the Kindle versions in English.<br/>
<br/>
Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life by Byron Katie<br/>

<br/>
The Dance of Anger: A Woman&#39;s Guide to Changing the Patterns of Intimate Relationships by Harriet Lerner<br/>

<br/>
Move towards a place where the Serenity prayer rings true for you:<br/>
<br/>
Grant me the Serenity<br/>
To accept the things I cannot change...<br/>
Courage to change the things I can,<br/>
And Wisdom to know the difference.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I go over my limits a lot I start to <br/>
&gt; be a nasty, loud, unfair/accusing person. This hurts our relationships <br/>
&gt; and destroys any peaceful atmosphere in our home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having little ones under 4 is draining. So moms will feel drained during those years.<br/>
<br/>
But going over your limits should be temporary, not standard. As you say, your children learn from you. If you&#39;re constantly doing more than you can, you&#39;re showing them that taking breaks and taking care of yourself isn&#39;t a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
The key, though, is, as I said above, to take breaks AND take care of their needs. <br/>
<br/>
Be more reasonable about what you can do in a day. (Of course babies and toddlers have big needs. They do grow less with time!)<br/>
<br/>
Working towards taking care of your needs while also being available for others will be a big step towards a lot of what you&#39;ve asked about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was very permissive before, saying &quot;yes&quot; without thought a lot (same <br/>
&gt; result as above). Now I have great difficulty in handling my son (3.5yr) <br/>
&gt; when he gets upset.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s also 3 which is an age of a big mental growth. It&#39;s when a lot of kids realize in a *big* way they can do things and the world will respond. Up until 3 the big people manipulated the world for them. The big people got the juice, turned on the lights, decided when it was time to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
At 3 kids realize they have the physical ability to manipulate their worlds. And they also realize they lack the power. Light switches are too high. Juice is in bottles too heavy to pour without spilling. Big people say no.<br/>
<br/>
What can help a lot is notice what he&#39;s trying to do that he still needs help with and find ways for him to do these things himself. You can put juice in washable containers so he can just grab it, for instance. But if he asks, do still get it for him. For many people they feel loved when someone is taking care of their needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want my son to wear underpants (or even be fully clothed) at home <br/>
&gt; (even when it&#39;s just us 3 or 4 here). I know families who don&#39;t care <br/>
&gt; about that, I know families who are really strict about that. I <br/>
&gt; personally think it is a good idea for various reasons: i.e. being warm, <br/>
&gt; not showing genitals in everyones face.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He knows when he&#39;s warm and cold. Don&#39;t decide that for him.<br/>
<br/>
As for wearing clothes in the house ... it *is* easier to let go of that. If you can&#39;t, a step towards it may be going with him to buy underwear or shorts or a costume that he loves. Let go of the struggle to make him wear clothes at home to your satisfaction. It will just make it that much harder to get clothes on him when he needs to go out. (One trick may have found useful is letting kids jump into the car in the pajamas and dressing in the car once they get where they&#39;re going. That may not work as well with naked kids ;-) )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But then he (husband) complains about <br/>
&gt; it, telling the children to go and dress themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would jump in before he complains. Don&#39;t wait for him to be the one who notices the kids still need to be dressed. <br/>
<br/>
He has some unreasonable expectations of what kids are capable of at 3. But it will strain your relationship if you fight about it. You might mention that getting dressed is still new to your son so it still feels like a huge hard task. But let go of your husband understanding.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When my husband is home I really hope (and need) to relax, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That isn&#39;t a reasonable hope when your kids are so young. It&#39;s great if you can help it happen! It will feel disappointing if you *expect* it to happen, or you hold onto the idea that you *need* it to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Will you die if your husband doesn&#39;t take over the kids? No. Would it be nice so you could sit back and relax? Yes, of course! :-) But in the long run, it will feel even more draining if you need and expect to have that time to relax. It will be less draining if you&#39;re taking care of your needs all day long. Take a *second* here and there to take a deep breath. Sit down with the kids and watch TV. Sit down and have some coffee while the kids play at the play ground. Or hover nearby while you take deep calming breaths. Look out the window at a pretty scene. Take *moments* throughout your day to refresh. It will set yourself up for disappointment to expect a big chunk of time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husband is saying no a lot - instead of looking for options.<br/>
&gt; Is it okay if I offer my ideas, even tell him what to do?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you want him to tell you want to do? Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
Let him find his own way. But also be more aware of escalating needs. Take care of the needs in a calmer way *before* he builds up to irritation.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594079543">Maybe each time you&#39;re going to be with your mom, you and your son could brainstorm one or two or three things to say that are positive.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it will result in a more positive response.  If so, that&#39;s a success!<br/>
<br/>
But the positive thing he decides to say, or the pretty thing he shows her or the soft cloth he puts on her, or the soothing music, or beautiful photo.... that MUST add more positivity to the situation. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe (though it seems harsh as I think about it) you could keep a list of those positive ideas, and of her reactions to them.   <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could have a little &quot;shake it off&quot; ceremony/moment/action when you leave her place or room, to symbolically move back into a more positive world together.<br/>

I&#39;ve learned to do that for them and for myself. &nbsp;It feels better to me &nbsp;to be the positive influence, rather than dwelling too much on their negativity. &nbsp;They&#39;re both getting old now. &nbsp;They&#39;re in their late 80s. &nbsp;Ethan watches me with them. &nbsp;He hears their words and sees their actions, and has my own words and actions to measure that experience against. &nbsp;If he has questions, he asks, but I don&#39;t spend a lot of time talking about things. &nbsp;I keep it simple. &nbsp;I give him room to come to his own conclusions.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;">My dad likes to call the television &quot;the idiot box&quot; for example. &nbsp;Ethan thought that was really funny and copied him a couple/few times back at home. &nbsp;I let it go the first time. The second or third time, I asked him if he thought grandpa was an idiot for watching tv. &nbsp;He said no. I asked him why he thought grandpa called it that if he enjoyed watching it. &nbsp;He didn&#39;t have an answer. &nbsp;I said I didn&#39;t either, except that there&#39;s a lot of negativity floating around with regards to tv watching. &nbsp;I said I thought it was kind of sad that grandpa saw his own experience with something he enjoys that way. &nbsp;He thought about that, I think. He&#39;s never referred to the tv in that way again. &nbsp;That was his choice. &nbsp;I did not tell him not to call the television an idiot box, though I have to admit I did cringe internally a bit. &nbsp;I think he came to that choice on his own by evaluating where he fit into what he&#39;s experienced in his own life thus far. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;">He doesn&#39;t always make the nicer choice. &nbsp;Neither do I. &nbsp;That&#39;s okay. &nbsp;He does pretty darn well for his age in my opinion. &nbsp;I do too. &nbsp;;-) &nbsp;I respect him and trust that he&#39;ll continue to learn to live in the world in a way that respects his beliefs. &nbsp;I also hope he&#39;ll continue to learn to leave enough room for others to do the same.</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygroups-quoted"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210"><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210yiv1338347068"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210yui_3_16_0_1_1413221308392_8914"><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);" id="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210yui_3_16_0_1_1413221308392_8913"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210yiv1338347068"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210yiv1338347068yui_3_16_0_1_1413221308392_7136"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210yiv1338347068yui_3_16_0_1_1413221308392_7135" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210yiv1338347068yui_3_16_0_1_1413221308392_5364" style="font-size:16px;"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210yiv1338347068yui_3_16_0_1_1413221308392_5363" style="font-size:16px;"><br clear="none"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><style type="text/css">#ygrps-yiv-1836769585 #ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210 #ygrps-yiv-1836769585ygrps-yiv-527196210yiv1338347068    --

Even at 57 I had a real tough time throwing away some ratty stuffed animals. That feeling didn&#39;t warp me too badly ;-) Maybe that feeling is what prompted animistic spiritual beliefs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966280208">I just had another thought for the boy. &nbsp;Ethan used to love Garfield comics. &nbsp;I think over the course of a couple of years he read nearly every one of them. &nbsp;He has more than 18 volumes and he would read them every night to himself and with either Doug or me. &nbsp;Currently, he enjoys the show &quot;Bob&#39;s Burgers&quot; which has a similar mischievous feel but is more mature in content. Maybe exploring some of the phrases and attitudes of his grandmother in a comical way would give him and outlet for experiencing that, and some relief from feeling so disappointed with himself. &nbsp;I know for Ethan, he will laugh and laugh at the antics of characters he would never (or at least very rarely) attempt to imitate.<div><br></div><div>Karen James. &nbsp;</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989780612">I&#39;m quite in sympathy with the perspective you&#39;ve shared, Karen. It sounds like we had similar experiences growing up. I was a highly sensitive, conscience-driven child, a real people pleaser and peace-maker, and my parents expectations (and therefore my own of myself) were unreasonably high. As a result, I grew up with a tendency to feel guilt way out of proportion to whatever wrong I committed, and that reflex followed me well into adulthood and messed up my early parenting by prompting me to set my expectations too high for myself and children, and not being able to feel patience and compassion for my and their imperfections.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Unschooling, and more to the point deschooling, has helped a lot with this. But I would not encourage a sensitive child, who typically shows himself to be caring and sweet, to be hyper-vigilant about his every word and tone, or focused on analyzing and judging his every word and deed for its acceptability. So, if I were standing in line and my 12 yo was wondering what&#39;s taking so long, I might make up possible scenarios that are sympathetic to the people in front of us, or else look around for a place for him to sit down, or give him my phone to take pictures or play games, etc.. I would not call him out for his feelings or his expression of them unless he was being notably rude. And I wouldn&#39;t encourage a habit of him replaying and second-guessing his every&quot;negative&quot; thought or word.<div><br></div><div>It may be that I&#39;m reading more into this particular situation than what&#39;s really there, but the son being so often &quot;disappointed&quot; in himself, combined with the mom&#39;s statement of her &quot;hoping though that we can find a way that he does not change&quot; [from his previous perpetually cheerful, positive self] sounds like a lot of pressure on a young soul to only EVER be kind and sweet...in other words, to NEVER make a mistake. That doesn&#39;t sound healthy to me, either.</div></div></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I was having thoughts along this same line.&nbsp; I was raised to always be 
nice and &quot;if you can&#39;t say anything nice then don&#39;t say anything at all&quot;.&nbsp; 
Being nice is not always the most appropriate response in all situations.&nbsp; 
It&#39;s something I&#39;ve spent a lot of years trying to decipher the nuance of.&nbsp; 
I was taught, intentionally or not, that unhappy feelings and thoughts were 
unacceptable &amp; unwelcome.&nbsp; I internalized that to believe that I was 
bad to have&nbsp;emotions or thoughts that weren&#39;t happy and pleasant.&nbsp; 
This caused me to push down thoughts and feelings that did not fit into this 
narrow band of accepted emotions.&nbsp; It is still a subject that is quite 
confusing to me.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987468019">*** sounds like a lot of pressure on a young soul to only EVER be kind and sweet ***<br/>
<br/>
I think people who were criticized for their words as children are letting their own sensitivities color what&#39;s written here.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s &quot;not okay&quot; to say something unkind, do you really think it would be suggested here to correct and shame a child each time he fails at being kind?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you think the idea that it&#39;s &quot;not okay&quot; to be unkind is triggering memories of your parent&#39;s reactions to your words so that you&#39;re imagining that&#39;s what&#39;s being said?<br/>
<br/>
If an idea is &quot;not okay&quot; that means don&#39;t model it. If an idea is &quot;not okay&quot; that means when kids don&#39;t realize it&#39;s not okay, to let them know, to help them understand. That goes for any idea that&#39;s not okay. Grabbing. Touching in a way that others don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
Kids should stop saying &quot;slowpoke&quot; and such because it *feels* wrong, not because mom makes them stop. <br/>
<br/>
And it will feel wrong if mom doesn&#39;t say such words. It will feel wrong if mom gives a child feedback that he&#39;s being unkind *when he doesn&#39;t realize it.*<br/>
<br/>
BUT if a child is being deliberately unkind, then there&#39;s some deeper issue involved. It won&#39;t be fixed by making the child use kind words. <br/>
<br/>
Except for the child who is noticing his own unkindness and *asking* for help to stop saying unkind words.<br/>

I respond to people in a nice manner. Even if they are rude, I act politely. My son and I have often discussed it, and I ask him to think about what are one&#39;s choices when met with someone who is not acting nicely. &nbsp;I do believe he chooses to be nice and chooses the option that makes others feel good. &nbsp;We volunteer at an adult day care center, and he enjoys doing this because he knows that he is helping others feel good. Just being the lovely young man he is will put a smile on someone&#39;s face, and he has learned that when he helps others, it feels good to him inside.</span></font></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1400991805yiv4871149030" dir="ltr" id="ygrps-yiv-1400991805yiv4871149030yui_3_16_0_1_1413748451622_13137"><font face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.8599996566772px;"><br clear="none"></span></font></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1400991805yiv4871149030" dir="ltr" id="ygrps-yiv-1400991805yiv4871149030yui_3_16_0_1_1413748451622_13137"><font id="ygrps-yiv-1400991805yiv4871149030yui_3_16_0_1_1413748451622_174646" face="Georgia" size="2"><span id="ygrps-yiv-1400991805yiv4871149030yui_3_16_0_1_1413748451622_174645" style="line-height:15.8599996566772px;">We have a little bee that we call &quot;BEE=lieve&quot; and we have him, among other things, to be a reminder of my son&#39;s &nbsp;inner voice that asks him to be his best self . &nbsp;He was writing a poem about himself, and when asked to pick an adjective that best described himself, he chose nice.
