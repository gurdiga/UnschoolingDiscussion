<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144723540">Hi Johanna,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a brief introduction to TCS theory:<br/>
<br/>
TCS - Taking Children Seriously<br/>
NCP - Non Coercive Parenting<br/>
CPP - Common Preference Parenting<br/>
<br/>
These are the terms (and their acronyms) that I have seen used to<br/>
describe<br/>
the same philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
TCSBabiesToddlers intro (yahoogroups):<br/>
<br/>
     TCS (Taking Children Seriously) is an educational philosophy and a<br/>
     way of life in which both parents and children take one another<br/>
     seriously by finding/creating real solutions to problems --<br/>
     solutions everyone involved prefers -- rather than imposing their<br/>
     will on one another.<br/>
<br/>
Common-Preference-Parenting intro (yahoogroups):<br/>
<br/>
     The Common-Preference-Parenting community is a forum for anyone who<br/>
<br/>
     believes that children should be raised through reason and<br/>
     compassion rather than force or control. In an effort to avoid<br/>
     coercing our children (and ourselves), we strive to find and/or<br/>
     create &quot;common preferences&quot;: solutions to problems that *all*<br/>
     parties prefer and are completely happy with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From the TCS website:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     TCS is a theory about what to do in the face of conflict. Building<br/>
     family relationships based entirely on consent, rather than<br/>
     coercion, seems to us to be the only approach that offers a<br/>
     solution to the problem of conventional coercive child-rearing. The<br/>
<br/>
     problem? People get hurt. As a result of this hurt people are<br/>
     unable or less able to solve problems in their lives. The idea of<br/>
     people hurting each other is, according to conventional wisdom,<br/>
     part of everyday life. But we think it is caused by people devoting<br/>
<br/>
     their ingenuity to hurting each other and thwarting one other&#39;s<br/>
     attempts to solve anything. TCS non-coercive educational theory is<br/>
     a way of addressing such problems wholesale, by setting up a<br/>
     different framework in which they can be solved more easily.<br/>
<br/>
           ...TCS represents a profound criticism of prevailing theories<br/>
<br/>
     of education and parenting, and provides a positive alternative.<br/>
<br/>
           ...TCS is characterized by a style of decision making that<br/>
     bypasses coercion in favour of finding common preferences<br/>
     (unanimous consent). With the TCS approach, children spend their<br/>
     childhoods without anyone making them do things against their will<br/>
     or anyone doing things to them against their will.<br/>
<br/>
           TCS rejects the discipline is an expression of love dogma<br/>
     that permeates conventional coercive parenting. Feeling love for<br/>
     another person does not confer the right to act towards them in a<br/>
     way that would be wrong if you did not love them. Love is no<br/>
     justification for tyranny.<br/>
<br/>
     TCS also provides the theory behind the practice that allows<br/>
     parents to persevere in the face of difficult situations where they<br/>
<br/>
     would otherwise be tempted to choose coercion.<br/>
