Re: Immunizations<br/>
My mother refused to immunize/vaccinate all four of her children (of which I <br/>
am the second). I wonder if people thought she was nuts?  My mother told me <br/>
(repeatedly!) about little boys and girls who got Polio from vaccination <br/>
shots,<br/>
 and how lucky I was that she didn&#39;t take that chance with me. It didn&#39;t <br/>
really mean anything to me then.<br/>
  <br/>
  I grew up healthy, of course. When I got married I got a rubella shot, per <br/>
 doctor&#39;s orders to &quot;protect my unborn children.&quot; When I had my children, <br/>
they <br/>
 were both immunized along the usual &quot;schedule&quot; per my pediatrician. Funny <br/>
 thing, though. I remembered my mother&#39;s stories about polio and insisted <br/>
that <br/>
 my children only get the &quot;inactive&quot; polio virus - despite the pediatrician <br/>
 insisting that it isn&#39;t as &quot;effective.&quot; I had to explain that I had never <br/>
 been immunized as a child and therefor ran the risk of getting polio from my <br/>
 now-vaccinated child if they gave him/her the &quot;active&quot; virus.<br/>
    <br/>
  Re: Handwriting<br/>
  My grandmother had the most beautiful, delicate handwriting I have ever <br/>
seen.<br/>
  She wrote so slowly and carefully - it was almost art. I, on the other had, <br/>
 having learned &quot;cursive&quot; in p.s., and being a person who writes constantly <br/>
in <br/>
 journals, letters, reports, essays, etc., now  &quot;cursive&quot; exactly two words: <br/>
 Melissa and Williams - my signature. That&#39;s it. My &quot;handwriting&quot; is printing <br/>
 and it&#39;s damn nice, too. <br/>
  <br/>
  I print because it&#39;s faster, easier, better-looking and no one gives a <br/>
rat&#39;s-<br/>
 butt if I use cursive. I&#39;ve never heard of &quot;Calvert Script&quot; and think I <br/>
would <br/>
 laugh at the guy who insisted my kid used it. Handwriting is nice to know, <br/>
 IMO, because people still use it and you might want to be able to read it <br/>
now <br/>
 and then (especially in a letter from your awesome grandmother!). Although, <br/>
I <br/>
 suppose everyone has to have a &quot;signature&quot; for security reasons on checks <br/>
and <br/>
 the like, right?  I will say this, though, it drives me crazy to read things <br/>
 from people who can&#39;t spell very well (postings on this list excluded, of <br/>
 course &lt;g&gt;). I am a big proponent of learning to spell, not necessarily of <br/>
 learning cursive. My dad (in his late 50&#39;s now and one of the most <br/>
 intelligent guys I know) spells phonetically. No kidding. He is the <br/>
president <br/>
 of a large corporation and writes/speaks fluently but stinks at spelling. <br/>
 Hmmm.<br/>

  Re: Gifted Labels<br/>
  O.k., here it is: you are at this moment reading a posting from a &quot;gifted&quot; <br/>
 child. Taught myself to read at age 3, learned to write by age 4, labeled <br/>
&quot;Gifted&quot; by <br/>
 the time I walked through the Kindergarten door. By the 6th grade I tested <br/>
at the 14th grade (2nd year college) level in all areas but math (I only hit <br/>
11th grade there). <br/>
  <br/>
 Now, here I am (some years later) -- average. You know how new moms compare <br/>
their babies by saying &quot;mine walked at 8 months&quot; and &quot;mine walked at 15 <br/>
months?&quot; but when they are 5 y.o. you can&#39;t tell who walked first? That&#39;s me. <br/>
I read first, wrote first, <br/>
 finished first, spelled better, computed better, comprehended better - and <br/>
 now, I&#39;m a regular Joe (well, Jane, anyway). I don&#39;t think you could ever <br/>
 tell I was &quot;gifted&quot; in school.<br/>
  <br/>
  My point (you knew there had to be one coming, eh?): IMO, Labels on our <br/>
kids are only useful for people who don&#39;t know them and need a way to &quot;box&quot; <br/>
them and &quot;categorize&quot; <br/>
 them. I know my children (and myself) very well. I don&#39;t need to label them <br/>
 for anyone. In the end, school-years labels are useless in real life.<br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks for listening.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Melissa, you summed it all up for me too!  I can remember my grandma being so <br/>
excited when I was 5 years old and tested into the &quot;gifted&quot; program at <br/>
school.  She told EVERYONE.  I actually think in many ways, she felt it was <br/>
more her achievement than mine.  I, like you, am a regular Jane today!  So <br/>
much for labels.  In fact, I as a 5 year old, I tested average in language <br/>
arts and &quot;gifted&quot; in math and sciences.  However, by the time I graduated HS, <br/>
I was in honors Spanish IV, honors German III, honors English, and honors <br/>
World History.  However, I barely scraped though Geometry and Chem. I - I <br/>
hated math and science classes!  Go figure!<br/>
    I do have to recall one fond memory though.  Throughout, elementary <br/>
school, I had a dear woman named Mrs. Melton for my &quot;gifted and talented&quot; <br/>
class (as they called it back then!).  I know this woman was an unschooler at <br/>
heart!  For two glorious hours everyday, I had the privilege of being in her <br/>
classroom and I don&#39;t think I ever had an &quot;assignment.&quot;  There were many <br/>
learning opportunities -- animals (fish, birds, turtles, hamsters, mice, <br/>
rats), puzzles, books, logic games, art supplies, etc., and we were <br/>
encouraged to use any of them we wanted.  At any given time, you could look <br/>
around our classroom and see close to a dozen different projects in progress <br/>
-- everyone working on their own interests.  And she was much more a <br/>
facilitator than a teacher.  I do not recall here ever standing before the <br/>
class teaching.  She would walk around from project to project, observing and <br/>
encouraging.  Even when we asked her questions, she seemed to never really <br/>
answer them for us.  Instead, she would gather other students around and ask <br/>
questions such as, &quot;What might be another way we could get such-and-such <br/>
result . . .&quot;  She was a truly wonderful educator, and most likely the <br/>
salvation of my ps education.  What sweet memories I have of her!<br/>

I just had to respond to this as someone involved in special education and<br/>
disability resources. Labeling also gives us a common ground in which to begin<br/>
discussing an issue. Without labels, how could we begin to look at solutions for<br/>
a situation? Even unschooling is a label and it allows us to see were we have<br/>
common grounds. A label like gifted, or spirited, or mentally retarded, or<br/>
physically disabled gives us a starting point in how to assess the persons needs<br/>
and how to assist that person. Assessment and assistance are also necessary evils<br/>
and we are all continually assessing each other. Every time you look at your<br/>
child and say, &quot;wow, she can do that&quot;, or &quot;why is my child not doing this yet?&quot;<br/>
you are assessing. Specialists and special education have just institutionalized<br/>
it and made it obvious. It is different, though, to be opposed to the<br/>
institutionalization of something than to the labeling of something. I am opposed<br/>
to the way special education is run in our ps system, and even how labeling has<br/>
effected the government subsidy programs, but I am not against labeling in<br/>
general and find it to be quite useful in most circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Labeling is a double-edged sword, but there is no way of getting around it, it is<br/>
part of everyone&#39;s life whether or not they are aware of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589693653">Lisa,  You make a really important point here.  Thank you for offering this<br/>
perspective.  Meybe we could look at labels as a type of tool to help us<br/>
cope with another person&#39;s (usually a child in this discussion) &#39;situation&#39;.<br/>
Most of the negative on labels comments seem to refer to cases where the<br/>
tool is used incorrectly,   the tool is not &#39;put away&#39;  after its use is<br/>
finished,  and/or the person using the &#39;tool&#39;  can&#39;t seem to remember that<br/>
there is a person to deal with,   not just a label.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578507454">And for an additional  $ .02.....labels also have to do with power and the ways<br/>
in which those with power maintain it.  Labels are used to control people and how<br/>
people think about different issues.  It is a multi-edged sword.  Who gets to<br/>
determine when the label has been used &quot;incorrectly&quot;.  I am most suspicious of<br/>
labels created by &quot;professionals&quot; which imo more often than not are used to<br/>
protect the turf of the professionals and only coincidentally communicating what<br/>
might or might not be useful information.<br/>
<br/>
The guild lives!  As a union activist I have such mixed feelings and thoughts on<br/>
the specialization of language that serves both to protect &quot;jobs&quot;  and to keep<br/>
the &quot;masses&quot; mystified.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that someone has mastered the complicated language of, for example<br/>
medicine, law, or education ( and perhaps even understanding the underlying<br/>
concepts which that language purports to represent) does not make them better<br/>
suited to make decisions for me.  However most people seem quite confused about<br/>
this. They repeatedly allow &quot;credentialed&quot; individuals to make decisions for them<br/>
rather than using these folks for the specialized knowledge they might have.<br/>
<br/>
And it all returns to issues of power.  Thems thats gots it and thems that don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I lied it was $.05 worth.<br/>

worth a damn.  I used to work there as an administrative assistant, and I<br/>
know exactly what his work looks like when it gets to his secretary to<br/>
proof and send, and what his interoffice scribbled notes look like.  Not<br/>
only is his spelling atrocious, but you need to be fluent in sanskrit to<br/>
decipher his handwriting.  This is a man who loves books and the printed<br/>
word, reads a LOT,and is very well educated.  This does not translate into<br/>
writing or language skills.  He is a people person, and that is where he<br/>
excells, in business anyhow.<br/>
