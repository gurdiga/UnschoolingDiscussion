<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579132606">Kind of an interesting question-but I really want to know how old he is. On <br/>
the reading backwards, I would just tell him that it reads the other <br/>
way-pronounce it backwards and forwards and laugh at how silly the words <br/>
sound when you say them backwards. Show him words like racecar and bob that <br/>
are the same either way-what are they called?<br/>
<br/>
Is he the kind of kid who doesn&#39;t like to be corrected? When my Megan was <br/>
little and put her shoes on the wrong feet, it was okay if I said &quot;other <br/>
foot&quot; but if I said &quot;wrong foot&quot; she would get mad. If he is really young, I <br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t worry a bit about how he spells things. Its cool that he <br/>
is into the idea that the letters make words and he wants to play with them. <br/>
It might be fun to make signs to hang all over the house together-if you <br/>
make them out of construction paper and glue on some yarn and let him hang <br/>
them or tape them on to everything-your house will be fun with labels on the <br/>
doorknobs and the lamps and the furniture! We used to play a game in the car <br/>
where we would take turns finding something that started with each letter of <br/>
the alphabet while driving to town. Its a fun way to get the letter sounds <br/>
down. You could even do it with the signs-one time make it to find an A at <br/>
the beginning of a word on a sign, next time make it A at the end, or <br/>
middle.<br/>
<br/>
Letter bingo is fun-we made all of our cards out of empty graham cracker <br/>
boxes and when the kids got bigger we changed to word bingo.<br/>
<br/>
Jenny has a living book on the computer of Dr. Suess&#39;s ABC&#39;s-It doesn&#39;t take <br/>
long to recognize that the A&#39;s are all at the beginning of the words when <br/>
they light up while saying Aunt Annies Aligator A A A-this is a really fun <br/>
cd-we all play with it!<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am feeling is that your kid is showing an interest and some <br/>
enthusiasm for letters, so instead of correcting him, make games that <br/>
involve letters, read books and notice the letters, write words, notice <br/>
words. Play with words and they will come alive to him and he will enjoy the <br/>
lessons and beg for more!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey guys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My son, Monk, has lately been very interested in how things are spelled.<br/>
&gt;His new thing is to point into the air and say stuff like &quot;yrdq...that<br/>
&gt;spells DOG!&quot; And right now he is putting his magnetic letters on the<br/>
&gt;floor and saying &quot;That spells GO!&quot; and the letters ar like &quot;yao&quot; or<br/>
&gt;something. He knows all of his letters, but he doesn&#39;t know how to spell<br/>
&gt;yet. My question for the group is how to approach this. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt;correct him, because I feel that might be discouraging, but I&#39;m afraid<br/>
&gt;if I let him continue to spell things wrong, he will think he&#39;s right.<br/>
&gt;What would you do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Gotta go...he just spelled the word &quot;Chair&quot; (antyooohtrszgh...that<br/>
&gt;spells CHAIR!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OH, another thing is that he reads the words backwords. Like when he<br/>
&gt;sees a sign, he reads the letters backwards. For instance, riding in the<br/>
&gt;cart at Target, he spelled &quot;TEGRAT...what does that spell, mama?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Should I just relax and let him do his thing? argh!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890549773">Hi;<br/>
<br/>
I can address what I&#39;ve done with my own daughter and the spelling<br/>
issue...it&#39;s all worked out very well in our favour.  She&#39;s 8 and is now<br/>
writing.  It all started about a year ago when she would do her version<br/>
of spelling much like you describe with Monk.  It motivated her to take<br/>
an interest in words and writing and eventually she discovered that<br/>
there was a proper way to spell (mostly on her own, as I read to her she<br/>
started recognizing some words on the page).  I think it&#39;s a creative<br/>
and positive thing that Monk is &quot;trying&quot; to spell and is taking an<br/>
interest in words.  Allow him to take his time with spelling.  It&#39;s<br/>
amazing what can come of &quot;child&#39;s play&quot;!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524238140">My son does this, and when he types &quot;qwerty&quot; and says, &quot;I wrote &#39;Brian!&#39;&quot; I <br/>
say &quot;WOW!&quot; or sometimes I&#39;ll say &quot;it looks like &#39;kwertee&#39; to me,&quot; but when he <br/>
writes something or spells it correctly, I say, &quot;that&#39;s right!&quot; and repeat <br/>
the word.<br/>
<br/>
When he reads stuff the wrong direction, I do point out that we read this <br/>
(from left to right) way. In the cart, he may be looking at the word upside <br/>
down also, so you might point that out to him.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably a pretty brief stage, since he&#39;s exhibiting a lot of <br/>
pre-reading skills, including interest.<br/>

<br/>
I would have to agree with Cathie. My son is 5.5yo and he writes his <br/>
name: SOHJUA (Joshua) He knows his name when he sees it he just <br/>
doesn&#39;t write it in the correct order. I used to try to correct him <br/>
as well. He would be so disappointed that what I saw was what he did <br/>
wrong that now I just praise him for getting the right letters on the <br/>
paper. He&#39;s only 5.5 and at least he knows the letters of his name <br/>
and can recognise his name when he sees it. I guess it is one of <br/>
those prewriting skills that they go through. Kinda like when all <br/>
they want is to do the same puzzle over and over and over and over <br/>
and over and...mom has to do it with them till she&#39;s ready to pass <br/>
out from her brain being understimulated for too long. I would let <br/>
him express  himself in his own way and when he is ready it will <br/>
click with him that there is a correct order to the letters and that <br/>
each letter has a sound. If you really wanted to you could do some <br/>
phonics work with him. He might pick up on it quicker but I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
make a big deal about  it. Oh, I also wanted to say that when I read <br/>
to my son I follow my finger under the words. When he reads to me <br/>
whether he is paraphrasing or telling his own story he follows his <br/>
finger the same way so he understands that we read from left to <br/>
right. He just hasn&#39;t made it click with writing words. In fact it <br/>
just hit me that when we play Boggle, Jr. he spells the words in the <br/>
correct order and then points to each letter and spells the word out <br/>
loud and then reads the word out loud using his finger under each <br/>
letter as he says the word. He just doesn&#39;t get it with  writing. Oh <br/>
well, it will come. Corallyn</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list so I don&#39;t know how old Monk is.  My daughter, Haley, is <br/>
almost 4 and she&#39;s been doing some of the same things.  I don&#39;t correct her, <br/>
either.  Instead, I asked her if she wanted to learn how to read, and she <br/>
said yes.  I don&#39;t really intend on teaching her how to read at this age, but <br/>
I suggested to her that we start with the sounds the letters make.  So, as <br/>
we&#39;re reading books, I&#39;ve been pointing out letters and the sounds they make. <br/>
 (&quot;Here&#39;s the letter P in the word &quot;pocket&quot;.  P makes the puh, puh, puh <br/>
sound.  What other words have the P sound?  Pig, peanut, pizza?)  She seems <br/>
very happy with this.  <br/>
<br/>
She has also &quot;read&quot; words from right to left, too.  I&#39;ve just gently told her <br/>
that when we read words we start on the left, and I often run my finger under <br/>
the words of picture books as we&#39;re reading them so she&#39;ll get used to <br/>
tracking that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185014229">Hi Lainie,<br/>
I think just the fact that he is showing an interest in reading and spelling<br/>
is wonderful, do not crush that by correcting him!  Encourage it!  When he<br/>
spells cvhsdlfj and tells you it spells cat, say GREAT, cat!  There is<br/>
plenty of time for him to learn it the right way and right now his curiosity<br/>
and enthusiasm for learning is all that counts!  When you are reading<br/>
together, he will eventually connect the letters to the sounds. Reading to<br/>
your son is the best way to teach him reading and spelling!  There are some<br/>
excellent books out there that help this process.  The Cat-in-the-hat books<br/>
by Dr. Seuss are good books to start with, they have words that are not in<br/>
the English language that make the child stop and think about the word and<br/>
make a connection in the brain.  They help immensely!  Just relax and let it<br/>
happen!<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did when my girls were smaller was to help them sound out a word<br/>
while reading it to them.  For example I would point to the &#39;C&#39; and say<br/>
&quot;ku&quot;, then the &#39;A&#39; and say &quot;ah&quot; then the &#39;T&#39; and say &quot;tuh&quot; and then slowly<br/>
put it all together, &quot;ku-ah-t&quot; and then &quot;cat&quot;  It all happens while reading<br/>
books IMO, he&#39;ll catch on! Relax and don&#39;t worry about it now, it will<br/>
happen whether you want it to or not, unless of course you push too much,<br/>
then it will turn him off!<br/>
<br/>
There are some excellent and fun books that help children learn the left to<br/>
right reading direction.  They are simple mazes that only go from left to<br/>
right. You can find them at educational stores.  I don&#39;t know how you feel<br/>
about work books, but I think if the child finds them fun, they will like to<br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>
I know, this is coming from a new unschooler!  But when my girls were<br/>
little, I didn&#39;t push them until they hit school age!  I should&#39;ve just kept<br/>
on, huh?!  LOL!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hey guys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son, Monk, has lately been very interested in how things are spelled.<br/>
&gt; His new thing is to point into the air and say stuff like &quot;yrdq...that<br/>
&gt; spells DOG!&quot; And right now he is putting his magnetic letters on the<br/>
&gt; floor and saying &quot;That spells GO!&quot; and the letters ar like &quot;yao&quot; or<br/>
&gt; something. He knows all of his letters, but he doesn&#39;t know how to spell<br/>
&gt; yet. My question for the group is how to approach this. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; correct him, because I feel that might be discouraging, but I&#39;m afraid<br/>
&gt; if I let him continue to spell things wrong, he will think he&#39;s right.<br/>
&gt; What would you do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gotta go...he just spelled the word &quot;Chair&quot; (antyooohtrszgh...that<br/>
&gt; spells CHAIR!) </span></blockquote></div>
