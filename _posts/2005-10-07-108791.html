<div id="ygrps-yiv-151444466">Hi!  I could use some ideas, too, and since Denise asked, I thought I&#39;d <br/>
start a thread.<br/>
<br/>
*Bubbles<br/>
*Container with water and stuff to mix in them (baking soda, vinegar, <br/>
oil, glitter, flour, cinnamon) to make potions (we do this outside and <br/>
add weeds and herbs and flower petals)<br/>
*Blocks<br/>
*Balloons (to attach to straws threaded with string and race, to fill <br/>
with water, to fill with rice, to blow up, to pop, to fly around)<br/>
*Build fairy houses outside with twigs and branches and leaves<br/>
*Draw<br/>
*Collage<br/>
*Games (Spy Alley, Jenga, Uno)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, my kids are awake now...we stayed up late last night and they <br/>
slept in so I have had some time this morning with my coffee and <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
Peace~Jessica</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605680915">We&#39;re lucky to live in a metropolitan area and have<br/>
lots of places to go that are fun--maybe some of you<br/>
have them, too--<br/>
<br/>
*the aquarium<br/>
*the zoo<br/>
*the farmer&#39;s market<br/>
*the beach<br/>
*numerous parks<br/>
*the science museum<br/>
*the history museum<br/>
*the children&#39;s museum<br/>
*the art museum<br/>
*varius art galleries/sculpture parks<br/>
*varius libraries<br/>
*ethnic food stores--Mexican, Eastern European, Asian,<br/>
Mediteratian, etc.<br/>
*u-pick orchards, farms, dairies,<br/>
*comic book stores<br/>
*book stores<br/>
*Museum of radio and electricity<br/>
*Railroad Museum<br/>
*Marina to look at boats or buy fish<br/>
*Mountains for skiing/hiking/animal watching<br/>
*Ferry rides, just for fun<br/>
<br/>
We also have made trips of almost all of these places<br/>
with sketch pads/paints/etc just for the fun of<br/>
drawing/painting--especially good on ferry boats!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005254308">Here is a list of Things to do that I made a while back:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Play mailman - At our house we each live in a different room. We use a box<br/>
or container for our mailbox and we send each other notes, bills, and<br/>
homemade junk mail. <br/>
<br/>
Listen to books on tape - They are especially great for in the car. <br/>
<br/>
Finger knitting.<br/>
<br/>
Finger crochet.<br/>
<br/>
Plastic canvas and yarn projects .<br/>
<br/>
Hand sewing (felt works well for little ones), make bean bags, rice bags (to<br/>
heat and sleep with), stuffed animals, doll blankets and pillows, and other<br/>
doll items. <br/>
<br/>
Read aloud.  Ask your friends or email buddies what their favorites are. <br/>
<br/>
Make bubble gum - you can buy gum base on line in a craft kit for under $10<br/>
if you look around.<br/>
<br/>
Make silly putty- recipes on-line .<br/>
<br/>
Borax snowflakes- recipes on line.<br/>
<br/>
Blow soap bubbles when it&#39;s below zero, they freeze and break when they<br/>
crash. <br/>
<br/>
Rent a movie. <br/>
<br/>
Go to a museum, children&#39;s, state, history, art, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Play store - Price items in your home and use real or play money and take<br/>
turns being the cashier.<br/>
<br/>
Scavenger hunt - inside or outside, finding the things on your list or find<br/>
things other have hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Learn to follow a compass and make an Orienteering course to follow to find<br/>
a treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Bury a time capsule.<br/>
<br/>
Have some friends over for a club with a theme.  My kids like Club Survivor<br/>
or Fear Factor, where they dare each other to eat gross things and win<br/>
prizes. <br/>
<br/>
Guess the smell...blindfolded <br/>
<br/>
Guess the item (by feel) ...blindfolded. <br/>
<br/>
Ask for a tour of a local business. <br/>
<br/>
Make candles, soap, or candy.<br/>
<br/>
Go for a nature walk and collect rocks and leaves.  See if you can identify<br/>
the trees or leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Visit a local farm and bring the animals a treat.  Horses and goats love<br/>
carrots or apples.<br/>
<br/>
Volunteer at a farm to brush the horses or goats, shovel stalls, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Go skiing, snow shoeing, or sliding.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the beach or go camping.  It doesn&#39;t have to be 80 degrees out.  The<br/>
beach is beautiful when it is 50 and sunny.  The sand is warm and the wind<br/>
gives you healthy rosy cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
Build a campfire in your yard (might need a permit) and toast marshmallows<br/>
or make smores. <br/>
<br/>
Play a board game or a card game. <br/>
<br/>
Write a story.  Pick a topic and get going...You could have a story night<br/>
with a different topic each week.  Mystery, Horror, Love, Family,<br/>
Non-fiction, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Make your own newspaper about your family.  You can put in pictures too.  <br/>
<br/>
Make paper Decorate your house for the next holiday...hearts on the windows,<br/>
snowflakes hanging from the ceiling, shamrocks, pumpkins, leaves, bats, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Make tissue paper snowflakes. <br/>
<br/>
Make a bank or mask from paper mache&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Make clay pots with self drying clay. <br/>
<br/>
Paint ornaments or little wooden figures from the craft store. <br/>
<br/>
Paint a picture. <br/>
<br/>
Tie dye your underwear, socks, or t-shirts.<br/>
<br/>
String beads for necklaces or bracelets.<br/>

Make necklaces or bracelets out of cotton string.<br/>
<br/>
Paint a clay flower pot with a whimsical motif.<br/>
<br/>
Work with polymer clay, make pins, beads, little figures, or magnets.<br/>
<br/>
Make cards with rubber stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Make a bank from recyclable plastic containers.<br/>
<br/>
Print out coloring pages with your favorite theme and color them. <br/>
<br/>
Buy shrinky dinks, color and shrink them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

As my 3 year old said today when he got new Power Ranger sneakers:<br/>
&quot;THAT&#39;S what I&#39;m talkin&#39; about, baby!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I feel all ready for those winter days!<br/>
<br/>
Great list.  <br/>
