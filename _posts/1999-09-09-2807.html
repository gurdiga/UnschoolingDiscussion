&gt;Up until this year, they still want to do show and tell! <br/>
&gt;That is their favorite thing to do, show off their toys.  Oldest ds is <br/>
&gt;getting over it, but even he likes to do it occasionally!  Makes them feel <br/>
&gt;good to just get up in front of everyone, (big crowed of 2! ) and talk about <br/>
&gt;their favorite thing.<br/>

really liked. I am afraid he is missing that aspect now with our very small<br/>
family. He does like the days at our local HS group when the kids make<br/>
something and get together to share their creations. I had wondered whether<br/>
this was something he picked up in school, but maybe it is just a function<br/>
of being a person; I like to share my experiences with my friends too!<br/>

All kids want to show off what they learn or something they really really<br/>
like.  It interests them. :o)<br/>
