<div id="ygrps-yiv-17529333">I found a cute video at the library: Linnea in Monet&#39;s Garden.  A little<br/>
girl and her friend go to France to visit Monet&#39;s garden.  It is mostly<br/>
gentle cartoon with some photography of Monet and his garden, plus his<br/>
paintings.  My dd really enjoyed it.  Then we looked at some of his<br/>
paintings in an art book we have.<br/>
