religious pamphlets and abortion clinic protests...how can you say that you <br/>
don&#39;t shove your beliefs down our throats?  Are these all examples of your <br/>
&quot;testimony to our beliefs&quot;?  Since it is a testimony to your belief does it <br/>
make it any less offensive to others who have different beliefs?  Do you <br/>
think that you have some &quot;God Given&quot; right to shove your beliefs down our <br/>

&lt;&lt;  Do you <br/>

<br/>
Not right. Duty.<br/>
I&#39;ve been a fundamentalist Christian, and I honestly understand their drive <br/>
to proselytize and to help prevent sin.<br/>
<br/>
Christianity in its fundamental forms (devout Catholicism; Southern Baptists <br/>
and their ilk) do not see &quot;their beliefs&quot; and &quot;other&#39;s beliefs.&quot;  They see <br/>
TRUTH and Satanic evil.  There is some benevolent ignorance, and those people <br/>
might yet come to be saved.<br/>
<br/>
And naturally, the Catholics and the Baptists see one another as part of the <br/>
Satanic evil.<br/>
<br/>
So I understand it in Christian terms, but I don&#39;t like to keep on seeing it <br/>
in homeschooling discussions.  There are hundreds of thousands of families <br/>
who homeschool because they believe God told them to--because they want their <br/>
children to associate only with likeminded Christians (that&#39;s what statement <br/>
of faith groups are all about), and they&#39;re raising the next generation of <br/>
American leadership, leaders who won&#39;t be confused by all kinds of <br/>
politically correct, critical-thinking nonsense, but will be Steeped in the <br/>
TRUTH of God.  <br/>
<br/>
Those homeschoolers sometimes cannot fathom why others would homeschool.  <br/>
We&#39;re not all doing the same thing.   Sometimes unschooling families who want <br/>
their children to be independent thinkers are more anethema to strictly <br/>
controlling families than general schoolgoing families are.<br/>
<br/>
-=-...while we have no rights since we don&#39;t all prescribe to the rules <br/>
of your god.  This seems totally unfair and hypocrital of you.-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, from their point of view to adopt a &quot;to each his own&quot; attitude would be <br/>
to condemn non-believers to hell.  They NEED to try to convert others.  Jesus <br/>
commanded it.   They&#39;re not trying to be obnoxious, they&#39;re trying to show us <br/>
the one true way to live forever in joy.  I&#39;m serious.<br/>
<br/>
I was also serious when I expressed amusement that in the very same week <br/>
birth control clinics are condemned but dog breeding is condemned too.  NO <br/>
more dogs; LOTS more people.  But it wasn&#39;t logic, it was religion, and I <br/>
forgot that for a second.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376245899">I&#39;ll say it again - thank you, Candice, for interpreting the &quot;we&quot; for <br/>
what it is.  And no, there isn&#39;t another person on the message board <br/>
who knows me or my family personally (or least that I know of).<br/>
<br/>
I am a self-titled &quot;pro-lifer&quot; and there is no denial about what some <br/>
people in this group do.  Just as I would believe that a &quot;pro-<br/>
choicer&quot; doesn&#39;t want to be considered a baby-killer just because <br/>
they believe in choice or what others are paid to do under the <br/>
title &quot;abortion&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, I do not blow up abortion clinics or kill abortionists.  I do <br/>
not condone that behavior (my logic & heart says that would not be <br/>
respecting life very much, would it?).  I personally do not believe <br/>
that every black person who was part of the civil rights movement was <br/>
a militant activist or that I am either just because I believe in <br/>
civil rights.  Just as those who have committed unspeakable acts <br/>
against humanity in the name of their beliefs toward the government <br/>
are speaking or acting for me in anyway.<br/>

&gt; I just have to respond, and I will probably regret <br/>
&gt; it.  I am a practicing Catholic and many of my closet friends, both <br/>
&gt; spiritually and neighborly are baptists.  Do I support the radical <br/>
pro-life <br/>
&gt; movement that burns clinics and kills people?  Of course not, and <br/>
I&#39;d be <br/>
&gt; hard pressed to name one person in my parish of well over a <br/>
thousand families <br/>
&gt; who would support that kind of violence.  In fact, I&#39;d be hard <br/>
pressed to <br/>
&gt; find a single person in my parish who would consider any other <br/>
person of any <br/>
&gt; religion &quot;evil.&quot;  In fact, our priests regularly use protestant <br/>
Christians <br/>
&gt; and members of other faiths as examples of holy life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I certainly know from personal experience that <br/>
&gt; some people of faith aren&#39;t tolerant, I am quite reluctant to group <br/>
everyone <br/>
&gt; together.   If anyone wants a generalization of Catholicism that <br/>
works <br/>
&gt; for me, it is that we believe that Christ came to redeem the world--<br/>
and at some <br/>
&gt; point everyone will be redeemed.  Do I understand how that will <br/>
work?  <br/>
&gt; Of course not, and I really don&#39;t want to know.  But do I believe <br/>
that if <br/>
&gt; Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with <br/>
every single <br/>
&gt; idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?  I think not.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are <br/>
&gt; just that--radically unbalanced.  Probably whatever group gave them <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of <br/>
&gt; allegiance.  I love life, and that will cause me to get involved <br/>
and help <br/>
&gt; anyone I can to live a full life--old person, sick person, lonely <br/>
person, <br/>
&gt; condemned person, unborn person.  Yet, I could never take it upon <br/>
myself to <br/>
&gt; judge and condemn another&#39;s actions.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But please, don&#39;t take the old shibboleths and give <br/>
&gt; them new life.  I don&#39;t hate anyone, am not a &quot;fundamentalist&quot;, <br/>
unless you <br/>
&gt; mean I fundamentally believe God loves us all and we should strive <br/>

Not totally correct either.  Not all pro-life views include a ban on birth <br/>
control.  The belief is that the unborn is already fully human and thus it is <br/>
not a promotion of more humans but the same right to life as those already <br/>
born.  Many people who embrace a pro-life view are in favor of and practice <br/>
birth control, usually those methods which prevent fertilization rather than <br/>
implantation.<br/>

Something I have wondered for years.............what is the &quot;official&quot;<br/>
pro-life view on how to proceed when a tubal pregnancy is discovered?<br/>
<br/>
And I will go ahead and expose myself here......once I had borne a child I do<br/>
not know that I would be capable of choosing abortion for myself even under<br/>
extreme circumstances  (but who can say for sure how one would proceed when<br/>
faced with reality instead of  &quot;if it were  me&quot;).    I am adamantly<br/>
pro-choice----whether it be choice concerning elective sterilization (instead of<br/>
coerced after 1 healthy child for some races and incomes and denied for others<br/>
who seek it);  choice of practicing reasonably safe means of family planning;<br/>
choice of attending a particular church or no church; choice to conceive a child<br/>
even if life partner is infertile;  choice of means of education for self or<br/>
family;  and  yes, personal choice concerning whether to carry a particular<br/>
pregnancy into viability.       I believe I can only claim to support choice if<br/>
I acknowledge that  my choice might well differ from someone else&#39;s.<br/>

Yes, it is a direct quote, but I took it that she was speaking of herself and <br/>
her family when she said &quot;we.&quot; Why not give someone the benefit of the doubt <br/>
before jumping down their throats? When in doubt ask.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, you can&#39;t possibly believe that most people with prolife <br/>
philosophy act like the screaming nuts in front of clinics. Bumper stickers <br/>
and the like are an exercise in free speech, and even so, I&#39;d be willing to <br/>
bet that most prolife people don&#39;t use them or any other obvious sign of <br/>
their stance. It&#39;s like painting all Xians with a Jerry Falwell brush, or all <br/>
blacks with a Jesse Jackson brush, because they are the most vocal in those <br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
I happen to be prolife to some extent. I don&#39;t have any bumper stickers, <br/>
posters, T-shirt or other paraphernalia to prove it though. I don&#39;t march or <br/>
protest, or even cast my votes based on that issue. The only time I even <br/>
discuss it with anyone outside of my personal circle of family and friends, <br/>
is when specifically asked. I have given advice to friends with unwanted <br/>
pregnancies, but always while acknowledging that it was ultimately their <br/>
decision and what I was saying was my *opinion*. Yet you would lump me into <br/>
the group of people who plant bombs at abortion clinics because I claim the <br/>
position of prolife? The silent majority in this group should be insulted.<br/>

<div><font face="Perpetua">While I certainly know from personal experience that some people of faith aren&#39;t tolerant, I am quite reluctant to group everyone together.&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone wants a generalization of Catholicism that works for me, it is that we believe that Christ came to redeem the world--and at some point everyone will be redeemed.&nbsp; Do I understand how that will work?&nbsp; Of course not, and I really don&#39;t want to know.&nbsp; But do I believe that if Christ would die to redeem the world-- every single person with every single idiosyncrasy, can I condemn anyone?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Perpetua">Sometimes people who are part of the radical fringe are just that--radically unbalanced.&nbsp; Probably whatever group gave them some acceptance would be the beneficiary of their unbalanced sense of allegiance.&nbsp; I love life, and that will cause me to get involved and help anyone I can to live a full life--old person, sick person, lonely person, condemned person, unborn person.&nbsp; Yet, I could never take it upon myself to judge and condemn another&#39;s actions.&nbsp; </font></div>

I can tell what I know to be true of MANY of both groups.  I&#39;m not making <br/>
things up.  Some people think that by reciting peaceful-sounding platitudes, <br/>
that the problems go away and that the harsher realities are unfocussed (like <br/>

&lt;&lt; In addition, you can&#39;t possibly believe that most people with prolife <br/>
 philosophy act like the screaming nuts in front of clinics. Bumper stickers <br/>
 and the like are an exercise in free speech, and even so, I&#39;d be willing to <br/>
 bet that most prolife people don&#39;t use them or any other obvious sign of <br/>
 their stance. It&#39;s like painting all Xians with a Jerry Falwell brush, or <br/>
all <br/>
 blacks with a Jesse Jackson brush, because they are the most vocal in those <br/>
 groups. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Conservatives, those who voice a pro-life or any other unpopular opinion seem <br/>
to be the group it&#39;s okay to express and feel unreasonable suspicion toward.  <br/>
Those who claim and demonstrate tolerance in most other situations seem to <br/>
lose their cool when confronting these types.  Their reason usually boils <br/>
down to the fact that these folks are so &quot;intolerant&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand some of the reaction but to assume so much about another&#39;s <br/>
beliefs and attitudes is beyond me.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m guilty of the same but I <br/>
hope I have grown beyond it by now.<br/>

<br/>
I am a practicing catholic, and I have to inject here.  The &quot;official&quot; position of the Pope is anti-birth control.  However, in the US, most churches realize are somewhat more lax on certain issues.  And while abstinence is taught and obviously taken as the position of the church, we are also not ignorant of todays society. So people aren&#39;t stoned because they chose to use bc.  Most people would agree that given the choice of using bc or having an abortion, bc is the better of the two &quot;evils&quot;. It is (in my humble opinion) wrong to have an abortion. I consider myself pro-choice.... the choice part is chosing to have sex in the first place, unprotected or otherwise. As with all choices in life, there are consequences. This one being the possibility of pregnancy. Not to start a big debate here, but I just wanted to point out that even as a Catholic we are not completely out of touch with reality, and there are certian &quot;church laws&quot; that have become less rigid.<br/>

there.  It&#39;s the old &#39;walk a mile in the other person&#39;s <br/>
shoes&#39; innit?<br/>

I freely entered into a pregnancy, though I was young, <br/>
I was in what i thought was a stable relationship, and <br/>
my partner at that time had expressed the desire for <br/>
children, so I thought we would be OK.  When I became <br/>
pregnant, he changed his mind.  I believe that children <br/>
deserve two parents, and a better quality of life that <br/>
I would have had resources to provide (physical, <br/>
emotional and spiritual.)  No-one actually listened or <br/>
properly counselled me during this time, though I think <br/>
I would still have come to the same conclusion, and I <br/>
had a termination.  What is my point?  That at the most <br/>
difficult of times circumstances change, and the <br/>
facilities for supporting people through those <br/>
circumstances must exist.  There will, I believe always <br/>
be unwanted pregnancies unless we have a totally <br/>
fascist state which requires people to use birth <br/>
control unless they are registered prospective parents <br/>
(sometimes even this is appealing, but only sometimes) <br/>
so facilities where they can be terminated safely must <br/>
exist.  Proper support for adoption must also exist, <br/>
the case of the British couple and the twins is a case <br/>
in point.  Pointing fingers and laying blame helps no-<br/>
one.  Working towards common preferences and goals <br/>
helps everyone.<br/>
