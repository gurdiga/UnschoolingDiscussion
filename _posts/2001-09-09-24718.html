Dear Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
No one stated that your methods are wrong, only that they are not truly<br/>
unschooling.  You are most welcome to make any and all decisions regarding<br/>
your children with our blessings....but the decisions you are making are not<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You say the girls have 100% control of their learning, but they must write<br/>
daily.  Reading is better than television. The unschooling philosophy is<br/>
that ALL INFORMATION IS GOOD.  All learning is important whether it<br/>
coincides to some &quot;skill&quot; or not.  The activity and learning is important<br/>
because it is important to the child.  Trust isn&#39;t something that can be<br/>
done half-way and trust is vital to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
While unschooling moms continue to make decisions about their kids lives,<br/>
most of the unschooling moms on this list (only unschoolers I &quot;know&quot;) are<br/>
continually looking to see how they can NOT run the kids lives.  How they<br/>
can give control over to the kids, how they can work things for a win-win<br/>
situation, how the kids can do what they want safely.<br/>
<br/>
Constant questioning of my motives plagues me as I move further and further<br/>
into unschooling.  Why do we have this &quot;rule&quot;?  Is it necessary for safety?<br/>
Is it always necessary?  How can we work things so we don&#39;t have it?  Am I<br/>
making these decisions because they are best for the kids or because they<br/>
are easiest for me?<br/>
<br/>
It is difficult not to become defensive when people question our parenting<br/>
but it is difficult to learn when they don&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did NOT say my girls have to write daily.  I said we have in place some<br/>
guidelines that include a certain amount of writing each week.  They were<br/>
in on setting up the guidelines and they can discuss changing them<br/>
anytime they want.  I did NOT say reading is better than TV.  I said<br/>
JENNI&#39;s Reading is less destructive than WYNDHAM&#39;S TV watching.  You all<br/>
don&#39;t have a clue about us or our system yet you continually tell me we<br/>
are not unschooling.  Perhaps, if I had the perfect children you all seem<br/>
to have, I could walk away and leave them in control.  Unfortunately, my<br/>
kids are human and need a little parenting here and there.<br/>

<br/>
Here is the clue we&#39;re trying to give you:<br/>
Several people are trying to say that our children behave as they do <br/>
*because* we are not fighting to control them, because we&#39;re not &quot;accidently&quot; <br/>
unplugging things, because we&#39;re not making them &quot;do work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We are trying to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Read that as slowly as you want to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a new homeschooler and have to say that (at least<br/>
so far) this has been true here. My daughter has<br/>
picked up more interests and watches amazingly little<br/>
TV since we talked about unschooling and the fact that<br/>
I would no longer be &#39;fighting to control&#39; her. It is<br/>
truly a night and day difference!<br/>
