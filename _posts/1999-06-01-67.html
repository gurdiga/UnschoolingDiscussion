 </span></blockquote>Actually, I don&#39;t think any child is too young for the Winona Farm.  Little<br/>
two year old Stephanie was better at chasing down piglets than many of the<br/>
adults.  Dick doesn&#39;t expect much out of the little ones. My youngest<br/>
having then just turned 11 wasn&#39;t expected to do much of the hard work, but<br/>
he joined even the two year old in collecting corn or the 10 yo in finding<br/>
potatoes for dinner or eggs for breakfast. He also got to feed the chickens<br/>
some kitchen scraps which is very safe there.   <br/>
<br/>
I know Sue, Dick and Nathan will be glad to hear how much you liked their<br/>
ideas and the web page.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s funny, but because Dick doesn&#39;t charge anyone to stay in his home many<br/>
people think he has alterior motives. But he&#39;s one of the nicest people<br/>
we&#39;ve met. <br/>

 We would like to get back there, maybe in the fall as summer is pretty<br/>
busy right now, we just miss the place and the people so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327590144"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If you live anywhere near Winona, try to make it over there!  Dick and Sue<br/>
&gt; are two of the most fascinating people we have ever had the pleasure to<br/>
&gt; meet!  Dick Gallien is a man that has been many places and has done many<br/>
&gt; things and has some great stories to tell.  Sue (who I just noticed is on<br/>
&gt; this list, HI SUE!!) is Dicks partner and after nine kids has seen<br/>
&gt; everything I think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HI SANDI,  Thanks, though I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen everything yet, though<br/>
yesterday I found a fortune cookie in the food waste barrel from<br/>
Econo-foods; it said &quot;you will step on the soil of many countries&quot;... and I<br/>
sure have, I was born in England, and am not sure how many countries I<br/>
actually stepped on during the journey to Australia [where I lived for 40<br/>
years]....   Malta, Africa, India for sure and now the USA.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The four kids that live there now were fun to hang out<br/>
&gt; with (tell them that Ian and Riley miss them terribly already!!).  We<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spent<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; quite a few evenings sitting around with the kids sipping hot cocoa and<br/>
&gt; watching them play.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rhianon, Madeleine and Stephanie say Hi.    They aren&#39;t fun to hang out with<br/>
at the moment, they all have colds and Stephanie is &quot;barking&quot; all night.<br/>
I&#39;&#39;m making echinacea tea for them in the hopes of fighting it off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Though, if you are looking for a quaint country cottage where you can sit<br/>
&gt; sipping tea while watching the youngsters frolic in the meadows with the<br/>
&gt; sheep, you are probably going to be disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is an option as the cabins are designed for &quot;tourists&quot; and we have had<br/>
a few unschoolers who opt to stay in the cabins and pay their way with cash<br/>
and a very small involvement in the work, or none at all if that&#39;s what they<br/>
want.....  that&#39;s fine but we prefer to have visitors who are interested in<br/>
participating in the way your family did.<br/>
Some parents will &quot;vacation&quot; in the cabin while their kids get involved with<br/>
the dirty work, that&#39;s fine too.  We have even had &quot;normal&quot; people staying<br/>
in the cabins who&#39;s children hang out with mine, collecting eggs,  milking<br/>
goats, hatching eggs, looking after the new chicks, climbing the hill and<br/>
playing in the creek.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is a working farm,<br/>
&gt; where there is a ton of work to be done and take part in.  No one is going<br/>
&gt; to hold your hand through it all either.  Just like we leave the bulk of<br/>
&gt; learning up to our young unschoolers, the exact same is expected of us.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was truly a wonderful experience for our whole family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good way of putting it Sandi, and it sums up our ideas, as you<br/>
found out we like to let people rest on their first day, particularly if<br/>
they have driven a distance to get here as you did, then we hope that you<br/>
become involved with whatever is going on here, and as you found there&#39;s<br/>
plenty to do, even in Winter which is the quietest time of the year, in<br/>
summer we often don&#39;t get indoors until 10 at night, then we are back out<br/>
there by 7 in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The town of Winona is GORGEOUS too.  This was our first visit to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Minnesota,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and instantly fell in love with its landscape.  I even HATED snow before<br/>
&gt; this visit, but now I can appreciate its beauty.  Living in a huge city<br/>
&gt; like St Louis, snow is usually a nightmare waiting to happen.  There it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; almost peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love the snow, as it slows things down even more, it&#39;s a great opportunity<br/>
to sit indoors and reflect on life, or get out and watch the kids sledding<br/>
and making snowmen.   I just received an email &quot;Winter weather statement&quot;<br/>
predicting snow with significant accumulation for tomorrow afternoon, that&#39;s<br/>
way better than the rain and ice we had last week!<br/>
<br/>
However no matter what the weather we have to make our daily trip to town to<br/>
collect the food waste, well we do have one day a year off as the store<br/>
isn&#39;t open on Christmas day, so I shouldn&#39;t grumble....   We started off<br/>
collecting food waste from two stores and did this for seven days a week<br/>
with no payment, we discovered that we were saving them huge amounts of<br/>
money when we started collecting from Econo-foods who wanted to pay us for<br/>
taking away their outdated produce and baked goods.   So we quit taking from<br/>
the cheapskates who looked on us as cockroaches.... it&#39;s odd the difference<br/>
in the way we are treated now we get paid for doing a service, rather than<br/>
them looking at us as though they are doing us a favor by letting us take<br/>
their trash!   We have now built up or number of &quot;customers&quot; so from our<br/>
lowly start as dumpster divers we now take the waste from two universities,<br/>
a hospital and the food co-op and are generating a reasonable income from<br/>
it.   It may seem a lowly profession, but I figure that over the years we<br/>
have saved at least 3,500 tons of waste from ending up in landfills to rot<br/>
and pollute.   So Dick&#39;s idea of &quot;finding a worthwhile endeavor which you<br/>
would do for no payment&quot; and then hopefully being able to make a living from<br/>
it in real unschooling fashion has worked for us.   The kids are all<br/>
involved to a degree, depending on their ages, Stephanie [almost 5] and<br/>
Madeleine [7 yesterday] help with opening some of the packaged items such as<br/>
lettuce and yoghurt and feeding them to the chickens and collocting eggs,<br/>
Rhianon [12] does these jobs and helps feed the sheep and goats and milks a<br/>
goat and is in charge of public relations with the Hmongs when they come to<br/>
buy chickens, Nathan [almost 16] sorts the food waste from Econo-foods in<br/>
the warm weather [now Dick and I do that at Econo-foods] washes the barrels,<br/>
maintains the electric fence, raises steers and helps Dick with quite a bit<br/>
of the heavy work.   He loves knowing that what he does makes a difference<br/>
to the environment.    Rhianon is also our &quot;tour guide&quot; last year she took a<br/>
school group around the farm showing them the animals and explaining a lot<br/>
of things to them, she also loves to do this with visitors, either<br/>
unschoolers or &quot;normal&quot; people.<br/>
<br/>
In summer we all help with the hay making... Steph and Maddi help by riding<br/>
on the hay wagon.....  This is the heaviest hottest work on the farm, and it<br/>
feels so good when you&#39;re done.   It amazes me to watch as Dick and Nathan<br/>
throw bales to the top of the wagon as I stack them,  Rhianon is the lucky<br/>
one who gets to drive the tractor.   Last summer we were racing the weather<br/>
and I took the truck to one field to collect hay while Dick, Nathan and<br/>
Rhianon collected it from another, we got all but 15 bales in before the<br/>
rain came.   I did another load single handed as Dick was bailing some more,<br/>
that&#39;s something I&#39;d prefer not to do again, getting up and down from the<br/>
tractor, throwing and stacking the bales in that hot weather was not fun<br/>
[til I was done].<br/>
<br/>
Some times because of the work load we don&#39;t have a lot of time spare for<br/>
&quot;visiting&quot;, that&#39;s partly why we prefer visitors who want to be involved.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; one, take a trip to meet the nice people at Winona Farm.  Open your minds<br/>
&gt; and take in the new experience and learn along with your kids.  It is a<br/>
&gt; great way to prove that we are always learning, never to old to learn<br/>
&gt; something new, and that age should never be a restriction (Dick is almost<br/>
&gt; 70 and is the most agile and tenacious person I have ever met!  He makes<br/>
&gt; most people 1/4 his age look like slugs!!).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now don&#39;t be too nice to Dick, may he makes people half his age look like<br/>
sluggs, but not those 1/4 his age.  I sometimes have trouble keeping up with<br/>
his energy level, by the time we are finished with the food waste at around<br/>
5 or 6pm I&#39;m ready to come indoors, but there is still things that need<br/>
doing outdoors, feeding the furnaces to keep the hoop-house and house warm,<br/>
feeding hay to the sheep and goats etc.   Right now I have to get out and<br/>
help with the barrels, with Nathan away there&#39;s a lot of extra things for<br/>
Dick and I to do.<br/>

home I had it too (mine is mostly in my nose, I sound like some whacked out <br/>
cartoon character when I talk!!).  I was worried the girls might catch it <br/>
too!  I thought maybe mine might have been the extreme change in temps <br/>
though  (it is currently 52 degrees in St Louis!! Thursday it is supposed <br/>
to reach 70 *sigh* then drop again *double sigh*).  I hope they get better <br/>
soon :(  Did Maddi have a good bday (other than being sick)?<br/>

some slugs in that age group, but that mostly stems from the fact that they <br/>
are trapped in school all day long and too bored and tired to do much else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you heard from Nathan?  Is he having a good time at his friends <br/>
house?  We felt kind of bad leaving since we took your help away too!  We <br/>
almost turned around to come back and help when we left last friday (how <br/>
did it go at St Marys?), but we were afraid if we did we might never return <br/>
to St Louis (and after we got back that started to seem like not such a bad <br/>
option!!).  I also accidentally stole your bucket, hahahaha!  I do not know <br/>
if you meant for me to take it or not, and once I realized I had it I felt <br/>
like a dork!<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I have been at this contraption long enough!  Stay warm!<br/>
