I also am a certified teacher, or was until my certification lapsed.  I<br/>
loved school, was really good at school even when I was at my highest point<br/>
of misbehaving (which was pretty high ;-)  I also have LOTS of memories of<br/>
my favorite game as a child being school.  I loved to sit my teddy bears &<br/>
babydolls down & teach them!  For as long as I can remember I&#39;ve wanted to<br/>
be a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Once I earned my degree & certification I had trouble finding a position.  I<br/>
was offered positions in faraway tiny towns which I didn&#39;t want.  I was<br/>
offered positions in private Christian schools which is not right for me<br/>
either.  I frankly became quite bitter that I could not find a position<br/>
right for me because of the political nature of the school system.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest child was born I remembered that my grandmother always said<br/>
that there&#39;s a reason for everything, but that sometimes it takes a while to<br/>
discover them.  I first read about homeschooling when my eldest was 2 weeks<br/>
old & it was like a lightbulb in my head....so this is why I&#39;ve always<br/>
wanted to teach!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would help if you examine why you wanted to teach and what you love<br/>
about it.  Unfortunately I can&#39;t help you with your family as I&#39;ve always<br/>
been the one in my family that does things differently, so it&#39;s easy as<br/>
they&#39;ve come to expect it!  I would also suggest that once you&#39;ve made a<br/>
decision that&#39;s best for you and your children, then it&#39;s easier to defend<br/>
to others.  But don&#39;t make decisions for your parents or siblings that would<br/>
be potentially wrong decisions for you and your children.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with whatever you decide.  I think if you follow your heart you<br/>
already know what&#39;s best for your son.  And we&#39;ll all be here to help!<br/>
