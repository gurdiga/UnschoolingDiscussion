&lt;&lt; Do you mean husband and wife take turns nurturing each other?<br/>
 <br/>
 I tossed this question in here because SO many evenings I feel like I NEED<br/>
 some nurturing.  And my dh feels this same need....and wants me to nurture<br/>
 him!  I sometimes feel drained.....like if I give one more thing before I<br/>
 receive some nurturing,  then I may just BURST :-)<br/>
     Anyway,  I suppose taking turns might work- thank you for the<br/>
 suggestion, I hadn&#39;t though to try that &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since thinking about it, this is how I think it works for us in our home. I <br/>
suppose we take turns, but in a much broader sense.  Instead I nuture you <br/>
today, it will be my turn tomorrow, we probably go in spells of months at<br/>
a time.  For instance after a new baby is born, dh gets very little nuturing <br/>
from me for several months.  This is his period of nuturing me.  Gradually<br/>
as babe gets bigger I return the favor.  When his work schedule gets crazy<br/>
and he really needs me to be all and do all becuase he is working so much,<br/>
I go out of my way to make sure that when he is at home he has as little<br/>
to worry about as possible and just in general try to be very supportive. <br/>
Now I am not saying if during my nuturing period he needs me or vice<br/>
versa that we aren&#39;t there for each other, we definitely are.  Right now<br/>
we are in a period of mutual nuturance (is that a word &lt;g&gt;<br/>

sick and in the hospital for 10 days.  About 2 weeks after he came <br/>
home,  I was hospitalized and ended up having my gall bladder removed <br/>
the old fashioned way. (I&#39;ve read that this is the most common dual <br/>
hospitalization - pregnancy followed by gall bladder surgery).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dh helped as much as he could,  but he had <br/>
used his vacation when ds was sick and in the hospital.  My older <br/>
child was in Kindergarten and really was helpful,  but I felt like <br/>
she was being ignored.  I ended up having wonderful friends that <br/>
helped by having her over to play, etc.  Also,  we flew my mil out <br/>
for two weeks to help with the baby.  It was an unbelievable time, <br/>
but a lot of good came out of it.  Mil and ds bonded like they never <br/>
would have had she been 500 miles away.  They&#39;re close to this day, <br/>
even now that he&#39;s 13 and she&#39;s 800 miles away.  Also,  we really <br/>
learned to prioritize.  It&#39;s so easy when things are running smoothly <br/>
to let the details get in the way.  I believe that stressful times <br/>
like this help me realize what&#39;s really important.  I know that <br/>
doesn&#39;t help you much  right now.  Just,  do what you have to and everything <br/>
else will fall into place.  Don&#39;t be too proud to accept help!<br/>

How nice to be at a point where you can mutually nurture each other!!<br/>
I think I understand what you mean,  but we&#39;ve been SO &#39;off track&#39; - or<br/>
maybe on a differnt track - than that for such a long time.  For us,  the<br/>
past two years have been so challenging for ME.  During my pregnancy with my<br/>
third child,  I was really struggling with some work issues and feeling<br/>
physically extremely exhausted all the time.  We finally decided I needed to<br/>
put my part time career behind me for awhile and I&#39;d be SAHM.  Well,<br/>
quitting was quite and adjustment for me...I had loved my job.   When the<br/>
baby arrived.....things were rough.  She was jauncide for a month and a poor<br/>
latcher/nurser ...so no sleep for mom.  We struggled for several months.  I<br/>
tried to begin exercising,  but it was literally painful to even walk.   I<br/>
finally decided to see the doctor and made an appt.  The day of the appt,  I<br/>
noticed while getting ready,  that my eyeballs were yellow!! And my urine<br/>
discolored.  The only people I had ever seen jaundiced were hospice patients<br/>
with liver failure.  The Dr. suspected hepatitis C,  took blood work,  and<br/>
requested an ultrasound to check gall bladder.   I never made it until the<br/>
ultrasound test.....the day after seeing the doctor I awakened in the night<br/>
with extreme pain and vomiting.  Turns out I had acute pancreatitis due to<br/>
gallstones in the bile duct.<br/>
    To try and make a long story short.....I have really had to struggle<br/>
with healing while trying to manage our home and family (three youngsters).<br/>
    Finding ways to get my healing/nurturing needs met and trying to be<br/>
there for my husband to nurture him .... and the children.  WHEW!!!<br/>
    I know this will all pass....it&#39;s just occasionally overwhelmimg!!<br/>
I appreciate everyone&#39;s insights on how nurturing the parents works in your<br/>
home.<br/>

    I think it&#39;s hard when kids are young. You&#39;re both tired much of the <br/>
time. Mainly do some little things for yourself and each other. I am able to <br/>
do more for myself and dh now that most of my kids are older. I don&#39;t know <br/>
about anyone elsa but my kids will take as much of my time as I will let <br/>
them. I have had to set limits, I have grown kids, teens, and pre-teens. They <br/>
each want something different. I am only one person, sometimes I just say no. <br/>
Then they think I&#39;m selfish although they don&#39;t always voice it that way. I&#39;m <br/>
mom and I should be willing to give 100%, 24/7. If you try you will burnout. <br/>
Hold some back for yourself and dh. It&#39;s the best gift you could give your <br/>
family.<br/>
    Also It&#39;s easier to start when they are young, change is hard.<br/>

maybe you seeing it written all out again will re-validate for you that you <br/>
are indeed under a lot!!!!  whew!  just reading it made me feel for you.  i <br/>
just want you to know that it is indeed a load you have going right now-- as <br/>
if you didnt know! ha!<br/>
<br/>
anyway, how about support from outside the family?  i know noone likes to ask <br/>
for help much but most of us would want to help someone if they were <br/>
overloaded (if we could!)  i am part of a hs support group that has a service <br/>
component where needs are put out on the email to the group.  in order for <br/>
this to work well (we have found) the needs listed should be as specific as <br/>
possible and include different levels of doing so that anyone who wants to do <br/>
something can.  because it goes out to the group (about 35 families) people <br/>
can respond on as-can basis without being put on the spot.  our person in <br/>
charge of putting out the emails for this is the one who is told of the need, <br/>
and she then contacts the family and gives them ideas about things that might <br/>
help them.  then she lists them on the email for others if they can.  <br/>
<br/>
i am sure there are others who would love to encourage you in some way if you <br/>
can think of how!  i hope your health prognosis is good now that you are <br/>
beginning to heal?  nurturing  by others is not the same as by your fam, but <br/>
sometimes it can lighten your burden and uplift your heart for a bit!<br/>

Whew! You poor thing!  Its hard enough with little ones (I had 3 in 4 1/2 <br/>
yrs),<br/>
let alone health problems, which I never had to experience.  Some of the other<br/>
posters had good suggestions about outside family and friend help. I would<br/>
also suggest getting a mothers helper, maybe a teenager in your neighborhood<br/>
or homeschool group who could come over and help around the house, or<br/>
to play with the kids while you take a quiet break.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes just the littlest things can make a difference<br/>
in relationships.  When I talk about nuturing, it may be something just as <br/>
simple as a stroke of a hand, or an unexpected kiss or a quick hug.  When<br/>
I do this for my husband, it lets him know that he isn&#39;t last on my list, that<br/>
I still love him, but that frankly he&#39;s a big boy and has to take care of <br/>
himself &lt;g&gt;.  These are the things <br/>
that keep our marriage going and keep us from disintegrating some days!<br/>
Hope you are feeling better!<br/>
