I moved from Pa a bit over a year ago. (sigh of relief)<br/>
<br/>
I know the law can be a burden but it is doable.<br/>
<br/>
Find yourself an unschooling friendly evaluator!<br/>
<br/>
I tried a couple different approaches to keep a log but my favorite I<br/>
discovered the year before we moved.<br/>
I used a check list that had all the required subjects listed. With a<br/>
simple checkmark next to anything we even slightly touched upon the log<br/>
was a done deal.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the portfolio went, the kids and I played scavenger hunt all<br/>
year finding anything remotely academic looking to throw in there. I also<br/>
took a lot of pictures to put in there .<br/>
<br/>
E-mail me privately if you&#39;d like me to send you some examples of how I<br/>
tackled the paperwork.<br/>
