      Hello,<br/>
I am a SAHM,well if you can call it that. It seems I&#39;m on the go a lot.<br/>
I have 2 boyz, 3 & 5 at home. I have been doing the unschooling<br/>
method most of their lives really without realizing it. I want to<br/>
continue. Neither one of them like the sit down and write in a book,<br/>

here is my question. Do any of you know of a link or software/game that<br/>
is more on a 5-8+ year old level but with the technology used in a more<br/>
advanced game? He loves to play Far Cry 2 and Half Life and does so<br/>
very well. I just want something a little less graphic. <br/>

What is it about the games that they like - sorry I don&#39;t know those two! Do they like fight sequences or puzzles or solving mysteries? Something I&#39;ve found helpful is to go to Amazon and follow the trails that say &quot;customers who bought this also bought&quot; and see where they lead. That&#39;s been really helpful in terms of finding new games that have similar characteristics to those my kids like. <br/>
<br/>
What do you mean &quot;less graphic&quot; - that the graphics take up too much memory and the games are bogging down your computer? We had that problem for awhile. Getting a second computer helped that. You could also look into a console system (PS, Xbox, Wii...) since there are more kid-friendly games available for any of those systems than for computer. <br/>

them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What do you mean &quot;less graphic&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what the origional poster meant was that the fight/kill scenes are <br/>
quite graphic, as in they show in a lot of detail the various ways in which <br/>
the enemies are blown to pieces.  I think my husband has also mentioned that <br/>
a lot of more recent first person shooters are becoming more and more <br/>
graphic in their gore, to the point where he sometimes finds them unpleasant <br/>
to play.<br/>
<br/>
My DH is enjoying Just Cause 2 at the moment, which is a little less <br/>
graphic, though still a first person shooter.  There are also a lot of other <br/>
fun elements to the game that don&#39;t involve (as much) violence.<br/>
<br/>
For a different style of game, the strategy games such as Age of Empires and <br/>
Command and Conquer are a lot less graphic, but still fun to play.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be interested in hearing what the more experienced unschoolers think <br/>
about these graphically violent computer games?  My daughter (who&#39;s 6) is <br/>
interested in watching DH play, but he&#39;s a little uncomfortable with her <br/>
seeing the graphic violence in them.<br/>

A bit old (for gamer geeks anyways), but star wars themed (a very big plus : all the big monsters, places, jedis and sith..), and with not much graphic violence : you&#39;re shooting at droids, or people in full armor, so no blood, no dismemberment. (at least, I don&#39;t remember seeing something shocking - but I&#39;m not easily shocked in games, and everything is relative : we have some ( un/home)schooling friends who do not like the idea of shooting anything). <br/>

graphics, especially explosions, but not the gory stuff with body parts <br/>
being blown off, etc. She&#39;s playing both individually and the <br/>
multiplayer online mode with friends.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t played yet - but it is described as Mario Kart meets WipeOut. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t really look like either, visually - it is in real locales <br/>
with very realistic cars.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If children are secure, loved, happy and choose to playact violence,  <br/>
it&#39;s a way to safely explore a world where the rules are completely  <br/>
different. It can be a blast to do things you can&#39;t or won&#39;t in real  <br/>
life because the real-life consequences are too unpleasant. A polygon  <br/>
person blowing up into polygons shaped like legs and heads and blood  <br/>
and guts is not in the same universe with a real person blowing up.  <br/>
Not even close. No one has died. Kids know that. It&#39;s the adults that  <br/>
have problems grasping the difference ;-)<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d be concerned with is that she may not want to see the gore  <br/>
but really wants to be with her dad, sharing something with him. And  <br/>
she&#39;s willing to put up with something unpleasant for something that&#39;s  <br/>
ultra-wonderful for her. If he sees that, he could ask her if there  <br/>
are games she likes better -- which could prompt a discussion of the  <br/>
pros and cons of various games and what each likes and dislikes :-).  <br/>
He could offer to play with her, do something else with her, but she  <br/>
really may enjoy watching. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s fun to watch someone  <br/>
else play a video game, but sometimes it is. My daughter and I have  <br/>
both watched each other pull weeds in Animal Crossing so it&#39;s not  <br/>
always about watching to learn ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You could ask her if the violence bothers her but it&#39;s possible she  <br/>
will say it doesn&#39;t because she might think she&#39;ll lose the time with  <br/>
her dad if she says it does.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe she could find a way to be  near him while he plays without  <br/>
watching so closely.  If he&#39;s sitting up, maybe she could sit behind  <br/>
him, back to back, leaning on him.   If he&#39;s on a couch, maybe she  <br/>
could sit next to him and play with something else, maybe lean on him.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody&#39;s making her watch the pixelated imaginary gore (it&#39;s not real  <br/>
gore), so if she can look away, close her eyes or leave altogether,  <br/>
it&#39;s not &quot;violence.&quot;  It&#39;s being with her dad, who is being home.   <br/>
Some dads... (Some?  Millions.)  Some dads are out drinking or hanging  <br/>
out with non-family, or telling lies and fooling around on their  <br/>
wives.  If a dad is home with his daughter, playing a game, I advise  <br/>
against the mom being critical of the details of that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes - I was thinking this, too. Be careful of coming across to your <br/>
husband as critical of it even just by mentioning concerns about it <br/>
being gory. IF the kid is fine with it, then encourage it, support it, <br/>
be happy they&#39;re hanging out and building that connection.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking as mom to a girl who plays a lot of (violent and gory) video <br/>
games, she is sweet and happy and kind. In fact, I told her I&#39;d <br/>
recommended Blur and she lit up and said how fun it is. But then she <br/>
said something interesting:<br/>
<br/>
 From Rose:  If parents would think about what it is they&#39;re worrying <br/>
over in violent video games, it would be better. Do they really think <br/>
their kid is going to find themselves in video game like situations - <br/>
carrying a bazooka or an AK47?  The situations are very unrealistic for <br/>
a real person. On the other hand, they probably ARE going to be driving <br/>
a car, so maybe the far-less-gory racing games are the ones they should <br/>
worry about.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - her point was that they shouldn&#39;t worry about any of it.<br/>
<br/>
Her boyfriend, Daniel, told me, yesterday, how he&#39;d learned to budget <br/>
his money and managed to save a bunch even while working at a minimum <br/>
wage job and paying his own expenses. He said he used the same strategy <br/>
he&#39;d learned playing Guild Wars and he went on to tell me all about the <br/>
ideas of considering trade-offs and comparing costs and benefits, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie and Daniel  are going to talk about the benefits of video games at <br/>
the HSC Conference in August in Sacramento. Kirby Dodd will be there, <br/>
too, so maybe he&#39;ll be part of that, as well.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 16yo loves games with lots of blood and gore, but prefers swords and battle-axes to guns in games. In buying games for kids and helping them find games they enjoy, it can be important to figure out what parts they like. Ray likes a little problem-solving, some steamy scenes now and then, and lots of gore. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not a violent person, irl, if anything he&#39;s very good at non-violent problem solving.<br/>
<br/>
My 8yo dd sometimes watches him play, but doesn&#39;t play the same sorts of games, herself. She prefers games like Spongebob: Battle for Bikini Bottom and the like, some of which include killing pretend animals or people. She&#39;s never once tried to take out the cats with a sword ;) She does enjoy playing Ray&#39;s skateboarding game - which has lots of blood in the crashes, although no body parts flying every which way, but she plays it very differently than he does. Where Ray likes to crash and crash and crash again, Mo prefers to create the different parks in that portion of the game - that&#39;s something I look for more and more when I&#39;m shopping for games for her, the ability to generate parts of the game, design environments or whatever. Ray has almost no interest in that sort of thing. <br/>

Lately he&#39;s been selling handcrafts and such at smaller music festivals and he&#39;s using a lot of the principles he picked up trading grain for swords (or whatever) in terms of deciding when to barter goods for goods and then re-sell those goods at other venues, and where he&#39;ll get the best rates of return. That&#39;s something adult vendors don&#39;t always consider!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If a 6 yr old is interested in hanging out and watching her dad play these games, I think she&#39;s likely able to handle the graphic nature.  Some 6 yr olds can&#39;t and won&#39;t and aren&#39;t at all interested in these things.  Her dad is likely her big protector and knight in shining armor all at once and he&#39;s the one fighting the bad guys.  Kids are also pretty capable at seeing the difference between reality and pretend.  Around the age of 5/6, kids start being more aware of that difference, and some kids are pretty terrified by it, suddenly are afraid of the dark or being alone, or watching a show or movie that used to not bother them.  I&#39;ve seen that happen with lots of kids around that age, so if your daughter is watching and it&#39;s not bothering her, I&#39;d say to let it go.<br/>

-=- I have noticed he regulates himself as far as what is too violent. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean he makes choices and has preferences?<br/>
<br/>
Or does he have rules and measurements for himself that he keeps?<br/>
<br/>
(Objection to &quot;regulation&quot; or the idea of self regulation...)<br/>

<br/>
**What I&#39;d be concerned with is that she may not want to see the gore<br/>
but really wants to be with her dad, sharing something with him. And<br/>
she&#39;s willing to put up with something unpleasant for something that&#39;s<br/>
ultra-wonderful for her. If he sees that, he could ask her if there<br/>
are games she likes better -- which could prompt a discussion of the<br/>
pros and cons of various games and what each likes and dislikes :-).<br/>
He could offer to play with her, do something else with her, but she<br/>
really may enjoy watching. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s fun to watch someone<br/>
else play a video game, but sometimes it is. My daughter and I have<br/>
both watched each other pull weeds in Animal Crossing so it&#39;s not<br/>
always about watching to learn ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You could ask her if the violence bothers her but it&#39;s possible she<br/>
will say it doesn&#39;t because she might think she&#39;ll lose the time with<br/>
her dad if she says it does. **<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that isn&#39;t her motivation.  She and her dad spend a lot of <br/>
time playing together, both computer games (ranging from spyro, to car/bike <br/>
racing, to barbie or World of zoo), so the games DH plays are certainly not <br/>
their only connect time.  DH is home full time, and since I am working from <br/>
home,  he spends a lot of one on one time with DD.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose there is a possibility that she sees them as the exciting games, <br/>
as DH usually only plays them after she&#39;s in bed.<br/>
<br/>
With most of the games she plays, she would rather DH or I are there playing <br/>
them with her, often for her.  I think she struggles with making the <br/>
computer/playstation do what she wants, so it&#39;s easier for her to direct us, <br/>
and us to do the actuall controlling of the game.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584875223">**  Nobody&#39;s making her watch the pixelated imaginary gore (it&#39;s not real<br/>
gore), so if she can look away, close her eyes or leave altogether,<br/>
it&#39;s not &quot;violence.&quot; It&#39;s being with her dad, who is being home.<br/>
Some dads... (Some? Millions.) Some dads are out drinking or hanging<br/>
out with non-family, or telling lies and fooling around on their<br/>
wives. If a dad is home with his daughter, playing a game, I advise<br/>
against the mom being critical of the details of that.  **<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in a previous message, this is only one of the things DD and <br/>
DH do together.  We&#39;re very lucky in having DH home full time, and having <br/>
plenty of time to do things as a family.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I wanted to make clear though, DH is the one having the issue with <br/>
the violence in the games, not me.  He will only play them after she&#39;s gone <br/>
to bed, or do small bits in areas where he knows he&#39;s not going to encounter <br/>
anything etc.  I was asking the question to get some opinions, and hopefully <br/>
to be able to offer him some thoughts/ideas that might make him a little <br/>
more comfortable with her playing with him.<br/>

<br/>
And my opinion was that you should not discuss it with him or ask why  <br/>
he can&#39;t do it other times.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an isolated part of life.   The relationships are more  <br/>
important than the details of any particular game.<br/>

play Spyro with her during the the day. Seems like an okay arrangement.<br/>
