 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t these children come with their own feelings about sexuality as well? My <br/>
son is 7, and he asked me to get rid of the picture for April on our <br/>
calendar. It is a painting byMaxfield Parrish, called Egypt. It depicts two <br/>
female nudes by a pool, one pre-adolescent, one woman. Neither is full on. <br/>
Quite beautiful. I asked why, and he said it just made him feel <br/>
uncomfortable, he wasn&#39;t sure why. I asked if he could find a way to see the <br/>
beauty, or atleast just put up with it for a while and see what he thought <br/>
about it later. This boy has always been Very modest about nudity.(his). We <br/>
are nude a lot in this house(hideous mental picture time, Maureen!!) and I am <br/>
not sure why he is so not into his own nudity. Even as a very little guy was <br/>
uncomfortable with being naked. Has explored with his buddy, is somewhat <br/>
curious, but very reserved. <br/>
I don&#39;t think it is anything we have done because his sister is the nudity <br/>
queen!<br/>
Just wondering, in light of the conversations. Any ideas?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know it&#39;s mostly my problem.  My 9 year old neighbor comes over every <br/>
morning for me to put on the bus for school, this morning he shows up with <br/>
the DVD eight mile.  I haven&#39;t seen it, I know it&#39;s the eminem movie, I <br/>
wonder if he&#39;s supposed to see it.  I know his grandparents only let him <br/>
watch veggie tales when they watch him over the summer.  So, I call his mom <br/>
at work, make him wait the hour until she gets in.  Do you know Jordan <br/>
brought over the eight mile DVD?  Yes, she says.  Is he allowed to watch it?  <br/>
Of course, he&#39;s seen it before.  There&#39;s nothing bad in it except for a few <br/>
words.  OK, she&#39;s his mother (although I feel like I&#39;ve raised him since two, <br/>
really really absent mom) she&#39;s seen it, I haven&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s watching away, I bring him his breakfast and I notice he&#39;s furiously <br/>
trying to pause the movie every time I come near the doorway.  I ask him <br/>
what&#39;s the problem, he first says he thinks he has it in the wrong &quot;input&quot;.  <br/>
Which of course I know nothing about and tell him to stop pushing the buttons <br/>
it was playing fine.  Then I come back by and I SEE, there it is in living <br/>
color Eminem and the girl friend he asked out on Friday night going at it at <br/>
work.  They are clothed, but the movements and sounds are very clear that sex <br/>
is happening in this corner and it&#39;s just totally close up on the upper body <br/>
and face so you get the full glorious experience.<br/>
<br/>
That was a total panic moment.  Obviously he KNEW about this part and was <br/>
trying to stop it before I saw it.  Soooooo I picked up a magazine and looked <br/>
at it while I&#39;m sure he sat nervously wondering if I was going to say <br/>
anything about it. <br/>
<br/>
Awkward moment?  Yes, longest three minutes I&#39;ve had lately.  But I guess it <br/>
was MY being uncomfortable with it.  I guess he was a little embarassed about <br/>
it or he wouldn&#39;t have tried to let me NOT see that scene.<br/>
<br/>
But I guess the real question is what kind of impact does it have on a child <br/>
to see or not see stuff like that?  I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m sure there are others <br/>
that do.  I&#39;m sure there are varying opinions on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
I think probably the worst thing about it was the uncomfortable tension that <br/>
was in the room.  Maybe had I KNOWN it was in the movie, maybe if he had <br/>
KNOWN I was going to take that particular time to sit down with him and <br/>
watch?  Mabye the catching us both off guard is what  made it uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I think I won&#39;t mention it to him at all.  But I think I will probably be <br/>
watching it with him again and maybe take the opportunity to say something <br/>
like, well geez no wonder their relationship didn&#39;t last, look how it started <br/>
out, sex before you even had a first date!  Then say no more about that scene <br/>
and leave it at that.<br/>
<br/>
But I think you are right, it just might be OUR nervousness about this issue.<br/>
