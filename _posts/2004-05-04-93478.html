<div id="ygrps-yiv-376330382">Morgaine, 4.5, has been extremely interested in death.  When she was <br/>
2, I lost my grandmother and my best friend to cancer in a short <br/>
time.  She still plays with my friend&#39;s daughter occasially.  When <br/>
she was 3 her best friend&#39;s grandmother died in a car crash <br/>
Christmas eve.  This past summer her great-grandfather, who we saw <br/>
often, died, as well as my husband&#39;s aunt.  We&#39;ve fielded a lot of <br/>
questions and had a lot of conversations.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes she gets worried.  I hold her and try to answer her <br/>
questions honestly without provoking fear.  At least once a week <br/>
she&#39;ll say, &quot;I&#39;m sad because I miss great-Grandpa.&quot;  I am still not <br/>
sure I believe in spirits, but when we got to the &quot;some people <br/>
believe&quot; part she liked the spirits.  I told her (which is the <br/>
truth) that when I miss my friend I sometimes talk to her spirit.  <br/>
She liked that too.  If she asks about children dying, I tell her <br/>
sometimes it happens.  Sometimes children get sick or hurt and the <br/>
doctors can&#39;t make them better, but usually the doctors can make <br/>
them better.  There&#39;s a country song about an abused girl who dies, <br/>
and we heard that one day on the radio.  We talked about that.  <br/>
<br/>
The best thing, I think, to do for your child is be honest with <br/>
them.  If you can&#39;t be honest with them it&#39;s probably best to defer <br/>
to someone else.  If you&#39;re honest and frank when answering your <br/>
child&#39;s questions, it takes some of the dark mysteriousness away. <br/>
<br/>
One day my friend&#39;s daughter was here, after she had died.  Gwen was <br/>
4, Morgaine was 3.  They were coloring.  I didn&#39;t hear the beginning <br/>
of the conversations but I heard, &quot;My mommy&#39;s body got very sick and <br/>
she had to die.  God wanted her in heaven.&quot;  (They&#39;re <br/>
Catholic.)  &quot;Yeah, I know that.&quot; &quot;Yeah, sometimes Mommies have to <br/>
die.&quot;  &quot;But my Mommy&#39;s not dead!&quot;  &quot;Nope, she&#39;s not.&quot;  And they <br/>
moved on to something else.  So simple; that conversation really <br/>
helped me talk more frankly w/Morgaine about death.  Just some <br/>
thoughts.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, this year I asked her if she wanted to celebrate El Dia del <br/>
Muerte; she really liked the idea so we checked out some books on <br/>
Day of the Dead and left out some little food and gift items for her <br/>
grandfather and my friend and others in the family who&#39;ve died.  She <br/>
liked that a lot. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids have both really enjoyed going to the local Dia de los <br/>
Muertos celebrations. One local place has people from the community <br/>
build altars - either general ones or ones for specific people. You <br/>
can walk around and look at the various altars, they&#39;re like artistic <br/>
pieces really. And they have a tree where you can write names of your <br/>
ancestors who are dead. The kids were fascinated by all the little <br/>
skeletons and stuff used in the artwork, and by the idea of leaving <br/>
food out for the dead. It&#39;s a much more interesting celebration than <br/>
the watered down Hallmark-ized Halloween that we now celebrate in the <br/>
US as a rule (though we do that too!) - store-made Power Ranger <br/>
costumes are a far cry from dancing skeletons.<br/>

celebrating, but never really learned enough about it to do so-a local celebration <br/>
would help so much... Maybe someday.<br/>
