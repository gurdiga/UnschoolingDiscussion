<div id="ygrps-yiv-863107714">Hi to all! Just wanted to tell everyone I got the puter fixed. YEAH! We had <br/>
to wipe out the hard drive and install a new one. Then the printer went AWOL, <br/>
so I went to Darin&#39;s store and picked up a new one today. But here I am... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 I took one look at my mailbox and just deleted, so forgive me if I jump in <br/>
somewhere. I am just thrilled to be able to get online, visit websites, and <br/>
work on the puter again! I lost all my favorite places, all my saved files, <br/>
all my diary... I couldn&#39;t back anything up, it was horrible. (insert pity <br/>
here. &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
~Nancy~ who is thrilled to be back! Can you tell? :o)<br/>
