Please clarify. <br/>
Do you mean about current international politics?<br/>
<br/>
Be a mammal. Be like a mom fox, or mom monkey.  Find a warm place to sleep.  Watch for current danger. Groom your offspring.  Share food with them. <br/>
<br/>
They’re not watching the news.<br/>
<br/>
If the question isn’t about current news, please clarify so others can give better answers.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for writing—this group let February pass without a real post. :-)<br/>

Get out of the house. Start a new (fun) book. Start watching a new (fun) show. Start a new project if you are crafty. Start a new exercise class. Learn something completely different.<br>

It reminds me to share something I uploaded yesterday, and I’ll probably quote Karen on that page, maybe, I hope, later.<br/>

Probably I’ll add Karen’s here, instead, and make it an easier-to-find happiness page.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I’m talking to myself.  A couple of you might not mind overhearing my muttering. :-)  Both pages are new this weekend.<br/>
