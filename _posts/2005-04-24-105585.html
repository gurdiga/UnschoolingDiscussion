<div id="ygrps-yiv-805637136">Thank you to everyone that responded to my post about me feeling like <br/>
my daughter isn&#39;t giving herself enough time to &quot;explore&quot; other <br/>
interests besides the computer etc...<br/>
<br/>
I read the link about how important choices are - I love this line <br/>
from on the of articles: &quot;Choice is a really important conceptÂ—not <br/>
just semantics. It&#39;s the difference between anger, regret, resentment <br/>
and happiness, comfort and joy in life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve always been an &quot;unschooling&quot; mom or have had that type <br/>
of mindset - does that make sense?  I am very &quot;laid-back&quot; with my <br/>
daughter, her friends like coming here because I don&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; a <br/>
whole lot.  I&#39;ve always let her do her own thing or have given her <br/>
choices.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m having a hard time with the &quot;school&quot; thing because I <br/>
guess I feel like MY decisions today will affect HER future.  But I <br/>
have to remember that she wasn&#39;t okay in school - she just <br/>
couldn&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; the &quot;one size fits all&quot; model.  I know I&#39;m doing the <br/>
right thing and I KNOW that unschooling was meant for us/her.  <br/>
<br/>
I think my biggest roadblock is that I function better with lists, <br/>
books etc...I did well in school - I guess I liked to be told what to <br/>
do and when - I did well with that.  But I am not good at &quot;thinking <br/>
outside the box&quot; or being creative  - probably from school! - it took <br/>
my creativity away!!!! <br/>

You can still function with lists and books, just try not to impose them on  <br/>
other people. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
There are ways to get it back, though.<br/>
There is this toy/game called Thinking Sticks, designed for just such a  <br/>
purpose (or to play with, for those who didn&#39;t need remedial idea-getting  &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
