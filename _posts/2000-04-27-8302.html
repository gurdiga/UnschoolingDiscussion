<div><font face="Arial" size="2">With all&nbsp;my good intentions of disseminating 
information about Debbie and her Uncle, and requesting recipe submissions for 
Debbie&#39;s fundraising cookbook, I wasn&#39;t aware that a kak virus was also being 
sent to everyone.&nbsp; Thanks to a couple of eGroup members who alerted me to 
the fact that this virus had been transmitted with my e-mail, I was able to use 
my Norton AntiVirus program and eventually remove the kak virus from my 
computer.&nbsp; It was found lurking in the signature part of my Outlook 
Express.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I, therefore, apologize for any problems or 
inconvenience this has caused others.&nbsp; I do want everyone to know about 
this problem, so steps can be taken immediately to remove the virus from your 
systems.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi All!</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I received the following e-mail from a fellow 
  homeschooling mom who lives in the San Diego area.&nbsp; The message is 
  self-explanatory, and&nbsp;Debbie has given me permission to reprint it 
  here.&nbsp; I&#39;d really like to help her and her uncle out, so I&#39;d like to 
  spread the word as much as I can.&nbsp; Please feel free to let others know, 
  as well.&nbsp; Please note the May 15th deadline.&nbsp; Here 
goes:</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">********************************</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;m busy with a project to help my favorite uncle 
  who was recently diagnosed <br>with cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis C. 
  He&#39;s a world renowned venomous <br>reptile specialist, and married to my 
  husband&#39;s aunt. They&#39;re coming out in <br>June, in fact. I&#39;m organizing some 
  fundraisers for them, since it&#39;s <br>outrageously expensive to even be placed 
  on the organ transplant list - you <br>need to be on Medicaid (they denied 
  them due to her making too much money - <br>unreal) or you need to have 
  $250,000.00 in an account. And that cost is just <br>to get on the 
  list.<br><br>Feeling helpless isn&#39;t my style, so I&#39;m compiling a cookbook. If 
  you have <br>any lemon recipes you&#39;d be willing to share, I would appreciate 
  it so much! <br>Or just post the request for recipes that is on my signature 
  line to your <br>e-list. Perhaps they would be willing to chip 
  in!<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Debbie Nelson<br>Share a lemon recipe by 5/15/00 to 
  benefit<br>my uncle&#39;s liver transplant -<br>Get a free ad in the cookbook and 
  online!<br>&lt;a <a rel="nofollow"
