<div id="ygrps-yiv-553545147">Has anyone ever rented an RV?  We are looking into it as an option for our <br/>
SC trip.  I have so many questions, but most important:  what do you do with <br/>
the kids?  Are there seatbelts?  Can/should they sleep in the beds while <br/>
driving?  What about when they are awake?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little freaky about seatbelts being worn and having the little ones in <br/>
carseats.  So I wonder if this is a good idea??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

A few summers ago, when I was visiting there in Houston, my mom, myself and my 2 children rented an RV for about a week. The kids didn&#39;t wear seatbelts. They mostly sat at the table playing cards or games. We didn&#39;t travel as far as you would be. If I remember correctly it cost around $1200 for the week. I don&#39;t know if that is good or bad but we had fun. I was a little nervous driving it but I got used to it.<br/>
