budgetary constraints and store hours and such). He got the &#39;wait <br/>
for  your birthday/Christmas/&#39; or &#39;earn it - do chores, get high <br/>
grades, etc&#39;  for things he wanted as a kid. Part of his own healing <br/>
is being able to do  for DS what he wished had been done for him.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
My husband grew up in a very poor home, and he tends to show his love  to the <br/>
kids by buying them things.  It makes him feel really good that he  can do <br/>
that for them.  I used to discourage him to do so, feeling the whole  &quot;spoiled <br/>
thing&quot; until I realized how much it meant to him.  <br/>
 <br/>
He loves to be the one that takes them clothes shopping.  He used  to mandate <br/>
what type of clothes they can get, and I would protest, but I&#39;ve  learned <br/>
that backing away and letting the KIDS express their feelings about it  has <br/>
softened his heart tremendously.  We went to see Narnia at the mall and  JC Penney <br/>
is having a HUGE sale, and HE took them around to each section and let  them <br/>
pick what they wanted while I went to the book store! :o)  Seeing how  happy <br/>
they were picking funky type stuff does so much more than me griping that  they <br/>
don&#39;t get to make their own choices.  <br/>
