<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, not at all! :)  I will say, though, that I rarely bring up <br/>
manners and morals out of context.  What I have found is that because <br/>
the boys are &quot;out in the world,&quot; seeing people interact with each <br/>
other, that their &quot;internal&quot; set of morals and manners are just <br/>
fine.  For example, one day, they were with me at the post office.  <br/>
The line was rather slow, they were bored, so they asked if they <br/>
could go hold the door open for people.  Of course, I agreed. I <br/>
thought it a very nice idea, in fact. :) But then, being just 8 and 5 <br/>
at the time, they couldn&#39;t hold the door open from the outside (heavy <br/>
door)...they had to lean against it from the inside.  That meant that <br/>
people had to walk around them a bit when coming through the doorway.<br/>
<br/>
Most adults would pass around them and thank them very politely.  <br/>
They *knew* what the boys were doing and although it actually created <br/>
a bit of an inconvenience, they understood.  They were <br/>
appreciative. :)  Unfortunately, one lady decided to &quot;scold&quot; them for <br/>
being in the way (they told me this later).  Basically, they <br/>
said &quot;That wasn&#39;t very nice of her, was it, Mama?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I think that in the artificial environment of school, where natural <br/>
behaviors are so &quot;skewed,&quot; children learn to ignore their inner <br/>
voice.  <br/>
