assistance and 11 yr old wants to make rug bear I need some help.<br/>

My sewing machine is jamming. The needle goes down and the bobbin area is <br/>
jamming. It goes around once and then it gets wrapped up under there. I checked <br/>
the needle is not in backwards and all looks/appears ok. Anyone know what may <br/>
be going on?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180578594">Sounds like your bobbin may be in wrong.  Take it out make sure the thread<br/>
is coming from the right direction and put it back in.  I would change my<br/>
needle for good measure because it could be bent a little.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What you might have already totally done, but I would try:<br/>
<br/>
Needle might be bent a little.<br/>
<br/>
Bobbin tension might be too tight (there might be a screw you could loosen <br/>
just a little, 1/4 turn on mine)<br/>
<br/>
bobbin might be in backwards/upsidedown<br/>
<br/>
Try a different bobbin (in case this one is just too tight or tangled or <br/>
something)<br/>
<br/>
clean out the bobbin area totally for extra thread or lint or stickiness<br/>
<br/>
I would try rethreading everything, and try with different thread and bobbin.<br/>
The maybe try changing the needle.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it&#39;s something easy.<br/>

This is what we think it was.  I have put these in many times and somehow I <br/>
was doing it wrong each time. Dah....<br/>
Thank you, Thank you , Thank you Sandra for your help. ; )<br/>
<br/>
 This is our first Satin dress so hopefully it turns out suitable for the <br/>
wedding. If all goes well I just might make mine also. (I dislike wearing <br/>
dresses! But i will for Mom)<br/>
<br/>
Laura D and 3yr old Cassidy who is ready to make this dress.<br/>
