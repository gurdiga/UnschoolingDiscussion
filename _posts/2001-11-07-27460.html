year and a 1/2 and even now still does, (but not like it was in the <br/>

There are alot of great articles and information. Parents who have been/ are <br/>
going through this very thing. Good luck :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973086187">Dear Tara,<br/>
<br/>
You need to be strong and not worry about what your husband thinks right now. <br/>
 What I do is try and have 3-4 main things I want my oldest kids to learn <br/>
(this year it is the states, about the civil war and the American Flag and a <br/>
review of math).  I also got coin collecting books.  I would just try and <br/>
have a few projects that you could start doing that you think he would have <br/>
fun with.  I also bought a little each month at Borders, books at discount <br/>
and have a library in our closet of books on about everything that they can <br/>
go to when they want.  I know what you are going through but hang in there.  <br/>
He is only 9.  There is no pressure.  Your goal is to have fun with them and <br/>
I would take all the workbooks and through them out the window.  Just have <br/>
fun and do things you think is fun and they will follow.  I also got my 11 <br/>
year old into acting classes on Saturdays.  He tried out for a play and got <br/>
the lead in his first try.  I knew he was a ham and just directed him to the <br/>
right place.  He also says he is interested in video game design so I <br/>
contacted a college about 3 hours away and we are going to go there for an <br/>
overnight trip in the next month or so.  Just have fun and go where he seems <br/>
to want to but don&#39;t try to teach anything.  Just keep telling him how much <br/>
you love him and be strong.  You have made the right decision.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t have any sites or books to offer you.  But I can say that I <br/>
am going thru the same.  This is our first year homeschooling.  I <br/>
used a curriculum in August, but dropped it, was to stressful for all <br/>
of us.  I love the idea of &quot;unschooling.&quot;  Of living, playing, <br/>
enjoying...and mainly letting the children move to what interest <br/>
them.  I&#39;m finding out that it is harder then I thought...for me!!!  <br/>
I want me children to be involved in something.  Right now my 9yob is <br/>
involved with T.V. mainly.  He waits for 3:30 to come so he can play <br/>
video games (I limit the time or he would spend ALL day doing that).  <br/>
<br/>
I know that we just started homeschooling and it will take time for <br/>
him to settle.  To find his place.  I found that I have to hold my <br/>
tongue, relax and be patient.  It also makes it harder when outside <br/>
forces (spouse, family and friends) are pushing for more activity <br/>
from them as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share and let you know there is another 9yo that is <br/>
taking his time in finding himself :-))))<br/>

<br/>
If he&#39;s there mentally before 3:30 he might as well be there physically.  By <br/>
limiting it you glorify it.<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered the things he learns from playing video games?<br/>
<br/>
What games is he playing?<br/>
Do you have player&#39;s guides?<br/>

<br/>
If you stop looking for just what you consider &quot;learning activities,&quot; you <br/>
will see him learning all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of waiting for him to &quot;be motivated,&quot; maybe you could motivate <br/>
yourself to learn more about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My husband is VERY concerned and I am a bit stuck <br/>
in the middle.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your husband needs to be motivated to get books and learning activities that <br/>
will lead him to understand unschooling then!   If he believes that learning <br/>
from books is the way to go, he can set an example for his son by learning <br/>
about unschooling.<br/>

my ex-hubby.  I wish he wouldn&#39;t play them.  He can play games on the <br/>
computer...I have more education games for that...but he won&#39;t do <br/>
that.  I&#39;ve even mentioned and checked out books from the library <br/>
about making your own video games and computer programming.  But that <br/>
hasn&#39;t worked either :-(((<br/>

There are things to learn from all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Of the three you mentioned, Pokemon is VERY involved.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve  never tried them, you probably should!  or at least sit and ask <br/>
your son to explain what he&#39;s doing.  The car racing has a map to learn (in <br/>
his head, but maps are  maps) and there are strategies.  Ask him.<br/>
<br/>
Same with the fighting game.<br/>
<br/>
Pokemon is elaborately involved.  I bet you&#39;d be surprised at the thinking <br/>
involved in that.<br/>

tired of them.  Maybe he&#39;ll be like a young man I recently heard <br/>
about.  His mother was worried about the huge amount of TV he watched while <br/>
he was growing up.  His first feature film was apparently just recently <br/>
released.  So just maybe he *needed* to watch all that TV.  I know that <br/>
hearing about him (along with things I&#39;ve read here) calmed most of my <br/>
worries about too much TV.<br/>

been some quite young ones.  And if he wants to do that, he could start <br/>
with the basics now.<br/>
