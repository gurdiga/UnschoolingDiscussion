<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839564312">When we visited with Pam Sorooshian&#39;s family in southern California in  early <br/>
December, Holly saw Cyrus Sorooshian at Knott&#39;s Berry Farm, and she ran  into <br/>
Dan and Jocelyn Vilter at Disneyland.   Cyrus was at Knott&#39;s  Berry Farm with <br/>
a team from work, for a Christmas team-building outing.   Keith and Holly <br/>
were going separately, and anyway.  That&#39;s coincidence  enough, but they actually <br/>
ran into each other.  Dan and Jocelyn went to  Disneyland for a choral <br/>
concert.  All my kids and most of Pams had ditched  out of the gaming convention <br/>
half of them had been attending, and went to  Disneyland on a rainy day. <br/>
Disneyland&#39;s a big place, but they ran into each  other.<br/>
 <br/>
Last time our whole family went to Disneyland, we ran into a mom and two  <br/>
kids, homeschoolers, from a town near us.  They&#39;re in the SCA.  We  know them <br/>
pretty well.  We found them in the back of one of the Main Street  shops before <br/>
park opened.  That&#39;s coincidence enough, for two families from  New Mexico.  <br/>
But we ran into one or the other of the kids four more  times.  They said they <br/>
were going home, and not coming back the next  day.  The next day they were <br/>
back, though; we know, because we saw them  again, in Toon Town.<br/>
 <br/>
So Holly has the impression that when she goes places she&#39;ll meet people  she <br/>
knows.  And it could be true.  My sister was sitting outside the  Air and <br/>
Space Museum in Washington, and saw a little girl who looked just like  her <br/>
friend Elaine Valdez&#39;s daughter.  Then she saw her friend Elaine.   From New <br/>
Mexico.  Neither family knew the other was travelling to DC.   She and Elaine were <br/>
best friends in elementary school and have kept in light  contact.  We grew up <br/>
about six houses apart.<br/>
 <br/>
Monday, Kirby started classes for the first time.  In his first class  was <br/>
his friend Liam (of the Carol Rice article about late reading, <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/carol_">http://sandradodd.com/r/carol_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/carol)">http://sandradodd.com/r/carol)</a>  ).   That&#39;s less spectacular a <br/>
coincidence than the out-of-state experiences, but  still a cool coincidence. <br/>
 Liam&#39;s not Kirby&#39;s age.  There are other  campuses of TVI.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s interesting that while my kids live in a really big, real world, for  <br/>
them it has been a small, friendly world too.<br/>
