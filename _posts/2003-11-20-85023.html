<br/>
I was looking at the mindware catalogue the other day and remembered some <br/>
things in there.  Here&#39;s the search results for word origins.  I love this sort <br/>
of thing!  <br/>

Internet search (google or whatever you like) for the word and &quot;etymology&quot; <br/>
should get you something.<br/>
<br/>
Incense has to do with burning.<br/>
Heart might be related to &quot;aorta&quot; (another many-vowels, only one &quot;t&quot; word) <br/>
and is definitely related to other meaning that mean the center, living middle <br/>
of something.  &quot;The heart of the matter,&quot; or &quot;the heart of a tree.&quot;   It&#39;s <br/>
probably so old it will be related to other languages&#39; words, but not likely to <br/>
have a clear beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Same with hat.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, in the American heritage dictionary there are some great <br/>
connections in the indo-european roots section for &quot;book&quot; and &quot;ship,&quot; both old, <br/>
short &quot;four-letter Saxon words.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe looking up Indo-European roots would get you some good trivia too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155206051">One great book that deals with this is Frindle.  It&#39;s a quick read, OK <br/>
for kids of all ages, and is a cute book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-694516651">I don&#39;t have any links or resources on word origins, but your <br/>
question reminded me of a morning many years ago, when we first <br/>
started homeschooling. My younger kids were little, and my oldest was <br/>
about 7, and we were looking through the dictionary to get a good <br/>
definition of courage.<br/>
<br/>
The etymology of the word was there, part of which is &quot;couer&quot; (heart <br/>
in French)...I said &quot;Look at this. Couer means heart in French. Couer <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;courage...so where does courage come from?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With her eyes bright, and a sort of &quot;aha!&quot; look on her face, my <br/>
darling daughter said &quot;From France!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL - speaking of France, there was some good radio on the origin of words <br/>
last spring, during the height of the Freedom Fries movement. The NPR link below <br/>
should take you to the Real Audio of this short program (maybe four or five <br/>
minutes long, as I recall) and children of any age might enjoy hearing this <br/>
golden-throated linguist explain how tangled the origin of common words can get. <br/>
:)  JJ<br/>
<br/>
Posted at NHEN Forums April 24 2003 : <br/>
In this era of Freedom Fries and a rising European backlash against English <br/>
words, comes a five-minute segment on National Public Radio&#39;s April 23 &quot;Fresh <br/>
Air with Terry Gross&quot; show, in which linguist and author Geoff Numberg of <br/>
Stanford traces the real roots of -- and political reasons for objecting to -- word <br/>
adoption across cultures, and explains how various words become part of <br/>
public discourse regardless of campaigns urging citizens to do otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschool activists focused on how use of the word &quot;homeschooling&quot; could <br/>
affect legislation, and what if anything could be done about it, may find <br/>
Numberg&#39;s observation of the connections between language use and politics relevant.<br/>

Quotes: &quot;These language wars are really intended as symbolic actions. . .&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Linguistic exercises are almost always intended for a domestic audience..&quot; <br/>
(the context of this was to say that the demand for Germans to stop using <br/>
English words won&#39;t send any message to Americans and isn&#39;t really meant to -- it <br/>
is meant to &quot;reproach Germans&quot; for inadequate linguistic patriotism)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;.. but it&#39;s important to demonstrate solidarity, not chauvinism . . .&quot; (the <br/>
context of this was noting that the German campaign calls for replacing <br/>
English with French words rather than demanding a return to the original German <br/>
words, because politically this deflects concern that some purity or purge is the <br/>
goal, and helps to cast the effort as a sort of alliance across friendly <br/>
interests, instead of just being isolationist.    <br/>

You could pass this riddle on to her if you want.  It comes back around in <br/>
seasons in which an English speaking country is grumpy with France, and so it&#39;s <br/>
here again:<br/>
<br/>
How many Frenchmen does it take to defend Paris?<br/>

Nobody knows.<br/>
