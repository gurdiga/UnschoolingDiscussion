&lt;&lt; BTW, I didn&#39;t have 4 years of math when I started in the CIS <br/>
(computer science) program in college. In fact, I didn&#39;t have a high <br/>
school diploma either (I left high school early because it was such a <br/>
waste of time). I had to take many of the math classes concurrently <br/>
with the CIS classes, and there were many times when I registered for <br/>
a class without having had the math pre-reqs, and just figured it out <br/>
as I went along, borrowing textbooks and such. A couple of times, it <br/>
caught me and I had to do some real scrambling to catch up, but all <br/>
in all when you want/need to know something, you can find a way to do <br/>
it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Without even knowing about this thread, the other morning Keith told me a <br/>
story about him I had never heard.  That happens pretty rarely, with two <br/>
talkative people after 25 years.<br/>
<br/>
He said when he first went to college, they had him take math placement <br/>
tests.  The first set was four pages, one page each of easy arithmetic, <br/>
business math, geometry and algebra, I think.  <br/>
<br/>
He whipped through it in about 20 minutes.  The proctor looked, and sent him <br/>
over to another room.  There they gave him a similar set, with calculus, <br/>
trigononmetry, and something he didn&#39;t understand at all--had never seen the <br/>
symbols ever.  <br/>
<br/>
He said they told him he could start at the junior level of calculus, <br/>
skipping the first two years.  He didn&#39;t want to, not just on the basis of a <br/>
few sample questions.  So he took calculus, and ended up taking theoretical <br/>
stuff for fun, and no math he ever had in college was hard for him.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because no math he ever had in high school was hard for him.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because no math anyone ever talked to haster Mind, pattern and <br/>
deduction stuff.   <br/>
<br/>
Keith said he always thought in patterns, and saw patterns in all kinds of <br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
So nobody &quot;taught him math.&quot;  That&#39;s kind of his native brain-language.<br/>
<br/>
People did show him cool tricks and teach him formal notation, though.<br/>

That&#39;s really interesting! Has he read/seen &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; yet? <br/>
Your post made me think of that book/movie since the main character <br/>
thinks in patterns. I thought it was pretty cool how they showed it <br/>
graphically in the movie.<br/>

He hasn&#39;t.  If it doesn&#39;t involve the end of the world or a nuclear bomb or <br/>
cowboys, he doesn&#39;t have the attention span to pay attention.  He must be ADD.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This kind-of goes into something we&#39;ve been facing in our household lately,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve discussed on this list and others some good unschooling movies,   but what if your child won&#39;t watch anything you suggest?       I&#39;m dealing with this with my son, he&#39;s 9 almost 10.   If its not shoot em up,  action, action, action,  forget it.    And he&#39;s really having a hard time even trying something when I ask if he&#39;d like to watch it with the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We watched Searching for Bobby Fischer,  he did enjoy that, because of chess.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Started Finding Forester but he got bored with it,  rest of us loved it,  he went off to watch Jurassic Park 2 for the 100th time.   All by himself.   Which also makes me sad,  I guess if he doesn&#39;t mind being alone its OK?.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do I keep getting these movies and just watch them with who will watch,  leaving him out?   Hoping he&#39;ll come and join.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try El Cid and maybe A Knights Tale,   his favorite right now is The Matrix and of course we&#39;ve seen Two Towers twice.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I ask him to give these movies a try and alot of times he asks &quot;do I have to?&quot;    What would a correct or noncoersive/unschooling response be?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess I worry because I have older brothers that are similiar to Alec and they say they felt like they were always on their own,  I don&#39;t want Alec to feel that way.<br/>

As for the movies. Get what YOU like and watch and laugh and cry all by your <br/>
lonesome for a while. If you&#39;re having a great time, eventualy, he&#39;ll <br/>
probably join you.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the movies I rented when Cameron and I began our journey:<br/>
<br/>
Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off<br/>
A Clockwork Orange<br/>
1984<br/>
Amadeus<br/>
The Scarlet Letter (old version)<br/>
Life is Beautiful<br/>
One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest<br/>
<br/>
All were good jumping off points for discussion. And all (except Scarlet <br/>
Letter) are MY favorites. That was the first few weeks---per Sandra&#39;s <br/>
suggestion: First step when deschooling, rent movies. Pop popcorn. Eat out at <br/>
ethnic restaurants. We did all that. <br/>
<br/>
I realize that Cameron&#39;s a little more &quot;compliant&quot; than most. But as he <br/>
watched the movies (he got to say at what time we&#39;d watch---late afternoon), <br/>
he found that my choices weren&#39;t so horrible, and he eventually got to <br/>
respect my choices. He would also pick out a few, and I&#39;d watch with him (BUT <br/>
I STILL HATE SCARY MOVIES!!!)<br/>
<br/>
If you agree to watch what HE picks out---ask that he agree to watch what YOU <br/>
pick out. (Just don&#39;t pick out a bunch of &quot;chick flicks&quot;---get something <br/>
that&#39;ll hold his attention.)<br/>

I&#39;m kind-of wondering if I like watching movies more than he does,  I&#39;ll ask him.   I am going to try Ferris Bueller,  that&#39;s one of my dh&#39;s and my favs!<br/>

<br/>
He needed Jurassic Park.  Finding Forrester probably touched on NOTHING in <br/>
his real life or interests.  I liked it, but I write for fun, and I like Sean <br/>
Connery.<br/>
<br/>
Even if he DID mind being alone it&#39;s okay.  He had the free choice to stay or <br/>
go.  So wherever he was it was because he wanted to be with you.<br/>
<br/>
If he HAS to watch movies with you, you&#39;ll lost the joy of knowing that he <br/>
WANTED to watch with you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ll try El Cid and maybe A Knights Tale,   his favorite right now is The <br/>
Matrix and of course we&#39;ve seen Two Towers twice.-=-<br/>
<br/>
El Cid isn&#39;t fun for kids unless they&#39;re really interested in the Middle <br/>
Ages.  Some of the plot is hard to follow, so it&#39;s just good for the <br/>
pageantry and sets and horses and battles the first few viewings.  And it&#39;s <br/>
long.  I think it had an intermission.  Go with that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I ask him to give these movies a try and alot of times he asks &quot;do I have <br/>
to?&quot;    What would a correct or noncoersive/unschooling response be?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yikes.  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t ask him to give them a try.  I would just turn it on and be busy <br/>
in the room, and see if he comes in.  If you&#39;re watching it without him, you <br/>
could call him in to show him something he might just be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
In El Cid, that would be the single combat to determine which king gets a <br/>
city.  Or the lifting of the siege of Valencia.  And then he can stay or go <br/>
when it&#39;s over.  And if that&#39;s all of the movie he ever sees, fine!<br/>
<br/>
If you watch the whole movie and believe he would really like it, you could <br/>
state your case and leave it available.  If it&#39;s time to return it and he <br/>
hasn&#39;t watched it, don&#39;t whine or feel sad.  It will still exist in a month <br/>
or ten years if he wants to see it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065551564">Thanks Sandra,<br/>
 <br/>
He does love battle scenes and games like Age of Empires,  loves strategy, so this is why I thought he might like A Knights Tale  or possibly Braveheart, Wallace is in Age of Empires.  Although he has a hard time when a main character dies,  so don&#39;t know about Braveheart,  thinking on that one.<br/>
 <br/>
Its so difficult because I see these things that I think he would really enjoy and then it turns into my agenda and about me.    Even tho&#39; I think I&#39;m doing it for him.  So there is a fine line between being some sort of a  facilitator/showing him what is out there to being controlling.    Finding that line and staying to the side that will allow him to follow his passions is what I am really attempting to do right now.  <br/>
 <br/>
I also need to accept that he might not enjoy the same things that I enjoy.   <br/>
 <br/>
I guess sometimes I sit and think about all the hurdles I still have to conquer and its hard to see that I have made some progress toward our unschooling goals.        (Trying to stay positive!)&lt;g&gt;<br/>
