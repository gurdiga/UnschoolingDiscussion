Google for Anglo Saxon or Old English sound files, or Beowulf  <br/>
original wav (something like that, so you&#39;ll be finding pages with  <br/>
sound files).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people say Old English when they really mean Renaissance  <br/>
English.  If you didn&#39;t really mean thousand-year-old-English,  <br/>
Shakespeare videos are the easiest thing for early modern English.<br/>
<br/>
Between those two is Chaucer, Middle English, and you can find  <br/>
recordings of some of that online too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082142303">Thank you for your help- I will see if they can articulate a little<br/>
more specifically to me what time period it is that they are<br/>
interested in - my guess is that they mean renaissance, but I hesitate<br/>
to guess- we do have an excellent recording of Beowulf read by Seamus<br/>
Heaney that we love to listen to- well, I better get off the computer<br/>
and ask!  Thanks again, Sarah<br/>

This looks to be an excellent on-line learn Old Engish website.  Lots <br/>
of audio files to get a sense of pronunciation.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I always had a thing for the Middle Engish of Chaucer.  <br/>
Hearing The Canterbury Tales read in Middle Engish, by someone who&#39;s <br/>
really good at it, is a real treat.<br/>

If you discover what they&#39;re really interested in is the &quot;thee and  <br/>
thou&quot; days, here&#39;s something I wrote for people in the SCA, but it  <br/>
might help them.  Or it might give you ideas for  helping them.<br/>

I found something good!  It&#39;s Shakespearean English, early-modern period, but it&#39;s <br/>
painless and fun and lots of vocabulary.   I *think* the guy says &quot;jumping monkeys!&quot; so if <br/>
anyone listening can confirm or correct that I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>

I don&#39;t recommend &quot;study&quot; of it or listing vocabulary or anything, but just letting it wash <br/>

was personalized for me (decades later!) by A Knight&#39;s Tale (with Heath<br/>
Ledger). Chaucer is the naked guy ;) I loved thinking of him as a *person*<br/>
who had these grand adventures then decided to write about them...<br/>
