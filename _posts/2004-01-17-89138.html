 </span></blockquote>My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful animated film that not only my <br/>
children love, but my husband and I have *chosen* to watch over and <br/>
over with them. (can&#39;t say that about many children&#39;s films) It&#39;s <br/>
dubbed in English but on the DVD you can listen to it in the <br/>
Japanese with English subtitles.<br/>
<br/>
Also just recently we watched Akira Kurosawa&#39;s &quot;Dreams&quot; -- also in <br/>
Japanese with English subtitles -- some parts of it are very <br/>
beautiful,  but there are some heavy themes (nuclear war and death.) <br/>
There are some non-religious moralistic messages. My seven-year-old <br/>
was entranced by the movie, but it was too much for my five-year-old <br/>
who went to play video games instead. :) Definitely recommended, but <br/>
you might want to preview it first.<br/>

sweet story. Uplifting. Iranian (Farsi) with English subtitles. It is <br/>
about a very poor family - the little boy accidentally loses his shoes <br/>
and he doesn&#39;t want his parents to know - so he and his sister share <br/>
hers. There is a lot more to it - great movie for kids!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There have been answers but I think the question needs clarified!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the connection is between the foreign movies and the<br/>
subtitles.<br/>
<br/>
Is it the foreign you want? Are you asking for subtitled because you don&#39;t<br/>
want dubbed?<br/>
<br/>
Is it the subtitles you want? Why foreign movies specifically? So your son<br/>
has to read in order to watch the movie?<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all movies, foreign *and* English language, on DVD have subtitles in<br/>
English. (And usually French or Spanish and sometimes a few other languages.<br/>
And sometimes they have other language tracks so you can hear it dubbed in<br/>
another language and have the subtitles in English.)<br/>
<br/>
If you only have a VCR -- BTW, DVD players are under a $100 now -- lots of<br/>
tapes (and TV shows for that matter) have subtitles. You might have to play<br/>
around with the menu on your TV or VCR to turn them on but they are widely<br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your kids can show you ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think if you&#39;re asking specifically for subtitled foreign films on *tape*,<br/>
that&#39;s going to be harder. Most foreign movies -- probably especially kid<br/>
friendly ones -- are released dubbed because there&#39;s a larger market for<br/>
dubbed movies that subtitled movies. Manufacturers don&#39;t have to choose<br/>
between subtitle and dub with DVD. They can offer both plus lots more.<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested Totoro but all Miyazaki&#39;s movies are great. Princess<br/>
Mononoke is more violent (it&#39;s PG-13 I think) but Kiki and Totoro and<br/>
Spirited Away are all wonderful. Even Castle of Cagliostro which has a<br/>
womanizing main character is at it&#39;s heart sweet (and a lot of fun.)<br/>

check the box first because it is not clearly marked.<br/>
