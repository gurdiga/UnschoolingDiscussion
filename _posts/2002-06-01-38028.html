<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455857903">In the area of disabilities, more than any other, I think we are<br/>
prone to make assumptions about that of which we know little.<br/>
The more you know about people with disabilities and the more<br/>
time you spend with them, the less you see obstacles in their<br/>
road.  Deaf/Blind do communicate and do receive input. In fact<br/>
one of the noisiest places I have ever been was a deaf blind<br/>
party.<br/>
<br/>
CP can restrict vocalization - but in and of itself in no way<br/>
restricts the ability to receive input.  A good chunk of<br/>
assistive technology will solve the vocalization problem.  I have<br/>
a friend who unschooled her daughter with spastic quadriplegia CP<br/>
to age 16 - at that point the child was ready for college - but<br/>
decided instead to attend ps for 2 years to try out some<br/>
transition plan services.  Nothing the school had to offer in<br/>
that area was as good as what she had learned, which further<br/>
built her confidence.  Even when talking about profound MR, there<br/>
is no reason to think that the parent cannot if so inclined<br/>
provide what the child needs - perhaps buying some services.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO (LOL) a child with significant disabilities has all the more<br/>
reason to be kept away from the self-esteem destructive world of<br/>
government schools.</div>
