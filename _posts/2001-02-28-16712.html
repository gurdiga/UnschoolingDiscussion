kids home alone for half an hour while I went to the library. Cristina (11)<br/>
got her sisters under the kitchen table with little screaming. :)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone&#39;s okay...sounds like less than 50 people have been admitted to<br/>
hospitals so far. Lots of damage to roads, bridges, brick<br/>
buildings...landslides, rockslides...stuff you&#39;d expect.<br/>

&gt;&gt; ... does kind of crack us up (&#39;scuse the pun) that we had to leave &#39;quake<br/>
&gt;&gt; country&#39; (where I&#39;ve only been in one big one (and not that many little<br/>
&gt;&gt; ones!)) in order to experience a shaker like the one we just had!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, that is a riot!  Now we know who to blame...you must have brought it<br/>
&gt; with you!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>

summers to come to what I thought would be rain, and enjoyed the most<br/>
spectacular summer and fall up here... please to forgive!!! :-&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Return &#39;home&#39;... did you grow up here, leave and return also?<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; Essentially, yes...I was raised in the NW (Montana, Utah, Idaho and WA).  DH<br/>
&gt; was raised here in Olympia, born in Bremerton.  We met and married in<br/>
&gt; Olympia, then the military and other career adventures took us all over the<br/>
&gt; world (Texas, Nebraska, Japan, Colorado, Oregon, Utah, WA and DH spent 2<br/>
&gt; years in Qatar which is a small country in the Middle East (we remained<br/>
&gt; stateside and sent him on his own!)).  20+ years later we were finally in a<br/>
&gt; position to choose where we wanted to live and chose western WA.  His new<br/>
&gt; job brought us to Vancouver, but it&#39;s close enough to family that we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; satisfied.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My mother was raised in and around Olympia.  My great grandparents were some<br/>
&gt; of the early Olympia settlers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DH&#39;s parents were both born and raised in Bremerton.  His remaining<br/>
&gt; grandmother still lives there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Eiraul<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow! Some travel and some history in this area! That is great. Is your<br/>
family connected to it&#39;s history here? Do you have fun/interesting stories<br/>
of your ancestors in the area? I did some biological searching and<br/>
discovered that my birth mothers family were some of the original Scottish<br/>
settlers in Montana. That was some fun reading!<br/>

Montana.  I had to read the first one because of the tempting title<br/>
_Dancing at the Rascal Fair_.  The third book, which has a modern setting,<br/>
with some genealogical references back to the first book is called _Ride<br/>
with Me Mariah Montana_.  (The middle book was less memorable.)<br/>

One day I was on instant message with a friend in Seattle right after the <br/>
earthquake (lately) and he said it had stopped.  He&#39;s from northern Germany.  <br/>
I was asking him whether he was aware of aftershocks when he said it&#39;s <br/>
starting again, I feel it in my chair, and then he was just offline.  EEEK!  <br/>
That was scary.<br/>
