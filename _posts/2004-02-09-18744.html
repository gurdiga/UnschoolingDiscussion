<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879994263">I have a question that I&#39;d like to pose to this list.  My dd just turned 5,<br/>
and we are considering registering her thru our local school as a<br/>
homeschooler.  I have no interest in &quot;schooling&quot; her, we are unschooling.<br/>
So, you might say &quot;why&quot;?  The homeschool coordinator did ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I explained to her this:  she was the person who first introduced me<br/>
to John Holt and the idea of unschooling (she loaned me quite a collection<br/>
of his newsletters when my dd was still under a year), over the years I<br/>
have learned that she is very much the sort of person who figures out how<br/>
to &quot;work the system&quot; rather than to follow it.  These two things make me<br/>
feel pretty comfortable that she will allow us to unschool and then figure<br/>
out a way to make it fit within the system.  I am also interested in<br/>
supporting our school.  This may sound ridiculous, but we live in a very<br/>
rural area and although my one daughter&#39;s income to the school is small, it<br/>
will help.  I am also interested in helping because we know everyone, and<br/>
this would help them.  Finally, by being registered through the school we<br/>
will have access to resources and $250 per semester.  Now many of the<br/>
resources may be &quot;schooly&quot;, and I&#39;m not interested in these unless my dd<br/>
wants to do it (like the art and music.)  By being a registered student she<br/>
can participate, and we can use their library, borrow their audio books,<br/>
etc...<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we &quot;have to&quot; do is meet with the coordinator once a month<br/>
(she is willing to have this be in person, by phone, or even email) and<br/>
provide some copies of things that my dd has produced (they need to prove<br/>
that she is a real live person - I guess some schools made up homeschoolers<br/>
for the extra money.)  She suggested about 4-6 things per month.  So far I<br/>
have the feeling that these &quot;have to&quot; will be incredibly negotiable so that<br/>
we will really have a choice about what we are doing - even if it means we<br/>
don&#39;t want to do it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I am hesitant - because it&#39;s not really an unschooling thing to do.<br/>
I sort of wonder what I haven&#39;t thought of... you know?  With the recent<br/>
threads about language, one thing that comes to mind is to stay away from<br/>
the &quot;schooly&quot; language when we are working with this person.  If we do meet<br/>
with her in person, I sort of think of it as a visit with a friend (which<br/>
is what it has been all of these years.)<br/>
<br/>
I would very much like this list&#39;s keen critical examination about this idea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
--bc--<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ps.   BTW, we are in CA so I can easily just do an R4 when she is older.<br/>
We don&#39;t have to go thru the school.<br/>

<br/>
I think when dealing with that person it might be a good time to trot the <br/>
schooly language out, but maybe not in front of your daughter, if that&#39;s <br/>
feasible.  Maybe you could ask the supervising whatever she is to only use everyday <br/>
language and to avoid subject area language, even, when talking to or in front <br/>
of your daughter.  That might be particularly interesting for the teacher, <br/>
especially if she&#39;s into alternatives.  <br/>
<br/>
If she can&#39;t handle that, that would be information for you both.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s learning about the Civil War, for instance, that&#39;s what they&#39;re <br/>
learning.  No sense uttering the words &quot;American history&quot; or &quot;19th century&quot; <br/>
unnecessarily.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my prejudice anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-620374874">I&#39;ve been lurking trying to soak up as much as possible about<br/>
unlearning. My children are 3 and 1 1/2, I&#39;ve always planned to<br/>
homeschool them but now plan to unschool them.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m curious why avoid phrases like American History, 19th<br/>
Century, etc? What harm could that possibly do? I imagine with a child<br/>
who&#39;s never been to school, hearing someone say &quot;aw, that&#39;s in this<br/>
American History class&quot; or whatever, would spur questions that would<br/>
simply lead to more learning. Obviously, I&#39;m a newby and am looking at<br/>
this rather simplistically. Am I missing something?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks so much for all the information you provide! :-D<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>American History, Social Studies, Social Psychology, British Literature...<br/>
those are all names of classes I took in high school.  The topics are also<br/>
real things that occur in life; we live American history every day, for<br/>
instance.  Where exactly does American History end and Social Studies begin?<br/>
Is British Literature (BritLit) separated from other literature on my shelf<br/>
at home?  Do I read &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; only during British Literature and<br/>
&quot;Little House&quot; only during American Lit., or perhaps during American<br/>
History?  &quot;Little House&quot; covers a lot of subjects.<br/>
<br/>
School&#39;s divisions of life into 50 minute compartments is in our heads, not<br/>
in our children&#39;s heads.  It&#39;s parents who most need to &quot;deschool.&quot;<br/>
Learning happens all the time, and yes, one idea leads to another question<br/>
leads to a new answer.  Some ideas may even have been presented in your<br/>
American History class, but that idea, that knowledge, exists outside it as<br/>
well.  Helping your child grasp the progression of history through the<br/>
centuries is not in opposition to unschooling; it&#39;s part of life.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never avoided using terms like &quot;19th century&quot; if the conversation called for<br/>
it, but I&#39;ve never drilled my kids on 19th century events.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest danger, I think, of using a term like &quot;American History&quot; is<br/>
that, having passed the final, a student thinks she&#39;s learned all there is<br/>
to know, or that she never need to worry about that subject again.  The<br/>
class is over, she passed, she must know all there is to know, right?  She&#39;s<br/>
been educated.  The school mentality kills curiosity, and *that* is in<br/>
opposition to unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Kids in school will say they hate science. But they&#39;re broadbrushing a<br/>
hatred of so many things that are very different from each other: biology,<br/>
astronomy, physics, chemistry, etc. And even those sciences have parts that<br/>
are very different from each other. Electricity and mechanics and<br/>
thermodynamics and nuclear physics are all under physics but are very<br/>
different from each other. Even those subjects have parts that are very<br/>
different from each other: some people will be fascinated by how power is<br/>
generated and transmitted and be bored silly with how to broadcast radio<br/>
signals. It&#39;s easy to enjoy one part of a subject and dislike another part<br/>
that gets labeled the same thing. The labels may make things orderly, but<br/>
they can be an orderly way for dislike of one thing to taint another thing<br/>
that doesn&#39;t have a lot to do with another thing other than sharing the same<br/>
umbrella.<br/>
<br/>
I think Sandra&#39;s the only one who ever brings up the idea of not dividing<br/>
the world into subjects. In fact Sandra&#39;s the only one who brings up a lot<br/>
of ideas unique to unschooling! But her ideas are always worth going<br/>
&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; about :-) If you don&#39;t get it, that&#39;s okay. But if you do get it,<br/>
you&#39;ll probably be seeing the world in a way you never would have before.<br/>

She also loves biology, but I&#39;m pretty sure she will not like physics (she&#39;s<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700560875">Oh sure, I understand what you guys are saying about the danger of the<br/>
clumped subjects while going to school. For me, it was math. I have a<br/>
hard time with numbers and it was forced down my throat and I always<br/>
felt really stupid because of it. Never mind I could play the flute like<br/>
a college music major when I was only 13... But Algebra was really<br/>
traumatic for me. It&#39;s a big part of why we&#39;ve decided to unschool. What<br/>
I&#39;m referring to though is the poster&#39;s (sorry, I&#39;m horrible with names)<br/>
meetings with the homeschool coordinator that works with the school.<br/>
What is the harm in that person bringing up such subjects in monthly<br/>
meetings. Of course if that person starts drilling the child on any<br/>
given subject that&#39;s inappropriate but if it&#39;s just a conversation about<br/>
what&#39;s being learned... From the stand point of a child who&#39;s never been<br/>
force fed a subject wouldn&#39;t it just be another thing to think about<br/>
rather then the sour memories many of use carry about such subjects?<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe now I&#39;m making it more complicated! LOL ;-)<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks so much for everyone&#39;s thoughts on this! :-D<br/>

<br/>
With the recent<br/>
threads about language, one thing that comes to mind is to stay away from<br/>
the &quot;schooly&quot; language when we are working with this person.<br/>
 <br/>
What you, Eva, wrote:<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m curious why avoid phrases like American History, 19th<br/>
Century, etc? What harm could that possibly do? I imagine with a child<br/>
who&#39;s never been to school, hearing someone say &quot;aw, that&#39;s in this<br/>
American History class&quot; or whatever, would spur questions that would<br/>
simply lead to more learning. Obviously, I&#39;m a newby and am looking at<br/>
this rather simplistically. Am I missing something?<br/>
<br/>
Barbara didn&#39;t specify avoiding class subject names or anything like that.<br/>
You did, and it was your post to which I and others have responded; that&#39;s<br/>
how threads develop sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Barbara only said &quot;schooly language,&quot; which could mean many things besides<br/>
subject categories, such as: grades, grade levels, learning disabilities,<br/>
tardiness, or other administrative b.s.  It could mean using &quot;eduspeak,&quot; the<br/>
jargon of teachers; see<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Of course if that person starts drilling the child on any<br/>
&gt; given subject that&#39;s inappropriate but if it&#39;s just a conversation about<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s being learned... From the stand point of a child who&#39;s never been<br/>
&gt; force fed a subject wouldn&#39;t it just be another thing to think about<br/>
&gt; rather then the sour memories many of use carry about such subjects?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now, to your own situation, I&#39;d say, you need to heal.  I mentioned before,<br/>
since I was addressing your post and not Barbara&#39;s, that it is *parents* who<br/>
need to &quot;deschool,&quot; more than kids.  Your fear of math will effect your<br/>
kids, unless you become conscious of that and consciously deal with it:<br/>
homeschooling can actually help us get over those school wounds, because we<br/>
can bring our adult brains and our inward desire to learn as we address old<br/>
&quot;subjects.&quot;  I brought a basic arithmetic workbook home from the library a<br/>
few years ago, and without asking my kids to join in, sat and worked through<br/>
it.  I discovered why I never &quot;got&quot; long division, which is what killed<br/>
math, and most of school, for me.  Approaching it as an adult, being patient<br/>
with myself, having my own motivation to learn, not needing to answer aloud<br/>
in class or pass a test, I was able to learn.  Readiness, motivation, an<br/>
absence of fear, and a patient and gentle teacher (the book &lt;g&gt;) all added<br/>
up.  <br/>
<br/>
(FYI, what I was doing wrong in long division all those years, and NO<br/>
teacher ever caught:  I was trying to divide the ones into the ones, the<br/>
tens into the tens, the hundreds into the hundreds, etc., rather than the<br/>
whole thing into the other whole thing -- I can&#39;t remember the words!  I was<br/>
so well-drilled in keeping my place values together, I never got that you<br/>
weren&#39;t supposed to do that with division.)<br/>

<br/>
I recently met with the coordinator to talk about what the &quot;real&quot;<br/>
requirements were, and I noticed that she handled all of the subject stuff<br/>
without even bringing it up.  She simply asked about my dd&#39;s interests, had<br/>
a wonderful conversation with my dd, and then she made it all fit into the<br/>
proper schooly subject stuff.  At one point as she was filling in her own<br/>
paperwork she asked if we cook together (this hadn&#39;t come up)... this was<br/>
put down for math.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;language and to avoid subject area language, even, when talking to or in front<br/>

&gt;If she can&#39;t handle that, that would be information for you both.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the coordinator would have a problem treating my dd as a<br/>
friend rather than a student.  As I said, I&#39;ve visited with her a few times<br/>
over the years, and she never questions my dd trying to figure out what she<br/>
knows.  She genuinely takes an interest in whatever my dd is interested in.<br/>
And, she doesn&#39;t seem keen on putting whatever my dd talks about into a<br/>
box, which I like.<br/>

&#39;schooly&#39;, but that is what I got from Sandra&#39;s post.  To me, schooly means<br/>
something you don&#39;t have any choice over or a situation which might lessen<br/>
your own ability.  But then I&#39;ve been thinking recently about how the words<br/>
we use really do set the tone.  For example, to say my dd is a &#39;student&#39;<br/>
implies that someone else will be &#39;teaching&#39; her.  This is schooly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So far no one here seems to think my idea is a bad one.  Anymore feedback?<br/>

**I wouldn&#39;t do it, personally.  My kids would find it an invasion of<br/>
their privacy.  I&#39;d also worry about it affecting their feelings about<br/>
learning (Who are they learning for - themselves or the person they have<br/>
to report to? Is learning measurable?  Should they be learning a certain<br/>

&lt;&lt; Do I read &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; only during British Literature and<br/>
&quot;Little House&quot; only during American Lit., or perhaps during American<br/>
History?  &quot;Little House&quot; covers a lot of subjects.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where does &quot;Little House&quot; as American Lit end, and the social history of the <br/>
19th century, or the geography of the Midwest begin?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The greatest danger, I think, of using a term like &quot;American History&quot; is<br/>
that, having passed the final, a student thinks she&#39;s learned all there is<br/>
to know, or that she never need to worry about that subject again. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a danger.  <br/>
For me the &quot;greatest&quot; danger is that a child will come to categorize things <br/>
school-style, and could decide that she &quot;hates history.&quot;  Or that one thing <br/>
*is* &quot;history&quot; (as opposed to science or religion or geography or politics or art <br/>
or music or biography or background for science fiction or whatever all <br/>
things one incident or story can be tied in to).<br/>
<br/>
Children who go to school are asked &quot;what is your favorite subject?&quot;  Many <br/>
have already decided.  In the absence of ever having been exposed to 90% of what <br/>
will in the future of their school careers come up, an eight year old will <br/>
say &quot;I like science but I hate English&quot; and will mean it, and will attach <br/>
himself to those prejudices, possibly for life.<br/>
<br/>
Poetry and writing and reading and song lyrics and the history of words are <br/>
not the same things.<br/>
<br/>
Egyptology and the VietNam War have VERY little in common, but in school they <br/>
are &quot;the same thing&quot;: history.  They&#39;re not politics or geography or <br/>
archeology or sociology or art or massive drug addiction problems.   They&#39;re &quot;just&quot; <br/>
history.   It&#39;s very, very bad in all ways.<br/>
<br/>
Parents who reject considering these things will not become facile <br/>
unschoolers.  They might become mechanical  unschoolers for a while, but they won&#39;t last <br/>
and flourish.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The coordinator you have sounds amazing!  almost too hard to believe:)  I<br/>
guess my concern would be if she were to leave and you got someone who<br/>
didn&#39;t get it, then you would be in the system and they would have a say<br/>
over what you are doing.  I guess you would just have to weigh the benefits<br/>
with the risks.  <br/>
<br/>
My dd had a brain injury after birth and was put into all kinds of<br/>
&#39;helpful&#39; state programs.  I had to move twice (two different states) to<br/>
get away from some really pushy &#39;help&#39; that wanted her in all kinds of<br/>
special programs.  That was before she was 2.  She is 6 now and unschooled<br/>
and growing, learning and enjoying everyday.  I get freaked out just<br/>
thinking about being back in the &#39;system&#39;.  I&#39;m telling you this so you<br/>
will understand my bias.  It might work out great but find out how you get<br/>
out and if that would be a problem because thinking this  coordinator would<br/>
be there for the next 12 years is probably not realistic and thinking<br/>
everyone out there is like her is not realistic either.  Also, I think<br/>
people are more inclined to help put things in  a schoolly box when they<br/>
are younger.   Will she still consider cooking and gardening (or whatever)<br/>
math when she is in middle school?   <br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts, good luck!<br/>

That&#39;s what I meant. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t use it with your child, but if yo&#39;ure worried about the <br/>
supervisor/whatever she&#39;s called, make sure SHE knows you understand, but that you&#39;re just <br/>
not wanting your child to get into that schoolish habit.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She simply asked about my dd&#39;s interests, had<br/>

<br/>
Good for everybody!<br/>
(She might want to call it science next time to be fair. &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s lots more <br/>
than math.  It can be art, easily.  And &quot;health sciences&quot; / biology / <br/>
cultural studies of many sorts...  History, geography (depends what you&#39;re cooking <br/>
and why).<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was reading Baby Island to Holly and one of the girls made a bag <br/>
pudding.   That&#39;s a big deal.  We discussed it a bit.   In the absence of <br/>
huge fireplaces and cauldrons, bag puddings are not &quot;natural,&quot; so any making of <br/>
one is a historical exercise. &lt;g&gt;  But they&#39;re still traditional in some places <br/>
and families, because it&#39;s a once-a-year thing.<br/>
<br/>
If the coordinator doesn&#39;t need it, then nobody involved needs it !   GOOD!<br/>

why I am trying to get a feel for this idea here on this list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I guess my concern would be if she were to leave and you got someone who<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have to stay &quot;in the system&quot;, not even for a week if we don&#39;t want<br/>
to do it.  CA is pretty flexible, at least so far.  And, this particular<br/>
school district is very supportive of homeschoolers.  They&#39;ve been<br/>
supportive for years (David Colfax&#39;s kids were homeschoolers here more than<br/>
20 years ago.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m telling you this so you will understand my bias.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yes, I can see your POV.  Mind you, no one will be doing any testing<br/>
with my dd in order to classify her, so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be forced to do<br/>
something for her own good according to someone elses criteria.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Will she still consider cooking and gardening (or whatever)<br/>
&gt;math when she is in middle school?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really intend to stick with this for 12 years... that&#39;s an<br/>
expectation of the future that I can&#39;t predict.  I do want to try it as<br/>
long as my dd is interested, and as long as it&#39;s worth the time.  She wants<br/>
to be in their music class right now (and we have to register to be able to<br/>
do it.)  She may decide to do flute or piano lessons instead, and then<br/>
we&#39;ll move on.  (More driving for me, but that&#39;s the downside to living so<br/>
rurally!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as to this particular person... I have no doubt that she supports<br/>
kid&#39;s own interests and will figure out how to make the paperwork fit.  She<br/>
shared a story with me about some of her other kids who are in middle<br/>
school.  She&#39;s been slowly trying to encourage a child-led process with<br/>
this family.  They are currently building some sort of Celtic structure,<br/>
and this one project covers all of the subjects for the rest of the school<br/>
year as far as she is concerned.<br/>

there be &quot;reported&quot; or &quot;measured&quot;, but I hadn&#39;t thought of this particular<br/>
point.  From what I have figured out from my friend, we can pretty much do<br/>
anything we want to whenever we want to, and she will just make it fit the<br/>
paperwork after the fact.  We just need to have physical proof that there<br/>
is a child who is doing &quot;work&quot;, and whatever it happens to be is fine - the<br/>
paperwork will just sit in her filing cabinet for 3 years and then be<br/>
thrown out.  But if the school were audited, she&#39;d be in a heap of trouble<br/>
if it weren&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What does your daughter think about the idea?<br/>

friend who is in school and has learned that teachers tell students what to<br/>
do, and she  is completely against this.  She knows my friend because I<br/>
have visited with her from time to time.  The fact that my friend is at a<br/>
school doesn&#39;t seem to bother my dd.  In fact, she loves to visit; for her<br/>
it is fun, and we always come home with something fun to play with for<br/>
awhile.  This may or may not last, but when it&#39;s not fun anymore then we<br/>
won&#39;t do it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me explore this and for bringing up some important<br/>
points.  For now, I think we&#39;ll try it -- since I know we can leave anytime.<br/>

After reading everyone&#39;s posts I think I get it now.<br/>
 <br/>
And Nancy, you are absolutely right about the need to heal past learning<br/>
issues. I&#39;m certainly a work in progress and really look forward to<br/>
continue learning along side my children! :-D<br/>

pushed into doing something mechanically that they don&#39;t understand <br/>
conceptually.<br/>
<br/>
THIS is why you don&#39;t teach kids HOW to do computations that they don&#39;t <br/>
already understand. If they already understand, then the &quot;how to <br/>
compute&quot; will seem like a blessing to them - they&#39;ll be thrilled. <br/>
Otherwise, they&#39;ll just desperately try to use what they DO understand <br/>
to make sense of what they&#39;re being told to do. Nancy understood place <br/>
value and tried to use THAT to do long division computations.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Nancy, for that explanation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004516273">Hi Barbara.<br/>
<br/>
One thought I had: At the moment the person you have to report to is<br/>
friendly, easy to deal with and supports your unschooling. That could change<br/>
in the future, and you may end up having to deal with someone who is not so<br/>
easy. Would you then have the option of de-registering?<br/>
<br/>
Your reasons for considering registering are good ones, and it may be the<br/>
best choice for you. I wouldn&#39;t choose to give anyone any kind of official<br/>
authority over my homeschooling if I didn&#39;t have to. No way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719974445">Baby Island?!  That used to be my all time favorite book.  I gave my <br/>
old copy to my daughter, and she went through a time when she read it <br/>
over and over.  I&#39;ve read it aloud to her a couple of times too.  We <br/>
just love that book.  One of Darcy&#39;s (dd) dreams is to make a Baby <br/>
Island computer game or maybe a movie.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I just had to comment.  I never hear anyone mention that book, <br/>
and I got a little excited. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;I think when dealing with that person it might be a good time to <br/>
trot the<br/>
&gt; &gt;schooly language out<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In what way?  Or perhaps you are referring to the subject <br/>
requirements of<br/>
&gt; school (like your example of American History.)  Please expand, if <br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; missing it.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s what I meant. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t use it with your child, but if yo&#39;ure worried about the <br/>
&gt; supervisor/whatever she&#39;s called, make sure SHE knows you <br/>
understand, but that you&#39;re just <br/>
&gt; not wanting your child to get into that schoolish habit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;She simply asked about my dd&#39;s interests, had<br/>
&gt; a wonderful conversation with my dd, and then she made it all fit <br/>
into the<br/>
&gt; proper schooly subject stuff.  At one point as she was filling in <br/>
her own<br/>
&gt; paperwork she asked if we cook together (this hadn&#39;t come up)... <br/>
this was<br/>
&gt; put down for math.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good for everybody!<br/>
&gt; (She might want to call it science next time to be fair. &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s <br/>
lots more <br/>
&gt; than math.  It can be art, easily.  And &quot;health sciences&quot; / <br/>
biology / <br/>
&gt; cultural studies of many sorts...  History, geography (depends what <br/>
you&#39;re cooking <br/>
&gt; and why).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I was reading Baby Island to Holly and one of the girls <br/>
made a bag <br/>
&gt; pudding.   That&#39;s a big deal.  We discussed it a bit.   In the <br/>
absence of <br/>
&gt; huge fireplaces and cauldrons, bag puddings are not &quot;natural,&quot; so <br/>
any making of <br/>
&gt; one is a historical exercise. &lt;g&gt;  But they&#39;re still traditional in <br/>
some places <br/>
&gt; and families, because it&#39;s a once-a-year thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the coordinator doesn&#39;t need it, then nobody involved needs <br/>
it !   GOOD!<br/>
