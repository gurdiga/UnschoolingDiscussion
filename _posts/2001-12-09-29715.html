&gt; level&quot; when they were 7-9 or so... most seem to pick that up a lot later,<br/>
&gt; which seems to be natural to me... schools push writing early because<br/>
&gt; they need a quick way to judge a child&#39;s work or knowledge, and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; easier to look at 25 worksheets than talk to 25 kids...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>      Do you mean writing down their thoughts and such or just the mechanics <br/>
of writing? Zoe has been writing since she was 3 1/2. She asked me one day to <br/>
write a letter so she could copy it. It never ended. But I have to spell <br/>
everything for her. She doesn&#39;t read yet. She is 5 1/2. I don&#39;t expect her <br/>
too. She does ask to read w/ me sometimes when I am reading to her. We do <br/>
that for a bit and she tires and tells me to finish. I just finish reading to <br/>
her,no problem. I never coax her or sit her down to read.  W/ math she picks <br/>
stuff up and asks me to help her. We get a pkg. each month w/ a craft and <br/>
book plus  a workbook. I was never thrilled abnout the workbooks and never <br/>
opened them. She began this on her own and asks me for help. I do it. At the <br/>
book store she will choose to buy workbooks over a coloring book. Go figure,I <br/>
never would have done that as a child. This is all her not me,I hate <br/>
workbooks or anything resembling *schooling. But I go w/ her flow. <br/>
<br/>
    So I feel she is doing fine and I have no worries. Others doubt me and <br/>
are really giving me a hard time. telling me my child will be left behind in <br/>
the USA if I don&#39;t sit her down and do her basics w/ her. I don&#39;t believe <br/>
them but I can&#39;t argue my point well w/ my mother who basically thinks I am <br/>
ruining my child&#39;s life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136352470">We all (a bunch of my cousins and I, from one of the old &quot;experts&quot; at a<br/>
family reunion)got the speech once many eons ago, I don&#39;t even remember<br/>
about what but my cousin&#39;s reply always stuck in my mind.  Fortunately I<br/>
never got a chance to use it.  She said, &quot;that&#39;s a strange concept.  All the<br/>
windows I&#39;ve ever had any experience with don&#39;t open and shut only once.<br/>
I&#39;m sure that window will open again for Sonny.&quot;<br/>
