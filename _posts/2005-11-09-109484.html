<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998027666">&lt;I&#39;ve been reading Edward Deci&#39;s book _Why We Do What We Do_. I&#39;ve only<br/>
read the first three or four chapters, but those focus directly on<br/>
studies of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation. I think this speaks<br/>
fairly directly to what you want to know, as unschoolers avoid pushing<br/>
externally motivated learning on their kids. I recommend you see if<br/>
your library has this book, and dip into it a little.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Excellent book!!  This is the book that really helped me with the <br/>
rewards/punishment issue and arbitrary limits!!!<br/>
