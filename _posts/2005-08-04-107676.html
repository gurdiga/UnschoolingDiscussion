<div id="ygrps-yiv-633282908">Hi~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little behind on emails and just read this one.  Don&#39;t remember<br/>
seeing any replies- unless I missed them.  I too would be interested<br/>
in other&#39;s book recommendations.  Scrolling down I see you mentioned<br/>
The Pearls &quot;No Greater Joy&quot; newsletter.  Oh yuck!  You are pretty bold<br/>
to actually subscribe, let alone read it!  Would be a number 1 on my<br/>
DO NOT RECOMMEND list.  Ha!  I was the one from Eugene, Oregon who<br/>
inquired about their presence when they came to town.  I ended up<br/>
attending the speach with the thought that I&#39;d take advantage of open<br/>
question and answer time.  Which they did not have!  Afterwards, you<br/>
could come up on stage and personally ask Micheal Pearl questions. <br/>
Yeah, right, like I was going to do that!  He&#39;d probably wack me.  It<br/>
was definately an eye opener.  Let me tell you- the church was packed.<br/>
 There was standing room only and people were standing outside<br/>
listening through the open window.  People were parked up on the<br/>
grass.  Everyone was dressed nice, smiling, laughing and nodding and<br/>
they brought all their children, including small ones who sat there<br/>
silently through the whole thing, not moving.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, one book I recently have read is Sophie&#39;s World- a history of<br/>
philosophy written by a Norweigan man whose name is slipping my mind<br/>
right now.  It is written for a 14 year girl and is basically an<br/>
exchange of letters and dialogues between this girl and a man who is<br/>
telling her the history of philosophy.  I really enjoyed it, and it<br/>
was a great, simple with complex ideas, refreshener.  It is not really<br/>
about parenting or anything like that, but it is about life and how we<br/>
experience and understand it.  It really changed my outlook<br/>
afterwards.  I felt like I had more tolerance of very religious<br/>
people. I highly recommend it for adults and middle aged to older<br/>
children.  I would be interested in other&#39;s opinions/feedback of the book.<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
If<br/>
anyone here has had their eyes opened in any new and exciting ways by<br/>
books they&#39;ve read in regards to parenting/education/relating to <br/>
people,<br/>
I would appreciate pointers from them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go first ;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our Babies, Ourselves&quot; by Meredith Small<br/>
When my wife and I were burning through our midwife&#39;s library during <br/>
her<br/>
pregnancy we borrowed and read &quot;The Continuum Concept.&quot;  I was<br/>
fascinated, but almost constantly irritated by what felt like<br/>
unsupported leaps of inference and much Freudian baggage.  In googling<br/>
around we came across OBO and got it from the library.  It&#39;s written<br/>
from an anthropology/socio-biology perspective, and explores<br/>
infant/toddler care across cultures.  I spent lots of time feeling<br/>
annoyed by it, but it made me consider all sorts of stuff that I hadn&#39;t<br/>
thought of before, and had a huge long term impact on the range of<br/>
options we could see in how to relate to our child.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Child&#39;s Work&quot; by Nancy Wallace<br/>
I read this a few years before my wife and I were even thinking about<br/>
having children.  At the time it felt fairly radical to me, although<br/>
after reading this list for awhile it might feel pretty &quot;school at<br/>
home&quot;ish.  Although I did OK from an academic perspective I never<br/>
enjoyed or felt safe in school.  Reading the Wallace&#39;s account of doing<br/>
it differently got me to really consider, for the first time in my <br/>
life,<br/>
how one might get away from the structural problems built into our<br/>
concept of school.  It brought up lots of strong emotions from my time<br/>
in school, and got me crying many times reading it and seeing for the<br/>
first time practical solutions to the pain that school was causing for<br/>
someones child.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn<br/>
I think something on this list made me look up Alfie Kohn, and after<br/>
reading a few of the articles on his website I got this book from the<br/>
library.  It&#39;s too long, both in just using too many words to say most<br/>
things, and in repeating itself alot in different sections, but has <br/>
been<br/>
great to read regardless.  As I mentioned in another post recently, <br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
mostly a critique of behaviorist inspired methods of interacting with<br/>
people, with the focus on the problems with positive reinforcement<br/>
(since punishment is just too easy a target?)  He cites *lots* of<br/>
research in this, and I haven&#39;t gotten down to reading any of it yet,<br/>
although I would like to.  It&#39;s helped me think about how to structure<br/>
responses to friends/family that are more skeptical of the more<br/>
non-traditional directions we want to go as parents.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dumbing us Down&quot; by John Gatto<br/>
I also read this when I was closer to being in the school system than<br/>
the parent of someone in it.  Gatto strikes me as a bit strident at<br/>
times, but it also helped me to see the more &quot;medium is the message&quot;<br/>
problem with school at a time when I was waffling more about it.<br/>
Reading Gatto is sort of like reading the works of a religious convert;<br/>
he spent so much time as a &quot;model&quot; teacher, and clearly now looks back<br/>
on it with shame and horror.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No Greater Joy&quot; newsletter by the Pearls<br/>
Many months ago, when the Pearls were going to be giving a seminar in<br/>
Eugene Oregon, I saw a post by someone asking for advice with <br/>
strategies<br/>
for making their displeasure known.  (The Pearls advocate *extremely*<br/>
controlling and conservative parenting from a rigid religious<br/>
perspective, lots of spanking and guilt and molding of blank slates.)  <br/>
I<br/>
found their website while looking for more info, and saw that you can<br/>
subscribe to the newsletter for free.  It&#39;s been a disturbing and<br/>
enlightening sort of &quot;how the other half lives&quot; view (although I kind <br/>
of<br/>
worry what our mail carrier will think of us!)  What&#39;s been hardest for<br/>
me is seeing how clearly the people writing for it are motivated by the<br/>
desire to do the right thing for their children.  Don&#39;t get it if you<br/>
have high blood pressure ;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Finite and Infinite Games&quot; by James Carse<br/>
I liked this one better when I was younger; I just re-read it and it<br/>
seems like it has lots more holes in it&#39;s reasoning and is more reliant<br/>
on cute/clever turns of phrase than when I read it the first time.  <br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
not really about education or parenting except insofar as it&#39;s sort of<br/>
all about intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation, power dynamics, and why<br/>
and how one chooses to live life.  But it is kinda fun, and might give<br/>
you a new way to look at things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people recommend &quot;How To Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So<br/>
Kids Will Talk&quot; and &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot; on the list before.  Any<br/>
comments on what made you like them?  Other book/author <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The two books you mentioned are really easy to read -- they even have<br/>
cartoon panels for &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; ways to handle things with<br/>
kids.  They just provide a great entry into using good communication<br/>
and problem-solving with kids.  They don&#39;t reach the level of<br/>
respectful parenting, though -- often the problem that they&#39;re solving<br/>
is how to get the kid beyond the fact that they can&#39;t have cookie<br/>
right now, or something ridiculous like that.  But the skills<br/>
themselves are the useful part.<br/>
<br/>
I also liked _Parent/Teen Breakthrough:  A Relationship Approach_.  I<br/>
don&#39;t have teens yet but I read it anyway and learned a lot.  It<br/>
starts with the premise that parents really cannot control their<br/>
teens, and they better come to terms with that fact.  I thought that<br/>
was a nice wake-up call to mainstream parenting thought.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s strange at all.   I think it&#39;s one of the best things <br/>
ANYone who thinks she really believes something can do.   Read what its detractors <br/>
say about it.   Without that, it&#39;s just a pep rally.<br/>
<br/>
And in the case of homeschooling (or Christianity), when a personpcan say <br/>
&quot;WHAT!?   Homeschooling is NOTHING like that,&quot; when faced with a report of a <br/>
typical conservative behavior or statement I&#39;d think EVERY homeschooler (or <br/>
Christian) was aware of, it just lets me know that person has a limited view of what <br/>
she&#39;s claiming to espouse.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind when people don&#39;t want to read the craziest opposition, but then <br/>
they should admit they have a limited scope and not   jump to the forefront <br/>
and say &quot;No homeschooling mother would kill her own children with a rock or a <br/>
bathtub.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth knowing the enemies within and without, if you want to really know <br/>
where and who you are.   We exist in a greater context.<br/>
<br/>
But those who might think spanking is not being addressed could follow some <br/>
of the links here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking">http://sandradodd.com/spanking</a><br/>
<br/>
Lots of Christians (and even more non-) are working to educate spanking <br/>
parents away from it.<br/>
<br/>
(Quite a subject-jumping post up above, but I have to go somewhere...)<br/>

Emile,<br/>
I used to recommend those 2...<br/>
I thought they were a good starting point because they focused on <br/>
seeing things from your child&#39;s point of view.<br/>
I learned a lot of language that was more respectful and over time, <br/>
it did become second nature to treat my children with more respect. <br/>
It wasn&#39;t just words!<br/>
<br/>
I have gone on to read other books that I find more useful in terms <br/>
of unschooling, but I still think that they were a good place for me <br/>
to start.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of recommendations, I second all the Kohn, Holt, and Gatto <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently read another book which has given me more <br/>
perspective and more specific tools for my OWN behavior. It is <br/>
written with the idea that we can&#39;t teach that which we do not know. <br/>
It is called &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline&quot; by Becky Bailey.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree with everything she has to say, but the skills and <br/>
change in mindset are top notch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452886190">I was going to suggest the Becky Bailey book Easy to Love, Difficult to <br/>
Discipline as well. One idea from her that we have really integrated is <br/>
that of attributing a positive intention to a child&#39;s behavior even if <br/>
the behavior is problematic, and expressing that to the child. So, for <br/>
instance, if my older son grabs a toy away from my toddler, saying, <br/>
&quot;You wanted to make sure you got to play with that toy as much as you <br/>
wanted to,&quot; or if he grabs a cookie off somebody else&#39;s plate, &quot;wow, <br/>
you are really enjoying those cookies!&quot; You can go on from there with <br/>
whatever &quot;discipline&quot; or problem-solving approach feels right to <br/>
you--we usually focus on alternative strategies for getting that need <br/>
met--but taking the attitude that there is some positive and <br/>
appropriate motivation behind the behavior is good for the parent and <br/>
the child as well. (Think about what a different message that sends <br/>
than an implicit or explicit characterization of the child as &quot;greedy&quot; <br/>
or &quot;grabby&quot; or &quot;selfish.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We also like Bailey&#39;s assertion, as Kiersten mentioned, that you can&#39;t <br/>
teach what you don&#39;t know--another way to think about it is that you <br/>
can&#39;t expect a child to rise to standards of behavior you don&#39;t meet <br/>
for yourself. Bailey would say, you have to discipline yourself first. <br/>
This has helped my partner and me in looking at our own behaviors, and <br/>
in developing expectations of behaviors and treatments that really <br/>
apply to the whole family, not with one (higher) standard for kids and <br/>
another one for adults.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851043829">I also like the book&quot; Easy to Love Difficult to<br/>
Discipline&quot;. The one that hits the nail on the head<br/>
for me though is&quot; Hold on to Your Kids,Why Parents<br/>
Matter&quot; by Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Mate. It is about<br/>
how our kids are peer oriented (kids raising kids with<br/>
no real meaningful relationships). It tell us how to<br/>
keep our kids attached, and tells us how to learn how<br/>
to use our natural intuition. I was very peer<br/>
oriented, so becoming a parent and knowing naturally<br/>
what to do is challenge for me. Especially since I<br/>
have chosen this path and try not to use punishment.<br/>
It is a great book. <br/>

I recognize that peer orientation in schooled kids on his  baseball team, <br/>
though.  <br/>

I think there is a spectrum.  Totally peer oriented on one end, totally self oriented on the other, with most people NOT on the absolute ends.<br/>
<br/>
I see a certain amount of it in my kids.  They do care what their friends think, wear, play with, listen to, etc., but they certainly do not always follow the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, Lisa (12)and Taylor went on a sleepover at a third girl&#39;s house.  Taylor didn&#39;t want Lisa to bring her stuffed bunny.  I could see that Lisa really wanted to bring it, and wasn&#39;t sure what to do with Taylor saying not to.  I jokingly said that Lisa couldn&#39;t go unless bunny went to.  Lisa smiled broadly and grabbed bunny.  Taylor just said, OK.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is an idea I&#39;m having a VERY EXTREMELY difficult time getting across to <br/>
my not-so d, at the moment, h. ;-)  Anyway, does anyone have any stories on <br/>
breakthroughs with your dh or other family members with this concept?  For <br/>
example, he asked ds to see if there was more milk in the fridge the other <br/>
evening...made sense, dh was stuck behind table ds was right next to the <br/>
fridge, ds said he was too tired (he&#39;s 4).  So my dd volunteers but dh has <br/>
to point out that he was disappointed that ds wouldn&#39;t look yada yada...THEN <br/>
a couple of nights later ds wants dh to help him (or rather do it for him) <br/>
build a k&#39;nex something or other.  Dh puts him off says he&#39;ll be there <br/>
shortly, doesn&#39;t whatever gets distracted and I end up building the k&#39;nex <br/>
thing for ds.  What dh doesn&#39;t get is the ds COULDN&#39;T build what he wanted <br/>
and the fact that dh WOULDN&#39;T help affects when ds wants to impose on his on <br/>
level of comfort to do something for ol&#39; dad.<br/>
<br/>
Then dh gets irritated when ds will do something for me that he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily do for dh.  Pk, now here&#39;s the sticky oint.  My dh is the one <br/>
with both dc for the majority of daylight hours...I&#39;ve got to bring him <br/>
around, somehow.  Any thoughts?  Oh, I&#39;m not generally a &quot;gentle&quot; person and <br/>
when I see my dh needlessly putting off one of the dc desires my initial <br/>
reaction is to point out to my dh &quot;right now what your doing is the same <br/>
thing you get so mad about E/R doing to you...&quot; but that just puts everyone <br/>
in a foul mood...so I&#39;m working on it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736133439">My DH is the one at home with DS all day while I WOH fulltime. What <br/>
I generally do is take some private time (we have a date night every <br/>
week and that helps) and reflect back a situation from the week, <br/>
phrased as &quot;If I did... how would you react?&quot; Then I point out that <br/>
it is exactly the same situation that had occurred earlier in the <br/>
week between him and DS. [removing it from the heat of the moment <br/>
helps keep it from boiling over] Mostly, situations occur when DH is <br/>
not actually -thinking- but rather what comes out is the same tape <br/>
that he heard growing up, the same expectation, the same types of <br/>
phrases, etc. One of the *biggest* things that has helped is helping <br/>
DH to see how much alike the two of them are (they are amazingly <br/>
alike right down to the shape of their ear lobes lol). Then, taking <br/>
that a step further and helping DH to recognize how he felt as a <br/>
child. And, for me to recognize that often I am gentle with DS but <br/>
*expect* DH to be at the same place I am in many areas and I&#39;m not <br/>
always so gentle with him because &quot;he&#39;s a grownup&quot;. During one <br/>
particularly bumpy time, DH and I were having a long late night <br/>
talk, and he started crying because he realized he was actually kind <br/>
of envious of DS&#39; freedom, freedom and respect he wishes he had <br/>
received when he was a kid. We&#39;ve got lots of little bits of things <br/>
we do - something as simple as me calling DH a couple times per day <br/>
so he can hear a grownup voice and get a little &#39;pick me up&#39; and an <br/>
ear to bounce situations off of. I usually talk to DS too when I <br/>
call. And both of them can call me at work as needed. We have my <br/>
work number (right down to the extension) on the speed dial so DS <br/>
(he&#39;s 7) can call easily. Both of them are Spirited personalities <br/>
and tend to lock in to a particular opinion/idea/plan - makes for <br/>
very determined, dedicated, focused people but can be a bit sticky <br/>
if they each lock in to an opposite idea. So, I&#39;ll talk to DH, I&#39;ll <br/>
talk to DS, we&#39;ll brainstorm ideas, and eventually DS merrily heads <br/>
off to propose a plan to DH. (arranged that way so DS doesn&#39;t <br/>
perceive it as being told what to do - it&#39;s usually something that <br/>
is within the realm of okay that DH and I have discussed). And, in <br/>
the process, the end result is rarely what we talked about. But, the <br/>
talking allows them to each &#39;unstick&#39; and start to think instead of <br/>
react. <br/>
<br/>
Okay longwindedness summary:<br/>
give DH the same respect and gentleness, sans &quot;expectations&quot;, that <br/>
you give the kids<br/>
talk about things after the fact, once calm has returned, so that <br/>
thinking can occur rather than reacting<br/>
just as you do with the kids, provide positive feedback when you see <br/>
positive change occurring<br/>
give DH the benefit of the doubt as you do with the kids - is he <br/>
hungry? tired? stressed? etc. and address those needs <br/>
setting up principles that apply to the whole household - ours boil <br/>
down to &#39;do no harm&#39; and &#39;be safe&#39; - a whole realm of stuff fits <br/>
under there without having to change rules<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468465860">We have the same situation as Deb and &quot;salamander starr&quot;dh and ds are<br/>
both so intense and their confrontations are equally intense. Lots of<br/>
the situations in our house arise from ds&#39;s (9) sense that he is being<br/>
treated with less respect than he is &quot;supposed&quot; to afford dh. So for<br/>
example, dh expects ds to ask nicely if he wants something, and<br/>
quietly accept it if dh can&#39;t (or won&#39;t) do whatever it isbut dh<br/>
expects ds to jump up and do what he&#39;s told (not even asked) asap. We<br/>
had a big family discussion about this the other day, where finally dh<br/>
listened to ds&#39;s request that dh at least say &quot;please&quot;. But really,<br/>
this usually just means that dh says please, but ds is not allowed to<br/>
say no. So, in this situation, I have been talking to dh about this<br/>
when we have a little quiet time alone. I have pointed out how I think<br/>
that dh falls into a way of treating children without thinking, that<br/>
is very typical in Bolivia, where he is fromon the one hand, many<br/>
children are allowed time and space to play, and are not<br/>
over-programmed or supervised, but they are also expected to drop<br/>
whatever it is that they&#39;re doing and come running if an adult calls<br/>
them, and often it&#39;s for stupid things like the adult is too busy<br/>
talking to bring his/her own glass into the kitchen to be washed.<br/>
Drives me nuts whenever we&#39;re there! So pointing this cultural<br/>
difference out has been fruitful, up until the other day when dh sort<br/>
of half-heartedly tried to justify his  behavior by saying it was<br/>
culturally relative. (Plus, is it so different from the way children<br/>
are treated here, at the core of it?) Couldn&#39;t let that one by, so I<br/>
ever so sweetly asked him to explain to me why it was fine to treat<br/>
children like lesser beings, and that might does not make right,<br/>
period. This point is slowly coming along for dh, so I have to<br/>
celebrate every small step<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that giving dh the same understanding that I give the kids<br/>
is important, i.e. is he tired, stressed, hungry and so does that<br/>
explain why he&#39;s doing this particular thing he&#39;s doing. I have also<br/>
found that it is very important that I let him know what&#39;s going on<br/>
vis-à-vis our evolving unschooling life. For a while there, I was not<br/>
communicating with dh very well at all, about unschooling and living<br/>
by principles, so to him my changing behavior felt like an imposition<br/>
on our once &quot;good-enough&quot; family life. Of course, that had to change,<br/>
and finding time alone to talk was crucial. Usually it was in our<br/>
family bed, once everyone else had fallen asleep, or sometimes 9yo ds<br/>
would still be awake, but downstairs playing or watching tvwe&#39;ve had<br/>
the best conversations in the dark in the middle of the night. (It<br/>
makes me think of Sandra&#39;s essay about leaning on a truck, i.e. having<br/>
a conversation without the intense eye contact can be better<br/>
sometimes). So one important point for us: keeping dh in the loop.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, in the heat of the moment, during those<br/>
confrontations between ds and dh, I cannot stand aside, and bide my<br/>
time to talk about it later. Ds is 9 years old, and both ds and dh are<br/>
spirited (aside: thank you Mary Kurcinka-&quot;spirited&quot; is a much better<br/>
word than others I have heard people use to describe my dear ones!),<br/>
and as Deb said, once they lock in on opposite sides, it&#39;s very<br/>
difficult to get either one of them to cede. Here&#39;s where I differ<br/>
from Deb (or maybe not, I don&#39;t think she addressed what she does in<br/>
the moment)at these times, I do NOT give my dh the same consideration<br/>
if it means that I have to stand back and let the two of them go at<br/>
it, because when it comes right down to it, there is a power imbalance<br/>
in the parent/child relationship in our society, and this plays out in<br/>
the microcosm of my husband&#39;s relationship with my son. I will not let<br/>
dh assert this society-granted power over ds if I can help it. Dh IS<br/>
the adult in the relationship and so HE is the one who needs to figure<br/>
out how to recognise his emotions and not lash out, and recognize that<br/>
little people deserve as much consideration as big people, so as to be<br/>
able to help ds learn to do the same. Dh falls back on the<br/>
authoritarian way that he was parentedor worsebecause he was cared<br/>
for a significant amount by his older siblings (he&#39;s the youngest of<br/>
13, and his mom was ill when he was little, dad busy working)in my<br/>
opinion, and dh agrees with me, the relationship between dh and ds<br/>
sometimes resembles a sibling relationship more than a parent/child<br/>
relationshipI hear the voices of dh&#39;s siblings coming through in the<br/>
way he treats ds sometimes (not all the time, and in fairness to dh,<br/>
he has gotten so much better!).<br/>
<br/>
I figure that we are a family in transition, and for me this means<br/>
that while we are figuring out unschooling and better parenting and<br/>
all, I need to be particularly aware of what&#39;s happening in the<br/>
relationships in our houseif I sense that dh and ds are escalating<br/>
toward a &quot;lock-in&quot;, I try to intervene right away. It&#39;s the only way<br/>
I&#39;ve found to keep the peace. And if I can&#39;t defuse it, then I stand<br/>
in between them (sometimes literally). When I first started doing<br/>
this, it caused a lot of problems between dh and me, he said I was<br/>
being ds&#39;s &quot;lawyer&quot; (how&#39;s that for an adversarial metaphor), and that<br/>
I was undermining the relationship between them (and us). So we talked<br/>
about it, a lot, and sometimes yelled and cried. And I explained that<br/>
in my humble opinion, it was dh&#39;s authoritarian attitude that was<br/>
undermining his relationship with ds. And I pointed out to him that at<br/>
other times, he really admires ds&#39;s independent spirit and refusal to<br/>
bow to authority for authority&#39;s sake. These conversations, removed<br/>
from the moment, are helping. I&#39;m getting better at being aware of<br/>
whether everyone&#39;s needs are being met, and heading off<br/>
confrontations. Dh is coming around, though it feels like two steps<br/>
forward, one step back. But at least we&#39;re on the path.<br/>
<br/>
Gwen<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I&#39;m so looking forward to our first Live and Learn conference,<br/>
and from the way I&#39;ve heard people talk about it, I&#39;m expecting to<br/>
hear the sound of trumpets and a bright light as dh is magically<br/>
transformed into the ideal unschooling/respectful parenting dad. You<br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;m being unrealistic, do you?  ;-)</div>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right - I didn&#39;t really address that situation in my post <br/>
(and BTW did I mention both my guys are Spirited too - DS way high <br/>
on the energy scale, DH needing a lot more space and quiet). I agree <br/>
with you - I don&#39;t stand aside and let it be a knock down dragged <br/>
out situation. I&#39;ll use my &quot;equal status&quot; as an adult to help <br/>
DH &quot;hear&quot; what DS is saying or needing. I&#39;ll draw DH up short and <br/>
get him to stop and think a minute if whatever it is is a hill he <br/>
wants to die on. I also make sure to mirror DH&#39;s feelings and words <br/>
back to him so he feels that he is being heard, that his own needs <br/>
are being included. Then I&#39;ll use my calm Mommy self and draw DS to <br/>
me (physical contact often, not always, but often enough, really <br/>
helps DS when he&#39;s frustrated) and hear him out, reflect back his <br/>
words and emotions so he knows I&#39;m getting it. Then we brainstorm <br/>
together to resolve the situation. Oh, and just to make things <br/>
clear, I don&#39;t always talk to DH first and DS second. Over time, <br/>
they are getting better at listening and hearing each other, taking <br/>
a breath, and trying to find a solution. Generally, it&#39;s when one or <br/>
the other is running low on &#39;fuel&#39; (personal, mental, physical <br/>
energy - not necessarily food needs, sometimes DH needs some space, <br/>
sometimes DS needs to burn pent up energy, whatever) that things get <br/>
sticky. At those times, DH falls back on what he heard growing up <br/>
(parents tell, kids do, no questions, all expectations). It really <br/>
really helped when we went over the Spirited checklist and <br/>
discovered DH is Spirited too - I can frame things as &quot;when you were <br/>
a Spirited little boy, how would you have felt in this situation? <br/>
what would you have wanted to happen?&quot; One important piece to this <br/>
is that *someone* has to stay sane. So, if I let myself get hungry <br/>
or run down, it can get really nuts. DH and I joke that only one of <br/>
us is allowed to be crazy at a time. Of course, sometimes I&#39;m tired <br/>
and frustrated from work or whatever and easily irritated. DH will <br/>
suggest that he and DS go play a favorite video game or something so <br/>
I can get some space to breath and regain equilibrium.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, whole days of calm are becoming so much more common <br/>
now that (a) DS is 7 (ages 3 and 5 were most difficult) that when <br/>
there&#39;s a major meltdown, it dissipates faster because there&#39;s a <br/>
reservoir of calm to take the heat out. Kind of the difference <br/>
between riding down a washed out gravel road where you&#39;re constantly <br/>
bumping and bouncing and jouncing and hitting one pothole in a long <br/>
sttretch of smooth pavement - it&#39;s jarring but it&#39;s over quickly and <br/>
back to smooth again.<br/>

I also make sure to mirror DH&#39;s feelings and words <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the part that I need to work on. DS, after so many incidents<br/>
in which his father won&#39;t take no for an answer to a command, has an<br/>
immediate and sometimes frighteningly intense reaction to some<br/>
requests, especially if he&#39;s upset for any other reason, hungry,<br/>
tired, frustratedso he&#39;ll lash out in a way that seems out of<br/>
proportion, and sometimes uncalled for (like yelling &quot;leave me alone&quot;<br/>
when dh asks him if he wants something to drink). In the ensuing<br/>
melee, if I don&#39;t respond to dh&#39;s need to not be screamed at, etc.,<br/>
then I can&#39;t really help defuse the situation because now he&#39;s upset<br/>
with me too. I was having a really hard time with this for a couple<br/>
months earlier this year, combined with the stresses of money and<br/>
getting ready to move across the country. It was making dh feel like<br/>
he wasn&#39;t really part of my little &quot;mama and babies&quot; world; I really<br/>
had to let go of that, and make it a priority to help him improve his<br/>
relationship with ds. I&#39;m more conscious of it now, and I hope I&#39;m<br/>
getting better at it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then I&#39;ll use my calm Mommy self and draw DS to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; me (physical contact often, not always, but often enough, really <br/>
&gt; helps DS when he&#39;s frustrated)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lately, ds is no longer responding to physical contact, at least when<br/>
he&#39;s already gone past upset to angry (something that seems to take<br/>
relatively little time these days). I was reading that the amygdala,<br/>
that helps control emotional impulse, in pre-teen and teenage boys is<br/>
proportionately three times larger than in adultsI wonder if this is<br/>
contributing to ds&#39;s recent tendency to have outbursts (well, that<br/>
plus we&#39;re moving in two weeks!). It seems as though if I can catch<br/>
him when he&#39;s starting to get upset, I can help, but he has a point of<br/>
no return, after which he doesn&#39;t respond to touch, empathy,<br/>
breathing, water (in a glass, to drink!), or anything else that I&#39;ve<br/>
tried. I haven&#39;t figured out how to deal with it yethe used to<br/>
respond to reason, even when upset. <br/>
<br/>
As soon as we get to our new home, I&#39;m looking for a karate dojo for<br/>
him...I have a feeling that will be good for him, plus I want to do it<br/>
too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah - getting past the whole disruption for everyone of moving and <br/>
settling in and all will probably help a bunch. Sometimes, I&#39;ll <br/>
simply tell DS when he&#39;s gotten to where nothing  helps (words, <br/>
touch, etc) that I&#39;ll be right here as soon as he is ready to talk <br/>
about it. Then I suggest he go stomp on the stairs (hardwood steps <br/>
make really loud stomps and echoes in the hallway) or slam his door <br/>
or bounce of the mini-trampoline or something - direct his energy to <br/>
something safe for everyone until he can handle words, touch, etc. <br/>
If he is lashing out physically, I&#39;ll tell him &quot;I can&#39;t stay here <br/>
and be hit so I&#39;ll be in the kitchen (my room, wherever) when you <br/>
are ready to be around people again.&quot; Over time, this has worked <br/>
well - he has started taking himself off to stomp or bounce or run <br/>
laps around the yard or the basement or whatever. Sometimes he&#39;ll <br/>
say &quot;I need time alone&quot; and head off to another room where he can <br/>
yell or stomp or simply cool off a bit. Then we talk about it when <br/>
he&#39;s ready. In the meanwhile, I can usually talk with DH and find <br/>
out what happened (if I wasn&#39;t there) and help him figure out what <br/>
happened and develop a strategy together for the situation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an idea I&#39;m having a VERY EXTREMELY difficult time getting <br/>
across to<br/>
my not-so d, at the moment, h. ;-)  Anyway, does anyone have any <br/>
stories on<br/>
breakthroughs with your dh or other family members with this concept?  <br/>
For<br/>
example, he asked ds to see if there was more milk in the fridge the <br/>
other<br/>
evening...made sense, dh was stuck behind table ds was right next to <br/>
the<br/>
fridge, ds said he was too tired (he&#39;s 4).  So my dd volunteers but dh <br/>
has<br/>
to point out that he was disappointed that ds wouldn&#39;t look yada <br/>
yada...THEN<br/>
a couple of nights later ds wants dh to help him (or rather do it for <br/>
him)<br/>
build a k&#39;nex something or other.  Dh puts him off says he&#39;ll be there<br/>
shortly, doesn&#39;t whatever gets distracted and I end up building the <br/>
k&#39;nex<br/>
thing for ds.  What dh doesn&#39;t get is the ds COULDN&#39;T build what he <br/>
wanted<br/>
and the fact that dh WOULDN&#39;T help affects when ds wants to impose on <br/>
his on<br/>
level of comfort to do something for ol&#39; dad.<br/>
<br/>
Then dh gets irritated when ds will do something for me that he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily do for dh.  Pk, now here&#39;s the sticky oint.  My dh is the <br/>
one<br/>
with both dc for the majority of daylight hours...I&#39;ve got to bring him<br/>
around, somehow.  Any thoughts?  Oh, I&#39;m not generally a &quot;gentle&quot; <br/>
person and<br/>
when I see my dh needlessly putting off one of the dc desires my <br/>
initial<br/>
reaction is to point out to my dh &quot;right now what your doing is the <br/>
same<br/>
thing you get so mad about E/R doing to you...&quot; but that just puts <br/>
everyone<br/>
in a foul mood...so I&#39;m working on it.<br/>
<br/>
=--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I got this a lot sooner than my husband, Ben. When Cameron was a baby, <br/>
I would ask Ben whether he remembered being three or eight or eleven. <br/>
Could he remember what it was like? Could he IMAGINE what it was like <br/>
if he couldn&#39;t remember? I&#39;d say, &quot;He&#39;s only four.&quot; (or nine or 13 or <br/>
whatever)<br/>
<br/>
That never seemed to work! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With Duncan I tried something different. Ben would say things like, <br/>
&quot;He&#39;s five, he should know better!&quot; *I* would counter with, &quot;Well, <br/>
*you* are 38! At what age do you think you should have figured this <br/>
out? Duncan is only five; you have had many more years to work this <br/>
out, and yet you are still arguing with a five year old. The sooner you <br/>
can figure it out, the sooner *he* will! Model the behavior you want to <br/>
see!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He would also often ask why Cameron was more willing to do for me than <br/>
for him. I&#39;d say that Cameron was used to seeing me do for him---he was <br/>
just reciprocating and modelling my behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Ben&#39;s got it now. He sometimes has to nudge *me* in the right <br/>
direction! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

P.S. I&#39;m so looking forward to our first Live and Learn conference,<br/>
and from the way I&#39;ve heard people talk about it, I&#39;m expecting to<br/>
hear the sound of trumpets and a bright light as dh is magically<br/>
transformed into the ideal unschooling/respectful parenting dad. You<br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;m being unrealistic, do you?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>

Ordering those damned trumpets now! Geez!!!<br/>

<br/>
Yep, I&#39;ve said the same thing...except 41, but that&#39;s not important <br/>
right now. My main point was that we have been modeling the wrong <br/>
way before this and we need to model the right way for quite a while <br/>
before expecting the kids to pick up on it and even longer for them <br/>
to do it consistantly. <br/>
<br/>
Modeling &quot;I&#39;ll be nice and ask for your help...as long as you agree <br/>
quickly to do what I say otherwise I&#39;m going to get upset&quot; is not <br/>
anywhere near as effective as modeling &quot;I&#39;ll be nice and ask for <br/>
help and stay pleasant no matter what your reaction (within reason) <br/>
because I think it&#39;s a good way to treat people.&quot;<br/>

Right.<br/>
<br/>
It took me far to long to figure this out, but lots of time when I&#39;m <br/>
&quot;asking&quot; for household help I am (or at least I WAS) really &quot;telling&quot;, <br/>
because I wasn&#39;t taking &quot;no&quot; for an answer. <br/>
