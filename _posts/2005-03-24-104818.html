I grew  up eating what I wanted when I wanted.  I was the most <br/>
unschooled  child you ever saw, simply because of circumstance of <br/>
growing up in an  abusive household.  I had to figure out how to  <br/>
survive.<br/>
Uh...<br/>
No. You are NOT the most unschooled child I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>
You&#39;re not a child, so get over it.  If you didn&#39;t learn anything  about your <br/>
body&#39;s real needs, that&#39;s unfortunate, but learn it now and LIVE it  now.<br/>
 <br/>
The most unschooled children I have seen eat what they think they need when  <br/>
they&#39;re hungry, not &quot;what they want when they want.&quot;  They don&#39;t eat just  to <br/>
do it.<br/>
 <br/>
THe most unschooled children I&#39;ve ever seen NEVER had to &quot;figure out how to  <br/>
survive.&quot;  They are attended to by adults who have dedicated their lives to  <br/>
helping them grow up in the most ideal way possible.<br/>
 <br/>
To equate having been neglected to being &quot;the most unschooled&quot; is so far  <br/>
beyond the bounds of the definition of unschooling on which this list operates  <br/>
and the guideline to consider, before posting, whether your post will help  <br/>
others understand unschooling that I don&#39;t even want to drive out of the  <br/>
ballpark and go and measure how far out of the neighborhood it went.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- just eat <br/>
another snickers and I perk right up.  Is it  logical?  no.  Should I <br/>
do that to my body? no.  Does it make  me feel good?  no.  But it <br/>
tastes good and that&#39;s the way I have  always eaten. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
You will not help your children by modelling that.<br/>
Do you want to help your children or not?<br/>
 <br/>
You will not help your children learn to decide by controlling them.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I want my kids <br/>
to have choices within the limits that I know their  bodies need -=-<br/>
 <br/>
By your own account, you don&#39;t even know what YOUR body needs.<br/>
It&#39;s highly likely you&#39;re wrong about what theirs need.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I want my kids <br/>
to have choices within the limits that I know their  bodies need and <br/>
when they are older they will have that pattern set into  them that <br/>
they know they feel like crap -=-<br/>
 <br/>
WHAT?<br/>
Does<br/>
not<br/>
even<br/>

Today, I usually make bad food choice.  not because sweets <br/>
were held  back, or because I didn&#39;t get enough mc. donalds when I <br/>
wanted it, but  because I have a taste for it.  I don&#39;t care that I <br/>
was so tired  today because I forgot to eat yesterday.  I just eat <br/>
another snickers  and I perk right up.  Is it logical?  no.  Should I <br/>
do that  to my body? no.  Does it make me feel good?  no.  But it  <br/>
tastes good and that&#39;s the way I have always eaten.  I want my kids  <br/>
to have choices within the limits that I know their bodies need and  <br/>
when they are older they will have that pattern set into them that  <br/>
they know they feel like crap so they better do something about  it.<br/>
