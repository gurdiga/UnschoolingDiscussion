<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427068026">my 4 year old often goes to bed after me and puts himself to bed when he&#39;s<br/>
ready.   his dad stays up late to work (computer graphics stuff) and he stays<br/>
up and works on our 2nd computer side by side.  his normal or average time is<br/>
11ish.  my therory is that he was born around 9 pm and by the time all had<br/>
settled it was around11pm so his first time sleeping after being born happens<br/>
to be his preferred time to sleep.  who knows<br/>

&gt; &gt; My kids are sometimes up until 2 AM<br/>
&gt; &gt; AM I alone!<br/>
&gt; No, you&#39;re definitely not alone on this one.  I seem to have given birth<br/>
