<br/>
OH NO!  I&#39;ve just jumped on Coca Cola detractors.<br/>
Is that political?  Personal?<br/>
<br/>
No, it has to do with careful thought and reporting--that same old critical <br/>
thinking stuff.  &quot;Does that seem right?&quot; is a good thing to ask kids, and to <br/>
ask myself!<br/>
<br/>
My kids will come home and say &quot;Jon says this,&quot; or &quot;Jesse told us...&quot; and I <br/>
very often say &quot;Does that seem right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They think.  They respond with something, or &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Where did Jesse/Jon/whoever hear that, do you think?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Very often it unravels as just something the kid pulled out of nowhere to <br/>
have something to say.  They need to consider that ANY information *could* be <br/>
made up on the spot, and so they need to figure out other ways to decide <br/>
whether it&#39;s worth trying to confirm, whether it&#39;s the sort of thing that <br/>
just makes logical sense (like how to turn the water off to a whole house, <br/>
which kids had to do at the neighbor&#39;s house the other day and they borrowed <br/>
the tool from us), whether it&#39;s something said out of fear... this is <br/>
rhetoric.  Knowing rhetorical devices (not necessarily formally, by name, but <br/>
being aware that they exist) and being on the lookout for purposeful or <br/>
accidental falsehood is a BIG part of thinking, and of judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it involves the probity or reputation of the source.  <br/>
