Subject: Re: I need some help... from someone new to unschooling (ideas to <br/>
encourage)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a single son who is 5 years old. I had planned the first 8<br/>
weeks of his kindergarten but then after the first day of making him<br/>
sit down and learn and him and I both being miserable we moved on to<br/>
do our own thing.<br/>
<br/>
  My son is really into dinosaurs. So we use this love for dinosaurs<br/>
for his learning. We encourage him to count his dinos . He groups<br/>
them into catergories. He knows what a carnivore is and a herbavore.<br/>
I have read countless books to him and that lead to furthure<br/>
questions and more books. He now knows what an astroid is.<br/>
<br/>
   He has a great sense of geogrqaphy from looking at the maps of<br/>
where the dinosaurs lived and where the fossils are found. He knows<br/>
about skeltons now because I read him a book on skeltons in people.<br/>
We have done some measurement- like footprints.<br/>
<br/>
   He does worksheets (he likes them- i think because it gives him a<br/>
great sense of acomplishment)<br/>
<br/>
  We also do most of our reading before we go to bed. I cannot tell<br/>
you the number of times that he refuses to do any reading all day<br/>
then suddenly wants to read at night. Some people are sharpest at<br/>
night and if my son is one of them, how would he acomplish much<br/>
schoolwork during th day?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   From this I would take each of your older child&#39;s interests<br/>
seperately. Get books on that interest. Encourage him/her to ask<br/>
questions. This will lead to more books or experiments.<br/>
<br/>
  We also started a wall caterpilliar. I made a face for a<br/>
caterpilliar from small paperplates. I taped it to the wall and made<br/>
another plate with the number 1 and the word one on it. We counted to<br/>
one. Yes he can count more than that but I still wanted to start at<br/>
one. Each day we add another number and count to the number and stop.<br/>
I was shocked to, one day on the way out the door to go to the park,<br/>
he stopped me telling me we cannot go because we have to add a new<br/>
number on the wall! We are now up to 25 and we do this daily.<br/>
  <br/>
      What does your 8 year old play? Does she play with her barbies?<br/>
does he play with his cars? Does she put all the Barbie shoes in a<br/>
box or pile together? Maybe he has a pile of cars with vans in one<br/>
pile and cars in another? Maybe he plays with the matchbox size cars<br/>
together sometimes and the bigger Tonka trucks together at other<br/>
times, if so, they are doing math! If you play cars with him or<br/>
Barbies with her, ask for specific items. &quot;Honey I need the vans<br/>
now.&quot; or the high heeled shoes, or whatever. They are grouping<br/>
objects.<br/>
   We went for a walk at the park last night. We let Jonah ride his<br/>
scooter. My husband told him: &quot;Go the lightpost number two which is<br/>
the 2nd one, and wait for us. This taught him to follow directions,<br/>
and the numbers being used as 1st, 2nd ect. and best of all he loved<br/>
it! I went home and put it in the book I am writing in.<br/>
<br/>
   The video games your children play- they are learning! If it is<br/>
not some skill to it then why is my son better than me at it?<br/>
<br/>
   Think of the family games you have. For instance we have hungry<br/>
hungry hippo. Here he needs to count the numbers of marbles each of<br/>
us have after the hippos gobble them up to determine the winner. He<br/>
is doing Math. We also do the letter of the week and I get all the<br/>
books I can find on the subjects with that letter. Last week we<br/>
learned about Christopher Columbus, cats, crickets, cows. I figure<br/>
this opens his world to find other interests. if the book is making<br/>
him miserable we do not read it. We get lots of different books<br/>
audios and videos from the library- I cannot stress the library<br/>
enough. We go to three different library&#39;s a week and I fill the huge<br/>
book bag fully.<br/>
<br/>
   Talk to your children- tell them things. We read both non-fiction<br/>
and fiction and so I taught him the difference of the two.<br/>
<br/>
   Pokeman cards. Have your children write a story about Pokeman-  if<br/>
they cannot write then you dictate it. Count the cards. Do they have<br/>
numbers? Put them in numural order. What number comes after...?<br/>
Before? Make a pokeman cake and have them help you measure things-<br/>
lots of math here! I admit we are not to Pokeman yet. Can they be<br/>
divided into catergories? Do they divide them up between themselves?<br/>
Can they be bought for money somehow? Can they be used to<br/>
measurements? How many Pokeman cards long is Adams bed? Is there any<br/>
geography in Pokeman? Show them a map where Pokeman is from. If it is<br/>
fiction place, then make their own map or drawing of what the place<br/>
might look like.<br/>
<br/>
   Have them help with groceries at the grocery store. Count things<br/>
aloud in front of them, do math problems aloud so they see you do<br/>
them. Spell the words of signs you see aloud so they see you<br/>
spelling. When reading, if the word is repeated say : This word<br/>
says &quot;Go&quot; so what does this word say: and point to he other word that<br/>
says go. <br/>
   <br/>
    I am new to this line of thought, but believe me it works. It<br/>
truly is unbelieveable, but it does work.<br/>
If you do like my ideas and want to e-mail me for more ideas on a<br/>
more personal level I will be happy to help you on a more custom<br/>
level.<br/>
