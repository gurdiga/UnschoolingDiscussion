<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114301820">I know the links below are all in the U.S., but I&#39;ll be speaking lots of places in the next year and a half--three continents (four if North America is going to count), once with Bea Mantovani and Claire Darbaud translating and answering questions in French, several times with Joyce Fetteroll, maybe next year Alex Polikowsky will come to help Marta Pires translate and answer questions in Portugal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979565008">Confusion/correction.  <br/>
I&#39;m sorry.  I thought I had noted this, but I hadn&#39;t.  <br/>
I&#39;m not speaking at the east Tennessee camp. <br/>
