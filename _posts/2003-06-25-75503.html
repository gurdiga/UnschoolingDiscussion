&lt;&lt; Some folks on this group want to make it <br/>
<br/>
seem like it is an &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; standpoint.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You mean as opposed to approving of parents who make an &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot; with <br/>
their parenting?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Either you unschool <br/>
<br/>
by AP, no rules, no bedtimes, no chores, no restrictions.. OR you are <br/>
<br/>
NOT an unschooler. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that either.  <br/>
Yet your examples are unfair and unrealistic.   We have a bag of chocolate <br/>
chips in the pantry in plain view.  Nobody would eat them without asking if they <br/>
were saved for something soon.  Yet my kids COULD if they wanted ask me to <br/>
buy a bag of chocolate chips expressly for them to eat.  But none of them ever <br/>
has.<br/>
<br/>
So there IS something to this weird parenting stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Folks on this group openly admit they have an arbitrary set <br/>
<br/>
of &quot;guidelines&quot; that define unschooling &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think arbitrary means what you think it means.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a set of guidelines, its observance of the workings of a <br/>
principle.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How about an unschooling group that does not discriminate based on <br/>
<br/>
rank?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could start your own.  Yahoogroups makes it really easy to start a group. <br/>
 You could advertise it here!  But you would HAVE to be the listowner; <br/>
yahoogroups can&#39;t work without a listowner.  The listowner outranks spammers, <br/>
straight up.<br/>
