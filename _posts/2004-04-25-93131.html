<div id="ygrps-yiv-444859819">&quot;Hi&quot; back to Danielle,<br/>
<br/>
You trouble maker!!  I too enjoyed Daniel Pink&#39;s talk and I got a free autographed book!  I am reading it now.  I am wondering if his kids will stay in school also.  I did enjoy listening to the HS &quot;graduates&quot; discuss their paths.  I loved sitting next to some unschoolers at the resource booth.  I enjoyed listening to a few veteran unschoolers counsel newbies in the unschooler chat area. I did not make it to any of the unschooler workshops/discussions. There was still a blur between unschooling and eclectic homeschooling (one workshop had curriculum info???). <br/>
I can&#39;t wait for Live and Learn and the &quot;real thing&quot;!<br/>
