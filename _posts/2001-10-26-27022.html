<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215732238">The only part the media played in my wanting to do  something concerning the <br/>
9/11 tragedy was to bring it to my attention. Before this particular <br/>
incident I and my family are active trying to make a difference in other <br/>
areas. I think it is important (IMO), to teach our children that one person <br/>
can make a huge impact on the world, and to try to give what is needed as <br/>
you are able.<br/>

I think the media is convincing us that we, as Americans, must do something <br/>
to help, somehting to show our patriotism.  And I think the media, and peer <br/>
pressure are convincing many people that NOT giving money to the rc or <br/>
whoever is pretty much unAmerican.<br/>
<br/>
So, you want to do something...but what?  We are so stuck on this immediate <br/>
gratification thing.  What I feel I need to do is not going to happen <br/>
overnight.  I need to practice wha tthis tragedy has taught me all the days <br/>
of my life.  Not just during this immediate crisis.<br/>
<br/>
I need to practice tolerance, I need to teach it to my children.<br/>
<br/>
I need to practice giving, I need to teach my dhildren to give.<br/>
<br/>
I need to sacrifice,  I need to teach my children to sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
I need to pray, I need to teach my children to pray.<br/>
<br/>
I need to be willing to do the small stuff in my own neighborhood to promote <br/>
unitedness,  I need to be proud of being an American---every day.  I need to <br/>
sing God Bless America, I need to pledge allegiance to the flag from now <br/>
until my death I need to do these things.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so easy to act in times of crisis...the hard part comes when the crisis <br/>
is over...What will you do then?<br/>
