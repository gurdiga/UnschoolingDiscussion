It&#39;s a simple reason. I&#39;m a single parent who teaches full-time at a local <br/>
university. If I pull my son out of school without planning how I&#39;m going to <br/>
handle the practical details of the switch, my son may end up going from the <br/>
&quot;frying pan into the fire.&quot;   The decision to homeschool was made only last <br/>
week, though philosophically it&#39;s been coming a long time.  He&#39;s only got 12 <br/>
weeks of standard school left, during which time I can debrief him every day <br/>
and keep his hopes up about next year.  I especially have to figure out how <br/>
I&#39;m going to get him to be with other children his age since he likes <br/>
socializing even though he acts younger than his age. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the rest of you do for kids who have special needs (there <br/>
are certain expensive special ed services my son needs -- like speech therapy <br/>
for articulation). The public school district must provide them, but they <br/>
will do so more readily if they think he&#39;s coming back next year than if they <br/>
think he&#39;s &quot;off their hands.&quot;  We have a meeting with the school staff about <br/>
those decisions before the end of the school year and I&#39;m keeping the topic <br/>
of homeschooling a secret from everyone but my son in the meantime. No one <br/>
has to know why he&#39;s secretly smiling during the school day ;-)<br/>

Hi, Carrie --<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about homeschooling is that there isn&#39;t any built-in age<br/>
segregation.  If your son acts younger than his age, he can play with<br/>
children of that younger age.  Or a mixed group of kids, both younger<br/>
and older, but not obsessed with being cool and precocious.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck finding homeschooling groups in your area.  If you and your<br/>
son have the same week off for spring break, you may be able to check<br/>
out a local group&#39;s park day before June.  (I won&#39;t pressure you to take<br/>
your son out of school until you are ready, but go ahead and make<br/>
contact with local homeschoolers as soon as you can.  They really are a<br/>
great resource.)<br/>

finish out the year, no good reason, just have to finish.<br/>
