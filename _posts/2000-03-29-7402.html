 </span></blockquote>Thanks for your concern Brooke.  Unfortunately it is much too dangerous for him to get into the habit of helping himself while he is still too young to monitor his diet choices.  If he decides to help himself when he is NOT at home (like at Grandma&#39;s or a friends) well, you get the idea.  Maybe when he is older, and or reading and is armed with more complete knowledge of what he can and cannot eat.  Some of his allergies are severe enough to not give us second chances if he makes a mistake now.  Others are less severe.<br/>

&gt;previously-unquestioned belief about the &quot;necessity&quot; for 3 meals a day!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I understand that, and I feel the same way about it.  I was simply giving another perspective on it.  I feed my kids on demand and we eat small meals many times a day.  Dinner is usually around the same time each night, but that is more out of convenience than any need for scheduling.  We all eat when we are hungry.  It means I am hopping around fetching and cleaning meals a lot, but since my two are still mastering silverware and are not even close to having cups down pat, there is a lot of clean up for me no matter what.  I don&#39;t mind.  It&#39;s worth it for my son&#39;s safety.<br/>
