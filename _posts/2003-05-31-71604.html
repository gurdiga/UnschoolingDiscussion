&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think Charlton Heston has ever done anything the least bit slimey <br/>
in <br/>
real life. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do. And so very slimey, that hearing the name makes my stomach turn. Is <br/>
(was) he a great actor? No doubt. Good looking? No doubt. Charisma and <br/>
what-have-ya? No -none at all- doubt. A slimey person in real life? Up in the top % of <br/>
*as slimey as they get*.    Lara.......  who tried to hit the delete as to not <br/>
start this, but who in fact feels very strongly<br/>
<br/>
Nevermind, not done, I&#39;ll bite (I&#39;m usually very good at not biting, but will <br/>
today because I just feel like it I guess).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He is still with his wife who is the first woman he ever dated. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So? Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not slimey! <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He raised his kids nicely and did all kinds of physical family vacations <br/>
with <br/>
them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s &quot;nicely&quot; mean? Whatever it is, it still doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not slimey. <br/>
Physical family vacas? Still doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not slimey.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He was good to his mother, and his step father, and his sister. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, though those are all very noble traits, it still doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not <br/>
slimey.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He researched his historical parts and characters and locations himself, <br/>
instead of <br/>
just showing up and taking someone else&#39;s word for it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That makes him a good *actor*. What does that have to do with slimeyness?<br/>
<br/>
I happen to like/disslike people for who they *are*. (How they are in our <br/>
world. Who they are. What they stand for. What they say. Their beliefs. How they <br/>
treat people who are different. And so on.) Not if they&#39;re a great actor. So <br/>
yes, my first reaction to Charlton Heston, is eeeeeeewwwwwww, because he&#39;s so <br/>
slimey.  Lara............  who is done now</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98751625">well, you mention the things that he does well, and the opinion that <br/>
these things don&#39;t make him slimey...but you don&#39;t say what he does <br/>
that DO make him slimey.<br/>
<br/>
So, what does Charlton Heston do that you think makes him slimey?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I read Kathryn&#39;s post after I posted my question to you. One <br/>
thing about Yahoo: It is VERY difficult to follow a thread all the <br/>
way to the top, esp. if you tend to leave for a day and come back in <br/>
the middle of something. Is there a post about Bowling for Columbine <br/>
that I should read before posting further? L<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, these are things that Heston has SAID, not done. I don&#39;t <br/>
have an opinion one way or the other, except he seems conservative <br/>
and I lean towards conservative/libertarian, and therefore I am maybe <br/>
inclined not to dislike him for that reason. For the same reason a <br/>
liberal politics person would overlook some slimey things about <br/>
favorite liberal leaders (Can&#39;t think of any right now... <br/>
hahahahahaha! Kidding!): because they agree with that person&#39;s <br/>
politics, they overlook the ugly things they do or say. eh? Ring <br/>
true, anyone? Certainly does for me! <br/>

He did DO things too, that were pointed out in B for C. Besides, I think the <br/>
things he&#39;s SAID are just as bad!!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; For the same reason a <br/>
<br/>

I did overlook his slimeyness to say he was indeed a good actor.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; because they agree with that person&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
politics, they overlook the ugly things they do or say. eh? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is THE politics I don&#39;t agree with. Not his acting ability!!   <br/>
<br/>
If you agree with what all he&#39;s said and done, fine. No argument from me. But <br/>
I don&#39;t, and therefore I have the reaction eeeeeeeeewwwwwwww when I hear his <br/>
name.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864347022">And just to keep things interesting.Harrison Ford divorced his first<br/>
wife in 1979, married Mathieson in &#39;83. My guess would be possibly<br/>
unrelated events. Evidently Ford has been honored on numerous occasions<br/>
for his environmental/conservation work including having an ant species<br/>
named for him, and being asked to name a new butterfly. Also sometimes<br/>
pilots for seach and rescue missions. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I have two points: the first is research can change ones view of<br/>
things. BTW, bringing the topic back vaguely to education ;) , Ford was<br/>
a college dropout, and is described as a &quot;lackluster&quot; C average student<br/>
in high school, but a self taught carpenter - still practicing the<br/>
craft. <br/>
<br/>
The second point; I reiterate that we aren&#39;t in their homes - all we see<br/>
is the public face. These guys are actors, remember. <br/>
<br/>
I love The Internet Movie Data Base  www.imdb.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/">http://www.imdb.com/</a>&gt;<br/>

I was just telling my husband that I&#39;m glad I waited to post on this<br/>
one because I tend to get over emotional on these things (politics)<br/>
and don&#39;t say what I really mean.  I just ramble on and never make my<br/>
point.  You said exactly what I wanted to say.  I too am conservative<br/>
(extremely so) and sometimes feel as though I&#39;m the only one on this<br/>
list who is.  :)   I like Charlton Heston (not his acting) and happen<br/>
to agree with most of what he says...hoping this dosen&#39;t get me in too<br/>
much hot water here.  <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I like his acting, and I don&#39;t think it should matter to movie lovers what <br/>
the beliefs, sexual preferences, marital status or diet of the actors are.  When <br/>
he played El Cid he was being El Cid.  Like or don&#39;t like El Cid, like or <br/>
don&#39;t like the script, but what should it matter what the actor believes about <br/>
guns which weren&#39;t invented in the middle ages?<br/>
<br/>
He played Marc Antony in Julius Ceasar.  Where do politics come into that?  <br/>
Roman politics?  Elizabethan politics?  Screen Actor&#39;s Guild politics?   Why, <br/>
though, modern American politics?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me NOT to be about acting but about identification.  Something <br/>
creepy and scary, like human sacrifice.  Like some (modern fan public??) wanting <br/>
to find a perfect specimen to worship, and if he fails (by divorce or bad <br/>
attitude or wearing fur or eating meat) KILL HIM!!!! Kill his reputation, at <br/>
least, and then we all will feel... what?   Superior?  Knowledgeable?<br/>
<br/>
It would amuse me if it were funny.<br/>
<br/>
While it is true that art can serve a political end, not all art is <br/>
political.   And when it is not being political, should the fact that the guy holding <br/>
the brush is a lech or a lush affect whether we will say the flowers are <br/>
realistic or the colors are moving?<br/>

You&#39;re right.  I&#39;ve said at least 100 times over the years &quot;I like<br/>
him/her but I don&#39;t have to live with them.&quot;  We don&#39;t know what<br/>
REALLY goes on when they are alone and behind closed doors.  All we<br/>
are allowed to see is the movies that &quot;they&quot; act in and what the PR<br/>
people want us to see and hear.  <br/>
<br/>
I, personally, don&#39;t pay a whole lot of attention to what celebrities<br/>
say (be it about politics or anything else).  The only time I really<br/>
perk up and listen is when one of them is very outspoken about their<br/>
beliefs.  In the same why that I would listen to anyone who is as<br/>
outspoken as Charleton Heston.  I&#39;ve perked up and listened to several<br/>
non famous people (who&#39;s names escape me at the moment), especially<br/>
lately with everything that&#39;s going on with Iraq.  I live in CA and<br/>
there are PLENTLY of people to listen to right now. <br/>
<br/>
My point was simply that I agree with his politics (at least those<br/>
points of view that he makes public), it makes no difference to me<br/>
weather or not he is famous.  I would agree with him if he was simply<br/>
the guy next door.  Just as I don&#39;t agree with Susan Serandon&#39;s<br/>
politics, as I wouldn&#39;t if she were simply the lady next door.  I<br/>
certainly am not basing my decisions about who to vote for and what to<br/>
believe on what these people have to say....it&#39;s just interesting to<br/>
talk about them, esp when they make their politics and beliefs so well<br/>
known.<br/>
