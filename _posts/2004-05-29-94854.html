<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852554866">&quot;I finally end up begging or yelling or something else, but it doesn&#39;t start <br/>
that way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Reading through all the posts about losing it, and breathing (which I think is hugely helpful) I kept thinking about a book you folks might really enjoy. It&#39;s called &quot;Wherever you go, there you are&quot; by John Kabat-zin (also writes about natural learning). He gave me a bit of wisdom that has helped me more lately...he talks about seeing the world, the daily activities from the vantage point of death. What will be happening when you&#39;re gone? All this stuff continues, all the things that we get stressed about will be there, but WE won&#39;t have to worry about it. He applies that to distancing yourself from situations and events, becoming &quot;unattached&quot; (the buddhist way) and thereby seeing things MORE clearly and able to function better.<br/>
This daily &quot;dying&quot; helps you detach emotional responses and respond in a way that you really believe is helpful. It&#39;s all goes back to mindful living....I find the buddhist philosophies are the most helpful for actually GETTING there.<br/>
<br/>
I love Thich Nat Hahn&#39;s work too.  And I really enjoyed reading about your paradigm shift Jennifer. I think looking back and analyzing situations when your temper or anxiety kicked in, helps you react better the next time a similar situation arises.<br/>
<br/>
When I read Andrea&#39;s description of how she feels, I remember feeling just like that...still do sometimes. The difference now, is I quit trying to hold myself to some level of perfection or ideal. I quit saying &quot;I am going to be calm and gentle ALL DAY&quot; (or all week or forever). I let go of all that, and just started living in the MOMENT.<br/>
This moment, right now, is all we really have. If I can focus on how to make this moment the best it can be, this ONE interaction joyful, then I have discovered the simplicity of mindfulness. It&#39;s so simple, just as Jennifer said, but until one awakens to that simple way of mindful living, it will elude you.<br/>
I can&#39;t say I live mindfully all the time...I&#39;m no Zen teacher!:)<br/>
But studying and applying those principles have made me a much better mother and person.<br/>

 &quot;There is no way to <br/>
peace.  Peace is the way.&quot; <br/>

&lt;&lt;  The difference now, is I quit trying to hold myself to some level of <br/>
perfection or ideal. I quit saying &quot;I am going to be calm and gentle ALL DAY&quot; (or <br/>
all week or forever). I let go of all that, and just started living in the <br/>
MOMENT.<br/>
This moment, right now, is all we really have. If I can focus on how to make <br/>
this moment the best it can be, this ONE interaction joyful, then I have <br/>
discovered the simplicity of mindfulness. It&#39;s so simple, just as Jennifer said, <br/>
but until one awakens to that simple way of mindful living, it will elude you. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems so weird, in a culture where we&#39;re raised to plan for the future, <br/>
save money, get good grades when you&#39;re eight so you can go to law school, be a <br/>
good boy now so you can be president someday, to say to people:  &quot;STOP!  <br/>
Forget the future.  What are you doing right this second?  How are you sitting?  <br/>
How is your mood?  Are you neglecting a human at this second?  Can you get up <br/>
and go there and be soothing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a trick I&#39;ve used to make people feel better in the SCA (medieval <br/>
studies club).  Not a trick, a tool.  A way to think.  When someone is unhappy <br/>
because his stuff isn&#39;t perfect (garb, armor, camping gear) I&#39;ve said &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>
move from nothing to everything all of a sudden.&quot;   That seems obvious, but is <br/>
it?  People want to BE what they think, and often our thoughts are pretty <br/>
elaborate.   But we act in this moment.<br/>
<br/>
The first time this particular trick came to me, I was advising someone who <br/>
was being knighted in the morning, and was staying awake all night to take <br/>
counsel of those who outranked him.   I was in with him, and I could feel his <br/>
sorrow and concern about not having a perfectly &quot;period&quot; camp.  I said &quot;When you <br/>
buy a tent, and your choices are nylon and canvas, choose canvas.  If your <br/>
choices are orange or brown, choose orange.  Incrementally, your set of stuff will <br/>
get better.  When  you have a choice, make the more medieval choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And with parenting, once you have your goal in mind, live in the moment by <br/>
learning to see that you have choices, and then make the choice that is nearer <br/>
your goal.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to learn patience, make the more patient choice.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to move toward natural learning, make the input-rich choice.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to become more light-hearted, make the brighter, more sparkly <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
A trap and a bog-hole in personal growth is the idea people get sometimes <br/>
which is &quot;I had no choice.&quot;     If you feel you have no choice, you should look <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce has a great riff on this.  She says you don&#39;t HAVE to wash our dishes. <br/>
You could buy paper plates.   She has lots of good examples like that.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s sad and depressing when people feel trapped or helpless.   So learn <br/>
not to.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe and look.  Do I HAVE to take care of my kids?  No, I choose to.  <br/>
They&#39;re all gone right now, and I have a van, a charge card, and a passport.  I <br/>
could be ten thousand miles away by Monday, having plastic surgery in some <br/>
clinic where the pre-med students ended up. &lt;g&gt;  I will probably choose NOT to do <br/>
that.  But having envisioned it, I know more clearly that I will be here Monday <br/>
when my family returns because I CHOOSE to be.<br/>
<br/>
(And if you&#39;re thinking, &quot;Well I don&#39;t have a van and a charge card and a <br/>
passport,&quot; don&#39;t whine about your lack of choices.  My friend Stan took himself <br/>
and his gun out to the storage shed in his yard and didn&#39;t come back out.  <br/>
Bummer for his kids.  There ARE choices, not all as merry as plastic surgery in <br/>
New Delhi.)<br/>
<br/>
So.  You have choices.  Make them as mindfully as you can, and if your goal <br/>
is to be more mindful, figure out two choices and make the more mindful one.  <br/>
Next time, your two choices might be two BETTER choices, and you make the more <br/>
mindful one.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the main point of a tape called Peaceful Parenting that&#39;s a <br/>
presentation I gave with Richard Prystowsky a couple of years ago.  It&#39;s available from <br/>
me when I go to conferences and from the HSC website.  I think there&#39;s a link <br/>
from SandraDodd/speaking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129885868">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; And with parenting, once you have your goal in mind, live in the moment<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; learning to see that you have choices, and then make the choice that is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nearer<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your goal.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do a little community newsletter about herbs, buying locally, living<br/>
simply, etc. and this just reminded me of an article I wrote for this month.<br/>
Basically, it was about how my parenting improved when I was able to keep my<br/>
goal firm but keep my plan fluid.<br/>
<br/>
I used to set a goal of say, a happy day with the kids, and make a general<br/>
plan in my head of how the day would go.  Inevitably, a glitch would show up<br/>
somewhere and I would try to force the world to reconfigure to my plan.<br/>
<br/>
I have finally learned to move into plan B. and to be ok if we end up<br/>
somewhere around plan Q.<br/>
<br/>
In my mind, I picture it as riding a wave.  Wierd.<br/>
