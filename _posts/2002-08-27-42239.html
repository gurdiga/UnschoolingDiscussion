&gt; enrolled in a public school or a private school that reports them truant.<br/>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t apply to homeschoolers. The fines used to be $100 per day of absence -<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s gone up or not.<br/>

&gt;&gt; yes, they are talking about introducing them here &gt;too.<br/>
&gt;&gt; ALso about taking possession of children who &gt;&quot;truant&quot;,<br/>
&gt;&gt; this is a problem here because in many states it is<br/>
&gt;&gt; hard to get permission to homeschool, therefore your<br/>
&gt;&gt; child can be deemed to be truanting.<br/>

In light of the recent complaints about being off topic, will you explain<br/>
your idea of how truancy fines are connected to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I believe there is an intimate connection, but we seem to need justification<br/>
for almost all posts nowadays. I&#39;d like to hear yours, and I honestly<br/>
believe it will interest almost everyone.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863127021">My email was merely an attempt to stave off rumors about truancy fines in New Jersey. (Yes, rumors are that quick to start.)<br/>
 <br/>
Your email to me (quoted below) appears to be an attempt to muddy the waters by conflating the occasional off-topic drifts on this list with your own crusade to turn this into your own personal political forum.<br/>
 <br/>
Does everyone here know how to activate your twit filters?<br/>
