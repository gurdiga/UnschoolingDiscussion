<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061204150">I think about Christina&#39;s posts that she just came here on a whim after<br/>
getting some vague information about unschooling.   I think she came<br/>
hoping to display her wonderful parenting skills and style to a group she<br/>
figured wouldn&#39;t just be fundamentalist Christians.   She wanted everyone<br/>
to know she was an open minded vegetarian atheist, but she didn&#39;t want to<br/>
be any more open minded than her personal comfort level.<br/>
<br/>
There were some very telling things in her posts.   They told of a person<br/>
who hadn&#39;t really thought about parenting beyond what we all hear on the<br/>
TV commercials.   They told of someone who never even thought about<br/>
respecting kids. <br/>
<br/>
She wrote about a fear of unschooling automatons, but it seems clear she<br/>
already thinks of children that way or she would have given more thought<br/>
to her comments about her own kid never eating anything but sweets if she<br/>
didn&#39;t intervene.   And later comments about her kids never finding their<br/>
own interests if she didn&#39;t force them into certain activities.<br/>
<br/>
She clearly equated unschooling with neglect, which happens all the time,<br/>
but she didn&#39;t stick around long enough to find out she was wrong.  <br/>
That&#39;s why she left, too.  She was afraid of finding out she might be<br/>
wrong, and wrong about more than unschooling being neglect. <br/>
<br/>
BUT... she was also miffed.   And while she twists these things around in<br/>
her mind maybe there&#39;ll be one little thing she heard here (from all the<br/>
good people who were dedicated enough to post)  that won&#39;t leave her<br/>
alone.  <br/>
<br/>
I find it fascinating that it&#39;s often the people who take pride in being<br/>
open minded and different who have such a hard time letting go of the<br/>
traditional teachy-schooly-discipline parenting thing. <br/>
<br/>
***And I get disappointed <br/>
when someone says they were going to answer a person and they say <br/>
nevermind because the person unsubbed. ***<br/>
<br/>
HEY!  I did that!  It was mostly my pathetic attempt at humor which I can<br/>
see failed, miserably.  Again.<br/>
<br/>
But I will say this about her ideas regarding protecting kids from<br/>
hardship and frustration.  They&#39;re silly. <br/>
<br/>
A person can&#39;t live one year without dealing with hardship and<br/>
frustration, so how she got to adulthood believing we somehow need to<br/>
make sure our kids experience it, I can&#39;t understand.   In spite of my<br/>
best efforts my son has had to face hardships and frustrations.  <br/>
Christina wrote &quot;How is a child to learn to tolerate frustration if mommy<br/>
and daddy never allow frustration in his/her life?&quot; <br/>
Can we disallow frustration? &lt;g&gt;  That would be great!<br/>
People will get plenty.   And in spite of what many believe it isn&#39;t the<br/>
hardship or frustration that we learn so much from, it&#39;s the recovery<br/>
from those things.  We can give our kids safe shelter, time to recover<br/>
and heal and grow stronger.  The world is full of criminal and tragic<br/>
examples of people who&#39;ve endured hardships and could never recover, who<br/>
had no safe shelter, no way to heal.<br/>
<br/>
I hope lurking wannabe unschoolers here are smarter than to worry about<br/>
Christina&#39;s thoughtless remarks.<br/>
