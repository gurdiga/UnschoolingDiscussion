<div id="ygrps-yiv-173287123">I am so relieved. My house is upside down from getting our portfolio together <br/>
for review, and from canning tomato sauce for the first time, but WHO CARES! <br/>
I spent the morning outside in the cool breeze sitting with my girl <br/>
discussing plans for the year. She still wants to go to fifth grade, but next <br/>
year, as an 11yo(she started K after just turning 5, was the youngest in her <br/>
class and has always been behind in emotional maturity). I saw this on a <br/>
message board, and wanted to share it. I am so thankful and happy I do not <br/>
represent the parent in this narrative, although that is how my precious dd <br/>
got her start in her education:<br/>
<br/>
Dear World:<br/>
<br/>
I bequeath to you today one little girl...in a crispy dress..with two blue <br/>
eyes...and a happy laugh that ripples all day long..and a flash of light <br/>
blonde hair that bounces in the sunlight when she runs. I trust you&#39;ll treat <br/>
her well.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s slipping out of the backyard of my heart this morning...and skipping <br/>
off down the street to her first day of school. And never again will she be <br/>
completely mine. Prim and proud she&#39;ll wave her young and independent hand <br/>
this morning and say &quot;Good Bye&quot;...and walk with little lady steps to the <br/>
schoolhouse.<br/>
<br/>
Now she&#39;ll learn to stand in line...and wait by the alphabet for her name to <br/>
be called. She&#39;ll learn to tune her ears to the sounds of school-bells...and <br/>
deadlines...and she&#39;ll learn to giggle...and gossip...and look at the ceiling <br/>
in a disinterested way when the little boy across the aisle sticks out his <br/>
tongue at her. And now she&#39;ll learn to be jealous. And now she&#39;ll learn how <br/>
it is to feel hurt inside. And now she&#39;ll learn how not to cry.<br/>
<br/>
No longer will she have time to sit on the front porch steps on a summer day <br/>
and watch an ant scurry across the crack in a sidewalk. Nor will she have <br/>
time to pop out of bed with the dawn to kiss lilac blossoms in the morning <br/>
dew. No, now she&#39;ll worry about important things. Like grades...and which <br/>
dress to wear...and who&#39;s best friend is whose. And the magic of books and <br/>
learning will replace the magic of her blocks and dolls. And now she&#39;ll find<br/>
new heroes.<br/>
<br/>
For five full years now I&#39;ve been her sage and Santa Claus and pal and <br/>
playmate and father and friend. Now she&#39;ll learn to share her worship with <br/>
her teachers...which is only right. But, no longer will I be the smartest man <br/>
in the whole world. Today when that school bell rings for the first <br/>
time...she&#39;ll learn what it means to be a member of a group. With all it&#39;s <br/>
privileges. And it&#39;s disadvantages too.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll learn in time that proper young ladies do not laugh out loud. Or kiss <br/>
dogs. Or keep frogs in pickle jars in bedrooms. Or even watch ants scurry <br/>
across cracks in the summer sidewalk.<br/>
<br/>
Today she&#39;ll learn for the first time that all who smile at her are not her <br/>
friends. And I&#39;ll stand on the front porch and watch her start out on the <br/>
long, lonely journey to become a woman.<br/>
<br/>
So, World. I bequeath to you today one little girl...in a crispy dress...with <br/>
two blue eyes and a happy laugh that ripples all day long...and a flash of <br/>
light blonde hair that bounces in the sunlight when she runs. I trust you&#39;ll <br/>
treat her well.<br/>
