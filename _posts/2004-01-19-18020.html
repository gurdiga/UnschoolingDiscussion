For book suggestions I really like Jim Trelease&#39;s The Read Aloud<br/>
Handbook...great info on reading to kids etc and a wonderful collection<br/>
of titles and little bits of info on bunches of books for all ages.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I was introduced to Jim Trelease&#39;s books by my librarian.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, was I bummed!<br/>
<br/>
He has WONDERFUL ideas about reading and NOT reading until ready and not <br/>
forcing reading. But he seems vehemently opposed to tv, video games, and <br/>
*anything* NOT-written!<br/>
<br/>
Really disappointing!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oops! Good point! I read his books when the boys were younger and I was<br/>
anti-tv...now I just use it to get ideas of good books to read (found<br/>
the My Father&#39;s Dragon series in there). Some of the books he has in his<br/>
anthology (is that the right word?) are good, some I didn&#39;t care for ,<br/>
but it gives me a general place to start.<br/>
<br/>
I also have read that he favors the reward/incentive school programs<br/>
(like getting pizza for reading books etc) too. Ick. I think that his<br/>
idea is if it gets them reading then great...but he completely misses<br/>
the point that reading should be its own reward. And if it is not, then<br/>
there are plenty other ways kids can get their info and enjoyment! (I<br/>
have come a long way ROTFLMAO!)<br/>
