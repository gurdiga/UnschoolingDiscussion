&lt;&lt; My parents were Ward and June Cleaver.. perfect authoritarians.. I <br/>
 was the most rebellious kid. &gt;&gt;<br/>

     I think that is the healthiest response to an authoritarian upbringing.  <br/>
Unfortunately, some people are deeply affected by that kind of an upbringing <br/>
for their whole lives...My husband&#39;s parents were the way you describe yours. <br/>
 He also went to an authoritarian private school and then joined the military <br/>
at 18.  He has had a very hard time questioning things.  He remembers little <br/>
of his childhood.  He has a hard time thinking of ANY dreams he has for his <br/>
life.  I think he himself needs a few years or more of complete unschooling <br/>
to get over all of that and begin to know his own heart and interests.  That <br/>
is one reason, among many, that I&#39;m always trying to figure out ways to live <br/>
more simply so that we could make it with him working a very reduced <br/>
schedule.  <br/>
