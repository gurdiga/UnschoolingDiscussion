<div id="ygrps-yiv-139487654">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
By popular request, I am sharing with you the following (rather positive) <br/>
story about homelearning in Thailand.<br/>
<br/>
The story originally appeared in a Japanese newspaper recently, and was <br/>
featured in our Japan news digest for last week. The Japanese press as of <br/>
late has been generally receptive to, and respectful of, the practice of <br/>
homelearning -- both in and out of Japan. This story is further evidence <br/>
of that.<br/>
<br/>
The Daily Yomiuri newspaper typically does not maintain its website links <br/>
for very long, and since some people have been asking to see the story in <br/>
its entirety, I repost it here strictly for informational purposes.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy it,<br/>
<br/>

PARENTS IN THAILAND EXPERIMENT WITH DO-IT-YOURSELF EDUCATION<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Yomiuri Shimbun Correspondent<br/>
<br/>
BANGKOK -- Last November, the Thai government introduced a home school <br/>
system that allows parents to educate their children at home. Since then, <br/>
a total of 50 families, either dissatisfied with the cramming style of <br/>
school education, fearing the spread of drugs among students or trying to <br/>
keep closer contact between family members, have started teaching their <br/>
children at home.<br/>
<br/>
Yutthachai Chalermchai, a 45-year-old magazine editor who works from his <br/>
home in Bangkunon, 20 kilometers south of Bangkok, is one of the <br/>
pioneering parents. His two sons, 14-year-old Saipan and 12-year-old <br/>
Sarntor, decided in May to study at home instead of going to school.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was disappointed in the schools, which put too much emphasis on <br/>
cramming knowledge. They don&#39;t respect children&#39;s opinions, so it is <br/>
impossible for children to learn at school how to think or live on their <br/>
own,&quot; Yutthachai explained. He cut his work hours in order to make more <br/>
time for his sons.<br/>
<br/>
Now their typical day starts early in the morning with walking and <br/>
swimming for exercise. Later, they visit a science museum and participate <br/>
in various volunteer activities to learn about politics, economics and <br/>
social studies in a direct way. Yutthachai takes charge of his sons in <br/>
all these activities.<br/>
<br/>
His wife is responsible for teaching them English, and the boys learn <br/>
mathematics from Yutthachai&#39;s dentist friend and Buddhism and traditional <br/>
Thai music from their grandfather.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We have come closer to each other and have more conversation than <br/>
before. I also noticed my sons have developed a stronger sense of <br/>
responsibility through participating in volunteer activities. They have <br/>
enough academic skills, too,&quot; Yutthachai explained.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I used to do only what the teachers told me to do when I was at school. <br/>
Now I can try my hand at all sorts of things. I can make friends with <br/>
people of different ages through the volunteer activities,&quot; Sarntor said.<br/>
<br/>
Thailand revised its education law last November and granted equal status <br/>
for home schools and ordinary schools. If parents apply to the Education <br/>
Ministry, the ministry decides whether the applicants are capable of <br/>
providing education at home. This depends on what ideas and environment <br/>
the parents can provide for the children, not on the parents&#39; academic <br/>
backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
The home school curriculum is left up to the parents. If they provide the <br/>
children with six years of primary school education, three years of <br/>
middle school and three years of high school, as in ordinary government <br/>
education, then the children are regarded as having completed ordinary <br/>
schooling and are allowed to take entrance examinations for universities.<br/>
<br/>
However, it is difficult to ensure that children educated at home reach <br/>
an adequate academic standard. The ministry is discussing detailed <br/>
regulations such as obliging the parents to submit to regular inspections <br/>
by ministry officials.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parents have the right to educate their own children. We would like to <br/>
keep an eye on the home school system as an experiment for education <br/>
reform,&quot; a ministry official in charge of the project said.<br/>
<br/>
Chotchoeng Chutinthorn, a 55-year-old medical doctor living in Bangkok, <br/>
is credited with starting the first home school in the nation. He <br/>
educated all three of his children at home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I started, it was completely illegal. But I don&#39;t regret what I <br/>
have done. Some people say children who have not experienced group <br/>
behavior cannot adapt to society, but my children have grown up without <br/>
any mental, physical or moral problems,&quot; Chotchoeng said, emphasizing his <br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
He now travels the country to give talks about his experiences.<br/>
<br/>
However, the home school system may be something to which only the rich <br/>
can aspire. &quot;The idea of home-schooling is wonderful in the sense that it <br/>
enables parents to provide their children with the best educational <br/>
opportunities,&quot; said an official of the education policy research <br/>
institute at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. &quot;But I am not sure if <br/>
the system is suitable in this society, in which it is common for both <br/>
members of a couple to work outside the home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The nation&#39;s experiment in educational reform has just started out, and <br/>
it will be several years before anyone can judge whether it has been <br/>
effective.<br/>
