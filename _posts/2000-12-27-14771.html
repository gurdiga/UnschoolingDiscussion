<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526499968">Okay am posting this an hope I am not double posting<br/>
because I some how lost my original message.<br/>
<br/>
WHY do you need to kill the slugs? <br/>
<br/>
In California and Washinton too I think (I haven&#39;t had<br/>
a chance to garden here yet), snails in particular can<br/>
be a menace to a young garden. They can devoure over<br/>
night young plants. I grew up in Kansas and I never<br/>
noticed slugs (never remember seeing any snails)<br/>
having any major damage to plants. It could have<br/>
something to do with they just don&#39;t multiply like<br/>
they can here in rain land. <br/>
<br/>
So if I want to garden to have food for my family or<br/>
just a little beauty I would rather kill a few snails<br/>
then poison the snails and hence the earth and my<br/>
garden.<br/>
<br/>
I would also argue that it impossible never to kill<br/>
even if someone is a vegetarian/vegan. If you plant a<br/>
garden you are removing something that lived there<br/>
before maybe it was &quot;just&quot; grass but maybe it was some<br/>
native plants too. Maybe some insects live there maybe<br/>
some slugs. Death is a part of life.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping that in mind I do not practice all out animal<br/>
genocide when attempting to garden. I kept the snail<br/>
population in check. I am thankful and mindful when I<br/>
am in my snail removal as well as when I garden. I<br/>
feel just as thankful for the food aninimal and<br/>
vegetable that offers its life so I may live.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Samantha<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207681238">We found a powder which dries out the slugs and snails so yes they die, but<br/>
it is not poisonous for other wildlife.  We don&#39;t use it on the whole garden<br/>
, just where we don&#39;t want the snails, for any food, or things the kids have<br/>
grown , or things we are growing from seed, until they get big enough to<br/>
survive mising a few leaves, and on my lovely new hosta :-) Other snails get<br/>
marked with nail varnish and are tracked.  Our garden is not that big, being<br/>
an English terraced garden, but it is packed ful of plants. And soon we will<br/>
be trying to find more space (we have started on containers)  for whatever<br/>
we want to try out in the spring.  Can&#39;t wait!<br/>
Peace<br/>
