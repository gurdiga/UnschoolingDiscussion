Yes, to the greatest extent possible we use organic foods.  It makes a big difference, and I now prefer it, tastewise.  I am not sorry for our health struggles, as it led us to the unschooling path!<br/>

  &gt;   &gt; Hi Annete,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; We also take a handful of multiple vitamins every night.  I don&#39;t<br/>
  think we could get enough of the vitamins in the foods we eat otherwise.  We<br/>
  are also overweight, so we can&#39;t eat too much, at least enough to get all<br/>
  the vitamins we need.  We have looked into the raw-foods thing as well, but<br/>
  we don&#39;t have the discipline to eat just raw foods!  I guess that&#39;s why<br/>
  we&#39;re overweight!     My DH&#39;s psychiatric MD (the one that prescribes<br/>
  medicine) was also into alternative medicines as well as the traditional<br/>
  meds like Prozac.  He wanted him to take a regimen of carbohydrate pills<br/>
  that was formulated to be broken down slowly and keep the level of<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; seratonin  up.  The idea was that certain carbohydrates make seratonin<br/>
  and if you kept the levels up, the patient would not get depressed.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;<br/>
