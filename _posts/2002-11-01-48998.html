<div id="ygrps-yiv-255176062">Hi Amie,<br/>
<br/>
What we do here is really, really pay attention to and support and applaud<br/>
what they are enjoying. In our spare time from that &lt;g&gt; we (my husband and<br/>
I) do talk to each other and to our daughters about things they might enjoy<br/>
-- some of those things work out, some don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
For example, we were very enthused about them joining 4H this fall because<br/>
all of our friends had told us how marvelous it was with all the variety of<br/>
activities available (these are friends who have kids the same ages as<br/>
ours). Turns out, that&#39;s the case in THEIR county, but not in ours! Here,<br/>
there&#39;s almost nothing for the under-9/10 crowd. So it was a bummer, but we<br/>
got over it. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Our girls try lots of different things and have lots of different hobbies.<br/>
Some get dropped quickly or after a time or temporarily and then picked up<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s so much potentially interesting and potentially fun stuff &quot;out<br/>
there&quot; that I think it would be hard to run out of ideas for them, and ours<br/>
show no real signs of running out of ideas for themselves!<br/>
<br/>
A hard thing for some parents is to really and honestly APPRECIATE what<br/>
their little and big unschoolers are doing. They want to see &quot;academic&quot;<br/>
looking stuff. If I were waiting around on that, I&#39;d be one sad unschooling<br/>
parent. ;) Occasionally my daughters do something noticeably &quot;academic&quot;.<br/>
It&#39;s not any more celebrated than a cartwheel would be.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2593<br/>
&gt;Date: Thu, Oct 31, 2002, 10:36 PM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I really thought that I had a handle on what unschooling is. The<br/>
&gt; definitions I see here totally resonate with me. And everything I have<br/>
&gt; read, I feel comfortable with. However, I am struggling on what it &quot;looks&quot;<br/>
&gt; like IRL, if that makes any sense. Do you &quot;plan&quot; any learning? I believe<br/>
&gt; whole heartedly that my boys(age 5 yrs) can and will learn without having<br/>
&gt; curriculums to follow, and without me formally teaching them everything.<br/>
&gt; But, I don&#39;t really get how the whole picture goes together. Do you set up<br/>
&gt; or &quot;stage&quot; things, then see if they get interested in something, and then<br/>
&gt; find more info and/or activities to relate to that subject? Or, do you just<br/>
&gt; kind of go about your day with your interests and let them discover things<br/>
&gt; on their own and ask you questions? I don&#39;t mean that I would just sit<br/>
&gt; around eating bon-bons and not have to be present , but I guess it just<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem like we have enough excitement around here. I am worried that<br/>
&gt; I somehow need more to spur their curiosity? They really seem bored at<br/>
&gt; times. I keep thinking, how can they be bored already, they are only 5! I<br/>
&gt; hope this question is clear.<br/>
&gt; Can anyone help me understand? </span></blockquote></div>
