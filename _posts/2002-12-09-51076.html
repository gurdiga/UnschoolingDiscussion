On holidays or when he has stayed at relatives house&#39;s this happens.  He becomes like a zoombie and obsessed.  He played for 4 days this holiday, the only time he stopped was to eat, sleep and pee.   For 3 days all he would talk about it the game. The other thing is that Gus wants to learn other things and do other stuff.  He gets so consumed with the game we don&#39;t get to do the other things he wants.  I also believe the importance of balance.  This is what we are trying to create. <br/>
The positive is that he has not wanted to play.<br/>
