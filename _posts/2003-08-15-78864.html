&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-Discussion] Digest Number 3923<br/>
&gt;Date: Fri, Aug 15, 2003, 1:31 PM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Children&#39;s bodies are known to be more resilient than adult ones--<br/>
&gt; this is why infant conjoined twins are so much easier to separate<br/>
&gt; than adult ones, for instance. Similarly, children&#39;s minds are<br/>
&gt; more &quot;pliable&quot; than adult ones so to speak--more receptive and<br/>
&gt; adaptable to new mental challenges. It&#39;s no secret that the greatest<br/>
&gt; amount of neural connection growth occurs in childhood. We continue<br/>
&gt; to make new neural connections throughout our lives, but it is during<br/>
&gt; the early years that the brain is most active in this respect.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not a big one for &quot;studies&quot; but I seem to recall that most of the neural<br/>
connections we&#39;ll ever make are by the age of 5. Well before &quot;curriculum&quot;<br/>
enters most children&#39;s lives (though not all, sadly).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396917900">Have any of you ever read a book called The Myth of the First Three<br/>
Years?  (I think that&#39;s the name ,  I&#39;ll try to find it.  Several years<br/>
ago,  I attended a seminar about brain research and early brain<br/>
development.<br/>
<br/>
A few years later,  I noticed the book and read it.  Turns out that<br/>
there is much lying with research and much false assumption in that<br/>
area.  The book describes some of the specific studies and results,  and<br/>
the unfortunate extrapolations made about learning based on these<br/>
results.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not denying brain growth and development.....but the knowledge of<br/>
the brain is still barely a scratch of the surface....like studying the<br/>
ocean or space....much more is unknown than known.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s interesting, about sounding native. Immersion in the household, one <br/>
person speaking spanish and one speaking english, or both speaking both, is, of <br/>
course, much better for the kids than school lanquage classes anyway ;-) <br/>
<br/>
My husband grew up in a bilingual household, but doesn&#39;t like to speak <br/>
Spanish, he thinks he sounds &quot;too white&quot;.  He always listened to his Mom speak <br/>
Spanish and then answered in English.  I think this is common.  Because he spoke <br/>
only English in school.  <br/>
<br/>
I live in a mostly hispanic neighborhood, and it&#39;s funny how the second <br/>
gener&#39;s sound *so different* speaking Spanish than their parents, even tho, for the <br/>
first 4 or 5 years of their life, they only spoke Spanish!  I think its the <br/>
school system that forces English on them as early as they can get at them.  <br/>
That&#39;s also why our school system is worse than others, here in town.  It&#39;s <br/>
demented, what they do to those kids.  They make these kids uncomfortable with <br/>
their native language!!  <br/>
<br/>
I think the accent thing I&#39;ve noticed is a type of cultural detachment, they <br/>
don&#39;t want to sound like immigrants, so they sound &quot;American&quot; instead, and <br/>
then they don&#39;t seem to like that very much either!  It is kind of horrible to <br/>
hear them speak Spanish, it&#39;s very hesitant and mumbly and they often have a <br/>
strange look on their face. Kinda like when I try to speak Spanish, lol.   But <br/>
with them, you can tell they&#39;re fluent, tho.  It&#39;s very strange.  I am often <br/>
spoken to in Spanish and answer in English, and no one is ever surprised, or if I <br/>
answer in spanish, that my accent is so bad, :-) because it&#39;s common here, <br/>
for someone my age, to answer that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, went off on a tangent, but it&#39;s just so darn interesting!  Another <br/>
example of the evil school system, and how they screw with natural learning.  <br/>

have more &quot;Texas accent&quot; (or vocabulary, inflection, slang) than kids do.  It&#39;s <br/>
not an evil turning away from one&#39;s roots, it&#39;s the natural progress of any <br/>
living language.<br/>

Some of both, but not just schools.<br/>
ANY child in 1900 was likely to meet just people from his own part of the <br/>
world.<br/>
ANY child in 2000 was likely to meet people from all over the world.  All the <br/>
wars of the 20th century have served to mix people around internally and <br/>
internationally, there are freeways, cars, airplanes you don&#39;t have to be a <br/>
millionaire to travel on, and there&#39;s radio, TV sound recordings.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take school.<br/>
<br/>
But languages have changed gradually ALWAYS, and within lifetimes.  I doubt <br/>
there&#39;s ever been a time when kids didn&#39;t have new and different terms and <br/>
phrases from their grandparents, back to cavemen.<br/>

You can see this in period movies.  Recently we watched Amistad and Pirates<br/>
of the Carribean which are both from the same time period.  We also watched<br/>
Gods and Generals (this one bored the kids to death.  We didn&#39;t even finish<br/>
it) but it was from a different time period.  We noticed how people talked<br/>
English so differently in the different time periods.<br/>

indoctrinate (LOL, that word again) students in one &quot;official&quot; <br/>
language, and one &quot;standard&quot; dialect, and this definitely has lead to <br/>
many dialects and indeed entire languages becoming endangered or even <br/>
extinct. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, There is an excellent and exremely comprehensive online language <br/>
database called Ethnologue that you can browse or search through if <br/>
you want to learn more about the langugages of the world:<br/>

because of government assimilation and/or supression of minority <br/>
indigenous tongues...<br/>
