<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639523578">Some of us would camp every<br/>
other week with our unschooling friends, given the chance!!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a couple days old, but I had to pipe up on the HSC campouts. My<br/>
first intro to HSC was through the Refugio (beach north of Santa Barbara)<br/>
campout and it was love at first sight!  After the campout we went to the<br/>
conference that summer and my family had a blast.  I know some folks have<br/>
said the conference is not unschooly enough, but gosh I don&#39;t know what a<br/>
more structured person would find to do with their time at an HSC conference<br/>
because its all we talk about (unschooling-respectful parenting etc.).<br/>
Maybe its just the folks the other poster was hanging out with, but there is<br/>
just this large group of unschoolers at this conference meeting up as often<br/>
as we can.   We spend less time going to sessions and more just hanging out<br/>
at the pool or walking around checking on our kids (that would be me &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
What I first noticed about the HSC campers and the same folks that attend<br/>
the conferences regularly was the respectful interactions with their<br/>
children and that is what keeps me coming back.  I have to quote a friend of<br/>
mine, mom to four grown and almost grown unschoolers (first wasn&#39;t) when she<br/>
attended her first campout she said &quot;I have found my people&quot; : ) !<br/>

South Carolina last summer when she leaned over to me while listening to <br/>
Sandra speak and said, &quot;These are my kind of people.  I feel like I belong here&quot;  <br/>
And so did I.<br/>
