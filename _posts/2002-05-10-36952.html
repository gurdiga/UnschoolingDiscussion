<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831849076">Ok, I know this topic is really old (I am WAY behind on e-mail), but I know this one :-)<br/>
<br/>
On NOGGIN, they play all of the old Sesame Street, 321 Contact, Electric company, etc, shows I grew up on. It is in the middle of the night though (I have an autistic child which has involved a lot of staying up all night in the past - so we saw a lot of these in recent years). My 7 yr old is an excellent reader, reading things that most of her public schooled peers won&#39;t be reading for MANY years to come, and I really believe that a lot of it is due to her fascination with watching the Electric Company. I really get a kick out of how &#39;politically incorrect&#39; some of these older shows are - it really sticks out when seeing them in the same day as the newer shows.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in case anyone is interested, you could always set the VCR to record these middle of the night oldies on NOGGIN if you are a &#39;normal&#39; family and not up in the middle of the night like us.<br/>

the little heads with my expertise, and began to explore how I could <br/>
remove those obstacles that prevented the inherent genius of children <br/>
from gathering itself.&quot;<br/>
