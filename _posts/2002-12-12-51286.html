<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655093375">When my last baby was born, I was really looking forward to getting a sling. <br/>
I actually already had one ready and waiting for her. The only thing I had <br/>
available to me for the other 3 children was those back pack type things and <br/>
me and all 3 kids hated them.<br/>
<br/>
So Alyssa was born and we started working on the sling and she never ever <br/>
liked it for more than 10 minutes. I was so disappointed and tried so many <br/>
times but she hated it. I was so looking forward to that thing and <br/>
unfortunately she wasn&#39;t!!<br/>
