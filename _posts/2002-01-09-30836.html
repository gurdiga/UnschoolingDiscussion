<div id="ygrps-yiv-593957264">A friend whose husband left her recently phoned me asking for help <br/>
continuing to homeschool her sons.  Her husband had always supported <br/>
homeschooling until she walked into mediation recently, when he <br/>
shocked  her by saying he wants joint custody and by the way, &quot;Isn&#39;t it <br/>
time the boys were in school?&quot;  She was asking me for some short, like one <br/>
or two sentences or so, arguments in favour of homeschooling that might <br/>
sway an ex-husband.  I thought since I&#39;ve heard of a number of cases like <br/>
this in the last year or so, that maybe we could generate a list of &quot;pithy <br/>
sayings&quot; about homeschooling that might help these mothers.  Maybe we could <br/>
put them up on a web page for others to use.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that these guys *really* rot my socks.  It&#39;s one thing if the <br/>
husband had been even slightly negative about homeschooling before the <br/>
breakup, but in all the cases I&#39;ve heard about, they&#39;ve been totally <br/>
supportive until they left and realized that they could pay less support if <br/>
the wife went back to work, which wouldn&#39;t be possible if she continued to <br/>
homeschool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631087843">This is my short sweet answer to people when they start questioning why I choose to home school. Of course there are many more reasons than just this one, but it is a good start. It can be said either of these ways.<br/>
<br/>
-When in your adult life do you interact and function with people ONLY your age? <br/>
<br/>
or for adults that went through public school themselves ~<br/>
<br/>
-When in your life (aside from public school) were you divided into, and interacted with people ONLY your age?<br/>
<br/>
It usually at least gets them thinking in the right direction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070393770">Grrrr...... I truely believe you are right when you talk about husbands being<br/>
totally supportive re: homeschooling until its divorce time.<br/>
My answer to this is probably to say &quot;Of Course, they weren&#39;t the ones doing <br/>
it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think its a big joke to me that some hs moms make their husband the <br/>
principal, superintendent, master of all, when they haven&#39;t anything to do <br/>
with the teaching<br/>
process, now mind you there are some fathers that are right in their doing <br/>
their<br/>
part, and there are some fathers that have their noses stuck so high that <br/>
they<br/>
are in charge of everything. They dictate what goes and doesn&#39;t go. This type<br/>
doesn&#39;t appeal to me, as I would never give that much control away to anyone.<br/>
For instance, my hair, make-up clothes, etc. ... Are MY business. If I choose<br/>
to pile it on is my choice. l<br/>
Divorce changes things.</div>

<br/>
I guess I am naive but I wonder why homeschooling alone would cause a person<br/>
to lose custody of their children?  is h/s against the law where she lives?<br/>
Did they test the children and find that they were far behind the levels<br/>
they would supposedly be at in ps?  And how is it that the judge would not<br/>
look at the situation and say that the husband was obviously in support of<br/>
h/s until the separation...when I hear of cases like this I think there must<br/>
be more reasons why the judge would find in favour of the father - h/s seems<br/>
like a fairly lame reason to take someone&#39;s children away.  But that is just<br/>
my interpretation...I would never worry about losing my children over h/s as<br/>
both my ex and my dh agree that it is best for our children - but I suppose<br/>
you just never know how people will be.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if they are already divorced, or in a divorce or if custody <br/>
was already established BUT I&#39;d like to point out a case here recently.<br/>
<br/>
The mom was homeschooling her children. A divorce happened (he left her <br/>
for a woman he met on the internet) and later on he sued for custody.<br/>
<br/>
The judge granted him full custody because the EX used the homeschooling <br/>
hook to an old judge who sided with him.<br/>
<br/>
She was invovled in a school we are building, so I know her besides just <br/>
the news stories.<br/>
<br/>
Her answer on a NY homeschool list was &#39;In retrospect, I would of put my <br/>
kids in ps for the year until the custody battle was over.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Please keep this story in mind before trying to use comebacks.<br/>
<br/>
let us know how it goes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That would also describe lots of courts in the South, too. There are always<br/>
exceptions, of course, but basically these judges side with their buds they<br/>
see on the golf courses each Wednesday afternoon.<br/>
IMO the mom would need to have a very savvy lawyer willing to learn and<br/>
understand the unschoolers&#39; perspective in order to properly defend it. Most<br/>
lawyers aren&#39;t willing to go that far; they are used to pretty cut and dried<br/>
routines in divorce cases.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-287860267">That applies to all states.  There is a whole myth/stigma around<br/>
homeschooling that folks like H$LDA help to foster.  Courts think that the<br/>
&quot;socialization&quot; issue is real and that all folks that homeschool are second<br/>
cousins to cults.  Generally speaking judges are by far some of the worst of<br/>
the worst when it comes to being first appearances count judgemental.  And<br/>
that doesn&#39;t necessarily apply to the person they see in front of them.  If<br/>
they have ever seen an old commune living hippy that homeschooled, then all<br/>
homeschoolers are the same.  If they saw the folks at Waco or Jonestown,<br/>
then all homeschoolers are the same.<br/>
<br/>
This case is not unusual, unfortunately.  It happens continually! The whole<br/>
custody issue has nothing to do with homeschooling, that is a weapon of<br/>
choice.  It has nothing to do with the welfare of the kids, that part is all<br/>
about revenge and power!<br/>

those in ps.  We need to start publicizing that fact more clearly and <br/>
specifically IMHO.  First, we need to put the bug in their ears about <br/>
age segregation and reality.  Then we need to make sure we contrast <br/>
our children&#39;s behavior with the average ps childs in a positive <br/>
light.  For example, when TIME did it&#39;s cover story, the reporter <br/>
talked about a study that showed that our kids interacted more <br/>
maturely with others than did the ps kids.  The reporter turned that <br/>
around to say that our kids don&#39;t get to be kids.  I wrote a letter <br/>
explaining that the fact that my kids know how to interact with <br/>
others does npot mean they are not allowed to be kids, it just means <br/>
they know how to make friends. (It wasn&#39;t published.)<br/>
Anyway, I think we need to start a concerted letter writing campaign <br/>
to correct our image.  Sure, there are still some fundamentalist <br/>
Christian homeschoolers who do the school at home thing and keep <br/>
their kids away from the vast &#39;unwashed&#39; society, but they are no <br/>
longer the majority (if they ever were).  Today&#39;s homeschooler&#39;s are <br/>
so varied that they defy description but what can be said almost <br/>
uniformly is that they are happier and better adjusted than their ps <br/>
counterparts.  We need to start painting that picture graphically in <br/>
the press.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-102550359">I agree.  There was a really negative article in a magazine for teachers<br/>
(written by a college prez) and I zapped a letter off, sure as can be that<br/>
it would never get published and asking myself why I wasted my time and<br/>
wonder of wonders, they did publish it!<br/>

So, keep those letters going because if we change only one mind at a time,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-550307760">There is a good chance that I will be divorcing too<br/>
and I&#39;m wondering if there are lists of lawyers who do<br/>
support homeschooling in a divorce situation.  I live<br/>
in Washington state.  My parents, aware of the bad<br/>
situation in my home, live on the Olympic Peninsula<br/>
and they have told me that they will buy a house over<br/>
there as a rental and rent it to me for expenses only,<br/>
once I file for divorce, so I do know where I&#39;ll be<br/>
going and feel that my children will thrive over there<br/>
(we live in Seattle).  The kids are 12 and 8 and we&#39;ve<br/>
been unschooling for over a year but to anyone who<br/>
asks I tell them we&#39;re homeschooling since I&#39;m aware<br/>
of the opinions of people on the issue of unschooling.<br/>
 My husband went with me to the 2 day class last<br/>
spring to become certified to comply with the state<br/>
and he went willing and enjoyed the class.  He also<br/>
says to everyone how the kids have thrived with<br/>
homeschooling but he is the type to make me put them<br/>
in school in a heartbeat if it will help him pay less<br/>
support.  I&#39;ve told him that I would only have him pay<br/>
what he would if they were in school but he doesn&#39;t<br/>
feel that the courts would give him that choice.  I<br/>
absolutely do not want to put them in school until the<br/>
divorce is final.  This whole issue just scares me to<br/>
death.  The alternative is to stay in a very bad<br/>
marriage so that I can homeschool them????  Any suggestions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Cheryl, <br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear about the issues you face now.  I don&#39;t have much in <br/>
the way of lawyers. I only have advice based on what I&#39;ve seen so far in <br/>
courts regarding this.<br/>
<br/>
And I will stand on the only advice that I am aligned with. Take with it <br/>
what you want or leave it all. Someone else here will come up with their <br/>
opinion and you can hear them all out.<br/>
<br/>
It is in MY experience when dealing with legal issues, that you don&#39;t <br/>
&#39;rock the boat&#39; if your children are involved.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, sure, sure I&#39;ve been flamed before for not being more altruistic <br/>
and hopefull in going up against an unfair mindset... I don&#39;t adhere to <br/>
that train of thought.<br/>
<br/>
So, IF one were to think this sound advice, lets eplore the options.<br/>
<br/>
You can send them to ps, get paid less for the effort OR you can choose <br/>
private school. 6 months to a year of Waldorf or Sudbury isn&#39;t going to <br/>
hurt your child.<br/>
<br/>
If it comes down to a school that has a cirriculum, then just make sure <br/>
your kids know that their grades don&#39;t impress or unimpress you. So they <br/>
don&#39;t feel pressure to perform. Defend them and their position to all <br/>
their teachers and let them do what they want at home.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, an Ex _might_ choose homeschooling over the prices of Waldorf <br/>

<br/>
Sorry to hear about your marriage situation. It sounds really rough. The<br/>
only advice I an offer is regarding your living situation should you and<br/>
your husband split. A single mom I know homeschools her two kids and lives<br/>
w/another single homeschooling mom w/one kid. They share childcare,<br/>
expenses and they&#39;ve structured their schedules so that one of them is<br/>
always w/the kids while the other is working. It seems to work for<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Lynn<br/>

I like your thinking and appreciate the advice.  I<br/>
will definitely tuck the idea of giving him the option<br/>
of paying for private school or letting me homeschool<br/>
away for future reference.  Great idea!  He makes big<br/>
money working for Boeing but he is one of those people<br/>
who does not believe in paying child support.  He told<br/>
me 2 years ago that he wanted a divorce, he wanted me<br/>
to move out because he felt that I couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
taking care of the house (this from a guy that does<br/>
zilch around the house) and he wanted joint custody,<br/>
figuring that then he wouldn&#39;t have to pay at all.  I<br/>
almost laughed at him if it hadn&#39;t ticked me off so<br/>
much.  I told him something to the effect of &quot;over my<br/>
dead and cold body&quot;.  I tried for the last 2 years<br/>
though to work things out with everyone telling me<br/>
that one person cannot fix their marriage.....guess<br/>
they were right.  I see my kids growing up and it&#39;s<br/>
when I think about the memories they&#39;ll have of their<br/>
all-too-short childhood that I know I have to get them<br/>
out of here.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enough ramblings for one night.  Time to get<br/>
some dinner going for the boys.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would start now documenting these kinds of things.  I think an <br/>
intelligent judge (hope that&#39;s not an oxymoron) would be able to see that <br/>
the attitude change was *because* of the divorce rather than concern for <br/>
the kids.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A divorce doesn&#39;t need to go to a court battle.  If the couple have a <br/>
separation agreement, the judge will rarely interfere with that.  So you <br/>
really are better off to do some kind of mediation to get it all in order.<br/>

&gt;marriage so that I can homeschool them????  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because of my question on the Canadian homeschooling list (hs-ca) a single <br/>
mother has started a list for single parent homeschoolers.  Some will have <br/>
already been hs before the divorce like you, and some will already be <br/>
single parents wanting to hs.  It&#39;s just started, so there may not be very <br/>
many members yet, but you&#39;ll get the kind of support that us married types <br/>
can&#39;t really give you.<br/>

with being the only caregiver for their child (whether the other parent has<br/>
ever been involved or not) and how to deal with the stresses and share the<br/>
joys of doing so.<br/>

Waldorf school over an hour from here, nowhere near public transit.  That&#39;s <br/>
about it for the whole Victoria area.  I&#39;m guessing it won&#39;t be any better <br/>
on the Olympic Peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
I also have the experience of starting to homeschool after a divorce.  I <br/>
tried to talk with my ex about taking my older boy out.  He didn&#39;t even <br/>
want to discuss it.  I finally decided that Noah&#39;s sanity was the most <br/>
important thing and took him out.  The ex put up with it for a year and a <br/>
half and then announced that we were going to court if I didn&#39;t put him <br/>
back in school.  Being 8 months pregnant at the time, I didn&#39;t want a court <br/>
fight.  Neither did Noah, so he went to school.  Worst thing that ever <br/>
happened to him, and his father even agrees......now.  What I&#39;m trying to <br/>
say is that waiting until the divorce is final does not guarantee that he <br/>
won&#39;t fight homeschooling.  I&#39;m inclined to say that stability for the <br/>
children would be the thing to argue for.  They&#39;re going to be going <br/>
through a lot of changes because of the divorce.  Their education should <br/>
stay the same, at least for a year or two after.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564134427">I appreciated your comments on socialization, Bridget. Something that <br/>
I have been doing since starting with unschooling in November is to <br/>
log the number of hours that my kids socialize. Amazingly, I see the <br/>
time going up, compared to when they were in school.<br/>
<br/>
A parent of a ps student told me flat out that I was exaggerating <br/>
because &quot;all the time in school the kids are socializing&quot; I wonder if <br/>
this parent spends much time in the classroom and sees what happens <br/>
when children try to socialize in class ... they get ridiculed or <br/>
worse, put in the hallway. I will grant that they do get to freely <br/>
socialize on the playground for about 1 1/2 hour during the day.<br/>
<br/>
Because I feel less stressed with the kids being at home and because <br/>
they don&#39;t have homework at night, I allow their friends to come over <br/>
almost every night. They socialize between 3 and 5 hours a day during <br/>
the week and as many as 12 hours per day on the weekends, not <br/>
including the nights they have sleepovers. How much more social do <br/>
they need to be???<br/>
<br/>
I have also been fed the argument that my kids won&#39;t be able to <br/>
identify with their ps buddies as they won&#39;t have the same <br/>
experiences and won&#39;t have any reason to maintain their relationships <br/>
(eg. school dances, field trips etc.) To this I respond, that I have <br/>
kept in contact with a grand total of 1 (one) friend from my <br/>
junior/senior high school years out of the 600 people I graduated <br/>
with. The school environment did not help me foster life-long <br/>
friendships.<br/>
<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t play with kids from their ps school anyway. I sent <br/>
them to a school outside of our designated district, so for the most <br/>
part, their friends are our neighbours, not their classmates. <br/>
