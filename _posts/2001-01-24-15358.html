<div id="ygrps-yiv-124893491">I have some clarifications:<br/>
<br/>
-=-The <br/>
<br/>
original Hebrew tells us that Jesus is the son of God, not just a son of <br/>
<br/>
God. As for interpertation, I am a Babtist and I take the Bible literally. --<br/>
<br/>
The New Testament was never in Hebrew.  It was in Aramaic and Greek.<br/>
(And it&#39;s &quot;Baptist,&quot; as in &quot;baptize.&quot; ) <br/>
<br/>
-=-And it has been translated many many times.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Even a single translation is always problematical.  It&#39;s not many <br/>
translations from the original, as most translations are done with the <br/>
original language versions (Hebrew for the Old Testament and Greek for the <br/>
New) at hand, along with the Latin texts which have been used for many years <br/>
(as secondary, not the primary source).<br/>
<br/>
These things are worth knowing--not just for Christians to know, but for <br/>
anyone who lives in any English-speaking country to know, in which the King <br/>
James Bible is quoted (sometimes mistaken for Shakespeare, sometimes <br/>
vice-versa) ALL the time, and so much of the culture is related to the <br/>
hundreds of years of Christianity which pervade European history.   It&#39;s not <br/>
just religion, it&#39;s our children&#39;s heritage.<br/>
<br/>
It might be a waste of time to say &quot;Yes it is&quot; and &quot;No it&#39;s not&quot; about <br/>
literalism or Jesus/God/sin/Biblical-bases-for-corporal-punishment, but those <br/>
discussions WILL recur, because unschooling is criticized within the <br/>
Christian homeschooling community and even if non-Christian unschoolers can <br/>
avoid knowing that, Christian unschoolers cannot.  And if we&#39;re not honest <br/>
with ourselves about the difficulties unschoolers face when they&#39;re also <br/>
fundamentalist (or even middle-of-road) Protestants, we&#39;re ignoring the <br/>
plight of a large group of unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a new book out about Christian unschooling, and there are websites <br/>
and discussion groups.  At <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expage.com/unschoolingotherwise">http://expage.com/unschoolingotherwise</a> (which is <br/>
one of my pages) there are links.  If any of you here would like to send me <br/>
other links to include I&#39;d be glad to put them there too (Christian or pagan <br/>
or whatever related to unschooling).<br/>

As usual, you know your stuff.  Thank you.  I feel like a square peg in a <br/>
round hole caught between a rock and a hard place. (mixing of metaphors <br/>
intentional)  I catch it from both sides.  I&#39;m too liberal for my fellow <br/>
believers and too conservative for my liberal friends.  The hardest to take <br/>
is the suspicion from both sides, from Christians when they learn I&#39;m a <br/>
non-spanking, attachment parenting unschooler and from non-Christians when <br/>
they learn I&#39;m a Christian.<br/>
<br/>
I run an email list for Christian unschoolers because I think they find <br/>
themselves feeling alone out there.  I make it clear that it&#39;s open to anyone <br/>
interested in hearing what we have to talk about, any religion or lack <br/>
thereof, conservative or liberal but that the basic tenets of the Christian <br/>
faith be respected.  Considering the wide range of biblical interpretations <br/>
remarkably few squabbles erupt.  Many of the members really school at home <br/>
but I think they gain a lot from the unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
You did an excellent job of presenting the way I feel.  It was excellent to <br/>
see it expressed.<br/>

Thank you Sandra, I can&#39;t tell you how much that means to me. We often feel <br/>
that we get it from both sides:(<br/>

<br/>
I can relate to what you&#39;re saying here:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

non-Catholic) one, and I don&#39;t spank either.</div>

-because- I take that Bible literally, just that I am a Babtist -and- I take <br/>
the Bible literally.<br/>
