<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148883847">First of all...to Dawn: apology accepted. I&#39;m not trying to pick fights with<br/>
anyone or drag anyone down. As Melissa said, this is supposed to be<br/>
supportive to all unschoolers. We can disagree and live.<br/>
<br/>
This is my last remark on spanking (promise)(well, for now anyway)....All I<br/>
can figure is some people can&#39;t distinguish between a single swat on the<br/>
behind (that only stings for a second and doesn&#39;t leave a mark) and a<br/>
whipping, thrashing, or beating. I&#39;m sorry that people have been so abused<br/>
that any kind of spanking constitutes violence to them. I mean that....I&#39;m<br/>
very sad for their suffering. But that does not make the kind of spanking I<br/>
am talking about abusive. If it turns their stomach, by all means, they<br/>
shouldn&#39;t spank. The same doesn&#39;t hold true for me since we are different<br/>
people with different children.<br/>
<br/>
The logic of comparing an adult paddling another adult or &quot;would you want<br/>
your husband to do that to you?&quot; or &quot;if it isn&#39;t okay in public, why is it<br/>
okay in your home&quot; also doesn&#39;t work for me. The family unit is unique.<br/>
Children are not adults. I am not my husband&#39;s child to bring up. We treat<br/>
each other like a married couple.  It wouldn&#39;t be appropriate to do many<br/>
things in a grocery store....change a diaper for instance. Have an intimate<br/>
conversation. Make love. That doesn&#39;t make those things wrong...they just<br/>
need privacy. It also wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for another adult outside our<br/>
family to do many things that we do in our home. I wouldn&#39;t want someone<br/>
other than my husband to walk up and give me a passionate kiss (okay, unless<br/>
it was Sean Connery). I wouldn&#39;t anyone else to breastfeed my babies. And I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want anyone else to spank my children...and I don&#39;t spank others&#39;<br/>
kids either.<br/>
<br/>
I read a comment once that spanking a bare bottom was sexual abuse. I think<br/>
that is insulting to anyone who&#39;s really suffered sexual abuse. I wonder<br/>
what that person thinks of wiping a poopy bottom? It&#39;s certainly more<br/>
intimate. These things are just taken too far. Real abuse is criminal. It<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be muddled and trivialized by lumping ordinary spanking in with<br/>
it. I hope I am being more understandable this time.<br/>
