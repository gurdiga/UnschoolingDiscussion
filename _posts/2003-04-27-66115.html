&gt; &gt;There was a small unschooling conference last year in Watertown, MA. (I <br/>
&gt; &gt;went, and also live in MA.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just posted a question to that list....hopefully will be hearing soon.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like I&#39;ve volunteered to coordinate this....my partner is actually <br/>
enthusiastic and has a bunch of ideas too.<br/>
<br/>
Way cool!<br/>
