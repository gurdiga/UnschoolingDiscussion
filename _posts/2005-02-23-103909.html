<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082950140">Hey all. <br/>
<br/>
As of now we have my 3 in-laws that live with us and they seem really <br/>
behind. They&#39;ve moved from Missouri and just because of what has been <br/>
going on (or lack thereof) in the past 2 weeks of Pinellas County <br/>
schools (you have to ask for books in some cases), we&#39;re considering <br/>
homeschooling them in the fall, too. <br/>
<br/>
Can someone suggest a curriculum that we can buy for a 7th grader? <br/>
11th? and 12th? I want to do it this way because I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
gadge them in their learning. I know how to do this for my own <br/>
daughter because I had her and we&#39;re close. She&#39;ll definitely be <br/>
homeschooled started this summer! YAy -because she&#39;s been asking for <br/>
it continuously.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any other suggestions for the 3 boys, let me know.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-516359390">Latoya, you&#39;re asking in the wrong place - this is an *un*schooling <br/>
place. Curriculum materials are way down on the bottom as far as <br/>
learning goes here - perhaps if a child chooses to use a math book <br/>
to master a concept or something like that but in general life is <br/>
learning and we don&#39;t &quot;gauge&quot; them in their learning - there&#39;s <br/>
nothing to measure against, they are who they are doing what they&#39;re <br/>
doing as they choose to do it, whether it&#39;s mastering Age of Empires <br/>
or some other video/computer game or telling time with an analog <br/>
clock or learning about dinosaurs or dog breeds.</div>

Are they just with you temporarily?<br/>
 <br/>
If you want to do a more unschooling thing with them, maybe consider  <br/>
Conlara.  I don&#39;t think they let 12th graders graduate unless they&#39;ve been  with the <br/>
school longer; don&#39;t know about the junior.<br/>
 <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clonlara.org/_">http://clonlara.org/_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clonlara.org/)">http://clonlara.org/)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s my recommendation if you&#39;re only temporary guardians and they&#39;ll be  <br/>
back in home or at school.   If they&#39;re with you longterm, you could  do <br/>
Clonlara more loosely, or maby forego it.<br/>
 <br/>
If I had to, for some legal reason, sign my kids up with some program, I&#39;d  <br/>
use Clonlara.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you might treat your in-law&#39;s kids and your own daughter as separate<br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling because the available schools are scary is a different goal<br/>
than homeschooling because someone wants to. And the solutions that feel<br/>
right will be different.<br/>
<br/>
As Sandra suggested Clonlara is good. They&#39;ll help you as little or as much<br/>
as you want in designing a personalized program.<br/>
<br/>
Community college could be an option too. (Depends on the laws in your<br/>
state.) The older ones could take just courses that truly interest them.<br/>
They might even take the GED and then not have to both with the rest of high<br/>
school. (There are courses and books and software to help prepare for it.)<br/>
<br/>
If there were a curriculum you could plug someone into based on their age<br/>
and have it work, then schools would run perfectly, if you see what I mean.<br/>
But we all learn differently. Different styles. Different paces. If they<br/>
don&#39;t like school because their learning style is incompatible with school<br/>
style learning, recreating school at home isn&#39;t going to work any better<br/>
than school at school. It&#39;s going to be stressful for them and stressful for<br/>
you. Not because there&#39;s something wrong with them but because there&#39;s<br/>
something wrong with school/curriculum!<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter, on the other hand, since she&#39;s asking to homeschool ... you<br/>
may want to look into unschooling for her. (The most common cause of people<br/>
giving up on homeschooling is doing school at home. That isn&#39;t the only<br/>
option!) With unschooling she can learn what she wants to learn and there&#39;s<br/>
no stress or strain of &quot;making them do their work&quot;. We just help them pursue<br/>
what they naturally are drawn to. It&#39;s very much like the way they learn to<br/>
speak English: learning is a side effect of using English to get what they<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of good books that give overviews of Homeschooling are:<br/>
<br/>
The Homeschooling Handbook<br/>
The Homeschooling Book of Answers<br/>
The Unschooling Handbook<br/>
<br/>
You may want to check out the Home Education Magazine groups on Yahoo. They<br/>
tend to be quiet until someone asks a question but there may be people there<br/>
with more knowledge of schoolish programs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737413037">The situation between the adults and kids is important.   By some  states&#39; <br/>
laws homeschooling has to be done by a parent, so without adoption or at  least <br/>
full legal guardianship, Clonlara would be a legal cover (they would be  <br/>
enrolled in an accredited school) for a questionable legal situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233116133">Thanks everyone for your info. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been unschooling with my daughter and not labeling it as such. <br/>
She&#39;s naturally curious, whereas the boys have been indoctrinated in <br/>
to having someone guide them along the way. And, man, this is hard to <br/>
get them to come up with something by themselves off the tops of <br/>
their heads. <br/>
<br/>
We do have legal guardianship of them. <br/>
<br/>
It is very discouraging to see that these boys have just been passed <br/>
from one grade to another without knowing certain things. I <br/>
definitely don&#39;t want to recreate the school scene, but for reading <br/>
and math for them, I may have to. I found out last night that the 7th <br/>
grader doesn&#39;t know or understand fractions. Upon his arrival I found <br/>
that he is basically a functioning illiterate. If I don&#39;t stand over <br/>
him, the homework doesn&#39;t get done and the whole family has to stay <br/>
up on in to the night &#39;til he&#39;s done. I&#39;m not going to stay up <br/>
another night like that again over 13 reading questions.<br/>
The other 2 boys: the oldest seems to be okay in math and catching on <br/>
to it better, however, doesn&#39;t comprehend what he reads in books too <br/>
well. The middle boy is the same in comprehension, but definitely <br/>
better at math.<br/>
<br/>
A GED is not an option for our household. If we don&#39;t see some <br/>
significant improvement by the time school is out for this summer, <br/>
we&#39;ll be pulling them out. I do know that this summer will be an <br/>
intensive in learning. I&#39;ve already asked my friend, the math <br/>
teacher, to step in and get everyone up to their levels of <br/>
understanding. We&#39;re not asking for them to start any new math <br/>
revolutions or anything; just understanding.<br/>
<br/>
The reading, language, and spelling, I will be helping with and in <br/>
different ways until we get to a point of where the supervision isn&#39;t <br/>
needed as much and we are doing more guidance (unschooling).<br/>
<br/>
My husband is the history buff, so there it is. This mixed with some <br/>
on hand experiences, along with consistency, I&#39;m sure will get them <br/>
on track and ready for their next step - whatever they want that to <br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 <br/>
Kirby (18) is taking Math 99 at the community college.  Kirby, who  never <br/>
took a math lesson once in his life before this, has an A average after  five <br/>
weeks (up from a B in the 4th week).  Others there, who have been to  school for <br/>
thirteen years, do not have an A.<br/>
 <br/>
That means that if you CONTINUE to try to force fractions into this poor  <br/>
child, you could be doing more harm than good, but he will resent you (you  <br/>
yourself personally) whereas he could have resented professionally trained  <br/>
teachers randomly provided by the state.<br/>
 <br/>
Will you guarantee his success?<br/>
No.<br/>
You are only guaranteed to disturb his peace, your peace, and the peace of  <br/>
your entire house.<br/>
 <br/>
Not knowing fractions didn&#39;t keep Kirby from passing a math placement test  <br/>
into the third level (not the beginning or second level).  And it wan&#39;ts  &quot;not <br/>
knowing fractions,&quot; it was not understanding the language of mathematical  <br/>
notation, which as languages go is NOT very consistent or clear.  Fractions  can <br/>
be shown all KINDS of ways.  Multiplication can be shown four or five  ways.   <br/>
 <br/>
Back off this boy, for his good.<br/>
Play games.  Build a deck or plant a garden or paint a room  or tile a floor <br/>
and don&#39;t say &quot;math,&quot; just let the real-life need for  math seep up from the <br/>
ground around his feet without comment.  Raining it  down on his head didn&#39;t <br/>
work in school, and you only keep the same wound open by  continuing that.   <br/>
 <br/>
Stop inflicting damage so that healing can happen.<br/>
 <br/>

-=-<br/>
 <br/>
You aren&#39;t likely to find support for this on an unschooling list.  <br/>
You can&#39;t &quot;Know&quot; that this summer will be intensive in learning.  It  might <br/>
be just intensive in frustration and waste of time for you and your math  <br/>
teacher friend, and in more and deeper sorrow for your young relatives.<br/>
 <br/>
Give them a summer of freedom, no matter what else you do.<br/>
 <br/>
If you think school&#39;s methods are good, and these kids only need MORE of  it, <br/>
maybe you need to stop moving, talking and reading and look as openly as you  <br/>
can at what you&#39;re seeing, at what your own life in school was like.<br/>
 <br/>
For some reason you don&#39;t need to tell us, these boys are not living with  <br/>
their own parents.  Something didn&#39;t go well for them, and healing would be  <br/>
worth more than all the math on earth right now.<br/>

 <br/>
Carts before horses, BIG time.  <br/>
If you unschool now, six lives improve now.  You&#39;ve scheduled years of  <br/>
anti-unschooling which will only make eventual unschooling harder IF you ever  get <br/>
there.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I&#39;m sure will get them <br/>
on track and ready for their next step -  whatever they want that to <br/>

What if their next step should be that they get OFF the track and graze in  a <br/>
wonderful pasture where they can learn without someone counting laps and  <br/>
whipping them on?<br/>

School and discipline aren&#39;t necessary for learning. Learning just happens<br/>
when someone is supported in following their interests.<br/>
<br/>
*But* it sounds like you are facing other factors and fears. It is<br/>
unfortunate that being a black male with no high school diploma isn&#39;t the<br/>

So maybe it will help you help them better to realize that you&#39;re actually<br/>

=============<br/>
 <br/>
They don&#39;t have any comparison group of kids who didn&#39;t go to school.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a black family here with a girl and two boys.  The mom&#39;s a  great <br/>
unschooler and the dad&#39;s totally resistant and critical all the time and  says <br/>
even though the mom has a degree in education, it&#39;s different for black  boys.<br/>
 <br/>
Black kids learn the same way anyone does--from curiosity, interest and  need <br/>
to know.<br/>
Black kids fail to learn the same way anyone does--from deciding the stuff  <br/>
is irrelevant or the teacher is trying to make them do things they don&#39;t want <br/>
to  do without regard for what they DO care about. <br/>
 <br/>
-=-I&#39;m not stressed at all about this, its a necessary <br/>
step.  <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Necessary&quot; is only true if there are no examples of success without those  <br/>
steps.  <br/>
&quot;Have to&quot; is belied by examples of those who did not do those things and  had <br/>
the same or better results.<br/>
 <br/>
Some people think they have to spank or their kids won&#39;t be honest or  kind.<br/>
My kids are honest and kind.  There is good evidence that spanking  makes <br/>
kids sneaky and mean, in fact, but even without that, if two families&#39;  kids are <br/>
equally honest and kind but one spanked and one didn&#39;t, spanking was  not <br/>
necessary.  They didn&#39;t have to.<br/>
 <br/>
Same with reading lessons.<br/>
Same with math lessons.<br/>

If you let them frolick long enough, they will gain understanding far  beyond <br/>
inklings in real ways.  <br/>

If you want &quot;a standard diploma&quot; via homeschool, your options are more <br/>
limited.  Some homeschooling curriculae are not fully accredited (some of the <br/>
Christian ones, if I understand correctly).   A GED is WAY, way cheaper and IS <br/>
&quot;accredited&quot; (recognized by the government as an equivalent of public school).  In <br/>
New Mexico, if one gets a GED before adulthood, it&#39;s a high school diploma <br/>
straight up, issued by the state board of education.   Says so:  High School <br/>
Diploma right on the diploma they send.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly other states have similar options.<br/>

  a standard diploma would be sought either via homeschool  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If you want &quot;a standard diploma&quot; via homeschool, your options are more <br/>
  limited.  Some homeschooling curriculae are not fully accredited (some of the <br/>
  Christian ones, if I understand correctly).   A GED is WAY, way cheaper and IS <br/>
  &quot;accredited&quot; (recognized by the government as an equivalent of public school).  In <br/>
  New Mexico, if one gets a GED before adulthood, it&#39;s a high school diploma <br/>
  straight up, issued by the state board of education.   Says so:  High School <br/>
  Diploma right on the diploma they send.<br/>
<br/>
  Possibly other states have similar options.<br/>

states now have a state-wide homeschooling organization. If you don&#39;t <br/>
know how to contact them, you can try looking at the NHEN website <br/>
&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt; under state legal information and in the support group <br/>
database there.<br/>

Ask on a local homeschooling list.  Someone with older kids will  know.  And <br/>
the law might have changed, too.  It changed in New Mexico  quite a bit <br/>
lately.  And you can probably just go to google and read about  your state&#39;s GED <br/>
policies.<br/>
