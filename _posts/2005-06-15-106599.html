<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660056092">Hi <br/>
I am new to the group - but I am preparing to homeschool my 4 year old and 1 year <br/>
old and need all the help I can get!<br/>
<br/>
I really like the unschooling and child-led learning idea.  I have one question though.<br/>
<br/>
My husband may have the opportunity in a few years to transfer to China for a year or <br/>
two with his work.  I am very excited about the opportunity for the kids to learn a new <br/>
language and culture.  The best way for them to learn the language probably will be <br/>
to put them in a chinese school while we are there.  If they just stay home with me . . <br/>
..  they won&#39;t learn as much.  I feel that homeschooling will give me the flexibility to <br/>
not worry about &quot;falling behind&quot; in school while we are theere.<br/>
<br/>
My question is - I really would like to study Chinese with the kids now to help prepare <br/>
them for this.  Especially with regard to schooling - If we put my oldest right into <br/>
Chinese 2nd or 3rd grade without preparation, he will be in for a very difficult time.  <br/>
How can I incorporate Chinese as a mandatory subject while still maintaining the <br/>
child-lead learning approach?</div>

You can&#39;t. And, unless you stay in the house and keep them in the <br/>

better than you are within 6 months, even if they are NOT in Chinese <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My suggestion would be to forget about classes and school. Check out any chinese cultural centers in the community so you can start to feel familiar with it. Starting reading books, watching movies, talking to people of chinese descent you may know, watching related news. It&#39;s not the language that&#39;s important, it&#39;s the culture that the language reflects. <br/>
<br/>
I was listening to an interview with Addriene Clarkson (of Chinese descent coincidentally), our (Canada&#39;s) Governor-General. It&#39;s technically the hishest post in our gov&#39;t and the Queen&#39;s representative in Canada. It&#39;s really a figurehead position. Anyway, she was talking about how she learned french. How she thought she&#39;d learn it was take classes. Didn&#39;t work really. So she went to France. There she had to learn it. She mentioned that she always had trouble with pronouncing the &quot;r&#39;s&quot; (french r&#39;s are weird) until one day driving by the Louvre, she said Louvre - and it clicked. Her idea was that it wasn&#39;t until she was there long enough for the culture to settle in her bones that she was able to finally &#39;get&#39; the language. That you can&#39;t truly learn a language until you have some feeling for the culture supporting it. <br/>
<br/>
My parents lived in Thailand for a couple of years. They never learned Thai (you think Chinese is tough? You don&#39;t know Thai) but they did get involved in the Thai community, attened cultural events, got a true sense of the people and made lifelong Thai friends. <br/>
<br/>
Frankly, learning to speak Chinese at the expense of diving into the culture would be like learning to read without loving books. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the language that important, it&#39;s the people and the culture. They may or may not end up speaking fluent chinese but please don&#39;t lock them up in school (or yourself up in the house!!!) for what may be an experience of a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Dawn (DON&quot;T SEND THEM TO SCHOOL THERE!!!)<br/>
<br/>
P.S. DON&#39;T !!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375213487">I live in Japan, and my kids were 3 and 1 when we got here.  Weve learned<br/>
lots by living, but please keep in mind that learning a language with a<br/>
totally different alphabet is a whole different animal than learning say,<br/>
German, French or Spanish.  I have friends who send their kids to Japanese<br/>
preschooltheir kids have not learned anymore language than mine have by<br/>
watching Japanese TV, shopping for everyday stuff, having a Japanese<br/>
housecleaner who speaks no English, and playing with the kids in the<br/>
neighborhood.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If they just stay home with me . .<br/>

not worry about &quot;falling behind&quot; in school while we are theere.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I dont get thisdo you want to homeshcool, or are you looking for<br/>
permission to put them in a chinese school?  Think for a minute how you<br/>
are going to feel when you get there youll be overwhelmed by all the<br/>
differences in daily lifedo you really want to add to that by suddenly<br/>
immersing them into school, too?<br/>
<br/>
In my book, you simply cant incorporate Chinese as a mandatory subject<br/>
while still maintaining the<br/>
child-lead learning approach.  We got Usbornes The First 1000 Words in<br/>
Japanese before we got here so wed know the words for some basics, but<br/>
Japanese grammar still escapes us.  We manage fine though, people are happy<br/>
to help.  Where in China are you going?  In most cities, almost everyone<br/>
speaks English anyway.  Another thought:  a year or two really isnt enough<br/>
time for much, if you spend it obsessing over Chinese School and language,<br/>
you might miss out on lots of cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Tami, who thinks the most valuable phrases to know in Japanese are Im<br/>
sorry and I dont understand.  Because I often am, and dont.<br/>
