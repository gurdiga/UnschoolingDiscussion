<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133852907">Given that a minute number of people might die from eating peanut butter or a <br/>
bee or wheat, discussing kids who are unlikely to face death in the <br/>
neighbor&#39;s fridge, I want to say that discussions which go to the total edges <br/>
of extremism don&#39;t do much good for those people still in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
There are moms (I could name some and give you their addresses but that would <br/>
be SO tacky, and anyway you can probably name as many yourself) who kind of <br/>
make up food allergies, or maybe have evil foods marked as magic sacrificial <br/>
foods.  It makes them feel like better parents to say no, and so they say no <br/>
in odd and arbitrary ways, sighing and rolling their eyes.  It happens not <br/>
just with foods.  Sometimes TV.  Sometimes not playing with kids from a <br/>
certain other town, or neighborhood, or religion.<br/>
<br/>
We have moms say loudly and with feeling in homeschooling group meetings <br/>
things like &quot;OH, if Bubba has soda he&#39;ll get hyper&quot; or &quot;No more sugar, <br/>
Trixie, you&#39;ll never calm down.&quot;  But we KNOW these kids, and sugar and soda <br/>
aren&#39;t their problem.  Maybe they have to say &quot;MOM&quot; five times with <br/>
increasing volume to get their mom&#39;s attention.  Maybe other people have to <br/>
come in TWICE and say &quot;Bubba fell down,&quot; or whatever.  But if the mom can <br/>
find something to blame the situation on and say the noise is escalating <br/>
because that new other new family brought donuts, instead of thinking maybe <br/>
the kids are getting more attention from donuts than their moms, that&#39;s <br/>
easier.  And they calm right down from having found their scapegoat.  Someone <br/>
else; a substance.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who was not the most honest of people. She admitted to it and <br/>
said she was trying to get better. She told me that her son wasn&#39;t allergic <br/>
to milk at all, but she had told some people he was, just because she didn&#39;t <br/>
want them giving him ice cream or cereal. It seemed more dramatic and <br/>
scientific and fair to say (dishonestly) &quot;lactose intolerant&quot; than &quot;I eat <br/>
sugar all the time but I don&#39;t want him to have much.&quot; Then a few months <br/>
later I was babysitting him and she told me when she left, &quot;He&#39;s allergic to <br/>
milk.&quot;    I ignored it; he was fine.  People who are liars need to learn to <br/>
keep their stories straight.<br/>
<br/>
Twin friends of mine moved to Los Alamos from Espanola when we were 13.  My <br/>
cousin and I had hung out with them weekly or better.  It&#39;s 18 miles, <br/>
physically, but a thousand socially.  The mom said they couldn&#39;t come to our <br/>
house anymore, but we could go to theirs.  We lived in the poor &quot;Mexican <br/>
town&quot; (only in Los Alamos did anyone use that term in northern New Mexico) <br/>
and it just wasn&#39;t safe.  <br/>
<br/>
Huh.   We went once, for an overnighter, and no more.  We lived in an old <br/>
adobe farmhouse, with a big yard to play in, and a parent always home.  At <br/>
their house, they lived in an old two-story quad barracks thing and the kids <br/>
nearly set it on fire while we were there putting a skirt over the lamp to <br/>
keep the light low.  They didn&#39;t have any that night,  but they talked about <br/>
having smoked dope (something we had never seen yet in the poor town down the <br/>
hill, but these kids had bought freely from other moneyed anglo kids in their <br/>
neighborhood).  So I quit visiting that safe &quot;better&quot; town and the girls <br/>
never ever came to visit us.  But golly their mom felt like a really great <br/>
mom.<br/>
<br/>
Too much of what passes as responsible parenting in some families is <br/>
arbitrary superstitious prejudice.  Parents want to feel better about their <br/>
parenting, and they care more about that than they care about really, truly <br/>
looking at the world through their child&#39;s eyes, and about being open to <br/>
really examining their own prejudices and beliefs.   Saying NO is way easier <br/>
in some families than saying yes, and often &quot;NO&quot; is wrapped in justifications <br/>
and excuses which are so flimsy that even little kids see them as falsehood.  <br/>
And that erodes trust between child and parent, and it erodes the child&#39;s <br/>
faith in the parents&#39; judgement and veracity.<br/>
<br/>
So in a family in which there is a true food allergy, it&#39;s worth those <br/>
parents remembering that they are in the company of others who say &quot;food <br/>
allergy&quot; when it&#39;s not really that at all.  Or others&#39;  kids are kept from a <br/>
food just in case that&#39;s the cause of their hives or excema or snotty nose or <br/>
whatever, and they suffer more stress from the deprivation than they would <br/>
from the actual symptoms.  <br/>
<br/>
We share the reputation with other homeschoolers, whether we punish our <br/>
children with a rod for looking out the kitchen window instead of studying <br/>
creation science or not.  It&#39;s not fair to deny truths around us.  <br/>
<br/>
The suggestion seemed to being made here that those of us who allow our <br/>
children freedom to choose whatever foods they want would risk their lives <br/>
about it.  I don&#39;t think it was rhetorically valid as an argument.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling might be a HORRIBLE choice for some families, totally unworkable, <br/>
some kids (for whatever mental or social reasons) might NEVER hang out at <br/>
home reading and playing and learning.  And in those families, unschooling <br/>
would not work.  But this is an unschooling list.  And so it&#39;s totally <br/>
reasonable for us to assume that readers are unschoolers or would like to be. <br/>
 And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to assume along with that that if we <br/>
talk about foods we&#39;re talking about average homeschooled kids without big <br/>
allergies.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think an entire school should be stripped of peanuts for two kids.<br/>
I don&#39;t think this list should be stripped of discussions about allowing kids <br/>
freedom, because a kid&#39;s mom might be exposed to something that would be <br/>
dangerous to her child if she tried it.  <br/>
<br/>
Nobody&#39;s going to scrape peanut butter, or an idea, off their keyboard and <br/>
die.  (Or if they do, the peanut butter will not have arrived by e-mail.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011343713">How is this so personal for someone with no personal experience? <br/>
<br/>
I think this topic is being seen as an attack on personal freedom. <br/>
I<br/>
want to preverve personal freedom in the freedom of<br/>
choice. <br/>
If we don&#39;t know our choices, we have none. If we don&#39;t hear that<br/>
food <br/>
reactions are a possible cause of some peoples&#39; real illness, then we <br/>
cannot explore the possibility for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
I want to add a few ideas to Sandra&#39;s post. I am the K, and Sandra is <br/>
the S. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
K- I agree. The complete dismissal of any real problems based on the <br/>
percieved inconsistancies of a few aquaintances is a bit extreme. Not <br/>
helpful at all for people in the middle, and a little damaging to the <br/>
few that are really experiencing troubles with foods and not believed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

&gt; certain other town, or neighborhood, or religion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K- Do you know any of these people well enough to ask their reasons <br/>
behind their choices? Are you upset by their human inconsistancy, the <br/>
fact that you disagree with their choices, or by their method of <br/>
expresing disaproval? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;&gt; We have moms say loudly and with feeling in homeschooling group <br/>
meetings <br/>
&gt; things like &quot;OH, if Bubba has soda he&#39;ll get hyper&quot; or &quot;No more<br/>

and soda <br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t their problem.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K- Are any of them close friends enough to you for you to see the<br/>
real <br/>
reactions of their kids on or off the foods? Do you only see them on <br/>
the days that there is a large gathering of people with lots of<br/>
excited <br/>
kids, and the mom wants to visit and hopes her kids will just play. I <br/>
agree that that&#39;s not an ideal approach to parenting. Many times I <br/>
supervise all the kids while other moms play, because it helps the<br/>
moms <br/>
relax for once. Saying something &quot;loudly and with feeling&quot; might be <br/>
asking for help, information or support, but I don&#39;t think ridicule<br/>
is <br/>
a helpful path.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;Maybe they have to say &quot;MOM&quot; five times with <br/>
&gt; increasing volume to get their mom&#39;s attention.  Maybe other people<br/>
have to <br/>
&gt; come in TWICE and say &quot;Bubba fell down,&quot; or whatever.  But if the<br/>
mom can <br/>

escalating <br/>
&gt; because that new other new family brought donuts, instead of<br/>
thinking maybe <br/>
&gt; the kids are getting more attention from donuts than their moms,<br/>
that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; easier.  And they calm right down from having found their<br/>
scapegoat.  Someone <br/>
&gt; else; a substance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K- I agree that there are moms who habitually ignore their kids, and <br/>
that the kids get desparate for attention. Even times when otherwise <br/>
attentive moms are engrossed and ignore their kids. This doesn&#39;t<br/>
prove <br/>
or disprove the idea that the donuts could be part of the problem for <br/>
some families. <br/>
<br/>
Here is my own anecdotal evidence on the topic of food at meetings <br/>
affecting the kids&#39; behavior. I was at a La Leche League meeting a<br/>
few <br/>
years back, and all the kids were playing pretty well until it was <br/>
snack time. I saw someone&#39;s sweet tempered 2yo daughter and 4yo son <br/>
fade into tears, agitation, red cheeks, and fighting a few minutes <br/>
after they ate some cookies. That is not scientific, purely<br/>
empirical. <br/>
Just an observation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
S-&quot;&gt; I had a friend who was not the most honest of people. She<br/>
admitted <br/>
to it and <br/>
&gt; said she was trying to get better. She told me that her son wasn&#39;t<br/>
allergic <br/>
&gt; to milk at all, but she had told some people he was, just because<br/>
she didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want them giving him ice cream or cereal. It seemed more dramatic<br/>
and <br/>
&gt; scientific and fair to say (dishonestly) &quot;lactose intolerant&quot; than<br/>
&quot;I eat <br/>
&gt; sugar all the time but I don&#39;t want him to have much.&quot; Then a few<br/>
months <br/>
&gt; later I was babysitting him and she told me when she left, &quot;He&#39;s<br/>
allergic to <br/>
&gt; milk.&quot;    I ignored it; he was fine.  People who are liars need to<br/>
learn to <br/>
&gt; keep their stories straight.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K- Did you lie to her and say you would follow, or had followed, her <br/>
instructions? Why is your idea about his health more important than <br/>
keeping your word to her? Your brief observation that he was fine is <br/>
not the final word. Reactions can take hours or days to develop.<br/>
Maybe <br/>
he has no sensitivity to it at all, but maybe she was trying an <br/>
elimination diet. OK too many maybes for this instance, but I say the <br/>
decision was not yours to make.<br/>
<br/>
I would like people to be as clear as they can without lying.<br/>
Sometimes <br/>
people might feel forced to lie and use more recognizable terms like <br/>
&quot;lactose intolerant&quot; to sound official if they feel that others will <br/>
not take their request for &quot;no sugar&quot; seriously. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s<br/>
a <br/>
useful approach and can actually damage your cause. I think it&#39;s hard <br/>
for parents who want better for their kids than what they do for <br/>
themselves. Wanting him to give up sugar but unwilling or able to do<br/>
it <br/>
herself. I think that comes back to addiction. Yeah everythings all <br/>
about addiction with me. Really though, if she&#39;s adddicted to sugar, <br/>
but doesn&#39;t want him to be also. It can be hard to live the life you <br/>
want to teach.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

girls <br/>
&gt; never ever came to visit us.  But golly their mom felt like a<br/>
really great <br/>
&gt; mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
K- I&#39;m not sure how this relates to food allergies. Was that about <br/>
control? That the mom was controlling of social apperances yet not of <br/>
drugs. Or about poor parenting? Or your own regretted misjudgement of <br/>
the friends because of their drug use? Or what?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
S-&quot;&gt; Too much of what passes as responsible parenting in some<br/>
families <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; arbitrary superstitious prejudice.  Parents want to feel better<br/>
about their <br/>
&gt; parenting, and they care more about that than they care about<br/>

&gt; looking at the world through their child&#39;s eyes, and about being<br/>
open to <br/>
&gt; really examining their own prejudices and beliefs.   Saying NO is<br/>

&gt; and excuses which are so flimsy that even little kids see them as<br/>
falsehood.  <br/>
&gt; And that erodes trust between child and parent, and it erodes the<br/>
child&#39;s <br/>
&gt; faith in the parents&#39; judgement and veracity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So in a family in which there is a true food allergy, it&#39;s worth<br/>
those <br/>
&gt; parents remembering that they are in the company of others who say<br/>
&quot;food <br/>
&gt; allergy&quot; when it&#39;s not really that at all.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K- We are reminded of that constantly by the dismissal and doubt. By <br/>
the many who question our parenting as being arbitrary and<br/>
controlling <br/>
instead of just accepting that we are just trying to work out what <br/>
really is a problem for us or not. I would be helpful for others to <br/>
keep an open mind that it could be real. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;Or others&#39;  kids are kept from a <br/>
&gt; food just in case that&#39;s the cause of their hives or excema or<br/>
snotty nose or <br/>
&gt; whatever, and they suffer more stress from the deprivation than<br/>
they would <br/>
&gt; from the actual symptoms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
K- Many parents have said that their allergic kids feel deprived and <br/>
binge, others say their kids understand and feel good about taking<br/>
care <br/>
of themselves. The binging may have more to do with addiction than<br/>
with <br/>
social deprivation. I still question why certain foods are so<br/>
socially <br/>
important and sacred anyway. Why are the things that are the worst<br/>
for <br/>
us considered treats? Maybe because they might be reserved for<br/>
special <br/>
occasions like birthdays and thanksgiving, not for everyday. If<br/>
sugary <br/>
high fat stuff was reserved for feast days instead of breakfast,<br/>
lunch, <br/>
and dinner, then there might not be an obesity epidemic in this <br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
But that of course comes back to control. I agree that the best way<br/>
to <br/>
teach self control and moderation is by example. I don&#39;t buy junk<br/>
foods <br/>
because I don&#39;t want to eat them, not to punish or control my kids.<br/>
The <br/>
foods that affect us like drugs, I will not buy, frankly for the same <br/>
reason I don&#39;t buy any other drugs that make us ill. On special <br/>
occasions my kids seem ok to enjoy cake and ice cream for birthdays, <br/>
pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving. They complain afterwards of tummyaches<br/>
and <br/>
runny nose and cough, but maybe that will help them learn for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to have any foods available all the time, but that<br/>
wasn&#39;t <br/>
working for us right now. Maybe things will change, or maybe like an <br/>
alcoholic who can never drink again, we&#39;d be better off avoiding <br/>
certain foods completely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
S-&quot;&gt; We share the reputation with other homeschoolers, whether we <br/>
punish our <br/>
&gt; children with a rod for looking out the kitchen window instead of<br/>
studying <br/>
&gt; creation science or not.  It&#39;s not fair to deny truths around us.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The suggestion seemed to being made here that those of us who allow<br/>
our <br/>
&gt; children freedom to choose whatever foods they want would risk<br/>
their lives <br/>
&gt; about it.  I don&#39;t think it was rhetorically valid as an argument.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K- The suggestion that was made is that some children have a life <br/>
threatening allergy, and if a parent who is aware of the problem<br/>
allows <br/>
them the freedom to choose whatever they want, that could be a risk<br/>
to <br/>
their life if they are not old enough to ask every question of every <br/>
food, or to have the self control to avoid it. I am all for kids<br/>
having <br/>
plenty of healthy choices of what and when and how much to eat. <br/>
Learning to develop your own choices is very important.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s back to control and freedom again.<br/>
<br/>
With freedom comes responsibility. There are different opinions about <br/>
when children are old enough for different degrees of freedom and <br/>
responsibility. All kids, families, and people are different and<br/>
things <br/>
change. I think that the best person to determine what freedoms the <br/>
child is ready for is the observant responsive guardian at first,<br/>
then <br/>
gradually as the kid gets more real experience it shifts to the kid. <br/>
That might bristle those who want to kids to have absolute freedom. I <br/>
say that as parents we make choices for the newborn and gradually do <br/>
less as they do more. Conventional parenting seems to say that the <br/>
parent dictates every choice and the child must obey. I say the lucky <br/>
parent who follows the child&#39;s true needs will raise a more<br/>
responsible <br/>
happier person. I mean needs like mutual respect, self regulation, <br/>
accomplishment, and responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
You allow you kids the freedom to choose because that&#39;s what works<br/>
for <br/>
you. Anyone who experiences real problems with certain foods is free<br/>
to <br/>
choose to avoid them, and to ask that any caregiver follow that<br/>
choice <br/>
also. If you are not comfortable with that, then the honest thing to<br/>
do <br/>
is to decline to watch the kid.<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
 <br/>
S-&quot;&gt; Unschooling might be a HORRIBLE choice for some families,<br/>
totally <br/>
unworkable, <br/>
&gt; some kids (for whatever mental or social reasons) might NEVER hang<br/>
out at <br/>
&gt; home reading and playing and learning.  And in those families,<br/>
unschooling <br/>
&gt; would not work.  But this is an unschooling list.  And so it&#39;s<br/>
totally <br/>
&gt; reasonable for us to assume that readers are unschoolers or would<br/>
like to be. <br/>
&gt;  And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to assume along with that that<br/>
if we <br/>
&gt; talk about foods we&#39;re talking about average homeschooled kids<br/>
without big <br/>
&gt; allergies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K- What is your point? That we cannot discuss the possibility of any <br/>
food allergies because you feel that average kids don&#39;t have big<br/>
ones? <br/>
There are a few homeschooled kids with big allergies. There also are <br/>
homeschooled kids with allergies that are not life threatening, but<br/>
are <br/>
also real. There are homeschooled kids that may have hidden allergies <br/>
that parents could look into if they choose. There are many<br/>
homescholed <br/>
kids who have no allergies at all. I think that as curious <br/>
homeschoolers all topics can be up for discussion as they relate to <br/>
life, science, health, and personal empowerment through healthy <br/>
discussion.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t think an entire school should be stripped of peanuts for <br/>
two kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
K- They are not your two kids. Peanuts are not sacred. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t think this list should be stripped of discussions about <br/>
allowing kids <br/>
&gt; freedom, because a kid&#39;s mom might be exposed to something that<br/>
would be <br/>
&gt; dangerous to her child if she tried it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
K- Whenever was that a real concern? Nowhere was it even suggested.<br/>
It <br/>
seems though that you are suggesting stripping the list of discussion <br/>
of food allergies because the average homeschooler doesn&#39;t have big <br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
I think you mean that you feel that some posts have suggested <br/>
discussions of freedom of kids are not safe for the list, because <br/>
people with kids who have life threatening allergies might be tempted <br/>
by a discussion of allowing kids freedom, to let their kids eat <br/>
anything. I haven&#39;t seen that, nor do I think it&#39;s a real danger.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want to restrict discussion. I would like it to be open and <br/>
honest. You are free to say that you feel allergies are just an<br/>
excuse <br/>
for poor parenting and restricting freedom, and I am free to suggest <br/>
that they could be real for some, and for everyone to do their own <br/>
research.<br/>
<br/>
We all know that people dealing with life threatening allergies are<br/>
not <br/>
fools. They research and deal with it the best they can. They put up <br/>
with derision, dismissal, and criticism from those who have no clue. <br/>
They will not be harmed by real discussions of freedom. They actually <br/>
have a good deal more at stake than some when the issues of their <br/>
freedoms are concerned.<br/>
<br/>
I understand you don&#39;t want your absolute freedom to be remotely <br/>
interferred with by anyone elses&#39; needs, but that&#39;s not life in a <br/>
society. We are together because we look out for each other,<br/>
otherwise <br/>
I guess you could live in a remote hut completely free of any social <br/>
ties, or restrictions on your freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I would miss you if you lived in a hut.<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>

S-&quot;&gt; Nobody&#39;s going to scrape peanut butter, or an idea, off their <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra&quot;<br/>

By their dishonesty and willingness to grasp at the first reasonable <br/>
explanation and cling to it instead of REALLY looking, and thinking, and <br/>
trying things that would  make their children&#39;s lives easier instead of just <br/>
making their own easier.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know this was aimed at me until I saw the rest of the post.  <br/>
-=-How is this so personal for someone with no personal experience? -=-<br/>
<br/>
How is &quot;no personal experience&quot; true?  Because I don&#39;t have a child with <br/>
allergies?  <br/>
<br/>
-=-But we KNOW these kids, and sugar<br/>
and soda aren&#39;t their problem.&quot; <br/>
K- Are any of them close friends enough to you for you to see the<br/>
real reactions of their kids on or off the foods? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Kids I&#39;ve known for years, who stay at my house sometimes.  Whom I&#39;ve seen <br/>
with and without the alleged &quot;cause.&quot;  Yes, people I know and then others I <br/>
don&#39;t know whose moms are acting the same way.  Copycat behavior.   Going <br/>
with the predominant prejudiced flow.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Saying something &quot;loudly and with feeling&quot; might be <br/>
asking for help, information or support, but I don&#39;t think ridicule<br/>
is a helpful path.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t ridicule them, I either ignore them or get their kids in a better <br/>
social situation (outside, or in another room) so they CAN be hyper (WHY <br/>
shouldn&#39;t kids be active and loud at a playgroup?).   If Holly&#39;s  having fun <br/>
we stay; if not we go.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby and Marty were young we had hours-long unschooling get-togethers <br/>
at our house or the nearby park weekly, for years (until two years ago).  <br/>
There are several families I&#39;ve known lem peacefully and directly.  They were <br/>
always looking for things to blame for normal kid behavior.  Some are still <br/>
unschooling.  Some are over here (the kids lots, sometimes parents) a time or <br/>
two a week.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Did you lie to her and say you would follow, or had followed, her <br/>
instructions? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No.  (That could only be asked by someone who doesn&#39;t know me very well!)<br/>
I didn&#39;t say a word.  I let him eat what he wanted to, which was very little <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
-=-OK too many maybes for this instance, but I say the <br/>
decision was not yours to make.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What decision?  To take the mom&#39;s word that she was a liar?<br/>
To keep  her son for free?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would like people to be as clear as they can without lying.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It is my life&#39;s habit to be as clear as I can be and not lie.<br/>
<br/>
-=-K- I&#39;m not sure how this relates to food allergies. Was that about <br/>
control? That the mom was controlling of social apperances yet not of <br/>
drugs. Or about poor parenting? Or your own regretted misjudgement of <br/>
the friends because of their drug use? Or what?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Parental short-cuts.  Parental arbitrary decision designed to make them feel <br/>
like good parents.  Deciding in advance what is good for your children, and <br/>
sticking to it regardless of evidence (or failing to look for evidence once <br/>
the &quot;good&quot; decision has been made).<br/>
<br/>
About putting rules (parental decision) above kids, and putting bad logic <br/>
above living with your children in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I would be helpful for others to <br/>
keep an open mind that it could be real. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all real.<br/>
<br/>
Some allergies are more real than others.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Many parents have said that their allergic kids feel deprived and <br/>
binge, others say their kids understand and feel good about taking<br/>
care <br/>
of themselves. The binging may have more to do with addiction than<br/>
with <br/>
social deprivation. -=-<br/>
<br/>
By this logic, any teen or adult who rejects the parental restrictions when <br/>
freedom hits and goes ahead and eats wheat or sugar has proven the parent <br/>
right!  The child WAS an addict, proving that by not continuing the food ban <br/>
for life?<br/>
<br/>
-=- still question why certain foods are so<br/>
socially important and sacred anyway.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Look at the history of foods for this.  Try to find a culture with nothing <br/>
breadlike or porridge-like (or both).   See what special ingredients might be <br/>
too expensive for daily use and what is saved for celebrations.  It&#39;s in <br/>
history, in the real world, in every culture.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Why are the things that are the worst<br/>
for us considered treats?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s true.  There are traditional seasonal or holiday <br/>
foods that are not the worst-for-us foods.  It&#39;s rarity that makes a treat, <br/>
not bodily damage.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Learning to develop your own choices is very important.<br/>
It&#39;s back to control and freedom again.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the unschooling list can ever get off the ideas of control and <br/>
freedom, since it&#39;s the basis of letting go of the controls of &quot;teaching&quot; and <br/>
schedules and deadlines and required writing and forced reading.  <br/>
<br/>
Without options, a child cannot learn to &quot;develop their own choices.&quot;  If the <br/>
foods are highly restricted, some children will choose to be sneaky or eat <br/>
elsewhere.  They can&#39;t choose fruit over cake if there was no cake available. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A child can&#39;t clean his room by his own choice (as Marty did a few weeks <br/>
back--big reorganization) if room cleaning is mandated.  If it is mandated on <br/>
a schedule, the child can ONLY &quot;choose&quot; by choosing not to cooperate.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s family of origin set up that kind of &quot;choice&quot;--the &quot;my way or <br/>
the highway&quot; scenario.   We have in full knowledge of our intent set out <br/>
never to do that to our kids.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I think that the best person to determine what freedoms the <br/>
child is ready for is the observant responsive guardian at first,<br/>
then gradually as the kid gets more real experience it shifts to the kid. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My mother in law still tells adults just what to do and how, and chortles <br/>
derisively at anything except &quot;Okay!  right now! Thanks!.&quot;   A notable <br/>
quote--Kirby was five days or so old when she came to see him, and I asked if <br/>
she wanted to change his diaper (I thought it was a generous, friendly thing <br/>
to offer; she had been a nurse and the mother of three boys).  She came back <br/>
and said bruskly with no eye contact &quot;You have to get him circumcised.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(And don&#39;t bother to ask if I lied and said I would.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I say the lucky parent who follows the child&#39;s true needs will raise a more<br/>
responsible happier person.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She was sure that her children truly needed to do what she said without <br/>
hestitation or question until they were out of her house.  Guess how quickly <br/>
they were all out of her house?  Navy, run-away, college in another city.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You allow you kids the freedom to choose because that&#39;s what works<br/>
for you. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Many families do NOT allow children choice because they don&#39;t believe it <br/>
would work, they are unwillint to try it, because they don&#39;t WANT it to work. <br/>
 They like control.  (TV, &quot;schoolwork,&quot; bedtime, clothing choices, book <br/>
choices, friends, hobbies...)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyone who experiences real problems with certain foods is free<br/>
to choose to avoid them, and to ask that any caregiver follow that<br/>
choice also. If you are not comfortable with that, then the honest thing to<br/>
do is to decline to watch the kid.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had kids come to visit who, AFTER the parent has left says &quot;I&#39;m not allow<br/>
ed to watch TV,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not allowed to play with weapons&quot; or whatever.  <br/>
Fine!  They can, themselves, avoid such things.  But other than telling my <br/>
kids it would be nice if they did something else, I have never said &quot;OKAY <br/>
THEN!  TV ban for everyone!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If parents want to leave their children at my house but they don&#39;t like my <br/>
rules (and I&#39;m not talking about peanuts) they shouldn&#39;t leave them there.  <br/>
<br/>
If I took money to watch other people&#39;s kids then I&#39;d negotiate.  But there&#39;s <br/>
not enough money in the world to get me to lie to kids and say &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>
have this because it&#39;s bad for you&quot; if I don&#39;t believe it.  There&#39;s not <br/>
enough money to get me to control other people&#39;s kids arbitrarily just <br/>
because the parents would like to do it but they want to go and do something <br/>
else for a while.<br/>
<br/>
This culture is filled with people who DO like to boss younger people around. <br/>
 Let them take the money and do it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-K- What is your point? That we cannot discuss the possibility of any <br/>
food allergies because you feel that average kids don&#39;t have big<br/>
ones? <br/>
There are a few homeschooled kids with big allergies. There also are <br/>
homeschooled kids with allergies that are not life threatening, but<br/>
are <br/>
also real. There are homeschooled kids that may have hidden allergies <br/>
that parents could look into if they choose. There are many<br/>
homescholed <br/>
kids who have no allergies at all. I think that as curious <br/>
homeschoolers all topics can be up for discussion as they relate to <br/>
life, science, health, and personal empowerment through healthy <br/>
discussion.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking some people might be suffering a bad reaction to the discussion.<br/>
Who decides if it&#39;s healthy?<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to me that the tone of the suggestion was more that those who allow <br/>
their children freedom (not just of food) are neglectful, but those who are <br/>
being controlling are being responsible.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe there should be an unschooling with allergies list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You are free to say that you feel allergies are just an<br/>
excuse <br/>
for poor parenting and restricting freedom, and I am free to suggest <br/>
that they could be real for some, and for everyone to do their own <br/>
research.-=-<br/>
<br/>
YES but I didn&#39;t say that.  So you&#39;ve paraphrased me wrongly and addressed <br/>
that.  It&#39;s called attacking a straw man.<br/>
<br/>
There are real food allergies.  And there are parents who make some up, or <br/>
hope for a food allergy instead of looking for behavioral changes.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about changing the way we live.  No two ways about that.  If <br/>
some people come to it without a willingness to consider change, it&#39;s <br/>
probably not going to work for them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I guess you could live in a remote hut completely free of any social <br/>
ties, or restrictions on your freedom.<br/>
-=-I would miss you if you lived in a hut.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How can you tell who lives in remote huts and who doesn&#39;t by e-mail?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not free of social ties, and I arrange for my kids to have a lot of <br/>
freedom.  Free to come or go, they stay here and their friends do, too.  Free <br/>
to go to school or not, they don&#39;t.  Free to eat what they want, they eat an <br/>
amazingly balanced diet.  Free to stay up or sleep, they sleep every single <br/>
night.  <br/>

pressure to remember that most people won&#39;t. We can&#39;t control what others<br/>
do. We can only control ourselves. Someone can tell people here how to<br/>
behave, but they can choose to ignore the advice. And there will always be<br/>
new people coming in who haven&#39;t heard the advice. There will be people out<br/>
in the real world who haven&#39;t heard it.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes people are offering general advice as a beginning point and<br/>
others are taking it as specific rules to be applied all across the board.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think of &quot;rules&quot; at all in my life, but of principles. <br/>
<br/>
And that is probably why unschooling isn&#39;t just about books to me (how COULD <br/>
it be, when learning is everywhere?), and why the same principle that says <br/>
it&#39;s okay if a kid of mine rejects Harry Potter and I need to not shame him <br/>
about that reactionary, stubborn stance (I&#39;m  joking in the presentation; I <br/>
don&#39;t shame them, and it IS reactionary and stubborn, which I haven&#39;t said to <br/>
them, but they know it and would say it themselves).  It&#39;s okay if a child <br/>
would rather play alone than watch a movie with the rest of us.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be okay if one of my kids wanted to have Thanksgiving with another <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
That has to do with my faith in them, my lack of possessive jealousy about <br/>
where they learn things or how, my confidence in their trust and awareness, <br/>
and many other factors which have come about because of my beliefs, which are <br/>
strengthened and reinforced by my children&#39;s responses to my practices.<br/>
<br/>
So.  When people come to talk about unschooling and they&#39;re having ANY <br/>
problems, it&#39;s worth looking at their beliefs and helping them clarify the <br/>
principles on which they want to base their unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If they want unschooling to fit in the same space and time that structured <br/>
homeschooling was fitting in, it&#39;s not going to work.<br/>
<br/>
If they want unschooling to guarantee that their child is &quot;ahead&quot; in all <br/>
&quot;subject areas&quot; and gets into college &quot;early,&quot; it&#39;s not going to work.  There <br/>
are no guarantees.  It&#39;s a day by day living, not a teach-to-the-test program.<br/>
<br/>
If they want their children to loosen up and make &quot;good decisions,&quot;  the <br/>
first focus needs to be what the parents consider &quot;good&quot; and why!!  The <br/>
difference between a good kid and a bad kid is often parental expectation.<br/>
<br/>
So discussing the success or improvement or consideration of unschooling is  <br/>
not going to be about science and math and writing at its base.  It&#39;s going <br/>
to be about control and belief and thought and trust (both ways).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041872978">Final episode on this topic for me, Sandra is of course wanted to share <br/>
her thoughts as well. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to be respectful, but I am not always that bright. I do <br/>
want her to be herself, and I hope she can see that sometimes<br/>
what seems like an argument, can really be two people who agree on the <br/>
basics, but not always the terminology. We both want<br/>
thoughtful caring adults to raise independent healthy children. We <br/>
don&#39;t like hypocrites, control freaks, or labeling people (yes<br/>
joke). We want our kids to learn to make their own decisions, and for <br/>
them to decide what&#39;s best for themselves. <br/>
<br/>
here goes. I am again the K, and Sandra will be played by the letter S. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
S-&quot;&gt; How is &quot;no personal experience&quot; true?  Because I don&#39;t have a <br/>
child with <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; allergies?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- I think that is the definition I was thinking of. Also that you have <br/>
not mentioned any personal (as in you personally) experience with food <br/>
reactions of your own. I am happy that you don&#39;t have to put up with <br/>
any of it and are free. <br/>
<br/>
Your 2 cents worth of experiences with liars and control freaks then <br/>
falls ito the category of heresay, which seemed to merely echo <br/>
society&#39;s claim that it is all hogwash. You granted the some are real <br/>
and some are not. That is true of anything, yet it makes the people in <br/>
the middle even more suspicious that we just make it all up. Perhaps <br/>
research on the subject would give you more insight into the problem. I <br/>
enjoyed the book &quot;Is This Your Child&quot; by Doris Rapp. There are others, <br/>
but this is a good start.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t ridicule them,&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Not to their face then, just on a list of 600 strangers. Of course that <br/>

real, the searching for answers. It&#39;s hard to remember that most<br/>
people are just trying their best with what they&#39;ve learned so far. <br/>
Helping is more useful than judgment. I know that people don&#39;t<br/>
always want help, but saying what works for us has given other people <br/>
freedom to consider new possibilities. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- What if the parent was right? What if the parent was wrong? If they <br/>
were right the child may bee in good physical health and really notice <br/>
that the binge made them ill. If they were wrong the child could learn <br/>
that it was not a problem after all. I guess you&#39;re upset that the <br/>
child lost all those years of making their own decisions. I agree with <br/>
that, yet I feel conflict about health and freedom. I don&#39;t think they <br/>
have to be mutually exclusive, yet I am sure the balance is possible.<br/>
<br/>
Are you disagreeing with the idea of addiction? I don&#39;t really know <br/>
what I think of addiction. I am still asking lots of<br/>
questions. There are so many other issues that come up when anyone <br/>
talks about binge foods- self control, will power, stress,<br/>
social pressure. They are related but how can people stop binges? <br/>
Someone here said that they kept some of the foods in the<br/>
house and that stopped the bingeing at friends&#39; houses. So far for us, <br/>
we just binge here instead if I do buy the foods. I am not<br/>
trying to fight with anyone. I am really asking 600 people if they have <br/>
any other thoughts on the subject besides that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen to sensible people. This is not a food disorders list, I know <br/>
that. It is a list of curious people though, who don&#39;t always<br/>
follow society&#39;s line, and do find their own answers. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s true.  There are traditional seasonal or <br/>
holiday <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; foods that are not the worst-for-us foods.  It&#39;s rarity that makes a treat, <br/>
&gt; not bodily damage.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I am using the word treat the way I hear it used most often. <br/>
&quot;Treat yourself to dessert (daily), have a treat at the store (candy), <br/>
buy a treat at the movies&quot;, all over the place every day, as if you&#39;re <br/>
not normal if you avoid that stuff. If treat only meant rarity that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a problem. It&#39;s the on going bombardment of junk foods at <br/>
every house,<br/>
halloween/easter/christmas/valentine&#39;s candy that is passed out all <br/>
over the place, the high fat/sugar/salt diet that is most people&#39;s<br/>
idea if regular food. The idea that to avoid this kind of food is <br/>
unnatural and bad. I&#39;m trying to keep the kids healthy enough to<br/>
learn the difference. If you&#39;re constantly in a drugged state, you <br/>
won&#39;t notice it, but if you are fine until you have the cake and ice<br/>
cream, you&#39;ll learn the connection. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; Without options, a child cannot learn to &quot;develop their own <br/>
choices.&quot;  If the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; foods are highly restricted, some children will choose to be sneaky or eat <br/>
&gt; elsewhere.  They can&#39;t choose fruit over cake if there was no cake available.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- I guess that I don&#39;t highly restrict foods. I don&#39;t buy things that <br/>
are junk because they&#39;re just not food. They are treats that can<br/>
be had once in awhile, but not every day, every week. <br/>
<br/>
My kids turn down junk sometimes, or just have a little. Not because <br/>
I&#39;m hovering over them with a whip, but because they eat<br/>
whatever they want most of the time. I haven&#39;t made any food evil or <br/>
forbidden, just I try not to buy stuff that makes us sick. Is<br/>
that nuts? I really am still learning about all this food stuff. <br/>
<br/>
If you or your own children have never binged, how do you know what&#39;s <br/>
the right thing to do about it? I don&#39;t know myself. <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
S-&quot;&gt; A child can&#39;t clean his room by his own choice (as Marty did a few <br/>
weeks <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; back--big reorganization) if room cleaning is mandated.  If it is mandated on <br/>
&gt; a schedule, the child can ONLY &quot;choose&quot; by choosing not to cooperate. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband&#39;s family of origin set up that kind of &quot;choice&quot;--the &quot;my way or <br/>
&gt; the highway&quot; scenario.   We have in full knowledge of our intent set out <br/>
&gt; never to do that to our kids.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;K-&quot; -=-I think that the best person to determine what freedoms the <br/>
&gt; child is ready for is the observant responsive guardian at first, <br/>
&gt; then gradually as the kid gets more real experience it shifts to the kid. -=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; My mother in law still tells adults just what to do and how, and <br/>
chortles <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; derisively at anything except &quot;Okay!  right now! Thanks!.&quot;   A notable <br/>
&gt; quote--Kirby was five days or so old when she came to see him, and I asked if <br/>
&gt; she wanted to change his diaper (I thought it was a generous, friendly thing <br/>
&gt; to offer; she had been a nurse and the mother of three boys).  She came back <br/>
&gt; and said bruskly with no eye contact &quot;You have to get him circumcised.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (And don&#39;t bother to ask if I lied and said I would.)&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- I agree that some people (nosey relatives) are not moved by <br/>
arguments that you are doing the right thing by your best<br/>
available knowledge. Sometimes I just say that (whatever) is working <br/>
well for us and we&#39;re happy thanks. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;k-&quot; -=-I say the lucky parent who follows the child&#39;s true needs will raise a more <br/>
&gt; responsible happier person.-=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; She was sure that her children truly needed to do what she said <br/>
without <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hestitation or question until they were out of her house.  Guess how quickly <br/>
&gt; they were all out of her house?  Navy, run-away, college in another city.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- You snipped away the part where I said what I thought a few of a <br/>
child&#39;s true needs are. Self control, mutual respect,<br/>
accomplishment. <br/>
<br/>
Actually the Navy sounds like another place for someone to be expected <br/>
to do what they&#39;re told without hesitation or question.<br/>
Ironic. A very challenging career is the military. Many people excel <br/>
and serve with honors, and learn very useful skills. <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;k&quot; -=-Anyone who experiences real problems with certain foods is free <br/>

&gt; do is to decline to watch the kid.-=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>S-&quot;&gt; I&#39;ve had kids come to visit who, AFTER the parent has left says <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not allow <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ed to watch TV,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not allowed to play with weapons&quot; or whatever. <br/>
&gt; Fine!  They can, themselves, avoid such things.  But other than telling my <br/>
&gt; kids it would be nice if they did something else, I have never said &quot;OKAY <br/>
&gt; THEN!  TV ban for everyone!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- Why not? Is TV sacred? I don&#39;t think TV is evil. Maybe the parent <br/>
meant no violent power rangers stuff, or that they wanted<br/>
them to play instead of veg. <br/>
<br/>
I guess that you don&#39;t want to deprive anybody, or to make your kids <br/>
dread his visit. It&#39;s hard to know when to respect another<br/>
parent&#39;s wishes or not. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
S-&quot;&gt; If parents want to leave their children at my house but they don&#39;t <br/>
like my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rules (and I&#39;m not talking about peanuts) they shouldn&#39;t leave them there.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- Maybe they aren&#39;t aware of that your rules come before theirs, or <br/>
that there&#39;s any difference. <br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
S-&quot;&gt; If I took money to watch other people&#39;s kids then I&#39;d negotiate.  <br/>
But there&#39;s <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not enough money in the world to get me to lie to kids and say &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have this because it&#39;s bad for you&quot; if I don&#39;t believe it.  There&#39;s not <br/>
&gt; enough money to get me to control other people&#39;s kids arbitrarily just <br/>
&gt; because the parents would like to do it but they want to go and do something <br/>
&gt; else for a while.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- Then you would not negotiate. Money has nothing to do with it. They <br/>
don&#39;t owe you anything if you agreed to watch the kids<br/>
for free. It doesn&#39;t make you better than them. If you don&#39;t like their <br/>
restrictions on their kids, maybe you can help nurture the<br/>
kids in other ways. <br/>

S-&quot;&gt; It seemed to me that the tone of the suggestion was more that <br/>
those who allow <br/>

&gt; being controlling are being responsible.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- My original post was about parents of children with allergies, not <br/>
all parents. I think that all parents, with or without allergies,<br/>
allow as much freedom as they think is safe. I hope like you do that <br/>
they will base their judgments on their own children&#39;s&#39; needs<br/>
and abilities, not on the fears or failings of the adult. <br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
S-&quot;&gt; Maybe there should be an unschooling with allergies list.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think we are free to make one. I also think it is not necessary to <br/>
push a topic off to a separate list right away. Many things are<br/>
discussed here, even the weather. I will not keep beating this though. <br/>
The question is out there, any replies would be interesting,<br/>
but I will not ask it again. <br/>

addressed <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- I&#39;ve addressed everything else point by point, in exhausting detail <br/>
to both of your posts. Sorry that I chucked all my feelings<br/>
together into the straw man. <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>

K- I can tell by the content that you are not alone in a hut with a <br/>
satellite connection. No one who writes to as many posts as you do has <br/>
any desire to be alone.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
S- &quot;&gt; I&#39;m not free of social ties, and I arrange for my kids to have a <br/>
lot of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; freedom.  Free to come or go, they stay here and their friends do, too.Free <br/>
&gt; to go to school or not, they don&#39;t.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- I am curious, would you send your kids to school if they begged? How <br/>
old are they. What have you told them about school<br/>
that could influence their decision. I have told my kids when they <br/>
asked how I felt about my time at school. That may have<br/>
influenced them some, for better or worse. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
S- &quot;Free to eat what they want, they eat an <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; amazingly balanced diet.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- Do they shop with you and help plan the meals? I think that is <br/>
important to have freedom of choice. Do you cook or do they?<br/>
Do you all sit down for one meal a day? We do sometimes. Do you take <br/>
turns planning the meals, or do you just graze. We graze<br/>
alot. <br/>
<br/>
S- &quot;Free to stay up or sleep, they sleep every single <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; night.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- Again I think that could depend on the age. Mine are still too <br/>
little to be up without me. We all sleep together though, so<br/>
bedtime is a nice cozy thing. <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sandra&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-K- Now that&#39;s just thoughtless. In an earlier post someone said that <br/>
&gt; they admired that you &quot;wrote from the soul&quot;. I would like to see some <br/>
&gt; of that.-=- <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>S- &quot;&gt; It wasn&#39;t thoughtless in any way.  If you haven&#39;t &quot;seen some of <br/>
that,&quot; you <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; don&#39;t know my writing well enough to decide whether it&#39;s &quot;from the soul&quot; or <br/>
&gt; not.   And you will never know my voice well enough to be the judge of <br/>
&gt; whether I was sincere or thoughtful. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Assume I&#39;m sincere and thoughtful, and if you&#39;re too bothered by the writing, <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t read it.  I don&#39;t want to stop writing because it&#39;s disturbing two or <br/>
&gt; three of several hundred people. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>K- Agreed. We will both assume that we&#39;re sincere and thoughtful. I <br/>
thought that you could tell by my detailed posts that I thought<br/>
you were already. <br/>
<br/>
Of course you will not stop writing, I&#39;m sure that has not been <br/>
requested. <br/>
<br/>
I did expect that making a joke about people dying from peanut butter <br/>
on the keyboard would be thought of as unfeeling before<br/>
you sent it. That is what I meant about thoughtless. I am being too <br/>
literal for most, but it isn&#39;t a joke really. I suppose I have no<br/>
sense of humor for that kind of humor. It wasn&#39;t a joke about really <br/>
dying of course, but it was an &quot;I don&#39;t care about any whiny<br/>
problems because they exaggerate everything&quot; type of feeling. If that <br/>
was not your intent, then my apologies. <br/>
<br/>
For all my verbosity it may be hard to imagine that I am quite new to <br/>
this list. I have only been on for a couple of weeks I think. I<br/>
admit that I haven&#39;t followed enough of your posts on other topics to <br/>
know your writing well at all. All I know is what I&#39;ve seen<br/>
in your replies to my post. <br/>
<br/>
Every list has its personalities, occasional posters, and lurkers. <br/>
<br/>
I am interested in responses from others as well, but I fear they are <br/>
not interested in this continuing saga, and I have put them<br/>
off. <br/>
<br/>
And so ends the Kathy show. We now return you to your regularly <br/>
scheduled programs, with the occasional weather report. <br/>

<br/>
 -=-If you or your own children have never binged, how do you know what&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
I have.  I can finish a pack of orange Milanos all by myself.  A box of <br/>
chocolate covered cherries, just me, just a few hours.  But my kids have <br/>
never had that behavior about any food.  Holly and I got boxes of candy one <br/>
day.  Mine was gone in three days; hers was mostly there in three weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s because when I was a kid candy was rare, and counted (four <br/>
kids--things were divided by four all the time).  I looked forward to being <br/>
old enough to have it when I wanted it, or looked forward to having enough <br/>
money to buy my own.  My kids don&#39;t spend money on candy; it&#39;s free at the <br/>
house to them.  With six people in the family, if we had donuts, that was two <br/>
apiece.  You never, ever, under any circumstances ever got three.  I think <br/>
that will lead to bingeing WAY more than putting two dozen donuts out and <br/>
throwing away any that get stale.<br/>
<br/>
-=-K- Why not? Is TV sacred? I don&#39;t think TV is evil. Maybe the parent <br/>
meant no violent power rangers stuff, or that they wanted<br/>
them to play instead of veg. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The parents were unsatisfied with controlling just their own kid, and wanted <br/>
to control me and my kids too!   But didn&#39;t tell me directly (because it <br/>
would have gone over like a lead balloon), and hoped I would &quot;respect their <br/>
wishes&quot; as conveyed by a kid reciting rules.  <br/>
<br/>
Their house&#39;s rules stop around the edge of their yard.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect any other family to give my kids the freedoms and regard and <br/>
privileges they have at my house.  If they go to another house with rules <br/>
about where and what and how and how much, fine!  It&#39;s not my house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-K- Maybe they aren&#39;t aware of that your rules come before theirs, or <br/>
that there&#39;s any difference. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not running a drop in daycare center.  We&#39;ve never had kids over before <br/>
that we didn&#39;t know already.<br/>

old are they. What have you told them about school<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  They&#39;re 15, 13, and 9.  They wouldn&#39;t even have to beg.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I have told my kids when they <br/>
asked how I felt about my time at school. That may have<br/>
influenced them some, for better or worse. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I told them I really loved it, but that most people don&#39;t.  They all have <br/>

<br/>
We take requests. They can go shopping if they want.   Every time my husband <br/>
or I go to the store we ask each other and kids if there&#39;s anything they <br/>
need.  Kirby usually requests shampoo or toiletries.  Holly asks for <br/>
vegetables and fruit.  Marty often says  nothing, or pizza, or avocados or <br/>
chips.  Mostly they say nothing, but there&#39;s usually food.  If Holly runs out <br/>
of Ramen she wants more.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of grazing, frequent casserole or crock pot stuff that&#39;s there <br/>
for whenever people come by, homemade bread that&#39;s for whoever wants it <br/>
whenever. Breakfast is the most likely formal deal (especially with company). <br/>
  Holly likes to help cook, but never lasts the whole course.  Very often one <br/>
person will cook for the one or two others around at the moment.   No &quot;meal <br/>
planning&quot; on a longterm basis. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266817549">O.K., this post comes with a disclaimer.  This is not ABOUT anyone in<br/>
particular.  It is curiosity and wondering why some folks feel the way they<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
We grew up poor, in the projects that were provided for the returning<br/>
military after WWII and the Korean War.  My dad was a health nut before the<br/>
term existed.  We didn&#39;t have Wonderbread, we didn&#39;t have packaged meals, tv<br/>
dinners or Coke and Pepsi.  Our snacks were homemade.  We had tons of fruits<br/>
and veggies around and never had any candy in the house.  When my mother<br/>
made cookies, they had to last because we didn&#39;t have the money to make them<br/>
everyday.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was an alcoholic.  I took care of her until she died from COPD.<br/>
She was a control freak and believed in corporal punishment.<br/>
<br/>
I never felt like I was deprived.  I didn&#39;t run out and buy whitebread when<br/>
I got married.  I didn&#39;t binge on candy or soda then or now.<br/>
<br/>
Were there other things going on that have caused folks to react this way?<br/>
Or could it be that if it wasn&#39;t the sodas or the candy, it would have been<br/>
something else.  Or could it be that even if there weren&#39;t controlling<br/>
parents, some other sort of issues would have occured in their life anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it isn&#39;t about how a child&#39;s life was controlled but how they<br/>
subconsciously choose to view themselves?  Maybe because as children they<br/>
couldn&#39;t see that it wasn&#39;t all about them but really about their parents<br/>
and their parents issues?<br/>
<br/>
Am I clear as mud as usual?<br/>

&gt; I think you have a good point.  However, if you only have a certain<br/>
&gt; amount of money, you might only be able to afford to buy a certain<br/>
&gt; amount of food.  And if you had twelve donuts and six kids, is it<br/>
&gt; fair to let some of the kids hog down four donuts a piece so that the<br/>
&gt; younger ones barely get any?<br/>
&gt; Sheila<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids don&#39;t spend money on candy; it&#39;s free at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; house to them.  With six people in the family, if we had donuts,<br/>
&gt; that was two<br/>
&gt; &gt; apiece.  You never, ever, under any circumstances ever got three.<br/>
&gt; I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; that will lead to bingeing WAY more than putting two dozen donuts<br/>
&gt; out and<br/>
&gt; &gt; throwing away any that get stale.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not the point I was trying to make.  Food was counted when I was <br/>
growing up.  My mom would count out M&Ms.  She would count out grapes.   If <br/>
one kid didn&#39;t even WANT grapes, they ate them anyway, or not, but they did <br/>
not belong to the rest of us and they weren&#39;t easily transferable.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids would look at the donuts, one would say &quot;no thanks,&quot; and if one <br/>
wanted three it would not be a capital crime.  There would be NO scarfing or <br/>
hogging down.  They just don&#39;t have that behavior in their repertoire.   If <br/>
one of us in my own childhood had said &quot;I really would love to have three,&quot; <br/>
or asked one of the other people &quot;Can I have one of yours, please?&quot; we would <br/>
have been shamed and told not to ask, that two was enough, that it wasn&#39;t <br/>
ours, and stop begging.   The donuts were more than just crummy stupid <br/>
donuts.  They had to do with reward, limitation and morality.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>

Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
What is the consequence for you when you binge?  Gain a pound or <br/>
two?  Have an upset tummy for a while?  When a person with an allergy <br/>
(non-lifethreatening allergy) binges, the consequences are <br/>
different.  And they can vary amongst alergic people too.  When I <br/>
binge, I wheeze and have to up my asthma meds.  When Rachel binges, <br/>
it doesn&#39;t kill her, she just wishes it would.  She gets killer <br/>
headaches from her allergies, along with skin problems.  <br/>
<br/>
Had I never forced her to stop eating certain foods she never would <br/>
have made the connection between the foods and the headaches because <br/>
the headaches were constant.  That&#39;s the problem with allergies to <br/>
common foods.  If you are eating it everyday, you don&#39;t see the <br/>
changes because there aren&#39;t any, you are just miserable. And the <br/>
fact that you crave what you are addicted to (thanks Doc P for that <br/>
lesson) doesn&#39;t help matters at all.<br/>
<br/>
But the flipside of the control issue and the part I think YOU of all <br/>
people should understand is that once the person has been given the <br/>
chance to learn the reactions and learn the reasons, they should be <br/>
given back the choices about their own foods intake at some point <br/>
before they are a teen.  We can&#39;t control what they eat forever so we <br/>
need to help them learn to do then let them do it for themselves.  At <br/>
least that&#39;s how we handled it here.  At this point I have three <br/>
allergic kids two of whom can eat what they want and the youngest of <br/>
whom still has to be monitored very closely and stopped from eating <br/>
things he shouldn&#39;t.  He has only just barely started to make the <br/>
connection between the foods and his problems.<br/>

Right now there&#39;s a big fruit cake we decided to go ahead and cut.  Nobody <br/>
much likes fruit cake but me, so I&#39;m planning who to give parts to, and will <br/>
wrap some up in cheesecloth and rum it down good.   (I made it for a party <br/>

related issues is colored by the fact that you can binge and nothing <br/>
happens.  If someone told you that her 9 year old child had &quot;this&quot; <br/>
specific reaction to &quot;this&quot; specific food and that he was still not <br/>
able to control it himself, would you still give it to him when he is <br/>
at your house?  Because that is what your previous post implied. <br/>
<br/>
And yes, the advice I give is always colored by the fact that I live <br/>
with food and chemical allergies everyday.  That&#39;s why my advice is <br/>
usually qualified with a statement like, &quot;This is what we have found <br/>
with our allergies, but you have to look closely at your own <br/>
situation to see if any of it really fits you.&quot;<br/>

someone else&#39;s house.   <br/>

We have a milk-allergy regular kid.  We have another kid (coming over today) <br/>
who by her own 12-yr-old choice doesn&#39;t eat white flour or sugar.  So we give <br/>
her things she can eat.  Today it&#39;s probably going to be a baked potato and <br/>
maybe tuna in lettuce leaves.  Orange juice.  <br/>
<br/>

the fact that there are many families who cling to a suspected or alleged <br/>

say not as I do&quot;. I remember my alcoholic father who smoke himself to death.<br/>
Then I remember how creative my father was also, an artists who had been<br/>
be-little by his own parents at every turn. And I remembered how my mother<br/>
encouraged us to pursue knowledge as much as possible. She perceived that<br/>
education free the spirit.<br/>

I remembered all kind of thing and decided , picked and choused the parent I<br/>

parents. They will face different circumstance. Beside , one can hope, they<br/>

&quot;Mutual Respect&quot; (hopefully)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; O.K., this post comes with a disclaimer.  This is not ABOUT anyone in<br/>
&gt; particular.  It is curiosity and wondering why some folks feel the way<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We grew up poor, in the projects that were provided for the returning<br/>
&gt; military after WWII and the Korean War.  My dad was a health nut before<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; term existed.  We didn&#39;t have Wonderbread, we didn&#39;t have packaged meals,<br/>
tv<br/>
&gt; dinners or Coke and Pepsi.  Our snacks were homemade.  We had tons of<br/>
fruits<br/>
&gt; and veggies around and never had any candy in the house.  When my mother<br/>
&gt; made cookies, they had to last because we didn&#39;t have the money to make<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; everyday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My mother was an alcoholic.  I took care of her until she died from COPD.<br/>
&gt; She was a control freak and believed in corporal punishment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never felt like I was deprived.  I didn&#39;t run out and buy whitebread<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; I got married.  I didn&#39;t binge on candy or soda then or now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Were there other things going on that have caused folks to react this way?<br/>
&gt; Or could it be that if it wasn&#39;t the sodas or the candy, it would have<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; something else.  Or could it be that even if there weren&#39;t controlling<br/>
&gt; parents, some other sort of issues would have occured in their life<br/>
anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe it isn&#39;t about how a child&#39;s life was controlled but how they<br/>
&gt; subconsciously choose to view themselves?  Maybe because as children they<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t see that it wasn&#39;t all about them but really about their parents<br/>
&gt; and their parents issues?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Am I clear as mud as usual?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think you have a good point.  However, if you only have a certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; amount of money, you might only be able to afford to buy a certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; amount of food.  And if you had twelve donuts and six kids, is it<br/>
&gt; &gt; fair to let some of the kids hog down four donuts a piece so that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; younger ones barely get any?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sheila<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My kids don&#39;t spend money on candy; it&#39;s free at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; house to them.  With six people in the family, if we had donuts,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that was two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; apiece.  You never, ever, under any circumstances ever got three.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that will lead to bingeing WAY more than putting two dozen donuts<br/>
&gt; &gt; out and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; throwing away any that get stale.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-584363140">I don&#39;t think we are on the same page here.  The occasional &quot;binge&quot; is NOT<br/>
binge eating.  In fact, they aren&#39;t even in the same ballpark.  &quot;A binge has<br/>
to be accompanied - in order to be determined a &#39;binge&#39; - with a loss of<br/>
control over eating.&quot;  People who go on the occasional &quot;binge&quot; don&#39;t loose<br/>
control, they can stop if they so choose.  They are eating because they love<br/>
the taste of whatever has grabbed there fancy at that moment.  In 99.9% of<br/>
the cases they do not eat until they become physically ill.  They are not<br/>
&quot;driven&quot; to eat every last little morsel and then go onto something else and<br/>
eat until they are too full and sick.<br/>
<br/>
The DSM-IV requires the following to define binge eating:<br/>
<br/>
*binge eating more food than most people could consume in short periods of<br/>
time<br/>
*feelings of distress about eating behaviors<br/>
*binge episodes associated with eating more rapidly than usual, eating until<br/>
uncomfortably full, eating when not hungry, eating alone because of<br/>
embarrassment about how much food is consumed, and feelings of disgust,<br/>
depression, or guilt<br/>
*binge eating that occurs, on average, at least 2 days a week for 6 months<br/>
*binge eating that isn&#39;t associated with regular purging with laxatives or<br/>
by vomiting<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s scenario doesn&#39;t not meet the definition.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; What is the consequence for you when you binge?  Gain a pound or<br/>
&gt; two?  Have an upset tummy for a while?  When a person with an allergy<br/>
&gt; (non-lifethreatening allergy) binges, the consequences are<br/>
&gt; different.  And they can vary amongst alergic people too.  When I<br/>
&gt; binge, I wheeze and have to up my asthma meds.  When Rachel binges,<br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t kill her, she just wishes it would.  She gets killer<br/>
&gt; headaches from her allergies, along with skin problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Had I never forced her to stop eating certain foods she never would<br/>
&gt; have made the connection between the foods and the headaches because<br/>
&gt; the headaches were constant.  That&#39;s the problem with allergies to<br/>
&gt; common foods.  If you are eating it everyday, you don&#39;t see the<br/>
&gt; changes because there aren&#39;t any, you are just miserable. And the<br/>
&gt; fact that you crave what you are addicted to (thanks Doc P for that<br/>
&gt; lesson) doesn&#39;t help matters at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the flipside of the control issue and the part I think YOU of all<br/>
&gt; people should understand is that once the person has been given the<br/>
&gt; chance to learn the reactions and learn the reasons, they should be<br/>
&gt; given back the choices about their own foods intake at some point<br/>
&gt; before they are a teen.  We can&#39;t control what they eat forever so we<br/>
&gt; need to help them learn to do then let them do it for themselves.  At<br/>
&gt; least that&#39;s how we handled it here.  At this point I have three<br/>
&gt; allergic kids two of whom can eat what they want and the youngest of<br/>
&gt; whom still has to be monitored very closely and stopped from eating<br/>
&gt; things he shouldn&#39;t.  He has only just barely started to make the<br/>
&gt; connection between the foods and his problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280789281">The kind if binge eating I am talking about is not bulemia, or <br/>
psychological, or about control in that sense. I am talking about <br/>
certain foods tasting so good that you don&#39;t stop even when they stop <br/>
tasting so good, even when you&#39;re full. Stopping only when the item is <br/>
gone, or when you are in alot of pain. They are brain chemical trigger <br/>
foods, not social control, or forbidden foods. I am not worried about <br/>
sneaking the food, or having anybody comment on it. It just tastes or <br/>
feels so great at first. Like it settles my brain or something. That is <br/>
the out of control eating I am talking about. Kind of like drug <br/>
addiction or alcoholism, because my brain craves certain foods <br/>
(substances) that make me sick.  <br/>
