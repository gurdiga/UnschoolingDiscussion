&gt; I thought it was.  I love that movie too.  My kids call it the<br/>
&gt; Princess<br/>
&gt; Buttercup movie or the Wesley movie.  It is very popular among many<br/>
&gt; unschoolers I know.  We had an unschooling family over in Nov. so<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; children could see it - they don&#39;t have a TV and it doesn&#39;t play at<br/>
&gt; many movie theatres any more!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Must haves on DVD? Well, I have a lot of favourite movies... not the least of <br/>
which are musicals that have been put on video, such as Cats or Jesus Christ <br/>
Superstar (I don&#39;t mean the movie, I mean the recent Really Useful video. <br/>
Actually, the movie&#39;s good too, but I find the RU vid much more to my taste). <br/>
Alfred Hitchcock films are great, esp. Rope, which is my personal favourite - <br/>
a murder mystery where the first scene is the murder, and you know the whole <br/>
way through who the killers are! <br/>
<br/>
I love &#39;psychological thrillers&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I also really like Labyrinth, for a good fantasy movie, and hey! It, too, is <br/>
musical! <br/>
<br/>
Sunset Boulevard is one of my all-time favourite movies. It&#39;s fabulous and <br/>
interesting and I would love it even if it hadn&#39;t been converted into a <br/>
musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber (I can see a definite pattern here...). But <br/>
the movie is the original, black & white version, not the ALW musical.<br/>
<br/>
Jurassic Park is another great film. The makers of it did an impressive job <br/>
of retaining what&#39;s good about the book -- namely, the plot and <br/>
&#39;technobabble&#39; -- whilst changing the characters just enough so that they&#39;re <br/>
more interesting to watch onscreen. If there&#39;s one problem with JP-the-book, <br/>
it&#39;s that the characters are unlikable and more than a little 2-dimensional. <br/>
But the plot is fantastic, and that&#39;s what makes the movie great.<br/>

Bride DVD has some cool interviews on it.<br/>
<br/>
So far we have A Knight&#39;s Tale - we play in the SCA and find that movie<br/>
to be a riot!  We have Shrek, Star Wars Episode 1, and A Land Before Time<br/>
The Big Freeze (my son saw that at Costco and *had* to have it)!  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure what else we will get.  <br/>

Side of the Moon playing instead? Very cool. You start the music when the <br/>
lion roars for the third time at the beginning of the movie. All sorts of <br/>
very cool things match up between movie and music. I imagine some very <br/>
stoned individuals must have first discovered this.<br/>

us, I bet!!!<br/>
<br/>
THANK GOODNESS they weren&#39;t doing it to movies back then and thank goodness <br/>
for Franco Zeffirelli&#39;s Romeo and Juliet because b&#39;zillions of 1960&#39;s <br/>
teenagers discovered they LOVED Shakespeare in spite of being tortured with <br/>
it in school. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve watched Zeffirelli&#39;s Romeo and Juliet, the gangland version with Claire <br/>
Dane and Leonardo DeCaprio, and West Side Story. Can anybody think of other <br/>
Romeo and Juliet-based movies?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535066024">I thought there was a Lawrence Olivier Romeo and Juliet, but I must have been <br/>
thinking of Hamlet.<br/>
<br/>
When I was looking I found this, though:  Romeo and Juliet (1968/I) (voice) <br/>
(uncredited)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what voice he is.  Maybe there&#39;s a narrator?  Maybe they <br/>
replaced a voice?  <br/>
<br/>
We havd a video of a Canadian stage-play style production, if you want to <br/>
borrow it.  It&#39;s a CBC video.  <br/>
