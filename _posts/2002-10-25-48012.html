 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see how you could box train them, at least I&#39;ve never heard of it<br/>
being done. Our most-socialized rat generally doesn&#39;t pee or poop on<br/>
people, and if we&#39;re holding her we can tell when she needs to go and put<br/>
her back then. The rest of them are more iffy...<br/>
<br/>
We have 5 rats now, and the cages get cleaned weekly. If you stand next<br/>
to the cages near the end of the week, you can smell them, but otherwise<br/>
they&#39;re not bad. Boys, again, seem worse than girls. <br/>
<br/>
When we clean the  cages, we actually scrub them out with baking soda,<br/>
every week. We use Carefresh bedding - made from recycled newspapers, no<br/>
cedar or pine. Our cage is mesh, not a  tank, so air can circulate<br/>
through. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recall hamster smell, but mice certainly smell more than rats,<br/>
IME, especially considering the size difference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mice and hamsters are very stinky! They don&#39;t mind where they go at all. Rats <br/>
OTOH, pick a corner or two. They don&#39;t go where their food is or where they <br/>
sleep. They clean their nest area daily. When we had rats (my Canterbury, a <br/>
beautiful blue girl died a few years back and I haven&#39;t been able to get <br/>
another yet.) We didn&#39;t use cedar or pine chips, there is a problem with the <br/>
wood and respiratory problems in rats. If they got slightly stinky, it was <br/>
more our fault than theirs, the boys were slightly more smelly, but a bath <br/>
would cure that. And they do like a nice bath. I&#39;ve never seen a hamster <br/>
enjoy a bath. I don&#39;t even know if you can give a hamster a bath. <br/>

<br/>
I have no idea -- I have owned hundreds of rats over the past 23 <br/>
years and have yet to be bitten by one I&#39;m holding (excepting the <br/>
tiny little &quot;tasting&quot; behaviors that baby rats will do like any baby <br/>
animal -- never hard enough to sting, and simply blowing in their <br/>
faces taught them to stop).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All rodents, especially males, will be stinky if their cages aren&#39;t <br/>
cleaned often enough. *Some* rats can be taught not to poop <br/>
while you&#39;re holding them, but for the most part they poop <br/>
wherever they are, like guinea pigs or hamsters or mice (or <br/>
horses... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Okay this is a really stupid question but how exactly do you train a rat not <br/>
to poop on you?? I always wanted a guinea pig but always got peed on by <br/>
them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Positive reinforcement. If the rat likes being held, hold him as <br/>
long as he doesn&#39;t poop. Give him treats, like letting him lick bits <br/>
of peanut butter off a spoon, as long as he&#39;s not pooping. Stretch <br/>
out and vary the reward as you go on.<br/>
<br/>
Negative reinforcement: If the rat likes being held, if he poops he <br/>
goes back in his cage. If he *doesn&#39;t* like being held, he <br/>
continues to be held until he&#39;s stopped pooping, then he goes <br/>
back in his cage.<br/>
<br/>
In real rat-training life, though, the calmer rats don&#39;t have as <br/>
much urge to poop (true of any of us &lt;g&gt;) in stress, so the more <br/>
you handle the rat or guinea pig or whatever, the less they will <br/>
probably poop on you.<br/>
