<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662994849">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I found your group through a friend and think I am going to like it<br/>
very much.  A little bit about our family.  My husband and I will have<br/>
been married 20 years in November.  He was in the military when we<br/>
married, spent 20 years there and now works for the American Red Cross.<br/>
<br/>
We have two sons, Josh who is 18, and Ethan who is 13.<br/>
<br/>
I always knew I wanted to homeschool.  When Josh was five, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
wait to drag out my favorite Tip and Mitten reader.  We&#39;d sit on the<br/>
couch every day, and I&#39;d read to him, and try to teach him the sound<br/>
of each letter, and help him put it all together.  But each reading<br/>
session would end with him in tears.  I decided he was too young, and<br/>
put it off until the next year.<br/>
<br/>
When he was six, we tried again.  Once again, each session ended in<br/>
tears.  I wondered, what am I doing wrong?  I decided to just let it<br/>
go.  By the time he was about eight, he finally caught on to what I<br/>
had been trying to show him before, and we were off.<br/>
<br/>
We started out using the Abeka curriculum, but I soon learned that I<br/>
hated it.  If it was boring me, I was sure it was boring him.  We<br/>
continued with &quot;traditional&quot; homeschooling until he was eleven.  One<br/>
day we were sitting at the table struggling with 5th grade math, and I<br/>
just couldn&#39;t understand why he couldn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.  I got angry and<br/>
yelled at him, &quot;You are going to school next year, and that&#39;s that!&quot; <br/>
I was convinced it was his laziness, coupled with my obviously<br/>
ineffective teaching technique that was the problem.<br/>
<br/>
We enrolled him in a local Christian school.  They said their<br/>
curriculum was a year ahead of the local public schools.  So even<br/>
though he had been doing 5th grade work, they put him back in 4th<br/>
grade.  So here he was, and almost 12 year old in 4th grade.  That was<br/>
bad enough, but the worse part was, he wasn&#39;t getting any better in<br/>
math.  That first year was so hard on his self-esteem, I&#39;m so sorry I<br/>
made him go through that.  By that time, we&#39;d had Ethan, and it only<br/>
made sense for Ethan to go to school too, that way I could have them<br/>
both in school and I could finish my college degree.  He went to<br/>
Kindergarten every day and came home crying because he missed me so<br/>
much.  <br/>
<br/>
We spent five years of our life at that school.  And I now regret each<br/>
day that we wasted there.  By the end of the last year, we were all<br/>
worn out from school, going to bed early, getting up early, and all<br/>
that horrendous homework!  Their curriculum was demanding to begin<br/>
with, and then there was so much homework.  We spent the whole evening<br/>
doing it, and I really felt like we were homeschooling again because<br/>
they weren&#39;t understanding everything they learned during the day and<br/>
I&#39;d have to go over it with them again at night.  I might as well have<br/>
saved myself the money and just homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
When we left, Josh had just finished 8th grade, and barely passed<br/>
pre-alegra with a D.  The only way he passed was that they allowed the<br/>
students to correct their homework papers and turn them in again for a<br/>
better grade.  We struggled and struggled with math, and I finally saw<br/>
that it wasn&#39;t his laziness or my ineffectual teaching.  He just<br/>
WASN&#39;T GOOD AT MATH!  Horror of horrors, was his life ruined forever?  <br/>
<br/>
Well, my son was 16 years old, almost 17 and just completed 8th grade.<br/>
  If it took him four more years to complete high school, he&#39;d be<br/>
almost 21 when he finished.  So I thought about it.  What are they<br/>
going to teach him in high school that he really needs?  When we quit<br/>
the school and went back home, I told them they didn&#39;t have to study<br/>
anything they didn&#39;t want to.  That whole first year we did pretty<br/>
much nothing that looked academic.<br/>
<br/>
The second year, Ethan said that he thought he&#39;d like to start doing<br/>
some actual school work again.  We signed up with an online school,<br/>
Goddess Mooncircle Academy, and took just reading, spelling and math.<br/>
 We finished those books before the first semester was over, so I told<br/>
him he could go on to 7th grade work.  By that time, he was twelve,<br/>
and I guess starting to feel like an almost-teenager, starting to feel<br/>
a little more laid back.<br/>
<br/>
So, the bottom line is, Josh skipped everything that you could<br/>
consider to be &quot;high school.&quot;  He&#39;s 18 now.  He&#39;s been out looking for<br/>
a full time job, hasn&#39;t found one yet but we put in applications every<br/>
day.  When he fills out the portion of the job application that says<br/>
&quot;high school&quot; I guiltily put that he &quot;graduated&quot; in May 2003.  I feel<br/>
that he is going to learn so much more at a job than in school.  He<br/>
chats with a lot of kids online and likes to brag that he doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to &quot;finish&quot; school.  <br/>
<br/>
We saw some ads for PCDI on television, that&#39;s Professional Career<br/>
Development Institute.  Josh decided he wanted to take their Computer<br/>
Repair course, so we ordered it for him.  He&#39;s completed the first<br/>
three chapters and tests.  He studies on it when he wants to.  After<br/>
he completes a chapter and test, I go through and check it.  If there<br/>
are any errors, I correct them and we send the test in.  Then we<br/>
review the parts he missed.  But mostly he studies on his own.  I just<br/>
quiz him when necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Ethan is only 13, but was very excited about getting to study whatever<br/>
he wanted, so we ordered the career photography course for him.  He<br/>
was initially excited about it, but I think he underestimated just how<br/>
much reading and book learning there would be to it because it&#39;s hard<br/>
to get him to sit down and study it.  I think he thought it would be<br/>
all taking pictures and no book studying.  Anyway, I try to remind him<br/>
that I didn&#39;t make him choose this course, in fact he didn&#39;t have to<br/>
choose anything.  But he DID choose this, and we are paying $28 a<br/>
month for two years so he can take the course.  I am kind of caught<br/>
between realizing that he needs to be free to study or not study as he<br/>
chooses, and realizing that we are paying over $500 for this course<br/>
because he said he wanted it, and am tempted to &quot;make&quot; him sit down<br/>
and study.  Any suggestions from anyone on this?<br/>
<br/>
I am going to be so happy when Josh finally does get a job, I&#39;ll write<br/>
a book called, &quot;Ditch School and Get a Job&quot; or something.  I want to<br/>
write a success story about him, about how school made him feel like<br/>
he didn&#39;t measure up, but how he skipped high school and became<br/>
successful all on his own.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, didn&#39;t mean to go on so long.  I&#39;ll enjoy getting to know you all.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Judie!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one way of looking at it: You&#39;re probably about 3 times as old as he<br/>
is, so a 2 year commitment to him is like a 6 year commitment to you. What<br/>
if you signed up for something you realized you didn&#39;t like after a couple<br/>
of months? How would you feel if your husband insisted you stick with it for<br/>
the next 6 years because you signed up for it?<br/>
<br/>
If you make him study this for 2 years a very likely outcome is that he&#39;ll<br/>
hate photography. Is that worth $500?<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;d find some way to drop it and get out of any contract you signed.)<br/>
<br/>
Childhood should be about exploring the world. Which means being free to<br/>
dabble in things and try them out. If he feels that trying something means<br/>
he&#39;s stuck with it, then he&#39;ll stop trying thing out.<br/>

<br/>
If you make him finish everything he starts, or make him finish everything <br/>
you pay for, that will teach him two things:  not to start anything, and to <br/>
refuse your financial assistance, because of the usury rates.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who, in trying to implement unschooling, told her 12 year old <br/>
son that he could read any book in the world he wanted to, as long as he <br/>
finished every book he started.   Huh.  He quit starting books in no time!<br/>
<br/>
What if you bought a dozen donuts for him and he didn&#39;t want to finish them?  <br/>
 Better for finance AND health to give the extras away or even throw them <br/>
away rather than run them through his digestive tract just because they cost <br/>
money.  The money was already gone.<br/>
<br/>
If you bought him something he turned out to be allergic to, would you force <br/>
him to finish eating it?<br/>
<br/>
What if he&#39;s allergic to a course of study?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d go for happiness and peace over getting your money&#39;s worth of unhappiness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182843732"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Real life, kids don&#39;t make contracts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of kids sign contracts.  Emancipated minors have the right to <br/>
sign contracts.  More kids would seek emancipated minor status if <br/>
they knew they could make their own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, but I just don&#39;t understand what is wrong with letting <br/>
kids be responsible for their own actions.   If I signed a contract <br/>
specifying that I promised to do something, I would do it, because I <br/>
believe it is unethical to not fulfill a contractual agreement that I <br/>
freely entered into.   Now what is a child learning when he is <br/>
allowed to make a choice but not allowed to experience the <br/>
consequences of that choice?<br/>
<br/>
If your child asks you if he can paint a picture, and you say yes, <br/>
but specify that he has to clean up the mess when he is done, are you <br/>
going to then clean up the mess for him because when it&#39;s time to do <br/>
the actual work of clean up, he wines about having to do his part, <br/>
which was stated beforehand?  Or would you say yes to his <br/>
request to paint without making him responsible in any way for the <br/>
clean-up?  When you and your child make this agreement about the <br/>
paint, that is a contract.  Your child gets the privilege of painting <br/>
in return for fulfilling his responsibility to clean up.  We involve <br/>
our children in contracts all the time, we just don&#39;t make them sign <br/>
on the dotted line.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63125859">Well, I&#39;m sitting here thinking how I&#39;ve tried to do the absolute <br/>
very best by my kids by unschooling them, and letting them make their <br/>
own choices about what they want to study.  So when my son said he <br/>
wanted this, I had no reason to not believe him.  No reason to think <br/>
that he wouldn&#39;t complete the work, because in the past when he has <br/>
asked to do something, he&#39;s always completed it.  He&#39;s always been <br/>
very responsible, so no reason to think he wouldn&#39;t be again.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting here thinking, how could I ever have known that this <br/>
wasn&#39;t the right choice for him, when he told me it&#39;s what he wanted? <br/>
<br/>
We tried other avenues to find the information, most of the books <br/>
didn&#39;t go into the detail that we wanted.   This seemed the only way <br/>
to get the information.  <br/>
<br/>
And no, I have not ever left a job early, gotten a divorce, or<br/>
left an apartment without giving two months notice and cleaning it to <br/>
full-depost perfection.  I have never broken up with a boyfriend or <br/>
accidently stood someone up that I am aware of.   I believe in <br/>
fulfilling my responsibilities, and I believe there is always a way <br/>
to do the right thing.  <br/>
<br/>
So I guess the &quot;right thing&quot; is for me to just suck it up and pay the <br/>
money, but for my son to not have to do anything.  Wish I could get <br/>
the people in MY life to let me get away with that.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, guess I&#39;m just having a crappy failure of a day.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m hoping I would never commit to anything MAJOR that I wasn&#39;t planning to <br/>
follow through with. Same for my boys. But learning discernment is <br/>
important---knowing WHEN to commit and when to quit. I don&#39;t have NEARLY was many things <br/>
that I quit NOW as I did when I was younger; I can discern better what I can do <br/>
and what I want to do.<br/>
<br/>
But FORCING a commitment does not make someone more willing to do the work. <br/>
It makes him bitter and resentful that he HAS to. And probably less likely to <br/>
do a good job. School teaches people to do just enough to get by---especially <br/>
if you hate it, because you CAN&#39;T get out of it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the &quot;real life situation&quot;, I&#39;ve never heard of a job that required <br/>
a two year commitment for a job that you couldn&#39;t get out of if you were truly <br/>
unhappy. Anyone else? I&#39;m picking my brain to think of a job where you&#39;re <br/>
stuck. OH! the military! But you could still get a dishonorable discharge and get <br/>
out early! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Real life is making those hard decisions ON YOUR OWN (or with a little help <br/>
form loved ones). It is NOT doing it anyway because someone else makes you.<br/>

<br/>
This situation falls under &quot;natural consequenses&quot;.  Your son would be aware<br/>
of the consequenses of breaking the contract and would have to decide for<br/>
himself which is worse, living out his contract that is making him<br/>
miserable, or facing the consequenses of breaking that contract.  Hopefully<br/>
he will have enough integrity not to leave someone else stranded, but his<br/>
first obligation in life is to himself.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I  have broken a three-year contract with a health club that I<br/>
joined.   It had on-site child care and so I brought my kids for only 1<br/>
hour.  I brought them snacks and I checked on them often.  Good thing I did,<br/>
because I saw the day care woman really didn&#39;t like being there and she did<br/>
not interact with the kids at all.  I&#39;m guessing that she was only doing it<br/>
for a reduced rate on her membership.  My kids sat off in a corner eating<br/>
their snacks and the other kids took turns staring at my kids snacks and<br/>
playing with a small sample of toys.  None of the kids enjoyed being there.<br/>
It was like baby prison.  I did tour the room before I signed the contract,<br/>
but it was something that you really didn&#39;t notice right off.  You had to<br/>
see it a couple of times to really understand that it was going on.  I<br/>
decided that bringing my kids there was not worth keeping my good credit, so<br/>
I quit going and quit paying. My consequenses was that it was a negative on<br/>
my credit.  I could live with that.  I couldn&#39;t live with my kids being in<br/>
baby prison.  The woman hated her commitment to the day care, but she did<br/>
it.  Everyone would have been better off if she just quit.  Sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
good to quit.<br/>

can&#39;t just quit, because he signed a contract to work for that <br/>
person.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why children are not allowed to sign contracts.  The courts don&#39;t <br/>
consider them to be competent to make long-term agreements.  And it&#39;s not fair to <br/>
stick parents with decisions made by those too young to understand.<br/>
<br/>
So if a parent is the one sticking a kid to a &quot;contract,&quot; that&#39;s bad.<br/>
<br/>
And contracts can and are broken all the time.  There are penalties for <br/>
breaking them, but to say &quot;can&#39;t just quit&quot; isn&#39;t true.  Sometimes the penalty is <br/>
financial, and part of the contract from the beginning.   Sometimes it&#39;s just <br/>
personal integrity penalty--not good on a resume.   <br/>
<br/>
If you lease a house you don&#39;t have to physically live in the house, you have <br/>
to keep making payments and be responsible for the upkeep/maintenance <br/>
(whatever the contract stipulated).   So if someone leased a two year set of <br/>
instruction, they don&#39;t have to LIVE there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This kind of speaks to a real life situation.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Real life, kids don&#39;t make contracts.<br/>

&lt;&lt; As far as the &quot;real life situation&quot;, I&#39;ve never heard of a job that <br/>
required <br/>
a two year commitment for a job that you couldn&#39;t get out of if you were <br/>
truly <br/>
unhappy. Anyone else? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Teachers sign one-year contracts.  But they can be broken if you&#39;re through <br/>
being hired as a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Often people make a less formal agreement to keep a job for two or three <br/>
years if they accept a position.  Then it&#39;s their word as their bond.  For some <br/>
people that&#39;s stronger than other people&#39;s contracts.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has agreed to teach the beginning karate class on Tuesdays.  It&#39;s part <br/>
of his training and part of his duty to his sensei and the dojo as a group.   <br/>
He doesn&#39;t take that lightly.  If he did, they would say &quot;that&#39;s okay,&quot; and <br/>
get someone else to do it.  But it wouldn&#39;t be entirely &quot;okay.&quot;  It would make <br/>
Kirby less valuable and less valued.<br/>
<br/>
But taking a distance course where there is no responsibility to others who <br/>
are waiting isn&#39;t the same level or purpose of commitment.<br/>
<br/>
Being in a play or a music group is a BIG commitment.  Kids make those <br/>
commitments, but they usually start small and build up to major commitments only <br/>
after they know their own limits and interests, and the others know them fairly <br/>
well too, who &quot;contract&quot; with them usually informally.<br/>
<br/>
Being on a sports team is less crucial than having a major vocal part in a <br/>
production, but is similar.  <br/>
<br/>
Accepting a scholarship (for any reason) creates a contractual commitment.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that commitments aren&#39;t real, but it&#39;s that practicing doesn&#39;t help <br/>
the reality.  There isn&#39;t &quot;pretend&quot; commitment.<br/>
<br/>
The argument that people need to wake up early as kids so they can wake up on <br/>
time for jobs when they&#39;re older doesn&#39;t make sense, and neither does <br/>
practicing for two-year contracts.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Lots of kids sign contracts.  Emancipated minors have the right to <br/>
sign contracts.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Emancipated minor&quot; means &quot;no longer legally a kid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m sorry, but I just don&#39;t understand what is wrong with letting <br/>
kids be responsible for their own actions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the question was about letting them be responsible.<br/>
It was about MAKING them &quot;be responsible,&quot; which can&#39;t really be done.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I signed a contract <br/>
specifying that I promised to do something, I would do it, because I <br/>
believe it is unethical to not fulfill a contractual agreement that I <br/>
freely entered into. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How old are you?<br/>
Have you ever left a job early, gotten a divorce, left an apartment without <br/>
giving two months notice and cleaning it to full-deposit perfection?  Have you <br/>
ever broken up with a boyfriend?  Accidently stood someone up?  <br/>
<br/>
Ethics are internal.  They can&#39;t be imposed or inserted.<br/>
Children develop ethics, and doing something to them that they feel is unfair <br/>
or painful or unreasonable is NOT the short path to ethical awareness.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Now what is a child learning when he is <br/>
allowed to make a choice but not allowed to experience the <br/>
consequences of that choice?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he didn&#39;t freely and fully understand his choices, he was cheated.<br/>
Little kids would agree to all KINDS of things they&#39;re incapable of <br/>
comprehending.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Or would you say yes to his <br/>
request to paint without making him responsible in any way for the <br/>
clean-up? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THAT is what I would do if I wanted him to love painting, and wanted him to <br/>
experience learning.<br/>
<br/>
If a child can&#39;t paint until he&#39;s capable of entirely cleaning up all the <br/>
mess and supplies, children just won&#39;t paint.  Nor wt the <br/>
paint, that is a contract. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I rarely make such contracts with my children.  We clean things up together <br/>
because we like to do things together.  We&#39;re partners, not adversaries.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Your child gets the privilege of painting <br/>
in return for fulfilling his responsibility to clean up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My child has the right to paint.<br/>
I have the duty to maintain his rights.<br/>
I will take care of the paints and provide table space and paper.  The mess <br/>
will stay or not; sometimes they clean up, sometimes we both do, sometimes we <br/>
ALL do, sometimes I do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We involve our children in contracts all the time, we just don&#39;t make them <br/>
sign <br/>
on the dotted line.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby called me Friday afternoon from the gaming shop because he was leaving <br/>
there to go to someone&#39;s house for a roll-playing game he expected to last <br/>
until after midnight.  It was a house he had never been to.  He offered to call <br/>
after he got there and give me address and phone, but I said if he wasn&#39;t <br/>
worried and he knew he had a ride home, he didn&#39;t need to call.   He&#39;s seventeen.  <br/>
He called because I would have assumed he would be at the gaming shop, and he <br/>
knew I would be worried if I needed him and couldn&#39;t find him.  It was a <br/>
courtesy and a consideration.  I appreciated it.   <br/>
<br/>
He got home around 1:00 a.m. and came in quietly and all was peaceful and <br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not living by contracts.  We&#39;re living by love and courtesy, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Ben Lovejoy gave a presentation at the Live & Learn Conference about living <br/>
by principles instead of rules.  I think that&#39;s the difference.  I would not <br/>
commit any of my children to a two-year obligation, but in the case of a <br/>
long-term obligation, the principle by which we would decide how to proceed would be <br/>
that our children&#39;s safety and happiness and learning outweigh other factors.<br/>
<br/>
Holly went to an acting/modelling school on a one-year contract.  Ultimately, <br/>
she took more classes than we had paid for, because they liked her and she <br/>
was inspirational to other kids (and the teachers).  But halfway through, she <br/>
went through a period of not wanting to go at all.  She finished the eight-week <br/>
courses she was in, and didn&#39;t sign on for more.  Keith was sad about the loss <br/>
of funds, but he bucked up and decided her being content and feeling safe was <br/>
more important.  And in a while, she went back and had a BIG flurry of <br/>
activity there.  <br/>
<br/>
I just never treat my children like contract-breaking employees, and it has <br/>
worked well for us.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I took up book binding a while ago, maybe a year and a half ago.  It brought <br/>
me great happiness.  This involved some considerable cost in the process, <br/>
because I really loved choosing handmade papers, wanted a hand drill, had to get <br/>
the string and the right glue and all sorts of fun tools to do it.  I made a <br/>
bunch of little books and then didn&#39;t do any more.  I think I move on to <br/>
decoupage for a while, but what I wanted to do with that - make little treasure boxed <br/>
out of torn children&#39;s books - was too tedious to hold my attention and the <br/>
glue bothered my lungs.  I spent time and energy collecting colored on and <br/>
ripped children&#39;s books from garage sales, collected shoe boxed and such.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, I also tried knitting when I broke my ankle.  Got lots of fun <br/>
yarn.  I really like yarn.  I really don&#39;t like knitting.  It was really just a <br/>
prelude to weaving anyway.  Now I&#39;m weaving - spent a whole ton of money on a <br/>
used loom, buy yarn and work to my heart&#39;s content on it.  It also brings me <br/>
great happiness.  I&#39;ve made three baby blankets now and am going to do two or <br/>
three more before moving on to rag rugs.  I&#39;ve been saving rags and old clothes <br/>
for years in anticipation <br/>
<br/>
These are just the last two years, maybe, of my endeavors.  Before that it <br/>
was canning (which I still do), picking (which I don&#39;t do anymore, but was <br/>
prolific at for a while), needlepoint, cross-stitch, bike riding, braided rag rugs, <br/>
watercolor painting, etc.  My husband may roll his eyes at my whims and <br/>
interests, but he loves my enthusiasm and my need to be creative.  (&quot;This one is <br/>
going to change my live, dear!)  He&#39;s never held me to doing something I grew <br/>
tired of.  He&#39;s never forced me to complete a project because I spent good money <br/>
on it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned a lot in my time with these courses of study.  Even if I didn&#39;t <br/>
stay with it.  I&#39;m happy to have done everything I&#39;ve tried.  Most of all I&#39;ve <br/>
learned to follow my passion.  Weaving may be it.  Or maybe pottery will be <br/>
next, who knows?<br/>
<br/>
How would you feel if your husband was the one who was interested in <br/>
photography (mine was) and took a course or spent thousands of dollars (speaking from <br/>
experience) on equipment?  Would you force him to take pictures even if he was <br/>
no longer interested?  <br/>
<br/>
Contract or no, you can&#39;t really force a creative impulse that doesn&#39;t exist <br/>
or has withered away.  My son is five now, loves his violin, but hates <br/>
lessons.  We stopped the lessons at his three year old request and will start them <br/>
again when he thinks he wants them.  Yes, we were out some money, but he learned <br/>
that we trust him to learn what he wants to learn at his own pace.  <br/>
<br/>
Just some of my long winded thoughts.  Now you know much more about me than <br/>
you ever wanted to!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       The key here is &quot;freely entered into&#39;.  Children sometimes lack the <br/>
experience and knowledge involved in that part.  That&#39;s the parent&#39;s job to find <br/>
out so the child can truly choose.  You said that he was unaware that there <br/>
was going to be so much book learning involved?  Doesn&#39;t that make it a null <br/>
and void contract?<br/>
<br/>
       It does to me, and he did learn consequences, that the course was not <br/>
for him and he cannot learn photography that way.  He learned about himself <br/>
and what he wants and will learn photography another way. He learned that he <br/>
needs to have a clearer idea of what something entails BEFORE he chooses to <br/>
commit himself.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       If you really wanted him to learn about contracts and consequences, <br/>
this is a great experience!  If you get involved and make choices for him, it&#39;ll <br/>
undo what he&#39;s learning.  How does that help him?  If you really want him to <br/>
understand commitment and contracts when he is an adult, why would you <br/>
interfere with that learning process at this time, when the lesson is here for him to <br/>
learn? <br/>
<br/>
       You seem to want to literally &quot;teach him a lesson&quot;. He&#39;s learning it <br/>
already, just get out of the way.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; We tried other avenues to find the information, most of the books <br/>

&gt; to get the information.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       Look at it this way, you&#39;ve paid for the info, he has it, so that&#39;s a <br/>
success, you found the info he wanted.  <br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;m actually looking for a science/chemistry/biology curriculum, or <br/>
textbook, anything, because that seems to be the only way I can find the info I <br/>
need to find for Alex.  But buying that is not going to mean that he has to <br/>
use the whole thing, it&#39;s just the way they put it together, and I have to *buy* <br/>
the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
         Hoping I can buy just those subjects, not going to buy a whole <br/>
year&#39;s worth of curriculum for that.  Just because I buy a curriculum, tho, doesnt&#39; <br/>
mean I&#39;m going to expect worksheets and tests, much less handed in on time, <br/>
I&#39;m just gonna say, hey this looks like it&#39;s got some of that stuff you wanted <br/>
to know.  <br/>
<br/>
       He just won&#39;t use all of it, or the way it was designed to be used, or <br/>
he&#39;ll paste his walls with the cool pictures, or whatever.  I don&#39;t care, I <br/>
only care that he had an interest, I respected that and did the best I could on <br/>
getting him what he needed.  The rest is up to him. <br/>
<br/>
       Maybe look at this the same way?  You did your best getting him what <br/>
he needed, and he just didn&#39;t need the whole, just parts.  Or that it&#39;ll take <br/>
longer than two years, or less, or whatever.  Maybe there *was* no other way to <br/>
get that info than what you did.  And I&#39;ll join you in complaining that that <br/>
sucks!  But that&#39;s the way some things are still, until there&#39;s more <br/>
unschoolers and eclectic homeschoolers wanting to pick and choose, then the market will <br/>
respond to that.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So I guess the &quot;right thing&quot; is for me to just suck it up and pay the <br/>
money, but for my son to not have to do anything. Wish I could get <br/>
the people in MY life to let me get away with that. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, guess I&#39;m just having a crappy failure of a day.<br/>
<br/>
Judie&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a headache, and ants have invaded because my hubby and son don&#39;t walk <br/>
the garbage to the kitchen they play hoops with the living room garbage can <br/>
instead ( and obviously miss a lot!), and I have to go visit at a relatives <br/>
house I can&#39;t stand, in the rain, which I hate to drive in, and there&#39;s <br/>
construction there, which I also hate to drive in.  <br/>
<br/>
Ack!  <br/>
I feel your pain!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to go and help my niece celebrate her birthday, tho, so it&#39;s not a <br/>
total loss. <br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re watching the ants trail in and out and trying to find out where <br/>
they came in on the THIRD FLOOR.  I wish I could see them going up the outside of <br/>
the bldg, lol.  <br/>
<br/>
Just try to look on the bright side of life.  Some days it&#39;s harder to see <br/>
than others.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sorry, but I just don&#39;t understand what is wrong with letting<br/>
&gt; kids be responsible for their own actions.   If I signed a contract<br/>
&gt; specifying that I promised to do something, I would do it, because I<br/>
&gt; believe it is unethical to not fulfill a contractual agreement that I<br/>
&gt; freely entered into.   Now what is a child learning when he is<br/>
&gt; allowed to make a choice but not allowed to experience the<br/>
&gt; consequences of that choice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it would help to not bring the contract into the thought problem. It<br/>
makes it confusing if both ethical &quot;obligations&quot; and legal obligations are<br/>
mixed together.<br/>
<br/>
A contract is a legally binding document. If an adult goes back on the<br/>
agreement the adult can have some legal action taken against them. Though<br/>
adults may feel ethically bound to a contract, the real issue is that<br/>
they&#39;re legally bound. A child isn&#39;t legally bound until they&#39;re 18 (or 16<br/>
maybe or it may depend on the state).<br/>
<br/>
Outside of legal obligations are obligations we *choose* to accept. The<br/>
obligations aren&#39;t forced on us as in a contract we&#39;ve signed. We *decide*<br/>
to adhere to the obligations because it suits our internal sense of<br/>
rightness to do so.<br/>
<br/>
If someone makes us stick to an obligation then it isn&#39;t a moral choice.<br/>
It&#39;s something that&#39;s being forced on us.<br/>
<br/>
As adults we get to choose. If you promised to do something you&#39;d *choose*<br/>
to follow through. Which means that you *could* choose not to follow through<br/>
but you are *freely* choosing to make the sacrifice to follow through.<br/>
<br/>
*Lots* of people equate not wanting the alternative chocies with not having<br/>
a choice. They aren&#39;t the same at all and it muddles thinking to mix the two<br/>
together. Choosing to stay home when the door is unlocked because you prefer<br/>
to stay home is not the same as staying home because you can&#39;t get out.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is forced to follow through then their free choice is taken away.<br/>
They *aren&#39;t* honoring an obligation but doing what they&#39;re told. What&#39;s<br/>
being modeled isn&#39;t that promises are sacred but that bigger people can make<br/>
littler people do what the bigger people want them to do.<br/>
<br/>
Your son isn&#39;t old enough to understand what the course involved. Even if<br/>
you&#39;d read exactly what it was to him and explained it up and down, he just<br/>
doesn&#39;t have the life experience to understand how that translates into what<br/>
he&#39;s going to have to do and what he&#39;s going to feel compared to what he&#39;s<br/>
going to get out of it.<br/>
<br/>
He *will* honor his obligations when he&#39;s older because he&#39;ll be free to<br/>
choose and he&#39;ll know the consequences. The consequences will be personal to<br/>
him: it will be his money or his friends he&#39;s letting down or his reputation<br/>
he&#39;s putting on the line. All that will make sense to him when he&#39;s older.<br/>
Right now the consequences are all pretend and virtual. He can&#39;t feel what<br/>
an earned $500 feels like because he isn&#39;t an adult. That understanding will<br/>
come when he&#39;s earning his own money and having to make decisions about<br/>
where it can and should be spent.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you could try looking at it a little differently.  Think of leaving the <br/>
class as doing the right thing for him.  Instead of wasting his time in a <br/>
class that he isn&#39;t interested in.  A class that just might crush a love of <br/>
photography (I think that was the class ; ))  He had the strength of character to <br/>
decide that it wasn&#39;t for him, and to do something about it.  He could have sat <br/>
there class after class looking out the window, not listening or absorbing <br/>
anything.  Wondering what was going on outside those walls.  That would have <br/>
been an easy thing to do in some circumstances.  Easier, maybe, than standing up <br/>
and saying &quot;I know you paid a lot for this class but.....&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And in the future when he is at a job that he hates he will remember that he <br/>
has a choice.  He can leave and find the &quot;right&quot; path for him.  He will <br/>
remember that his Mom said he did the right thing by leaving a boring class and that <br/>
he did have a choice.  He could follow his passions.  <br/>
Just another thought.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve learned a lot in my time with these courses of study.  Even if I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stay with it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, every time we go through the decision to quit we learn more about<br/>
ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Sticking with something isn&#39;t that hard to learn. You just grit your teeth<br/>
and push on.<br/>
<br/>
But learning to assess whether a situation will return more to us than it<br/>
will take from us if we continue is a very useful lesson to learn. In fact<br/>
decision making was a course in engineering college. Personally I think it<br/>
was too little too late. We were all trained by school that to start<br/>
something was to stick with it. (We didn&#39;t have a choice!) And, as a side<br/>
lesson, that sometimes it&#39;s best not to take chances because you might get<br/>
stuck with something you don&#39;t want. :-/<br/>
<br/>
Life should be a joyful exploration not a burden of obligation to finish<br/>
what we begin.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think lots of people don&#39;t want to give what others denied them. It&#39;s sort<br/>
of a payback. To watch someone else suffer because others made us suffer.<br/>
There&#39;s a satisfaction in having the power to treat others as poorly as we<br/>
were treated.<br/>
<br/>
But would you have wanted your parents (or husband) to treat you that way?<br/>
Would you have wanted them to deny you happiness, or to increase your<br/>
unhappiness simply because their parents made them miserable and they didn&#39;t<br/>
want you to be happier than they were ever allowed to be?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra often says something about looking back at how our parents handled a<br/>
situation and then doing it the way we would have wanted our parents to<br/>
treat us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wish I could get <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The less you expect it of others and the more you are willing to shoulder<br/>
the burden joyfully yourself, the more likely people are to help.<br/>
