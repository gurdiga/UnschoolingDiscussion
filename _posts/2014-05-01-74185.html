<div id="ygrps-yiv-612347070">My 7 year old son plays video games on the computer, iPad, and xbox360 system. He loves Spongebob Squarepants, and the Spongebob games. He’s beat all of them, and now plays for more points, secret rooms, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after he got the xbox360 he started creating his own games in his mind, and acting them out for my husband and I. He will tell us in depth about all of the levels, including boss levels, (his favorite). He is super creative, and loves to draw and make his own comic books. I asked him if he’d like to try to draw the game in Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. I am expert in both, and he has learned much of the basics in both programs by watching me and asking questions. It would be like a storyboard that he can post on his blog. He showed some enthusiasm for that, but then today I said I’d love it if we can make an actual game. He got very excited, and wants to make a 3-D Spongebob game for xbox. I told him we will have to start small and learn how to do it. <br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have any experience with video game creation with young kids?<br/>
Any programs you can recommend?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864674865">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My 14 year old is the programming guru in the house. He suggested <br/>
Scratch (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/)">http://scratch.mit.edu/)</a> for getting started, then GameMaker <br/>
and Unity for more advanced.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024834533">My son has enjoyed Scratch, Kodu, and GameMaker- all are free or have free versions. He also makes a lot of mini-games within Minecraft, which might be something to try if your son is already playing it. If he has access to a PS3, Little Big Planet 2 lets you create your own levels- XBox games may have something similar.<br/>
