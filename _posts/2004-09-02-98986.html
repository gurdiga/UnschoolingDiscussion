 </span></blockquote>***************************************************************<br/>
Angela,<br/>
<br/>
This was a tuff position to be in with the horses.<br/>
My daughter Cassidy (4) did approach the 3 girls while playing in the floor <br/>
Sat night. She watched quietly for a few then asked to play. I watched as one <br/>
of the girls kept her hand on the horse closest to Cassidy. After a couple <br/>
minutes the girls mentioned something about the elevator which my 4 yr. old picked <br/>
up on and then excitedly asked if she could go too. I felt so upset that she <br/>
didn&#39;t understand that the girls wanted to play alone. I thought what do I <br/>
tell her? How can I say this?<br/>
<br/>
My only other one on one experience with her not being able to play with two <br/>
girls was one time at the playground about a month ago. There were two girls <br/>
about a year or so older than she. They said to her your fat you cant play, <br/>
these are my monkey bars you cant use them, im prettier than you and I have more <br/>
friends than you do. <br/>
My daughter doesn&#39;t understand when others dont want to play or they comment <br/>
like the girls at the playground did. <br/>
<br/>
At the conference I told her that they wanted to play alone. She persisted <br/>
about taking the elevator so she could play with them. I explained the best I <br/>
could without harming her spirit. In the end she knows that she doesn&#39;t like to <br/>
share with her brother all the time so she understood. We later took a trip to <br/>
the top floor and back down again so was just fine with that.<br/>
<br/>
As to the horses they are expensive. I would guess that a lot of the kids <br/>
dont know the difference between the cheap ones and the real ones. But even if <br/>
there were cheaper ones to offer I wonder if that would have still been a <br/>
concern. The girls I saw defiantly were older than my daughter so I dont know if it <br/>
was a bond she would have been able to join in cheap horse or not. I guess it <br/>
could be similar to a group playing video games or Yugio(sp) cards with an <br/>
approaching toddler.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in the end from my perspective im glad that she isn&#39;t afraid to ask <br/>
to play or assume that she can. I think lots of kids have that free spirit <br/>
taken away and wont even approach other kids out of fear of rejection. On the <br/>
other side that leaves kids like the horse playing girls open to having to say <br/>
we&#39;d like to play alone. <br/>
In the end I do hope the girls were able to have fun and continue their play.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Ok, I do alot of lurking and reading and have<br/>
learned alot from doing that.  But I have to ask,<br/>
where does compassion come into play here?  I am<br/>
probably going to really catch it from some of you,<br/>
but I see so much selfishness in some of this.  My son<br/>
is 10 and we have always encouraged him to share.  I<br/>
won&#39;t say that we forced him but it was always<br/>
something that he knew we expected.  I have seen him<br/>
develop such compassion for other kids, especially<br/>
younger ones.  Maybe it is because I have always come<br/>
at it from the other kids perspective.  Asked him to<br/>
put himself in their place.  We don&#39;t have alot of<br/>
money, never have.  That has been an amazing blessing<br/>
because he doesn&#39;t put too much value on &quot;things&quot;.  He<br/>
puts his value on people and relationships.  He went<br/>
to the skate park Monday and he joyfully shared the<br/>
amazing, mongoose bike that one of the teens at our<br/>
church had built for himself and gave to Joshua.  I<br/>
love to see how giving he is and the joy he gets from<br/>
sharing.  He does have some things he collects that he<br/>
keeps up and doesn&#39;t play with himself because he<br/>
wants them to stay nice. So I do understand that part.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I kept a little boy this summer who is not a sharer. <br/>
And I know his mom has tried to teach him this.  He<br/>
came expecting to share all of Joshua&#39;s things but<br/>
would bring things that Joshua &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; play with. <br/>
It gave me a chance to discuss with Joshua how this<br/>
made him feel.  We are trying to teach him the value<br/>
of having a servants heart and in giving other people<br/>
joy.  And yes, this does go along with my chrisian<br/>
beliefs.  But christian or not is that not a desirable<br/>
trait to teach a child?  We take joy is sharing and<br/>
giving to others.  He wouldn&#39;t have blinked twice at<br/>
sharing with a 4 yr. old (even a girl) and probably<br/>
would have asked her before she could ask.  He would<br/>
have asked because he didn&#39;t want to cause her pain. <br/>
<br/>
Am I wrong because I want him to be a compassionate<br/>
person?  I don&#39;t see that as breaking his spirit by<br/>
encouraging him to share. I believe that he is partly<br/>
the person he is because of the stand we have taken. <br/>
Am I misunderstanding the motive behind the not<br/>
sharing thing?  Sorry if I anger some of you.  I am<br/>
just really trying to understand here.  And I don&#39;t<br/>
think hurting people is ever a good thing.  Christy <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147721038">Laura,<br/>
I am sorry that your dd felt left out.  :0(<br/>
 <br/>
I have some jumbled ideas about all this floating in my head.  I&#39;ll try to<br/>
make sense.<br/>
 <br/>
I talk regularly with my girls (when the topic comes up, one way or another)<br/>
about seeing things from other people&#39;s perspective.  It has been helpful<br/>
for them to try to see things this way.  It *has* helped them to become more<br/>
compassionate.  <br/>
 <br/>
They are so incredibly uncomfortable around new people that being in a group<br/>
setting is very hard for them. (And I coerced them into coming to a<br/>
conference with over 500 ppl.)  I try to see it from their perspective too.<br/>
I was so relieved that they had at least made one friend at the conference<br/>
and that they seemed to have formed a connection.  They seem to really need<br/>
a connection to other children to really feel relaxed and enjoy them. (Guess<br/>
I do too.)  When they feel this connection, they are very generous and<br/>
trusting.  Dd2 bought her new friend a candy bar with her own money while we<br/>
were at the conference.  She can be so sweet.  The candy bar cost half of<br/>
her weekly allowance.<br/>
 <br/>
When your dd approached the girls, it was the last day of the conference,<br/>
after having their things taken a few times without being asked and after<br/>
spending two days feeling overwhelmed by having so many children approach<br/>
them repeatedly to play with them or to ask to play with their things.  By<br/>
that point, they just wanted to be left alone.  This doesn&#39;t mean that not<br/>
considering another child&#39;s feelings is ok, but might help to explain why<br/>
they didn&#39;t show more compassion at that point.  They are still young too<br/>
(almost 8 and 9.5) and still learning how to politely show people where<br/>
their boundaries are.  I do encourage my kids to let people know where their<br/>
boundaries are.  If they are uncomfortable in a situation, it&#39;s important to<br/>
be able to say so.  (I&#39;m thinking long term, here...being able to say no,<br/>
they don&#39;t want to play with another child (gently) might lead up to being<br/>
able to say no to a strange adult who tries to lure them into a car.)<br/>
 <br/>
I do encourage my children to share, but I don&#39;t force it.  (Did when they<br/>
were toddlers though and it didn&#39;t seem very respectful of them and it<br/>
didn&#39;t make them want to share.) I am not sure what that would do for them,<br/>
other than create resentment at this point.  (And no we don&#39;t have a lot of<br/>
money (which is part of why the horses are so valuable to the kids) or focus<br/>
more on things than people).  I have to work with my children&#39;s<br/>
personalities though in trying to impart a sharing attitude and from just my<br/>
own two children, I already know that generosity with things and the value<br/>
of things is different from child to child.  One of my girls just listed<br/>
some toys she doesn&#39;t want anymore on ebay.  (so she can save for another<br/>
Breyer horse.)  The other one wouldn&#39;t ever part with anything that was<br/>
given to her, ever.  She knows who gave it to her and when, all the way back<br/>
to when she was two.  Her things have a value to them that even I can&#39;t see.<br/>
I don&#39;t understand it, but I respect her choice to keep her things.  <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve tried group things over and over again.  My kids just don&#39;t enjoy<br/>
group things.  They never relax and be themselves.  We were in a play group<br/>
weekly for 6 months (when the kids were 4 and 6) with 10 children and they<br/>
still couldn&#39;t relax and enjoy themselves.  We went to Sunday school from<br/>
the time they were 1 and 3 till they were probably 5 and 7 and they still<br/>
never felt at home there. They are insulted when people cut in line.  They<br/>
are insulted when people push and shove.  They are insulted when people<br/>
(adults or kids) push them to interact when they aren&#39;t ready.  <br/>
 <br/>
When someone cuts in line in front of them or plows by them knocking them<br/>
out of the way, they always ask me why.  Why didn&#39;t they see me?  Why didn&#39;t<br/>
they just ask me to move?  Why didn&#39;t they get in line behind me?  I try to<br/>
explain it, (maybe they were so excited about X that they looked right<br/>
through you) but I am often at a loss to explain other children&#39;s behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s harder for extroverted people to understand introverted people<br/>
than it is for introverted people to understand extroverted people.  We can<br/>
understand why it hurts for someone to feel left out.  But it seems like<br/>
it&#39;s hard for some people to understand why some people prefer to play one<br/>
on one.<br/>
 <br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917439622">** Am I wrong because I want him to be a compassionate<br/>

<br/>
This is a tough question.<br/>
<br/>
I think some people can take the idea of being a &quot;servant&quot; and getting <br/>
satisfaction from serving others too far.  There are certainly people <br/>
who take on so much volunteer work that they don&#39;t have enough time to <br/>
exercise and rest enough to protect their own health.  Trusting other <br/>
people not to impose or trusting god to give one strength doesn&#39;t always <br/>
work.  How is one going to take care of oneself without at least some <br/>
&quot;selfishness&quot; or sense of self?<br/>
<br/>
Can you explain why taking care of someone else is better than taking <br/>
care of oneself?<br/>
<br/>
**I don&#39;t see that as breaking his spirit by encouraging him to share. **<br/>
<br/>
Yes, encouraging makes sense.  But forced sharing ISN&#39;T sharing.  In <br/>
fact a kid who is forced to share doesn&#39;t even really *own* his own <br/>
toys, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Kids vary in when they are ready to share and how quickly they feel <br/>
empathy for strangers.  This is probably mostly not caused by the <br/>
parenting techniques used, but is just variation in personality.  (My <br/>
opinion again.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; understand why it hurts for someone to feel left out.  But it seems like<br/>

&gt; on one.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is very important.<br/>
<br/>
I used to say &quot;everyone gets to play&quot; to my kids no matter what.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
want someone to be left out, feel sad.  Ended up just making the kids that<br/>
wanted to play one-on-one resentful.<br/>
<br/>
So now we talk about respecting others.  If 2 kids want to play alone, I<br/>
talk with the other about that, about how we can&#39;t MAKE people change just<br/>
because we want them to, about how would they like it if I MADE them do<br/>
something they didn&#39;t want to do.<br/>
<br/>
I also talk to the kids playing alone about how the other person feels, if<br/>
there is something the other person is doing that is problematic (in which<br/>
case, I talk to that person).<br/>
<br/>
Problem is that when you add another person it changes the dynamic of the<br/>
play....sometimes that is enjoyable for all parties and sometimes it isn&#39;t,<br/>
sometimes it has to do with the particular person wanting to join in and<br/>
sometimes it is just that &quot;what we are doing is so fun that we don&#39;t want it<br/>
to change&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It is a definite balancing act.<br/>

are always people who will take advantage and you do<br/>

many people that care for others as a way of life. <br/>

don&#39;t get me wrong, sometimes you just do what you<br/>

done.  But where would our church be if no one did but<br/>
what they felt like doing.  The things I see when<br/>
there is a death, or an illness, or a job lost, any<br/>
number of tragedies, the way people love each other<br/>
and step up to help out, those are the things I want<br/>
my family and my son to learn.  We have had several<br/>
deaths in our church in the past year and I have<br/>
gotten to see this first hand.  One of which was my<br/>
dad.  And I wouldn&#39;t have made it without my church<br/>
family caring for us.  His illness was long and very<br/>
painful and they cared for us while we cared for him. <br/>
Did they all want to cook and clean for us everyday? <br/>
I doubt it.  But they did and that was what made it<br/>
all the more special.  Does that help?  Christy <br/>

&lt;&lt;  And<br/>
don&#39;t get me wrong, sometimes you just do what you<br/>
know needs to be done just because it needs to be<br/>
done.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to if you don&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But where would our church be if no one did but<br/>
what they felt like doing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People choose to help other people because it makes them feel better to do <br/>
so, or makes them feel they have done their duty to God, or something.  <br/>
<br/>
If you really look at those things, people are making choices.<br/>
<br/>
When a person &quot;has to&quot; go to work, he is choosing to go to work.   There are <br/>
alternatives, but he liked the alternatives less than he disliked work.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some of a previous discussion on this, and some related links:<br/>

Compassion is learned better from example and from philosophical <br/>
underpinnings than from any requirements or &quot;rules.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622322725">And I don&#39;t think hurting people is ever a good thing.  Christy <br/>
<br/>
****************<br/>
<br/>
This sentence really stands out to me as it seems to put the <br/>
needs/desires of strangers over the needs/wishes of your own child.  <br/>
It does, really and truly hurts a child who&#39;s need to control their <br/>
belongings is overlooked and belittled.  I would never, ever shame <br/>
or guilt my friends into sharing with someone we just met in a <br/>
restaurant (having expectations means being disappointed when <br/>
they&#39;re not met, your child knows this)... why oh why would I expect <br/>
a child at a conference, possibly far from home, in an environment <br/>
where many adults feel overwhelmed, to share with complete <br/>
strangers??  Please HONOR your child, LISTEN to their needs, be <br/>
INTERESTED in them... stop worrying about what others think, your <br/>
first responsibility is to your own children.  <br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t feel you&#39;ve made anyone upset by your child&#39;s <br/>
behavior.  Of all the places on the planet for you to find <br/>
understanding for your child&#39;s needs, it is the Live and Learn <br/>
Conference.  <br/>
