LEARNING WITHOUT A CURRICULUM.<br/>
     Catalog #3182......................Price $16.00<br/>
Two 60-minute cassettes and all the handouts from Pat Farenga&#39;s seminar at<br/>
the Holt Associates offices. Covers the philosophical, historical, research<br/>
and educational contexts for learning without curricula, reporting such<br/>
learning to school officials, and discusses how interested adults can<br/>
facilitate and nurture, rather than dictate and control, children&#39;s<br/>
learning. We learn without curricula before we reach school age and after<br/>
we graduate, so what&#39;s the big deal? Explores contexts for learning other<br/>
than schooling&#39;s structure and discusses when programmed learning is<br/>
appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
LIVING IS LEARNING Curriculum Guides, Nancy Plent.<br/>
&quot;How do we know if our children are learning what school covers? How do we<br/>
report unschooling/homeschooling to schools?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nancy Plent, the founder of the Unschoolers Network of NJ, compiles the<br/>
curricular goals for each year of school and translates them into real-life<br/>
situations unschoolers can relate to. Packed with suggestions for meeting<br/>
and exceeding these guidelines, these books double as record-keepers to<br/>
help you organize your children&#39;s learning into an &quot;after-the-fact&quot;<br/>
curriculum that schools can recognize. Compiled from national and state<br/>
curricular guidelines, these books help you see what is going on in most<br/>
schools for each grade level. A confidence builder for anyone wondering if<br/>
they have what it takes to &quot;cover&quot; a year of learning without going to<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
also here&#39;s an actual (low cost) curriculum<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.trisms.com/">http://www.trisms.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
TRISMS homeschool curriculum was developed for our own children because we<br/>
felt it would provide them with a well-rounded education as well as<br/>
stimulate interest and a desire to learn.  It not only provided directed<br/>
study but allowed them to branch off into their own areas of personal<br/>
interest.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It seems as though I am in the minority when it comes to<br/>
 putting the kids to bed at 9pm. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re definitely in the minority in the night owl thread too.  My kids LOVE <br/>
to go to bed at around 6:30 - 7:00 pm!  They wake up fully charged at 5:00 <br/>
am, and have a wonderful time until we&#39;re up and alert (although the baby has <br/>
been getting up around 5:00 as well, so one of us is usually up.)  When I&#39;ve <br/>
tried to gently steer their schedule towards a later night and a later <br/>
morning, they have become crabby, exhausted, and even ended up getting sick <br/>
(unusual stress on the body).  I don&#39;t push it anymore.  Once in a great <br/>
while they will ask to stay up late.  Everybody&#39;s different, I guess!  As for <br/>
me, between the lupus and the wakeful baby, I&#39;d like to sleep for about 48 <br/>
straight hours.  I would find it sublime to go to bed by 8:00 pm and not get <br/>
up until the next noon!  I know, I know - what a slovenly attitude - but I&#39;m <br/>
POOPED.  These days when I fantasize, it&#39;s about sleep...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775720261">Dara,  You are  not alone on the bedtime routines;  my kids also go to bed <br/>
earlier in the evenings, usually  they are all asleep by 8:30pm.  They, too, <br/>
need and even crave the bedtime as they are up early in the morning.  It is <br/>
not unusual for my kids to up and going strong by 6:00 or 6:30 am.  My oldest <br/>
would be up that early even if he was up later at night.  He just has always <br/>
been an early riser.  To be honest, after a busy day with my 3, who are all 5 <br/>
and under in age, I need them to be in bed at a earlier hour, than others may <br/>
feel a need for right now.  Maybe when the kids are older I will not need <br/>
this routine, but for now it is best for my family, as it seems to be for <br/>
yours.  About C. Mason-- I just ordered  the  book describing the method she <br/>
advocated, & I am eager to read it;  later I can decide if it seems right for <br/>
our family.  I think she had some very good ideas, I just need to do some <br/>
studying on it now.  I&#39;m sure there will be more thoughts and opinions about <br/>
her  ideas from others who have/are using them.  This list has some very  <br/>
intelligent, creative parents who contribute timely info & advice that I <br/>
always look forward to reading.                             Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397906941">Kim-  With lupus and a baby you DESERVE 48 hours of sleep.<br/>
Not slovenly at all!!!<br/>
Lisa- I never see articles on homeschooling in our paper.<br/>
Susan- Thank you for the great information.  I think for me<br/>
getting started will be hardest.  I am more fearful of<br/>
mistakes I will make (which I expect) that will be<br/>
detrimental to my kids.  I know it will be great once I get<br/>
over the fear of taking over their education.  I am<br/>
considering doing the Five in a Row over the summer to get a<br/>
feel for unit studies.  I will probably end up taking a bit<br/>
of all types of homeschool/unschooling philosophies and<br/>
tailor them to suit our needs.<br/>
Karen- I too just ordered the C. Mason book (short version)<br/>
to review.  Our local library has nothing by Mason or Holt!<br/>
Shocking since their methods seem to be talked about most.<br/>
I just purchased/borrowed the following books and they seem<br/>
very helpful with lots of good ideas and resources: Linda<br/>
Dobson- &quot;Homeschooling the early years&quot;, &quot;Homeschooling the<br/>
middle years&quot;.<br/>
&quot; What your fourth grader needs to know&quot; by E.D. Hirsch.  I<br/>
have to educate myself so I can better educate them.  I<br/>
don&#39;t want my kids to hate school as I did.  I didn&#39;t go to<br/>
college until I was 21 because of my own experience and can<br/>
count on one hand the teachers who inspired me!  When I did<br/>
go to college, they wanted me to pick a major by my junior<br/>
year but I wanted to pick & choose the courses that I would<br/>
take.  In the end it all worked out but I had forgotten all<br/>
of that until this year when my fourth grader complained<br/>
about boredom.  She also asked if she could learn at home.<br/>
She hates school, gets straight a&quot;s and makes no effort.<br/>
The most fun she has is when she has to do a project. She is<br/>
able to be creative and puts much more effort forth.  Based<br/>
on what I&#39;ve seen she would benefit greatly.  My 6 year old<br/>
daughter is a highly social creature so that may be tough.<br/>
She has a great teacher but that won&#39;t always be the case.<br/>
She will be the one who resists the homeschooling.  Any one<br/>
else have this problem?<br/>
Just today a neighbor who isn&#39;t homeschooling gave ma a book<br/>
called, &quot;Core Knowledge Sequence- grade K-6&quot;  Has anyone<br/>
here used this?<br/>
I really appreciate the advice and info you all so freely<br/>
give.  Knowing so many of you are out there makes me feel<br/>
supported in my efforts.<br/>
Thanks a million!  Dara</div>

about 11pm onward.  One of my oldest best memories is the night I was<br/>
sitting on the kitchen floor listening to her as she cooked dinner for<br/>
herself after karate.  I was doing really well, or so I thought. I was<br/>
asking questions and everything......till I woke up   She said I had gone to<br/>
sleep mid-sentence.  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Read everything!  All writing on educational matters is food for thought and<br/>
each family has to sort out what works for them.  Developing your own<br/>
philosophy of education is the fun part of all of this.   Being able to say<br/>
why something rings true for you gives you a solid foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, over time, it&#39;s going to shift and change, as you grow and<br/>
change.  Your children will force you to bend and sway.  It&#39;s a wonderful<br/>
dance!<br/>

<br/>
     My almost 8 year old has always been like this.  He will put himself to <br/>
bed even if the rest of us are up and he is always the first up in the <br/>
morning.  But recently I decided to try having all of us go to bed earlier <br/>
and get up earlier because I had come across some information on the body&#39;s <br/>
melatonin being produced to correspond with the natural cycles of lightness <br/>
and darkness.  My mom read that women who sleep with a night light have <br/>
higher rates of breast cancer (she had breast cancer and so is particularly <br/>
interested in things relating to it).  <br/>
     Anyway, we started having the kids go to bed by about nine and us by <br/>
about ten or eleven (I&#39;m someone who can easily stay up till two or three <br/>
reading).  We started waking up by about 6:30 and sometimes I even wake up at <br/>
5 or 5:30.  This has become my new reading time.  My 15 yr old, who was <br/>
resistant to the idea (but I asked him to just try it for a week or two as an <br/>
experiment) actually said he feels a lot better.  I like the early morning <br/>
quite a lot and felt like I was missing it before.  Also, it felt like my <br/>
days were flying by too fast.  So we think we&#39;re going to stick with this.<br/>
