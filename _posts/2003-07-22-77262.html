<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108646953">Hello Julie,<br/>
<br/>
To the contrary. I was merely calling attention<br/>
to an obvious attack on another person. You are free to<br/>
your opinion as I am. I too, am on a learning journey and do my best<br/>
at modelling my behavior, in all situations, even with people<br/>
I don&#39;t know, just as I&#39;d want to be treated. I am human and therefore<br/>
open to error like anyone else. That&#39;s ok. It&#39;s a learning journey.<br/>
I cannot teach what I don&#39;t practice. I attempt to walk my talk in<br/>
every area of my life, not just a few.<br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to convey heart felt feeling via email for me at times. I<br/>
eluded to this in my posting Dr. Rosenberg&#39;s wonderful article.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too bad it appears some here are simply intent on finding fault<br/>
no matter what one posts. Not all here appear to do this for which gives me<br/>
hope.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it important to treat all with dignity and respect whether I know<br/>
them or not.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you,<br/>
Jeva<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951842828">Hi Maureen,<br/>
<br/>
Let me explain and thank you for asking so I may clarify.<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m not defensive though I do feel it important to defend<br/>
people that appear under attack. I feel we can be extremely honest with one<br/>
another<br/>
without hurling insults or treating people terribly. It is suggested the<br/>
best way to teach<br/>
a human being is by modeling that behavior in which we seek that being to<br/>
follow. Children learn<br/>
from what they witness as do adults. Is it acceptable to only model my<br/>
behavior for my children? Would I want my children in later years to read<br/>
emails I&#39;ve posted to a person I don&#39;t agree with justifying my abuse and<br/>
lack of respect with various excuses because I feel I&#39;m right? Will I<br/>
trigger growth for another individual by attacking them? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
If I don&#39;t attempt to practice the very thing that I&#39;m attempting to convey,<br/>
I&#39;ve lost. Verbal abuse only begets more verbal abuse.<br/>
<br/>
The approach I feel works miracles is to perhaps plant a seed. Instead of<br/>
publicly degrading Oom and others no matter what the excuse, perhaps write<br/>
something very honest, yet with respect and explaining my fears about the<br/>
consequences for her, her child, and future generations of her family of<br/>
spanking in any forum. I may also include articles, statistics, or other<br/>
helpful information that may spark her and others reading my post to think<br/>
before spanking and reconsider the results of their actions.<br/>
<br/>
In Oom&#39;s case, instead of attack, I might suggest that as adults we are<br/>
responsible for our children in public places and depending on age and<br/>
development, certain children can&#39;t comprehend not walking into traffic.<br/>
Children many times aren&#39;t developmentally able to figure the logic of not<br/>
walking into a busy street. A good tool near streets and parking lots is to<br/>
hold tight to their hand, explaining *prior* to our journey the dangers of<br/>
big cars on little (and big) people, using stories, pictures, or how much we<br/>
love them and want them to be safe. The message before we even walk out the<br/>
door is &quot;I love you, want your safety, big cars can be dangerous, hold my<br/>
hand so I can help you be safe, etc...&quot; So this way, before we&#39;ve even begun<br/>
our trip, we&#39;ve talked about safety, my child knows why I&#39;m holding their<br/>
hand or carrying them or using a stroller in difficult situations, etc... Is<br/>
it my child&#39;s fault he/she walk out into traffic? No, it&#39;s my responsibility<br/>
to teach them about such things before the fact and holding them or tight to<br/>
their hand until I feel they are developmentally able to understand the<br/>
danger.  I can only share my experience strength and hope. I have no right<br/>
to degrade/abuse another human being no matter how justified I feel on this<br/>
list, in my home, or among strangers.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I could have posted this before, but first things first. Let us stop<br/>
abuse no matter what the excuse and give each other clear honest helpful<br/>
information with the respect we all deserve.  Perhaps by being &quot;giraffes&quot;,<br/>
we can promote positive change. For those who spank or are wondering if it&#39;s<br/>
a solution, please consider alternatives and know it&#39;s ok for all of us to<br/>
make mistakes. It&#39;s also ok to rethink out behavior as parents and choose to<br/>
try another way. What works for us in our family is to attempt to guide<br/>
children before events can occur such as walking near traffic. I&#39;m glad all<br/>
are here, even those that spank as together, with gentleness, I pray we can<br/>
all find a better way and continue to grow and learn  with dignity and<br/>
respect for one another we all deserve.<br/>
<br/>

Start over - read posts with that gentle voice you want to hear IN your <br/>

Don&#39;t judge people based only on what they say when they&#39;ve (finally) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133422378">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
Be it attacks on her person or actions, posts filled with sarcasm and <br/>
insults aren&#39;t the way to promote positive change. One cannot promote <br/>
peace with violence. The person under attack, as anyone would, loses <br/>
the message but remembers the attack. Hey! Isn&#39;t that a bit like <br/>
spanking? Yes, I think so. <br/>
<br/>
We can attempt to justify any type of negative behavior, but what <br/>
works is patient guidance and understanding. <br/>
<br/>
Prior to topics getting heated, perhaps we can attempt to make a <br/>
positive change and work *with* people as we do our children and <br/>
guide them to a better and easier way. Share our experience, strength <br/>
and hope in all areas with articles, stories, ideas, and love. What&#39;s <br/>
that? She isn&#39;t hearing you? Perhaps not now, but by gentle guidance, <br/>
the seed has been planted, and it may happen that the next time <br/>
anyone here who chose spanking prior, may decide to make a positive <br/>
change. Not because I beat it into her being with sarcasm and self <br/>
rightousness, but because I honestly and gently attempted to show <br/>
her/him a better way with kindness and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
This list doesn&#39;t have to be a forum for lashing out. Just as much as <br/>
there is no need to spank, swat, or hit any living creature, there <br/>
too is no need to do the same thing verbally.<br/>
<br/>
What has happened in Oom&#39;s case is that she&#39;s been lashed out at, is <br/>
apparently now uncomfortable, has received very little understanding <br/>
or kindness, and the end result? She&#39;s leaving. <br/>
<br/>
That makes me very sad and it is so not necessary. I hope she <br/>
reconsiders as I feel her presence here, like everyone&#39;s is very <br/>
important. By verbal attacks and lack of understanding, we may have <br/>
lost the chance to enact positive change and show people who use <br/>
physical force that hey, let us find a better way... I understand <br/>
that certain experts say this and that, etc... but perhaps simply try <br/>
this or that, it works for myself and others, and spanking, swatting, <br/>
or any hitting won&#39;t be necessary. The added benefit is that you and <br/>
your child will build a better and stronger relationship based on <br/>
communication and respect.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095625536">Jeva - all that you suggested was already gently and kindly suggested <br/>
early on and repeatedly since then. Can&#39;t be said often enough, I <br/>
suppose, but I thought you&#39;d want to know that you&#39;re not coming up <br/>
with something that hasn&#39;t been offered already.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to think that Oom came here looking for parenting help and got <br/>
attacked for admitting to spanking her 3 yo child. But that isn&#39;t what <br/>
happened at ALL. She started this thread as a debate, not as a request <br/>
for ideas or information or help or encouragement. She brought up <br/>
having spanked her kid, 9 years ago, and that onlookers on a public <br/>
street applauded when she did it, as an argument that would prove to <br/>
the rest of us that spanking is a good thing - the only thing that <br/>
would save a kids&#39; life in some circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Every offer of other ideas has been met with an immediate rebuttal and <br/>
reiteration of the necessity of spanking.<br/>
<br/>
EVEN when the conversation wasn&#39;t really about her and her one example <br/>
from 9 years ago, she kept bringing it back to being personal and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t let it just evolve, as conversations here normally do, from <br/>
one thing (her claim that spanking is good for kids safety) to other <br/>
discussion that branched off from that. And THAT is when she got <br/>
criticized - it was for her current behavior that was obstructive on <br/>
the list - not for her lack of understanding of how to protect a child <br/>
without hitting him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284951079">Hi Pam, <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I read the archives and am aware of what happened. <br/>
<br/>
As with any being, I cannot justify criticizing. If my child refuses <br/>
to accept my guidance on a certain issue am I justified in <br/>
criticizing him/her? No more than I am justified in spanking. <br/>
<br/>
Simply because Oom wasn&#39;t choosing at this point and time to see a <br/>
certain point of view is no justification to be unkind.<br/>
<br/>
How many people have I talked to about this topic and none of our <br/>
posts have gotten brutal. It&#39;s not necessary for me to verbally abuse <br/>
people to get my point across or criticize. I&#39;m simply asking, that <br/>
instead of focusing on what we feel Oom may be doing wrong, that no <br/>
matter what she as a parent chooses, that she continue to be gently <br/>
guided with non-violent paths to not spanking. She&#39;s and others like <br/>
myself here are much more likely to be motivated with kindness. <br/>
<br/>
As with unschooling in our home, I&#39;m a student as well. I think I&#39;ve <br/>
stated my feelings as well as I possibly can and so I&#39;ll move on from <br/>
this topic. It still stands that you can&#39;t attempt to help someone <br/>
stop hitting their child when you are bashing them and being critical <br/>
verbally. There&#39;s no justification in any type of violence.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, onward forth to more positive gentle learning I hope.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your child isn&#39;t asking for your advice. Your child didn&#39;t join your group<br/>
that had gathered for the sole purpose of discussing the advice you give and<br/>
then publicly say over and over that it&#39;s useless. You child didn&#39;t refuse<br/>
to stay silent on the subject and didn&#39;t need to keep repeating that you<br/>
were wrong and that she was right.<br/>
<br/>
People who come to the list are asking for advice. They are saying, by<br/>
signing on and posting, help me get to unschooling. Oom may have said help<br/>
me, but she was *publicly stating* -- not just privately thinking -- that<br/>
she had no intention of changing her mind and that she was still right<br/>
regardless of what anyone said to her.<br/>
<br/>
If Oom had not said another word about spanking, the subject would have<br/>
dropped or gone on without her to a more general discussion of spanking. All<br/>
she needed to do was stop saying spanking is a good idea. She could believe<br/>
it for the rest of her life.<br/>
<br/>
It was as jarring and as useless and as full of noise (though more damaging)<br/>
as someone continually stating on a vegetarian list that meat was good for<br/>
her and she needed meat for iron purposes (despite the number of suggestions<br/>
on how to get iron otherwise).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Simply because Oom wasn&#39;t choosing at this point and time to see a<br/>
&gt; certain point of view is no justification to be unkind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one needs to accept anything that&#39;s said here. People are welcome to<br/>
offer counter evidence if they feel that what someone is saying isn&#39;t taking<br/>
into account some factor that many people need to consider.<br/>
<br/>
What isn&#39;t helpful to anyone is taking a public stand to insist that a point<br/>
is right without supporting it. One of the most valuable things about this<br/>
list is holding ideas up to examination and sticking to discussing what is<br/>
knowable rather than what can be believed.<br/>
<br/>
Our society is chock full of beliefs that seem right but are there because<br/>
of fear. People send their children to school because of fear. They hit and<br/>
punish their children because of fear. (As well as other reasons for both of<br/>
those.) Oom feared for her child&#39;s life so she swatted him. Others on this<br/>
list might have done the same given the same circumstances and same lack of<br/>
knowledge of alternatives. The difference is Oom didn&#39;t want to examine the<br/>
belief that led her to feel that swatting for safety reasosn was a good<br/>
philosophy. She wanted to cling to her belief that she was right. She wanted<br/>
to have the right publicly say *here* that it was good advice.<br/>
<br/>
She has a right to cling to her belief. She does&#39;t have a right to bring it<br/>
here and present it as good advice. People have signed onto the list<br/>
trusting they&#39;ll get help getting to unschooling. They don&#39;t need strong<br/>
words confidently supporting fearful practices. They need more examination.<br/>
<br/>
We can help people hold their beliefs up to examination. People who publicly<br/>
state that they are not going to examine and will hold onto their beliefs no<br/>
matter what are hindering the usefulness of the list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You said you read the thread. Oom didn&#39;t want to be guided. She wanted her<br/>
point of view validated by the group. She wanted a *public* statement that<br/>
it was okay for her to hold her beliefs. Why was she asking for that<br/>
validation? Why did she need other people to publicly say it was okay to<br/>
believe what she wanted to believe? (If she didn&#39;t need that validation, she<br/>
would have just dropped the subject.)<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t for public validation of unexamined beliefs. We&#39;re not here<br/>
to support what people want to believe is true. We&#39;re here to help them to<br/>
get to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t want the advice we have to offer, they&#39;re plenty welcome<br/>
to not take it. They are not welcome to publicly state over and over that<br/>
thoughts they refuse to examine are a good and useful thing for parents to<br/>
do. There are other lists where those unexamined thoughts will be welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It still stands that you can&#39;t attempt to help someone<br/>
&gt; stop hitting their child when you are bashing them and being critical<br/>
&gt; verbally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People can attempt it. It&#39;s possible that it won&#39;t succeed. But do you know<br/>
for certain that no one who has faced harsh public words has ever changed?<br/>
It seems right and true that gentle words will work better for everyone, but<br/>
do you know that?<br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s one of those beliefs that people would prefer not to examine because<br/>
being gentle just has to be better.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not advocating harsh treatment. (And in this instance I don&#39;t think the<br/>
treatment was harsh until people got frustrated.) I don&#39;t like harsh for<br/>
myself. And it&#39;s not the tool I find effective for getting my point across.<br/>
But I do know that there are people here who have said they appreciated what<br/>
they felt were harsh words at the time. (In fact one or two have said so in<br/>
the past few days.) The blunt words helped them examine beliefs they held.<br/>
<br/>
Some people find gentle words useful to give them time to think. Some people<br/>
find blunt words force them to see things in ways they didn&#39;t want to see.<br/>
Both are offered here. It&#39;s up to each person to pick and choose what style<br/>
works for them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I do feel it important to defend<br/>
people that appear under attack. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Having not read the beginning of the discussion, I guess you were unaware <br/>
that it started with people hoping to better the situation of two boys whose <br/>
mother was advocating spanking and saying boys were &quot;retarded.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you were somewhere and a man was being thrown to the ground and yelled at, <br/>
how hard would you work to stop them and pick him up?  Would you be <br/>
embarrassed or apologetic if you found out later that he was a purse snatcher or had <br/>
assaulted a young girl and THAT is why he was apparently under attack?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would I want my children in later years to read<br/>
emails I&#39;ve posted to a person I don&#39;t agree with justifying my abuse and<br/>
lack of respect with various excuses because I feel I&#39;m right?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never written anything I wouldn&#39;t be willing for my kids to read right <br/>
now.  They&#39;re proud when I defend other children&#39;s right to a peaceful <br/>
existence.  I&#39;ve done it in person and I&#39;ve done it in writing.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; What has happened in Oom&#39;s case is that she&#39;s been lashed out at, is <br/>
<br/>
apparently now uncomfortable, has received very little understanding <br/>
<br/>
or kindness, and the end result? She&#39;s leaving. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That makes me very sad and it is so not necessary. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could go with her!  You and Oom could make another list which is ALWAYS <br/>
sweet and understanding, where you and Oom together can explain...   what?  Are <br/>
you an unschooler?  She seems not to be.  Do you spank?  It seems she does.<br/>

&lt;&lt; As with any being, I cannot justify criticizing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THAT&#39;S FUNNY!!!!<br/>
<br/>
HYENA LANGUAGE!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Simply because Oom wasn&#39;t choosing at this point and time to see a <br/>
<br/>
certain point of view is no justification to be unkind.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you were having a meeting in a public meeting room and someone came in <br/>
ranting on and on about how what you were doing was stupid and you should do the <br/>
OTHER thing, how kind would you be?  Would you sacrifice the time and energy <br/>
of the cooperative people who came to the meeting to &quot;be kind&quot; to the disruptor?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How many people have I talked to about this topic and none of our <br/>
<br/>
posts have gotten brutal.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How about pointless and mind-numbing and NOT ABOUT UNSCHOOLING?<br/>
<br/>
Jeva, do you have children?  How long have you unschooled?<br/>
