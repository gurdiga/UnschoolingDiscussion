<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016052681">If you currently know enough about finances to work with your son in a<br/>
responsible manner, I don&#39;t think it is fair to blame your current financial<br/>
problems on &quot;how you were raised.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I have since worked through many of these things on my own and am no longer having current financial problems.  I just learned the hard way as a very, young adult.  I don&#39;t blame my parents for things, I just look for cause and effect so that I can learn from my past and do better for my family now.  I do think that &quot;how you are raised&quot; can effect your life.  If not, we all wouldn&#39;t spend so much time learning from each other and from books, how to be good parents.    My parents did what they thought was right at the time, but they told me themselves that they put very little thought into it and never read anything about parenting.  I want to do better.  <br/>
My two cents back.<br/>
