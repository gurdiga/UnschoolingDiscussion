<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048080220">My daughters, 11 and 13, LOVE the Harry Potter series. They have created a <br/>
very involved mystery game that they play together regularly that has gone <br/>
on for months.<br/>
<br/>
Now they are busy writing their own &quot;books&quot; that are take-offs from the <br/>
originals. Are there other &quot;Harry Potter-Crazed&quot; Unschoolers out there who <br/>
would enjoy sharing stories they have written that were inspired from the HP <br/>
books?<br/>
<br/>
Francesca and Sierra would love to be members of a Harry Potter Club where <br/>
they could share their stories with others of like-mind along with all other <br/>
ideas and games inspired by the HP books.<br/>
<br/>
Please respond if you know of such a group or if you know how we could <br/>
create one!<br/>
<br/>
Linda, the mom.<br/>

<div>Hi Linda, </div>
<div>My DD&#39;s (14 &amp; 10 yo) are Harry Potter doozies too!&nbsp; They are 
joined to a role playing list.&nbsp; They pick a character, either from the 
books, or make up their own and they interact with other people in an ongoing 
story! If your girls are interested, you can find it at <a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="mailto:AHarryRPG@egroups.com">AHarryRPG@egroups.com</a> My DD&#39;s user names 
are Hunefer Horus and Shauria Orcinus (not their real names!)</div>
<div>I am sure my DD&#39;s would love to be involved in a Stories-sharing list as 
well.&nbsp; I could have my DD start one.&nbsp; Let me know!</div>
<div>Have fun!</div>
