&gt;  Thank you Sandra for your kind and wonderful advice.  I will definitely stop<br/>
&gt; throwing temper tantrums around here.. Gosh, I&#39;ve broken 5 sewing machines, 3<br/>
&gt; microwaves,  and 3 mixers in just the past 6 months.. I also wrecked my car<br/>
&gt; and punched out my window.   I attacked my husband and tried to choke him,<br/>
&gt; then I kicked him in the groin last night.  I yelled at my kids and called<br/>
&gt; them no-good fuckers and said they were worthless and they ruined my life. .<br/>
&gt; Just a few days ago the bread I was making didnt turn out right so I trashed<br/>
&gt; the whole god damned oven.  Do  you think, when I couldnt get my on loan lap<br/>
&gt; top from school   to come on and I smashed it to the floor and stomped on it,<br/>
&gt; could that have been a bad example?  You know, I never realized how my<br/>
&gt; behavior could affect my kids .  What an insight.. So, do you think, if I<br/>
&gt; stop behaving like this, my sons will stop too??   Maybe its worth a try.<br/>
&gt; You know, I really thought you didnt like me, how paranoid of me..  I really<br/>
&gt; need to work on not being so schizo and afraid that folks are against me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it works in Doddville, it MUST work here too.. Thanks again<br/>

about the fact that the above is indeed the adult version of a temper<br/>
tantrum, thrown here on the list, in response to frustration over an issue<br/>
that you are having a hard time dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s point is illustrated: how you react is how your children are likely<br/>
to react. They just do it on a 7 and 11 year old level rather than a grown<br/>
woman level, as in the above.<br/>
