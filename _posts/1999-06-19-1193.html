<br/>
And it&#39;s about trust.  If parents would lie to a child about their genetic<br/>

be truly shattering, I think.<br/>

They shouldn&#39;t be adopting that child.<br/>
<br/>
I have a bit of experience with the adoption issue. <br/>
Besides, lying to a child is wrong. Especially when you consider it is their <br/>
right to know....it&#39;s about their birth, their heritage. Anyone that feels <br/>
strongly that they should lie about that, shouldn&#39;t adopt.<br/>

There are groups to help you with searches. I have done a long search, more <br/>
for my curiosity than dh&#39;s, for his birth mother. Hit some dead ends, but in <br/>
WA state there is a way to have a liason open the court records and perform a <br/>

Google it. There are better laws now, and more support out there for adoptees <br/>

Most adopted people have always known.<br/>
If not, it would be very damaging or at least difficult. My dh always knew, <br/>
it was considered special because he was chosen.<br/>
My three adopted siblings always knew. Two of them came to us older, so it <br/>
would not have been possible to lie! But my little brother doesn&#39;t remember <br/>
anything but our family. My mother made up a little book, with pictures that <br/>
told his story and how he came to us. It was beautiful.<br/>
The best thing imo, is to always talk about it openly and honestly, just as <br/>
you would a child&#39;s birth.  <br/>

LOTS of people lie.<br/>
People my age and older were often not told where they came from.  <br/>
I know many people my age who looked for children they put out for adoption, <br/>
and those adoptions were forced on them by parents who sent them to other <br/>
cities (lying to grandparents and aunts and uncles about why) and told them <br/>
NEVER to tell they had had a baby.<br/>
<br/>
How many husbands or wives have had an affair and kept it secret?<br/>
How many families have incest secrets?<br/>

I think in the rarified company of unschoolers while it&#39;s still a new and <br/>
difficult thing to do, you&#39;re preaching to the choir of angels about being <br/>
open and honest with children.  But to act as though ALL humans intend to be <br/>
honest and gentle with children is like denying there is car theft or robbery <br/>
or vandalism in the world.  <br/>
<br/>
I was warned/reminded two years ago NOT to mention that my cousin (now 44 or <br/>
so) was adopted, because she didn&#39;t know.    I seriously doubt that&#39;s true.  <br/>
My grandmother mentioned it lots to me, and although I had never talked about <br/>
it directly with Gayla, she was one of three in that family, the first was <br/>
adopted (her) and then my aunt got pregnant with a girl who looked like my <br/>
aunt and uncle and me and other relatives (Gayla was blonde and blue-eyed, in <br/>
a dark-haired family), and then there was a third child whose father was the <br/>
head of all the Masons in that state.  My uncle had been #2 Mason that <br/>
season, when his wife was impregnated by his lodgebrother.  BIG tacky <br/>
divorce, much acrimony, and thirty years later they thought they had kept a <br/>
secret?    <br/>
<br/>
Not every situation is clean and simple.  Few are.  It takes a lot of work.  <br/>
GOOD for those of you whose parents worked to make things right.  But please d<br/>
on&#39;t pretend there aren&#39;t other ways and other situations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359386593">Yup!!! After I sent the e-mail the other day about there being two situations of secret adoption in my family, I realized there are actually three that I know about, plus at least one secret child living with another family. Many more lies going on about other things, too. It&#39;s all so hard to keep up with, I simply don&#39;t talk about family stuff with family. Heck, Kelly likely knows at least some of the family, living in Columbia. They&#39;ve always been here, I&#39;m the newcomer! (Last name Redmon ring a bell, Kelly? LOL) My parents moved away when I was a baby because of the secret my mom wanted to keep from her father. As a result, I never got to meet the man, that I remember. He was murdered when I was about 10. Lies do hurt and eat away at the fabric of the family, but it does happen.... all the time. <br/>
<br/>
I have relayed the fact that most of you who were adopted have very positive feelings and experiences, and the family members I relayed it to are considering it. Hopefully it will work out, but there&#39;s only so much I can do. We&#39;ll all have to respect their decision, although I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;ll pass their lie on to my kids if they do decide to cover it up. Hopefully they won&#39;t notice anything amiss and won&#39;t ask. Thank you all who shared your experiences!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924449295">Well, I know I&#39;m not willing to risk ruining someone else&#39;s life by refusing to accept a decision they make as a family. I might not like it, but that doesn&#39;t give me the right to blackmail them about it - which I would be doing if I told them that I would tell my children their secret, if they decide to keep it a secret. I&#39;ll just hope the kids don&#39;t ask directly about it, they haven&#39;t so far with the others, but the others were all here before they were born. <br/>

Perhaps I didn&#39;t express myself clearly.  I am very well aware that many,<br/>
many people lie to their children and family members.  However, the post<br/>
asked what would you say to a parent choosing not to tell a child they were<br/>
adopted and I responded that I would ask them why they would base a<br/>
relationship on a lie.  I don&#39;t mean to imply that no relationships are<br/>
based on lies, only that it is a tremendous complication, one that endangers<br/>
the entire relationship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404251583">&quot;I&#39;m adopted, that statement sorta makes me feel &quot;less than&quot;. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know how on earth MY mother&#39;s feelings could make anyone feel &quot;less than&quot; on any level Glena.<br/>
My mother felt a certain way about her adopted children and that&#39;s not a statement, it&#39;s a fact. It shouldn&#39;t affect how any other adopted child feels anywhere in the whole wide world.<br/>
<br/>
Two of my siblings came at ages 9 and 11. I doubt you were adopted at either of those ages. They are Eskimo, my family is caucasion, it&#39;s pretty hard to NOT explain to inquiring people that they were adopted. Later, we adopted my brother at 2y.o., he&#39;s Athabaskan Indian. Our family, by the fact that we were culturally mixed, had obvious distinctions between the adopted and biological children.<br/>
None of us were treated any differently, we were all our parent&#39;s children. My folks didn&#39;t introduce them differently or act any  different towards them, but it was pretty obvious they didn&#39;t get in our family by birth!<br/>
It was after years and years of heartbreak, my mother watching her adopted children go through extremely destructive behavior, land in jail time and again (my brother), abusive relationships they chose and neglectful parenting of their own children (my neice and nephew are being raised by Grandparents on the other side of the family) and so much sad and terrible experiences that my mother decided she&#39;d done NOTHING to help these children and all the tons of hours and energy she&#39;d put into those children would have been better spent on her own.<br/>
I agree.<br/>
I still love my adopted siblings, although I rarely have contact due to their destructive lifestyles. I KNOW that my Mom would have been a better Mom, our lives more peaceful and happy had she not adopted.<br/>
I&#39;m still glad she did it. It was part of my journey and I do believe that it may have helped their lives in some way....even if it&#39;s just that they have a parent figure they love and can rely on to this day.<br/>
We have a special connection, my adopted siblings and I, even if it doesn&#39;t run as deep as my birth sibs only because of the age when they came.<br/>
We felt lovingly connected at my mother&#39;s death bed and in our hearts we are sisters forever. But there was so much heartbreak for my parents that goes on still today (for my Dad anyway), I totally understand why she felt that way.<br/>
<br/>
My dh is adopted too. I can tell you that being adopted at 4 months is a whole different world than being adopted at 11.  If you can&#39;t see that there is a different bond a parent makes with a child that is with them from birth, and a child that is half raised, then there&#39;s not much I can say to help you understand.<br/>
There WAS a difference between the adopted siblings and the birth siblings in our home. Not in authenticity, we were, and remain, a family. But to pretend like the cultural differences and the fact that they&#39;d been raised by other parents for part of their lives didn&#39;t exist would be nuts.<br/>

Not only is there often a physical and cultural differences, but the way most <br/>
&#39;older&quot; adopted children need to be PARENTED is VERY different than a child <br/>
who was raised from birth and firmly attached to their parents.  To bring an <br/>

<br/>
You know, I think that&#39;s where my parents made mistakes. They knew it later on...but at the time of adopting these children, they loved them so much and wanted them to be their very own children so bad, that they ignored the differences which ended up backfiring.<br/>
They tried to integrate my sisters into the household entirely, which was great in the love and nurture end of things, but disastrous in the religion/rules end. My oldest sister had so much anger and problems that came with her, and we never even entered counseling as a family.<br/>
I look back now and wonder what the heck my folks were thinking!<br/>
I really believe they thought love would heal everything, that, and a good dose of Jesus.<br/>
Our entire family should have been in counseling from the beginning. It might have prevented some of the later problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823900976">I haven&#39;t personally adopted any children but have some musings I&#39;ll share.<br/>
I&#39;ve read about people becoming anti adoption esp adoptees.  They say that<br/>
it&#39;s impossible to not feel that something is missing.  I&#39;ve thought it&#39;s so<br/>
easy to hang one&#39;s hat on such an issue.  We&#39;ve all got stuff to deal with<br/>
in our lives, each one of us and the human mind wants to find answers.  But<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that adoption is the answer to why one feels something is<br/>
missing.  So many of us at one time or another have felt that very same<br/>
thing.  It certainly could be in certain situations just as a lousy family<br/>
experience could be the reason for lots of personal troubles.<br/>
<br/>
The mother who regrets adopting a high need child and thought she should<br/>
have given her biological children more attention could easily be a mother<br/>
who had a bio child who had severe behavioral problems.  In her private<br/>
thoughts, she might think how she wished she had never had this child and<br/>
how it strained the rest of the family&#39;s life.  The mother who has only bio<br/>
kids doesn&#39;t get to have the easy answer that it was bc of an adoption.<br/>
There may certainly be lots more problems with adopting older children.<br/>
<br/>
The other thought I&#39;ve had about having children who aren&#39;t biologically<br/>
related to you is that you get to go beyond the idea that the bond of love<br/>
that one experiences is somehow tied to blood.  I think lots of parents and<br/>
children have that belief and I now think how limiting that is.  When your<br/>
family is not biologically related to you you can be freed from that and you<br/>
have an opportunity to have that  inform how you view the world.  There is<br/>
no &quot;reason&quot; for love.  It just is.  Many get to that place of understanding<br/>
but families who aren&#39;t biologically related I think, have that as a gift.<br/>
