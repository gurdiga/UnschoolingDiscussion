<div id="ygrps-yiv-661831654">Thanks, Jackie... Last summer he begged us to let him play t-ball.  Although <br/>
we were hesitant, we signed him up, and  he ended up  not participating much <br/>
at all.  We helped him by coaching first and third bases, even standing with <br/>
him at the  homeplate so that he would bat!!!  It just was something he could <br/>
not let him relax and do, and after about 4-5 games, we decided that we would <br/>
not continue.  Even though he would not play, and would not bat, he still <br/>
wanted to go, but we felt it was not in his best interest or ours, as we were <br/>
getting very frustrated with it all.  I have to say, honestly, that it was <br/>
embarrassing,too.  I felt like we were being judged by all of the other <br/>
parents, and it got to be so uncomfortable.  (Being very pregnant at the time <br/>
with all the hormones coursing through me, did not help, either :)  I am <br/>
really trying to handle things like this more confidently now, though, as I <br/>
realize that chances are he would have warmed up to the t-ball games, and <br/>
would have become less scared about participating, even if it took waiting <br/>
until the last game to see it possibly happen.  My feelings (and my dh&#39;s) got <br/>
the best of us, for sure!                                                       <br/>
