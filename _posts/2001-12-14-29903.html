<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316505462">We get up Christmas Eve a.m. and have a breakfast chosen by our birthday<br/>
girl.  Her dad always takes this day off.  After breakfast,  we usually play<br/>
a game,  then head to a local toy store that sends a &quot;key&quot; to the castle<br/>
every year.  DD gets to pick a gift from the birthday castle,  then another<br/>
gift of her choice (slim pickin&#39; most years!).  I get a weird kick from<br/>
seeing some frantic last minute shoppers dashing around crazily.    We used<br/>
to stop for lunch after at a playland place (which also sent b-day coupons),<br/>
but dd lost interest in that a few yrs ago.<br/>
    Late that afternoon we pack up and head to Grandma&#39;s for the Christmas<br/>
Eve get-together with the aunts, uncles and cousins from my side of the<br/>
family.  Usually get home late at night and sprinkle some &quot;reindeer food&quot; on<br/>
the lawn (a tradition started when dd went to preschool), and get to bed.<br/>
    Christmas day is relaxed,  at home, reading Christmas stories. We talk<br/>
about it being Jesus&#39; celebrated b-day (especially since dd&#39;s was the day<br/>
before). Dh cooks a nice meal,  we go to Mass.  And enjoy the day together.</div>
