<div id="ygrps-yiv-510241062">At some point, I remember reading that many kids (especially boys) aren&#39;t<br/>
ready for reading until at least 7 - 9 years old. Does anyone know where I<br/>
could find a reference for this information??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299257640">I think the best source of information on this aspect of learning are the<br/>
Moores, Raymond & Dorothy Moore.  I&#39;ve got several of their books but one<br/>
for your question is &quot;Better Late Than Early&quot;.  They have a web site:<br/>

<br/>
I hope this helps you.  I&#39;ve noticed with my kids dd 7 just decided she<br/>
wants to read & ds 4 isn&#39;t interested in letters, writing or reading.  So<br/>
I&#39;m waiting for him.  When I see a glimmer of interest I give him a taste<br/>
then back off.</div>
