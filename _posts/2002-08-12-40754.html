I emphatically agree. As John Holt tells us, the job of parenting is to give<br/>
children access to the world, and that doesn&#39;t mean the school world which<br/>
is totally artificial. Einstein is talking about freedom from what schools<br/>
do. Unschooling is the key, and it means Anything Except what schools do.<br/>
<br/>
Think of unschooling as letting your child&#39;s own life begin, in which the<br/>
child begins to take the reins and control his/her own learning. Unschooling<br/>
parents accept the truth that learning is happening all day, every day. We<br/>
accept that we cannot be aware, nor can even our children, of what is<br/>
entering their minds as &quot;learning&quot; and what is being filtered away.<br/>
<br/>
What we must do is trust that if we have provided them with tools and access<br/>
and the freedom to choose what interests them, we are doing the best we can.<br/>
