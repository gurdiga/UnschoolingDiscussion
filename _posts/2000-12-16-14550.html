is also an excellent author, and was married to Louise Erdrich, who writes<br/>
the forward for this book).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923884566">This is soooo strange!  I was nattering on another list <br/>
in a thread on testing in pregnancy and mentioned that <br/>
I was enjoying a glass of wine.  Turned out that FAS is <br/>
one listmember&#39;s bee-in-bonnet, and she mentioned the <br/>
film from this book!  doo-doo-doo-doo...<br/>
