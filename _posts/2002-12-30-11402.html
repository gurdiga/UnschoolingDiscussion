&lt;&lt;  My name is <br/>
Leslie and I met some of you at the conference in SC, except Sandra, of <br/>
course.  (Hope you are feeling better, Sandra!)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the progress, some not interesting at all, and some gross:<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday  morning I &quot;get the brace off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve slept without it for five nights.  VERY nice.   Then I was putting it on <br/>
when I would get up in the morning, but yesterday morning Keith (who HAD been <br/>
encouraging caution) talked me into trying to walk without it, just to the <br/>
toilet (not far, and on carpet).  It was scary but worked okay.  So this <br/>
morning I walked a long way before I found a warm place to sit and put the <br/>
brace on.  <br/>
<br/>
There are two incision-scars (I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called at this stage <br/>
of healing).  The one on the outside is straight and healed up quietly and <br/>
nicely.  The one on the inside of the ankle is curved (like an arc around the <br/>
heel) and doesn&#39;t feel good.  It&#39;s sensitive and for a while it was opened a <br/>
little and oozy/yucky.<br/>
<br/>
The brace doesn&#39;t hurt at all anymore.  I can zip around pretty well, and <br/>
walk on uneven ground.  I walked to Hollywood Video Thursday, a few hundred <br/>
yards.  I stayed on pavement, though.  The half-a-dozen kids who walked with <br/>
me only got ahead of me once.<br/>
<br/>
When I first got the brace I thought I&#39;d be walking quicker and better.  So <br/>
when they say &quot;take it off&quot; on Tuesday (which I figure they will, after they <br/>
see the x-rays), then I will probably put it right back on to walk out to the <br/>
car, and build up to walking without it gradually.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be able to drive.  Pushing the gas would be fine, but <br/>
the possibility of having to slam the brake on would not seem safe to me <br/>
right now.  I&#39;ll talk to them about that Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, my two boys are entrapped at Walmart with their friend Bret.  They <br/>
went to get an antenna for a radio, and Bret locked the keys in his truck.  <br/>
That wouldn&#39;t be so bad, except two other teens were waiting here at the <br/>
house to surprise Marty with a Playstation game one had bought used for him.  <br/>
(It&#39;s the same one Keith and I bought NEW for him, last night, but we have <br/>
the receipt--it&#39;s already giftwrapped, but Marty can open it tonight and then <br/>
we can take it back and get him a different game before his birthday on the <br/>
14th.)<br/>
<br/>
So...  a few phone calls back and forth, and the two here decided to go on to <br/>
another house and not wait.  That&#39;s good, because not only was Bret&#39;s mom <br/>
bringing extra keys from Stanley, NM (40  miles to the east).  The boys <br/>
decided to wait in Wendy&#39;s where it was warmer instead of getting my husband <br/>
to pick them up.   But before Bret&#39;s mom got there, somehow and for some <br/>
reason Kirby doesn&#39;t know (bomb threat, he thought he heard maybe) the entire <br/>
Walmart parking lot was closed.  This is a 24-hour super walmart, and Kirby <br/>
said there are police cars at every exit, not letting any cars in or out.  <br/>
Bret&#39;s mom walked in.  I asked if they wanted to walk out and get Keith to <br/>
pick them up, but they said they&#39;re having fun besieged at Wendy&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Bret will take them by Eric&#39;s house and Marty can get the happy surprise <br/>
gift, IF the police open the parking lot before long.  It&#39;s already 9:25 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
Unplanned adventures make the best memories.<br/>
I hope the police barricade doesn&#39;t have to do with any real harm to anyone, <br/>
though.<br/>

<br/>
Congrats on your mobility.  Are you going to physical therapy after the brace <br/>
is gone?  <br/>
<br/>
The oozing, by the way, cost me a couple rounds of antibiotics.  I had an <br/>
enormous blister under the cast and it&#39;s still healing. But it got infected <br/>
and oozed.  The first scab came off on Boxing Day - Holly would have loved <br/>
it, based on your description.  So, be prepared for that.<br/>
<br/>
And therapy is definately a yin-yang thing for me.  It hurts like hell and <br/>
then I get an ice pack with electrodes to reduce the swelling.  That part is <br/>
great.  I can be up half an hour now before needed to elevate.  And I can <br/>
walk fairly well without the crutches.  But I need them for stairs and scary <br/>
icy driveways.  My parents built their house on top of a sand dune.  It&#39;s <br/>
very steep and was very icy Christmas morning.  My sister broke her arm on <br/>
it.  I made it up on crutches with a few panic attacks.  Cars got stuck.  It <br/>
was ugly.  But it&#39;s amazing what you can do when you have to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been driving short bits.  Two miles to therapy or grocery store.  One of <br/>
our cars is a stick, it will be a long while before I can use a clutch.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be thinking of you on Tuesday.<br/>

also whether it can be done closer to my house than all the way at the main <br/>
hospital.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My parents built their house on top of a sand dune.  It&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
Ice and sand dunes would be mutually exclusive if the world were fair.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah?  I would have &quot;had to&quot; get someone else to carry me up or just go back <br/>
home!  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the educational soap opera here, folks, but thanks for the kind <br/>
thoughts.<br/>
Keith reminds me that I was really afraid to walk in the dark for a year or <br/>
so after I broke my leg in my pre-children days.  But before long I was <br/>
tromping along dangerously in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
The bad follow-on to that is that after a year or so, he expects I&#39;ll be <br/>
blithely and thoughtlessly heading down wet ramps.   Luckily, wet ramps are <br/>
way rarer than dark is.<br/>

Glad you are getting around better and keeping up with young bloods. You might<br/>
need some OT. How&#39;s your back feeling with all the stress? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are funny!  My brother brought a kid&#39;s saucer to drag me up the hill on, <br/>
but I felt strongly that if I were going to break my ankle again it would be <br/>
on my own power.  I&#39;m pretty big, the dune is pretty steep (You can&#39;t see the <br/>
top from the bottom) and there are trees all around.  Carrying me is not an <br/>
option.  But I did consider crawling up.<br/>
<br/>
Four kids between 3 and 5, by the way, calmly watched the new and old <br/>
Rudolph&#39;s while we were struggling with the dune.  Santa&#39;s gifts waited until <br/>
well after lunch time.<br/>
<br/>
My HMO make me go to the hospital for therapy, but it&#39;s only two miles from <br/>
my house.  All the therapists are really young and most of the patients are <br/>
not.  It&#39;s an interesting place.  I still have minimal calf muscle...<br/>
<br/>
I hope you get therapy.  They have already corrected some things I was doing <br/>
that could have brought on greater problems later.<br/>

<br/>
The only time my back has hurt was when I tried politely to be quiet for at <br/>
least eight hours when sleeping in my own real bed with Keith (as opposed to <br/>
on the couch, where I could get up and move around in the middle of the <br/>
night, or turn the light on and read a while).<br/>

took the casts off, the doctor was amazed at how fit her arms were. Seems <br/>
that the only two things she could do were to play the piano <br/>
constantly---which I don&#39;t particularly remember---and to bonk me and Johnny <br/>
(5) on the heads (because she couldn&#39;t use a belt or a switch on our behinds <br/>
or legs)---which I remember vividly.<br/>

She was anything but cute! <br/>

I have a pump organ.  No go with a broken leg.<br/>
<br/>
But I have a couple of times instructed Marty to &quot;Come over here and whack <br/>
your ass against my cast.&quot;  He declined to do so.<br/>

One day I farted, when I was in the wheelchair, and said to Holly, &quot;You have <br/>
the right to leave the room.&quot;  She said formally, &quot;I waive that right.&quot;<br/>
