going or not. My 6 yr old Catherine only refers to him as dad because her<br/>
sister does. Catherine was 1 when I left, she always screamed when he came<br/>
to pick them up. They spend more time with their stepmom then with him on<br/>
their weekends and I have suggested ending visitation since they seem to be<br/>

visits, I suggested that he sign over his rights and we could wipe the slate<br/>

child support again. I would still allow visits but it would be on the girls<br/>
terms. Suprisingly he said no. I feel this is a &gt;&gt;</div>
