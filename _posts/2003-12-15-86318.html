<div id="ygrps-yiv-700477778">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much Pam for your insight and wisdom on math. I love your <br/>
ideas because I don&#39;t realize sometimes that I do have some really <br/>
good &quot;real life&quot; situation right there in front of me.<br/>
<br/>
Gail I also was comforted by your reading readiness and your <br/>
encouragement to wait until later. My son is only 7 and so much <br/>
younger (playful) compared to most public school kids but yet so <br/>
much more mature in other ways (responsible) does this make sense to <br/>
anyone. He has older brothers that go to public school at their <br/>
mothers house and they sort of look like hey how come Joey doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to do all that stuff that we did in school. Joey doesn&#39;t know <br/>
any different so he doesn&#39;t care and he always says I love being <br/>
home schooled I play all day.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember who shared John Holt&#39;s philosophy on letters and <br/>
numbers but it was also comforting. When I ask Joey what time it is <br/>
on a digital clock he often says mom I&#39;m confused I can&#39;t tell the <br/>
difference between the 5 & 2.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way I was the one who started this whole idea on &gt; less than <br/>
&lt; greater than. I mentioned it as a reference to how Joey was <br/>
learing about his #&#39;s in a game of cards playing war. That is one of <br/>
the concepts in that game wich # is more or less. I just happened to <br/>
make a quick reference to how it was similar to what they do in <br/>
public schools(and how I always got confused on the symbol) with <br/>
those worksheets only we were doing it in an unschooling way. Who <br/>
knew the coversation would take the twist that it did. The <br/>
conversation grew and grew. Anyway we are unschoolers and we don&#39;t <br/>
have to worry about that stuff so lets not right ?? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. Absolutely. And, interestingly, this continues forever as far as I <br/>
can tell. My 19 yo and all her unschooled friends seem younger (playful <br/>
and creative and imaginative and -- hmm, just &quot;young&quot; in the best sense <br/>
of the word) and yet more mature and logical and sensible and competent <br/>
and self-assured than other kids their ages. I KNOW this because I am <br/>
lucky enough to spend a lot of time with both groups of young adults. I <br/>
teach college freshman at a community college - talked to and observed <br/>
hundreds of 18 to 25 year olds over the years.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids aren&#39;t perfect. They suffer from plenty of angst and <br/>
they get into drugs or bad relationships or eating disorders or <br/>
whatever. Probably in far smaller proportions than schooled kids, is my <br/>
guess, but still --- sometimes I feel the need to say this because <br/>
otherwise I sound like I think unschooling is a panacea to all of <br/>
life&#39;s problems.<br/>
<br/>
Could also be that people with a combination of playful and responsible <br/>
genetics are drawn to unschooling and it isn&#39;t unschooling that leads <br/>
to this apparent dichotomy. Maybe our kids would have been like this <br/>
even if they&#39;d been schooled. No telling. But I doubt it. At least <br/>
unschooling lets it all happen in a wonderful blossom of full <br/>
experience of life and not crammed into the constraints of schooling.<br/>

Mine too.  It&#39;s interesting to watch them make new friends, or in Kirby&#39;s <br/>
case it&#39;s interesting for me to hear comments about him &quot;behind his back&quot; from <br/>
people talking to me, or talking to each other.  He does two public things:  <br/>
works at a gaming shop, and teaches a kids&#39; karate class.  So sometimes people <br/>
see one aspect of him and think he will &quot;be like that,&quot; either they see him <br/>
being playful and courageously silly so they think he&#39;s a doof, OR they notice <br/>
that the adults around him give him a lot of responsibility so they think he&#39;ll <br/>
be very self-important and &quot;mature&quot; (in the &quot;I&#39;m too mature to smile or have <br/>
fun,&quot; bad way, where people are kind of faking maturity).<br/>
<br/>
Both ways, they&#39;re pleasantly surprised to see that he can move through a <br/>
whole range of &quot;ages.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s school that does that.  Third graders don&#39;t want to act like <br/>
second graders; juniors don&#39;t want to act like sophomores, and so they hold their <br/>
classmates to a very narrowly prescribed set of acceptable behaviors, and <br/>
they shun and shame those who won&#39;t go along.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s only ever been expected to be the best Kirby he could be.<br/>
