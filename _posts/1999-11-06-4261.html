<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109858285">How&#39;s that for a strange subject heading? <br/>
<br/>
Our homeschool theater group is doing a play set in the the 1920&#39;s.  I have <br/>
ten library books about that time period and can&#39;t find one picture of a <br/>
typical 1920&#39;s living room.  It&#39;s not the furniture so much, but the wall <br/>
treatment that I can&#39;t seem to find information about.  Would any of you have <br/>
any idea how a family in the 1920&#39;s would have painted their walls?  <br/>
Yesterday I went to B & N and looked in some books there.  I found some <br/>
pictures of that era and it looked like the walls had been done with a <br/>
&quot;wooly&quot;&quot;--that device that&#39;s sheepskin-like and that you daub over fresh <br/>
paint--but it&#39;s not possible to tell if that&#39;s just the way the photograph <br/>
looks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465495946">We rent an old, 1912 Edwardian house in Vancouver, B.C. There is very bold<br/>
wallpaper behind all of the radiators that was never painted over which was<br/>
obviously there before the radiators were installed.  The year that was done?<br/>
Don&#39;t know.  But I am curious.  In fact I think I will try to find out when the<br/>
radiators were installed.  If I had to guess maybe the forties.<br/>
<br/>
Our neighbor has restored his house which was built by the same builder in the<br/>
same year and he knows a lot more about it.  I&#39;ll ask.<br/>
