<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022505573">Just listening to Kodachrome, by Paul Simon.  In case u don&#39;t <br/>
know, it starts:<br/>
&#39;When I think back on all the crap I learned in High School<br/>
It&#39;s a wonder I can think at all.<br/>
And though my lack of education hasn&#39;t hurt me none,<br/>
I can read the writing on the wall...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I LIKE this sentiment!!<br/>
