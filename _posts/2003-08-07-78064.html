<br/>
Calling All Kids:  Wild Planet Combs the Country for Kid Inventors Kid<br/>
Inventor Challenge Turns Kids&#39; Ideas into Real Toys!<br/>
<br/>
(SAN FRANCISCO, May 2003) - No one knows more about toys than kids do -<br/>
it&#39;s their area of expertise!  Which is why every year, Wild Planet goes<br/>
straight to the source of toy ingenuity with Kid Inventor Challenge, the<br/>
contest that invites kids across the country to submit their ideas for<br/>
the coolest, most innovative playthings imaginable.<br/>
<br/>
Kid Inventor Challenge is open to kids ages 6-12 and has an annual<br/>
deadline of October 31- Halloween.  Kids enter by drawing, naming and<br/>
describing their toy idea and sending it to Wild Planet with their<br/>
parent or guardian&#39;s approval.  Whether entries arrive as part of a<br/>
class project, or as a solo submission, kids have the chance to win<br/>
great prizes and possibly have their idea turned into a real toy.<br/>
<br/>
One hundred winners will become Wild Planet toy consultants for one<br/>
year. This honor includes the responsibilities of being among the first<br/>
kids to play with new toys and receiving secret sneak peeks at products<br/>
before they are available to the public.  Kids get to keep all the toys<br/>
they review and are given other special Wild Planet prizes as initiation<br/>
to the Kid Inventor Team.<br/>
<br/>
The top 10 finalists are showered with the full range of Wild Planet<br/>
toys, and also act as kid consultants.  One of the top 10 winners will<br/>
earn the ultimate prize of having his or her idea turned into a real<br/>
toy, and will collect royalty checks for every unit sold for the life of<br/>
the product!<br/>
<br/>
Kid Inventor Challenge is Wild Planet&#39;s way of championing kids and<br/>
exemplifying that kids&#39; ideas are important and their opinions matter -<br/>
especially when it comes to toys!  By engaging kids in the &quot;how-to&quot;<br/>
process of toy development, from brainstorming and design to prototypes<br/>
and promotion, kids get to see how a toy grows from an idea into a<br/>
product. They dabble in mathematics, problem solving, and writing along<br/>
the way and learn that subjects such as geography, science and language<br/>
are involved in the making of toys.<br/>
<br/>
Accompanied by a corresponding curriculum that helps educators and<br/>
parents guide kids through each step of toy invention, Kid Inventor<br/>
Challenge is a hands-on tool for learning, teaching and inventing at<br/>
home or in school. Plus, it&#39;s tons of fun!<br/>
<br/>
Wild Planet received thousands of entries in last year&#39;s Kid Inventor<br/>
Challenge, and is expecting an increase in submissions for the 2003<br/>
contest. Beginning July 15, entry forms (and curriculum) can be<br/>
downloaded for free<br/>
at www.kidinventorchallenge.com.   All entries must be mailed by Friday,<br/>
October 31, 2003, to:<br/>
