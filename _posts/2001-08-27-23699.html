<div id="ygrps-yiv-487559396">I am not sure how to post a message on here but here I go. Has anyone had unschooled kids that went to college? Did they feel they had the skills needed to do the work required? I have a 17 year old who will be starting a few music classes at our local city college. I just dont know if he will be prepared for the heavy work load expected of him.<br/>

You can mix the tempra with glue - or they also make a<br/>
special medium- <br/>
try- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.discountschoolsupply.com">http://www.discountschoolsupply.com</a> <br/>
then you cut shapes out of construction paper, say a<br/>
butterfly, cut the inside out of the shape (so you<br/>
only have the outline of the butterfly and some<br/>
interior dividers to separate colors) put the shape on<br/>
a surface glue won&#39;t stick to (like plastic or foil)<br/>
fill the open areas with glue, let dry, and it is sort<br/>
of &#39;stained glass&#39; looking. This works best with small<br/>
shapes. Discount school supply sells molds for this<br/>
too; and if you order their paper catalog it has lots<br/>
of suggestions for this sort of thing along the bottom<br/>
of most pages.<br/>

Subject: Re: child be off with you<br/>
<br/>
It really does amaze me how many people I know (who<br/>
wouldn&#39;t need the money if not for the 3 or 4<br/>
vacations a year (without the kids!), the house with a<br/>
3 room master bedroom suite, etc.) who put their<br/>
children in daycare 10 hours a day starting at 6 weeks<br/>
old. My neighbor has a 2yo grandson my 2yo loves to<br/>
play with, but she doesn&#39;t get much chance because<br/>
he&#39;s in daycare 10 hours a day M-F. I heard his<br/>
mother and grandmother in their pool the other day and<br/>
yelled over to ask if Elysian & Jay could play (here<br/>
or there) and they said he wasn&#39;t there, his mother<br/>
wanted a day off to go swimming so she had dropped him<br/>
at day care! Didn&#39;t it occur to them that maybe Jay<br/>
would have wanted a day to swim rather than spend<br/>
another 10 hour day in a daycare - and didn&#39;t she miss<br/>
him?<br/>

Twana, where is it you live? If my memory serves you&#39;re up near Tampa...<br/>
Well, it takes me, from Venice, about 60 minutes to get to the airport up<br/>
there....about 90 to (almost) Tarpon springs (there is a great weaving store<br/>
up there). Throw is some ignorant drivers, rainy weather, and make a stab<br/>
at your time... St. Pete takes about an hour too.<br/>

I will send you that umbrella info. ;)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hello everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I suppose it&#39;s time to introduce myself. I am Twana<br/>
&gt;and live in Central Florida (Bushnell) and I unschool<br/>
&gt;my 5 and 8 year old sons. I have searched everywhere<br/>
&gt;for a group that supports my beliefs of unschooling and<br/>
&gt;have found nothing until this one. I have emailed some<br/>
&gt;of the memeber in South FL and have gotten welcoming<br/>
&gt;responses. I would like to come down sometime for some<br/>
&gt;events, but need to find out how long it will take me<br/>
&gt;to get there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can someone please tell me why everytime I go to my<br/>
&gt;email (unfortunately only about once a week) I have<br/>
&gt;about 400 messages...uuuuggggg we have a slow<br/>
&gt;connection. Help :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mercedes...I am very interested in the umbrella you<br/>
&gt;talk about...please email me more info. I am also<br/>
&gt;interested in the Yearbooks as well as the Book It<br/>
&gt;program, the equinox get together, and the Camping<br/>
&gt;Trip...please let me know about them all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, now that I&#39;ve written a book, it&#39;s nice to be a<br/>
&gt;part of the unschooling family...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks so much<br/>
&gt;Twana<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stories of what hurt children in school are truly,<br/>

&gt; have made them a special <br/>

&gt; And as a teacher I <br/>
&gt; inevitably contributed to those kinds of failure<br/>
&gt; moments. Usually I tried to <br/>
&gt; do what I knew was right, but people get tired and<br/>
&gt; grouchy, and there are <br/>
&gt; grades required by the state, and some people sleep<br/>
&gt; through and get A&#39;s and <br/>
&gt; some try hard and get C&#39;s.<br/>

We use everything. Lint from the dryer (when I<br/>
actually use it...after a week or two of rain),<br/>
leaves, grass, hay, flowers (pressed,dried, copied)<br/>
feathers,pine needles, palmetoes,beads (made from<br/>
everything....even plastic drinking straws and<br/>
washers...anything with a hole in it, or that you can<br/>
put a hole in, shells, rags (quilts, rugs, doll<br/>
clothes, toy animals, pockets, bags, on and on),<br/>
recycled paper (free note pads...just cut off the<br/>
printed part, paper mache&#39;, weaving, drawing, make cut<br/>
out shapes from, save really nice pictures from 3rd<br/>
class mail) old boxes, milk jugs, all bottles, most<br/>
cans, rocks, dirt, mud, clay,charcole, DH tobacco<br/>
lids.....And do you belive we STILL have trash to<br/>
dump!!! No food type trash though! That all gets used<br/>
for the critters...then composted...one way or<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun!! Art supplies are the only thing that are<br/>
cheap!! It really is rewarding to make something from<br/>
nothing...beauty from chaos...<br/>

authors, though it&#39;s too bad they felt the need to include the part about<br/>
mothers. They could have left that part out. I&#39;ve thought about writing<br/>
a note to the authors to point out that the passage quoted sounded<br/>
exactly like school! Other than that, I think it is a book worth<br/>

Subject: Haiku<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s the origin of Haiku? Can anyone tell me.<br/>
&gt;Mercy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Haiku is Japanese poetry and is very old - derived from a more<br/>
fundamental form of poetry called Tanka. Tanka is traditionally thirty<br/>
one syllables ( 5-7-5-7-7 )<br/>
<br/>
Some very famous Japanese Haiku poets are Matsuo Basho (1644-1694? ) <br/>
Taniguchi Buson (1715-1783 ) and Issa (1762-1826 ) There is another , a<br/>
student of Basho , named Kikaku about whom I know nothing: and Masaoka<br/>
Shiki a later Haiku poet whose works I have never read. <br/>
There is a book called &quot; A Few Flies and I ; Haiku by Issa &quot; by Jean<br/>
Merrill. <br/>
<br/>
An example of Haiku by Issa<br/>
<br/>
If you are tender to them <br/>
The young sparrows<br/>
Will poop on you.<br/>
<br/>
No, I didn&#39;t just make that up. If it doesn&#39;t follow the 5-7-5 pattern<br/>
it is because of the translation from the original Japanese. <br/>

My son had asked for karate lessons a year before we found the<br/>
instructor we liked.<br/>
We went into it completely ignorant of martial arts. We were lucky to<br/>
find such an amazing instructor.<br/>
You should attend a few classes without your boys, if you can. Watch to<br/>
see if the older kids use self control when sparring with the younger<br/>
kids. Do they have protective gear for the little kids. Does the<br/>
instructor stress the point of self control? Is one of the rules of the<br/>
dojo respect? How do the students treat each other? How is the<br/>
instructor with the other kids your boy&#39;s ages? Do girls and boys spar<br/>
each other? If not there may be and unconscious ( or not ) feeling by<br/>
the instructor that girls are not able to fight as well as boys, etc. and<br/>
do you want your boys to get this message? Your observations will tell<br/>
you more than I ever could. If you feel good about the teacher and feel<br/>
he/she genuinely likes and respects the kids, then he/she&#39;s the one.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of martial arts, The harmonious development and eventual<br/>
perfection of human character.<br/>
<br/>
I was worried that my unschooling kid would have a hard time with a<br/>
regimented class. <br/>
He didn&#39;t . The hardest thing for him to remember was to raise his hand<br/>
before asking or answering a question, and having to ask to use the<br/>
restroom.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s possible that the school wouldn&#39;t take kids who hadn&#39;t willingly visited <br/>
and signed up themselves. Where Kirby goes, the kids have to sign an <br/>
agreement concerning behavior and intent. They won&#39;t take a child against <br/>
the child&#39;s will (so they wouldn&#39;t be able to sell gift memberships to <br/>
not-yet-members/students).<br/>
<br/>
Some schools stress tournaments and competitions and others don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Some are more interested in character building than in butt-kicking.<br/>
<br/>
I would say without even leaving the house you could read the ads in the <br/>
yellow pages--how do the schools present themselves? You&#39;ll note differences <br/>
right away.<br/>
<br/>
You could look on line for overall descriptions of the philosophies of <br/>
different associations. Many times local schools are affiliated with one or <br/>
another national or international association.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a local martial-arts supply house in town (like a store that <br/>
sells gear for the different sports) you might ask the purveyor (who is <br/>
likely also a martial arts teacher) about the differences in the types of <br/>
martial arts.<br/>
<br/>
One thing you could do as it&#39;s a gift would be to promise to pay for lessons <br/>
and a good uniform. In some schools you can get the basic cheap uniform <br/>
which will be cotton/polyester blend, or you can opt for a better all-cotton <br/>
uniform.<br/>

Subject: Menu for dinners<br/>
<br/>
Hi all you Mommies out there!<br/>
Every week I make a menu for dinners for the week and then make my<br/>
grocery list. (don&#39;t think I&#39;m miss organization, &#39;cause I&#39;m very far<br/>
from it) Anyway......each Sunday night I am trying to finish filling in<br/>
the menu with something interesting and that my kids will eat.<br/>
So.....(to make a long story short) I keep thinking...I&#39;m sure there<br/>
are other Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s out there struggling with sort of the same<br/>
dilemma.<br/>
I&#39;d love to compile recipes shared by all of us of our most successful<br/>
recipes, meals, snacks ect.... It would be nice to maybe add this to<br/>
the unschooling site, but maybe this is really not unschooling, but then<br/>
what isn&#39;t. Or, I would just like to compile a recipe book of<br/>
favorites.<br/>
Would anyone like to share recipes? Maybe an email list of recipe<br/>
sharers....easys, quick recipes that is.... :)<br/>
I mean we have to spend hours making legos ya know.... ;)<br/>

I don&#39;t know how many of you have read Dick King-Smith, but we love him<br/>
here. We read Babe, and loved it much more than the movie (which was<br/>
too sad and scary for my kids).<br/>
We just finished reading &quot;Sophie&#39;s Snail&quot;, and really loved it. Sophie<br/>
is wonderful. If you love nature and exploring the garden, and kids and<br/>
their honest way of being, you will love Sophie.<br/>
Just wanted to share.....<br/>
We also love Mr. Ape. This was wonderful.<br/>

Oh I forgot....I&#39;m always doing that..... ha, ha<br/>
Spider Sparrow by Dick King-Smith is soooo wonderful. We listened to it<br/>
on tape. The kids and I loved it! Sad at the end, but my kids are good<br/>
at sad parts in books, not in the movies.<br/>
