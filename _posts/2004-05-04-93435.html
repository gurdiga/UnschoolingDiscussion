<div id="ygrps-yiv-54979961">Hello to everyone. I haven&#39;t been around for awhile. I needed to go <br/>
away and see if I could unschool and parent peacefully and also to <br/>
try and answer the many questions that were swirling about in my head <br/>
about life, the universe and everything! Okay, so I&#39;m still working <br/>
on the questions but I CAN unschool and since I finished reading How <br/>
To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk I&#39;m finding <br/>
the peaceful parenting much easier. It seems a lifetime since we <br/>
began this journey and walked away from homeschooling and <br/>
controlling/spanking our kids, I can&#39;t believe it hasn&#39;t even been <br/>
two years!<br/>
<br/>
Life has been pretty good lately. We are enjoying the autumn weather <br/>
after a long, hot, dry summer. (We live in Australia for those who <br/>
don&#39;t know me) We have been enjoying great conversations, rereading <br/>
the Lemony Snicket series, making chocolate cakes, growing stuff in <br/>
the garden and making messes with paint and glue. Today we did some <br/>
charcoal drawings of a zebra&#39;s head and they look awesome.<br/>
<br/>
My boys watched Arthur today and it was about penpals. So of course <br/>
they both decided they wanted a penpal. We&#39;ve written down some of <br/>
their interests in the hope that someone (or two someones) out there <br/>
would be interested in writing to them on a regular basis. You can <br/>
contact me offlist if you are. TIA<br/>
<br/>
Jacob is eight this year and loves Harry Potter and reading the <br/>
Lemony Snicket series. He loves playing with Lego and his Bionicles. <br/>
His favourite superheroes are Spiderman, Wolverine and Hulk. His <br/>
favourite movie is Spiderman (he&#39;s looking forward to the new movie) <br/>
and his favourite Tv show at the moment is Corniel and Bernie. <br/>
He loves collecting insects and has 3 pet caterpillars. He likes <br/>
playing outside and is digging a big pit to play in and fill up with <br/>
water. He also likes drawing and cooking.<br/>
<br/>
Jesse is ten in three weeks. He loves Harry Potter too and can&#39;t wait <br/>
until Pisoner of Azkaban is released. He is hoping to get some LOTR <br/>
figurines from the Battle Games in Middle-earth series for his <br/>
birthday. His dad is also collecting them and they plan to paint them <br/>
together and build a landscape to battle on. Jess likes playing <br/>
outside pretending to be characters from movies like the Lord of the <br/>
Rings and Hulk. His favourite movie is Bionicle: Mask of Light. He <br/>
loves playing with Lego and his Bionicles. His favourite TV show is <br/>
The Wild Thornberrys. He loves watching nature documentaries and <br/>
wants to be the next David Attenborough. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to attempt to start receiving mail again. I need a Time <br/>
Turner. The days are just not long enough to get everything done.<br/>
