<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743779281">&lt;Brianna is my child, my life. How can I hit her?/ How can I hurt her? &gt;<br/>
I dont know how any parent can hit their child, or justify it. I know that in a society that is so violent it happens quite frequently and it is very distressing to me. I would think (and I know I am new) from what I have read and from being on this list serve for a few months now, that spanking would kind of go against the philosophies of unschooling. If you are spanking your kid, you cannot be trusting that they are doing what they need to do at any given moment. The trust relationship, as a whole is now out the window, as they look to us to love them, to nurture them and to not resort to violence at any time, ever. I don&#39;t know, I just don&#39;t see the justification, ever. I have worked with abusive parents, however, and abusive parents and spanking parents come in all different shapes and sizes, not just Christian ones.   Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771705319">Very well said! I recall, once, during severe PMS; no money; problems w/ Brianna&#39;s mom (my daughter) - I yelled at Brianna for a good (or terrible) 4 - 5 minutes. I yelled that I didn&#39;t need the pressure of raising another kid. <br/>
The look on her face will be with me forever.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I really raise my voice now is when I/m calling her . It&#39;s much better for both of us.<br/>
