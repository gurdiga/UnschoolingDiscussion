<div id="ygrps-yiv-571749879"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Subject: Re: Conference/Frank Smith<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Much has been said lately on this list about a conference where one of the<br/>
headliners was Frank Smith. He has long been on the scene as a critic of the<br/>
government education system, and he is the author of a book that gave Luz<br/>
and me much inspiration for unschooling in the 1980s. The book is called,<br/>
  <br/>
  &quot;Insult to Intelligence&quot; It was published in 1986 by Arbor House in NY.<br/>
<br/>
As some of you know, Mr. Smith (born in England, educated in Australia with<br/>
a PhD from Harvard) is an internationally known researcher in teaching, and<br/>
an accomplished writer, poet and journalist, and professor of education.<br/>
<br/>
Smith was among the first &quot;heavy-hitters&quot; to attack the education<br/>
establishment for many of the same reasons that we unschoolers reject it<br/>
today -- pointing out that drills, testing, and grading of students are an<br/>
every day insult to the intelligence of both students and teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have taken his criticisms seriously, and now see that the<br/>
government&#39;s &quot;false theories&quot; (as he calls them) of education are merely the<br/>
tip of the iceberg that the bureaucratic monopoly of schooling has become.<br/>
His contribution was important to us because it fortified the work of John<br/>
Holt, James Herndon and others and helped to establish the validity of<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Smith ends his book with this sentence: &quot;The responsibility of the present<br/>
generation of adults is to ensure that the brains of the future generation<br/>
are not destroyed on today&#39;s classrooms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it were not for men like Smith, we (on this list) might not yet know<br/>
about unschooling, but might still have our children in places where what he<br/>
calls a &quot;travesty of teaching&quot; is offered as the real thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d bet it&#39;s a rare unschooler -- even factoring in the number who heard him<br/>
at the conference -- who&#39;s even heard of Frank Smith. I think the only<br/>
reason people here knew him was Pam Sorooshian kept recommending his Book of<br/>
Learning and Forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
(If you enter Frank Smith and unschooling into Google it turns up 26 hits.<br/>
If you subtract out the conference it turns up 12. John Holt turns up 1380<br/>
and 699.)<br/>
<br/>
Though some unschoolers are interested in the process of learning, most,<br/>
once they get past their personal experiences with the education system,<br/>
aren&#39;t much interested in it. It really has nothing to do with helping a<br/>
child learn in an unschooling way.<br/>
<br/>
You said yourself, Ned, now that your son has graduated from college, you&#39;ve<br/>
moved on in your thinking. Please respect the fact that the people on this<br/>
list still have kids and we need to be where we are for our kids which is<br/>
focusing on the part of unschooling that you say there isn&#39;t much to say<br/>
about. Well we *do* find a lot to say about it. (To the tune of 41,900+<br/>
posts in 3 1/2 years.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope those who are interested in Ned&#39;s views of the education system will<br/>
also join the other lists he&#39;s on that Helen posted.<br/>

<br/>
That was the first homschooling conference he had ever attended.  Laura <br/>
Derrick pressed the book on LOTS of people, for which she deserves a lot of <br/>
credit. &lt;g&gt;  Laura and Pam  really pushed me to read it and GAVE me a copy, <br/>
three or four years ago, I think.<br/>
<br/>
But even John Holt was writing to educators, and it&#39;s in studying education <br/>
and learning and alternative education that people came to John Holt before <br/>
Growing Without Schooling and Teach Your Own were available.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, it&#39;s not an us and them situation with a clear &quot;us&quot; and an evil <br/>
&quot;them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think balance and non-duality are important things for unschoolers to have <br/>
if they want their children to live in the real, honest world instead of in a <br/>
politically charged fringe world.<br/>
