<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628930347">This has been an interesting discussion.  I have a 33 month old and am new<br/>
to homeschooling, and we&#39;ve been subscribed to this unschooling list for<br/>
several months.  This is the first thread I have followed.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious what ages your children were when most of you started<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;, however each of you may define it.  Some of the comments I&#39;ve<br/>
read lately tend to be what I guess are the &quot;purist&quot; unschooler&#39;s thoughts.<br/>
I&#39;m referring to the comments about zilcho curriculum,  no teaching allowed,<br/>
exclusive child led learning, etc.  I have difficulty seeing how these could<br/>
be so zealotously (a word?) applied to young children, and even a certain<br/>
extent, to teenagers.  For example:<br/>
<br/>
1) Foreign languages are most easily learned and absorbed when we are quite<br/>
young (under 6 years).  If I waited for my child to ask me about that, well,<br/>
she really doesn&#39;t have enough information to think of that question, not to<br/>
mention difficulty just formulating a sentence.  I think she would have<br/>
missed out on that opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
2)  My daughter wanted to stay and play in one of the toy cabinets today<br/>
when I had a need to get the dog to the veterinarian for her shots.  I was<br/>
pulling her away from her cabinet and her desires to learn and play at that<br/>
instant.  I was doing the leading, she the following.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Occasionally my daughter wants to keep doing what she&#39;s doing, when<br/>
we&#39;re outside say, in the sunshine, or in the mosquito prime time.  Should I<br/>
follow her lead and let her get sunburned or eaten alive by mosquitoes, or<br/>
deal with her crying and dissapointment because I have deemed it is in her<br/>
best interest.<br/>
<br/>
I think I understand how such a thread has arisen, and I imagine many are<br/>
reacting against our society&#39;s tendency to *not* respect the child.  I would<br/>
just add, that a child is a child, and requires supervision, teaching,<br/>
mentoring--whatever word you want to choose.  (I have no &quot;negative&quot; reaction<br/>
to the word &quot;teaching.&quot;  I have had a number of teachers from the past that<br/>
I remember postively and am grateful they were in my life.) Just by virtue<br/>
of the fact you have chosen to homeschool and unschool, you have dictated<br/>
*to a certain extent* how your child will view and interact with the world.<br/>
Parents make choices every day, even prenatal choices that affect the child.<br/>
It can&#39;t be helped!  It&#39;s called the environment.  No one can escape it<br/>
completely.  Give yourselves a break!<br/>
<br/>
I am curious, where it is written what the &quot;general consensus&quot; on<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; is?  And where is the list of right words, and wrong words to<br/>
use regarding such?  This thread has led me to believe it is always in<br/>
process and quite diverse--and that&#39;s just fine with me!<br/>
<br/>
Last comment, stolen from my husband&#39;s lips.  You can&#39;t teach linear algebra<br/>
or Calculus from cooking.  You&#39;re going to need some semblance of a<br/>
curriculum for such things.<br/>
<br/>

an extension of our lives before they were here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t that teaching &quot;isn&#39;t allowed&quot;, it&#39;s that it simply doesn&#39;t happen<br/>
that way.  There isn&#39;t a need for me to present information in a teaching<br/>
way.    There aren&#39;t things that I feel I need to be the authority on,<br/>
there isn&#39;t information that I&#39;m the only source of, and in general, I have<br/>
no stake in whether information I share is absorbed at that time or not.<br/>
If they asked me to teach them something, I might try to do that, but that<br/>
isn&#39;t what they ask.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to wait for your child to ask, and sit there doing nothing<br/>
until that time.  I truly do not understand where people get that from.<br/>
Modeling is possibly the most important ting about unschooling- doing<br/>
interesting and fun things yourself so that your children naturally see<br/>
lfie as fun and interesting stuff to learn about.<br/>
<br/>
You could learn the language yourself, and practice with family members.<br/>
You might listen to tapes, watch videos, take lessons, invite a native<br/>
speaker to your house, use a book, watch movies in that language, read<br/>
children&#39;s books in that language, go somewhere that language is spoken,<br/>
etc.  If *you* are interested in learning a language and are happily doing<br/>
these things, your child may get interested.  If they don&#39;t get interested,<br/>
they at least know that the possibility exists- isn&#39;t that what you were<br/>
conerned about, that they wouldn&#39;t know to ask about it?<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t interested in learning a lanugage, I don&#39;t see why it would<br/>
be so important to you that your child do so.  If you are interested, then<br/>
your learning will be plenty to bring it to your child&#39;s attention.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be very odd for a child living in a learning environment<br/>
to reach the age of six not knowing of the existence of different<br/>
languages, and therefore having the opportunity to express an interest.<br/>

accepted definition, since he coined the word.  His definition changed as<br/>
he educated himself, so be aware that he uses the word differently at<br/>
different times, and it has further evolved since then.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Last comment, stolen from my husband&#39;s lips.  You can&#39;t teach linear algebra<br/>
&gt; or Calculus from cooking.  You&#39;re going to need some semblance of a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, my very favorite argument!!!  Why do people always pick algebra and<br/>
calculus for this &quot;but you need a curriculum for these&quot; aregument?  It<br/>
never fails. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You *DO NOT NEED* a curriculum to learn algebra.  Algebra is the most fun<br/>
thing in the world, if people are left to enjoy it rather than become<br/>
aggravated by an attempt to box and drill and kill it.<br/>
<br/>
There are many, many ways to learn about math and mathematical concepts<br/>
without someone else&#39;s curriculum.  Where did algebra and calculus come<br/>
from in the first place?  From people who were interested in how things<br/>
work, who took the time to play with stuff and discover patterns and ways<br/>
to understand it.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing about algebra is that what it is is two things:<br/>
figuring out what you know, what you want to know, and how to use the first<br/>
to figure out the second. And, most fun and more importantly, it&#39;s *playing<br/>
with numbers* and their relationships with each other.  You can play<br/>
however you like, move them around, change them, do all sorts of things,<br/>
and if you do that with an understanding of their relationships and how<br/>
they work, things will maintain their relationships, and you can use all<br/>
that playing around to fiddle stuff into whatever form makes you the most<br/>
happy, and therefore, is easiest for you to work with.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all it is.  Not memorizing formulas.  Not frustrating.  Fun.  Using<br/>
your understanding of numbers and number theory and relationships to make<br/>
things the way you want them, so you can use them to get real, useful<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
A curriculum might be helpful for folks who don&#39;t have a clue where to<br/>
start playing, if they&#39;ve had that playing with numbers instinct removed<br/>
somehow.  But people without math phobias will naturally play around with<br/>
stuff enough to find it very cool and interesting and fascinating (unless,<br/>
of course, they simply aren&#39;t inclined that way, in which case, they aren&#39;t<br/>
likely to end up needing to know anyway).  We do huge amounts of thinking<br/>
and talking and playing and exploring around here that involve things that<br/>
could be called algebra or calculus, but we have no need to call them that,<br/>
or call them anything, or categorize them, we just use them.  Lots of<br/>
physics stuff and music stuff and art stuff.  Cooking is often mentioned as<br/>
a way to play with math, but it is by far not the only one.<br/>

I thought this list was new just a couple of weeks ago.<br/>
Are you confusing it with another unschooling list or was I just not invited <br/>
to be a charter member!?  :-0<br/>

<br/>
A child is a person.  There are adults I mentor too.  I advise them on their <br/>
behavior and moods.  I have to put sunscreen on my husband.  I talk my sister <br/>
through social situatons sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
Children need more basic advice sometimes, but when you can explain to them <br/>
why it&#39;s time to go or why they need to wait until after mosquito-hour, <br/>
they&#39;re in on the decision too and you haven&#39;t made it for them.  If I can <br/>
convince a friend of mine to do something really useful for someone that she <br/>
might not have thought of on her own, I didn&#39;t MAKE her do it, although I <br/>
might have suggested it or inspired her to do it.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t homeschool my children against their will.  It wasn&#39;t dictated to <br/>
them.  If one of them really wanted a formal curriculum, I&#39;d buy one.  I <br/>
would not myself direct that use of that, but I&#39;d certainly explain what they <br/>
didn&#39;t understand and answer questions.  I wouldn&#39;t be the one saying &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
8:00, do math&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s test day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Last comment, stolen from my husband&#39;s lips.  You can&#39;t teach linear algebra<br/>
or Calculus from cooking.  You&#39;re going to need some semblance of a<br/>
curriculum for such things.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s a math guy.  <br/>
So where in life to linear algebra and calculus live?  That is where they <br/>
will be found.   <br/>
And why would a person want to learn them?  That is when they will be learned <br/>
easily--when the learner has the need or desire because of goals or plans.  <br/>
<br/>
Many things are taught too early in school, because schools want to compete <br/>
with one another and dazzle people and impress parents and school boards.  It <br/>
has been said that all of 13 years of school could be learned in 18 months by <br/>
a teenager.  No way does it take 13 years.  Much of the purpose of school is <br/>
babysitting--isolating children away from working adults and those who <br/>
childless folk who just want six hours of quiet every day while kids are <br/>
incarcerated elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
And when in public school is calculus taught?  Usually not until college.  <br/>
And if you have a young teen interested in higher math, college courses will <br/>
be available to him and you won&#39;t have to learn to teach differential <br/>
equations.<br/>

My children were newborn when I started unschooling them.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
know then it was called unschooling though.  I did &quot;nothing&quot; except<br/>
provide a rich and varied and safe environment for them.  They learned<br/>
to walk and talk in their own time and on their own schedule.  I<br/>
did fret some -- Megan was a late walker (16 mos) and Alex is a late<br/>
talker.  My fretting consisted of talking to their father about it<br/>
and both of us concluding that they were fine, just a bit later<br/>
than &#39;average&#39;.  Megan learned to use a toilet when she was a little<br/>
over 3; Alex isn&#39;t interested now -- he showed some interest<br/>
at 18 mos. but then decided he had other things to do!!<br/>
<br/>
I do not ever envision using a curriculum.  To me a curriculum is<br/>
a prescribed course of study outlined by someone other than the<br/>
party(parties) involved.  If Megan came to me and told me she<br/>
wanted to be a rocket scientist, then we probably would sit down<br/>
and discuss the important disciplines needed to succeed in that<br/>
field.  To me that isn&#39;t a curriculum; we probably would use<br/>
textbooks as reference material.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand your confusion at all on applying unschooling<br/>
to a younger child.  It seems quite natural to me.  I didn&#39;t &#39;teach&#39;<br/>
them to walk, I didn&#39;t drill them, I didn&#39;t give them exercises to<br/>
do.  I did create a safe space so when they desired they could attempt<br/>
it; I did give them praise and encouragement when they succeeded and<br/>
I consoled them when they fell down! For me unschooling is maintaining<br/>
that type of environment for all kinds of learning.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do think modeling this is the most important aspect.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
where you live but could you use another language in your day to day<br/>
living?  When I lived in Switzerland in the 80s, I knew several <br/>
families where Mom spoke one language to the children, Dad another<br/>
one.  But in Switzerland one could get TV channels in 3 languages<br/>
and many people were multilingual.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>These are more general parenting concerns that specifically unschooling.<br/>
For me with young children, one of my biggest responsibilities is to<br/>
provide a safe environment.  They don&#39;t understand that a fall from a<br/>
chair could hurt or that playing in the street could really hurt them.<br/>
Sometimes they may get upset the activity can&#39;t continue and I try<br/>
to explain to them why it can&#39;t and I empathize with their anguish.<br/>
But they still can&#39;t play in the street!!!<br/>

Linear algebra and calculus would be hard to learn from cooking but<br/>
not from other life experiences.  Please recall my definition of<br/>
curriculum from above.  I also don&#39;t plan on teaching (we may<br/>
have different definitions of that word) those subjects to my<br/>
children.  If they want to learn them, fine and I will provide<br/>
resources -- including my own textbooks and recollections of the<br/>
subjects; if not, that&#39;s fine too.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I readily recognize that I am at the radical end of the<br/>
unschooling spectrum.<br/>

<br/>
I believe this is less true than people like to believe.  In my experience, <br/>
the longer people unschool the closer their answers become, because there are <br/>
underlying principles about how learning happens IF it is left to happen <br/>
naturally.   Until people let go and let it happen, they make assumptions <br/>
about natural learning, and those assumptions differ more widely than the <br/>
descriptions of experienced &quot;radical unschoolers&quot; do.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day I said (here or somewhere) that I had been unschooling for <br/>
seven years.  It&#39;s eight.  I was counting Kirby as though he would have just <br/>
finished sixth grade, but it was pointed out to me that he would have just <br/>
finished seventh.  See?  I don&#39;t even keep track of what grade he would be <br/>
in.  <br/>
<br/>
Because kindergarten is required here, I count unschooling from the time he <br/>
would have gone to kindergarten.  I don&#39;t count before then because although <br/>
I wasn&#39;t using a curriculum and my children were home and learning, I wasn&#39;t <br/>
doing anything I wouldn&#39;t have been doing if they had been going to public <br/>
school at the age of five.   When someone&#39;s absolutely planning to put their <br/>
kids in school, I don&#39;t consider them to be homeschooling before that point.  <br/>
They&#39;re just living with pre-schoolers.  It may look just exactly the same as <br/>
those who intend NOT to send their kids to school, but I just can&#39;t bring <br/>
myself to say I&#39;ve been unschooling for twelve years just because Kirby&#39;s <br/>
nearly thirteen.<br/>
<br/>
Now with Holly, perhaps it&#39;s different.  She had two older brothers and one <br/>
was definitely NOT in school, and soon neither was in school, although we had <br/>
figured Marty might want to go (he didn&#39;t when the time came).  So Holly was <br/>
big in the midst of an unschooling family and to consider her an unschooler <br/>
from the beginning makes more sense.<br/>

want to count my dog and horse experience. I&#39;ll leave that up to you.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m referring to the comments about zilcho curriculum,  no teaching allowed,<br/>
&gt;exclusive child led learning, etc. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe some do, but I&#39;ve never viewed unschooling as a no teaching allowed <br/>
thing.  Maybe a no forced teaching allowed.  Or perhaps some prefer the <br/>
terminology of setting up a learning enviroment rather than teaching.   Also, <br/>
be careful not to confuse child led learning with child led living.  As far <br/>
as I&#39;m concerned, unschooling is not about giving into a child&#39;s every desire <br/>
or centering the parents&#39; entire lives around the child.  It is about <br/>
remembering that a child is a person (just like an adult is) and deserves the <br/>
respect and consideration that adults are accorded.  I don&#39;t want anyone <br/>
saying to me, &quot;OK, every day from 8:00 til 9:00 you&#39;re going to work in this <br/>
math book, then I&#39;ll drill you on some vocabulary, etc.&quot;  So I don&#39;t want to <br/>
do that to my children either.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;1) Foreign languages are most easily learned and absorbed when we are quite<br/>
 </span></blockquote>young (under 6 years).  If I waited for my child to ask me about that, well,<br/>
she really doesn&#39;t have enough information to think of that question, not to<br/>
mention difficulty just formulating a sentence.  I think she would have<br/>
missed out on that opportunity.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Something that unschooling most definitely does seem to be, to me, is the <br/>
opportunity to discover things about the world.  Rather than being locked in <br/>
a building for half the day with very limited options, I hope for my children <br/>
to have a lot of exposure to the world and people around them.  If I had <br/>
children now, they would have adults in their lives who speak Spanish, <br/>
French, and German.  We rent Italian and Swedish movies frequently.  I know a <br/>
dabbling of Welsh.  By the time I have children I may know even more <br/>
bilingual people.  Even if I don&#39;t actually know someone in an area of <br/>
interest, I would still try to expose my child to it in some way.  <br/>
Unschooling is not about cloistering or about waiting for the child to come <br/>
up with ideas.  It&#39;s about showing the world to your child and seeing what <br/>
s/he wants to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;2)  My daughter wanted to stay and play in one of the toy cabinets today<br/>
 </span></blockquote>when I had a need to get the dog to the veterinarian for her shots.  I was<br/>
pulling her away from her cabinet and her desires to learn and play at that<br/>
instant.  I was doing the leading, she the following.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Occasionally my daughter wants to keep doing what she&#39;s doing, when<br/>
we&#39;re outside say, in the sunshine, or in the mosquito prime time.  Should I<br/>
follow her lead and let her get sunburned or eaten alive by mosquitoes, or<br/>
deal with her crying and dissapointment because I have deemed it is in her<br/>
best interest.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 In the first case, your child needed to give up something she wanted because <br/>
someone else (in this case either you or the dog or both depending on how you <br/>
want to look at it) needed something more important.  This is something <br/>
everyone has to do.  In the second it&#39;s a question of health or at least <br/>
comfort.  However, I would assert that saying, &quot;I need you to help me take <br/>
the dog to the vet&quot; or &quot;The sun is very hot now and we&#39;ll get burned.&quot; is <br/>
different than saying &quot;Stop playing, I need to go now or I&#39;ll be late&quot; or &quot;We <br/>
have to leave now.&quot;  I think it really does help to explain, to include the <br/>
child in the discussion.  I think it&#39;s even more effective (in my experience) <br/>
if the child is actually active and helping in some way (as in the first <br/>
example). My neice is very strong-headed (some people would say &quot;willful&quot;) <br/>
but when I explain what I need her to do she&#39;s fine.  I don&#39;t for a minute <br/>
claim that this will work all the time or equally well with all children, but <br/>
I think it&#39;s an attitude.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Just by virtue<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of the fact you have chosen to homeschool and unschool, you have dictated<br/>
*to a certain extent* how your child will view and interact with the world.<br/>
Parents make choices every day, even prenatal choices that affect the child.<br/>
It can&#39;t be helped!  It&#39;s called the environment. &lt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course.  Though, as I said in my first post, how I will approach my <br/>
unschooling/homeschooling will depend on the personalities of my children.  <br/>
If it really seemed better for one of my children, I would even consider a <br/>
private school.  I have no desire to somehow eliminate &quot;environment&quot; for my <br/>
children or even to subdue my own personality.  I just want to provide the <br/>
best environment possible for them.  And, IMHO, that means giving them a <br/>
place where they feel safe to learn, question, create, explore, and be <br/>
whoever it is that they will be.  It&#39;s also a place where they feel like <br/>
they&#39;re making a contribution.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Last comment, stolen from my husband&#39;s lips.  You can&#39;t teach linear algebra<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or Calculus from cooking.  You&#39;re going to need some semblance of a<br/>
curriculum for such things.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, your husband has never tried to cook a Martha Stewart recipe.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, what is it with the calculus thing?  How many students in public <br/>
or even private high school take calculus?  How many adults ever use or <br/>
remember their calculus?  <br/>
<br/>
Basically, there seems to be three reasons to learn something like this: 1.  <br/>
You enjoy it 2.  You need it to progress in something you enjoy  3.  You need <br/>
it for something else that is otherwise unrelated.<br/>
<br/>
So, I might have a child who just loves math for its own sake.  If that child <br/>
wants to work his/her way through a calculus book or take a college class or <br/>
make a private arrangement with a math teacher, I&#39;m certainly not going to <br/>
mind.  (When I was in school I actually LOVED working through math books, <br/>
especially story problems.  Twisted, I know.  ;-) )  Or possibly their math <br/>
intelligence will be strong enough that they won&#39;t need these things.  If I <br/>
have a child who loves physics, s/he will have to decide whether they love it <br/>
enough to deal with the mathematical part.  If so, again, there are choices <br/>
for learning.  But it will be the child&#39;s choice, not mine.  Finally, if I <br/>
have a child who&#39;s brilliant at words but so-so at math but s/he wants to go <br/>
to college, I&#39;ll be sure s/he knows what level of math is necessary for the <br/>
SATs to impress the admissions offices at college.  Then, again, it&#39;s the <br/>
child&#39;s choice.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I was doing the leading, she the following.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is only one mention of leading and following that led to some thoughts<br/>
I&#39;ve been having today.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the term &quot;child led learning&quot;.  I don&#39;t like &quot;natural<br/>
learning&quot; either, for a different reason.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Around here, no one is leading, and no one is following, most of the time.<br/>
We do what we do.  Sometimes we are all doing different things, sometimes<br/>
we are doing the same things separately, sometimes together.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like the kids say they are interested in something, and I&#39;m<br/>
following them around, listening for that comment or question, at which<br/>
time I jump in with resources.  I think people sometimes get that<br/>
impression of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, it&#39;s more like this:<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has a computer across the room from where mine is.  Since we are<br/>
both in there at the same time some of the time, we might talk while we<br/>
work.  Or he might be talking to a sibling while he does something, and I<br/>
can hear them.  Or he might come upstairs later and mention what he was<br/>
doing, or suggest something he might like to do.<br/>
<br/>
Days later, maybe I&#39;ll be at a book store, and come across a book that<br/>
reminds me of something he said.  I might get it, if it sounds interesting.<br/>
Or maybe I won&#39;t get it, but I&#39;ll tell him later that I saw it, and see<br/>
what he thinks.<br/>
<br/>
He might come across something online that he knows I&#39;m interested in and<br/>
tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, he looked at a webpage I coded, thought something was cool, and<br/>
downloaded the sourcecode to use on his own page.  I was glad to see it,<br/>
since he has been so much help to me when I&#39;ve needed to find code for<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I&#39;ve read a dozen books to the youngest, who has decided she<br/>
wants more books with the moon in them, so in the back of my head, that<br/>
thought is there, and if I come across any moon books, I&#39;m likely to<br/>
notice.  We&#39;ve been planning to go outside at the next full moon, and I may<br/>
try to find that book- Walk When The Moon is Full and read that before we<br/>
go, or maybe not.  We might get out the telescope, or not.  Maybe we&#39;ll<br/>
sleep outside.<br/>
<br/>
The roses have just started blooming so we&#39;ll be taking pictures of them<br/>
later for a friend who is interested in them- and that reminds me, we need<br/>
to plant the flowers we want to grow for drying.  We also need to get the<br/>
outdoor water fixed so we don&#39;t have to carry water to everything in this<br/>
dry weather.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And so it goes, our lives, from one thing to another, flowing without much<br/>
effort.  My life, my kids&#39; lives, my husband&#39;s life.  Sometimes on our own,<br/>
sometimes as a group.  No one is really leading, we&#39;re all meandering.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll start using the phrase &quot;interest-flow learning&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100670178">Okay gang,<br/>
<br/>
You caught me on the newness of the list!  I had forgotten we got it from a<br/>
link from another homeschool list and that it was  a NEW list!  I guess the<br/>
sheer volume of posts led me to believe it had been around for a while &lt;g&gt;,<br/>
or perhaps it was several people mentioning something to the effect that it<br/>
used to be so fun and friendly before this came along.  Used to be?  I<br/>
thought that suggested &gt; 2 weeks.  My mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with modeling, and I think surrounding your child with<br/>
people who speak foreign language, and inviting them to learn with you is<br/>
great.  In fact, we have done so with learning sign language with our 33<br/>
month old.  I used this as an example, because I thought some members would<br/>
view this as &quot;TEACHING&quot;.  I&#39;m seeing this is quite a debate of semantics<br/>
more than anything else.  Also, I said the best time is PRIOR to 6 years<br/>
old, like 2 to 6.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding linear algebra and calculus....my husband is a mathmetician as<br/>
well and I&#39;ll let him respond.  He wasn&#39;t sure if a textbook would be viewed<br/>
as &quot;CURRICULUM&quot;!  My question, is I didn&#39;t realize college was okay for some<br/>
of you, as I misconstrued that you would be &quot;taught&quot; in such a class.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t realize unschooling stopped post highschool age.  I thought it went<br/>
on FOREVER.<br/>
<br/>
Several of you distinguished &quot;parenting&quot; issues, from &quot;schooling&quot; issues.<br/>
Another argument of semantics.  I thought unschooling permeated all aspects<br/>
of life, hence the reason I used those examples.  And BTW, I do attempt to<br/>
explain to Kate about mosquitoes and getting sunburned, but alas, sometimes<br/>
the fun she is having is more understandable.  And whoever said why don&#39;t<br/>
you use sunscreen and bug juice.....sunscreen works for a certain amount of<br/>
time (even sunblock 45).  You obviously don&#39;t have fair skin (or red hair<br/>
like Kate!! :).  Nor have you had peers develop melanoma.  The contents of<br/>
bug juice are really not what I like to be slathering myself with, much less<br/>
Kate, though I would if it appeared to me a worthwhile outdoor event (I<br/>
suppose that would be my parental judgment, eh? not my unschooler choice).<br/>

(adult or child) wants to learn about a subject using a textbook,<br/>
that&#39;s cool!  I have my old History of England text around and I<br/>
look up things in that occasionally.  I also have most of my math, <br/>
physics, and computer science books around for reference too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that taking classes someplace is anathema to unschooling.<br/>
It&#39;s the motivation for the person taking the class that matters.<br/>
If I coerce another person into taking a class, I&#39;m not unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
I see what I personally am doing now as a combination of unschooling<br/>
and deschooling.  I am unschooling myself in that I am learning new<br/>
things.  I am deschooling in that I am attempting to frame learning/<br/>
education/teaching in new terms.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that unschooling continues thru life, even if one<br/>
attends college and graduates.<br/>

First - Child-led learning does NOT mean that you sit around staring at your <br/>
kids waiting for them to ask about something.  It doesn&#39;t.  Child led <br/>
learning means that you KNOW your children, you understand how their brains <br/>
work, how they learn best and you facilitate their interests in ways that <br/>
will help them figure things out.  SO - If I want to learn Spanish (which I <br/>
do, and I am) I find a way that I like - I share the language I am learning <br/>
with whoever is interested.  At this time, 4 of my dd&#39;s are interested.  We <br/>
decided to find someone who could help us learn.  For US this has been the <br/>
best method.  My ds didn&#39;t WANT to learn SPanish - he wants German.  He is <br/>
way into WWII stuff and has become fascinated with the language.  A teacher <br/>
for him is NOT the best way to learn.  We have purchased tapes and books and <br/>
other things for him to learn the language.  Occasionally he gets an <br/>
opportunity to speak with his Uncle, who learned in school.  These are BOTH <br/>
child-led things.  The first happened because I became interested and shared <br/>
my interest with the kids...some chose to follow/participate, some didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Algebra and Higher Math... We use these in real life... so what if <br/>
we don&#39;t know the theorems (sp?) and &quot;rules&quot;?  When trying to figure out how <br/>
much paint we need to cover a 2000 sf house, we use algebra.  When trying to <br/>
decide how big a tarp we need to cover our cords of wood, we use algebra...  <br/>
The kids naturally participate in the measuring and multiplying and such... <br/>
they are learning the principles.  If they ever NEED to know the theorems <br/>
(why does that look wrong???) they know how to find information on that too.  <br/>
There is &quot;higher math&quot; in every day life - most people just don&#39;t recognize <br/>
it as such.<br/>

&lt;&lt; A curriculum might be helpful for folks who don&#39;t have a clue where to<br/>
 start playing, if they&#39;ve had that playing with numbers instinct removed<br/>
 somehow.  But people without math phobias will naturally play around with<br/>
 stuff enough to find it very cool and interesting and fascinating (unless,<br/>
 of course, they simply aren&#39;t inclined that way, in which case, they aren&#39;t<br/>
 likely to end up needing to know anyway).  We do huge amounts of thinking<br/>
 and talking and playing and exploring around here that involve things that<br/>
 could be called algebra or calculus, but we have no need to call them that,<br/>
 or call them anything, or categorize them, we just use them.  Lots of<br/>
 physics stuff and music stuff and art stuff.  Cooking is often mentioned as<br/>
 a way to play with math, but it is by far not the only one. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Linda,<br/>
This is such a common response when someone new asks about how their children <br/>
will learn about higher math.  First of all I don&#39;t think there are that many <br/>
of us out there who don&#39;t have a math phobia.  Therefore there are a LOT of <br/>
us out there who are clueless, and when we ask, we get almost condescending <br/>
answers and generalities.  Blaming the parent for what they can&#39;t do because <br/>
they don&#39;t know how. No one gives specific examples, just &quot;play with numbers&quot; <br/>
how does that help? I never played with numbers so don&#39;t understand.  &quot; lots <br/>
of music stuff,&quot; my kids play three instruments, how does this help with <br/>
higher math?  I am not being contrary, I am SERIOUS here.  I want to let my <br/>
children have a happy learning experience, and if I am the culprit of them <br/>
not having that, then I want to do something about it.  We do not all have <br/>
the benefit of &quot;always being unschoolers, so it is a lifestyle.  Some of us <br/>
are not happy with the way we started out and want to change, but we need <br/>
help.<br/>

welds and is very good. He&#39;s now 14, but needing to be certified he will<br/>
have to attend a trade school before he can work in the field. My youngest<br/>
would like to work on computers. He already can build a computer from<br/>
scratch and has boxes of hardware parts filling his room.  He may not have<br/>
to attend a college, but then again he may. It will be his choice. For now,<br/>
both boys prefer to unschool and at least my oldest is dismayed looking<br/>

the Skin so soft for sunblock, ticks, and mosquitos. It does work pretty well.<br/>

impression that I was &quot;bad&quot; at math while in public school (by comparing my math<br/>
scores on standardized test to everything else... math was always in the 75-85th<br/>

true, it is hard for me to attempt higher math!  The 2 algebra courses I had to<br/>
take in college in order to meet the math requirement for graduation were pure<br/>
torture for me.  I don&#39;t want this for my children!<br/>

structure.   Sometimes I think that unschooling looks easy on the outside, but is<br/>
really more work than traditional homeschooling, and wonder if I have the energy<br/>

how many unschooling, radical unschooling, unschooling circles,<br/>
etc. etc. etc. .....lists I&#39;ve been on and without fail there is<br/>
always an exchange, ranging in temperature from somewhat heated<br/>
to blazing flames over definitions and who can call themselves<br/>
what and so on.  It seems to be part of the life-cycle on all the<br/>
homeschool lists, not just the unschooling ones.  I have my<br/>
definition which works for me, and frankly, I couldn&#39;t care less<br/>
about anybody else&#39;s.  If a child is making her own learning<br/>
experience, I don&#39;t care if she uses curriculum or not, though I<br/>
have yet to meet an elementary age child who would choose<br/>
curriculum if given the choice.  I have however, met several <br/>
unschooled from birth young people who, for reasons of their own,<br/>
have chosen to do all or parts of correspondence courses with<br/>
assignments, grades and the whole ten yards.  I still consider<br/>
these folks unschoolers, as the decision about how, what, where<br/>
and with whom to learn was entirely theirs, as is the decision to<br/>
remain with this path or return to more intrinsic learning<br/>
styles.  <br/>
<br/>
As the mother of two learned but untaught boys, I wonder<br/>
sometimes if we haven&#39;t gone overboard with the autodidact<br/>
ideal.  My eldest, at fourteen, seems to have an attitude that if<br/>
he doesn&#39;t figure something out entirely on his own, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
count.  This is all very well, and certainly an effective way to<br/>
learn things in most cases, but it also means that he spends (I<br/>
wanted to say &quot;wastes&quot; but I&#39;m sure there is something of value<br/>
here somewhere) inordinate amounts of time reinventing wheels, so<br/>
to speak.  I keep mentioning that &quot;it&#39;s okay to look at the<br/>
manual, you know, I won&#39;t tell anybody - it&#39;s not cheating&quot; ....<br/>
but, well.<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to know that asking someone who already<br/>
knows what you want to learn is one of several possible effective<br/>
methods of aquiring skills or information.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll get<br/>
there eventually, but gosh, its hard to keep my mouth shut and<br/>
just let him keep shooting himself in the foot.<br/>

concepts by cooking, or playing with lego or constructing models<br/>
to scale.... before you actually get down to the linear equation<br/>
expression of those concepts on paper.  If and when the child<br/>
decides that they need to know algebra they may find that they<br/>
understand a good deal already.  They just haven&#39;t been calling<br/>
it algebra.  I can&#39;t comment about calculus, having reached the<br/>
age of 50 without ever having learned it or needed it for<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
Does your husband believe that everyone needs to know algebra and<br/>
calculus, and if so, why?   I&#39;ve learned to ask myself these<br/>
questions whenever I go through my periods of worrying about what<br/>
the kids haven&#39;t hit on yet.  Sometimes I find that when I really<br/>

I know the subject here was Algebra and Calculus. But had to share with you<br/>
something my youngest just did. In the current heat wave, we&#39;ve resorted to<br/>
freezing water in 20 oz pop bottles. His had melted quite a bit, but had a<br/>
pretty good sized chunk still swimming in the bottle. He began playing with<br/>
the ice (driving us all nuts as we listened to the click click of the ice<br/>
hitting the bottom, then the top of the botte. Finally, in desperation to<br/>
quit hearing this we asked what he was doing (trying to avoid asking him to<br/>
give us a break as the heat brings out the worst in all of us).  He looked<br/>
at us and said &quot;my ice falls whenever I get to a 30 degree angle with the<br/>
bottle&quot;.  This from a child who to the best of my knowlege never learned<br/>
anything about geometry. Guess you can play and learn.  <br/>
<br/>
As for algebra, I mentioned that same son saw an algebra scale in a<br/>
catalog. He asked for it, and began to play with the pans. It didn&#39;t take<br/>
long before he had mastered the idea of the equations/negative numbers. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t dream of using a book with him as he gets really frustrated with<br/>
textbooks, but he really likes playing to figure things out, so while I<br/>
learned algebra at school the old fashioned way (books) I&#39;m going to learn<br/>
by watching him to see how this can work without the books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739733886">I never said everyone should know and learn linear algebra and calculus.<br/>
I never said learning math cannot involve play and must be drudgery.<br/>
I never said I forced my child to learn a foreign language against her will.<br/>
I never said you sit back and wait for your kids to ask you questions before<br/>
doing anything.....<br/>
<br/>
I was responding to a discussion that talked about the word &quot;teaching&quot;<br/>
negatively.<br/>
My husband&#39;s comment was in reference to needing some textbooks and teaching<br/>
for higher math--not that required to paint a house, but that required for<br/>
jobs such as engineering of all types.  NO, I was not saying cram it down<br/>
every kid&#39;s throat.  I WAS saying if a child wanted to do that, then<br/>
wouldn&#39;t one have to be taught.  Do you really think unschooling is so hot,<br/>
that you can teach (oh excuse me, learn) engineering in 18 months, when it<br/>
takes 5 years in college.  You think those kids sit around and party all the<br/>
time?  You think their teachers have their heads in the wrong place?  I<br/>
don&#39;t think so.  I think it&#39;s just kind of difficult.  It just might not fit<br/>
into some of the pristine theories being so easily spouted around here. So<br/>
it seems its okay to brag about being a real unschooler until they are old<br/>
enough to choose engineering, then hey, they chose it, now they can go to<br/>
college and teachers are good guys because the kid chose them.  Huh?<br/>
<br/>
BRAHAHAHAHA.  Argue on.  Scapegoat on.  Paint me in a box until I scream<br/>
&quot;Uncle!&quot;  But your barking up the wrong tree.  I didn&#39;t join this list to<br/>
tell you to give tests and teach in 30 minute time blocks and slap your kid<br/>
around and tell them what to do, or better yet, just neglect them.  It&#39;s<br/>
amazing what gets misconstrued on these lists.<br/>

apologies. However, I do believe that there is pretty wide agreement on what it<br/>
isn&#39;t. And that includes not using curriculum imposed by someone other than the<br/>
learner. But then again, maybe there are different interpretations of that word<br/>
&#39;curriculum&#39; too! Someone else mentioned a difference between curriculum and<br/>
textbooks and I&#39;d agree with that. We use textbooks sometimes, but never in a<br/>
&#39;start at the beginning and go on until the end, doing everything&#39; way.<br/>
<br/>
My children and I have all, at times, attended classes when we wanted to learn<br/>
something specific and a class seemed the best available way to achieve that end<br/>
- and in those cases we accept the parameters of that situation. Usually.<br/>
Sometimes we drop out. In that case we tell the teacher why. The important thing<br/>
is that as learners we retain free choice.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I was doing the leading, she the following.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is only one mention of leading and following that led to some thoughts<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been having today.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like the term &quot;child led learning&quot;.  I don&#39;t like &quot;natural<br/>
&gt; learning&quot; either, for a different reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Around here, no one is leading, and no one is following, most of the time.<br/>
&gt; We do what we do.  Sometimes we are all doing different things, sometimes<br/>
&gt; we are doing the same things separately, sometimes together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not like the kids say they are interested in something, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; following them around, listening for that comment or question, at which<br/>
&gt; time I jump in with resources.  I think people sometimes get that<br/>
&gt; impression of unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Usually, it&#39;s more like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My oldest has a computer across the room from where mine is.  Since we are<br/>
&gt; both in there at the same time some of the time, we might talk while we<br/>
&gt; work.  Or he might be talking to a sibling while he does something, and I<br/>
&gt; can hear them.  Or he might come upstairs later and mention what he was<br/>
&gt; doing, or suggest something he might like to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Days later, maybe I&#39;ll be at a book store, and come across a book that<br/>
&gt; reminds me of something he said.  I might get it, if it sounds interesting.<br/>
&gt; Or maybe I won&#39;t get it, but I&#39;ll tell him later that I saw it, and see<br/>
&gt; what he thinks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He might come across something online that he knows I&#39;m interested in and<br/>
&gt; tell me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recently, he looked at a webpage I coded, thought something was cool, and<br/>
&gt; downloaded the sourcecode to use on his own page.  I was glad to see it,<br/>
&gt; since he has been so much help to me when I&#39;ve needed to find code for<br/>
&gt; something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Meanwhile, I&#39;ve read a dozen books to the youngest, who has decided she<br/>
&gt; wants more books with the moon in them, so in the back of my head, that<br/>
&gt; thought is there, and if I come across any moon books, I&#39;m likely to<br/>
&gt; notice.  We&#39;ve been planning to go outside at the next full moon, and I may<br/>
&gt; try to find that book- Walk When The Moon is Full and read that before we<br/>
&gt; go, or maybe not.  We might get out the telescope, or not.  Maybe we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; sleep outside.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The roses have just started blooming so we&#39;ll be taking pictures of them<br/>
&gt; later for a friend who is interested in them- and that reminds me, we need<br/>
&gt; to plant the flowers we want to grow for drying.  We also need to get the<br/>
&gt; outdoor water fixed so we don&#39;t have to carry water to everything in this<br/>
&gt; dry weather.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And so it goes, our lives, from one thing to another, flowing without much<br/>
&gt; effort.  My life, my kids&#39; lives, my husband&#39;s life.  Sometimes on our own,<br/>
&gt; sometimes as a group.  No one is really leading, we&#39;re all meandering.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;ll start using the phrase &quot;interest-flow learning&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the many special things about New Zealand :-) is the Playcenter movement<br/>
which started back during WW2 to support mothers with young children whose<br/>
husbands were away fighting. Playcentre is a preschool coop which believes in<br/>
child - led learning (there&#39;s that phrase again) and I started going with my<br/>
oldest son when he was 2. Unfortunately, I was a slow learner, so poor Greg had<br/>
to suffer a more structured preschool, and 7 weeks at school before I gave in to<br/>
the inevitable. (That was 13 years ago.)<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that I&#39;m not always true to unschooling - I do panic every now<br/>
and then and start pushing - but the kids are used to this and wait till I calm<br/>
down a bit and then tell me where to get off!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just by virtue<br/>
&gt; of the fact you have chosen to homeschool and unschool, you have dictated<br/>
&gt; *to a certain extent* how your child will view and interact with the world.<br/>
&gt; Parents make choices every day, even prenatal choices that affect the child.<br/>
&gt; It can&#39;t be helped!  It&#39;s called the environment.  No one can escape it<br/>
&gt; completely.  Give yourselves a break!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re so right. But rather than tell your kids what to learn, broaden their<br/>
environment, expose them to the things you think they should learn, and if they<br/>
are interested, they&#39;ll take it from there. If they aren&#39;t interested now,<br/>
they&#39;ll remember that exposure later when / if they actually do need it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666571306"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Hsmotgo@...">Hsmotgo@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No one gives specific examples, just &quot;play with numbers&quot;<br/>
&gt; how does that help?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helps because one of the most important things is being comfortable,<br/>
really comfortable, with numbers and how they relate to each other.  Basic<br/>
arithmetic needs to be something that not only can you do, it&#39;s part of how<br/>
you think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I never played with numbers so don&#39;t understand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Play games.  Play with dice.  Add numbers in your head.  Factor numbers in<br/>
your head.  Play with things like dividing something, then multiplying it<br/>
to get back where you started.  This sounds simplistic, but it really<br/>
matters.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &quot; lots of music stuff,&quot; my kids play three instruments, how does this<br/>
&gt; help with  higher math?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Music and math share the concepts of recognizing and creating patterns.<br/>
Really.  Music theory is math in a different form.<br/>
<br/>
Look at improvisational music- how is that done?  The player has to know<br/>
what key he is in, and what that means, and how to stay within that<br/>
framework- or if he wants, where to go outside of it and still have it<br/>
sound good.  The listener has a part in this, too, because part of what<br/>
makes music beautiful and meaningful is an intrinsic understanding of music<br/>
theory on a basic level- what sounds in tune, what sounds discordant, where<br/>
things sound like they should be going.  You can hear a chord resolve in<br/>
your head, even if it doesn&#39;t actually resolve in the music, because you<br/>
expect it to be that way.  Good musicians play with your expectations, and<br/>
surprise you some of the time.  Your experience of the music involves what<br/>
you&#39;ve just heard, keeping it in your head, and adding to it the new sounds<br/>
happening, and making them relate in your mind.<br/>
<br/>
Did you think I was going to fall back on the time signature as the math in<br/>
music?  Sure, that&#39;s part of it, the rhythms, but it&#39;s the notes and chords<br/>
and their relationships to each other that is part of higher math.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to counterpoint, baroque music, minimalist music.  Listen to music<br/>
in different tonal systems (like Gamelan or different Eastern music forms).<br/>
Sing arpeggios.  Play duets, or rounds.  Try having two people play the<br/>
same piece, but one play it twice through, twice the speed- how do they<br/>
sound together that way?  Why?<br/>
<br/>
Go look up the Pythagorean Scale, see where it came from, how it changed<br/>
and why.  Then listen to early Bach.  Listen to my favorite Bach- The Well<br/>
Tempered Clavier (where did the name come from, and what does it mean?  Why<br/>
is that important?)  Try to find a performance on pre-Pythagorean<br/>
instruments.<br/>
<br/>
I really am beginning to believe that part of this culture&#39;s problem with<br/>
math fear and deficiency is that the educational system largely ignores<br/>
music and art.  Back during the time of the most famous mathematicians,<br/>
music was considered one of the most important academic subjects.  I think<br/>
listening to and interpreting music, lots of different styles, is part of<br/>
what helps our brains learn and practice making the connections they use in<br/>
math.  Trying to teach math without that background is almost like<br/>
expecting a child to speak who has bever been spoken to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am not being contrary, I am SERIOUS here.  I want to let my<br/>
&gt; children have a happy learning experience, and if I am the culprit of them<br/>
&gt; not having that, then I want to do something about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are not the culprit- more likely, what was done to you as a child is<br/>
the culprit.<br/>
<br/>
You can undo it, just like your children can if they have had negative math<br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
The book &quot;Family Math&quot; is a good starting place.  (I hear they have a<br/>
couple of new versions out, one for younger kids, and one for older, but I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen those)  It&#39;s full of games.  Try some.   Start with easy ones,<br/>
progress through whichever catch your interest.  The important thing is to<br/>
have fun with them.  Once you&#39;re having fun, think about what you&#39;re doing,<br/>
really think- why do things work that way?  What is easier or harder for<br/>
you?  Why?  Where are your personal math blocks?<br/>
<br/>
You may want to doodle while you think, or draw or sing or talk with<br/>
someone or whatever helps stuff to stick in your head.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite things to do, and to tell people to do, is to play with<br/>
converting numbers into different forms.  Go from decimal to fraction to<br/>
percentage to ratio and back again.  Get comfortable with numbers in their<br/>
different forms, so that you can take advantage of which form most easily<br/>
lends itself to a certain situation.  (Decimals are good for money, for<br/>
example)  Be as comfortable manipulating fractions as anything else.<br/>
<br/>
See math as a game, not a chore.  A playground.  A tool, if you have to, or<br/>
if you like tools.<br/>
<br/>
Go look at stuff like fractals and complex geometric shapes, see the<br/>
intricacy and beauty of math.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256006525"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: &quot;Dale & Karen Jones-Waddell&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:katejw@...">katejw@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My husband&#39;s comment was in reference to needing some textbooks and teaching<br/>
&gt; for higher math--not that required to paint a house, but that required for<br/>
&gt; jobs such as engineering of all types.  NO, I was not saying cram it down<br/>
&gt; every kid&#39;s throat.  I WAS saying if a child wanted to do that, then<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t one have to be taught.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;ll still say no, someone would not have to be taught.  They very well<br/>
could be taught, if that&#39;s the route they want to go, but it is not an<br/>
absolute necessity.  I&#39;m not saying that being taught is a terrible thing-<br/>
only that it is not the necessity that many people think it is.  It is not<br/>
the only way.<br/>
<br/>
I learned calculus on my own. I was in a foreign country and my math needs<br/>
did not match up with the schedule in the school I attended, so I had<br/>
independent study all year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you really think unschooling is so hot,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where is this coming from?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that you can teach (oh excuse me, learn) engineering in 18 months, when it<br/>
&gt; takes 5 years in college.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When what takes 5 years?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Engineering&quot; is a might broad vague term.  What exactly do you mean by it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You think those kids sit around and party all the<br/>
&gt; time?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of them do.  Trust me.<br/>
<br/>
Growing up and living in the same town as a major University with a well<br/>
respected Engineering school, I don&#39;t have quite the awe of it that many<br/>
people have.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  You think their teachers have their heads in the wrong place?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  I just think that teachers are only one of many ways for someone to<br/>
learn something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So<br/>
&gt; it seems its okay to brag about being a real unschooler until they are old<br/>
&gt; enough to choose engineering, then hey, they chose it, now they can go to<br/>
&gt; college and teachers are good guys because the kid chose them.  Huh?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t said that, has anyone?<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, my husband is a software engineer, and he is self taught.  He did not<br/>
learn his skills in college.  I expect that my two boys may go the same<br/>
way, and not choose college.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; BRAHAHAHAHA.  Argue on.  Scapegoat on.  Paint me in a box until I scream<br/>
&gt; &quot;Uncle!&quot;  But your barking up the wrong tree.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You seem to be taking things way too personally.  No one is making you a<br/>
scapegoat, they&#39;re responding to the issues in your posts.  If you don&#39;t<br/>
want responses to your posts, perhaps you shouldn&#39;t post them?<br/>

So does that mean there are people here who have come on the list without <br/>
having gone to www.unschooling.com and read there first?<br/>
<br/>
That would explain a lot, if so!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I assumed that everyone here had been to that site, understood the underlying <br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m seeing this is quite a debate of semantics more than anything else. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Terminology and semantics are what thinking and analysis are about.<br/>
If we&#39;re not clarifying terms, we can&#39;t really have a discussion about <br/>
beliefs.<br/>
Without clear beliefs, what basis will we have for what we&#39;re doing?<br/>
<br/>
If people want to just follow a pre-set pattern without understanding fully <br/>
why and what and how, that&#39;s not unschooling.  Each unschooling parent (or at <br/>
least one in each family) NEEDS to understand the difference between teaching <br/>
and learning.  They NEED to think hard and long and carefully about what they <br/>
believe about what is &quot;necessary.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t have to be done in advance of <br/>
beginning to unschool.  It&#39;s part of the whole process.  But deciding in <br/>
advance that such things are unimportant is, I believe, part of a recipe for <br/>
eventual failure.   How can we defend what we don&#39;t understand?  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is all about how learning works.  It seems to me that what books <br/>
you have in the house, or how often you go to a museum, or whether you allow <br/>
unlimited computer games isn&#39;t nearly as important as whether you believe <br/>
that people learn unceasingly for fun when their desire isn&#39;t destroyed <br/>
somehow.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just semantics at all.  <br/>

positioning) but they can in their heads figure out with marty&#39;s allowance or <br/>
Kirby&#39;s (different rates) how many weeks it will take to buy a certain thing <br/>
new or used (two different factors).  And they can figure the tax in their <br/>

getting A&#39;s in algebra wouldn&#39;t know what it was actually applicable to in <br/>
their own real lives, they&#39;re just solving &quot;problems&quot; already set up on <br/>
paper.  They&#39;re doing calculations.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told this story before, so sorry for the repetition.<br/>
<br/>
I was complaining to my husband one night that I HATED math in school, all <br/>
except the word problems.  I loved those, but there would only be two per <br/>
exercise, and 38 of the stupid number problems.   <br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;Those are the only problems there.  The others are answers.  All <br/>
that&#39;s left is the calculation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OH!  So I DID like mathematics, I just didn&#39;t like the <br/>
numbers-without-words-or-purpose &quot;exercise&quot; parts.<br/>
<br/>
Last night a friend was telling me that he was baffled by trigonometry in <br/>
college.  Nobody could tell him what it was good for.  Then he took an <br/>
electrical engineering class, and the DC part was all linear algebra, and <br/>
when they got to AC it was TRIGONOMETRY and he was thrilled and THEN he got <br/>
trigonometry, because he had an application for it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve studied literature, history, folklore, anthropology, I do music as <br/>
hobby--recorder, guitar, singing.   I sew.   I play with philosophy.  I have <br/>
never one time in my life needed trigonometry.<br/>
<br/>
If I did, I&#39;d know how to learn it, though!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not more work, but it&#39;s more mental work to get started.  For <br/>
traditional, you can write a check, look at the calendar and say &quot;DO THIS.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Once you get established in unschooling, it becomes effortless.<br/>
<br/>
I know martial arts teachers say all the time &quot;this will become effortless&quot; <br/>
but that&#39;s after ten years of sweating your butt off!    This is not NEARLY <br/>
in that range of difficulty.  Honest.<br/>
<br/>
This list, if it is kept to topic, will be a perfect dojo for learning <br/>
unschooling.  There are some very experienced unschoolers here who write well <br/>
and who are willing to commit a goodly amount of time and energy to helping <br/>
the newcomers here.  When I asked that the list be kept to topic, it was out <br/>
of a well-founded fear that some of the best unschoolers here would drop off <br/>
the list if it remained chatty about curriculum.  IF it turns out that people <br/>
came here directly without awareness of what unschooling really is, the best <br/>
thing would be for them to read more and post less until they decide if they <br/>
really want to be on an unschooling list.<br/>

Some have said that&#39;s wrong of me to ask.  <br/>
More have said it&#39;s good.  <br/>
<br/>
If you went into a karate school and started boxing or break dancing they&#39;d <br/>
throw you out.   If you go to a brass band practice with a violin, they&#39;re <br/>
not going to let you play with them no matter HOW good you are.  You can&#39;t go <br/>
to a bow shoot with a rifle.  <br/>
