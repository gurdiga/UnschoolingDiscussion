<div id="ygrps-yiv-625324420">My oldest son, who alternately makes me breathless with his brilliance and angst-ridden <br/>
when I think about his &quot;future&quot; (whatever that is, anyway...), is suddenly soaring and I think <br/>
I&#39;m beginnning to &quot;get&quot; the power of this unschooling lifestyle on another level.<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know. You are probably all nodding your heads and rolling your eyes. I have to <br/>
process everything OUT LOUD. But thanks for your indulgence anyway. I&#39;m hoping my little <br/>
exclamations help someone else less extroverted to feel sane.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
He is 17. This year he is totally at home with no expectations on him from us. I think we <br/>
really have always been gently nudging him (even when I didn&#39;t think I was...). He is more <br/>
susceptible to &quot;nudges&quot; than I realized. He struggles to balance my &quot;good ideas&quot; against <br/>
what he really wants to do and it undermines him. I took acceptance of my ideas as <br/>
personal interest on his part and am just noticing now that that was not the case.<br/>
<br/>
I have been worried about stuff like organization, a sense of direction, an ability to see his <br/>
future, etc. I also worried that he was not engaged in enough activity that looked like he <br/>
was learning...  (I know, I know)<br/>
<br/>
Well, in the last two months, it&#39;s like he has blossomed in spite of me. Now that he&#39;s been <br/>
totally out of school, decided not to play lacrosse (even after I put subtle ::cringe:: <br/>
pressure on him to play again... I&#39;m such an idiot), and there is no expectation that he&#39;ll go <br/>
to college next year, he is doing the coolest things!<br/>
<br/>
1. He got cast in the lead in our city&#39;s professionally directed high school Shakespeare <br/>
company. He is loving this! The training is fabulous and he&#39;s totally dialed in to rehearsing, <br/>
studying lines, learning all about Shakespeare poetry etc. We are astounded at how much <br/>
Shakespeare he has memorized for fun that we didn&#39;t even know about.<br/>
<br/>
2. He auditioned for a band and got the part of lead guitar. I didn&#39;t even know he knew a <br/>
band and I never see him practice. He told me he practices in the middle of the night with <br/>
the amp unplugged. He&#39;s gotten good! He also plays piano, though he plays Rachmaninov <br/>
instead of heavy metal...<br/>
<br/>
3. He&#39;s reading again. He went through a period of not reading much (I realize now that <br/>
for him, his obligations to &quot;school&quot; - just one class per day - and sports depleted him of <br/>
that energy). Last night he walked around with Plato&#39;s Republic... I have no idea why. :) <br/>
He&#39;s got a stack of books out including Hithchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. :)<br/>
<br/>
4. He&#39;s working at a job he LOVES for the first time (Starbucks at B&N).<br/>
<br/>
5. He suddenly has a social life and lots of friends (this was a big concern of ours).<br/>
<br/>
6. He&#39;s driving our third car and taking such good care of it. He calls me about cheap gas <br/>
whenever he finds it, and hasn&#39;t had to be asked to check the oil (after just about ruining <br/>
his car over the same problem).<br/>
<br/>
7. He bought milk for us this a.m. because we were out without asking for money or if I <br/>
would get it. :) He is managing his money beautifully for the first time-has real goals and <br/>
is keeping to them without any support from Jon or me.<br/>
<br/>
8. He is learning to be a Magic level one judge.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on. This is like a complete turn around in his life since January. Some of <br/>
these things were sort of in place in the fall, but it&#39;s like his life is suddenly really rich *for <br/>
him* and I have virtually nothing to do with it except to chat and hug and laugh.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s getting along great with all of us (parents, kids) and none of the signs of mild <br/>
depression I thought I saw there before.<br/>
<br/>
Can I just squeal for a minute?! Eeeeeee.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, I am happy that I got out of the way. Thanks for all the good ideas and support <br/>
around here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Those places are so *awful* LOL - since they put in places like <br/>
Starbucks, with beverages and edibles, in bookstores it&#39;s really <br/>
hard for me to LEAVE the store - and many of them have seating areas <br/>
with soft chairs - I could LIVE there!<br/>
<br/>
But seriously it&#39;s wonderful to hear that things have picked up <br/>
nicely at your house. It&#39;s cool for those of us with little ones (my <br/>
DS is 6 1/2) to hear about life with teens.</div>
