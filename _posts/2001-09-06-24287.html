&gt; I am trying my hardest to be a Zen mommy but I do at times lose it and yell.<br/>
&gt; Zoe also yells. I believe it is in us but we can change and want to.I am not<br/>
&gt; condoning yelling at my child in anger,I hate when I do it but I admit to<br/>
&gt; doing it. I do however feel it is better than what I grew up w/ which was<br/>
&gt; shaming and blaming and name calling. So I am at least doing better than the<br/>
&gt; generation before me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Am I understood yet? Or do you still think I am a person to steer clear of?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nicki, I apologize if I&#39;ve seemed to be targeting you in any way -- I<br/>
frequently lose track of who I&#39;m talking to &lt;g&gt; in these discussions and<br/>
tend to just clip what seems relevant to me at the time, regardless of<br/>
poster.<br/>
<br/>
I have no reason to believe I&#39;d be steering clear of you.<br/>
