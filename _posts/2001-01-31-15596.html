of these discussions deteriorate or some folks get too carried away, folks see

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">When this was stated (the Catholics and the 
Baptists see one another as part of the <br>Satanic evil) it was about the 
generic use of the words &quot;Catholics&quot; and &quot;Baptists&quot; and not about any one 
specific person.&nbsp; Generally speaking the &quot;official&quot; attitude of&nbsp;*the* 
Catholic church is as above stated.&nbsp; What an *individual* person or church 
may or maynot do or believe is not dependent or reflective on that 
statement.&nbsp;</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">This wasn&#39;t meant to reflect on an individuals 
beliefs but rather the ideology put out there by the accepted &quot;voice&quot; of those 
two entities.</font></div>

My point is that some religions preclude their members respecting others&#39; <br/>
opinions and differences.</div>
