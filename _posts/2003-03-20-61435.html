<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581915722">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We had to take an unexpected trip this past week.  As we traveled<br/>
DS(14) asked, &quot;Mom what is c-y-n-i-c-a-l?&quot; I pronouned it and we<br/>
discussed the word.  Later DS(10) asked the same of emancipation. <br/>
Pronunciation and  discussion followed.  Even later in the trip was<br/>
&quot;distain&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Got to love &#39;Calvin and Hobbs&#39; :)<br/>

Oh yeah and one of our favorite games.  Word association.  Someone<br/>
starts with a word like &#39;light&#39; and next person may say &#39;heavy&#39; or<br/>
&#39;sun&#39; and we continue around the car.  They love finding tricky<br/>
associations. My oldest is quite good at this.  We had a great albeit<br/>
very long trip. <br/>
Just had to share.</div>
