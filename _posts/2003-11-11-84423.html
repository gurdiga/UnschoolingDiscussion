<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440048808">&lt;&lt;there are options besides coercing housework or watching Rome burn&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly what I have been trying to say.  The original poster stated<br/>
that the kids know if they don&#39;t help out there is less time for fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Another poster stated that it sounded like &quot;head games&quot; to her.<br/>
<br/>
I simply posted that it isn&#39;t &quot;head games&quot; around here.  I truly do have<br/>
less time to do fun stuff if nobody helps out and the kids are very aware of<br/>
it.  It isn&#39;t a threat.  It isn&#39;t meant as coersion.  It is simply the way<br/>
things are.<br/>
<br/>
I could easily clear my calendar so that I have time to do all the housework<br/>
myself and the kids could help out or not and we would still have time for<br/>
reading stories and museums and such.<br/>
<br/>
The problem would be that what I would be clearing is not stuff that I do<br/>
for me (because I haven&#39;t had anything other than email for me for some time<br/>
now) but stuff the kids do for them that they need my help with.  I could<br/>
clear 4-H officership, raising and showing 13 goats and a bunch of rabbits,<br/>
3 dogs, competitive gymnastics (9 trips to the gym a week and out of town<br/>
meets at least once per month), competitive skeet shooting (practice half an<br/>
hour away twice a week and meets all across the state at least twice a<br/>
month), the ballistics club (just had 12 kids at my house learning physics<br/>
and setting off fire kites).<br/>
<br/>
To do the things the kids love there is also a lot of behind the scenes work<br/>
that HAS to be done.  I have to make arrangements for small kids who are not<br/>
involved in the activity (perhaps a babysitter, or a snack and something for<br/>
them to play with while we are there), driving back and forth, talking and<br/>
acting gently with the kids who are having their favorite television show<br/>
interrupted so we can go get Adriane AGAIN, animals have to be fed, bred,<br/>
milked, stalls cleaned, hooves trimmed, I have to figure out the physics<br/>
behind the catapult, etc..  That is in addition to all the regular mom stuff<br/>
and cleaning up.<br/>
<br/>
If I do it ALL myself, I not only don&#39;t have time to do fun stuff, I don&#39;t<br/>
have the energy.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, the kids HAVE to help out if we are going to do any extra stuff.  My<br/>
plate is full trying to help them do the things they love , the things they<br/>
have asked me to help them with, and they know that and understand that.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, there is a difference between coersing housework and watching Rome<br/>
burn.....and there is a difference between the kids not needing to raise a<br/>
finger and playing &quot;head games&quot; with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851736730">Recently I&#39;m having a hard time figuring out what are lines quoted from<br/>
other emails and what are new comments.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t meant as a rule or anything. Just a request to help make a busy<br/>
list easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the new AOL software is causing problems with quotes. But nonAOLers<br/>
don&#39;t have that excuse! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Some people are putting plain text quotes at the top and plain text comments<br/>
follow. But some people are adding plain text comments at the top and<br/>
letting the plain text email they&#39;re responding to dangle beneath. Some are<br/>
doing both! And it&#39;s not obvious at least to me where the new stuff is. I<br/>
know if I need more than a second or two to figure out what I&#39;m supposed to<br/>
read, it&#39;s likely I&#39;m just going to skip it. (Especially since the list<br/>
occasionally gets duplicate posts so if a couple seconds scan says duplicate<br/>
there isn&#39;t a reason to keep searching to make sure that it isn&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
It helps me the most as a reader, to have a snippet quoted from the email<br/>
followed by the comment. People have already read the quoted email so they<br/>
don&#39;t need to see more than a bit to tell them what&#39;s prompting the comment.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s common in business and other correspondence to include the whole<br/>
email or series of emails at the bottom to let someone know what you&#39;re<br/>
responding to. But on the list we&#39;ve all been (it&#39;s presumed) following<br/>
along and we&#39;ve just, often minutes before, read the other email so we don&#39;t<br/>
need the whole thing included. (And it drives people on digest bonkers!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d greatly appreciate it if people would look over what they&#39;re writing and<br/>
see if it&#39;s clear that a quote is a quote and comments are clearly comments.<br/>
A line separating the two isn&#39;t enough since some people are putting them in<br/>
quote-comment order, and some in comment-quote order.<br/>
<br/>
One suggestion is you might try checking under Edit in the menu of your<br/>
email program to see if there&#39;s a &quot;Paste as Quote&quot; option.<br/>

It IS a head game if the thing the parent says isn&#39;t true, and it <br/>
guilt-inducing.<br/>

all their points on a clean floor five years ago.  It&#39;s not clean anymore and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-81817634">&lt;&lt;Either they help with the housework OR you cut back on their activities?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Either I am posting particularly poorly or you are being particularly<br/>
obtuse.  How can I let the housework slide when the house is never clean as<br/>
it is?  I haven&#39;t had time to clean my bathroom in 2 weeks.  Not because it<br/>
doesn&#39;t need it but because I&#39;ve been busy doing other things.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be under the assumption that I have lots of time and the house<br/>
is in top-notch shape and I clean house just to fill empty space or to live<br/>
up to some Good Housekeeping standard.<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t the case.  This is a typical day at our house.  I got up at 6:00<br/>
this morning, talked to Danny (5) briefly.  I fed and milked 13 goats, I<br/>
packaged the milk for the &quot;failure to thrive&quot; baby that drinks it, I fixed<br/>
breakfast for 4 kids, took a shower and fixed breakfast for myself and am<br/>
checking emails while I&#39;m eating.  I will then go clean the kitchen, feed<br/>
the dogs, cat, deer and birds.  I will stop by the vets and pick up our dog<br/>
that died over the weekend.  We will have a ceremony to bury him.  I will<br/>
fix lunch and we will head to park day.  I will have to make sure that we<br/>
leave by 2:00 because Michelle&#39;s gymnastics class starts at 2:45.  I will<br/>
take her then run by the feed store to pick up goat feed.  Then I will run<br/>
by the house, pick up Danny for his gymnastics class at 3:30.  I will be<br/>
back at 4:30 to pick him up and drop Adriane off.  Then I will start dinner.<br/>
While I cook, I will ask the kids to make a sweep through the house to pick<br/>
up their stuff because it is now difficult to even walk through the living<br/>
room or any of the upstairs.  Clothes, toys, papers, blankets, toothbrushes,<br/>
etc. litter the floor of our home everyday.  Not sometimes, not in a couple<br/>
of rooms, but throughout the house.  We have tried lots of systems, such as<br/>
me helping in each room, whatever, but each system seems to take longer than<br/>
the one before it.  Dinner is late, kids are hungry, people are grumpy<br/>
because they can&#39;t find their stuff or worse, somebody stepped on it and<br/>
broke it.<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of kids, they have lots of activities and interests and stuff,<br/>
they have little &quot;organization&quot;, I have only so many hours in a day.<br/>
<br/>
You really seem to think that I&#39;m talking about a little clutter......a<br/>
little clutter is what we consider clean around here.  I&#39;m talking about the<br/>
kids regularly trash the house to where CPS would have a fit if they stopped<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
It is 9:15 am here.  The kids have already been riding bikes that are now in<br/>
the driveway behind the van and will need to be moved if we are to leave.<br/>
There are 3 blankets in the floor, about 20 cars in the living room, there<br/>
are markers and colors and paper on the table and in the floor of the dining<br/>
room,  the pillows are off the couch for a fort, there are cake crumbs and<br/>
chocolate smears all over the table, etc....and all but one of the kids has<br/>
been up less than 2 hours and most of that was spent with breakfast.  None<br/>
of it will be put away unless I do it or ask them to do it.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any real suggestions, I&#39;d gladly listen.....but asking the kids<br/>
to pick up after themselves once or twice a day so people can navigate the<br/>
house and so I will have time to help them with activities and projects<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem like coersion to me....it seems like simple respect.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving my stuff out to where it interferes with the activities of others<br/>
isn&#39;t respectful to adults or children.  If I needed dh to help me with<br/>
something and he was busy I would help him with something back if he asked<br/>
me.  Then if he did carry through and help me but I didn&#39;t carry through and<br/>
help him, I wouldn&#39;t see it as coersion if he reminded me of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240339631">I have a good size Br and it is cleaned first. It is also sometimes cleaned <br/>
at 10pm or on Saturday. <br/>
It&#39;s not about making them its about them wanting to help on their own.  Its <br/>
not about them growing up and hating to clean because someone forced, <br/>
threatened or whined about it. <br/>
 It happens and its possible to have a child that likes to assist sometimes. <br/>
My son is 12 and my daughter 4 they both help when they like but it makes a <br/>
difference. My 18 mo old helps wash bottles not because I shoved a bottle brush <br/>
and soap in his hand he does it because he likes to try it.<br/>
I also do not have neat tidy children, my house is turned up side down all <br/>
the time I just have bins and no more carpets.  I also have wall to wall stuff <br/>
and way too many toys so its not a situation of not much to pick up.  I have <br/>
plenty I just do it in spurts.<br/>

***************************************************** <br/>
&lt;&lt;Either I am posting particularly poorly or you are being particularly<br/>
obtuse.  How can I let the housework slide when the house is never clean as<br/>
it is?  I haven&#39;t had time to clean my bathroom in 2 weeks.  Not because it<br/>
doesn&#39;t need it but because I&#39;ve been busy doing other things.<br/>

I don&#39;t think that when you say the kids have required &quot;chores&quot; that <br/>
they have to do or else...., that people picture what you described <br/>
above - simply asking them to pick up after themselves once or twice a <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
So - just since you wondered aloud, I will say that I personally didn&#39;t <br/>
understand that that is what you were describing. I pictured a chore <br/>
chart and kids with regular required chores that had to get done or <br/>
you&#39;d say, &quot;Nope, you didn&#39;t empty all the trash cans this morning so <br/>
now I don&#39;t have time to read you a story.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Its hard to know how others will &quot;picture&quot; what we describe - we KNOW <br/>
what we mean and we assume that we&#39;re describing it accurately, but we <br/>
all see it through the lens of our own experience and what we see <br/>
around us.<br/>
<br/>
The people around here whose kids have required chores are not talking <br/>
about mom saying, &quot;Sweetie, I&#39;m running out of time and I really want <br/>
the dishwasher unloaded and reloaded so that we&#39;ll have clean dishes <br/>
later when we get home, so could you please get that done before it is <br/>
time for us to get going to 4H and soccer today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any sort of philosophical problem, like some people do <br/>
here, of expecting kids to help out, and help out in increasing amounts <br/>
as they get older. I have problems with inflexibility and putting a <br/>
house&#39;s needs before their needs and all that. And circumstances <br/>
determine a lot of how much help I&#39;d expect - when my then-16 and 17 yo <br/>
was going to college almost full time and working almost full time, I <br/>
didn&#39;t expect ANY housework out of her and I just cleaned up after her, <br/>
resigned to the fact that she was not going to get to it (not joyfully <br/>
- I am NOT there and that&#39;s probably my downfall).<br/>
<br/>
But, as much as I love my children, and I REALLY do, I&#39;m not THAT crazy <br/>
about some of the things I do for them - like sitting at the horse <br/>
stables for several hours, several times per week, while my 12 yo has <br/>
an absolute BLAST grooming and training and riding, etc. I do it for <br/>
her. I am with Julie in the sense that I see nothing wrong with <br/>
expecting some helping out in return. I could do a LOT less for my kids <br/>
and still be doing a whole lot more than most parents and I think maybe <br/>
that&#39;s what Julie is thinking, too?<br/>
<br/>
My kids are reasonably willing to help. They know I don&#39;t expect them <br/>
to jump up and help the instant I ask and they know that I just LOVE it <br/>
when they do something without even being asked (nothing warms my heart <br/>
more than hearing dishes being done when I have no idea who has decided <br/>
to do them &lt;G&gt;). They would definitely like the house to be more <br/>
orderly - they&#39;re at least as tired as I am of it being such a mess. So <br/>
- maybe its good I let it get this bad - they BELIEVE it that it can <br/>
happen and maybe won&#39;t want to let it happen again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570230385">&lt;&lt;when you say the kids have required chores they have to do or else that<br/>
this is what people picture...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, actually, I never said the kids had required chores.  I said they HAVE<br/>
to help out or there isn&#39;t time for extra fun stuff.  When another poster<br/>
stated that, a responding post called it a &quot;head game&quot;, like some sort of<br/>
black mail.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, it would depend on what I had asked the kids to do as to how I<br/>
would take a &quot;no&quot; response.  If I had asked Zach to mow (he likes to ride<br/>
the mower), it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal, so what.<br/>
<br/>
If I asked him to pick up his stuff out of the living room, I would want to<br/>
know why not, like is he still playing with it, does he have some plan I<br/>
don&#39;t know about, etc..<br/>
<br/>
If I reminded him to feed the goat that he begged me for and is getting<br/>
ribbons and money from youth contests who believe that he is taking care of<br/>
it, not me, he would need a reason or an alternate plan.  If he was going to<br/>
be gone that evening, no big deal I would feed the goat.  If he wanted to<br/>
finish a game, so what do it later.  If he just didn&#39;t want to, we would<br/>
talk about his responsibility to the animal and if it continued to be a<br/>
problem and no one in the family was willing to take on the resonsibility, I<br/>
would seriously consider selling the animal.  It deserves better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just read in another post that you have something like 13 goats <br/>
which you feed and take care of, as well as other animals.<br/>
Why would feeding one extra goat (your son&#39;s) such a huge difference <br/>
in your routine that you&#39;d need to sell that one goat- the one your <br/>
son begged for?  Why would he need to beg for one in the first place <br/>
if you already had 13 of them?  How old is your son?<br/>

Jayn is recently 4. She has little interest in putting her toys away. I ask<br/>
if I can do it and invite her to help me. She sometimes does, but usually I<br/>
do it for her. Sometimes she asks me to leave the things out because she is<br/>
going back to them. Sometimes she helps to just move the pile out of the<br/>
walkway. <br/>
<br/>
However she loves cleaning. Yesterday, after I cooked breakfast, she cleaned<br/>
all the surfaces in the kitchen with a soapy wet scrubbing brush and a damp<br/>

&gt;I just read in another post that you have something like 13 goats<br/>

&gt;Why would feeding one extra goat (your son&#39;s) such a huge difference<br/>
&gt;in your routine that you&#39;d need to sell that one goat- the one your<br/>

that he&#39;s the one looking after it. If he doesn&#39;t look after it, he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t deserve the prizes and money. I made the same deal with my son <br/>
when he wanted to enter chickens and rabbits in the Fall Fair. I had to <br/>
sign a form saying that all his entries were done by him, and that included <br/>
looking after any animals entered.<br/>

across much firmer than your examples below. Black mail is a good one also. <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Well, actually, I never said the kids had required chores.  I said they <br/>
HAVE<br/>
to help out or there isn&#39;t time for extra fun stuff.  When another poster<br/>
stated that, a responding post called it a &quot;head game&quot;, like some sort of<br/>
black mail.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, it would depend on what I had asked the kids to do as to how I<br/>
would take a &quot;no&quot; response.  If I had asked Zach to mow (he likes to ride<br/>
the mower), it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal, so what.<br/>
<br/>
If I asked him to pick up his stuff out of the living room, I would want to<br/>
know why not, like is he still playing with it, does he have some plan I<br/>
don&#39;t know about, etc..<br/>
<br/>
If I reminded him to feed the goat that he begged me for and is getting<br/>
ribbons and money from youth contests who believe that he is taking care of<br/>
it, not me, he would need a reason or an alternate plan.  If he was going to<br/>
be gone that evening, no big deal I would feed the goat.  If he wanted to<br/>
finish a game, so what do it later.  If he just didn&#39;t want to, we would<br/>
talk about his responsibility to the animal and if it continued to be a<br/>
problem and no one in the family was willing to take on the resonsibility, I<br/>
would seriously consider selling the animal.  It deserves better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924835881">The goats started as my daughter&#39;s 4-H project.  She fell in love with them<br/>
and so did I.  It has been something we have done together.  I feed and milk<br/>
in the mornings because my daughter likes to sleep late and she feeds them<br/>
in the evenings.  As part of the 4-H project, she shows the goats in shows,<br/>
earns hundreds of dollars competing against other youth throughout the<br/>
state.  In my mind, it would be cheating if I took care of the goats and the<br/>
kids competed in contests against other kids.  The entire point is the kids<br/>
are supposed to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Zach wanted to go to get the money.  He begged to show animals.  I was<br/>
unsure that he was ready for the responsibility but he was sure he was.  So<br/>
we got the goat.  She is not a good milker, not a particularly good breed<br/>
doe.  She does cost a fair amount to feed each month.  Zach loved the money<br/>
and ribbons.  Got to where he didn&#39;t want to go out to feed her.  I already<br/>
did all the cleaning of stalls, hoof care, etc..  Zach was well aware of<br/>
what was involved because his sister and I had had goats for several years.<br/>
<br/>
So after talking with Zach, where he repeatedly agreed that he should<br/>
partake in Belle&#39;s care if he wanted to win contests based on his care of<br/>
her, he repeatedly would stall, whine, etc. about feeding her.  So we talked<br/>
and I took over all of her care and Zach quit participating in the contests.<br/>
<br/>
Then Adriane came home with some big money and Zach was all ready to show<br/>
goats again.  I attempted to talk him out of it, reminding him of how he<br/>
enjoyed the money but not the work.  He repeatedly said that he was now<br/>
ready.  So Belle was returned to his care and to his credit, Zach has done<br/>
well.  No complaining.<br/>
<br/>
I would consider selling Belle because she isn&#39;t a goat that adds to the<br/>
herd and we are now a money making enterprize.  I am not interested in<br/>
having a pet goat.<br/>
<br/>
Zach is almost 11.  He has several other animals that he has cared for for<br/>
several years, no problem.  If goats aren&#39;t his thing, that&#39;s fine.  If<br/>
someone else in the family chooses to take on that responsibility, that&#39;s<br/>
fine.  It&#39;s not something I would choose to take on.<br/>
<br/>
It is no different than if your son was taking piano lessons and he never<br/>
wanted to go to his lessons or to touch the piano.  I doubt you would want<br/>
to keep paying the teacher.<br/>

I understand why she&#39;d point out that if he wasn&#39;t willing to care <br/>

But I still don&#39;t see why she&#39;d have to sell the animal due to an <br/>
inability to care for it if there are already 13 goats being cared <br/>
for.  If goat care is a part of the routine already, then what&#39;s one <br/>
more if that particular goat is important to her son?  That&#39;s what I <br/>
was wondering.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343815910">&lt;&lt;it comes across much firmer than your examples now&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone posted a bit back about how we see information through our own<br/>
experiential filters.  I grew up in a very flexible home but I always had<br/>
&quot;chores&quot;.  Stuff that I needed to get done, stuff I was responsible for.  I<br/>
never had the chore chart and a mother standing over me with a whip.  Just<br/>
stuff that needed to get done.  My mom worked full-time and had 3 kids.  My<br/>
dad worked 2 and often 3 jobs.  Stuff just needed to be done.<br/>
<br/>
That is the filter I see things through.  If the kids want to have time to<br/>
go to the movies, they HAVE to help me out.  If they don&#39;t want to go, then<br/>
I guess it is really a moot point.  But I&#39;m not holding it over their heads,<br/>
trying to force them to be a certain way.  It is just the way things are.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if I had grown up in a family such as many here describe with<br/>
intimidation, meanness, etc., the connotations of the word &quot;chore&quot; would be<br/>
different for me.  Perhaps the connotation of &quot;having to do something before<br/>
there is time to do something else&quot; would have a different connotation.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>

I understand that the point of the contests (I&#39;m assuming 4-H or some other <br/>
county/state type ag. thing) is to introduce, educate, and allow for ownership <br/>
and all its rewards. But you have this agreement with your daughter where she <br/>
is sleeping in and you are doing things for her that allow her to have show <br/>
quality goats where she wins awards, ribbons and money, based on what she does, <br/>
yet you are doing some of the work. You said it yourself that the point is <br/>
that the kids are supposed to do it. Why then the push for your son to do just <br/>
the opposite to get the same gratification as his sister?<br/>
################<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zach wanted to go to get the money.  He begged to show animals.  I was<br/>
unsure that he was ready for the responsibility but he was sure he was.  So<br/>
we got the goat.  She is not a good milker, not a particularly good breed<br/>

and ribbons.  Got to where he didn&#39;t want to go out to feed her.  I already<br/>
did all the cleaning of stalls, hoof care, etc..  Zach was well aware of<br/>
what was involved because his sister and I had had goats for several years.<br/>
#################<br/>
If the goat isn&#39;t a good addition then why not sell her and buy another that <br/>
would be? If your son is aware of the time and energy it takes to care for the <br/>
goat, yet still doesn&#39;t then why not sell? But if he is aware of all of the <br/>
above, yet you help his sister but expect him to go at it &quot;all by himself&quot; <br/>
because of the above point, then I don&#39;t get it. Why help his sister and not him? <br/>
Why does she get to reap the rewards and get to sleep in and he doesn&#39;t?<br/>
#################<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So after talking with Zach, where he repeatedly agreed that he should<br/>
partake in Belle&#39;s care if he wanted to win contests based on his care of<br/>
her, he repeatedly would stall, whine, etc. about feeding her.  So we talked<br/>
and I took over all of her care and Zach quit participating in the contests.<br/>

If I were a child, I would stall and whine too if someone else was getting <br/>
the better deal too. His sister gets to sleep in, he is expected to care for the <br/>
goat. You state that you do all the hoof care and grooming for your <br/>
daughter&#39;s and your goats, but you expect him to follow standards other than that. She <br/>
gets to take the animals to fair&#39;s and brings home awards and money for work <br/>
you have done and he doesn&#39;t. Exactly how fair is that? <br/>

Then Adriane came home with some big money and Zach was all ready to show<br/>
goats again.  I attempted to talk him out of it, reminding him of how he<br/>
enjoyed the money but not the work.  He repeatedly said that he was now<br/>
ready.  So Belle was returned to his care and to his credit, Zach has done<br/>
well.  No complaining.<br/>

Then if there is no complaining, what exactly is the problem? I&#39;m confused.<br/>
