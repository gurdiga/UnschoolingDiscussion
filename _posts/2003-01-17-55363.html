<div id="ygrps-yiv-385070705">We&#39;re still not sure what happened to create the majordomo <br/>
mess yesterday, but I&#39;m deleted 100+ blank messages from the <br/>
archives. Just so you know in case someone wonders about the <br/>
lapse in numerical order back there. <br/>
<br/>
Our sincerest apologies for the barrage of messages. Mr. <br/>
Majordomo has been banned from this list (thanks, Joyce!), and <br/>
hopefully that won&#39;t ever happen again. <br/>
<br/>
Just wish we knew *what* happened, as nobody seems to have <br/>
a clue. <br/>
