&gt; But I learned from the special features on the DVD that he changed the main <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; protagonist some.  The scene with the gun was transferred from one <br/>
&gt; character <br/>
&gt; to another.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

baseball. King loved it, and said he wished he&#39;d thought of it.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn, who in one of her few brushes with greatness, once spent several <br/>
hours with Stephen King as he signed books at a bookstore I was working at. <br/>
Then a couple years later I got to spend an entire afternoon with his wife <br/>
Tabitha when she came to sign at the bookstore I owned. Come to think of it, <br/>
Sandra really reminds me of Tabitha King...<br/>
