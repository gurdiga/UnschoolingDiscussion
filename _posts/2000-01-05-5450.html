<div id="ygrps-yiv-213212373">I am new to this list, and this is my first time to post.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed your site, Betsy.  Keep up the daily journal!!<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, will be reading it!<br/>
<br/>
I am a grandmother homeschooling our 6 yo grandson.  We have<br/>
guardianship of Kristopher and he has lived with us since<br/>
he was 14 months old.<br/>
<br/>
This is a real challenge for me - grandparents being parents is<br/>
difficult enough without taking on the task of schooling, too.<br/>
We are mostly &quot;unschooling&quot; - as we are faced with a very active,<br/>
stubborn, willful, but quite bright boy!  But, do I ever need the<br/>
ideas and support!!  We have recently joined a local Christian<br/>
homeschool co-op, but have yet to get involved.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate hearing from some of you on how to just get a<br/>
good start, types of projects to do with a 1st grader, etc..<br/>
He is doing well using his computer with the JumpStart and the<br/>
Reader/Math Rabbit programs.  We also has a fantastic Phonics program.<br/>
He loves science and is always asking to do &#39;experiments&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open for any and all suggestions - PLEASE!!!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to a great time on this list.<br/>
<br/>

Betsy -- your site is neat!  Keep it up!<br/>
<br/>
Projects to do w/a 1st grader??  What did you have in mind?  It sounds like <br/>
he is already doing a lot.  But .. lessons are a big hit around here (Tae <br/>
Kwon Do and music so far), outdoor things are wonderful -- there are a few <br/>
wonderful nature trails near us -- get in a good hike and maybe even see <br/>
something new, we got the Magna Doodle for 5 yo sis but it has come in handy <br/>
for quick math lessons for 6 1/2 yo son, library book sales and a dollar and <br/>
instructions to &quot;pick out whatever you want&quot; was a big hit, we get the <br/>
Science Experiment of the Week from R. Krampf over the internet every Monday <br/>
and it is very doable (you probably have the stuff you need at home already), <br/>
board games (Monopoly has been the best so far), visits to the local park, <br/>
the Oceanographic museum was fun, he got his own (35mm but cheap) camera this <br/>
Christmas, etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
This is actually a very fun age.  They never stop moving!  But it&#39;s fun.<br/>

Nance, Can you send the URL for this please?<br/>

The darn trouble with cleaning the house is it gets dirty the next day<br/>
anyway,<br/>
so skip a week if you have to.  The children are the most important<br/>
thing.<br/>
