<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789370282">I seem to be trying to explain my *new* understanding of unschooling <br/>
in a verbal, logical sense (very left-brained).  O.K. so here&#39;s my <br/>
latest.<br/>
<br/>
When we first started homeschooling, I felt that my responsibility <br/>
was to help my children become well educated.  Education, the <br/>
definition of which is &quot;formal schooling at an institution of <br/>
learning&quot;, &quot;systematic study of the methods and theories of teaching <br/>
and learning&quot;.  For the longest time I was trying to unschool an <br/>
education.  No wonder I was so confused!<br/>
<br/>
I now realize my goal has *always* been to have children that loved <br/>
learning and would carry that love with them into adulthood.  This <br/>
realization has completely changed the way I feel about our day to <br/>
day life.  I&#39;m no longer worried, I&#39;m no longer depressed.  How <br/>
wonderful life can be with my children now.  We can go about our <br/>
lives enjoying learning, enjoying life.<br/>
<br/>
I used to think my daughters needed a college education to get a job, <br/>
that they needed to be prepared so they could get into college.  I <br/>
now think of college as a place where my daughters will have the <br/>
opportunity to learn things they *want* to learn.  It is not just a <br/>
means to an end.  It is not a meal ticket.  College is an experience <br/>
to be enjoyed if one chooses to go that route.<br/>
<br/>
I feel much better now.  If you are going to blast my new <br/>
understanding, please let me down gently.<br/>

Brilliant, Pat. Thanks for a nice lift to my day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522502030">Good morning to all. My name is Cris & we are in our second year of<br/>
unschooling. (well, still in the learning stages of unschooling) I really<br/>
enjoy reading the threads. Thank you all for throwing out your support to us<br/>
newbies.<br/>
(Hi Ren, thanks for pointing us to Always Learning)<br/>
<br/>
My two owls are still fighting the bad aliens, it&#39;s turning out to be quite<br/>
a long battle. I am staying up with them so we can all be on the same<br/>
schedule. I was hoping my son would get the &quot;get-up-at-sunrise-gene&quot; from me<br/>
instead of the &quot;stay-up-till-sunrise&quot; from his dad. But hey, at least he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have any cavities!  He did get that from me. ; )<br/>
<br/>
Well, I just wanted to introduce myself & thank all of you.<br/>
Have a great day today.<br/>
<br/>
Cris</div>

Hi Cris,<br/>
I always enjoy you and Marks messages!! You radicals, you....<br/>
Glad you&#39;re here, it&#39;s a great place when you don&#39;t have unschoolers nearby.<br/>
I&#39;m in the same boat with a couple of night owls, thought I was one but these <br/>
two can make it until 2am some nights...ugh.<br/>
