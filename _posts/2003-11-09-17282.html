Roots and Shoots?  I am really interested in their<br/>
program and contemplating trying to get a group<br/>
together locally.  <br/>
<br/>
When I looked into it before I did not see a way to<br/>
get a hold of a handbook, or anything like that, to<br/>
really look into what they were like.  I ruled out<br/>
Campfire due to certain policies in their handbook<br/>
which are pro-school and pro-child training and<br/>
politics.  There are no local groups available for my<br/>
boys of any kind, (except a certain paramilitary<br/>
organization which is everywhere) and so whatever we<br/>
decide to get behind, if anything, I want to make sure<br/>
their policies and our beliefs don&#39;t collide head on. <br/>
The less politics and indoctrination the better.<br/>

Norma, here.  Back from our great weekend adventure under the stars <br/>
and the beautiful total lunar eclipse.  We just had the Jane Goodall <br/>
exhibit at our Museum Center so we had recently learned all about <br/>
Roots and Shoots.  Here is the web site with all the information:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/">http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/</a><br/>
<br/>
It is pretty basic, not much indoctrination at all.  There are a <br/>
bunch of links at the bottom of the web page on how to start <br/>
something in your area.    <br/>
<br/>
Another great organization to get behind is The Heifer Project.  If <br/>
you aren&#39;t familiar with them check them out at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heifer.org">http://www.heifer.org</a><br/>
Lots of learning potential with this organization.  Kids love to find <br/>
out about the animals, even visit farms where they can learn more.  <br/>
One year we visited a great high-tech dairy goat farm as part of our <br/>
involvement in The Heifer Project, buying some dairy goats for a <br/>
family.  Then another year we visited a dairy farm that had different <br/>
animals and happened into one barn just at the moment when a doe was <br/>
kidding, two kids!  Wow!  Our homeschoolers watched every last moment <br/>
of it all.  Great biology lesson.  Another year when we were buying <br/>
sheep we had volunteers from the local Weavers Guild come and talk to <br/>
us about sheep, bringing samples of sheep&#39;s milk and sheep&#39;s cheese, <br/>
as well as fleece for us to card and spin from a drop spindle.  <br/>
Neat!  The bees could be interesting, too, visiting an apiary, but we <br/>
haven&#39;t done that yet.   <br/>
<br/>
And then there are the Spiral Scouts.  I am not much into <br/>
organizations that require uniforms, and Spiral Scouts do, so we <br/>
declined this one, but it certainly is not paramilitary, by any <br/>
stretch of the imagination.  To learn more go to:   <br/>

<br/>
Last, but not least, is 4-H.  You can usually start your own club <br/>
with only two kids.  And whether or not your kids go to the fairs or <br/>
participate in the countywide activities is up to you and them.  Up <br/>
to a point it is good.  In some parts of the country it is better <br/>
than others.  But 4-H even has college scholarships and a exchange <br/>
programs with other countries, too.   We loved creating our own self-<br/>
determined projects, as much as any of the ones offered in our state <br/>
project catalog.  For info for your area check out:  <br/>

Yeah, and the other things on the list were great.  But I can&#39;t imagine what <br/>
anyone found in Camp Fire that was &quot;indoctrinating&quot;.  I&#39;ve found Camp Fire to <br/>
be very flexible and easy to tailor to a particular mindset or objective.  <br/>
Tolerant and diverse.  No one&#39;s breathing down your neck to make sure you&#39;re <br/>
doing it &quot;right&quot;.  The first part of the Camp Fire law is &quot;Worship God&quot;, but I <br/>
know many clubs just leave it out.  Camp Fire has been around for a very long <br/>
time.  It has a lot to offer.<br/>
