 </span></blockquote>I have a 15 yr old and she plans to attend college. <br/>
Preparation? She&#39;s reading a lot in her area of interest as well as <br/>
entering the local community college in the fall. The reason she&#39;s <br/>
going to the community college first is to bypass the portfolios, <br/>
transcripts, etc to some degree. We will still have to provide them <br/>
with a sketchy outline of what she&#39;s been learning, which we <br/>
will &#39;create&#39; soon, but the transition into the university will be <br/>
simplified by moving from the Community College to the university <br/>
rather than straight from our unschooling home to the university. The <br/>
University will be looking in their traditional way (grades, scores, <br/>
GPA&#39;s) to determine the abilities of my child. Some schools are very <br/>
open to hs&#39;ed kids and their refreshing interests in learning. Still, <br/>
I want to be on the safe side and have both under our belts... the <br/>
refreshing as well as the &#39;traditional&#39; so that we don&#39;t risk not <br/>
getting in.<br/>
Simply put, I feel the baby step of going to the CC is just an easy <br/>
way of easing into the University.</div>

It&#39;s also a way for her to decide whether she really wants to go to the <br/>
university without the big expense and potential &quot;dropping out&quot; stigma if she <br/>
goes from zero to 18 hours all at once.<br/>
<br/>
Californians are really lucky with their state community college system.  In <br/>
Albuquerque we have a technical/vocational school which has some basic <br/>
classes which can transfer to the university, but it&#39;s neither free nor as <br/>
cushy and comprehensive as California&#39;s.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Bob...<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 daughters. Two are in college now. The 14 yo started this semester <br/>
at community college - she will have 9 unites completed at the end of the <br/>
semester. The 17 yo has 60 plus units completed already and is planning to <br/>
transfer to a UC in the winter quarter of next year - she has already met <br/>
with the UC Santa Cruz admissions officer and has been guaranteed admission <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I can give you more details about transcripts, tests, etc.  - need to run <br/>
now, but will get back to it later.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest, however, that one of your best resources in California is <br/>
Wes Beach who has a wonderful booklet that you can buy through the HomeSchool <br/>
Association of California - it has sample transcripts, for unschoolers and <br/>
others, and lots of information specifically for California colleges and <br/>
universities.<br/>
<br/>
Go to www.hsc.org and look around - you&#39;ll find it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s probably a lot different now, but when I went to a community college <br/>
in California (a *long* time ago) you could just start taking the <br/>
university transfer courses.  They were supposed to be the same, more or <br/>
less, as the ones you would take at the university.  You didn&#39;t have to <br/>
&quot;make up&quot; the high school stuff you missed if you went to one of the state <br/>
colleges, but that&#39;s probably different since they made it all into one <br/>
system.  (And I found that most first and second year university courses <br/>
were just harder versions of the ones you had to take in high school.  I <br/>
had no trouble with any of them even though I &quot;rose up&quot; (dropped out) out <br/>
of high school to go to the college.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; No units get transferred from a high school to a college/university<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lynda,<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s right. High school units are simply for graduation, and I suppose <br/>
other things. <br/>
<br/>
And by the way, yes, I was the resident right wing extremist Christian white <br/>
male at that other list. But I&#39;ve mellowed with age; plus, I have another <br/>
list that I can bitch and moan at (poor them!). <br/>
<br/>
If you remember, I play drums for a living. For the past couple years or so <br/>
I&#39;ve traveled quite a bit and thus have often left my kids (12 and 8) pretty <br/>
much on their own (with the help of an extremely expensive sitter service -- <br/>
and my wife). Unschooling tends to work its way into our lives regardless of <br/>
what we do, and it&#39;s a good thing I&#39;ve been reading about it for years. <br/>
Actually, I stumbled upon it long before I knew I&#39;d ever be married or have <br/>
kids. When I&#39;m gone, the kids get excited because they are on their own when <br/>
it comes to school (though they DO miss me ... I hope).<br/>
<br/>
A long and boring story as an example: I just finished a two week gig in <br/>
Rancho Mirage, CA, and I brought the kids with me for much of it, because <br/>
it&#39;s beautiful and I didn&#39;t want to spend our life savings on hiring a <br/>
sitter, and I truly wanted to hang with them somewhere other than home. <br/>
<br/>
During my time out I usually bring along stacks of books and magazines -- <br/>
including HEM. During this most recent trip I really got into reading it more <br/>
than anything else I brought along. But I also brought a book called <br/>
&quot;Deschooling Our Lives,&quot; which you&#39;re probably familiar with, and found <br/>
myself reading it during the gig! These two reads were perfect for this trip, <br/>
for my kids were doing no school while they were with me, but were rather <br/>
playing in the pool, studying lines for a play, and learning to hang out <br/>
together in a strange -- yet lovely -- hotel room, and having the time of <br/>
their lives pretty much on their own (I was basically down the hall in the <br/>
ballroom). Unschooling was what they needed, and was what I needed to be <br/>
reading about to calm my nerves.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, I am a desperate fan of Grace Llewellyn, et al. but I&#39;m also a <br/>
devoted student of Albert Jay Nock, Jacques Barzun, and anyone ever caught up <br/>
in what may be called &quot;the humane life.&quot; But for them and me this usually <br/>
means Western Civilization (don&#39;t kill me just yet), or at least the periodic <br/>
bursts of humanity that occasionally brake through this &quot;civilization&quot; (and I <br/>
don&#39;t mean to deny the bursts of light in other civilizations -- possibly <br/>
even greater bursts. But the West is my civilization, even as its history <br/>
bewilders, offends, disappoints, and shocks). <br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Nock was unschooled until he hit college, and then it was Greek, <br/>
Greek, and more Greek. He claimed to be a philosophical anarchist, and though <br/>
he&#39;d never want responsibility for such a thing, he is the perfect paradigm <br/>
for unschoolers who tend toward the Western tradition. I can&#39;t call myself <br/>
that just yet, but I&#39;m trying. Really. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sorry for rambling. I&#39;m hanging at this list because beside my <br/>
Western paternalistic Christian power trip, I really dig unschooling and am <br/>
truly working at letting it have its way. <br/>
<br/>
Plus, my kids may want to go to college someday, and because I don&#39;t like to <br/>
play the state legal game if I can help it, I&#39;m trying to find options for <br/>
them for high school; you know, getting them into college -- if they wish -- <br/>
without destroying them before they have that chance.<br/>
<br/>

transferable course, such as English 101 or Economics 100, they get regular <br/>
college credit for it. Doesn&#39;t matter if they are under age.<br/>
<br/>
However, there are occasionally some private colleges that have weird little <br/>
twists to their requirements - there is no &quot;standard&quot; there. They might <br/>
decide not to count college courses taken before the student was officially <br/>
graduated from high school, for example.<br/>

Thank you, this indeed seems like a twist. Rules, rules, rules....<br/>

(Advanced Placement) courses and then takes a special test required-those <br/>
credits count towards both the child&#39;s high school and college credits.  My <br/>
eldest daughter is in public school and that&#39;s the system there, anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m jumping in without knowing exactly what you were discussing.  Sorry <br/>
if that&#39;s the case.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The units don&#39;t get transferred exactly. What happens is that the college <br/>
will look at the score on the AP test and decide what they want to do with <br/>
it. MOST colleges let the kids skip the &quot;Intro&quot; course for that subject. If <br/>
they took the AP Microeconomics test and scored a 4 or 5 (out of 5), most <br/>
schools would let them skip taking Introductory Microeconomics -- they would <br/>
recognize that they&#39;d covered the material already -- and they usually would <br/>
give them units as if they&#39;d actually taken the course. They aren&#39;t really <br/>
transferring units from high school courses. Lots of kids take those high <br/>
school AP courses and don&#39;t take the AP test or don&#39;t score high enough to <br/>
get anything from the college. And kids can take the AP test without having <br/>
taken any of the courses in high school - homeschoolers can take AP tests. <br/>
And colleges make their own decisions about what to do with the test results <br/>
- some give credit for a 3, 4, or 5 -- some require at least a 4.<br/>

<br/>
That REALLY clarified things for me.  I need to ask more questions when I get <br/>
told things at the p.s., I guess.  I&#39;ll share this with my dd.  Thanks again.<br/>
