<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748316276">Big congratulations coming from Philadelphia!! I taught myself guitar when I was about 13 or so. I took lessons (or rather was forced to in music college) but they didn&#39;t teach me anything that I didn&#39;t already know. If you don&#39;t already have one, I would recommend picking up a book of guitar chords - they&#39;re easy to figure out and you&#39;ll be able to follow song sheets/fake books. Guitar tablature is also pretty easy to figure out - there are plenty of sites online to download this.<br/>

Happy picking!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901286725">Well, if your hands really hurt stop. I doubt strongly that they&#39;d actually bleed. The good news is that callouses do develop on the fingertips. Once they do, try to keep them intact. Prolonged exposure to water will make them fall off......so it&#39;s a good idea to wear rubber gloves for dishwashing and cleaning. <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if there&#39;s any music you need. My hubby and I are both Music Therapists and have tons and tons of music laying around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a &#39;sign of dedication&#39; amongst my daughter&#39;s musician friends to have <br/>
played until the skin on your fingertips wears off or bleeding <br/>
starts.  Literally.  Even my own darling daughter has achieved this &#39;high <br/>
honor&#39;!  As a non-musician I think it&#39;s a bit much, but it causes no long <br/>
term damage and seems to very much be a right of passage for them, so...<br/>
If you get to the point where they actually bleed, you&#39;ll have made that <br/>
right of passage too!<br/>
Congratulations (I think.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Way to go, Elissa!  And don&#39;t worry about your fingers bleeding.  Lots of<br/>
people learn to play without getting bleeding fingers.  When they start to<br/>
hurt, just play a little bit longer and you&#39;ll build up calluses (sp?).<br/>

Thanks for the dishwashing tips, I hadn&#39;t thought of that.<br/>
And also for the music offer! As soon as I can play more than 6 note, or as <br/>
of today 8 note songs, I&#39;ll let you know! &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590835446">My 2 older kids have both taught themselves guitar (accoustic, electric,<br/>
and bass) and they spend lots of time downloading guitar tabs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty impressive how much they have learnt and how good they are. I<br/>
came out of years of piano, flute and cello lessons and have to say that<br/>
they read music, have learnt faster and spend way more hours playing than I<br/>
ever used to. The oldest is even teaching himself music theory which is way<br/>
over my head:)<br/>
<br/>
He is in a band and they have their first gig next week so tension is high.<br/>
They&#39;ve made cds and it&#39;s even being sold at the local international school! <br/>

I first learned on an old blues guitar and the strings were NOT very near the <br/>

guitar).  YUCK!  So when I sold my clarinet and bought a flat-neck guitar <br/>

I only play occasionally now, and can only go an hour or so without some <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800184644">Hi --<br/>
<br/>
I come from a past steeped in organ and piano lessons (which I loved). Then went onto study music in college....the whole hard core classical training (shudder). Now I teach piano to make extra $$ and guess how my 5yo is learning piano? Teaching herself. I always thought she &quot;should&quot; learn an instrument that dh and I don&#39;t play, from someone other than DH and I....but now I&#39;m just so happy for the kid (and for my intact pocketbook). Once in a while she&#39;ll ask for a &quot;lesson&quot; -- which consists of me showing her something. But she generally kicks me off the piano bench pretty quickly to get back to her own thing. <br/>
<br/>
I think the most wonderful thing about teaching oneself anything at any age is that the individual really owns the accomplishment. Where my piano playing has many influences....my daughters has very few -- and I think there&#39;s something special about that.<br/>

  My 2 older kids have both taught themselves guitar (accoustic, electric,<br/>
  and bass) and they spend lots of time downloading guitar tabs.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s pretty impressive how much they have learnt and how good they are. I<br/>
  came out of years of piano, flute and cello lessons and have to say that<br/>
  they read music, have learnt faster and spend way more hours playing than I<br/>
  ever used to. The oldest is even teaching himself music theory which is way<br/>
  over my head:)<br/>
<br/>
  He is in a band and they have their first gig next week so tension is high.<br/>
  They&#39;ve made cds and it&#39;s even being sold at the local international school! <br/>

  &gt;    Big congratulations coming from Philadelphia!! I taught myself guitar<br/>
  &gt;when I was about 13 or so. I took lessons (or rather was forced to in music<br/>
  &gt;college) but they didn&#39;t teach me anything that I didn&#39;t already know. If<br/>
  &gt;you don&#39;t already have one, I would recommend picking up a book of guitar<br/>
  &gt;chords - they&#39;re easy to figure out and you&#39;ll be able to follow song<br/>
  &gt;sheets/fake books. Guitar tablature is also pretty easy to figure out -<br/>
  &gt;there are plenty of sites online to download this.<br/>

  &gt; Happy picking!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917412142">Oh -- one more thing re: blisters, pain.....<br/>
<br/>
Electric guitars are really nice to play. The action of the strings is much lower, bar chords are a true breeze, and you can ROCK!! You can pick up a pretty cheap electric for under a hundred.....a small cheap amplifier should be in the same ballpark. Also, classical guitars are also easier to play than steel strings because the strings are made of nylon. If you use light gauge strings on your steel string guitar - it will be somewhat easier on the fingers than mediums or heavy gauge.<br/>

Happy picking!!<br/>

Oh good point!  I use light gauge steel.  <br/>
Nylon strings sound kinda dead to me, and also the necks are wider on <br/>

Well......If Marji goes after us (I can&#39;t imagine doing anything after <br/>

I suppose it would be entirely appropriate to have two older beginning <br/>
