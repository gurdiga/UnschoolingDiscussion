<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854263377">When I converse with my neighbors whose children are enrolled in our *wonderful* local schools, I explain that I chose to homeschool so that my children could learn at their own pace and benefit from a small student/teacher ratio, and now that we&#39;ve been homeschooling for awhile I have found that I enjoy learning along with my children.  I tell them that I don&#39;t homeschool because I think the schools are bad, but because I find the benefits of homeschooling are working well for my family.<br/>
<br/>
This is true, because when I began to homeschool I didn&#39;t think school was such a bad thing and I did start for the reasons stated above.  Now that I&#39;ve done more research, I do think that school is very bad for many children in many ways, but there isn&#39;t much point in going into that with people who are invested in the system.<br/>
