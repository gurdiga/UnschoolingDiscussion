at <br/>
all.   There&#39;s not even any reason to  unschool.   <br/>
<br/>
At no point does a parent get the opportunity to  &quot;recognize&quot; that nothing <br/>
they did while their children were growing up  affected what they did as <br/>
adults or <br/>
how they did it.<br/>
<br/>
Why would one  even want that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
This is the deal.  It&#39;s an issue that confuses me. I don&#39;t really  think that <br/>
parenting is not a factor at all.  It&#39;s just one of many.<br/>
 <br/>
John Hinkley&#39;s mother can&#39;t take any responsiblity for what her crazy son  <br/>
did.  There may have been things she could have done to mitigate his  craziness. <br/>
 But she can&#39;t predict the future.  Who can?  What  good does it do for her <br/>
to sit around and say, &quot;If only I&#39;d done x...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
When I hear about my son saving the life of a man whose horse and  carriage <br/>
ran under the path of a streetcar in Memphis a few weeks ago, do I get  to pat <br/>
myself on the back because I raised him well?  No.  I didn&#39;t do  anything to <br/>
make him like that or that would predict that he would be able to  act swiftly <br/>
and surely in an emergency situation.  It&#39;s all on him.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to take credit for the way my children turned out.   Although I <br/>
would feel guilty if my son did something like John Hinkley, I can&#39;t  be <br/>
blamed.  It&#39;s a dichotomy that I can&#39;t reconcile in my mind.  <br/>
 <br/>
I give my kids a happy and peaceful home.  I can&#39;t predict the  outcome.  So, <br/>
the day to day, the now, is what matters.  Unschooling  doesn&#39;t guarantee any <br/>
sort of result, except peace and happiness today.   Unschooling did not mold <br/>
my son into a lifesaver.  Not unschooling did not  mold John Hinkley into a <br/>
crazy person.  <br/>
 <br/>
So what does?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve just jumped into the whole world of the nature vs <br/>
nurture &quot;debate&quot; that scads of books, articles, websites, etc have <br/>
been wrangling over for years. It&#39;s not an either/or situation - <br/>
there&#39;s a person&#39;s built-in, unique &quot;wiring&quot;; there&#39;s the life <br/>
situations they are in (family of origin, etc); there&#39;s <br/>
environmental stuff; and probably lots of other things to factor in. <br/>
Some studies have indicated (right or wrong I can&#39;t say) that <br/>
Scandinavians (those actually living IN that area) are more prone to <br/>
depression - is it solely due to the long dark winters? does it only <br/>
affect those with an internal tendency to depression (some <br/>
biochemical thing) who live there? Is there something unique in the <br/>
overall social structure? Probably a whole combination mishmash of <br/>
things. Someone with a pre-disposition biochemically to depression <br/>
might do well in a gentle, caring, &quot;sunny&quot; family and area. Then <br/>
again maybe not. Same person in a &quot;dark&quot; area might commit suicide <br/>
or homicide. Then again maybe not. Just like someone with a genetic <br/>
predisposition to high cholesterol would do well to eat properly but <br/>
that still might not keep their cholesterol levels down, they might <br/>
need medication too. And even eating right and medication (and <br/>
proper health care and such) might not keep them from having a heart <br/>
attack at age 35. Then again it could.</div>

Was she worshipping movie star magazines instead of paying attention to him?<br/>

<br/>
Every time I do something or another it affects things.   If I just kick back <br/>
and watch movies all the time (which I do, in spurts sometimes) it&#39;s having <br/>
an affect.   Maybe it&#39;s keeping me from being in a car wreck.   Maybe sometimes <br/>
it kept me from getting pregnant and having more kids than I could handle. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
   Maybe sometimes, though, I missed glorious sunsets and chances to go for <br/>
walks with Keith and the dog that I&#39;d love to have back someday.<br/>

And if I get that, what does John Hinkley&#39;s mother get?  Blame and  reflected <br/>

guilty?  Who in their right mind would blame his mother?  My  brothers and I were <br/>
raised in the same house.  One is a 47 year old  delinquent, one is a middle <br/>
manager making lots of money, and I&#39;m a person who  pays her bills and does <br/>
kind things for people.  How should my mother feel  about that?  <br/>
 <br/>
There seems to be a dichotomy that I can&#39;t quite put my finger on.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s more than nature vs. nurture.  That&#39;s too simplistic.  Too  many factors <br/>
involved.<br/>

Maybe it&#39;s that thing the Baptists (and others) talk about called  <br/>
&quot;freewill&quot;.  Just because they were raised in a way to NOT behave as a  murder doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean they won&#39;t use that &quot;freewill&quot; to do something wrong.<br/>
 <br/>
Same as if you gave two of my children a nice $100 bill.  Each of them  would <br/>
do drastically different things with it, even though I raised them both in  <br/>
the same household.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So how would you have felt if your mother, who you have told us a lot <br/>
about over the years, had claimed responsibility for all the good stuff <br/>
you have done over the years? Your writing skills, your support skills, <br/>
your musical skills, your child raising skills? And heaps more good <br/>
stuff? If she said, &quot;well, hey! If I hadn&#39;t been a crap momma a lot of <br/>
the time you wouldn&#39;t have pulled yourself up by the bootlaces and <br/>
turned yourself into the cool person you are. I&#39;m claiming all the good <br/>
stuff to my credit, as well as any crap stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of my sons said to me once, &quot;When you blame yourself for my <br/>
mistakes, I feel like you are claiming all my good stuff too, and that <br/>
leaves me feeling like I&#39;m not a real person&quot; or words to that effect. <br/>
And I got to feeling that yeah, that&#39;s how I&#39;d been feeling about my <br/>
life too - like my dead mother still owned my life.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness I have these wonderful kids who have both insight and the <br/>
words to express it!  There&#39;s an old joke that goes, &#39;Insanity is <br/>
hereditary - you get it from your children.&#39;  Well, in my case it&#39;s the <br/>
other way around - living with my children and their wisdom has taught <br/>
me so much, and has helped me along my path to recovering my life from <br/>
the mother who assummed responsibility for it so many years ago. Maybe <br/>
one day I&#39;ll be able to say, &#39;sanity and serenity are hereditary - you <br/>
get them from your children.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can see how I have influenced my children, both for good and bad. <br/>
But I also see how each one has responded to me, and life, in their own <br/>
unique way, and how they form their own lives. They make mistakes of <br/>
their own: some original,  some that people make generation after <br/>
generation =sigh= . And they they do and say and think wonderful things. <br/>
My homeschooled / unschooled kids, despite my multitude of mistakes are <br/>
very &#39;self centred&#39; - but I don&#39;t mean that in the usual way. I mean <br/>
that each of them is very centred in himself, in his being. I&#39;m 54 and <br/>
still trying to get there, still a million years away from that. I&#39;ve <br/>
blamed my mother, blamed my teachers, blamed this, that and the other - <br/>
and given all the credit for the good stuff away as well. From my boys I <br/>
have started to learn to reclaim my self. But I&#39;ve got a long way to go.<br/>
<br/>
But I still won&#39;t write my book for fear of all the what ifs!  But hey, <br/>
Sandra, just because I can &#39;get over it&#39; doesn&#39;t mean to say you <br/>
shouldn&#39;t! Seriously though, I hope you do get over the what ifs and <br/>
write lots of books! But I do understand your fears and hesitations.<br/>

<br/>
Genetics.<br/>
<br/>
Plus possibly opportunity, motivation, natural tendencies, being firstborn, <br/>
being a Leo, having friends who were interesting, not chewing the paint off of <br/>

<br/>
Keith lives his life kind of in opposition to his mom, so we&#39;ve used that as <br/>
part of the model (in the fill-the-mold and take the imprint of what you want <br/>
it NOT to be way) of how we can try to avoid that pitfall with our kids.   We <br/>
want to give them choices in such a way that they don&#39;t feel that we &quot;won&quot; <br/>
with one choice and they lost.   It&#39;s not easy, but it seems worth a shot.<br/>

Thank you for not calling me a whiner.   You&#39;re so nice.   Come and sit by <br/>

YES!  Exactly!  I can&#39;t steal their thunder.  Or their  lightning.  It&#39;s not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315088368">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My  brothers and I were <br/>
raised in the same house.  One is a 47 year old  delinquent, one is a middle <br/>
manager making lots of money, and I&#39;m a person who  pays her bills and does <br/>
kind things for people.  How should my mother feel  about that?  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course I don&#39;t know the definitive answer to nature vs. nurture, but I did want to comment about being raised in the same household.  My sister and brother are 13 and 10 years older than I am.  We are VERY different.  We were all raised in the same household, but circumstances changed with each of us, as I think they always do.  My sister and brother were born when my parents were young and didn&#39;t have much money.  My dad was a teacher and my mom worked part time in childcare but mostly stayed at home.  My dad adored my sister, he really put her on a pedestal   He and my brother really clashed.  By the time I came along their marriage was failing and I didn&#39;t really see him much, though we did take trips all around New Mexico that I remember and cherish.  My mom adored all of her kids.  <br/>
When I was young my mom&#39;s views on children had changed lots, she became much more open minded.  She was probably a better mom to me than she was to my brother and sister.  She is MUCH better with my son than she was with me.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister married young, became an optometrist, and moved far away.  She was distant and selfish.  She never had kids.  She is now divorced, remarried, and is working on reconnecting with her family.  <br/>
<br/>
My brother married fairly young too, and stayed in Alamogordo, he is a mechanic.  He has 2 kids, a wife that I love like a sister (and get along with better than my sister), and though I disagree with some of his parenting philosophies, he is probably the best, most moral, most well-meaning, thoughtful man I know.  In many ways I strive to be more like him.  <br/>
<br/>
I was leading a fairly dangerous lifestyle in high school and college, got pregnant at 20, and realized what I was doing.  My son saved my life, really.  I have always been a single parent.  I tend to rebel, to always go against the grain.  I also tend to be overly sensitive (in the feelings get hurt easily sort of way, so is my son).  My son is the most important thing in the world to me, and I often end up pushing friends away because either I would rather be with him, or because I don&#39;t like their influence on him.  <br/>
<br/>
My long rambling point is that we all grew up in the same household, with the same parents, but were all raised very differently.  And we are all very different people.  Yes genetics had a lot to do with it, but so did our parents.   <br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that nature and nurture both play a part, but giving your children a warm, peaceful, loving household goes a long way towards creating warm, peaceful, loving adults.  <br/>

<br/>
***I don&#39;t usually write here, but this struck a cord with me and I <br/>
had to jump in, I&#39;m not sure why though. <br/>
<br/>
I had an &quot;issue&quot; (too long and boring for people not directly <br/>
involved to go into here) with my mom.  Usually when we <br/>
have &quot;issues&quot; she directly attacks my parenting.  Most recently she <br/>
wrote to me something like I think she did everything wrong as a <br/>
mother, and I am just doing everything opposite.  She said until I <br/>
turned 18, the way I was, what I did, etc. reflected on her.  Once I <br/>
turn 18, I was on my own as far as decision making goes.  And she no <br/>
longer feels any of that responsibility, and she is gratefulfor <br/>
that.  And she&#39;s so happy that what she said is true.  (Not a direct <br/>
quote, but almost...reworded from the email she sent me.)<br/>
<br/>
Correcting her parenting is not my goal, I am raising my kids the <br/>
way that feels right to me.  How I felt as a kid is not how I want <br/>
my kids to feel.  My relationship with my mom is not how I want my <br/>
relationship with my kids to be.  As far as turning 18...I think the <br/>
time my kids spend under 18 is the time I spend investing in them so <br/>
when they are grown adults (at whatever age they get to that point) <br/>
I will be happy with how they &quot;reflect&quot; on me.  Plus, I don&#39;t want <br/>
my kids to feel like once they turn *18* I&#39;m done with them; I&#39;ll <br/>
still be there for them. I feel like my mom is so happy to not feel <br/>
that responsibility because she does not approve or agree with the <br/>
choices I make and is happy her philosophy gives her <br/>
an &quot;out&quot;...which makes me sad, since those choices are part of who I <br/>
am.  <br/>
<br/>
On the topic being discussed, I see both points...both from a mother <br/>
and child standpoint.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another factor!   My sister and I have discussed this.   My dad died in the <br/>
late 70&#39;s.   He had been way nicer to me than to my sister.   She ended up <br/>
living with him after my parents divorced and he had remarried a woman not at ALL <br/>
like us, and she was always telling my sister to tie her hair back and dress <br/>
different, be/walk/eat/sit differently, and my dad backed the &quot;new mom&quot; up.   <br/>
Then they divorced, so my sister was totally torqued (she was 14/15 at the time <br/>
of all this) because my dad had been strict with her for nothing, for no one, <br/>
she felt.    <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile my mom had always favored my sister, from the time she was born, it <br/>
seemed to me.   She took her side over me consistently.   She called me &quot;a <br/>
daddy&#39;s girl,&quot; and not in a nice tone of voice.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we had some discussion here about how very much Marty is like <br/>
Keith.   &quot;Kirby has always    looked more like you,&quot; Keith&#39;s mom said.    Well, he <br/>
looks like Keith too, until Marty shows up and REALLY looks like Keith.   But <br/>
it&#39;s more than looks, it&#39;s temperament, biological conditions (similar skin, <br/>
bedwetting later than others which Keith also did, similar aches, both get <br/>
athlete&#39;s foot and the other kids never have, both introverts, both left <br/>
handed...)<br/>
<br/>
We have a non-related friend who&#39;s mostly friends with me, and one day when <br/>
we were talking about my kids I told him I couldn&#39;t help but like Marty a lot <br/>
because he was so much like a cute young Keith, and the friend   said he&#39;d <br/>
alwas liked Kirby because Kirby was so much like me.<br/>
<br/>
That sort of business probably has an effect even when the parent can&#39;t see <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose parents divorced bitterly, and the mom actively hated <br/>
the father.   Poor Kid was (as Marty is to Keith) nearly a clone, and as he got <br/>
older and his beard came in like his dads and his voice came to sound like <br/>
his dad&#39;s, his mom started treating him worse.<br/>
<br/>
I was briefly married into a family with six kids.   I married #2, because <br/>
the parents died and his youngest brother and sister were young, 10 and 12 and <br/>
were going to be taken away from him because though he had already been their <br/>
caretaker for a while, but he was 23 and not married and the judge was going to <br/>
deny custody.     The two oldest had been born while the parents were college <br/>
students in Albuquerque in the 50s&#39;.   The second two had been born when the <br/>
parents were living in Las Vegas and working not-so-great jobs.   The dad was <br/>
fixing vending machines and pinball machines and the mom was home with the <br/>
kids.    Then the mom started teaching, the dad went back to school and got an <br/>
engineering degree, got a good job at Los Alamos National Laboratories, they had <br/>
two more kids, bought a cool old six acre farm with a funky-cool house and <br/>
started living like moneyed liberals (&quot;rich hippies,&quot; basically).   By then the <br/>
dad was drinking quite a bit.   Too much.   The mom was rarely home, as she <br/>
taught at some distance, and the older boys took care of the younger kids, more <br/>
or less.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the most extreme &quot;the same family&quot; I&#39;ve ever seen.   Then the dad died <br/>
in a runway plane accident on government business, so they got double the <br/>
insurance money, plus there was other settlement money from the airplane <br/>
manufacturor, and suddenly the mom could buy a sailboat and a Checker station wagon <br/>
(new, when those were available) and life got pretty cool until she died from <br/>
complications of elective surgery (tummy tuck).    <br/>
<br/>
Should she have paid more attention to kids and not risked her life to look <br/>
younger?   She paid lots of attention to the older two.   She never risked her <br/>
life while the older four were young.    <br/>
<br/>
Even twins have different experiences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573552984">I&#39;m the youngest of four.  I grew up in one of those<br/>
&#39;we treat you kids equally&#39; households.  Uh-huh.  My<br/>
brilliant, stifled, abusive father who was never good<br/>
enough for HIS father made sure that we were treated<br/>
equally.  We were equally worthless, equally<br/>
ungrateful and equally treated to &#39;Get out of my<br/>
sight!&#39; (on a good day).<br/>
<br/>
My needy, domineering, martyr mother made sure that we<br/>
knew we were totally responsible for how my father<br/>
treated us and &#39;Why can&#39;t you just be good kids and do<br/>
what you&#39;re told?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The result of this &#39;equal treatment&#39;:  A 48 year-old<br/>
brother who may very well be a card-carrying neo-Nazi,<br/>
a 46 year-old brother who is always looking to score<br/>
the next big scam, and a 43 year-old sister whose been<br/>
married three times, has two kids less than a year<br/>
apart after getting &#39;accidentally&#39; pregnant by her<br/>
Christian biker boyfriend of six months, lives on<br/>
welfare and now has a house that my 70 year-old martyr<br/>
mom bought for her (yes, a 30-year mortgage...).<br/>
<br/>
My parents got divorced when I was 15-ish.  I married<br/>
a Catholic version of my dad when I was 19.  A year or<br/>
so later, my mother actually had me subpeonaed to<br/>
appear in court to force my dad to pay child support<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
My dad died three years ago.  We had a gap of about 7<br/>
years where we never spoke.  When we reintroduced<br/>
ourselves, I was an adult and he never treated me as<br/>
anything but who I am.  It was a pretty good couple of<br/>
years until he died.<br/>
<br/>
Me?  I just try to stay away from the rest of them<br/>
because they&#39;re nuts.  One day I will probably regret<br/>
it but I&#39;m committed to growing OUR family in a happy,<br/>
comfortable way and I can&#39;t figure out how to do that<br/>
if I keep letting them ensnare me in their madnesses. <br/>
My madnesses keep me plenty busy as it is!<br/>

my son into a lifesaver.   Not unschooling did not  mold John Hinkley into a<br/>
crazy  person. <br/>

***************************************<br/>
I thought I remember reading someplace that John Hinkley is a  <br/>
Schitzophrenic.  That MIGHT have a lot to do with how he turned  out......<br/>
 <br/>
I know that I made some poor choices with my two oldest daughters (who are  <br/>
on their own now).  I didn&#39;t teach them better about the dangers of getting  <br/>
too deep in debt....I didn&#39;t teach them how to budget better.  I have tried  <br/>
since they moved out to talk with them about it, and they are doing better, but  <br/>
I have one daughter who probably has about 10 credit cards maxed out.  I  <br/>
can&#39;t help but think if I had talked more with her about it when they were  <br/>
younger, or set a better example (we&#39;ve been up to our eyeballs in bills a few  <br/>
times) they&#39;d have some money in savings, and not having a harder time with  <br/>
bills.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son (17) just won the county 4H &quot;Hands&quot; award...the award for always  <br/>
pitching in, helping out without being asked, working hard.  He helped  build our <br/>
house (started when he was about 12) side by side with my  husband.  At times, <br/>
yeah, he HAD to help, but I can&#39;t begin to count the  times I looked outside <br/>
and they&#39;d be working together laughing about this or  that,...I KNOW that the <br/>
work he&#39;s done around here, mostly always with a good  attitude, has formed <br/>
him into who he is now.  Just like my daughters do  very well at their jobs and <br/>
college...probably because of not being burnt out in  public school.<br/>
 <br/>
I know that when I was working full time, trying to school them, stressing  <br/>
out, life was really hard and I wasn&#39;t a very nice person.  I know those  few <br/>
years have probably affected my kids, and I regret being in that  situation.  <br/>
It was more than I could handle.  <br/>
