<div id="ygrps-yiv-497399799">My daughter finally began calling us Mommy and Daddy at 3 years or so old<br/>
but mixed the names up for quite a while and still sometimes.  She can&#39;t<br/>
draw a line from the &quot;A&quot; to the &quot;B&quot; or put a circle on the &quot;B&quot; or tell me if<br/>
there are two balls or three.<br/>
She can&#39;t really make a sentence yet.  We can&#39;t particularly communicate<br/>
with her because she doesn&#39;t understand much of what we say unless we use<br/>
the very few words in her vocabulary.<br/>
When she talks, we often can figure out what she wants but just as often, we<br/>
can&#39;t.<br/>
She spends a lot of her time throwing fits of frustration and being stubborn<br/>
about everything and anything.<br/>
She was raised as a baby very lovingly by both me and my husband.  She was<br/>
very pampered and never left to cry.  We just loved her to death.  But she<br/>
started acting this way at about 3 years old and I wonder if she isn&#39;t<br/>
autistic to some degree.  I have heard that this usually occurs at about 3<br/>
years.<br/>
Since that time, she has gone from being our very sweet loving baby to being<br/>
very difficult for anyone in the family to live with.  She spends a lot of<br/>
her time screaming at siblings.<br/>
If the kids take her outside for a walk, it becomes a big long screaming fit<br/>
for Michelle who isn&#39;t happy with anything at all particularly if it<br/>
involves the word &quot;no&quot;.  If we try to play with her, she is very likely to<br/>
grunt loudly at us defiantly and refuse to co-operate in anything.<br/>
I just don&#39;t know what to do with her.<br/>
I don&#39;t expect her to be like the gifted son and be a super child in her<br/>
abilities, but it would be nice if there was at least reasonable ability to<br/>
communicate with her.  I don&#39;t know how to work with her and help her and<br/>
there isn&#39;t a way to explain anything to her that she is upset and screaming<br/>
about.<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to be one of those mothers who labels her kid and has too much<br/>
expectation.  I just don&#39;t know if everything is okay with her or not.  If<br/>
more time and freedom to do her own thing is all she needs, that would be<br/>
great.  She is free to have it here.  I just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case<br/>
and am worried.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385363633">Kandice, afaik (and that&#39;s not saying much) autism usually shows <br/>
itself from birth, unless it&#39;s connected with an event, like a <br/>
vaccination, or a bout of measles.  I read an article about families <br/>
using homeopathy to tackle autism, focussing on figuring out what <br/>
the trigger had been.  Though there is a big developmental step <br/>
around 3-4yo, your instinct that something&#39;s more seriously amiss <br/>
could be correct.  If you can track back to an event from where <br/>
she began to go downhill, you may have a head-start.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck<br/>
Tracy<br/>
PS  while we&#39;re being medical, does anyone have any info on <br/>
fibroids?  treatment of them other than hysterectomy, preferably!  <br/>
TIA!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217790598">I DO believe there are problems with allergies.  Michelle also came up with<br/>
eczema last year and her cheeks were covered with red patches especially<br/>
after dinner every day.  Our Naturopath is helping with the allergies. <br/>
Michelle has had one treatment on the NAET program.  I&#39;ll be darned if her<br/>
speech didn&#39;t improve some the very next morning.  We still have 11<br/>
treatments to go.  maybe it will make a big difference in her communication<br/>
skills more as we continue ridding her of those allergies.  I hope so.  She<br/>
sure is a miserable kid.  :(<br/>
But just with the one treatment, the eczema is barely noticable anymore. :)<br/>

Blessings to you,<br/>
