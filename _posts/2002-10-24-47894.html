<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669376937">Oops, sorry for the previous post - I somehow sent Mary&#39;s post (below) along <br/>
again - it&#39;s definitely starting to feel like bedtime!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks you all for the great advice and insight. I think we are going to try <br/>
to find some older playmates for Kalie, and, with luck, some with the same <br/>
parenting attitudes we have. I&#39;m also going to try to help her interact a <br/>
little more easily, if that seems to be her desire, and shorten up playdates <br/>
a little/lot depending what&#39;s needed to keep her excitement/frustration from <br/>
building to a point that&#39;s not manageable for her right now.<br/>
<br/>
And a (another) question - are there any other parents of young &#39;only <br/>
children&#39; who might be willing to share how much interaction with other <br/>
children they seek/arrange access to for their child? Do you think the <br/>
one-on-one or small playgroup is critically important, or are group <br/>
activities like library storytime, etc, enough? We&#39;re having a tough time <br/>
finding playmates in our neighborhood - plenty of children, but most, if not <br/>
all, in daycare or preschool. I&#39;d love to know what others think on this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

I caught that your daughter was an only child a few posts ago. Sorry, I must <br/>
have missed that. And I think Joyce made the remark that maybe she want&#39;s to <br/>
interact but doesn&#39;t know how to go about it. Also when you said that the <br/>
kids aren&#39;t quite as vocal and such as she is, maybe she does want to play <br/>
but just doesn&#39;t get the kind of response she&#39;s looking for. That mixed with <br/>
boredom, again from not getting what she wants can add up to just kicking <br/>
someone out of frustration of it all. I can understand that. Maybe trying <br/>
some older kids would help.<br/>
<br/>
My Sierra happens to get along great with kids her age and older kids too <br/>
but just loves ones a bit younger than her. She has this mother thing she <br/>
does and plays really well with 4 and 5 year olds. My son and youngest <br/>
happen to like older kids more so but still get along great with kids the <br/>
same age or younger. It just seems like a preference they have right now.<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out in no time with all the great advice flying <br/>
around here.<br/>
Let us know how it goes.<br/>

I was *basically* an only child (5 yrs. between me and an older), and I <br/>
spent A LOT of time playing by myself. Even when I did have friends to play <br/>
with, it was only one or two at a time, and not an every day kind of thing. <br/>
So my *personal* opinion is that one-on-one time with other kids isn&#39;t that <br/>
important, as long as there is at least occasional (once a month?) contact <br/>
with other kids. Library time can be a good place to find them, if not, <br/>
there&#39;s always books to look at there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482469840">Joyce: Thanks for the input. We&#39;re hot on the trail of an unschooling <br/>
group now (I found them last night on the unschooling.com website), <br/>
and are also attempting to get involved with the local homeschooling <br/>
groups - these are great suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
We try to get to the playgroud at least every other day - we have 6 <br/>
or so within a few miles, but usually we&#39;re the only ones there. This <br/>
seems to be fine with Kalie, she loves the playground, although she <br/>
does seems to prefer it a bit when other children - particularly <br/>
older ones - are there.We spend lots of time at our library (a <br/>
terrific one, by the way - lots of children&#39;s activities),and as much <br/>
of that type of thing as we can....I think you&#39;ve all helped to set <br/>
my mind at ease - I guess we&#39;re doing fine!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797211299">I am also struggling with this,  <br/>
I was also pretty much an only child, 7 years between next sibling,  I also played on my own alot.  Herein lies my question,  I&#39;m wondering where can we draw the line on playdates and playing with kids.  <br/>
Let me explain, my mother rarely played with me, this is what I remember anyway, Ii remember wanting her to play with me, so I always feel like I have to be playing with my kids all the time.  Or when-ever they want someone over I go ahead and ask someone.   But, this isn&#39;t working right now,  especially with my 5dd.  I&#39;m feeling very overwhelmed and now I got a cold so she doesn&#39;t understand why I don&#39;t have the energy or patience for her.  I have tons of patience in the a.m. but in the evening I&#39;m dead tired and get grumpy.<br/>
 <br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions,  Do you think if I just play with her when ever she wants that eventually the neediness will eventually resolve itself?  Maybe its because before unschooling I wasn&#39;t always there for her, was trying to do everything else.   We are relatively new to this.  Just 6 months for total unschooling living.  Maybe I&#39;m being unrealistic that I think they&#39;ll be just &#39;fine&#39; already.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure some of this has been covered before but I just really need some reassurance and suggestions right now,  &lt;sad&gt;I really had a bad night with her last night. &lt;very sad&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Maybe I missed some of what you said, but is it possible to invite one or two <br/>
children over to play? Or take her to a friends house some?<br/>
Sounds like you need to find your space too. I don&#39;t think a Mom can continue <br/>
playing when she&#39;s exhausted or resentful, it&#39;s going to show.<br/>
You either have to shift your thinking and be joyful about it, or do the <br/>
things you need to do for getting yourself rested and happy again.<br/>
I&#39;d suggest playing with her a lot, giving a lot of focused attention when <br/>
you are alert and feeling good.<br/>
In the evening, since that is your &quot;down&quot; time, explain to her that you are <br/>
tired and need to stop playing now.<br/>
Respecting your own needs is important too. If it conflicts with her needs, <br/>
can&#39;t you find some other options for spending time with her that don&#39;t leave <br/>
you feeling exhausted?<br/>
Like watching movies together, or reading books?<br/>
Maybe cuddling in bed and just talking would meet her need for attention.<br/>
There isn&#39;t a magic pill, cure all here. But there are probably loads of <br/>
options, you just have to get creative. That doesn&#39;t mean ignoring your own <br/>
body signals though.<br/>

Sadly many parents choose pre-schools for their young children, because they believe they need the stimulation that pre-schools offer. The parents do not realise the importance of just being together. I realise this is an unschooling list, but I believe we would have a better world, if we could at least encourage parents to keep their young children home.<br/>
