<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126715636">One of my friends from HS has a son 6yo who is<br/>
in ps..kindergarden..appartently what they do<br/>
here is set up the class into &quot;stations&quot; and <br/>
the children rotate thru them..every day a different<br/>
station..Ie..math, art, music, freeplay...anyway to make<br/>
a long story shorter...She was complaining to me that her<br/>
son is soooooo bored in math...yet he can tell time,,add<br/>
subtract, do multiples of 5&#39;s ect....So I told her to find<br/>
activities that are more challanging for him to do...(she is basically<br/>
waiting for the school to pick up on his brightness in the<br/>
area of math)  Now my son is only going to be 3 so I don&#39;t<br/>
have a great knowledge base for suggestions to her in this area<br/>
Can someone chime in and give me afew to come back to her with..<br/>
I atleast got her to stop waiting for the school to pick up on <br/>
this and &quot;take the bull by the horns&quot;..So please any suggestions<br/>
will be of great help....<br/>
Ofcourse  then I started talking about unschooling and she just<br/>
kind of picked her jaw up off the floor...Anyway...thanks for<br/>
the help..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It can be so hard not to let a topic get you rolling on an unschooling<br/>
rant, because as parents we feel so passioately about it.  People&#39;s<br/>
passions tend to come through whether we intend them to or not.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a statement on the thinking of the mainstream american culture<br/>
that the schools will take care of everything, that our children are their<br/>
responsibility and they are the ones who should be picking up on their<br/>
abilities, special talents, interests, weak points, and tapping into them<br/>
in the best way possible.  I mean, they have the education, right?  They<br/>
have the specialized theories and testing methods to find things out, don&#39;t<br/>
they?  They have the experience right?  They know what they&#39;re doing, don&#39;t<br/>
they?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah right.<br/>
