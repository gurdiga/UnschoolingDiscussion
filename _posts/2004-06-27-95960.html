<div id="ygrps-yiv-194779297">Harriet went potty all by herself for 3 weeks at 18 months old.  She would<br/>
wake up in the morning totally dry and look at me and say &#39;poo-poo?&#39; And I<br/>
would get her to the potty and take her diaper off for her, and the same for<br/>
the rest of the day.  Then I got sick for awhile and it went out the window.<br/>
By the time she was 2 she *refused* to let me change her diaper or go potty.<br/>
The whole thing was a nightmare complete with huge ulcers all over her butt.<br/>
I finally had to hire someone to chase her down and get her wet pants off (<br/>
I was still sick).  If we had less carpet I would have just let her go naked<br/>
and let my husband mop the floor when he got home.<br/>
<br/>
With Crispin, I just begged my husband to just not even go there - no<br/>
pressure, no games, nothing.  If he asks to sit on the toilet, fabulous!  if<br/>
not, who cares.  We have &#39;big boy&#39; pants in his drawer if he wants them.<br/>
Once in a great while he does, but I even hate calling them &#39;big boy&#39; pants.<br/>
They are the thick crotch cotton pants, which I have decided are useless.<br/>
Harriet always just peed in them.  I ended up just buying her underwear<br/>
finally and put away all the diapers etc. and just brought lots of changes<br/>
of clothes with us where ever we went once I was *sure* she had the physical<br/>
ability to get to the toilet.  I figured if we were going to be battling no<br/>
matter what, might as well make it about the toilet rather than getting a<br/>
diaper on or off her.  I didn&#39;t &#39;punish&#39; her or anything for accidents, but<br/>
I did groan a lot. <br/>
<br/>
My plan was to let Crispin go naked butt this summer in the yard, but he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to be naked.  How did this happen?  I am *such* a naked person,<br/>
and our house is pretty nudity friendly, Harriet likes to be naked too.  I<br/>
guess he just needs to be himself, or different.  So I guess as long as the<br/>
diapers fit, he can wear them if he wants. ( we do cloth, Bumkins AIOs) I<br/>
figure when he is a little more verbal we can start looking at underpants<br/>
when we are at the store and see if he is interested in them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL Yeah, I remember stopping a numerous gas stations and convenience stores <br/>
for a few weeks when Wyl was getting used to the &quot;full bladder feeling&quot; <br/>
concept! Luckily, we always happened to have one nearby! Except for last week when <br/>
Dave was working on a drain clog in the bathroom and had the toilet removed <br/>
(Wyl&#39;s been trained for a couple years, now, but Dave was working on it for <br/>
hours!)-luckily he&#39;s a boy and could use the garden fence!! :~D<br/>

Peace,<br/>
