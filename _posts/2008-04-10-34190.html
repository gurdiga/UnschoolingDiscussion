--It makes me crazy when I hear a mom say &quot;They need to learn to work  <br/>
these things out for themselves.&quot; It&#39;s such cop-out, and such <br/>
disregard  for both the underdog kid AND the bullying kid, who is <br/>
learning clearly that  he can get away with what he can get away with, <br/>
and his mother isn&#39;t going  to interfere because she doesn&#39;t know or <br/>
care how to make  peace.--<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I have a group of friends who are firm believers in  letting the kids work it <br/>
out (our kids are 5 and younger).  I have never  felt good about that, and as <br/>
a result have earned the titles of the  Meddler, or the Overprotective One, <br/>
etc.  (The kids, on the other hand,  think of me as the Fun Mom, because I <br/>
actually spend a lot of time with them  when we&#39;re together.)  Frankly, until I <br/>
started coming here a few months  ago, I thought I *was* perhaps doing something <br/>
wrong even though  intuitively I felt I was on the right track. <br/>
 <br/>
Is there a page on your site, Sandra, that talks more  about this?  I find <br/>
myself tongue-tied and unable to really  express why I think it&#39;s so important <br/>
to intervene in certain  situations when our children are playing together.  <br/>
The other  moms very strongly feel -- and express -- that they think it&#39;s of  <br/>
utmost importance to let the kids work things out themselves -- &quot;how else  will <br/>
they learn?&quot;  I admit that I&#39;m not immune to the eye rolls and all the  other <br/>
nonverbals I get when I do intervene (am working on that), which makes me  <br/>
more tongue-tied.  What Sandra wrote offers a lot of information about what  is <br/>
at stake by not intervening... I&#39;d like to read more thoughts about this so  <br/>
perhaps I can better formulate and express myself with greater  confidence.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, in advance,<br/>

Yes.  And maybe ask those moms where they got that idea.  I bet it&#39;s  <br/>
one of those old voices in their heads, some grandma who didn&#39;t want  <br/>
to hike out to the field to keep her boys from fighting in 1942.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll name some things at stake and then give some links:<br/>
<br/>
safety<br/>
<br/>
trust<br/>
<br/>
relationship<br/>
<br/>
Also, those who commit violent acts (at home or at school or  <br/>
wherever) often report having been bullied.<br/>
<br/>
My mom sat smoking a cigarette and drinking coffee or beer with a  <br/>
friend or cousin, both of whom would tell us &quot;Stay outside,&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t tattle.&quot;  It was clearly lazy neglect.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do too!  Kids often have an incomplete picture and are unable or unwilling to gain clarity <br/>
of the situation.  A caring adult can do that, help with perspective and understanding so <br/>
that growth and compassion can come out of an ugly situation.  It takes an exceptionally <br/>
talented child at interpersonal interactions to pull that off at four years old.  I&#39;ve probably <br/>
seen it, but mostly I&#39;ve seen kids five and under acting out their own feelings of hurt, <br/>
anger, frustration and taking it out on the kids around them, because that&#39;s what kids <br/>
often do.  They don&#39;t have the empathy yet to really be able to shift into seeing someone <br/>
else&#39;s point of view until their own is completely heard, and when you&#39;ve got two in that <br/>
same boat trying to work it out alone, you generally have blow ups that are preventable or <br/>
fixable by an involved mom or two.<br/>
<br/>
These days playgroups are usually made of up like-age kids.  That is a school model.  <br/>
Playgroups with mixed ages are so much more functional in this area--sometimes some <br/>
of the older kids will help the younger kids solve problems before they even come to the <br/>
adults attention.  I wish I had known this sort of stuff when my kids were younger, <br/>
because we dealt with the same issues as you are--the blind leading the blind!  We were <br/>
all parents of young ones, and didn&#39;t have the perspective that comes from being around <br/>
older kids, and moms of older kids who can be models for what can work better.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that kids should work it out themselves can work o.k.--but only up until the <br/>
point that someone gets stuck.  You can always tell when it really isn&#39;t working anymore <br/>
and they need help--negotiations have fallen through and war is declared.  Nothing good <br/>
comes out of it for kids to keep going past this point.  They just learn that the strongest, <br/>
loudest or most hurt will get their way.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest seeing if you can find some other like-minded families to hang with if your <br/>
efforts to educate the other moms don&#39;t work--because you&#39;ll always be the odd-mom-<br/>
out if their views are that set.  And the other thing is, as the kids get older, you will find <br/>
that there will be more and more that you don&#39;t agree with.<br/>

<br/>
That argument has been made about online support of moms with young  <br/>
children only helping other moms of young children.  When the whole  <br/>
path can be lit at once, why huddle together at the mysterious entrance?<br/>
<br/>
I still have vivid memories of many incidents in my childhood.  I  <br/>
have a couple of memories from before I could talk; one before I  <br/>
could walk, maybe (or around that time.   I have LOTS of memories of  <br/>
childhood at home, at school, at relatives&#39; houses, all kinds of  <br/>
places where same-aged kids were expected to work it out and WORSE:   <br/>
punished for &quot;tattling.&quot;  So the second-level safety of calling for  <br/>
help or getting an adult was a second crime.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard &quot;Don&#39;t tell me your  <br/>
problems,&quot; or &quot;You probably asked for it&quot; or &quot;just ignore it&quot; or  <br/>
whatever all I would buy a Mac Air Book TODAY!<br/>
<br/>
When moms are only looking at three  year olds and the oldest other  <br/>
people they see are five, they&#39;re not planning very clearly very far  <br/>
ahead.<br/>

mothers&#39; minds about parenting issues like this.  If I were faced  <br/>
with your situation I would resolve f to at least assert that, &quot;I  <br/>
disagree and as far as my kids are concerned I will intervene.&quot;  Then  <br/>
I&#39;d keep a watchful eye and keen ear out so that I can step in early  <br/>
and often if necessary.  If the other mothers continued to criticize  <br/>
me or roll their eyes I&#39;d tell them that I had my own reasons and if  <br/>
they&#39;re interested in my perspective I can direct them to some  <br/>
reading (on Sandra&#39;s website or wherever else you may find support  <br/>
for parents helping children learn how to get along in society.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008921215">I actually said &quot;I am not getting involved&quot; today.  I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
said it 2 years ago, but today I was with my 11 year old and a 13 <br/>
year old who were in a disagreement.  I had seen the whole thing play <br/>
out and I didn&#39;t think I had a good opinion in the matter.  It never <br/>
got out of control and the 13yo friend just ended up letting it go.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think with too hard of feelings about it, but maybe with a <br/>
new perspective of my son.  It was a trade thing and my son had just <br/>
agreed to the trade with &quot;no trades back&quot; and then about 10 seconds <br/>
later said &quot;never mind, I don&#39;t want to trade&quot; (he was still holding <br/>
both items).  The friend was saying &quot;too late&quot;, my son was <br/>
saying, &quot;No. I changed my mind.&quot;<br/>
When I was asked to give my opinion, I felt it was better for me to <br/>
stay out of it, because I thought if I got involved it would take it <br/>
to another level.  Boys tend to not think like we girls and I would <br/>
probably have thrown out stuff they hadn&#39;t even considered and more <br/>
resentment may have set in.  The issue dropped with a distraction and <br/>
it didn&#39;t get brought back up.  <br/>
I have gotten involved and regretted it before.  As they get older, I <br/>
feel more comfortable letting them &quot;work it out&quot;.  Though, it&#39;s a <br/>
situational thing of course.<br/>
