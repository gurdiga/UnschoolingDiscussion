<div id="ygrps-yiv-153943173">OK, last thing I&#39;m saying about the bananas! <br/>
<br/>
My mother keeps her bananas on her kitchen counter. My son is over there at least a half an hour once a week on Sundays. He wants a banana because he can see them. He sometimes (if you like that word better) has one to eat, when one is offered. He is very good about not eating things he shouldn&#39;t but because bananas are a recent addition to what he can&#39;t have, he is having very understandable trouble turning them down. <br/>

  But you have changed what has been said and that&#39;s why some of us are very <br/>
  confused. We remember what you have said previoulsy and maybe you don&#39;t. You <br/>
  said your child goes over to your parents house every Sunday and that he <br/>
  usually has a banana because they are there on the counter. Now I remember <br/>
  you saying that your child understands what he can&#39;t have and has no problem <br/>
  with not having certain foods. So having a banana that is sitting there <br/>
  didn&#39;t make sense. Then it wasn&#39;t usually him having one but having one <br/>
  every 8 weeks. That&#39;s not usually when they are there once a week. The he <br/>
  was being offered banana&#39;s and doing great considering his age and someone <br/>
  tempting (my own word) him. Then he&#39;s not actually &quot;at&quot; their house but out <br/>
  with them. No wonder we&#39;re all confused. You just don&#39;t want to seem to <br/>
  acknowledge that your stories are changing.<br/>
