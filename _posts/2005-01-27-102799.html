<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512106042">Writing tends to be the number one concern of most of the homeschooling community <br/>
and as a result there are a bazillion bad writing programs on the market. Any writing <br/>
program designed by an educator will be awful.<br/>
<br/>
Skip those. Go straight for the books written by professional writers.<br/>
<br/>
Learn about writing for yourself first. Start a blog for yourself and get one of those great <br/>
books that gives you writing prompts.<br/>
<br/>
I really like _The Pocket Muse_ by, Monica Wood. Use her prompts. Discover the joy of <br/>
writing!<br/>
<br/>
I also love _Poemcrazy_ by Susan Goldsmith Wooldridge. Her first assignment is to make <br/>
word tickets and stick them all over your house! You have to read the book to get it, but it <br/>
was so much fun every kid in my family got into it. We wrote the most amazing poetry as a <br/>
result. Truly awesome, can&#39;t believe my kid wrote this, kind of poetry.<br/>
<br/>
And for grammar, try _Nitty Gritty Grammar_ and _More NItty Gritty Grammar_ by Edith <br/>
Fine and Judith Josephson. These are references that use synidcated cartoons to teach <br/>
grammar. So readable and easy to use. My oldest (at age 14) read the books straight <br/>
through just because they were entertaining!<br/>
<br/>
I also give lots of tips about natural writing on my blog:<br/>

And my Brave Writer website is filled with natural writing stuff for free!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a bit of a nut about this writing thing. We shouldn&#39;t be afraid to create a context that <br/>
encourages and supports growth in writing. Otoh, we don&#39;t want to crush our kids&#39; <br/>
attempts with a bunch of rules. So use your intuition to guide you and above all, enjoy <br/>
writing!<br/>

#3, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Reading and times table are in #1 and #2 slots.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you man #1 of those whose kids have learned to read and multiply. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And you forgot socialization.<br/>
And you forgot the prom.<br/>
