<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308670619">I consider myself a very conventional middle-of-the-road person, not nearly <br/>
as &quot;radical&quot; as some of my fellow list members, but I do believe deeply that <br/>
if women don&#39;t have the right to control what goes on in our own bodies, we <br/>
have no rights at all. And furthermore, as we work for responsible <br/>
stewardship of the earth, the first thing we need do is to try to keep the <br/>
human population (especially in the resource-gobbling Western nations) <br/>
growing as slowly as possible, and terminating pregnancies (as early as <br/>
possible, of course) along with other types of contraception, has to be an <br/>
option.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Anyway, the past is the past, what has<br/>
&gt;happened, happened. It is the horrors and<br/>
&gt;attrocities TODAY that need attention.<br/>
&gt;For example: child abuse ~ in it&#39;s most<br/>
&gt;heinous form - abortion . . . . and this<br/>
&gt;crosses ALL races! It doesn&#39;t matter if<br/>
&gt;you are black or white or native American<br/>
&gt;or whatever - all you have to be is tiny<br/>
&gt;and silent and hidden in your mother&#39;s<br/>
&gt;womb . . . . and you have less rights in<br/>
&gt;the entire history of mankind.<br/>

aren&#39;t even at replacement levels, and grow only through immigration.  Even<br/>
the US is fairly close to that point.  Female literacy and choice seems to<br/>
make a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen a claim that Europe, or at least northwestern Europe and its<br/>
descendant cultures, haven&#39;t grown as fast as it could have for a long time,<br/>
due to its culture.  To whit: a couple was expected to be able to establish<br/>
itself as an independent household before marrying (and breeding.)  Sort of a<br/>
taboo against having more than one couple under the same roof, unlike in many<br/>
Asian cultures.  This makes a nice brake on population growth: if land (or<br/>
other resources) was scarce marriage ages and rates would rise and drop.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, a marriage age in the mid-to-late twenties is not all that modern in<br/>
Europe; American had lower marriage ages due to the frontier history, where it<br/>
was relatively trivial to set up your own household.  And many people never<br/>
got married, swelling the potential servant class.<br/>
<br/>
(Or potential criminal class, since permanently unattached males aren&#39;t<br/>
maximally stable.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some kid would be interested in fact-checking all this. :)  (Also<br/>
correlate with ages and expectations in fiction, such as Jane Austen...)<br/>
