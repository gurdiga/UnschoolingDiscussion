<div id="ygrps-yiv-519427651">I am currently taking a weekly (8 weeks) course with my wife from Gordon<br/>
Neufeld.  I am absolutely fascinated by his developmental approach with an<br/>
emphasis on attachment.  He makes it very clear how behaviourism has damaged our<br/>
approach to children.<br/>
<br/>
Peer identified children are also inevitably &quot;defended&quot; children who have<br/>
armoured themselves, are insatiable and for whom &quot;cool&quot; and the appearance of<br/>
invulnerability is the ultimate value.<br/>
<br/>
I repeatedly am lobbying Dr. Neufeld to get a web site up and get his material<br/>
out there.  His approach has provided an almost immediate improvement in my<br/>
childrearing focus.<br/>
<br/>
He has commented on how having an underlying consistent philosophy is of great<br/>
importance... techniques divorced from an embracing philosophy results in<br/>
distortions and does not work.<br/>
<br/>
Meandering on about this whole thing..... it is clearer to me how we have a<br/>
tendency to use the dependence and attachment of our children to manipulate their<br/>
behaviour for short term results. The long term results which often emerge in the<br/>
teen years are rebellion, anger, alienation and peer identification in spades.<br/>
<br/>
The power we have as parents is enormous but to use it to manipulate children is<br/>
the epitome of penny wise pound foolish.<br/>

Joel, is there a place where  I can find copies of Neufeld&#39;s theories to read <br/>
and ponder?<br/>
<br/>
I really like what you say here, and have been caught up in thinking lately <br/>
that that&#39;s exactly where my partner and I fall short with our parenting.  We <br/>
don&#39;t seem to have ever identified our philosophies of child-raising, so we <br/>
tend to flip-flop using techniques that aren&#39;t really suited to what we <br/>
believe.<br/>
I think that we truly do have a philosophy:  I just don&#39;t think we&#39;ve spent <br/>
enough time realizing the importance of cementing this before we work on <br/>
individual behavior problems in our children.<br/>
Thanks once again for a thought-provoking post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931010081">Gordon Neufeld took a sabbatical this last year in part for the purpose of<br/>
writing.  I figure the guy has a best selling book in him.  I have even<br/>
suggested a title to him.   At this point he has only the notes he has<br/>
handed out in his courses.  I will talk to him yet again about how much he<br/>
needs to get a website and archive his materials.  He is very busy and in<br/>
addition tries to be a real parent to his kids.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the philosophy problem well.  I have been eclectic in just<br/>
about everything I have ever done.  A kind of utilitarian pastiche.  However<br/>
I really tend to agree with Gordon&#39;s belief that a without a unifying<br/>
philosophy difficulty looms.  I really have an intuitive sense that trying<br/>
behaviourist &quot;techniques&quot; is mutually exclusive with an attachment based<br/>
developmental point of view.  You can manipulate behaviour but always at a<br/>
cost to relationship.  Relationship is the real force in raising children as<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep everyone posted as to any developments or availability of<br/>
materials.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gee, Joel, I&#39;m way behind  on e-mail and haven&#39;t gotten back to this thread <br/>
or to you, but this is another gem.  I almost yelped YES, YES, YES when I <br/>
read it. <br/>
This is what I&#39;m always trying to tell my dh...but in much more simplistic <br/>
terms.  It always feels like I have this intuitive sense as you put it, of <br/>
what&#39;s right...but when it comes to actual practice, I have such a hard time <br/>
applying this sense to real life situations.<br/>
Many times when I&#39;m confused about how to respond to my children in <br/>
particular, I try to think of how I define healthy relationships in my own <br/>
life and I try to think about how I would like to be responded to in a <br/>
similar situation.  But, I&#39;m still really short on patience and that hurts my <br/>
attempts!<br/>
Sorry if this isn&#39;t completely coherent; my thinking process right now is <br/>
definitely a work in progress.<br/>
Thanks again, Joel.<br/>
