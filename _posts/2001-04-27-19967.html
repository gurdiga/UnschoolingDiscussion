<div id="ygrps-yiv-229228583">Hey!<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted on this list for awhile, but I thought I&#39;d comment on the<br/>
no-tv week...<br/>
<br/>
We turned off the TV last sunday, and it hasn&#39;t been on at all since. One<br/>
thing that i&#39;ve noticed above anything else is that my 4-year old son, who<br/>
hasn&#39;t been a napper since he was 2, is now taking at least one nap a day,<br/>
or is going in his room for quiet time at least once a day. I know this is<br/>
not a coincidence because the same thing happened in January when we put a<br/>
moratoreum on TV viewing. It should be noted that we are not dawn til dusk<br/>
TV viewers, either...in a typical day we watch maybe an hour of PBS and<br/>
maybe one or two videos...<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that he&#39;s giving himself down time! And I wonder what TV<br/>
does to him that causes him to not need or not want to take this time. I did<br/>
read Jerry Manders&#39; book (4 Arguments for the Elimination of Television) and<br/>
there was a whole section about TV and hyperactivity. It&#39;s pretty intriguing<br/>
to me that the lack of television affects my son this way. Has anyone else<br/>
noticed this?<br/>
<br/>
As for our tv, well, I&#39;d really like to just put it up in the closet, but I<br/>
still rely on videos to do my yoga, and rainy days can really be difficult<br/>
without the &quot;down time&quot;. However, I think I&#39;m going to actually start<br/>
regulating since it does seem to have a physiological effect on my son!<br/>
<br/>
BTW - I&#39;m Lainie...I&#39;m an avid lurker and a breastfeeding, cloth-diapering,<br/>
no-meat eating, semi-single (long story!) mama to Monk (age 4 - who claims<br/>
I&#39;m a &quot;poser vegetarian&quot; since I started eating eggs and cheese again, and<br/>
this afternoon asked if he could have some &quot;soy broccoli&quot;) and Cole (age 6<br/>
months - who really enjoys having his tummy &quot;zerbetted&quot; more than anything<br/>
else in the world.)</div>

This would be fine, except for the fact that I really feel that kids need periods without &quot;noise&quot; input. There&#39;s a big difference between sitting in your room by yourself just thinking, and sitting in front of a TV screen and watching. Monk does not have silent time *at all* when he has access to the television. He does have it (and he&#39;s pretty happy with it, I might add) when the television is off. I mean, if he could watch TV AND manage to have &quot;non-noise&quot; down time, I&#39;d say that would be ok...but he can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Monk and I talked about this last night, and he agreed that we could keep the TV off unless it&#39;s a rainy day or our special movie night. He seems OK with that decision, and I&#39;m OK with it, too...<br/>
<br/>
I just think it&#39;s interesting that TV viewing has such a profound effect on him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80101266">Our son spends lots of time alone in his room, and<br/>
*never* has no-noise time.  The whole time he&#39;s in<br/>
there he&#39;s humming, singing, doing sound effects and<br/>
&#39;voices&#39;, acting out the parts for his various action<br/>
figures or beanies, acting out the bits for the D&D<br/>
scenario he&#39;s designing... <br/>
