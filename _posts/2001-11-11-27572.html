<div id="ygrps-yiv-271178477">I think its important to remember that as parents, we<br/>
*know* what is best for our individual children.  And<br/>
there are many times we do need to impose our limits,<br/>
before they come to the realization of the effects of<br/>
certain behaviors, on their own.<br/>
<br/>
There are some lessons that my children are not going<br/>
to learn on their own, plain and simple. And there are<br/>
others that I will sit back and watch the process<br/>
unfold, see where it goes. Its individual to the<br/>
family, where that dividing line is, and I respect<br/>
others instincts to know what that is for themselves.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  It was proved to me so many times.  When my son was younger, I<br/>
sometimes had difficulty not setting limits for  him, but I resisted the<br/>
temptation.  It&#39;s not even something I think about now, because I&#39;ve<br/>
seen, over and over, that he knows what&#39;s right for him. <br/>
<br/>
A really hard thing for me was worrying about what everyone else would<br/>
think.  Maybe some of you were more secure, but I didn&#39;t want anyone to<br/>
think I was a bad mother.  The video game issue was probably the hardest<br/>
because my sil was here when the Playstation arrived.  She would say  &quot;<br/>
Are you STILL playing that?&quot;  and &quot;Are you just going to let him sit<br/>
there all day?&quot;   Well, yes, I did, and he played all day, every day, for<br/>
days and days, until HE decided HE was finished and wanted to move on to<br/>
something else.  People have raised their eyebrows more than once in our<br/>
direction about how much TV he can watch, what he can watch, no bed<br/>
times, etc.  But I hear constantly about what an exceptional child he is<br/>
and how smart he is.  Well, he&#39;s smart because no one&#39;s stomping him<br/>
down, telling him constantly by controlling him, that he&#39;s NOT smart<br/>
enough to make his own choices.  IMO.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it with another boy too.  A neighbor boy who is always in<br/>
trouble at school and was considered such a handful other neighbors even<br/>
warned me about him.  He loves coming to our house because he can do<br/>
whatever he wants.  And you know what?  He doesn&#39;t do anything horrible. <br/>
He&#39;s a really fun kid.  <br/>
<br/>
His folks used to lock him out of his house too, by the way.  When I<br/>
figured out what was going on, I  said, why don&#39;t you just tell him he<br/>
can come to my house after school?   She said they locked him out because<br/>
he ate everything in the house and then wouldn&#39;t eat any dinner.  <br/>
I told her I&#39;d have something nutritious for him, then if he snacked, it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a big deal.   They stopped locking him out.  And now if he&#39;s<br/>
home by himself he knows he can call me if he needs something.  Usually<br/>
he just comes over here, and we&#39;re glad to see him.  At our house he is<br/>
NOT the &quot;monster&quot; he is at school, and I believe it&#39;s because he knows we<br/>
like and respect him, and believe he&#39;s a good person.  <br/>

<br/>
Look at it this way:<br/>
You believe your child knows what she needs to eat everyday and you let<br/>
her choose what and how much.  She is fine and healthy but chooses to eat<br/>
things you detest - say Peanut butter and Garlic sandwiches.  All is well<br/>
though and you can trust her to make her own choices because they are not<br/>
harming her and you have disassociated the taste from the health issue.<br/>
Now, suppose you daughter decides to eat nothing but celery.  All celery<br/>
ever day.  Absolutely nothing else.  She has lost loads of weight and is<br/>
unhealthy.  Can you still let her make her own choices regarding food? <br/>
When exactly is the right time to step in and do something?<br/>
The same holds true for every parenting issue.  We need to learn and<br/>
observe and figure out when the right time to step in is.  But no one can<br/>
say that there is NEVER a time to step in with any child.  I do think<br/>
many people step in on too many issues because they can&#39;t disassociate<br/>
their own wants and needs from the childs wants and needs.  But that does<br/>
not mean that it is NEVER right to step in.<br/>

Those who have let them have the freedom to prove that it could happen have <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Typically anorexics feel like they can&#39;t control anything in their lives<br/>
besides food, so I can&#39;t see a child who had been allowed to make her own<br/>
decisions becoming anorexic. Anorexia isn&#39;t about food, it&#39;s about<br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think maybe we need to better define &quot;stepping in&quot;.  I do say<br/>
things like, &quot;It&#39;s 10 o&#39;clock right now and you have a soccer game<br/>
tomorrow at 8...  you might want to try to go to bed a little earlier<br/>
than usual tonight so you&#39;re really tired at the game.&quot;  I don&#39;t say<br/>
things like, &quot;Your soccer game is at 8, so you have to be in bed by 11<br/>
tonight.&quot; Sometimes she goes to bed at 11, sometimes she&#39;s up until 1,<br/>
and tired the next morning.<br/>

<br/>
Does anyone here believe anorexia is a likely or possible result of allowing <br/>
children a lot of freedom in their lives?  Of allowing them to eat the foods <br/>
they want?<br/>
<br/>
Anorexia is not just a random choice in a child&#39;s life.   <br/>

I&#39;ve seen kids just eat starches for a while, or only drink one drink for a <br/>
couple of years, but an all-celery diet was made up as a booga-booga big <br/>
example which has nothing to do with any real unschoolers.  What fantasy, <br/>
fictitious unschoolers MIGHT do is really honestly of no concern to me.  I&#39;d <br/>
much rather we spend our energy discussing what IS happening, and what HAS <br/>
happened in our lives than &quot;What if dogs could fly?  What if they could fly <br/>
and use weapons?  What if they could fly and feed our children nothing but <br/>
celery and use their weapons to make them eat it?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
WHAT IF a child watched the same episode of Gilligan&#39;s Island 18 hours a day?<br/>
Well it&#39;s not happening, and I doubt anyone knows of anything remotely <br/>
similar.  But if I were to use that to scare people away from allowing kids <br/>
some freedom I wouldn&#39;t be showing any critical thinking, it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
helpful, and it would be dishonest for me to make up some wild extreme to <br/>
discredit people who are discussing real issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068010809">I haven&#39;t heard of a homeschooler that only ate celery either.  But then I<br/>
doubt that if it happened they would exactly being advertising it.<br/>
<br/>
I did, however, hear of one that ate only celery with peanut butter.  She<br/>
ended up weighing less than 85 pounds on a 5&#39;8&quot; frame.  Not secondhand<br/>
knowledge.  It was my cousin&#39;s daughter who almost killed herself.<br/>
<br/>
It was through my cousin that I originally heard the term &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
We&#39;d never heard a name put to it because we, quite frankly, could have<br/>
cared less how other folks were raising their kids or &quot;educating&quot; them.  She<br/>
insisted (that would be past tense) that children are quite capable of<br/>
making all decisions on their own, that they should learn from their<br/>
mistakes and that a child would never put themselves into harms way.  That<br/>
all, as she put it &quot;negative behaviors&quot; would be outgrown and no harm would<br/>
come from them learning from their mistakes.  She &quot;was&quot; a 100% died in the<br/>
wool unschooler complete with family bed, home births, all the television<br/>
and video games they want, no limits on anything, etc., etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
She has hence decided that children do not always know what is best for them<br/>
and that all situations must be looked at on an individual basis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793699160">As far as not controlling what your children eat, I have a different <br/>
perspective.  I have two sons with food allergies.  My four year old <br/>
is allergic to peanuts, wheat, and milk.  I have a kit that I carry <br/>
with me that I can use in case he accidentally eats something with <br/>
peanuts in it and has an anaphylactic reaction.  When we go out to <br/>
eat, I ask if they fry their food in peanut oil.  If they do, he&#39;s <br/>
not allowed to have it.  I went through his trick or treat candy and <br/>
read labels and took out everything that had peanuts in it.  There is <br/>
nothing anyone could say to convince me to allow my son to eat a <br/>
peanut butter sandwich!  I also know that if we omit milk from his <br/>
diet now, we may be able to keep him from developing asthma.  If it&#39;s <br/>
been a few weeks since he&#39;s had milk products and there&#39;s a special <br/>
occasion (ie, birthday cake or pizza at a birthday party), I will let <br/>
him have some, but then have to watch that he doesn&#39;t get any milk <br/>
for at least another week.  If he does, he will break out with <br/>
exzema.  When he was a baby he spit up so much that he dropped on the <br/>
growth charts because I was nursing him and I drank milk.  When he <br/>
was a toddler, he had exzema that he would scratch at night and there <br/>
would be blood on the sheets from it the next morning.  <br/>
<br/>
My two year old is also allergic to milk.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that I&#39;ve learned about food allergies is that people tend <br/>
to crave what they&#39;re allergic to.  I also believe that kids are <br/>
allergic to foods more often than people realize.  You should always <br/>
suspect food allergies with exzema, chronic ear infections, colic, <br/>
babies spitting up excessively, asthma, acne, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t be seeing me allowing my kids to control their diet any <br/>
time soon.  <br/>

<br/>
My kids drink large amounts of milk.  None is allergic, but if one had <br/>
exzema, which I did as a kid, I KNOW I would consider the freedom to choose <br/>
and to live a more stress-free life more important than the freedom from <br/>
exzema.  Exzema and asthma and some other such conditions are more closely <br/>
correlated with emotional than dietary factors, aren&#39;t they?  Maybe all the <br/>
correlations and guesses in the world aren&#39;t the real answers.<br/>
<br/>
A child we know had an asthma attack that took him to the hospital yesterday, <br/>
from day care.  He&#39;s ten, and homeschooled, but his mom went to visit <br/>
relatives, her dad is dying of cancer, and she&#39;s been gone now three weeks.  <br/>
The dad didn&#39;t think of anything better to do than to stick them in a daycare <br/>
center where they&#39;re the only older kids (8, 10 and 12) and they&#39;re not <br/>
allowed to bring toys from home.  They&#39;re bored silly, and are there for ten <br/>
hours a day.   Nobody suggested it might have been dietary.<br/>
<br/>
The fear throughout childhood of shock, infertility and colon cancer could <br/>
ruin an othewise joyous childhood.  One of my most uptight friends of all <br/>
time finished college, finished law school, got a good job, and a date <br/>
(something he lacked through college) and was hit and killed in a crosswalk <br/>
while on this date.  What, at that point, did it matter what he had eaten up <br/>
to that point or how much TV he had watched?   And is an 80 year life of fear <br/>
and deprivation and magical prevention better than a 60 year life of <br/>
experimentation and freedom?<br/>
<br/>
People like to control things.  Controlling cancer 40 years out, and <br/>
controlling fertility by avoiding caffein, and controlling thoughts by <br/>
forbidding TV and controlling attention span by timing video games all still <br/>
seem to me like magical acts and charms against fears.<br/>

asthma, was that there had to be a combination.  If she had been drinking <br/>
milk *and* around cats *and* was feeling strong emotions (and they could be <br/>
happy ones, like the excitement of Christmas) then she would get an <br/>
attack.  If we kept the exposure to the physical triggers way down, then <br/>
she could handle any kind of strong emotions.  We tried to do that because <br/>
it wasn&#39;t always possible to predict when the strong emotions were going to <br/>
come up.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand.....my granddaughter has been plagued with severe <br/>
tantrums even at age 6.  One of the things they tried working with was food <br/>
allergies.  They got her tested, and she was supposed to be allergic to a <br/>
huge list of things.  She did improve a fair bit on her restricted diet, <br/>
but it certainly wasn&#39;t the whole problem.  After a while, my daughter <br/>
started testing letting her have small amounts of the things she was <br/>
supposed to be allergic to.  Then Skye started waking up in the morning <br/>
asking if they could go and get one of the foods she wasn&#39;t allowed to <br/>
have.  She was totally obsessed with food.  My daughter finally decided to <br/>
let her eat what she wanted.  It wasn&#39;t a perfect solution, but it was <br/>
better than the obsession.  (And they&#39;ve since found a supplement that <br/>
*does* really help a lot.  And then she recently had a native healing <br/>
circle done for her, and that&#39;s helped the most by far.)<br/>

read enough about food and nutrition, you might have to stop eating <br/>
altogether.  Much of the advice is totally contradictory.  I think one of <br/>
the reasons for that is that we&#39;re all really quite different.  Things that <br/>
bother you might not bother me at all, and the things that bother me might <br/>
be just the best thing for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Well,  I don&#39;t know about the all-celery-diet girl.  But I can say <br/>
that I have a all-day-everyday video game player.  My boy has been <br/>
playing video games since he was two(he is now 9yo).  And very good <br/>
at it I might add.  I use to let him play to his heart was <br/>
content...which was ALWAYS.  When we stopped playing to go shopping <br/>
or to someones house.  All I heard was mario did this and donkey kong <br/>
that.  He would want to hurry home to keep playing.  He would <br/>
sometimes have accidents in his pants, wouldn&#39;t eat, and sometimes <br/>
complained of headaches...from playing for 8 hours.  So now I limit <br/>
them.  I think what really pushed my buttons was when he was doing <br/>
WWF wrestling moves on his 1yo brother.  ANYWAY...<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about it...I won&#39;t let him have free rain on the <br/>
video games.  I will back off in not pushing him to find something <br/>
else to replace them.  For who knows what the future may <br/>
bring...maybe he&#39;ll be a tester for nintendo some day..hehe  For I <br/>
think it is my job as a parent to supervise when nessasary...not <br/>
everything.  I mean a child should brush their teeth and take a <br/>
shower...just because a child doesn&#39;t want to do those things, <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean he should go 5 years without doing it :-))  It&#39;s my job <br/>
to keep them clean and to set SOME limits.  For they are my babies...<br/>

&gt; &gt;   You don&#39;t want your children drinking large amounts of caffeine and<br/>
&gt; &gt;then having them regret it when they are married and are suffering<br/>
&gt; &gt;from infertility.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Huh?  There have been times in my life that I might have wished that my<br/>
&gt; caffeine habit would cause infertility.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  And I don&#39;t allow my daughter to drink non-organic milk, because I<br/>
&gt; &gt;believe the hormones in our milk are responsible for many girls<br/>
&gt; &gt;entering puberty at too early of an age.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Interesting.  I had an early puberty, and they weren&#39;t putting hormones<br/>
&gt; into the cows when I was a child in the 50&#39;s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99542285">My kids drink large amounts of milk.  None is allergic, but if one had <br/>
  exzema, which I did as a kid, I KNOW I would consider the freedom to choose <br/>
  and to live a more stress-free life more important than the freedom from <br/>
  exzema.  Exzema and asthma and some other such conditions are more closely <br/>
  correlated with emotional than dietary factors, aren&#39;t they?  Maybe all the <br/>
  correlations and guesses in the world aren&#39;t the real answers.<br/>
<br/>
  My son has both eczema and asthma.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone claim that there are emotional factors involved with them.  I have heard lots and lots of claims, and research, of the direct dietary factors involved.  My son and I don&#39;t drink milk or eat wheat.  Neither of us are allergic, but we are &quot;sensitive&quot; to them.  Without them in our diet, my son no longer has stomach cramps, night terrors, eczema, his astma is under control without drugs, and his behavior has changed significantly (we both also have Tourette Syndrome, and the behavioral &quot;co-morbidities&quot; that go along with TS have disappeared.)  My son hates his new diet, but is very, very happy with the changes that have gone on in his body.  He&#39;ll get used to the diet eventually, and there is no way that I will allow him to go back to his old ways of eating.  The diet hasn&#39;t caused me any more stress than eating the old way, it&#39;s just replaced the stress of having a sick, cranky, anxious, depressed child, with a healthy child who is generally not happy at dinner time.  <br/>
<br/>
  BTW, even conservative Discover magazine did a cover story on the connection between ingesting large amounts of dairy products, and the high incidence of osteoporosis, alzheimers, certain cancers, MS, and several other neurological disorders.  The only groups still pushing a high dairy intake are having their research funded by the dairy lobby.  This is a case where there is a significant amount of research and correlation.  It&#39;s also a well established and completely uncontroversial fact that the majority of the world&#39;s population is lactose intolerant (3 out of 5 in European decent population, about 90-95% in non-white populations) and that injesting dairy products would hurt them.  In fact, there is a very good chance that you or your children are lactose intolerant and don&#39;t know it.<br/>
