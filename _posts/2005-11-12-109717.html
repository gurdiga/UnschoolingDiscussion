<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142920661">Just before she died, Amala had been making promising progress towards <br/>
speech, giving voice to the babbling and cooing noises that mark the first stage in <br/>
a normal child&#39;s learning to talk. With Kamala, progress was much slower but <br/>
Singh persevered. After three years, Kamala had mastered a small vocabulary of <br/>
about a dozen words. After several more years, her vocabulary had increased to <br/>
about 40. This was far more than Itard had managed with Victor (and using far <br/>
less intensive training methods), but not really much of a victory for Singh. <br/>
To compare, a normal two-year-old child, at the peak of its language <br/>
learning, would find it easy to pick up 40 new words in a single week. Also, Kamala&#39;s <br/>
words were only partly-formed and her grammar stilted. The Hindi word for <br/>
medicine is ashad but Kamala would only pronounce half the word, saying &quot;ud&quot;. <br/>
Likewise, she would say bha for bhat (rice), bil for biral (cat) and tha for thala <br/>
(plate).<br/>
<br/>
 Singh made much of an incident when Kamala was given some dolls to play with <br/>
and then a box to keep them in. Kamala shut the dolls away and &quot;proudly&quot; told <br/>
the other children in the orphanage: &quot;Bak-poo-voo.&quot; Singh interpreted this <br/>
utterance as standing for &quot;Baksa-pootool-vootara,&quot; — Hindi for <br/>
&quot;Box-doll-inside.&quot; While this broken sentence marks a significant step forward for a girl who <br/>
was little more than a wolf cub a few years earlier — showing not just a use of <br/>
language but the first glimmerings of a social awareness - Kamala&#39;s speech <br/>
still fell a long way short of normally-reared children.<br/>
<br/>
. . . .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gesell wondered whether, with a few more years, Kamala would have caught up <br/>
eventually with other normal children or whether the traumas of her early years <br/>
had left her somehow permanently stunted. The question was never answered <br/>
because in 1929, Kamala caught typhoid and died. Her last words to Singh&#39;s wife — <br/>
possibly too poignant to be true — were said to have been: &quot;Mama, the little <br/>
one hurts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(She died at 16, with some language.    More here:<br/>

<br/>
This is really interesting.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a movie about Victor, an 18th century French boy.   Holly and I <br/>
watched it a few years back.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;The Wild Child&quot; was directed by Francois Truffaut and released in 1970. <br/>
Truffaut has made some extraordinary movies, such as the Antoine Doinel series <br/>
and &quot;Jules et Jim.&quot; Unfortunately, this movie is given relatively little <br/>
recognition, even though it truly is first-rate. Based on a true story, the movie <br/>
concerns Victor, l&#39;enfant sauvage - a boy found in the wilds of France. <br/>
Truffaut cast himself as Dr. Jean Itard an 18th century physician who helps &quot;tame&quot; <br/>
and educate the boy. Initially branded an &quot;idiot&quot; and uneducable by local <br/>
townspeople, Victor is helped immensely by Dr. Itard through his humane treatment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
 The story is fascinating and quite gripping. In addition, the movie raises <br/>
interesting questions regarding &quot;civilized&quot; behavior and ethics, as it compares <br/>
Victor to various people in the town. Although similar stories has been told <br/>
elsewhere (e.g., Herzog&#39;s &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot;), Truffaut manages to put <br/>
his own interesting spin on the tale. Further, his direction is masterful, and <br/>
he won Best Director from the National Board of Review. The film was made in <br/>
black and white, which adds great realism to the story - it looks terrific (It <br/>
won Best Cinematography from the National Society of Film Critics).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t seem Nell is based on a true story, but on a play (which wasn&#39;t based <br/>
on a true story).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254287154">There are much more modern cases than this but I can&#39;t remember the <br/>
names. One girl was in the USA I know that for sure. The other, a <br/>
boy, was in an eastern european country I think, and had taken up <br/>
with a pack of dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Btw I wasn&#39;t arguing against learning being a natural thing for a <br/>
human being but it does appear that for some things human beings <br/>
have to be exposed to by a certain age. By expose I don&#39;t mean in <br/>
any way taught I mean to be present to. It is natural for a young <br/>
child to be with adults, to be abandoned is an unatural phenomena.<br/>
<br/>
 For many mammals not all things are instinct and certain knowledge <br/>
and behaviour is passed on from by the parent/parents. I don&#39;t mean <br/>
taught.<br/>

born with the mechanisms ready to learn language either. What I <br/>
think it means at its core is that human beings need other human <br/>
beings to be able to develop fully.<br/>
<br/>
We need to be around each other, hey we need to hang out together. <br/>
We are after all social mammals, we don&#39;t go off immediately after <br/>
we&#39;re born, and live on our own, only seeing other human beings for <br/>
mating purposes. The truly independent human being is a myth, we <br/>
need each other.<br/>

known-to-be-bright-and-normal infants, there&#39;s not only a control group, but there&#39;s a liklihood that the <br/>
abandoned babies were considered defective, or that the parents were somehow <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930580623">I did post that a child wouldn&#39;t aquire language (I may have said<br/>
speech) in the event that they (one child) were dropped on a desert<br/>
island with a bunch of books.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe they&#39;d have any need for speech, though they may learn<br/>
to communicate with monkeys or dolphins.:)<br/>
<br/>
If there was more than one human, yes, they&#39;d learn speech, but it<br/>
would be a new language of course.<br/>
<br/>
I watched a very lengthy PBS special about Genie, many years ago. She<br/>
was the abused child that was locked up until the age of 13. I really<br/>
don&#39;t think she&#39;s a good case to look at for whether or not a human<br/>
could aquire speech later on.<br/>
She was turned into a research piece. Her life was forfeit to the<br/>
researchers. She was actually making progress into speech, until the<br/>
grant money was pulled and she got taken from the family she&#39;d learned<br/>
to trust. She reverted back to more feral behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Many, many things went wrong in her case and it IS entirely possible<br/>
that in a trusting, loving environment, she eventually would have<br/>
learned speech and aquired some language. It&#39;s a heartbreaking story<br/>
at best.<br/>
