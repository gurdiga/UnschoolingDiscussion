<div id="ygrps-yiv-797350653">If you have to spend time at home with the grandparents, you could get out that box of papers and let the kids go through it with them.  The kids would probably love to show them what they drew, wrote, did, etc.  I save a box like this every year, too.  We like to go through the boxes occasionally to bring back memories. <br/>
