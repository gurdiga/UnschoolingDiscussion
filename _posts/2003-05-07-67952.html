<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The strange thing is that they think Roald Dahl is fine and his books are<br/>
&gt; filled with magic and kids getting the better of their parents but Harry<br/>
&gt; Potter is evil.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not about poor Harry.  It&#39;s about J.K. Rowlings.  She was a single<br/>
parents, and she&#39;s promoting the anti-christ.  Or so says the other<br/>
homeschooler in town here (there&#39;s one), who was appalled that my son was<br/>
reading book 4.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe Roald Dahl was Christian, I don&#39;t know.  I should go ask her, but I&#39;m<br/>
afriad she&#39;d take it wrong.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is just a teeny, tiny little rant and it has nothing to do with <br/>
Harry Potter, but it makes me so mad that the same people who protest <br/>
abortion criticize single mothers!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Ok, you can continue your discussion in peace now.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure some of Roald Dahl&#39;s adult stories were published in<br/>
Playboy. &lt;g&gt;  But you might not want to tell her, even to score a point,<br/>
because she might ban her kids Dahl books.<br/>

PS  Not that I care, but J. K. Rowling is a Christian who attends the<br/>
church of Scotland.  She just doesn&#39;t wave her religion around like a<br/>
flag when she is interviewed.</div>
