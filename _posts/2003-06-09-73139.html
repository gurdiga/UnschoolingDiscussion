4-H--whatever. If she&#39;ll get involved with a local SHOW breeder (not some <br/>
backyard breeder), she&#39;ll have a mentor--and a new hobby. There may even be a <br/>
breeder in the local kennel club who&#39;d be willing to part with an older champion <br/>
that she could show in junior showmanship and conformation. The breeder will help <br/>
her with grooming and training and handling. She could apprentice a <br/>
professional handler and exchange &quot;kennel grunt help&quot; for hands-on experience with show <br/>
dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Endless possibilities.<br/>
