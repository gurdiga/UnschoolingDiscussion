<div id="ygrps-yiv-566227499">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know, a &quot;distributed learning program&quot; is a program that goes through the school system in which the school receives the same funding as for a regular student, and a teacher is assigned to meet with the parent to oversee home-based learning. It may (or may not) be a Canadian thing. The purpose i believe is for schools to draw  homeschoolers to get more funding for their school from the ministry.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, there&#39;s a program offered at a small local alternative school where i registered my 7yo son as a &quot;homeschooler&quot; last year. The only reason i would join is that they offer $1300 per year to spend on &quot;homelearning supplies&quot; which includes books, games, &quot;fieldtrips&quot;, lessons, musical instruments, sports and computer equipment etc--pretty open. We live on a very low income so this would be a big bonus. Other parents have bought pianos, computers, cameras, cool art supplies, a year&#39;s worth of music lessons etc.<br/>
<br/>
He could also participate if he wishes in the school play, field trips and an hour per week of parent-led &quot;explorations&quot; (anything from pottery to rocket-building) but he can do this anyway as a registered homeschooler. So the only advantage is the money and a few extras like library use at a near-by bigger school, weekly homeschoolers gym, ocassional science workshops and special speakers/mentors etc.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s required is that I meet with the teacher 3 times per year to discuss a &quot;learning plan&quot; (yes, we plan to learn :-)) and to discuss whether he has met provincial learning outcomes (things like &quot;can count to 100&quot;, &quot;understands a story that is read to him&quot; and similar ilk). It basically means speaking a bit of educationese, showing her a couple of things we&#39;ve been doing (a few drawings or a photograph of child feeding the chickens etc is accepted). <br/>
<br/>
My son never has to meet her. She seems pretty open and accepting of unschooling ideas, as far as she understands them. I know a few parents who have done the program from the school at homers to very loose unschoolish types and so far the handful of people i&#39;ve talked to are happy with it. Apparently the teacher is satisfied with answers like &quot;we haven&#39;t done that&quot;, &quot;he can&#39;t count that far&quot; and &quot;i don&#39;t believe in early reading if the child doesn&#39;t want to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But i&#39;m still a little wary and dh is pretty suspicious and concerned about possibility of the government getting their fingers in our child&#39;s affairs. I&#39;m uncomfortable with the idea of answering to anyone about my son&#39;s learning but we kind of see it as a silly hoop to jump through to get the benefits. We can of course quit at any time, so i&#39;m seriously considering it. Our son is totally willing as long as it doesn&#39;t affect what he does.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here have experience or feedback on working with such a program as a life learner/unschooler? Comments welcome!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186572358">Will there be any kind of testing going on?<br/>
 <br/>
The reason I ask is because there is this type of program in the community I used to live in.   A friend of mine enrolled their 2 daughters in the program for some of the same reasons you mentioned-- resources galore.  <br/>
 <br/>
But,  there was testing.  I believe that my friend knew about the testing but didn&#39;t think it would be a big deal.  But when testing did come around, one of her daughters really was troubled with it.  If the kids didn&#39;t test at a certain level the funding would be questioned.  Because then the &quot;learning cooperative&quot;  wouldn&#39;t be meeting the state standards.<br/>
 <br/>
After having to do this testing, the one daughter who was having a hard time with it really questioned her own learning and abilities.  It was very sad.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
So that is one experience with it.  I guess it depends on the program.<br/>

I figure those programs start off loose and add more and more rules as time <br/>
goes on, so if you and get  in on one while it&#39;s still fresh and loose, and <br/>
drop out when it&#39;s not worth it, that&#39;s an advantage.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a political tussle among some of the upper-level kind of <br/>
homeschooling movers and shakers about whether those who register with a program should <br/>
still be considered homeschoolers.  Some say no, some say yes.   The related <br/>
arguments to consider are that if someone is still a homeschooler even though he <br/>
uses ABeka or Sonlight or Calvert or Oak Meadow or Clonlara, because they&#39;ve <br/>
bought a kit but they aren&#39;t registered with a school system, why is he NOT a <br/>
homeschooler for registering with a school system?  If they don&#39;t provide a <br/>
curriculum, or test kids or make them do things against their will, is it still <br/>
homeschooling?  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the easy answer it looks like at first.<br/>
<br/>
There are programs in California like the one you&#39;re describing.   When the <br/>
liason person understands unschooling, and there&#39;s money available for a piano <br/>
or dance lessons or something expensive like that, but the child is still <br/>
learning naturally from all the world around, I don&#39;t personally see it as evil.  <br/>
But it is, technically, an alternative school program.<br/>
<br/>
Different people homeschool for different reasons. For me, it&#39;s not <br/>
political.  It&#39;s more a wholeness and emotional health thing.  I wanted Kirby to be <br/>
whole and unbroken by other kids and by teachers who wanted him to conform.  He&#39;s <br/>
18 now; it worked.<br/>
<br/>
I care about how children learn and live, not about what the statistics of <br/>
the government are, or how state taxes are disbursed.  That&#39;s just me.  Some <br/>
others feel more strongly and more politically, I know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737015666">My goal is less to be &quot;unschooling&quot; (by anyone&#39;s definition, even my <br/>
own) than to be trusting of my son&#39;s innate ability to choose his own <br/>
path of learning. I see my role as facilitator, guide, resource, but <br/>
mainly to prevent obstructing his path with my own ideas of what or <br/>
how it is best for him to learn. So, I guess I am more of <br/>
an &quot;unobstructionist&quot; to his natural love of learning wherever and <br/>
however that may lead him. I like the phrase &quot;desire-directed <br/>
learning&quot; more than &quot;unschooling&quot;. It seems to proactively embrace <br/>
the inherent joy of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling limits one in relation to the history of schooling. <br/>
Trusting people to know what and how they want to live and learn is <br/>
more encompassing than schooling or unschooling. The key attitudinal <br/>
change is trusting others rather than fearing for others. Trust is a <br/>
more universal life lesson than how or where to learn. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772043728">Hiyas Ingrid,<br/>
<br/>
I am speaking as a single mom who has is still discovering that what I <br/>
call my life as a homeschooling mom comes under the heading <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That being said I will tell you tho we have always been poor my <br/>
daughter is still thriving. We have never had a budget for &#39;schooling&quot; <br/>
and so indeed have missed out on regular on going classes and some <br/>
formal programs that surely we might have enjoyed but our lives are <br/>
not bare our supplies straight from the $1 store and other every <br/>
day life experiences over flow.<br/>
<br/>
One mom said this: &quot;I was in charters for years spent all my $$ on <br/>
supplies that are now stocked in my garage. So I can leave and not <br/>
feel a pinch heheheheh&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I always thought I would join a charter tho I am totally happy now <br/>
without one. When I started looking into them last year I felt just <br/>
like you about opening that door of total control to strangers or some <br/>
program I think it&#39;s just normal.<br/>
<br/>
But it seems you have a handle on what it could mean to your family <br/>
and therefore are in a great position to decide if the hoops are worth <br/>
the perks.<br/>
<br/>
Take care<br/>

<br/>
No there won&#39;t be any testing. I wouldn&#39;t do it if there was any testing. I think they have standardised tests in certain grades (a test every 2-3 years or so) but it&#39;s voluntary--any parent, even in the mainstream system here, can refuse this testing. I do have to write an assessment of my child, no grades though.<br/>

<br/>
What a great question! I hadn&#39;t thought to ask, but definitely will--thanks! They don&#39;t give the money up front--you save up receipts and they reimburse you 3 times a year but i wonder if they&#39;d want any back if you pull out? hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I figure those programs start off loose and add more and more rules as time <br/>
goes on, <br/>

That&#39;s where it&#39;s at--only 3 years old.<br/>

homeschooling movers and shakers about whether those who register with a program should <br/>
still be considered homeschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
i have strong political concerns about it too, not so much out of semantics or ideals but because so many homeschoolers are doing it now that there are few technical homeschoolers left--at least 75% of homeschoolers in my community have started this program in the last couple of years. <br/>
<br/>
We (dh and i) have a concern that the government will try to pull more and more homeschoolers into the system, then start getting more and more controlling and that it may affect homeschooling freedoms in general if those homeschoolers then try to pull out. The laws in BC are some of the best in N. America and i&#39;d hate to be part of that changing. But if that doesn&#39;t change, then i&#39;d sure like the $1300!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback. More welcome as i continue to ponder...<br/>

It has okay message boards but a really great email list with homeschoolers of all different styles (and yet it works) from all across Canada. I know there are quite a few from BC who could help you. What I remember from past discussions is that BCers who choose the route you&#39;re discussing can register with something like umbrella schools that will help with the requirements you&#39;re talking about but some can be very unschooling friendly like one called Wondertree I think. And they still get the money. Join the list and ask them! <br/>
  We&#39;re pretty good here in NS as well but there&#39;s no money whatsoever. But man, PEI is awesome. A one time letter of intent and they wash their hands of your kids for as long as you homeschool!<br/>

<br/>
Sorry to be so late getting in on this discussion, but I&#39;ve been unable to<br/>
get on to my computer much in the past few days.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit of pessimist with regards to authority, so my suggestion is to<br/>
look at this in terms of a &quot;worst case scenario&quot; which, in the case of so<br/>
much of your contentment being tied in to the personality of your reviewer,<br/>
is: what if she leaves/retires/is fired and you find you have to deal with<br/>
someone who is different in philosophy? It is possible that you could be<br/>
stuck with a teacher who is rigid, committed to bringing people back to the<br/>
fold of school, or concerned with &quot;progress&quot; and those state standards, and<br/>
does want to meet your son. Would she be legally entitled to, even if<br/>
choosing not to at the moment? <br/>
<br/>
In such a situation it is useful to know the law; what are the criteria of<br/>
&quot;success&quot; - a passing grade as it were - and what are the consequences (if<br/>
any) for &quot;failure&quot;, meaning these terms in the school context. <br/>
<br/>
If it is as simple as withdrawing from the program, then that might be worth<br/>
it. Someone else mentioned the concept of increasing rules creeping up on<br/>
you. I think you said it was a fairly new program... <br/>
<br/>
Are you strong enough in your commitment to Unschooling to withstand a<br/>
person&#39;s dubiousness or disapproving scrutiny and not let those few niggling<br/>
doubts insinuate themselves like poison into your thought processes? Are the<br/>
art supplies and music lessons (lots on unschooling music in the archives -<br/>
tons and tons - a perennial subject) worth even one bad day of self<br/>
deprecation to you? Only you can answer these questions.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you can always come here with the doubts and blahs and we will try<br/>
and talk you out of them and offer suggestions for getting back your<br/>
serenity!!<br/>
<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t like the idea of anyone from officialdom condescending to<br/>
be &quot;open and accepting&quot; of my family&#39;s educational choices, which is the<br/>
same for us as someone &quot;officially accepting&quot; our whole life and everything<br/>
we do. I like the idea that Jayn is not going to be labeled in anyone&#39;s<br/>
office files about what she has or has not accomplished at any particular<br/>
time - at least as long as we are in California and she chooses to be home.<br/>

think. I *am* interested in the money, however.<br/>

 I like the idea that Jayn is not going to be labeled in anyone&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; office files about what she has or has not accomplished at any particular<br/>
&gt; time - at least as long as we are in California and she chooses to be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>home.<br/>
<br/>
yes, i don&#39;t like the files part. yet i am asking myself how this may affect<br/>
him in any way down the road and really doubt it will ever come up anywhere<br/>
(opinions welcome). my priority is offering opportunities that will nurture<br/>
my child&#39;s learning and there are a few things that includes that cost money<br/>
we don&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for all the input.<br/>
