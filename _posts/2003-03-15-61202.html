<div id="ygrps-yiv-72221390">Mary, I&#39;ll throw something at you just because you asked for help. <br/>
You can completely disregard it if it sounds rediculous to you. I <br/>
don&#39;t know Sierra, other than the little I&#39;ve read, but she sounds so <br/>
much like my son I just had to let you know. We went through very <br/>
similar baffling episodes before he was finally diagnosed with <br/>
Aspergers Syndrome. He&#39;s so mildly affected, it was not easy to pick <br/>
up, but now that I know about it, I can understand him so well now <br/>
and life is peaceful again. Just a thought. Hopefully, it&#39;s just a <br/>
phase for her. Best of luck. Beth</div>
