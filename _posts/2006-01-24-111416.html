<div id="ygrps-yiv-36470019">I work from home with people all over North America. Most of the people are <br/>
moms who want to stay home with their kids, and I just love helping them to <br/>
be able to reach those goals. Quite a few of these women then decide to <br/>
homeschool their kids. One of my business partners who had put her business <br/>
on hold for about 3 years just got in touch with me a couple of days ago to <br/>
let me know she wished to start up again. She also let me know that she is <br/>
now homeschooling her kids (dd8, ds6, & dd3). We talked briefly yesterday <br/>
and she sent me an email today. I lifted a paragraph from that email;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;After talking to you last night and you made the comment of not having the <br/>
kids do work books that they hate. It made so much sense when you related <br/>
it to toxins.  This morning I surprised Alexia (dd8) when I had her pick up <br/>
her language book and hand it to me.  I then said &quot;Do you like this? Me <br/>
either&quot; and threw it over my shoulder.  I then did the same with her <br/>
monotonous spelling workbook.  She was so happy and laughed and <br/>
laughed.  She is having problems with her spelling and phonics, but yet can <br/>
read very well.  I will figure something out for helping her with her <br/>
phonics and spelling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It just made me so happy to help another child to have a more positive <br/>
homeschooling experience. I wish I could instantly turn them all into happy <br/>
unschoolers, but I will have to try to keep from preaching too much and <br/>
just keep working on them little by little. Several have started to get <br/>
unschooling and now another one may be on her way. It feels good! :-)<br/>

Very cool Kornelia!  It breaks my heart when I see people ready to  give up <br/>
and send their kids back to school, because they can&#39;t get their kids to  do <br/>
the work, or the kid is miserable, or all they do is fight.  The first  words <br/>
out of my mouth are &quot;take a break for a while.&quot;  Then we talk about  just having <br/>
fun, or reading stories together, or baking, or going for a  walk.  But <br/>
especially asking the kids what THEY want to do.  Finding  out whey THEY&#39;RE <br/>
interested in.  Sharing their interests with the  kids.<br/>
