 </span></blockquote>Sounds like your son is really interested in electronics and electrical <br/>
things.  Maybe there is an outlet for him in a business that he could <br/>
volunteer at or take some community college course (talk to them about <br/>
letting him take it even though he may not be considered old enough).  Find <br/>
someone as a mentor that shares his passion for electrical experiments and <br/>
find out what they did when they were young.  Find a &quot;teacher&quot; (sorry to have <br/>
to use that word) that would be interested in working along side him with his <br/>
experiments.  <br/>
<br/>
The next part is actually meant to be sarcastic so please take it that way.  <br/>
Maybe your husband could actually get involved with your son in his <br/>
experiements rather than just deciding unschooling is not going to work and <br/>
you having to prove it does.<br/>
<br/>
What would happen if you didn&#39;t assign your 17 year old anything?  If you are <br/>
a religious family where the parents are supposed to be honored surely your <br/>
children wouldn&#39;t treat you with disrespect when you suggested unschooling <br/>
them?  <br/>
<br/>
This may sound strange but I am grateful to God and thank God every single <br/>
day that I&#39;m not religious and am spiritual instead.  I couldn&#39;t imagine what <br/>
a burden it would be to not only be unschooling but to have the wrath of <br/>
someone who was supposed to be my equal, judging my abilities to be at home <br/>
with the kids.  It must be a very suffocating way to live..... I admire you <br/>
for being able to live that way.  I certainly couldn&#39;t do it.<br/>

now his job takes him away from the family during the week. He is only home<br/>
on weekends and sometimes every other weekend. We are currently working<br/>
towards changing that, but it may be another year before he is home every<br/>

 Have you ever co-owned a business? Both partners are involved in decisions.<br/>
I could do whatever I wanted and unschool anyway, he is gone all week, but I<br/>
choose to respect his point of view, they are his children also. Initally he<br/>
was very unsure of homeschooling, but has seen how the children have grown<br/>
in it.  My husband is not a wrathful man and he is very supportive of the<br/>
work I do for our family.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What would happen if you didn&#39;t assign your 17 year old anything?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She was extremely bored and depressed, ate constantly and fought with her<br/>
brothers. She told me I was neglecting her educational needs. I think if she<br/>
is requesting the work, for her that is unschooling. My problem is if her<br/>
brother chooses to practice his drums all day and her other brother builds<br/>
Lego spaceships and movie scenes, they are goofing off and not learning<br/>
anything. I disagree.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552660454">okay, three.<br/>
<br/>
1) what would you do in my shoes<br/>
<br/>
2) How&#39;d I do? (trying out my new compassionate parenting skills)<br/>
<br/>
3) when a child seems naturally to not do well in social settings, <br/>
e.g. coming across as rude, what should a mom do?<br/>
<br/>
Scenario 1: We went to a friend&#39;s son&#39;s graduation last night. He has <br/>
been homeschooled and attended part time at the high school, and last <br/>
night he had a ceremony honoring him as he prepares to go to college.<br/>
<br/>
OUr first stop when we got to town was their house, where we had <br/>
about a half hour before heading over to the church where the <br/>
graduation was to be. Normally, their girl and our two younger put a <br/>
video in when we&#39;re visiting them, but this time, the TV was going to <br/>
remain off. With only a half hour or less, and with things like a <br/>
scooter and a pogo stick and bikes, there was plenty to do while my <br/>
friend and I said hello...etc. <br/>
<br/>
Robby (my 10yr old) tried out the pogo stick, and then came inside. <br/>
My girlfriend greeted him &quot;Hi Robby. Nice to see you.&quot; and Robby sort <br/>
of shrugged and mumbled something. Didn&#39;t even glance in my friend&#39;s <br/>
direction, let alone make eye contact or smile at her. And then he <br/>
went back outside. It wasn&#39;t a busy-kid-dashing-in-and-dashing-out <br/>
kind of thing, more like a big-deal-rolling-his-eyes kind of <br/>
attitude. <br/>
<br/>
When I got a chance alone with him, I said &quot;I think you could have <br/>
done better when L. said hello to you. Was there something wrong?&quot; <br/>
and he told me he was BORED. So I said being bored isn&#39;t an excuse to <br/>
be rude and asked him to demonstrate a more polite reply. He perked <br/>
up, smiled at me and did so &quot;Hi! It&#39;s nice to see you, too&quot;. And I <br/>
asked him to be THAT polite, the next time an opportunity presented <br/>
itself. And he said &quot;Okay.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Scenario 2: While we were waiting to leave for the graduation, my <br/>
friend&#39;s 11 year old girl said something complimentary to him (Nice <br/>
haircut) and he completely ignored her. It was like &quot;Hi Robby.&quot;  &quot;Hi <br/>
C.&quot;  &quot;Nice haircut&quot;  and he turned his back. This not from spite or <br/>
anything. They hadn&#39;t argued and he wasn&#39;t turning a cold shoulder. <br/>
He just didn&#39;t see the need to respond. So I said &quot;What dyou say, <br/>
Rob?&quot; and he turned, looked at his friend (they&#39;ve known each other <br/>
since birth) and said &quot;Thanks&quot; and then went outside. <br/>
<br/>
I had been proactive, telling them all beforehand, &quot;When you see (her <br/>
son) say hi and congratulations.&quot; and they managed to do that, but <br/>
didn&#39;t get a chance until after things were over and we were mingling <br/>
at the reception. And, after we left, I told them they did well. <br/>
There was some sitting and listening to speechifying, and a really <br/>
cool video vignette of his life, and presentation of the diplomas, <br/>
and they did well through that. But I also said &quot;We&#39;re going to have <br/>
to find some social things to get to, for you guys to practice <br/>
manners.&quot; or some such.<br/>
<br/>
any advice? anything you would do differently? <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I would just model what I think of as &#39;good manners&#39;. I have <br/>
a problem with &#39;forced manners&#39; and find them meaningless.<br/>
Maybe the child had a reason he didn&#39;t wish to respond to his friend <br/>
or maybe he felt the comment didn&#39;t need a response.<br/>
I tend to explain what other people expect in certain situations <br/>
like &#39;your granny has this idea that children should ask how she is. <br/>
It makes he happy and feel special if you do.&#39; I don&#39;t then force <br/>
them to do so.<br/>
This does mean however that some people to whom appearnaces are <br/>
everything find my kids rude or too shy or standoffish but when my <br/>
kids do greet someone or say thankyou or go up to someone and hug <br/>
them unexpectadly then its 100% genuine.<br/>
The 11 and 9yo tend to be reasonably &#39;polite&#39; although neither of <br/>
them puts up with bad behaviour from adults (which is why my mum <br/>
ain&#39;t speaking to me...) but the 8 yo is completely honest in his <br/>
feelings which upsets some people and may cause outsiders to think he <br/>
is &#39;rude&#39;.<br/>
I have explained to him what other people would like and the possible <br/>
problems that can be caused but then I leave it up to him. Luckily <br/>
for me real friends don&#39;t take it personally if he ignores them or <br/>
snaps sometimes. On other occasions he hugs them and tells them they <br/>
are great.<br/>
<br/>
It also helps that I do my utmost to avoid boring events where kids <br/>
will misbehave. Part of taking children seriously is to find out <br/>
their preferences about events before we go and they are never *made* <br/>
to go. I have enough horrible memories from my own childhood about <br/>
that!<br/>

Or I might&#39;ve, but I&#39;d feel REALLY bad right afterward. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
About ignoring people who talk to them, social situations won&#39;t help that.  I <br/>
think just reminders and modelling and finding examples of people being cold <br/>
or thoughtless and saying &quot;I bet that hurt [the other guy&#39;s] feelings,&quot; or <br/>
when you get a chance to see something in a story or movie or a stranger in <br/>
public, point it out?<br/>
<br/>
Holly had an old friend over for 25 hours.  They hadn&#39;t seen each other for a <br/>
long time, and then the other girl invited Holly to a sleepover birthday <br/>
party a week ago.  She kinda invited herself over here the next weekend (Friday).  <br/>
Though they did have quite a bit of fun, there were irritations, and Holly&#39;s <br/>
not interested in maintaining the friendship at that level.  It did serve as <br/>
reminders of some ways Holly doesn&#39;t want to be.  She stayed gracious to the <br/>
end, even leaving a picnic/birthday gathering after two and  hours that she <br/>
really did NOT want to leave, but the other girl was to be picked up at our house. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Holly was exhausted, though.  Rather than talk it all through in one big <br/>
lump, I&#39;ll stretch it over the next week or two to debrief her and let her express <br/>
and clarify what all happened and what she&#39;ll do next time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she needs another sleepover to practice, nor does she need to <br/>
invite others over she hasn&#39;t seen for a long time.  It&#39;s at a philosophical <br/>
level, and at this point has to do with her considering her social obligations, <br/>
her personal boundaries, and how she can maintain the friendship at a slower <br/>
speed and greater distance without hurting feelings.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re going to go somewhere, I remind kids of the general etiquette <br/>
expected, explain special circumstances if I know of any, and then let it play out <br/>
and we review on the way home.  So far so good, and the most frequent <br/>
clueless guy has been Marty (which made me worry some last October when he was at a <br/>
homeschooling conference while I was in the hospital and not there to remind <br/>
him to be quiet sometimes, and to slow down and see who else needs to shine.  (I <br/>
heard he did fine without coaching, but maybe they just SAID that... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262576777">HeidiC, <br/>
<br/>
Is Rob always like this or was this off kilter for him? Not that it makes a <br/>
huge difference though, I was just wondering. Some people are just not social. <br/>
It is not always about being rude with the intent to be rude. <br/>
<br/>
One of my best friends on this planet is like that. People always ask why she <br/>
is rude and never talks at gatherings. The funny thing is she&#39;s not ever <br/>
actually rude. She simply doesn&#39;t speak much, only says hello when someone else <br/>
says it first and sometimes she doesn&#39;t respond with anything but a slight, make <br/>
that a very slight grin. It all comes down to shyness for her. Not the hide <br/>
in a room kind of shy, just the &quot;I don&#39;t know them yet, so I stay quiet until I <br/>
do.&quot; However, this even occurs with people she has known for years. <br/>
Especially if I&#39;m not around (no pat on the back though she just tells me if I don&#39;t <br/>
attend she won&#39;t have anyone to talk to). I&#39;ve had mutual friends call and say <br/>
she never spoke at whatever they attended, or that she didn&#39;t talk until I got <br/>
there. I&#39;m a yacker, so since I&#39;m always saying something and I include her in <br/>
it, she has to respond. It also elivates her nervousness, at least that&#39;s <br/>
what she says. She also is well aware that people find her so stand offish, but <br/>
it&#39;s just a part of her personality and frankly I get irritated when people <br/>
want to debate it. She is who she is. And in my book, as long as she isn&#39;t mean <br/>
or hateful, then why take offense? But the world has become so victimized and <br/>
for some reason it&#39;s easier to stay in that state of mind then to accept <br/>
responsibility for one&#39;s own feelings and actions. You can only be offended if you <br/>
choose to take offense, just like only being manipulated, if you choose to be <br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
And then what if Rob was just a little grumpy that day. I mean he is human <br/>
and don&#39;t we all have bad days? Those days where nothing really has happened to <br/>
set you off, but you just feel kind of yuck. I think he should have the <br/>
freedom to feel yucky just as well as happy. It seems like he at least responding in <br/>
kind when you reminded him. <br/>
<br/>
I think overall you handled it well, but I also think you are putting too <br/>
much weight on it. And if it ends up being a part of his true personailty, then <br/>
would it be right to try to change that about him? His comfort zone in social <br/>
situations may never mirror your own, but isn&#39;t it better for him if you can <br/>
accept the difference than to try to alter it?<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda<br/>
<br/>
P.S. HeidiC, I just love how open you are to question your own actions and be <br/>
so willing to trust this list with whatever you may get in response. You are <br/>
simply awesome and your kids are lucky to have a mom so eager to change her <br/>
own parenting skills for their sakes, if she finds herself questioning her <br/>
responses.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know Robby, so this may not match for him.  I think just showing<br/>
politeness in front of him and especially WITH him would demonstrate it for<br/>
him.  I think alot of people like to feel their actions are appreciated.  I<br/>
think if a kid feels important, they may treat others as important. <br/>
<br/>
I believe pointing out an unintentional rude action every time it happens<br/>
could possibly just make it worse for any kid and embarrassed or even<br/>
resentful.  I also wouldn&#39;t tell the kids they need work on their manners. <br/>
I think that would make me feel like a schmuck  to be told that.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure that would even help as much as the parents modeling the behavior. <br/>
From what I&#39;ve seen, kids act just like their parents more than people<br/>
realize (for me to).  I&#39;m still working on it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, some kids just don&#39;t like to talk.  My 10yo is this way.  She&#39;s a much<br/>
stronger introvert than I am. :)  She likes people and will visit, but not<br/>
more than a day, if she can help it.  She&#39;s frequently irritated with her<br/>
siblings.  I gave her a room of her own.  She is the only one in the house<br/>
with a room all to herself.  It has helped alot.  She can go there when she<br/>
wants to be left alone, although she almost never wants to sleep in there..<br/>
she&#39;d rather sleep on the couch or with her sister.  <br/>
<br/>

I think you did well.  Compare it to what you would have done a year ago,<br/>
you might be quite relieved at how far you&#39;ve all come.    That&#39;s what I do<br/>
when I get guilt creeping up on me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your posts, Heidi, your questions have caused me to question<br/>
myself, which has been enlightening.  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s part of my true personality that I forget to write in check ledgers and <br/>
I lose receipts.<br/>
Is it right for people to try to change that about me?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, if I have a joint checking account with someone else!<br/>
<br/>
And in social terms, family members are sharing a social account, and if I <br/>
had a family member (this is hypothetical and goes beyond the original question, <br/>
so nobody freak out) who was very anti-social or just cold socially and who <br/>
had no interest in changing, I wouldn&#39;t take him to things like graduations or <br/>
weddings unless I stayed very close by him.    When he&#39;s grown and gets places <br/>
on his own speed (or doesn&#39;t) and wasn&#39;t on my invitation, he can be the way <br/>
he wants to (and keep track of his own checkbook or not, too).<br/>
<br/>
There are some things to accept, and some things to try to alter, at least at <br/>
the advisement and discussion level.  <br/>
<br/>
Some kid wipes boogers on the wall at my house once in a while.  It&#39;s not one <br/>
of the kids who lives here, because it never happens when there&#39;s nobody here <br/>
but us. It happens when there are big groups, and it&#39;s some kid who&#39;s been <br/>
coming for years.  One of six or seven.  I&#39;m not sure I WANT to know who, but I <br/>
wish his mom had discovered it and altered it out of his system years ago.    <br/>
That is one of many examples I could name which are NOT in the realm of things <br/>
I think parents should just accept.<br/>

<br/>
I agree wholeheartedly. My point to Heidi was that I thought she did an <br/>
excellent job of bringing Robby&#39;s attention to what she&#39;d expected of him in those <br/>
settings, yet he still needed prompting even thereafter. I&#39;m by no means meant <br/>
that she should just toss all hope out the window and expect that Robby will <br/>
never live up to her expectations of what manners she would like to see him <br/>
utilize. But I do think, aside from the possibility that Robby was just having a <br/>
bad day, that there may also be the possibility that Robby&#39;s personality <br/>
simply does not jive with hers in social settings.<br/>
<br/>
These are all hypotheticals and what ifs. But overall I find no harm in Heidi <br/>
reminding Robby how to be polite, but if is something that is a constant, <br/>
then I too, would perhaps stop bringing him into situations that he seems to not <br/>
be comfortably social in. I&#39;d also ask though, is it his comfort or mine I was <br/>
worried about.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; to find some social things to get to, for you guys to practice <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; manners.&quot; or some such.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; any advice? anything you would do differently? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I just wouldn&#39;t have said that last thing.<br/>
&gt; Or I might&#39;ve, but I&#39;d feel REALLY bad right afterward. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, not RIGHT afterward, but by this morning I was saying &quot;Sheesh, <br/>
rude!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; About ignoring people who talk to them, social situations won&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>help that.  I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think just reminders and modelling and finding examples of people <br/>

 </span></blockquote>stranger in <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; public, point it out?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good idea, too. I also am thinking, a role-playing Etiquette <br/>
Afternoon or some such, with different pretend scenarios where <br/>
different polite behavior would be appropriate, throwing plenty of <br/>
silly &quot;manners&quot; in there, like Pinkies UP! and Stirring Our Tea <br/>
Without Dinging The Cup, and just having a fun time with it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Holly was exhausted, though.  Rather than talk it all through in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>one big <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lump, I&#39;ll stretch it over the next week or two to debrief her and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>let her express <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and clarify what all happened and what she&#39;ll do next time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good. Stretching it over a longer period of time, rather than jumping <br/>
in feet first and yakking about everything all at once. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
When we&#39;re going to go somewhere, I remind kids of the general <br/>
etiquette <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; expected, explain special circumstances if I know of any, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah! One of the things I did well this time, IMO, was to be <br/>
proactive, and explain the situation we were going into (more formal <br/>
than usual) and reminded them to shake hands and smile at the <br/>
graduate, congratulate him, etc. before we got out of the car. <br/>
<br/>
I gotta say, too, before starting to think &quot;How can I be the most <br/>
compassionate in my parenting?&quot; I probably wouldn&#39;t have even noticed <br/>
behavior that was this &quot;slightly&quot; off. Would&#39;ve just sat down to <br/>
visit w/my girlfriend and ignored the kids. Being more attentive to <br/>
the things they want to do with their time, day to day, has meant <br/>
more attentiveness to everything, and having this &quot;Compassionate <br/>
Parenting&quot; in the back of my mind has changed how I respond when they <br/>
do goof. <br/>
<br/>
thanks again! I tap the experience here and gain greatly from it!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I don&#39;t think he intended to be rude, though he was cranky when <br/>
we got there, because the TV was to remain off. He isn&#39;t shy, per se. <br/>
Not super outgoing, but friendly enough with other kids. Just <br/>
clueless. He does tend to be like this. I&#39;ve seen him waltz into my <br/>
mom&#39;s house and not say hello as he beelines it to either the kitchen <br/>
or the TV...even failing to say hi in reply when someone greets him.  <br/>
<br/>
My hubby isn&#39;t the greatest social interacter in the world, either. <br/>
Like &quot;You mean, when someone says Hi you say Hi back? Really?&quot; that <br/>
IS how he is. In fact, on his b-day, we had a dinner for him at my <br/>
folks&#39; house, and as food was getting passed around the table, I <br/>
said &quot;well, this is Jim&#39;s b-day. Happy Birthday, honey&quot; and everyone <br/>
said happy birthday to him, and he sort of smirk/grinned and kept <br/>
dishing his food and never said nothin...that is how clueless he can <br/>
be. And maybe Rob just takes after his dad a bit. Which is okay. If <br/>
he&#39;s a wallflower, so be it. I&#39;m not going to force him to be Mr. <br/>
Social.<br/>
<br/>
BUT!!! my hubby&#39;s ... social backwardness...has set him back as an <br/>
adult. I would say, in at least one case, he failed to get a job <br/>
based on this cluelessness at an interview. (I know about it, becaues <br/>
a good friend of mine works where he was interviewing, and told me <br/>
what the interviewer said about it, trying to help out) I&#39;ve wondered <br/>
if he makes a poor first impression, leaving him out of some things <br/>
that would make a more fulfilling, happier life for him. I&#39;d much <br/>
rather my kids don&#39;t follow in those footsteps QUITE exactly!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One of my best friends on this planet is like that. People always <br/>

hesitant with friends, to be open. But she is generally polite, <br/>
answering when spoken to and the like. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She is who she is. And in my book, as long as she isn&#39;t mean <br/>

could just convince them to say hello and bye to the host/ess and to say <br/>
&quot;thanks&quot; a lot.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a range of possibilities between punishing behaviors you don&#39;t like <br/>
and ignoring easily-amended glitches.  It doesn&#39;t have to be (and shouldn&#39;t be) <br/>
all or nothing.<br/>

<br/>
  No more than it would be right for me to try and change my hubby.<br/>
<br/>
  His comfort zone in social <br/>
  &gt; situations may never mirror your own, but isn&#39;t it better for him <br/>
  if you can <br/>
  &gt; accept the difference than to try to alter it?<br/>
<br/>
  yeah. I&#39;m thinking, with some Faux Pas Practice and a proactive <br/>
  reminder about the social situations and what manners are appropriate <br/>
  as they come up, he may remain a quiet type but capable of dredging <br/>
  up normal, polite responses when necessary. <br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Just my thoughts,<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Rhonda<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; P.S. HeidiC, I just love how open you are to question your own <br/>
  actions and be <br/>
  &gt; so willing to trust this list with whatever you may get in <br/>
  response. You are <br/>
  &gt; simply awesome and your kids are lucky to have a mom so eager to <br/>
  change her <br/>
  &gt; own parenting skills for their sakes, if she finds herself <br/>
  questioning her <br/>
  &gt; responses.<br/>
<br/>
  thanks, Rhonda. I&#39;m so much more aware than I used to be. &quot;Old-time&quot; <br/>
  parenting practices are SO oriented towards misbehavior. I&#39;m happy to <br/>
  be on the look-out for their Goodness, and also happy to keep <br/>
  compassion in the front of my mind, when they mess up. Like the <br/>
  slurpee spill someone described. How excellent! to treat that with <br/>
  kindness and patience.<br/>
<br/>
  anyways thanks for the advice and the kind words!<br/>

I think ten is young and not every child develops that awareness of<br/>
others feelings at a young age.<br/>
You can model polite responses to chit chat and compliments and he&#39;ll<br/>
eventually get it.   <br/>
<br/>
I used to thank the person on Dylan&#39;s behalf.   I would say &quot;thank you<br/>
for sharing that&quot;  or &quot;that was nice of you to say you like his hair,<br/>
thank you&quot;.    If  Dylan didn&#39;t remember to say thank you, then the<br/>
person still had acknowledgement and if he did then they were thanked<br/>
twice.   <br/>
<br/>
Dylan is eleven and very polite.  More polite than many of his friends<br/>
who still endure some coaching from their moms and dads --&quot;what do you<br/>
say???&quot;--   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; at home from mom and dad, (and patience &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
will go a long way.  <br/>

social interactions. I am not too bad at this but there are some things I <br/>
had to learn to do that do not come naturally to me, like looking the other <br/>
person in the eye when meeting and addressing. Of course, eating with <br/>

enjoy using fork and spoon.<br/>

just seems natural to do this for a shy or young child, something I did <br/>
before they could talk and continue to do until they can do it for <br/>
themselves. I guess this is just one of many things we do when being <br/>
mindful of our children&#39;s stages of development regardless of their age.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682344008">From: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; any advice? anything you would do differently? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found with Joseph and Sierra., once in awhile a situation would come up<br/>
when I would think a thank you would be nice from them and they didn&#39;t say<br/>
it. It bothered me and I would do the whole &quot;say thank you&quot; thing and they<br/>
would say it then. I started to really think about it and why they didn&#39;t do<br/>
it and why it bothered me. My kids weren&#39;t really being rude at all. From<br/>
what I could see, they were just being kids and had no clue most of the time<br/>
that someone would be &quot;expecting&quot; a thank you or just very involved in the<br/>
moment or just having their brain be somewhere else. So I figured what&#39;s the<br/>
harm really? They&#39;re still kids and Tara certainly is very polite and where<br/>
did she get it from? Us and watching.<br/>
<br/>
So now I just leave it to me doing what I feel is proper and sometimes I<br/>
just offer thank you&#39;s for them. Sierra can be very shy at times and<br/>
sometimes a thank you is just too much for her. I won&#39;t push that and I<br/>
won&#39;t &quot;make them&quot; offer politeness without sincerity. I know they will get<br/>
it eventually.<br/>
<br/>
And if there are times when I think maybe with a friend something would have<br/>
been nice other than what was done, I&#39;ll talk to them about it. Reminding<br/>
them how when they do something for each other, they like to be thanked for<br/>
it and wouldn&#39;t it make someone else feel nice too? We do a lot of talking<br/>
here about our feelings with each other and then relating that to other<br/>
people as well. Asking how would that make you feel or what would be nice<br/>
for you to do??? They even like this kind of talking to, it gives them<br/>
another outlook on things and they like coming up with different ways or<br/>
wondering how other people would feel.<br/>

When Kirby was three, four, five, he would kinda have a fit when we picked <br/>
him up from a friend&#39;s house, and wouldn&#39;t want to leave, so I got into a <br/>
routine of saying, &quot;I think what Kirby means is he was having a really wonderful <br/>
time and would love to come again soon!&quot;  Something to that effect made him and <br/>
them have a parting thought not of him as a crazed tantrum-boy (because he <br/>
hadn&#39;t been until time to go) but as someone who liked them so much he didn&#39;t want <br/>
to go home.<br/>
<br/>
Weird, but worked.<br/>
<br/>
He still doesn&#39;t like for things to end or change.  It&#39;s just a part of him.  <br/>
But he&#39;s learned himself to say &quot;I hope we do this again,&quot; and other similar <br/>
self-comfort and other-comforting things.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Is it right for people to try to change that about me?<br/>
 <br/>
 Yes, if I have a joint checking account with someone else! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     No one has the &quot;right&quot; to change someone else.  Sure, they have the <br/>
right to say, &quot;hey, this affects me, I&#39;m letting you know that this bothers me,&quot; <br/>
but, besides that, we&#39;re getting dangerously close to co-dependent behavior.  <br/>
Probably just the wording, here, but, my alarm bells went off.  <br/>
<br/>
This does remind me of a situation with my hubby.  He tended to keep the <br/>
receipts for the week in his wallet, and not give it to me to enter into the money <br/>
software until *after* I paid bills.  Meant grocery shopping that week was <br/>
tough.   After a few times of having no ham for his lunch, and finding out why, <br/>
he started remembering to enter the transactions.  I didn&#39;t have to change <br/>
him, even tho you could argue I had the right.   Ultimately, it just made sense <br/>
to him to remember.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And in social terms, family members are sharing a social account, and if I <br/>
had a family member&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is a slippery slope.  This can easily turn into enmeshed <br/>
boundaries if you&#39;re not careful.  Children are individuals, even as part of the <br/>
&quot;entity of family&quot; ( which I personally don&#39;t deem to be THAT important, in and of <br/>
itself).  Anyway, I think it is much easier for a child to explore their own <br/>
way of interacting with the world without worrying about how their affecting <br/>
some &quot;familial social account balance&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There are some things to accept, and some things to try to alter, at least <br/>
at <br/>
the advisement and discussion level.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 The child will decide if it&#39;s something they want to change, or not.  We <br/>
can&#39;t forget that it&#39;s ultimately up to them.  Inform them of our perspective, <br/>
yes, attempt to change, is dicey, because whose standards will we be using, our <br/>
own? I think a parent has to make that clear, then.  The point is to help them <br/>
develop their own standards, not to coerce them to adopt our own.  <br/>
<br/>
Being nitpicky ( or is that booger picky?....ew!) <br/>

The question was &quot;is it right,&quot; not &quot;Does a person have the &#39;right&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I found out at the age of 40 that I had been doing something really <br/>
irritating that would have been easy to change if I&#39;d only known, it would have been <br/>
right (better, and not evil) if someone who loved me had told me sooner that <br/>
with a little tweak I could be easier to live with.  Especially if they&#39;re the <br/>

Delaware is not a set place but I&#39;d like to find a place that is just heavily <br/>
