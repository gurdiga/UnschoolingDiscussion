Heresies Among Us — “Why does God permit his flock not only to be pastured <br/>
by His shepherds but also attacked by wolves, who disguise themselves as <br/>
shepherds in order to seize the sheep on the sly and tear them? God could <br/>
prevent this; why doesn’t He do it? God’s Word mentions two reasons … God <br/>
permits it partly to test His children, partly to punish unthankful hearers. <br/>
Paul says to the Corinthians: ‘For there must be also heresies among you, <br/>
that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.’ (I Cor. 11:19) <br/>
