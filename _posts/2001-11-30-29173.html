No I&#39;m not.  Don&#39;t claim to be.  Never said I was.<br/>

Yes you have put in nice medical terminology that people have difficulty<br/>
reading and possibly in other skills associated with reading.  Now, that is<br/>
a nice theory.  Can you cite sources that talk about the &quot;real&quot; medical<br/>
underpinnings of learning disorders, that rule out anxiety as possible<br/>
cause?  The brain and neurology are not very well understood at all.  And<br/>
taking posts about &quot;real&quot; dyslexia at face value is tremendously risky.<br/>
