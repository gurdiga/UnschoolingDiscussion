<div id="ygrps-yiv-804588059">****Ah, a mind reader. I was thinking the same thing. It has happened<br/>
quite<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; often too and not just recently. I wonder also about the thousand<br/>
 </span></blockquote>people<br/>
who<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; don&#39;t write in at all. I&#39;m sure at least some of then would like to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe, maybe not.  I tend to post a fair bit on any list I belong to.<br/>
My<br/>
daughter tends to never post on any list she joins.  We both benefit<br/>
greatly<br/>
from the lists we&#39;re on.  We just have different styles.  I suspect that<br/>
the<br/>
people who aren&#39;t posting are for the most part happy just to read and<br/>
learn.  Why would they stay if just reading wasn&#39;t enough and they were<br/>
wanting to post but afraid?<br/>

<br/>
I only post very rarely, so I would probably consider myself one of the<br/>
thousand.  I don&#39;t post because 9 times out of 10 the question or issue<br/>
that I have been thinking about comes up at the right time.  No need for<br/>
me to post.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for as good as I think I am with a paintbrush or sewing - I am not<br/>
a very good writer.   It&#39;s ok, but I can&#39;t paint you a picture of how I<br/>
feel or what I&#39;m thinking, I need to be able to say it in words, and<br/>
that&#39;s not where my skill lies.  But I do enjoy it here (heck I even<br/>
like it when things get all soap opera-y) and have really learned here.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t change the tone of the list, it works just like it is.<br/>

I&#39;m also on the digest and a little behind.</div>
