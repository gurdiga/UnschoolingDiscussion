all that. I am from FL, and I would be leary of anything that was on the east <br/>
coast (from this summer) I would also want to know what section of town it is <br/>
in... Keep me updated. Florida is a wonderful place and there are many things <br/>
that you could do. And if you had an address there, most of the attractions <br/>
(Walt Disney, Busch Gardens, Cypress Gardens, etc.) are cheaper!<br/>

       I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>

    Of course we would love hubby to go and it is very unselfish of him to <br/>
permit us. He has a business to run also, though may be able to come visit if <br/>
we do it. He will go like you say, later. For us when a few more kids are <br/>
gone.<br/>

    Thanks and I would pay attention to the details. I do have a friend who <br/>
lives in Fla. and may just see if anything is available near her, even for a <br/>
month would be fun.<br/>

We have and we loved it.  My mil has a little cabin in the woods in northern <br/>
WI that people use pretty much only in the summer.  A couple of years ago, I <br/>
took my children up and spent from Sept-early Nov. just living in nature.  My <br/>
dh came up on weekends when he could.  Though the cabin tended to get <br/>
confining sometimes, we had a grand time and learned tons.  It also helped <br/>
her because there was somebody there to keep an eye on things.  Go for it!!<br/>

I&#39;m so jealous.  We used to have a cabin in Land O Lakes, and we spent all our<br/>
summers there.  I was so lucky.  I miss it terribly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962859499">Hi, yes in Fl. places rent out for short term for tourist. I live near Cocoa <br/>
Beach and they do that all the time for  winter especially. I didn&#39;t <br/>
understand is it a young person or adult? If they are as young as 18 or <br/>
younger you as the parent should call ahead and explain the situation and pay <br/>
in advance as that might cause problems. Hope it works out and have fun!  <br/>
