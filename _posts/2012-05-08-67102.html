<div id="ygrps-yiv-379790938">Hi everyone,    I know a lot of parents in the unschooling community<br/>
either have a business or would like to have a side business, and more<br/>
and more of the kids are starting up their own businesses as well, so I<br/>
thought this book recommendation would be appropriate for the list.<br/>
The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau goes on sale today. I had the<br/>
pleasure of meeting Chris when he came to Toronto for his Art of<br/>
Non-Conformity self-promotion book tour - I recommend that book and his<br/>
blog as well since we&#39;re all non-conformists here to a significant<br/>
extent - and he sent me a preview copy of his new book. After reading<br/>
it, I bought another copy to share.<br/>
<br/>
As a Dad who has started several businesses in various industries over<br/>
the past 8 years, and whose family is currently supported by our<br/>
business efforts, this topic is near and dear to my heart. I wish I had<br/>
this book 8 years ago, and learned a lot from it that is still relevant<br/>
to my both my new business, my future business ideas, and my existing<br/>
business.<br/>
<br/>
The book is not about Shark Tank or Dragon&#39;s Den style strike it rich<br/>
startup ideas to be the next Google, its about using the skills and<br/>
interests and resources you have right now to create a business that is<br/>
right for you and the life you want to live. While Chris has been<br/>
successfully self-employed for years now, and it has supported his<br/>
mission to visit all 175 UN recognized countries before he turns 35 (and<br/>
he&#39;s got about a dozen left for his last year) and is a wealth of<br/>
experience and ideas, that&#39;s not even the full power of the book. He<br/>
interviewed 1500 other entrepreneurs from all over the world in any<br/>
industry you could find, all of whom created a full time income of<br/>
$50,000 or more, and you get to learn from these case studies throughout<br/>
the book.<br/>
<br/>
Of special note to us, two of the families featured are unschoolers who<br/>
now support themselves from their businesses, as well as other<br/>
momtrepreneurs. So while Chris doesn&#39;t have kids, the book certainly<br/>
shows the way for those of us that do.<br/>
<br/>
Its very well written, edited and structured - and has great practical<br/>
tools and a companion website and supportive community around it. There<br/>
are specific templates for everything from your mission statement to<br/>
business plan to plans for sales offers, launch, and promotion. I&#39;ve<br/>
never read a better book about starting a new business today, whether<br/>
online or very traditional or both.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend it for all the parents out there who have a business<br/>
already, or have a business idea, or wish they could add some kind of a<br/>
side business to their family life to better support their unschooling<br/>
lifestyle. We chose to start businesses so that we could create the time<br/>
flexibility for us both to be at home with our little guys, and I know<br/>
that resonates with a lot of people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also recommend it even more strongly to any of your kids who have<br/>
business ideas, or are interested in understanding what it takes to<br/>
start up a business. One of these stories may inspire them to create<br/>
something amazing in their lives.<br/>

and please take the opportunity to meet up with him when he comes to a<br/>
city near you on his self-financed book tour on the tour page. I&#39;ll be<br/>
at the Toronto event again, and would love to meet you if you are too!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Holly (20) is looking ever more seriously into ideas involving small-venue music production and was asking me questions just yesterday that I couldn&#39;t answer. :-)<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s planning to take some business classes at the community college and has a boyfriend in a punk band.  They go to small local shows three or four time a week, and she&#39;s fascinated by the buildings--some old industrial shops, some old storefronts, some residential houses--and how people decide what to do where, when and why.<br/>
