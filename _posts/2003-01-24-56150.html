<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897801790">WE found darkBASIC online.<br/>
ARe there any programs that are FREE that we can use, or are they all something we have to purchase?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious before we start buying.<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
