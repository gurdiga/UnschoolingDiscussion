&lt;&lt; I believe children sometimes need guidance whether <br/>
they actually learn from it is up to them,  but if my son really <br/>
wants his bike or whatever  he will need to learn to accept the rules <br/>
first.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Punishment isn&#39;t guidance.  Be honest with yourself about what you&#39;re doing.  <br/>
Just call it punishment.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If my son really wants to watch Dexter&#39;s lab on television <br/>
he will put his clothes in the laundry room  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he really wants to appease you he will do what you say.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t learning why and how, it&#39;s learning what and when.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I  guess I don&#39;t teach my kids  I let them decide what is important  <br/>
with hope they will see it the same way I do,  but not necessarily <br/>
expecting that they will. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re teaching your kids a lot, but maybe they will figure out other ways to <br/>
convey the ideas to their kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I not only expect that my kids will see things in the same kindly and <br/>
peaceful light I do, I KNOW they will.  I know it from experience, and from <br/>
practice and intent to help make it that way.  I have become confident over <br/>
the years that if I am right FIRST, and am really careful about my own <br/>
motivations, that we will have very little to argue about.   Instead of <br/>
coming from wherever I am, right or wrong, and making them do what I say <br/>
(certainly what many parents around me do now and have in the past), I go to <br/>
where I want them to be (morally, socially, emotionally) and they gladly meet <br/>
me there.<br/>
<br/>
I learned these ideas from moms whose kids were a little older than mine <br/>
were, and who were consciously and mindfully being the kinds of parents they <br/>
wished they themselves had had.<br/>
<br/>
My kids and I are together, not separate.  I don&#39;t mean physically, I mean in <br/>
purpose and direction.  We all want for all of us to be happy, and at peace, <br/>
and not afraid.  We want for all of us to be fed and safe and to have a good <br/>
place to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t you get to the stop sign first and stop and smile back at your kids <br/>
instead of getting their second with a threat?  Or put him in charge of stop <br/>
sign safety.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment breeds resentment.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way around that.<br/>

Have a 4 year old ride a 16&quot; bike with training wheels and try to <br/>
stay next to him and watch for cars behind him  and have a 7 year old <br/>
who rides a 24&quot;  bike and see who gets to the stop sign first.  I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17216009">I really do not feel that it is &quot;punishment&quot; to tell your son or daughter<br/>
that they need to pick something up, or sweep the floor before they watch tv<br/>
or play with their legos.<br/>
<br/>
Before we leave our home, I expect the house to be half way neat and clean.<br/>
So, I say &quot;guys, lets to a quick pick-up before we leave so when we come<br/>
home we don&#39;t have to do it&quot;.  If they don&#39;t want to, I say that it needs to<br/>
be done, and everyone will do their part.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I am right in there with them doing it.  It would be one thing if I was<br/>
not doing the same thing.  We do not make beds very often, mostly for<br/>
company, because to me, it just does not matter, and I personally love<br/>
getting into my bed when it has been the same since I got out of it.<br/>
<br/>
However, on occasion, I feel it necessary to make beds.  So, I tell them to<br/>
make their beds.  If they don&#39;t, then there is a consequence.  Again I do<br/>
not feel it is punishment.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I respect the decisions that my children have made.  Such<br/>
as &quot;Mom, could we just put all the &quot;whatever&quot;, here in the living room from<br/>
now on, since we play with them all the time.&quot;  I usually say &quot;sure&quot;.  As I<br/>
want them to respect decisions that I make, I also want to respect the<br/>
decisions that are really, really important to them.  Our oldest, especially<br/>
likes to make some household rules, which I think is so cool.  Sure, maybe<br/>
he learned that from me, and he is the oldest typical overly responsible<br/>
child, but his brothers like to say their concerns also.<br/>
<br/>
We have &quot;family meeting night&quot;.  Not on a regular scheduled basis, but<br/>
whenever someone has something to say that would affect the whole family.<br/>
Anyone can call a family meeting.  Sometimes it is to say &quot;noone can put<br/>
their shoes on the front step cause we are all tripping over them&quot;, or &quot;from<br/>
now on, I will pour my own cereal&quot;.  Whatever is important to them.<br/>
<br/>
I think it has to do with respect for one another.<br/>
<br/>
One family meeting that we had went crazy!  We sat down to discuss the<br/>
kitchen chores, and how everyone WANTS to help out.  It was amazing the<br/>
things my kids thought of doing.  Then, they decided on the consequences (of<br/>
their own accord) of not doing them.  One was to not be able to use the<br/>
computer for one month.  I had to get out the calendar and explain to my 5<br/>
1/2, 7 and 9 year olds how long that was for not clearing the table!<br/>
<br/>
I just do not want to be a Mom stuck with doing ALL the work.  I feel this<br/>
especially because I have three sons to gently guide into this world.<br/>
<br/>
Family meetings are great.  We speak ALL on the SAME level, discuss anything<br/>
we want, weighing the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old likes to drag ALL his toys into the living room.  Their room<br/>
is messy, ok it is completely TRASHED because that is the way I like it.<br/>
However, I want the living room to be clean, so I do not step on things and<br/>
I don&#39;t have to panic when we have an unexpected visitor.  So, it was time<br/>
to pick up for the evening, and I told him to take his Bionicle collection<br/>
back to his room.  He did not want to because &quot;his room was too messy&quot;.  I<br/>
said &quot;ok, then what if you play in the LR because your room is too messy,<br/>
then when the living room is to messy, you have to play in the dining room,<br/>
etc......&quot;.  He totlly cracked up laughing, and his brothers followed suit.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of this discussion has to do with each individual family and<br/>
how they function.  Also, what level of chaos a person can handle.  I have<br/>
friends, good friends, that have totally trashed houses.  I LOVE these<br/>
people.  I enjoy my time with them at their homes or mine.  However, I would<br/>
never be able to be at ease in my own home with such a mess.  Believe me, I<br/>
am not a neat freak.  There are two bike helmets sitting next to me on the<br/>
floor, a pair of balled up socks, a lamb stuffed anima., a newspaper picture<br/>
of spider man, some Bionicle pieces and a captain hook thing.  It is fine<br/>
for now, but eventually I will ask the boys to put them away, and it will be<br/>
&quot;before dinner&quot;, or &quot;before a movie&quot;, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you I do this discipline with myself, as I am sure we all do.  Haven&#39;t<br/>
you ever said in your mind that I will buy that new outfit when I loose<br/>
three pounds.  Or, if I eat the ice cream today, I will not have some<br/>
tomorrow.  Or, as soon as I finish this (knitting, scrapbooking, herb<br/>
garden, etc...) then I will buy that new (whatever&gt;..).<br/>
<br/>
I do this all the time, it is my own self discipline.<br/>
<br/>
No, I am not trying to impose my own self discipline onto my children, but<br/>
if I am totally freaked out about the living room being a disaster area,<br/>
don&#39;t I have a right to tell them they need to pick everything up before<br/>
they get out the next game/turn on a movie/play on the computer or whatever?<br/>
I do not think it is disrespectful.  In my case, I am talking about younger<br/>
children.  Their rooms are their rooms.  That is THEIR space.  The living<br/>
room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom are COMMUNITY spaces, that deserve the<br/>
respect as set up in our family meetings.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I have been quiet with all this discussion, and I hope I worded it all<br/>
right.<br/>

But, you misunderstood.......I tell them, they need to pick up the toys<br/>

<br/>
If they don&#39;t do it, then I remind them, what we have to do FIRST, in order<br/>
to what they want to do next.<br/>
<br/>
So, it is not a punishment, maybe a consequence, but I do not at all relay<br/>
it as being negative, just a matter of fact thing to do.  It hardly ever<br/>
happens that they do not do what they need to do in order to do what they<br/>
are wanting to do.  Occasionally it does happen, and we talk about how it<br/>
could of been different in a loving and rational way, then we change the<br/>
subject and find something else fun to do when the project is done.  Often I<br/>
share stories of my childhood with them, and they think it is so funny that<br/>
&quot;Mom used to be just like us&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, I have tried other approaches, and keeping positive, with lots<br/>
of dialoge always works best for us.  Yes, there are times things don&#39;t get<br/>
done as much as I would of liked, as long as they make their best effort, I<br/>
am fine with it.  Again, the only rooms in the house I worry about are the<br/>
common rooms, living room, dining room, kitchen.  I take care of the main<br/>
bathroom, because well, they are all boys, and they MISS all the time, and I<br/>
don&#39;t want them getting sick.......They can take over when they are much<br/>
older.<br/>

<br/>
Man, when I express frustration over the messy living room, my 9 year old<br/>
would automatically take over and clean the WHOLE thing all by himself.  His<br/>
little brothers would simply WATCH!  AAAHHHHH!!  This is why I do the &quot;when<br/>
the living room is clean, you can all go outside&quot;, etc.....  I think with<br/>
multiple children maybe it is more necessary.  Especially with my oldest<br/>
naturally taking on so much responsibility.  I hear it is very common with<br/>
the oldest child in a family to be that way, but I feel so bad for him and<br/>
encourage him not to pick up after his little brothers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How are you defining punishment?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s dictionary.com, via google:<br/>
<br/>

making beds, whatever - you are punishing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am not afraid of the word &quot;punishment&quot;.  It happens all the time in this<br/>
world.  Our neighbor went to jail for child molestation.  Punishment.  If<br/>
you choose to speed in your car, you get a ticket.  Punishment.  If you do<br/>
not pay the power pill you have no electricity.  Punishment.  You can use<br/>
the term as lightly or as heavily as you want I suppose.  Punishment then, I<br/>
guess is not a bad thing, it just IS in many cases a consequence of your own<br/>
decisions.  It does not matter how old you are, or how serious the issue, a<br/>
consequence is part of the natural process of decision making.  With in<br/>
reason, obviously in a family where respect is a high priority.  You can<br/>
still have your child face consequences in a very loving and respectful<br/>
manner, especially if it is dangerous, i.e. purposely running a stop sign!!<br/>
Our son when he was four years old was told time and time again to stay in<br/>
our own driveway with his pedal tractor.  One day, he decided to head down<br/>
the middle of the street (very lightly traveled).  I told him &quot;no no&quot;, and<br/>
he went ahead and did whatever he wanted to do.  I finally caught up with<br/>
him, and the tractor was put away for one week.  He never did it again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945975054">This is the same way I think  I just couldn&#39;t say it as well!   Great <br/>
job explaining!<br/>
<br/>

I am not afraid of the word &quot;punishment&quot;. It happens all the time in <br/>
this<br/>
world. Our neighbor went to jail for child molestation. Punishment. If<br/>
you choose to speed in your car, you get a ticket. Punishment. If you <br/>
do<br/>
not pay the power pill you have no electricity. Punishment. You can <br/>
use<br/>
the term as lightly or as heavily as you want I suppose. Punishment <br/>
then, I<br/>
guess is not a bad thing, it just IS in many cases a consequence of <br/>
your own<br/>
decisions. It does not matter how old you are, or how serious the <br/>
issue, a<br/>
consequence is part of the natural process of decision making. With in<br/>
reason, obviously in a family where respect is a high priority. You <br/>
can<br/>
still have your child face consequences in a very loving and <br/>
respectful<br/>
manner, especially if it is dangerous, i.e. purposely running a stop <br/>
sign!!<br/>
Our son when he was four years old was told time and time again to <br/>
stay in<br/>
our own driveway with his pedal tractor. One day, he decided to head <br/>
down<br/>
the middle of the street (very lightly traveled). I told him &quot;no no&quot;, <br/>
and<br/>
he went ahead and did whatever he wanted to do. I finally caught up <br/>
with<br/>
him, and the tractor was put away for one week. He never did it again.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they don&#39;t want to, I say that it needs to<br/>
&gt; be done, and everyone will do their part.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And in the interests of clarity I think it&#39;s important to recognize that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t *need* to be done. What dire consequences will happen if it doesn&#39;t?<br/>
You *want* it to be done so that the system you&#39;ve come up with to maintain<br/>
*your* standards can operate. It&#39;s your *choice* to keep the house at that<br/>
standard. No one will arrest you if your house falls below a certain<br/>
standard. (Provided it&#39;s healthy of course!)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to eat 3 meals a day. We don&#39;t need to have dinner on the<br/>
table at 6. We don&#39;t need to have a set bed time. We don&#39;t need to keep the<br/>
house to a certain standard of tidiness. We don&#39;t have to make sure the kids<br/>
go to school and do their homework. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean let chaos reign ;-) It means learning to see that almost<br/>
everything we do is a choice rather than a &quot;have to&quot; or &quot;need to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of problems arise from confusing the solution with the problem. Such as<br/>
assuming that having difficulties getting the kids to school and getting<br/>
their homework done is the problem. But the real problem -- to which school<br/>
is one (albeit poor ;-) solution -- is providing an environment so the kids<br/>
can learn.<br/>
<br/>
Such as assuming that having difficulties making dinner in the evening when<br/>
the kids are tired and hungry is the problem. It isn&#39;t. The real problem is<br/>
that people get hungry and need food. That *doesn&#39;t* mean the only solution<br/>
is making &quot;a meal&quot; for the whole family to eat together at 6. It just means<br/>
people need access to food when they&#39;re hungry. Which is a problem with far<br/>
more potential solutions than the &quot;problem&quot; of making dinner.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s liberating to realize that we don&#39;t have to clean the living room. We<br/>
can look at it as a gift *we* want to give to the family. That sounds like a<br/>
50&#39;s Suzy Homemaker sentiment ;-) But the Suzy Homemaker mind set assumes<br/>
that the rest of the family wants a certain standard and expects mom to<br/>
maintain it. If that&#39;s true, then there are way deeper problems involved<br/>
than getting the house clean! And we don&#39;t have to give them a gift of a<br/>
tidy house if doesn&#39;t feel like a gift. We could give them a meal, a mom<br/>
made quilt, snuggle time on the couch with a book, anything that gives us<br/>
pleasure to provide. If we do it for ourselves as a gift to them, then we<br/>
don&#39;t build up resentment if they don&#39;t appreciate it. If we do then we<br/>
should rethink why we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re doing!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hey, I am right in there with them doing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a biggie. (It&#39;s even bigger if the kids are there voluntarily.) It&#39;s<br/>
a real wake up call when you hear your own reasonable sounding words come<br/>
out of your child directed at you. Many years ago I heard my daughter echo<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s your mess, you&#39;re the one who needs to clean it up.&quot; Yikes! Not at all<br/>
the type of thinking I was hoping to foster. I realized if I wanted her to<br/>
say &quot;Here, let me help,&quot; then I had to say it to her and project the<br/>
attitude that we&#39;re all in this together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, on occasion, I feel it necessary to make beds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again the language is important in how we view something. It isn&#39;t<br/>
necessary. It&#39;s something that you want to acheive. The gift of an orderly<br/>
atmosphere for your guests perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, I tell them to<br/>
&gt; make their beds.  If they don&#39;t, then there is a consequence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The consequence of not making a bed is a bed that is not made.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; So, I tell them to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; make their beds.  If they don&#39;t, then there is a consequence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;The consequence of not making a bed is a bed that is not made. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WORST CASE SCENARIOS:<br/>
<br/>
The consequence of not making a bed in the presence of a volatile mom is that <br/>
the inaction could set off a volatile mom.<br/>
<br/>
But the solution to that problem for many kids and lots of later-teens is to <br/>
get the heck away from the volatile mom by any means.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t want to set up a situation where my kids wake up thinking <br/>
&quot;am I 18 yet!?&quot; or wishing I would be gone from their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And as analogies go, these kinds of consequences are the defense of abusive <br/>
husbands.  &quot;Well if she had had dinner on the table, I wouldn&#39;t have gotten <br/>
mad.&quot;<br/>
&quot;If the house wasn&#39;t a mess I wouldn&#39;t be violent.&quot;<br/>
&quot;If she wouldn&#39;t talk back, she wouldn&#39;t get hit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Oh wait, that second one was the defense of my abusive-parent friends, <br/>
neighbors and relatives when I was a kid, only it was &quot;Don&#39;t talk back to ME <br/>
or I&#39;ll backhand you.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting there are people here who are into that level of cruelty <br/>
or violence.  But I&#39;m saying it&#39;s skirting the edge of it to say <br/>
&quot;consequences&quot; when you mean &quot;punishment,&quot; and if the motivation of a child <br/>
to do something is to avoid punishment (instead of for the intrinsic reasons <br/>
of knowing why cleaning the kitchen or making the bed can be useful, and in <br/>
New Mexico it can have to do with keeping sand out of/off of things), then <br/>
maybe the parent should back up, pause, and try again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>See that was me, when I was 12 I said NO More! I worked twice as hard at <br/>
school, graduated at semester my junior year, (I had just turned 16 the month <br/>
before) and I was gone. I went to college for a few years then I met my <br/>
husband and was married at 19 and had Moly at 20. <br/>
Talking with my sister and brother, who are much younger than I am, they say <br/>
me leaving must have been a wake up call to our father, because he never hit <br/>
them ever, like he did me for years. I bore the brunt of the abuse, and there <br/>
was no excuse for the abuse like alcoholism. I am not saying alcoholism is an <br/>
excuse for abuse, I am just saying he wasn&#39;t an alcoholic, so that isn&#39;t <br/>
where the abuse came from. Luckily for my sister, our grandfather got sick <br/>
and died before he got bored with me and turned to her. Lucky for both my <br/>
sister and brother, our father must have realized what his hitting did to me, <br/>
and didn&#39;t ever lay a hand on them. Now my folks are the best grandparents, <br/>
they dote on my two kids and my sisters baby. I wouldn&#39;t have it any other <br/>
way, I just wish they could have acted toward me how they now act toward the <br/>
grandkids. Unfortunately, my husbands mother never changed, and we keep the <br/>
kids away from her as much as possible, and all visits with her are attended <br/>
by Darin and I as well. Darin and I jokingly call visits with his mom, her <br/>
supervised visitation rights. But it isn&#39;t really a joke. We can&#39;t trust her <br/>
not to make some hurtful comment to the kids, or to not spank them if they <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;toe the line&quot; and I think that is just awful sad. <br/>
