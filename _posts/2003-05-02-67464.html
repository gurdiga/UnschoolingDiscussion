If only there were just three steps!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried going into the archives and reading back a bit from the time <br/>
you joined?  It was something written in the  course of a discussion a few <br/>
days ago, not a FAQ or anything.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t find it and nobody steps forward to volunteer to dig it out, <br/>
there are lots of ideas for getting to unschooling here:<br/>

You&#39;re in the hotbed of unschooling in the South! There are several in your <br/>
neck of the woods. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll contact you soon. E-mail me privately and <br/>
maybe we can hook up too! I&#39;m in Columbia, SC.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. Stop reading this list. Honestly, I think it is making you crazy right<br/>
&gt; now. I can sympathize, there are times in my life that I&#39;ve worked myself<br/>
&gt; into a lather about what random other people in cyberspace have to say. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; never healthy. Just do it. Unsubscribe! At least for a few days. Just be<br/>
&gt; with yourself and with your family. Stop worrying about what anyone on the<br/>
&gt; Unschooling list here thinks. Really! Do it now!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. Remove every single worry or doubt about how your children&#39;s lives will<br/>
&gt; turn out without you helping them make it so. Release them all. If it helps,<br/>
&gt; sit down and have a long meditation session and picture yourself dropping<br/>
&gt; them into a well, or a river, or a garbage dump and running them over with a<br/>
&gt; bulldozer. Or write them all on paper and crumple each one and burn it, or<br/>
&gt; throw it into the trash. Examine every single one and drop it. Do so<br/>
&gt; consciously. Now go out and make it so. You are hereby released from taking<br/>
&gt; the responsibility for your children&#39;s future happiness. Live right here,<br/>
&gt; right now, in today. Help them accomplish whatever makes them happy today,<br/>
&gt; whether that does or does not add up to some future goal or plan. Go to a<br/>
&gt; park, have a picnic, sit and snuggle and watch a movie, or let them do<br/>
&gt; whatever it is they want to do. Just release them from the pressure of your<br/>
&gt; wants, wishes, desires, and goals. Let them build their own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. Sit down and make a goal of your own desires, wishes, goals FOR YOURSELF.<br/>
&gt; Find one of them and start working towards it, today! Want to learn to knit<br/>
&gt; an afgan? TODAY, go out and find a beginning knitting class, or just buy a<br/>
&gt; knitting book or just some needles and yarn. Want to run a marathon? TODAY,<br/>
&gt; go out and get some running shoes. Want to read all the classics? Go check<br/>
&gt; Jane Eyre out of the library TODAY. Just do it. Start building your own<br/>
&gt; life. Not your world that has been about your children for twenty-three<br/>
&gt; years. Your OWN wants, needs, desires. Just do it. Now. The only way to stop<br/>
&gt; meddling in your children&#39;s futures is to build your own. Start today.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s it. Really, that&#39;s all there is to it. Come back to this list when<br/>
&gt; you truly feel it will not unbalance your life. I&#39;m not saying this to be<br/>
&gt; cruel. This is a high-volume, high-intensity list. I&#39;ve been subscribed to<br/>
&gt; it on and off for years. There have been times I&#39;ve taken a break of a week,<br/>
&gt; a month, or a year when it has been necessary for the balance in my life.<br/>
&gt; The trick is to know when the list is helping you and when it is consuming<br/>
&gt; you. I suspect deeply that right now this list is not helping you. So ditch<br/>
&gt; it. Follow the three steps above, and you&#39;ll begin to see the paradigm shift<br/>
&gt; that is necessary to unschool. You really have to release all of that and<br/>
&gt; build your own life to see it. You cannot see it when you are trapped in an<br/>
&gt; existence of trying to control your kid&#39;s lives and futures.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best of luck to you, really. It can be a beautiful and joyous journey for<br/>
&gt; you. Let it be so!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Close, Robin :-) (there&#39;s a lot of us Robins and Robyns here)<br/>
<br/>
I posted this, in response to someone asking for specific ways to unschool.<br/>
It was really aimed at one person&#39;s specific needs and questions that they<br/>
had posted, but maybe there&#39;s part of it that others might find helpful.<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here&#39;s unschooling in three easy steps:<br/>
<br/>
1. Stop reading this list. Honestly, I think it is making you crazy right<br/>
now. I can sympathize, there are times in my life that I&#39;ve worked myself<br/>
into a lather about what random other people in cyberspace have to say. It&#39;s<br/>
never healthy. Just do it. Unsubscribe! At least for a few days. Just be<br/>
with yourself and with your family. Stop worrying about what anyone on the<br/>
Unschooling list here thinks. Really! Do it now!<br/>
<br/>
2. Remove every single worry or doubt about how your children&#39;s lives will<br/>
turn out without you helping them make it so. Release them all. If it helps,<br/>
sit down and have a long meditation session and picture yourself dropping<br/>
them into a well, or a river, or a garbage dump and running them over with a<br/>
bulldozer. Or write them all on paper and crumple each one and burn it, or<br/>
throw it into the trash. Examine every single one and drop it. Do so<br/>
consciously. Now go out and make it so. You are hereby released from taking<br/>
the responsibility for your children&#39;s future happiness. Live right here,<br/>
right now, in today. Help them accomplish whatever makes them happy today,<br/>
whether that does or does not add up to some future goal or plan. Go to a<br/>
park, have a picnic, sit and snuggle and watch a movie, or let them do<br/>
whatever it is they want to do. Just release them from the pressure of your<br/>
wants, wishes, desires, and goals. Let them build their own.<br/>
<br/>
3. Sit down and make a goal of your own desires, wishes, goals FOR YOURSELF.<br/>
Find one of them and start working towards it, today! Want to learn to knit<br/>
an afgan? TODAY, go out and find a beginning knitting class, or just buy a<br/>
knitting book or just some needles and yarn. Want to run a marathon? TODAY,<br/>
go out and get some running shoes. Want to read all the classics? Go check<br/>
Jane Eyre out of the library TODAY. Just do it. Start building your own<br/>
life. Not your world that has been about your children for twenty-three<br/>
years. Your OWN wants, needs, desires. Just do it. Now. The only way to stop<br/>
meddling in your children&#39;s futures is to build your own. Start today.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it. Really, that&#39;s all there is to it. Come back to this list when<br/>
you truly feel it will not unbalance your life. I&#39;m not saying this to be<br/>
cruel. This is a high-volume, high-intensity list. I&#39;ve been subscribed to<br/>
it on and off for years. There have been times I&#39;ve taken a break of a week,<br/>
a month, or a year when it has been necessary for the balance in my life.<br/>
The trick is to know when the list is helping you and when it is consuming<br/>
you. I suspect deeply that right now this list is not helping you. So ditch<br/>
it. Follow the three steps above, and you&#39;ll begin to see the paradigm shift<br/>
that is necessary to unschool. You really have to release all of that and<br/>
build your own life to see it. You cannot see it when you are trapped in an<br/>
existence of trying to control your kid&#39;s lives and futures.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you, really. It can be a beautiful and joyous journey for<br/>
you. Let it be so!<br/>
