<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168677674">&quot;The space between. We try to use that concept when decorating or creating <br/>
spaces for things in our home. It&#39;s a very conscious part of art in Japan.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We call them &quot;spaces that breathe&quot; here.....although there aren&#39;t any in our <br/>
tiny house, except in my dh&#39;s space!!<br/>
There are artists that use loads of empty space on a canvas or paper to make <br/>
a point...<br/>
I think it is imperative for adults to allow children to create unhindered <br/>
and non-coerced in order for unique individualism to emerge.<br/>
When a person needs a specific skill in art, then showing them the way to <br/>
acheive that is useful. But making a person use up a whole piece of paper is <br/>
detrimental to the natural flowering of that child&#39;s creative voice.<br/>
