&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Really?!?!?  How horrifying.  Does that mean that we are breeding a<br/>

&gt;They have to do something I guess (from their perspective anyway) as we also<br/>
&gt;have like the second lowest education budget in the country. Of course, home<br/>
&gt;education  is running rampant here!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>HE HE...well, I guess we&#39;re just the pioneering type.  That is, if you want<br/>
to take a positive slant on that information.<br/>
Unfortunately, I have also heard (from someone who used to work in the<br/>
Social Services here in Eastern Idaho) that child abuse is rampant in this<br/>
part of the state.  I have also seen plenty (ok LOTS) of folks smoking with<br/>
their kids in the car, not using sunblock, shouting at or striking their<br/>
children, not using carseats, not that I think those are problems that are<br/>
unique to this area, but I have noticed more of it here.  Apparently there<br/>
is a big problem with people not using Carseats here.  They have radio<br/>
campaigns and seat givaways from the hospital and the fire department.  We<br/>
noticed it when we moved here.  We also noticed that they have a problem<br/>
with getting people to get their kids vaccinated!!  <br/>
<br/>
I was also surprised to find (after growing up in Northern California) that<br/>
there are ALL smoking resturaunts here.  I have yet to find one that is<br/>
Smoke Free.  For us that is a big deal as both my older son and I have<br/>
Asthma.  We sometimes have to get up and leave after being seated in a new<br/>
restaurant (one we have not been in before) if we discover that it is just<br/>
too smokey.  I always ask to be seated as far away from their smoking<br/>
section as possible.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of wonderful things about this area.  Small town atmosphere<br/>
with still a decent sized population.  A very nice zoo and library, lots of<br/>
parks, playgrounds and city flower beds, a good semi-pro baseball team,<br/>
Yellowstone, Glacier National Park, and other areas nearby.  But I have to<br/>
adjust to a mentality that is about 15 years (in the general populace)<br/>
behind the coastal areas and the big cities.  If I was outside the box<br/>
anywhwhere else, here I am a Radical!!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What?! You don&#39;t attend church?  You don&#39;t send your kids to school?  You<br/>
don&#39;t drink or smoke?&quot;  etc etc.....Freakish!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879411968">Wow!! I guess it is different over there in the east of here. I still see<br/>
allot of ignorance but not any more than I saw in Portland for sure.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I was also surprised to find (after growing up in Northern California)<br/>
that<br/>
there are ALL smoking restaurants here.  I have yet to find one that is<br/>
Smoke Free. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the Boise area there are quite a few smoke free restaurants (although the<br/>
best food so far has been in a couple of ones that had smoking areas :(  I<br/>
used to smoke but never in a restaurant)<br/>
<br/>
. &lt;&lt;&lt; We also noticed that they have a problem<br/>
with getting people to get their kids vaccinated!! &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now, that is a whole other subject. I am sure there are allot of people here<br/>
and there and everywhere who don&#39;t vaccinate for the same reason they don&#39;t<br/>
use a car seat or read the labels on the food they feed their children,<br/>
ignorance and careless disregard.  I know quite a few folks, myself<br/>
included, who have done a bit of research on the subject and have chosen not<br/>
to vaccinate because it is more dangerous than the illnesses they are trying<br/>
to prevent. I am sure this is a touchy subject for many people and I don&#39;t<br/>
want to start a flame war or anything.lol. If there is interest I have a few<br/>
articles saved that I could post, but I won&#39;t until I see interest. I just<br/>
wanted to be clear, despite Idaho&#39;s reputation for not vaccinating (looking<br/>
backwoods) there are many legitimate reasons for choosing this path and I<br/>
would personally like to remove it from the &quot;things ignorant folk don&#39;t<br/>
think about&quot; list even if many ignorant folk don&#39;t do it for just that<br/>
reason!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537612823">Ditto.  It fascinates me how I can have things in common with people with whom I<br/>
may have little else in common.  We don&#39;t vaccinate (I am an RN on top of it<br/>
all) for good reasons.  We neither smoke nor drink.  Aren&#39;t  especially<br/>
religious. Have anarcho, libertarian, communitarian socialist,anti-oliarchy,<br/>
individualistic sort of politics which change depending on the issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877488005">There is a lot out there on vaccination which I haven&#39;t bookmarked but I&#39;m sure<br/>
many people will send you.  Now the bad news I have heard on at least two<br/>
separate occasions that some respiratory drs. theorize that the tremendous rise<br/>
in asthma is in fact directly related to mass vaccination.  I am not sure of the<br/>
mechanics of how it works.  I have also heard allergies being related to not<br/>
breast feeding long enough.<br/>
<br/>
There is an alleged connection between how the implementation of modern sewage<br/>
systems and increased hygiene caused the polio epidemic of the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s.<br/>
These children were the first generation wherein getting the disease from their<br/>
environment because they had not been given immunity to it from their mothers<br/>
because their mothers were not exposed to it (having immunity from their mothers)<br/>
because of modern sanitation.<br/>
<br/>
We keep thinking we know what we are doing but we don&#39;t quite get it.  This is<br/>
not to say that I think polio immunization is a bad thing.  The Salk version<br/>
being better than the Sabin.  Other immunizations I&#39;m not so sure about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173787289">The thing to understand is that vaccination (immunization is a misnomer)<br/>
doesn&#39;t make you immune to said illness. What it does is give you a chronic<br/>
case of said illness so that you become unable to contract an acute case.<br/>
Your immune system is constantly under attack and constantly producing<br/>
antibodies to fight diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, tetnus, pertussis<br/>
(my kids have had this, no big deal for healthy children, we had an outbreak<br/>
in northern Idaho a few years ago and 70% of those who contracted it had<br/>
been vaccinated!! what is the point?), hepatitisB, and POLIO!! (I understand<br/>
that the only know cases of Polio in this country these days are a direct<br/>
result of vaccination). So, when you assault the developing immune system of<br/>
a baby with all of this you basically set them up for problems.  The reason<br/>
they have to keep going back for boosters--their immune system wasn&#39;t<br/>
developed enough in the first place to react in the desired way to the<br/>
vaccinations.  So there they are with their immune systems so busy taking<br/>
care of all these chronic illnesses that it can&#39;t handle some of the other<br/>
things the world throws their way, like pet dander or peanuts or less than<br/>
clean air. You know, some of the foods that are the most highly allergenic<br/>
probably weren&#39;t meant for food in the first place i.e.; milk ( we are the<br/>
only animals who aren&#39;t weaned, drinking the secretions from a cows udder<br/>
how gross) , peanuts, and wheat. There are adequate foods in the world that<br/>
more efficiently provide the nutrients we get from those foods.  Anyway, I<br/>
have sent Nanci the most recent information in vaccinations that I have and<br/>
would be happy to post it here if I see any more interest, or feel free to e<br/>
mail me privately.  And, thank you to my friend who is lurking here for the<br/>
vaccination information, you know who you are.  I am sure for the most part<br/>
I am preaching to the choir as those outside the box in one area tend to be<br/>
outside the box in others.<br/>

I would appreciate having more information on this subject - either to the <br/>
whole group if others have expressed interest or just to me privately.  As an <br/>
RN, unfortunately, I know very little about this area.  I seem to have just <br/>
taken the &quot;facts&quot; which were given to me in nursing school, and never did any <br/>
further research on my own.  In fact I have to admit that I was terrified <br/>
when my dd was an infant and we changed pediatricians.  Our new ped. was <br/>
talking about vaccinations and explained that she always gave two doses of <br/>
the &quot;dead&quot; polio vaccine, followed by two doses of the &quot;live&quot; vaccine because <br/>
if you gave all oral polio vaccinations (&quot;live&quot;), the child could actually <br/>
contract polio.  To my horror, I had to tell her that my dd had already <br/>
received all OPVs, because that is what our previous ped. did -- no <br/>
discussion, no options, no information.  So, this is an area that I would <br/>
definitely like to know more about.<br/>
