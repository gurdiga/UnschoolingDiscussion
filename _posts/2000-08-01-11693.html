Oh good -- it&#39;s not just me!<br/>
<br/>
One of my 5 yo daughter&#39;s ways of exploring things is to take them apart -- <br/>
she has performed &quot;dissections&quot; on a play computer and a walkie talkie and a <br/>
couple of fish that died so far. <br/>
<br/>
Today, since we are getting a new kitten later this week, she asked me if she <br/>
could dissect our old cat when it dies!  <br/>
<br/>
I was so grossed out!!  <br/>
<br/>
I just told her that won&#39;t be for a long time and NO!<br/>
<br/>
Probably not a great answer but she really caught me off guard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58500146">Hey!  I just remembered that Smithsonian makes cool kits for dissections!  We <br/>
got one last year that was a frog.  You mix this paste, then pour it into a <br/>
mold that you have already assembled the bones and organs in, then let it <br/>
dry.  Once it drys, it is rubbery, sort of like a real frog, and you can <br/>
dissect it without the yuckiness!  <br/>
