<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323198211">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I skimmed through Sandra&#39;s SCA pages again and followed a few links, <br/>
but wanted to ask if anyone here has a favorite supplier or two.  Our <br/>
daughter, Fawn, is celebrating her twelfth today, and her fondest <br/>
birthday wish was to find material and notions to make the Renaissance <br/>
costume pattern (Simplicity) we bought months ago. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been having a tough time finding materials and notions as newbie <br/>
Renaissance wannabees and seamstresses, especially since my research <br/>
time has been limited due to a computer crash.   I&#39;ve been posting on <br/>
borrowed time (thanks to my kids&#39; generosity :o) for longer than I&#39;d <br/>
like *understatement.*  You never know how much you rely on a machine <br/>
until it&#39;s gone, eh?  Anyway, we could use some help from all you <br/>
creative folks.<br/>
<br/>
The family attended our first Renfest in GA last year and my older <br/>
daughter, Nike, found a beautiful outfit with a vest that is close to <br/>
our family tartan.  The pattern Fawn picked out is similar in style, <br/>
and we have some extra tartan material to use for the vest.  Now the <br/>
devil is in the details, and I&#39;d really like to follow the next <br/>
project through to completion -- Nike&#39;s Civil War dress is still in <br/>
pieces after unsuccessfully trying to adapt a wedding dress to the <br/>
right configurations... novices &#39;r&#39; us.  <br/>
<br/>
The local fabric shops don&#39;t carry the items that the pattern requires <br/>
(and don&#39;t know who does around here,) and we have no idea where to <br/>
begin to find what we need online. Any advice would be greatly <br/>
appreciated.  Thanks!  Penne & the Clan</div>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just use google and name whatever thing it is you&#39;re needing.   (Like <br/>
what?  JoAnne&#39;s has all their sewing/crafts stuff online.  Other  stores might <br/>
too, and they might have an 800 number you can call to talk to  someone who can <br/>
translate what you think you want into what they know they have.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a catalog that sells Victorian stuff and a few other-period things  <br/>
too that might help with the Civil War costume and maybe the other one too,  <br/>
depending what it is you need.  <br/>
 <br/>
Here are some things I found with a google search for catalog victorian  <br/>
notions sundries<br/>
 <br/>
And if they don&#39;t know they will probably know who does.<br/>
 <br/>
_www.odditiesantiques.com/general-lace.htm_ <br/>
(http://www.odditiesantiques.com/general-lace.htm) <br/>
 <br/>
_www.brightnotions.com_ (http://www.brightnotions.com) <br/>
<br/>
Looking for catalog historical costume supply I saw  several things, but this <br/>
looked promising:<br/>
 <br/>
_AlterYears.com For the  Costumer_ (http://www.alteryears.com/)       <br/>
Catalog of historic patterns, books,  supplies and accessories from Medieval <br/>
to Twentieth century for  reenactment and Faire costumes.<br/>
_www.alteryears.com/_ (http://www.alteryears.com/)   <br/>
<br/>
and this:<br/>
_Historical Costuming FAQ_ <br/>
(http://www.faqs.org/faqs/crafts/historical-costuming/)      ... Summary: Lists of sources for  patterns and supplies for <br/>
historical costuming.  ... _The American Historical Supply Catalogue:  A <br/>
Nineteenth-Century ...<br/>

<br/>
Been there, done that -- JoAnne&#39;s (online and off) and Google, too.  <br/>
Thought you or someone here might have a favorite, reliable, <br/>
affordable vendor of your own.  Found a link from Renaissance-<br/>
faire.com to Renaissancetreasures.com to Margospatterns.com and <br/>
applied for her Yahoo! group earlier today.  I&#39;m hoping to get a <br/>
personal recommendation or two from experienced, though not <br/>
necessarily professional, costumers and re-enactors.<br/>
<br/>
Nike&#39;s gown is made from offwhite gauze, but it seemed thinner than <br/>
the fabric we&#39;ve bought from the chain stores in the past.  The <br/>
Simplicity pattern calls for a crinoline petticoat, but that <br/>
material&#39;s apparently nowhere to be found and Margo seems to favor <br/>
cotton, anyway (with boning, I suppose, like our Civil War <br/>
counterparts -- another failed venture on our part :oP)  <br/>
<br/>
RenTreasures has period trims as well, but I don&#39;t know anything <br/>
about pricing or whether they are the best or most authentic or <br/>
simply user-friendly suppliers to be found out there.  It&#39;s been <br/>
very confusing and a wee bit frustrating so far as I haven&#39;t been <br/>
able to get any definitive answers from the folks I&#39;ve queried <br/>
online or off.  Right now I&#39;m leaning toward returning to GA and <br/>
buying another outfit off the rack instead... the girls had their <br/>
eyes on one or two beauties last year.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed your baby costuming article very much -- maybe I&#39;ll google <br/>
for the (dummies) guide to beginner costuming.  I thought perhaps <br/>
someone in your group might have already published it by now :o) If <br/>
I ever figure it out, I&#39;ll write one of my own and if someone hasn&#39;t <br/>
already thought of it by then, I&#39;ll patent my idea to put ready-made <br/>
kits together with all the bare necessities for novice period <br/>
costumers like me.  Thanks for the note, Penne</div>

This is a link to the fabric resources page at the American Sewing Guild&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
If you google Costume Guild and start following the links sections there are<br/>
a lot of resources and groups for people doing both historical and fantasy<br/>
sewing.<br/>
