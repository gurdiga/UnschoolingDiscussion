   <br/>
  Were excited to announce that well be having unschooling talks & discussions, funshops, social gatherings, etc..,  at our Unschooler&#39;s Winter Waterpark Gathering!.  <br/>

  The Kalahari Waterpark Resort, is now allowing us to use some of their conference rooms (for free!) throughout our gathering.  We have 2 moms coordinating events, funshops, unschooling discussion,  social activities, ect   So, our families will have an additional way to now connect with other unschoolers.  Another mom is coordinating field trips for local places  around Sandusky.  Plus, the Kalahari also has their own activities coordinator who will work with us to organize activities, from crafts to movies.  So, theyll be plenty to do, throughout the week for both the kids and parents!<br/>
