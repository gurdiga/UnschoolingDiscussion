<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082707933">I need advice from you homeschooling math whiz parents<br/>
out there.  And by math whiz I dont mean calc and trig<br/>
majors.  Im perplexed.<br/>
<br/>
I am an ADD mom with a 10 y.o. ADHD gifted son. <br/>
Believe it or not I almost flunked pre algebra.  I had<br/>
to take another form of basic math just to satisfy the<br/>
requirements so I could graduate from high school. <br/>
Some slight dyslexia didnt help either.  Luckily my<br/>
son is not dyslexic.<br/>
<br/>
Now to the present...My son also struggles with math. <br/>
All I remember is frustration and really dont want to<br/>
pass any of that on to my son.  Like me, he is having<br/>
difficulty memorizing multiplication.  I never could<br/>
get them memorized.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what Im after is how do I create a &quot;mathy&quot;<br/>
environment, comfortable for him to want to learn<br/>
math, without spending big bucks and fraying my nerves<br/>
in the process?<br/>
<br/>
Hes got an exceptional reading and comprehension<br/>
level.  Even some of the college level textbooks hes<br/>
picked up and read didnt really stump him and what did<br/>
he knows how to look it up so he can understand it. <br/>
Hes phenominal in this area.  Math is a whole<br/>
different ballgame.<br/>
<br/>
Id sure like any suggestions.  Right now were on basic<br/>
math stuff because its really all I can deliver.  I<br/>
have a game called &quot;Smath&quot; that he enjoys playing.  My<br/>
math skills are so bad that he beats me all the time! <br/>
LOL  Any suggestions you have Im sure to learn from<br/>
too.  Thanks<br/>

subject.  I&#39;ll be happy to e-mail it to you (or anyone else) privately (as<br/>
it is not published yet, I probably shouldn&#39;t broadcast it widely.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446336355">RELAX!!!  Math phobia is created and ps teachers are great at creating it!<br/>
You need to use games and step-by-step computer programs.  And, don&#39;t worry<br/>
about multiplication tables.  The rhymming games with counting by 2&#39;s and<br/>
5&#39;s are a good start.  Once your son realises that the counting by 2&#39;s and<br/>
5&#39;s is really multiplication, it removes some of the fear and mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are the &quot;secrets&quot; to nines--either writing the numbers 0 to 9 in<br/>
a column and then on the right of them putting the numbers in reverse order<br/>
on the right side in another column.<br/>
<br/>
9 x 1 =  0 9<br/>
9 x 2 =  1 8<br/>
9 x 3 =  2 7<br/>
<br/>
etc.  Or the subtract method,  9 x 6 = 6 - 1 is 5, 5 plus what equals 9,<br/>
your answer 54.  9 x 8 = 8 - 1 is 7, 7 plus what number equals 9, your<br/>
answer 72.<br/>
<br/>
When he masters that, which the other kids usually don&#39;t know, so he can<br/>
show off his math knowledge &lt;g&gt;, then another math phobia stumbling stones<br/>
is removed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to look up my math sites.  There are tons of fun ones out there<br/>
also.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666571822">Have you worked with Cuisinaire rods? John Holt has some suggestions on them<br/>
in one of his books - either &quot;How Children Learn&quot; or &quot;Learning All the<br/>
Time&quot;, I can&#39;t remember which. He also discusses math learning in general in<br/>
these books and had some great suggestions if I remember right (it&#39;s been a<br/>
year or two since I read them).<br/>
