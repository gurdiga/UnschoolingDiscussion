<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948375380">I love John Holts books because his attitude to children learning<br/>
carries through into all areas. I also like Non-Violent Communication -<br/>
still learning to apply it to communicating with my husband  but it<br/>
seems to work with my little darling who is 3 ½. I always explain why I<br/>
need her to do something, and if it sounds dumb, then it probably is<br/>
dumb, and arbitrary.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The book I found the most useful was &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to<br/>
Discipline&quot;, which is a terrible title for quite a good book. The jacket is<br/>
terrible too, I can only guess that both were created by someone in a<br/>
marketing department. The book itself is about how to get past the need to<br/>
control, why control doesn&#39;t work, how kids learn from our examples and the<br/>
only control we can truly exert is self-control, etc. I felt that it helped<br/>
me along my parenting journey more than any other book. The other books like<br/>
&quot;How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk&quot; have some<br/>
good &quot;tips and tricks&quot; (like lists of &quot;alternatives to &#39;No&#39;&quot;), but this book<br/>
is more like the underlying foundation for respectful parenting, and how to<br/>
achieve it.<br/>
<br/>
I also like this particular little list, I can&#39;t remember where I saved it<br/>
from:<br/>
<br/>
Here is a &quot;declaration of complete confidence in children&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
  1.. Adult-like behavior matures by the time we are adults.<br/>
<br/>
  2.. No expectations means no disappointments for us, and no damaging<br/>
pressures for our children.<br/>
<br/>
  3.. Children respond best to modeling and leadership, not control.<br/>
<br/>
  4.. Trust... and wait.<br/>
<br/>
  5.. Choose between your momentary convenience and your long-term goal for<br/>
your child&#39;s sense of self.<br/>
<br/>
  6.. Enjoy your child for who he is, not for who you would like him to be -<br/>
he will never be this age again.<br/>
<br/>
  7.. Distinguish between your emotional needs and what your child feels and<br/>
needs. Act toward your child in harmony with her needs; take care of your<br/>
emotional needs elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
  8.. Celebrate your child&#39;s uniqueness as well as your own.<br/>
<br/>

oooh ooh oooooh!!! (The monkey hoot from the back row of someone with <br/>
something to SAY!)<br/>
<br/>
This weekend when I was out and about, one discussion was just me and the <br/>
dad, after we had dropped Kirby off with the prom gang (where the boys had <br/>
just shown up too, and so all were in one place, in a mountain parking lot <br/>
between towns, in their formals, heels, etc. &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
It was about Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>
It was about, on my end, how Mother&#39;s Day is at my house, and on his end, how <br/>
it is all screwed up at his house.  <br/>
<br/>
In the hope of making sure it was a big deal, he reminded his stepsons two <br/>
months ago.  He reminded them a month ago; nothing.  He remined them two <br/>
weeks and a week ago; nothing.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of negativity to lay as a foundation for a day on which all the <br/>
mom asked for was some time all alone, which she got!  But meanwhile backstag<br/>
e the boys are set up to fail, and the step dad sees them as ungrateful <br/>
slouches who don&#39;t appeciate their mother nor his thoughtful reminders.<br/>
<br/>
Here was my mother&#39;s day.<br/>
Keith asked me Friday if there was anything I wanted to do.  I said no, maybe <br/>
Two Towers at the dollar flick.  (But Kirby and I got back too late for that <br/>
anyway.)  We discussed that I&#39;d be with Kirby most of the day, and he&#39;s the <br/>
kid who caused my motherhood to happen, so that seemed kind of appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Since I was with the other family, I was privileged to partake of a big <br/>
breakfast of sausage-grave, biscuits and eggs all made by male people (Kirby <br/>
was sleeping off the prom still).  I got &quot;Happy Mother&#39;s Day&quot; greetings from <br/>
some teens and the adults we were with. <br/>
<br/>
When we left there Kirby had already gone out for lunch with a couple of the <br/>
girls from the night before, and I asked him to stop at Sonic so I could get <br/>
something before the two hour drive.  I ordered my stuff and held out money <br/>
to him (he was driving) and he said &quot;No!  It&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day!&quot; and he paid for <br/>
my lunch at Sonic.  That was not too bad.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly met me in the yard with a big hug.<br/>
<br/>
Marty had bought me two bags of dark chocolate Dove miniatures.<br/>
<br/>
That was it, but it was every bit sweet and sincere and nobody had reminded <br/>
them and I wasn&#39;t going to pout if they hadn&#39;t done anything at all!!  I was <br/>
happy to be with them and it was a good day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848637304">Parenting Books! I have read a few. My poor children started out with a<br/>
traditional authoritarian mum, then we moved onto Toddler Taming, then<br/>
Positive Parenting, then Logical Consequences. The trouble was, the kids got<br/>
used to the fact that mum was trying new tricks to get them to do what they<br/>
didn&#39;t want to do. This made them suspicious and uncooperative.<br/>
<br/>
Then I discovered (after many destructive years) one really great book (and<br/>
course that goes with it) is Dr Thomas Gordan&#39;s Parent Effectiveness<br/>
Training. This has made a whole new way of life for our family. I highly<br/>
recommend it. It&#39;s basis is active listening to our children, firmly stating<br/>
our needs and problem solving to find win-win solutions. I am not that good<br/>
at yet, but feel less pressure to be the &quot;perfect parent&quot;.<br/>
