<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181476833">Math:  A typical second, after 12 years of unschooling<br/>
<br/>
Holly came in and said &quot;To find 75 % of 11, can I somehow multiply 75 times <br/>
11?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had to think a minute.  I knew she could, and I knew it had to do with <br/>
decimals, and my school fear came in and then I stopped myself and thought <br/>
&quot;what does it look like with $10?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then it was really easy, and I showed her yes, it was really multiplying <br/>
it by .75, and she said &quot;I thought so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She understood it better than I did, because I had lots of people complicate <br/>
it for me and scare me with it and give me opportunities for failure and <br/>
embarrassment.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly figured it out by herself, gradually, over her life.  And her <br/>
explanation was better than my teachers&#39; explanation.  &quot;You multiply it by <br/>
75, somehow.&quot;<br/>
