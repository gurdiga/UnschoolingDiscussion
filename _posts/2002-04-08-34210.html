<div id="ygrps-yiv-70614978">&lt;&lt;With regard to the comment that &quot;one cannot claim to be a vegetarian if one <br/>
has not eaten meat with breakfast,&quot; -- I don&#39;t claim to be an &quot;unschooler.&quot;  <br/>
I claim to be, and am, a homeschooler who uses a blend of unschooling and <br/>
something else. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
You might just say your kids have &quot;free choice time,&quot; which is what it sounds <br/>
like you really mean when you say you &quot;use unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you went to a vegetarian message board and said, &quot;I use a blend of both <br/>
vegetarianism and carnivorism,&quot; the vegetarians there would say that that <br/>
makes you a carnivore, not a vegetarian.  <br/>
<br/>
I know someone who uses a curriculum-in-a-box. The kids are required to do <br/>
it. The family is a joy-filled and pretty respectful-of-each-other family and <br/>
the kids and mom have a good time with their curriculum and are proud of the <br/>
work they do. They don&#39;t feel bound by the most stringent of the requirements <br/>
of their program. The curriculum says do 2 pages each day and they are <br/>
flexible and might do 3 pages one day and only 1 page another day. They SKIP <br/>
days altogether, to go on field trips, for example. On nice days they might <br/>
take their work outside. <br/>
<br/>
They call themselves unschoolers and feel like they are being really <br/>
flexible. But the use of that curriculum is teaching all kinds of unintended <br/>
lessons that unschoolers want to avoid. It contradicts the basis of <br/>
unschooling, to &quot;impose&quot; any school-like lessons at all. <br/>
<br/>
It might be interesting to talk a bit more concretely about  why having some <br/>
free choice time mixed with imposed lessons isn&#39;t unschooling -- just as <br/>
having some meatless meals isn&#39;t vegetarianism.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers often point out that it isn&#39;t unschooling if you do any schooling <br/>
at all. The reason is that unschoolers believe there are negative <br/>
consequences of that time spent &quot;schooling.&quot; As one example, children become <br/>
used to the idea that someone else should tell them what to learn and how to <br/>
learn it and they begin to see themselves as vessels that need to be filled <br/>
rather than feeling responsible for their own learning. This is not how <br/>
unschoolers see children, so imposing any lessons on children contradicts a <br/>
basic unschooling principle.<br/>
Kids given school-like lessons also start to think there is a time for <br/>
learning and a time for playing and that those are different things. That <br/>
again contradicts a basic unschooling principle. There are more, but those <br/>
couple of examples get the point across, I hope.<br/>
