<div id="ygrps-yiv-122696071">This is just a note about information thats been in the news related to <br/>
tattoos and piercings. There are many health risks which may or may not <br/>
show up right away as a result of putting metals and dyes into your <br/>
body. Materials and dyes used in tattooing and body piercing are <br/>
unregulated. Most dyes used in tattooing are not approved for cosmetic <br/>
purposes and were produced for industrial uses such as car paint.<br/>
Some alternative doctors have ways to test for heavy metal toxicity now <br/>
and I know a few people who have this toxicity.<br/>
One way this happens is from dental fillings (metal one&#39;s). So with <br/>
tongue piercing, when you have two dissimilar metals in your mouth you <br/>
form a battery, and through electrogalvanism you will actually have <br/>
current floating in your mouth.<br/>

This article has some more info if you&#39;re interested.<br/>

In the interest of averting the danger,<br/>
