Yes, by my own conviction and research.  I am having a hard time weeding out <br/>
all sugar...but I feel better when I do.  As you know there is sugar in <br/>
everything!  It is crazy.  I think I am going to order some to try.  I would <br/>
love some recipes.  Are you feeling any effects from it?  I noticed with the <br/>
rice syrup, I still get the jitters, and headaches...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Julie,  the rice syrup was awful for me... I had a bad reaction.  The sweet <br/>
balance is &quot;low glycemic&quot;, and is guaranteed not to affect blood sugar levels <br/>
adversely.  I, personally, love it.  I think you and I talked about Stevia on <br/>
the AP list earlier this spring.  To me, sweet balance tastes so much better. <br/>
 I kept tasting an after taste with stevia, and had trouble getting the right <br/>
taste of sweetness when cooking with it.  I know there are cook books out <br/>
there for stevia, but I did not get any.  At any rate, I read that it is high <br/>
glycemic, and would likely cause similar reactions to the blood sugar levels. <br/>
 I think that info is on the sweet balance web site, if I&#39;m remembering it <br/>
right.  I&#39;ll post some recipes soon for you.  ~Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-485768924">I look at all the websites and could not find a definitive answer as to<br/>
what Sweet Balance is made from.  Can someone aim me in the right<br/>
