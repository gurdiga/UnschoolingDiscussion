<div id="ygrps-yiv-408358505">Hi, I recently pulled my kids out of school after a very frustrating<br/>
and after too many humiliating experiences for them.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest (9) just was completely frustrated. She has epilepsy and she<br/>
went from gifted to &quot;maybe she isnt doing well because 5th grade is<br/>
just harder&quot; No she isnt doing well because she feels abused by her<br/>
teacher, misunderstood and not respected. She has difficulty with<br/>
memory and speed in timed work and just couldnt perform well within<br/>
guidelines that were useless. I got tired of seeing my daughter in<br/>
tears as her happiness and self esteem plummeted.<br/>
<br/>
I have one child who I kept in school, he is 5 and luckily in special<br/>
ed. (ADHD, mild PDD-Nos from meningitis in infancy or maybe he just is<br/>
because thats the way the Lord made him. Who knows. :) ) They plan to<br/>
mainstream him next year with special therapies during his recess, gym<br/>
time etc. Which I take to mean that they wont be giving him what he<br/>
needs and he will eventually fall into the cracks. I plan to bring him<br/>
home then. Right now he needs the therapies they can provide daily.<br/>
Speech, occupational therapy etc.<br/>
<br/>
My other son who came home is 7. He still hasnt learned to read, and<br/>
he doesnt seem to care to yet. I insisted in kindergarten when they<br/>
wanted to hold him back that they absolutely would not do such a<br/>
thing! That there were too many studies that suggested it would only<br/>
hurt him. He was aware of the idea and it only upset him, Way more<br/>
than I thought he needed to care about at his age! That and being that<br/>
is younger brother and him would end up in the same grade! So they<br/>
promoted him to first and it was a disaster. He wasnt paying<br/>
attention, all he wanted to do was draw, he plays well but he still<br/>
cant tell the difference between visual letters. He hasnt learned any<br/>
more of the 13 alphabet sounds than he knew last year and he cried all<br/>
the time saying he loved his friends at school but he didnt want to<br/>
go. So we had him tested for special ed. Sure enough he is too smart<br/>
after all, so even though he isnt learning anything and at this rate<br/>
he would be behind next year by 3 years... He doesnt qualify yet. Then<br/>
it finally occurred to me how ridiculous this was! I should watch my<br/>
son fail through school, let them hold him back until they finally<br/>
promote him for age and then after we have wasted years he will<br/>
qualify. No thanks. My son is the brightest child I have. His<br/>
imiagination is endless and his mind always wondering, always asking.<br/>
He is such an awesome little artist and his personality so sweet but I<br/>
was seeing it slowly but surely crushed and discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
Then the other 2 not yet old enough for school but will never go. I<br/>
just cant wait to see all of their potential completely uninhibited by<br/>
the school system!  I brought them home after long consideration.<br/>
Maybe a full year. I had yearned for a closer relationship with them,<br/>
one that took losing one child to fully appreciate. To really see and<br/>
know how little time we have and how much I just love being with them.<br/>
What we now know to be real happiness. But I didnt want to make any<br/>
rash decisions because of our grieving.  <br/>
<br/>
So two years later here we are, I took them out of school a few months<br/>
ago and I did so much searching for the &quot;perfect&quot; curriculum. I<br/>
thought I had found it with Weaver and so our journey began. This<br/>
didnt last long. It didnt feel right. The kids were learning more &<br/>
more, and I was so proud of my decision and how well I was I was<br/>
getting through to them! Each day though I dreaded the lessons and so<br/>
did they. I couldnt find a way to fit everything into a reasonable<br/>
(home)school day and managed to take away the whole day. They werent<br/>
living any more than they were at school, and they were listening less<br/>
to me each day. I saw it.<br/>
<br/>
I broke down and one day while my husband was sleeping (he works third<br/>
in order to see us more) I broke down and felt like such a failure I<br/>
called the school and asked what I had to do to re-enroll them. To my<br/>
utter shock my husband who I had thought was sleeping sat up and told<br/>
me no way, dont do it! (This is the man who took forever to convince<br/>
and doubted everything) He said, &quot; The kids are learning so much!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thats when I told him, I couldnt do it this way anymore. More & more<br/>
the days were becoming dreaded. We had to try something new. So I read<br/>
more about the Montessori method, unschooling, waldorf etc and thought<br/>
unschooling seems so natural. Its what many days have become anyway<br/>
when I couldnt bear to bore the kids today. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling makes so much sense to my husband. He is laid back and go<br/>
with the flow and very open minded. Im the control freak, the worrier.<br/>
I want so badly to unschool, it feels right! In the back of mind<br/>
though, I just keep hoping Im not setting them up to be gas station<br/>
attendants. I dont seem to &quot;get&quot; how these kids are going to be ok if<br/>
they never learn algebra or if they never WANT to learn algebra. Ive<br/>
read a lot, I know theres simple answers from Sandra Dodd about these<br/>
ridiculous questions but I cant let it go.<br/>
<br/>
So today I just kept reminding myself that I didnt have to teach any<br/>
of these kids to walk & talk, they WANTED to. They want to learn and<br/>
it doesnt have to be by societys standards, or uncomfortable shoved<br/>
down their throats learning. We got up, they played a few board games,<br/>
we went to the library and picked up tons of books on tape that my son<br/>
loves to do and my daughter got one (on her own!) about Frank Lloyd<br/>
Wright and she asked for some picture books to read to her littlest<br/>
brother. (Ofcourse somewhere in there I threw in how Matthew should<br/>
feel free to let me know when it is that he &quot;wants&quot; me to help him<br/>
learn to read. They then went to gymnastics, bought a cake for their<br/>
brothers birthday. Threw him a surprise party and helped clean up the<br/>
house. They folded and put away their own laundry which I wash. They<br/>
helped cook dinner. Followed by movies, (none educational) but kid<br/>
movies. Another attempt at a board game which was abruptly ended by<br/>
fighting amongst them. Some internet sites, like M& M&#39;s, American Girl<br/>
etc. A few books on tape, eventually went to bed with some urging<br/>
about 1 am. I loved today! It was natural and wondefully peaceful. It<br/>
totally flowed the way living feels it should be. <br/>
<br/>
So here I am now, searching for more reassurances that our day was<br/>
normal for an unschooler, what I shouldve done better, what I didnt do<br/>
and what else I NEED to know! Wondering how I can justify &quot;literally&quot;<br/>
teaching them nothing. Please help me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-256984439">How did you learn about unschooling?  Did someone teach you all about it or<br/>
did you have an interest and follow it, learning as you went?  Your kids<br/>
will learn in the same way, without you teaching them. However, I think<br/>
unschooling parents have an important role to play in their children&#39;s<br/>
lives.  They need to be connected with them and tuned in, so they can see<br/>
their kids&#39; interests and help them navigate the world to feed those<br/>
interests.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Good for you for taking your kids out of school.  Each day will look<br/>
different and each unschooling family will have different interests.  It&#39;s<br/>
about helping your kids to follow *their* interests and not comparing them<br/>
to other children of the same age.  Give yourself the gift of time.  Start<br/>
by thinking to yourself that you are taking a couple months off and make<br/>
sure you don&#39;t push anything on them during that time.  When that time<br/>
period ends, you should feel more secure in unschooling if you&#39;ve noted in<br/>
your head all the things that they learned without your teaching.  Just<br/>
don&#39;t expect unschooling learning to look like school work.  They probably<br/>
won&#39;t sit down and do math worksheets, but they might play games involving<br/>
math or figure out how much money they need to buy something.  Real life<br/>
math.<br/>

<br/>
That day was normal for your unschooling family.  I think everyone&#39;s family <br/>
will be different.  There is no form fit.  That&#39;s what makes it wonderful.  <br/>
Every day has new experiences.  <br/>
<br/>
You may be &quot;literally&quot; NOT using a curriculum and NOT teaching or talking AT <br/>
them.  But they will learn many, many things.  Naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Our 7 year old has been in Kindergarten.  He knew tons of things <br/>
before and knew less when he came home.  The way he learned before was natural, <br/>
by exposure and everyday life.  While there he learned to learn their way, <br/>
their speed.  Learning to learn is absurd!  Our 3 year old, never in any school, <br/>
seems like he knows nothing because if you ask him a color, or number, etc., <br/>
he plays with you an acts like he doesn&#39;t know.  But if he plays a game or does <br/>
a puzzle or whatever, you hear him saying the colors and counting.  It&#39;s <br/>
hilarious, it&#39;s his way.  He hides what he knows, while my other one is very <br/>
likely to tell you everything he knows, ALL DAY LONG :o)<br/>
<br/>
I would say that some deschooling would be good.  Let go of all schoolie <br/>
things as much as possible and let them rediscover that childhood freedom.  Help <br/>
them follow their interests and/or find the resources they need to learn more <br/>
about whatever it may be.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715138617">**No she isnt doing well because she feels abused by her teacher, <br/>
misunderstood and not respected.**<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Samantha --<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really hard!  I&#39;m glad you were able to understand her struggle <br/>
and look for an alternative for her.<br/>
<br/>
While you may find some of the advice on this list surprising, the good <br/>
news is you won&#39;t find anyone who will say and think that your daughter <br/>
should just &quot;suck it up&quot; and be miserable because &quot;that&#39;s what life is <br/>
like&quot; and learning to write book reports or multiply fractions is <br/>
vital.  We won&#39;t say that learnining gain must come from pain.  So we <br/>
can really support you in removing your daughter from an awful situation.<br/>
<br/>
**Which I take to mean that they wont be giving him what he needs and he <br/>
will eventually fall into the cracks. I plan to bring him home then.**<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who had a young son who was getting some preschool <br/>
therapies.  When she told me how helpful his teachers were, I always <br/>
said &quot;Great!&quot; and was supportive.  But I tried to subtly prepare her to <br/>
watch out for that point when the teachers (may) stop working for the <br/>
child and start working against the child.  Sounds like your thoughts <br/>
and mine are in alignment on that issue.  The therapists need to be <br/>
attempting to serve the child&#39;s interests, not making the child serve <br/>
the system.<br/>
<br/>
**Sure enough he is too smart after all, so even though he isnt learning <br/>
anything and at this rate he would be behind next year by 3 years...**<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, outside of school, a kid can learn tons of stuff without <br/>
being able to read a textbook or worksheet.  My son learns a lot of <br/>
information about science and history watching documentaries.  (He&#39;s <br/>
10.  He picked up reading at about age 7, but wasn&#39;t in school competing <br/>
with other kids and had no sense of being &quot;late&quot;. )<br/>
<br/>
**To really see and know how little time we have and how much I just <br/>
love being with them. What we now know to be real happiness.**<br/>
<br/>
This is the crucial part.  It was really great to read your post and <br/>
feel your passion.<br/>
<br/>
**In the back of mind though, I just keep hoping Im not setting them up <br/>
to be gas station attendants. I dont seem to &quot;get&quot; how these kids are <br/>
going to be ok if they never learn algebra or if they never WANT to <br/>
learn algebra.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t teach my son math (and we don&#39;t bump into it accidentally very <br/>
often), but on the treadmill this week he told me that walking at a <br/>
speed 3mph it would take him 5 minutes to walk one quarter of a mile.  <br/>
(I thought this was pretty sophisticated.  He&#39;s 10.)<br/>
<br/>
OK, my worst case scenario response is that if I imagine my son as a 25 <br/>
year old gas station attendant, I know I am willing to still have him at <br/>
home and still feed him if he finally gets the desire to go to community <br/>
college and &quot;prepare&quot; for a more rewarding job.  I have friends whose 21 <br/>
year old (schooled through 12th grade) son is following his passion and <br/>
trying to make a living as a ballet dancer.  They know that this is a <br/>
long shot because it is a low-paying field and few rise to the top.  In <br/>
their family there is no shame if he does this for some years and then <br/>
comes back home, for financial support, while he transitions into <br/>
something else.  (In families where parents are determined to kick kids <br/>
out at age 18 there is more deadline pressure, but I don&#39;t have to <br/>
create that in my family, I can be more flexible.)<br/>
