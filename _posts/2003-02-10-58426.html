<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378940859">Hi all,<br/>
First a disclaimer: This is not totally unschooling :)<br/>
But, since I am still creatively challenged, I have had fun with some<br/>
of the &#39;experiments of the week&#39; from Robert Krampf&#39;s site on Yahoo. (<br/>
Sorry if this is old info.)<br/>
I have been playing around with some of the stuff he talks about and<br/>
have had the kids say &quot;mom what are you doing&quot; (he had a soap/oil one<br/>
last year Sandra) I then give a very brief explaination and we are<br/>
off.  It is great because often it ends up heading anywhere but where<br/>
it was &quot;supposed to&quot; and it often makes for great messy fun and<br/>
laughter. Check it out and &quot;toss&quot; what doesn&#39;t interest you or your kids. <br/>

I don&#39;t see that that&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We have kitchen science books and ooey-gooey fake blood recipes and stuff the <br/>
kids play with sometimes.  And in a moment of boredom, vinegar and baking <br/>
soda can go a long way for a short while. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I played with oil, water, food coloring and soap a few weeks ago.  <br/>
It was fun!<br/>

<br/>
I have an &quot;experiment &quot; file in my computer and I send all of his e-mails <br/>
straight there for a &quot;rainy day&quot;. He has lots of neat ideas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741246591">Saw a cool little science demo yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
About 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water poured onto a dinner plate -- a big slice <br/>
of lemon sitting (peel down) in the water and 3 matches stuck into the <br/>
lemon. (Could be anything that will hold the matches.) Light the <br/>
matches and put a glass over the lemon/matches.<br/>
<br/>
What happens?<br/>
<br/>
The water all swooshes up into the glass.  If you have a good seal, you <br/>
can even lift the glass and the plate will lift with the water still in <br/>
the glass.<br/>
<br/>
Very cool. Maybe not as dramatic as the similar hardboiled egg trick, <br/>
but this one can be done even when you don&#39;t happen to have a <br/>
hardboiled egg handy.<br/>
