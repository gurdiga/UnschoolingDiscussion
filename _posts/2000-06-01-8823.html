<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489267412">&lt;&lt; There is a baking powder that doesn&#39;t have aluminum.  It is in a red can and I&#39;m blessed if I can remember the name of it...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I ran downstairs to look at the can, then realized I&#39;ve been buying it in bulk for awhile so there&#39;s no can to look at! Halfway upstairs the name came to me: Rumford.<br/>
