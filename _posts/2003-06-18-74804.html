<div id="ygrps-yiv-117323781">Someone said considerations of rank don&#39;t come up much in everyday life.  I <br/>
saw another natural example today.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby needed to be at work at 10:00.  They were receiving an order and going <br/>
to rearrange stock in the storage shed. Another car pulled up at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
The other car had Ryan (22 ish, the personnel manager) and Joey (not an <br/>
employee, but helps out sometimes).    <br/>
<br/>
The door was locked.  Kirby has a key.  But he stood back and let Ryan unlock <br/>
the door.<br/>
<br/>
Had the owner or the business manager shown up at the door at the same time, <br/>
Ryan would have stood back and let them open the door.<br/>
<br/>
Joey, meanwhile, who has no key and no access to the alarm code, and so he <br/>
politely looked away.<br/>
<br/>
Are they just wise in social interaction?  Are they naturals at interpersonal <br/>
relationships?  I doubt anyone taught them how to act.  And I can think of <br/>
other young male people I know who wouldn&#39;t have been as smooth, who might have <br/>
been nattering on about how the alarm system worked, peeking over to see it, <br/>
or being obnoxious.  But these guys were as smooth as any dancers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848952842">I made the comment that we do not deal with a lot  rank in our day in and day <br/>
out lives.  I really should have said &quot;in formal settings&quot;   You stated too <br/>
that formal situations that involve rank are less common.  I do agree that rank <br/>
plays a part in our every day lives.  It is very subtle and most folks do not <br/>
even realize that is it playing out.   Sandra&#39;s example is perfect of  how <br/>
rank insticntively works in well adapted individuals.   <br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t think most folks correlate these types of common, every day <br/>
occurences with  the term &quot;rank&quot;, but, when it comes right down to the basics of it, <br/>
what other term can be used?   Respect? Courtesy? Common sense?  OK.. but WHY <br/>
practice any of those in this situation?  Because the older, supervising <br/>
employee had rank among the young men.   <br/>
