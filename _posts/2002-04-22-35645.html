<div id="ygrps-yiv-406389770">We have had the same challenge here.  We live in one of those Illinois neighborhoods with no fences - so there are like twenty backyards connecting - 90% of those with kids who are our children&#39;s ages (11, 9, 3).<br/>
<br/>
It is wonderful that they have this park environment so close to home, and within view of many caring parents, but it is also extremely challenging with regards to homeschooling & unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Gino commented once that he wished he was learning more at home like he did in school.  This made no sense to me - he hated school - tantrummed all the time about it - before school / after school / during school.  A friend suggested the &quot;prisoner missing prison&quot; idea.  It made a lot of sense as he was in a &quot;special&quot; school that rewarded or consequenced behaviors every 5 minutes with a behavioral assessment chart (&quot;e&quot; for excellent, &quot;s&quot;,&quot;n&quot;, etc.).  We pulled him out in May of 2001, so we&#39;re coming up on one year - and this may still be a deschooling issue - especially since his &quot;school&quot; experiences were so extreme (behavioral hospital and school).<br/>
<br/>
Recently, the kids asked if they could go back to school.  After recovering from my shock (and feeling rejected and hurt - yes, unfortunately I took it personal!!), I decided to probe a little deeper.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that Gino (9) didn&#39;t like waiting all day for his friends to come home at 4:00.  Solution : We talked about what actually occurs during the course of a typical &quot;school&quot; day.  He wasn&#39;t convinced and felt that he could, and wanted to try it.  I suggested trying a &quot;school type&quot; day at home to see how it would feel, and he agreed.  Literally ten minutes into the &quot;school&quot; day, he was complaining about the simple Math worksheet I gave him for &quot;Math&quot; time.  I explained that in school, you do not have a choice (as he well knows from his past school experiences).  That led to pounding on the floor, throwing the workbook, and shouting, &quot;I don&#39;t want to do this - I want to do what I want to do!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking, &quot;YES Exactly!!&quot;, but I showed some restraint, said nothing, and he went off to play with his hot wheels.  Later he came back and we were able to talk.  We have scheduled more &quot;get togethers&quot; with other homeschoolers during the day, to try and satisfy his need to hang out with friends before 4:00 !<br/>
<br/>
I do feel that he came away from the experience with a negative though - that he can&#39;t &quot;make it&quot; in school.  A sort of &quot;everybody else can do it but I can&#39;t&quot; mentality about the whole thing.  Perhaps there is a better way to handle these situations when they arise??<br/>
<br/>
For my daughter Sabra (10, almost 11), it turns out that she thought she was homeschooling because she wasn&#39;t smart enough to succeed in school.  Of course she was pleased as punch when dh and I fell out of our chairs exclaiming, &quot;Sabra, you&#39;re not in school because you&#39;re TOO smart and precious to be there!!!&quot;   And believe me, she has been told this many times.  I think it may be a general worry that comes up from time to time that has more to do with not being like &quot;everyone else&quot;.  Maybe they experience some of the same insecurities / doubts that I do from time to time - in which case I need to get my thing together and be clear on my own views.<br/>
<br/>
One thing (of many) my children taught me is that I need to be talking, talking, and talking some more about these ideas, and all sorts of others!  We talk all the time - but I was still surprised to find out what kind of ideas were lurking in their heads.<br/>

  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] New question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi all, I am new here, have been lurking for a few days and reading the <br/>
  recent discussions.   <br/>
      My question is How do you deal with others as you move towards an <br/>
  unschooling lifestyle? How about when it&#39;s the kids themselves that keep <br/>
  telling you they are not learning anything when you know they are? My kids <br/>
  had previously been in school and play with kids who go to school so I know <br/>
  where some of the flack comes from but it is still so hard to deal with. It <br/>
  makes me feel phony when I try to explain to them how them doing this or that <br/>
  is math or history, etc. <br/>
      Please also help me to find ways to move dh along. BTW, my kids are 11 <br/>
  and 14, both boys.<br/>

<br/>
At a recent hs support group meeting, the topic was &quot;socializing w/ non-homeschoolers&quot;.  One member actually schedules any activities which her kids want to participate in during the &quot;after-school&quot; hours, to avoid extended playtimes w/ the neighborhood kids!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds seriously tempting!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, may I ask - what did you tell Marty?  and Did it work?<br/>

want to jump up and down and screaming of YAHOO!!!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah right.  You&#39;re always complaining you&#39;re bored, you hate the teachers,<br/>
you have too much homework!  You sit in a stuffy old school all day with<br/>
someone telling you what to fill your brain with.  I go where ever I want,<br/>
I&#39;m not bored, I&#39;m having fun, I don&#39;t have any homework and I fill my brain<br/>
with what I want in my brain!  So who&#39;s the dumb one here?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718705973">Wellll, unpopular opinion here.  Guess it is because we actually believe in<br/>
trusting our kids.  Youngest kidlet wanted to go to school because all her<br/>
little friends were going and she saw all the &quot;fun&quot; kids had in school on<br/>
television.  Plus, they have a school fair thingy at the mall and make out<br/>
like k is all about fun and playing.<br/>
<br/>
We had a long talk about how restrictive it was and how we didn&#39;t really<br/>
think it would be a good idea but she asked if she couldn&#39;t try it.  So we<br/>
said fine.  then we had another long talk about how she didn&#39;t have to stay<br/>
if she didn&#39;t want to and that we&#39;d rather have her home living life and<br/>
enjoying herself than going to ps.<br/>
<br/>
She went for a few weeks.  We were in hysterics about it but made sure she<br/>
didn&#39;t see us laughing.  If we asked if she still wanted to go and give her<br/>
the it isn&#39;t quitting speech, she say, &quot;No, I have to give it a chance.&quot;<br/>
Then she came home one day mad as a wet hen!!!   When we got home she<br/>
stompted off, threw her &quot;school&quot; clothes in the garbage (she changed her<br/>
mind later saying it wasn&#39;t their fault &lt;g&gt;) and said, &quot;I&#39;m not going back.<br/>
I tried but they lied.&quot;   Later we asked what she meant about them lying.<br/>
She said they tell you going to school is fun and it isn&#39;t, &quot;They make you<br/>
sit on the floor and not move!&quot;  &quot;They make you wear a coat even if you<br/>
aren&#39;t cold!&quot;  &quot;Everybody has to do the same thing and they thinks we&#39;re<br/>
babies.&quot;  The ultimate sin was to treat her like a baby, guess that comes<br/>
from being the baby.<br/>
<br/>
Now when someone brings up school, you&#39;ll get a lecture about not putting<br/>
children in &quot;kiddy prison.&quot;  She also makes an &quot;x&quot; with her fingers when we<br/>
drive by the school to ward off the &quot;evil.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Knowing this child, if we had said &quot;no,&quot; or tried to distract her, she&#39;d<br/>
have boiled away under the surface and it would have only gotten worse.<br/>
Instead, we trusted her to know what she wanted and trusted her to say<br/>
&quot;when.&quot;<br/>

Holly used to want to go to school, before she was old enough.  I was willing <br/>
to let her, but we talked about it pretty regularly.<br/>
<br/>
What she wanted was to go because her friend across the street went.  But <br/>
they would not have been in the same grade.  So whenever we&#39;d pass an <br/>
elementary during school hours, I would show her that only SOME of the kids <br/>
were out to play at any one time, and they weren&#39;t supposed to play with kids <br/>
in other grades, or sometimes even in other classes.  And that the <br/>
kindergarten kids never were mixed in with first graders.<br/>
<br/>
I also told her that in school the other kids will tease each other a lot for <br/>
playing with kids in earlier grades, and that I was afraid Kellee wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
as nice to Holly in school, even if she had a chance, as she was when they <br/>
played at each other&#39;s houses.<br/>
<br/>
As evidence of that, I told her to notice how often kids in school ask new <br/>
kids they meet &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;  She started noting that, and we <br/>
would discuss it.  Because my boys would say &quot;I&#39;m not in a grade,&quot; or &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t go to school,&quot; the other kids had to decide based solely on interest, <br/>
merit, &quot;playability,&quot; or personality!  They weren&#39;t used to that, really.  <br/>
They seemed more used to deciding whether to play based on that answer and <br/>
then all that was left was to determine dominance.<br/>
<br/>
She started to see that for herself, and it helped.<br/>
<br/>
She still isn&#39;t a fluent reader at ten, but she was precocious about <br/>
interpersonal stuff, and understands now things about parenting, sibling <br/>
relations, dynamics between friends that I didn&#39;t figure out until I was <br/>
grown.  I think it&#39;s mostly because I was not allowed in and out of real <br/>
families and mixed-age groups, because....  I was limited to kids in my own <br/>
grade, largely.  And when I visited their families, I was treated as &quot;a <br/>
fourth grader&quot; or whatever I happened to &quot;BE&quot; at the time.<br/>

Sounds similar to our reaction.  I like the suggestion to concentrate on our kids&#39; strengths, rather than just telling them they&#39;re &quot;smarter&quot;.  Probably a quick defensive reaction for my daughter on my part!<br/>
