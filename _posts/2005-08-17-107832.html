<div id="ygrps-yiv-727707844">Hi my name is Jenn, mom to Emelynn(6) and Adrienne (4). We have been<br/>
unschooling (in the strictly educational sense) and I am trying to<br/>
apply the principles of unschooling to our lifestyle as well. <br/>
<br/>
Today I took the plunge and did away with food controls. And my kids<br/>
promptly binged on a half a bag of Hershey Miniatures. Of course they<br/>
also ate grapes and apples and yogurt and tomatoes and turkey. I&#39;m<br/>
sure they just don&#39;t think that the limits are *really* gone and at<br/>
any time I might start restricting them again. I&#39;m sure they just need<br/>
time to trust that they are *really* able to make their own choices. <br/>
<br/>
I am trying not to overreact and revert back to the way things have<br/>
always been. This is all normal, right? Will things level out after a<br/>
while? Thanx for listening to my mini panic attack and any<br/>
reassurance/advice/opinions are appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, so you likely said something to the effect &quot;I&#39;m not going to <br/>
limit you any more. Eat whatever you want&quot;. Now, they&#39;re uncertain <br/>
about when their &#39;real mom&#39; is coming back (lol) so they&#39;re going <br/>
all out and you&#39;re getting nervous. Yes, what they are doing is <br/>
common. And what you&#39;re doing is common. If you look at the <br/>
archives, most folks usually say instead of summarily dismissing <br/>
controls, just say Yes a lot. &quot;can I have a miniature?&quot; yes &quot;Can I <br/>
have another miniature?&quot; Yes. The panic will recede as they come to <br/>
see that the miniatures and whatever else will be available (of <br/>
course, if they&#39;re all eaten, might have to wait until grocery day <br/>
for more - that&#39;s just a real life budget issue)<br/>
<br/>
BTW also notice that they have eaten fruit, veggies, dairy and <br/>
protein in the process. <br/>

someone&#39;s advice to ease up gradually so that you could say &quot;Yes&quot; 300 happy little <br/>
times instead of one big baffling &quot;whatever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It might have been happier for them and easier for you.    <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it will hurt in the longrun, but when you&#39;re in a discussion <br/>
later and someone&#39;s asking about it, maybe pass on the idea of just saying yes, <br/>
not forcing kids to take a taste or finishing the plate, letting them have <br/>
more than two cookies, saying &quot;Okay&quot; if they only want dessert, saying &quot;Sure&quot; if <br/>
they ask you to buy a pink-sprinkled donut.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am trying not to overreact and revert back to the way things have<br/>

<br/>
If you do revert, you&#39;ll cause more problems.   You know that.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-Will things level out after a while?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the answer to that was &quot;no,&quot; why would anyone be living without <br/>
restrictions?   (Although it IS easier to start lives without restrictions than to go <br/>
back on all the blah-blah justifications a mom had been using to say no, <br/>
probably. )<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my hierarchy of the moment on what the best situations are:<br/>
child making choices from birth, nursing when he wishes, no schedule, no <br/>
forced foods<br/>
child gradually allowed to make more choices<br/>
child suddenly allowed to make choices<br/>
child allowed, then disallowed, then allowed kind of, then mom freaks, then <br/>
SAYS he&#39;s allowed but doesn&#39;t really allow<br/>
child never allowed to make choices until he&#39;s old enough to sneak around and <br/>
choose behind his mom&#39;s back (or later)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It really isn&#39;t as sudden as it seems. I do try to say yes most of the<br/>
time. I never make them eat anything they don&#39;t want and I offer<br/>
alternatives. I just have a tendency to kind of jump in and say,<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s enough,&quot; when they ask for (what I consider) a lot of sweets.<br/>
I thought if I could let go of that control, then I could eliminate<br/>
the feeling of, &quot;I want it because I&#39;m not allowed to have it,&quot; and it<br/>
would become just another kind of food like everything else they eat.<br/>

mozzarella cheese for the rest of their lives lol.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>By nature, kids will gravitate to what they need at the time - unless <br/>
it becomes part of a sneaky power struggle thing. One thing to maybe <br/>
remind yourself over and over is that kids tend to balance out over a <br/>
long stretch - a month or so - rather than the &quot;3 square meals, food <br/>
pyramid every day&quot; that we&#39;ve been taught is &quot;the right way to eat&quot;. <br/>
It&#39;s actually better to have 4 to 6 smaller &quot;meals&quot; than 3 squares. <br/>
And sometimes a body needs a particular thing more than other stuff <br/>
and it will look for it wherever it can - and that can also go way out <br/>
of whack if it can&#39;t get/doesn&#39;t get it - it kind of gets &#39;stuck&#39; <br/>
in &#39;need pizza&#39; mode ;-) One of the draws (among several) of <br/>
typical &quot;snack foods&quot; (cookies, chips, etc) is that it is designed to <br/>
be easily accessible - no prep time, no plates, silverware, etc. So, <br/>
especially for kids who are in the &quot;I&#39;ll do it myself&quot; mode, that is <br/>
attractive. Proactively providing what Sandra has called a &#39;monkey <br/>
platter&#39; (pre sliced fruits, veggies, cheeses, et al) can help some - <br/>
food is handy right there when they want it. Things like string cheese <br/>
and baby belle cheese are self-contained, easy open and portable (DS <br/>
is a cheese lover too!) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t eat candy. Barely any. My kids like candy--just like dh. It <br/>
was hard for me when I stopped stopping them from eating as much candy <br/>
as they like. They will eat sooo much more than I ever would. I don&#39;t <br/>
even like watching anyone else eat a lot of candy! Makes my teeth <br/>
hurt, lol.<br/>
<br/>
At first they ate tons because they could. Now, some days they have <br/>
none, some days a little and some days a lot. But when I shared some <br/>
chocolates with them, they didn&#39;t even finish 2 little pieces! <br/>
<br/>
They eat differently than I would choose to feed them. More candy, <br/>
less chocolate and a lot more fruit and sweet veggies like corn and <br/>
carrots. Popsicles when there&#39;s perfectly good chocolate ice cream <br/>
available. Weird. But just fine.<br/>
<br/>
So yeh, they probably won&#39;t binge everyday for the rest of their <br/>
lives, but it may not look like *your* idea of normal.<br/>
<br/>
--aj, who is pretty sure the kids are related to me, despite their <br/>
bizzare views on chocolate</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I called it that because one day we were at the zoo when they fed the <br/>
monkeys, and that&#39;s what they had put down--Trays with little cubes and chops of <br/>
finger-food.   Each piece was one bite, or two or three.   There was so much they <br/>
didn&#39;t need to fight over it.   It looked good! &lt;g&gt;   (Didn&#39;t have cheese...) <br/>
<br/>
So that day when we got back I made Kirby and Marty &quot;a monkey platter,&quot; and <br/>
often thereafter they&#39;d ask for one and sometimes still when there are other <br/>
kids over and they&#39;re busy, I&#39;ll make one up.   If more artsily presented, it&#39;s <br/>
hors d&#39;oeuvres.    Instead of building fancy combos, though, I pile the foods <br/>
separately (kid-style) and stick toothpicks in the pineapple chunks (or cheese <br/>
cubes if there&#39;s no pineapple that day) and they can spear whatever else they <br/>
want with that or eat with their fingers.   I make one plate (or big platter) <br/>
for however many kids there are, or if they&#39;re scattered and can&#39;t reach one, <br/>
I&#39;ve made two (like for movie-watching in the den).<br/>

as far as regulations on food, etc (only restrictions we had were due<br/>
to having a school schedule) eventually coming around to unschooling<br/>
in education.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, don&#39;t worry your kids are young and will come around, I have<br/>
here on a usual summer day, my 2 kids and at least 5 extra kids (aged<br/>
1-14) the extra kids are all non unschooled.  At the beginging of<br/>
summer it takes them a few weeks or so to realize they can eat when<br/>
and what they want. (If we have it) And they go crazy they go so far<br/>
my boys and I will occasionally hide our favorite treats for after<br/>
everyone (or most of them) have left.<br/>
<br/>
But usually by mid July they calm down a bit and through it all, they<br/>
always seem to get plenty of dairy ( 2 gallons of milk somedays) and<br/>
protein and all that &quot;good&quot; stufff  and most of the stuff they pick<br/>
out of the Garden doesn&#39;t make it into the house.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have fun<br/>
