<div id="ygrps-yiv-112873571">Hello All Dear E-mail Friends,<br/>
 <br/>
This fall my children and I are walking in the Alzheimer&#39;s Memory <br/>
Walk in Honor of my Grandfather (their Great-Grandfather). <br/>
Why are we doing this? Our dear papa has Alzheimer&#39;s (has had it for <br/>
a number of years), and we have learned first hand just how de-<br/>
moralizing, de-meaning and horrible, horrible this disease is!!<br/>
 <br/>
Will your children remember you?  Will they remember all the fun <br/>
things you did together? If your parent (s) gets this disease they <br/>
may not!  My Grandfather was an awesome man! (Still is) I love him so <br/>
dearly, he taught me so many things! He is still teaching me, <br/>
teaching me patience, more love than I ever thought I would feel, and <br/>
he taught me to fish : ) <br/>
 <br/>
I am sending this to all on my e-mail list, so if your are not close <br/>
enough to walk, then maybe you will send a donation, it&#39;s money to <br/>
find a cure! If you are close consider walking with us, send me an <br/>
email and I will give you send more info! If you wish to donate you <br/>
can send a check to :<br/>
 <br/>
KCE Academy <br/>
259 Mt. Auburn<br/>
Dunkirk, IN<br/>
47336<br/>
 <br/>
Please make all checks out to Alzheimer&#39;s Association and date it for <br/>
Sept. 1 2003<br/>
 <br/>
I thank you all so kindly and wish upon wish that you may never <br/>
suffer this disease with any one you know and love!<br/>
 <br/>
Tami Labig-Duquette<br/>
P.s. Please let me know either way what you do, It&#39;s ok not to <br/>
donate, knowing we have you wishes and luck is GREAT!<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764363295">Good luck on your walk!  I know first hand how doing a walk and raising<br/>
money for a worthy cause makes you feel.  In the past year I&#39;ve raised $9000<br/>
for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  Once I crossed that first finish line,<br/>
my life was forever changed, and I went on to do two more events.  Have fun!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984406023">Just  thought it was interesting - and gratifying that an article could <br/>
really  make such a difference in a kid&#39;s life. Our park day group is <br/>
pretty much  made up of unschoolers and a few relaxed homeschoolers. <br/>
This is one of the  founding families - even though they&#39;ve never been <br/>
close to being  unschoolers, they have always hung out with unschoolers. <br/>
So, interesting  to me that they&#39;ve decided to do it after many many <br/>
years of them doing  curriculum while the rest of us  unschooled.<br/>

****Thanks for sharing Pam,<br/>

You just never know what will happen.  My two youngest kids were along  with <br/>
me at the Folk Dance Center for years. Donika became an involved dancer,  and <br/>
is now majoring in dance.  But that wasn&#39;t my point :-).  One  woman there <br/>
knew us, and years later, she informed me that when her  granddaughter had been <br/>
born, she had a long talk with her daughter, and they  decided the g&#39;daughter <br/>
should be homeschooled because the woman was so impressed  with my kids.  I was <br/>
blown away because we really hadn&#39;t had much, if  any, discussion on the <br/>
subject, and we weren&#39;t close friends or anything  like that.<br/>
 <br/>
How wonderful that you saw the result of the article - it was so helpful to  <br/>
show direction to that family - taking them just where they wanted to go!!  <br/>
