<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;   If you believe that a soul chooses all of that,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, because what&#39;s put into my path is part of *my* purpose for being on <br/>
this earth.  If I didn&#39;t help when I could, that would hinder my own <br/>
growth.  Using the excuse that they chose what&#39;s happening to them just <br/>
wouldn&#39;t cut it.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Is there anyone on the list who doesn&#39;t believe in the *existence* of <br/>
souls? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought about this since I was little, and have been in and through <br/>
various &quot;systems&quot; of belief, and on this end of it, at 48, I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;m <br/>
agnostic about the existence of souls.  I see interesting things happen, and <br/>
they don&#39;t prove there&#39;s an afterlife, I hear weird theories about why there <br/>
are 6 billion people on a planet that used to have none, and they all sound <br/>
goofy, but I look at a wadded up dishrag growing bacteria, and that seems <br/>
more like earth than a woozy seven-level soul-wash leading to perfection.  <br/>
Why?  What are those perfect souls going to do with themselves?  Some <br/>
religions say:  start their own worlds.  Whoop dee doooo!    What for!?<br/>
<br/>
So although the soothing violet-lit incense-filled new age explanations are <br/>
kinda cool like getting your back scratched or your hair brushed, when you <br/>
ask &quot;why?&quot; no better answer than &quot;it feels good&quot; comes back.<br/>
<br/>
IF my soul is going to last for many more lifetimes, what&#39;s the hurry?  And <br/>
if I&#39;m a big fancy bacteria with a computer and a car, what&#39;s the hurry?  <br/>

Tonight we&#39;re having someone for dinner.  That&#39;s for real.<br/>

Tomorrow morning a family I like a lot is coming for lunch and game-playing.<br/>

brushed. I like to feel good.<br/>
<br/>
As a Taoist, my answer to souls and afterlife and why is &quot;mu&quot;, which means <br/>
&quot;no thing&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter. But feeling good, and helping others to feel <br/>
good, are of foremost concern in my life. Connecting with the Tao, whatever <br/>
that life force that runs through all of us is, that&#39;s my concern. And those <br/>
connections are very real, very now, in how I deal with friends, family and <br/>
the world at large.<br/>

<br/>
A lot of Hindus and Buddhists!<br/>
<br/>
Karma isn&#39;t a negative thing.  It&#39;s balance, and the belief that things <br/>
balance out and that people need to accept some things graciously.<br/>
<br/>
You can find prayers for deliverance from rebirth and suchlike, but not much <br/>
literature I&#39;ve ever seen (okay, none that I&#39;ve ever seen) about &quot;rebirth is <br/>
forever--veg out and don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;  They want heaven too, they just <br/>
think it&#39;s not one fatal accident away.<br/>

movie, &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
