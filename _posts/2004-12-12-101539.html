<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678217434">&lt;&lt; 5. Let them work it out.<br/>
Ask them to do something that&#39;ll make them gang up on you. Picking up toys or <br/>
some other much-hated chore should do the trick.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could just stop listening in and worrying. You might be amazed to find <br/>
they work things out themselves.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part 1:  Teach them to further hate picking up toys?<br/>
Inspire them to believe that picking toys up should only be done by those who <br/>
are in trouble?  (I see county-jail inmates picking up trash in Albuquerque, <br/>
but that doesn&#39;t mean I should litter; people should pick up their own <br/>
possessions because they WANT to, and they see value in it, not because they were <br/>
bad.)<br/>
<br/>
But wait...<br/>
Telling them to pick up toys isn&#39;t &quot;let them work it out.&quot;  There was no <br/>
elaboration on &quot;Let them work it out.&quot;  Because it&#39;s a bad idea and can&#39;t be <br/>
explained away.<br/>
<br/>
And find something so they will &quot;gang up on you&quot; seems by the nature of the <br/>
way it&#39;s worded to encourage MORE negativity, and to accept that &quot;ganging up&quot; <br/>
is an inevitable (and in this case desired) behavior.  NOT solutions.  Just <br/>
ways to make the overall situation worse in the future.<br/>
<br/>
And that second part, the summary of the five items, &quot;Or you could just stop <br/>
listening in and worrying. You might be amazed to find <br/>
they work things out themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Stop listening?<br/>
Stop listening to children?<br/>
<br/>
You could stop worrying if you NEVER stopped listening.  If you had always <br/>
listened and responded, there would be little to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
You might be amazed to find they work things out themselves, and wouldn&#39;t <br/>
that be convenient for the mom?  Wouldn&#39;t that make a mom who&#39;s willing to ignore <br/>
her children feel better?<br/>
<br/>
You might be less amazed, and it would be more likely, to find that they had <br/>
NOT worked things out themselves, but continued to yell, insult and hurt one <br/>
another for year after year, and go on to hurt others in the same ways unless <br/>
as young children they are helped to learn better ways to interact.  And it&#39;s <br/>
possible to help them do that as long as parents don&#39;t accept bad mainstream <br/>
advice and expect it to do anything other than help produce bad mainstream <br/>
behavior.<br/>
