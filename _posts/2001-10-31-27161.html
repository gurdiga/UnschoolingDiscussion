<div id="ygrps-yiv-573409267">Well Donna, the problem is some folks have not discovered the joys of the<br/>
delete key.  And, please, if you are on digest, no rant/attack (been there<br/>
done that) about you can&#39;t delete.  You can scroll past.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do think we should all try to cure one of my very bad habits (bad<br/>
Lynda &lt;g&gt;) and KISS the posts more frequently AND update the subject line.<br/>
See, I changed the subject line AND KISSed the post, even someone OAD can<br/>
learn new tricks &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; Start a new thread. Don&#39;t read what annoys you. Start talking about what<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re interested in, get other folks interested with you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is the essence of unschooling, for adults and kids too. Don&#39;t tell<br/>
&gt; people they shouldn&#39;t be interested in something because you aren&#39;t, don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; expect them to do and say exactly what you are interested in doing and<br/>
&gt; saying. If you want to learn about something, do it. If you want to show<br/>
&gt; people something wonderful, do it. If you want to stop listening and go<br/>
read<br/>
&gt; a book, do it. Don&#39;t drag your kids off from what they&#39;re interested in to<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; what you think is important, and don&#39;t shush adults either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It IS a free country. The framers of our constitution established free<br/>
speech<br/>
&gt; as a right PRECISELY for situations like this, so that no one need ever<br/>
fear<br/>
&gt; criticizing their government, it&#39;s actions, or it&#39;s policies. If it truly<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; the greatest nation on earth that is a huge reason why.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m interested in hearing everything folks have to say on all sides of<br/>
this,<br/>
&gt; except I&#39;d like to ask the shushers to please, go ahead and talk about<br/>
&gt; something else but allow the rest of these folks to talk in peace here<br/>
&gt; without trying to shut them up. Their opinions can&#39;t hurt you or our<br/>
country.<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
