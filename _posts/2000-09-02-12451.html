<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912580362">*NOW*, *unschooling*???  I hadn&#39;t thought of THAT!!!  too funny, roflol!!!<br/>
... actually, our feline friends ARE VERY RELAXED, so I think they&#39;d prob<br/>
take to unschooling *BEAUTIFULLY* haha ...  as far a using the computer, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t put it past them!!! &lt;G&gt;   one of our cats ANSWERS THE PHONE, no<br/>
fooling!!!   he knocks the receiver off and *MEOWSSSSSS*; it&#39;s HYSTERICAL!!!<br/>
yep, @ our house the kids AND CAT try to outrun each other to answer the<br/>
phone, haha ...<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve always had our felines altered @ 6 mths, if you do it too early it<br/>
won&#39;t work (@ least, I think that&#39;s right???) ... I&#39;m w/ you, I&#39;d LOVE to<br/>
have TONS AND TONS of cats; I&#39;m such a sucker for cats/dogs/anything that<br/>
doesn&#39;t SLITHER!!!<br/>
<br/>
uhhhh, wellllllllll, as for as the *smells*, I use a *muliple* cat litter<br/>
and change their box out w/ fresh litter 3 x&#39;s a week ... I also rinse out<br/>
their box w/ ammonia~type cleaner, let the box air outside and cover the<br/>
bottom w/ a layer of baking soda b/f adding a plastic bag and fresh litter<br/>
... I think the trick to controlling smells is keeping the box *cleaned* out<br/>
... both of our cats were adopted @ the same time so they don&#39;t mind sharing<br/>
a box ... we got our last cats @ different times and the older cat was<br/>
HORRIBLE about leaving what dh called *protest pkgs* until we figured out he<br/>
was upset about SHARING HIS BOX w/ a *stranger* ... so each cat had a<br/>
*personal* box, which was a pain in the neck but easier dealing w/ than<br/>
SURPRISES!!!<br/>
<br/>
hth, back to lurking :)<br/>
Pris ... ~&gt; who this past week celebrated 28th anniversary w/ the most<br/>
wonderful fella, thank you Lord (again, I&#39;m NOT that old, I was just married<br/>
*really~really* young when we married!!!) &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WARNING: I cannot be help responsible for the above, as apparently my cats<br/>
have learned how to type ...<br/>

Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom]cats!!--was corporal punishment<br/>
<br/>
&gt; That subject line is kinda&#39; strange, I know. Sorry! but my funnybone was<br/>
&gt; tickled when imagining cats typing at a computer keyboard. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I adore cats.  I have 5, and would own more if I could stand the upkeep<br/>
(and<br/>
&gt; if my husband would let me!).  My problem is smell. Ugh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can the cat lovers on this list share their best remedies for that<br/>
&gt; mystifying odor which wafts through the home containing cats? My boys and<br/>
&gt; girls are potty trained very well.  No accidents for several weeks now.<br/>
&gt; (Three of them are only babies-2 3 month olds and 1 6 month old.) I&#39;ve<br/>
found<br/>
&gt; all the old messes and do a good smell check every day for possible new<br/>
&gt; ones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And does anyone know at what age a male cat can be neutered? I want to get<br/>
&gt; my boys taken care of before any of that territorial spraying instinct<br/>
&gt; begins to manifest itself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AND has anyone ever tried unschooling 5 cats? :-)<br/>
