<div id="ygrps-yiv-121572618">Hi all, this is kind of OT, but does anyone know the name of the PBS artist <br/>
with the curly hair? He is the one who is always painting a &quot;happy&quot; bush or <br/>
tree.... LOL My DD loves to watch him, but I can&#39;t remember his name and I <br/>
need the info for an article I am writing on TV and kids.<br/>
Thanks <br/>
Teri</div>
