<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066421475">Thanks Brenda,  I&#39;ll look into that.<br/>
On the food choice thing,  I wish I never craved chocolate and coke, but for me its a fact of life.  So I like healthy foods except those? (yeah, I can hear the sighs) So I do end up buying those and of course my kids love them too,, my husband just has other junk that he likes,  chips, and sugared cereal!  What a pair we are!<br/>
