<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Isn&#39;t that enough or are we being selfish? Any thoughts? Sandra, what&#39;s your<br/>
&gt; thoughts?<br/>
&gt; How can we handle this without leaving on bad terms? There I go with the word<br/>
&gt; bad, you know what I mean. Christopher doesn&#39;t want to loose the wonderful<br/>
&gt; relationship he has with his grandparents but they won&#39;t talk to him either<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s in tears. I&#39;m so angry that they are acting like this!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>((((((((((Kim)))))))))  How stressful this sounds for you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really happy for your family; it sounds like a long-time dream is really<br/>
coming true for you, and it also sounds like unschooling is helping you all<br/>
be at peace with each other.  That&#39;s wonderful.  Is that selfish?  Not in my<br/>
book.  It&#39;s great to care about your parents, and to weigh what they think.<br/>
But in the end, you have to do what is going to be right for yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hasn&#39;t been long since you told them, so time may help smooth things<br/>
out some.  Perhaps you can work some things out with your in-laws with firm<br/>
plans.  Maybe they&#39;d feel better if they know that you&#39;re definitely coming<br/>
on the first weekend of every month or something like that.  Agree to call<br/>
every week, etc. It sounds like they are panicking and not being reasonable<br/>
right now.   <br/>
<br/>
I hope that you can communicate to both sets of grandparents just how<br/>
important they are to your son, and how hurt he is by their apparent<br/>
rejection of your choices.  Write it, call them and tell them, whatever it<br/>
takes.  Make sure they know that you aren&#39;t going to lie down and put up<br/>
with them being hurtful of him.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone else will have better ideas.<br/>
