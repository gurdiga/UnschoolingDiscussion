&gt; high <br/>
&gt; cliff, and you have plenty of time to get used to the feel of the wind in <br/>
&gt; your hair up here. <br/>

  I&#39;m having a Sandra moment!  In my mind, yesterday, I was comparing <br/>
unschooling to jumping off a cliff.  Kelly&#39;s analogy continues here:<br/>
<br/>
If you jump with a &quot;schooled safety net&quot;, it&#39;ll just bounce you back on the <br/>
cliff. If you jump with a &quot;curriculum rope&quot;, you&#39;ll always be clinging to <br/>
that rope, KNOWING that it&#39;s a safetyline. <br/>
<br/>
Me:<br/>
  I LOVE that!<br/>
  What I was thinking yesterday, though, was from Mary Poppins.  Remember how <br/>
Uncle Albert taught the kids to fly?  By thinking happy thoughts?  Well, when <br/>
we step off that cliff, we just have to look at the joy on our kids faces, <br/>
and their delight in living, and that&#39;ll keep us aloft.  <br/>
  Don&#39;t let the negativity of naysayers drag you down.  Soar!<br/>

&quot;I once knew a man with a wooden leg named Smith.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Really?&quot; chortled Uncle Albert.  &quot;What was the name of his other leg?&quot;<br/>
Hahahahahahahah<br/>
(from the 45 record with the little read-along book)<br/>

My own jump took place 5 months ago.  <br/>
But I was still worried about my &#39;non-reader&#39;, so tried to get him to read normal stuff to me.  Well, that didn&#39;t work either.  We had stopped doing any curriculum or phonics stuff, but I was still clinging to the idea that he needed to be taught to read.  He had been given one of those alphabet labels when he was 6, and it damaged the way I looked at my son.<br/>
I started listening and reading here on this list.  I finally let go of the last of it about 4 months ago, and even stopped asking him to read to me or to read anything, and have finally stopped saying, &quot;great reading!&quot; in a stupid &quot;encouraging voice&quot; every time he sounded out a word in the TV Guide or on the cereal box, or wherever.  I just kept reading aloud to him when he asked, and waited.<br/>
My 11.5yo &quot;non-reader&quot; came into 5yo&#39;s room last night and asked to listen to the books I was reading him.  I said sure and made room for him on the bed. <br/>
He picked up one of the books and said, &quot;I think I want to try reading this one&quot; and proceeded to read about 12 pages out loud, hesitating on only a few words!  Then asked me to read the rest of the book, which I did.<br/>
I know, not much, but to me is was golden.    <br/>
I&#39;m excited! <br/>
I am going to keep on waiting.  I&#39;m not going to think of him as a &#39;non-reader&#39; and every time that pops into my head I am going to squash it.<br/>
Thanks to all on this list who helped me let go of the ledge.<br/>
