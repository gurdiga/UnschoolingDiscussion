<div id="ygrps-yiv-538720884">I was at the dentist this afternoon with my 6yo for his checkup.  <br/>
<br/>
New hygenist ... typical banter ... &quot;Did you go to school today?&quot;  He replied: &quot;I homeschool&quot;.  Then the typical comments to me ... &quot;Wow&quot; and &quot;you must be very organized&quot; to which I just smiled.  Then with a little giggle she asked him &quot;Is your teacher tough?&quot; to which he promptly replied &quot;No, I&#39;m never wrong!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Too funny!<br/>
