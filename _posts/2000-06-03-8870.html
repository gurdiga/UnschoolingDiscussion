Yes, we know that organic is pesticide free, hormone free, antibiotic free, <br/>
and naturally grown.  However this does make a tremendous difference in <br/>
children when you are fighting to prevent other allergies.  The chemicals in <br/>
our foods and environment attach to the IGA and IGE in your body (the <br/>
antibodies that fight the allergens) and then together begin an attack on <br/>
other substances consumed.  I can&#39;t put it into precise words, but the <br/>
chemicals are obviously VERY BAD and cause our bodies to respond differently <br/>
to highly allergenic foods.  Remember when we were kids and there were not <br/>
that many people with food allergies?  And with only a few allergies at a <br/>
time for the most part?  Do you notice the difference with our children?  <br/>
There are tons more highly allergenic children now as compared to even 25 <br/>
years ago.  Hmm, I think it has to do a lot with the chemicals consumed!  <br/>
The chemicals are much harder on a little child&#39;s body than on an <br/>
adult...not to say it&#39;s good for adults!  Yes, we do homeopathy, <br/>
chiropractor, nutritionist, and I read, read, read!!! Currently avoidance of <br/>
the allergenic foods, supplements, flax seed meal, vitamin E and C and <br/>
organic foods has helped us tremendously.  Both boys have not added any more <br/>
allergies to their list!  Yay! I can relate to your husband&#39;s asthma...it <br/>
runs rampid throughout our family and this is what I am fighting to keep my <br/>
sons from getting.  I have read a lot about the &quot;asthma march&quot; that starts <br/>
with simple food or environment allergies and then turns into asthma.  Sorry <br/>
to ramble, just thought you&#39;d like to know the organic scoop!<br/>
