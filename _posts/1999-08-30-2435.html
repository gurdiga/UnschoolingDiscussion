<div id="ygrps-yiv-880603465">My son and I did a great project last year.  He read a couple of old sci-fi<br/>
novels about time travel to the future, and we watched a couple of movies<br/>
together, and then talked about what the authors had forseen as being<br/>
commonplace in the 1990s, and what really is here in the 90s.  The one thing<br/>
that none of the writers 50 years ago had envisioned was the personal<br/>
computer!  I enjoyed the project as much as he did.<br/>

the background color!  I YEARNED for that computer.  That was 17 or 18 years<br/>
ago.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My son asked me how come Cds were so big before they made them<br/>
&gt; &gt; little!  Good question!<br/>
