I would love to know where you are located in SC.  I am in the Myrtle Beach<br/>
area.  Still looking for like minds in this area.  I read about others on<br/>
this list living near one another and getting together.  What fun.  It can<br/>
be a lonely journey at times.  There are days I would really enjoy some<br/>
fellowship from those on the same journey.  Could I be lucky enough to find<br/>
you are near???<br/>
