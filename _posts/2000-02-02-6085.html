<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086034204">LLL(GB) has an Alumni assoc, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just for Leaders though.  I know what you mean, I have thought of putting together a British &#39;attachment&#39; parenting site, but it&#39;s not the same as having regular contact with like-minded souls in the flesh, as it were.  Especially when one&#39;s mother is doing her darndest to instill competitiveness into MY daughters  &lt;groan&gt;<br/>

Best wishes<br/>
