&gt; Honor Your Child&#39;s Need for Solitude<br/>
&gt; By Fred Rogers<br/>
&gt; Fred Rogers, one of the most courageous supporters of childhood, better<br/>
&gt; known as television&#39;s &quot;Mister Rogers,&quot; a cultural icon and kindly neighbor<br/>
&gt; to generations of American children, died Thursday, February 27, at the<br/>
age<br/>
&gt; of 74.   Here is one of his many great essays.<br/>
&gt; It isn&#39;t only famous movie stars who want to be alone, and whenever I hear<br/>
&gt; a celebrity speak of the value of times of solitude and privacy, I find<br/>
&gt; myself thinking once again how real and deep the need for such times is<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; all human beings.at all ages.<br/>
&gt; Even for babies?  Solitude? Yes, in some ways, especially for babies-and<br/>
&gt; certainly that need is real as babies grow into toddlers and preschoolers.<br/>
&gt; In one family we know, the parents bombarded their baby daughter with toys<br/>
&gt; that rattled and tinkles and jiggled and spun, toys of all shapes and<br/>
colors<br/>
&gt; and textures.  It seemed as thought that baby hardly had a waking moment<br/>
&gt; without intense outside stimulation of one kind or another.<br/>
&gt; Her parents were well meaning; they wanted to encourage her to develop and<br/>
&gt; learn in any way they could.  But that baby, like most babies, needed time<br/>
&gt; to get used to all the new things she was finding in her new world.<br/>
&gt; Even without the parents&#39; efforts to stimulate her, the world is<br/>
&gt; stimulating enough!  She needed times that were quiet, times of solitude,<br/>
&gt; and she let her parents know it: when they still insisted she pay<br/>
attention,<br/>
&gt; she&#39;d close her eyes and go to sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It can be hard for parents to have their babies turn away from them.  When<br/>
&gt; a mother finds her baby turning away from her face, it can even seem like<br/>
&gt; rejection.  But faces, for babies, tend to be even more stimulating than<br/>
&gt; toys, and a baby who can avoid over stimulation by turning away for a time<br/>
&gt; may already be showing a healthy coping skill that will be useful all<br/>
&gt; through life.<br/>
&gt; The kind of solitude we are talking about goes by many names.  It may be<br/>
&gt; called &quot;quiet time&quot; or &quot;down time.&quot;  It may be criticized as &quot;daydreaming&quot;<br/>
&gt; or &quot;wool-gathering&quot; (particularly in school), or it may be promoted later<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; as &quot;meditation&quot; or &quot;deep relaxation.&quot;<br/>
&gt; But whatever it&#39;s called, it&#39;s a time to ourselves, away from outside<br/>
&gt; stimulation, during which inner turbulence can settle, and we can become<br/>
&gt; more familiar and more comfortable with our feelings.<br/>
&gt; Solitude is different from loneliness and doesn&#39;t have to be a lonely kind<br/>
&gt; of thing.  In fact, very young children usually find it hard to be all<br/>
alone<br/>
&gt; for a long time.  For them the best times of solitude may occur with<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; they love and trust nearby, even in the same room.<br/>
&gt; They may need the reassuring presence of an adult in order to let go, to<br/>
&gt; feel their feelings. to think back over an event that troubled them, or to<br/>
&gt; think ahead to a new challenge.  It&#39;s the same kind of comforting<br/>
&quot;solitary<br/>
&gt; togetherness,&quot; the companionship in silence that spouses and old friends<br/>
&gt; sometimes provide one another.<br/>
&gt; Years ago, I came across a book by the Danish religious philosopher<br/>
&gt; Johannes Anker-Larsen.  It was called With the Door Open: My Experience.<br/>
A<br/>
&gt; passage from it has always stayed with me:<br/>
&gt; &quot;The most comprehensive formula for human culture which I know was given<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; the old peasant who, on his deathbed, obtained from his son this one<br/>
&gt; promise: to sit every day for a half an hour ALONE in the best room.  The<br/>
&gt; son did this and became a model for the whole district.  This father&#39;s<br/>
&gt; command has take thought for everything, for Eternity, soul-deepening,<br/>
&gt; refinement, history.&quot;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve thought a good deal about the meaning of that passage.  When I see a<br/>
&gt; baby quietly staring at his or her hands..or a toddler off in a corner<br/>
&gt; putting something into a cup and then taking it out, over and over again.<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; a preschooler lying in the grass daydreaming. I like to think that they,<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; their own ways, are &quot;alone in the best room&quot; of their houses, using the<br/>
&gt; solitude they need to find the courage to grow.<br/>
