<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342425520">Hi, <br/>
We&#39;d love to hear more about NBTS camp from kids who have attended it!<br/>
My daughter will be 12 in May.<br/>
She IS interested in NBTS camp. Maybe not for this Summer, but 2007.<br/>
I am also interested in working at it!<br/>
Also, tell me more about the Live and Learn conference too!<br/>
My state&#39;s homeschool curriculum fair convention just doesn&#39;t do it for me.<br/>
Thanks! <br/>

easy for me to memorize:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/abq">http://sandradodd.com/abq</a><br/>
<br/>
And it links to the real site, plus has info on the physical site and  <br/>
surroundings of this year&#39;s, and links to MANY many photos of last  <br/>
year&#39;s.<br/>
