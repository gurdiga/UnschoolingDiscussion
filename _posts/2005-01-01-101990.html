 </span></blockquote>Google. Seriously. I think just about anything anyone needs or wants <br/>
to know can be found somewhere on the internet. <br/>
<br/>
I think the important thing about unschooling is not &quot;staying one <br/>
step ahead&quot; of your child, or knowing the answer to every possible <br/>
question he may have, but rather helping him find those answers for <br/>
himself, with as much or as little assistance from you as he <br/>
desires. I also think that with those &quot;unschooling tools&quot; in your <br/>
toolbox, you can help him gain a more authentic learning experience, <br/>
by that i mean if he is interested in say, astronomy, he may find it <br/>
more interesting to talk to a real astronomer, go to a planetarium <br/>
as much as he pleases (rather than crammed into a school field <br/>
trip), get out the telescope and look at the real stars, instead of <br/>
just reading about it in a textbook. YOU dont have to be the expert, <br/>
just help him find the info he needs to satisfy what it is he is <br/>
trying to learn about.<br/>

to &quot;teach&quot; your son, and you don&#39;t have to be his only resource. <br/>

Hi, Laurie --<br/>
<br/>
I think I understand your concern.  When I was 6, I was very advanced in &quot;reading&quot; and pretty good in &quot;math&quot;.  My first grade teacher said to my mom &quot;I can&#39;t teach her anything&quot;, which my mom thought was a bit silly, as the teacher was a grown woman and actually knew tons of stuff that I didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
If you know how to look stuff up using Google, or are willing to learn, you can be very helpful to your son, even as he grows and leaves you behind in some areas.  And lots of us have found that it is really fun to learn stuff about &quot;history&quot; and &quot;science&quot; and how the world works that we didn&#39;t grasp when we were kids.  It can actually be surprisingly enjoyable.  If you have some research skills, and know how to get to the local library &lt;g&gt; and to find people around you who have skills that you don&#39;t, you really are good to go.<br/>
<br/>
Caring about your child and about meeting his needs, and being flexible in your approach are the big advantages of homeschooling over formal schooling in an institution.<br/>

<br/>
It is ok to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know. Let&#39;s look it up.&quot; I do it *all the time*,<br/>
and I&#39;m a college graduate with honors and former high school valedictorian.<br/>
My education is utterly irrelevant to Jayn&#39;s Unschooling journey, although<br/>
to be honest I could throw it around to silence doubting acquaintances. I<br/>
used to do this more often a couple of years ago, before I had truly settled<br/>
in to Unschooling. I don&#39;t bother with it now, and can see more problems<br/>
with my schooling than I used to - the &quot;deschooling&quot; process at work.<br/>
<br/>
If you let go of your expectation that *you* are doing the educating it may<br/>
help you get to Unschooling with joy quicker.<br/>
 <br/>
My dd is 5. She often says, &quot;Let&#39;s look up ..... on the internet&quot;. This<br/>
internet is a fantastic resource, if only to get a bibliography on a topic<br/>
of interest to take along to the library.<br/>
<br/>
Our children are growing up in an informational world that is swiftly making<br/>
the school and even college educations of many of their parents hopelessly<br/>
inadequate and outdated. The key is knowing how to seek and find the<br/>
information we, and they, want.<br/>
<br/>
The real questions that are tough are those that are answered by the heart<br/>
and soul, rather than the intellect like, &quot;What happens when someone dies?&quot;<br/>
or &quot;My friend won&#39;t listen to me say sorry&quot;. Others may have more examples.<br/>
<br/>
Since your child is so young, you might enjoy adding Always Unschooled to<br/>
your library of e-lists.<br/>

 <br/>
Well, just wait until he&#39;s 16! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
You answer what you can. You look up others. And you find people (mentors)  <br/>
who share his passion(s) for everything else. <br/>
 <br/>
My 16 year old is into music and film-making and magic and art. He has a  <br/>
drumming teacher in Danny (Danny&#39;s older than I am by a generation or so!  &lt;G&gt;). <br/>
Skip Pearson is older than that and plays sax; he&#39;s taken  Cameron under his <br/>
wing and shown him a few ropes. His newest buddy is Brian, a  25 year old <br/>
violinist (who is incredible). They talk about ALL sorts of things,  and Brian has <br/>
opened Cameron&#39;s eyes to many things other than music (Buddhism  and politics <br/>
and ----well, just TONS of things) because he&#39;s easy to talk  with and is <br/>
knowledgeable in many different areas. Brian is a  natural  unschooler who went to <br/>
school----he&#39;s a sponge that Cameron doesn&#39;t mind  squeezing every now & <br/>
then!  <br/>
 <br/>
Then there&#39;s magic with John Tudor and Jeff McBride (40&#39;s). And art  and film <br/>
with Christian Thee (late 50&#39;s/early 60&#39;s). Film with Morgan and  Stewart <br/>
(both in their 20&#39;s) at the movie house and Chris and Nick  (40&#39;s) at the Film <br/>
Commission in Charleston.<br/>
 <br/>
These people are mentors in fields that I have limited knowledge. I  couldn&#39;t <br/>
BEGIN to have all the answers to his questions! My job is to help  ferret <br/>
these folks out, make introductions, whatever. *He* does the rest. He&#39;s  gotten <br/>
pretty good at it too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The best you can do is to lead when you can, just keep up with them some  <br/>
days, follow along on others------and learn to enjoy the ride!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think you change your definition of &quot;right.&quot;<br/>
Each time you make a decision (and that&#39;s hundreds of times a day), give <br/>
yourself two choices and make the better choice.  If that worked out, next time <br/>
choose between that and something even better (newer, more imaginative, warmer, <br/>
more sparkly).  Gradually you will go from an unsure afraid position to a <br/>
spinning, twirling easy dance of unschooling.<br/>

difficulty answering some of JJ&#39;s 3 1/2 yo  questions?**<br/>
<br/>
Truthfully, the sooner a kid learns that mom can&#39;t answer everything, the <br/>
better, as far as succesful unschooling goes. As long as you can answer most <br/>
everything they ask, neither of you has much incentive to look farther afield. But <br/>
every time you can&#39;t answer, you have the opportunity to show them how people <br/>
go about finding things out, and how they decide what resources to use in <br/>
finding things out. Do you look on the internet, in a book on your shelves, in <br/>
the library, or maybe all three? Do you call a friend, a relative, a friendly <br/>
professor? And so on.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling (for me) has a goal, it&#39;s that my children learn how to find <br/>
out what they need to know. If I always know the answers to their questions, <br/>
what are they going to do when I&#39;m not around anymore?<br/>

<br/>
This is the best and biggest goal of all, and yet a constant criticism of <br/>
homeschooling is that the kids are limited to learning what their parents know.  <br/>
It&#39;s a lame criticism, for sure, but I keep hearing it.  I think it has to do <br/>
with teacher preparation, and the idea that the teacher or the teacher&#39;s <br/>
answer book will have all the information needed to present that set of material <br/>
(4th grade math, or whatever subset of the universe they&#39;ve contracted with the <br/>
state to &quot;cover&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Here we are, though, presenting to our children nothing at ALL like &quot;4th <br/>
grade math,&quot; and  so their questions and our responses could suddenly jump to <br/>
anything in the universe, past/present/future/imagined.  If a kid&#39;s math question <br/>
in school involved science fiction, the teacher could simply insult him or <br/>
tell him to wait until college to ask that question.  If his question involves <br/>
dinosaurs, she could say &quot;ask the science teacher.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I had a dollar for every time a teacher told me &quot;you don&#39;t need to know <br/>
that&quot; or &quot;that won&#39;t be on the test&quot; or &quot;they&#39;ll cover that next year,&quot; I could <br/>
get a new computer.  (And I really NEED a new computer.)<br/>
<br/>
So unschooling, in its nebulous unit-of-the-whole-wide-world thing, can <br/>
really only start to work when the mom is fully aware that 1) she doesn&#39;t know <br/>
everything, and 2) she doesn&#39;t need to.<br/>

True.<br/>
<br/>
And let me just add that teaching &quot;these are the complete set of right <br/>
answers&quot; is a terrible, terrible way to teach science.  In fact, it is <br/>
flat-out UNscientific.  (But schools do it.)  Learning by self-motivated <br/>

-----------<br/>
 <br/>
Just the other day on one of the four unschooling places I frequent (and if  <br/>
this was the child of someone here, feel free and encouraged NOT to fess up)  <br/>
someone was talking about a kid having written a report on the truth about  <br/>
global warming.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;THE&quot; truth about global warming!?<br/>
Huh.<br/>
 <br/>
There are theories, and there are fears, and there seem to be a lot of  <br/>
adults forgetting that they *KNOW* that the earth has one through many warming  and <br/>
cooling phases to the point of (people have evidence to believe) polar  <br/>
shifts, and yet just as sure as medieval people were that volcanos and  earthquakes <br/>
and eclipses were proof that God was unhappy with something they had  done, <br/>
there are people who track geological changes and say &quot;OH MY GOSH, WE DID  <br/>
THAT!!! EVERYONE CHANGE YOUR LIVES!!!!  RUN IN PANIC AND HATE YOUR FELLOW  MAN <br/>
NOW!!!!!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
If any parent has told a child that the truth about global warming is  <br/>
available, that parent is doing a disservice.<br/>

 <br/>
I remember the day school was basically &quot;over&quot; for me, for good and  forever. <br/>
 It was the day I realized, fully and to the core, that everything  I needed <br/>
to know, ever, was in a book somewhere or in someone&#39;s experience and I  had a <br/>
telephone if I needed it.  It took that realization several years to  get to <br/>
a full rolling boil, and I was in high school when it happened.  I  can <br/>
remember the sensations of sitting in a particular classroom, the lights,  the <br/>
smells, the sounds, and the *IDEA* just becoming a personal truth that I  could no <br/>
longer deny.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  On  occasion over the <br/>
years that moment has been brought to mind again by something  someone said on <br/>
these lists, and it just happened again when I read this.<br/>
 <br/>
I keep thinking I should go to college, but when I remember that day, I  <br/>
think, &quot;they couldn&#39;t pay me enough!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Just think, now I have GOOGLE!<br/>
