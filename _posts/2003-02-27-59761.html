&lt;&lt;   What then do we call the underlying philosophy that we trust our <br/>
children with the choice, (even if they want to go back to school)? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Respectful parenting?<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Respectful parenting?<br/>

it says so much when you think about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870013973">Here is a small sample of how it is looking with our 8yod.<br/>
<br/>
Finding some info on page 128.  She goes right to it.  <br/>
Remember all of those schooly exercises that seemed to go on for days about what comes before or after what.<br/>
<br/>
Reading the inside of a book, she spots the 5 number zipcode.  She then reads it correctly by place value... the ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens and ones.  Funny, how did she learn this without hours of  place value drills?<br/>
<br/>
Playing 5 Crowns and adding points...9 plus 7 are 16 (without a blink).  Thanks Sandra for the card game idea.  Any helpful hints?  She keeps trouncing me! <br/>
<br/>
Buying Magic cards.  These two cost $2 each and this one is $4.  That&#39;s $8 (again without a blink).<br/>
<br/>
Watching Cyperchase and doing the area multiplication before they give the answer (in a kind of &quot;duh&quot; slightly bored voice. Tee hee).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Look Ma!!  No work sheets!<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and my 11 yos loves to see if he can calculate the change at the drive through before we get it back.  And I learned that a zillion is not a number.<br/>
<br/>
Loving this stuff !<br/>

I guess just learn to lose gracefully.  That&#39;s what I did. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
