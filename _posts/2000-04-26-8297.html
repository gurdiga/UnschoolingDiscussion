<div id="ygrps-yiv-851024265">I dunno if anyone mentioned this (I didn&#39;t catch all the teeth<br/>
grinding posts), but the person could just need braces. I have a<br/>
friend who used to grind her teeth all her life (she&#39;s in her 30s),<br/>
and now that she&#39;s been wearing braces for a year, she no longer does.<br/>
