<div id="ygrps-yiv-22292269">LOL! How&#39;s this for a factoid! Star Hustler had to change it&#39;s name<br/>
because people were confusing it w/porno! I just found an article that<br/>
said that the show was getting submissions of nude photos, and that if<br/>
you didn&#39;t type in the web address correctly you got porn instead. So in<br/>
1997, the name was changed to Stargazer. Here&#39;s the link to the website<br/>
for anyone interested <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jackstargazer.com/.">http://www.jackstargazer.com/.</a> <br/>
<br/>
And yes, when I searched for &quot;Star Hustler&quot; I did get all sorts of porn<br/>
links . . . . .<br/>
