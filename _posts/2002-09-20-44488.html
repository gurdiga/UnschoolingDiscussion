&lt;&lt; Another question I have is feeding 4 curious minds at once... is it <br/>

I have four natural learners here. And yes, it can be a balancing act with <br/>
everyone&#39;s needs at stake, but I can&#39;t imagine anything better than <br/>
unschooling. No other lifestyle could possibly give this much joy, freedom <br/>
and fuel the fires of curiosity better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love the irony. Unschoolers worry that maybe they can&#39;t give four <br/>
children all that they need, but many others blindly accept that a <br/>
teacher can give 20-30 kids a sufficient education. The odds are <br/>
definitely in favor of the unschoolers.<br/>
