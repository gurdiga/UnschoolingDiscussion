<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493480145">Like I said before Pam, you certainly are entitled to not want your children around people who shout just as I&#39;m entitled not to want my children around narrow minded, judgmental people like yourself.  But the thing that both of us would have to realize is that both of those things are in the real world and it is our job to teach our children on how to deal with people different from ourselves......whether that difference be color, religion, or values.  I would much rather teach my child to deal with narrow minded people so they can better understand why they do the things they do then to completely shelter them only to have them later in life come up against someone like that and not know how to handle it.  I also think that some people out there are decent wonderful people even though they may have some kind of &quot;flaw&quot; in our own opinion and that we would miss out on that persons good qualities if we are bit to harsh in our judgment of their whole character based on one or two character traits.  I would like to think that even you have a good trait or two that you could be of good influence on my children just as I do.  In closing I&#39;d have to say that if I had to choose between someone narrow minded and judgmental or someone who shouts.........I&#39;d big the yeller any day!<br/>

&gt; imagination.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK. Rage is where you may be having a problem with<br/>
your imagining here. When we yell here, there is no<br/>
rage (there may be concern, upset, exasperation, etc.<br/>
- I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve *ever* been enraged at anyone, let<br/>
alone my family) - and yes the children are loud too -<br/>
as in &quot;But Mom...&quot; but loudly. The best analogy I&#39;ve<br/>
heard/read to help you imagine was the one someone<br/>
gave about the large Italian family. (Not that most<br/>
Italian families are loud - but they are sometimes<br/>
portrayed that way by the media. And we are not<br/>
Italian we are American mixed breeds.)  We are loud<br/>
whenever there is any emotion involved (so we&#39;re loud<br/>
*a lot*.) And if anyone thinks we&#39;re loud when we&#39;re<br/>
upset, they should hear us as we tell stories (about<br/>
our day, or that day trip we took last week, etc.) we<br/>
are all ear splittingly loud- and laugh until tears<br/>
roll down our cheeks (many things strike us as being<br/>
*very* funny.) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And of course I still know that my daughters, not<br/>
&gt; raised to any tolerance in<br/>
&gt; this way, are in no way prepared to deal with it and<br/>
&gt; it would be grossly<br/>
&gt; unfair to thrust them into that situation at their<br/>
&gt; ages. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I absolutely agree! (Although they may surprise you,<br/>
my dd have friend from all types of families, they all<br/>
love being here, never had one not want to come<br/>
back!)And by the way neighbors do hear us - but they<br/>
love us - really.  They think we&#39;re funny.  (We think<br/>
we&#39;re funny too.  Sometimes even in the heat of an<br/>
argument someone will say something *so* ridiculous<br/>
that it will end the argument, because we&#39;ll all be<br/>
laughing so hard - including the person who had tried<br/>
to make the statement in all seriousness a moment<br/>
before.)<br/>
<br/>
AND, I would still<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tell them that in my opinion any man, woman or child<br/>
&gt; who shouts at them in<br/>
&gt; anger more than once or twice &quot;in extremis&quot; (and had<br/>
&gt; better apologize<br/>
&gt; prettily and sincerely afterward, too)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would never raise my voice to a child who was not<br/>
mine - but I would around a child who was not mine (if<br/>
they were here.) My dd (really except Felicity, who is<br/>
not usually loud) are all *very* loud and I&#39;m sure<br/>
prone to shout in an argument.  Anyone who can&#39;t<br/>
accept this probably stays away from them in the first<br/>
place. They have *lots* of friends though - possibly<br/>
because they are prepared to accept most people for<br/>
what they are - completely without judgement. If it<br/>
doesn&#39;t affect them, they don&#39;t care. You&#39;d be<br/>
surprised at how many people react well to that.<br/>
<br/>
 is not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; someone they need to spend<br/>

&gt; feel that quite naturally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly. They should not spend time around people they<br/>
don&#39;t enjoy being around, and there is no need to be<br/>
judgmental about it.  You don&#39;t like being around<br/>
someone (for *whatever* the reason) don&#39;t be around<br/>
them. Simple. Live and let live.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe the difference is whether you&#39;re shouting at the kids, or to the<br/>
kids, or shouting to the world when the kids are around. My kid would<br/>
completely fall apart if I shouted at her, like, &quot;How could you do<br/>
XXXX????&quot;. She&#39;s just made that way, the overly sensitive to everything<br/>
kid. Not that I have never yelled at her, especially when life was really<br/>
hard for both of us, but I&#39;m not proud of it, and I do think it was<br/>
damaging. I have seen families, though, who tend to commmunicate with a<br/>
lot more volume than we do, and they all seem comfortable with it, so I<br/>
don&#39;t presume to judge.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, if Cacie is in the bedroom I can shout from the bedroom, &quot;Cacie!<br/>
Could you please give the dogs some water?&quot; and she&#39;s fine. I can also<br/>
shout, &quot;G- F-ing D- insurance company! Why can&#39;t they handle a simple<br/>
f-ing change of address!?!&quot; while Cacie plays playmobil in the same room,<br/>
and she definitely alerts to my mood and often steers clear, but she<br/>
understands that she&#39;s safe and it&#39;s not directed at her... although that<br/>
part took a while.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Like I said before Pam, you certainly are entitled to not want your<br/>
&gt; children around people who shout just as I&#39;m entitled not to want my<br/>
&gt; children around narrow minded, judgmental people like yourself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been awhile since anyone called me narrow-minded -- since I&#39;m always<br/>
being accused of being overly open-minded, it&#39;s kind of nice! &lt;g&gt; But I&#39;ll<br/>
try to take it in the spirit you intended and not get a swelled-but-narrow<br/>
head over it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But the<br/>
&gt; thing that both of us would have to realize is that both of those things<br/>

&gt; color, religion, or values.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is shouting a value?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my questions remain: is the shouting fully accepted as<br/>
reciprocal between parents and children? Do you all shout at other people<br/>
when you&#39;re angry at them, or just amongst yourselves?<br/>
<br/>
I truly am fascinated by this subject, it&#39;s not sarcasm when I say that I<br/>
*never* would have imagined that on this of all lists people would say that<br/>
they shout in anger at their children and don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s wrong (I can<br/>
understand shouting in anger and feeling dreadful about it and trying to<br/>
stop, but the idea that it&#39;s perfectly all right to do that with your own<br/>
family is honestly astounding to me. Seriously.)<br/>
<br/>
Pam, nevertheless pleased to find she can still be astounded.</div>

and don&#39;t know whether I was successful. We are not always a quiet family<br/>
&lt;g&gt; either, I just don&#39;t believe that yelling AT children because you are<br/>
angry is healthy -- for them or for you (generic you, not you Daron ;)<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Phil McGraw was once talking to a woman who said she &quot;couldn&#39;t control<br/>
herself&quot; when yelling at her step-daughter. Dr. Phil said, &quot;I&#39;ll bet you<br/>
control yourself from yelling at a Hell&#39;s Angel.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s what I was getting at with shouting at children: We adults do it<br/>
because we can. They&#39;re weaker and we need not fear reprisals. If a family<br/>
all really DO yell at each other, children at parents, too (&quot;Mom! How COULD<br/>
you step on my lego box! Can&#39;t you watch where you&#39;re putting your big<br/>
feet!? Be more careful! You make me crazy!&quot;), I&#39;d find it, umm, distracting<br/>
&lt;g&gt; for me, but at least fairer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i&#39;ve been reading all of these and i wondered from the beginning if it wasn&#39;t <br/>
a question of defining the yelling. i thought what you, pam, were saying was <br/>
that you wouldn&#39;t send your kids to a home where yelling at kids was the <br/>
norm. not in the yelling over a noise sense, but yelling to scare or bully or <br/>
otherwise exert parental &#39;power&#39; over children. i&#39;ve yelled at my son, but <br/>
i&#39;d rather not. he&#39;s yelled at me, too. but i&#39;ve been in homes where parents <br/>
are always yelling at and scolding their kids. yelling and screaming to be <br/>
precise, and the kids aren&#39;t allowed to communicate that way. if that&#39;s what <br/>
you&#39;re talking about, i agree.<br/>

<br/>
Good one!!<br/>
<br/>
I let my kids experess themselves strongly at me, so this isn&#39;t out of the <br/>
question:  &quot;Mom! How COULD you step on my lego box! Can&#39;t you watch where <br/>
you&#39;re putting your big<br/>
feet!? Be more careful! You make me crazy!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they get angry enough to be saying &quot;I&#39;m tired of ....&quot; or &quot;SOMEONE moved <br/>
my...&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t find my...&quot; I let them finish their tirade and if I did <br/>
the bad thing, I say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I did that.  It&#39;s in the den.&quot;   Or whatever <br/>
it is.  Sometimes I ask if they could try to ask nicer next time.  But <br/>
usually when someone comes to that point they are tired, hungry, sick or <br/>
pressed for time.  And since I expect them to keep their word and be punctual <br/>
AND I let them sleep late, sometimes I myself have contributed to the <br/>
situation.  So it&#39;s the same as if another adult friend of mine were freaking <br/>
out about not having the key or checkbook or receipt or phone number needed <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308237484">&lt;&lt;  I would much rather teach my child to deal with narrow minded people so <br/>
they can better understand why they do the things they do then to completely <br/>
shelter them only to have them later in life come up against someone like <br/>
that and not know how to handle it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To the extent of (stretching this a little more) sending them to hang out <br/>
with gangsters and robbers so they won&#39;t be surprised when they&#39;re older?  <br/>
That would be really open-minded.  Everybody has their limits.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I also think that some people out there are decent wonderful people even <br/>
though they may have some kind of &quot;flaw&quot; in our own opinion and that we would <br/>
miss out on that persons good qualities if we are bit to harsh in our <br/>
judgment of their whole character based on one or two character traits. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have some friends who are druggies and I&#39;m not sending my kids to stay with <br/>
them.  I knew some of their really good traits and talents, but until my kids <br/>
are older they don&#39;t need the exposure to unpredictable behavior and <br/>
illegality.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In closing I&#39;d have to say that if I had to choose between someone narrow <br/>
minded and judgmental or someone who shouts.........I&#39;d big the yeller any <br/>
day!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I could find someone with no other characteristics, habits or behaviors at <br/>
all except for being narrow minded or shouting, I might figure out how to <br/>
make such a choice.  People tend to have thousands of traits, and some people <br/>
are very sensitive in the areas of one or ten of them.  Some would not let <br/>
their kids hang out with bigots who used &quot;the N word.&quot;  Some would not want <br/>
them with dope smokers.  Some would avoid houses with poisonous snakes.   Pam <br/>
has a great aversion to peope who yell rudely to their children.  Why does <br/>
that make her worthy of public insult?   It was kind of an e-mail version of <br/>
yelling at her.  She took it pretty well!  But I&#39;m wondering why it was <br/>
offered.<br/>
<br/>
This seemed unwarranted:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Like I said before Pam, you certainly are entitled to not want your <br/>
children around people who shout just as I&#39;m entitled not to want my children <br/>
around narrow minded, judgmental people like yourself. -=- but  perhaps I <br/>
missed a post earlier on in which Pam offered a grave insult to anyone who <br/>
had ever yelled accidently, and questioned their parentage and threatened to <br/>
distance-train their dog to piss in their Wheaties.<br/>
<br/>
My husband grew up in a very quiet, yet very cold family.  I grew up in a <br/>
warmer, louder family.  At first, raised voices upset him.  It represented <br/>
fighting to him.  He got over some of that, and I got over some of the <br/>
loudness.<br/>

<br/>
Once I came in after I had asked kids to PLEASE just go to sleep, because <br/>
they weren&#39;t getting along so well and they were making too much noise, and <br/>
they weren&#39;t asleep.  I wasn&#39;t LOUD, but I was mostly enraged, and said if <br/>

<br/>
Well they didn&#39;t want THAT, and they did, truly, feel bad that they had woken <br/>
me up a third time, and they were good guys, just young (12ish).  At that <br/>
point I was grumpy enough that if they had said &quot;You yelled at me, I shall <br/>
never revisit your home, I&#39;d&#39;ve said &quot;fine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These are kids whose parents don&#39;t reciprocate (which is fine), and who are <br/>
here A Lot.  They hardly qualify as company after a  couple of years.<br/>

I am saying that if a mom says she would prefer not to have her young <br/>
children visit in a home in which the parents yell at their children (not <br/>
&quot;HEY, come eat ice cream!&quot; but &quot;YOU IDIOT!&quot; and I thought that was clear from <br/>
the beginning), that if another person says kids need to be exposed to other <br/>
families&#39; practices, that if &quot;other families&#39; practices&quot; goes from kind of <br/>
yelling to blatant sexual abuse or crack-house-management, I think EVERY <br/>
mother will draw her own line somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Pam is being overly criticized for drawing hers at parents who yell.<br/>
<br/>
Why is that line bad, but other lines are good?<br/>
<br/>
If no lines are bad, and kids should be exposed to other lifestyles, should I <br/>
send my kids to do volunteer work at the crack house now so they&#39;ll not be <br/>
surprised when they come across it later in life?<br/>
<br/>
From Pam&#39;s quiet-family point of view, abusive-in-face yelling is a bad <br/>
thing.  It seems (perhaps I am wrong) that people here are justifying <br/>
yelling, but they&#39;re not talking about marine-drill-sergeant yelling.  If so, <br/>
the argument is missing its point and the insults on Pam are unwarranted <br/>
(something else I&#39;ve been saying).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241569213">Pam, I don&#39;t think you are understanding what we are saying. My children<br/>
often shout and ar loud, but it is not in anger most of the time. One son<br/>
just gets louder when he is excited about something. There is often so much<br/>
activity going on, we often shout to one another from one end of the house<br/>
to the other. We are rowdy, but not angry and violent. My grandmother was<br/>
very English, quiet and reserved. Never showed any emotion. When I met my<br/>
husband&#39;s family I was struck by the difference. It was often loud, but I<br/>
always felt accepted and loved, not wondering if anyone cared. Somehow you<br/>
are aquating shouting with anger and this is not the case.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So let me be sure I&#39;m clear here -- the shouting parents here are<br/>
perfectly<br/>
&gt; happy if their children shout right back at them if they, the parents, do<br/>
&gt; something the kids get angry about? Or is it only okay for the parents to<br/>
&gt; shout at the children for misdeeds? And does the whole family shout in<br/>
anger<br/>
&gt; at everyone they meet (when, of course, they get angry with these<br/>
people) --<br/>
&gt; neighbors, friends, the local pharmacist, when angry at THEM, too? Or do<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; kids learn that this shouting at each other when angry is only for the<br/>
bosom<br/>
&gt; of the family?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a hard time envisioning a whole family shouting at each other (and<br/>
&gt; perhaps everyone else, perhaps not), in rage, and everyone being just fine<br/>
&gt; with that. But, sometimes I suffer from a lack of imagination.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And of course I still know that my daughters, not raised to any tolerance<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; this way, are in no way prepared to deal with it and it would be grossly<br/>
&gt; unfair to thrust them into that situation at their ages. AND, I would<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; tell them that in my opinion any man, woman or child who shouts at them in<br/>
&gt; anger more than once or twice &quot;in extremis&quot; (and had better apologize<br/>
&gt; prettily and sincerely afterward, too) is not someone they need to spend<br/>
&gt; time around, but I&#39;m comfortably sure they would feel that quite<br/>
naturally.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I agree here.  (But I do doubt the way our family<br/>
behaves would adversely effect her daughters. As I<br/>
said, we&#39;ve never had a child not want to come back. <br/>
We are loud always - but it does not involve<br/>
disagreements very often - and I don&#39;t do name<br/>
calling.  We say what you would probably say - but we<br/>
say it real loud, you could definately call it<br/>
yelling.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think EVERY <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mother will draw her own line somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Every mother will draw that line somewhere, just<br/>
as every mother will draw some line on autonomy and<br/>
should be free to choose that line.  I suppose that<br/>
line being drawn at yelling has caused some of us<br/>
yellers to consider her &#39;judgemental&#39; because she<br/>
obviously has judged families who yell to be somehow<br/>
inappropriate. But I do see your point. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why is that line bad, but other lines are good?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps because other lines may be more reasonable. <br/>
It really is like my saying &#39;I don&#39;t want to expose my<br/>
children to you because they may be adversely effected<br/>
by a judgemental person.&#39; Or &#39;I don&#39;t want them around<br/>
you because you sometimes drink a glass of wine and we<br/>
are non-drinkers.&#39;<br/>

is. If I (and my dd) say what you (and your dd) say -<br/>
but we say it *loudly* and with great animation: is<br/>
that abusive - in your opinion?  <br/>
<br/>
It seems (perhaps I am wrong) that people<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; here are justifying <br/>
&gt; yelling, but they&#39;re not talking about<br/>
&gt; marine-drill-sergeant yelling.  If so, <br/>

&gt; Pam are unwarranted <br/>
&gt; (something else I&#39;ve been saying).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But I do think Pam is saying the above example is<br/>
abusive - and is therefore saying the loud among us<br/>
are abusive. Not nice.<br/>
