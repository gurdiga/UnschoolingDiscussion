various self-improvement techniques constantly, mainly creative<br/>
visualization and positive autosuggestion, to counter it and ensure<br/>
that my intentions were the dominant influence on my thoughts and<br/>
actions not memories or voices from the past. That&#39;s still my daily<br/>
practice (and something of a soapbox topic for me, which I won&#39;t go<br/>
into here). -=-<br/>

Bob, I don&#39;t mind if you go into it here.  I kinda wish you would.   <br/>
If you don&#39;t want to, is there a link to something you&#39;ve already  <br/>
written?<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve been telling people a little more directly that if  <br/>
they&#39;re not up to being patient or creative or happy with their kids,  <br/>
they might want to go to a counsellor and get themselves in a good  <br/>
space to parent better.<br/>

And there&#39;s the daily readings from the Alanon literature....<br/>
<br/>
A BIG one for me was letting go of how &#39;things are supposed to <br/>
be&#39;...which frees me to live in unlimited possibilities...   <br/>
AND parenting for the here and now.... NOT bec. I want some outcome <br/>
in the future (i.e., &#39;if I allow my kids free access to the tv then <br/>
they won&#39;t obsess about it later&#39;.... my kids have free access to the <br/>
tv, period, bec. it is the way we do things around here now....)<br/>
<br/>
Sam Wilkinson and his family camped with my family as part of a big <br/>
yearly community trip.... his death led to the loss of my desire <br/>
to &#39;prepare my kids for college, career, etc etc etc&#39;.... He had a <br/>
lot of life in him and I remember feeling jealous of the enthusiasm <br/>
and zest I saw in him and his family...   I wanted that for my <br/>
family... so... letting go...letting go...enjoy...enjoy...<br/>

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Mine, I think, mostly came from my mom. As I read messages and explore<br/>
ideas, thoughts, and reactions as well as the past I find that my mom did<br/>
some very &quot;unschooly&quot; things with me. Now, I actually went to school, but I<br/>
didn&#39;t have a bedtime, I didn&#39;t have a curfew, I was allowed to swear in<br/>
front of them, they let me smoke (which I is the reason that I think I<br/>
*don&#39;t* smoke now), and they &quot;let me&quot; date a 24 year old when I was 17 (a<br/>
very good thing since 10 years later we are still together and have 2<br/>
beautiful daughters).<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I did go to mainstream parenting at first. I wasn&#39;t<br/>
involved with LLL or much of any of that type of support. My main support<br/>
when I had my oldest (I was 19 and not ready to parent) was my grandma, who<br/>
had very &quot;old fashioned&quot; parenting ideals. It wasn&#39;t until I had my<br/>
youngest, 4 years ago, that I started questioning mainstream and I did so<br/>
because mainstream ways didn&#39;t work with her. I had to come up with more<br/>
creative better ways, but still slipped back into mainstream often.<br/>
<br/>
I found unschooling about 4 years ago. I got on the boards and realized that<br/>
&quot;I could *never* let my kids...&quot; fill in the blank. Well, about a year ago<br/>
my best friend (of 24 years, and I am only 27 today) had a preemie baby<br/>
after trying for quite a few years to get pregnant and the baby died 18 days<br/>
later. That flipped my world upside down and I questioned everything.<br/>
Including my parenting. We began saying &quot;yes&quot; more and more. By August we<br/>
were well on the path to &quot;radical&quot; unschoolers (for lack of a better term).<br/>
I think we are all better for it.<br/>
<br/>
So, it was a series of things that let to my parenting today (as it usually<br/>
is) including my mom (who dabbled in unschooly ways in her parenting), Lilly<br/>
(my youngest who challenged the mainstream ways), and Isaac (who was just<br/>
one of those miracles who come, but don&#39;t stay for long).<br/>

<br/>
I was spanked. My father shamed my mother. My mother shamed me. My <br/>
father told me I walked on water.<br/>
<br/>
I was the honor student who was supposed to be a veterinarian. I didn&#39;t <br/>
finish college. Although I know *nothing* I do could disappoint my <br/>
father, I&#39;m sure he wishes I got at LEAST a bachelor&#39;s. Education <br/>
is/was always very, very important to him. Unschooling is tough for him <br/>
to accept, but he says that he&#39;s sure I would never do anything to harm <br/>
my children AND he knows that I&#39;m smart enough to handle their <br/>
education. Still...<br/>
<br/>
For me, knowing that my father believed in me no matter what is HUGE. <br/>
And his understanding that *passion* fuels learning---no matter what <br/>
the passion is.<br/>
<br/>
The second thing, without a doubt, is unschooling and mindful <br/>
parenting. *Thinking* before I do anything. Which, I think, is <br/>
something I&#39;ve always done---just not so mindFULLY, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Having the boys at home all the time and not *away* for half the day <br/>
has been helpful &#39;cause I&#39;ve learned to &quot;keep it constant&quot; and not let <br/>
things go and then grasp frantically when we all get together. It&#39;s <br/>
more of a *flow* and a *in* and *out*.<br/>
<br/>
Writing about it has been big too. I *could* just *think* it. &lt;g&gt; But <br/>
putting it on (virtual) paper has been so helpful. ---I mean, even If I <br/>
don&#39;t hit &quot;send&quot; now, I&#39;d still get some benefit of having hashed it <br/>
out in my head and thought clearly enough to write it down. <br/>
Clarity---that&#39;s what&#39;s helped. And writing aids clarity for me.<br/>
<br/>
And knowing that &quot;improvement&quot; has no end. &lt;G&gt; Even if I&#39;m &quot;improved,&quot; <br/>
I can still be ...*more*...improved. &lt;G&gt; It doesn&#39;t end. I *can* be/do <br/>
better.<br/>

<br/>
.         I became a Christian when I was 15 and about to do away with<br/>
myself. The positive, life-affirming philosophy of Christianity has made all<br/>
the difference to me. My biggest problem was that I had lost hope;<br/>
relationship with God gave it back.<br/>
<br/>
.         But I was still a pretty messed up person. Facing the realities of<br/>
what growing up in my family was like was part of it - acknowledging the<br/>
hatred and anger I had hidden deep down inside, owning it, feeling it, and<br/>
then letting it go; forgiving my parents, and finally coming to a place of<br/>
blessing them even though I no longer have relationship with either of them.<br/>
This was a long and extended process and I don&#39;t think I would have had the<br/>
courage to do it if I hadn&#39;t known Jesus. Truly, He has been my greatest<br/>
Friend.<br/>
<br/>
.         I love to read - used to use it as a way of escaping my life when<br/>
I was young. I enjoy discovering and thinking about insights and ideas. Lots<br/>
and lots of books have been helpful. In parenting, the greatest and most<br/>
meaningful influences have been John Holt, Charlotte Mason, and Sandra<br/>
Dodd&#39;s emails J<br/>
<br/>
.         By some miracle, I managed to marry an amazing man - even though<br/>
statistics seem to say that the odds were stacked against me and that many<br/>
people with my background end up marrying abusive husbands. He has always<br/>
known that children are people, and even before we had any, he set the stage<br/>
for us to treat children differently. He remains my greatest support,<br/>
encourager, challenger, fellow thinker and adventurer. He loves me, I trust<br/>
him, and thus he is a very dependable mirror that I use to check up on my<br/>
behaviour, thinking and attitudes. <br/>

I was an abused child and then became the abuser of my own children.<br/>
That is a very hard thing to admit...especially when at the time that I <br/>
was being abused and doing the abusing,I didn&#39;t recognise it as abuse.<br/>
I am 51 yrs old,and it was becoming a grandmother and helping my dd <br/>
raise her child that is highly sensitive,that I stumbled accross 2 <br/>
things in the same day on the internet:unschooling and &quot;the unprocessed <br/>
child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter.I joined the radical unschooling list <br/>
that day and ordered the book that day.It was just a month  before the <br/>
live and learn conference was in Peabody Massachusettes.I live in <br/>
Alabama.I went by car with my daughter-in-law and 4 grandsons.I met <br/>
Anne Ohman and Valerie Fitzenreiter there and many other wonderful <br/>
people there.This is what did it for me.</div>

 </span></blockquote>My bizarre childhood is well documented ;) School (beginning at age 2) saved<br/>
me from parents who were told always they were worthless, so why would their<br/>
offspring have value?<br/>
We didn&#39;t have money, we didn&#39;t have food and we didn&#39;t have a familial<br/>
sense of &quot;it&#39;s all good&quot; -- I was really, really young when I realized I was<br/>
smarter then they and I remember thinking, often, &quot;well, that doesn&#39;t make<br/>
*any* sense!!&quot; I couldn&#39;t figure them out, it was like I had an expressed<br/>
gene that no one else had... I felt, quite literally, like the red-headed<br/>
step-child of lore, &#39;cept I was punished for being *good* and *smart* and<br/>
*responsible* and all those other things I learned were important at school,<br/>
but didn&#39;t make any sense in my Real World. By 13, I was spending most of my<br/>
time at an aunt&#39;s house, by 15 I was officially moved out of their home.<br/>
The turn of the corner, the on-ramp to a different highway *system*<br/>
(including some off-road touring) than my family&#39;s, came when I was 18 and<br/>
had my first serious boyfriend. Big Joe&#39;s sense of humor was a Living Virus<br/>
I&#39;m glad to have been infected with!! He would *see* my childhood tales as a<br/>
film reel and laugh and laugh and laugh, sometimes until he cried... at<br/>
first it &quot;hurt my feelings&quot;... then he gently took me my the hand, led me<br/>
over to his perspective and we *watched* those stories again -- OMG They&#39;re<br/>
SO funny!! -- and right there, I began my journey of &quot;Don&#39;t take it<br/>
personally&quot;  and the development of my personal mantra, &quot;there&#39;s always room<br/>
for humor.&quot;<br/>
This lead to The Forum (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.landmarkeducation.com/landmark_forum.jsp)">http://www.landmarkeducation.com/landmark_forum.jsp)</a>,<br/>
which I cannot recommend enough. It is now formatted for three days and an<br/>
evening of Ass Kicking; when I did it, it was TWO consecutive weekends and<br/>
an evening of Serious Bullshit Take Down! Joe was fond of calling his/their<br/>
technique &quot;Grabbing the Gold and shaking off the Shit&quot; (which I think is<br/>
quite similar to Sandra&#39;s technique). I was part of this<br/>
organization/movement for many years. In the years since, I&#39;m reminded of<br/>
this work in the writings of Wayne Dyer, Barbara Sher and most recently<br/>
Byron Katie, Don Miguel Ruiz.<br/>
It was impossible to have this much of Life&#39;s Shit shaken off of me NOT to<br/>
uncover my God wounds and heal them too. Here&#39;s a list of some favorite<br/>
stories/perspective shifters: Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ&#39;s<br/>
Childhood Pal; The Moon Under Her Feet -Clysta Kinster; Conversations with<br/>
God - the whole series! The Journey Home - Kryon<br/>
My parents? They&#39;re cool. They&#39;ve been amazing grandparents to my kids :)<br/>
They&#39;re still married, they still *really* love each other, and I think<br/>
they&#39;re proof we never do stop learning and growing and getting better at<br/>
this whole schitck-as-a-human :)<br/>

<h4>Katy at 2008-03-09 02:12:12 +0200 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487595820">I had a hard time deciding exactly where my self-improvement techniques came from.  Many came from Sandra and Pam and Joyce and others at the old Unschooling.com boards, then their websites and email lists.  But I decided long before that that I didn&#39;t want to be the same kind of parent that my mom was.  I just didn&#39;t quite know how to do it!  <br/>
<br/>
I always heard growing up that I was not living up to my potential.  I still hate that word, potential.  I got bad grades because it was just expected that I would get good ones, because I could.  My best friend in school had to work at school, she studied, did her homework, and still struggled.  I could ditch classes, not do any homework, and still do well on the tests.  I didn&#39;t want to stand out among my friends by doing well. I still sometimes hear that I have disappointed people by staying in little old Alamogordo and focusing on my son instead of becoming a doctor or something.  It used to really bother me, now it mostly bothers me if my son hears it, because I don&#39;t want him to worry that I feel like I settled.  I DON&#39;T feel that way at all, and I have talked with Richard (12) a little bit about that.  <br/>
<br/>
Because of my experience in school, I thought that I would homeschool from the beginning.  I also thought that I would not use one of the typical curriculum types that I had seen, mostly because they seemed 1. just like school, and 2. religious.  I do not remember how I stumbled across the old unschooling.com boards, I tend to have little lapses in memory when it comes to things like that.  I may have smoked too much pot as a teenager.  :-&#92;    I am glad that I did though, I don&#39;t think I would have used a set curriculum, but I was a no-gun, no-violent game type of mom before I found unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I read lots about attachment parenting when I was pregnant, and tried to be the best attachment-type parent that I could be, within the limitations of being a single parent and working.  Most of what I read came from the internet.  I wish that I had attended La Leche meetings, I was too afraid of groups of people to try them out.  I read whatever I could from them though.  <br/>
<br/>
I think my parenting beliefs began after an incident while I was in high school.  I had a friend spending the night, and in the middle of the night my dog chewed up something that I loved, a stuffed animal.  I was furious, and I spanked her.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it, my mom and dad spanked, both me and the dogs, that was normal!  Well my friend told me that I should NEVER have kids, because I was too heavy handed. I spanked too hard.  I have never gotten that out of my head, I spanked too hard.  So it is ok to spank, but not too hard?  I did spank Richard twice when he was little, but I felt horrible afterwards, and I kept going back to what she said.  I decided that I would never spank again, any living thing.   <br/>
<br/>
I really didn&#39;t find lots of information out there that shaped me in a positive way, mostly I read things that I didn&#39;t agree with (before finding unschooling).  That was helpful though, it helped me to know how I didn&#39;t want to be.  I read lots on homeschooling and parenting boards, and argued with the more conservative parents.  I am so thankful for the people who volunteer their time on the unschooling websites, email lists, boards, etc.  Now it is easier to find information about how I DO want to be.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to mention that my mom has turned into a wonderful grandmother.  She inspects child-care homes and centers, and tries to help them to be more unschooly, kind of!  I am glad that she is has become an awesome grandma for my son and nieces.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514374802">I started reading self-improvement/self-help literature in my late 20s<br/>
because I had a life that clearly needed straightening out. I was a<br/>
drunk in those days and flitting from job to job with plenty of<br/>
unemployment in between, and generally despondent that I was failing<br/>
my wife, the person who had saved me from total disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Then our daughter was born and, when she was about six months old, my<br/>
wife returned to her career and I became the at home parent by<br/>
default. I had already decided by then that I would raise my daughter<br/>
according to the new ideas that had been making such a positive<br/>
difference in *my* life.<br/>
<br/>
There were four books that were particularly influential in my early<br/>
years as a stay-at-home dad:<br/>
<br/>
Wallace D. Wattles&#39; Financial Success Through the Power of Creative<br/>
Thought (better known these days as The Science of Getting Rich)<br/>
<br/>
Will Schultz&#39;s Profound Simplicity<br/>
<br/>
Maxwell Maltz&#39;s Psycho-Cybernetics<br/>
<br/>
Edward de Bono&#39;s The Mechanism of Mind<br/>
<br/>
Not the kind of books a new parent would usually think of to turn to<br/>
for advice. :)<br/>
<br/>
As it turned out, I&#39;ve always found it very difficult to explain<br/>
these books and their ideas in a parenting context. Even to the mother<br/>
of my children. She&#39;s never actually read any of them herself.<br/>
Self-improvement - or personal development, as I more usually call it<br/>
these days - is my weird hobby as far as she&#39;s concerned! My belief is<br/>
that it should be part of everybody&#39;s daily life. That&#39;s why it&#39;s my<br/>
soapbox topic. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there are problems with all of the books that my parenting<br/>
philosophy is based on. Wallace D. Wattles&#39; book is a &#39;New Thought&#39;<br/>
treatise written in 1910 that&#39;s based on some highly debatable<br/>
metaphysics, so I don&#39;t talk about that ever now. Besides which, I&#39;m<br/>
not a financial success (at the moment at least), so, even though I<br/>
translated the book&#39;s ideas into parenting success, I can&#39;t claim that<br/>
they &#39;work&#39;. Profound Simplicity is written in a New Age context and<br/>
I&#39;m not New Age at all. The Mechanism of Mind, in contrast, is so feet<br/>
on the ground it reads like a school text book. Very dull unless<br/>
you&#39;re truly fascinated by the subject matter. Probably<br/>
Psycho-Cybernetics is the most useful of the books overall.<br/>
Because it was written in 1960, parts of it are very dated, but the<br/>
subject matter of &quot;self-image psychology&quot; gives it its importance. For<br/>
me, our self-image is the key. <br/>
<br/>
Last year, I did try to extract the essential ideas from these books<br/>
and create something of my own and I came up with an e-book called How<br/>
I Parent. It&#39;s very short - 30 pages - that&#39;s how little I have to say<br/>
on the subject! I&#39;d be happy to send you a copy if you&#39;re interested<br/>
in reading it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126189902">Hi, I&#39;m Tracy a self-improvement junkie...&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to figure out how to say what I want without going way <br/>
too long :-) I grew up in a looks good on the outside, was not so <br/>
pretty on the inside home. My first memory of me *knowing* what I <br/>
wanted to be when I grew up was in about the 8th grade...I told my <br/>
Dad that I wanted to go to Cornell and study Law, he said &quot;you <br/>
aren&#39;t smart enough&quot; I wanted to fight for justice...I knew what I <br/>
was experiencing wasn&#39;t fair!  So yes...shame, abuse, alcoholism and <br/>
just plain stupidity wrapped up in a pretty socially acceptable <br/>
wrapper is the way I grew up. <br/>
<br/>
One of my quiet soap boxes is alcoholism, I think it is one of the <br/>
profound problems in society today. So often overlooked, the damage <br/>
it is doing to not only families and children, but every aspect of <br/>
our culture. <br/>
<br/>
So, the question was...how&#39;d I get here from there...well I too LOVE <br/>
to read. The library is like my favorite place :-) Not novels...self-<br/>
help, parenting, spirituality, gardening...just to name a few. I <br/>
started reading all kinds of spirituality type books geez over 20 <br/>
years ago...it&#39;s funny I have read some of them again lately, then <br/>
remembering...I read this when I lived in San Fran or Colorado...I <br/>
used to move alot, that was another part of my self discovery...<br/>
<br/>
No matter where you go...you&#39;re always there ;-) when I realized a <br/>
new place wasn&#39;t gonna fix what was wrong inside of me...it was off <br/>
to therapy! That to proved to be a journey...lots of wackos out <br/>
there if ya know what I mean. Yes, most of them helped me, and even <br/>
if they didn&#39;t I learned from the experience. I&#39;m going out on a <br/>
limb here....but I pretty much think therapy should be a requirement <br/>
for this school we call life. <br/>
<br/>
Good friends who have their shit together are another really big <br/>
part of my journey. These groups have been very helpful/healing, <br/>
it&#39;s just not my favorite forum to listen and share. Reading and <br/>
typing on the computer are not my favorite things. I&#39;m a <br/>
talker...not a typer. I also like to hear,see,feel what the other <br/>
people are saying, which can get lost in translation online IMHO. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really late and I have about 3 new books I was gonna look at <br/>
before bed...guess I need to go self-improve. I like to read <br/>
something kind of &quot;meaty&quot; right before sleep...I think it sinks in <br/>
over night...my brain is like chicken...it needs to marinade ;-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My parenting journey was focussed on my mother, from long before I had  <br/>
children. After I had children, that waned a bit. As Wyl approached &quot;school  age&quot;, <br/>
I found a lot of tension in the relationship between Dave and I, Wyl and  both <br/>
my parents-and that increased as Wyl&#39;s age did. Before long, my entire  <br/>
parenting &quot;being&quot; had some aspect of my mother in it-my focus was so on &quot;not  being <br/>
a mother like she was&quot; that she overshadowed so many areas... From my  <br/>
delving into things on the unschooling groups, asking some general questions on  <br/>
them and finding a couple excellent mentors, I finally was able to see  this. <br/>
After taking a long break from having any contact with my parents, I was  able to <br/>
refocus. With reading messages *daily* on 2 or 3 unschooling groups and  some <br/>
wonderful advice and guidance from my mentors, I was able to find the  parent <br/>
that I want to be, the parent that I *am*, completely unrelated to who my  <br/>
mother was as a parent. It was, again, a struggle in perceptions, but a struggle <br/>
 SO worth it. I&#39;ve bought stacks of books recommended by unschoolers I trust <br/>
and  yet... I just don&#39;t have time to read them! Writing somehow seems to help <br/>
me  think more clearly as well, so my blog has really helped in that area.<br/>
 <br/>
Listening in (and sometimes asking questions) at the discussion  groups, my <br/>
blog, and thoughtful, direct help from my mentors has helped me  immensely, but <br/>
more importantly, it has helped my spouse and my children  immeasurably.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<h4>Hallie at 2008-03-09 20:02:54 +0200 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857621284">Hi, Sandra and everyone,<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve been lurking for a while and would like to introduce myself briefly before getting to the self-improvement subject and listing practices and readings that have helped me.<br/>
   <br/>
  We are Hallie (me, 44 y/o), Jeff (dh, 49 y/o) and Adin (ds, newly-6 y/o).  We have been unschoolers for almost all of Adin&#39;s life (when he was 3 y/o, we sent Adin to a twice-a- week &quot;preschool,&quot; which we finally pulled him out of totally by February of that year). <br/>
   <br/>
  All three of us tend to be sensitive, anxious people, although there are many other adjectives that also apply!  Jeff and I both carry quite a bit of baggage from our childhoods in families who misunderstood us and from cruelty we each suffered in school.  I&#39;ve also become convinced that simply living unmindfully in this world creates lots of anxiety/depression/anger for which no person or event is to blame.<br/>
   <br/>
  The first beneficial thing I did for myself and my family was to retire from a highly stressful job as an attorney.  My son&#39;s birth led me to this decision, and I&#39;ll be grateful to him forever for this.  I would probably never have been able to work on self-improvement if he hadn&#39;t arrived in our lives. For me, self-improvement boils down to being present and mindful.  Every day, I fall short sometimes of being mindful and present.  There are times when I probably appear not to have improved at all.  The difference is that I&#39;m now aware of a healthier path that I can always return to!<br/>
   <br/>
  So, to get to the subject of the post:<br/>
   <br/>
  Psychotherapy, meditation & literature (all sorts) are what I use for self-improvement.  If I only have time or energy for one of these practices, I always turn to literature.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Psychotherapy:  Cognitive psychotherapy worked best for me, because it helped me recognize and begin to change very old thought patterns that were no longer useful to me.  Another good thing for me about this form of therapy is that it does not require years on the analyst&#39;s couch.  When I gained some insight into my thought processes (and some insight into how to gain further insight, etc.) this was work I could do on my own with infrequent &quot;tune-ups&quot; with the therapist.<br/>
   <br/>
  Meditation:  Zen meditation has been great for me.  My teacher focuses on breathing awareness, but I think any form of meditation when practiced daily even for a few minutes, can have miraculous effects.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Literature (including groups like this one) has been my most important tool.  Here are a few of my biggies:<br/>
   <br/>
  (1)  The AA Big Book.  NOT FOR ALCOHOLICS ONLY!!!  The Big Book is the best self-improvement book ever written, in my opinion.  It feels divinely inspired to me, and I think it can benefit anyone in any situation.  <br/>
   <br/>
  (2)  Radical Acceptance, by Tara Brach<br/>
   <br/>
  (3) Mindful Parenting, by Myla & Jon Kabat-Zinn<br/>
   <br/>
  (4) The Breathing Book, by Donna Farhi<br/>
   <br/>
  (5) &quot;Growing Without Schooling,&quot; John Holt&#39;s newsletter.  I bought some back issues and received others from angelic unschoolers who did not need for them anymore.<br/>
   <br/>
  (6) Non-Violent Communication, by Marshall Rosenberg<br/>
   <br/>
  (7) Learning All the Time, by John Holt<br/>
   <br/>
  (8) How Children Fail, by John Holt<br/>
   <br/>
  (9) Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, by Barbara Kingsolver<br/>
   <br/>
  (10) This list, which I found only recently.<br/>
   <br/>
  (11)  Anne Ohman&#39;s &quot;Shine With Unschooling&quot; list<br/>
   <br/>
  (12) The Highly Sensitive Child & The Highly Sensitive Person, by Elaine Aron<br/>
   <br/>
  (13) The Explosive Child, by Ross Greene<br/>
   <br/>
  (14)  A Course in Miracles.  It is written in Christian terminology, and I am not a Christian, but I have benefited from it.  I like the daily exercises.  Someone told me the other day that Oprah was recently touting ACIM, so it may become famous soon!<br/>
   <br/>
  (15)  Anything by Pema Chodron<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ll stop the list there before this post gets too long!  Anyway, I keep all of these materials handy and just &quot;baste&quot; in them when I need rejuvenation.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you, Sandra, for opening up this topic.  I&#39;ve been quite stressed and mindless lately, and thinking this through has helped me slow down and remember that the better path always awaits me!<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000675661">-=-Thank you, Sandra, for opening up this topic. I&#39;ve been quite  <br/>
stressed and mindless lately, and thinking this through has helped me  <br/>
slow down and remember that the better path always awaits me!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad so many ideas are coming up.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are afraid you&#39;ll  need to embark on some long quest  <br/>
for mental health, I want to remind you that it happens in moments,  <br/>
not in years, and this moment is better than a later one.<br/>
<br/>
Regular meditation is great, but it&#39;s not that or nothing.  Learn to  <br/>
calm  yourself with deep breaths wherever you are:  car, bathroom,  <br/>
walking to the store.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re choosing music or movies, choose the uplifting or happy  <br/>
ones over the shoot-em-up-death ones when  you&#39;re stressed or on the  <br/>
edge of depression.  If it has to be Jim Carey, watch The Truman Show  <br/>
instead of The Cable Guy.   If you&#39;re totally in the mood for Robin  <br/>
Williams, watch Hook or Mrs. Doubtfire instead of One Hour Photo.<br/>
<br/>
There are times to watch sad  or scary movies (or sad music, or  <br/>
depressing books) but if you do it all the time, when will you  <br/>
recharge and rise up?<br/>
<br/>
Comfort food can be good.  If you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed, what is it  <br/>
that has good memories or associations for you?  Instant pudding?   <br/>
Mashed potatoes?  Macaroni and Cheese?   Figure out what kinds of  <br/>
things make you feel better.  Think of all y our senses and provide  <br/>
yourself with what tastes, looks, feels, smells and sounds soothing  <br/>
(at  least one or two of the list).<br/>
<br/>
Then learn to do that for your kids, too!!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086446737">I&#39;ll spare the gory details of my childhood...  <br/>
<br/>
You know those famous words that every teenager says?  &quot;I&#39;m never<br/>
going to that to MY kids!!!&quot;  Well, I held on to those words.  I still<br/>
never let them go.  I truly understood as a teenager, that adulthood<br/>
did not have to be this way.  I was thrown in psychiatrists enough<br/>
times to start to understand the field.  That children do not have to<br/>
be like their parents, that I could break the cycle.  Self-Improvement<br/>
has always been a priority for me.  But it&#39;s more mental/emotional for<br/>
me than anything else.  I had to find ways of breaking free from guilt<br/>
and shame that still creeps up my spine once in awhile.  It took years<br/>
and years after high school, to finally realize that I was important.<br/>
 I really had no idea that I was.  <br/>
<br/>
When I worked for the Boys and Girls Club for awhile, I remember<br/>
telling teenagers that they WERE important.  That they DID matter.  I<br/>
was so surprised by how many children, believed they didn&#39;t matter<br/>
because they were &quot;only kids&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and peaceful parenting has been the one thing that I<br/>
believe helped me the most.  I&#39;ve done a lot to try and loosen the<br/>
grip my childhood has had on me, but I never felt more free from it<br/>
until I became the parent I always wanted.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
What a good description of how it feels for the biochemicals related  <br/>
with shame to come upon a person.  And it IS a biochemical thing.   <br/>
It&#39;s a feeling of being unacceptable to the rest of the group, and  <br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s an adaptive thing in natural primate situations, but  <br/>
it&#39;s certainly used in crippling doses in this culture!<br/>
<br/>
-=- It took years and years after high school, to finally realize  <br/>
that I was important.  I really had no idea that I was. -=-<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago Holly started reading &quot;Moving a Puddle.&quot;  She  <br/>
marked a passage in there, and said she hadn&#39;t known that about me.   <br/>
It was this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe I thought that if you were good in school, you could grow up  <br/>
and become a real adult with job. And if you were good in New Mexico,  <br/>
you could grow up and move to a more real place. But somehow I had  <br/>
the idea that &quot;real&quot; was elsewhere. And &quot;important&quot; was not me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s 1/3 the way down an article called &quot;How Holly Takes the World  <br/>
for Granted&quot;<br/>

-=-Unschooling and peaceful parenting has been the one thing that I<br/>
believe helped me the most. I&#39;ve done a lot to try and loosen the<br/>
grip my childhood has had on me, but I never felt more free from it<br/>
until I became the parent I always wanted. :-)  -=-<br/>
That&#39;s really good, Heather!  Some people say &quot;become the parent you  <br/>
want to be&quot; but I bet they often are thinking &quot;become the parent you  <br/>
wanted to have.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had lots of thoughts about such things lately, because Holly has  <br/>
a boyfriend, and he&#39;s older than she is (he&#39;s older than Kirby is)  <br/>
and it&#39;s feeling like the final exam of all we&#39;ve built up to.   <br/>
Principles we&#39;ve lived under for sixteen years can&#39;t be set aside  <br/>
because she&#39;s 16!  And really, her maturity surpasses mine and  <br/>
Keith&#39;s put together when either of us was 16.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62856404">I had another thought on this... basically that when I think about<br/>
peaceful parenting, it is more a concept that feels outside myself.  I<br/>
can access it in my head, but not in my knowing/being - it&#39;s not<br/>
instinct.  But when I think about &quot;being the parent I want/ed&quot; - now,<br/>
that I can access in my being, my heart.  That gives me a personal<br/>
connection.  <br/>
<br/>
With peaceful parenting, I feel like I need to study it, learn it,<br/>
practice it.  With &quot;being the parent I want/ed&quot;, that I already know<br/>
and feel, and I can respond appropriately from that without having to<br/>
ask someone else, &quot;when x happens, what do I do?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
When Sandra asked earlier what brought people to peaceful parenting, I<br/>
didn&#39;t really have an answer for myself.  But as others have talked<br/>
about self-improvement, I&#39;ve given this more thought and tried to find<br/>
my own connections.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been reading self-help stuff for many years in an attempt to<br/>
move past my childhood wounds.  But I didn&#39;t see the connection at<br/>
first from that to my own desire to move into peaceful parenting. <br/>
Then it dawned on me.  The reason I waited to have my first child<br/>
until I was 33 was because I was always afraid to have children.  I<br/>
felt I was messed up enough from my own childhood that I didn&#39;t want<br/>
to pass that on to my own child/ren. &lt;lightbulb&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought I had moved past most, if not all, of my childhood wounds,<br/>
but having my own child has shown me I&#39;m not quite done.  To top it<br/>
off, I&#39;m worried about offending my mother by way of parenting<br/>
differently.  We have a pretty good relationship right now after years<br/>
of healing, but the idea of homeschooling has brought up a little<br/>
tension.  I&#39;m afraid she&#39;ll critic or criticize something in our<br/>
parenting, and I&#39;ll react by saying something to the effect of &quot;well,<br/>
I don&#39;t want to parent the same way you did&quot;.  Ugh!  That puts my<br/>
stomach in knots.  Maybe I better go watch another movie &lt;g&gt;. <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re welcome.  I learned it from thinking of things I heard in  <br/>
Adult Children of Alcoholics.  It was healing for me when I did  <br/>
things for Kirby that I wished had been done for me when I was a baby  <br/>
(and then toddler, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
My mom spanked babies.  I saw her spank the boy she had when I was  <br/>
19.  He&#39;s very messed up now.  That  helped me too, to see how  <br/>
horrible my mom could be, and that was her third baby, when she had  <br/>
more experience!!  When I was born she and my dad lived with my dad&#39;s  <br/>
brother and his wife.  The guys were working in Aiken, South Carolina  <br/>
temporarily, and I was born in Augusta, Georgia.  I talked to that  <br/>
uncle a few years ago, and he said he was proud that I was a good  <br/>
mom.  He had been worried about me, he said, because when  was a baby  <br/>
my mom had no idea what to do, and would just look at me when I was  <br/>
crying sometimes, baffled.<br/>
<br/>
Between ACoA and La Leche League, I stayed aware that Kirby was  <br/>
trying to communicate with me and he needed me, and that helped me  <br/>
know what to do.  I tried to communicate back with him wordlessly and  <br/>
patiently, and that was all it took for us to learn to be a team.<br/>
<br/>
 From another aspect, it could be seen as an application of &quot;Do unto  <br/>
others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lest anyone balk at my quoting from my own religious background, here:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Every religion emphasizes human improvement, love, respect for  <br/>
others, sharing other people&#39;s suffering. On these lines every  <br/>
religion had more or less the same viewpoint and the same goal.&quot; The  <br/>

Have you listened to the talk at the bottom of this page?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>
<br/>
I think if parents learn to decide between two options, there&#39;s no  <br/>
studying or learning.  Just don&#39;t decide what to do without thinking  <br/>
of two options and taking the better one.   (I expect to see someone  <br/>
trying to sell this idea for $35 soon, &quot;Make the better choice.&quot;  But  <br/>
I can document to the hour when I had that idea and it changed my own  <br/>
life, and my friends&#39; lives, and made the SCA better all around me.   <br/>
That was cool to see.   And Kirby was a baby, so it helped me there,  <br/>
too.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-To top it off, I&#39;m worried about offending my mother by way of  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could write that out to her, in a nice and artsy way and  <br/>
send it, when you&#39;re not at all mad.  You could tell her that you  <br/>
don&#39;t want to stir up the past, and you don&#39;t want to offend her, but  <br/>
that you also don&#39;t want to parent the way you were parented.  You  <br/>
could say you&#39;re sure she did the best she knew at the time, and now  <br/>
you&#39;re going to do the best you know at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Honest to God, I think longer life spans have created us a bunch of  <br/>
problems.  My husband is 51 and both his parents are living even  <br/>
though his mom was nearly 40 when she had him, so he&#39;s walking on  <br/>
eggshells (roughly, sometimes, I notice) when he himself is past the  <br/>
age people might should naturally die.   I love antibiotics and  <br/>
surgery, don&#39;t get me wrong.  I&#39;d&#39;ve been dead several times if not  <br/>
for modern medicine.  Still...  My mom only died a few years ago,  <br/>
putting the lie to &quot;alcohol will kill you.&quot;  She smoked and drank and  <br/>
lived to 70 or something (really, I don&#39;t remember numbers, so I  <br/>
don&#39;t know exactly, but Holly would.  She&#39;s asleep.)<br/>
<br/>
So maybe be appreciative of the fact that your mom&#39;s still alive  <br/>
without pussy-footing around her as you raise your own children.<br/>
