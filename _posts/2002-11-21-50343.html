Still waiting for that definition of unschooling.  But when it&#39;s my <br/>
business computer, in my office, and my 8 year old daughter is using <br/>
it to IM on a chess and chat site at which I had observed several <br/>
players who clearly were not behaving like young kids, though they <br/>
claimed to be, I think I have a right to oversee the situation.  And <br/>
since she was doing something she wanted to do, was highly motivated <br/>
to do, I decided to motivate her a little more to polish up her <br/>
spelling while she was at it.  She did, and is a good speller now. I <br/>
didn&#39;t ever have to do it again after she gave up the chess & chat <br/>
site because the players began to show their true colors, with foul <br/>
language, sexual innuendo and other unpleasant online behavior.  <br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just one way I do &quot;unschooling&quot;:  I make use of whatever <br/>
opportunity presents itself.  But, sure, why not assume the worst of <br/>
anyone.  Maybe that is not what you would have done.  So what?  I saw <br/>
it as a great opportunity.  It worked, all around.  She wanted to <br/>
play chess online and chat and I needed to supervise that online <br/>
time, so might as well make it work.  Besides, I see nothing wrong <br/>
with encouraging a child who is choosing to communicate in written <br/>
form to spell and communicate correctly, to learn to check her <br/>
spelling.  <br/>
<br/>
You all act like I was making her do spelling lessons, or work <br/>
sheets.  Or I was standing over her with a whip.  Yes, I ALLOWED her <br/>
to use my office machine, under my supervision because of her age and <br/>
what she wanted to do, what I had observed on that particular site, <br/>
but suggesting that she also learn to check her spelling while she <br/>
did this was a good move, one that I have never had to repeat since.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is an unschooling list at all, but an &quot;if you <br/>
don&#39;t do it just like we do it, then you&#39;re not doing it right&quot; <br/>
list.  Whatever happened to my freedom of choice?  My right to grab <br/>
an opportunity when it appropriately presents itself?  Oh, well.  You <br/>
all go play with your &quot;red flags&quot; and leave me alone!  I have as many <br/>
rights to make those kinds of calls as you do.  My choices are no <br/>
better or no worse than anyone else&#39;s, and just like support <br/>
organizations, we all do better when folks are supportive, not <br/>
attacking one another because you don&#39;t happen to agree with some <br/>
nitpicky little thing I carefully and consideredly chose to do.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, how do you who have all the answers choose to get <br/>
spelling into your children&#39;s realities?  If not when they are <br/>
electing to write, motivated to do so all by themselves, then when?<br/>

Seems to be more of a debate forum.  I am not so sure that newbies to unschooling would get any helpful support here?  Why am I still here?  Because I am hoping that when I need some help maybe it will be a calm day and I will be able to get some advice and guidance not peppered by hostility or holier then thou attitudes.  But from an &quot;outsider&quot; looking in that is what I have seen.  I don&#39;t dare say I am perfect.  Nor what I do in a day with my children is perfect.  Thou I do strive to do my best and I believe child initiated learning is ideal.  I would not pass judgment on how other families define unschooling.  If my 12 you wants to do a worksheet I let him.  If they want me to check spelling GREAT I will do it.  My definition of unschool is allowing my children to learn in an environment free from boundaries.  It is allowing them choices to decide HOW they want to learn be it games, reading, internet, hand on, tv, and most important just playing and living...<br/>

And did anyone inquire as to whether my daughter was asking about <br/>
spelling?  Whether she recognized that she wanted to spell words <br/>
correctly?  Whether it was her idea that motivated me to take <br/>
advantage of the situation?  No.  You all assumed that my daughter <br/>
had nothing to do with this.  You know - ASSUME.  Making and ASS out <br/>
of U and ME.  Jumping off Assumption Point.  I saw an appropriate <br/>
opportunity and I used it.  It worked.  She never had to be prompted, <br/>
ever, to check her own spelling.  And I love the coded shorthand that <br/>
she and her friends use on IM now.  Very creative.  Has nothing to do <br/>
with formal written communication, nothing to do with spelling and <br/>
all its class distinguishing uppity-up conventions.  Just as an e-<br/>
list has little to do with formal written communication, like what <br/>
one would expect in a book or article. This is supposed to be <br/>
spontaneous communcation, therefore probably lacking complete <br/>
information, therefore probably a good idea to ask questions first <br/>
and rip people apart later, if you must.<br/>

may find challenging. (Or annoying. Or crushing.) But that&#39;s not<br/>
&quot;motivating&quot; someone.<br/>
<br/>
We will all -- unschoolers and non -- have things we feel are important for<br/>
our children to learn. Just feeling that something is important doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
that we are then justified in setting up a hoop for a child to jump through<br/>
in order to get it into them. Just beceause that hoop worked, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
it&#39;s part of the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
A simple (perhaps simplistic) test for whether something we&#39;d like to do is<br/>
unschooling or not is can the child say &quot;No thanks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*How* we go about incorporating the things we think are important into our<br/>
children&#39;s lives is the difference between schooling and unschooling.<br/>
Presumably those important things will be a natural part of our lives.<br/>
Presumably children will be able to see that *we* think they&#39;re important by<br/>
how we react to those things (which includes explanations about why we think<br/>
something is important) and the importance they play in our lives. Then they<br/>
get to decide if that&#39;s something that&#39;s important to them right now or not.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy to justify any method to get a child somewhere we think it&#39;s<br/>
important for them to be. That doesn&#39;t make it wrong to have done it. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t make it wrong for someone else to think that&#39;s a great idea and try<br/>
it themselves. But just the fact that it works or even that the child<br/>
enjoyed it and later appreciated we did it to them doesn&#39;t make it<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The list doesn&#39;t exist to control what people do or don&#39;t do in their homes.<br/>
If they want to incorporate coercive learning into their homeschooling,<br/>
that&#39;s their decision. But the list is here to help people understand how it<br/>
works when children have the freedom to learn what they want when they want.<br/>
<br/>
The list is *NOT* a sharing of ideas that people who call themselves<br/>
unschoolers do. It&#39;s a sharing of ideas on how people are doing things in an<br/>
unschooling way. It&#39;s also an examination of those ideas under the light of<br/>
trusting our chldren to learn what they want and when they want.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to help their child to spell, there&#39;s a *huge* number of<br/>
ideas they could use. Some of those ranging on the scale of very to slightly<br/>
coercive might even work. But this list exists to discuss how people have<br/>
helped their kids to spell (among other things!) *without* coercing them.<br/>
(And how they&#39;ve helped themselves to cope with being torn between knowing<br/>
the importance of their chldren&#39;s need for self direction and feeling the<br/>
need to direct them.)<br/>
<br/>
People can then say to themselves after reading unschoolish ways of doing<br/>
things &quot;Yeah, but I don&#39;t want to go that far. I&#39;m willing to compromise the<br/>
philosophy for some guarantees.&quot; That&#39;s up to them. But they can&#39;t make the<br/>
decision to compromise the philosophy unless they understand the philosophy.<br/>
And the list is here to help them understand the philosophy. Which it can&#39;t<br/>
do if the list is a sharing of &quot;what works for me&quot; without examining those<br/>
against the philsophy of unschooling.<br/>

I admit I am new to this board and not totally in the unschooling frame<br/>
of mind yet...that is still a work in progress, but I have a question. I<br/>
understand that unschooling is child led learning, and the child has the<br/>
ultimate say in what and how things are learned. But if the child wants<br/>
to be a better speller, how would you go about helping them? I don&#39;t<br/>
think spelling lists are the most exciting way of doing that, but would<br/>
it be considered unschooling to use them? This is completely<br/>
hypothetical for me so let me give you a real life example.<br/>
<br/>
My 4 1/2 y.o. really wants to know how to read. We have a few VTECH<br/>
phonics type toys (all gifts from family members...I don&#39;t really like<br/>
them), and he&#39;s been goofing around with them lately. After watching him<br/>
for a while it seemed to me he was not really getting what the toy was<br/>
trying to teach him so we sat down and did it together. At first he was<br/>
really into it and was paying attention and getting it. Then a few<br/>
minutes later he got bored. Fine, I continued to play with it...just<br/>
wanted to see what it could do, and I thought if he was it in action he<br/>
would be interested. He watched me play then came back. We sat together<br/>
for about 20 minutes &quot;doing&quot; phonics and spelling. To me this feels like<br/>
unschooling, but it was not totally his idea to play with it the<br/>
&quot;correct&quot; way, I lead that. But it was his decision to leave the game,<br/>
then observe me and return to it. I am also looking into phonics<br/>
programs and books (like Hooked on Phonics). He is REALLY motivated, and<br/>
I want to help him. What are your thoughts?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well this may be not considered kosher here.  My children WANT to learn the correct spelling.  They ask ALL the time.  Some things I do to prompt writing and thus spelling is asking my DS to make the grocery list while I dictate it to him.  He does not mind and it helps me. This morning it was done as I cooked some waffles.  His spelling is horrible.  BUT I think the more he asks and uses it in everyday life the better he will grasp it.  My girls like to make cards for DH and I and will ask.  They just made out their Christmas lists and ask how to spell and I tell them.  I try to help them sound out  BUT if I see frustration I will dictate to them the spelling.  My 3yo wanted to know how to spell his name.  He can now recite it even though he does not have the manual dexterity to write it.  I figure it will help with letter recognition. When we read books sometimes I will point out the letters in the book that are in his name or in mommy or daddy or his siblings.   Not sure if this helps or not since mine WANT to know how things spell.  But maybe some ideas to bring spelling into real living.<br/>

Since you are sending me back to the archives please go back and read <br/>
my original post on this, where I took the position that spelling is <br/>
enforced convention, that historically speaking is relatively new and <br/>
used as one of many means to distinguish &quot;class.&quot;  I was defending <br/>
not pushing spelling, and not getting uptight about that convention.  <br/>
How a few of you decided to nitpick, and nitpick truly is the right <br/>
word, my use of &quot;allow&quot; into what has ensued is beyond me.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;The list doesn&#39;t exist to control what people do or don&#39;t do in <br/>

<br/>
Oooh, can I come over to your house on the day my daughter wants to <br/>
learn the physics involved in what happens when a big rock, or <br/>
baseball, is thrown through window glass?  And she wants to do it <br/>
over and over again until she get the principle involved?  Can I, <br/>
please?<br/>
<br/>
Or, can we all meet at your place when she tries pouring candle wax <br/>
on the carpet to see what the chemical and physical reaction is?  I <br/>
like your ideas, but, you see, I just can&#39;t afford to pay for the <br/>
consequences.  So, since you think so highly of these ideas and think <br/>
badly of me for thinking of things like consequences (like what could <br/>
happen to my business computer, my windows, or my carpet, and being a <br/>
responsible adult and parent), then I would love to try some of these <br/>
things at your house.  Okay?<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; The list is *NOT* a sharing of ideas that people who call themselves<br/>
&gt; unschoolers do. It&#39;s a sharing of ideas on how people are doing <br/>

&gt; unschooling way. It&#39;s also an examination of those ideas under the <br/>
light of<br/>
&gt; trusting our chldren to learn what they want and when they want.<br/>
<br/>
So, it is a closed list.  Assumes that everyone on it must already <br/>
know all your definitional specifics.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;But they can&#39;t make the decision to compromise the philosophy <br/>
unless they understand the philosophy.  And the list is here to help <br/>
them understand the philosophy. Which it can&#39;t do if the list is a <br/>

<br/>
Wow.  Have you ever mastered doublespeak!  Since no one can <br/>
understand the philosophy because you&#39;re not going to spell it out <br/>
for them, but instead tell them to go read through the archives (a <br/>
monumental task, at best) and learn for themselves. Catch-22!  And <br/>
you are not asking people to examine anything against &quot;the philosophy <br/>
of unschooling&quot; but against your own specific philosophy of what you <br/>
feel constitutes unschooling.  Except when it comes to adults, who <br/>
are exempt from being able to do &quot;what they want and when they want,&quot; <br/>
because they must conform to what you want and when you want it!  I <br/>

Or ask if he would like to learn a word a day.  Weird words are fun, but if they follow basic spelling rules you can use them to *teach* as well.  It could be a game...for instance:<br/>
baize  coarse napped cotton or wool fabric<br/>
similar spelling to maize. find out if they are related words in terms of country of origin. <br/>
<br/>
OR: have a hopping spelling game.  Mother-may-I spelling game.<br/>
<br/>
Just reading a lot can work for some children; others will not be able to extrapolate from what they read to what they write.  <br/>
<br/>
playing change a letter is fun; Look into Hear for instance, and can help with learning the spelling of simpler words.  (look, Rook, rooM, roAm, roaR, Hoar, hEar.)  <br/>

be well,<br/>

  That&#39;s what I want to know!  Can we discuss ways to help your child spell?<br/>
  Mine is 10 and has shown absolutely no interest - truth be told I&#39;m getting a <br/>

  Well this may be not considered kosher here.  My children WANT to learn the correct spelling.  They ask ALL the time.  Some things I do to prompt writing and thus spelling is asking my DS to make the grocery list while I dictate it to him.  He does not mind and it helps me. This morning it was done as I cooked some waffles.  His spelling is horrible.  BUT I think the more he asks and uses it in everyday life the better he will grasp it.  My girls like to make cards for DH and I and will ask.  They just made out their Christmas lists and ask how to spell and I tell them.  I try to help them sound out  BUT if I see frustration I will dictate to them the spelling.  My 3yo wanted to know how to spell his name.  He can now recite it even though he does not have the manual dexterity to write it.  I figure it will help with letter recognition. When we read books sometimes I will point out the letters in the book that are in hi... <br/>

need support I am not sure I will post it on this list.  Seems to be more<br/>
of a debate forum.  I am not so sure that newbies to unschooling would<br/>
get any helpful support here?  Why am I still here?  Because I am hoping<br/>
that when I need some help maybe it will be a calm day and I will be able<br/>
to get some advice and guidance not peppered by hostility or holier then<br/>
thou attitudes.***<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t understand how you can hope for unschooling advice on an<br/>
unschooling list but think the people giving the advice should be doing<br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
Really, I&#39;m lost.   You will get unschooling advice here.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you want people here to just tell you that anything you want to do is<br/>
unschooling?     I&#39;m seriously asking because I don&#39;t understand what it<br/>
is you hope to find here, if it&#39;s not real information about what<br/>
unschooling is and how to live as an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think everyone with more experience than you, say in car<br/>
mechanics, brain surgery  or cooking is being &quot;holier than thou&quot; if they<br/>
tell you there is a way to go about the job that is right and a way that<br/>
isn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see the hostility here that you seem to see.  Is it possible you<br/>
feel picked on in your real life and so are overly sensitive to<br/>
discussions here?    I have not seen anyone call anyone else names or<br/>
tell them they&#39;re stupid or say they&#39;re going to hell or anything else.  <br/>
What is the hostility?    If I say I&#39;ll be performing brain surgery today<br/>
with my knitting needles and a brain surgeon says, STOP, that&#39;s not how<br/>
you do it, is she being hostile? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I need more coffee, but I just don&#39;t get it. <br/>

My ten year old still uses invented spelling.   He reads and has a visual<br/>
memory but for some reason he doesn&#39;t connect the words he reads to words<br/>
he wants to write.   I can read his writing, but almost nothing is<br/>
spelled correctly.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not worried about it.   I have seen him learn so many things that I<br/>
know he&#39;s going to want to spell well one day and then he&#39;ll pay<br/>
attention to the way words are spelled in the books he reads.  <br/>
He writes stories all the time and I mean, real stories, long,<br/>
complicated, etc.  I think he may always like to write and I think<br/>
leaning to spell will come naturally.  <br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s writing something someone outside the family will have to read<br/>
he asks for spelling help.  He doesn&#39;t expect everyone to be as gifted at<br/>
decoding his writing as his mom and dad are.&lt;g&gt;   He has nice penmanship<br/>
and when he asks for spelling help and gets everything just right he&#39;s<br/>
happy with the way it looks.   I know these things will eventually<br/>
encourage him to pay more attention to spelling correctly.  <br/>

I&#39;m also glad for spell checkers, just in case.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
For this list anyway, unschooling and it&#39;s practice is defined in the<br/>
intro.   Other unschooling lists might be different.  <br/>
I guess what you see as bickering I see as discussion.   And I think<br/>
learning new things requires a lot of judgement.  A lot, and maybe I&#39;m<br/>
not as squeamish about &quot;judgements&quot; as some because I don&#39;t give a poo<br/>
poo for a person who doesn&#39;t have any judgement.    Holy cow!    If I<br/>
hadn&#39;t made a judgement that there was something better than school where<br/>
would my son be today?   If I hadn&#39;t made a judgement that there was a<br/>
better way to think and a better way to live,  his life wouldn&#39;t be as<br/>
good as it is now.   It&#39;s all about judgement.<br/>
If someone asks I going to tell them what I think is better.  If I hadn&#39;t<br/>
judged it to be better, why would I do it? <br/>
<br/>
AND, folks here love opinions!   Couldn&#39;t you tell?&lt;G&gt;    They may get<br/>
questioned and challenged but if they&#39;re worth having, then they&#39;re worth<br/>
explaining.   <br/>
This seems like a good time all around to look at the intro to this list<br/>
again.   <br/>

***Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn<br/>
what they need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling<br/>
parent is a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning<br/>
with curiosity and enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the<br/>
what, when, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to<br/>
Shakespeare to Spongebob Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or<br/>
you&#39;d like to find out more about how video games and life in general are<br/>
filled with learning, come join us! <br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling<br/>
is *not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>
learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest<br/>
in unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you<br/>
keep in mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in<br/>
ways designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>
unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>
&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>
debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations.***<br/>

you can buy a &quot;real&quot; game like this one, but any old dictionary will<br/>
just fine. The person who is &quot;it&quot; finds a word in the dictionary and<br/>
reads the word to the players. Everyone writes down their version of the<br/>
definition. The person with the dictionary writes the real answer. Then<br/>
all answers are read out loud by the person who is &quot;it&quot;. Everyone has to<br/>
guess what the correct definition is. The people who get others to guess<br/>
their incorrect answer get one point, and if no gets the correct answer,<br/>
the person who is &quot;it&quot; gets 10 points. It&#39;s loads of fun!<br/>

&lt;&lt; By the way, how do you who have all the answers choose to get <br/>

<br/>
Nobody has all the answers.  That doesn&#39;t mean nobody has any answers, or <br/>
that all answers are equally valid.<br/>
<br/>
My children&#39;s realities include writing, and writing includes spelling.  They <br/>
have learned to spell by asking questions when they didn&#39;t know how to spell <br/>
something.  I didn&#39;t &quot;get spelling&quot; into their reality.  Spelling predates <br/>
all our lives, and is larger than all of us.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If not when they are <br/>
electing to write, motivated to do so all by themselves, then when?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This question isn&#39;t very clear, but I think you are suggesting that if I <br/>
don&#39;t teach them spelling they won&#39;t ever choose to write.<br/>
<br/>
My boys write daily online--games which are run by text, e-mail, and lots of <br/>
instant messages.  When Holly asks how to spell a word, Marty (13) is as <br/>
likely to spell it for her as I am.  He doesn&#39;t hang back waiting for me, nor <br/>
does he look at me to see if he&#39;s right.  When he  knows, he knows.   He <br/>
didn&#39;t read until he was nine, but he reads and writes effortlessly and is <br/>
really pretty good with punctuation, too.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been working on the rules for an elaborate role-playing game for a year. <br/>
 Nobody got that into his reality but him.  The other night he was writing up <br/>
a little game which, he told me, used buildings as metaphors for <br/>
relationships.   Each building was named for one of the teenaged girls he and <br/>
Kirby hang out with.  Some are gamers, some are other homeschoolers, some in <br/>
the SCA.  It was a funny game, with some astute observations, no meanness <br/>
whatsoever, and it WAS clearly metaphorical in detail.  I never taught him <br/>
that word or concept.  He picked it up by reading, and in conversation about <br/>
movies and stories.  <br/>
<br/>
We watched Brotherhood of the Wolf.  He chose French with subtitles, he said <br/>
so he could see it as it was in the theater.  There were a few hard words <br/>
come by, and I asked him if he knew what they meant, and he did.  So I quit <br/>
asking after that.  He understood the story on one viewing, and was answering <br/>
my questions, and his dad&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
ALL that language use contributes to more facility.  Storytelling, <br/>
conversation, debate, summary/exposition (verbal or written), reading--all <br/>
that leads to clearer writing and spelling.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But if the child  wants<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last summer, my daughter (9) was in a theater workshop and found out that<br/>
there was writing involved. She was concerned because her spelling was<br/>
below &quot;grade level&quot; and she felt self-conscious about writing stuff that<br/>
other people would see (and part of this may stem from an episode in<br/>
brownies when a kid asked her &quot;What *grade * are you in?&quot; after she asked<br/>
the group how to spell a word). We tossed around some ideas but we we<br/>
ended up doing was getting a copy of the Dolch list and I orally quizzed<br/>
her on each word list. After we&#39;d done a list, I wrote up a list of the<br/>
words that she had missed (if she missed one but said &quot;Oh, yeah, I know<br/>
that!&quot; it didn&#39;t go on the list; if she got it right but wanted it on the<br/>
list because she felt shaky with it it did). Then I put words up one at a<br/>
time on our whiteboard. At first I just printed them, but early on she<br/>
decided she&#39;d like to pratice cursive while she was at it, so I would do<br/>
cursive and printed. <br/>
<br/>
At whatever point she felt like it, she would go and learn the word -<br/>
usually she&#39;d write it a few times in print and cursive - and then check<br/>
it off as done. I&#39;d erase it and do the next one. We started a word box<br/>
in the corner of the board for a while, but then she got through too many<br/>
and it took up too much room. I think she made it through four Dolch<br/>
lists before she tired of it all, in a period of maybe 2 months.<br/>
Occasionally she&#39;d ask me to quiz her on the ones she&#39;d already done, and<br/>
she retained almost all of them, as I recall.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t done an &quot;spelling&quot; for a couple of months now, although she&#39;s<br/>
started doing some emailing. She seems to remember at least some of the<br/>
words, but I&#39;m not sure how big an impact all that had on her spelling.<br/>
It made her feel more competent, for sure, but I&#39;m pretty sure she would<br/>
have learned to spell the words anyway. I guess we just hurried up the<br/>
process a bit...<br/>
<br/>
She does ask me how to spell things a lot when she writes, I&#39;m not sure<br/>
if that&#39;s wanting to learn to spell or the fact that it&#39;s faster and<br/>
easier than trying to figure it out herself... it works out the same<br/>
anyway.<br/>

<br/>
Holly liked to see words that looked like her name.  Dolly.  Molly.  Folly.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t confuse her with words that don&#39;t look like it (trolley or crawlie).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I would give her a list of names and let her figure out which were <br/>
which.  Like all our cats&#39; names, or the names of the people in the family.  <br/>
<br/>
She liked word-find puzzles, and our old computer had a program to generate <br/>
them to print.    I would put in the names of her friends, and make them <br/>
copies too.<br/>
<br/>
It was playing, though, not &quot;work,&quot; and I think that made the difference.  <br/>
<br/>
Often if a kid asks for a spelling, I&#39;ll give them an additional clue or <br/>
connection.  A kind of two-for-one.  But not if they&#39;re in the midst of <br/>
writing something important.  Then I just spell.  But if they&#39;re just musing <br/>
or wondering how a word came to be the way it is, I might tell them what the <br/>
root word is (which sometimes helps them remember how to spell it) or say &quot;It <br/>
starts like Christ and Christmas, because it&#39;s from Greek--chiropractor,&quot; or <br/>
whatever the word is.  Or if I have a trick, I pass it on.  &quot;There&#39;s a rat in <br/>
&#39;separate&#39;&quot; is a trick an old boyfriend taught me for spelling &quot;separate.&quot;   <br/>
And for i before e, &quot;Weird is weird&quot; (doesn&#39;t follow the rule).<br/>

&gt; But that&#39;s just one way I do &quot;unschooling&quot;:  I make use of whatever<br/>
&gt; opportunity presents itself.  But, sure, why not assume the worst of<br/>
&gt; anyone.  Maybe that is not what you would have done.  So what?  I saw<br/>
&gt; it as a great opportunity.  It worked, all around.  She wanted to<br/>
&gt; play chess online and chat and I needed to supervise that online<br/>
&gt; time, so might as well make it work.  Besides, I see nothing wrong<br/>
&gt; with encouraging a child who is choosing to communicate in written<br/>
&gt; form to spell and communicate correctly, to learn to check her<br/>
&gt; spelling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing at all wrong with all this, unless you want to call it unschooling.<br/>
Unschooling is about letting the child make the educational decisions with<br/>
no carrots or sticks affecting their decision.  Sure what you did &quot;worked&quot;.<br/>
All kinds of educational methods &quot;work&quot;.  They also often teach other things<br/>
besides what they&#39;re meant to teach, like that someone else knows better<br/>
what I should learn right now than I do.  This is something that I want to<br/>
avoid as an unschooler.  I&#39;m not saying that we should always let our kids<br/>
discover everything for themselves.  Often it&#39;s a good thing to tell our<br/>
kids about the importance of something like spelling.  But making correct<br/>
spelling the key that gets the kid what she wants is not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite possible that this is the only time you ever coerced your<br/>
daughter into learning something.  If that&#39;s the case, your record is way<br/>
better than mine.  But to say it on an unschooling list and then defend it<br/>
as a good unschooling practice is not going to help someone who is still<br/>
trying to wrap their mind around the unschooling philosophy. The things I&#39;ve<br/>
done with my son that were not unschooling are not things that I&#39;m going to<br/>
try to defend here.  Any time I bring them up, it&#39;s to caution others<br/>
against doing what I did.<br/>
<br/>
My right to grab<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; an opportunity when it appropriately presents itself?  Oh, well.  You<br/>
&gt; all go play with your &quot;red flags&quot; and leave me alone!  I have as many<br/>
&gt; rights to make those kinds of calls as you do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s absolutely true.  But if you want to be left alone here, you need to<br/>
not post things about coercing your children into learning, because people<br/>
*will* call you on it on this list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; By the way, how do you who have all the answers choose to get<br/>

to write, motivated to do so all by themselves *and* have asked for help<br/>
with it.<br/>
