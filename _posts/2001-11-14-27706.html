&gt; Neuroscientists have shown that environmental<br/>
&gt; experiences significantly shape the developing brain<br/>
&gt; because of the plasticity of its neuronal<br/>
&gt; connectivity. Thus, repeated exposure to any stimulus<br/>
&gt; in a child&#39;s environment may forcibly impact mental<br/>
&gt; and emotional growth, either by setting up particular<br/>
&gt; circuitry (&quot;habits of mind&quot;) or by depriving the brain<br/>
&gt; of other experiences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have nothing against neuroscientists. I&#39;m sure they are fun at parties.<br/>
But I&#39;m not wildly impressed with their opinions on environmental<br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
What I *am* impressed with are the environmental experiences I observe daily<br/>
here with my own children, who are more than the sum of their neurological<br/>
blips.<br/>
<br/>
There is a scary study out there for almost everything. There are studies<br/>
that show we should all have our two years olds in day care.<br/>
<br/>
Me? I prefer instinct. I was raised by a Doberman who taught me to trust<br/>
mine.<br/>
