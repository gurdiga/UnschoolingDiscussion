&gt; August 1; this can be in the form of either a standardized test, OR<br/>
&gt; grades from a correspondence school OR a portfolio with examples of<br/>
&gt; my child&#39;s work in English and Math. (testing or grades are also<br/>
&gt; required in only English and Math) What do unschoolers typically<br/>
&gt; present as their child&#39;s educational progress for this requirement?-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>For this answer, find a local   or statewide group and see what the <br/>
unschoolers are doing in your area.   We&#39;re keeping local details off this list, to <br/>
keep it for general unschooling discussion.   <br/>
