<div id="ygrps-yiv-327715225">Hi all,<br/>
I just wanted to share that my dd (3) has been into learning sign language <br/>
(from a book).  We have been doing several signs.  Today, my 14month <br/>
succussfully did the sign for &quot;hurt&quot; then clapped for himself (and expected <br/>
us to clap for him too) hee hee hee. It was amazing.  They are soooo <br/>
smart....all children that is....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just wanted to share our success!  BTW, that is what we have been up <br/>
too in our house....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150438018">That is great.  I had intended on teaching my ds sign language when he was <br/>
young, but he became verbal and didn&#39;t seem interested.  Now we have a good <br/>
friend who&#39;s degree is in Deaf Education and he wants to learn from her.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878646814">I am happy for both of you. ASL is something that I<br/>
came into about 2 years ago. I learned it at church<br/>
and ahve gained a deep respect for the deaf. The<br/>
neatest thing about Sign Laguage is that although we<br/>
can learn to sign they can&#39;t learn to hear. Now I know<br/>
may sound dumb but if they are to be accepted into<br/>
hearing society we have to be the ones to reach  out<br/>
to them. In fact I am so excited because DH agreed<br/>
with the idea of me taking a sign language this<br/>
semester at the community college every Saturday.<br/>
Becoming a certified interpreter is something I have<br/>
wanted to do since I learned the language 2 years ago.<br/>
Anyway, good luck to both of you and your children. <br/>
