<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190631852">While I was looking at a completely different book on Amazon (What<br/>
Love Means to You People), I saw a recommendation link for a book<br/>
called The Imperfect Mom, which relates to our recent discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m quoting part of the review, because the reference to laundry piles<br/>
is priceless.  (It&#39;s a great example of seeing the bright side of<br/>
things that bother us.  A bright side that I wouldn&#39;t have thought of.)<br/>
<br/>
from the book description:<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
&quot;Gail Belsky... writes about the emotional conflicts that led to the<br/>
secret circumcision of her son; veteran journalist Judith Newman<br/>
recounts the hair-raising event that sent her and her twins to the<br/>
emergency room; popular author Andrea Buchanan describes *how a pile<br/>
of dirty laundry saved her son from serious injury*; and award-winning<br/>
novelist Caroline Leavitt tells how her own brush with death during<br/>
the first year of her son&#39;s life affected both mother and child. Other<br/>
writers discuss the demanding day-to-day routines and the personality<br/>
&quot;flaws&quot; that undermined their attempts to be the perfect mom.&quot;<br/>
