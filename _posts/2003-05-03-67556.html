<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667206953">My job as a kid was to mow the backyard every week.  We had a push mower with <br/>
a grass catcher, that my dad kept &quot;well tuned&quot;....it sounds like yours needs <br/>
the blades sharpened...they should not be that hard to use.  I think the <br/>
trick is to WALK FAST...LOL!!  That gets the blade spinning quickly and it <br/>
cuts much better.  I saw one at a thrift store a while back and it brought <br/>
back such memories!!  If our yard wasn&#39;t so big I would have bought it.  <br/>
<br/>
I hate yard tools that have motors...don&#39;t even ask me about our <br/>
weedeater...takes about 57 pulls to get it going....sheesh....finally went <br/>
out and got one of those old metal &quot;weed whackers&quot;....much easier.<br/>

Sears has a terrific cordless electric mower.  We&#39;ve had it for two or <br/>
three years and love it.  No gas to schlep, to cord to roll back up, just <br/>
plug it in and forget about it.<br/>

I use two extension cords. (One of which has been completely mowed over<br/>
and spliced back together.)  My yard isn&#39;t even big, just long and<br/>
skinny.  You may want to pace off your distance.<br/>

We were going to do it - but forgot to go. They have special dates and <br/>
places to do it and only a certain number of electric mowers available <br/>
- 1,000 at each location each day. You get a $450 electric lawnmower <br/>
for $150 if you turn in an old gas mower.<br/>

whinny a lot, leave the odd big hole, and auto-fertilize the lawn! We do have <br/>

were able to mow half before the charge went out.  That was about all<br/>
the energy either of us had to mow anyway.  The rest was left for the<br/>
next day.  Here, in Arizona, with a small yard, we have a manual mower. <br/>
It is so easy to use and push, that is the way we would go if we ever<br/>
had a big yard again.  We also had a cordless trimmer, too, so I know<br/>
they exist.  We never needed it for our yard there.  Now, we have a<br/>
manual one for the edges and a corded electric one for the sides of<br/>
things.  that works great.<br/>
