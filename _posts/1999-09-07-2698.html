<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;ve found what works for your family and that&#39;s <br/>
what we all strive for.  I try not to get hung up on what defines <br/>
pure unschooling.  I know what it means for my family and that may be <br/>
different from yours,  but we&#39;re both just doing what works for us.<br/>
I like the term natural learners.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t require writing and math like you do,  but I also don&#39;t <br/>
consider our unschooling unguided.  I think it was Lisa who mentioned <br/>
the constant conversations we have with our kids about their goals <br/>
and how they get from point A to point B.  Ds just picked up an <br/>
English book off our bookshelves.  Now he has no love for grammar <br/>
and composition,  but he has watched his sister prepare for and go to <br/>
college and we have had many discussions on college entrance and ACTs <br/>
because this is something he sees in his future.  So,  I do feel like <br/>
we are guiding him.   More than anything though,  I see myself as a <br/>
facilitator.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638305929">I do not understand what is the big deal about giving our children<br/>
guidance in areas where they need nudging. I am well aware that for some<br/>
people who call themselves &quot;unschoolers,&quot; my way of thinking might be<br/>
considered politically incorrect.  (BIG WOOOOoooo!)[Image]<br/>
<br/>
So this whole question of how to &quot;unschool&quot; math and writing begs a<br/>
whole other question: what precisely is meant by &quot;unschooling?&quot;  To me,<br/>
it means NOT learning the way public schools try to force rigid learning<br/>
upon kids.  Unschool = NOT school.  And we do NOT school at my house.<br/>
We have fun and learn.  That is why I have chosen the term Natural<br/>
Learners to describe what we do.  It doesn&#39;t smack of the 60s (unhip<br/>
uncool ungroovy unschool).  It is a natural term that describes a<br/>
natural process.  You don&#39;t need to get hung up on positions of<br/>
authority.<br/>
A mom&#39;s position can naturally be one of guidance.  A kid&#39;s position can<br/>
naturally be one of being a kid.<br/>
<br/>
My kids do Saxon math -- well, one of them does. My other kid hates<br/>
Saxon, but loves math.  So he works out of whatever math book he feels<br/>
like using.  My other kid who uses the Saxon book does it about 3 times<br/>
a week.  And she does math worksheets that we got off the internet.  It<br/>
is a cute little program called Math Worksheet Factory Deluxe, and you<br/>
can customize problems, how many digits in addends, minuends, factors,<br/>
divisors and the like.  It does fractions, decimals and percentages, so<br/>
I can use it for my 12 year old son also.  They LIKE their math sheets<br/>
and they ASK for them.  But it was initially MY direction that they do<br/>
them.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with things being adult led<br/>
part of the time.  Hey, we all take turns!<br/>
<br/>
We play &quot;Math Monopoly&quot; around here. Before you take your turn, you work<br/>
one of your math problems.  I had a highschooler, a 6th grader and a 5th<br/>
grader all playing together, with their various levels of math.  The<br/>
highschooler used her Harold Jacobs Algebra book  for her problems<br/>
before turns.  The 6th grader did long division with 2 digits in the<br/>
divisor and 3 digits in the dividend (did I say that right?) and the 5th<br/>
grader did multiplication with decimals.  They played for 2 hours<br/>
straight.  I didn&#39;t ask them to.  I didn&#39;t stop them.  They were having<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
I have the book Family Math.  I have Harold Jacob&#39;s books on Algebra and<br/>
also on Mathematics: A human Endevour.  I have a GREAT book called The<br/>
Amazing Book of Shapes.  I also have the books How Math Works, Rapid<br/>
Math Tricks and a couple of books by that human calculator guy whose<br/>
name I can&#39;t remember.  All the kids use all of these books at some<br/>
point when learning about math.  The 10 and 12 year old like them as<br/>
much as the 14 and 15 year old.<br/>
<br/>
But I definitely fostered in them an initial interest in mathematics.<br/>
At times, there were some activities I intentionally restricted until<br/>
math was done. (In the early years, from preschool through 9, natural<br/>
daily activities incorporate so much math that very little restrictions<br/>
need to be made.  The kids pretty much generate mathematical concepts on<br/>
their own and play with the ideas, working them into games and<br/>
strategies.  But at some point, it is OK to introduce a more focused<br/>
approach.  And at THAT moment, I pushed, without any qualms.  I<br/>
encouraged.  I let them know that a certain standard in mathematics is<br/>
without question to be acheived.  And they rose to the occasion.  My<br/>
kids are NOT mathphobic at all.  They do it with pride.  And of their<br/>
own initiative, they ask for math worksheets or play one of the many<br/>
math computer games we have (I downloaded a bunch of cool freebies off<br/>
the internet, I bought Mathblaster and we have some old DOS based games<br/>
that run on an ancient 386.  These are mainly word problem games.<br/>
<br/>
With writing, we used Charlotte Mason&#39;s narrative method for years.  We<br/>
still use it, but this fall I am absolutely requiring them to come up<br/>
with 2 written paragraphs a day.  (Which winds up being about 3 times a<br/>
week with all the other stuff we do).  They write the paragraphs, I<br/>
correct them, and the copy over the final draft with corrections.  I<br/>
figure that is not too much to ask of a 10 and 12 year old.  But this<br/>
moment was a LONG time coming.  We talked about it for 2 years, so there<br/>
were NO surprises when I said, &quot;OK, guys.  Now it REALLY IS time for 2<br/>
paragraphs a day!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Our time is SO free and SO fluid, and we have SO much fun.  I don&#39;t have<br/>
any problem with pushing the kids in areas where I know they need work.<br/>
It is for their own good.  Kids are kids.  They don&#39;t know what is<br/>
coming down the pike.  I can see further ahead.  I&#39;ve been there.  To<br/>
me, unschooling is NOT synonymous with &quot;unguided.&quot;   Guides are useful.<br/>
Just ask Lewis and Clark!  Any time you are in unfamiliar territory and<br/>
you want to get your bearings, it helps to have an experienced person<br/>
around.  I view my position as mentor and mom(predominantly MOM!).  I<br/>
support.  I uplift.  I let go.  AND I give guidance and direction, when<br/>
needed.  That is my job.  Their job is to explore, play, laugh,<br/>
discover, work, develop, grow, be happy, be sad, be mad, be a KID!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, for what it&#39;s worth, that is our style of learning.<br/>

<br/>

can&#39;t do that until you do this&quot; because it sets up the required thing to<br/>
be something that is either suffered through, or rushed through, done *so<br/>
that* they can get to the more desirable activity.   It sets it up as the<br/>
less desirable activity, and I *hate* when people do that, especially to<br/>
math.<br/>

<br/>
I cringe at the very idea of talking for two years about the time coming<br/>
when something will be required, like it or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d far rather just write, just allow them to do the writing they need.<br/>
Which, btw, has been more than two paragraphs a day most of the time, no<br/>
two years discussing it beforehand and then telling them to do it.<br/>
Sometimes they write a lot, sometimes they go for a while without writing<br/>
much of anything.  But the surest way I can think of to make them self<br/>
conscious about it is to require that they write, whether they have<br/>
something to say or not.  Writing is about communicating, about having<br/>
something to say, not about performing for someone else.<br/>

doing.  I can&#39;t help but see it as for *your* needs, not theirs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538874671">Dear Linda Wyatt,<br/>
<br/>
I am always forthright with what I do, whatever list I belong to.  I do not<br/>
ascribe to every view you have about children&#39;s education, nor do you ascribe<br/>
to mine.  The whole issue of &quot;pushing&quot; at our house is a non-issue.  There may<br/>
be parents who want to nudge their kids some and there may be others who<br/>
don&#39;t.  It is definitely a parental perogative.<br/>
<br/>
Your line of questioning is definitely designed to put one on the defensive,<br/>
even as that non-homeschooling mother in the store did to that woman who<br/>
homeschooled her children.  Let us just say that our parenting styles probably<br/>
differ to some degree.  Whether or not you have a problem with what I require<br/>
or do not require of my children is really a moot point.  I don&#39;t have any<br/>
problem with how you are raising your kids.<br/>
<br/>
I knew very well that I was introducing ideas that some people would frown on,<br/>
but I can&#39;t let that stop me from being honest in my post, nor can I let<br/>
people&#39;s pushing their opinions on me sway me from what I intend on doing.<br/>
<br/>
Your questions were direct and succinct.  I believe my answers are also.<br/>
Perhaps we can take up our differences in private posts.  I like the concepts<br/>
of unschooling a lot.  It is the only group of people that comes anywhere close<br/>
to what I think.  I absolutely DO NOT fit in to those tightly structured school<br/>
at home groups.  I may not fit in perfectly here, but then, I am not trying to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131853328">Dear entire group --<br/>
I believe wholeheartedly in the light, guided touch that unschooling<br/>
offers.  The trust and support that parents give their kids is so<br/>
crucial to their development.  Perhaps Linda&#39;s reaction was because she<br/>
thought I was dissing what unschooling is about.  I am NOT.  Unschooling<br/>
is NOT unguided.  It is guidance with the highest awareness of<br/>
sensitivity to the kids.  It is allowing kids to learn by living. (It is<br/>
Yoda style guidance!)<br/>
<br/>
Some other person wrote &lt;I don&#39;t require writing and math like you do,<br/>
but I also don&#39;t consider our unschooling unguided.&gt; Nor do I!!! I LIKE<br/>
the freedom that unschoolers provide.  Learning basically can be done<br/>
ONLY by the person experiencing what he/she is learning.  It is a solely<br/>
individual experience (although its outcomes can have collective<br/>
consequences).<br/>
<br/>
I have two dyslexic children, and I chose this year to provide them with<br/>
more exercises in their areas of disability.  If they did not have this<br/>
disability, I would be letting them do whatever they want, like their<br/>
older sister.  But it is in fact, like physical therapy.  Those issues<br/>
need to be addressed.  I certainly DO NOT believe every family should do<br/>
that, or needs to.<br/>
<br/>
I also see no reason NOT to push kids in areas where they need to get<br/>
something done.  The word &quot;push&quot; may be a button word around here, but<br/>
in my house it is neutral. I am not talking about nagging or squelching<br/>
or driving, or being pushy.  I am jes&#39; talkin bout givin&#39; a little push,<br/>
like, &quot;Hey. Didja brush yer teeth?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Everybody needs a little push now and then.[Image]<br/>

<br/>
I believe this is so true as well.  In fact, I was just having a discussion<br/>
along these very lines with my SIL who was visiting us last weekend.  She<br/>
was stopping on the way to CO, where they are moving and her Dh and teenage<br/>
son are already living.  They moved to Littleton, where their son is<br/>
attending the HS.  He has had moderate success in PS, but he is a bright<br/>
and emotionally mature kid, and has really benefitted from his parents&#39;<br/>
understanding of how kids learn, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, he says the kids at the HS are a little &quot;weird&quot; and sometimes<br/>
&quot;get all quiet and gather around some spot in the hallway, talking in<br/>
hushed tones about this being the spot where so-and-so died...&quot; but that in<br/>
general they are OK, and he has made some friends already.  They had him<br/>
skip the first week, so that he would miss out on all the media circus when<br/>
the kids started school.  He likes the town and the school.  His mom told<br/>
him &quot;no more morbid poetry&quot; as he was writing some last year in his school<br/>
in WA for effect (on his teachers) and had SUCH an effect that she sent him<br/>
to the school counselor!</div>
