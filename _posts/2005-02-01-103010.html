 </span></blockquote> See, this is part of what Im referring to.  You take<br/>
something I say and try to twist it in a way to<br/>
belittle my statements.  Obviously you know I did not<br/>
have to take a course to be a parent.  I did however<br/>
have to take a Parent Qualifying Course in order to<br/>
legally homeschool my son.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See, though, I&#39;ve been involved in  unschooling and in correspondence with <br/>
other unschoolers all over the world, and I&#39;ve never ever heard of a Parent <br/>
Qualifying Course, so maybe you could have just clarified for this very large list <br/>
of 1600 people what you meant.    <br/>
<br/>
As to &quot;have to,&quot; this is a recurring topic here, and some parts have been <br/>

If you think of your life as a series of &quot;have to&quot; moments, you are less <br/>
empowered than if you try to see all your options and choices.  And you might <br/>
easily think of your child&#39;s life as one big &quot;have to&quot; also, unless you try to <br/>
sort out clearly what is &quot;have to&quot; and what is choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39899301">I looked this up because it seemed so absurd.  The Washington<br/>
Homeschool Organization<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.washhomeschool.org/whoQualify.html)">http://www.washhomeschool.org/whoQualify.html)</a> says:<br/>
 	<br/>
&quot;The law pertaining to qualifying courses, 28A.225.010(4) states:<br/>
...if such activities are: (b) Provided by a parent who is instructing<br/>
his or her child only and who has either earned forty-five college<br/>
level quarter credit hours or its equivalent in semester hours or has<br/>
completed a course in home-based instruction at a postsecondary<br/>
institution or a vocational-technical institute;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, while absurd, it is true. I wonder what brilliant mind decided<br/>
that this was a good way to waste the time and energy of invested parents.<br/>

either have one semester of college OR take a &quot;How to<br/>
homeschool&quot; class....Montana legistlature is trying to<br/>
pass a bill right now that Montana homeschool parents<br/>
have to have a teaching degree (or just a BA, I think)<br/>
OR have a teacher keep track of them for two<br/>
years....or some such crap...<br/>
