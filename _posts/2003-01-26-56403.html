<div id="ygrps-yiv-783839757">This thread intrigues me very much.  While my kids are &quot;older&quot; than most on <br/>
this list; dd 22, ds 21, ds 18, dd 14 (and the older two have their own <br/>
houses both within ten miles) the more often than not come to dinner five <br/>
nights a week.  ALWAYS on Sunday we eat together as a family.  Not always all <br/>
at the dining room table, sometimes on a table cloth in the living room, but <br/>
always Sunday dinner is the ONE time in the week even the older &quot;children&quot; <br/>
are here and we are a family under the same roof once again.<br/>
<br/>
I prepare all our meals at home from scratch, it&#39;s important to me because <br/>
it&#39;s important to them.  They all have their &quot;favorites&quot; and when they ask, I <br/>
make it.  To me cooking for my family is blessing them, the older ones coming <br/>
home for dinner blesses me, makes me know they WANT to be with me and their <br/>
family (if you have/had teenagers, you will understand this).<br/>
<br/>
We spend a HUGE amount of our money for food, there are six of us in our <br/>
family and we ALWAYS have one to ten EXTRAS for meals.  I rarely have any <br/>
help preparing in the meal but I always have help cleaning up.<br/>
<br/>
Many friends of my older kids are amazed the first time they come to Sunday <br/>
dinner, the act as if it&#39;s Thanksgiving and in fact some even mention &quot;this <br/>
is like Thanksgiving at our house&quot;.  I think that&#39;s sad that only a few times <br/>
a year do they gather for an abundant meal full of laughter and people they <br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago when my teenagers were being especially teenagerly, my New <br/>
Years Resolution was to try to treat them with the grace and hospitality that <br/>
I would a guest in my home.  Only in the sense that I would make a conscious <br/>
effort each week to make their favorite dishes, their favorite snacks/treats. <br/>
 Handle subjects that upset me in a way I would with someone else, delicately <br/>
and carefully, not just full force MOTHER IN YOUR FACE kinda of thing.<br/>
<br/>
That just naturally spilled over into the big meals on Sunday and a wonderful <br/>
new family tradition.  It is a wonderful feeling to know that your grown <br/>
children could go any place on earth and live and prosper yet they CHOOSE to <br/>
be near home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You would feel even worse for us then.  We have no sit down, large <br/>
Thanksgiving meal.  Have tried it a couple of times.  My boys just aren&#39;t <br/>
impressed because food for them is no big deal.  They eat when they are <br/>
hungry and stop when they are full.  <br/>
<br/>
Made a huge Thanksgiving meal, vegetarian here, they stopped playing the play <br/>
station for a minute came to the table had a spoon of mashed potato and went <br/>
back to play some more.  I felt like I had failed but soon realized that the <br/>
children were acting exactly the way I have always wanted them to about food. <br/>
 They weren&#39;t eating to please me or anything else.  They weren&#39;t hungry.  <br/>
<br/>
So we changed our Thanksgiving.  Now we do something special.  We go on a <br/>
short vacation and spend fun time together without the food.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That sounds wonderful!  But even though it IS the food it really ISN&#39;T <br/>
either.  It&#39;s the coming together as a family, even though we aren&#39;t really <br/>
apart.  Two of my children are in college, one is HS and is on an all star <br/>
cheer team which practices three nights a week until nine, so everyone is <br/>
busy.  I know everyone here is busy too.  But to them it&#39;s the ritual I think <br/>
more than the actual food.  It&#39;s just an extra that I try to make it special <br/>
by preparing favorites of theirs and to them it&#39;s a way of my showing I care <br/>
enough about them to go to the effort of making a meal.  I wouldn&#39;t expect <br/>
that younger children would understand this or even think of it as anything <br/>
other than sustinance, but as they get older it becomes more to them.<br/>
<br/>
I have lupus and some days it&#39;s a struggle to cook a meal for them so <br/>
somedays it&#39;s leftovers, and somedays I do nothing but make the meal for them <br/>
to enjoy.  Sounds crazy to some I would expect but my greatest joy in life is <br/>
my family.  Nothing makes me happier than all of them coming together <br/>
talking, laughing, sharing their experiences, arguing and loving each other.<br/>
<br/>
Last Mother&#39;s Day, my oldest son shows up, the other kids are already here, <br/>
he has a friend with him and one of his cousins.  I am in the kitchen rushing <br/>
around trying to finish the ham and get dinner on the table.  The friend <br/>
comments that &quot;his dad is taking his Mom OUT TO DINNER for Mother&#39;s Day&quot; <br/>
while I was sweating in the kitchen.  Matthew then asked him if that was so <br/>
special for his MOTHER why was HE HERE!  He stammered and stuttered and <br/>
Matthew simply told him, to MY mother, WE are her gifts and she asks nothing <br/>
more than we all be here together.  I was proud and excited when he gave me a <br/>
ring box and inside was a mother&#39;s ring and each of the children&#39;s names <br/>
engraved around their birthstone.<br/>
<br/>
I know for those who can barely find time to feed their families this does <br/>
not make sense.  But if you can understand that it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s <br/>
pigs in a blanket or prime rib, it&#39;s the EVENT that dinner is more than the <br/>
type or amount of food.  This becomes more important as children find their <br/>
way in the world and have jobs and other things going on.  I think sometimes <br/>
if our children are home with us every day all day, we might sometimes take <br/>
that time a little for granted.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I did before but try to make an effort not to anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I probably didn&#39;t help anyone understand it better but it isn&#39;t about actual <br/>
food at all.  <br/>
