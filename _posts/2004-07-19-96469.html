<div id="ygrps-yiv-783224372">As long as it doesn&#39;t really piss off your dh! I used to think the <br/>
perfect time to talk about &quot;stuff&quot; was on the train when we were <br/>
commuting together. Dh felt trapped and annoyed! So I think I&#39;d be <br/>
cautious about sending an email about a big issue in the morning. <br/>
There are things that I would want to talk about right away, not be <br/>
forced to wait until evening, esp. if someone were telling me things <br/>
I don&#39;t want to hear...<br/>
<br/>
Whatever works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403012734">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I use<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; email to communicate with my dh so I can get through what I want to say<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do this to.  For important issues, I email dh at work.  That way what I<br/>
want to say is uninterrupted by kidlets and he has several hours to think<br/>
about how he would like to respond.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This email idea is a good one, and I do send him stuff, like some of the<br/>
replies I have received today. However dh is not away at work. He is sitting<br/>
across the room most of the time. One thing that has been useful to me, is<br/>
if either of us has to go out, on an errand or to some appointment, before<br/>
the issue is resolved, we will usually call each other and talk much better<br/>
on the phone than we had in person. <br/>
<br/>
This not interrupting thing is something that can really make any verbal<br/>
communication tough, so I think email - even when he is just over there -<br/>
could be a tool I should use more often. <br/>
<br/>
I have a metaphorical way to explain about it. <br/>
<br/>
My husband will say: The sky is red. So you should do such-and-such, and<br/>
so-and-so. I feel that your are blah, blah, blah. Also yada, yada, yada, on<br/>
and on and on. And another thing is you blah, yada, on-and-on and so<br/>
forth...<br/>
<br/>
For usually about 4-6 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile I am thinking, &quot;But the sky isn&#39;t red.&quot; It seems like everything<br/>
following the false premise is probably also wrong, and it is really hard<br/>
both to listen to and to remember all the different ideas, while caught up<br/>
in the very first erroneous statement.<br/>
<br/>
He also believes that saying &quot;I feel you are wrong&quot; is the same as sharing<br/>
his feelings. I sent him the NVC website. So far my attempts to use these<br/>
techniques have resulted in him getting really irritated - I must be doing<br/>
it wrong. Validating the other person&#39;s feelings stopped a crazy mob of<br/>
screaming Palestinians from calling Dr. Rosenberg a murderer, but it makes<br/>
my dh furious.<br/>
