<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds almost like the freak out my son had last week. He&#39;s taking a<br/>
welding class at a tech school. He has both high school students and<br/>
adults in class with him. One of the adult students was telling him about<br/>
how he tried to start several businesses but they all failed &quot; because he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a high school diploma&quot;. He also &quot;can&#39;t get a job&quot; for the<br/>
same reason.<br/>
My son freaked because now he&#39;ll &quot;end up on welfare&quot; since I didn&#39;t force<br/>
him to go to school where &quot;they would have forced him to learn math&quot; and<br/>
he &quot;could be going to school now and getting a diploma if he had the<br/>
confidence that he could keep up with the high school level classes&quot;. <br/>
He also told me he believes that if you don&#39;t learn stuff by the time<br/>
you&#39;re 11 you&#39;ll never get it.<br/>
After talking a while to find out what brought on this math attack he<br/>
told me he was upset because his shop teacher was trying to figure out<br/>
how they were going to complete 140 credit hours in 44 days at 2 1/2<br/>
hours a day. Another student did the math instantly while my son had to<br/>
think about it. My fault! He doesn&#39;t want to have to think about it. He<br/>
wants to be able to do the math instantly. I told him that the other guy<br/>
probably does math every day, and if he had to do it every day he be<br/>
quicker too.<br/>
I found a book I used to try to get him to work out of years ago called<br/>
Math for Smartypants and read him a couple of examples of math geniuses<br/>
that could do awesome calculations almost instantly in their heads. One<br/>
was a young kid that supposedly lost his abilities as he grew older and<br/>
learned other stuff. I guess he had to clear out space to store more<br/>
info.<br/>
He&#39;s been working on math on his own when I haven&#39;t been looking he told<br/>
me. I found him some stuff to work on and watched him get frustrated.<br/>
Brought back memories( or should I say nightmares) of before I discovered<br/>
unschooling. I told him not to do it if it was that painful, maybe he&#39;s<br/>
just not a math kinda guy. If he wants to start a business maybe he could<br/>
hire a bookkeeper. I gave him the example of the last part time job I<br/>
had. I managed the office at a gymnastics school because the guy who<br/>
owned it enjoyed coaching but hated the office part of the business.<br/>
Today I told my son if he wants a diploma I&#39;d print him one up on the<br/>
computer. He liked that.<br/>
I &#39;m still worried about him and his fears, it&#39;s not good to be thinking<br/>
like this at his age.<br/>
Somebody tell me something good. Is there a list of not so famous<br/>
homeschoolers that aren&#39;t on welfare? The famous list doesn&#39;t do it for<br/>
him.<br/>

diploma to start a business. His businesses failed because he&#39;s a poor <br/>
businessman! I&#39;m guessing he can&#39;t get a job because of some other factor. <br/>

(Joyce probably figured it out before the end of the sentence!!!&lt;G&gt;): 44 <br/>
days. Two hours a day---88 hours. add another 1/2 hour/day 22 hours. <br/>
UMMMM---110 hours. Nope it won&#39;t work. They&#39;ll have to put in more time, <br/>
maybe a coupla&#39; extra Saturdays. <br/>
<br/>
I bet I spent JUST as many hours in math class as Joyce. It&#39;s her LOVE. It&#39;s <br/>
my struggle. Is it possible for me to do math? Sometimes. (Hell, that example <br/>

Been there since I received it! I did go to college. LOTS of them: Cornell. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading Benjamin Franklin&#39;s autobiography. Heh. First, let <br/>
me say I WAS WRONG, about Ben anyway. Back when I first started <br/>
posting here, I boldly asserted that the Founding Fathers all had <br/>
strict, scheduled courses of learning to follow, as directed by their <br/>
parents or tutors. WRONG! B. Franklin was totally self-educated, <br/>
except his momma taught him to read, and one year of grammar school.<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to that diploma thing. His father, seeing how quickly and <br/>
early he learned to read, thought he might make a good scholar, and <br/>
so enrolled him in grammar school at age eight. He made head of class <br/>
in one year, but because of money concerns, AND BECAUSE [quote] &quot;the <br/>
mean living many so educated were afterwards able to obtain&quot; [/quote] <br/>
his father withdrew Benjamin from the school. <br/>
<br/>
Hmm, back in colonial days, a course of higher education often meant <br/>
no great improvement in the capacity to earn a living? Really? Sort <br/>
of like my hubby&#39;s comments &quot;Look at how many people with college <br/>
degrees are flipping burgers at McDonald&#39;s&quot; L <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you what Mr. Franklin attributes his huge success to, <br/>
though: Hard Work. His fortune was made in the printing trade, and <br/>
many customers were recommended to him in his first year of business, <br/>
because he had a reputation of being a worker. He gained a reputation <br/>
as a man good with words, because at age 12, he set out on a course <br/>
to improve his style. Not becuase a teacher told hiim to, but because <br/>
he wanted to improve his writing style. And then he diligently <br/>
pursued that goal, working hard to refine his writing. He also worked <br/>
hard his whole life at improving his moral behavior. <br/>
<br/>
He never was any good at math.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m learning lots from Ben. Franklin, I must say.<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Piggy-backing on this (I so totally agree):<br/>
<br/>
I have a HS diploma and a Bachelor&#39;s from UCLA in history. <br/>
Here&#39;s my work record:<br/>
<br/>
I have worked as an editor of Ph.D. theses, have been a senior <br/>
editor for a magazine (over three years), have ghost-written two <br/>
books for the founder of a major denomination, have edited two <br/>
collections of articles for two published books, am contributing <br/>
editor to another magazine and have started my own&quot;teaching <br/>
writing&quot; business that is growing and shows no sign of stopping. <br/>
NOT ONCE has any of my employers or clients asked, &quot;Do you <br/>
have a degree?&quot; (This always amazes me actually.)<br/>
<br/>
In fact, most people just laugh when I tell them that I majored in <br/>
historyWTH has that got to do with writing? :)<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I&#39;ve noticed is that guys who feel trapped by <br/>
lower wages for not having completed college or high school are <br/>
usually people who didn&#39;t become invested in themselves until <br/>
they had already tied themselves down with family <br/>
responsiblities.<br/>
<br/>
My brother (now 40) is unmarried and never went to college. He <br/>
has an incredibly successful business now. But he went through <br/>
some pretty lean years to get there. Since he was unmarried, he <br/>
could live that way guilt free. <br/>
<br/>
I think guys who feel trapped often were into family life and didn&#39;t <br/>
find out who they were or how they could make it.<br/>
<br/>
For unschooled kids, my hope is that they will know enough of <br/>
who they are to be able to dig in to that field and not stammer <br/>
around &quot;looking for a job.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can tell him that when my DH started his business and started <br/>
playing the stock market, I had to sit down and teach him how to do <br/>
fractions and decimals, and all sorts of stuff. He had always <br/>
been &quot;bad at math&quot; in school, and didn&#39;t graduate from high school <br/>
(though he did go back later and get a GED I think). But when he had <br/>
a passionate interest and reason to learn the math, he got it very <br/>
quickly. When we lived in Seattle, he started his own business <br/>
cleaning airplanes, and quickly took it to an extremely successful <br/>
enterprise with several employees. By the time we left, 3 years <br/>
later, he was turning customers down, he had too many.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I&#39;m quite good at math, and went up through Calculus with ease. <br/>
However, I didn&#39;t retain much of it because I don&#39;t use it on a daily <br/>
basis. If I had to work a differential equation now, I&#39;d have to get <br/>
down a book just to remember what the heck it really is. I can still <br/>
multiply and divide in my head easily, but that always came easily to <br/>
me. For some folks it will, some folks it will come with lots of <br/>
practice, and some folks, even successful businessmen like my DH, <br/>
will pull out a calculator! :-) <br/>
<br/>
John Holt, in one of his books - maybe How Kids Learn, or Learning <br/>
All The Time - had some fun ideas for how to improve math skills. If <br/>
your son is interested in improving, he might try some of those. My <br/>
son really likes math and is always begging me to buy him workbooks. <br/>
They sell them at places like Rite-Aid and have them in various grade <br/>
levels, that might be another option if he just wants to practice <br/>
basic skills, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve heard of CD-Roms like MathBlasters <br/>
and such that could be fun if a kid wanted to mess around with them. <br/>
There&#39;s lots of ways to improve math skills, if that&#39;s your son&#39;s <br/>
goal. If not, there is no limit to what age he could be when he does <br/>
decide that he needs the skills. If my DH can learn to multiply <br/>
fractions at 32, then learning obviously doesn&#39;t stop at 11!<br/>
<br/>
I really hate the mainstream thinking that says there&#39;s a certain age <br/>
one must learn things by and after that, all is useless. I just <br/>
learned last year to write fiction, and wrote a novel. Before age 35, <br/>
I had no idea I would even *want* to do such a thing, let alone be <br/>
capable of it. What age was Grandma Moses when she started painting, <br/>
anyway? I did once see a website about &quot;late bloomers&quot; that listed <br/>
various famous people and the ages that they&#39;d started practicing <br/>
their trade, and it was really interesting. Definitely pointed out <br/>
that any age can be right to grab a passion and go with it. There&#39;s <br/>
no such thing as too late.<br/>

Gonna second this.  I was lucky.  I finished nursing school before I got pregnant.  I have a good paying job in a very flexible field where the demand for nurses is currently high. My job allows me to work minimal hours and enjoy the rest of my life doing what I want on the side.  My husband finished high school and has a laborers job.  (Its a great job, but it would not support us without my additional income).<br/>
<br/>
Had I gotten pregnant a few months earlier, things could be A LOT different.<br/>
<br/>
I have told my kids OFTEN that they can do whatever they want in their lives, and they can learn whatever they need to when they need it BUT if they have a family before they are ready, it could really throw a monkey wrench in things :o).<br/>
<br/>
And its my hope that my kids will have such high self esteem and enough common sense that they will not feel the need to jump into anything for the wrong reasons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865594927">Random anecdote:  My college had a math requirement (for graduation) that<br/>
could be satisfied by:<br/>
<br/>
A.  Taking two math classes, or<br/>
B.  Taking two communications classes and two art classes<br/>
<br/>
I never understood this variation, and moreover often wondered: since I was<br/>
a communications major with a concentration in art, did that make me a math<br/>
major as well?<br/>
<br/>
And to make my post relevant:  Offhand I can only think of 3 people I know<br/>
who haven&#39;t had ANY experience in college.  They are: an engineer for Amtrak<br/>
(making $100K a year), a record producer in NYC (earns $75/hour and has<br/>
worked with Vitamin C and Bjork), and a television producer at Lifetime.<br/>
The list of people I know who have no high school credentials but went on to<br/>
college is too long to even get into here.<br/>

&gt; businessman! I&#39;m guessing he can&#39;t get a job because of some other factor.<br/>

the whole liberal arts thing.  You end up knowing a little about a <br/>
lot, but in my case it was nothing about everything.  It had the <br/>
effect, on me, of just taking a course, going through the motions, <br/>
trying to get a decent grade, so I could get onto something else.  I <br/>
was never told I could take something interesting right off the bat, <br/>
and because I was so used to the whole system, from an early age, I <br/>
never even thought to ask.  Now isn&#39;t THAT pathetic.  My money, <br/>
their rules really.  Not much different than the whole American <br/>
attitude about education, I think.  Just more of the same.  Only now <br/>
you have to pay a lot of money to be there.  The &quot;survey&quot; courses <br/>
they have freshmans take are sort of broad interest surveys of a <br/>
field, supposedly to give you an idea about a particular field of <br/>
study.  I just thought they were dumb, and a whole lot of them are <br/>
required.  You can&#39;t even get to your major interest until you&#39;ve <br/>
about taken two years of the general stuff that has you half <br/>
snoozing most of the time.  Maybe they figure if you get enough rest <br/>
the first two years you&#39;ll be ready to stay up all night looking <br/>
into something interesting the last two, but I doubt it.  It&#39;s just <br/>
a huge waste of time and money.  They assume that no 18 year old <br/>
(usual age to start college) could possibly know what they&#39;d be <br/>
interested in studying, and has to therefore look at every <br/>
possibility and make a selection.  Unfortunately, the selection they <br/>
choose from doesn&#39;t do much for stirring up the fires or anything.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128258295">I worked for 11 years in a Graduate Business Library at a &quot;major&quot;<br/>
university.  -grin-  This place turned out MBA&#39;s in eleven months so they<br/>
were all stressed to the gills.<br/>
<br/>
One day one of the administrators of the school came down and wanted me to<br/>
do some research for her.  Now, I was the only one there, couldn&#39;t really do<br/>
it that second and didn&#39;t make it clear that it wasn&#39;t that I wouldn&#39;t, but<br/>
that it would have to wait.  And I did show HER how to do it, if she really<br/>
couldn&#39;t wait.<br/>
<br/>
She left in a huff and complained which raised all kinds of stinks.  -sigh-<br/>
Ask me if I miss this place.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my supervisor was away and HER supervisor thought this was a big<br/>
enough deal to come down and lecture me on my job.  (Big mistake on her<br/>
part, frankly, but...)  She told me that when someone came in looking for<br/>
this information, I was to give it to them.<br/>
<br/>
I refused.  I said, for the administrator, sure, that was just a<br/>
misunderstanding, BUT and this was a big BUT, our job was to teach those<br/>
grad students HOW TO FIND THIS INFORMATION THEMSELVES.  That was the whole<br/>
point of the bloody MBA.  If they walked out of there learning only to call<br/>
the library and not: what the resources where, which ones were best and why,<br/>
and how to find the info if it wasn&#39;t already in some easy format then what<br/>
was the point.<br/>
<br/>
I stood my ground and she seemed to understand.<br/>
<br/>
But for me, this was a huge realization about LEARNING.  Getting the grade,<br/>
getting the degree, etc is meaningless without the actual knowledge.  My<br/>
husband is an amazing intuitive programer.  He understands computers in a<br/>
way I will never ever get.  He didn&#39;t get a college degree, instead his<br/>
knowledge is based on actually using the machines on a daily (sometimes 24<br/>
hours a day) basis.  I gave up any interest in finishing my degree around<br/>
the time of that incident.  Instead I devoted myself to improving my craft<br/>
(writing) in a more meaningful way---actually writing.<br/>
<br/>
As so many have said--if college is your goal, there are ways to do it that<br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;standard.&quot;  If a well paying, stable career is your goal--there are<br/>
ways to do it.<br/>

I have a miniature one, too that they gave us all.  Laminated.  I forget <br/>
whose advertising is on the back.  A mortuary, I think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used that one a few times (year back; I&#39;m not carrying it around <br/>
anymore, but I DID!)<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico, Epanola is that town about which all the jokes are made, and <br/>
it&#39;s like the cartoon, charicature, ignorant violent little town.   It might <br/>
not be fair (I can name several towns way worse, but without the character to <br/>
even make jokes about, which might be the deal), but the reality is real. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So...  Sometimes I would know someone a while and when they finally asked <br/>
where I was from and I said &quot;Espanola,&quot; they would get a slack-faced look <br/>
like they were waiting to see if I was joking, and say &quot;No you&#39;re not.&quot;  <br/>
(Because if I was it messed up their Espanola prejudice.)  So I would MERRILY <br/>
whip out my Espanola High School miniature laminated diploma.     It was fun.<br/>
<br/>
But the real one nobody&#39;s ever asked to see.  And my college degree <br/>
piece-of-paper-in-folder, never shown it to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Here, about degrees, for some state jobs you have to have a degree.  They <br/>
don&#39;t care WHAT degree, just a BA or a BS degree.  Sometimes the jobs require <br/>
NOTHING learned in college, it&#39;s just basically a culling process.  You&#39;ve <br/>
proven you had the dull patience to live through four years or more of <br/>
college, so maybe you&#39;ll be passive and cooperative enough to work for the <br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
So if a kid is convinced he needs a college degree, have him go for something <br/>
interesting, entertaining, joyous.  <br/>

papers to fill out for next year, her last, as to what classes they want to <br/>
take. She has all her science requirements now but thought an added science <br/>
class would look good to a college. If she chooses to take another science, <br/>
for her it would have to be physics as she&#39;s taking advanced chemistry this <br/>
year. Well I know Tara and I know physics and I&#39;m thinking to myself, this <br/>
will really be hard one for her to take. Plus she&#39;s only thinking of it <br/>
because of what her friend told her colleges look at. She doesn&#39;t really <br/>
WANT to take it. She&#39;s already taking other classes that are extra that she <br/>
said will &quot;look good&quot; for her. She wants to go to college for business, so <br/>
why physicas, right? So after some talking and discussing, she has decided <br/>
to take an extra business course next year instead. I&#39;m glad she came to <br/>
this decision. Makes no sense to take something she doesn&#39;t like and that <br/>
will cause her to make her last year a tough one. I think she should just <br/>
come home and party, but what do I know??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047781150">**After talking a while to find out what brought on this math attack he<br/>
<br/>
told me he was upset because his shop teacher was trying to figure out<br/>
<br/>
how they were going to complete 140 credit hours in 44 days at 2 1/2<br/>
<br/>
hours a day. Another student did the math instantly while my son had to<br/>
<br/>
think about it. My fault! He doesn&#39;t want to have to think about it. He<br/>
<br/>
wants to be able to do the math instantly. I told him that the other guy<br/>
<br/>
probably does math every day, and if he had to do it every day he be<br/>
<br/>
quicker too.**<br/>
<br/>
Nope. :) If that were true the shop teacher would&#39;ve been the first one to <br/>
the answer, not the other student. The truth is, if your son wants to be able <br/>
to do math instantly, he probably needs to be reincarnated with a different <br/>
brain. :) It&#39;s got nothing to do with how often you work with it or how hard <br/>
you try or any of that. Some people can do it. Some can&#39;t. Some need paper to <br/>
organize their thoughts, others can do it in their heads. Of those who can do <br/>
arithematic in their heads with ease, some can do it instantly and most need <br/>
a few seconds.<br/>
<br/>
He can probably learn to be more comfortable with math if he wants to try it, <br/>
but he shouldn&#39;t expect to change his brain type. He should try taking an end <br/>
run around his fears by playing around with math in new ways.<br/>
<br/>
**I &#39;m still worried about him and his fears, it&#39;s not good to be thinking <br/>
like this at his age.**<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fearful time. MOST teens get scared about how they&#39;re going to manage <br/>
on their own. It&#39;s not specific to unschooled kids. Not all parents get to <br/>
hear about them, though. It depends how much the kids trust them. <br/>
<br/>
You support them in figuring it out, thinking about it, deciding what the <br/>
fears mean and what to do about them, what plan they might want to follow. <br/>
Don&#39;t let them abuse you in their fear. If you ARE guilty of something, <br/>
accept the responsibility, but you&#39;re probably not.<br/>

He can do consumer math when he wants to buy something. He can figure out<br/>
percentages when it comes to taxes and sale prices. He knows a deal when<br/>
comparing prices and quantities. It seems he freezes up only under<br/>
pressure, school kinda stuff. This, now that I&#39;m really thinking about<br/>
it, could be a war wound from back when I tried to force him to &quot;do<br/>
math&quot;. Did I scar him for life? I gave him a math puzzle the other day<br/>
when he asked for some stuff to practice with. He ended up scribbling<br/>
curses across the paper. I seriously think he&#39;s got a mental block when<br/>
it comes to paper math. I asked him not to finish it because it hurt to<br/>
see him get frustrated. I ended up doing it with him and it turned out<br/>
ok, it even seemed like he enjoyed it then.<br/>

When I was his age that was the farthest thing from my mind. Then again<br/>
there wasn&#39;t to much in my mind and I didn&#39;t talk to my parents. I&#39;m glad<br/>
my kids like me, and love that they talk to me.<br/>

<br/>
I AM guilty. It&#39;s probably my fault he doesn&#39;t like doing math. I so<br/>
believed in unschooling for many years but living in PA up until 3 yrs<br/>
ago I felt like a wannabe. I needed to keep a portfolio with samples of<br/>
&quot;school&quot; work to show the SD each year. Every subject but math and<br/>
writing were easy to deal with. We made a game of it, it was like a <br/>
yearlong scavenger hunt to find fluffy educational looking stuff to stick<br/>
in it. I took zillions of pictures of all the cool stuff we did and<br/>
picked up pamphlets at all the places we visited. Math and writing were<br/>
the evil subjects though. I swear I tried to make it fun but besides<br/>
pictures of the kids doing stuff like measuring, building, and shopping,<br/>
I needed paper work. I figured out how to minimalize the &quot;have to&quot; work<br/>
but the damage was still done. They didn&#39;t like to do it but they did it<br/>
anyway. I told them it had to be done for the damn book. Maybe my<br/>
negative attitude made it worst or maybe the fact they weren&#39;t enjoying<br/>
it gave me a negative attitude but it sucked either way. BTW  none of my<br/>
children like paperwork. Then again many adults don&#39;t like paperwork so<br/>
maybe it&#39;s normal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL. I certainly don&#39;t want you to look up that work either since it <br/>
was at the beginning of my writing career and while it passed <br/>
muster, it&#39;s not my favorite work either. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the founder is now dead and the denom is not really <br/>
major (I was standing in the shower laughing later that night <br/>
thinking, why did I say that? That&#39;s because in our evangelical <br/>
world, it was an international movement that really felt major. It&#39;s <br/>
been profiled on the news, 60 minutes and other places...). so <br/>
for the curious: I wrote for John Wimber of the Vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
And he couldn&#39;t write worth beans. He used to joke abut it like <br/>
this: &quot;I wrote that book about as much as I&#39;ve written any book <br/>
which is to say Julie wrote that book.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think it isn&#39;t even intended to prove that one is &quot;smart&quot;, just that<br/>
one is docile and house-broken.  (Which is exactly what you said.  I agree.) <br/>

(Not that grade points prove intelligence.  I had a 3.0 when I graduated, I <br/>
think, and that&#39;s because I went from being baffled and then goofing around <br/>
to getting a 4.0.  But the curve/path/progress doesn&#39;t show.  Someone who <br/>
started off with a 4.0 and ended up sliding into a drug and booze gutter <br/>
could have the same 3.0.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654074422">I said **Nope. :) If that were true the shop teacher would&#39;ve been the first <br/>
one to the answer, not the other student.**<br/>
<br/>
And Sharon asks **How do you figure?**<br/>
<br/>
It was the shop teacher trying to figure it out, wasn&#39;t it? It didn&#39;t sound <br/>
like he was throwing it out as a problem for the students, he needed to know <br/>
it himself and those two students happened to be there at the time. Anyway, a <br/>
shop teacher has real life uses for arithematic every working day - <br/>
measurements, tolerances, dimensions - if it came faster just from use he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have needed the students help. It probably is far from the first <br/>
time he&#39;s needed to figure out credit hours, either.<br/>
<br/>
**It seems he freezes up only under pressure, school kinda stuff. This, now <br/>
that I&#39;m really thinking about it, could be a war wound from back when I <br/>
tried to force him to &quot;do math&quot;. Did I scar him for life? I gave him a math <br/>
puzzle the other day when he asked for some stuff to practice with. He ended <br/>
up scribbling curses across the paper. I seriously think he&#39;s got a mental <br/>
block when it comes to paper math. I asked him not to finish it because it <br/>
hurt to see him get frustrated. I ended up doing it with him and it turned out<br/>
<br/>
ok, it even seemed like he enjoyed it then.**<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son was in school for 6 years. He&#39;s the reason none of his younger <br/>
siblings went to school. (Well, my 18yo is taking community college classes <br/>
now, but they don&#39;t count as school. Another topic. &lt;g&gt;) Anyway... when I <br/>
took him out of school it was so I could stop fighting with him over math. I <br/>
recognize your scenario there. Did you scar him for life? Maybe.  The <br/>
question  is, now what? You point out what he can do. You point out later <br/>
when he&#39;s done okay on some arithematic thing without getting frustrated. You <br/>
help him figure out how to avoid letting the &quot;math phobic screaming paranoid&quot; <br/>
loose in his head. :=) You do more of those puzzles with him and don&#39;t ever <br/>
hand him one to do alone again for awhile. I&#39;ll think of more, eventually.<br/>
<br/>
**It&#39;s a fearful time. MOST teens get scared about how they&#39;re going to <br/>
manage on their own. It&#39;s not specific to unschooled kids. Not all parents <br/>
get to hear about them, though. It depends how much the kids trust them.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**When I was his age that was the farthest thing from my mind. Then again <br/>

kids like me, and love that they talk to me.**<br/>
<br/>
:) Yeah. It&#39;s interesting, I get to hear not only my own kid&#39;s fears, but <br/>
those of a lot of the teens she interacts with. She processes a lot of <br/>
conversations for herself by going over them with me later. Most of her local <br/>
friends and aquaintances are always-schooled. Lately I hear a lot about <br/>
college. Kids who can&#39;t imagine not going to college because they don&#39;t know <br/>
who they are outside of their student role. Kids who have to go to college or <br/>
move out and be on their own, no support of any kind for any other path. Kids <br/>
who are searching for colleges as far from home as they can get. It&#39;s sad <br/>
that I&#39;m not hearing about a single one who&#39;s excited about going to college <br/>
for what they can learn there. Another interesting thing - she&#39;s getting a <br/>
hard time from some of those same kids because her plans don&#39;t include <br/>
college right now - not in the four years get a degree way, she&#39;s taking <br/>
classes that interest her, but all of them see that as &quot;different&quot; than going <br/>
to college. If she was at the CC with a career plan that would be &quot;going to <br/>
college&quot;. :)<br/>
<br/>
As for the fears, I was thinking of that not only because of conversations <br/>
with my daughter, but because I just finished a book &quot;The Myth of Maturity&quot; <br/>
that talks about the fears and needs of kids at the leaving home ages. I <br/>
recommend it to anyone thinking their kids would be more confident and secure <br/>
if they&#39;d gone to school. :)<br/>
