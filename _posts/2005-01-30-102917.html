<div id="ygrps-yiv-552416562">How does one introduce long division to a 10y.o unschooler?<br/>
My son met another boy, who brought up long division in their<br/>
conversation.  My son now wants to know how to do this.  When<br/>
I think about how to go about it, all I can come up w/is needing<br/>
to know your times tables to figure out the equation.  <br/>
If only long division were part of yu-gi-oh, there&#39;d be no <br/>
problem :)! thanks for any ideas you have.   krista</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935708405">You can print out a chart of all the multiplication facts form lots of<br/>
places online, or just make one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d start by relating it to division, and figuring out whether or not he<br/>
understands what the arithmetic operation called division is about.. and<br/>
then explain that long division is a way to figure out division problems<br/>
involving large numbers, like numbers over 100 divided by numbers over<br/>
10. <br/>
<br/>
If he was still interested after that, I&#39;d whip out the chart and begin<br/>
showing him how the algorithm works.<br/>
<br/>
If it seemed to me like he wasn&#39;t interested and was just wanting to<br/>
learn it because he felt like he should know it beause his friend did,<br/>
I&#39;d point out that there are many other ways to figure out problems like<br/>
this, including a calculator, and that it&#39;s one of those things that<br/>
schools seem to value highly for whatever reason, but it&#39;s really not a<br/>
big deal. That&#39;s my opinion, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s asking because it sounds cool and interesting, then I&#39;d just keep<br/>
explaining until he&#39;s done hearing about it.<br/>
