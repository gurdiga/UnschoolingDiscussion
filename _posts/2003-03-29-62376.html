<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371825818">Unschooling is learning through life, which is utterly and completely <br/>
about connections. I&#39;ve heard Sandra say it&#39;s like dot to dots....<br/>
So here is my personal cool connection for the week.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE Tom Petty and have been listening to him all week.<br/>
His song &quot;Casa Dega&quot; prompted me to look up where this place was and <br/>
whether it was fictional or not. I figured it was a place in <br/>
California. What I found was it is a place in Florida (perhaps there <br/>
is one in Cali too) that boasts the most mediums and phsycics in one <br/>
town in the entire U.S.<br/>
There is a spiritualist camp all year and interestingly enough, they <br/>
teach the Course in Miracles, which is part of New Thought beliefs. <br/>
Interesting for me because I started going to Unity this last year.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo....I thought the whole Casadega thing was really neat when I <br/>
read the lyrics of the song again.<br/>
Especially this part:<br/>
<br/>
She said, to me and she holds my hand<br/>
And reads the lives of a stranger<br/>
Yeah, and she knows my name<br/>
Yeah, she knows my plans<br/>
In the past, in present and for the future<br/>
<br/>
Oh honey, I think I&#39;m starting to believe the things that I heard<br/>
&#39;Cause tonight in Casa Dega, I hang on every word<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You think Tom Petty has been to Cassadega Florida?<br/>
Sure makes me wonder. :) Cool connection.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938057406">Tom Petty is from Gainesville FL, my hometown.  Went to my high school<br/>
(about 15 years before me, of course.)  And yea, I&#39;d bet he&#39;s been to<br/>
Casadega.  My stepmom has, too.  Some day I&#39;ll have to get her to take me.<br/>
Funky place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557098838">Ok, I&#39;m not big into getting all googly eyed over famous people, but I DID <br/>
get to see the President (Ronald Reagan at the time) and the Pope meet. That was <br/>
pretty cool.<br/>
They both came to good &#39;ol Squarebanks Alaska (God knows why) in the 80&#39;s and <br/>
it was a very big deal. I remember we all lined up outside my High school to <br/>
watch Reagan drive by, he was smiling and waving through a window. He was on <br/>
his way to the University to speak.<br/>
<br/>
And I walked right past Tom Skirrit (sp?) at Pikes street market one time. <br/>
Nobody was bothering him, he was just being a regular guy. I could have reached <br/>
over and grabbed his arm. I thought my sis was going to pass out!<br/>
<br/>
While living in Portland I ran into a LOT of the Trail Blazers. Jerome Kersey <br/>
dated two different friends of mine (had a child with one) and came into the <br/>
health club we worked at all the time.  Duckworth held a door open for me <br/>
once...:) funny.<br/>
I don&#39;t suppose anyone remembers basketball players from the early 90&#39;s <br/>
though. <br/>

<br/>
Even way back, way way back in high school, I never went for blonds either.<br/>
Always dark. That&#39;s why I go nuts when I see Oded Fehr in the Mummy. All<br/>
that dark mysterious black thing going on!! I was surfing through the cable<br/>
tonight after everyone was in bed. Guess what I found??? The Mummy Returns.<br/>
You bet I watched!!!!<br/>
<br/>
And (sigh) my blond moments are gone. I got bored again and went way dark.<br/>
At first medium brown which I loved. Got so much attention when I went out<br/>
why wouldn&#39;t I love it? Now the blond is coming through already and it&#39;s a<br/>
brown/auburn color. Still nice but getting too light. I have a box of dark<br/>
brown in the bathroom waiting for the right time!! It might be tomorrow.<br/>

My husband is blond.  When he was young (and when we were first together he <br/>
was 21) he was REALLY blond.  Now it&#39;s dark blond and grey, but still...<br/>
<br/>
I like hairy guys.  He was hairy in some good places, but it was invisible.  <br/>
I&#39;d felt it, so I  knew where it all was.    (Oh---waist-length hair and a big <br/>
beard, but that wasn&#39;t the kind of hair I&#39;m thinking of.)<br/>
<br/>
Then I met his oldest brother.   Same hair patterns, but DARK hair.  I could <br/>
hardly take my eyes off him at family gatherings.  If they were helping their <br/>
dad and Gerry took his shirt off, COOL for me!!<br/>
<br/>
Keith thought it was funny.  That&#39;s good. &lt;g&gt;  It was just a kind of fantasy <br/>
of what Keith would look like if he didn&#39;t have invisible body hair.   <br/>
