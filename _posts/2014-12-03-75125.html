<div>I have a daughter, 12, and a son, 10, who went to public school until 2.5 
years ago.&nbsp; The main reason my daughter left school was due to social 
distress.&nbsp; Not just with one group, person or situation but a general, 
pervasive unhappiness.&nbsp; I offered to homeschool my daughter if she 
preferred to leave school &amp; it was during this period that I discovered 
Unschooling.&nbsp; What a gift Unschooling has been to our entire family.&nbsp; 
My son left school shortly after my daughter and our family has been blissfully 
healing and exploring ever since.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are a family of shy, introverted people.&nbsp; We don&#39;t do a lot of 
socializing as a family and we are all usually content to be at home with each 
other and our various interests, hobbies, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of my kids has 
one special friend that they socialize with one on one&nbsp;but we don&#39;t seem to 
have much opportunity for socializing in large groups.&nbsp; We live in a small 
community with an even smaller homeschool community and none of us have clicked 
with anyone in that small circle.&nbsp; My daughter has a nice group 
of&nbsp;girls that she enjoys&nbsp;skyping and gaming with online.&nbsp; My son 
does not.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Late this summer, around her 12th birthday, my daughter started to express 
a deep sense of boredom with everything that she had previously been interested 
in.&nbsp; I spent time &amp; resources doing new things with her and trying to 
help her find a new spark &amp; new ideas/interests.&nbsp; Her best friend had 
started home schooling about 1 1/2 years after we did which had worked out 
nicely for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;This spring the&nbsp;friend&#39;s little brother had a 
very serious health&nbsp;condition that required the mom &amp; brother to stay 
in and near the hospital 2 hours away&nbsp;for the past 6 months or&nbsp;so. As 
a result, the friend returned to school late this summer.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This year is the 1st year of middle school for the kids Jade went to school 
with.&nbsp; That means all the kids from the surrounding elementary schools are 
funneled into a larger school.&nbsp; New building, new kids, changing classes 
during the day,&nbsp;25 minute bus ride at the beginning and end of each 
day.&nbsp; My daughter&#39;s friend went back and loved it.&nbsp; She told&nbsp;my 
daughter&nbsp;all about how awesome it was and Jade decided this was an 
experience she did not want to miss.&nbsp; She has been back in school since 
mid-September and in general&nbsp;she is having a blast (not that she is loving 
every aspect of her experience but she seems to be adept at compartmentalizing 
the more negative aspects.&nbsp; So far, anyway).&nbsp; I have had quite 
a&nbsp;few mixed emotions about it and have spent quite a bit of time in 
reflection but the bottom line is that she&#39;s enjoying it &amp;&nbsp;knows each 
day that she is going by choice.&nbsp; I understand that my role is to support 
her in every way that I can with this chosen activity, even if it wouldn&#39;t 
be&nbsp;my first choice of activities for her.&nbsp; Actually it has been pretty 
interesting to watch her.&nbsp; Her approach to school&nbsp;is so different from 
the kids who are there because they have to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Jade comes home each day filled with stories of her experiences at 
school.&nbsp; Primarily the stories are about the other kids and silly things 
they said or did.&nbsp; My son hears these stories and feels like he is missing 
out on all of that fun.&nbsp; Jade is clear about the idea that her primary 
reason for being in school is to socialize.&nbsp; She is in a phase where she 
likes to be loud and have funny things trigger uncontrollable laughing fits that 
go on for several minutes.&nbsp; The bus rides to and from school seem to her to 
be a particularly good outlet for this.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All of&nbsp;Jade&#39;s stories and uproarious laughter trigger a curiosity and 
a certain amount of jealousy&nbsp;for her brother.&nbsp; He is thinking that he 
would like to try going back to school next year, middle school for him.&nbsp; I 
am fine with him doing that if he wants to but I do have some concerns about how 
well that environment will fit with his temperament as a long term 
experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;He &amp; I&nbsp;were just talking about it and he was 
expressing that he doesn&#39;t really want to be in school but he thinks that 
it&nbsp;is the only way for him to get those fun social experiences.&nbsp; He 
does play baseball and football but he is shy around the other boys and mainly 
sticks by his buddy/safety net.&nbsp; Jade does the same thing at school with 
her friend when she is able to.&nbsp; But the other girl&#39;s mother has expressed 
that she intends to homeschool the friend again next year, now that the brother 
is doing well.&nbsp; And I don&#39;t know&nbsp;how much say the girl will 
have&nbsp;in the matter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I do not have a way of providing the social atmosphere of school at home, 
as far as I can see.&nbsp; I think my kids are seeing &quot;having friends&quot; in a 
schoolish context.&nbsp; That to &quot;socialize &amp; have friends&quot; should look like 
it does in school.&nbsp; I guess that&#39;s what it boils down to.&nbsp; So is there 
a way to help them deschool this idea?&nbsp; I think one of the things they like 
about socializing in the school environment is that being in that setting makes 
it easier to be with other people without the pressure of having more than brief 
one to one interactions.&nbsp; For Jade, she seems to observe a lot and talk 
directly to other people only once in a while.&nbsp; Does that make sense?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for your insight,</div>
<div>Cass</div></html></div>

I understand that you guys had not unschooled for long and she was just recovering and starting to heal and went back to school.<br>But still it is her choice.<br><br>This also may change if her best friend does come home next year. While she is at school I would make her life very sweet and make her brother&#39;s life ( who is at home) even more sweet and fun so she sees that it could be awesome to be home.<br><br>I think she really loves to be around other girls and boys. Maybe find groups to get involved that would fill that need so she does not need to go to school to meet kids in a regular basis. <br>I know you said you guys like to stay home but maybe that was not working for her.<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1412738559yui_3_16_0_1_1418404780869_4819" dir="ltr">She did like to talk about all the social aspects of school with my daughter. She told my daughter about the popular kids in school.&nbsp; Gigi , who had always said she wanted to see how school was, did go to school one day a couple months ago.<br><br>She loved the social aspect.&nbsp; She met a girls she clicked and loved it.<br>Lucky Girls Scouts, 4H started again and we got busy with more kids and she was happy to be home. She does like to be busy and be with other kids and if I get complacent ( as I like to be home a lot)&nbsp; she does not get her needs met.<br><br>I cannot say Jade won&#39;t be hurt or harmed from being in school but this is her choice and supporting her and making her life so wonderful outside school I am pretty sure is your best option&nbsp; and&nbsp; much different than her not having a choice or a supportive home .

insecurities are increasing. &nbsp;Her asthma has been getting steadily worse &amp; it seems we&#39;re back to needing nightly nebulizer treatments. &nbsp;That is a return to where we were when she was in school before. &nbsp;When we were deep into unschooling she almost never had trouble with her asthma.</span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.859375px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.859375px;">Two nights ago she was writing something for instagram &amp;

she should try not to take it personally. &nbsp;I said that everybody probably feels that way sometimes but reminded her that she does have people who care about her there. &nbsp;She&#39;s not sure about that. &nbsp;There seems to be so much negativity in her life now. &nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.859375px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#444444" face="Georgia" size="2"><span style="line-height:15.859375px;">When she first went to school she would mainly talk about the fun things. &nbsp;That has gradually transitioned to more negativity and insecurity. &nbsp;And it&#39;s hard to watch. &nbsp;I will be a bright light for her full of love, acceptance &amp;

hope for other opportunities she might be willing to try. &nbsp;In less than 2 years she will be able to get a part time job &amp; I think that is something that holds promise.</span></font></div><div><font face="HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif"><span style="line-height:19.515625px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif"><span style="line-height:19.515625px;">I think that she would be more likely to join a group if I were the leader of the group. &nbsp;I&#39;m willing to start a new group if that helps her. &nbsp;Maybe a new 4H troop? &nbsp;(She&#39;s done the girl scouts &amp;

then she changes her mind we are in an uncomfortable spot. &nbsp;And so much depends on which other kids join. &nbsp;She has strong opinions about who she wants to spend her time with. &nbsp;The older the kids get the more difficult it seems to be to find a group. &nbsp;Are there other groups or social activities that people have had success with for kids around the 12 year range?</span></font></div><div><br></div><div>I wish I had some kind of magic wand that would make everything easy and happy for her but since I do not I will continue to be grateful for the wonderful unschooling tools and people that I do have access to. &nbsp;I am so, so grateful for that. &nbsp;I will continue to look for outside opportunities and interests for her. &nbsp;Most importantly I will continue to be here for her with a big hug &amp; a big smile. &nbsp;She does know that she has choices and she knows she&#39;s not alone, which is huge. &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;One thing that I do know for sure is that things are always changing for her and this is just a difficult spot we are in right now, it&#39;s not forever.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for listening to my rambling. &nbsp;:-) &lt;3 &lt;3</div><div>-Cass</div><div><font face="HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif"><span style="line-height:19.515625px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif"><span style="line-height:19.515625px;"><br></span></font></div></div>

<div dir='ltr'>Quick update - Angelina (the friend) was here yesterday so I asked the 3 kids about the idea of some kind of gaming group &amp; they&#39;re into it! &nbsp;Jade asked &quot;Can we do it right now?&quot;. &nbsp;:-) It was already 4pm so I told her it was a little late but we could start figuring out the details if they wanted. &nbsp;We quickly came up with a guest list, a list of game ideas, some food ideas &amp; a date. &nbsp;(This coming Friday.) &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>We made the invitations already &amp; ended up calling it a &quot;Gamers Gathering&quot;. &nbsp;We&#39;ll see how it goes and make necessary adjustments as we go. &nbsp;They&#39;re excited &amp; so am I!!! &nbsp;It feels so much better to be doing something active to try to improve life than it did sitting around worrying about it!! &nbsp;<br><div><br>Thanks so much,</div><div>Cass<br><div><div style="color:#fff;height:0;"></div>
