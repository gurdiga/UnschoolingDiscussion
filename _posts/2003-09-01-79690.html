<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Our schools here started while we were in SC. Brian&#39;s been going through a difficult, clingy period for the past few weeks, and it was only within DAYS of school&#39;s starting that I realized (kinda like I<br/>
&gt; realized on my dd&#39;s 6 week b&#39;day that I&#39;d be back to work now if following the mainstream) that he would (mainstream) *have to* go to K NOW.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That would have been a disaster. Some other time it would be merely a very bad thing, but this particular month it would be at least triple bad, but we&#39;d feel we had no choice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to everyone here, everyone at unschooling.com, and all homeschoolers everywhere for letting us know we HAVE A CHOICE!<br/>

&gt; &gt; This morning, while reading the newspaper and drinking coffee and waiting for<br/>
&gt; &gt; my kids to wake up, I saw the parade of parents and children trekking down<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the first day of public school.  Catholic schools started yesterday, but my<br/>
&gt; &gt; neighbors drive instead of walking, so it&#39;s less of a spectacle. </span></blockquote></div>
