<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819272485">Thanks, Ned for your insights and for the fascinating history of<br/>
education in CT. My family lives there now and I have been curious about<br/>
it in light of the strong homeschool community and resistance to<br/>
legislative incursions there. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The law covering education in Connecticut (where Luz and I have lived for<br/>
&gt; several years) says that parents (and/or guardians) are responsible for<br/>
&gt; their children&#39;s education. That law was written in 1650 and is still in<br/>
&gt; effect. The law acknowledges the natural, sacred, unalienable RIGHT and duty<br/>
&gt; that parents have in the raising of their children -- education being part<br/>
&gt; of that upbringing. As this group and others remind us, homeschooling (at<br/>
&gt; least learning) goes on in every home in the world -- so what are your kids<br/>
&gt; learning?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In CT, homeschooling has been an accepted practice for over 350 years. In<br/>
&gt; fact, it was so universal in the early days that when towns organized Common<br/>
&gt; Schools, the schools often did not accept children unless they already knew<br/>
&gt; how to read, write  and calculate -- skills that were presumed to have been<br/>
&gt; taught at home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sooo makes sense to me! Kids learned how to read, write and reckon<br/>
at home - where these things were put to practical use and incorporated<br/>
into everyday necessity! THen, if they had those skills, they could a<br/>
attend school - and I take it from you farther info that these &quot;COmmon<br/>
Schools&quot; were not compulsory since you say in CT there IS no compulsory<br/>
attendance law. I always had a gut feeling that the present way was a<br/>
distortion of Actually this fills a big hole in my understanding of the<br/>
evolution of education.  Then it is a choice to go to a school. Many<br/>
homeschoolers do eventually go to a college to learn things they want to<br/>
learn - and many even an unschooler brags about this. IT is just<br/>
cotton-pickin&#39; loco to trap kids in warehouses where they can&#39;t move,<br/>
can&#39;t talk and can&#39;t even think for themselves if they participate! And<br/>
as you say, teachers now are trained to &quot;therapize&quot; and refer to<br/>
professionals kids who don&#39;t learn under these circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Similarly, when a child needs (wants ! ) to learn how to read, such as in<br/>
&gt; the recent example of the smaller sister asking her older sibling in bed how<br/>
&gt; to say certain words that she pointed to on the page, such as HOP, one<br/>
&gt; person was helping the other to learn. It is not unusual that parents are<br/>
&gt; surprised by the abilities of their kids -- without any teaching. The reason<br/>
&gt; we are surprised sometimes is that we believe that learning is difficult and<br/>
&gt; takes a lot of teaching. That is the garbage that schools want us to<br/>
&gt; believe, so that we will maintain support for all their employees and<br/>
&gt; outrageous budgets.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As an unschooler (a staunch, radical, fanatical one) I am vehemently against<br/>
&gt; schooling -- the kind that is done in schools, and is directed by schoolers<br/>
&gt; for the benefit of the school establishment -- not the children. But that<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t mean I am against learning or even teaching, so long as it is asked<br/>
&gt; for by the learner.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, no restrictions ---- people learn by themselves, people learn from<br/>
each other, people teach each other. The heck with any arbitrary and<br/>
artificial confusing of the definition of the word &quot;teach&quot; with modern<br/>
connotations associated with it... from the degradation occurring in<br/>
schools obviously.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;School&quot; is actually derived from the Greek word for &quot;leisure&quot;, the time<br/>
spared from working and fighting. Those who could walked about with<br/>
PLato in his academy in the woods and talked of things, learned from him<br/>
and from their discussions. THere is another separate word &quot;school&quot; with<br/>
an entirely different derivation and meaning that seems to have become<br/>
mixed with the other&quot;school&quot;. A &quot;school&quot; of fish came from words for<br/>
division into groups for the same type of creature. Now we&#39;ve got<br/>
divisions into age groups, levels of readers and &quot;learners&quot;, &quot;at-risk&quot;<br/>
students, &quot;learning-disabled&quot; groups, phewwey! Free them all, parents!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My point is that UNschooling is a personal idea. Today&#39;s practice comes<br/>
&gt; primarily from the work and books of John Holt, who told us years ago that<br/>
&gt; the trouble with education is the schooling, the boring, life-crushing<br/>
&gt; tedium, the sit-down-shut-up-listen-to-this madness that drives kids crazy,<br/>
&gt; especially when there&#39;s so little that those places teach and how quickly<br/>
&gt; most kids can learn it ALL so that they can go out and play and discover how<br/>
&gt; the world really works.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What&#39;s my point...let&#39;s not thrash each other for not UNschooling. I am not<br/>
&gt; Anti-Unschooling, but I am also not Anti-teaching when a kid asks for that.<br/>
&gt; Purity in unschooling (as some understand it, as *no teaching no matter<br/>
&gt; what*) is as much the enemy of learning as school is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I think when the words teach and learn are too arbitrarily<br/>
defined, it makes people stop thinking and looking at what goes on in<br/>
front of them in life, and rather promotes operating based on a dogmatic<br/>
theory instead. Hmm... perhaps &quot;feeding&quot; is a bad word because it<br/>
implies a power of the one with the food that is enforced on the one who<br/>
does or doesn&#39;t want food at the time. If a little child wants food and<br/>
can&#39;t have it then, or doesn&#39;t want food when it is &quot;fed&quot; to him,<br/>
wouldn&#39;t the world be a better place if parents not only just let the<br/>
child &quot;eat&quot; when and what he wants to, but also never say &quot;I fed him.&quot; -<br/>
but only said &quot;he ate&quot;.And then have rules like never to say something<br/>
like &quot;All the people coming on our picnic will need to be &quot;fed&quot; -but<br/>
have to say &quot;The people coming will need to eat --because we&#39;ll forget<br/>
to be polite and caring and let them choose how much to eat and what<br/>
they prefer out of what we bring, if we  don&#39;t say it that way.<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically, what is available in the environment and what people<br/>
are doing around one always has a bearing on what people will learn. If<br/>
it is a rich environment with choices, kids can choose things. If not<br/>
much is going on or talked about or available it becomes tougher for a<br/>
kid to expand as much as they potentially could. So perhaps parents who<br/>
are unschooling and get antsy with that could dive into learning<br/>
themselves more and expanding where they go, what they read, what they<br/>
do - and how much they discuss, think and listen. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it possible that some parents don&#39;t know HOW to teach what their child<br/>
&gt; wants to know? Sure, it happens a lot. That&#39;s when they need to become<br/>
&gt; learners right along with the child. <br/>
&gt; Ned Vare<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, that is the secret (to non-homeschoolers) delight of homeschooling. you get too learn all kinds of things too which you might not have if you were stuck in an office.... ahhh, what pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Homeschooling days with my daughter were most often like this:<br/>
<br/>
Stay up past midnight reading in bed. Get up around 10 AM. Feed the<br/>
animals (oops, should I say &quot;facilitated the animals eating&quot;?), snack or<br/>
make pancakes, curl up and finish the book. Have a leisurely discussion<br/>
about people and occurrences in the book and real-life people they<br/>
reminded us of. Remembrances of things past. Go for a walk to the duck<br/>
pond and feed the ducks (oops, I mean &quot;Let the ducks eat the crackers we<br/>
had.&quot;.. My daughter spent hours pouring over the mail order chicken<br/>
catalog deciding which chickens to order and which combinations of<br/>
chickens would give her the best deal on the neatest chickens - and<br/>
whether to buy separate chickens or the advertised mixed specials (hours<br/>
of math here). THen she might dictate a story to me that I would write<br/>
into a nice blank book and she then illustrated. Dress up in costumes<br/>
with friends and play. GO to the store and see if they had any unusual<br/>
fruits or vegetables we didn&#39;t know, and buy stuff to stock up. Back<br/>
home, eat, and maybe play a little chess or a card game like<br/>
multiplication war. Then start a new book and stay up late reading it.<br/>
<br/>
And so it went, with plenty of trips to beach, camping, exploring - dad<br/>
actually had a systemic plan to visit every park and green spot on the<br/>
map of our area. Once we took a train trip to a nearby city for the<br/>
afternoon and came back. Science museum, art museums, bookstore. Talking<br/>
together. She saw the projects I did reading the laws for a citizens&#39;<br/>
rights group, and I&#39;d tell her about the alerts I was writing and she<br/>
told me to go ahead and do it, it was important. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t always rosy; dad changed businesses and moved it into our<br/>
house and it grew to a bunch of employees which made it very noisy and<br/>
no space at home, but eventually that changed again and he got an office<br/>
and we lived through it. <br/>
<br/>
Now my daughter is almost 16 and attends the college near us for art and<br/>
pottery classes, does computer graphics, and has a boyfriend who takes<br/>
alot of her time. She is reading a history of philosophy with<br/>
philosophers from Greek to modern - that happened when someone on the<br/>
internet mentioned existentialism and she wanted to know more. She also<br/>
works at my husband&#39;s business where he makes herbal and nutritional<br/>
products. She watches the Daily Show with Jon Stewart at 11 PM - we all<br/>
do to find out what is going on in the world today in a bearable format<br/>
(Comedy Central CHannel). We&#39;ll see what else she gets into this year.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s what we have do and do now. Still read late at night and get<br/>
up as late as possible with all we have to do.<br/>
