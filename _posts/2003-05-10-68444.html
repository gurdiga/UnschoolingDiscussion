<div id="ygrps-yiv-968472376">We&#39;ve always felt that - rape is a weapon of war that carries so much<br/>
you have the disrespect & degradation of the women - please remember that in many Indigenous cultures, women are equal - in fact in some (Blackfoot, Mohawk, etc) it is a matriarchal & matrilineal.<br/>
What does that do??<br/>
Then there&#39;s the subjugation and emasculation of the warriors.<br/>
There&#39;s the &#39;mixed blood&#39; status of the babies.<br/>
We all know horror stories bout this.....<br/>
although, I have to say that in many cases - mixed bloods are more accepted in Native society.....<br/>
<br/>
assimilation <br/>
assassination<br/>
<br/>
take your pick.<br/>

  **I teach her about the invasion and the occupation; she knows People<br/>
  that have been in boarding schools - after being kidnapped from their families.**<br/>
<br/>
  Once anyone knows this part of American history, it&#39;s really hard to<br/>
  consider any kind of school to be a &quot;good thing&quot; that&#39;s really and truly<br/>
  for &quot;the child&#39;s own good.&quot;  (I don&#39;t thiiiiink so!)  When you know that<br/>
  school has been used like a blunt instrument to attempt to crush<br/>
  people&#39;s culture and totally reshape their lives as if they were<br/>
  modelling clay, not people, then it&#39;s hard to think of school as some<br/>
  benevolent force in kids&#39; lives<br/>
<br/>
  There was an anecdote, maybe repeated in Lies My Teacher Told me, about<br/>
  a school on a reservation where the teachers duct-taped the children&#39;s<br/>
  mouths shut all day, except for lunchtime.  Words can&#39;t describe how<br/>
  horrifyingly wrong that is.<br/>
<br/>

  PS  We recently watched the DVD of Rabbit Proof Fence.  It&#39;s the story<br/>
  of Australian girls trying to escape from a similar boarding school<br/>
  situation.  My husband drew the conclusion that rape of servant<br/>
  girls/women was an intentional part of the government&#39;s plan of diluting<br/>
  racial characteristics.  I wonder if other people who saw the movie,<br/>
  read the book, or know the real history would agree with that inference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would agree with that. It was horrifying to watch really. Listening to the<br/>
government officials outlining their plan to phase an entire race out of<br/>
existence.<br/>
I thought as I watched it that it was so like Hitler and his plan for<br/>
Germany. How did they not see it?<br/>
I live in  a small country town in australia and we have such huge racial<br/>
problems in the town. I don&#39;t see them ever being solved, just getting<br/>
worse.<br/>
Somethings are so bad that they can&#39;t ever be fixed and taking a whole<br/>
generation away from their families  is one of them.<br/>
