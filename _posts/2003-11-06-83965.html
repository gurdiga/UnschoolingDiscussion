How do you respond to family members?<br/>
Now that the holidays are here and we get to spend time with &quot;well-meaning&quot;<br/>

tell them when they grill you on &quot;school&quot;.  I don&#39;t have ONE relation who is<br/>

want to hear what we do, they just want to make sure I&#39;m not &quot;ruining those<br/>

&quot;how do you know what books to use?&quot; or &quot;how will they ever have any<br/>

they understand.  But I don&#39;t want to do that anymore and especially since<br/>

respond in a way that would get them curious or at least be able to talk<br/>
more positively in front of my kids.  Some of their remarks make my 11 year<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252887269">We used to get that - if fil doesn&#39;t have a report card to crow over and <br/>
then grandly hand out a dollar, he&#39;s lost. When they used to ask, I&#39;d <br/>
bore them to tears with what the kids are doing -which is exactly the <br/>
*last* thing they want to hear. lol. so they no longer ask. The other <br/>
day I got asked if we were sending our 13 yo to a private high school - <br/>
she assumed we were, said in  a tone of voice as in &quot;of course you&#39;re <br/>
not going to homeschool high school!?&quot;  I said no of course she&#39;s not <br/>
going to a private high school - where ever did you get that idea? end <br/>
of discussion. If they&#39;re not really interested in what the kids are <br/>
doing, go on about that endlessly and they&#39;ll learn real quick not to <br/>
ask. I refuse to justify what we&#39;re doing. Glad to discuss, but I refuse <br/>
to be interrogated or to have to satisfy someone who wrongly thinks they <br/>
have the right to judge what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately for the kids, the other grandmother is totally interested in <br/>
what they do, and is always talking to them, asking questions, and is <br/>
genuinely interested, which makes up for a lot. Recently we visited some <br/>
old family friends that the kids didn&#39;t know very well. My mother&#39;s <br/>
friend showed more interest in my oldest&#39;s acting than her grandparents <br/>
ever have. She was in tears, that someone could be that nice to her, and <br/>
show such an interest. I realized that she thinks her cold grandparents <br/>
are normal, and her nana, who lives far away but is very interested is <br/>
kind of unusual. It was then that I finally realized how much her nearby <br/>
grandparents have hurt her with their disinterest in what she does. <br/>
Makes me both sad and furious.<br/>
<br/>
Believe in what you&#39;re doing and let that show, and put your kids first. <br/>
Wish I had stood up more firmly to the in-laws years ago.<br/>
good luck,<br/>

I would highlight the fact that only having two or three kids to worry about<br/>
lets you use different strategies than you do in a class room.  That you are<br/>
with them all the time and use all the things in life to teach them, not<br/>
just textbooks and specific times of day.  That you may not cover the same<br/>
things that school kids do, but that school kids won&#39;t come close to the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What if one of your children grew up, had a family and started involving her<br/>
family in a cult you&#39;d heard scary things about? Her happiness and<br/>
confidence might give you the impression she&#39;s still rational, but why would<br/>
she be making such irrational, scary and &quot;obviously&quot; wrong decisions?<br/>
<br/>
How much would you be interested in what she was doing with the cult? If you<br/>
already knew it was bad, wouldn&#39;t anything she said sound like brainwashing?<br/>
On the other hand, how much would you be interested in hearing comforting<br/>
words that she was coming to her senses and thinking straight again?<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re fishing for those comforting words because they&#39;re scared.<br/>
Everything they&#39;re certain of about what kids need -- and society confirms<br/>
it for them -- you&#39;re apparently oblivious to.<br/>
<br/>
I liked Susan&#39;s answer about blitzing them with what the kids are doing. :-)<br/>
That way you aren&#39;t allowing yourself to take a defensive position and<br/>
proving you&#39;re right. You just blaze on ahead with full knowledge that you<br/>
are right :-)<br/>
<br/>
Another tactic is to give them inforamtion to read and say you&#39;ll be glad to<br/>
discuss it when they&#39;re done reading.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are lots of great responses on this list.  The biggest thing that I<br/>
can add is that you mentally and psychologically prepare yourself to be<br/>
yelled at and/or completely &quot;disowned&quot;.  Be as nice as you can be, but stand<br/>
up for yourself and your children and don&#39;t let family members and friends<br/>
coerce you into doing things that aren&#39;t good for your children.  The<br/>
decision of taking your children out of school is a big one and you&#39;ll<br/>
probably get some big responses.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve already educated yourself.  Come up with a few memorized responses<br/>
that you can say without having to think them through while emotions are<br/>
flying around.  Maybe even print out a list of books, articles, websites,<br/>
etc. that you&#39;d love for the whole family to read.  Keep it short though, or<br/>
it&#39;ll probably be ignored completely.  Good luck!<br/>

  &quot;DO school and we use ALL books...and TV...and Playstation...and boy, you<br/>
  should see our arts and crafts stuff!&quot;  I would also like to be able to<br/>
  respond in a way that would get them curious or at least be able to talk<br/>
  more positively in front of my kids.  Some of their remarks make my 11 year<br/>
  old daughter feel like something is wrong with her (or her mom!!)<br/>
  Sorry this got so long...I really look forward to your comments and ways in<br/>
  which you respond to your relatives, Lisa<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi. It&#39;s me Ang, I haven&#39;t read or posted here for awhile.  You wanna <br/>
know how I handled the family members, once and for all? I sent them <br/>
this really long email. I got tired of the &quot;concerns&quot; and the veiled <br/>
insults, so I put it in writing (i do best writing and not with in-<br/>
person conflicts). I am browsing posts and saw this question about <br/>
responding to family members, so here it is. Everyone i know who has <br/>
email got copied. No one came back and questioned me, except one aunt <br/>
who asked what LOL means. And i did get some complimentary feedback. <br/>
I put it out there and how they feel about it at this point is their <br/>
problem. It&#39;s long, i tried not to be too offensive, and i when i say <br/>
I &quot;use&quot; the world book scope and sequence, all that means is i scan <br/>
it and say yep, yep, covered that, this would count for that, etc. No <br/>
forced curriculum. And it helps me organize my portfolio for year-end <br/>
assessment. <br/>
<br/>
And an extra plug for no limits on tv, food, whatever the children <br/>
are feared to get carried away with. It works. Trust your instincts, <br/>
they work. Trust your children, they&#39;re brilliant. <br/>
<br/>
And a little honesty here: I was getting way too consumed with this <br/>
group. I was starting to question, in a bad way, every little <br/>
decision or thing that happened. I began to second-guess everything I <br/>
did  and look to the list &quot;experts&quot; for insight and approval. I <br/>
didn&#39;t trust myself completely to make own choices anymore. Really. I <br/>
was losing touch with my own instincts, instincts that serve me well <br/>
when I listen to them. So I took a break, and i am in a better place <br/>
now. I am more in-tune to my kids needs and what works for us without <br/>
second-guessing every thing we are doing.  I was spending way too <br/>
much time online away from my kids and it was putting too many <br/>
criticizing voices in my head. <br/>
<br/>
So thanks for the wisdom of people who share so much of their time, I <br/>
apologize that I can&#39;t spend more time here. I hope you understand. I <br/>
think that is a testimony, that you can learn so much here that you <br/>
can leave it behind with confidence that you can unschool <br/>
successfully. The legacy lives on in my daily life. I miss you guys, <br/>
hence my browsing here tonight. Maybe someday i will find the balance <br/>
to be active here again. <br/>
<br/>

SUBJECT: For the Record<br/>
10/08/03<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this to go with a picture of numbers that Ashlyn wrote. The <br/>
pic is a springboard to qualify my feelings on some issues about our <br/>
homeschooling. Stop reading now if you don&#39;t want to hear about it. <br/>
Or print and read it later so as not to stir you at an inconvenient <br/>
time. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too provocative, but it&#39;s less accusing than <br/>
the ones I wrote in the past and never sent about our homeschooling <br/>
decision and defending some points, after feeling attacked and <br/>
insulted for so long. LOL!! (I have scanned the pic if you want it <br/>
emailed to you.)<br/>
 <br/>
I am copying this to everyone because when I am this excited about <br/>
something I can hardly contain it. I have kept a lot to myself out of <br/>
fear of backlash or frustrating misunderstanding. The &quot;people&quot; <br/>
referred to is not necessarily anyone in particular reading this, but <br/>
comes from many different experiences from many people, including <br/>
family, friends, and even strangers over the past few years. So no <br/>
finger pointing, but if you recognize yourself in here somewhere, <br/>
don&#39;t hesitate to ask me for clarification. Some of you may also be <br/>
reading this who have never openly questioned me, but you may have <br/>
unspoken questions or doubts. I hope this addresses it all. <br/>
 <br/>
Why do I feel the need to prove what we do works for us? Probably <br/>
because I don&#39;t get the overall impression that I get the benefit of <br/>
the doubt with this endeavor. So read it or not, groan, laugh, roll <br/>
your eyes, or heck, nod in agreement.  You won&#39;t hurt my feelings. Or <br/>
change my mind :0)  I am writing this just as much for me as for <br/>
anyone else. I&#39;ll be cheering myself on even if no one else feels <br/>
compelled to. LOL  So here goes.......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did not teach Ashlyn(4) how to write those numbers. She learned by <br/>
living daily life and being a curious kid. This is *the foundation of <br/>
my homeschooling philosophy*, that kids will learn without coercion <br/>
what they need to familiarize themselves with the world around them. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t mysteriously stop at some arbitrary age. Christian(2) can <br/>
count to ten and name colors the same way. No one ever decided they <br/>
needed to know these things and sat them down and taught them with a <br/>
program. Just like learning to walk and talk, it&#39;s like the air they <br/>
breathe. <br/>
 <br/>
Learning is everywhere, there is no magic formula for kids to be <br/>
filled with regimented instruction, they will seek it on their own as <br/>
long as their curiosity hasn&#39;t been stamped out by drilling and <br/>
forceful teaching and controlling and shaming for not performing. <br/>
Learning comes from desire and interest and is retained because it <br/>
has personal meaning. Memorizing facts at school to be sometimes <br/>
forgotten or discarded because they are not relevant or useful <br/>
personally is not the same.  I say these things from experience of my <br/>
schooling, Megan&#39;s schooling, and others&#39; experiences that have been <br/>
shared with me. YMMV-- Your Mileage May Vary. <br/>
 <br/>
My job in the capacity of homeschooling and parenting in general is <br/>
to provide a loving, rich, nurturing environment and lots of <br/>
guidance. Lots of exposure to important and interesting things about <br/>
our world and the past. Setting good examples for reading, <br/>
researching, and finding out new things everyday. Imparting a sense <br/>
of discovery and fascination about so many things about our existence <br/>
in this life.  Paying a lot of attention and noticing when my kids <br/>
need something, or want to learn more about something without pushing <br/>
them into my own agenda. With my tendency to be dramatic about such <br/>
things, these goals are actually accomplished rather simply and <br/>
beautifully. <br/>
 <br/>
Megan(11) learns the same way as my younger two. And we are happy and <br/>
joyful living and learning this way and no one is going to change <br/>
that LOL. I am not saying these things to start a debate, I just <br/>
don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve ever explained what we do and why quite this <br/>
way. I get regular evidence like this picture, or a conversation, or <br/>
many other clues and intimate knowledge and daily affirmation of how <br/>
and what my children learn. It&#39;s amazing. I am absolutely confident <br/>
in how this works. I have gotten defensive, not that I don&#39;t believe <br/>
in this valid decision, but that people don&#39;t have faith that I&#39;m <br/>
intelligent enough to know what I&#39;m doing with my kids.   We <br/>
appreciate other peoples&#39; concerns, but we find most fears to be <br/>
unfounded. Generally, they are false assumptions or lack of <br/>
information. <br/>
 <br/>
We absolutely know what we are doing. And we don&#39;t criticize or find <br/>
fault with other&#39;s decisions now or in the past on how to educate <br/>
their children. To each his own! Schools serve their own purpose and <br/>
meet the needs of some, but they are not the answer for every child <br/>
or family. We just wish more people would believe in us and not <br/>
openly criticize and look for deficits to dismiss our whole <br/>
lifestyle. <br/>
 <br/>
It took me a year and a half to make the decision to bring Megan <br/>
home, it wasn&#39;t something I did lightly. I tried everything I knew to <br/>
help her be successful in school, including some ganging up on her <br/>
with the school staff that I horribly regret. I researched and read <br/>
and deliberated, and I finally just went for it. I do not regret it <br/>
for one second, except for not doing it sooner. Believe that I am <br/>
doing what I think is in her best interest, no other reason. We are <br/>
doing this from love and trust, not fear. And we trust all of our <br/>
children to give them a choice to go to public school at anytime. I <br/>
am no martyr, but a lot of personal sacrifice goes into <br/>
homeschooling, it is not the path of least resistance. In other <br/>
words, I am not doing it to take the easy way out of school, just as <br/>
I don&#39;t think schooling parents are doing it likewise. Each have <br/>
their own demands and stresses, I have been down both roads. At the <br/>
same time, I don&#39;t find homeschooling too much to ask of myself, I <br/>
find it a worthy investment. My choices are based on my own findings <br/>
and experiences and values, not reflective of anyone else&#39;s choice. <br/>
 <br/>
As I&#39;ve said all along, there are no guarantees. Going to school does <br/>
not guarantee a great education and a happy, successful life. Nor <br/>
does homeschooling. But Megan is learning that she can trust herself <br/>
and her curiosity, that she can do anything she sets her mind to, <br/>
that she can make her own decisions slowly with confidence and <br/>
support from me. She wasn&#39;t getting that in school, she was <br/>
getting &quot;you don&#39;t know what you need, so for your own good, do as we <br/>
say, don&#39;t think for yourself. Do this or else.&quot; She was not learning <br/>
much, and she was becoming more withdrawn and defiant. Her spark was <br/>
gone. It is taking a long time for her to heal and blossom again, but <br/>
I have already seen enough to know we made the right decision.<br/>
 <br/>
People may never understand my perspective. There are some great <br/>
books that would help to understand, like the Unschooling Handbook by <br/>
Mary Griffith, the Homeschooling Book of Answers by Linda Dobson, <br/>
anything by John Holt or John Taylor Gatto. It seems no one who <br/>
debates with me wants to hear or understand or learn about the <br/>
mechanics of it, they just want to find fault and make disparaging <br/>
comments. To justify their own choice? To defend any perceived <br/>
criticism of their lifestyle, where there is none implied? Who knows. <br/>
 <br/>
I do know I have a two year-end portfolios completed, no one has <br/>
looked or asked to look if they were aware of them. Sometimes it <br/>
seems like some are only looking for reasons to justify not believing <br/>
in our choice, not rejoicing in our successes. That&#39;s okay. I <br/>
understand. I&#39;ll try not to take it so personally anymore. I don&#39;t <br/>
want it to be a source of conflict and ill feelings. <br/>
 <br/>
I also know when I was going over Worldbook&#39;s Scope and Sequence for <br/>
end of last school year that Megan had covered everything but two <br/>
small details. Without scheduling any lessons by me. Does anyone <br/>
realize that the curriculum for 5th grade at (current local school) <br/>
is not the same as (previous local school) or any other public <br/>
school? The bureaucrats cannot not agree on a nationwide or even <br/>
statewide curriculum. So I use Worldbook&#39;s and a book I have on <br/>
custom curriculums. A lot of the stuff is repetitive from year to <br/>
year. They keep going over the same stuff.   She may not get the <br/>
exact lesson in the exact order of school, but I&#39;m assured she gets <br/>
just as much retained and probably more. We count every moment of the <br/>
day as learning, and she easily gets her 900 hours a year just by <br/>
writing things down that look remotely educational. <br/>
 <br/>
Not to mention her overall attitude and maturity have progressed so <br/>
much. What may not be outwardly visible to others is crystal clear to <br/>
me. She still has a lot of spirited qualities in her personality that <br/>
nothing will change. I&#39;m learning different responses and ways to <br/>
handle them, and she is learning to better utilize them. That&#39;s a <br/>
whole &#39;nother email and book recommendation! <br/>
 <br/>
So here&#39;s hope to new understanding. We celebrate this lifestyle and <br/>
have found immeasurable joy, and we want folks to be happy for us. <br/>
Just as we are happy when folks are living the life they want to <br/>
lead. Of course it isn&#39;t perfect, we have our bad moments and bad <br/>
days, make our fair share of mistakes, but I still thank God every <br/>
day Megan is who she is and her &quot;problems&quot; were opportunities to lead <br/>
us to a wonderful journey.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
If I never breathe another word about homeschooling to anyone, this <br/>
is my position for the record. <br/>
 <br/>
In mutual respect,<br/>
 <br/>
Angela</div>
