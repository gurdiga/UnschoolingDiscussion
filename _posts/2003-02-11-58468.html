&lt;&lt; Humans are like gas, they fill whatever space they&#39;re in. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And like gas, if they&#39;re in too small a space, conditions aren&#39;t so calm and <br/>
tranquil!<br/>
<br/>
Even when our kids were small people, 1400 square feet wasn&#39;t enough for all <br/>
my packrattery AND them.   We could have stayed there, but we would not have <br/>
been as nice to each other, nor had space for one to get away in private to <br/>
recover from crowdedness.  Moving to another house did help the gasses we <br/>
were being. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think that is possible many times. But I also know that having a smaller <br/>
space leaves me less to clean and fuss about!! So less stress in a lot of <br/>
ways.<br/>
I think the main thing is that we all have our own spaces to get away to and <br/>
lots of open outdoors with good weather most of the year.<br/>
That makes a huge difference.<br/>

Absolutely.  I bet people can survive more happily in a small house in <br/>
Florida or New Mexico than in Alaska or Minnesota.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678370833">I just mentioned to my daughter yesterday:<br/>
You know how in cartoons someone will be eating a bowl of something, keep <br/>
shoveling it in, but the contents of the bowl never seems to go down?  That&#39;s <br/>
what my kitchen table is like.  I keep taking things off it, but it always <br/>
looks full.  <br/>

I adored our small little house we had before this one. After two years <br/>
here, I still can&#39;t say I like this one much. (sigh)<br/>
