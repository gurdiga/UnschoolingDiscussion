<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499856889">I think it&#39;s great if you want them with you, if there is room and if they contribute in some way to the family.    I see nothing wrong with older kids living at home, if they help around the place, get on well with the household, and don&#39;t &quot;cost&quot; their parents financially.  It seems that it would be the cheapest way for them to live enabling them to save a deposit for a place of their own, giving them a really good start.<br/>

If you are happy with it, the rest of your family in<br/>
the home are happy with it, and you have the space,<br/>
why not?<br/>
<br/>
They sound like responsible adults with definite goals<br/>
in mind.  The fact that you are in a position to help<br/>
them is wonderful, because some parents aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could ask if they can help with the<br/>
increase in utilities and the upkeep of the property.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would be a good idea to set some sort of time<br/>
goal (flexible, not in stone as things happen beyond<br/>
our control), such as 6 months or whatever you feel<br/>
comfortable with, when you will sit back down with<br/>
them and re-evaluate.<br/>

<br/>
It sounds pretty cool to me!  From what you&#39;ve said, they sound like good people, and are not moving back just to &#39;sponge&#39; off of you and your family.  If it were me, I might be alittle concerned about having a teacher in the midst, lol, but you seem confident that this is a good thing, so I say, go for it!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352889557">Last year, my husband and I made the decision to live closer to my parents <br/>
and grandmother.  They owned a piece of property behind them that was about 1/2 <br/>
an acre.  My parents gave it to us and we built a house on it.  We had to live <br/>
all in the same house for about 6 months and that was tough but we really had <br/>
a lot of fun.  Now, we live next door and the kids can see their grandparents <br/>
whenever they wish.  My Grandma passed away 6 weeks ago and they had been <br/>
able to spend so much time with her the last 18 months.  My mom does call this <br/>
her commune and loves it this way.<br/>

There are many cultures where it&#39;s not only normal, but it would be <br/>
considered downright weird if grown kids didn&#39;t live with or very near <br/>
their parents, to have multigeneration families in the household together.<br/>

The only negative I can possibly think of is that she is a teacher <br/>
(and I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re unschooling).  Does she support unschooling <br/>
or would she have a hard time with it? <br/>

time.<br/>

&quot;grown&quot; children living at home.<br/>

And, for what it&#39;s worth, I feel that it is the highest compliment to your<br/>
parenting that your daughter would want to be home in your environment!<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s quite a recent &quot;tradition.&quot;  If you look at 19th century north <br/>
America and at just about anywhere outside Western Culture, you&#39;ll see <br/>
extended families.<br/>
<br/>
When a young woman married an older man who already owned a house, she <br/>
&quot;traditionally&quot; went to that house, or if she was marrying the son of a wealthy <br/>
family she might go to live in his family&#39;s home.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe our &quot;traditions&quot; about nuclear families, mom/dad/two kids/dog, <br/>
are more like post-WWII government-recommended ideal, base housing moved out <br/>
to the suburbs, than any natural &quot;tradition.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
  We will have the room....(and more room very soon, when we move). They said <br/>
they DO want to pay a small amount each month , and also to help in cooking <br/>
and cleaning during meals.<br/>
   And they said that I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; be responsible for their meals.<br/>

   o be honest, I don&#39;t think this will be a problem. She&#39;s learned so much <br/>
from us when we followed a CM philosophy and we have had many discussions about <br/>
education and how she can instill the love of learning in her classroom. She <br/>
does feel frustrated with the &quot;agenda&quot; she has to follow though.<br/>
   Teaching is her job , for now, and she has already verbalized <br/>
homeschooling her own children. Ahhh...and she&#39;ll have an firsthand experience with <br/>
unschooling if she lives with us.<br/>

it&quot; right now. (It&#39;s the unknown). But she will &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;. She&#39;s already verbalized <br/>
how happy the kids seem.<br/>

&gt; There are many cultures where it&#39;s not only normal, but it would be <br/>
&gt; considered downright weird if grown kids didn&#39;t live with or very near <br/>
&gt; their parents, to have multigeneration families in the household together.<br/>

all benefit from living together, young and old. And all the nature on our new <br/>
land (and future animals) could also benefit them.<br/>
  And even unschooling...this great way of living ...could inspire them in <br/>
some way too. ( thinking &quot;outside the box&quot;, developing their passions, etc). <br/>
