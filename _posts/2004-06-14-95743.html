I feel for you Sandra. If it were me, I imagine I would have <br/>
the broken record of &#39;I wonder what they&#39;re doing right now, I hope <br/>
they&#39;re OK&#39; playing in my head.<br/>

I&#39;ve gone a couple of hours at a time without wondering, but when I do look <br/>
at the clock I wonder and hope.   They&#39;re to be back between 11:00 pm and 4:00 <br/>
a.m.ish, depending whether any of the seven are in the final rounds.  They <br/>
travelled in one van, one parental adult, two young unmarried adults, the rest <br/>
teens, Marty the youngest.<br/>
