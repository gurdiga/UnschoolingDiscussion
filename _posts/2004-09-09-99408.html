<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078011603">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I went on a homeschooling cruise many years ago that Rob and Cindy Shearer <br/>
kind of hosted or ran.  It was back in the days that I didn&#39;t know that there <br/>
were so many types of homeschoolers.  I guess I never gave it much thought that <br/>
hs&#39;ing could look so different in homes across this country.  Well,.......  we <br/>
got there and immediately knew we were different when they scheduled &quot;mass&quot; <br/>
or &quot;service&quot; or whatever they called it.  Went to dinner (very formal) that <br/>
night and lo and behold...  Rob and Cindy at my table.  Hmmmm....  a UU at a <br/>
table with the head honchos.  <br/>
<br/>
The cruise was a week long and I went to most of the discussions and classes <br/>
and learned a lot.  For the first time in my life I discovered that folks use <br/>
the bible in their teaching and make their kids sit down with text books and <br/>
workbooks.  I chuckle when I think of myself in that grand hall timidly raising <br/>
my hand and shouting out that I was amazed that they used the bible and I had <br/>
never thought of it as a historical document.  I&#39;ve always internally <br/>
classified it as historical fiction.  <br/>
<br/>
My son had a great time.  I learned a lot about people, didn&#39;t make any <br/>
lasting friendships but was invited to South America to work with a missionary <br/>
family for a summer.  (What an interesting mix that would have made, <br/>
fundamentalist and an agnostic)   My hubby spent almost the entire week in the infirmary on <br/>
IV&#39;s he was so sick.  <br/>
<br/>
How about Costa Rica for a get together?  I&#39;ll skip another cruise!<br/>

PS  Rain, rain....  go away!       Thanks again Sandra for your hospitality <br/>
this summer!<br/>
