&lt;&lt; She now proudly tells people about unschooling, and tries very hard to <br/>
explain that it is nothing like homeschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It IS homeschooling. <br/>
It&#39;s homeschooling in a way that rejects the school&#39;s model of prescribed <br/>
sets of facts presented with pretest/intro/review/measures/reinforcement.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not school at home, but it&#39;s an alternative to the &quot;compulsory <br/>
education&quot; the governnt schools are providing free (and then requiring except for par<br/>
Zticular exceptions).<br/>
<br/>
On unschooling.com a while back when I was really busy and distracted, <br/>
someone had gushed about unschooling being wonderful (which it is! I agree!) and <br/>
said &quot;I can&#39;t believe this is legal!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling &quot;as a thing&quot; is not legal.  There&#39;s no state or province I know <br/>
of where one can say &quot;We&#39;re unschooling,&quot; and say no more.   Its up to each <br/>
unschooler to figure out how to follow state law in her own instance with her own <br/>
kids in her own state, or up to her/them to figure out how far they want to <br/>
go to bend the law or avoid it.  <br/>
<br/>
When it leans more toward &quot;Do nothing&quot; than &quot;Provide tons of input and <br/>
experiences,&quot; it moves from the realm of the parents really understanding what <br/>
they&#39;re doing to (I fear, sometimes) parents seeing others partying and joining the <br/>
party without personal knowledge or responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
(I have a story I&#39;ll post separately.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re homeschooling.  When I talk to anyone outside other homeschoolers, I <br/>
say &quot;homeschooling,&quot; because that&#39;s all that exists, legally, other than putting <br/>
kids in school.<br/>
<br/>
Among other homeschoolers I talk about unschooling (duh!  You all know I do!  <br/>
I do it every single day, and the only days I don&#39;t post at all are when I&#39;m <br/>
off talking about it in person somewhere).  But unschooling, for all it&#39;s <br/>
glorious wholeness and far-reaching life-changing effects, is homeschooling.    <br/>
The only way it could NOT be that would be for there to be no compulsory <br/>
education laws.  But there are a buttload of those, and I don&#39;t think anyone on this <br/>
list lives where there are not compulsory education laws (by that very name or <br/>
some other similar).   It&#39;s no longer a thing the government offers free as <br/>
an optional service, but a thing the government requires.  Our alternative is <br/>
private school or homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is legal only when and if the parents know enough and do enough <br/>
to justify it themselves if and when they are called to report or explain.  <br/>
None of us can defend other unschoolers.  Each family has to be strong enough in <br/>
and of itself to be doing this.  It&#39;s not an organization one joins, it&#39;s a <br/>
way one can learn to live and think and be.<br/>
<br/>
Not doing is insufficient.  <br/>
There is a whole lot of *do*ing.<br/>

It is also the same for New Jersey. If the state chooses to challenge, the burden of proof is on them. I asked my daughter why use the word unschooling, her response was that her education is self guided. And it is such a marvel to watch and be a part of.<br/>

So that sometimes leads to confusing conversations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True in Washington state too.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers can be enrolled full time as public school alternative education students.  The state has created public school/homeschool hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor sends her kid to regular old school, but feels that she &quot;homeschools&quot; him as well, since she spends so much time contributing to his education outside of school hours.<br/>
<br/>
Legally, I am &quot;providing&quot; my children with &quot;home-based instruction&quot;.<br/>
