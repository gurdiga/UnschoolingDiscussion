<div id="ygrps-yiv-87298640">Hi,<br/>
  A short while ago, a mom was missing her child and Janis advised her to <br/>
look to the moon.  I liked that; it reminded me of the song from the movie with <br/>
Fievel.<br/>
  I recently discovered that the moon is home to places with very beautiful <br/>
names:<br/>
Bay of Dew<br/>
Bay of Rainbows<br/>
Lake of Dreams<br/>
Sea of Serenity<br/>
Sea of Nectar<br/>
Sea of Humors<br/>
Sea of Showers<br/>
  Just something to ponder next time we look to the moon.<br/>

BTW - tonight, I believe is Harvest Moon.<br/>
