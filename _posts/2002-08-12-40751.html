I agree. And so has (does) my state, CT, big. We read about abuse, injuries,<br/>
neglect, yes - killing,  almost every week, and this, even though we know<br/>
that the agencies, just like the schools, do whatever they can to hide their<br/>
dysfunctions. No one is punished, no one is blamed. Why? It&#39;s the state.<br/>
Private agencies are closed when they do the same things. Charges are filed.<br/>

Homeschool those kids.  Keep them healthy, safe. Nobody else will.</div>

keep them safe? I would think that in this situation, school would keep them <br/>
safe. School certainly kept me safe. But what do I know?<br/>
