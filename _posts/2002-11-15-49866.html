<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637289793">I have a sister from my mom&#39;s first marriage and a brother from my dad&#39;s <br/>
first mariage. My sister looks like my mom and my brother looks like my dad. <br/>
My sister lived with my parents until she was 19 and my brother lived with <br/>
his mom. Neither one of them are anything like me at all in no way shape or <br/>
form. Aside from looks, I don&#39;t see much at all that is like either one of <br/>
my parents.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has been raised by my husband since she was 4. He thinks of her as <br/>
his. She also has frequent contact with her dad. The similarities between my <br/>
daughter and my husband are sometimes scary. He still jokes that she really <br/>
is his and we had a fling a long time ago!!! Of course she is like her dad <br/>
too, but so many things are like my husband, most people have no clue. She <br/>
also looks very much like me where my other 3 kids look like my husband. <br/>
Hey, at least I got one that resembles me!!!<br/>
