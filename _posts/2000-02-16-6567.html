&gt; Wow David, thank you for always saying things so eloquently.  This reminds<br/>
&gt; of a conversation I had when I was 16 with a very small town, small-minded<br/>
&gt; sheriff.  He was trying to convince me that his God was the only God, the<br/>
&gt; only true thing.  I finally told him that I believed we were all put here on<br/>
&gt; Earth by lifeforms on another planet/in another galaxy.  Their purpose: to<br/>
&gt; watch & study us, to see if we would make the same mistakes they had, the<br/>
&gt; same discoveries.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again for saying so well what so many of us all think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Cindy --<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the compliment. As those who&#39;ve read my book know, I am a Quaker, and<br/>
we take, as our very first principle, that there is the light of God (Christian<br/>
Friends,  call it &quot;the light of Christ&quot;) within every person, and that this<br/>
light was planted in us by God Him(Her) Self so that we might seek out the good,<br/>
each through our own experience, and each in our own way.  People seek that<br/>
which is True in their own ways because it was ordained by the Truth itself that<br/>
they do so.<br/>
<br/>
And you can see that, if you watch and witness, in your children.  They have no<br/>
need of our God talk, and our Holy Books -- these are, after all, but tools, and<br/>
they become weapons -- sometimes deadly -- when we use them against each other<br/>
-- but they seek -- it is built into who they are from their very births.  I<br/>
call this &quot;original seeking&quot; -- and unlike concepts of original sin or original<br/>
virtue -- every mother and every father can see it with their own eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Our children are witnessing to us.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107661534">Wow David, thank you for always saying things so eloquently.  This reminds<br/>

<br/>
Needless to say, our conversation was over at this point.  Although I really<br/>
didn&#39;t believe what I had told him I did, I thought it important then (and<br/>
do so even more now) that we look at other perspectives.  That it&#39;s<br/>
important to think outside of the box.  And that it&#39;s interesting to stretch<br/>
your mind beyond the box.<br/>
<br/>
And I believe with all my heart that faith is personal and individual.  And<br/>
I believe that schools should be to educate children, and to teach them how<br/>
to think for themselves, even outside of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for saying so well what so many of us all think.<br/>
