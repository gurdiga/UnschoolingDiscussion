I have two things to tie this two.  One is that there will be a chat Wednesday about the dangers of the internet (fears around the internet, and confidence and advantages).  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com/2013/08/august-21-chat-on-dangers-of-internet.html">http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com/2013/08/august-21-chat-on-dangers-of-internet.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The other is that after a couple of people asking me about the images I choose for Just Add light, I wanted to use this one as an example.  Maybe different people will take different things from it, and I would like to lay it out here, the text and the photo from Wednesday&#39;s post, to see what people can glean from the combination/juxtaposition of the two.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t miss it<br/>
&quot;If I wasn&#39;t paying attention, and if I was afraid of the time Ethan spends at the computer, I would miss all of the creativity and learning happening. Worse still, Ethan might too, because my worry would become his burden.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193016272">I&#39;ll take a stab at it.  What I love about this flag (and I&#39;m not someone<br/>
who is any kind of expert on flags of other countries or ship flags etc) is<br/>
that there is a lot going on on this flag.  It seems to be a combination of<br/>
at least 6 flags all connected by a symbol that looks sort of like a gear,<br/>
or a wheel or something from the far east or maybe...<br/>
<br/>
The internet is like that middle symbol - a central location or portal, if<br/>
you will, that can &quot;take you&quot; to places through words, pictures, and images<br/>
all over the world.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like there is a dragon on the flag in the lower right corner and<br/>
it reminds me of old maps where as they got to the edges of their &quot;known<br/>
universe&quot; the cartographers would put pictures of sea monsters and<br/>
sometimes even words that said things like &quot;there monsters be....&quot;  A lot<br/>
of people feel that way about the internet - they have their areas of<br/>
comfort, Gmail, Yahoo, Facebook, Wikipedia, Amazon (not the<br/>
jungle/rainforest...) but know that if not careful you can click into<br/>
dangerous territory (sort of like taking a wrong turn and ending up lost in<br/>
a bad neighborhood late at night).  A lot of parents fear the internet -<br/>
like it&#39;s a bad neighborhood filled with predators and pedophiles around<br/>
every corner, trolling xbox live games, giving out &quot;free lives&quot; on candy<br/>
crush saga and armor and supplies in World of Warcraft....<br/>
<br/>
The flag also seems to be a loud noisy jumble of colors and patterns.<br/>
 Computers can be that too.  Sometimes my computer is a crazy quilt of text<br/>
and images and music and maps....right now I have seven windows open on<br/>
this laptop,  The Just Add Light window with the picture of the flag, my<br/>
email, a wikipedia page on the history of the barber pole, two Youtube<br/>
video pages (one Minecraft walkthrough video, and a room tour put up by a<br/>
tween girl who is showing off her hamster cage and holiday decorations) a<br/>
map with directions to someplace in NY State, and Facebook. Those windows<br/>
do a pretty good job of covering time and space and people I know, close<br/>
friends and family, people who are living and dead, and some people I only<br/>
know through words and pictures, and pixels blinking on a screen.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I first saw it the other day, I thought, &quot;Wow.  That&#39;s a pretty colourful flag!&quot;  Now, that I look at it more closely, I see a lot of things going on in there.  Things, that if I was planning a flag, I might not think should go together.  If I was really attached to the style of the Canadian flag, or the Japanese flag, or the American flag, I might think this flag has too much going on.  But, it&#39;s wonderfully complex.  I don&#39;t think I, personally, can know everything that&#39;s going on in the flag--the relevance of everything.  I&#39;m not sure I need to know to enjoy it.  I might want to know if I was to learn from it, however.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370125122">The flag seemed to have bits of national flags from a range of countries - and some bits that may or may not be from national flags, I didn&#39;t recognise them all. To me it seemed a wonderful connection of a whole lot of different bits of the world, and possibly a doorway to asking lots of questions, wondering why and how all those things were linked.<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me of the way conversations can go here - something happens at our house or on TV and we say &#39;oh that&#39;s like….&#39; and we talk about the similarities and differences of the two connected ideas. Or when we are browsing the internet and reading something and see a link and click that and then another… And end up somewhere completely different to where we started but there is a trail of connections leading us there.<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t answer this question yesterday even though I immediately thought of all of the above because I was too nervous that I would get it completely wrong… I guess I still have some deschooling to do! (feeling braver this morning)<br/>

I&#39;m going to discuss it in the chat on Wednesday, so any more connections or ideas would be very welcome.  One thing I was thinking is that some people might think that having a boat and going to those places is virtuous, but being on the internet is sin and sloth.

Nice! And there&#39;s Robyn Coburn&#39;s dad. I put up some info she wrote about him, and somoene transferring old video recordings of jugglers found it and contacted me, so Robyn got to see video of her late father, doing a juggling trick she had written about there. We can watch it too, over and over, because technology is wonderful and some strangers who find us on the internet are sweet and generous.<br/>
