i hate to psychanalyze, since i only play a doctor on tv, but i was at a <br/>
hmschl conference recently that mentioned red flags to underlying problems <br/>
listing things like nailbiting, bedwetting etc.  i think there can be plenty <br/>
of reasons for nailbiting other than as a signal than something underlying is <br/>
wrong (like it is just a habit?) but its just the first thing that i <br/>
remembered...  pls take no offense, jodye.  anyway, i think the point they <br/>
were making was that kids may manifest stress or whatever in these physical <br/>
ways, so it is a good idea to see what else in their lives isnt going just <br/>
swimmingly for them.  dont know if this is any help, perhaps just food for <br/>
thought.<br/>
