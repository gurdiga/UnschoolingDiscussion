<div id="ygrps-yiv-639068110">From a MySpace bulletin, my wise daughter, Holly (16):<br/>

Things are going to get better before they get worse, unless they get  <br/>
worse and then get better, but things are going to be better and then  <br/>
worse and then good and then bad, because that&#39;s the way it always  <br/>
