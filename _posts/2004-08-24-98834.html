<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366007118">Hi all --<br/>
<br/>
Please excuse the cross-post, but I want to reach as many people as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Liam (16) and I are taking a road trip this October (hopefully) to visit Civil War battlefields, and I was thinking that some of you might have input about good places to stop and see on the way.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a guidebook for National Civil War Parks, and we are looking at sites in Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania -- all the major battle sites, plus Appomatox Courthouse and Washington DC.  We&#39;ll also be travelling the Natchez Trace from southern Mississippi to southern Tennessee and taking a look at some non-Civil War sites there, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Question first:  Have you been to any CW sites that were particularly riveting that we just shouldn&#39;t miss?<br/>
<br/>
Second: We&#39;ve only got two weeks altogether, and will be driving from Houston to DC and back, so time is of the essence.  What would you particularly recommend in the DC area?  We just can&#39;t do the whole thing, and this is not the trip for it.  I was thinking of Ford&#39;s Theater...are there any other particular CW sites that we should visit there?  (I know....I&#39;m checking online too. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Third: Any great places to eat or stay?  We&#39;re looking at a tight budget, but can splurge once in awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth:  Good scenic routes?  In particular, can anyone tell me if Interstate 81 through western Virginia is good?  I&#39;d love to be able to get off the interstates altogether and take back roads, but we just won&#39;t have the time.  The map looks like 81 goes right through the long middle of the W. Virginia mountains on the west and the Blue Ridge on the East.  Is it nice there, or have they managed to make that interstate as boring as so many others?  We will, however, be able to take back roads for select periods.  Any favorites?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your time in responding!<br/>
Laura B.<br/>

That trip sounds so cool!  I&#39;d love to do the same one day.  My family <br/>
has a lot of ties to Civil War soldiers.  I especially would like to <br/>
visit the site of the Battle of Chancellorsville in VA where my <br/>
relative, Brigadier-General Elisha Franklin (&quot;Bull&quot;) Paxton, was <br/>
killed.  He was &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#39;s right hand man apparently.  If <br/>
you go to Chancellorsville keep an eye out for his name.  I *think* <br/>
there is a plaque on a bridge there with his name on it (along with <br/>
some battle history) but I can&#39;t seem to locate my disc that has the <br/>
photo on it.  LOL<br/>

I assume when you say you&#39;re going to a civil war battlefield in PA, <br/>
you&#39;re talking about Gettysburg. :) <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been there, but someone once told me that the Dubbin House <br/>
Tavern in Gettysburg is a cool place to eat.   While you&#39;re waiting <br/>
for your food you can go tour the basement and see where the slaves <br/>
stayed in the underground railroad.  <br/>

<br/>
You might want to call first to make sure you don&#39;t have to make any <br/>
type of reservations, and to make sure you&#39;ll get to see where the <br/>
slaves were.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;In particular, can anyone tell me if Interstate 81<br/>

<br/>
If you take the Hershey/Grantville exit on interstate 81 and follow <br/>
the signs to the Hershey attractions, you can do Chocolate World.  <br/>
It&#39;s a ride that&#39;s a simulation of the Chocolate Factory, and at the <br/>
end you get a free candy bar.  It&#39;s completely free.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
about 7 miles off of 81.  <br/>

<br/>
What  would you particularly recommend in the DC area?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Chancelorsville battlefields just outside of Fredericksburg, VA (which  <br/>
also has more battlefields) still has the trenches that the soldiers lay in as  <br/>
they battled back and forth.  Very wooded (Manassas are open fields like  <br/>
Shyrley said), one can stand in the calm stillness and almost hear the cannons  <br/>
roar and see the soldiers fall (of course it probably helps if one is an avid  <br/>
Civil War buff and really LIKES these kinds of settings).<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is a huge Civil War cemetery in Fredericksburg way up on a hill  that <br/>
you walk about five hundred dug in the ground steps to get to that&#39;s pretty  <br/>
interesting.<br/>
 <br/>
Lots of cannons, all have visitors centers with lots of info on that  <br/>
particular place and battle.<br/>
 <br/>
Manassas does have the statue of Stonewall Jackson and IF you go there I  <br/>
would recommend a stop at the &quot;Stone House&quot; at the corner of Sudley Road and  <br/>
Rte.29  (where the roads to the battlefields intersect basically).   This is/was <br/>
a tavern converted into a field hospital.  The inside is the  same as in the <br/>
war.  Lots of strange instruments and such.   Cannonballs are still embedded in <br/>
the exterior of the old building.<br/>
 <br/>
One thing in the DC area that I would also highly recommend, which is a  <br/>
world away from the Civil War is the brand new Air and Space Museum that is  right <br/>
beside Dulles Airport in Chantilly ( a short distance but can be a long  <br/>
drive because of traffic from Manassas).  Lots of hands on stuff and close  ups of <br/>
planes and even a Space Shuttle is there.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course DC proper has more museums and experiences than imaginable.<br/>
 <br/>
As for the drive down I-81 it&#39;s about like any interstate drive these  days.  <br/>
You will see some rolling hillsides and farm animals and rock walls  as you <br/>
get closer to Blacksburg and the more mountainous regions of VA.<br/>
 <br/>
You CAN however experience the Blue Ridge Parkway and there you will likely  <br/>
see deer, possibly black bear, and LOTS of green and you can see valley&#39;s <br/>
below  and the views are very beautiful.<br/>
 <br/>
IF you want to experience going south into VA but want to escape the  mundane <br/>
world of the interstate, Route 11 runs mostly parallel and it is WAY  less <br/>
developed and winds through the countryside without a lot of the usual  Cracker <br/>
Barrels and Wendy&#39;s and such.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Also when you are in the Fredericksburg area you are a little over two  hours <br/>
from dipping your toes in the Atlantic Ocean at VA Beach.  Going  towards <br/>
there are of course Norfolk and Portsmouth with lots of Navy ships,  etc., to see.<br/>
 <br/>
Cait reminded me to also tell you about Morefield Mine, which is about one  <br/>
hour south of Fredericksburg and a wonderful place to explore and collect and  <br/>
bring home REAL minerals and gems you find.<br/>
 <br/>
Another short trip (just maybe 15 miles north of Fredericksburg VA) is  <br/>
Goldvein, VA with a gold mining museum and with a bit of advanced notice they  will <br/>
have someone there to assist you in panning for gold and sometimes the kids  <br/>
find real nuggets.<br/>
 <br/>
These are just something&#39;s that might be of interest if you wanted to add a  <br/>
bit more than Civil <br/>
War sites to your trip.<br/>

The Underground Railroad connection is perfect too.  I want to get to <br/>
an UR museum (either in Kentucky or in Pennsylvania), we&#39;re visiting <br/>
the African-American Museum in DC, plus Liam wants to read _Uncle <br/>
Tom&#39;s Cabin_ and a biography of Harriet Tubman, so...it all fits.<br/>

even though you&#39;re not the first to tell me about its&#39;...fields :-), <br/>
I think he&#39;ll still have fun visualizing.  We&#39;ve got a neat book I <br/>

about all the major battles of the war, and he wants to wander <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701322189">Half a day is fine. There&#39;s only one museum worth going into. Oh, you could look at the waxworks just to see how bad they can actually be. The bookshop is pretty good and the walk along the river to where the Shenandoah and Potomac meet is beautiful.<br/>
If you do go the Fredericksburg, there&#39;s a civil war museum there. Well worth a vist as they manage to set the whole thing in such a way that you could think the south won! (Ah think theyur still sore about it down there in Virginny)<br/>

heading up to Gettysburg the same day, and I know I need a full day <br/>
there...<br/>
<br/>
About Manassas, Liam is really interested in military strategy, so <br/>
even though you&#39;re not the first to tell me about its&#39;...fields :-), <br/>
I think he&#39;ll still have fun visualizing.  We&#39;ve got a neat book I <br/>
found at a used bookstore that has maps and charts and statistics <br/>
about all the major battles of the war, and he wants to wander <br/>
through that pretty thoroughly.<br/>
