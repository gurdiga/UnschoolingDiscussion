&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are <br/>
to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and <br/>
servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*That* is an understatement.  But, wasn&#39;t it GREAT!!  What a turnout, <br/>
considering how frigid it was.  It seems that we were toward the beginning <br/>
of the march as it left the Mall.  Do you know where you were, Shyrley?  I <br/>
was marching under a large pink homemade banner that said something like <br/>
&quot;Warwick Peace Action Group&quot; and &quot;No Blood For Oil&quot;  and &quot;Not in Our <br/>
Name.&quot;  It could&#39;ve been about 10 or 15 degrees warmer and then that would <br/>
have been great.  The cops were a little scary at one point though, <br/>
right?  Did you see when the parade went under the highway how the police <br/>
were lined up maybe every six feet or so on either side holding their <br/>
night-sticks?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to see your pictures.  I snapped a few too, but I have no idea <br/>
how they&#39;ll come out.  I just held the camera up as high over my head as I <br/>
could and snapped away.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t get home until about 1 in the morning, and it was 2 below zero <br/>
when we got back to my car.  Brrrrrrr.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be home!<br/>
