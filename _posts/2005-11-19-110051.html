<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125374811">This is interesting, because a few mornings ago (before the rootbeer float <br/>
story) I got up too early, it was cold, I was in stocking feet, and I cleaned <br/>
the kitchen.   I got some water on the floor, walked in it, and started really <br/>
feeling and thinking about whether it was worth risking waking Keith up to get <br/>
shoes out of the bedroom.   And while I was thinking about it, I was thinking <br/>
that even if a virus is &quot;all&quot; that causes colds, other factors are diet and <br/>
lack-of-stress, and certainly if keeping warm will fight off germs or virus <br/>
after a person&#39;s sick, keeping cold will say &quot;come on in and get me.&quot;   I must&#39;ve <br/>
been channeling Welsh researchers. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

-=-Maybe Mom was right. Scientists at the Common Cold Centre in Cardiff, <br/>
Wales, said this week there might truly be a link between chills and <br/>
colds--something docs have long denied.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The Centre&#39;s coldly calculating scientists gathered 180 volunteers and <br/>
asked half to soak their feet in ice-cold water for 20 minutes. Within five days, <br/>
13 of the chilly foot bathers reported cold symptoms, versus just 5 of the <br/>
more sensible people. Centre director Ronald Eccles said, &quot;Many people are <br/>
mildly infected but show no symptoms.&quot; Perhaps &quot;if they become chilled, this causes <br/>
a pronounced constriction of the blood vessels in the nose and shuts off the <br/>
warm blood that supplies the white cells that fight infection.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s from a subscription news thing called &quot;knowledge news&quot; but here&#39;s an <br/>
article on the same research:<br/>

Too funny! I always told the kids that getting cold in and of itself<br/>
couldn&#39;t make you sick, but it might lower your immune system so<br/>
getting really warm wouldn&#39;t hurt if you&#39;re starting to feel down.<br/>
<br/>
I got really, terribly sick one time, after taking a dip in the<br/>
Pacific Ocean of the coast of Oregon. It was a gorgeous sunny day, and<br/>
it looked SO inviting. ugh. Froze my butt off and spent the entire<br/>
week very sick.<br/>
