<div id="ygrps-yiv-967647527">So now you have me questioning all kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering about something else now. What has anyone experienced with <br/>
older kids that have boyfriends/girlfriends and wanting to have them stay <br/>
over? Is it okay with you and if so at what age and what are the <br/>
circumstances? Do they stay together or in separate areas of the house? What <br/>
about those kind of choices with the children?<br/>

My son, Cameron, had a girlfriend who stayed over. She was a regular <br/>
overnighter---spent whole weekends and holidays here. She had the choice of <br/>
where to sleep. She could spend the night in Duncan&#39;s (4 years old) top bunk <br/>
or she could sleep with Cam in Cameron&#39;s room. Or she could have Cameron <br/>
sleep in Duncan&#39;s room and she could have Cam&#39;s room to herself. We were <br/>
never uncomfortable with her staying over. THEY chose &quot;clothes on&quot; (no PJ&#39;s) <br/>
and decided what was acceptable or not. &quot;Nothing&quot; happened. This is common in <br/>
Germany--there&#39;s a name for it, but I can&#39;t remember what it is. They kiss <br/>
and snuggle and hold each other, but they are well aware of how far *not* to <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
His next girlfriend&#39;s parents were so strict, they were never allowed alone <br/>
in a room together; they couldn&#39;t go for a walk around the block, they were&#39;t <br/>
allowed to kiss---just hold hands. They weren&#39;t allowed to see each other <br/>
more than once a week---and then for a max of three or four hours. She was <br/>
allowed here twice for parties, but arrived at 6:00 and was picked up at <br/>
9:30. I&#39;m afraid what will happen there when she &quot;gets out&quot;. (and no, they <br/>
didn&#39;t know of our &quot;lack of rules&quot; with Lauren. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Cameron was there when I gave birth to his brother. He was turned off enough <br/>
about childbirth (BAD labor and emergency c-section), that he&#39;s in NO hurry <br/>
to be a father!<br/>
<br/>
Right now he&#39;s a &quot;bachelor&quot;. I hope the next girlfriend&#39;s parents are open <br/>
enough to allow overnights. It seemed quite healthy to me (but I spent <br/>
several years in Germany/Austria &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

houses were heated with one stove and the family was all around the stove in <br/>
the main living area, they would send the couple to the bedroom. The couple <br/>
would get into bed with all their clothes on and the board would be placed <br/>
between them. <br/>
On the same kind of note, TV censures used to say any scene with a couple in <br/>
a bedroom had to have each couple in a twin bed. Later if there was only one <br/>
bed in the room, each actor had to keep one foot on the floor on their side <br/>
of the bed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833743289">hello all,<br/>
Been lurking for a while, and thought I would respind to this topic.  When I <br/>
was a teenager, I had an older boyfriend.  My mom never really put boundries <br/>
on us, she trusted me and him enough to set up our own boundries and it <br/>
worked.<br/>
<br/>
He practically lived at my house, he didn&#39;t like his home situation and my <br/>
mom felt more comfortable with me at home.  We had self inflicted rules, we <br/>
could sleep in my room, in the same bed, but we always kept the door open <br/>
just a smidge.<br/>
<br/>
My poor mother went through a lot of hell from other family members for this <br/>
situation but it was probably the best thing she could do for me.  By taking <br/>
away the restrictions she made sex less enticing for me, I didn&#39;t have any <br/>
interest in rebelling, with no rules what was there to rebel against.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, my poor sister had it much worse, being the baby of the family, Mom had <br/>
a million rules for her.  As it ended up, she lost her virginity early, is <br/>
married to a druggie, and pregnant with her third child ( that cps wants to <br/>
take away), all at the ripe old age of 21.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the trust and respect that my mom showed me was the foundation for <br/>
the healthy marriage that my husband and I share. Thanks to her I don&#39;t have <br/>
a distorted view of intimacy or sex. In today&#39;s society that is far to <br/>
common.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just thought I would add my opinion, I&#39;ll go back to lurking now.  <br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>

She was 17. He needed a place to stay (bad things happening at his <br/>
house) and I offered him our extra room. They became bf/gf a few <br/>
months later. He lived with us for about a year, then got a place <br/>
with some of his friends. He stayed in her room at times. I never <br/>
monitored it. They did talk to me about &quot;everything&quot; and so I always <br/>
knew what was going on. He moved back in with us a year later, then I <br/>
moved out and they remained roommates. They broke up but stayed <br/>
roommates for another year. They are still friends five years later. <br/>
He is sitting at the computer on my left right now. He spent the day <br/>
with us. They find dates for each other now. lol<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m wondering about something else now. What has anyone experienced with <br/>
older kids that have boyfriends/girlfriends and wanting to have them stay <br/>
over? Is it okay with you and if so at what age and what are the <br/>
circumstances?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a girlfriend&#39;s whole family over, we&#39;ve had female friends <br/>
not-girlfriends over, and when the time comes that Kirby is involved with a <br/>
girl I wouldn&#39;t throw her out unless she was really irritating. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to let my boyfriend stay over (because we would show up to take <br/>
care of her infant while she went to the bar, partly).   My dad said NO, and <br/>
made him leave in the snow one night rather than let him sleep in the house <br/>
under any circumstances.  I thought it was the most horrible thing ever.  <br/>
<br/>
My dad didn&#39;t believe in having sex with women out of wedlock (not counting <br/>
my mom&#39;s sister, I guess, since they were both married...).  So he had three <br/>
ex wives when he married the fourth, who was my age.  He would have been way <br/>
better off fooling around.  <br/>
<br/>
Tangent... but others have such memories, perhaps, and it&#39;s worth not JUST <br/>
looking at our kids, but at what we know of our own lives and those of <br/>
others.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the other girls who grew up in my house had sex early and often, in <br/>
the daytime, at her boyfriend&#39;s house because his mom worked.  She could be <br/>
home early EVERY night and NEVER be suspect.  Another one of them used to <br/>
have back-seat-of-car dates with practical strangers.  I was the straightest <br/>
of the four of us.    I was nearly 18 when I had sex, and then it was <br/>
respectable-like, in a DORM room.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s mother, before we were married, wouldn&#39;t let us stay in the same <br/>
room although we were in our late 20s and had been living together for years.<br/>
