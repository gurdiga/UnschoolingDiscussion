Subject: Homeschooling article by Linda Nichols<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The homeschooling article by Linda Nichols presents a very negative slant<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; homeschooling.  It&#39;s a shame that some homeschoolers structure their<br/>
program<br/>
&gt; like that.  We&#39;re not surprised to hear that they eventually burn-out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Others like us, see the home as the base of operations and make constant<br/>
use<br/>
&gt; of a wide variety of community resources (other homeschooling families,<br/>
&gt; subject-matter experts, parks, businesses, museums, volunteer<br/>
opportunities,<br/>
&gt; apprenticeships, libraries, government buildings, historic sites, etc.,<br/>
&gt; etc.) to provide our children a first-rate education.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Such an arrangement can be intellectually stimulating for children and<br/>
&gt; parents alike.  And it&#39;s within the reach of anyone with the courage to<br/>
&gt; break ranks with the mainstream.<br/>
