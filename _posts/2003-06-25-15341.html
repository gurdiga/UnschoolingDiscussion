&lt;&lt; Sandra, hope you and your&#39;n are not in harm&#39;s way! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about ten miles from me, maybe eight, as it was moving north.  <br/>
<br/>
We saw the smoke not long after it started, on Tuesday afternoon.  It was <br/>
kinda neat looking, like clouds coming out of the ground, because of it being <br/>
(relative to other things around here) something really clean burning.  Trees and <br/>
right by the river, the smoke was white, and not black and roiling like when <br/>
a business or a house is on fire.<br/>
<br/>
Local news was doing continuous coverage last night.<br/>
<br/>
It was handled by the local fire department instead of the forestry guys, I <br/>
think mostly because the forestry guys were all busy elsewhere.  And it being <br/>
right between the river and an irrigation canal, they had LOTS of water.  It <br/>
was put out all with water, and not chemicals.  <br/>

<br/>
At 9:00 or so this morning, there were hot spots but no full-on flames and <br/>
smoke.  That might have changed.  I haven&#39;t looked at the news since then.<br/>
<br/>
It was might scary last night!<br/>
<br/>
They showed a house all in full flame on the news last night, but nobody was <br/>
living there.  It was under construction.  I don&#39;t know how far past frame it <br/>
was, but it didn&#39;t have all the everything yet.<br/>
<br/>
Where that is on the river, the houses on the west side are up pretty  high <br/>
on a bluff, not right at river level, and  on the east side, there&#39;s a fairly <br/>
big levee and overflow/irrigation canal between that and houses, many of which <br/>
have fields and orchards between their houses and the river.  So it wasn&#39;t <br/>
like the Los Alamos fire a few years back which was right in an among residences.<br/>

With the expected wind change at midnight, it will be blowing smoke into my neighborhood at 35mph.  They&#39;ve evacuated homes across the river -- we live on the west side, about 2mi from the river -- and some business and apartments within one mile of us.  Most of yesterday&#39;s evacuations were about air quality, not fire danger, so I&#39;m more than half expecting we may be<br/>
 evacuated tonight some time -- and they&#39;ve talked about planned, preventive power outages since smoke adversely affects power lines and transformers.  <br/>
 <br/>
the worst part?  It appears to be arson, with two separate points of origin, burning on both sides of the river......<br/>
