<div id="ygrps-yiv-965373206">Just one more thing.  Some of you who seem to jump quickly to Sandra&#39;s defense are forgetting that Sandra is the one usually screaming that she&#39;s been insulted when someone&#39;s posts are as blunt as her own usually are.  Twice maybe three times (can&#39;t remember exactly) this past week she accused others on the list of being insulting.  To me their posts were not near as offensive as hers.  <br/>
OK!  that&#39;s my one thing, said only for my own satisfaction.  Because I am now unsubscribe from the list and intend use my time more wisely.  There is a LOT of our time wasted here in front of this comuter discussing Sandra.  She must be flattered!<br/>
Thanks to those of you who were a great help to me with advice and comments.<br/>
