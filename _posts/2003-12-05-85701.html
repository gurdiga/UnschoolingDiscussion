<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896952578">My 6 year old son has announced that he&#39;s NOT going to go to work <br/>
when he&#39;s big like his daddy.  He&#39;s going to stay home and live with <br/>
us forever, and he&#39;s going to be an inventor and make money from his <br/>
inventions.  Cool!  He&#39;d be a really good inventor.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night he drew a diagram of an invention and dictated the <br/>
description of his picture to me for me to write down.  It was for a <br/>
Hershey Kiss making machine.  He&#39;s been to Hershey&#39;s chocolate world <br/>
and he&#39;s seen how they make kisses and I can tell that a lot of his <br/>
ideas came from there.  It was a really neat diagram of <br/>
an &quot;invention&quot; even if it wasn&#39;t an original idea. <br/>
<br/>
My dilemma--He wants me to mail it to Hershey today to see if they <br/>
like his &quot;invention&quot;.  Dh said I could pretend to mail it and then <br/>
write a letter back from &quot;Hershey&quot; saying that even though they <br/>
already have an invention like that, that he&#39;s a good inventor and he <br/>
should keep inventing things.  I don&#39;t know though, that seems <br/>
deceptive.  Some day he&#39;ll realize that&#39;s what I did and that might <br/>
hurt him.  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  Do I mail it to Hershey like he asked?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-657961198">I would consider mailing it. Who knows they may send your six yr. old <br/>
something cool in return.<br/>
Many manufactures know what their fans ages are and acknowledge that.<br/>
<br/>
One time 2 couple years ago my daughter was sitting on the bed playing with <br/>
Lego&#39;s. A piece she had was from a pirate ship so it was longer and skinny. We <br/>
suspected that she had inhaled it. After visiting two hospitals for x-rays <br/>
they could not find it. I called the Lego company to ask what their records said <br/>
as far as the danger of puncturing through her stomach or a lung and to tell <br/>
them that they dont show in an Xray. Anyway to make a long story short they <br/>
mailed her a big box of Duplo&#39;s for her age. <br/>
The Lego came out a few days later and we all celebrated.<br/>
<br/>
For a small child of 6 I think they would get a kick out of the interest he <br/>
has taken.<br/>

He&#39;s probably not expecting anything in return for his great idea.  He&#39;ll<br/>
probably be happy just mailing it in.  <br/>
Dylan used to send all kinds of ideas for dinosaur names and good hints<br/>
about where to look for dinosaurs to the Museum of the Rockies.  He never<br/>
expected anything in return, he was just happy to do his part for<br/>
science. &lt;g&gt;  One time they sent him a Velociraptor claw and told him<br/>
they appreciated his help.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

You son may or may not get a response (are you worried he won&#39;t?) but you can explain that. He may not want a response anyway, just the opportunity to share his idea with Hershey. But...They may like having a fan and future inventor and send him a letter, coupons, chocolate...Who knows? Give him the opportunity to find out. I&#39;ve sent off letters to corporations and you&#39;d be surprised how grateful they are for positive correspondence and how they show their appreciation for it.<br/>
  Go for it!<br/>

Maybe you could write a cover letter for it and say he had visited and was <br/>
talking about becoming an inventor, and had asked you to send his letter.<br/>

They might send him a form letter or a coupon, or he might get a real letter, <br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve mailed advertising slogans to Chik-Fil-A and engineering ideas to <br/>
Honda.  We got nice letters back.  The letter from Chik-Fil-A said they couldn&#39;t <br/>
use his ideas because they pay big bucks to an advertising firm to do their <br/>
advertising, and they couldn&#39;t keep the letter because they didn&#39;t want to be <br/>
accused of copyright violation (something like that).  They sent a couple coupons <br/>
for free kids meals. The letter from Honda said they would keep his idea on <br/>
file and if they ever needed it, they&#39;d contact him.  No free car coupons, <br/>
though!<br/>
<br/>
The attorneys for those companies have probably already carefully considered <br/>
how to handle letters like that from kids.  I&#39;m sure my son is not the only <br/>
kid who has written to them with their ideas.  The only drawback I could find <br/>
from the Honda one was that he thought he might get rich if they used his idea, <br/>
and he waited for an answer and dreamt out-loud about it for a couple of weeks <br/>
until they replied.  (His idea is a common one about magnetic cars, and he <br/>
sent a few drawings of how it could work.  He has since found that several of <br/>
his friends have had the same idea.)  <br/>
<br/>
I figured that you never know what those companies are going to do with a <br/>
letter like that, he might indeed get rich, it couldn&#39;t hurt, and it certainly <br/>
would provide a learning experience that I couldn&#39;t possibly manufacture.  He <br/>
dealt with them sincerely and they took him seriously and responded in kind, and <br/>
I&#39;m grateful that he had that experience.  <br/>

Also prepare him for no response.  My daughter, now age 7, spent hours<br/>

I would agree with Sandra and everyone else who said go ahead and send it<br/>
for him. I like the idea of letting them know how the whole thing came<br/>

a letter or something back. Your son will be excited I&#39;m sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055408284">Thanks for the input everyone.  Looks like Hershey will be getting <br/>
some mail from us!  :) <br/>
<br/>
I can see him being disappointed that they don&#39;t implement his idea.  <br/>
He wants to make money from his inventions so that he never has to <br/>
have a job. (Deep thought for a six year old!)  But if he gets <br/>
disappointed I&#39;ll remind him that a lot of inventors have lots of <br/>
inventions not succeed until they hit one that does.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629281553">I know there have been quite a few answering the same way,  but here&#39;s one more voice <br/>
saying,  &quot;By all means mail his letter, and a cover letter by you are him, introducing your <br/>
son, briefly,  might draw a sympathetic reader.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When our ds15 was 8,  he wrote a letter to Gov. Rosello (Puerto Rico).  He first <br/>
congratulated him on winning the election,  then introduced himself, and then decried the <br/>
fact that the mangroves where his &quot;papi&quot; (pronounced &quot;poppy&quot;--Spanish class for the day <br/>
folks  :~)  works and where manatees feed,  were being cut down.  He asked if there was <br/>
anything that Gov. Rosello could do to stop it.  He also included a photo of himself in the <br/>
letter.  (Not quite your typical activist inclusion,  but a nice touch, regardless.)<br/>
<br/>
He shortly received a very personal letter from the Gov.,  who commended him on being <br/>
concerned, at such a young age, with our environment.  He then explained in a manner <br/>
that I felt was very respectful, not patronizing, what he knew about the situation here <br/>
and wrote that he was forwarding the letter to the head of the Natural and Env. Res. <br/>
dept.   He then thanked Riali for his congratulations and for the photo, and sent <br/>
Christmas wishes to all of us on behalf of him and his wife.<br/>
<br/>
Within a month,  Riali then received a letter from the head of the Nat./Env. dept., which <br/>
again,  was very respectively written.   The man briefly explained the history of that <br/>
particular project (it was a private project, not gov&#39;t) and where it stood at the time <br/>
of the letter.  (in court)   <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say,  Riali was thrilled with the personal responses and I think that it gave <br/>
him a great sense of just how accessible those in gov&#39;t can be, if they so choose.  <br/>
Unfortunately our mangroves were destroyed,  it just seems here that the right pocket <br/>
gets lined and then any project whatsoever gets pushed through.<br/>
