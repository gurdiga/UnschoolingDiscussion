<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417057830">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i was wondering if they had tested you for the rubella titer (which would<br/>
mean you had contracted the disease and were immune) early in your<br/>
pregnancy?   we lived in ca. when i first got pregnant and it was mandated<br/>
that in early pregnancies women should be tested for rubella titer because<br/>
of the high risk rubella poses to the baby especially during the first 5<br/>
months.  a friend of mine&#39;s sister (who was a nurse at the time she got<br/>
pregnant), contracted rubella very early in her pregnancy and it caused<br/>
severe brain and neurological damage.  her baby was born with, i believe,<br/>
less than 1/2 her brain developed.  it was very sad.<br/>
<br/>
i also read the booked you mentioned (among others) when we where looking<br/>
into the effects of vaccines.  in may &#39;97 when my son was 20 months i came<br/>
down with still&#39;s disease (an autoimmune disease of the connective tissues<br/>
- stillsdisease.org) and some of the doctors tossed around the idea that it<br/>
may possibly be vaccine related (the mmr vaccine is know to have the side<br/>
effect of rheumatoid (sp) arthritis, the closest cousin to still&#39;s disease)<br/>
though that would be impossible to prove.  i was vaccinated in march &#39;89<br/>
for mmr ( another ca. state law to attend public institutions) and<br/>
contracted rubella in september &#39;92 and tested positive for the titer in<br/>
feb &#39;95.<br/>
<br/>
i know from my experience how hard it is to raise kids especially<br/>
homeschool when someone has a chronic illness.  i can&#39;t imagine how hard it<br/>
would be having a child with a chronic illness and what an emotional toll<br/>
that takes on you and your family.   good luck with the search for answers.<br/>
<br/>
best wishes<br/>

&gt; ����������I had to write and share something I<br/>

&gt; ����������&quot;Rubella is a contagious disease which is<br/>
&gt; usually so mild it often escapes detection. Symptoms include a runny<br/>
&gt; nose, sore throat, and slight fever (rarely above 100 degrees)...<br/>
&gt; Rubella is a nonthreatening disease when contracted by children.<br/>
&gt; Symptoms rarely last more than two to three days. However, if a pregnant<br/>
&gt; woman develops the disease during her first timester, her baby may be<br/>
&gt; born with birth defects. These include impaired vision and hearing, limb<br/>
&gt; defects, mental retardation, and heart malformations...<br/>
&gt; Rubella is a harmless disease in childhood, and it confers natural<br/>
&gt; immunity to those who contract it so they are ulikely to experience a<br/>
&gt; recurrence as adults. Today, because rubella vaccinations are routinely<br/>
&gt; given to children, most women never acquire natural immunity. If their<br/>
&gt; vaccine-induced immunity wears off, the threat of contracting rubella<br/>
&gt; during their childbearing years should actually increase...<br/>
&gt; In two separate scientific studies, the new rubella vaccine introduced<br/>
&gt; in 1979 was found to be the cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (also<br/>
&gt; known as the Epstein-Barr Virus, or the &quot;Yuppie&quot; disease), an<br/>
&gt; immunological disorder first reported in the U.S. in 1982. Given to<br/>
&gt; children, the vaccine can linger in their system for years and can be<br/>

&gt; ����������Now here&#39;s my story in regards to this, I<br/>
&gt; have a daughter with Noonan Syndrome see; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.noonansyndrome.org">http://www.noonansyndrome.org</a><br/>
&gt; to find out more about it. It escapes us and the medical community as to<br/>
&gt; the cause of this particular syndrome. In reading the above book and the<br/>
&gt; information I quoted here, I would like to tell my story and see if you<br/>
&gt; can see a connection.<br/>
&gt; ����������When I became pregnant with Rebecca we had<br/>
&gt; just move to Lansing, MI. I went to a clinic for testing to see if I was<br/>
&gt; indeed pregnant, but the test came back negative. Therefore, I went home<br/>
&gt; thinking I wasn&#39;t pregnant, but I was feeling aweful and I was dealing<br/>
&gt; with horrible morning sickness. I re-visited the clinic for testing and<br/>
&gt; once again the test came back negative. It was then suggested instead of<br/>
&gt; doing a urine test that I had a blood test done. The blood test came<br/>
&gt; back postive and I began to search for a OBGYN.<br/>
&gt; ����������Once found, I went regularly to my visits,<br/>
&gt; as I felt so badly all of the time. Like stated above I constantly ran<br/>
&gt; low- grade fevers, I had a nasty sinus infection, sore throat, etc. It<br/>
&gt; was funny that the doctor could never come up with an official due date<br/>
&gt; for me either, it kept changing and he gave me no answers for my fevers.<br/>
&gt; All I remember from that pregnancy is how miserable I was and why I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t get rid of the fevers or the sinus difficultly.<br/>
&gt; ������������When Becca was born it was very<br/>
&gt; difficult and I won&#39;t go into that whole experience here, except to say<br/>
&gt; that right away we knew that there was a problem and there was a lot to<br/>
&gt; deal with. Eventually, Rebecca was diagnosed with Noonan Syndrome. So<br/>
&gt; here I am dealing with all this and I&#39;m totally wiped out, tired all of<br/>
&gt; the time! I kept going back to the doctor trying to find out what was<br/>
&gt; wrong with me to no avail. I had a bunch of tests done, but the only<br/>
&gt; thing that they found was I had had the Epstein-Barr Virus and that I<br/>
&gt; just must have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. At the time, I just had to<br/>
&gt; learn to deal with it and eventually over the years I changed my diet,<br/>
&gt; etc. to help me to overcome all the physical problems that I was<br/>
&gt; experiencing.<br/>
&gt; ����������Needless to say, when I was reading this<br/>
&gt; section on Rubella in Neil Millers book, all the symptoms sounded like<br/>
&gt; me and what I went through during that time in my life. I wonder now if<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t have rubella. Rebecca certainly has the impairments mentioned<br/>

&gt; contracted rubella during her first trimester of pregnancy.<br/>
&gt; ����������I&#39;m also wondering how many moms of NS<br/>
&gt; kids had the rubella vaccines when they were younger and if many of them<br/>
&gt; experianced similar symptoms to what I did during their pregnancies? It<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007338035">I think the worse part of the &quot;you must vaccine&quot; mentality is that they<br/>
make sure folks don&#39;t know that they have options.  For instance, in CA you<br/>
do NOT have to vaccinate.  They prefer that you do and they will not inform<br/>
you that you simply have to fill out a blue slip that says you don&#39;t want<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879262533">when you went in for your first pre-natal they would have asked if you had<br/>
the shot and then wouldn&#39;t have checked the blood.  This is where the big<br/>
concern comes in because, just like the Hep B/A, they have no idea how long<br/>
the vaccine lasts.  The same goes for the whooping cough.  There was a<br/>
major outbreak last year and it went roaring through ps middle and high<br/>
schools with over 90% of the kids getting having been vaccinated against<br/>
it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Susan,<br/>
&gt;      I have no idea.  My daughter with NS is 13 now and we&#39;ve had so<br/>
&gt; much testing done that I couldn&#39;t tell you one from the other anymore.<br/>
&gt; All I know is when I was reading Neil Miller&#39;s book, it was like a light<br/>
&gt; bulb went off for the first time since she was born.  I don&#39;t recall the<br/>
&gt; doctors ever saying anything about rubella, so I doubt the titer was<br/>
&gt; done.  My mother did say I had the vaccine as a child.<br/>
&gt;      It has been difficult in the education dept. with Rebecca.  She is<br/>
&gt; the reason I started unschooling last year.  I suppose I should<br/>
&gt; introduce myself, since I&#39;ve been lurking for a couple of weeks and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; new to the list.   I&#39;m Robin from Michigan (I noticed another Robin on<br/>
&gt; the list),  I have 5 kids, 2, 3, 11, 13, & 18 y/o.  I&#39;ve been home<br/>
&gt; schooling for 13 years.  My oldest went into the PS in 8th grade and<br/>
&gt; graduates this year, thank G-d!  Anyhow, Rebecca just couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
&gt; our school at home style, even with unit studies, etc. and it was major<br/>
&gt; fustration around here, so I had to find a new approach and it was<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  She made a comment to me the other day that she really<br/>
&gt; likes reading now that she can read what interests her.  I was glad to<br/>
&gt; read all your conversations on math when I joined, because she won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; touch it with a 10 foot pole.  Although, now and then I have seen<br/>
&gt; evidence from her, on trying to figure out a math problem on her own.<br/>
&gt; If I were to compare Rebecca to other kids her age she is definately<br/>
&gt; behind, but for herself I think she is doing just fine now.  Although,<br/>
&gt; my husband and parents makes comments of worry about it every now and<br/>
&gt; then, I don&#39;t think they have the same confidence that I do.  I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt; learning to trust her where shes at, thats been a big relief for me and<br/>
&gt; her!<br/>
&gt;      Eventually, I promised Lisa I would do a bio on our homeschooling<br/>
&gt; experience from school at home to unschooling.  Its just finding the<br/>
&gt; time, as I sub at the Post Office besides taking care of my crew.<br/>
&gt;      You all have a Happy Turkey Day!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023044066">&lt;&lt;hi, <br/>
i was wondering if they had tested you for the rubella titer (which<br/>
would mean you had contracted the disease and were immune) early in your<br/>
pregnancy? �&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Susan,<br/>
     I have no idea.  My daughter with NS is 13 now and we&#39;ve had so<br/>
much testing done that I couldn&#39;t tell you one from the other anymore.<br/>
All I know is when I was reading Neil Miller&#39;s book, it was like a light<br/>
bulb went off for the first time since she was born.  I don&#39;t recall the<br/>
doctors ever saying anything about rubella, so I doubt the titer was<br/>
done.  My mother did say I had the vaccine as a child.<br/>
     It has been difficult in the education dept. with Rebecca.  She is<br/>
the reason I started unschooling last year.  I suppose I should<br/>
introduce myself, since I&#39;ve been lurking for a couple of weeks and I&#39;m<br/>
new to the list.   I&#39;m Robin from Michigan (I noticed another Robin on<br/>
the list),  I have 5 kids, 2, 3, 11, 13, & 18 y/o.  I&#39;ve been home<br/>
schooling for 13 years.  My oldest went into the PS in 8th grade and<br/>
graduates this year, thank G-d!  Anyhow, Rebecca just couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
our school at home style, even with unit studies, etc. and it was major<br/>
fustration around here, so I had to find a new approach and it was<br/>
unschooling.  She made a comment to me the other day that she really<br/>
likes reading now that she can read what interests her.  I was glad to<br/>
read all your conversations on math when I joined, because she won&#39;t<br/>
touch it with a 10 foot pole.  Although, now and then I have seen<br/>
evidence from her, on trying to figure out a math problem on her own.<br/>
If I were to compare Rebecca to other kids her age she is definately<br/>
behind, but for herself I think she is doing just fine now.  Although,<br/>
my husband and parents makes comments of worry about it every now and<br/>
then, I don&#39;t think they have the same confidence that I do.  I&#39;m just<br/>
learning to trust her where shes at, thats been a big relief for me and<br/>
her!<br/>
     Eventually, I promised Lisa I would do a bio on our homeschooling<br/>
experience from school at home to unschooling.  Its just finding the<br/>
time, as I sub at the Post Office besides taking care of my crew.<br/>
     You all have a Happy Turkey Day!!<br/>
      Robin :-)<br/>
