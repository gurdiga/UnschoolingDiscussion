<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106303013">I grabbed How Children Learn and How Children Fail at the library <br/>
tonight.  Which should I read first?  I thought I&#39;d look at the <br/>
copyright date and see which was published first, but it seems they <br/>
were both originally published in 1964.  Maybe I&#39;m being way too anal <br/>
here and it doesn&#39;t matter which I read first but they look like <br/>
companion books and I thought it would make sense to read them in <br/>
order in case one built on the other.  I&#39;ve read some John Holt over <br/>
the years, but I haven&#39;t read any of his very first books.<br/>

I think that when I read them, my wonderful friend Dorothy had me read How<br/>
Children Fail first and then read How children Learn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the list in published order. The first ones are about school reform<br/>
and the later ones show his realization that it wouldn&#39;t work because<br/>
children didn&#39;t have the free choice to be there.<br/>
<br/>
1964 - How Children Fail, by John Holt (Pitman Publishing)<br/>
<br/>
1967 - How Children Learn, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>
<br/>
1969 - The Underachieving School, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>
<br/>
1970 - What Do I Do Monday?, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>
<br/>
1974 - Escape from Childhood, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>
<br/>
1976 - Instead of Education, by John Holt (E.P. Dutton)<br/>
<br/>
1981 - Teach Your Own, by John Holt (Delacorte Press)<br/>
<br/>
1989 - Learning All the Time, by John Holt (Addison-Wesley)<br/>
<br/>
1990 - A Life Worth Living: The Selected Letters of John Holt, edited<br/>
by Susannah Sheffer (Ohio State Univ. Press)<br/>
<br/>
1997 - Growing Without Schooling: A Record of a Grassroots Movement<br/>
(Holt/GWS)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832685257">My personal preference is How Children Fail.  It has so many  real life examples demonstrating WHY certain methods seldom work. <br/>
It is also from a viewpoint of JH  changing his own assumptions because of his experiences.   Provides good reasons to examine one&#39;s own  ideas and move toward thinking in a different manner. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, How Children Learn,  was a little more &quot;theoretical&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Escape from Childhood and Instead of Education are a little more &quot;out there&quot;  for a &quot;beginner&quot;,  although when I re-read them years later they made MUCH  more sense.   I always compared the change in my reactions to be similar to the change from my early ideas that I &quot;might&quot;  breastfeed for as &quot;long&quot; as six months to  deciding that weaning at six months was very, very, early. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-640834423">Thanks for the list; I&#39;ve printed it for my binder.  I read some John<br/>
Holt years ago but since I&#39;ve never broken the habit of taking copious<br/>
notes when I read, my memory for what I&#39;ve read is dim and since I&#39;ve<br/>
lost my notes I&#39;m not even sure which book(s) I&#39;ve read.  I only<br/>
remember his detailed description of children learning to talk and how<br/>
ridiculous it would be if it were broken down the way reading is, and<br/>
taught one &quot;skill&quot; at a time.<br/>
