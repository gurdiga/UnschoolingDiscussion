&lt;&lt; I&#39;d love a wonderful place to learn about unschooling, I just wish I <br/>
didn&#39;t <br/>
have to wade through so much (what I view as) extraneous discussion!  I guess <br/>
I&#39;ll sit back and read for a while longer.  Thanks for the kind greeting. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614510206">I read something today at the unschooling.com site that made me <br/>
think of the recent thread about why do people who claim to have <br/>
read alot about unschooling still ask the same questions.<br/>
Nancy Wooten mentioned in an article that unschooling scares people <br/>
because it offers no guarantee.  This could be a reason why we feel <br/>
the need to ask the same quesitons over again.  Hoping that maybe <br/>
this one answered question will be the &#39;click&#39; that&#39;ll put <br/>
everything in place and offer more security in embarking on the <br/>
unschooling adventure.  Kind of like how some people ask the same <br/>
question worded slightly differently in hopes of getting the answer <br/>
to fit better to their ideas.  Sort of manipulating the answer so it <br/>
fits the question.  That combined with the need to feel special.  It <br/>
all points to our insecurities.  <br/>
<br/>
I think. :)<br/>
