<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Here is a description by Michelle Malkin in the St. Louis<br/>
&gt; Post-Dispatch: Death Row Marv is &quot;a half-foot-tall replica<br/>
&gt; of a<br/>
&gt; violent character created by surly graphic artist Frank<br/>
&gt; Miller.... He comes with &quot;the chair, wired helmet,<br/>
&gt; floorboards<br/>
&gt; and electrocuting switch.&quot; For $23.95, you, too, can<br/>
&gt; purchase<br/>
&gt; the &quot;deluxe box set&quot; and share the cheap thrill of<br/>
&gt; executing a<br/>
&gt; murderer: &quot;Feel the burn as the electric buzz fills the<br/>
&gt; room and<br/>
&gt; he starts to shake and convulse,&quot; an ad promotion for<br/>
&gt; Death Row<br/>
&gt; Marv beckons. &quot;Experience the pain as the shaking<br/>
&gt; continues and<br/>
&gt; his eyes start to glow bright red. Enjoy the torment as he<br/>
&gt; utters his famous last words, &#39;Is that the best you can<br/>
&gt; do, you<br/>
&gt; pansies?&#39; &quot;<br/>

&gt; Subject:    Withdraw &quot;Death Row Marv&quot; Dolls<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dear McFarlane Toys:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Death Row Marv is unbelievably vulgar and gross.  It<br/>
&gt; appeals to<br/>
&gt; brutal tendencies and callously attempts to portray the<br/>
&gt; tragedy<br/>
&gt; of taking human life as humorous.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please withdraw this insensitive, coarse &quot;toy&quot; from the<br/>
&gt; market<br/>
&gt; at once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; drf21<br/>
