<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441747636">I&#39;m asking you because you&#39;re used to thinking outside the box, and I want <br/>
some different opinions from the ones I&#39;ve been getting.<br/>
<br/>
My son, age 27 months, is energetic. Spirited, some have called him. Hell on <br/>
wheels, say others. :) He very much lives to his own agenda -- didn&#39;t say a <br/>
single word in English until 18 months -- won&#39;t respond to anything if he&#39;s <br/>
engrossed in something -- refuses to communicate unless it&#39;s his idea -- <br/>
etc. He&#39;s loving and responsive with me and with my husband, but with other <br/>
people he sometimes is charming and engaging, but mostly is aloof and looks <br/>
right through them. This includes grandparents, to their chagrin. I think he <br/>
has a delightful personality and I love just watching him when he&#39;s all <br/>
closed off from the world, doing his little thing.<br/>
<br/>
So, the problem is that Benny has opposite reactions to things -- caffeine <br/>
makes him focus or go to sleep. Cough medicine makes him insanely hyper. <br/>
Uppers take him down, downers take him up. I don&#39;t know MUCH about this but <br/>
people are telling me I need to take him to a pediatrician and get him <br/>
&quot;diagnosed&quot; because he may have some sort of problem. I just don&#39;t feel that <br/>
he could possibly be any of these things (hyperactive, add, whatever) <br/>
because he has a very long attention span for something he is interested in, <br/>
very very long.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s recently had some sleep pattern changes -- waking up at one am and <br/>
peacefully sitting in his bed reading to himself, or playing with whatever&#39;s <br/>
in his room. Going back to sleep at five or so. He&#39;s also gotten extremely <br/>
extremely obsessive about alphabet-related things. Like the Dr. Seuss ABC <br/>
book/video, which he must have many many times all the time (and it has to <br/>
be read exactly the same way every time). Like his sponge letters/magnet <br/>
letters, which he must put in order in ways that involve little rituals like <br/>
going from room to room, when he can&#39;t find one he goes crazy. He will type <br/>
the alphabet into the computer and then delete it up to 10 times in a row. <br/>
It&#39;s kind of TOO intense and weird. The only books he wants to look at are <br/>
alphabet/number books, the only videos are alphabet/number videos, etc. It&#39;s <br/>
all he thinks or talks about -- last night in the middle of the night the <br/>
first sound I heard out of the monitor when he woke up was &quot;THE NUMBER <br/>
FOUR!&quot; in a sonorous tone. ?????<br/>
<br/>
What is going on with him? I *will not* allow some assembly line <br/>
pediatrician to stamp some label on him and hand me a prescription to fix <br/>
him -- I think he is just perfect. However, I worry that he&#39;s getting <br/>
stressed out with all these rituals he forces himself through and all this <br/>
repetition and &quot;studying&quot; -- he&#39;s only two ferchrissakes. And the thing with <br/>
the caffeine is worrying to my parents -- they are convinced there&#39;s <br/>
something wrong with him and that he needs ritalin. ??? Am I being stupid to <br/>
ignore this and just say HE IS FINE and press on? I mean, SHOULD I get him <br/>
looked at? The thought fills me with utter dread.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
LILY<br/>

DON&#39;T DO IT! Ok, really don&#39;t take him unless you really think something is going on with him.  <br/>
<br/>
and added:<br/>
&lt;&lt;(hyperactive, add, whatever)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really hate these words, and their diagnoses. ADD... what does that mean? To me, conform to what *I (meaning school, adults, society) says is normal :P Blech!<br/>

Your ds reminds me of my oldest, actually your entire post reminds me of things I have said before :) My oldest was/is spirited, but he has calmed down a lot since 2 :) I usually say that I was blessed with this child because he taught me SOOOO much!  <br/>
<br/>
then she asked:<br/>
&lt;&lt;they are convinced there&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think you are being stupid at all! Again, if you really are concerned take him to see someone. Luckily I had a great ped (he was actually only a sub-ped ;( )who told me that because ds doesn&#39;t sit a whole lot, that school will be the first calling saying, He needs ritalin....  <br/>
<br/>
Just confirmed that unschooling for me, LOL!<br/>

<br/>
Okay, my first advice is to try not to worry.  Whatever happens <br/>
happens and we deal with it and get through it and move on.  Worrying <br/>
just makes it less fun.<br/>
<br/>
My second advice is to go to the website that Kate sent the other day <br/>
for NIMH and read up on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and other <br/>
disorders.  The better educated you are yourself, the more likely you <br/>
will obtain proper treatment if it is needed and avoid unnecessary <br/>
treatment by doctors who think drugs are always the answer.<br/>
<br/>
My third advice is to tell the grandparents that LOTS of kids react <br/>
that way to caffeine.  It is not an idication that they must be put on <br/>
ritalin (which is also a stimulant).  <br/>
<br/>
The only thing that concerns me about your son as you describe him is <br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I worry that he&#39;s getting stressed out with all these rituals he <br/>
&gt; forces himself through and all this repetition and &quot;studying&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he is unhappy and frustrated with himeself, I would do something, <br/>
I&#39;d be cautious and learn all I could first, but I would take him for <br/>
an evaluation.  If he is not unhappy and you are not overly concerned <br/>
about his health, I would leave it be for a while and just keep <br/>
learning all I could.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you in some way, even if it is just helpful knowing <br/>
that others are going through similar things and you are not alone.  <br/>
Wyndham is going in for an evaluation next week because his repetitive <br/>
behaviours are starting to bother him.  I never took him before <br/>
because he was never concerned but now he is, so I am.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262016308">It sounds to me like you are framing your observations of his<br/>
behavior according to the labels you think folks want to put on<br/>
him.  A Mom can deny that anything is wrong - just like we can<br/>
delude ourselves that the lump in our breast isn&#39;t really there -<br/>
but most often a Mom knows if there is something wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I think you identified 3 areas of possible concern (1)<br/>
differences in interpersonal reactions (2) paradoxical reactions<br/>
to common drugs (3) intense concentration, characterized as<br/>
ritualistic.  Let me take on #2 first, because it is the most<br/>
objective - Kids are supposed to have paradoxical reaction to<br/>
common drugs.  That&#39;s why Ritalin, a stimulant for adults, is<br/>
used to &quot;slow down&quot; hyperactive kids.  The interpersonal<br/>
reactions may be driving the concerns being raised by others - as<br/>
in &quot;Any normal kid would love me to pieces; if he doesn&#39;t there<br/>
must be something wrong.&quot;  Taint necessarily so.  Some kids are<br/>
more attached than others, or may have periods of being more self<br/>
conscious/detached from strangers.  The ritualized behavior you<br/>
describe is harder to get a hold of, because the label itself<br/>
carries so much weight.  Can you remember a time when he was<br/>
trying to learn something else - like first mastering walking or<br/>
using eating utensils?  If he conquers new important tasks with a<br/>
single minded concentration you may be on the cusp of early<br/>
reading; you certainly have discovered something about his<br/>
learning style that will help you in offering new information<br/>
over the years.  One thing to try, to see if the letters are a<br/>
compulsion or a fascination, is to do something different.  Go to<br/>
a woodsy park and walk around looking at wild flowers - or go to<br/>
the zoo - or hit a kid&#39;s museum - find a train display -<br/>
something that he is likely to like, but that is not going to<br/>
trigger alphabet thoughts.  See if he engages in a different<br/>
situation or if he dreadfully misses the letters.  If he does,<br/>
wait a couple of weeks and try again with a different activity.<br/>
<br/>
While early identification of some disabilities may make a world<br/>
of difference for some kids, misdiagnosis and early mislabeling<br/>
always makes a difference, typically a bad one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925920319">Well, I was going to keep quiet for a little while (I just joined yesterday) but your son sounds very much like the son of a good friend of mine, especially the intense focus (near obsession) when learning something new and the strong reactions to chemicals. Have you read &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child: A Guide For Parents Whose Child is More *Intense *Sensitive *Perceptive *Persistent *Energetic&quot; by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka? It was my friend&#39;s bible in the early years (her son is now 5).<br/>
<br/>
MY friend also has a extremely informative website on spirited children:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nurturingourfamilies.com/spirited/index.html">http://www.nurturingourfamilies.com/spirited/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Tons of reading and info on nurturing the spirit of these wonderful, intense children. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that this helps...I will try to post an intro soon, my 2 yo just woke up and is sitting on my lap...not really conducive to typing fast lol!<br/>

<br/>
Lily, I remember being two and being just as fascinated with things like<br/>
your son.  People used to say I was &quot;retarded&quot; because I didn&#39;t talk<br/>
until I was three.  But when I talked, I talked like an adult.  I can<br/>
remember listening to adult conversation and understanding every bit of<br/>
it when I was one and a half .  I tuned people out to explore my<br/>
imagination.  I was also fascinated with letters and words.  When I<br/>
learned to read, I would read a book forwards and literally backwards<br/>
several times.  It was fun for me.  I also used to &quot;obsess&quot; over noises I<br/>
could make with my nose and mouth and throat.  I would go for long<br/>
periods of time gazing at the patterns on linoleum and wallpaper and<br/>
ceilings with symmetrical patterns.  I would make up songs and sing them<br/>
over and over again.  My brother used to spend long periods of time<br/>
looking at himself in the mirror and making weird faces at himself.  He<br/>
has a very good sense of humor.  My brother is a genius.  He used to be<br/>
obsessed with electrical parts.  He knew how the truck motor worked when<br/>
he was four.  When he was two, he would have a daily ritual of<br/>
disassembling our phonograph and tape recorder.  We would scold him, so<br/>
he would reassemble them and they worked fine.  I used to think, what a<br/>
strange kid, but now I know my step mom just unschooled him, letting him<br/>
explore his interests.  As an older child, his bedroom floor was<br/>
literally covered with circuits and parts for circuits.  He works for<br/>
Microsoft and is doing just fine.  Maybe some would say I had ADD as a<br/>
child and others would say my brother was hyperactive.  <br/>
You say he forces himself to do this.  My son Rex was sort of like that<br/>
only in different things when he was young.  For example, his shoelaces<br/>
had to be tied perfectly symmetrically.  He would do them over and over<br/>
again, and squeal in frustration every time it wasn&#39;t.  His toys had to<br/>
be in a certain order.  He seemed like maybe he was hyperactive or<br/>
something, but the teachers always said they didn&#39;t think so because he<br/>
did have such a long attention span when it was something he liked.  My<br/>
cousin was on ritalin as a child.  When I mentioned it to her talking<br/>
about my son&#39;s behavior, she was very much passionately against it.  She<br/>
said it ruined her childhood.  She said we should just let children be<br/>
and they will turn out okay.  I think you should keep giving him what he<br/>
wants-the opportunity to &quot;repeat and study&quot; and new things to explore. <br/>
Hey, that is how the brain learns things.  At any rate, how does your<br/>
son&#39;s behavior hurt him.  Since he is only two, I wouldn&#39;t worry about<br/>
it.  There is no hurry.  But then, I am not a doctor and am not qualified<br/>
to give medical advice.  He sounds like he wants to read.  Can he read? <br/>
I have a friend whose son taught himself to read at two asking her what<br/>
the words said in books as she was reading to him.  Your son sounds like<br/>
he knows what he wants.  Let him lead, I say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367180040">Does he seem extremely stressed to you, keeping in mind that the average two <br/>
year old can seem pretty stressed?<br/>
<br/>
Do you worry about him on days when you don&#39;t have friends and family telling <br/>
you to worry?<br/>
<br/>
If you think that having a diagnosis could help you to understand him better <br/>
and improve his life and yours, you have reason to have him evaluated. <br/>
Otherwise, tell the critics to hush.<br/>

obsessive-compulsive disorder in children, for example. Also look for sites <br/>
about &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; reactions to stimulants, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I once read up on obsessive-compulsive disorder and one thing that really <br/>
struck me was that adults with it so often said that they wished their <br/>
parents had recognized it and dealt with it when they were children - that it <br/>
would have saved them many years of difficulty if their parents had admitted <br/>
there was something wrong and sought help for them as early as possible. <br/>

ignore this and just say HE IS FINE and press on? I mean, SHOULD I get him <br/>
looked at?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t.  He has the one big proving symptom of ADD, which is that uppers <br/>
slow him.  You can have all the OTHER symptoms, but if they then give you <br/>
ritalin and and speeds you up more, they&#39;ll say it wasn&#39;t ADD.<br/>
<br/>
If you know what you already know, maybe you could get him to like iced tea! <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
Or let him drink coffee.  Or get the coffee-bean snacky stuff or something.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine that use of caffeine could be more dangerous than a steady <br/>
&quot;diet&quot; of ritalin.<br/>
<br/>
Others might already have said all this.  I have a lot of mail in the box. <br/>
But since he&#39;s not in school, he&#39;s not disrupting a classroom.  Since he&#39;s <br/>
not disrupting a classroom, and you can plan your day around his patterns, <br/>
and you&#39;re not personally upset by it, no problem requiring medication.<br/>
<br/>
I would NOT get a diagnosis, and I would just tell the grandparents he&#39;ll <br/>
change as he gets older.  I had one who avoided eye contact with new people <br/>
(including relatives, on the first few meetings), and in a way he still does. <br/>
 His meeting of new people is more tentative than the other two kids&#39;, and if <br/>
the house gets crowded he&#39;ll find something to do in his room or outside for <br/>
a while, until he&#39;s recharged and comes back out.<br/>

used to &quot;slow down&quot; hyperactive kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>

There are adults on ritalin too.  It&#39;s not just being a kid that makes <br/>
ritalin act as it does in some people.<br/>

If all stimulants slowed all kids down, coca cola would be a great bedtime <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107259840">Hi Lilly,<br/>
<br/>
Your ds sounds amazingly bright.  Occasionally, kids who are extremely<br/>
intelligent look &quot;a little nuts&quot; to others.  I had a friend whose child was<br/>
breezing through 7th grade curriculums at 8 yo.  This child was truly<br/>
different acting as a young child.  She didn&#39;t sleep, banged her head, all<br/>
kinds of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you have your son checked out and are not happy with what is recommended,<br/>
you might consider going to someone experienced with very gifted children.<br/>

child is getting frustrated or upset with himself, even at that age, <br/>
I&#39;d consider it.  THAT is the one symptom I would never ignore or <br/>
brush off as normal.  An unhappy child needs something and it is the <br/>
parent&#39;s job to find out what.<br/>
<br/>
But the one thing I would definitely do, is educate myself about the <br/>
various disorders and their symptoms.  That way you will be less <br/>
likely to get mistreated by the medical system.<br/>

It&#39;s  highly likely that the person who made the statement about an unhappy <br/>
child was talking about any unhappy child, and not the particular child of <br/>
another person here.  &quot;Throwing some of what [we&#39;ve] dealt with&quot; is always a <br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] I need help<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m asking you because you&#39;re used to thinking outside the box, and I want<br/>
&gt; some different opinions from the ones I&#39;ve been getting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son, age 27 months, is energetic. Spirited, some have called him. Hell<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; wheels, say others. :) He very much lives to his own agenda -- didn&#39;t say<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; single word in English until 18 months -- won&#39;t respond to anything if<br/>
he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; engrossed in something -- refuses to communicate unless it&#39;s his idea --<br/>
&gt; etc. He&#39;s loving and responsive with me and with my husband, but with<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; people he sometimes is charming and engaging, but mostly is aloof and<br/>
looks<br/>
&gt; right through them. This includes grandparents, to their chagrin. I think<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; has a delightful personality and I love just watching him when he&#39;s all<br/>
&gt; closed off from the world, doing his little thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, the problem is that Benny has opposite reactions to things -- caffeine<br/>
&gt; makes him focus or go to sleep. Cough medicine makes him insanely hyper.<br/>
&gt; Uppers take him down, downers take him up. I don&#39;t know MUCH about this<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; people are telling me I need to take him to a pediatrician and get him<br/>
&gt; &quot;diagnosed&quot; because he may have some sort of problem. I just don&#39;t feel<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; he could possibly be any of these things (hyperactive, add, whatever)<br/>
&gt; because he has a very long attention span for something he is interested<br/>
in,<br/>
&gt; very very long.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s recently had some sleep pattern changes -- waking up at one am and<br/>
&gt; peacefully sitting in his bed reading to himself, or playing with<br/>
whatever&#39;s<br/>
&gt; in his room. Going back to sleep at five or so. He&#39;s also gotten extremely<br/>
&gt; extremely obsessive about alphabet-related things. Like the Dr. Seuss ABC<br/>
&gt; book/video, which he must have many many times all the time (and it has to<br/>
&gt; be read exactly the same way every time). Like his sponge letters/magnet<br/>
&gt; letters, which he must put in order in ways that involve little rituals<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; going from room to room, when he can&#39;t find one he goes crazy. He will<br/>
type<br/>
&gt; the alphabet into the computer and then delete it up to 10 times in a row.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s kind of TOO intense and weird. The only books he wants to look at are<br/>
&gt; alphabet/number books, the only videos are alphabet/number videos, etc.<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; all he thinks or talks about -- last night in the middle of the night the<br/>
&gt; first sound I heard out of the monitor when he woke up was &quot;THE NUMBER<br/>
&gt; FOUR!&quot; in a sonorous tone. ?????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What is going on with him? I *will not* allow some assembly line<br/>
&gt; pediatrician to stamp some label on him and hand me a prescription to fix<br/>
&gt; him -- I think he is just perfect. However, I worry that he&#39;s getting<br/>
&gt; stressed out with all these rituals he forces himself through and all this<br/>
&gt; repetition and &quot;studying&quot; -- he&#39;s only two ferchrissakes. And the thing<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; the caffeine is worrying to my parents -- they are convinced there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; something wrong with him and that he needs ritalin. ??? Am I being stupid<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; ignore this and just say HE IS FINE and press on? I mean, SHOULD I get him<br/>
&gt; looked at? The thought fills me with utter dread.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Love,<br/>
&gt; LILY<br/>

&quot;stimulates&quot; the neurons that inhibit response.  That is, hyper people&#39;s<br/>
neurons fire slower which makes them more impulsive or distracted etc and then<br/>
the stimulant helps those thingies fire faster making them have more impulse<br/>
control. <br/>
Sorry my medical terminalogy is so inadequate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880036961">No one has a right to dictate *how* someone offers unschooling advice.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is to help people become or be better at<br/>
unschooling. And the way people will go about helping others do that will<br/>
naturally reflect that purpose.<br/>
<br/>
So *what* advice people give will always be naturally steered back in the<br/>
direction of unschooling because Unschooling Is The Purpose Of This List.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean anyone is wrong for doing what they feel is best. But the<br/>
list isn&#39;t for advice on doing what you feel is best, it&#39;s for advice on how<br/>
to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
*Everyone* is welcome! :-) I hung out with the unschoolers long before I<br/>
became one just for the flow of ideas and new way of looking at things. But<br/>
it helps to keep the purpose of the list in mind.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re mad enough to spit bullets right now over something someone said,<br/>
go ahead and write the post to get it out of your system but send it to your<br/>
Drafts Folder. Or send it to me. Or send it to your best friend. Or your<br/>
worst enemy. Just *don&#39;t* send to the list until you can view the situation<br/>
without anger.<br/>

folks as being funny or in-your-face or rude.  However, that is part of the<br/>
show and everyone who participates knows what to expect, or should know what<br/>
to expect.<br/>
<br/>
Without a disclaimer on this list, lots of folks aren&#39;t expecting<br/>
comments/responses that could be/have been called rude,<br/>
up-along-side-your-head or wake up calls.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe along with angry responses going into the draft file for review, other<br/>
posts could go there to be reviewed for &quot;how will other people see this&quot; and<br/>
&quot;is this a knee jerk reaction&quot; and &quot;maybe I should ask somemore questions<br/>
first to understand &#39;exactly&#39; what this poster is saying.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There have been dozens of threads that errupted into &quot;fights&quot; that could<br/>
have been easily resolved if the draft folder had been used for the above as<br/>
well as the angry.  There have been dozens of folks who left the list very<br/>
quickly who might not have had the above been used.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought on that draft folder.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] TIME OUT!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; No one has a right to dictate *how* someone offers unschooling advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The purpose of this list is to help people become or be better at<br/>
&gt; unschooling. And the way people will go about helping others do that will<br/>
&gt; naturally reflect that purpose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So *what* advice people give will always be naturally steered back in the<br/>
&gt; direction of unschooling because Unschooling Is The Purpose Of This List.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That doesn&#39;t mean anyone is wrong for doing what they feel is best. But<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; list isn&#39;t for advice on doing what you feel is best, it&#39;s for advice on<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; to unschool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Everyone* is welcome! :-) I hung out with the unschoolers long before I<br/>
&gt; became one just for the flow of ideas and new way of looking at things.<br/>
But<br/>
&gt; it helps to keep the purpose of the list in mind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re mad enough to spit bullets right now over something someone<br/>
said,<br/>
&gt; go ahead and write the post to get it out of your system but send it to<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; Drafts Folder. Or send it to me. Or send it to your best friend. Or your<br/>
&gt; worst enemy. Just *don&#39;t* send to the list until you can view the<br/>
situation<br/>
&gt; without anger.<br/>

allergies do seem to run in families.  Often it is only due to similar diets<br/>
and lifestyle.  A lot of food allergies are caused by the digestive process<br/>
letting larger particles pass through the intestinal wall when it shouldn&#39;t. <br/>
Then the body treats these as invaders and begins the process to fight them<br/>
(allergies).  Often when the leaky gut has been repaired, those foods no longer<br/>
cause allergic reaction.  That has been our experience.<br/>

There have been a few people lately telling of  leaving in a huff, or <br/>
almost leaving but sticking around because the words said, even <br/>
though they felt defensive, stuck with them.  <br/>
  Not everyone is going to like it.  When people leave, it is their <br/>
loss(or not), but people do stay and gain many valuable insights.  I <br/>
would hate for the passionate experiences unschoolers to not speak <br/>
their mind.  Including you.<br/>

You inherit the allergic gene from your parents, but how it manifests<br/>
itself can be different.  For example, you have hayfever and your<br/>
husband does not have allergies.  Your child inherits the allergic gene<br/>
from you, but your child&#39;s allergies are to different foods, ie. eggs,<br/>
wheat, gluten, etc.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233178522">they are tracing some food allergies to ethnic ancestry and as such they do<br/>
run in families.  Other allergies are being traced to local with the family<br/>
members having simpy a predisposition to being sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
We use to live in what some thought was the allergy capital of the world.<br/>
The local radio station and the newspaper use to tell you what to watch out<br/>
for each day!<br/>
<br/>
My mother use to come visit and go home miserable.  I finally asked one of<br/>
the docs why.  I couldn&#39;t figure it out since they had the same allergens<br/>
where she lived.  He said the difference was that her sinuses were so busy<br/>
fending off the smog where she lived that the allergens never really got<br/>
through to bother her.  Then when she&#39;s come to visit us it was instant<br/>
allergy bomb.<br/>
<br/>
Allergies are really strange to track and find out how they work.  It was a<br/>
kidlet project a few years ago when they bought a microscope.  You do NOT<br/>
want to know all the things they looked at with that thing.  Yuck, yuck,<br/>
yuck!!!!<br/>
