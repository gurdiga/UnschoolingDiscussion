<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071881191">I think it was a couple of weeks ago when someone posted a question about<br/>
children learning from movies, but I have been having mail problems and<br/>
am not sure who. Anyway, I wanted to post about my day yesterday when I<br/>
couldn&#39;t *stop* my 5dd(Jenni) from learning from a movie (or maybe I<br/>
could).<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday evening I was really tired, cranky and kinda pre-fluish. I<br/>
opened up our sofa bed in the living room and asked Jenni to pick out a<br/>
tape to put in. She picked out &quot;Volcano&quot; and popped it in the VCR. It has<br/>
been years since I have seen it, and I forgot how graphic it gets. I<br/>
tried to persuade dd to pick out something else because of the gore, but<br/>
dd just really wanted this on. 3dd(Cyndi) was intently playing in another<br/>
room, so I told her fine, but if Cyndi, who is very sensitive to this<br/>
kind of thing, starts watching  I want it off. I dozed off for a bit. She<br/>
nudges me and asks me how steam can burn clothes.  I tell her that to the<br/>
best of my knowledge, it can&#39;t, and I go back to sleep. &quot;Mom, why is that<br/>
pond bubbling?&quot; There is a scene with a bubbling tar pit, that is heating<br/>
up from the underground heat being created from an unknown volcano. In my<br/>
dazed state I tell her that water bubbles when it boils. &quot;Like when you<br/>
are cooking?&quot; &quot;Yes, now please let me get some sleep.&quot; Nudge, nudge. The<br/>
questions continue....&quot;How hot is the water?&quot;, &quot;If they put tea bags in<br/>
the pond could they make ice tea?&quot;, &quot;They should throw some chickens and<br/>
carrots in and make chicken soup.&quot;, etc. etc. etc.<br/>
She continues like this throughout the movie. &quot;What is lava?&quot;, &quot;Are there<br/>
any volcanoes near us?&quot;, &quot;Where do volcanos come from?&quot;, &quot;How do doctors<br/>
fix burns?&quot;, etc.etc.etc. I answered what I could, told her to ask her<br/>
Dad a few, and finally told her to *just watch the movie*! As soon as the<br/>
movie finished, and I got in a total of about 20 minutes nap time, I<br/>
plopped the girls in their bubble bath. Next thing I know Cyndi (3dd) is<br/>
pushing a funnel down in the water with the bubbles oozing out the small<br/>
end and says, &quot;Look Mommie, a volcano.&quot; So much for her not watching the<br/>
movie. Then she asks me to get her polly-people so they can get covered<br/>
by the ooze. So much for her sensitivity, too!&lt;g&gt;. Then we all get<br/>
dressed and crash on the sofa bed.<br/>
<br/>
This morning when I woke up I was reflecting on yesterday&#39;s events, and<br/>
thought about how I really dropped the ball. So I was going to make it up<br/>
to Jenni, and make one of those mockup volcanoes, and find pictures and<br/>
stories, and try to answer dd&#39;s questions like they deserved to be<br/>
answered. Nope. Today she is not interested. What she was so intent on<br/>
learning yesterday, is of absolutely no interest today. I missed it. I<br/>
stifled her. What a horrible feeling. Can children learn from movies?<br/>
Only if given a chance....<br/>

Don&#39;t worry.  There are thousand of movies out there and more being made <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721600988">Hi,<br/>
You said you felt cranky, tired and pre-fluish.  You needed to rest and did <br/>
the best you could by answering your dd&#39;s questions.  If you&#39;d forced <br/>
yourself to stay awake and do some volcano-related reading/project your <br/>
daughters wouldn&#39;t have come up with their own questions, conclusions and <br/>
projects (funnel in tub).  They&#39;d also end up with a very cranky, tired and <br/>
sick mom the next day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185982019">Hi, My name&#39;s Mary T. and I&#39;ve been reading for a month- I have a lot to thank you guys for. <br/>
Just wanted to tell loveithere @ juno  (sorry haven&#39;t got names straight) about an experience I had after reading her post last night about her dd and the volcano movie:<br/>
It was about 10 PM (previously known as &#39;after bed time&#39;) after a very long and exhausting day and my 9dd was drawing a person at the table. <br/>
She said &#39;I can&#39;t draw!&quot;, so we talked about how people get better at things-usually by doing the ones they like. We have a book about drawing and I asked her again if she&#39;d like to see some of their hints about drawing people. I told her that morning would be a better time to do this, having that dreaded feeling that my patience was at an end.<br/>
&#39;No, I need to do it now&quot;. OK. Previously I would have been tempted to make her go to bed even though she&#39;d be mad at me, but we gave it another try. She drew a couple of people in the method of the drawing book and came to bed happy and probably went to sleep faster too. <br/>
Take that! Rule gods! Hah!<br/>
So, loveithere, we benefitted from your post, and I think Sandra is right, you&#39;ll have other chances with volcanoes. <br/>
I think you can also overdo it with all kinds of info/activities for an interest- I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t but I have done that with my kids. It&#39;s hard for me to stop after their interest has been long satisfied. Kind of like feeding them after they&#39;re full. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-114205365">Hi Mary T,<br/>
Doesn&#39;t it feel great breaking the &quot;rules&quot; and having such a better<br/>
outcome. This list has made me rethink a lot of things that were<br/>
previously just accepted as so. Now it really bothers me when my old,<br/>
learned behaviors sneak in and I don&#39;t control them in time. Some of the<br/>
most fun and educational times have occurred when breaking the rules.<br/>
Like when my children wanted to play outside in the snow at 12:00am<br/>
because there was finally enough of the white stuff to build snow bricks.<br/>
Like when they wanted to get baths with their bathing suits on. Or like<br/>
when they wanted to watch a movie I really didn&#39;t feel was &quot;fit&quot; for<br/>
young children. These things may be no-brainers for some, but for me they<br/>
are a real struggle. I can always hear my Mom in the background &quot;you<br/>
can&#39;t do that&quot;. &quot;But why?&quot; &quot;Because things just aren&#39;t done that way.&quot;<br/>
Why the heck not??? Nobody is getting hurt. We are having fun. We are<br/>
learning. It was great that your daughter got to stay up late to draw.<br/>
Mary said:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think you can also overdo it with all kinds of info/activities for <br/>

<br/>
I *do* do this. They will mention something they are interested in and I<br/>
will go way overboard to make sure they have enough information to get<br/>
what they are looking for out of it. I don&#39;t feed them after they are<br/>
full, per se. But I do load the table with so much food that they don&#39;t<br/>
know what to choose from, and end up just nibbling here and there. I just<br/>
have to keep reminding myself that *they* will take what *they* need. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012780622">Hello, <br/>
I wanted to put my thoughts in to &quot; Movies and Learning &quot; I find my son learns a great deal from Movies and Learning channels like the History Channel, This is one of his favorites. <br/>
My Brother and my Husband watch a lot of this type of stuff. I think it has a big influence on what he decides to watch. My son will ask a lot of question of them not me. ( Mom does not know anything sind rum). <br/>
He has come to me lately and said when he watches a lot of the movies he watched as a young child, along with some of the cartoons. He has picked up on allot of things he did not realize was in the content. Adult hummer in cartoons. Ideas and information from movies, such as Volcano. This is one of our favorite along with Twister. <br/>
I too tend to go out and buy all I can on items of interest. I learned the hard way to slow down and wait to see what he wants. Books, software, etc. I bought 2 books at about $20 each, now they sit. They even have software that came with it. <br/>
I think I may have to read these myself. They are of interest to him but he says right now he wants to read the informational books on line. He down loads them. <br/>
I too seam to be just warn out right about the time my Son wants to talk or ask questions. Or at the time, that he wants to inform me, of what he has been doing ,his thoughts on something he saw, heard. or has been working on..<br/>
 I work full time and we sometimes miss each other sense our sleeping patterns are sometimes different. <br/>
I use to feel guilt for not giving him enough attention. But have learned that when he whats me he will &quot; NUDGE&quot; me out of a sleep to inform. or ask questions on what he can not find out on his own. <br/>
Learning for my son has always been independent. We are still de schooling. My son still asked to go back to PS. He has to be reminded of the HORROR. <br/>
Good luck to you all. Sorry this is so long. THANKS for reading. Have a good day! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Happy St. Patrick&#39;s Day!!<br/>
