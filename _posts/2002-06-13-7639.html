<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292934954">When my husband was ten or so he was visiting relatives in California, took <br/>
the bike up to retrieve a towel he had left at a filling station after <br/>
swimming, the brakes went out, he ended up under a city bus or some such <br/>
horrible thing, and when he got to the hospital, he didn&#39;t know any address <br/>
or phone number except his house in Almogordo, where nobody was home.  He <br/>
knew they were staying with &quot;Uncle Ed,&quot; but that was his mom&#39;s brother and he <br/>
didn&#39;t have the same last name.  <br/>
<br/>
So they just had to wait for his parents to call around and report him <br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times I have sent my kids out with addresses and phone <br/>
numbers in their pockets, and there were many times when they went somewhere <br/>
with another family when they were younger that I tied a white handkerchief <br/>
around their necks on which I had written with a Sharpie their names, my <br/>
name, my phone number, and the name of the person they were with.   I felt SO <br/>
 much safer and better that the criticism of a few friends about never <br/>
putting your child&#39;s name on them seemed wispy.  It is very possible for a <br/>
child at a place like the state fair to become separated from the people <br/>
they&#39;re with, not remember the last name of &quot;Aunt Irene&quot; or be too distraught <br/>
or unconscious to tell their mom&#39;s name.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to say &quot;No they can&#39;t go because I will worry,&quot; but I did want <br/>
to minimize my real concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Those handkerchiefs used to go in the rags basket under the sink afterwards, <br/>
and it was kinda sweet to come across them from time to time.<br/>

<br/>
I remember when I was 6 or 7 I had a bracelet that had my address<br/>
engraved on the back.  Probably the phone number as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696050988">Wow what a great idea.   My inlaws like to take the<br/>
kids places with lots of people and then forget they<br/>
have taken the kids with them (my kids dont get to go<br/>
very often)  but this is a great way for me not to<br/>
worry so much if they ever go again.  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737667712">Conor has had trouble remembering our street address since we moved here a <br/>
little over two years ago. He&#39;s 13 now, but addresses and strings of numbers <br/>
tend to jumble up in his brain. He can still tell you our old address <br/>
though. Casey memorized the new address right away, all on her own. She&#39;s <br/>
like that.<br/>
<br/>
I can remember opening a bank account for Conor and the woman asking him for <br/>
his address. He looked at me for it and Casey blurted it out. The woman <br/>
actally made a comment to Conor that he should really know that information. <br/>
:-P I&#39;m sure he could have thought of it if given a moment. It was just <br/>
easier to get it from me at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, he crashed this past winter while snowboarding solo at the local <br/>
resort. Even with a slight concussion, he was able to answer all of the ski <br/>
patrol&#39;s questions. When it really counts, he can take care of himself. (BTW <br/>
he was fine after that crash. Ski patrol knows him by name now, though. ;-))<br/>

That is a GREAT idea.<br/>
<br/>
My mom said (after I was grown) that she was humiliated in school because her <br/>
teacher overheard her singing the days of the week on the playground, and <br/>
unexpectedly called on her to sing it in front of the whole class.  This so <br/>
traumatized my mom that she did NOT teach the song to me.  When she told me <br/>
that story, when Kirby was a baby, I was glad she had told it, sorry for her <br/>
seven-year-old- self and thrilled to teach it to my own kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (etc. and four times through) <br/>
to the tune of Yankee Doodle.<br/>
<br/>
Four times through is a month.<br/>
<br/>
QUICK and easy.</div>
