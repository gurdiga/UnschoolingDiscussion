<div id="ygrps-yiv-567897044">I&#39;m brand new here and I&#39;ve only just read through the age appropriate <br/>
thread, but reading that thread has prompted these thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
1st thought- some people think that young children 2yrs+ understand <br/>
the difference between make-believe and reality. I&#39;m not quite so sure <br/>
about that. My daughter who is 4 now, has been to three funerals in <br/>
the past year for her grandpa, grandma and uncle. She was actually <br/>
present when grandma died (the whole family was bedside). She <br/>
understands that these people are gone but clearly does not have a <br/>
firm grasp on what death is. How can a young child who doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand death, understand make-believe or reality? <br/>
<br/>
2nd thought-I personally don&#39;t like saying &quot;they&#39;ve gone to heaven/be <br/>
with the angels/to a better place&quot; because for one, I&#39;ve heard <br/>
children regurgitate this and they clearly don&#39;t know what they&#39;re <br/>
talking about. And for another, &quot;a better place&quot; implies that we are <br/>
living somewhere second best right now. <br/>
<br/>
3rd thought- We have told our 4 year old (3 at the time of the deaths) <br/>
that these people are gone forever (she is just now understanding <br/>
yesterday, today, tomorrow). She seems to accept this and understand <br/>
it to some extent, but she also thinks these people live in the ground <br/>
at the cemetery. So we have tried telling her that the body dies and <br/>
goes away but the spirit stays forever inside all of us. That when she <br/>
laughs, she sounds like grandma; when she draws, her skill comes from <br/>
grandpa; that we all have little bits of each other inside ourselves <br/>
and that is what spirit is. This is one thing she does seem to <br/>
understand quite well. She will say &quot;I have the same smile as Uncle <br/>
Paul&quot; &quot;I sleep just like daddy&quot;.....she really does sleep in the same <br/>
manner as daddy ever since she was newborn! She loves looking at <br/>
family photos and finding similarities. <br/>
<br/>
4th thought- I believed in Santa longer than several of my friends, I <br/>
also believed that the cowboys were really shot and dead at Knott&#39;s <br/>
Berry Farm (a live act). Yet I remember around that time, knowing that <br/>
animals were dead if hit by cars and that I also had to stay out of <br/>
the street or I might die. What kind of perception of reality is that? <br/>
<br/>
I sincerely would like to read other people&#39;s thoughts on dealing with <br/>
death and children. One thing I&#39;m fairly certain of is that there is <br/>
no particular age or light bulb moment of understanding death. I do <br/>
think there are some things in life we grow into understanding over <br/>
time and some things we just can&#39;t ever totally understand. -Cynthia</div>

 </span></blockquote>  Oh! My daughter an I watched a ground squirrel rot away last fall (she was 5, I think she would have liked to watch if she were 3 - all the neat bugs) and that really helped her understand what death involved. It was REALLY neat to watch and some of the beetles we saw were stunning. Might help if the opportunity arises. She&#39;s also got a raging interest in mummies at the moment, this after an interest this spring in sex, so we&#39;ve got the biggies covered. :) <br/>
  We were discussing death yesterday and I said I wanted my body donated to a university for future doctors to study. She said, in a very serious tone, &quot;Mommy, I just want to be bug food.&quot;<br/>

Ren posted this site here (or somewhere else), and I read an article about  <br/>
it in AARP. If she&#39;d REALLY like to be bug food &lt;g&gt;, this might be an  option. <br/>

The first one was started in Westminster, SC by an ecology-minded doctor.  <br/>
They&#39;ve opened another in FL , somewhere else, and are working on one in CA. I  <br/>
think it&#39;s brilliant! We&#39;ve always said we&#39;d be cremated, but this looks <br/>
pretty  cool.<br/>

 <br/>
A little girl I babysat was very confused about the funeral home.  She was almost 4, and her grandma died.  She had gone to the funeral home to see Grandma at a viewing or funeral, and had apparently been told G&#39;ma had gone to heaven.  The next time we drove past the funeral home on our way somewhere else, she excitedly pointed out to Andy &#39;that&#39;s heaven -- it&#39;s where my grandma is.&#39;  I had quite a time explaining to them both that it was the funeral home, heaven was somewhere else entirely. <br/>
 <br/>
When my oldest was almost 5, an aunt of mine died very suddenly (also quite young).  He didn&#39;t really process things right away, but seemed to grasp it slowly.  Several months later his pre-school teacher confided to me that he had told her about his thought on heaven and how nice it must be for everyone with his Aunt Susie there.  Then, several months later his pet mouse died and he was devastated --  I think he was just finally grieving the earlier loss, in that now he understood death as permanent.  <br/>
 <br/>
By the time we were facing my grandma&#39;s death 8 yrs later, he was able to appreciate how precious time with her was before she died.  <br/>

None of the above. <br/>
Probably nobody found the urge to write about it, but I bet a bunch read it.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t tell what will touch off lots of response and what won&#39;t.  Sorry.<br/>
