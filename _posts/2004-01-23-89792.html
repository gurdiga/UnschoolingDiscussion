<div id="ygrps-yiv-781303782">I used to live there... but we always just walked around and &quot;found&quot; things <br/>
to see. The resturants are wayyyyy over priced, like 24 bucks a plate at the <br/>
good ones, so try and bring your own or find a fast food place. Its awesome <br/>
there though...and so old and historical! Its just like walking into the <br/>
past....everyone is in Charactor!! Its free to walk around and look<br/>

line..We got here yesterday evening, got settled in.. (Fairfield <br/>
Kingsgate Timeshare - AWESOME place!)  Today, we got groceries, <br/>
explored around the activity center, went to a candy shop and just <br/>
hung out.  Tomorrow ( weather permitting) we are going to Col <br/>
Wlmsbrg.  We are SOO excited !  As I was driving down yesterday, it <br/>
just hit me.. We are going to the birthplace of America!  IT ALL <br/>
STARTED &quot;HERE&quot;.. (more or less)  The impact of the historical <br/>
magnatude of VA, Jamestown, Yorktown, etc, just hit me like a <br/>
revelation.  We are going to where the first settlers lived! We will <br/>
be standing on the same ground as Pocahontas, Capt. John Smith.. many <br/>
of our founding fathers.  It is indeed wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
  We have watched &quot;the movie&quot;..looked at maps and brochures, and <br/>
generally prepared ourselves to have an awesome time.  I wish I had <br/>
known about dressing up.  I would have had a grand project of making <br/>
our own costumes.. I have patterns for period dress for this time. <br/>
Oh, well, maybe next time.   Thanks for all of the suggestions and <br/>
tips. I am taking notes :-) <br/>

Island this past fall. Harmon and Margaret Blennerhassett were the people who <br/>
were involved with Aaron Burr when he was accused of treason, Blennerhassett <br/>
Island is an Island located in the Ohio River on which the Blennerhassetts lived. <br/>
We took a ferry over from Parkersburg, WV. I became quite fascinated with the <br/>
whole story after attending the Ohio Chautauqua this past summer and hearing <br/>
Debra Conner portray Margaret Blennerhassett. Anyhow, as we were walking around <br/>
the island which is not very big I was quite taken with the thought that <br/>
Aaron Burr had walked across the same lawn.<br/>
<br/>
OK, now you know how easily I am impressed, LOL<br/>
