<div id="ygrps-yiv-236249274">Hi scott,<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed hearing your introduction. I&#39;m not sure why but up until I <br/>
read that I thought you were a radical unschooler. I commend you for <br/>
your quest to do the right thing for your children. <br/>
<br/>
I think Sandra has a great idea about passing out litriture to <br/>
others and let them know that we could talk to them later after they <br/>
have read the information. What I like about it is that it quietly <br/>
states a qoute/comment someone staed not to long ago on this list.<br/>
&quot;I appreciate your concern but your approval is not nessasary&quot;. <br/>
Taking the action of what Sandra suggest is that you are confident <br/>
in what you are doing. <br/>
<br/>
I got a kick out of the trac ideas. I laughed about passing them out <br/>
and I think it&#39;s a great idea. I also like the idea about the comic <br/>
book or whatever else others would come up with. I think just having <br/>
anything handy would be fun to have to get the well meaning family <br/>
members off you back LOL.................<br/>
