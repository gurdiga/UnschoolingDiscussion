            I could have written this post. My soon to be 5yo dd has been so <br/>
into writing and spelling she amazes us. We never introduced the alphabet or <br/>
anything. It started one day when I was writing an address on a box to send. <br/>
She wanted to write also, so she asked me to write a letter so she could copy <br/>
it. Now she is spelling a few words on her own. Daily I have to spell words <br/>
for her as she writes notes and blueprints (dh is a builder). Dh and I were <br/>
wondering the other night if you &quot;normally&quot; learn to spell before you learn <br/>
to read?<br/>
<br/>
    We also planned to HS since conception but I have always wanted to <br/>
unschool even when I was single and childless, I figured I would teach my <br/>
children through life. I HATED PS. Dh has come around almost completely to <br/>
teaching thru life. I think he has some reservations b/c how does he explain <br/>
it to others and of course like someone else mentioned people tend to want to <br/>
test your child. DD is very reserved so she won&#39;t perform anyway. lol<br/>
<br/>
     I just found this list and am thrilled. Back to reading...........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430502527">Yes...learning to write, print and spell can sometimes come before<br/>
reading. My oldest taught herself how to spell her name, write her<br/>
address and answer the phone in a professional manner at age 3 (I am<br/>
hearing impaired) and was reading simple books before going to<br/>
kindergarden. I had no choice...my ex-husband said at that time that<br/>
Rebekah was not going to be homeschooled and that as a deaf person I was<br/>
incapable of homeschooling. I wish now that I had had more backbone at<br/>
that time to tell him to take a flying leap into the lake!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>too cool you are for not actually BELIEVING your ex<br/>
that you were incapable of teaching your child just<br/>
cuz you lack in one of your senses....(look at some of<br/>
the teachers in ps...they seem to lack in more than<br/>
ONE sense, if you catch my drift)...<br/>
can you recommend to me some child friendly Sign<br/>
Language books/computer games, etc, etc...my kids know<br/>
most of the alphabet already...I took a sign language<br/>
class when I was around 5 or so and was so happy to be<br/>
able to go and talk to this deaf couple we knew, even<br/>
if it was only a sentence &lt;g&gt;....and I&#39;ve just always<br/>
loved ASL since. I had a friend who taught me the<br/>
alphabet in German Sign Language but that didn&#39;t<br/>
stick. ... Anyway, my kids are enthralled with it and<br/>
we sign the alphabet when we sing it and if we see<br/>
anyone deaf when we are out and about my son is sooo<br/>
interested to watch them talk so he can &quot;learn it by<br/>
himself&quot;. I downloaded a trial version of a signing<br/>
program that quizzes you on the letters and some<br/>
words, but he can&#39;t read, so he can only do the<br/>
letters part, unless I am sitting there with him.<br/>
whew, I&#39;m long winded aren&#39;t I?<br/>
Anyhoo, if you could recommend anything that would be<br/>
helpful I would be most grateful as would my curious<br/>
little ones. :)<br/>

That is so wonderful. I&#39;m glad you asked me this now instead of yesterday<br/>
lol. I got the timberdoodles catalog a couple days ago and took at least<br/>
two days to look through it. They do have some really cool sign language<br/>
programs and btw, this company is geared towards<br/>
unschoolers/homeschoolers. The catalog is free. The website is<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.timberdoodle.com">http://www.timberdoodle.com</a><br/>
<br/>
anyhow....there is signs for His Glory, Special Signs video ($12),<br/>
Signing at church ($3.75), Signing at Sunday School ($3.75) and my<br/>
favorite Religious Signing ($14.00) The first one is a comprehensive<br/>
study thingy and has three layers Little Ones, Childrens, and Standard.<br/>
Comes with 2 videos and textbook for each layer. This is a total of<br/>
$55.00. Then of course the second one is a video and the last three at<br/>
are books with pictures from what I understand.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter signs somewhat...but I am planning on getting the special<br/>
signs video to help her practice more.<br/>
