<br/>
I guess you could call what we do unschooling religion.  We read about and talk about all kinds of religions.  When my kids ask what I think or believe, I tell them, but I don&#39;t ask them to believe as I do. We are, for want of a better term, atheists who grew up in churches.  Myself in Southern Baptist, my husband in Methodist.  We teach our children what Christians believe, what Hindus believe, and what ancient cultures believed.  We don&#39;t tell them what to think or feel, just expose them to all thoughts and let them take what feels right for them.  And we tell them that&#39;s what we want.  That religion/spirituality/faith is personal and just like choosing what clothes to wear or what foods to eat, it&#39;s okay for everyone to be different and no one is wrong as long as it&#39;s what is truly in their heart.           <br/>
    <br/>
We never condemn other&#39;s or keep them from &quot;religious&quot; things.  They participate in blessing food at friends homes, they understand Christian holidays (as well as others), they are going bowling with their babysitter and her church youth group on Saturday.  The only thing we do ask of them is to live by the Golden Rule, which is universal to all religions.<br/>

secular holiday. It really means nothing more than decorations, day <br/>
of work for DH and presents to us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471069195">Hi, we do it all :-). We celabrate Yule/Winter Solstice with dh family and quite a few of our close friends. We have kinda an open house. Then we celebrate X-mas with my family, although we celebrate it as a family holiday, not as the birth of christ. We have asked that my family respect that we don&#39;t want christianity pushed on our kids and if they choose that path it will be thier choice. So, in our home I guess you could say the kids get the best of both (IMO) worlds and it lasts for about a week, they love it.<br/>

and several of our relatives are so sometimes we celebrate that &quot;OTHER&quot; <br/>
holiday.&lt;g&gt;   My brother, who lives near us celebrates Yule at the<br/>
Solstice so we get in on that.  December is just one fun month around<br/>
here.  Lots of family, lots of friends, lots of food, lots of<br/>
decorations.  We get the best parts of everything.   We might be<br/>
cheating, but we don&#39;t seem to care.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

I suppose we&#39;re &quot;culturally Christians,&quot; we do Christmas and Easter.  If I <br/>
didn&#39;t have kids, I&#39;d go to church those times.  I&#39;ve invited kids and <br/>
they&#39;ve declined.  Now they&#39;re old enough to stay home and I might go.   <br/>
There&#39;s just nothing like a midnight mass in an adobe church in Northern New <br/>
Mexico.  But I haven&#39;t been in years, so maybe there&#39;s REALLY nothing like <br/>
what I remember.  <br/>

That&#39;s not all Yule means.  The word is used in several northern Germanic <br/>
languages to name Christmas.    It&#39;s an older word, yes, but Christmas cards <br/>
from Germany or any Scandinavian country (and a few others) are going to wish <br/>
you some version of &quot;good yul.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Easter, the word &quot;Easter&quot; is of entirely Pagan origin.  <br/>
There are lots of sources on the internet about the histories of those words.<br/>

Since nobody knows or CAN know, one day&#39;s as good as another, and it&#39;s been <br/>

&lt;&lt;  I <br/>
don&#39;t recall what the tune was, but the person was actually playing <br/>
&quot;Greensleeves (sp?)&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What Child is this, who laid to rest on Mary&#39;s lap is sleeping?<br/>
Whom angels greet with anthem sweet; their (I forget what) keeping<br/>
This, this is Christ the King whom shepherds guard and angels sing<br/>
Haste, haste to bring him laud, the Babe, the Son of Mary.<br/>
<br/>
Why lies he in such mean estate, where ox and ass are feeding...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not thinking of all the words.  It&#39;s beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
(heading to google.com...)<br/>
<br/>
WELL!!!!<br/>
<br/>
WITH music playing, it&#39;s at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oremus.org/hymnal/w/w056.html">http://www.oremus.org/hymnal/w/w056.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What child is this, who laid to rest,<br/>
on Mary&#39;s lap is sleeping?<br/>
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,<br/>
while shepherds watch are keeping?<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
This, this is Christ the King,<br/>
whom shepherds guard and angels sing;<br/>
haste, haste to bring him laud,<br/>
the babe, the son of Mary.<br/>
<br/>
Why lies he in such mean estate<br/>
where ox and ass are feeding?<br/>
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here<br/>
the silent Word is pleading. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh,<br/>
come, peasant, king, to own him;<br/>
the King of kings salvation brings,<br/>
let loving hearts enthrone him. Refrain <br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; Greensleeves was written by Henry 8th when he was smitten with <br/>
some bird.<br/>
So it said in my history book.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The words maybe, but the tune&#39;s traditional.<br/>
<br/>
And the words are usually marked &quot;traditional,&quot; but Henry VIII did do a fair <br/>
amount of composition of music and verse!</div>

&quot;taught&quot;/told that Jesus was born on April 6th or 7th.  I believe that<br/>
the RLDS and the LDS churches are still saying this.  Here&#39;s one site<br/>
that I just found to back this up (I&#39;ve read several in the past, so I&#39;m<br/>
sure you&#39;d be able to find more if you are interested):<br/>

This site says maybe September or October:<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think that it really matters in the grand scheme of things, but<br/>
the Mormon church has a better argument IMO.<br/>

&lt;&lt; i&#39;ve heard of lots of christians who celebrate the birth of Jesus in <br/>
another month.i wonder what dec. 25 stands for,then?something must have <br/>
happened on that day,but i wonder what? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Roman festival began.<br/>
<br/>
Christianity has often &quot;commandeered&quot; existing holidays and practices and <br/>
overlaid Christian significance on them.  They did it here with the Pueblo <br/>
Indians.  Their winter dances and feasts have had Christian symbolism added.<br/>

Jesus&#39; birthday is that there is no Biblical mandate to celebrate His <br/>
birthday.  That&#39;s just something that the religion of Christianity <br/>
added.  Big difference between the Christian religion and a <br/>
relationship with Jesus. <br/>
