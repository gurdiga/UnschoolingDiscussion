<h4>Betjeman and Barton Tea Merchants</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160898590">I was  fairly young - around the age of 9 I was taught how to use the washing machine and dryer.  My mom gave me a laundry basket and doing my laundry was then up to me. <br/>
<br/>
 I have to say it worked.  I could leave my clothes on the floor as long as I wanted to - cleaning them or not was up to me.<br/>
<br/>
When I got to college I had to teach a lot of the girls how to do laundry.  My mom and I had a good laugh over that!<br/>

  My son is a total slob too - he&#39;s almost 15 (I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a 12-15yo &quot;Dirty Clothes Hound&quot; gene in kids).  I found that the best way to win the war is to stop doing his laundry.  He knows how to wash clothes - and having his favorite pair of jeans clean when he wants to wear them again is his responsibility now.  It&#39;s certainly a skill I want him to have as an adult!  (Which his father didn&#39;t have - but that&#39;s best left for another board  lol)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have had the opposite experience.  Landon began cleaning up after himself <br/>
when he was about 12.  He just started caring about his room, clothes, <br/>
belongings.    Up until then, he pretty much lived in clutter and mess ( <br/>
except for every 6 mos or so when his dad and I would clean up his room <br/>
because it bugged us so much).  He has done his own laundry since he was <br/>
about 13.     Anna has always been neater and more careful with her things.  <br/>
She does her own laundry too.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766840253">My kids just got their own rooms.  They are responsible for their own laundry now, since they know how to do it (except for my youngest who still needs help).<br/>
<br/>
It just makes everybody&#39;s life easier.  They have their own space in whatever condition it is in...door closed.  I don&#39;t go in unless asked most of the time so they feel their space is truly theirs.<br/>

Same here.  My ds is 14 now and he regularly straightens his own room.<br/>
<br/>
He wants me to get him new clothes, though.  And I asked him to please get rid of the hundreds of clothes he doesn&#39;t wear first (just so there&#39;s room LOL).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think mine started that when he was around that age.  I haven&#39;t been able<br/>
to convince him to actually *deal* with the stuff he takes out of it during<br/>
a cleanup, though.  There&#39;s a big garbage bag full of his throw-aways<br/>
sitting in the living room, along with a broken (heavy) chair.  I could take<br/>
the garbage bag out, but I can&#39;t wrestle the chair out.  I&#39;m curious how<br/>
long they&#39;re going to stay there.  Maybe if I ask once more, he&#39;ll take them<br/>
out tonight so I can clean while he and dad are away at a ball tournament<br/>
this weekend.<br/>
