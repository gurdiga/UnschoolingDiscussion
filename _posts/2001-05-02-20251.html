that were sent yesterday, and I sent several this morning that are <br/>
only NOW beginning to show up, nine hours later! I don&#39;t know what to <br/>
say other than it does make me aware of how dependent I can get on <br/>
this form of communication for my work, and when it&#39;s not functioning <br/>
properly it&#39;s distractingly annoying. Oh, well. Still easier than <br/>
waiting for letters to circulate through the postal system, eh? <br/>
Sometimes I can&#39;t believe we actually got anything *done* that way! <br/>
LOL! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
