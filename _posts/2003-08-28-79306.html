<div id="ygrps-yiv-869242064">My 3 1/2 year old dd put her new magnet (not a fridge one but a pretty strong one) on the TV screen for just a second.<br/>
<br/>
 Now the screen is greenish in one spot and pinkish in another one.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway to save the TV or do we need to get a new one?  I&#39;m not sure which bit of the TV the magnet &#39;messed up&#39; but something is wrong in there :-(<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?  Ideas?  HELP!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suspect it&#39;s ruined. There&#39;s a TV and magnet combo at a local kids museum<br/>
for them to play with and there&#39;s a sign that say &quot;Don&#39;t try this at home!<br/>
It will ruin your TV!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
(Though I hope someone comes back and says I and the sign at the museum are<br/>
wrong!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you&#39;ll need to degauss your tv.  You can take it in to a tv <br/>
repair shop and have someone do it or you can try it yourself.  Go to <br/>
your local Radio Shack and ask for a degausser.  Say it like &quot;dee <br/>
gowser&quot;.  :)  HTH<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s happened to both our TV and our computer. It was &quot;colorful&quot; for a <br/>
while (a week or so?) and then went back to normal. I guess that if it doesn&#39;t <br/>
remain there for long, it&#39;ll be OK. Maybe a prolonged stay on the screen would <br/>
ruin it. <br/>
<br/>
I say wait a bit before running out to buy another.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm. Or go ahead and buy another &quot;just in case&quot;? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

magnet and hold it over (about 2 inches over, not directly ON the TV screen) the <br/>
green area and pull the magnet toward the edge. You will have to do this <br/>
repeatedly. Doing this will pull the colors off the screen. He also said it <br/>
depends on how long the magnet was on the screen or on top of the TV. If it was just <br/>
for a second, then it should be easy for you to pull off. If it was on for <br/>
minutes, then you might have to get a new TV. But that isn&#39;t always true either.<br/>
<br/>
Once, a few years back.... I was rearranging our living room and I stacked <br/>
all of my DH&#39;s stereo speakers on top of the TV. They were up there for about 10 <br/>
minutes when Darin came home, took one look at what I had done to get things <br/>
out of my way and asked me calmly if we had $800 because he wanted a new TV. I <br/>
had NO idea that some speakers have magnets in them! Lucky for us, Darin can <br/>
fix these things. We still have the TV and it still looks as good as it did <br/>
the day we bought it. Except for that inch of dust on it! &lt;g&gt; <br/>

People always call it luck when you&#39;ve acted more sensibly than they have. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466458875">Keith&#39;s TV had developed a REALLY big spot on one side that was all <br/>
discolored.  We figured we&#39;d just live with it.<br/>
<br/>
Then one day he got a tape stuck in the player (built in to the TV) and he <br/>
took it all apart to try to get the tape out.  But I came in and said if he <br/>
unplugged it entirely and plugged it back in it might reset stuff from scratch and <br/>
that would help.  <br/>
<br/>
So he did, and put it back together, and the tape came out and the screen was <br/>
&quot;right&quot; again.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just a freak combo of messing with so many things, but that screen&#39;s as <br/>
good as new.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179569305">I&#39;ve had two big magnet spots on mine for a few days now. I just tried this <br/>
idea -- unplugged it for about three minutes. The colors are back to normal. <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
