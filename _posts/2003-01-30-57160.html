&lt;&lt; . it&#39;s just rare to hear a <br/>
 brazilian, trinidadian or an african using the word (i live in nyc, so <br/>
 the black population is hyper-diverse). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is the same reason I don&#39;t care for the term &quot;African-American&quot; as <br/>
though you can tell which folks fit that label by looking at them!  I had a <br/>
friend from Barbados, she was Barbadian, not African-American at all. But <br/>
being black, she got lumped into that label more often than not.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832910759">You started over &quot;shut up&quot; !?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was in my office last night, just coming to tell me something.  He <br/>
glanced at my mailbox with all the &quot;SHUT UP!!&quot;s there, and he kind of tensed <br/>
up, and said &quot;Who&#39;s telling someone to SHUT UP?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So his reaction was like mine was to even seeing it written that many times.<br/>
