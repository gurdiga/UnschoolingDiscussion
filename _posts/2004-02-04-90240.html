<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043374272">All this talk about pianos!   <br/>
<br/>
A piano has been on my mind all the time lately!!!<br/>
<br/>
My children are 3 1/2 and 1 and both love to play around with our assorted <br/>
collection of musical instruments...bells, drums, shakers, etc.<br/>
We borrowed and electric keyboard from my parents and that gets use too, as <br/>
well as my old flute from jr. high school (I was never any good but didn&#39;t try <br/>
too hard).<br/>
<br/>
I think the kids would love a piano to play around with for now (until they <br/>
show an interest in perhaps learning).  And I really want to take lessons!<br/>
<br/>
My son and I were talking about it last night and I was explaining what <br/>
lessons were:  I said that they teach you how to play songs.  He says &quot;But Mommy, I <br/>
like to play my own songs, I don&#39;t want to learn those guys&#39;.&quot;<br/>
What an great comment from the 3 1/2 yr old!<br/>
<br/>
So for now we are in the market for a used & very cheap piano!  Hoping to <br/>
find one free if we move it....wish me luck!<br/>
