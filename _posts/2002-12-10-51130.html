My dh is a drummer, I could have him email ya!<br/>
But &quot;music&quot; for drums is simply rhythm tablature. All the &quot;notes&quot; are on the <br/>
same line, because there aren&#39;t really notes (unless you&#39;re playing steel <br/>
drums).<br/>
I have NO idea how you tell which drum in the set you&#39;re supposed to be <br/>
playing on as my percussion experience extends only to triangle and cymbals.<br/>
But I know there is a method by which each drum is notated.<br/>
He has to learn whole notes, half notes, fourths ,eighths etc.....<br/>
If you want to talk to Mark his email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Bleuthunderstar@...">Bleuthunderstar@...</a>.<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
