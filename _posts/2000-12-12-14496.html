&gt;<br/>
&gt; DRIVERS or other people stopped by police could be asked to supply<br/>
&gt; on-the-spot hair or saliva samples to identify whether they are wanted<br/>
&gt; criminals.<br/>
&gt; Government scientists have developed a hand-held DNA testing kit to be<br/>
&gt; carried and operated by police officers during regular patrols. The<br/>
&gt; device would be electronically linked to the national DNA database,<br/>
&gt; which Tony Blair has hailed as an essential tool in the fight against<br/>
&gt; crime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Forensic Science Service will disclose to Parliament this week that<br/>
&gt; the equipment could be ready for standard use within a couple of years.<br/>
&gt; The testing kit, which could become as common as the breathalyser or<br/>
&gt; police baton, will dramatically cut the time it takes to match DNA<br/>
&gt; evidence from crime scenes to suspects. It will raise fresh fears among<br/>
&gt; civil liberties campaigners who believe that the pendulum has swung too<br/>
&gt; far in the police&#39;s direction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Forensic scientists already expect that soon they will be able to use a<br/>
&gt; single hair sample to discover a suspect&#39;s eye colour, facial<br/>
&gt; characteristics, height and weight. They say that the next step will be<br/>
&gt; portable testing kits that need little technical ability to operate. The<br/>
&gt; FSS will give evidence to the House of Lords science and technology<br/>
&gt; committee this week, telling peers that research on the kits is well<br/>
&gt; advanced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It currently takes at least 48 hours to profile biological material<br/>
&gt; collected from a crime scene, but the new kits could give police an<br/>
&gt; instant lead if they were made standard issue. They would allow such<br/>
&gt; tests to be carried out outside the laboratory for the first time. A<br/>
&gt; spokesman for the FSS, which is a Government agency, said: &quot;We feel that<br/>
&gt; we have gone as far down the line as we can in terms of what a DNA<br/>
&gt; profile can tell us about an individual and the next area we are looking<br/>
&gt; at is speeding up the process.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Telegraph has seen written evidence to the Lords committee from one<br/>
&gt; of the organisation&#39;s chief scientists, Dr Bob Bramley, and research<br/>
&gt; documents. The committee began its inquiry after becoming concerned<br/>
&gt; about the dramatic increase in the scale of DNA samples collected by the<br/>
&gt; police.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Earlier this year, the Prime Minister announced an extra Â£109 million<br/>
&gt; for the expansion of the police&#39;s DNA database in Birmingham to include<br/>
&gt; samples from &quot;the entire active criminal population&quot; - estimated to be<br/>
&gt; around three million.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The police have already collected nearly a million samples from those<br/>
&gt; convicted of an offence that carries a prison sentence. Senior officers<br/>
&gt; are now lobbying for changes in the law to allow further expansion of<br/>
&gt; the database to include innocent people who volunteer to take part in<br/>
&gt; mass screenings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Civil liberties campaigners are opposing any extension of the police&#39;s<br/>
&gt; authority to to collect samples. They cite an official report which<br/>
&gt; found that thousands of samples are being illegally held on the database<br/>
&gt; because forces are failing to remove the records of acquitted suspects.<br/>
&gt; John Wadham, the director of the human rights group Liberty, said: &quot;The<br/>
&gt; law already allows the unjustified collection of samples and we know<br/>
&gt; that there are at least 50,000 being illegally held at the FSS database.<br/>
&gt; This is not the time to relax the law.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
