<div id="ygrps-yiv-955697136"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;So, how does one recover? How does a person heal the wounds of religious <br/>
&gt;&gt;abuse? Hopefully, within a caring and understanding new social setting.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here we are! ::waving arms frantically:: We&#39;re a cyber-social setting, but I <br/>
think we can manage caring and understanding. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I for one watched my family church evolve into a cult complete with sexual <br/>
abuse and dogmatic church management of the most intimate details of <br/>
personal life. I&#39;ll be happy to take your hand and listen while you heal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Remember also that it will pass.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good words to hold onto. It gets better.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
