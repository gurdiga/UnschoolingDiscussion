<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010186029">Someone on a local unschoolers list posted the following statement: <br/>
&quot;Unschooling can be very structured or not at all.  It really is <br/>
following a childs interests.&quot;   There&#39;s something about it that doesn&#39;t <br/>
sound right to me, but I&#39;m still a newbie.  So I&#39;m looking for input <br/>
here.  What do you all think of this statement as it pertains to <br/>
unschooling?  Is there a definition of unschooling anywhere that  would <br/>
help us newbies explain to even newer newbies what it is?<br/>
<br/>
TIA!<br/>

<br/>
I realize now that the emphasis on &quot;strutured&quot; or &quot;unstructured&quot; <br/>
learning shows a bias right away. There isn&#39;t almost any child <br/>
who says, &quot;Can I please do my spelling book at nine and my <br/>
math book at ten and then read about planets and stars and take <br/>
notes in my notebook?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
To allow a child to totally direct their own learning is so radical <br/>
that I think for most moms, it never occurs to them as an option. <br/>
So it isn&#39;t even on the radar screen of the discussions about <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I used to think of &quot;radical unschooling&quot; as a label for lazy <br/>
momsmoms who didn&#39;t want to bother even being engaged in <br/>
their kids&#39; interests.<br/>
<br/>
Since being on this list, I&#39;m learning differently.<br/>
<br/>
The key difference in my mind is philosophical and has to do <br/>
with how we see our children. It isn&#39;t a matter of a child&#39;s <br/>
academic preferences, his learning interests or how he absorbs <br/>
information. Those observations will often lead moms toward <br/>
unschooling or at least, relaxed homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But this idea of radical unschooling is something else. It&#39;s a <br/>
fundamental trust that persons of all ages can and do make <br/>
wise decisions about their needs and will be able to grow and <br/>
develop at their own pace with support and nurturing of caring <br/>
parents. There isn&#39;t a single word about interests, structure or <br/>
education in that definition... but it&#39;s the only definition that helps <br/>
me to release my kids to follow their interests, to support their <br/>
choices and to even help them create a structure that they initiate <br/>
and want, if they want it.<br/>
<br/>
I have two kids who set down goals and wanted help creating <br/>
steps to get there. That is totally different than me saying, &quot;I can <br/>
tell you prefer structure so let&#39;s set up a daily schedule for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I look at unschooling as a technique, I&#39;ve already missed it. I <br/>
have to see it as a way of life.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise I start with the wrong premise.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe because it says unschooling can be structured. A family&#39;s life or a<br/>
child&#39;s life or a child&#39;s way of learning may be structured, but unschooling<br/>
itself isn&#39;t. Saying unschooling can be structured sounds like the parent is<br/>
imposing a structured following of interests.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866151335">And I thought of it more as &quot;I could learn something through trial and error<br/>
and stumbling on interesting information or I could decide I wanted to learn<br/>
about X and plan out a course to do so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That would apply to anyone--me, my kid, etc.  I learn so much by just<br/>
listening and being open.  That&#39;s unstructured.  I also learn by chosing a<br/>
book or two, or an expert to ask.  That&#39;s more structured.<br/>
<br/>
But so long as it is my (or my child&#39;s) choice, then it would still be<br/>
unschooling--right?<br/>

&gt; But that&#39;s what the wquestion conjures up in a mother&#39;s head.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To allow a child to totally direct their own learning is so radical<br/>
&gt; that I think for most moms, it never occurs to them as an option.<br/>
&gt; So it isn&#39;t even on the radar screen of the discussions about<br/>
&gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In fact, I used to think of &quot;radical unschooling&quot; as a label for lazy<br/>
&gt; moms-moms who didn&#39;t want to bother even being engaged in<br/>
&gt; their kids&#39; interests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since being on this list, I&#39;m learning differently.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The key difference in my mind is philosophical and has to do<br/>
&gt; with how we see our children. It isn&#39;t a matter of a child&#39;s<br/>
&gt; academic preferences, his learning interests or how he absorbs<br/>
&gt; information. Those observations will often lead moms toward<br/>
&gt; unschooling or at least, relaxed homeschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But this idea of radical unschooling is something else. It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; fundamental trust that persons of all ages can and do make<br/>
&gt; wise decisions about their needs and will be able to grow and<br/>
&gt; develop at their own pace with support and nurturing of caring<br/>
&gt; parents. There isn&#39;t a single word about interests, structure or<br/>
&gt; education in that definition... but it&#39;s the only definition that helps<br/>
&gt; me to release my kids to follow their interests, to support their<br/>
&gt; choices and to even help them create a structure that they initiate<br/>
&gt; and want, if they want it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have two kids who set down goals and wanted help creating<br/>
&gt; steps to get there. That is totally different than me saying, &quot;I can<br/>
&gt; tell you prefer structure so let&#39;s set up a daily schedule for you.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I look at unschooling as a technique, I&#39;ve already missed it. I<br/>
&gt; have to see it as a way of life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Otherwise I start with the wrong premise.<br/>

<br/>
Might be too long, but that&#39;s what&#39;s been the big mind-shift for <br/>
me. It impacts everyone from littlest baby right on up to Dad.<br/>
