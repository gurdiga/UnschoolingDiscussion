<br/>
Ds and I are reading Bradbury&#39;s classic as part of a community reading and <br/>
discussion initiative (I&#39;ve never read it before -- I am SO deprived), and I <br/>
open the book and on the dedicatory page it says this:<br/>
<br/>
If they give you ruled paper, write the other way.<br/>

Why haven&#39;t I read this book before?!  <br/>
<br/>
       He felt at ease and comfortable.  *Why aren&#39;t you in school?  I see <br/>
you every day wandering around.*<br/>
       *Oh, they don&#39;t miss me,* she said.  *I&#39;m antisocial, they say.  I <br/>
don&#39;t mix.  It&#39;s so strange.  I&#39;m very social indeed.  It all depends on what you <br/>
mean by social, doesn&#39;t it?  Social to me means talking to you about things <br/>
like this.*  She rattled some chestnuts that had fallen off the tree in the <br/>
front yard.  *Or talking about how strange the world is.  Being with people is <br/>
nice.  But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s social to get a bunch of people together and then <br/>
not let them talk, do you?  An hour of TV class, an hour of basketball or <br/>
baseball or running, another hour of transcription history or painting pictures, <br/>
and more sports, but do you know, we never ask questions, or at least most <br/>
don&#39;t; they just run the answers at you, bing, bing, bing, and us sitting there <br/>
for four more hours of film teacher.  That&#39;s not social to me at all.  It&#39;s a <br/>
lot of funnels and a lot of water poured down the spout and out the bottom, and <br/>
them telling us it&#39;s wine when it isn&#39;t...*<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>

That book was on our &quot;required reading&quot; list when I was in high school.  I <br/>
loved it!  It&#39;s one of Landon&#39;s favorites too.<br/>

Ds doesn&#39;t seem as taken with it, but we&#39;ll see.  He actually asked me how <br/>
much of it he *had* to read today!  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  We&#39;ve been out of <br/>
the system for so long, yet he still persists in thinking this way.  I told him, <br/>
of course, that he didn&#39;t *have* to do anything.  <br/>
<br/>
(I hope he&#39;ll pick it back up, though.  If not now -- later.  I&#39;ll probably <br/>
take him along with me to one of the community discussions that&#39;s scheduled for <br/>
next week.  Maybe that will pique his interest.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444610839">Okay, Fahrenheit 451 goes on our &quot;Ray Bradbury Must Reading&quot;... I <br/>
finally talked Abbie into reading The Martian Chronicles, and it <br/>
depressed her...It IS a depressing book, overall...I&#39;d like her to <br/>
give his short space stories a try. I loved many of those as a kid.<br/>
<br/>
But I haven&#39;t read F451 in more than 30 years, I bet. It&#39;s time. Re-<br/>
reading books as an adult, that one enjoyed as a kid, is a good thing <br/>
to do. Ray Bradbury was one of my favorite authors, and re-reading <br/>
Illustrated Man and Martian Chronicles this past week or so... a <br/>
completely different experience than the first (and second, and <br/>
third) time through, when I was in Jr. High.<br/>
