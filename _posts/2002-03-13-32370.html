My objective was to try to clear some of the smoke of an ongoing <br/>
smouldering and firey debate.<br/>
<br/>
Since noboby argues nearly as much about chores.. since it falls into the <br/>

would clear.<br/>

doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve gotten lost.&quot;<br/>

&gt; This is a great segway to something that crosses my mind.. and I forget<br/>

&gt; Does TV fall into the &#39;unschooling&#39; or the &#39;unparenting&#39; category to you?<br/>
