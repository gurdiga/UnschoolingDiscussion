&lt;&lt; Julie, is she an only?  i sometimes think it&#39;s tons easier to <br/>
 organise to do this kind of thing with an only.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
No, She is three and I have a 14month old son.  You are right it was much <br/>
easier with just one!  Two is very exhausting trying to keep up or catch up <br/>
whichever the case my be....<br/>

mil were &quot;mine yours and ours&quot;. She says after 3 it&#39;s<br/>
all the same. 3/13 doesn&#39;t make a difference. I have<br/>
3. Oldest is 5 and due end of October. :-) Corallyn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557380780">I was an only and I have friends that have onlys and it&#39;s far more demanding<br/>
than you think. You are the main source of entertainment for the child. I<br/>
remember when my second became old enough to interact with my first. I felt<br/>
like a new person. They we&#39;re playing with each other and I didn&#39;t<br/>
constantly have to be entertaining her. I know moms of onlys that spend all<br/>
their time on the phone planning their kid&#39;s days. At least those of us with<br/>
more than one know that they&#39;ll always have someone to play with.<br/>
