there was a man trying to get another man&#39;s<br/>
attention in the street in front of my house the other<br/>
day, and he yelled &quot;Hey!  Hey!  Hey, guy!&quot;  lol, now<br/>

DH Joey came inside the house on a  day early in our marriage and said, &quot;I <br/>
know I&#39;m a grown up now.&quot;<br/>
Apparently a little boy down the street wanted to ask him something and got <br/>
his attention by calling &quot;Hey Mister!&quot;<br/>
