different email lists about different behaviors.  <br/>

The answer is -- YES.  Your child is normal.<br/>
<br/>
You may well go thru a process of &quot;deschooling&quot; which looks suspiciously like <br/>
doing nothing for an annoyingly long period of time.  That&#39;s OK.<br/>
<br/>
If your child wants to do a math-type activity, great.  If not, that&#39;s OK too.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, sorry to disappoint your ds, but his activities already involve a lot of <br/>
science and math! :)  <br/>
<br/>
The beauty of hsing -- you get to be yourself!<br/>
