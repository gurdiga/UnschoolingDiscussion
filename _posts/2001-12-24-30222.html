<div id="ygrps-yiv-844257739"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Wow, Sarah, that is just what I needed to hear.  The people that have <br/>
&gt;screamed at me have sounded just like your SIL - saying I think I am <br/>
&gt;better than everyone.  It is so hard not to respond back.  It takes me <br/>
&gt;days to get over their comments wishing I could just give them a piece of <br/>
&gt;my mind but then I calm myself down by reminding myself that nothing would <br/>
&gt;change and I would have stooped to their level.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes I get this about homeschooling. Which I find funny because I <br/>
NEVER offer that information.<br/>
<br/>
And I never ask &#39;what school is your kid in&#39; (grade) etc.<br/>
<br/>
But people ask me and I don&#39;t lie. Then they are either interested or <br/>
taken aback by it.<br/>
<br/>
One woman responded that &#39;Well, not everyone can afford to homeschool&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
We took a major change in our life to afford this. We gave up on a lot. <br/>
Including owning a home (for now at least).<br/>
<br/>
Its not a matter of affording it, its a matter of what one is willing to <br/>
do to do it.<br/>
<br/>
It comes down to how much one beleives in what they are doing is right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413288610">Kolleen, that&#39;s  exactly right. For years,the money issue would come <br/>
up...we did without financial gain because we believe so strongly in <br/>
hsing. We were unable to participate in the xmas gift exchange among <br/>
my siblings (all doing financially well) and *none* of them seemed to <br/>
understand. In fact, they would treat me as a lesser person (imo) <br/>
because of it. Well, I worried about it for years. I finally realized <br/>
I love my siblings but I love my kids more and I refuse to worry <br/>
about the opinions of my siblings any longer. <br/>
<br/>
I believe a lot of us hsers have had to make a choice between <br/>
sibling/parent relationships and our own families. Maybe that&#39;s why <br/>
we (I)  feel such a need for community here and on other lists of <br/>
this type. Like family, we can argue and disagree but  please... <br/>
let&#39;s not cross that line to personal insults and judging others. We <br/>
all have enough of that in our own families! ;-)<br/>
Happy Holidays,<br/>
Sarah<br/>
