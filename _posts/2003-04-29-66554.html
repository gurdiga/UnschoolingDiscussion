<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154980158">I&#39;ve changed the subject line, but Idon&#39;t think that will help, at all.  <br/>
Because you asked, I am offering MY opinion, so here goes.....<br/>
<br/>
One minute you say you &quot;don&#39;t get it&quot;.  The next minute, you scream you do.  <br/>
You have been asked not to post, yet you can&#39;t seem to help yourself from <br/>
doing so.  You blabber on about how we think you are a &quot;fake liar&quot;, which I <br/>
NEVER saw anything of the liking posted.  You think EVERYONE who isn&#39;t <br/>
coddling you through this is being negative and ONLY talking about MATH <br/>
PHOBIA.  This is NOT about math phobia, it is about your intense desire to <br/>
push, push, push GLENA&#39;S WANTS and not your child&#39;s.  If I have to go back <br/>
and RE-post what you wrote to Sandra I will, but instead, go back and read <br/>
what you said to her.  Your post screamed sarcasm in an attempt to &quot;thank&quot; <br/>
her.  THAT was immature!  Asking for help, GETTING help and REFUSING to TRY <br/>
it, imho is immature.  Rambling on and on and on about how you understand, <br/>
which clearly you do not, then screaming that &quot;OH, I GET IT, REALLY I DO&quot;, <br/>
*then* asking for us to explain it to you another million times, s immature.<br/>
<br/>
It is clear to me that you are seeking instruction.  Sandra GAVE you links <br/>
for &#39;instruction&#39; in unschooling.  That wasn&#39;t good enough.  You seek a <br/>
teacher to guide you through this process to YOUR liking, well, obviously <br/>
none of us can do that unless we slip in a game for you to disguise the fact <br/>
that you WANT for your children to LOVE learning this and that.<br/>
<br/>
If you STILL don&#39;t get it, don&#39;t ask ME again, because I have nothing left <br/>
to offer you in the present state you are in.  *I* think you enjoy argueing <br/>
moot points more than *listening* to golden gems.  But this isn&#39;t about me, <br/>
it&#39;s about YOU!!!!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You know, I have tried really hard to be understanding of your frustration <br/>
&gt;but this is such an immature response.  I almost want to ask you if you <br/>
&gt;WANT us to say those things.  Good grief, take Sandra&#39;s advice, please!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, explain to me how/why it&#39;s immature?  I certainly DON&#39;T get it.  I am<br/>
more than willing to &quot;listen&quot; to what you have to say about it, just give me<br/>
specifics, not just blank negativity.<br/>
<br/>
glena who is wondering how the posts are being READ but the subject line <br/>
that<br/>
was changed yesterday is still the same?<br/>
