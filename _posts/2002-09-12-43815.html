<br/>
I disagree.  It is not &quot;just a sound&quot;.  A &quot;sound&quot; would be a bell <br/>
ringing, a wind blowing, a crash. The &quot;F&quot; word is a crude and vulgar <br/>
term, with a specific meaning in our culture.  If one of my children <br/>
used it, I would be very disappointed in them as they have grown up <br/>
knowing it is a crude and vulgar word.  But, then, we don&#39;t say sh*# <br/>
around here either.  Odd how our values and morals seep into <br/>
everything we say or do, isn&#39;t it?   Even when my children use the <br/>
word &quot;butt&quot; I ask them why they don&#39;t choose a better word.  I had a <br/>
professor in college who pointed out how crude that word is when <br/>
there are so many other choices. (we like to say BUM for little baby <br/>
bottoms and bottom for larger ones!)    And, yes, I probably do have <br/>
a double standard for men and women.  I like to think women in <br/>
general, and especially mothers, have a little more class than men!  <br/>
ha!  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; term, with a specific meaning in our culture.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that it sounds vulgar, at least for my taste.  I don&#39;t like <br/>
sh** either, and I also don&#39;t like crap.  I don&#39;t like a**.  I don&#39;t <br/>
like he**.  I don&#39;t have an intelligent answer why, I just find them <br/>
distasteful. Probably the way I was raised.  My husband and I don&#39;t <br/>
ever say any of those words, neither do any of my kids&#39; friends of <br/>
grandparents.  They&#39;ve never heard any of them, except for perhaps <br/>
occasionally on tv.  But they usually watch pbs or toon disney, so <br/>
there&#39;s not too much on tv for them to here either.  <br/>
<br/>
But as far as having a specific meaning in our culture, do they <br/>
really?  I mean, if someone says &quot;What the he**, they&#39;re not talking <br/>
about the actual place, they&#39;re saying &quot;Oh, who cares.&quot;   And if they <br/>
say dam*, they&#39;re not talking about cursing someone to hell, they&#39;re <br/>
just saying, &quot;Ooh, I wish that wouldn&#39;t have happened&quot;.  And even the <br/>
f word, If someone says Now I&#39;m fu****, they&#39;re just saying, &quot;Oh no, <br/>
now I&#39;m in big trouble&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what I would do if they ever used one of those words.  I <br/>
would be upset, but I don&#39;t know if I would be able to give them a <br/>
good reason WHY the words are wrong.  Just because *I* think they&#39;re <br/>
distasteful isn&#39;t a solid answer, I don&#39;t think.  <br/>
<br/>
I have taught my children that it is wrong to take God&#39;s name in <br/>
vain.  They know to never say &quot;Oh my God&quot; or &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; unless <br/>
they are praying or discussing Jesus Christ.  <br/>

My mother in law was very disappointed in my kids because they would refer to <br/>
baby-doo-doo as &quot;poop.&quot;  That was just too foul for her delicate ears to hear.<br/>
<br/>
The woman had been a nurse most of her life, starting before WWII, and she <br/>
had had three children of her own and she couldn&#39;t hear &quot;poop&quot;??<br/>
<br/>
So she told my children to call it &quot;BM&quot; and they came to me and asked what <br/>
that meant.  I said it means &quot;bowel movement,&quot; which is a way to say poop or <br/>
shit without saying poop or shit.<br/>
<br/>
Bowel movement is an action, not a turd.  A turd is a poop.  <br/>
<br/>
I prefer clarity to sanitation, I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654789179">Nancy,<br/>
This cracked me up!!!!   It reminds me of when I was in the hospital after<br/>
having  both kids. Everyone wanted to know  whether or not I&#39;d had a &quot;BM&quot;. I<br/>
would take a walk up the hall and the cleaning gal would ask me for crying<br/>
out loud! I was a slow learner but finally figured out they weren&#39;t going to<br/>
let me go home until I had.<br/>
Thanks for the laugh,<br/>

First of all this first part from Sandra cracked me up!! I guess just the <br/>
way she worded it was just too funny for me.<br/>
<br/>
Second of all, the last time I had my baby, almost 2 years ago, all the <br/>
nurses were as sweet as anything. But they made no bones about asking me if <br/>
I pooped yet or peed or even farted. I was a little taken aback by the <br/>
wording. I&#39;m not a prude but was expecting something a little different from <br/>
medical personal. It was rather funny after I got use to it!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931753360">You know I was just thinking about this the other day.  My great <br/>
aunt also made us call it BM.  I really hated using that.  To this <br/>
day, I still just call it poop.  Sarah is 9 and it doesn&#39;t bother her <br/>
if we swear (she calls them big people words) , but I just don&#39;t like <br/>
to do it around her. My dh, on the other hand, refers to it <br/>
as &quot;taking a dump&quot;, which Sarah says sometimes.  It&#39;s ok as long as <br/>
she doesn&#39;t say it in mixed company.  I&#39;d really prefer if I didn&#39;t <br/>
know what they were doing in the bathroom anyway!!! LOL!<br/>
