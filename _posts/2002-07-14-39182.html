beyond PS.<br/>
Seems like difficult times to raise kids in altogether, if You ask me.  <br/>

an accident I can get it fixed.<br/>
<br/>
I think parents whose kids who loved learning before they want to school and<br/>
now don&#39;t after school, or who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re interested in any<br/>
more, or see anything that looks like it might be something educational as<br/>
tainted by school would find damage to be very descriptive of what happened<br/>
to their child.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately it isn&#39;t something that just stops once kids leave school.<br/>
They do carry the meta-lessons home with them.<br/>

situation? I think giving them the opportunity to heal is fixing them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Well said, Liza.  I don&#39;t have any doubt the ps is really bad for <br/>
some kids but I don&#39;t think they are *damaged* beyond repair. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A flaw is naturally occuring.  Damage comes from without.<br/>
<br/>
There is always someone to blame.  We make a choice to keep our kids home, or <br/>
to send them to school, and that leaves US to blame.<br/>
<br/>
I will name two people damaged beyond compare:  Charles Montoya and Alice <br/>
Laws.  <br/>

Dead at the ages of 14 and 15 because school and kids were unbearable to them.<br/>

You all know they&#39;re not the only ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960308744">**I don&#39;t have any doubt the ps is really bad for some kids but I don&#39;t think <br/>

<br/>
Damage is a word normally used for inanimate objects. That may be why people <br/>
are reacting so negatively to it&#39;s use for children. So how about wounded? <br/>
<br/>
School (not just public school) harms ALL kids, in my opinion. But since <br/>
almost everyone in this society has gone through school, identifying the harm <br/>
isn&#39;t easy unless it&#39;s more extreme than usual. Normally resilient kids can <br/>
come out okay, in relation to the rest of society. <br/>
<br/>
Taking kids out of school allows the wounds to their intellect to heal, but <br/>
it&#39;s not the same as not having ever been wounded in the first place. And <br/>
some kids aren&#39;t very resilient by nature. They&#39;re slow to heal and they will <br/>
always bear scars. But most will eventually heal so you forget that they were <br/>
wounded, except for every once in a while when something brings their faint <br/>
scars into high relief. <br/>
