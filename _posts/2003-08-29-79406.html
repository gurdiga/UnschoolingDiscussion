<div id="ygrps-yiv-960814210">Well, I returned Monday from a little speaking tour to discover....<br/>
<br/>
Meera, (just turned 13! yikes!) who had told us in no uncertain terms<br/>
that, despite her extraordinary gift, she hates playing the piano in<br/>
public, now informs us that she is performing a benefit concert next<br/>
month!<br/>
<br/>
Seems that she overheard a conversation between a librarian friend<br/>
from our Friends Meeting and my wife&#39;s cousin Susan about how much<br/>
they wanted to bring members of the &quot;Israeli-Palestinian Bereaved<br/>
Families Forum for Peace&quot; (www.theparentscircle.com/) to Olympia, but<br/>
needed to raise funds.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know how to do that,&quot; said Meera, apparently quite nonchalantly.<br/>
<br/>
Next thing we know, they&#39;ve rented a large church hall, and Meera is<br/>
planning a program of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Albeniz,<br/>
Granados, Rachmaninoff, and Khachaturian. (you can write me if you<br/>
want the exact program.)<br/>
<br/>
She has told her piano teacher not to attend - she&#39;s doing this for<br/>
fun, she says, and doesn&#39;t want his comments on her playing.<br/>
&quot;Besides,&quot; she says, &quot;I know when I make mistakes, so what&#39;s the point?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But she wants to fill the place because, after all, &quot;we need the<br/>
money.&quot; I&#39;m pinching myself, and, as my wife duly advises, trying to<br/>
keep my big mouth shut (which, as folks who know me can attest, can be<br/>
quite a trial.)<br/>
<br/>
However, Meera has made quite clear that she wants ME to fill the<br/>
place up (there are 700 seats, gulp!) So this is more than an<br/>
invitation -- (threat: if you don&#39;t come, and live within 400 miles, I<br/>
won&#39;t love you anymore! <br/>

have no idea whether she&#39;ll come, but is there only one United Church in<br/>
Olympia?<br/>
