<div id="ygrps-yiv-879394241">hi<br/>
<br/>
i think that this is a normal part of trying to have power in the world and<br/>
expressing it.   so in that way there is nothing to worry about, but ones<br/>
ego does needs to be balanced by ones curiosity, so meeting and having a<br/>
good relationship with challenges is very important.   if one doesn&#39;t learn<br/>
to appreciate the challenges life offers then one will most likely end up<br/>
playing it safe.   for me unschooling has to do with the relationship<br/>
between the person and the unknown, not the known (because you&#39;re not<br/>
really learning if it&#39;s too easy).   so being a perfectionist (which is<br/>
what traditional education promotes) is a good thing when used to do<br/>
something well, but not good if it limits you to doing only things which<br/>
you know you can do well.<br/>
<br/>
that said, on a practical level, my son is exactly as you describe, if he<br/>
try (s) something, but ...can&#39;t do it well, he immediately says, &quot;Oh,  I<br/>
don&#39;t want to do this anymore.&quot;   so what i&#39;ve done is find something<br/>
similar:  a puzzle, a computer game, a model, fixing the sink, anything<br/>
concrete and visible, and struggle with it in front of him.  for example<br/>
i&#39;m really poor musically and we had just bought a cd rom called &#39;yoda&#39;s<br/>
challenge&#39; which has a music component, you have to beat out the exact<br/>
rhythm to trigger a trap.  i struggled with this, but after more than a<br/>
dozen attempts and trying different tricks i did repeatedly succeed,<br/>
thereby learning a bit about keeping rhythm .   at the same time i talked<br/>
to him about the nature of the word &#39;challenge&#39; and how much fun it really<br/>
was to take on challenges, because when you finally succeed it is the best<br/>
feeling, the feeling of accomplishment, and this feels much better than<br/>
doing something that you knew you could do.   then you just wait and keep<br/>
encouraging them.<br/>
<br/>
what i find is that we, as a society, get very enthusiastic when we do<br/>
something right but we pretty much ignore the really great attempts that<br/>
fail.  i think this is a real problem because most great things<br/>
(inventions, idea etc.) are preceded by many, many failures.  so if we can<br/>
teach our children to not fear failures but to learn from them and to<br/>
actually relish them for what these failures teach, then our kids will<br/>
become life long learners.  failures are great opportunities for us to not<br/>
only expand our knowledge but to face our fears and challenge them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299227075">I think it helps to point out to kids that experts, artists, and<br/>
professionals aren&#39;t satisfied with everything they produce.  How many<br/>
photos did Ansel Adams take before he had one he was willing to print out<br/>
for other people to enjoy?  How many times did Edison start over with the<br/>
light bulb?  It is extremely rare to do something right the first time.<br/>
<br/>
A friend was looking at my baby&#39;s photo album (first child, #2&#39;s pictures<br/>
are all in a box!) and commented on what wonderful pictures I take.  I<br/>
explained that I&#39;m thrilled to get 4 out of 24 that are worth keeping.  I<br/>
throw the rest away, or give them to the kids to cut up for art projects.<br/>
<br/>
It can also help to verbalize during our own efforts.  &quot;These muffins<br/>
didn&#39;t turn out the way I wanted them too.  Next time I&#39;ll add more milk&quot;<br/>
 That sort of thing.  So they realize that less than perfect can be OK.<br/>

<br/>
Regarding perfectionism... our 17 year old has always been thus. It was<br/>
frustrating for me as a parent because I am &quot;not&quot; a perfectionist, at<br/>
least not in all things. :)  We have discovered, over the course of many<br/>
years, that she does not want us to &quot;solve&quot; her problems, she just wants<br/>
a sympathetic ear. I hastened to help her when she was very young,<br/>
because I knew that major frustrations could cause an outbreak of tears.<br/>
Of course, that just made her angrier. Perfectionist kids grow up to be<br/>
perfectionist adults. She is a classic first child, over achiever.<br/>
Everything she does, she does well, to the best of her ability. That&#39;s<br/>
not to say that there are not people who perform better than her... but<br/>
she definitely puts forth 200% effort in all she does. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122461564">Hi people,,<br/>
<br/>
Since i was little i was the classic perfectionist,,,,,,and it ended up <br/>
messing up my whole life----until i was 30----because i saw the world as <br/>
having the &#39;right&#39; answers, and me having to fit into what it wanted.<br/>
This is probably the main reason i took my daughter out of school.  She is <br/>
very smart,,,but also very creative,,,and even though she came into <br/>
kindergarden with very high &#39;scores&#39;,,,,the creative element,,,and the <br/>
&#39;heart&#39;,,,,,,were ignored from there on out.  She (and i think most kids <br/>
naturally) think &#39;outside the box&#39;,,,,,which makes some kind of objective <br/>
perfectionism non-existent.   <br/>
This was my greatest realization for me a few years ago,,,,when i realized i <br/>
wasn&#39;t stupid (went back to school and was getting a 4.0 after so many years <br/>
of feeling inadequate),,,,,, and realized i wasn&#39;t weird,,,,just had a <br/>
&#39;different&#39; way of seeing things.  The whole field of quantam physics proves <br/>
the world is much more subjective than ever thought before.<br/>
I know my daughter sees things different too,,,,,,and she is very <br/>
intuitive,,,,,and the attitude of school,,,,,&#39;there is only this way,,and <br/>
this way only&#39;  was really cutting into who she is,,,,,,,,soooo,,,<br/>
I am trying to balance it,,,,there are logical, stable elements (i.e. 2+2=4), <br/>
but I really let her explore the other, creative, non-logical side,,,,,where <br/>
there are no &#39;right&#39; answers,,,,,only ones that show you&#39;re actually thinking <br/>
:-)  It seems in school there is so much emphasis on facts needed to <br/>
learn,,,,and no emphasis on things we don&#39;t really know about--or, what do <br/>
you think about that------without having an immediate &#39;you&#39;re right&#39;, &#39;you&#39;re <br/>
wrong&#39; response.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone,,,,,,,you&#39;re a wonderful support :-)  Jennifer</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577926352">On this topic -- we have a mild case of perfectionism in my son.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, he completely startled me by explaining to his younger sister that <br/>
you can never really be &quot;perfect.&quot;  That you can always get better.  They <br/>
were talking about their piano class.  He is older and more advanced than she <br/>
and she had commented that he was perfect and therefore was moving to <br/>
semi-private lessons and she was staying in a group.  <br/>
<br/>
If he gets nothing else out of piano lessons, I will be happy that he learned <br/>
this.  Apparently the music teacher (who drives me nuts by being totally <br/>
disorganized but the kids love him) was able to communicate this or maybe my <br/>
son just figured it out, I don&#39;t know -- but music was what it took to get <br/>
the message thru here.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469231169">The comments on perfectionism have been very interesting. I think that it&#39;s<br/>
really important to teach our kids (and ourselves, too) to generate<br/>
alternative solutions to problems--that there is generally more that one way<br/>
to solve a problem. That different doesn&#39;t mean right or wrong--it just<br/>
means different! When my dd a(now 11 1/2)<br/>
was in kdgn, she was admonished for &quot;messy coloring&quot;. This doesn&#39;t fan the<br/>
