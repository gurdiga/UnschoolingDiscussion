<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308064840">I am new and have never posted before. I feel like I have sailed a rough<br/>
sea and finally found dry land - and that is a modest way of saying<br/>
it!:) I have wanted to teach my kids (6) at home the unschooling way and<br/>
didn&#39;t know there was any such thing. My kids endured school and that is<br/>
putting it mildly. More than one has suffered to the extreme by just<br/>
being in the building. I don&#39;t want to go into it all and drag up the<br/>
trauma. I am SO happy to have finally found exactly what I have been<br/>
looking for. If it weren&#39;t for my youngest son yelling and screaming and<br/>
telling me about his nightmares about going back to school - he&#39;s 11 - I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have bothered to investigate homeschooling again. I found this<br/>
site when I went to VAHE site. So now that I am on dry land I am off to<br/>
explore the territory! Michele<br/>
